Abstract: Set theory is a branch of mathematics with a special subject
matter, the inﬁnite, but also a general framework for all modern
mathematics, whose notions ﬁgure in every branch, pure and applied.
This Element will oﬀer a concise introduction, treating the origins of the
subject, the basic notion of set, the axioms of set theory and immediate
consequences, the set-theoretic reconstruction of mathematics, and
the theory of the inﬁnite, touching also on selected topics from higher
set theory, controversial axioms and undecided questions, and
philosophical issues raised by technical developments.

1 Historical Roots
Although in retrospect others (Bernard Bolzano, Richard Dedekind) can be
viewed as precursors, set theory was largely the creation of a single individual,
Georg Cantor, beginning in the 1870s, and his key work (Cantor, 1915) remains
highly readable to this day. He launched the ﬁeld with two results on questions
with ancient roots.
1.1 Strings to Ordinals
Pythagoreans noted that if the lengths of otherwise similar strings are in the ratio
2:1, the shorter sounds an octave higher. Why? Because it vibrates twice as
quickly. In modern mathematical language, if the graph of the displacement of the
center of the string with time approximates y ¼ cos x for the longer, it will
approximate y ¼ cos 2x for the shorter. No real string vibrates so simply, and a
better approximation for the long string would be y ¼ a1 cos þ a2 cos 2x; with
the amplitude a1 of the “fundamental” much larger than the amplitude a2 of the
“overtone.” By the eighteenth century, workers in analysis, the branch of math-
ematics beginning with calculus, were dealing with inﬁnite trigonometric series:
y ¼ a1 cos x þ b1 sin x
ð
Þ þ a2 cos 2x þ b2 sin 2x
ð
Þ þ a3 cos 3x þ b3 sin 3x
ð
Þ þ . . .
The “vibrating string controversy” engaging Leonhard Euler and others con-
cerned how wide a class of functions can be represented in this form. The dispute
exposed, beyond endemic deﬁciencies of rigor in the treatment of inﬁnite series,
lack of a common understanding about what is meant by a function. The ensuing
nineteenth-century rigorization of analysis, besides banning any literal inﬁnities
or inﬁnitesimals, explaining contexts containing the symbol ∞without assuming
it to denote anything in isolation, ﬁxed on the maximally general notion of
function, under which any correlation between inputs and outputs counts, as
long as there is one and only one output per input. Improved rigor eventually led
to consensus about the existence of trigonometric series representations.
But with existence there come uniqueness questions. Could a function have
two different representations? Does the constant function zero have any other
than the trivial one with an ¼ bn ¼ 0 for all n? Bernhard Riemann showed it
does not if the sequence converges for all x. But what if one allows an
exceptional point for which convergence is not assumed? Enter Cantor. It
turns out that even then triviality holds (and, as a conclusion, we get what we
did not assume as a premise, convergence even at the exceptional point).
Indeed, one can allow two or any ﬁnite number of exceptional points. One
can even allow inﬁnitely many as long as they are all isolated from one another,

meaning that for each exceptional x there is a positive ε with no other excep-
tional points between x  ε and x þ ε. One can even allow a doubly exceptional
point, not isolated from other exceptional points. Indeed, one can allow two or
any ﬁnite number. One can even allow inﬁnitely many as long as they are
isolated from one another. One can even allow a triply exceptional point. And so
on. And as one goes on, it becomes natural to switch from speaking in the plural
of the exceptional points to speaking in the singular of the set E of which they
are elements. What it means to treat E as a single item is to think of operations
being applicable to it. The relevant operation on sets Cantor called derivation,
discarding isolated points. Let E0 be E itself, and let Enþ1 be the derived set of
En. Reimann’s result was that uniqueness holds if E0 ¼ ∅, the empty set, with
no elements. Cantor’s results were that uniqueness holds if any of
E1; E2; E3; . . . is empty. Moreover, if we let Eω be the intersection of the En,
the set of x belonging to all of them, uniqueness still holds if Eω ¼ ∅.
Moreover, the results continue, with sets indexed by:
ω þ 1; ω þ 2; ω þ 3; . . . ω þ ω ¼ ω  2; ω  3; ω  4; . . . ω  ω ¼ ω2; ω3; ω4; . . . ωω
and more. Here are Cantor’s transﬁnite ordinal numbers, and, as the notation
suggests, he introduced an arithmetic for them, with addition, multiplication,
and exponentiation.
1.2 Quadrature to Cardinals
Euclid shows many geometrical ﬁgures can be constructed with straightedge
and compass, indicating the steps involved and proving they lead to the desired
result. Thus one can duplicate the square, or construct, given the side of a
square, the side of a square of twice the area, just by taking the diagonal of the
original square. To show a construction not possible is more difﬁcult, and
requires an analysis available only with the modern coordinate methods,
which transform geometric into algebraic problems. Thus duplicating the
cube, constructing, given the side of a cube, the side of a cube of twice the
volume, turns out equivalent to obtaining a key number,
ﬃﬃﬃ

3p
, from rational
numbers by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of
square roots. And this was proved impossible in the 1830s, disposing of an
ancient problem. For quadrature of the circle, constructing for a given circle a
square of equal area, the key number is π. Now, although
ﬃﬃﬃ

is not obtainable in
the way indicated, it is at least an algebraic number in the sense of a solution to a
polynomial equation:

with rational coefﬁcients ai, namely, x3–2 ¼ 0. It was conjectured, however,
that π is not even algebraic in this sense. Joseph Liouville showed nonalgebraic
or transcendental numbers exist. Then e, the basis of the natural logarithms, was
shown to be one by Charles Hermite, and, ﬁnally, π by Ferdinand von
Lindemann. Between these last two, Cantor showed that the vast majority of
real numbers are transcendental.
Since the sets of algebraics and transcendentals are inﬁnite, to say one has
more elements than the other requires a deﬁnition of when the transﬁnite
cardinal, or number of elements of one inﬁnite set, A, is equal or unequal to
that of another, B. Cantor took as his standard of equality the existence of a
bijection between A and B, a relation under which each element of A is
associated with exactly one element of B, and vice versa. In the case of the set
N of natural numbers, the existence of a bijection with a set B means that the
elements of B can be enumerated or listed in a sequence indexed by 0, 1, 2, . . .,
as in Table 1. An inﬁnite set whose elements can be so enumerated is called
denumerable, while a set that is either denumerable or ﬁnite is called countable.
The number of elements of a denumerable set Cantor called ℵ0 (pronounced
“aleph nought”). What the table shows is that signed integers and positive
rationals both have cardinal or size ℵ0; so do the signed rationals. Nowadays,
a ﬁnite sequence of keystrokes is transmitted electronically as a sequence of
zeros and ones, the binary numeral for some natural number that may be
considered a code for the sequence. This makes the set of such sequences
denumerable, in order of increasing code number. Then, since a polynomial
equation of degree n has at most n solutions, each algebraic number can be
denoted by an expression such as “the second smallest solution to
2x3  9x2  6x þ 3 ¼ 0” and given a code number accordingly. But their
denumerability was established in correspondence between Dedekind and
Cantor long before the digital age began.
By contrast, Cantor showed that the whole set R of real numbers (and hence
the set of transcendentals, left over when we remove the algebraics) is not
denumerable. No countable set can contain even just those whose decimal

expansion involves only 0s and 1s; or what is the same, all inﬁnite zero-one
sequences; or what is the same, all sets of natural numbers, each such being
representable by the zero-one sequence with one in the nth place if and only if n
is in the set. This he established by his famous diagonal argument. Suppose we
have an enumeration of some set S of inﬁnite zero-one sequences, as in Table 2.
Go down the diagonal, marked with asterisks. Take in order for each n the digit
appearing in the nth place in the nth row of the table. This gives 0100 . . . . Now
swap the zeros and the ones. This gives 1011 . . ., a sequence that does not
belong to the denumerable set S, since it differs in the nth place from the nth
sequence. Cantor called the cardinal of the real numbers or points of the line c.
Analogously to the results in Table 1 in this discussion, he showed that the
positive real numbers, or even just those in a ﬁnite interval, also have cardinal c,
as do pairs of real numbers, or equivalently complex numbers. He also intro-
duced an arithmetic, with addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, for his
cardinals.
Cantor’s audacious introduction of ω and ℵwhen mathematicians had just
ﬁnished explaining away ∞provoked a reaction. But Cantor’s theory won
acceptance among leaders in the rising generation fairly quickly (as examples
they put forth, such as the one-, two-, and three-dimensional Cantor set,
Sierpinski carpet, and Menger sponge, whose images appear all over the
Internet today, captured the imagination of amateurs). The leading mathemat-
ician David Hilbert insisted: “No one shall expel us from the paradise Cantor
created for us.”
2 The Notion of Set
Many objections turned on certain paradoxes. Cantor, unlike his contemporary
Gottlob Frege, never made the assumptions that led to these paradoxes, but he
did not make clear enough what assumptions he was making. His successors
had to be more clear and explicit. Explicit axiomatization began in the ﬁrst
decade of the twentieth century with Ernst Zermelo (1908/1967). His system,

with additions and amendments, mainly by Abraham Fraenkel (1922/1967),
remains that accepted today, when it is recognized that the paradoxes result
mostly from confusing the notion of set behind the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel
set theory with Choice (ZFC) with other ideas.
2.1 Collections
The expression “a multiplicity of objects” begins singular but ends plural, and
may be understood as referring either to a plurality, a many, or to a universal, a
one as opposed to a many. Universals include properties, which are intensional,
meaning that two may be different even while having exactly the same
instances, as with the stock example being a coin in my pocket and being a
penny in my pocket, which are distinct properties even if I have no coins in my
pocket but pennies. They also include aggregates completely determined by
their components. One kind, topic of a theory called mereology, is a fusion of a
plurality of component parts into a single whole, in a way that permits different
pluralities to have the same fusion, as do the eight ranks and the eight ﬁles of a
chessboard, the fusion being the selfsame chessboard in either case. By contrast
we have collections, in which many are gathered into a one without losing track
of which many they were.
The notion of collection in Frege (1893) was that of an extension. Here we
start with all objects, and take what he called a concept (associated with a
predicate), and divide objects into those that fall under the concept (satisfy the
predicate) and those that do not. The collection of those that do is the extension
of the concept, so that the extensions of two concepts are the same if and only if
the concepts are coextensive, having exactly the same things falling under them.
Graphically, we may represent the unbounded range of all objects with which
we start as an unbounded blank page, and represent the extension as given by a
dividing line or curve separating objects inside from objects outside, as in
Figure 1. But for Frege, the extension is itself an object: If represented by a
dot, that dot must fall on the page on one side or the other of the division – but
which? That is the question indicated by the question marks in the ﬁgure.
Bertrand Russell raised an embarrassing issue about the extension R of the
concept: it is an extension that as an object is outside, not inside, itself. In the
case of the universal extension, V, the extension of is self-identical, V is inside
itself since everything is inside V. In the case of the empty extension ∅, the
extension of nonself-identical, ∅is outside itself since nothing is inside ∅.
Hence ∅is inside, and V is outside, the Russell extension R. But just as the
statement this very statement is false seems to be true if it is false and false if it is

true, so R seems to be inside itself if outside itself, and outside if inside. This is
the Russell paradox as Russell (1902) put it to Frege.
Contrasting with this inconsistent “top down” notion of extension is the
“bottom up” notion of an ensemble. Here we start with a given “universe of
discourse,” which might be represented by a box, and a predicate will, like a curve
in a Venn diagram, mark off the ensemble of things in the universe that do satisfy
it from things in the universe that do not. The ensemble does not, however, itself
belong to the universe. A dot representing it would lie outside the box, as in
Figure 2. Implicit here is the possibility of iteration. We can add a new box atop
the original, to accommodate all the dots representing ensembles of things in the
lower box, and then more. But there are two ways to implement this idea.
On the layered approach of the theory of types, deriving from Russell (1908)
by way of Frank Ramsey (1925), we have a hierarchy with individuals at the
bottom type zero, collections called classes of type zero items at type one,
classes of type one items at type two, and so on. Even if we assume no items at
type zero, there will be one item at type one, the empty class ∅1 of type zero
items, and then two items at type two, the empty class ∅2 of type one items, and
the singleton class
∅1g2

of the one item at type one. At type three, there will
be four items, as in Table 3. With one item at type zero, there will be two at type

one, then four, then sixteen. But with only ﬁnitely many individuals, there will
only ever be only ﬁnitely many items of any one type. For mathematical
purposes, Russell assumed inﬁnitely many individuals.
2.2 Sets
By contrast, we have the cumulative approach, where successive boxes are
nested, like Chinese boxes or Russian dolls, each higher one adding a new level
of collections called sets. In box zero are individuals or Urelemente; at level
one, sets whose elements are individuals; in box one, individuals and level-one
sets; at level two, any new sets whose elements come from box one; in box two,
box-one and level-two items; and so on.
In ZFC, we consider only pure sets, without individuals. There then will be
no items at level zero, one item, the empty set ∅, at level one, in box one. As for
level two, from the one item in box one can be formed two sets: the empty set ∅
and its singleton
∅g
f
, but the former we already have, so only the latter is new.
In box three will be four items, two new at level three. In box four will be sixteen
items, twelve new at level four. And so on, as in Table 4.
After all ﬁnite levels, we may recognize a box ω containing everything of
ﬁnite level but nothing new, and then form a level ω þ 1 for sets whose elements
come from level ω, meaning from any ﬁnite level, but do not themselves appear
at any such level, containing as they do sets of arbitrarily high ﬁnite level. We
can then continue through the transﬁnite ordinals. Zermelo at ﬁrst claimed for
his axioms only that they permitted none of the known deductions of contradic-
tions, and seemed adequate to develop Cantor’s set theory (as they are with
Fraenkel’s friendly amendments). Only later (as in Zermelo, 1930) did some-
thing like the picture in the table emerge.
The ideal of rigor is that one should list in advance all primitives, notions
assumed meaningful without deﬁnition, and postulates or axioms, results
assumed true without demonstration, and given these principles all further

notions or results should be logically derived, by deﬁnition or deduction. In set
theory, there is just one primitive, written with a stylized epsilon symbol, x 2 y,
read “x is an element of y” or “x is in y” or “y contains x.” All other notions must
be deﬁned in terms of this and the logical notion of identity using the logical
operators in Table 5. A formula Φ is built up from atomic formulas x 2 y and
x ¼ y using the ﬁve operations in the table.
Some minimal familiarity with logical notions and notations must be
assumed here (for a quick review, see Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey, 2002,
chapters 9 and 10), including an ability to recognize simple logical laws. In
particular, familiarity is assumed with the distinction between “free” and
“bound” occurrences of variables in a formula, those that are not and those
that are caught by a quantiﬁer. For example, in the formula asserting the non-
emptiness of x, namely ∃yðy 2 xÞ, the x is free but the y is bound. The latter could
be changed to z without changing the meaning. Other logical and set-theoretic
notions may be deﬁned in terms of what we have so far, as in Tables 6 and 7, but
ofﬁcially these are mere abbreviations.

3 The Zermelo–Fraenkel Axioms
The axioms of the system ZFC will be presented next, in both words and
symbols, to be assumed without proof, but not without something in the way
of informal, intuitive justiﬁcation.
3.1 Statement
The ﬁrst axiom says sets with the same elements are the same. It has two
equivalent formulations:
Extensionality ð1Þ 8zðz 2 x ≡z 2 yÞ  x ¼ y; ð2Þ x ⊆y ∧y ⊆x x ¼ y:
By convention, in displaying formulas initial universal quantiﬁers are omitted,
so what is meant is really 8x8y(
) where what is explicitly written is
. As (2)
suggests, proofs of identities most often come in two parts, proving inclusion in
two directions. Extensionality implies that if there is a set y whose elements are
all and only the sets x satisfying a condition Φ, it is unique. That unique set, if it
exists, is denoted xj ΦðxÞg
f
, and we have z 2 xj ΦðxÞg
f
if Φ(z). Frege’s incon-
sistent assumption would be an axiom of comprehension, according to which

always exists for any condition Φ. Applied to the condition x =2 x this
would give the Russell paradox, and it is not assumed in ZFC.

This is not a single formula, but rather a rule to the effect that anything of a
certain form counts as an axiom. The cases for different Φ are called instances of
the scheme of separation. (Zermelo’s original formulation was vaguer.) Note
that separation implies there is no universal set of all sets V ¼ xj x ¼ xg
f
. If
there were, we could, by separation, obtain comprehension.
Further axioms state the existence of certain speciﬁc sets:
Pairing
∃y ðu 2 y ∧v 2 yÞ:
Union
∃y 8z 2 X 8x 2 zðx 2 yÞ:
With what we have so far, some basic existence results then become deducible,
those in Table 8. (The expression “family” used in the table may be used for any
set of sets.)
Separation gives us the empty set, since given any set u at all – and even
pure logic assumes there is at least one item in the domain our quantiﬁers
range over, which in the present case consists of sets – separation gives
x 2 ujx =2 ug
f
, which is empty. It also gives twofold intersections, and by the
alternative deﬁnition, family intersections, if the family X has at least one
member u; also differences. Now given y containing u and v, we can separate
out the elements of y identical to one of those two, so pairing with separation
gives the unordered pair. Union with separation gives us family union. The
unordered triple and twofold union we then get using the alternative deﬁnitions.
The difference u  v is also called the relative complement of v in u. An
absolute complement v ¼ xj x =2 vg
f
cannot exist, because v ∪ v would be
the nonexistent V.

and so on, and hence is inﬁnite; alternative formulations are possible;
more detailed discussion is postponed.
Also postponed is detailed discussion, beyond its mere statement, of the
widely known axiom of choice (AC), pictured in Figure 3.
Sets whose intersection is nonempty are said to meet or overlap; those whose
intersection is empty are called disjoint, and a family any two members of which
are disjoint is called pairwise disjoint, a family of nonempty, pairwise disjoint sets
is called a partition (of its union), and the members of the family the cells thereof.
Axiom of choice asserts that for any partition there is a selector, a set containing
exactly one element from each cell (represented in the ﬁgure by the scattered
dots). Alone of the axioms, AC asserts the existence of a set satisfying a certain
condition, without given a deﬁnition of such a set as xjΦ x

conjectures, besides being a source of conﬁdence in the consistency of an
axiom system, beyond the mere inductive consideration that no contradiction
has been found so far. For such reasons, interest attaches to the relationship
between the axioms of ZFC (beyond extensionality) and the cumulative
hierarchy picture.
For separation, the nonexistence of a universal set V is clear, since the
elements of a set that at a given level come from lower levels. By contrast, if
a set x appears at a given level, then its elements all appear at lower levels,
including such of them as satisfy some condition Φ, and hence the set of all such
will appear at a level no higher than that of x itself.
For pairing, if u appears at some level and v at some level, one of these levels
will have to be no earlier than the other, and both u and v will be present at that
level, and so u; vg
f
should appear at the very next. For union, if X appears at
some level, every element appears at some earlier level and every element of
such an element at some still earlier, so all elements of elements will be present
at levels below that of X, and the set ∪X present by the same level as X. For
power, if u appears at some level, then we have seen all its subsets are present by
that level, and so PðuÞ should appear at the very next. For inﬁnity, it asserts no
more than the existence of such a set as we see at level ω þ 1 in Table 4 in
Section 2.2.
For choice, if a partition X occurs at some level, it is easily seen any selector
for it will appear by that same level. But is there any selector? The assumption
that the hierarchy is maximally “wide,” admitting at a given level all sets that
could conceivably be formed from elements at lower levels, means that we
should not be imposing any requirement of deﬁnability as a precondition for set
existence. Historically, objections to AC have generally rested on implicit
imposition of some such precondition, so the cumulative hierarchy picture
excludes the major antichoice argument. But that is not quite to say that it
provides a substantive prochoice argument, and the axiom remains, to a degree,
controversial. Although it is no longer common for working mathematicians to
star theorems whose proof depends on AC, set theorists keep track.
For replacement, many feel the understanding that the cumulative hierarchy
is supposed to be maximally “high,” admitting all levels that could conceivably
be admitted, supports the axiom. But here the inﬂuence may be felt of what
some would claim is a further thought, a doctrine of limitation of size, according
to which all that can prevent a plurality of sets from being collected together into
a set would be there being too many of them. (Cantor distinguished the
inconsistent multiplicities that cannot be collected into a whole from the
consistent ones that can by the formers’ being absolutely inﬁnite where
the latter are only transﬁnite.) The idea would be that in

would not be too many elements to form a set, since there would be no more
than there are in u, which already is a set. See Boolos (1971) for critical
discussion.
There remains an axiom not always counted as part of ZFC – and, in
particular, not so counted in at least one widely used introductory textbook –
although so counted here. It has two equivalent formulations.
Foundation ð1Þ 8xðx 6¼ ∅ ∃y x 8 z x ðz =2 yÞÞ;
ð2Þ 8xðx 6¼ ∅ ∃y 2 x ðy ∩x ¼ ∅ÞÞ:
In words, if x has any elements at all, then it has an element y that is epsilon
minimal, meaning that there is no other element z with z 2 y. The axiom, which
also goes by the alias regularity, is directly suggested by the cumulative
hierarchy picture: If x has any elements, it must have an element y of lowest
possible level for an element of x, and such a y will be epsilon minimal. Some
immediate consequences:
There is no set x with x 2 x.
There are no sets x, y with x 2 y 2 x.
There are no sets x, y, z with x 2 y 2 z 2 x.
Why not? Because xg
f
or x; yg
f
or x; y; zg
f
, as the case may be, would have
no epsilon-minimal element. The axiom also excludes the existence of any
inﬁnite descending chain with x12 x0 and x2 2 x1 and x3 2 x2 and so on.
Alongside orthodox set theory ZFC, there exist heterodox “alternative” set
theories. Incurvati (2020) surveys several, including two that permit inﬁnite
descending sequences: a “graph” conception due to Peter Aczel and a “stratiﬁed”
conception due to W. V. Quine. (He also considers a “paraconsistent” conception
that accepts comprehension and the Russell paradox, but adopts a deviant logic in
hopes of quarantining the contradiction.) See also Holmes (2017).
4 Immediate Consequences
Some consequences of the axioms were established well before set theory
became a separate subject.
4.1 The Algebra of Sets
An important step toward modern logic was taken by George Boole, whose
Laws of Thought (1854) contains formulas in algebraic symbolism each admit-
ting two readings: as a principle of logic and as what we recognize retrospect-
ively as a one of set theory. Thus the formula a  b ¼ b  a expresses both
the logical law of the commutativity of conjunction, Φ ∧Ψ iff Ψ ∧Φ, and

the set-theoretic law of the commutativity of intersection, x ∩y ¼ y ∩x.
Suppose we are working for a time only with subsets of some given set I, and
allow ourselves to write –x for I  x. Then the ﬁrst batch of theorems of ZFC
consists of equations of so-called Boolean algebra for ∩and ∪and –. The
proof of such an equation consists in applying extensionality after showing that
any item will belong to the right side if it belongs to the left side; and the proof of
that consists in unpacking the deﬁnitions and applying a law of logic, the very
law that in Boole’s notation would be expressed by the same algebraical formula
as the set-theoretic result we are trying to prove, thus:
z 2 x ∩y iff z 2 x ∧z 2 y iff z 2 y ∧z 2 x iff z 2 y ∩x:
Any number of further laws of the algebra of sets are found in Table 9, in pairs
of “dual” laws on the same row. Another, not in the table, is the law   x ¼ x;
corresponding to the law of double negation: :: Φ iff Φ.
Further laws involving inclusion appear in Table 10. Many of these laws may be
familiar from school, where they might have been illustrated by Venn diagrams.
Even an introductory textbook of set theory, although it might run to hundreds of
pages, would leave the veriﬁcation of most as “exercises for the reader” – with the
good excuse that, in any case, one can only really learn a mathematical subject by
doing exercises – and in this much shorter Element, where the aim must be less to
train the reader in than to inform the reader about a technical subject, they will all be
so left. (The proofs do not all have to be proceed “elementwise,” as in the
commutative law example. Once one has accumulated a few laws, others can be
derived from them “algebraically,” without going back to the deﬁnitions.)
4.2 The Algebra of Relations
Boole’s logic covers a bit more than Aristotelian syllogistic, being a version of
the modern logic of one-place predicates. It is still not enough to analyze
serious mathematical arguments, which generally involve two-place predi-
cates (such as 2). The logic of many-place predicates in present-day textbooks
derives from Frege (1879) conceptually, and Giuseppe Peano and others
notationally, but even before them, there were attempts to develop predicate
logic in Boole’s algebraic style.
To incorporate relation theory into set theory we must identify relations with
sets of some kind. The ﬁrst step is to ignore the distinction between a relation R
such as parent of and what is sometimes called the “graph” of the relation, the
set of ordered pairs (a, b) with a a parent of b. We write Rab or aRb or (a, b) 2 R
indifferently. The second step is to identify an ordered pair (a, b) with a set of
some kind, most commonly using the Wiener–Kuratowski deﬁnition:

It would be idle to pretend this reveals what ordered pairs have been all along.
It is an attempt to deﬁne something with all the features of ordered pairs needed
for mathematics, without going beyond set theory. Its acceptability depends on
prior analysis of just what is needed for mathematics. The consensus is that the
existence for every a and b of a unique ordered pair (a, b), together with the
following fundamental law of pairs, will do:
Fundamental Law of Pairs a; b
ð
Þ ¼ c; d
ð
Þ iff a ¼ b ∧c ¼ d:
Given the Wiener–Kuratowski deﬁnition, the existence of the ordered pair
follows by three applications of pairing to get {a} and {a, b} and then (a, b).
The proof of the fundamental law will be left as an exercise. One also needs, for
any A and B, the existence of the Cartesian product:
A ⊗B ¼ ða; bÞja 2 A ∧b 2 B

g ¼ fxj ∃a 2 A∃b 2 Bðx ¼ a; b

There are two interestingly different proofs. The ﬁrst begins by noting
that we have already the existence of the union of A and B, of the power
set of that union, and of the power set of the power set; while also each of
ag
f
and
a; bg
f
is a subset of the union and hence (a, b) deﬁned the
Wiener–Kuratowski way is a subset of its power set. Separation then

There is a host of deﬁnitions that can now be made, some assembled in Table
11. (It is traditional to illustrate some of them by kinship relations. Thus the
inverse of parent of is child of and the composition of sister of and parent of is
aunt of.) Note that in the table the a and the b in dom R and ran R will
automatically belong to ∪∪R under the Wiener–Kuratowski deﬁnition, so
domain and range exist by separation. We leave the existence question in the
other cases to the reader. There are other terms in use: the inverse of R is
alternatively called the converse, while R1½D is called the preimage of D, and
dom R ∪ran R the ﬁeld of R.
Students of mathematics encounter these deﬁnitions gradually in the course
of studying this or that branch of mathematics, rather than in a bloc in a separate
course on set theory. Readers encountering the lot all at once may think of
learning them as like learning vocabulary in a foreign language, and try to
absorb a few each day.
These notions are connected by an endless list of little laws, such as
R½C ¼ ran RjC; that follow at once from the deﬁnitions. Such laws occupy
page after weary page in the ﬁrst volume of Whitehead and Russell’s monu-
mental Principia Mathematica (1910). A few are usually singled out for special
mention:
ðR ° SÞ1 ¼ S1
° R1
ðR ° SÞ ° T ¼ R ° ðS ° TÞ:
R½C ∪D ¼ R½C ∪R½D

for all a, b, c in the ﬁeld of the relation). Ofﬁcially, a relation is a set of ordered
pairs, so since there is no set of all pairs (x, y) such that x 2 y  the assumption
that there is can without much difﬁculty be shown to imply the existence of a
universal set – elementhood is not a relation in the ofﬁcial sense; neither is
inclusion ⊆. We can still call them relationships, and apply the terminology in
the table. (There is a variant NBG of ZFC in which they are treated more
formally as “classes,” collections assumed over and above sets.) Thus inclusion
is reﬂexive, elementhood irreﬂexive.
4.3 Functions, Orders, Equivalences
For future reference, deﬁnitions will be collected now pertaining to three kinds
of relation ubiquitous in mathematics. This material, admittedly a bit dry until
we are ready to take up substantive examples, may be skimmed and referred
back to as needed later. A function is a relation R such that for any a in dom R
there is a unique b in ran R with aRb. Often one uses lowercase letters f, g for
functions. The unique b with afb is called the value or output for argument or
input a, and denoted f(a). If, additionally, for any b in the range there is exactly
one a in the domain with f ðaÞ ¼ b; the function f is called injective. The notation
f: A →B indicates that f is a function with dom f ¼ A and ran f ⊆B. If ran
f ¼ B, then the function is called surjective with respect to B, while bijective
means both injective and surjective, and a function that is in- or sur- or bijective
is called an in- or sur- or bijection. (Older terminology was “one-to-one” and
“onto” and “correspondence.”) In certain contexts, it proves convenient to write
the values of a function X with dom X ¼ I not as XðiÞ but as Xi. With this
notation, we write the range as
Xij i 2 Ig
f
and call it an indexed family with
index set I. The DeMorgan and distributive laws of Table 9 in Section 4.2,
among others, generalize to indexed families:

A two-place function is simply a function whose arguments are ordered pairs,
but we write f a; b
ð
Þ rather than f ð a; b
ð
ÞÞ for simplicity. Note that, ofﬁcially, a
function is a set of ordered pairs, so we cannot call intersection and union two-
place functions. We call them operations, and apply the same terminology of
“associative” and “commutative” and so on to them as to two-place functions.
It is easily seen that identity on a set A; i ¼
a; a
ð
Þja 2 Ag
f
is a function; also
that the inverse f 1 of a function f is a function if f is an injection. Also, the
composition f ∘g for functions f and g is a function if ran f ⊆dom g. A good
exercise is to verify that the identity function is a bijection, that the inverse of a
bijection is a bijection, and that the composition of two bijections is a bijection.
Then if we deﬁne two sets to be equipollent or equinumerous if there is a
bijection between them, as Cantor did, it follows that equipollence or equinu-
merosity is a reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive relationship.
Notice that under the deﬁnitions used so far, beginning from what is the most

tions, we get for functions that

order of f and g get switched. The more usual approach in mainstream mathem-
atics, which rather seldom considers composition of relations other than func-
tions, modiﬁes the deﬁnition so as to get the result g ∘f
ð
Þ a
ð Þ ¼ gð f a
ð ÞÞ.
A partial order is a relation that is reﬂexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
Often we write ≤or a similar symbol for a partial order, and then use related
notations in more or less obvious senses:
x ≤y ≤z iff x ≤y and y ≤z
x ≥y iff y ≤x
x < y iff x ≤y but x 6¼ y:
A minimal element x of a set X is one such that for no y in X is y < x. A
minimum or least is one such that for all y in X we have x ≤y. The terms maximal
and maximum or greatest are used analogously. The minimal versus minimum
distinction collapses, allowing both to be abbreviated min, for connected partial
orders, called total or linear orders or simply orders. A chain in a partial order is
a subset C of its ﬁeld connected by ≤. A wellorder is one in which every
nonempty subset of the ﬁeld has a least element. A set is wellorderable if there
exists some wellorder on it (in which case, there will also exist others).
Sometimes, it is more convenient to start with the notion of a strict order <, a
relation that is irreﬂexive, transitive, and connected, and think of ≤as deﬁned in
terms of <.

In modern mathematics, a structure A is a nonempty set A 6¼ ∅
equipped with extra apparatus, which in the only case of interest here will be
simply a two-place relation R ⊆A ⊗A: A function f: A →B is an isomorphism
between structures A ¼ A; R
ð
Þ and B ¼ B; S
ð
Þ if it is a bijection and further
preserves the relevant relation, meaning that if f ðaÞ ¼ b and f ðcÞ ¼ d, then
aRc iff bSd. In the case of sets with orders A, B, since the sets A, B are
simply the ﬁelds of the relation R, S, for ordinary purposes one hardly
distinguishes between the structures and their relations, speaking of struc-
tures as orders and of isomorphism between relations. B = (B, S) is a
substructure of A = (A, R) iff B ⊆A and S is the restriction R ∩B ⊗B
ð
Þ of
R to B. When the set A is a family of subsets of some set I, so A ⊆PðIÞ, we will
write X 2 A when we really mean (A, R) where R is the restriction of inclusion to
A, the set of pairs (X, Y) with ðA; ⊆Þ and Y 2 A and X ⊆Y. ðA; 2 Þ is understood
similarly. For example, ðPðIÞ; ⊆Þ is a partial order with minimum Ø, and its
substructure ðPðIÞ; ⊆Þ, where PðIÞ ¼ PðIÞ 
∅g;
f
the family of non-
empty subsets of I, is a partial order in which every singleton ag
f
is minimal,
but there is no minimum. If f : I →J is a bijection, then there is an “induced”
isomorphism F between ðPðIÞ; ⊆Þ; and ðPðJÞ; ⊆Þ given by FðAÞ ¼ f ½A:
A good exercise is to check that the identity function is an isomorphism, that
the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, and that the composition of
two isomorphisms is an isomorphism. Then if we call structures isomorphic
when there exists an isomorphism between them, it will follow that “isomorph-
ism” in the sense of “being isomorphic” is a reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive
relationship.
An equivalence relation is one that is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transi-
tive. We often write E or some equals-sign-like symbol for an equivalence.
The term is also applied to relationships, including equinumerosity ≈and
isomorphism ﬃ. Given a function f with domain A the relation aEb that
holds if f ðaÞ ¼ f ðbÞ is an equivalence. So if X is a partition of I, then
considering f(a) = the unique cell [a] of X to which a belongs, we see that
belonging to the same cell is an equivalence on I. Inversely, if we
start with an equivalence E on I and let ½a ¼ b : aEbg;
f
the family X of
all [a] is a partition of I. (To see that the [a] are nonempty and that
∪X ¼ I; use the reﬂexivity of E to conclude a 2 ½a: Symmetry and transi-
tivity can be used to show that for all a and b, if aEb then ½a ¼ ½b; while if
:aEb then ½a ∩½b ¼ ∅:) Equivalence and partition are twins. The cell [a]
is traditionally called the “equivalence class” of a. All the foregoing notions
can be further exempliﬁed once we have the traditional number systems
available.

5 Number Systems Within Set Theory
A history of modern mathematics in about 300 words: It began building on a
heritage summed up in two writers. Euclid’s Elements presented the ideal of
rigor and its partial realization in geometry. Al-Khwarizmi (whose name gives
us our word algorithm) in his al-Jabr w’al-Muqabala (whose title gives us our
word algebra) transmitted solutions of linear and quadratic equations. The ﬁrst
modern contributions began with the solution to cubic equations, where already
we see a key modern feature, solving problems in one mathematical realm by
bringing in another: Real roots of cubics are found by introducing “imagin-
aries.” Then followed the development of an efﬁcient algebraic notation, and
the coordinate methods of analytic geometry, leading to algebraic solutions to
geometric problems – at the cost of compromising the rigor of pure geometry.
The analytic approach to ancient problems of tangency and quadrature led to the
calculus and its notions of derivative and integral, which take us back and forth
between a quantity varying with time and its rate of change, and provide
apparatus for physics – at the cost of difﬁculties over inﬁnities. The introduction
of ever-new structures (non-Euclidean geometries, noncommutative algebras)
continued apace in the nineteenth century, when rigor began to be ﬁrmed up.
The interaction of different branches of mathematics meant a need for not just
rigorous treatments of various branches separately, but a uniﬁed system, and
one ﬂexible enough to accommodate an endlessly growing array of novelties.
The kind of framework needed was eventually provided by ZFC, and the
reconstruction of mathematics on a set-theoretic basis became the theme of a
French group writing a vast encyclopedia under the pseudonym Bourbaki,
beginning with “his” (1939). The most important devices used can be seen at
work already in the set-theoretic construction of the higher number systems
(integral, rational, real, complex) out of the natural numbers, themselves
explained set theoretically. This reconstruction is all that can be discussed
here, and even it only in outline.
5.1 Real to Complex
Reconstruction of the traditional number systems proceeded in the reverse of the
historical order of their introduction, in ﬁve steps, explaining a higher system in
terms of a lower one taken for granted: (i) the complexes C in terms of the reals,
(ii) the reals R in terms of the rationals, (iii) the rationals Q in terms of the
integers, (iv) the integers Z in terms of the naturals, and (v) the naturals N in terms
of set theory. Here (i), (ii), and (v) will be sketched, (iii) and (iv), being much like
(i), and nowadays covered alongside it in textbooks of abstract algebra, as (ii) is in

textbooks of analysis. For more detail, this material was ﬁrst made available in
one place to undergraduates in Landau (1930), which remains highly readable.
At no stage was a new rigorous deﬁnition of a number system put forward as
an account of what the numbers in question had really been all along, faithful to
the ideas – in fact, often hazy – of the ﬁrst to study it. As regards step (v) this fact
is emphasized in the philosophical classic Benacerraf (1965), but it holds
generally. The search was for a surrogate system with all the properties trad-
itionally assumed that are important for mathematics. Such a project presup-
poses consensus about what the mathematically important properties are. They
are perhaps most easily identiﬁed in the case of the complex numbers. Each is a
sum a þ bi of a real a and a real multiple b of the “imaginary” unit i, and they are
added and multiplied according to the following rules:
a þ bi
ð
Þ þ c þ di
ð
Þ ¼ a þ c
ð
Þ þ b þ d
ð
Þi
a þ bi
ð
Þ  c þ di
ð
Þ ¼ a  c – b  d
ð
Þ þ a  d þ b  c
ð
Þi:
That is all. In the case of the reals and naturals, the needed identiﬁcation of
mathematically important properties is due mainly to Dedekind: for the reals in
Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen, for the naturals in Was sind und was sollen die
Zahlen?, available together in English as Dedekind (1901).
In the complex or ‘imaginary’ case, around 1800 several workers independ-
ently came up with a geometric interpretation of complex numbers as points in
the plane, still taught in schools. The great C. F. Gauss remarked that if instead
of positive, negative, and imaginary one had spoken of forwards, backwards,
and sideways, there would never have even seemed to be any mystery. In
coordinate geometry, a plane point is represented by a pair of reals, and so
one can simply identify a þ bi with ða; bÞ and stipulate the desired arithmetic
rules:
a; b
ð
Þ þ c; d
ð
Þ ¼ a þ c; b þ d
ð
Þ a; b
ð
Þ  c; d
ð
Þ ¼ a  c – b  d; a  d þ b  c
ð
Þ:
It is a tedious but routine exercise to derive the usual commutative, associa-
tive, and distributive laws for the complexes from these deﬁnitions and the same
laws for the reals.
Generalization motivates rigorization: The introduction of unfamiliar struc-
tures, where the reliability becomes doubtful of intuitions developed from work
with more familiar ones, was one reason for closer attention to rigor. Inversely,
rigorization often opened up the prospect of innovations. If pairs can be added
and multiplied, what about triples or quadruples, or whatever? W. R. Hamilton
found that there is no reasonable multiplication rule for triples, but that there is
one for quadruples, and thus he arrived at the quaternions expounded in

Hamilton (1853). Once a construction has given us the mathematically import-
ant properties, mathematicians might as well forget about it, except that they
may want to come back to it when seeking to do something analogous
elsewhere.
5.2 Rational to Real
Rigorous Greek mathematics recognized no zero and no negative numbers, and
not even positive real numbers, but only ratios of geometric magnitudes such as
line segments. Neither did it recognize even positive rational numbers, but only
ratios of positive natural numbers, with ratios themselves scarcely considered
independently of questions of proportionality or equality of ratios, the ﬁrst is to
the second as the third is to the fourth. Taking proportionality for natural
numbers to be understood, proportionality for line segments can be made
sense of whenever a ratio of segments A:B can be equated with a ratio of natural
numbers m:n. This can be done when dividing B into n equal pieces and laying
off m of them along A, they exactly ﬁll it. If they fall short or go beyond, A:B is
greater or less, as the case may be, than m:n. What is often anachronistically
described as the Greek discovery that
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
is irrational was actually the discovery
that the ratio of diagonal to side in a square is not the same as any ratio of natural
numbers. How, then, can proportionality for segments in general be deﬁned?
The solution of Eudoxos, found in Euclid, Book V, in effect declares A : B equal
to C : D if for every m and n, if either of the two segmentratios is greater than m:
n, then so is the other. For us, for whom ratios of natural numbers are rational
numbers and ratios of line segments are real numbers, this says that a real
number is completely determined by the set of rational numbers less than it.
Early modern mathematics had an account of what (signed) real numbers are:
ratios of lengths of (directed) line segments. Certain Euclidean straightedge and
compass constructions can be interpreted as adding and multiplying ratios,
making them numbers in the sense of things one can add and multiply. And
the usual commutative, associative, and distributive laws can be deduced well-
known geometric theorems. This is the standpoint explicit in Isaac Newton’s
Universal Arithmetic and implicit in René Descartes’ Geometry, and it seems to
go back to at least Omar Khayyam. By the nineteenth century, especially after
the advent of non-Euclidean geometries, it came to seem desirable to provide a
new, nongeometric, purely arithmetical-algebraic understanding. This is what is
done by Dedekind (and independently in a different way by Cantor). Dedekind
removed the geometric scaffolding and, in effect, simply identiﬁed a real
number with the set of rational numbers less than it. Needless to say, as a
deﬁnition, “a real number is the set of rational numbers less than some real

number” is hopelessly circular. The trick must be to characterize the relevant
sets of rational numbers without presupposing reals. The Dedekind identiﬁca-
tion is with a cut in the rationals, a set A with three features: (i) A is neither ∅
nor the whole of Q; (ii) every element of A is less than every nonelement; (iii) A
has no largest element. If these are taken as the real numbers, we can deﬁne the
order relation ≤on them simply as the inclusion relation ⊆. It is necessary to
deﬁne also the arithmetic operations and show that the usual laws apply, which
Dedekind did, giving as he claimed the ﬁrst rigorous proof that

:
For Dedekind, the crucial property of the real numbers going beyond the
basic laws of algebra that hold already for the rationals, was continuity, equiva-
lent to what is known as the least upper bound (LUB) principle. Here an upper
bound for a set A is a y with x ≤y for every x in A. and a least upper bound
(LUB) is an upper bound y such that y ≤z for any other upper bound z. The LUB
principle says that any nonempty set with an upper bound has a least one, and
this is indeed just what is needed for the “intermediate value theorem” and other
basic results of calculus. Dedekind’s proof is simplicity itself: Given a family of
real numbers, which is to say, of cuts, with an upper bound, just take their union
to get a least upper bound. Dedekind remarks that, in teaching introductory
calculus, to save time it is better not to go into such things, but just rely on
geometric intuition. But his cut construction found its way into introductory
college textbooks, beginning with the second edition of G. H. Hardy’s Pure
Mathematics (1914).
It should be noted that on this construction the rational numbers Q are not
literally included in the real numbers R, but only an isomorphic copy, with the
rational q replaced by the cut consisting of all rationals p < q: Reconstructions
tend to distinguish natural number 2, the integer +2, the rational þ2=1; and the
real 2.000000. Some symbolic computation programs do the same, but ordinary
mathematical usage does not. But ordinary mathematical usage is admitted to
include many an “abuse of language.”
5.3 Peano Postulates
What are (for debatable historical reasons) called the Peano postulates for the
natural numbers, zero, and successor, denoted N, 0, and S, read as follows:
(P1)
0 2 N
(P2)
S:N →N
(P3)
8x 2 N ðSðxÞ 6¼ 0Þ
(P4)
8x 2 N 8y 2 N ðSðxÞ ¼ SðyÞ  x ¼ yÞ
(P5)
8X ⊆N ðð0 2 X Λ 8x 2 Nðx 2 X  SðxÞ 2 XÞÞ  8x 2 N ðx 2 XÞÞ:

Here (P5) is called the principle of mathematical induction, and may be
restated as follows. Call X inductive if 0 is in X and X is “closed under” S,
meaning SðxÞ is in X whenever x is in X. Then any inductive set contains all
natural numbers. Applied to the set
x 2 NjΦðxÞg
f
, we can prove a condition
holds ΦðxÞ for all natural numbers by proving (i) the zero or base case, that it
holds for 0; and (ii) the successor or inductive step, that it holds for SðxÞ
assuming the induction hypothesis that it holds for x. This method is ubiquitous
in mathematics.
Before we can do number theory we need to have the operations of addition,
multiplication, and exponentiation, as well as the relation of order. Addition can
be characterized by the following recursion equations:
(1) x þ 0 ¼ x
(2) x þ S y
ð Þ ¼ S x þ y
ð
Þ.
Laying down such equations is called deﬁnition by recursion, but since +
occurs on both sides of (2) we do not have here a deﬁnition comparable to those
exhibited in tables so far, which make it possible to replace the deﬁned symbol
anywhere by an expression not involving it. But Dedekind showed how to make
an honest deﬁnition of recursive speciﬁcations, in several stages. First, ﬁx x, and
call a function good for x if we have the following, for all y:
(3) 0 2 dom f ∧f 0
ð Þ ¼ x
(4) SðyÞ 2 dom f  ðy 2 dom f ∧f ðSðyÞÞ ¼ Sð f y
ð ÞÞÞ:
A good f behaves like the function taking y to x + y as far as it goes. One can
show by induction that if g and h are good and y is in the domain of both, then
g(y) = h(y). The zero case is immediate, since (3) speciﬁes the value for 0 . The
successor step is immediate given the induction hypothesis that gðyÞ ¼ hðyÞ,
since (4) speciﬁes the value for S(y) given the value for y.
Second, one can show by induction that for every y there is a good f with y in
its domain. For the zero case take ð0; xÞg
f
, a function with domain 0g
f
satisfy-
ing (3), which also satisﬁes (4) “vacuously” since 0 is not a successor by (P3).
For the successor step, given the induction hypothesis that there is a good f with
y in its domain, if S(y) is already in the domain of f we are done. Otherwise,
consider g ¼ f ∪ðSðyÞ; Sðf ðyÞÞg;
f
a function since f is one and S(y) is not in its
domain, which satisﬁes (3) since f does, and satisﬁes (4), since f does and S(y) is
not the successor of anything but y by (P4). Thus the conditions “for some good
f with y in its domain f ðyÞ ¼ z” and “for every good f with y in its domain
f ðyÞ ¼ z” are equivalent, and for each y there is a unique z such that it holds.
Replacement allows us to form the set of all pairs (y, z) satisfying the condition
to give a function fx with fxð0Þ ¼ x and fxðSðyÞÞ ¼ Sð fxðyÞÞ: Do this for all x,

and replacement then allows us to form the set
fxjx 2 Ng
f
, and union allows us
to form the desired function +.
We can deﬁne x ≤y to hold if x þ z ¼ y for some z. We can deﬁne multiplication
and exponentiation by recursion equations analogous to (1) and (2). Given these
deﬁnitions, we can establish the basic laws of arithmetic by induction. For instance,
for the associative law for addition the zero case and successor step look like this:
x þ y þ 0
ð
Þ ¼ x þ y ¼ x þ y
ð
Þ þ 0
x þ ðy þ S z
ð ÞÞ ¼ x þ S y þ z
ð
Þ ¼ Sðx þ y þ z
ð
ÞÞ
¼ S ðx þ y
ð
Þ þ zÞ ¼ x þ y
ð
Þ þ S z
ð Þ:
The other laws are not hard if taken in the right order (which is not always
obvious). But we are not yet done.
To accommodate applications to counting ﬁnite sets we need to deﬁne what it
is for set X to have a natural number x as the number #X of its elements. We can
then deﬁne X to be ﬁnite if we have #X ¼ x for some x in N. The deﬁnition that
works has #X ¼ x if there is a bijection between X and the set of natural
numbers < x. We need also to connect the recursive deﬁnitions of the arithmetic
operations with the combinatorial characterizations of those same operations,
familiar from school. In the case of addition, for the combinatorial character-
ization we consider the union of two disjoint sets, or equivalently but more
artiﬁcially, of disjoint copies of two sets. In the case of multiplication, it is the
Cartesian product. In the case of exponentiation – where up-arrow notation will
be typographically more convenient that superscript notation – it is the set of
functions from one set to another. Table 13 shows what we need. To prove the
needed equalities using induction we start by showing that if #X ¼ x and y =2 X;
then # X ∪yg
f
Þ ¼ S x
ð Þ
ð
and work from there.
It “only” remains to obtain from the axioms of set theory an N and a 0 and an
S satisfying the Peano postulates. All we need is a set X with a function from X
to X that is an injection but not a surjection. For then we can pick any element
not in its range and call it zero, while calling the function itself successor, and

we will have (P3) and (P4). We can then deﬁne a subset Yof X to be inductive if it
contains 0 and is closed under S, and trivially X itself will be inductive, and
hence the family of inductive sets nonempty. We may then take N to be the
intersection of this family, which can easily be seen to be itself inductive, giving
(P1) and (P2). As for (P5), it will essentially have been made true by the mere
deﬁnition of N. Contrary to a widespread opinion, classically expressed in
Poincaré (1905/1983), intuition is not needed, but only logic, to obtain math-
ematical induction – given set theory. For set theory does, with its axiom of
inﬁnity, supply us with a set and a nonsurjective injection of the kind required,
one for which 0 ¼ ∅and SðxÞ ¼ xg
f
.
This formulation is Zermelo’s. There is an equivalent alternative due to
John von Neumann (1923/1967), with 0 ¼ ∅but S(x) deﬁned not as
xg
f
but as x ∪xg;
f
abbreviated x0. That x0 ¼ y0 implies x ¼ y is less obvious than
that
xg ¼ yg
f
f
implies x ¼ y; but not too hard to prove using foundation.
(For x0 has an epsilon-maximal element, one of which all its other elements
are elements, namely x, and it cannot have any other such y 6¼ x, since that
would give x 2 y 2 x; contrary to foundation. If x0 ¼ y0; their epsilon-maximal
elements, x and y, must be the same.) Where the Zermelodic deﬁnition makes a
natural number the singleton of its immediate predecessor, the Neumannian
makes it the set of all its predecessors: 1 ¼ 0g; 2 ¼ 0; 1g; 3 ¼ 0; 1; 2g;
f
f
f
and this allows us to give the simple deﬁnition #X ¼ x if there is a
bijection between X and x. It also has the advantage of generalizing to
the transﬁnite, as will be seen later. Other mathematicians never think
about whether 2 ¼ 1g or 2 ¼ 0; 1g;
f
f
but set theorists adhere to the latter.
There are also variations on these constructions in which inﬁnity is not needed
for the theory of natural, integral, or rational (as contrasted with real and
complex) numbers.
Set theory provides a framework for the rigorous development of all
mathematics. Each branch, group theory or ﬁeld theory or whatever, is
concerned with some special kind of set-theoretic structure, groups or
ﬁelds or whatever, and the “axioms” of the theory are merely the deﬁnition
of the class of structures in question. Often ZFC is described as a “foun-
dation” for mathematics, but such a description is questionable. To accom-
modate all mathematics, ZFC includes some assumptions more open to
doubt than what would be needed just to accommodate arithmetic. Hence,
incorporating arithmetic into set theory is not placing it on a ﬁrmer
foundation. Rather, it is placing it in a context where it can interact with
other branches of mathematics, with a common standard of proof. That is
accomplishment enough.

6 Inﬁnities
With the number systems available for examples, we are where Cantor was
when he took off into the transﬁnite. Intuitively, their equivalence type is what
items equivalent in some way thereby have in common, as lines in the plane that
are parallel have in common their direction. Cantor understood the power or
cardinal ‖A‖ of a set A to be its equivalence type under equipollence or
equinumerosity ≈, and the order type jAj of an ordered set A to be its equiva-
lence type under isomorphism ﬃ. He called the order types of wellorders
ordinals and the cardinals of wellorderable sets alephs. He never identiﬁed
such items with sets, but of his account of what they are (mental items created
by acts of selective inattention), the less said the better. A good deal can be
established while remaining silent about such issues.
6.1 Cardinals
Cantor deﬁned ‖A‖ ¼ ‖B‖ if there is a bijection f: A →B: He deﬁned sum and
product and power, + and · and ↑as in Table 13 of §5.3. In particular, with
ℵ0 ¼ ‖N‖; 2ℵ
0 is the cardinal of all zero-one sequences, or equivalently of all sets
of natural numbers. He deﬁned ‖A‖ ≤‖B‖ if there is an injection f: A →B;

Many of the laws proved by induction for natural numbers hold for cardinals
generally, by proofs directly from the deﬁnitions. For instance, the associative
and commutative laws for addition follow from the corresponding laws for
union, and ultimately disjunction. Other laws fail badly, notably cancellation:
x þ z ¼ y þ z  x ¼ y
z > 0 ∧x  z ¼ y  z  x ¼ y:
Counterexamples include these:
א0 ¼א0 þא0 ¼א0 א0
2ℵ
0 ¼ 2ℵ
0 þ 2ℵ
0 ¼ 2ℵ
0  2ℵ
0:
For products, the result aboutא0 follow from the codability of a pair (m, n)
of naturals by the single natural 2m  ð2n þ 1Þ; and the result about 2ℵ0 then
follows using general laws of exponents: 2ℵ
0  2ℵ
0 ¼ 2ℵ

cancellation means that there is no subtraction or division for Cantor’s trans-
ﬁnites, which have nothing to do with the supposed inﬁnitesimals of prerigor-
ous calculus. For antisymmetry of ≤, even without cancellation we still get
the law.

Textbook proofs generally presuppose that the apparatus of natural numbers
and deﬁnition by recursion has already been set up in a set-theoretic context
before this topic is broached. This is partly for historical reasons: the earliest
proof (Bernstein’s) was found when set theory was still being pursued taking the
traditional numbers systems for granted, without thought of redeveloping arith-
metic from set-theoretic axioms. And it is partly for pedagogical reasons: that
proof has the advantage of lending itself to illustration by a picture. But there are
also advantages to having a proof more from ﬁrst principles, such as could be
used to develop the general theory of cardinals before the ﬁnite cardinals or
natural numbers are singled out for special attention. Let me outline such a proof
(due to Zermelo, building on Dedekind) as a series of exercises for the reader,
since it is not very often presented elsewhere:
(1) Let g: A →B and h : B →A be injections.
Let B ¼ h½B ⊆A and C ¼ h½g½A ⊆B and f ðg ∘hÞ1: A →C:
Show that f is a bijection.
(2) Deﬁne G:PðAÞ →PðAÞ by GðXÞ ¼ ðA  BÞ ∪f ½X:
Show that GðXÞ ⊆GðYÞ whenever X ⊆Y:
(3) Show that
X ⊆AjGðXÞ ⊆Xg 6¼ ∅;
f
implying that Z ¼ ∩X ⊆AjGðXÞ
f
⊆Xg exists.
(4) Show that GðZÞ ⊆Z: Then show that GðZÞ ¼ Z:
(5) Deﬁne k : A →B by kðxÞ ¼ f x
ð Þ if x 2 Z and ¼ x otherwise. Show that k
is a bijection.
(6) Let g ¼ k ∘h1: Show that g: A →B is a bijection.
This result is used in computations. For 2ℵ0 ¼ ‖
‖
PðNÞ and c ¼ R it is easier
to show ‖R‖ ≤‖
‖
PðNÞ ≤R than to show 2ℵ0 ¼ c directly.
Cantor’s diagonal argument, used to prove c uncountable, generalizes. Given
a set K of cardinal κ and a family of subsets of K indexed by a set of cardinal κ,
say K itself, there is a subset of K left out of the family, namely, if Xk : k 2 Kg
f
is
the family,
kjk =2 Xkg
f
is left out. This shows that 2κ > κ for all κ, giving
indeﬁnitely many larger and larger cardinals.
6.2 Order Types
By order, understand in the present discussion strict order. The reverse of an order
< is the order >. The sum and product of orders A ¼ ðA; RÞ and another order
B ¼ ðB; SÞ are the orders on A ⊕B and A ⊗B, respectively, given as follows.

Thus the sum puts a copy of A before a copy of B, while the product orders
pairs in reverse dictionary order, ﬁrst by their second components, and if these
are the same, then by their ﬁrst components. The reverse ρ of the order type ρ
of A is the order type of the reverse of A, and similarly for sums and products. It
can be checked that these notions are “well-deﬁned”: If two orders are iso-
morphic, having the same type, the same is true of their reverses, and similarly
for sums and products. If we give the order types of the usual orders on naturals
N and integers Z the names ω and π, then π ¼ ω þ ω:
Some of the usual laws hold, by extensions of the proofs used in the case of
cardinals. This includes the associative laws. Other laws that held for cardinals
fail for order types, including the commutative laws. Examples in Table 14
illustrate the point, showing 1 þ ω ¼ 2  ω ¼ ω; while ω þ 1 is different, hav-
ing a last element with no immediate predecessor, and ω · 2 is different, having
an element with no immediate predecessor, but no last element.
Characterizations of the order types ω and λ of N and R are at least implicit in
Dedekind. The characterization of the order type η of Q is a famous theorem of
Cantor. To state these results, we need a few more notions pertaining to orders
beyond those of wellorder and continuous order. An order is dense if whenever
x < y there is a z with x < z < y; and a subset Z of A is dense in the order if
whenever x < y there is a z 2 Z with x < z < y: Thus Q is dense in R. An order
with a countable dense subset is called separable. Thus R is separable. By
contrast, an order is discrete if every element x but the least (if any) has an
immediate predecessor, a y < x with no z between, and every element x but the
last (if any) has an immediate successor, a y > x with no z between.
The characterizing properties of the traditional orders are as in Table 15. Only
Cantor’s famous “back and forth” argument for η will be given here. (The same
argument, going only “forth” and not “back,” shows that every countable order
is isomorphic to a suborder of Q.)
So let A and B both have the properties indicated for η in the table. We may
take one of them to be the rationals. Since A and B are both countable, we can ﬁx

an enumeration of each, which need have nothing to do with the order relations
≤A and ≤B: Call f a partial isomorphism if it is a function from a ﬁnite subset
of A to a ﬁnite subset of B that preserves order.
Lemma If f is a partial isomorphism, for any a in A – dom f there is a b in B – ran
f such that g ¼ f ∪
a; b
ð
Þg
f
is a partial isomorphism.
Informally, “we can add any element we like to the domain of a partial isomorph-
ism.” For the proof, to preserve order, if a is < all elements of dom f in A, we need
b to be < all elements of ran f in B. If a is between two elements a; a of dom f
in A, we need b to be between b ¼ f ðaÞ and b ¼ f ðaÞ in B. If a is > all
elements of dom f in A, we need b to be > all elements of ran f in B. In each of the
three cases a suitable b is available because B has no least element, or because B is
dense, or because B has no greatest element. For deﬁniteness, we may take for b
whatever suitable element comes earliest in the ﬁxed enumeration of B.
Essentially the same proof shows we can add any element we like to the range
of a partial isomorphism. To prove Cantor’s characterization theorem we go back
and forth in steps, at even steps adding to the domain, at odd steps to the range,
getting a sequence of partial isomorphisms with larger and larger domain and
range until A and B have been exhausted, when putting everything together we get
an isomorphism between A and B.
A problem of Mikhail Suslin concerning λ also deserves mention.
Separability, the existence of a countable set containing at least one element
from every open interval, implies the nonexistence of an uncountable family of
nonoverlapping open intervals. Can the latter replace separability in the char-
acterization? Suslin’s hypothesis (SH) is that it can. Information about the status
of SH will be provided later.
6.3 Ordinals
We now take up von Neumann’s approach to ordinals and alephs. A set x is
transitive if every element of an element is an element, ∪x ⊆x; or equivalently,
every element is a subset, x ⊆PðxÞ: A (von Neumann) ordinal is a transitive set

on which 2 is a strict wellorder. Then isomorphism with an ordinal α means
isomorphism with this order ðα; 2 Þ: The development of the theory of ordinals
is facilitated by foundation (although feasible without it), using the following.
Ordinal Criterion If x be transitive and suppose 2 is connected on x. Then x is
an ordinal.
Proof: Foundation implies irreﬂexivity of 2 . We then get transitivity of 2 on x
because for elements of x if w 2 v 2 u; foundation precludes having u ¼ w or
u 2 w, and connectedness leaves w 2 u the only alternative. So 2 is a strict order
on x, which foundation, with the existence of epsilon-minimal elements, then
says is a wellorder.
Ordinal Transitivity Let x be an ordinal and u an element of x. Then u is an
ordinal.
Proof: The argument just given shows that u is transitive, and connectedness of
2 is inherited from x.
Ordinal Connectedness Let x and y be ordinals. Then either x 2 y
or x ¼ y or y 2 x.
This is a more substantial result. Here is the proof in outline as exercises for
the reader:
(1) Show that if y  x 6¼ ∅, and z is an element thereof, then x ∩y ⊆z:
(2) Show that if y  x 6¼ ∅; and z is an epsilon-minimal element thereof, then
x ∩y ¼ z:
(3) Show that we cannot have both y  x 6¼ ∅; and x  y 6¼ ∅:
(4) Show that if x 6¼ y; either y ⊆x; implying x ∩y ¼ y; or x ⊆y; implying
x ∩y ¼ x:
(5) Show that either x 2 y or x ¼ y or y 2 x:
Givenordinaltransitivityandconnectedness,theargumentforthecriterionshows
that 2 is a strict wellorder relationship on ordinals, and accordingly with ordinals
we write 2 and < interchangeably, and each ordinal becomes the set of all ordinals
less than it. By the foregoing, if contrary to fact the ordinals formed a set, it would be
an ordinal, and the largest ordinal, a result known as the Burali–Forti paradox. (A
“paradox” because example (2) below shows there can be no largest ordinal.)
Ordinal Examples
The zero, 0 ¼ ∅, is an ordinal, the least.
The successor, x0 ¼ x ∪xg
f
, of an ordinal x is an ordinal, the least > x.
The supremum sup X ¼ ∪X; of a set X of ordinals is an ordinal, the least ≥all
elements of X.

sequence, we will not distinguish those of length two from ordered pairs, and will
use the usual notation for pairs, triples, and so on; similarly with anω-sequence such
the zero-one sequences in the diagonal argument.
Ordinary ﬁnite induction for natural numbers has an analogue, transﬁnite
induction for ordinals.
Induction If for, all α; ΦðαÞ holds provided Φ β
ð Þ holds for all β < α; then ΦðαÞ
holds for all α.
Proof: The proviso says there is no least α for which ΦðαÞ fails, so by the
wellorder property than can be none at all.
In proofs by induction, the proof of the proviso often breaks up into three
cases according as α is zero, a successor, or a limit. As simple application we
have the following.
Lemma Let § be an order-preserving operation on ordinals. Then for all α we
have α ≤§α.
Proof: The zero case is trivial. In the successor case, having α ≤§α, since α < αʹ
we must have §α < §αʹ; whence α < §αʹ; whence αʹ ≤§α because αʹ is the
least ordinal > α: The limit case is left as an exercise.
Corollary No ordinal is isomorphic to any smaller ordinal.
For if f: α →β were an isomorphism with β < α; we would have f β
ð Þ < β;
whereas by the lemma we have β ≤f β
ð Þ:
Along with induction we have ordinal or transﬁnite recursion. We can
specify α þ β as follows:
α
if β ¼ 0
ðα þ γÞʹ
if β ¼ γʹ

α þ γjγ < βÞ
if β is a limit:
f
This can be turned into an honest deﬁnition using induction as was done for
natural numbers in §5.3 (deﬁning a good function, and so on). Multiplication
and exponentiation can be similarly introduced. And some ordinary laws can be
proved by induction, usually with the zero and successor cases being just as for
natural numbers. With other ordinary laws, the limit case cannot be pushed
through, and we have a refutation by counterexample, for instance:

The inductive deﬁnitions of addition and multiplication can be connected with
Cantor’s notions of addition and multiplication for order types in general, in much
the same way the inductive deﬁnitions were related to combinatorial characteriza-
tions for the natural numbers. One more important connection remains:
Comparison Lemma Every strict wellorder A ¼ ðA; <AÞ is isomorphic to
some ordinal.
Uniqueness of the ordinal, which may be called the order type of the wellorder,
follows from the corollary. For the proof, suppose A is a counterexample. B ⊆A is
an initial segment of A if x 2 B whenever x<Ay 2 B: We deﬁne an order-preserv-
ing operation f from ordinals to an initial segment B, thus: If f β
ð Þ has been
deﬁned for β < α, its range cannot be all of A, else we would have an isomorph-
ism between α and A; so let f α
ð Þ be the <A least element of A that is >A f β
ð Þ for
any β < α: We get an injective operation from all ordinals into A, hence a bijective
operation from all ordinals onto some B ⊆A: Replacement guarantees the existence
of
f 1ðaÞja 2 Bg

, but this is the set of all ordinals, which cannot exist! The
Burali–Forti paradox, originally a misguided objection to Cantor, becomes a
useful lemma. Here is another.
Hartogs’ Lemma For every set X there is an ordinal α with no surjection
f : X →α:
For the proof, any surjection f: X →α gives rise to an equivalence relation
f ðxÞ ¼ f ðyÞ on X and hence a partition of X, as well as a strict wellorder R on the
cells of the partition, given by ½xR½y iff f ðxÞ < f ðyÞ; and the order type of this
partition is α. Every strict wellorder on the cells of a partition of X belongs to
P ðPðXÞ ⊗P ðXÞÞ; and separation lets us form the set Y of all such R, and
then replacement lets us form the set Z of all order types of elements of Y. If β is
the least ordinal greater than all those in Z, called the Hartogs’ number of X,
then there can be no surjection f: X →β: Note that neither can there be an
injection g: β →X: The importance of his lemma from Hartogs (1915) seems to
have been only rather belated recognized.
6.4 Alephs
While it can be proved by mathematical induction that no ﬁnite ordinal is
equinumerous with any smaller one, and that there is ‘up to isomorphism’
only one way to order a ﬁnite set, already there are many non-isomorphic
ways of ordering the set of positive integers, as exhibited in Table 16, which
should be compared with Table 14 of §6.2.

With ordinals, if there is a surjection f : α →β; there is an injection g: β →α
sending y < β to the least x < α with f ðxÞ ¼ y: Conversely, given an injection g
we get a surjection f sending gðyÞ to y and anything not in ran g to 0. An initial
ordinal is one for with no surjection from a smaller ordinal onto it, or equiva-
lently no injection from it into a smaller ordinal. We denote the Hartogs’ number
of an ordinal α by αþ. We can deﬁne by recursion an indexing of all inﬁnite
initial ordinals by ω0 ¼ ω; ωαþ1 ¼ ωαþ; and ωα ¼ sup
ωβj < αg

at limits.
An aleph is the cardinal of a wellorderable set. Alephs may be identiﬁed with
initial ordinals: ℵα ¼ ωα: But with aleph notation + and · denote cardinal
operations, with omega notation, ordinal operations. The most important fact
about the arithmetic of alephs is that ℵα ¼ ℵα þ ℵα ¼ ℵα  ℵα: This is proved by
induction. Considering here only the result for multiplication, the zero case we
know. In the successor case, suppose ℵα ¼ ℵα  ℵα and β ¼ αʹ so ℵβ ¼ ℵαþ: To
show ℵβ ¼ ℵβ  ℵβ it sufﬁces to show that we can wellorder ωβ ⊗ωβ in order
type ωβ; which means that the number of pairs < any given one is < ℵβ: For this
it will be enough that the predecessors any pair ðγ; δÞ all come from ζ ⊗ζ for
some ζ < ωβ; since the number of ordinals < ζ is ≤ℵα and the number of
suitable pairs then ≤ℵα  ℵα ¼ ℵα: The order that works puts γ; δ

max ðγ; δÞ < max ðμ; νÞ
max ðγ; δÞ ¼ max ðμ; νÞ and γ < μ:
max ðγ; δÞ ¼ max ðμ; νÞ and γ ¼ μ and δ < ν:
The order type ξ of the predecessors of ðγ; δÞ in this order may be considered
single ordinal code for the ordinal pair. The limit case is left as an exercise.

arithmetic.

by minimality, ΦðzÞ holds for all such z, while failing for y, contrary to

ð Þ: It can then be proved by epsilon
induction that for every x there is an α with x 2 VðαÞ: For if for each y 2 x there is
a β and therefore a least β with y 2 V β
ð Þ; replacement implies the existence of
the set of all such least β for y 2 x. If α is their sup, then x ⊆V α

ð Þ.
These V α
ð Þ should be recognizable as the boxes of the cumulative hierarchy in

If E is an equivalence relationship, we can deﬁne the truncated equiva-
lence class ≪x≫of x to be the set of y with xEy of minimum possible
rank, so that for any z, if xEz then rkðzÞ ≤rkðyÞ. (It will be a subset of
VðrkðxÞʹÞ; existing by separation.) These truncated equivalence classes
have the one mathematically important property of equivalence types,
namely, that xEy if ≪x≫¼ ≪y≫: And so we can take as set-theoretic
surrogates for order types of nonwellorders and cardinals of nonwellorderable
sets the truncated equivalence classes with respect to isomorphism and equinu-
merosity. This approach is often called “Scott’s trick” after Dana Scott, who
originated it. (The advantage of the von Neumann identiﬁcations in the case of
wellorders and wellorderable sets is that they make the order type to be a
speciﬁc wellorder of that type, and the cardinal to be a particular set equinumer-
ous with the given one.)

7 The Axiom of Choice
The axiom of choice (AC), of which no use has been made thus far, has both
inconspicuous and conspicuous applications, sometimes in providing counter-
examples to conjectures, sometimes in proving positive results, including
Zermelo’s premier application to proving that R is wellorderable.
7.1 Weak and Full Choice
A countable union of sets of some kind means simply the union of a countable
family of sets each of that kind. Two fundamental theorems of Cantorian theory
read as follows.
Theorem A A countable union of countable sets is countable.
Theorem B If A is inﬁnite, then ‖A‖ ≥ℵ0:
To prove (A) one might argue thus: Let the family be
Anjn 2 Ng;
f
and let An ¼ ammjm 2 Ng:
f
Then the union is the set of amm for m; n
ð
Þ
2 N ⊗N; and we can use the coding of pairs of naturals by single naturals to
get an enumeration.
To prove (B), one might argue thus: Let a0 be any element of A. Since A is not
ﬁnite, it has an element a1 other than a0. Again since A is not ﬁnite, it has an element
a2 other than a0 and a1. And so on. amjm 2 Ng
f
is a subset of A of size ℵ0:
Both arguments are fallacious, and the theorems cannot be proved in
ZF ¼ ZFC minus AC. The argument for (A) assumes we have a speciﬁc
enumeration for each Am; and requires (CC) below, applied to F(n) = the family
of all enumerations of An: That for (B) requires (DC) below, applied to the
relation R that holds between an ordered m-tuple of elements of A and an
extension to an ordered m þ 1
ð
Þ  tuple of elements of A whose last element
is different from its ﬁrst m.
Countable Choice (CC) If F is a function with domain N with FðnÞ 6¼ ∅for
all n, then there is a function f with domain N with f ðnÞ 2 FðnÞ for all n.
Dependent Choice (DC) If R is a relation on a set X such that for all x 2 X there
exists a y 2 X with xRy, then there is a function f: N →X with f ðnÞRf ðn þ 1Þ
for all n.
DC implies that there is an inﬁnite descending sequence in any order that is
not a wellorder. It is left to the reader to show that CC is implied by DC, and DC
by the following:
AC
ð
Þ Let I be any nonempty set, and X the family of its nonempty subsets.
Then there exists a function ε: X →I with εðAÞ 2 A for all A in X.

Such an ε is called a choice function for I. AC* is implied by AC as originally
formulated. (The converse is also true, and left as an exercise.) For consider the
set of pairs ðA; aÞ with a 2 A 2 X and the partition of that set in which the cell of
ðA; aÞ is the set of pairs ðA; bÞ with same ﬁrst component. Then a selector for this
partition will be the required ε. A contrast between the special cases CC or DC
of choice and full strength AC or AC* of choice is that applications of the latter
tend to be conspicuous, those of the former, easily overlooked.
With full AC, theorem A can be generalized to any aleph κ, to show that a
union of ≤κ sets each of size ≤κ has size ≤κ. An aleph λ is called regular if a
union of < λ each of size < λ has size < λ; so the result just stated can be
restated as saying that the successor λ ¼ κþ of any aleph κ is regular. Theorem
A itself says ℵ1 is regular.
Henri Lebesgue’s theory of “measure” (1902) involved an early application
of Cantor’s ideas. The theory shows how to deﬁne notions of length, area, and
volume for a family of curves, surfaces, and solids, called Lebesgue measur-
able, extending far beyond those of Euclidean geometry. One can deﬁne, for
instance, for an extensive family of subsets of the unit circle, a reasonable
notion measure or “total length” with these features:
(1) The measure of the whole circle is its circumference 2π.
(2) If one set can be carried to another by rotation, they have the same measure.
(3) The measure of the union of a countable family of pairwise disjoint sets is
the sum of the measures of the individual sets.
Lebesgue’s work left open whether such a notion of measure µ could be
deﬁned for all subsets of the circle. Giuseppe Vitali (1905) answered this
question negatively by a conspicuous application of AC. Call points on the
circle equivalent if one can be carried to the other by a rotation of a
rational fraction of a full 360°. Apply AC to obtain a selector S with one
point in each cell of the induced partition. Since the whole circle is the
union of the rotations of S through rational angles, of which there are only
countably many, by (1) and (3) the sum of the measures of these sets
should be 2π: But by (2) the measures of these sets should all be equal.
And the sum of denumerably many copies of the same quantity µ(S) must
be either zero (if μðSÞ ¼ 0) or inﬁnite (if μðSÞ > 0). Vitali’s counterexam-
ple has many elaborations, of which the most famous is the Banach–Tarski
paradox: a solid ball can be disassembled into a ﬁnite number of pieces
which can be rotated, translated, and reassembled into two balls the same
size. See Blumenthal (1940) for an early account in English.

7.2 Equivalents of Choice
AC also has positive consequences, notably the following crucial result of
Zermelo.
Wellordering Principle (WO) Every set is wellorderable.
Proof: Given a set A, ﬁx a choice function ε for A, and let e be any
nonelement of A. Deﬁne by recursion an operation f assigning to ordinals
elements of A as follows: If f ðβÞ has been deﬁned for β < α; consider
B ¼ f β
ð Þjβ < αg:
f
Let f α
ð Þ ¼ ε A  B
ð
Þ if A  B 6¼ ∅; and f α
ð Þ ¼ e other-
wise. By Hartogs’ lemma there must be an α for which the latter case applies,
else we would have an injection of the Hartogs’ number of A into A. For the least
such α we have A ¼
f β
ð Þjβ < αg
f
and we can wellorder A by setting
f ðγÞRf ðβÞ iff γ < β.
That conversely WO implies AC* is almost immediate. To get a choice
function for a set I having a wellorder R on I, let εðAÞ ¼ the R least element
of A, for any nonempty A ⊆I. Many positive applications of AC can be made
without bringing in apparatus pertaining to wellorders (which many mathemat-
icians would prefer to avoid) by use of the following.
Zorn’s Lemma (ZL) A partial order in which every chain has an upper bound
has a maximal element.
Proof: Given the partial order P ¼ P; ≤p


; ﬁx a choice function ε for P, and let
e be any nonelement of A. Deﬁne by recursion an order-preserving operation
from ordinals to P as follows.
f 0
ð Þ ¼ ε P
ð Þ
f ðβ0Þ ¼ εð p 2 Pjp>p f ðβÞgÞ if f ðβÞ is not maximal; and ¼ e otherwise

f ðαÞ ¼ εð p 2 Pjp is an upper bound to the chain
f ðβÞjβ < αg
f
gÞ at limits
f
Apply Hartogs’ lemma as in the proof of WO.
Conversely, ZL implies AC. Given a partition X of a set I, let P consist of all
partial selectors, or subsets of I containing at most one element of each cell,
partially ordered by inclusion. It is easily checked that every chain has an upper
bound (its union), and that a maximal element must be a selector (else we could
add one element from any cell missed).
Assuming AC, all cardinals are alephs, and so κ  κ ¼ κ for all κ. Alfred
Tarski showed this result implies AC. See Gillman (2002). There are endless
other known equivalents. See Rubin and Rubin (1970).

8 Topics in Higher Set Theory
The material presented so far includes the basics of what would be covered (with
less philosophical commentary and with a good deal of mathematical detail here
left to the reader spelled out for the student) in any of the several ﬁne introductory
textbooks on various levels that are available. Halmos (1960) covers less,
Hrbacek and Jech (1999) more. This includes about as much of set theory as
working mathematicians in most branches of mathematics are acquainted with.
There is a great deal more to set theory than that, but just as Euclid’s Elements
leaves out such advanced topics as we ﬁnd in the works of Apollonius and
Archimedes, so this Element will have to pass over a vast amount of material in
silence, or with only few allusions. And while some ideas of the proofs of the
results that do get cited in the remainder of this work will be indicated, there will
usually be even less detail than in the proofs or proof sketches up to this point.
And while the names of many of the principal contributors to the subject will be
mentioned, because the earlier of their original papers are often in French or
German, and the later often would require years of graduate study to be able to
read, citations merely for purposes of documenting historical attributions will be
suppressed, except for the most important landmarks.
Higher set theory comprises three areas of study: (i) descriptive set theory,
concerned with the reals and special sets thereof, or roughly with Vðω þ 1Þ;
(ii) continuum theory, concerned with abitrary sets of reals, or roughly with
Vðω þ 2Þ; (iii) combinatorial set theory, concerned with arbitrary sets of
arbitrary elements, and with higher VðαÞ. (The V notation is as in §6.4.)
They have been listed in order of decreasing direct relevance to other branches
of mathematics. Indirect relevance is another matter, since the three areas turn
out to be connected with each other in deep ways it will take some time to
bring out. All three abound in questions that cannot be settled on the basis of
the axioms of ZFC alone, so that many of the most important results to be
reported belong to the so-called metamathematics of set theory, being the-
orems about what isn’t a theorem of ZFC. Axioms beyond ZFC eventually get
brought in, and here the different characters of the three areas come out.
Axioms arguably expressing the thought that the universe of sets is maximally
“high” (so-called large cardinal axioms) have turned out to tell us almost
everything about area (i) and almost nothing about area (ii). Axioms arguably
expressing the thought that the universe of sets is maximally “wide” (so-called
forcing axioms) are having great impact on area (ii), but less on area (iii). But
before taking up these advanced matters, we need some sample results from
each of the three areas.

8.1 Descriptive Set Theory
The development of geometry within algebra and analysis and thence set theory
involves identifying linear or plane points with elements of R or R ⊗R: Once
it is clear we are dealing with mathematical “spaces” and not physical space, we
can freely introduce Euclidean spaces of any dimension, and non-Euclidean
spaces of any kind. The theory of special sets of points on the real number line is
called descriptive set theory, but its results extend to a wider range of spaces
treated, for instance, in the classic Kuratowski (1966), and called Polish spaces.
Still, we begin with R. Its countably many basic sets are open intervals a; b½
deﬁned as x 2 Rja < x < bg
f
with rational endpoints a, b. (Often in the literature,
the simple notation ða; bÞ is used for the open interval, but we have been using
that simple notation for the ordered pair, which we have had much more
occasion
to
mention.
Either
way
½a; b
denotes
the
closed
interval
x 2 Rja ≤x ≤bg:
f
) Two intervals, ]a, b[ and ]c, d[are separate if b < c or
d < a; so they neither overlap nor abut. In the real plane R ⊗R, similar deﬁnitions
can be made starting from rectangles. The projection of a planar set A ⊆R ⊗R is
the linear set B ⊆R that would be called dom Awhen thinking about A as a relation,
namely, the set of ﬁrst components of ordered pairs in A. Further sets of interest are
classiﬁed in point classes as deﬁned in the adjoining Tables 17 and 18.
Using such facts that countable unions of countable sets are countable, and
the DeMorgan and Distributive laws for indexed families, it can be shown that

the intersection or union of two (and hence of ﬁnitely many) sets in any of these
classes is in the class, that Gδ sets are complements of Fσ sets, that open sets are
Fσ and closed sets are Gδ, that countable unions of Fσ sets are Fσ and countable
intersections of Gδ sets are Gδ, and so on. Such basic theorems would be early
exercises in a textbook.
Even sets in the lowest point-classes can be by ordinary standards quite
complicated. They include all the “fractals” pictured in coffee-table books.
Yet since there are only countably many basic sets, there are only c open sets,
and this extends to projective sets. Since there are 2c arbitrary subsets of R, this
means descriptive set theory is concerned with only a small fraction. Yet sets in
the indicated point classes include all those ordinarily encountered in analysis,
apart from pathological counterexamples like Vitali’s.
Higher theorems about a point class Γ are of two kinds: A regularity theorem
says that each set in Γ is “nice” in some way (Lebesgue measurability being one
kind of “niceness” especially important for other branches of mathematics). A
structural theorem says that different sets in Γ are “nicely related” in some way.
For instance, sets C, D are said to reduce sets A, B if the following relationships
hold:
C ⊆A
D ⊆B
C ∪D ¼ A ∪B
C ∩D ¼ ∅;
The reduction principle for Γ says any pair of sets in Γ is reduced by some
pair of sets in Γ.
Sample Structural Theorem The reduction principle holds for Fσ sets.
Proof sketch: Let A be the union of closed Ai and B the union of closed
Bi f or i 2 N: Let C consist of those x such that for some i, x is in Ai but not in
Bj for any j < i; and D of those x such that for some i, x is in Bi not in Aj for any
j ≤i: The elements of A ∪B that “get into A no later than into B” are in C, while
those that “get into B sooner than into A” are in D. Reduction is easily veriﬁed,
while C and D being Fσ can be veriﬁed using the fact that ﬁnite unions and
intersections of closed and open sets are simultaneously Fσ and Gδ.
A perfect set P is one that (i) is closed and (ii) has no isolated points. Here (i)
implies that if every basic set containing a point x meets P, then x is in P, while
(ii) means that any basic set U that meets P contains at least two distinct points x
and y of P. From this it follows that U includes two separate basic sets Vand W
that both meet P (V containing x and W containing y), which moreover may be
taken to be as short as desired in length. So we can obtain basic sets U0 and U1 of
length < 1=2 that both meet P, then separate basic subsets U00 and U01 of U0 and
U10 and U11 of I1 of length < 1=4 that all meet P, and so on. For any inﬁnite zero-
one sequence, say σ ¼ ð0; 1; 1; : : :Þ the intersection of U0 and U01 and U011

and U0111 and so on will be a singleton xσg
f
such that every basic set containing
xσ meets P, making xσ an element of P, while separateness of the different Us
means that distinct σs give distinct xσs. Hence P contains as many elements as
there are zero-one sequences, and we have sketched a proof that any perfect set
has cardinal c.
A set A has the perfect set property if it is either countable or contains a
perfect subset. This implies that A is either countable or of cardinality c, but is a
stronger statement, since AC implies there exist pathological sets of size c
without perfect subsets. To sketch a proof, since there are only c perfect sets,
with AC we can wellorder them in a sequence Pα indexed by ordinals α < c; so
that each has < c predecessors. And then we can inductively choose xα and yα
distinct from each other and from all xβ and yβ with β < α; and both in Pα, since
at stage α only fewer that c points will have been chosen, while Pα has c to
choose from. In the end, the set of all xα will have size c, but include no perfect
set Pα, having left out yα.
Now consider a closed set C and go back to Cantor’s construction with which
we began in §1.1, successively discarding isolated points, taking derived sets
indexed by ordinals. Each time a point is discarded, it belongs to a basic set with
no other point in it, and we can say that whole basic set is discarded with the
point. Since there are only countably many basic sets to discard, the process can
only go on for countably many stages, and can only discard a countable set C0 of
points. If nothing is then left, then C ¼ C0 is countable. If anything is left, it is a
perfect set. We have sketched the proof of the following.
Cantor–Bendixson Theorem Any uncountable closed set is the union of a
countable and a perfect set.
In particular, closed sets have the perfect set property. But then so does any
union of a countable family of closed sets, since if each set in the family is
countable, so is their union, while if any contains a perfect subset, the union
contains it, too. So we have the following.
Sample Regularity Theorem Every Fσ set has the perfect set property.
The Polish and Russian schools between the world wars created classical
descriptive set theory, obtaining regularity and structural theorems much
stronger than our samples, extending to much larger point classes: notably,
the Lebesgue measurability (and an analogous Baire property) of all analytic
and coanalytic sets, and the reduction principle (and a stronger uniformization
principle) for PCA sets. But then progress halted. The reason why will emerge
later.

8.2 Continuum Theory
A couple of negative general theorems about arbitrary sets of reals have already
been given: the theorem that not all sets have the perfect set property, and that
not all are Lebesgue measurable (to which it could be added that not all have the
property of Baire). Such theorems have at least the value for other branches of
mathematics of warning the mathematician not to try to do the impossible. And
such negative results are, in a sense, what motivates descriptive set theory: If a
regularity property cannot be established for all sets, then let us look at larger
and larger classes for which it can be established. And in order to have still sets
with a given regularity property while performing various operations creating
new sets from old, we will want structural theorems saying that various classes
are closed under various operations.
One signiﬁcant open question at this level has been mentioned in §6.2, the
status of the Suslin hypothesis (SH). But the main question in the theory of
arbitrary sets of reals is the continuum hypothesis (CH). Actually, there are two
propositions so named, as follows.
There is no cardinal λ with ℵ0 < λ<2ℵ
0
2ℵ
0 ¼ ℵ1.
The second implies the ﬁrst, and the ﬁrst implies the second if c is an aleph, so
assuming AC, as we will here, the two are equivalent. CH was conjectured by
Cantor, and placed ﬁrst on his 1900 list of mathematical problems for the new
century by Hilbert. Like AC, CH has many equivalents and interesting conse-
quences (see Sierpinski, 1956). The main alternatives to CH considered have
been that c ¼ ℵ2 and that c is a ﬁxed point of the alephs, a κ such that κ ¼ ℵκ.
One isolated result proved early is König’s theorem that c 6¼ ℵω: But after this
there were a several of decades of lack of progress.
The reason why emerged in the middle 1900s. Gödel’s First Incompleteness
theorem tells us any reasonably strong consistent mathematical axiom system T
will leave some Ψ undecidable, neither provable nor disprovable. (By contrast,
an inconsistent axiom system can prove anything. For a contradiction Φ ˄ :Φ
implies Φ, but also :Φ hence :Φ ˅ Ψ, which is Φ  Ψ while Φ and Φ  Ψ
imply Ψ, whatever it may be.) Gödel’s Second Incompleteness theorem gives a
speciﬁc example, telling us that Con(T), the assertion that T is consistent, will
be unprovable (if true). But the ﬁrst natural-looking speciﬁc mathematical
statement shown to be undecidable by ZFC was CH.
Kurt Gödel (1940) and Paul Cohen (1966) proved respectively that ZFC
cannot disprove and cannot prove CH (assuming ZFC is consistent). Their
precise results are stated in Table 19. Note that, per the second incompleteness
theorem, the results are relative (“if this is consistent, so is that”) rather than

absolute (“such-and-such is consistent”). Gödel’s method of proof, with the so-
called inner model of constructible sets, establishes relative consistency not
only for CH but for a generalization GCH to be introduced in §8.3. Cohen’s
method of proof, that of so-called forcing, can be used to give a different proof
of relative consistency for CH as well as a proof of :CH: Both methods have
been found to have innumerable other applications and are absolutely central to
the ongoing work of set theorists today. While it would be infeasible to attempt
to expound these methods in any detail in a work such as this – they are not
covered even in the most thorough introductory-level texts – it will prove
possible to give some idea of their nature later.
Meanwhile let it be noted that either method can be used to prove the relative
consistency of :SH; as was done by Ronald Jensen using Gödel’s method and
by Thomas Jech and independently by Stanley Tennenbaum using Cohen’s
method. Further, Robert Solovay, among many other important early applica-
tions of Cohen’s method, used it in joint work with Tennenbaum to prove the
relative consistency of SH.
Although these methods originated to deal with problems at the level of the
theory of arbitrary sets of reals, they have also applications at other levels. In
particular, John W. Addison, using Gödel’s work, showed that regularity the-
orems cannot be extended to higher point classes than the classical workers
between the world wars had handled, while Azriel Levy, using Cohen’s method,
showed the same for structural theorems, thus explaining the impasse that had
been reached by the Polish and Russian schools.
All this means that, if regularity and/or structural theorems are to be obtained
for higher point classes, or if the status of SH and/or CH is ever to be settled,
new axioms beyond ZFC will be needed. Gödel and Cohen drew opposite
philosophical conclusions from this situation, Cohen doubting there was any
fact of the matter about whether CH is true, and Gödel (1947) advocating a
search for new axioms to prove or (as he thought more likely) disprove it. Thus
far, however, no hypothesis settling the size of c has acquired the status of an
accepted axiom, the way AC, after some resistance, eventually did. But a
vigorous research program continues, of which more later.

8.3 Combinatorial Set Theory
There are two propositions called the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH):
There is no cardinal λ with κ < λ < 2κ for any κ
2ℵα ¼ ℵαþ1 for all α.
As with CH, the second implies the ﬁrst and the ﬁrst implies the second
assuming AC; but, in fact, we can simply say they are equivalent, since a
striking result of Waclaw Sierpinski tells us the ﬁrst version implies AC. (See
Gillman 2002.) GCH is the main question of interest about the arithmetic of
arbitrary cardinals, and perhaps as such the main question of interest in the
theory of arbitrary sets of arbitrary elements. But it is hardly the only question of
interest, there being, to begin with, a large body of results constituting an
inﬁnitary combinatorics, related to transﬁnite arithmetic as ﬁnite combinatorics
(beginning with the highschool topic of counting permutations and combin-
ations) is related to ordinary arithmetic. As this subject may be unfamiliar even
at the level of the countable, let alone higher cardinals, let us begin with sample
theorems at that level.
First, a tree is a partial order (P, ≤) with a minimum element, in which the
predecessors of any element are wellordered. The elements are called nodes, the
minimal one the root, the order type of the predecessors of a node its level, and
the supremum of nodes’ levels the tree’s height. We will be concerned for the
moment only with trees of height ≤ω. A inﬁnite branch through such a tree is a
chain containing one node at level n for each n < ω.
König’s Inﬁnity Lemma Any ﬁnitely branching tree of inﬁnite height has an
inﬁnite branch.
Proof: If the tree has inﬁnite height, it has inﬁnitely many nodes, all above its
root x0. Since x0 has only ﬁnitely many nodes immediately above it, by the
“pigeon-hole principle” at least one such node x1 must have inﬁnitely many
nodes above it. Similarly, at least one node x2 immediately above x1 must have
inﬁnitely many nodes above it, and so on. Then x0; x1; x2; : : : g
f
is a branch.
Second, for any set X of more than two elements, ½X2 denotes the set of two-
element subsets of X. A two coloring for X is a partition of ½X2 into two cells.
We may think of the elements of X as dots with the segments connecting any
pair of them colored red or blue. A homogeneous set is a subset of Y of X such
that ½Y2 is included in a single cell of the partition. All dots in Y are connected
with the same color.
Inﬁnite Ramsey’s Theorem Any two coloring of an inﬁnite set has an inﬁnite
homogeneous set.

Proof: Consider the hypothesis (H) Any inﬁnite subset of X contains an element
red connected to inﬁnitely many other elements of that subset. First assume (H)
holds. Let X0 ¼ X and take an element a0 of X0 red connected to inﬁnitely many
elements of X0. Let X1 be the set of elements of X0 red connected to a0. Take an
element a1 of X1 red connected to inﬁnitely many elements of X1. Let X2 be the
set of elements of X1 red connected to a1. And so on.
a0; a1; : : :g
f
is a red
homogeneous set. Now assume (H) fails, so there is some inﬁnite subset Y0 of X
such that any element thereof is red connected to only ﬁnitely many elements
thereof, and hence is blue connected to inﬁnitely many. Take an element b0 of Y0
blue connected to inﬁnitely many elements of Y0. Let Y1 be the set of elements
of Y0 blue connected to b0. And so on, to obtain a blue homogeneous set.
Finite Ramsey’s Theorem For every ﬁnite m there is a ﬁnite n such that any
two coloring of a set of size n has a homogenous set of size m.
(For m ¼ 3 we may take n ¼ 6. Connect six dots red and blue and there will be a
red or a blue triangle.) Proof sketch: Suppose for some m there is no suitable n.
We form a ﬁnitely branching tree of conﬁgurations. At the root, there is just one
dot. Above it at the next level are two conﬁgurations, both adding a second dot,
but differing as to the color, red or blue, of its connection with the ﬁrst. Above
each are four conﬁgurations, each adding a third dot, but differing in the color
pattern of its connections, red-red or red-blue or blue-red or blue-blue with the
ﬁrst two. And so on. Now go through the tree removing conﬁgurations in which
there is a homogeneous set of size m (all conﬁgurations above one so removed
being removed along with it). Since there is no suitable n, there will still be
nodes at level n for all n. By König’s lemma, the tree must have an inﬁnite
branch. But from such a branch, we obtain a conﬁguration of inﬁnitely many
dots with no homogeneous set of size m and hence certainly no inﬁnite homo-
geneous set, contrary to the inﬁnite Ramsey theorem.
Both versions of Ramsey’s theorem can be generalized, to consider partitions
of n-membered subsets rather than two-membered, and to allow m colors rather
than two. The proof just given of the ﬁnite theorem is an example of a route to a
result about the ﬁnite with a detour through the inﬁnite. There are any number of
such proofs in mathematics, a famous one being the original proof by Pafnuty
Chebyshev of Bertrand’s postulate to the effect that there is a prime between
any prime and its double, which used complex analysis. The proof of Fermat’s
theorem by Andrew Wiles makes use of especially complicated apparatus.
Hilbert hoped it could be shown that detours through the inﬁnite can always
be avoided, and certainly they sometimes can. Ramsey’s original (1930) and
more difﬁcult proof of his ﬁnite theorem involved no inﬁnitistic moves. And
Srinivasa Ramanujan and Paul Erdös have each given “elementary” – meaning

in this context noninﬁnitistic, not easy – proofs of Bertrand’s postulate. There
remains hope also that someone, somewhere, sometime will obtain one for
Fermat’s theorem. But J. B. Paris and Leo Harrington found a version of the
ﬁnite Ramsey theorem “with bells and whistles” for which they could show the
detour through the inﬁnite to be indispensable.
One large class of results about arbitrary sets of arbitrary elements consists of
attempting to determine how far Ramsey’s theorem can be generalized: For
which cardinals κ; λ; μ; and natural numbers n, is it true that any partition of
the n-membered subsets of a set K of size κ into μ classes will have a homoge-
neous set of size λ, a subset L ⊆K of that size all of whose n-membered subsets
belong to the same class? This relationship is written κ →λ

μ: In this notation
the basic version of Ramsey’s theorem says ℵ0 →ℵ0

2: Perhaps the best
known further result of this type is that of Erdös and Richard Rado, according
to which the relation holds for κ ¼ cþ and λ ¼ ℵ1 and μ ¼ ℵ0 and n ¼ 2.
Issues about “partition calculus” are a prominent part of “inﬁnite combina-
torics” although hardly the whole. Before leaving the subject, let me list just a
few more results, whose proofs would take us too far aﬁeld here, to indicate the
variety of questions that arise in this area, and perhaps pique the interest of some
readers. (Hrbacek and Jech have especially good coverage for an introductory
text. See also Kunen (1977).)
Almost Disjoint Sets Call subsets of N almost disjoint if they have ﬁnite
intersection. Then there is a family of size c of pairwise almost disjoint sets.
Dickson’s Lemma Let k be a positive integer and consider a sequence of
k-tuples of natural numbers (am1; : : : amk) for m 2 N. Then there exist
m < n with ami ≤ani for i ¼ 1; : : : ; k.
The Δ System Lemma Let X be an uncountable family of ﬁnite sets of
countable ordinals. Then there is an uncountable subset Y of X and a ﬁnite set
a of countable ordinals such that b ∩c ¼ a for all b and c in Y.

ordinals with f α

9 Metamathematics of Set Theory
Since the ﬁrst development of non-Euclidean geometry, the standard way of
proving consistency has been by constructing models, and the novelty in Gödel’s
and Cohen’s work consisted precisely of new methods of model construction. Now
since the existence of a model implies consistency, we cannot prove in ZFC the
existence of a model for all of ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent, a parenthetical

proviso left tacit henceforth). But there provably are models for large fragments,
especially among the VðαÞ, sometimes called “natural” models. Before examining
these we need to say what more precisely is meant by a “model,” which will involve
examination of what is meant by “truth” and related notions, dodging paradoxes
connected with such notions since antiquity.
9.1 Truth
Wemaybeginwithamodern,speciﬁcallyset-theoreticparadox.Sincethereareonly
countably many ﬁnite sequences of symbols from a ﬁnite alphabet, there are only
countably many ordinals deﬁnable by ﬁnite expressions. But there are uncountably
many ordinals, so there must be undeﬁnable ones, and among these a least. But that
one is deﬁnable as the least undeﬁnable ordinal. Such is König’s paradox. One
response is that in speaking of deﬁnability we must say in what language, and if it is
that of set theory, what the argument shows is that set-theoretic deﬁnability is not set
theoretically deﬁnable. But if set theory is supposed to accommodate everything
mathematical, ought it not to accommodate deﬁning deﬁnability? The response
“that’s not mathematics, it’s metamathematics” underwhelms.
Better to focus on what is deﬁnable. If mathematical logic is to be accommodated
like other branches of mathematics within set theory, the objects of the language L
of set theory must be identiﬁed with sets of some kind. Well, proofs are ﬁnite
sequences of formulas, and formulas are ﬁnite sequences of symbols, and ﬁnite
sequence is already a set-theoretic notion, so it remains only to identify symbols
with sets. Epsilon and equals, the bar and caret and wedge of negation and
conjunction and disjunction, the universal and existential quantiﬁers, and opening
and closing parentheses for punctuation may be identiﬁed with the pairs (0, 1)
through (0, 9). We also need variables x, y, z, .. ., and these can be identiﬁed with
pairs (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), .. . . Once it is clear we are dealing with a mathematical
“language” and not natural languages, there is no reason not to expand it indeﬁn-
itely to a language adding a name a for every set a. The details of how to deﬁne
such syntactic notions as substitution of one symbol for another when logic is
reconstructed set theoretically need not detain us any more than how to deﬁne
exponentiation when reconstructing analysis. It can be done, but not here.
The notion of truth is “semantic” rather than syntactic, and cannot be
expressed in L, since if it could, so could the derivative notion of deﬁnability:
a is deﬁnable if there is some formula ΦðxÞ of L such that the sentence
8xðΦ x
ð Þ ↔x ¼ aÞ, identifying the item named a as the only one satisfying
condition Φ, is true. And if the notion of deﬁnability could be expressed in L, we
would have König’s paradox. A notion of truth in a model is, however, express-
ible in L, and will be key. A model for present purposes will be a structure

M ¼ M; 2
ð
Þ with M transitive, but while model and underlying set should be
distinguished in principle, “abuse of language” can be allowed in practice, and
the key notion of a sentence (formula without free variables) Φ of the language
L(M) with names (only) for elements of M being true in the model will be called
truth in M and written Mj¼ Φ. The accepted treatment derives from Tarski and
Vaught (1956) based on earlier work of Tarski. To begin with, we characterize it
recursively in the adjoining Table 20.
The clauses for ¼; ˅; ∃are left to the reader. The characterizations provided
by Table 20 can be made into an honest deﬁnition as was done for natural
numbers in §5.3 (deﬁning a good function, and so on). What is being deﬁned is
the function τðΦÞ ¼ 1 or 0 according as Φ is true or false in M, for sentences Φ
of L(M). If we tried to imitate the construction to deﬁne simple truth (in the
universe of set theory, not just a model) for a sentence we would need a function
like τ but deﬁned on all sentences however high the rank of items named in
them. But these are too many to form a set. Yet we can go some way towards
deﬁning truth by restricting the logical complexity of the sentences involved. A

Δ0 formula is one that can be abbreviated to contain only bounded quantiﬁers,
universal and existential, 8y 2 x and ∃y 2 x as deﬁned in Table 7 in §2.2. Many
notions can be expressed by such formulas, and a few are shown in the adjoining
Table 21. One could add “x is a partition” and “y is a selector for x” and more,
but not “x is countable” or “x ¼ PðyÞ,” which require unbounded quantiﬁers,
existential and universal, ∃y and 8y, respectively.
A crucial property of a Δ0 sentences is absoluteness. If M0 and M1 are
transitive and Φ a Δ0 sentence of L M0
ð
Þ ∩LðM1Þ, then M0j ¼ Φ iff M1j¼ Φ.
For while with an unbounded universal quantiﬁer, when evaluating it per clause
(4a) in Mi one has to look for a possible exception throughout (although not
beyond) Mi, and there may be one in M0 but not Mi, by contrast with a bounded
universal quantiﬁer 8x 2 a one only needs to look at elements of a in M0 and in
Mi, and these are the same, namely all elements of a, by transitivity. Similarly
with existential quantiﬁers. Thus a model cannot “make a mistake” about
whether a Δ0 sentence is true, about whether the item named a is or is not the
empty set, or whether the item named b is or is not the unordered pair of those
named c and d, and so on down the list in in the table. We may therefore deﬁne
Δ0 truth (truth for Δ0 sentences) as truth in some, or equivalently every, model
containing all items named in the sentence.
A P
1 or 1 formula is a Δ0 formula with an unbounded existential or
universal quantiﬁer out front, or a string of them (although in examples just
one will be written). Suppose M0 and M1 are transitive with M0 ⊆M1. If a P
1
sentence ∃yΦðyÞ of LðM0Þ is true in M0, then there is some “witness” b in M0
such that ΦðbÞ is true in M0, and ΦðbÞ being a Δ0 sentence it will still be true in
M1, as then will be ∃yΦðyÞ. P
1 sentences “relativize up” from smaller to larger
models, while similarly 1 sentences “relativize down.” We may deﬁne P
1
truth (respectively 1 truth) as truth in some model (respectively all models).
Continuing, adding alternate universal and existential quantiﬁers, we can deﬁne
the Levy hierarchy of P
n and n formulas for all n, with truth notions for each.
The truth deﬁnitions get longer as n gets larger. So, although every formula can
be reduced to a logically equivalent formula that is P
n using simple logical
equivalences, and called P
n in a generalized sense, we cannot use this fact to
deﬁne truth, since we would have to combine the P
n truth deﬁnitions into a
single inﬁnitely long deﬁnition.
Truth-in-a-model will imply real P
1 truth, and real 1 truth will imply truth-in-a-
model, but not always conversely. A model may “think” something is the uncount-
able PðωÞ, or family of all subsets of ω, when it is really only some countable
family of subsets of ω, making this mistake because all in the model is not the same
as all. As a consequence of a famous result of mathematical logic, the Löwenheim-
Skolem Theorem, that any sentence or countable set of sentences has a model has a

countable model. Applied to ZFC (assuming it has a model, which recall cannot be
proved, since having a model implies consistency, which cannot be proved), this
tells us that theorems about the existence of enormous uncountable sets have
countable models, an observation often called Skolem’s paradox. (See Skolem
1922/1967.) We have just seen the explanation, but some philosophers still worry
how anything we say could guarantee that when we utter “the power set of omega”
we are talking of the real PðωÞ and not a countable imposter of which the things we
are saying happen to be true in some model. See Putnam (1980).
9.2 Inaccessible Cardinals and Their Status
By the informal phrase “large cardinal” set theorists mean a cardinal that towers
above all smaller ones in something like the way the inﬁnite towers over the
ﬁnite. To be counted by set theorists as “large,” a cardinal κ must be a limit,
meaning that if λ < κ; then λþ < κ; and even a strong limit, meaning that
2λ < κ: It must also be regular, meaning that a union of < κ sets of size < κ
has size < κ. A regular strong limit is called an inaccessible (because it cannot
be reached from below by the most common methods of producing larger sets
from smaller), and these are the smallest large cardinals, ﬁrst considered by
Zermelo (1930) and independently of him by Sierpinski jointly with Tarski. We
will meet others later.
But let us ﬁrst see what is special about inaccessibles.
The
axiom
of
extensionality,
in
the
form
(2)
of
§3.1,
8x8y
ðx ⊆y ∧y ⊆x  x ¼ yÞ, is 1 and true, hence true in any model; and the same
goes for foundation. The truth of other axioms in a model M requires some
“closure” properties of the underlying set M. The truth of pairing in M requires
that for every a and b in M there is a c in M that M “thinks” is a; bg
f
. But since
this is one of those Δ0 matters about which a model cannot be mistaken, this
means that for every a and b in M, the real
a; bg
f
is in M, a feature called
“closure under forming pairs.” Similarly, the truth of union is equivalent to
closure under forming unions. Inﬁnity may be alternately formulated as
∃ðx ¼ ωÞ, making its truth in M equivalent to presence of the real ω in M.
While “partition” and “selector” are not in Table 21 of §9.1, these notions are
Δ0, implying choice will be true in M if every partition in M has a selector in M.
Power set requires that for every a in M there be some b in M that M
thinks is P a
ð Þ, which means that for all c in M, c is in b if c is a subset of
a, which, in turn, means that really b is PM a
ð Þ ¼ P a
ð Þ ∩M. Closure under
PM is the criterion for truth of the axiom. If the model is supertransitive,
containing all subsets of its elements, then PM a
ð Þ ¼ P a
ð Þ and the criterion
is closure under P. Separation is more complicated. By the relativization ΦM of

a formula Φ to M is meant the replacement of every quantiﬁer 8x or ∃x by
8x 2 M or ∃x 2 M. Truth of a sentence Φ in M is equivalent to truth of the Δ0
sentence ΦM. Truth in M of instance of separation for Φ requires for each a in M
the presence in M of
x 2 ajΦM x
ð Þg
f
⊆a. A more than sufﬁcient condition is
supertransitivity.
The VðαÞ are supertransitive, and considerations of rank show that for limit α
they are closed under formation of pairs, unions, and power sets, besides
containing ω provided α > ω, and a selector for any partition, assuming AC.
Thus for limits > ω we get a model of everything but replacement. A more than
sufﬁcient condition for replacement would be that any subset of M of the same
cardinality as some element of M is an element of M. This condition is satisﬁed
if α ¼ κ, an inaccessible cardinal, since it can be proved by induction for such a
cardinal that jjVðβÞjj < κ whenever β < κ (using the strong limit property for
successors and regularity for limits). Thus we have (a sketch of) a proof that if κ
is inaccessible, then VðκÞ is a model of ZFC.
If we write IC for the hypothesis of the existence of an inaccessible, we have in
outline proved IC  Con ZFC
ð
Þ. This means that, in contrast to the situation with
CH seen in Table 19 of §8.2, we cannot hope to prove Con ZFC
ð
Þ
 Con ZFC þ IC
ð
Þ, because then in ZFC þ IC we could prove Con ZFC þ IC
ð
Þ,
contrary to the second incompleteness theorem unless ZFC þ IC is inconsistent –
and no one hopes that. This illustrates how large cardinal axioms are inherently
risky. One cannot hope to prove even their relative consistency. Their greater
inconsistency risk is (euphemistically) called greater consistency strength, and the
larger the cardinal, the greater it is. The hypotheses get riskier and riskier until we
come to the so-called Reinhardt cardinal, the assumption of whose existence
Kenneth Kunen showed to imply a contradiction.
A brief polemical aside (see Maddy (2017) for nuance, Mathias (1992) for
contrast): Saunders Mac Lane introduced category theory alongside group theory
and so on as the theory of another class of set-theoretic structures. But enthusiasts
have proclaimed it a rival to set theory as a “foundation.” What seems to be
involved here is a difference in understanding of the word “foundation,” which
anyhow has been avoided above in favor of “framework.” An attempt was made
to develop an axiom system for a category of all categories, to replace ZFC. It
failed. A translation of ZFC into category-theoretic language has been developed,
but the translation has not helped with major set-theoretic open problems. But to
accentuate the positive, category-theoretic work of Alexandre Grothendieck,
partly passed into folklore, led him to posit that the universe of set theory is
made up of larger and larger “local” universes, which on examination prove to be
precisely VðκÞ for inaccessible κ. Thus he found a way to motivate the Zermelo’s
assumption that there are arbitrarily large inaccessible cardinals.

Others have argued that the thought that the cumulative hierarchy is maximally
“large” should be interpreted to suggest that anything we say in an attempt to
describe just how large will inevitably be an understatement, not only true in the
macrocosm of all sets, but “reﬂected” in some microcosm VðκÞ. In something like
this way, “intrinsic” motivations – as contrasted with “extrinsic” motivation
provided by attractive consequences – has been claimed for inaccessible and
some larger cardinals by Bernays, Levy, and others and others. Koellner (2009) is
a sophisticated discussion of how far one can hope to go along such lines.
A less ambitious version of this idea is provable as a metatheorem about what
is provable in ZFC, the Levy Reﬂection Principle. A transitive set M is Σ 1
absolute if every Σ 1 sentence of LðMÞ that is true is true in M: For any Δ0
formula Φ x; y
ð
Þ of L, and any a in M, if ∃yΦða; yÞ is true, so that there is a
witness b somewhere for which Φða; bÞ is true, then there is such a witness in M,
making ∃yΦða; yÞ true in M. Then we have the following:
Σ 1 Reﬂection Principle There exist arbitrarily large Σ 1 absolute VðαÞ.
Given any γ, to any Δ0 formula Φ x; y
ð
Þ and any a in VðγÞ for which ∃yΦða; yÞ is
true, associate the least ordinal β such that there is a witness in VðβÞ. Replacement
allows us to form the set of all such associated ordinals, and then take their
supremum γ > γ. All Σ 1 sentences about elements of VðγÞ that are really true
will be true in VðγÞ. There may be Σ 1 sentences about elements of VðγÞ that are
really true but not true in VðγÞ, but we can repeat the process and take γ > γ
and γ > γ, and so on. Then the supremum α of these γs is Σ 1 absolute. More
elaborate proofs extend the result to Σ 2; Σ 3, and so on. We can get a natural
model VðαÞ of all the other axioms of ZFC plus as many instances of replacement
as desired.
9.3 Inner Models and the Status of AC
While Gödel’s original proof of the relative consistency of AC and CH is too
complicated to reproduce here, for AC alone he later published a simpliﬁed proof,
which can at least be outlined. AC has so far been used in our discussion of
models where proving that AC is true in VðαÞ, but nowhere else. In the present
discussion, let the assumption of AC be dropped, and work in ZF, Zermelo–
Fraenkel set theory without choice. Relativization ΦΨ to a formula Ψ is the result
of each 8y . . . being replaced by 8yðΨ y
ð Þ  . . .Þ, and similarly for ∃, so that “for
all sets” is reinterpreted as “for all sets for which Ψ holds,” and similarly for
“some.” (Compare with the notion of relativization to a set M in §9.2.) Gödel’s
simpliﬁed proof the relative consistency of AC consisted in showing that for a
suitable Ψ one can prove in ZF the relativization ΦΨ of each axiom Φ of ZF, as

well as the relativization ACΨ of AC. Relativization preserves logical deduci-
bility, and if a contradiction were deducible from the axioms of ZFC, one would
be deducible from their relativizations, and hence from the axioms of ZF which
imply those relativizations. It follows that if ZF is consistent, so is ZFC. But it will
take some work to spell out what is Gödel’s relativizing formula ΨðxÞ, called
HODðxÞ and read “x is hereditarily ordinal deﬁnable.”
A set a is deﬁnable from an ordinal parameter or ordinal deﬁnable, or OD for
short if there is some formula Φ x; y
ð
Þ of L and some ordinal α such that
8xðΦðx; α_Þ ≡x ¼ aÞ is true. This formulation, in terms of truth, is not express-
ible in L, although OD-in-a-model and Σ n OD would be, using restricted
notions of truth. Gödel’s trick is to show that there is a (comparatively small)
n such that anything OD is Σ n OD, allowing (an equivalent of) OD to be
expressed in L after all. To see this, suppose a is OD in the way indicated, by a
Σ k formula for some perhaps quite large k and some ordinal α. There are only
countably many formulas of L and they can be assigned code numbers. Writing
Ψj for the formula with code number j, we will have Φ ¼ Ψi for some i. Apply
the reﬂection principle to obtain a Σ k absolute β > α. We then have this:
ð1Þ
VðβÞ j ¼ 8xðΨiðx; αÞ ≡x ¼ aÞ:
In the proof of κ  κ ¼ κ for all alephs κ, we saw how to code pairs of ordinals
by single ordinals, and this obviously permits the coding of triples as well. Let γ
code the triple ðβ; α; iÞ. Then we have Θða; γÞ where this says:
ð2Þ
γ codes a triple ðβ; α; iÞ with β > α and i < ω such that 1
ð Þ holds:
Then if Θðy; zÞ is Σ n, (2) shows that a is Σ n OD from parameter γ. The least
δ such that a is OD by this Σ n formula Θ from parameter δ may be called the
deﬁning ordinal ∂a
ð Þ of a. So a is OD if ∃δðδ ¼ ∂a
ð ÞÞ, and this δ is necessarily
unique if it exists. We may deﬁne a wellorder on OD sets by a <OD b if
∂a
ð Þ < ∂b
ð Þ. And the notions OD and <OD are expressible by formulas not
much worse than Σ n. Call a hereditarily OD or HOD if not only a itself but
every other member of its transitive closure a† is OD. HOD(x) is Gödel’s
relativizing formula promised earlier.
The details of the proof that the relativization of each axiom of ZF to HOD is
a theorem of ZF will not be given in this sketch. Note that HOD is transitive in
the sense that if HOD(x) and y 2 x, then HOD(y). One then makes use of the
criteria from §9.2 immediately above for axioms holding relativized to a
transitive set, adapted to relativization to the transitive condition HOD. For
instance, one must show that if a and b are HOD, so is a; bg
f
. The only element
of a; bg†
f
not in a† or b† is a; bg

itself, so we need only worry about showing

it is OD given that a and b are. The principle at work in showing this is that
anything deﬁnable from OD sets (as a pair is deﬁnable from its elements) is OD.
Since different ordinals α and β may be needed to deﬁne a and b, to deﬁne the
pair we need to use the coding of pairs of ordinals by single ordinals. As for
ACHOD, it will come down to showing that any OD partition has an OD selector.
The selector will be the one including the <OD least element of each cell. If the
foregoing rather sketchy sketch does nothing else, it should illustrate the
sophistication that Gödel brought to the metamathematics of set theory, which
was then taken a step further by Cohen.
A by-product of this work is the observation that, because statements of
number theory and ﬁnite combinatorics can all be formulated so as to mention
only elements of VðωÞ, all of which are HOD, such a statement has the same
meaning whether or not relativized to HOD. From this it follows that if it such a
statement is provable assuming AC, it is provable without it. The same is known
to hold for CH and any other hypotheses for which relative consistency has been
proved. In contrast, large cardinal axioms, for which relative consistency cannot
be proved, deﬁnitely make a difference. For instance, they imply Con(ZFC),
which can be coded as a number-theoretic or ﬁnite-combinatorial statement. To
be sure, as such it is rather artiﬁcial, and not something whose proof or disproof
would be high up on any number theorist’s or ﬁnite combinatorialist’s research
program. But for decades Harvey Friedman has been producing more and more
natural-looking examples, though the long-await deﬁnitive exposition of his
results, working title Concrete Incompleteness, must be awaited a bit longer,
while preprints on particular aspects accumulate.
We can now say something about Gödel’s proof of the consistency of CH (and
GCH). A formula Θ amounts to, or the sets satisfying it collectively amount to –
for both modes of expression are in use – an inner model of ZFC or some related
set theory T if it shares three crucial properties established above for HOD.
Every ordinal satisﬁes Θ.
Θ is transitive: Every element of a set satisfying Θ satisﬁes Θ.
Every axiom of T remains true when quantiﬁers are relativized to Θ.
Gödel’s original proof worked, not with the inner model HOD, but with
another called L, whose deﬁnition is more delicate, giving more control of the
outcome. It is, in particular, the minimum inner model: any sets present in it, that
is, any sets satisfying its deﬁning formula, must be present in any other inner
model. The sets in L are called constructible and the inner model itself is called
the constructible universe. Gödel shows that, in the constructible universe, the
principle that every set is constructible, written V ¼ L and called the axiom of
constructibility, holds. (This is not a tautology: it says that if a set satisﬁes the

formula deﬁning constructibility, then it also satisﬁes that formula when quan-
tiﬁers are relativized to L.) He then proceeds to show that V ¼ L implies AC,
and CH, and indeed GCH. The facts have already been alluded to that Addison
went on to prove that V ¼ L implies the existence of non-Lebesgue-measurable
PCA and CPCA sets, and that Jensen later proved that it implies ¬SH (along
with a lot of other combinatorial results), through an analysis of the so-called
ﬁne structure of L.
For another example of a proof by inner models, long before Cohen,
Fraenkel, and Andrzej Mostowski in the 1920s and 1930s, considered the
question of the consistency of ¬AC in the context of a modiﬁcation ZFU of
ZF that permits Urelemente, or atoms as they are sometimes called. In formu-
lating ZFU, it is necessary to add a predicate meaning “is a set” and restrict the
axiom of extensionality to sets, while asserting that non-sets or atoms all have
no elements. In the Fraenkel–Mostowski work, we need a version of ZFU
asserting that there are inﬁnitely many atoms. They then prove Con(ZFU)
implies Con ZFU þ :AC
ð
Þ by an inner model construction. Their methods
can also be applied to distinguish various stronger and weaker variants of AC.
The key idea is that any permutation π of the atoms determines a permutation,
by abuse of language also denoted π, of sets of atoms, and then of sets who
elements may be atoms or sets of atoms, and so on up the cumulative hierarchy,
the general pattern being π x
ð Þ ¼ π y
ð Þj y 2 xg
f
. If Φðx; yÞ is the formula y 2 x, it
is evident that for any a and b, the formula Φða; bÞ is true if and only if
ΦðπðaÞ; πðbÞÞ is true, and this can be extended by induction on complexity to
all formulas: in a slogan, “permutation preserves truth.” We then deﬁne a set x to
be of ﬁnite support (FS) if there is some ﬁnite set of atoms X such that any
permutation that leaves the elements of X ﬁxed, meaning πðyÞ ¼ y for all y in X,
will also leave x ﬁxed. Then just as Gödel moves from OD to HOD we move
from FS to HFS, the inner model of sets x such that x itself, its elements,
elements of its elements, and so on down are all of ﬁnite support. Then
considerations of the kind used in the HOD proof show that HFS is an inner
model of ZFU. But it cannot be a model of AC, since AC implies every set can
be ordered (indeed, well ordered), but no order R of the whole inﬁnite set of
atoms can have ﬁnite support. For given any ﬁnite set X of atoms, take any
atoms a and b not in it, with say ða; bÞ 2 R, implying ðb; aÞ =2 R, and consider the
permutation π that just switches those atoms, so that π applied to the pair ða; bÞ
is the pair ðb; aÞ. Then the π changes the truth ða; bÞ 2 R into ðb; aÞ 2 πðRÞ,
implying R 6¼ πðRÞ. While Gödel’s proof of consistency for CH involves
further elaboration beyond his proof of consistency for AC, with Cohen the
proof of the consistency of ¬AC is more complicated than his proof of

consistency for ¬CH, since he must combine his machinery of forcing with the
ideas of Fraenkel–Mostowski to establish for ZF what they establish for ZFU.
9.4 Forcing and the Status of CH
Any account of Cohen’s forcing in a work at the elementary level of the present
one will have to be even sketchier than the sketch of Gödel’s inner models just
given; yet something can be said that it is hoped will give at least a taste of the
ﬂavor of forcing constructions. While Gödel started with the universe V of all
sets and contracted to an inner universe where CH is true, Cohen could not start
with the universe Vof all sets and expand to an outer universe where CH is false,
since there is no room for an outer universe containing more sets than all the sets
there are. His procedure had of necessity to be a bit more indirect. What he did
was to start from a countable transitive model M of ZFC, and expand to an outer
countable transitive model N where CH is false. Now ZFC, as already remarked
earlier, cannot prove the existence of a model of ZFC, let alone of a countable
transitive model. However, close inspection of Cohen’s work shows that the
truth of any ﬁnite subset of ZFC + ¬CH in N requires only the truth of some
ﬁnite subset of ZFC in M, and this fact, together with some logician’s tricks,
permits one to conclude that if ZFC is consistent, so is ZFC þ –CH. But in
attempting to understand something about Cohen’s method, it is best to concen-
trate on the model construction, and leave the trickery needed to extract a
relative consistency proof to the logicians.
The central notions used in forcing are, like those used in formulating Zorn’s
lemma in §7.2, some further items to be added to the list of basic notions
pertaining to partial orders given in §4.3. If ðP; ≤Þ is a partial order, a subset
D ⊆P is called dense if for every p in P there is a q ≤p in D. Two elements p, q of
P are compatible if there is an r in P with both r ≤p and r ≤q. A subset A ⊆P is
an antichain if no two of its members are compatible, and P is ccc (or satisﬁes
the countable chain condition) if it has no uncountable antichains. Finally, a
subset G ⊆P is generic for a family F of dense sets if it satisﬁes the following:
Whenever p 2 G and p ≤q, then q 2 G.
Any two elements of G are compatible.
For every D 2 F, there is a p 2 G with p 2 D (so that G ∩D is nonempty).
Note that for any countable F ¼ D0; D1; D2; . . .g
f
there exists a generic G.
Just take any p0 in D0, then any p1 ≤p0 in D1, then any p2 ≤p1 in D2, and so on,
and for G take the set of q such that for some n we have pn ≤q. In particular, if P
belongs to the countable model M, the set F of all its dense subsets that belong to
M is countable, and there is a generic set G for it. This G, however, in general

will not itself be in M. What Cohen shows is that there is a minimum countable
transitive model N ¼ M½G containing all the elements of M and G as well.
For his application to CH, or rather ¬CH, Cohen considers the ordinals α and
β in M that M “thinks” areא1 andא2. Really they are both countable, and there is
a surjection f from ω onto α and a surjection g from α onto β; it is just that there
are no such f and g in the model M. For his set P of “forcing conditions,” he takes
all functions whose domain is a ﬁnite set of pairs ðγ; mÞ with γ < β and m < ω,
and whose values are all 0s and 1s. The partial order relation ≤on P is just the
reverse of set-theoretic inclusion ⊆, so q ≤p if the former is a function extend-
ing the latter to a larger domain, and two “conditions” p and q are compatible if
there is no pair in the domain of both on which they give different values, so that
their union is still a function. For any pair ðγ; mÞ, the set Dðγ; mÞ of p with that
pair in its domain is dense: if ðγ; mÞ is not already given a value by p, we can
extend p to give it one. Similarly, for any γ 6¼ δ the set Eðγ; δÞ of p for which
there is an m with pðγ; mÞ 6¼ pðδ; mÞ is dense. These dense sets are all in M,
and Cohen takes a G generic for the family of all of them to form his M[G]. By
the compatibility of all elements of a generic set, the functions in G ﬁt together
to form a big function g, which by the fact that G has nonempty intersection with
each dense Dðγ; mÞ must have each ðγ; mÞ with γ < β and m < ω in its domain.
Considering the Eðγ; δÞ it also follows that for any distinct γ; δ < β there is an
m with gðγ; mÞ 6¼ gðδ; mÞ. In other words, ﬁxing γ and considering the inﬁnite
zero-one sequence ðgðγ; 0Þ; gðγ; 1Þ; gðγ; 2Þ; . . .Þ we get different sequences
for different γ, and so a sequence of length β of distinct zero-one sequences.
Since c is the number of zero-one sequences, and β was playing the role of
א2, have we now shown the existence of a model with c ≥א2?
Alas, not quite. For we need to show that β, which was theא2 of M, remains
theא2 of M½G, which in turn requires that α, which was theא1 of M, remains the
א1 of M½G; or, in other words, we need to show that no surjection from ω onto α
or from α onto β has slipped into M½G. This is the most technical part of the
proof, and will be slighted here. Let it just be noted that it uses the fact that the
partial order P is ccc (the proof of which uses the Δ system lemma from the end
of §8.3).
The Solovay–Tennenbaum forcing for SH was much more complicated,
essentially involving performing one Cohen-style extension after another in
an inﬁnite iteration. D. A. Martin and Solovay (1970) extracted from the proof a
principle that has come to be called Martin’s axiom (MA), producing a proof of
the relative consistency of :CH þ MA, as well as a proof that ¬CH þ MA
implies SH. MA says that if a partial order P has no uncountable antichain, then
for any family F of fewer than c dense sets there exists a generic set G for F.
Note that CH implies MA, since assuming CH “fewer than c” amounts to

“countably many,” and we have seen that generic sets for countable families of
dense sets always exist. Martin and Solovay report that, of the consequences of
CH in the Sierpinski book, about half are provable from MA alone, and about
half disprovable from MA þ :CH, with a few left open. A particularly import-
ant example in the former category is the following. One of the most basic
results of Lebesgue’s theory of measure is that the union of countably many sets
of measure zero still has measure zero, which assuming CH means that the
union of fewer than c sets of measure zero still has measure zero. But this last
result actually follows without CH just from MA.
Many further applications of MA have been found, not to mention applica-
tions of the more general method of forcing that produced it. (See Rudin (1977)
and Burgess (1977) for examples: the volume from which these papers come
emphasizes exposition for mathematicians who are not logicians or set theoreti-
cians.) MA is the premier example of what is called a “forcing axiom” or
principle saying that various kinds of thing that could be made true by
Cohen’s method already are true. (It was shown by Jouko Väänänen and
Jonathan Stavi in the 1970s to follow from the principle that any statement of
a certain form that can be made true by ccc forcing and cannot then be made
false by further ccc forcing is true, which has been independently discovered or
rediscoverd by others since.) Saharon Shelah initiated the study of stronger
forcing axioms than MA + ¬CH, and in particular of ones that imply not just c 6¼
א1 but c =א2. The strongest principle in this direction has been called Martin’s
Maximum (MM), although its authors are not Martin but Matthew Foreman,
Menachem Magidor, and Shelah. It has a wealth of consequences.
10 Large Cardinals and Determinacy
We turn next to the surprising connections that emerged, mainly in the 1970s
and 1980s, between descriptive set theory, the theory of special sets of real
numbers, and large cardinal theory, the loftiest part of the theory of arbitrary sets
of arbitrary elements.
10.1 Beyond Inaccessibles
We have so far had occasion to mention (in §8.3) only the weakest large cardinal
assumption, that of the existence of inaccessibles, which we called IC. But there
is a zoo of large cardinals that are larger than inaccessibles, with more and
stranger inhabitants than the zoo of fundamental particles in physics. Akihiro
Kanamori (2003) provides a guide, which I cite as a one-stop source in prefer-
ences to the original papers of various authors. Four out of the many species of

larger cardinals will have some degree of importance in what is to follow, and at
least their names will be noted here in one place.
Weakly compact cardinals, introduced by Ersös and Tarski, are ones for which
the analogue of the most basic form of Ramsey’s theorem holds, one for which
we have κ →ðκÞ2
2 in the notation of §8.3.
Measurable cardinals, introduced by Stanislaw Ulam, are perhaps worth a
few more extended remarks. In many cases, it is possible to distinguish among
the subsets of some inﬁnite set X of some cardinality κ certain ones that are in
some sense large, and certain others that are in a corresponding sense small,
where the two classes have the following properties:
(1) The complement of a small set is large and the complement of a large set is
small.
(2) A one-element set is small and an all-but-one-element set is large.
(3) Any set included in a small set is small and any set including a large set is large.
(4) Any union of < κ small sets is small and any intersection of < κ large sets
is large.
For example, if X is the unit interval ]0,1[ and κ the continuum c, then taking the
Lebesgue measure 0 sets as small and the Lebesgue measure 1 sets as large, with
have (1)-(3), and (4) also if MA is assumed. What we do not have in this example is
this:
(5) Every set is either large or small.
For even apart from the question of the existence of nonmeasurable sets, there
are many subsets of the unit interval of measure ½ or otherwise of intermediate
size. If we do in some case get all of (1)-(5) we have in κ a measurable cardinal.
The deﬁnition (1)-(5) could also be recast in terms of the measure function μ
deﬁned by μ A
ð Þ ¼ 1 if A is large and μ A
ð Þ ¼ 0 if A is small.
Woodin cardinals, named for their introducer Hugh Woodin, have a deﬁnition
too complicated to be reproduced here.
Supercompact cardinals likewise. One of these is used in a relative consist-
ency proof for MM.
As we go down the list, the cardinals are getting larger. It can be shown that if
κ is weakly compact, then there are κ many inaccessible cardinals < κ. Similar
relations obtain between weakly compact and measurable, and so on.
10.2 Inﬁnite Games
We return to descriptive set theory to consider a rival to AC. By basic results in
the Kuratowski book and elsewhere, many results established for any one Polish

space will carry over to all others, and for many purposes it is easier to work
with an alternative to R, either the Baire space NN of inﬁnite sequences of
natural numbers, which looks just like the irrationals (using continued fraction
expansions), or the Cantor space 2N of inﬁnite zero-one sequences, which looks
just like the famous Cantor middle-third set (the reals in the unit interval having
a base-three expansion involving only digits 0 and 2). For any ﬁnite sequence s,
of natural numbers or of zeros and ones, let U sð Þ be the set of inﬁnite sequences
beginning like s. These are the basic sets of the Baire and Cantor spaces,
comparable to open intervals with rational endpoints in R, in terms of which
other point classes of Borel and projective sets can be deﬁned.
The Polish school initiated study of inﬁnite games of perfect information of
the following kind. Let A be a subset of the Baire space. Two players, IN and
OUT alternately pick natural numbers, each knowing at each stage the other’s
previous picks, thus generating an inﬁnite sequence x in the Baire space. IN
wins if x 2 A, OUT wins if x =2 A. (IN goes ﬁrst, like white in chess or black in
go.) A strategy is a function from ﬁnite sequences of natural numbers to natural
numbers. A player follows a strategy S in a play of the game if that player’s
move is always the output of S for input the opponent’s sequence of previous
moves. A strategy is winning for a given player if that player always wins when
following it. Clearly both players cannot have winning strategies. If one or the
other does, the game and the set A are called determinate. The Axiom of
Determinacy (AD) asserts that all sets are determinate.
AD is known to imply certain regularity properties hold for all sets (such as
Lebesgue measurability, for which see Mycielski and Swierczkowski, 1964). A
notable such result is the following from Morton Davis (1964).
Davis Theorem Assuming AD, all sets have the perfect set property.
Proof-sketch: The proof will be given for the Cantor space, but the result holds
for all Polish spaces. Given a subset A of the Cantor space, consider a game that
is asymmetrical in the sense that the two players make different kinds of moves:
alternately IN picks ﬁnite zero-one sequences and OUT picks single digits zero
or one. Their picks are strung together to produce an element x, of the Cantor
space, with IN or OUT winning according as x is or is not in A. AD implies the
determinateness of this game. Now suppose IN has a winning strategy S. The
element of A obtained when IN follows S is different for each sequence of plays
by OUT, showing A has c elements. A closer look shows that the set of such
elements is perfect. Now suppose OUT has a winning strategy and consider any
element x of A. See how far the beginning of x can be divided up into alternating
ﬁnite zero-one sequences followed by the single digit that would be given by S if
OUT were following that strategy. The whole of x cannot be divided up in this

way, since then it would represent the result of OUT following S for the whole
course of play, which would mean that x is not in A. So suppose we get this far,
then are stuck:
s0; i0; s1; i1; . . . ; sn; in:
What is the next digit j0 in x beyond those in this ﬁnite display of data? Since
we are supposed to be stuck, it is not what S would tell OUT to play in response
to IN’s playing the empty sequence, but rather the opposite. What is the next
digit j1 after that? The opposite of what S would tell OUT to play if IN played the
one-term sequence ð j0Þ. What is the next digit j3 after that? The opposite of what
S would tell OUT to play if IN played the two-term sequence ð j0; j1Þ. And so on.
All the digits of x are thus generated in terms of S from the ﬁnite pattern
displayed. Since there are only countably many such patterns, there are only
countably many elements x of A.
Since we have seen that assuming AC there are sets that do not have the
perfect set property, the Davis theorem shows that AD contradicts AC, though
the weaker DC is often assumed in conjunction with AD when considering its
consequences. The existence of an indeterminate set could also be proved
directly assuming AC, by a construction just like that used to prove the exist-
ence of a set lacking the perfect set property. The weaker projective determinacy
(PD) asserts only the determinateness of projective sets. But that is enough to
imply (by much the same proof) that all of those have the perfect set property.
PD similarly implies other regularity properties (including Lebesgue measur-
ability). How far can we go in proving determinateness for Borel and projective
sets? Here is the ﬁrst step:
Gale-Stewart Theorem All open sets are determinate.
Proof-sketch: We continue working with the Cantor space, but the argument
would be the same for the Baire space. Let A be an open subset of the Cantor
space, meaning a union of basic sets UðsÞ. Then if a play of the game results in a
win for IN by generating an x in A, x will belong to some UðsÞ included in A. But
it takes only ﬁnitely many rounds of picks by the two players to generate s, and
that means that by some ﬁnite stage IN will have, in effect, already won. Now
suppose there is no winning strategy for IN. Call a position after ﬁnitely many
rounds in the game good for OUT if IN still does not have a winning strategy for
the continuation of the game from that point. If a position is good, then whatever
IN picks next, there is some pick for OUT that would keep the position good.
(Otherwise, IN could make a pick i for which this is not so, and whatever pick
OUT then made, IN would have a strategy for the rest of the game, meaning that
IN in effect had a winning strategy already, namely, to pick this i and follow up

with the winning strategy associated with OUT’s next pick.) Therefore OUTcan
always make a pick that will keep the position good, so at no ﬁnite stage will IN
have won, meaning that IN will not win in the end, either. Always picking to
keep the position good is a winning strategy for OUT.
David Blackwell, in a modest but insightful communication of 1967, pointed
out how this theorem could be used to give a new game-theoretic proof of a
classical structural theorem, the Kuratowski reduction principle for coanalytic
sets. A ﬂurry of intense activity led a decade or so later to the beautiful picture in
Moschovakis (2009): PD implies not only all the regularity theorems but also all
the structural theorems that the classical descriptive set theorists of the 1920s
and 1930s were seeking but could not ﬁnd because they are not provable in ZFC.
Great interest consequently attaches to the question of how far one can go
beyond the Gale–Stewart theorem within ZFC, and what plausible additional
assumptions might take one all the way to PD.
There were partial results on low-level Borel sets by Morton Davis and
others, and then D. A. Martin proved the determinateness of analytic and
coanalytic sets assuming a measurable cardinal. He later proved in ZFC the
determinateness of all Borel sets. Martin (2020) is a recent recounting of both
results. Between Martin’s two landmarks, Friedman (1971) showed, on the one
hand, that analytic and coanalytic determinacy could not have been obtained in
ZFC alone, and that Borel determinacy would have to make use of essentially
the full strength of ZFC, and involve cardinals that, although not “large” by set
theorists’ standards, are much larger than any ordinarily encountered in main-
stream mathematics. Later Woodin, and deﬁnitively Martin and John Steel
(1989), showed that enough really large large cardinals – more speciﬁcally,
enough Woodin cardinals – give PD. Just as there are results about the ﬁnite
whose proofs take a detour through the inﬁnite (as discussed in §8.3), so also
there are results about the “lower inﬁnite, the realm of reals and sets of reals,
whose proofs depend on the “higher” inﬁnite, or realm of large cardinals.
Unfortunately, although large cardinals in this way have cleared up almost all
outstanding problems about special sets of reals, in contrast to their thus telling
us “everything” about descriptive set theory, they in themselves tell us almost
nothing about CH, disappointing the expectations of Gödel, for one. For if a
model M has in it an ordinal that appears to it to be a large cardinal, then it will
still appear to be so after forcing involving any partial order P that appears to the
model of smaller cardinality that that. And this includes the forcing “condi-
tions” that can turn CH off or on. This was shown by Levy, Solovay, and others –
it has to be proved anew for each type of large cardinal – in the early days of the
reception of Cohen’s work. Hence a continuing search on the part of set theorists

for other candidate new axioms to prove or disprove CH, with MM being one
example.
10.3 Large Cardinals and Inner Models
Scott (1961) discovered an important break in the series of stronger and
stronger large cardinal axioms. The weaker ones, such as the existence of
inaccessibles and the existence of weakly compacts, are compatible with
V ¼ L: if LC is either of these axioms, then Con ZFC þ LC
ð
Þ implies
Con ZFC þ LC þ V ¼ L
ð
Þ. Thus “inaccessibles and weakly compacts can
exist in L.” But Scott showed that measurables cannot. (The measurable
cardinal κ is present in L, since all ordinals are, but not its measure μ, so L
does not “know” κ is measurable.). But Kunen (1970) showed there exists an
L-like minimalistic model associated with ZFC þ MC, where MC is the
existence of measurable cardinals, which as he and subsequent workers
established, shares many of the properties of the original L, with CH being
true in it, in particular. This discovery launched the inner model program, to
ﬁnd L-like models for larger and larger cardinals, and analyze their ﬁne
structures. The program has since made considerable progress, the main
outstanding case being super-compacts. Woodin, pursuing this line of thought,
has been led to a vision of an “ultimate L” and an hypotheses that would
among other things accommodate all large cardinals (bar Reinhardt), and
imply c =א1.
Woodin’s current leaning in this direction contrasts with an earlier leaning in
the direction of a different hypothesis he called 
ð Þ or “star” on account of the
illumination it would cast on many problems, one of whose implications would
be c =א2. It is rather rare for any paper in set theory to appear in the Annals of
Mathematics, generally accounted the leading journal in the ﬁeld, but while the
present work was in preparation there appeared there a paper of David Asperó
and Ralf Schindler (2021) proving that a souped-up variant of MM implies 
ð Þ,
thus uniting two lines of work leading to the same conclusion about the value

11 Concluding Philosophical Remarks
The methodological problem faced by set theorists concerns what to do about
central set-theoretic questions such as CH whose status cannot be settled on the
basis of the axioms generally accepted by the mathematical community, those of

ZFC. Here optimists hold that additional axioms that settle such questions can
be, or perhaps already have been, found that can be justiﬁed in a way that is in
some sense objective, either intrinsically by claiming that they really were
implicit in our concept of set all along, or extrinsically in terms of the wealth
and plausibility and utility of their consequences. By contrast, pessimists
suspect we may have to acknowledge a bifurcation in the concept of set into a
pair of distinct concepts, one leading to c =א1, one leading to c =א2 (a view
sometimes compared to the Einsteinian bifurcation of the Newtonian notion of
mass into rest mass and inertial mass, which makes some statements about
“mass” true in one sense but false in another); or even worse, we may have to
abandon altogether any attempt to settle such questions as the status of CH or
SH, and so on, and embrace a “multiverse” of set-theoretic universes in different
ones of which different combinations of such hypotheses hold, tracing out their
interconnections (a view reminiscent of the speculations of those cosmologists
who believe in a “multiverse” of different physical universes in which physical
constants may have different values). There are also mathematicians unfriendly
to set theory who hold that ZFC is already more than is needed to accommodate
all really important core mathematics, and that speculations about abstruse set-
theoretic issues going beyond this basic core should not be encouraged.
The ontological problem raised by metaphysicians less interested in the
internal workings of a discipline like set theory than in its external relations,
so to speak, and especially in the relation of its objects to those of physical
science, is this: Are abstract entities – of which sets would be a prime example –
utlimately real, or merely useful ﬁctions? Metaphysical or ontological realists
opt for the former, and nominalists for the latter alternative. There are also
philosophers unfriendly to ontological metaphysics who question the intelligi-
bility of talk of “ultimate reality.”
Although authors of Elements are permitted, and even almost encouraged, to
be opinionated, I do not wish to take a stand on either question here. Obviously,
since I have undertaken to write the present work, I do not share the anti-set-
theoretic stance (while nonetheless ﬁnding great interest in questions about how
much set theory this or that kind of mathematics indispensably requires and how
much it can get by without), but I disclaim any qualiﬁcations to speak on
optimism versus pessimism. I am ﬁrmly antimetaphysical or anti-ontological
in outlook, but I have expressed my views on that issue as well as I can
elsewhere, and it is, in any case an issue that has more to do with mathematics
in general than set theory in particular, which is my present subject.
What I think it important to emphasize about the optimism versus pessimism
and the realism versus nominalism debates before closing here is simply their
distinctness. Philosophy is not like sciences where international bodies regulate

the use of terminology (the names of chemical compounds or of biological
species, for instance), and as a result one ﬁnds a philosophical label such as
“platonist” bandied about rather loosely, sometimes applied to set-theoretic
optimists, sometimes applied to metaphysical realists. This kind of sloppiness
can sow confusion, and so though warnings against conﬂating orthogonal issues
have repeatedly been urged by Maddy and others, one more repetition of such
cautions may be in order.
Let it be noted, therefore, ﬁrst, that even in connection with a body of
admitted pure ﬁction, say the canon of Sherlock Holmes stories of Conan
Doyle, when presented with two continuations, say pastiches by two different
subsequent writers, there are often objective (or anyhow, not wholly subjective)
reasons for thinking one rather than the other more in harmony with the spirit of
the original, and more worthy of being admitted as deuterocanonical rather than
dismissed as apocryphal. In the same way, one could hold that “ultimate L” is, in
some sense, objectively preferable to “Martin’s maximum,” or the reverse,
while remaining doubtful whether in the end set theory is more than a grand
mythology.
Let it be noted, also, second, that even in connection with physical objects
whose reality no sane person doubts, there can be many questions about them
that it is beyond our powers to answer. (A stock example is: What did Julius
Caesar have for his last meal before he was assassinated?) There may even be
deep reasons of physical principle (connected with the second law of thermo-
dynamics) why there must be many such unanswerable physical questions. In
the same way, one could be a ﬁrm believer in the absolute, fundamental,
noumenal reality of the objects of set theory, while holding that many of their
properties are entirely and forever beyond the range of human cognitive
faculties.
Set theory is a grand subject, whether or not its oldest and deepest questions
can ever be answered objectively, and whether it is in the end regarded as a
revelation of an ultimate reality or as a purely human construction.

Acknowledgments
This work was written after more than ﬁfty years of study, research, and
teaching in set theory, during which the author has accumulated debts of
gratitude to more individuals than can be mentioned. But I would especially
like to acknowledge the inﬂuence, on the one hand, during my years as
a graduate student at Berkeley in the early 1970s, of my teachers Ronald
Jensen, Ashok Maitra, Jack Silver, Robert Solovay, and Robert Vaught, and,
on the other hand, then and later, of my fellow students at the time, Penelope
Maddy, Douglas Miller, and Lee Stanley. I would also like to mention with
gratitude the small but engaged group of Princeton undergraduates who were
studying the subject with me as I worked on the manuscript of the present work
during the difﬁcult era of COVID-19: Yamaan Attwa, Felipe Doria, Zander Hill,
Jake Intrater, Tanvi Kishore, Noah Luch, Max Manicone, Sam Mathers, and
Elijah Shina. The work is dedicated to Ruby Eloise Burgess and Stella Rose
Burgess.
