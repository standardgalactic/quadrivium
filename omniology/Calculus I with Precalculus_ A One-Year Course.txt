Integrating Precalculus and Calculus I
As its title suggests, Calculus I with Precalculus: A One-Year Course, Third Edition,
is comprised of both precalculus topics and Calculus I topics. Rather than simply 
presenting all of the precalculus topics in the first half of the book, the 
precalculus topics are integrated throughout the text, according to function type—like,
algebraic functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and trigonometric and inverse
trigonometric functions. This function-driven approach—covering precalculus topics
before covering calculus topics—is repeated throughout the text, as illustrated below.
Additional precalculus topics are covered in Chapters P and 13. Chapter P offers a
review of basic algebra, which can be covered quickly or assigned as outside reading.
Chapter 13 can be covered at almost any point in the course.
Function-Driven Approach
Schools that offer a course combining precalculus and Calculus I have reported
several advantages to the function-driven approach over the traditional precalculus-
calculus sequence.
1. Students are motivated because they study calculus early in the semester as do their
peers in the regular calculus sequence. 
2. Students are asking calculus questions early in their study of precalculus.
3. Instructors have the opportunity to incorporate calculus examples and exercises
into the later chapters that cover additional topics in trigonometry and analytic
geometry, including parametric and polar equations.

A Word from the Authors
Full Preparation for Calculus II
With the integration of precalculus, Calculus I with Precalculus, Third Edition, is
intended for a slower-paced calculus course. This in turn makes the course more
manageable, especially for students who have already struggled through a calculus
course. Despite the slower pace, students will enter a Calculus II course as prepared
and on the same level as their peers.
Calculus courses have been evolving and changing since we first began teaching 
and writing calculus. With these changes, we have made every effort to continue to
provide instructors and students with quality textbooks and resources to accommodate
their instructional and educational needs. We are excited about the opportunity to offer
a textbook in a newly emerging market. We hope you enjoy this third edition of an
innovative text.
If you have any suggestions for improving the text, please feel free to write us.

We would like to thank the following people who have reviewed and provided

Tools to Build Mastery
NEW! Capstone exercises now appear in every
section. These exercises synthesize the main
concepts of each section and show students how the
topics relate. They are often multipart problems that
contain conceptual and noncomputational parts, and
can be used for classroom discussion or test prep. 
CAPSTONES
These writing exercises are questions designed to test
students’ understanding of basic concepts in each
section. The exercises encourage students to verbalize
and write answers, promoting technical communication
skills that will be invaluable in their future careers.
WRITING ABOUT CONCEPTS
The devil is in the details. Study Tips help point out some of the troublesome
common mistakes, indicate special cases that can cause confusion, or
expand on important concepts. These tips provide students with valuable
information, similar to what an instructor might comment on in class. 
STUDY TIPS
Throughout the text, examples are worked out step-by-step.
These worked examples demonstrate the procedures and
techniques for solving problems, and give students an
increased understanding of the concepts of calculus. Many
examples are presented in a side-by-side format to help
students see that a problem can be solved in more than one way.

WRITING ABOUT CONCEPTS
Because integration is 
usually more difficult than differentiation,
you should always check your answer to
an integration problem by differentiating.
For instance, in Example 3 you should
differentiate 
to verify
that you obtain the original integrand.

Practice makes perfect. Exercises are often the
first place students turn to in a textbook. The
authors have spent a great deal of time analyzing
and revising the exercises, and the result is a
comprehensive and robust set of exercises at the
end of every section. A variety of exercise types
and levels of difficulty are included to
accommodate students with all learning styles. 
In addition to the exercises in the book, 3,000
algorithmic exercises appear in the WebAssign®
course that accompanies Calculus.
EXERCISES
“When will I use this?” The authors attempt to answer this question
for students with carefully chosen applied exercises and examples.
Applications are pulled from diverse sources, such as current events,
world data, industry trends, and more, and relate to a wide range of
interests. Understanding where calculus is (or can be) used promotes
fuller understanding of the material.
APPLICATIONS
Review Exercises at the end of each chapter provide more
practice for students. These exercise sets provide a
comprehensive review of the chapter’s concepts and are 
an excellent way for students to prepare for an exam.
REVIEW EXERCISES
These sets of exercises at the end of each chapter test students’ abilities

Notes provide additional details about theorems,
definitions, and examples. They offer additional insight,
or important generalizations that students might not
immediately see. Like the
study tips, notes can be
invaluable to students.
NOTES
Theorems provide the
conceptual framework for
calculus. Theorems are
clearly stated and separated
from the rest of the text 
by boxes for quick visual
reference. Key proofs often
follow the theorem, and
other proofs are provided in
an in-text appendix.
THEOREMS
As with the theorems,
definitions are clearly
stated using precise,
formal wording and are

STUDY TIP
NOTE
There are two important points that should be made concerning the Trapezoidal Rule
(or the Midpoint Rule). First, the approximation tends to become more accurate as increases.
For instance, in Example 1, if 
the Trapezoidal Rule yields an approximation of 1.2189.
Second, although you could have used the Fundamental Theorem to evaluate the integral in
Example 1, this theorem cannot be used to evaluate an integral as simple as 
because 
has no elementary antiderivative. Yet, the Trapezoidal Rule can be applied
easily to estimate this integral.

Chapter Openers provide initial motivation for the upcoming
chapter material. Along with a map of the chapter objectives,
an important concept in the chapter is related to an application
of the topic in the real world. Students are encouraged to see 
the real-life relevance of calculus.
CHAPTER OPENERS
Explorations provide students with
unique challenges to study concepts
that have not yet been formally
covered. They allow students to learn
by discovery and introduce topics
related to ones they are presently studying. 
By exploring topics in this way, students are
encouraged to think outside the box.

HISTORICAL NOTES AND BIOGRAPHIES
Throughout the book, technology boxes give
students a glimpse of how technology may be used

Expanding the Experience of Calculus
THE SUM OF THE FIRST 100 INTEGERS
A teacher of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
asked him to add all the integers from 1 to
100. When Gauss returned with the correct
answer after only a few moments, the teacher
could only look at him in astounded silence.
This is what Gauss did:
This is generalized by Theorem 6.2, where

Most graphing utilities and computer algebra systems have built-in
programs that can be used to approximate the value of a definite integral. Try using
such a program to approximate the integral in Example 1. 
When you use such a program, you need to be aware of its limitations. Often,
you are given no indication of the degree of accuracy of the approximation. Other
times, you may be given an approximation that is completely wrong. For instance,
try using a built-in numerical integration program to evaluate

Integration
The area of a parabolic region can be approximated as the sum of the areas of rectangles. As you increase the number
of rectangles, the approximation tends to become more and more accurate. In Section 6.2, you will learn how the limit
process can be used to find areas of a wide variety of regions.

Equations and Solutions of Equations
An equation in is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. For example,
and 
are equations. To solve an equation in 
means to find all values of 
for which the
equation is true. Such values are solutions. For instance,
is a solution of the
equation
because 
is a true statement.
The solutions of an equation depend on the kinds of numbers being considered. For
instance, in the set of rational numbers,
has no solution because there is no
rational number whose square is 10. However, in the set of real numbers, the equation
has the two solutions 
and 
An equation that is true for every real number in the domain of the variable is
called an identity. The domain is the set of all real numbers for which the equation is
defined. For example,
Identity
is an identity because it is a true statement for any real value of 
The equation
Identity
where 
is an identity because it is true for any nonzero real value of 
An equation that is true for just some (or even none) of the real numbers in 
the domain of the variable is called a conditional equation. For example, the equation 
Conditional equation
is conditional because 
and 
are the only values in the domain that 
satisfy the equation. The equation 
is conditional because there are
no real values of for which the equation is true.

EGYPTIAN PAPYRUS (1650 B.C.)
This ancient Egyptian papyrus, discovered in
1858, contains one of the earliest examples
of mathematical writing in existence. The
papyrus itself dates back to around 1650 B.C,
but it is actually a copy of writings from two
centuries earlier. The algebraic equations on
the papyrus were written in words.
Diophantus, a Greek who lived around 
A.D. 250, is often called the Father of Algebra.
He was the first to use abbreviated word
forms in equations.

A common mistake that is made in solving an equation such as that in Example 10
is to divide each side of the equation by the variable factor 
This loses the solution
When solving an equation, be sure to write the equation in general form, then
factor the equation and set 
factor equal to zero. Don’t divide each side of an
equation by a variable factor in an attempt to simplify the equation.

Equations Involving Radicals
Operations such as squaring each side of an equation, raising each side of an equation
to a rational power, and multiplying each side of an equation by a variable quantity all
can introduce extraneous solutions. So, when you use any of these operations, checking
your solutions is crucial.

Prerequisites
NOTE
The essential operations in
Example 12 are isolating the radical and
squaring each side. In Example 13, this
is equivalent to isolating the factor with
the rational exponent and raising each
side to the reciprocal power.
When an equation 
contains two radicals, it may not be 
possible to isolate both. In such cases,
you may have to raise each side of the
equation to a power at two different
stages in the solution, as shown in
Example 12(b).

Equations with Absolute Values
To solve an equation involving an absolute value, remember that the expression inside
the absolute value signs can be positive or negative. This results in two separate 
equations, each of which must be solved. For instance, the equation
results in the two equations 
and 
which implies that the equation has two solutions:
and 
EXAMPLE 14 Solving an Equation Involving Absolute Value

Introduction
In a previous course, you learned to use the inequality symbols
and 
to 
compare two numbers and to denote subsets of real numbers. For instance, the simple
inequality
denotes all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 3.
Now, you will expand your work with inequalities to include more involved 
statements such as
and
As with an equation, you solve an inequality in the variable by finding all values of
for which the inequality is true. Such values are solutions and are said to satisfy the
inequality. The set of all real numbers that are solutions of an inequality is the solution
set of the inequality. For instance, the solution set of 
is all real numbers that are less than 3.
The set of all points on the real number line that represents the solution set is the
graph of the inequality. Graphs of many types of inequalities consist of intervals on
the real number line. Note that each type of interval can be classified as bounded or
unbounded. Bounded intervals are of the form 
and 
Unbounded intervals are of the form 
and

Properties of Inequalities
The procedures for solving linear inequalities in one variable are much like those for
solving linear equations. To isolate the variable, you can make use of the Properties
of Inequalities. These properties are similar to the properties of equality, but there are
two important exceptions. When each side of an inequality is multiplied or divided by
a negative number, the direction of the inequality symbol must be reversed. Here is an
example.
Original inequality
Multiply each side by 
and reverse inequality.
Simplify.
Notice that if the inequality was not reversed, you would obtain the false statement
Two inequalities that have the same solution set are equivalent. For instance, the
inequalities
and
are equivalent. To obtain the second inequality from the first, you can subtract 2 from
each side of the inequality. The following list describes the operations that can be used
to create equivalent inequalities.

TECHNOLOGY
When working with
absolute value inequalities, a “less than”
inequality can be solved as a double
inequality and the solution lies between
two numbers. A “greater than” inequality
must be solved in two parts and the 
solution set is disjoint.
STUDY TIP

Other Types of Inequalities
To solve a polynomial inequality, you can use the fact that a polynomial can change
signs only at its zeros (the -values that make the polynomial equal to zero). Between
two consecutive zeros, a polynomial must be entirely positive or entirely negative.
This means that when the real zeros of a polynomial are put in order, they divide the
real number line into intervals in which the polynomial has no sign changes. These
zeros are the key numbers of the inequality, and the resulting intervals are the test
intervals for the inequality.
EXAMPLE
6
Solving a Polynomial Inequality
Solve 
Solution
By factoring the polynomial as
you can see that the key numbers are 
and 
So, the polynomial’s test 
intervals are
and
Test intervals
In each test interval, choose a representative -value and evaluate the polynomial.
Positive
Negative
Positive
From this you can conclude that the inequality is satisfied for all -values in 
This implies that the solution of the inequality 
is the interval 
as shown in Figure P.8. Note that the original inequality contains a “less than”
symbol. This means that the solution set does not contain the endpoints of the test
interval 
Solution interval:
Figure P.8
■
As with linear inequalities, you can check the reasonableness of a solution by 
substituting -values into the original inequality. For instance, to check the solution
found in Example 6, try substituting several -values from the interval 
into the
inequality 
Regardless of which -values you choose, the inequality
should be satisfied.
In Example 6, the polynomial inequality was given in general form (with the 
polynomial on one side and zero on the other). Whenever this is not the case, you
should begin the solution process by writing the inequality in general form.

The concepts of key numbers and test intervals can be extended to rational
inequalities. To do this, use the fact that the value of a rational expression can change
sign only at its zeros (the -values for which its numerator is zero) and its undefined
values (the -values for which its denominator is zero). These two types of numbers
make up the key numbers of a rational inequality. When solving a rational inequality,
begin by writing the inequality in general form with the rational expression on the left
and zero on the right.

production exceed 100 billion?
166. Daily Sales
A doughnut shop sells a dozen doughnuts
for $4.50. Beyond the fixed costs (rent, utilities, and
insurance) of $220 per day, it costs $2.75 for enough
materials (flour, sugar, and so on) and labor to produce
a dozen doughnuts. The daily profit from doughnut
sales varies from $60 to $270. Between what levels (in
dozens) do the daily sales vary?
167. Height

P.3
Graphical Representation of Data
■Plot points in the Cartesian plane.
■Use the Distance Formula to find the distance between two points.
■Use the Midpoint Formula to find the midpoint of a line segment.
■Use a coordinate plane to model and solve real-life problems.
The Cartesian Plane
Just as you can represent real numbers by points on a real number line, you can 
represent ordered pairs of real numbers by points in a plane called the rectangular
coordinate system, or the Cartesian plane, named after the French mathematician
René Descartes (1596–1650).
The Cartesian plane is formed by using two real number lines intersecting at right
angles, as shown in Figure P.11. The horizontal real number line is usually called the 
axis, and the vertical real number line is usually called the 
axis. The point of 
intersection of these two axes is the origin, and the two axes divide the plane into four
parts called quadrants.
Figure P.12
The Cartesian Plane
Figure P.11
Each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair
of real numbers 
and 
called coordinates of the point. The 
coordinate represents the directed 
distance from the -axis to the point, and the 
coordinate represents the directed 
distance from the -axis to the point, as shown in Figure P.12.
EXAMPLE

Plotting Points in the Cartesian Plane
Plot the points 
and 
Solution
To plot the point 
imagine a vertical line through 
on the -axis
and a horizontal line through 2 on the -axis. The intersection of these two lines is the
point 
The other four points can be plotted in a similar way, as shown in
Figure P.13.

RENÉ DESCARTES (1596–1650)
The Cartesian coordinate plane named after
René Descartes was developed independently
by another French mathematician, Pierre
de Fermat. Fermat’s Introduction to Loci,
written about 1629, was clearer and more
systematic than Descartes’s La géométrié.
However, Fermat’s work was not published
during his lifetime. Consequently, Descartes
received the credit for the development of the
coordinate plane with the now familiar x- and
y-axes.

The beauty of a rectangular coordinate system is that it allows you to see
relationships between two variables. It would be difficult to overestimate the 
importance of Descartes’s introduction of coordinates in the plane. Today, his ideas
are in common use in virtually every scientific and business-related field.

Sketching a Scatter Plot
From 1994 through 2007, the numbers 
(in millions) of subscribers to a cellular
telecommunication service in the United States are shown in the table, where 
represents the year. Sketch a scatter plot of the data.
(Source: CTIA-The Wireless
Association)
Solution
To sketch a scatter plot of the data shown in the table, you simply repre-
sent each pair of values by an ordered pair 
and plot the resulting points, as
shown in Figure P.14. For instance, the first pair of values is represented by the
ordered pair 
Note that the break in the -axis indicates that the numbers
between 0 and 1994 have been omitted.
Figure P.14
■
In Example 2, you could have let 
represent the year 1994. In that case, the
horizontal axis would not have been broken, and the tick marks would have been
labeled 1 through 14 (instead of 1994 through 2007).

The Distance Formula
Recall from the Pythagorean Theorem that, for a right triangle with hypotenuse of
length and sides of lengths and 
you have
Pythagorean Theorem
as shown in Figure P.15. (The converse is also true. That is, if 
then the
triangle is a right triangle.)
Suppose you want to determine the distance 
between two points 
and
in the plane. With these two points, a right triangle can be formed, as shown
in Figure P.16. The length of the vertical side of the triangle is 
and the
length of the horizontal side is 
By the Pythagorean Theorem, you can write
This result is the Distance Formula.

The Midpoint Formula
To find the midpoint of the line segment that joins two points in a coordinate plane,
you can simply find the average values of the respective coordinates of the two 
endpoints using the Midpoint Formula.

Estimating Annual Revenue
Barnes & Noble had annual sales of approximately $5.1 billion in 2005, and 
$5.4 billion in 2007. Without knowing any additional information, what would you
estimate the 2006 sales to have been?
(Source: Barnes & Noble, Inc.)
Solution
One solution to the problem is to assume that sales followed a linear 
pattern. With this assumption, you can estimate the 2006 sales by finding the midpoint
of the line segment connecting the points 
and 
Midpoint Formula
Substitute for 
and 
Simplify.
So, you would estimate the 2006 sales to have been about $5.25 billion, as shown in

The Graph of an Equation
In Section P.3, you used a coordinate system to represent graphically the relationship
between two quantities. There, the graphical picture consisted of a collection of points
in a coordinate plane.
Frequently, a relationship between two quantities is expressed as an equation in
two variables. For instance,
is an equation in 
and 
An ordered pair
is a solution or solution point of an equation in and if the equation is true
when 
is substituted for and 
is substituted for 
For instance,
is a solution
of 
because 
is a true statement.
In this section you will review some basic procedures for sketching the graph of
an equation in two variables. The graph of an equation is the set of all points that are
solutions of the equation.

SKETCHING THE GRAPH OF AN EQUATION BY POINT PLOTTING
1. If possible, rewrite the equation so that one of the variables is isolated on
one side of the equation.
2. Make a table of values showing several solution points.
3. Plot these points on a rectangular coordinate system.
4. Connect the points with a smooth curve or line.

Because the equation is already solved for

that consists of several solution points of the equation. For instance, when

From the table, it follows that

are solution points of the equation. After plotting these points, you can see that they
appear to lie on a line, as shown in Figure P.25. The graph of the equation is the line
that passes through the six plotted points.

The point-plotting method demonstrated in Examples 2 and 3 is easy to use, but
it has some shortcomings. With too few solution points, you can misrepresent the
graph of an equation. For instance, if only the four points

in Figure P.26(a) were plotted, any one of the three graphs in Figure P.27 would be
reasonable.

NOTE
One of your goals in this
course is to learn to classify the basic
shape of a graph from its equation. For
instance, you will learn that the linear
equation in Example 2 has the form
and its graph is a line. Similarly, the
quadratic equation in Example 3 has 
the form
and its graph is a parabola.
y  ax2  bx  c
y  mx  b

Intercepts of a Graph
It is often easy to determine the solution points that have zero as either the -coordinate
or the -coordinate. These points are called intercepts because they are the points at
which the graph intersects or touches the - or -axis. It is possible for a graph to have
no intercepts, one intercept, or several intercepts, as shown in Figure P.28.
Note that an 
-intercept can be written as the ordered pair 
and a 
-intercept can be written as the ordered pair 
Some texts denote the -intercept
as the -coordinate of the point 
[and the y-intercept as the -coordinate of the
point 
] rather than the point itself. Unless it is necessary to make a distinction,
we will use the term intercept to mean either the point or the coordinate.

Symmetry
Graphs of equations can have symmetry with respect to one of the coordinate axes or
with respect to the origin. Symmetry with respect to the -axis means that if the
Cartesian plane were folded along the -axis, the portion of the graph above the -axis
would coincide with the portion below the -axis. Symmetry with respect to the -axis
or the origin can be described in a similar manner, as shown in Figure P.30.
axis symmetry

Origin symmetry

Knowing the symmetry of a graph before attempting to sketch it is helpful,
because then you need only half as many solution points to sketch the graph. There
are three basic types of symmetry, described as follows.
You can conclude that the graph of 
is symmetric with respect to the 
-axis because the point

Solution
Of the three tests for symmetry, the only one that is satisfied is the test for
-axis symmetry because 
is equivalent to 
. So, the graph is 
symmetric with respect to the -axis. Using symmetry, you only need to find the 
solution points above the -axis and then reflect them to obtain the graph, as shown in
Figure P.33.

Solution
This equation fails all three tests for symmetry and consequently its graph
is not symmetric with respect to either axis or to the origin. The absolute value sign
indicates that is always nonnegative. Create a table of values and plot the points, as
shown in Figure P.34. From the table, you can see that

Throughout this course, you will learn to recognize several types of graphs 
from their equations. For instance, you will learn to recognize that the graph of a 
second-degree equation of the form 
is a parabola (see Example 3). The graph of a circle is also easy to recognize.
Circles
Consider the circle shown in Figure P.35. A point 
is on the circle if and only if
its distance from the center 
is 
By the Distance Formula,
By squaring each side of this equation, you obtain the standard form of the equation
of a circle.
From this result, you can see that the standard form of the equation of a circle
with its center at the origin,
is simply
Circle with center at origin

Application
In this course, you will learn that there are many ways to approach a problem. Three
common approaches are illustrated in Example 9.
A Numerical Approach: Construct and use a table.
A Graphical Approach: Draw and use a graph.
An Algebraic Approach: Use the rules of algebra.
EXAMPLE
9
Recommended Weight
The median recommended weight 
(in pounds) for men of medium frame who are 
25 to 59 years old can be approximated by the mathematical model
where 
is the man’s height (in inches).
(Source: Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company)
a. Construct a table of values that shows the median recommended weights for men
with heights of 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, and 76 inches. Then use the table to 
estimate numerically the median recommended weight for a man whose height is
71 inches.
b. Use the table of values to sketch a graph of the model. Then use the graph to 
estimate graphically the median recommended weight for a man whose height is 
71 inches.
c. Use the model to confirm algebraically the estimates you found in parts (a) and (b).
Solution
a. You can use a calculator to complete the table, as shown below.
When 
you can estimate that 
pounds.
b. The table of values can be used to sketch the graph of the equation, as shown in
Figure P.37. From the graph, you can estimate that a height of 71 inches 
corresponds to a weight of about 161 pounds.
c. To confirm algebraically the estimate found in parts (a) and (b), you can substitute
71 for in the model.
Write original model.
Substitute 71 for 
Use a calculator.
So, the estimate of 161 pounds is fairly good.

Using Slope
The simplest mathematical model for relating two variables is the linear equation in
two variables
The equation is called linear because its graph is a line. 
(In mathematics, the term line means straight line.) By letting 
you obtain
Substitute 0 for 
So, the line crosses the -axis at

The slope of a nonvertical line is the number of units the line rises (or falls) vertically
for each unit of horizontal change from left to right, as shown in Figure P.38.

Once you have determined the slope and the -intercept of a line, it is a relatively

vertical. A vertical line has an equation of the form 
Vertical line
The equation of a vertical line cannot be written in the form 
because the
slope of a vertical line is undefined, as indicated in Figure P.39. Later in this section you
will see that the undefined slope of a vertical line derives algebraically from division by
zero.

Finding the Slope of a Line
Given an equation of a nonvertical line, you can find its slope by writing the equation
in slope-intercept form. If you are not given an equation, you can still find the slope
of a line. For instance, suppose you want to find the slope of the line passing through
the points 
and 
as shown in Figure P.41. As you move from left to right
along this line, a change of 
units in the vertical direction corresponds to a
change of 
units in the horizontal direction. 
and
The ratio of 
to 
represents the slope of the line that passes through
the points 
and 
When this formula is used for slope, the order of subtraction is important. Given
two points on a line, you are free to label either one of them as 
and the other 
as 
However, once you have done this, you must form the numerator and 
denominator using the same order of subtraction. 
Correct

For instance, the slope of the line passing through the points 
and 
can be 
calculated as

Writing Linear Equations in Two Variables

and 
is any other point on the
line, then
This equation, involving the variables and 
can be rewritten in the form 
which is the point-slope form of the equation of a line.
The point-slope form is most useful for finding the equation of a nonvertical line. 
You should remember this form.

Applications
In real-life problems, the slope of a line can be interpreted as either a ratio or a rate.
If the -axis and -axis have the same unit of measure, then the slope has no units and
is a ratio. If the -axis and -axis have different units of measure, then the slope is a
rate or rate of change.
EXAMPLE

Using Slope as a Ratio
The maximum recommended slope of a wheelchair ramp is 
A business is installing
a wheelchair ramp that rises 22 inches over a horizontal length of 24 feet. Is the ramp
steeper than recommended?
(Source: Americans with Disabilities Act Handbook)
Solution
The horizontal length of the ramp is 24 feet or 
288 inches, as
shown in Figure P.45. So, the slope of the ramp is
Because 
the slope of the ramp is not steeper than recommended.

Using Slope as a Rate of Change
The population of Kentucky was 3,961,000 in 1999 and 4,314,000 in 2009. Over this
10-year period, the average rate of change of the population was
If Kentucky’s population continues to increase at this same rate for the next 10 years,
it will have a 2019 population of 4,667,000 (see Figure P.46).

Most business expenses can be deducted in the same year they occur. One
exception is the cost of property that has a useful life of more than 1 year. Such costs
must be depreciated (decreased in value) over the useful life of the property. If the 
same amount is depreciated each year, the procedure is called linear or straight-line
depreciation. The book value is the difference between the original value and the total
amount of depreciation accumulated to date.
EXAMPLE

Straight-Line Depreciation
A college purchased exercise equipment worth $12,000 for the new campus 
fitness center. The equipment has a useful life of 8 years. The salvage value at the end
of 8 years is $2000. Write a linear equation that describes the book value of the 
equipment each year.
Solution
Let represent the value of the equipment at the end of year You can rep-
resent the initial value of the equipment by the data point 
and the salvage
value of the equipment by the data point 
The slope of the line is

The prediction method illustrated in Example 8 is called linear extrapolation.

When the estimated point lies between two given points, as shown in Figure P.49(b),
the procedure is called linear interpolation.

Introduction to Functions
Many everyday phenomena involve two quantities that are related to each 
other by some rule of correspondence. The mathematical term for such a rule of 
correspondence is a relation. In mathematics, relations are often represented by 
mathematical equations and formulas. For instance, the simple interest 
earned on
$1000 for 1 year is related to the annual interest rate by the formula 
The formula 
represents a special kind of relation that matches each
item from one set with exactly one item from a different set. Such a relation is called
a function.
To help understand this definition, look at the function that relates the time of day
to the temperature in Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.1
This function can be represented by the following set of ordered pairs, in which 
the first coordinate ( -value) is the input and the second coordinate ( -value) is the
output.

DEFINITION OF FUNCTION
A function
from a set 
to a set 
is a relation that assigns to each element 
in the set 
exactly one element in the set 
The set 
is the domain (or set
of inputs) of the function 
and the set 
contains the range (or set of outputs).

Functions are commonly represented in four ways.
To determine whether or not a relation is a function, you must decide whether
each input value is matched with exactly one output value. When any input value is
matched with two or more output values, the relation is not a function.
EXAMPLE
1
Testing for Functions
Determine whether the relation represents as a function of 
a. The input value is the number of representatives from a state, and the output value
is the number of senators.

b. This table does not describe as a function of 
The input value 2 is matched with
two different -values.
c. The graph in Figure 1.2 does describe

Each input value is
matched with exactly one output value.

Representing functions by sets of ordered pairs is common in discrete
mathematics. In algebra and calculus, however, it is more common to represent 
functions by equations or formulas involving two variables. For instance, the equation
is a function of 
represents the variable 
as a function of the variable 
In this equation,
is the
independent variable and is the dependent variable. The domain of the function
is the set of all values taken on by the independent variable 
and the range of the
function is the set of all values taken on by the dependent variable y.

FOUR WAYS TO REPRESENT A FUNCTION
1. Verbally by a sentence that describes how the input variable is related to
the output variable
2. Numerically by a table or a list of ordered pairs that matches input values
with output values
3. Graphically by points on a graph in a coordinate plane in which the input
values are represented by the horizontal axis and the output values are
represented by the vertical axis
4. Analytically by an equation in two variables

Function Notation
When an equation is used to represent a function, it is convenient to name the 
function so that it can be referenced easily. For example, you know that the equation
describes 
as a function of 
Suppose you give this function the name 
“ ” Then you can use the following function notation.
The symbol 
is read as the value of 
at 
or simply 
of 
The symbol 
corresponds to the -value for a given 
So, you can write 
Keep in mind that
is the name of the function, whereas 
is the value of the function at 
For
instance, the function given by
has function values denoted by 
and so on. To find these values,
substitute the specified input values into the given equation.

Chapter 1
Functions and Their Graphs

The Domain of a Function
The domain of a function can be described explicitly or it can be implied by the 
expression used to define the function. The implied domain is the set of all real 
numbers for which the expression is defined. For instance, the function given by
has an implied domain that consists of all real other than 
These two values
are excluded from the domain because division by zero is undefined. Another 
common type of implied domain is that used to avoid even roots of negative numbers.
For example, the function given by
is defined only for 
So, its implied domain is the interval 
In general, the
domain of a function excludes values that would cause division by zero or that would
result in the even root of a negative number.
EXAMPLE

Finding the Domain of a Function
Find the domain of each function.
a.
b.
c. Volume of a sphere:
d.
e.
Solution
a. The domain of consists of all first coordinates in the set of ordered pairs.
b. Excluding -values that yield zero in the denominator, the domain of is the set of
all real numbers except 
c. Because this function represents the volume of a sphere, the values of the radius 
must be positive. So, the domain is the set of all real numbers such that 
d. This function is defined only for -values for which
Using the methods described in Section P.2, you can conclude that 
So, the domain is the interval 
e. This function is defined for all values of 
So, the domain is the set of all real 
numbers.
■
In Example 7(c), note that the domain of a function may be implied by the 
physical context. For instance, from the equation 
you would have no reason to restrict 
to positive values, but the physical context
implies that a sphere cannot have a negative or zero radius.

The cost per unit in the production of
an MP3 player is $60. The manufacturer charges $90 per
unit for orders of 100 or less. To encourage large orders,
the manufacturer reduces the charge by $0.15 per MP3
player for each unit ordered in excess of 100 (for example,
there would be a charge of $87 per MP3 player for an
order size of 120).

such that is

NOTE
In Example 1, the use of dots (open or closed) at the extreme left and right points of
a graph indicates that the graph does not extend beyond these points. If no such dots are shown,
assume that the graph extends beyond these points.
■

By the definition of a function, at most one -value corresponds to a given 
-value. This means that the graph of a function cannot have two or more different
points with the same 
coordinate, and no two points on the graph of a function can
be vertically above or below each other. It follows, then, that a vertical line can 
intersect the graph of a function at most once. This observation provides a convenient
visual test called the Vertical Line Test for functions.

Increasing and Decreasing Functions
The more you know about the graph of a function, the more you know about the 
function itself. Consider the graph shown in Figure 1.9. As you move from left to
right, this graph falls from 
to 
is constant from 
to 
and
rises from 
to 
EXAMPLE

Increasing and Decreasing Functions
Use the graphs in Figure 1.10 to describe the increasing or decreasing behavior of
each function.
Solution
a. This function is increasing over the entire real line.
b. This function is increasing on the interval 
decreasing on the interval
and increasing on the interval 
c. This function is increasing on the interval 
constant on the interval 
and decreasing on the interval 
■
To help you decide whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant on
an interval, you can evaluate the function for several values of 
However, calculus is
needed to determine, for certain, all intervals on which a function is increasing,
decreasing, or constant.

Figure 1.9

The points at which a function changes its increasing, decreasing, or constant 
behavior are helpful in determining the relative minimum or relative maximum 
values of the function.
Figure 1.11 shows several different examples of relative minima and relative 
maxima. In Section 2.1, you will study a technique for finding the exact point at which
a second-degree polynomial function has a relative minimum or relative maximum. 
For the time being, however, you can use a graphing utility to find reasonable 
approximations of these points.
EXAMPLE
5
Approximating a Relative Minimum
Use a graphing utility to approximate the relative minimum of the function given by
Solution
The graph of 
is shown in Figure 1.12. By using the zoom and trace
features or the minimum feature of a graphing utility, you can estimate that the 
function has a relative minimum at the point
Relative minimum
Later, in Section 2.1, you will be able to determine that the exact point at which the
relative minimum occurs is 
■
You can also use the table feature of a graphing utility to approximate numerically
the relative minimum of the function in Example 5. Using a table that begins at 0.6 and
increments the value of 
by 0.01, you can approximate the relative minimum of
to be

When you use a graphing utility to estimate the - and -values
of a relative minimum or relative maximum, the zoom feature will often produce
graphs that are nearly flat. To overcome this problem, you can manually change the
vertical setting of the viewing window. The graph will stretch vertically if the 
values of Ymin and Ymax are closer together.

Step and Piecewise-Defined Functions
Functions whose graphs resemble sets of stairsteps are known as step functions. The
most famous of the step functions is the greatest integer function, which is denoted
by 
and defined as
the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
Some values of the greatest integer function are as follows.
The graph of the greatest integer function
has the following characteristics, as shown in Figure 1.15.
• The domain of the function is the set of all real numbers.
• The range of the function is the set of all integers.
• The graph has a -intercept at 
and -intercepts in the interval 
• The graph is constant between each pair of consecutive integers.
• The graph jumps vertically one unit at each integer value.
Recall from Section 1.1 that a piecewise-defined function is defined by two or
more equations over a specified domain. To graph a piecewise-defined function, graph
each equation separately over the specified domain, as shown in Example 8.
EXAMPLE

Graphing a Piecewise-Defined Function
Sketch the graph of 
Solution
This piecewise-defined function is composed of two linear functions. At
and to the left of 
the graph is the line 
and to the right of
the graph is the line 
as shown in Figure 1.16. Notice that the point
is a solid dot and the point 
is an open dot. This is because

Even and Odd Functions
In Section P.4, you studied different types of symmetry of a graph. In the terminology
of functions, a function is said to be even if its graph is symmetric with respect to the 
-axis and to be odd if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. The symmetry
tests in Section P.4 yield the following tests for even and odd functions.

Summary of Graphs of Common Functions
One of the goals of this text is to enable you to recognize the basic shapes of 
the graphs of different types of functions. For instance, from your study of lines in
Section P.5, you can determine the basic shape of the graph of the linear function
Specifically, you know that the graph of this function is a line whose
slope is 
and whose 
intercept is 
The six graphs shown in Figure 1.18 represent the most commonly used functions
in algebra and calculus. Familiarity with the basic characteristics of these simple
graphs will help you analyze the shapes of more complicated graphs.
(a) Constant function
(b) Identity function
(c) Absolute value function
(d) Square root function
(e) Squaring function
(f) Cubing function

Transformations of Functions

Shifting Graphs
Many functions have graphs that are simple transformations of the common graphs 
summarized on page 98. For example, you can obtain the graph of 
by shifting the graph of 
upward two units, as shown in Figure 1.19. In
function notation,
and are related as follows.
Upward shift of two units
Similarly, you can obtain the graph of
by shifting the graph of 
to the right two units, as shown in Figure 1.20. In
this case, the functions and have the following relationship.
Right shift of two units

Some graphs can be obtained from combinations of vertical and horizontal shifts,
as demonstrated in Example 1(b). Vertical and horizontal shifts generate a family of
graphs, each with the same shape but at different locations in the plane.

Nonrigid Transformations
Horizontal shifts, vertical shifts, and reflections are rigid transformations 
because the basic shape of the graph is unchanged. These transformations change only
the position of the graph in the coordinate plane. Nonrigid transformations are those
that cause a distortion—a change in the shape of the original graph. For instance, a 
nonrigid transformation of the graph of 
is represented by 
where
the transformation is a vertical stretch if 
and a vertical shrink if 
Another nonrigid transformation of the graph of 
is represented by 
where the transformation is a horizontal shrink if 
and a horizontal stretch if

In Examples 5 and 6, you formed the composition of two given functions. In 
calculus, it is also important to be able to identify two functions that make up a given
composite function. For instance, the function 
given by 
is the 
composition of with 
where 
and 
That is,
Basically, to “decompose” a composite function, look for an “inner” function and an
“outer” function. In the function 
above,
is the inner function and
is the outer function.
EXAMPLE

Decomposing a Composite Function
Write the function given by 
as a composition of two functions.
Solution
One way to write 
as a composition of two functions is to take the inner
function to be 
and the outer function to be
Then you can write

Algebraic Solution
The composition of the functions is as follows.
From this, it might appear that the domain of the composition
is the set of all real numbers. This, however, is not true.
Because the domain of is the set of all real numbers and the

Bacteria Count
The number 
of bacteria in a refrigerated food is given by
where 
is the temperature of the food in degrees Celsius. When the food is removed
from refrigeration, the temperature of the food is given by
where is the time in hours. 
a. Find the composition 
and interpret its meaning in context. 
b. Find the time when the bacteria count reaches 2000.
Solution
a.
The composite function 
represents the number of bacteria in the food as a
function of the amount of time the food has been out of refrigeration.
b. The bacteria count will reach 2000 when 
Solve this 
equation for as shown.
So, the count will reach 2000 when

When you solve this equation, note that the negative value is rejected because it is
not in the domain of the composite function.

Inverse Functions
■Find inverse functions informally and verify that two functions are inverse 
functions of each other.
■Use graphs of functions to determine whether functions have inverse functions.
■Use the Horizontal Line Test to determine if functions are one-to-one.
■Find inverse functions analytically.
Inverse Functions
Recall from Section 1.1 that a function can be represented by a set of ordered pairs.
For instance, the function 
from the set 
to the set
can be written as follows.
In this case, by interchanging the first and second coordinates of each of these ordered
pairs, you can form the inverse function of which is denoted by 
It is a function
from the set 
to the set 
and can be written as follows.
Note that the domain of 
is equal to the range of 
and vice versa, as shown 
in Figure 1.29. Also note that the functions and 
have the effect of “undoing”
each other. In other words, when you form the composition of with 
or the 
composition of
with
you obtain the identity function.

The Graph of an Inverse Function
The graphs of a function and its inverse function
are related to each other in the
following way. If the point 
lies on the graph of 
then the point 
must lie
on the graph of
and vice versa. This means that the graph of
is a reflection of
the graph of in the line 
as shown in Figure 1.30.

One-to-One Functions
The reflective property of the graphs of inverse functions gives you a nice geometric
test for determining whether a function has an inverse function. This test is called the
Horizontal Line Test for inverse functions.
If no horizontal line intersects the graph of 
at more than one point, then no
-value is matched with more than one -value. This is the essential characteristic of
what are called one-to-one functions.
Consider the function given by 
The first table is a table of values for
The second table of values is made up by interchanging the rows of the first
table. The second table does not represent a function because the input 
is
matched with two different outputs:
and 
So,

one and does not have an inverse function.

b. The graph of the function given by 
is shown in Figure 1.33(b).
Because it is possible to find a horizontal line that intersects the graph of at more

Finding Inverse Functions Analytically
For simple functions (such as the one in Example 1), you can find inverse functions by
inspection. For more complicated functions, however, it is best to use the following
guidelines. The key step in these guidelines is Step 3—interchanging the roles of and
This step corresponds to the fact that inverse functions have ordered pairs with the
coordinates reversed.

Introduction
You have already studied some techniques for fitting models to data. For instance, in
Section P.5, you learned how to find the equation of a line that passes through two
points. In this section, you will study other techniques for fitting models to data: least
squares regression and direct and inverse variation. The resulting models are either
polynomial functions or rational functions. (Rational functions will be studied in
Chapter 2.) 
EXAMPLE

A linear model that approximates the data is 
where is the year, with 
corresponding to 2000. Plot the actual data and the
model on the same graph. How closely does the model represent the data?
Solution
The actual data are plotted in Figure 1.36, along with the graph of the 
linear model. From the graph, it appears that the model is a “good fit” for the actual
data. You can see how well the model fits by comparing the actual values of with the
values of 
given by the model. The values given by the model are labeled 
in the

Least Squares Regression
So far in this text, you have worked with many different types of mathematical models
that approximate real-life data. In some instances the model was given (as in Example
1), whereas in other instances you were asked to find the model using 
simple algebraic techniques or a graphing utility.
To find a model that approximates the data most accurately, statisticians use a
measure called the sum of square differences, which is the sum of the squares of the
differences between actual data values and model values. The “best-fitting” linear
model, called the least squares regression line, is the one with the least sum of square
differences. Recall that you can approximate this line visually by plotting the data
points and drawing the line that appears to fit best—or you can enter the data points
into a calculator or computer and use the linear regression feature of the calculator or
computer.
EXAMPLE
2
Fitting a Linear Model to Data
A class of 28 people collected the following data, which represents their heights and
arm spans (rounded to the nearest inch).
Find a linear model to represent these data.
Solution
There are different ways to model these data with an equation. The
simplest would be to observe from a table of values that 
and 
are about the same
and list the model as simply 
A more careful analysis would be to use a
procedure from statistics called linear regression. The least squares regression line for
these data is
Least squares regression line
The graph of the model and the data are shown in Figure 1.37. From this model, you
can see that a person’s arm span tends to be about the same as his or her height.

Many scientific and graphing calculators have built-in least squares
regression programs. Typically, you enter the data into the calculator and then run the
linear regression program. The program usually displays the slope and -intercept of
the best-fitting line and the 
The correlation coefficient gives
a measure of how well the model fits the data. The closer 
is to 1, the better the
model fits the data. For instance, the correlation coefficient for the model in Example
2 is 
which indicates that the model is a good fit for the data. If the -value
is positive, the variables have a positive correlation, as in Example 2. If the -value is
negative, the variables have a negative correlation.

equal.

Direct Variation
There are two basic types of linear models. The more general model has a 
-intercept that is nonzero.
The simpler model
has a -intercept that is zero. In the simpler model,
is said to vary directly as 
or
to be directly proportional to

Direct Variation
In Pennsylvania, the state income tax is directly proportional to gross income. You are
working in Pennsylvania and your state income tax deduction is $46.05 for a gross
monthly income of $1500. Find a mathematical model that gives the Pennsylvania
state income tax in terms of gross income.

Direct Variation as an nth Power
Another type of direct variation relates one variable to a power of another variable.
For example, in the formula for the area of a circle
the area 
is directly proportional to the square of the radius 
In this formula,
is
the constant of proportionality.
Note that the direct variation model 
is a special case of

EXAMPLE

Direct Variation as an nth Power
The distance a ball rolls down an inclined plane is directly proportional to the square
of the time it rolls. During the first second, the ball rolls 8 feet. (See Figure 1.39.)
a. Find a mathematical model that relates the distance traveled to the time.
b. How far will the ball roll during the first 3 seconds?
Solution
a. Letting 
be the distance (in feet) the ball rolls and letting 
be the time (in
seconds), you have
Now, because 
when 
you can see that 
as follows.
So, the equation relating distance to time is
b. When 
the distance traveled is 
feet.
■
In Examples 3 and 4, the direct variations are such that an increase in one 
variable corresponds to an increase in the other variable. This is also true in the model
where an increase in 
results in an increase in 
You should not,
however, assume that this always occurs with direct variation. For example, in the

Some applications of variation involve problems with both direct and inverse
variation in the same model. These types of models are said to have combined 
variation.

Direct and Inverse Variation
A gas law states that the volume of an enclosed gas varies directly as the temperature
inversely as the pressure, as shown in Figure 1.40. The pressure of a gas is 
0.75 kilogram per square centimeter when the temperature is 
K and the volume is
8000 cubic centimeters.

Ecology
In Exercises 77 and 78, use the fact that the
diameter of the largest particle that can be moved by a
stream varies approximately directly as the square of the
velocity of the stream. 
77. A stream with a velocity of 
mile per hour can move
coarse sand particles about 0.02 inch in diameter.
Approximate the velocity required to carry particles 
0.12 inch in diameter.
78. A stream of velocity 
can move particles of diameter 
or less. By what factor does increase when the velocity
is doubled?
Resistance
In Exercises 79 and 80, use the fact that the
resistance of a wire carrying an electrical current is
directly proportional to its length and inversely
proportional to its cross-sectional area.
79. If #28 copper wire (which has a diameter of 0.0126 inch)
has a resistance of 66.17 ohms per thousand feet, what
length of #28 copper wire will produce a resistance of
33.5 ohms?
80. A 14-foot piece of copper wire produces a resistance of
0.05 ohm. Use the constant of proportionality from
Exercise 79 to find the diameter of the wire. 
81. Work
The work 
(in joules) done when lifting 
an object varies jointly with the mass 
(in kilograms) 
of the object and the height 
(in meters) that the object
is lifted. The work done when a 120-kilogram object 
is lifted 1.8 meters is 2116.8 joules. How much work is
done when lifting a 100-kilogram object 1.5 meters?
82. Music
The frequency of vibrations of a piano string
varies directly as the square root of the tension on the
string and inversely as the length of the string. The 
middle A string has a frequency of 440 vibrations per 
second. Find the frequency of a string that has 1.25 times
as much tension and is 1.2 times as long.
83. Fluid Flow
The velocity 
of a fluid flowing in a
conduit is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional
area of the conduit. (Assume that the volume of the flow
per unit of time is held constant.) 
(a) Determine the change in the velocity of water flowing
from a hose when a person places a finger over the
end of the hose to decrease its cross-sectional area 
by 25%.
(b) Use the fluid velocity model in part (a) to determine
the effect on the velocity of a stream when it is
dredged to increase its cross-sectional area by
one-third.
84. Beam Load
The maximum load that can be safely
supported by a horizontal beam varies jointly as the
width of the beam and the square of its depth, and
inversely as the length of the beam. Determine the
changes in the maximum safe load under the following
conditions.
(a) The width and length of the beam are doubled.
(b) The width and depth of the beam are doubled.
(c) All three of the dimensions are doubled.
(d) The depth of the beam is halved.

96. The prices of three sizes of pizza at a pizza shop are
as follows.
9-inch: $8.78, 12-inch: $11.78, 15-inch: $14.18
You would expect that the price of a certain size of
pizza would be directly proportional to its surface
area. Is that the case for this pizza shop? If not, which
size of pizza is the best buy?
CAPSTONE
In physics, Hooke’s Law for springs states that the distance a
spring is stretched or compressed from its natural or equilibrium
length varies directly as the force on the spring. Distance is
measured in inches (or meters) and force is measured in pounds
(or newtons). One newton is approximately equivalent to 
0.225 pound.
(a) Use direct variation to find an equation relating the
distance stretched (or compressed) to the force applied.
(b) If a force of 100 newtons stretches a spring 0.75 meter,
how far will a force of 80 newtons stretch the spring?
(c) Conduct your own experiment, and record your results.
(d) Write a brief summary comparing the theoretical result
with your experimental results.

Functions and Their Graphs

75. Compact Discs
The values 
(in billions of 
dollars) of shipments of compact discs in the United
States from 2000 through 2007 are shown in the table. A
linear model that approximates these data is
where represents the year, with 
corresponding to
2000.
(Source: Recording Industry Association of
America)
(a) Plot the actual data and the model on the same set of
coordinate axes.
(b) How closely does the model represent the data?
76. Data Analysis: TV Usage
The table shows the 
projected numbers of hours 
of television usage in the
United States from 2003 through 2011.
(Source:
Communications Industry Forecast and Report)
(a) Use a graphing utility to create a scatter plot of 
the data. Let 
represent the year, with 
corresponding to 2003.
(b) Use the regression feature of the graphing utility to
find the equation of the least squares regression line
that fits the data. Then graph the model and the
scatter plot you found in part (a) in the same view-
ing window. How closely does the model 
represent the data?
(c) Use the model to estimate the projected number of
hours of television usage in 2020.
(d) Interpret the meaning of the slope of the linear
model in the context of the problem.
77. Measurement
You notice a billboard indicating that it
is 2.5 miles or 4 kilometers to the next restaurant of 
a national fast-food chain. Use this information to find a
mathematical model that relates miles to kilometers.
Then use the model to find the numbers of kilometers in
2 miles and 10 miles.
78. Energy
The power 
produced by a wind turbine is
proportional to the cube of the wind speed 
A wind
speed of 27 miles per hour produces a power output 
of 750 kilowatts. Find the output for a wind speed of 
40 miles per hour.
79. Frictional Force
The frictional force 
between the
tires and the road required to keep a car on a curved
section of a highway is directly proportional to the
square of the speed of the car. If the speed of the car is
doubled, the force will change by what factor?
80. Demand
A company has found that the daily demand
for its boxes of chocolates is inversely proportional to
the price 
When the price is $5, the demand is 800
boxes. Approximate the demand when the price is
increased to $6.
81. Travel Time
The travel time between two cities is
inversely proportional to the average speed. A train travels
between the cities in 3 hours at an average 
speed of 65 miles per hour. How long would it take to 
travel between the cities at an average speed of 
80 miles per hour?
82. Cost
The cost of constructing a wooden box with a
square base varies jointly as the height of the box and the
square of the width of the box. A box of height 
16 inches and width 6 inches costs $28.80. How much
would a box of height 14 inches and width 8 inches cost?
In Exercises 83 and 84, find a mathematical model
representing the statement. (In each case, determine the
constant of proportionality.)

If you move far enough along a curve of the graph of a rational function, there is a straight line that you will
increasingly approach but never cross or touch. This line is called an asymptote. (See Section 2.6.)

In this chapter, you will continue to study
concepts that will help you prepare for
your study of calculus. These concepts
include analyzing and sketching graphs 
of polynomial and rational functions. 
It is important to know these concepts
before moving on to calculus.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How to analyze and sketch graphs of
quadratic functions. (2.1)
■How to analyze and sketch graphs of
polynomial functions of higher degree.
(2.2)
■How to divide polynomials. (2.3)
■How to perform operations with 
complex numbers and find complex
solutions of quadratic equations. 
(2.4)
■How to find zeros of polynomial 
functions. (2.5)
■How to analyze and sketch graphs 
of rational functions. (2.6)
Given a polynomial function that models the per capita cigarette consumption in the
United States, how can you determine whether the addition of cigarette warnings
affected consumption? (See Section 2.1, Exercise 91.)

■Analyze graphs of quadratic functions.
■Write quadratic functions in standard form and use the results 
to sketch graphs of quadratic functions.
■Find minimum and maximum values of quadratic functions in 
real-life applications.
The Graph of a Quadratic Function
In this and the next section, you will study the graphs of polynomial functions. In
Chapter 1, you were introduced to the following basic functions.
Linear function
Constant function
Squaring function
These functions are examples of polynomial functions.
Polynomial functions are classified by degree. For instance, a constant function
with 
has degree 0, and a linear function 
with 
has degree 1. In this section, you will study second-degree polynomial functions,
which are called quadratic functions.
For instance, each of the following functions is a quadratic function.
Note that the squaring function is a simple quadratic function that has degree 2.
The graph of a quadratic function is a special type of “U”-shaped curve called a
parabola. Parabolas occur in many real-life applications—especially those involving
reflective properties of satellite dishes and flashlight reflectors. You will study these
properties in Section 12.1.

The Standard Form of a Quadratic Function
The standard form of a quadratic function is 
This form is 
especially convenient because it identifies the vertex of the parabola as 
To graph a parabola, it is helpful to begin by writing the quadratic function in 
standard form using the process of completing the square, as illustrated in Example 2.
In this example, notice that to complete the square, you add and subtract the square
of half the coefficient of within the parentheses instead of adding the value to each
side of the equation as is done in Section P.1.
EXAMPLE
2
Using Standard Form to Graph a Parabola
Sketch the graph of 
and identify the vertex and the axis of the parabola.
Solution
Begin by writing the quadratic function in standard form. Notice that the
first step in completing the square is to factor out any coefficient of 
that is not 1.
Write original function.
Factor 2 out of -terms.
Add and subtract 4 within parentheses.
After adding and subtracting 4 within the parentheses, you must now regroup the
terms to form a perfect square trinomial. The 
can be removed from inside the
parentheses; however, because of the 2 outside of the parentheses, you must multiply
by 2, as shown below.
Regroup terms.
Simplify.
Write in standard form.
From this form, you can see that the graph of 
is a parabola that opens
upward and has its vertex at 
This corresponds to a left shift of two units and a downward shift of one unit relative
to the graph of 
as shown in Figure 2.4. In the figure, you can see that the axis
of the parabola is the vertical line through the vertex,

■Find and use zeros of polynomial functions as sketching aids.
Graphs of Polynomial Functions
In this section, you will study basic features of the graphs of polynomial functions.
The first feature is that the graph of a polynomial function is continuous. Essentially,
this means that the graph of a polynomial function has no breaks, holes, or gaps,
as shown in Figure 2.9(a). The graph shown in Figure 2.9(b) is an example of a 
piecewise-defined function that is not continuous.
(a) Polynomial functions have
(b) Functions with graphs that
continuous graphs.
are not continuous are not
polynomial functions.
Figure 2.9
The second feature is that the graph of a polynomial function has only smooth,
rounded turns, as shown in Figure 2.10(a). A polynomial function cannot have a sharp
turn. For instance, the function given by 
which has a sharp turn at the point
as shown in Figure 2.10(b), is not a polynomial function.
(a) Polynomial functions have graphs
(b) Graphs of polynomial functions
with smooth, rounded turns.
cannot have sharp turns.
Figure 2.10
The graphs of polynomial functions of degree greater than 2 are more difficult to
analyze than the graphs of polynomials of degree 0, 1, or 2. However, using the features
presented in this section, coupled with your knowledge of point plotting, intercepts, and
symmetry, you should be able to make reasonably accurate sketches by hand. 
In Chapter 5, you will learn more techniques for analyzing the graphs of polynomial
functions.

The polynomial functions that have the simplest graphs are monomials of the form
where is an integer greater than zero. From Figure 2.11, you can see that when is
even, the graph is similar to the graph of 
and when 
is odd, the graph is
similar to the graph of 
Moreover, the greater the value of 
the flatter the
graph near the origin. Polynomial functions of the form 
are often referred
to as power functions.

STUDY TIP

The Leading Coefficient Test
In Example 1, note that both graphs eventually rise or fall without bound as moves
to the right. Whether the graph of a polynomial function eventually rises or falls can 
be determined by the function’s degree (even or odd) and by its leading coefficient, as
indicated in the Leading Coefficient Test.
The notation “

a. Because the degree is odd and the leading coefficient is negative, the graph rises to
the left and falls to the right, as shown in Figure 2.13(a).

to the left and right, as shown in Figure 2.13(b).

In Example 2, note that the Leading Coefficient Test tells you only whether the
graph eventually rises or falls to the right or left. Other characteristics of the graph,
such as intercepts and minimum and maximum points, must be determined by using
other tests.
Real Zeros of Polynomial Functions
It can be shown that for a polynomial function of degree 
the following statements
are true. (Remember that the zeros of a function of 
are the 
values for which the
function is zero.)
1. The function has, at most,
real zeros. (You will study this result in detail in the
discussion of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra in Section 2.5.)
2. The graph of 
has, at most,
turning points. (Turning points, also called 
relative minima or relative maxima, are points at which the graph changes from
increasing to decreasing or vice versa.)
Finding the zeros of polynomial functions is one of the most important problems
in algebra. There is a strong interplay between graphical and analytic approaches to
this problem. Sometimes you can use information about the graph of a function to
help find its zeros, and in other cases you can use information about the zeros of a
function to help sketch its graph.

Polynomial Functions of Higher Degree

A polynomial function 
is written in standard form when its
terms are written in descending order 
of exponents from left to right. Before
applying the Leading Coefficient Test 
to a polynomial function, it is a good
idea to make sure that the polynomial
function is written in standard form.

Compare these numbers with the

WRITING ABOUT CONCEPTS

94. Revenue
The total revenue 
(in millions of dollars)
for a company is related to its advertising expense by the
function
where 
is the amount spent on advertising (in tens of
thousands of dollars). Use the graph of this function,
shown in the figure, to estimate the point on the graph at
which the function is increasing most rapidly. This point
is called the point of diminishing returns because any
expense above this amount will yield less return per 
dollar invested in advertising.
95. Numerical and Graphical Analysis
An open box is to
be made from a square piece of material, 36 inches on a
side, by cutting equal squares with sides of length from
the corners and turning up the sides (see figure).
(a) Write a function 
that represents the volume of
the box.
(b) Determine the domain of the function.
(c) Use a graphing utility to create a table that shows
box heights and the corresponding volumes 
Use
the table to estimate the dimensions that will 
produce a maximum volume.
(d) Use a graphing utility to graph

procedures are especially valuable in factoring and finding the zeros of polynomial
functions. To begin, suppose you are given the graph of

The Remainder and Factor Theorems
The remainder obtained in the synthetic division process has an important
interpretation, as described in the Remainder Theorem.
The Remainder Theorem tells you that synthetic division can be used to evaluate
a polynomial function. That is, to evaluate a polynomial function 
when 
divide 
by 
The remainder will be 
as shown in Example 5.

Solution
Using synthetic division, you obtain the following.
Because the remainder is 
you can conclude that
This means that 
is a point on the graph of 
You can check this by 
substituting 
in the original function.

Another important theorem is the Factor Theorem, which is stated below. This 
theorem states that you can test to see whether a polynomial has

Complex Numbers
■Use the imaginary unit i to write complex numbers.
■Add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers.
■Use complex conjugates to write the quotient of two complex numbers 
in standard form.
■Find complex solutions of quadratic equations.
The Imaginary Unit i
You have learned that some quadratic equations have no real solutions. For instance, the
quadratic equation 
has no real solution because there is no real number 
that can be squared to produce 
To overcome this deficiency, mathematicians 
created an expanded system of numbers using the imaginary unit i, defined as 
Imaginary unit
where 
By adding real numbers to real multiples of this imaginary unit, the
set of complex numbers is obtained. Each complex number can be written in the 
standard form 
For instance, the standard form of the complex number
is 
because
In the standard form 
the real number is called the real part of the complex
number 
and the number 
(where is a real number) is called the imaginary
part of the complex number.
The set of real numbers is a subset of the set of complex numbers, as shown in
Figure 2.21. This is true because every real number 
can be written as a complex
number using 
That is, for every real number 
you can write

DEFINITION OF A COMPLEX NUMBER
When and are real numbers, the number 
is a complex number, and it
is said to be written in standard form. When 
the number

Operations with Complex Numbers
To add (or subtract) two complex numbers, you add (or subtract) the real and imaginary
parts of the numbers separately. 
The additive identity in the complex number system is zero (the same as in the
real number system). Furthermore, the additive inverse of the complex number
is

Graphing utilities can be used to draw pictures of fractals in
the complex plane. The most famous fractal is called the
Mandelbrot Set, after the Polish-born mathematician Benoit
Mandelbrot. To construct the Mandelbrot Set, consider the 
following sequence of numbers.
The behavior of this sequence depends on the value of the
complex number 
For some values of 
this sequence is
bounded, which means that the absolute value of each
number 
in the sequence is less than
some fixed number 
For other values of 
the sequence is
unbounded, which means that the absolute values of the
terms of the sequence become infinitely large. When the
sequence is bounded, the complex number 
is in the
Mandelbrot Set. When the sequence is unbounded, the
complex number is not in the Mandelbrot Set.
(a) The pseudo code below can be translated into a program
for a graphing utility. (Programs for several models 
of graphing calculators can be found at our website

whether the complex number is in the Mandelbrot Set.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
You know that an th-degree polynomial can have at most
real zeros. In the 
complex number system, this statement can be improved. That is, in the complex
number system, every th-degree polynomial function has precisely
zeros. This
important result is derived from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, first proved
by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855).
Using the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the equivalence of zeros and 
factors, you obtain the Linear Factorization Theorem. (A proof is given in 
Appendix A.)

The Rational Zero Test
The Rational Zero Test relates the possible rational zeros of a polynomial (having 
integer coefficients) to the leading coefficient and to the constant term of the
polynomial. Recall that a rational number is any real number that can be written as the
ratio of two integers.
To use the Rational Zero Test, you should first list all rational numbers whose 
numerators are factors of the constant term and whose denominators are factors of the
leading coefficient.
Having formed this list of possible rational zeros, use a trial-and-error method to 
determine which, if any, are actual zeros of the polynomial. 
EXAMPLE

is 
a zero.
So, you can conclude that the given polynomial has no rational zeros. Note from the
graph of in Figure 2.22 that does have one real zero between 
and 0. However,
by the Rational Zero Test, you know that this real zero is not a rational number.

When the leading coefficient of a polynomial is not 1, the list of possible 
rational zeros can increase dramatically. In such cases, the search can be shortened 
in several ways: (1) a programmable graphing utility can be used to speed up the 
calculations; (2) a graph, drawn either by hand or with a graphing utility, can give a
good estimate of the locations of the zeros; and (3) synthetic division can be used to
test the possible rational zeros and to assist in factoring the polynomial.

A quadratic factor with no real zeros is said to be prime or irreducible over 
the reals. Be sure you see that this is not the same as being irreducible over the 
rationals. For example, the quadratic 
is irreducible over 
the reals (and therefore over the rationals). On the other hand, the quadratic
is irreducible over the rationals, but reducible over 
the reals.
In Example 6, if you were not told that

all zeros of the function by using synthetic division to find the real zeros

In Example 7, the 
fifth-degree polynomial function has
three real zeros. In such cases, you can
use the zoom and trace features or the
zero or root feature of a graphing utility
to approximate the real zeros. You can
then use these real zeros to determine 
the complex zeros analytically.
You can use the table feature of a graphing utility to help you 
determine which of the possible rational zeros are zeros of the polynomial in
Example 7. The table should be set to ask mode. Then enter each of the possible
rational zeros in the table. When you do this, you will see that there are two 
rational zeros,

Using a Polynomial Model
You are designing candle-making kits. Each kit contains 25 cubic inches of candle
wax and a mold for making a pyramid-shaped candle. You want the height of the 
candle to be 2 inches less than the length of each side of the candle’s square base, as
shown in Figure 2.26. What should the dimensions of your candle mold be?
Solution
The volume of a pyramid is given by 
where 
is the area of the
base and 
is the height. The area of the base is 
and the height is 
So, the
volume of the pyramid is 
Substituting 25 for the volume yields
Substitute 25 for 
Multiply each side by 3.
Write in general form.
The possible rational solutions are 
and 
Use synthetic division to test some of the possible solutions. Note that in this case,
it makes sense to test only positive -values. Using synthetic division, you can 
determine that 
is a solution and you have 
The two
solutions of the quadratic factor are imaginary and can be discarded. You can conclude
that the base of the candle mold should be 5 inches by 5 inches and the height of the
mold should be 
inches.

Introduction
A rational function is a quotient of polynomial functions. It can be written in the
form
where 
and 
are polynomials and 
is not the zero polynomial.
In general, the domain of a rational function of includes all real numbers except 
-values that make the denominator zero. Much of the discussion of rational functions
will focus on their graphical behavior near these -values excluded from the domain.
EXAMPLE
1
Finding the Domain of a Rational Function
Find the domain of the reciprocal function  
and discuss the behavior of near any excluded -values.
Solution
Because the denominator is zero when 
the domain of 
is all 
real numbers except 
To determine the behavior of near this excluded value,
evaluate 
to the left and right of 
as indicated in the tables below.
Note that as approaches 0 from the left,
decreases without bound. In contrast, as
approaches 0 from the right,
increases without bound. The graph of is shown
in Figure 2.27.

Finding Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
Find all vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the graph of each rational function.
a.
b.
Solution
a. For this rational function, the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of 
the denominator. The leading coefficient of the numerator is 2 and the leading 
coefficient of the denominator is 1, so the graph has the line 
as a horizontal
asymptote. To find any vertical asymptotes, set the denominator equal to zero and
solve the resulting equation for 
Set denominator equal to zero.
Factor.
Set 1st factor equal to 0.
Set 2nd factor equal to 0.
This equation has two real solutions,
and 
so the graph has the lines
and 
as vertical asymptotes. The graph of the function is shown in
Figure 2.30.
b. For this rational function, the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree 
of the denominator. The leading coefficient of both the numerator and denominator
is 1, so the graph has the line 
as a horizontal asymptote. To find any vertical
asymptotes, first factor the numerator and denominator as follows.
By setting the denominator 
(of the simplified function) equal to zero, you
can determine that the graph has the line 
as a vertical asymptote.

STUDY TIP
Analyzing Graphs of Rational Functions
To sketch the graph of a rational function, use the following guidelines.
The concept of test intervals from Section 2.2 can be extended to graphing of
rational functions. To do this, use the fact that a rational function can change signs only
at its zeros and its undefined values (the -values for which its denominator is zero).
Between two consecutive zeros of the numerator and the denominator, a rational 
function must be entirely positive or entirely negative. This means that when the zeros
of the numerator and the denominator of a rational function are put in order, they divide
the real number line into test intervals in which the function has no sign changes. A 
representative -value is chosen to determine if the value of the rational function is 
positive (the graph lies above the -axis) or negative (the graph lies below the -axis).

This is Some graphing utilities have difficulty graphing rational
functions that have vertical asymptotes. Often, the utility will connect parts of the
graph that are not supposed to be connected. For instance, Figure 2.31(a) shows the
graph of 
Notice that the graph should consist of two unconnected
portions—one to the left of 
and the other to the right of 
To eliminate 
this problem, you can try changing the mode of the graphing utility to 
mode. The
problem with this mode is that the graph is then represented as a collection of dots 
[as shown in Figure 2.31(b)] rather than as a smooth curve.

You may also want to test
for symmetry when graphing rational
functions, especially for simple rational
functions. For example, the graph of 
is symmetric with respect to the origin,
and the graph of

Slant Asymptotes
Consider a rational function whose denominator is of degree 1 or greater. When the
degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator, the
graph of the function has a slant (or oblique) asymptote. For example, the graph of
has a slant asymptote, as shown in Figure 2.36. To find the equation of a slant asymp-
tote, use long division. For instance, by dividing 
into 
you obtain
Slant asymptote
As increases or decreases without bound, the remainder term 
approaches
0, so the graph of approaches the line 
as shown in Figure 2.36.

There are many examples of asymptotic behavior in real life. For instance, Example
8 shows how a vertical asymptote can be used to analyze the cost of removing 
pollutants from smokestack emissions.

Cost-Benefit Model
A utility company burns coal to generate electricity. The cost of removing a certain
of the pollutants from smokestack emissions is typically not a linear function.
That is, if it costs 
dollars to remove 25% of the pollutants, it would cost more than
dollars to remove 50% of the pollutants. As the percent of removed pollutants
approaches 100%, the cost tends to increase without bound, becoming prohibitive.
The cost 
(in dollars) of removing % of the smokestack pollutants is given by
You are a member of a state legislature considering a law that would require utility
companies to remove 90% of the pollutants from their smokestack 
emissions. The current law requires 85% removal. How much additional cost would

Limits and Their
Properties
The limit process is a fundamental concept of calculus. One technique you can use to estimate a limit is to graph the
function and then determine the behavior of the graph as the independent variable approaches a specific value. (See

The limit of a function is the primary 
concept that distinguishes calculus from
algebra and analytic geometry. The 
notion of a limit is fundamental to the
study of calculus. Thus, it is important 
to acquire a good working knowledge of
limits before moving on to other topics 
in calculus.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How calculus compares with precalculus.
(3.1)
■How to find limits graphically and
numerically. (3.2)
■How to evaluate limits analytically. (3.3)
■How to determine continuity at a point
and on an open interval, and how to
determine one-sided limits. (3.4)
■How to determine infinite limits and
find vertical asymptotes. (3.5)
According to NASA, the coldest place in the known universe is the Boomerang 
nebula. The nebula is five thousand light years from Earth and has a temperature of

warmer than absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature.
How did scientists determine that absolute zero is the “lower limit” of the 
temperature of matter? (See Section 3.4, Example 6.)

What Is Calculus?
Calculus is the mathematics of change. For instance, calculus is the mathematics of
velocities, accelerations, tangent lines, slopes, areas, volumes, arc lengths, centroids,
curvatures, and a variety of other concepts that have enabled scientists, engineers, and
economists to model real-life situations.
Although precalculus mathematics also deals with velocities, accelerations,
tangent lines, slopes, and so on, there is a fundamental difference between precalculus
mathematics and calculus. Precalculus mathematics is more static, whereas 
calculus is more dynamic. Here are some examples. 
• An object traveling at a constant velocity can be analyzed with precalculus
mathematics. To analyze the velocity of an accelerating object, you need calculus. 
• The slope of a line can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics. To analyze the
slope of a curve, you need calculus.
• The curvature of a circle is constant and can be analyzed with precalculus mathe-
matics. To analyze the variable curvature of a general curve, you need calculus.
• The area of a rectangle can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics. To analyze
the area under a general curve, you need calculus.
Each of these situations involves the same general strategy—the reformulation of
precalculus mathematics through the use of a limit process. So, one way to answer the
question “What is calculus?” is to say that calculus is a “limit machine” that involves
three stages. The first stage is precalculus mathematics, such as the slope of a line or
the area of a rectangle. The second stage is the limit process, and the third stage is a
new calculus formulation, such as a derivative or integral.
Some students try to learn calculus as if it were simply a collection of new
formulas. This is unfortunate. If you reduce calculus to the memorization of differen-
tiation and integration formulas, you will miss a great deal of understanding,
self-confidence, and satisfaction.
On the following two pages are listed some familiar precalculus concepts coupled
with their calculus counterparts. Throughout the text, your goal should be to learn how
precalculus formulas and techniques are used as building blocks to produce the more
general calculus formulas and techniques. Don’t worry if you are unfamiliar with
some of the concepts listed on the following two pages—you will be reviewing all 
of them.
As you proceed through this text, come back to this discussion repeatedly. Try to
keep track of where you are relative to the three stages involved in the study of
calculus. For example, the first five chapters break down as follows.

As you progress
through this course, remember that
learning calculus is just one of your
goals. Your most important goal is to
learn how to use calculus to model
and solve real-life problems. Here
are a few problem-solving strategies
that may help you.
• Be sure you understand the ques-
tion. What is given? What are you
asked to find?
• Outline a plan. There are many
approaches you could use: look
for a pattern, solve a simpler
problem, work backwards, draw a
diagram, use technology, or any
of several other approaches. 
• Complete your plan. Be sure to
answer the question. Verbalize
your answer. For example,
rather than writing the answer as
it would be better to write
the answer as “The area of the
region is 4.6 square meters.”
• Look back at your work. Does
your answer make sense? Is 
there a way you can check the
reasonableness of your answer?

The Tangent Line Problem
The notion of a limit is fundamental to the study of calculus. The following brief
descriptions of two classic problems in calculus—the tangent line problem and the
area problem—should give you some idea of the way limits are used in calculus.
In the tangent line problem, you are given a function and a point 
on its graph
and are asked to find an equation of the tangent line to the graph at point 
as shown
in Figure 3.1.
Except for cases involving a vertical tangent line, the problem of finding the
tangent line at a point 
is equivalent to finding the slope of the tangent line at 
You
can approximate this slope by using a line through the point of tangency and a second
point on the curve, as shown in Figure 3.2(a). Such a line is called a secant line. If
is the point of tangency and 
is a second point on the graph of the slope of the secant line through these two points
can be found using precalculus and is given by
(a) The secant line through 
and 
(b) As 
approaches 
the secant lines
approach the tangent line.
Figure 3.2
As point 
approaches point 
the slopes of the secant lines approach the slope
of the tangent line, as shown in Figure 3.2(b). When such a “limiting position” exists,
the slope of the tangent line is said to be the limit of the slopes of the secant lines.
(Much more will be said about this important calculus concept in Chapter 4.)

Limits and Their Properties
The Area Problem
In the tangent line problem, you saw how the limit process can be applied to the slope
of a line to find the slope of a general curve. A second classic problem in calculus is
finding the area of a plane region that is bounded by the graphs of functions. This
problem can also be solved with a limit process. In this case, the limit process is
applied to the area of a rectangle to find the area of a general region.
As a simple example, consider the region bounded by the graph of the function
the 
axis, and the vertical lines 
and 
as shown in Figure 3.3.
You can approximate the area of the region with several rectangular regions, as shown
in Figure 3.4. As you increase the number of rectangles, the approximation tends
to become better and better because the amount of area missed by the rectangles
decreases. Your goal is to determine the limit of the sum of the areas of the rectangles
as the number of rectangles increases without bound.

HISTORICAL NOTE
In one of the most astounding events ever to
occur in mathematics, it was discovered 
that the tangent line problem and the area
problem are closely related. This discovery led
to the birth of calculus. You will learn about
the relationship between these two problems
when you study the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus in Chapter 6.

An Introduction to Limits
Suppose you are asked to sketch the graph of the function given by
For all values other than 
you can use standard curve-sketching techniques.
However, at 
it is not clear what to expect. To get an idea of the behavior of the
graph of near 
you can use two sets of 
values—one set that approaches 1
from the left and one set that approaches 1 from the right, as shown in the table.
The graph of is a parabola that has a gap at the point 
as shown in Figure
3.5. Although cannot equal 1, you can move arbitrarily close to 1, and as a result 
moves arbitrarily close to 3. Using limit notation, you can write
This is read as “the limit of 
as approaches 1 is 3.”
This discussion leads to an informal definition of limit. If 
becomes arbitrarily
close to a single number 
as 
approaches 
from either side, the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is 
This limit is written as

EXAMPLE
1
Estimating a Limit Numerically
Evaluate the function 
at several points near 
and use
the results to estimate the limit
Solution
The table lists the values of 
for several 
values near 0.
From the results shown in the table, you can estimate the limit to be 2. This limit is
reinforced by the graph of (see Figure 3.6).
■
In Example 1, note that the function is undefined at 
and yet 
appears to
be approaching a limit as 
approaches 0. This often happens, and it is important to
realize that the existence or nonexistence of 
at 
has no bearing on the
existence of the limit of 
as approaches 
EXAMPLE
2
Finding a Limit
Find the limit of 
as approaches 2, where is defined as
Solution
Because 
for all other than 
you can conclude that the limit
is 1, as shown in Figure 3.7. So, you can write
The fact that 
has no bearing on the existence or value of the limit as 
approaches 2. For instance, if the function were defined as 
the limit would be the same.
■
So far in this section, you have been estimating limits numerically and graphically.
Each of these approaches produces an estimate of the limit. In Section 3.3, you will
study analytic techniques for evaluating limits. Throughout the course, try to develop a
habit of using this three-pronged approach to problem solving.
1. Numerical approach
Construct a table of values.
2. Graphical approach
Draw a graph by hand or using technology.
3. Analytic approach
Use algebra or calculus.

Limits That Fail to Exist

Behavior That Differs from the Right and from the Left
Show that the limit 
does not exist.
Solution
Consider the graph of the function 
From Figure 3.8 and the
definition of absolute value
Definition of absolute value
you can see that 
This means that no matter how close 
gets to 0, there will be both positive and
negative 
values that yield 
or
Specifically, if 
(the lowercase
Greek letter delta) is a positive number, then for 
values satisfying the inequality
you can classify the values of 
as follows.
Because 
approaches a different number from the right side of 0 than it 
approaches from the left side, the limit 
does not exist.
EXAMPLE
4
Unbounded Behavior
Discuss the existence of the limit 
Solution
Let 
In Figure 3.9, you can see that as 
approaches 0 from
either the right or the left,
increases without bound. This means that by choosing
close enough to 0, you can force 
to be as large as you want. For instance,
will be larger than 100 if you choose that is within 
of 0. That is,
Similarly, you can force 
to be larger than 1,000,000, as follows.
Because 
is not approaching a real number 
as approaches 0, you can conclude
that the limit does not exist.

A Formal Definition of Limit
Let’s take another look at the informal definition of limit. If 
becomes arbitrarily
close to a single number 
as approaches from either side, then the limit of 
as
approaches is 
written as
At first glance, this definition looks fairly technical. Even so, it is informal because
exact meanings have not yet been given to the two phrases
“
becomes arbitrarily close to 
and
approaches 
The first person to assign mathematically rigorous meanings to these two phrases was
Augustin-Louis Cauchy. His - definition of limit is the standard used today.
In Figure 3.10, let 
(the lowercase Greek letter epsilon) represent a (small)
positive number. Then the phrase 
becomes arbitrarily close to 
means that 
lies in the interval 
Using absolute value, you can write this as
is equivalent.
Similarly, the phrase 
approaches 
means that there exists a positive number 
such that lies in either the interval 
or the interval 
This fact can
be concisely expressed by the double inequality
is equivalent.
The first inequality
The distance between and is more than 0.
expresses the fact that 
The second inequality
is within units of 
states that is within a distance of 
Some functions do not have limits as 
but those that do cannot have two 
different limits as 
That is, if the limit of a function exists, it is unique (see

Limits and Their Properties
Polynomial functions and rational functions are two of the three basic types of
algebraic functions. The following theorem deals with the limit of the third type of
algebraic function—one that involves a radical. See Appendix A for a proof of this
theorem.
The following theorem greatly expands your ability to evaluate limits because it
shows how to analyze the limit of a composite function by direct substitution. See

THE SQUARE ROOT SYMBOL
The first use of a symbol to denote the square
root can be traced to the sixteenth century.
Mathematicians first used the symbol

chosen because it resembled a lowercase r, to
stand for the Latin word radix, meaning root.

A Strategy for Finding Limits
On the previous three pages, you studied several types of functions whose limits can
be evaluated by direct substitution. This knowledge, together with the following 
theorem, can be used to develop a strategy for finding limits. A proof of this theorem
is given in Appendix A.

Finding the Limit of a Function
Find the limit:

By factoring and dividing out like factors,
you can rewrite as

values other than 
the functions and

1. Learn to recognize which limits can be evaluated by direct substitution.

tion, try to find a function 
that agrees with for all 
other than

Limits and Their Properties
Dividing Out and Rationalizing Techniques
Two techniques for finding limits analytically are shown in Examples 6 and 7. The
dividing out technique involves dividing out common factors, and the rationalizing
technique involves rationalizing the numerator of a fractional expression.
EXAMPLE
6
Dividing Out Technique
Find the limit:
Solution
Although you are taking the limit of a rational function, you cannot apply
Theorem 3.3 because the limit of the denominator is 0.
Direct substitution fails.
Because the limit of the numerator is also 0, the numerator and denominator have 
a common factor of 
So, for all 
you can divide out this factor 
to obtain 
Using Theorem 3.6, it follows that
Apply Theorem 3.6.
Use direct substitution.
This result is shown graphically in Figure 3.16. Note that the graph of the function 
coincides with the graph of the function 
except that the graph of has
a gap at the point 
■
In Example 6, direct substitution produced the meaningless fractional form 
An expression such as 
is called an indeterminate form because you cannot (from
the form alone) determine the limit. When you try to evaluate a limit and encounter
this form, remember that you must rewrite the fraction so that the new denominator
does not have 0 as its limit. One way to do this is to divide out like factors, as shown
in Example 6. A second way is to rationalize the numerator, as shown in Example 7.

This is Because the graphs of
and
differ only at the point 
a standard graphing utility setting may 
not distinguish clearly between these graphs. However, because of the pixel
configuration and rounding error of a graphing utility, it may be possible to find
screen settings that distinguish between the graphs. Specifically, by repeatedly
zooming in near the point 
on the graph of your graphing utility may
show glitches or irregularities that do not exist on the actual graph. (See Figure
3.17.) By changing the screen settings on your graphing utility, you may obtain
the correct graph of f.

Continuity at a Point and on an Open Interval
In Section 2.2, you learned about the continuity of a polynomial function. In this 
section, you will add to your understanding of continuity by studying continuity at a
point and on an open interval 
Informally, to say that a function is continuous 
at 
means that there is no interruption in the graph of at 
That is, its graph is
unbroken at and there are no holes, jumps, or gaps. Figure 3.20 identifies three values
of at which the graph of is not continuous. At all other points in the interval 
the graph of is uninterrupted and continuous.
Three conditions exist for which the graph of is not continuous at 
Figure 3.20
In Figure 3.20, it appears that continuity at 
can be destroyed by any one of
the following conditions.
1. The function is not defined at 
2. The limit of 
does not exist at 
3. The limit of 
exists at 
but it is not equal to

DEFINITION OF CONTINUITY
Continuity at a Point:

Informally, you might say that a
function is continuous on an open
interval if its graph can be drawn
with a pencil without lifting the
pencil from the paper. Use a graph-
ing utility to graph each function
on the given interval. From the
graphs, which functions would you
say are continuous on the interval?
Do you think you can trust the
results you obtained graphically?
Explain your reasoning.

Consider an open interval that contains a real number 
If a function is defined
on 
(except possibly at ), and 
is not continuous at 
then 
is said to have a
discontinuity at 
Discontinuities fall into two categories: removable and 
nonremovable. A discontinuity at is called removable if can be made continuous
by appropriately defining (or redefining) 
For instance, the functions shown in
Figures 3.21(a) and (c) have removable discontinuities at and the function shown in
Figure 3.21(b) has a nonremovable discontinuity at

Some people may refer 
to the function in Example 1(a) as
“discontinuous.” We have found that 
this terminology can be confusing.
Rather than saying that the function is 
discontinuous, we prefer to say that it
has a discontinuity at x  0.

Limits and Their Properties
One-Sided Limits and Continuity on a Closed Interval
To understand continuity on a closed interval, you first need to look at a different type
of limit called a one-sided limit. For example, the limit from the right (or right-hand
limit) means that approaches from values greater than [see Figure 3.23(a)]. This
limit is denoted as
Similarly, the limit from the left (or left-hand limit) means that approaches from
values less than [see Figure 3.23(b)]. This limit is denoted as
One-sided limits are useful in taking limits of functions involving radicals. For
instance, if is an even integer,

The Greatest Integer Function
Find the limit of the greatest integer function

Solution
As shown in Figure 3.25, the limit as approaches 0 from the left is given
by
and the limit as approaches 0 from the right is given by
The greatest integer function has a discontinuity at zero because the left and right 
limits at zero are different. By similar reasoning, you can see that the greatest integer 
function has a discontinuity at any integer

When the limit from the left is not equal to the limit from the right, the (two-

this theorem follows directly from the definition of a one-sided limit.

The concept of a one-sided limit allows you to extend the definition of continuity
to closed intervals. Basically, a function is continuous on a closed interval if it is
continuous in the interior of the interval and exhibits one-sided continuity at the 
endpoints. This is stated formally as follows.
Similar definitions can be made to cover continuity on intervals of the form 
and 
that are neither open nor closed, or on infinite intervals. For example, the
function
is continuous on the infinite interval 
and the function

Charles’s Law and Absolute Zero
On the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is the temperature 0 K. Although temperatures very
close to 0 K have been produced in laboratories, absolute zero has never been attained.
In fact, evidence suggests that absolute zero cannot be attained. How did scientists
determine that 0 K is the “lower limit” of the temperature of matter? What is absolute
zero on the Celsius scale?
Solution
The determination of absolute zero stems from the work of the French
physicist Jacques Charles (1746–1823). Charles discovered that the volume of gas at
a constant pressure increases linearly with the temperature of the gas. The table
illustrates this relationship between volume and temperature. To generate the values
in the table, one mole of hydrogen is held at a constant pressure of one atmosphere.
The volume 
is approximated and is measured in liters, and the temperature 
is
measured in degrees Celsius.
The points represented by the table are shown in Figure 3.29. Moreover, by using the
points in the table, you can determine that 
and 
are related by the linear equation
or
By reasoning that the volume of the gas can approach 0 (but can never equal or go
below 0), you can determine that the “least possible temperature” is given by
Use direct substitution.
So, absolute zero on the Kelvin scale 0 K is approximately 
on the Celsius
scale.

Properties of Continuity
In Section 3.3, you studied several properties of limits. Each of those properties yields
a corresponding property pertaining to the continuity of a function. For instance,
Theorem 3.9 follows directly from Theorem 3.2. (A proof of Theorem 3.9 is given in
Appendix A.)
The following types of functions are continuous at every point in their domains.
1. Polynomial:
2. Rational:
3. Radical:
By combining Theorem 3.9 with this summary, you can conclude that a wide
variety of elementary functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

The Intermediate Value Theorem
Theorem 3.11 is an important theorem concerning the behavior of functions that are
continuous on a closed interval.
As a simple example of the application of this theorem, consider a person’s
height. Suppose that a girl is 5 feet tall on her thirteenth birthday and 5 feet 7 inches
tall on her fourteenth birthday. Then, for any height between 5 feet and 5 feet 7 inches,
there must have been a time when her height was exactly 
This seems reasonable
because human growth is continuous and a person’s height does not abruptly change
from one value to another.
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one number
in the closed interval 
There may, of course, be more than one number such
that 
as shown in Figure 3.30. A function that is not continuous does not
necessarily exhibit the intermediate value property. For example, the graph of the
function shown in Figure 3.31 jumps over the horizontal line given by 
and for
this function there is no value of in 
such that 
The Intermediate Value Theorem often can be used to locate the zeros of a
function that is continuous on a closed interval. Specifically, if is continuous on 
and 
and 
differ in sign, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the 
existence of at least one zero of in the closed interval

Because

it follows that

the zero must lie in the interval

You can also use the zoom feature of a graphing utility to approxi-
mate the real zeros of a continuous function. By repeatedly zooming in on the 
point where the graph crosses the -axis, and adjusting the -axis scale, you can
approximate the zero of the function to any desired accuracy. The zero of
is approximately 0.453, as shown in Figure 3.33.

Determining Infinite Limits from a Graph
Determine the limit of each function shown in Figure 3.36 as approaches 1 from the
left and from the right.
(a)
(b)
Each graph has an asymptote at 
Figure 3.36
Solution
a. When approaches 1 from the left or the right,
is a small positive number.
Thus, the quotient 
is a large positive number and 
approaches 
infinity from each side of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from each side is infinity.
Figure 3.36(a) confirms this analysis.
b. When 
approaches 1 from the left,
is a small negative number. Thus, the
quotient 
is a large positive number and 
approaches infinity from
the left of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from the left side is infinity.
When 
approaches 1 from the right,
is a small positive number. Thus, the
quotient 
is a large negative number and 
approaches negative 
infinity from the right of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from the right side is negative infinity.

In Example 1, note that each of the functions is a quotient and that the vertical
asymptote occurs at a number at which the denominator is 0 (and the numerator is not
0). The next theorem generalizes this observation. (A proof of this theorem is given in
Appendix A.)

Finding Vertical Asymptotes
Determine all vertical asymptotes of the graph of each function.

Solution
a. When 
the denominator of

is a vertical asymptote, as shown in Figure 3.37(a).
b. By factoring the denominator as
you can see that the denominator is 0 at 
and 
Moreover, because the
numerator is not 0 at these two points, you can apply Theorem 3.12 to conclude
that the graph of has two vertical asymptotes, as shown in Figure 3.37(b).
c. When 
the denominator of
is 0 and the numerator is not 0. So, by Theorem 3.12, you can conclude that 
is a vertical asymptote, as shown in Figure 3.37(c).
■
Theorem 3.12 requires that the value of the numerator at 
be nonzero. If
both the numerator and the denominator are 0 at 
you obtain the indeterminate
form
and you cannot determine the limit behavior at 
without further 
investigation, as illustrated in Example 3. Refer to Example 6 in Section 3.3 to review

Differentiation
To approximate the slope of a tangent line to a graph at a given point, find the slope of the secant line through the
given point and a second point on the graph. As the second point approaches the given point, the approximation tends
to become more accurate. (See Section 4.1.)
Al Bello/Getty Images
In this chapter you will study one of the
most important processes of calculus–
differentiation. In each section, you will
learn new methods and rules for finding
derivatives of functions. Then you will
apply these rules to find such things as
velocity, acceleration, and the rates of
change of two or more related variables.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How to find the derivative of a function
using the limit definition and understand
the relationship between differentiability
and continuity. (4.1)
■How to find the derivative of a function
using basic differentiation rules. (4.2)
■How to find the derivative of a function
using the Product Rule and the Quotient
Rule. (4.3)
■How to find the derivative of a function
using the Chain Rule and the General
Power Rule. (4.4)
■How to find the derivative of a function
using implicit differentiation. (4.5)
■How to find a related rate. (4.6)
When jumping from a platform, a diver’s velocity is briefly positive because of the
upward movement, but then becomes negative when falling. How can you use calculus
to determine the velocity of a diver at impact? (See Section 4.2, Example 9.)

■Find the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point.
■Use the limit definition to find the derivative of a function.
■Understand the relationship between differentiability and continuity.
The Tangent Line Problem
Calculus grew out of four major problems that European mathematicians were working
on during the seventeenth century.
1. The tangent line problem (Section 3.1 and this section)
2. The velocity and acceleration problem (Sections 4.2 and 4.3)
3. The minimum and maximum problem (Section 5.1)
4. The area problem (Sections 3.1 and 6.2)
Each problem involves the notion of a limit, and calculus can be introduced with any
of the four problems.
A brief introduction to the tangent line problem is given in Section 3.1. Although
partial solutions to this problem were given by Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665), René
Descartes (1596–1650), Christian Huygens (1629–1695), and Isaac Barrow
(1630–1677), credit for the first general solution is usually given to Isaac Newton
(1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Newton’s work on this problem
stemmed from his interest in optics and light refraction.
What does it mean to say that a line is tangent to a curve at a point? For a circle,
the tangent line at a point 
is the line that is perpendicular to the radial line at point
as shown in Figure 4.1.
For a general curve, however, the problem is more difficult. For example, how
would you define the tangent lines shown in Figure 4.2? You might say that a line is
tangent to a curve at a point 
if it touches, but does not cross, the curve at point 
This definition would work for the first curve shown in Figure 4.2, but not for the
second. Or you might say that a line is tangent to a curve if the line touches or
intersects the curve at exactly one point. This definition would work for a circle but
not for more general curves, as the third curve in Figure 4.2 shows.

Essentially, the problem of finding the tangent line at a point 
boils down to the
problem of finding the slope of the tangent line at point 
You can approximate this
slope using a secant line* through the point of tangency and a second point on the
curve, as shown in Figure 4.3. If 
is the point of tangency and

The beauty of this procedure is that you can obtain more and more accurate
approximations of the slope of the tangent line by choosing points closer and closer
to the point of tangency, as shown in Figure 4.4.

THE TANGENT LINE PROBLEM
In 1637, mathematician René Descartes stated
this about the tangent line problem:
“And I dare say that this is not only the most
useful and general problem in geometry that
I know, but even that I ever desire to know.”

The Slope of the Graph of a Linear Function

To find the slope of the graph of when 
you can apply the defini-

The graph of a linear function has the same slope at any point. This is not true of
nonlinear functions, as shown in the following example.

The definition of a tangent line to a curve does not cover the possibility of a
vertical tangent line. For vertical tangent lines, you can use the following definition.
If is continuous at and
or
the vertical line 
passing through 
is a vertical tangent line to the graph
of 
For example, the function shown in Figure 4.7 has a vertical tangent line at
If the domain of is the closed interval 
you can extend the definition
of a vertical tangent line to include the endpoints by considering continuity and 
limits from the right 
and from the left 
The Derivative of a Function
You have now arrived at a crucial point in the study of calculus. The limit used to
define the slope of a tangent line is also used to define one of the two fundamental
operations of calculus—differentiation.
Be sure you see that the derivative of a function of is also a function of 
This
“new” function gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at the point 
provided that the graph has a tangent line at this point.
The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation. A
function is differentiable at if its derivative exists at and is differentiable on an
open interval 
if it is differentiable at every point in the interval.
In addition to 
which is read as “ prime of ,” other notations are used to
denote the derivative of 
The most common are
The notation 
is read as “the derivative of 
with respect to ” or simply “

Differentiability and Continuity
The following alternative limit form of the derivative is useful in investigating the
relationship between differentiability and continuity. The derivative of at is
provided this limit exists (see Figure 4.10). (A proof of the equivalence of this form
is given in Appendix A.) Note that the existence of the limit in this alternative form
requires that the one-sided limits
and
exist and are equal. These one-sided limits are called the derivatives from the left
and from the right, respectively. It follows that

interval 
if it is differentiable on

The Power Rule
Before proving the next rule, it is important to review the procedure for expanding a
binomial.
The general binomial expansion for a positive integer is

This binomial expansion is used in proving a special case of the Power Rule.
When using the Power Rule, the case for which

separate differentiation rule. That is,

Rates of Change
You have seen how the derivative is used to determine slope. The derivative can also be
used to determine the rate of change of one variable with respect to another. Applications
involving rates of change occur in a wide variety of fields. A few examples are
population growth rates, production rates, water flow rates, velocity, and acceleration.
A common use for rate of change is to describe the motion of an object moving
in a straight line. In such problems, it is customary to use either a horizontal or a
vertical line with a designated origin to represent the line of motion. On such lines,
movement to the right (or upward) is considered to be in the positive direction, and
movement to the left (or downward) is considered to be in the negative direction.
The function 
that gives the position (relative to the origin) of an object as a
function of time is called a position function. If, over a period of time 
the object
changes its position by the amount 
then, by the familiar
formula
the average velocity is

a. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 
feet to a height of 
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
b. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of 
64 feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
c. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of 
80.64 feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
Note that the average velocities are 
indicating that the object is moving
downward.

Basic Differentiation Rules and Rates of Change
279
Suppose that in Example 8 you wanted to find the instantaneous velocity (or
simply the velocity) of the object when 
Just as you can approximate the slope
of the tangent line by calculating the slope of the secant line, you can approximate the
velocity at 
by calculating the average velocity over a small interval 
(see Figure 4.18). By taking the limit as 
approaches zero, you obtain the velocity
when 
Try doing this—you will find that the velocity when 
is 
feet
per second.
In general, if 
is the position function for an object moving along a
straight line, the velocity of the object at time is
In other words, the velocity function is the derivative of the position function. Velocity
can be negative, zero, or positive. The speed of an object is the absolute value of its
velocity. Speed cannot be negative.
The position of a free-falling object (neglecting air resistance) under the influence
of gravity can be represented by the equation
where 
is the initial height of the object,
is the initial velocity of the object, and 
is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the value of is approximately 
feet
per second per second or 
meters per second per second.
EXAMPLE

Using the Derivative to Find Velocity
At time 
a diver jumps from a platform diving board that is 32 feet above the
water (see Figure 4.19). The position of the diver is given by
Position function
where is measured in feet and is measured in seconds.
a. When does the diver hit the water?
b. What is the diver’s velocity at impact?
Solution
a. To find the time when the diver hits the water, let 
and solve for .
Set position function equal to 0.
Factor.
Solve for 
Because 
choose the positive value to conclude that the diver hits the water
at 
seconds.
b. The velocity at time 
is given by the derivative 
So, the
velocity at time 
is
feet per second.

In Section 4.2 you learned that the derivative of the sum of two functions is simply the
sum of their derivatives. The rules for the derivatives of the product and quotient of

Note that

is continuous.
The Product Rule can be extended to cover products involving more than two
factors. For example, if

of the derivatives of the two functions. To see this, try comparing the product of the

Product and Quotient Rules and Higher-Order Derivatives
287
Note the use of parentheses in Example 3. A liberal use of parentheses is 
recommended for 
types of differentiation problems. For instance, with the
Quotient Rule, it is a good idea to enclose all factors and derivatives in parentheses,
and to pay special attention to the subtraction required in the numerator. 
When differentiation rules were introduced in the preceding section, the need for
rewriting 
differentiating was emphasized. The next example illustrates this
point with the Quotient Rule.

each quotient in the next example can be considered as the product of a constant times

Differentiation
The summary below shows that much of the work in obtaining a simplified form
of a derivative occurs 
differentiating. Note that two characteristics of a simplified
form are the absence of negative exponents and the combining of like terms.
For a quotient with a monomial denominator, it may be advantageous to factor
and reduce or rewrite the quotient as a sum or difference before differentiating, as
shown below.

Higher-Order Derivatives
Just as you can obtain a velocity function by differentiating a position function, you
can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating a velocity function. Another
way of looking at this is that you can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating
a position function 
Position function
Velocity function
rate of change in position
Acceleration function
rate of change in velocity
The function given by 
is the second derivative of 
and is denoted by 
The second derivative is an example of a higher-order derivative. You can define
derivatives of any positive integer order. For instance, the third derivative is the 
derivative of the second derivative. Higher-order derivatives are denoted as follows.
First derivative:
Second derivative:
Third derivative:

Finding the Acceleration Due to Gravity
Because the moon has no atmosphere, a falling object on the moon encounters no air
resistance. In 1971, astronaut David Scott demonstrated that a feather and a hammer
fall at the same rate on the moon. The position function for each of these falling
objects is given by
where 
is the height in meters and is the time in seconds. What is the ratio of
Earth’s gravitational force to the moon’s?
Solution
To find the acceleration, differentiate the position function twice.
Position function
Velocity function
Acceleration function
So, the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 
meters per second per
second. Because the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 
meters per second
per second, the ratio of Earth’s gravitational force to the moon’s is

THE MOON
The moon’s mass is 
kilograms,
and Earth’s mass is 
kilograms.
The moon’s radius is 1737 kilometers, and
Earth’s radius is 6378 kilometers. Because
the gravitational force on the surface of a
planet is directly proportional to its mass and
inversely proportional to the square of its
radius, the ratio of the gravitational force on
Earth to the gravitational force on the moon is

■Simplify the derivative of a function using algebra.
The Chain Rule
This text has yet to discuss one of the most powerful differentiation rules—the Chain
Rule. This rule deals with composite functions and adds a surprising versatility to the
rules discussed in the two previous sections. For example, compare the functions
shown below. Those on the left can be differentiated without the Chain Rule, and those
on the right are best differentiated with the Chain Rule.
Basically, the Chain Rule states that if 
changes 
times as fast as 
and 
changes 
times as fast as 
then changes 
times as fast as 
EXAMPLE
1
The Derivative of a Composite Function
A set of gears is constructed, as shown in Figure 4.22, such that the second and third
gears are on the same axle. As the first axle revolves, it drives the second axle, which in
turn drives the third axle. Let 
and represent the numbers of revolutions per minute
of the first, second, and third axles, respectively. Find 
and 
and
show that
Solution
Because the circumference of the second gear is three times that of the first,
the first axle must make three revolutions to turn the second axle once. Similarly, the
second axle must make two revolutions to turn the third axle once, and you can write
and
Combining these two results, you know that the first axle must make six revolutions
to turn the third axle once. So, you can write
.
In other words, the rate of change of 
with respect to 
is the product of the rate of
change of with respect to and the rate of change of with respect to

Example 1 illustrates a simple case of the Chain Rule. The general rule is stated
below.
When applying the Chain Rule, it is helpful to think of the composite function
as having two parts—an inner function and an outer function, as discussed in
Section 1.4.

The derivative of

differentiating very complicated
functions. Often, however, the result 
is given in unsimplified form. If you

Implicit Differentiation
■Distinguish between functions written in implicit form and explicit form.
■Use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of a function.
Implicit and Explicit Functions
Up to this point in the text, most functions have been expressed in explicit form. For
example, in the equation
Explicit form
the variable 
is explicitly written as a function of 
Some functions, however, are
only implied by an equation. For instance, the function 
is defined implicitly
by the equation 
Suppose you were asked to find 
for this equation. You
could begin by writing explicitly as a function of and then differentiating.
This strategy works whenever you can solve for the function explicitly. You cannot,
however, use this procedure when you are unable to solve for as a function of 
For
instance, how would you find 
for the equation
where it is very difficult to express as a function of explicitly? To do this, you can
use implicit differentiation.
To understand how to find 
implicitly, you must realize that the differentia-
tion is taking place with respect to 
This means that when you differentiate terms
involving 
alone, you can differentiate as usual. However, when you differentiate
terms involving 
you must apply the Chain Rule, because you are assuming that is
defined implicitly as a differentiable function of

rotation of the graph of the
original equation.
b. Set the graphing utility to

Slope of Graph
Point on Graph

It is meaningless to solve for 
in an equation that has no solution points.
(For example,
has no solution points.) If, however, a segment of a
graph can be represented by a differentiable function,
will have meaning as the
slope at each point on the segment. Recall that a function is not differentiable at (a)
points with vertical tangents and (b) points at which the function is not continuous.

an appropriate use of the original equation. A similar technique can be used to find

ISAAC BARROW (1630–1677)
The graph in Figure 4.29 is called the kappa
curve because it resembles the Greek letter
kappa, 
The general solution for the 
tangent line to this curve was discovered 
by the English mathematician Isaac Barrow.
Newton was Barrow’s student, and they 
corresponded frequently regarding their work
in the early development of calculus.

Finding Related Rates
You have seen how the Chain Rule can be used to find 
implicitly. Another
important use of the Chain Rule is to find the rates of change of two or more related
variables that are changing with respect to time.
For example, when water is drained out of a conical tank (see Figure 4.30), the
volume 
the radius 
and the height 
of the water level are all functions of time 
Knowing that these variables are related by the equation

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING RELATED-RATE PROBLEMS
1. Identify all given quantities and quantities to be determined. Make a sketch
and label the quantities.
2. Write an equation involving the variables whose rates of change either are
given or are to be determined.
3. Using the Chain Rule, implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with
respect to time 
4. After completing Step 3, substitute into the resulting equation all known
values for the variables and their rates of change. Then solve for the required
rate of change.
t.
NOTE
When using these guidelines,
be sure you perform Step 3 before 
Step 4. Substituting the known values 
of the variables before differentiating
will produce an inappropriate derivative.
Total area increases as the outer radius increases.

An Inflating Balloon
Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon (see Figure 4.32) at a rate of 4.5 cubic
feet per minute. Find the rate of change of the radius when the radius is 2 feet.
Solution
Let 
be the volume of the balloon and let 
be its radius. Because the 
volume is increasing at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute, you know that at time the
rate of change of the volume is 
So, the problem can be stated as shown.
Given rate:
(constant rate)
Find:

To find the rate of change of the radius, you must find an equation that relates the
radius to the volume 
Equation:

Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to produces

Solve for 
Finally, when 
the rate of change of the radius is
foot per minute.
■
In Example 3, note that the volume is increasing at a constant rate but the radius
is increasing at a variable rate. Just because two rates are related does not mean that
they are proportional. In this particular case, the radius is growing more and more
slowly as increases. Do you see why?

Applications 
of Differentiation
In Chapter 5, you will use calculus to analyze graphs of functions. For example, you can use the derivative of a function
to determine the function’s maximum and minimum values. You can use limits to identify any asymptotes of the 
function’s graph. In Section 5.6, you will combine these techniques to sketch the graph of a function.
E.J. Baumeister Jr. / Alamy
This chapter discusses several applications
of the derivative of a function. These
applications fall into three basic
categories—curve sketching, optimization,
and approximation techniques.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How to use a derivative to locate the
minimum and maximum values of a
function on a closed interval. (5.1)
■How numerous results in this chapter
depend on two important theorems
called Rolle’s Theorem and the Mean
Value Theorem. (5.2)
■How to use the first derivative to deter-
mine whether a function is increasing 
or decreasing. (5.3)
■How to use the second derivative to
determine whether the graph of a 
function is concave upward or concave
downward. (5.4)
■How to find horizontal asymptotes of
the graph of a function. (5.5)
■How to graph a function using the 
techniques from Chapters P–5. (5.6)
■How to solve optimization problems.
(5.7)
■How to use approximation techniques 
to solve problems. (5.8)
A small aircraft starts its descent from an altitude of 1 mile, 4 miles west of the
runway. Given a function that models the glide path of the plane, when would the
plane be descending at the greatest rate? (See Section 5.4, Exercise 65.)

■Understand the definition of extrema of a function on an interval.
■Understand the definition of relative extrema of a function on an open interval.
■Find extrema on a closed interval.
Extrema of a Function
In calculus, much effort is devoted to determining the behavior of a function on an
interval 
Does have a maximum value on 
Does it have a minimum value? Where
is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? In Section 1.2, you answered these
questions using graphical and numerical analysis. In this chapter, you will learn how
derivatives can be used to answer these questions. You will also see why these 
questions are important in real-life applications.
A function need not have a minimum or a maximum on an interval. For instance,
in Figure 5.1(a) and (b), you can see that the function 
has both a
minimum and a maximum on the closed interval 
but does not have a maxi-
mum on the open interval 
Moreover, in Figure 5.1(c), you can see that
continuity (or the lack of it) can affect the existence of an extremum on the interval.
This suggests the theorem below. (Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively
plausible, a proof of this theorem is not within the scope of this text.)

The minimum and maximum of a function on an interval are the extreme

function on the interval. The minimum and maximum of a function on an
interval are also called the absolute minimum and absolute maximum, or
the global minimum and global maximum, on the interval.

Relative Extrema and Critical Numbers
In Figure 5.2, the graph of 
has a relative maximum at the point
and a relative minimum at the point 
Informally, for a continuous 
function, you can think of a relative maximum as occurring on a “hill” on the graph,
and a relative minimum as occurring in a “valley” on the graph. Such a hill and 
valley can occur in two ways. If the hill (or valley) is smooth and rounded, the graph
has a horizontal tangent line at the high point (or low point). If the hill (or valley) is
sharp and peaked, the graph represents a function that is not differentiable at the high
point (or low point).
Example 1 examines the derivatives of functions at 
relative extrema. (Much
more is said about 
the relative extrema of a function in Section 5.3.)

Case 1: If is

Case 2: If

Suppose

which implies that there exists an interval 
containing such that

[See Exercise 62(b), Section 3.2.]
Because this quotient is positive, the signs of the denominator and numerator must
agree. This produces the following inequalities for -values in the interval 
Left of c:

Right of c:

So, the assumption that

only one possibility—namely,
So, by definition,

PIERRE DE FERMAT (1601–1665)
For Fermat, who was trained as a lawyer,
mathematics was more of a hobby than a
profession. Nevertheless, Fermat made many
contributions to analytic geometry, number
theory, calculus, and probability. In letters to
friends, he wrote of many of the fundamental
ideas of calculus, long before Newton or
Leibniz. For instance, Theorem 5.2 is sometimes
attributed to Fermat.

Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval
Theorem 5.2 states that the relative extrema of a function can occur only at the critical
numbers of the function. Knowing this, you can use the following guidelines to find
extrema on a closed interval.
The next three examples show how to apply these guidelines. Be sure you see that
finding the critical numbers of the function is only part of the procedure. Evaluating
the function at the critical numbers and the endpoints is the other part.
EXAMPLE

Solution
Begin by differentiating the function.
Write original function.
Differentiate.
To find the critical numbers of 
you must find all -values for which 
and
all -values for which 
does not exist.
Set 
equal to 0.
Factor.
Critical numbers
Because 
is defined for all 
you can conclude that these are the only critical
numbers of 
By evaluating at these two critical numbers and at the endpoints of
you can determine that the maximum is 
and the minimum is
as shown in the table. The graph of is shown in Figure 5.5.
■
In Figure 5.5, note that the critical number 
does not yield a relative
minimum or a relative maximum. This tells you that the converse of Theorem 5.2 is
not true. In other words, the critical numbers of a function need not produce relative
extrema.

Solution
Begin by differentiating the function.
Write original function.
Differentiate.
From this derivative, you can see that the function has two critical numbers in the
interval 
The number 1 is a critical number because
and the 
number 0 is a critical number because 
does not exist. By evaluating at these two
numbers and at the endpoints of the interval, you can conclude that the minimum is

interval 
The number 0 is a critical number because 
and the

■Understand and use Rolle’s Theorem.
■Understand and use the Mean Value Theorem.
Rolle’s Theorem
The Extreme Value Theorem (Section 5.1) states that a continuous function on a
closed interval 
must have both a minimum and a maximum on the interval. Both
of these values, however, can occur at the endpoints. Rolle’s Theorem, named after
the French mathematician Michel Rolle (1652–1719), gives conditions that guarantee
the existence of an extreme value in the interior of a closed interval.
From Rolle’s Theorem, you can see that if a function is continuous on 
and
differentiable on 
and if 
there must be at least one -value between
and 
at which the graph of has a horizontal tangent, as shown in Figure 5.8(a). 
If the differentiability requirement is dropped from Rolle’s Theorem,
will still have
a critical number in 
but it may not yield a horizontal tangent. Such a case is
shown in Figure 5.8(b).

ROLLE’S THEOREM
French mathematician Michel Rolle first
published the theorem that bears his name in
1691. Before this time, however, Rolle was one
of the most vocal critics of calculus, stating
that it gave erroneous results and was based
on unsound reasoning. Later in life, Rolle
came to see the usefulness of calculus.

The Mean Value Theorem
Rolle’s Theorem can be used to prove another theorem—the Mean Value Theorem.
Although the Mean Value Theorem can be used directly in problem solving, it is
used more often to prove other theorems. In fact, some people consider this to be the
most important theorem in calculus—it is closely related to the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus discussed in Section 6.4. For now, you can get an idea of the versatility of
the Mean Value Theorem by looking at the results stated in Exercises 65–70 in this
section.
The Mean Value Theorem has implications for both basic interpretations of the
derivative. Geometrically, the theorem guarantees the existence of a tangent line that
is parallel to the secant line through the points 
and 
as shown in
Figure 5.12. Example 3 illustrates this geometric interpretation of the Mean Value
Theorem. In terms of rates of change, the Mean Value Theorem implies that there
must be a point in the open interval 
at which the instantaneous rate of change is
equal to the average rate of change over the interval 
This is illustrated in

JOSEPH-LOUIS LAGRANGE (1736–1813)
The Mean Value Theorem was first proved 
by the famous mathematician Joseph-Louis
Lagrange. Born in Italy, Lagrange held a 
position in the court of Frederick the Great 
in Berlin for 20 years. Afterward, he moved 
to France, where he met emperor Napoleon
Bonaparte, who is quoted as saying,
“Lagrange is the lofty pyramid of the 
mathematical sciences.”

EXAMPLE
4
Finding an Instantaneous Rate of Change
Two stationary patrol cars equipped with radar are 5 miles apart on a highway, as
shown in Figure 5.14. As a truck passes the first patrol car, its speed is clocked at 
55 miles per hour. Four minutes later, when the truck passes the second patrol car, its
speed is clocked at 50 miles per hour. Prove that the truck must have exceeded the
speed limit (of 55 miles per hour) at some time during the 4 minutes.
Solution
Let 
be the time (in hours) when the truck passes the first patrol car.
The time when the truck passes the second patrol car is
By letting 
represent the distance (in miles) traveled by the truck, you have
and 
So, the average velocity of the truck over the five-mile stretch
of highway is
miles per hour.
Assuming that the position function is differentiable, you can apply the Mean Value
Theorem to conclude that the truck must have been traveling at a rate of 75 miles per
hour sometime during the 4 minutes.

Increasing and Decreasing Functions and the First Derivative Test
■Determine intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.
■Apply the First Derivative Test to find relative extrema of a function.
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
In this section, you will learn how derivatives can be used to 
relative extrema
as either relative minima or relative maxima. First, it is important to review the 
definitions of increasing and decreasing functions.
A function is increasing if,
its graph moves up, and is
decreasing if its graph moves down. For example, the function in Figure 5.15 is
decreasing on the interval 
is constant on the interval 
and is increasing
on the interval 
As shown in Theorem 5.5 below, a positive derivative implies
that the function is increasing; a negative derivative implies that the function is
decreasing; and a zero derivative on an entire interval implies that the function is 
constant on that interval.

Example 1 gives you one example of how to find intervals on which a function is
increasing or decreasing. The guidelines below summarize the steps followed in that
example.
A function is strictly monotonic on an interval if it is either increasing on the
entire interval or decreasing on the entire interval. For instance, the function 
is strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is increasing on the
entire real number line, as shown in Figure 5.17(a). The function shown in Figure
5.17(b) is not strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is constant
on the interval 0, 1.

2. Determine the sign of

The First Derivative Test
After you have determined the intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing,
it is not difficult to locate the relative extrema of the function. For instance, in Figure
5.18 (from Example 1), the function
has a relative maximum at the point 
because is increasing immediately to the
left of 
and decreasing immediately to the right of 
Similarly,
has a
relative minimum at the point 
because is decreasing immediately to the left 
of 
and increasing immediately to the right of 
The following theorem,
called the First Derivative Test, makes this more explicit.

Comparing Graphical and Analytic Approaches
From Section 5.2, you
know that, by itself, a graphing utility can give misleading information about
the relative extrema of a graph. Used in conjunction with an analytic
approach, however, a graphing utility can provide a good way to reinforce
your conclusions. Use a graphing utility to graph the function in Example 2.
Then use the 
and 
features to estimate the relative extrema. How
close are your graphical approximations?

■Determine intervals on which a function is concave upward or concave downward.
■Find any points of inflection of the graph of a function.
■Apply the Second Derivative Test to find relative extrema of a function.
Concavity
You have already seen that locating the intervals in which a function increases or
decreases helps to describe its graph. In this section, you will see how locating the
intervals in which 
increases or decreases can be used to determine where the graph
of is 
or 
The following graphical interpretation of concavity is useful. (See Appendix A
for a proof of these results.)
1. Let be differentiable on an open interval 
If the graph of is concave upward on
then the graph of lies 
all of its tangent lines on 
[See Figure 5.23(a).]
2. Let be differentiable on an open interval 
If the graph of is concave downward
on 
then the graph of lies 
all of its tangent lines on 
[See Figure 5.23(b).]
(a) The graph of lies above its tangent lines.
(b) The graph of lies below its tangent lines.
Figure 5.23
To find the open intervals on which the graph of a function is concave upward
or concave downward, you need to find the intervals on which 
is increasing or
decreasing. For instance, the graph of
is concave downward on the open interval 
because 
is
decreasing there. (See Figure 5.24.) Similarly, the graph of is concave upward on the
interval 
because 
is increasing on 0, .

Concavity and the Second Derivative Test
349
The following theorem shows how to use the 
derivative of a function 
to determine intervals on which the graph of is concave upward or concave down-
ward. A proof of this theorem (see Appendix A) follows directly from Theorem 5.5
and the definition of concavity.
To apply Theorem 5.7, locate the -values at which 
or 
does not exist.
Second, use these -values to determine test intervals. Finally, test the sign of 
in
each of the test intervals.
EXAMPLE

is concave upward or downward.
Solution
Begin by observing that is continuous on the entire real line. Next, find
the second derivative of 
Rewrite original function.

First derivative
Differentiate.
Second derivative
Because 
when 
and is differentiable on the entire real line, you
should test 
in the intervals 
and 
The results are shown
in the table and in Figure 5.25.
■
The function given in Example 1 is continuous on the entire real line. If there are
-values at which the function is not continuous, these values should be used, along
with the points at which 
or 
does not exist, to form the test intervals.

Theorem 5.7 is a parallel 
of Theorem 5.5. This means that the 
second derivative determines the concavity
of the graph in the same way that the first 
derivative determines whether the graph 
is increasing or decreasing. Moreover, the
only places that the concavity of the graph
may change is at the values for which 
is zero or is undefined.

NOTE
The definition of point of inflection given above requires that the tangent line exists at
the point of inflection. Some books do not require this. For instance, we do not

to have a point of inflection at the origin, even though the concavity of the graph changes from
concave downward to concave upward.

does not exist. You then use the second derivative to test for a point
of inflection in the same way you use the first derivative to test for relative extrema.
EXAMPLE

Finding Points of Inflection
Determine the points of inflection and discuss the concavity of the graph of 
Solution
Differentiate the function twice.
Write original function.
Find first derivative.
Find second derivative.
Setting 
you can determine that the possible points of inflection occur at
and 
By testing the intervals determined by these -values, you can
conclude that they both yield points of inflection. A summary of this testing is shown
in the table, and the graph of is shown in Figure 5.28.

The converse of Theorem 5.8 is not generally true. That is, it is possible for the
second derivative to be 0 at a point that is 
a point of inflection. For instance, the
graph of 
is shown in Figure 5.29. The second derivative is 0 when 
but the point 
is not a point of inflection because the graph of is concave upward

The Second Derivative Test
In addition to testing for concavity, the second derivative can be used to perform a
simple test for relative maxima and minima. The test is based on the fact that if the
graph of a function 
is concave upward on an open interval containing 
and
must be a relative minimum of 
Similarly, if the graph of a function 
is concave downward on an open interval containing 
and 
must be a
relative maximum of (see Figure 5.30).

Because the Second Derivative Test fails at

and observe that

So,

relative minimum nor a relative maximum (even though the graph has a horizontal
tangent line at this point). The graph of is shown in Figure 5.31.

■Determine infinite limits at infinity.
Limits at Infinity
So far, your primary focus on graphs has been their behavior at certain points or on
finite intervals. This section discusses the “end behavior” of a function on an 
interval. Consider the graph of
as shown in Figure 5.32. Graphically, you can see that the values of 
appear to
approach 3 as 
increases without bound or decreases without bound. You can come
to the same conclusions numerically, as shown in the table.
The table suggests that the value of 
approaches 3 as 
increases without bound
Similarly,
approaches 3 as 
decreases without bound 
These limits at infinity are denoted by 
Limit at negative infinity
and
Limit at positive infinity
To say that a statement is true as increases 
means that for some
(large) real number 
the statement is true for 
in the interval 
The
following definition uses this concept.
The definition of a limit at infinity is shown in Figure 5.33. In this figure, note
that for a given positive number 
there exists a positive number 
such that, for
the graph of will lie between the horizontal lines given by

In each case, attempting to evaluate the limit produces the indeterminate

You can conclude that the limit 
because the numerator increases

Use these guidelines to check the results in Example 3. These limits seem reasonable
when you consider that for large values of 
the highest-power term of the rational
function is the most “influential” in determining the limit. For instance, the limit as 
approaches infinity of the function
is 0 because the denominator overpowers the numerator as 
increases or decreases
without bound, as shown in Figure 5.37.
The function shown in Figure 5.37 is a special case of a type of curve studied by
the Italian mathematician Maria Gaetana Agnesi. The general form of this function is 
Witch of Agnesi
and, through a mistranslation of the Italian word vertéré, the curve has come to be
known as the Witch of Agnesi. Agnesi’s work with this curve first appeared in a
comprehensive text on calculus that was published in 1748.

MARIA GAETANA AGNESI (1718–1799)
Agnesi was one of a handful of women to
receive credit for significant contributions to
mathematics before the twentieth century. 
In her early twenties, she wrote the first text
that included both differential and integral
calculus. By age 30, she was an honorary
member of the faculty at the University of
Bologna.

GUIDELINES FOR FINDING LIMITS AT 
OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
1. If the degree of the numerator is 
the degree of the denominator,
then the limit of the rational function is 0.
2. If the degree of the numerator is 
the degree of the denominator, then
the limit of the rational function is the ratio of the leading coefficients.
3. If the degree of the numerator is 
the degree of the denominator,
then the limit of the rational function does not exist.

approaches the
same horizontal asymptote to the right and to the left. This is always true of rational
functions. Functions that are not rational, however, may approach different horizontal
asymptotes to the right and to the left. This is demonstrated in Example 4.

Infinite Limits at Infinity
Many functions do not approach a finite limit as 
increases (or decreases) without
bound. For instance, no polynomial function has a finite limit at infinity. The
following definition is used to describe the behavior of polynomial and other functions
at infinity.
Similar definitions can be given for the statements 
and
EXAMPLE

a. As increases without bound,
also increases without bound. So, you can write
b. As decreases without bound,
also decreases without bound. So, you can write
The graph of

with the Leading Coefficient Test for polynomial functions as described in Section 2.2.

One way to evaluate each of these limits is to use long division to rewrite

the 
function

A Summary of Curve Sketching
■Analyze and sketch the graph of a function.
Analyzing the Graph of a Function
It would be difficult to overstate the importance of using graphs in mathematics.
Descartes’s introduction of analytic geometry contributed significantly to the rapid
advances in calculus that began during the mid-seventeenth century. In the words of
Lagrange, “As long as algebra and geometry traveled separate paths their advance was
slow and their applications limited. But when these two sciences joined company, they
drew from each other fresh vitality and thenceforth marched on at a rapid pace toward
perfection.”
So far, you have studied several concepts that are useful in analyzing the graph of
a function.
•
intercepts and 
intercepts
(Section P.4)
• Symmetry
(Section P.4)
• Domain and range
(Section 1.1)
• Continuity
(Section 3.4)
• Vertical asymptotes
(Sections 2.6 and 3.5)
• Differentiability
(Section 4.1)
• Relative extrema
(Section 5.1)
• Concavity
(Section 5.4)
• Points of inflection
(Section 5.4)
• Horizontal asymptotes
(Section 5.5)
• Infinite limits at infinity
(Section 5.5)
When you are sketching the graph of a function, either by hand or with a graphing
utility, remember that normally you cannot show the entire graph. The decision as to
which part of the graph you choose to show is often crucial. For instance, which of the
viewing windows in Figure 5.43 better represents the graph of
By seeing both views, it is clear that the second viewing window gives a more
complete representation of the graph. But would a third viewing window reveal other
interesting portions of the graph? To answer this, you need to use calculus to interpret
the first and second derivatives. Here are some guidelines for determining a good
viewing window for the graph of a function.

GUIDELINES FOR ANALYZING THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
1. Determine the domain and range of the function.
2. Determine the intercepts, asymptotes, and symmetry of the graph.
3. Locate the values for which

the results to determine relative extrema and points of inflection.

shown in Example 1. By using calculus, you can be sure that the graph has no relative
extrema or points of inflection other than those shown in Figure 5.44.

Without using the type of analysis outlined in Example 1,
it is easy to obtain an incomplete view of a graph’s basic characteristics. For
instance, Figure 5.45 shows a view of the graph of
From this view, it appears that the graph of 
is about the same as the graph of
shown in Figure 5.44. The graphs of these two functions, however, differ
significantly. Try enlarging the viewing window to see the differences.

Although the graph of the function in Example 2 has no horizontal asymptote, it
does have a slant asymptote. The graph of a rational function (having no common
factors and whose denominator is of degree 1 or greater) has a slant asymptote if the
degree of the numerator exceeds the degree of the denominator by exactly 1. To find
the slant asymptote, use long division to rewrite the rational function as the sum of a
first-degree polynomial and another rational function.
Write original equation.
Rewrite using long division.
In Figure 5.47, note that the graph of approaches the slant asymptote

The fourth-degree polynomial function in Example 5 has one relative minimum
and no relative maxima. In general, a polynomial function of degree 
can have at
most
relative extrema, and at most
points of inflection. Moreover,
polynomial functions of even degree must have at least one relative extremum.
Remember from the Leading Coefficient Test described in Section 2.2 that the
“end behavior” of the graph of a polynomial function is determined by its leading
coefficient and its degree. For instance, because the polynomial in Example 5 has a
positive leading coefficient, the graph rises to the right. Moreover, because the degree
is even, the graph also rises to the left.

Optimization Problems
■Use calculus to solve applied minimum and maximum problems.
Applied Minimum and Maximum Problems
One of the most common applications of calculus involves the determination of
minimum and maximum values. Consider how frequently you hear or read terms such
as greatest profit, least cost, least time, greatest voltage, optimum size, least size,
greatest strength, and greatest distance. Before outlining a general problem-solving
strategy for such problems, let’s look at an example.
EXAMPLE
1
Finding Maximum Volume
A manufacturer wants to design an open box having a square base and a surface area
of 108 square inches, as shown in Figure 5.51. What dimensions will produce a box
with maximum volume?
Solution
Because the box has a square base, its volume is
Primary equation
This equation is called the primary equation because it gives a formula for the
quantity to be optimized. The surface area of the box is
Secondary equation
Because 
is to be maximized, you want to write 
as a function of just one variable.
To do this, you can solve the secondary equation 
for 
in terms of 
to obtain 
Substituting into the primary equation produces
Function of two variables
Substitute for 
Function of one variable
Before finding which value will yield a maximum value of 
you should determine
the feasible domain. That is, what values of make sense in this problem? You know
that 
You also know that 
must be nonnegative and that the area of the base
is at most 108. So, the feasible domain is
Feasible domain
To maximize 
find the critical numbers of the volume function on the interval
Set derivative equal to 0.
Simplify.
Critical numbers
So, the critical numbers are 
You do not need to consider 
because it is
not in the domain. Evaluating 
at the critical number 
and at the endpoints of the
domain produces 
and 
So,
is maximum
when 
and the dimensions of the box are 
inches.

Optimization Problems

In Example 1, you should realize that there are infinitely many open boxes 
having 108 square inches of surface area. To begin solving the problem, you might ask
yourself which basic shape would seem to yield a maximum volume. Should the box
be tall, squat, or nearly cubical?
You might even try calculating a few volumes, as shown in Figure 5.52, to see if
you can get a better feeling for what the optimum dimensions should be. Remember
that you are not ready to begin solving a problem until you have clearly identified
what the problem is.
Which box has the greatest volume?

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING APPLIED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM
PROBLEMS
1. Identify all given quantities and all quantities to be determined. If possible,
make a sketch and label it with any relevant measurements.
2. Write a primary equation for the quantity that is to be maximized or 
minimized. (A review of several useful formulas from geometry is presented
inside the back cover.)
3. Reduce the primary equation to one having a single independent variable.
This may involve the use of secondary equations relating the independent
variables of the primary equation.
4. Determine the feasible domain of the primary equation. That is, determine
the values for which the stated problem makes sense.
5. Determine the desired maximum or minimum value by the calculus 
techniques discussed in Sections 5.1 through 5.4.
NOTE
When performing Step 5, recall
that to determine the maximum or 
minimum value of a continuous function
on a closed interval, you should 
compare the values of at its critical
numbers with the values of at the 
endpoints of the interval.

Finding Minimum Distance
Which points on the graph of
are closest to the point 
Solution
Figure 5.53 shows that there are two points at a minimum distance from the
point 
The distance between the point 
and a point 
on the graph of
is given by 
Primary equation
Using the secondary equation 
you can rewrite the primary equation as
Because is smallest when the expression inside the radical is smallest, you need only
find the critical numbers of 
Note that the domain of is the
entire real line. So, there are no endpoints of the domain to consider. Moreover,
setting 
equal to 0 yields
The First Derivative Test verifies that 
yields a relative maximum, whereas both
and 
yield a minimum distance. So, the closest points are
and 
EXAMPLE

Finding Minimum Area
A rectangular page is to contain 24 square inches of print. The margins at the top and
bottom of the page are to be 
inches, and the margins on the left and right are to be
1 inch (see Figure 5.54). What should the dimensions of the page be so that the least
amount of paper is used?
Solution
Let 
be the area to be minimized.
Primary equation
The printed area inside the margins is given by
Secondary equation
Solving this equation for produces 
Substitution into the primary equation
produces
Function of one variable
Because must be positive, you are interested only in values of 
for 
To find
the critical numbers, differentiate with respect to 
So, the critical numbers are 
You do not have to consider 
because it
is outside the domain. The First Derivative Test confirms that 
is a minimum when
So,
and the dimensions of the page should be

Applications of Differentiation
Newton, Sir Isaac (1643-1727), English mathematician and physicist, who brought the
scientific revolution of the 17th century to its climax and established the principal outlines
of the system of natural science that has since dominated Western thought. In mathematics,
he was the first person to develop the calculus. In optics, he established the heterogeneity
of light and the periodicity of certain phenomena. In mechanics, his three laws of motion
became  the  foundation  of  modern  dynamics,  and  from  them  he  derived  the  law  of
universal gravitation.
Newton was born on January 4, 1643, at W oolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire.
When he was three years old, his widowed mother remarried, leaving him to be reared by
her mother. Eventually, his mother, by then widowed a second time, was persuaded to
send him to grammar school in Grantham; then, in the summer of 1661, he was sent to
Trinity College, University of Cambridge.
After receiving his bachelor's degree in 1665, and after an intermission of nearly two
years caused by the plague, Newton stayed on at Trinity, which elected him to a
fellowship in 1667; he took his master's degree in 1668. Meanwhile, he had largely
ignored the established curriculum of the university to pursue his own interests:
mathematics and natural philosophy. Proceeding entirely on his own, Newton investigated
the latest developments in 17th-century mathematics and the new natural philosophy that
treated  nature  as  a  complicated  machine.  Almost  immediately, he  made  fundamental
discoveries that laid the foundation of his career in science.
The Fluxional Method
Newton's first achievement came in mathematics. He generalized the earlier methods
that were being used to draw tangents to curves (similar to differentiation) and to calculate
areas under curves (similar to integration), recognized that the two procedures were inverse
operations, and—joining them in what he called the fluxional method—developed in the
autumn of 1666 what is now known as the calculus. The calculus was a new and powerful
instrument that carried modern mathematics above the level of Greek geometry.Although
Newton was its inventor, he did not introduce it into European mathematics. Always
morbidly fearful of publication and criticism, he kept his discovery to himself, although
enough was known of his abilities to effect his appointment in 1669 as Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In 1675 the German mathematician
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz arrived independently at virtually the same method, which he
called the differential calculus.  Leibniz proceeded to publish his method, and the world of
mathematics not only learned it from him but also accepted his name for it and his
notation. Newton himself did not publish any detailed exposition of his fluxional method
until 1704.
Optics
Optics was another of Newton's early interests. In trying to explain how phenomena of
colors arise, he arrived at the idea that sunlight is a heterogeneous mixture of different
rays—each of which provokes the sensation of a different color—and that reflections and
refractions cause colors to appear by separating the mixture into its components. He
devised an experimental demonstration of this theory, one of the great early exhibitions of
the power of experimental investigation in science. His measurement of the rings reflected
from  a  thin  film  of  air  confined  between  a  lens  and  a  sheet  of  glass  was  the  first
demonstration of periodicity in optical phenomena. In 1672 Newton sent a brief
exposition of his theory of colors to the Royal Society in London. Its appearance in the
Philosophical  Transactions led  to  a  number  of  criticisms  that  confirmed  his  fear  of
publication, and he subsequently withdrew as much as possible into the solitude of his
Cambridge study. He did not publish his full Opticks until 1704.

Finding Minimum Length
Two posts, one 12 feet high and the other 28 feet high, stand 30 feet apart. They are
to be stayed by two wires, attached to a single stake, running from ground level to the
top of each post. Where should the stake be placed to use the least amount of wire?
Solution
Let 
be the wire length to be minimized. Using Figure 5.55, you can write
Primary equation
In this problem, rather than solving for in terms of (or vice versa), you can solve
for both 
and 
in terms of a third variable 
as shown in Figure 5.55. From the
Pythagorean Theorem, you obtain
which implies that
So,

Differentiating 
with respect to yields
By letting 
you obtain
Because 
is not in the domain and 
and
you can conclude that the wire should be staked at 9 feet from the 12-foot pole.

at an endpoint of an interval, as shown in Example 5.
EXAMPLE

An Endpoint Maximum
Four feet of wire is to be used to form a square and a circle. How much of the wire
should be used for the square and how much should be used for the circle to enclose
the maximum total area?
Solution
The total area (see Figure 5.57) is given by
Primary equation
Because the total length of wire is 4 feet, you obtain
Secondary equation
So,
and by substituting into the primary equation you have
The feasible domain is 
restricted by the square’s perimeter. Because
the only critical number in

So, using

you can conclude that the maximum area occurs when 
That is, all the wire is
used for the circle.

Let’s review the primary equations developed in the first five examples. As
applications go, these five examples are fairly simple, and yet the resulting primary
equations are quite complicated.
You must expect that real-life applications often involve equations that are at least as
complicated as these five. Remember that one of the main goals of this course is to
learn to use calculus to analyze equations that initially seem formidable.

Whenever the Connecticut River reaches a level of 105 feet above
sea level, two Northampton, Massachusetts flood control station
operators begin a round-the-clock river watch. Every 2 hours, they
check the height of the river, using a scale marked off in tenths of a
foot, and record the data in a log book. In the spring of 1996, the
flood watch lasted from April 4, when the river reached 105 feet and
was rising at 0.2 foot per hour, until April 25, when the level 
subsided again to 105 feet. Between those dates, their log shows that
the river rose and fell several times, at one point coming close to the
115-foot mark. If the river had reached 115 feet, the city would have
closed down Mount Tom Road (Route 5, south of Northampton).
The graph below shows the rate of change of the level of the river
during one portion of the flood watch. Use the graph to answer each
question.
(a) On what date was the river rising most rapidly? How do you
know?
(b) On what date was the river falling most rapidly? How do
you know?
(c) There were two dates in a row on which the river rose, then
fell, then rose again during the course of the day. On which
days did this occur, and how do you know?
(d) At 1 minute past midnight, April 14, the river level was
111.0 feet. Estimate its height 24 hours later and 48 hours
later. Explain how you made your estimates.
(e) The river crested at 114.4 feet. On what date do you think
this occurred?

Tangent Line Approximations

approximated by a straight line.

Error Propagation
Physicists and engineers tend to make liberal use of the approximation of 
by 
One way this occurs in practice is in the estimation of errors propagated by physical
measuring devices. For example, if you let 
represent the measured value of a vari-
able and let 
represent the exact value, then 
is the error in measurement.
Finally, if the measured value is used to compute another value 
the difference
between 
and 
is the propagated error.

Estimation of Error
The measured radius of a ball bearing is 0.7 inch, as shown in Figure 5.61. If the 
measurement is correct to within 0.01 inch, estimate the propagated error in the 
volume 
of the ball bearing.
Solution
The formula for the volume of a sphere is
where is the radius of the sphere. So, you can write
Measured radius

Possible error
To approximate the propagated error in the volume, differentiate 
to obtain
and write
Approximate 
by 
Substitute for and 
So, the volume has a propagated error of about 0.06 cubic inch.

The notation in Example 4 is called the Leibniz notation for derivatives and
differentials, named after the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The
beauty of this notation is that it provides an easy way to remember several important
calculus formulas by making it seem as though the formulas were derived from
algebraic manipulations of differentials. For instance, in Leibniz notation, the Chain
Rule
would appear to be true because the 
’s divide out. Even though this reasoning is
incorrect, the notation does help one remember the Chain Rule.

The area of a parabolic region can be approximated as the sum of the areas of rectangles. As you increase the number
of rectangles, the approximation tends to become more and more accurate. In Section 6.2, you will learn how the limit
process can be used to find areas of a wide variety of regions.

In this chapter, you will study an important
process of calculus that is closely related
to differentiation–integration. You will
learn new methods and rules for solving
definite and indefinite integrals, including
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Then you will apply these rules to find
such things as the position function for an
object and the average value of a function.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.

basic integration rules. (6.1)

This photo of a jet breaking the sound barrier was taken by Ensign John Gay. At

Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integration

Using Theorem 6.1, you can represent the entire family of antiderivatives of a
function by adding a constant to a known antiderivative. For example, knowing that
you can represent the family of all antiderivatives of 
by
Family of all antiderivatives of 
where 
is a constant. The constant 
is called the constant of integration. The
family of functions represented by 
is the general antiderivative of

Notation for Antiderivatives
When solving a differential equation of the form
it is convenient to write it in the equivalent differential form
The operation of finding all solutions of this equation is called antidifferentiation (or
indefinite integration) and is denoted by an integral sign 
The general solution is
denoted by
The expression 
is read as the antiderivative of with respect to 
So, the
differential 
serves to identify 
as the variable of integration. The term indefinite

Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integration

So far in this section you have been using 
as the variable of integration. In
applications, it is often convenient to use a different variable. For instance, in the
following example involving time, the variable of integration is 
EXAMPLE

Solving a Vertical Motion Problem
A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second from an initial
height of 80 feet.
a. Find the position function giving the height as a function of the time 
b. When does the ball hit the ground?
Solution
a. Let 
represent the initial time. The two given initial conditions can be written
as follows.
Initial height is 80 feet.
Initial velocity is 64 feet per second.
Using 
feet per second per second as the acceleration due to gravity, you can
write
Using the initial velocity, you obtain 
which implies
that 
Next, by integrating 
you obtain
Using the initial height, you obtain
which implies that 
So, the position function is
See Figure 6.4.
b. Using the position function found in part (a), you can find the time at which the
ball hits the ground by solving the equation 
Because 
must be positive, you can conclude that the ball hits the ground
5 seconds after it was thrown.
■
Example 7 shows how to use calculus to analyze vertical motion problems in
which the acceleration is determined by a gravitational force. You can use a similar
strategy to analyze other linear motion problems (vertical or horizontal) in which the
acceleration (or deceleration) is the result of some other force, as you will see in
Exercises 69–77.

■Understand the concept of area.

Sigma Notation
In the preceding section, you studied antidifferentiation. In this section, you will look
further into a problem introduced in Section 3.1—that of finding the area of a region
in the plane. At first glance, these two ideas may seem unrelated, but you will discover
in Section 6.4 that they are closely related by an extremely important theorem called
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
This section begins by introducing a concise notation for sums. This notation is
called sigma notation because it uses the uppercase Greek letter sigma, written as

THE SUM OF THE FIRST 100 INTEGERS
A teacher of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
asked him to add all the integers from 1 to

answer after only a few moments, the teacher
could only look at him in astounded silence.
This is what Gauss did:

Area
In Euclidean geometry, the simplest type of plane region is a rectangle. Although 
people often say that the formula for the area of a rectangle is 
it is actually
more proper to say that this is the definition of the area of a rectangle.
From this definition, you can develop formulas for the areas of many other plane
regions. For example, to determine the area of a triangle, you can form a rectangle
whose area is twice that of the triangle, as shown in Figure 6.5. Once you know
how to find the area of a triangle, you can determine the area of any polygon by
subdividing the polygon into triangular regions, as shown in Figure 6.6.
Parallelogram
Hexagon
Polygon
Figure 6.6
Finding the areas of regions other than polygons is more difficult. The ancient
Greeks were able to determine formulas for the areas of some general regions
(principally those bounded by conics) by the exhaustion method. The clearest
description of this method was given by Archimedes. Essentially, the method is a
limiting process in which the area is squeezed between two polygons—one inscribed
in the region and one circumscribed about the region.
For instance, in Figure 6.7 the area of a circular region is approximated by an 
-sided inscribed polygon and an -sided circumscribed polygon. For each value of 
the area of the inscribed polygon is less than the area of the circle, and the area of the
circumscribed polygon is greater than the area of the circle. Moreover, as increases,
the areas of both polygons become better and better approximations of the area of 
the circle.
The exhaustion method for finding the area of a circular region
Figure 6.7
A process that is similar to that used by Archimedes to determine the area of a
plane region is used in the remaining examples in this section.

The Area of a Plane Region
Recall from Section 3.1 that the origins of calculus are connected to two classic
problems: the tangent line problem and the area problem. Example 3 begins the
investigation of the area problem.
EXAMPLE
3
Approximating the Area of a Plane Region
Use the five rectangles in Figure 6.8(a) and (b) to find two approximations of the area
of the region lying between the graph of
and the -axis between 
and 
Solution
a. The right endpoints of the five intervals are 
where 
The width
of each rectangle is 
and the height of each rectangle can be obtained by evaluating
at the right endpoint of each interval.
Evaluate at the right endpoints of these intervals.
The sum of the areas of the five rectangles is
Height Width
Because each of the five rectangles lies inside the parabolic region, you can 
conclude that the area of the parabolic region is greater than 6.48.
b. The left endpoints of the five intervals are 
where 
The
width of each rectangle is 
and the height of each rectangle can be obtained by
evaluating at the left endpoint of each interval. So, the sum is
Height
Width
Because the parabolic region lies within the union of the five rectangular regions,
you can conclude that the area of the parabolic region is less than 8.08.
By combining the results in parts (a) and (b), you can conclude that
■
6.48 < Area of region < 8.08.

Upper and Lower Sums
The procedure used in Example 3 can be generalized as follows. Consider a plane
region bounded above by the graph of a nonnegative, continuous function 
as
shown in Figure 6.9. The region is bounded below by the -axis, and the left and right
boundaries of the region are the vertical lines 
and 
To approximate the area of the region, begin by subdividing the interval 
into
subintervals, each of width 
as shown in Figure 6.10. The
endpoints of the intervals are as follows.
Because is continuous, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a
minimum and a maximum value of 
in each subinterval.
Minimum value of 
in th subinterval
Maximum value of 
in th subinterval
Next, define an inscribed rectangle lying inside the th subregion and a
circumscribed rectangle extending outside the th subregion. The height of the th
inscribed rectangle is 
and the height of the th circumscribed rectangle is 
For each
the area of the inscribed rectangle is less than or equal to the area of the
circumscribed rectangle.
The sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangles is called a lower sum, and the sum
of the areas of the circumscribed rectangles is called an upper sum.
Area of inscribed rectangles
Area of circumscribed rectangles
From Figure 6.11, you can see that the lower sum 
is less than or equal to the upper
sum 
Moreover, the actual area of the region lies between these two sums.

Example 4 illustrates some important things about lower and upper sums. First,
notice that for any value of 
the lower sum is less than (or equal to) the upper sum.
Second, the difference between these two sums lessens as 
increases. In fact, if you
take the limits as 
both the upper sum and the lower sum approach 
Lower sum limit
Upper sum limit
The next theorem shows that the equivalence of the limits (as 
) of the upper
and lower sums is not mere coincidence. It is true for all functions that are continuous
and nonnegative on the closed interval 
The proof of this theorem is best left to
a course in advanced calculus.
Because the same limit is attained for both the minimum value 
and the
maximum value 
it follows from the Squeeze Theorem (Theorem 3.7) that the
choice of in the th subinterval does not affect the limit. This means that you are free
to choose an arbitrary -value in the th subinterval, as in the following definition of
the area of a region in the plane.

Riemann Sums
In the definition of area given in Section 6.2, the partitions have subintervals of equal
width. This was done only for computational convenience. The following example
shows that it is not necessary to have subintervals of equal width.
EXAMPLE
1
A Partition with Subintervals of Unequal Widths
Consider the region bounded by the graph of 
and the axis for 
as shown in Figure 6.17. Evaluate the limit
where 
is the right endpoint of the partition given by 
and 
is the width
of the th interval.
Solution
The width of the th interval is given by
So, the limit is
■
From Example 7 in Section 6.2, you know that the region shown in Figure 6.18
has an area of 
Because the square bounded by 
and 
has an
area of 1, you can conclude that the area of the region shown in Figure 6.17 has an
area of 
This agrees with the limit found in Example 1, even though that example
used a partition having subintervals of unequal widths. The reason this particular 
partition gave the proper area is that as increases, the width of the largest subinterval
approaches zero. This is a key feature of the development of definite integrals.

Riemann Sums and Definite Integrals
421
In the preceding section, the limit of a sum was used to define the area of a region
in the plane. Finding area by this means is only one of 
applications involving
the limit of a sum. A similar approach can be used to determine quantities as diverse
as arc lengths, average values, centroids, volumes, work, and surface areas. The
following definition is named after Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann. Although the
definite integral had been defined and used long before the time of Riemann, he
generalized the concept to cover a broader category of functions.
In the following definition of a Riemann sum, note that the function 
has no
restrictions other than being defined on the interval 
(In the preceding section,
the function was assumed to be continuous and nonnegative because we were dealing
with the area under a curve.)
The width of the largest subinterval of a partition 
is the norm of the partition
and is denoted by 
If every subinterval is of equal width, the partition is regular
and the norm is denoted by
For a general partition, the norm is related to the number of subintervals of 
in
the following way.
General partition
So, the number of subintervals in a partition approaches infinity as the norm of the
partition approaches 0. That is,
implies that 
The converse of this statement is not true. For example, let 
be the partition of
the interval 
given by
As shown in Figure 6.19, for any positive value of 
the norm of the partition 
is 
So, letting approach infinity does not force 
to approach 0. In a regular partition,
however, the statements 
and 
are equivalent.

It is not a coincidence that the notation for definite integrals is similar to that used
for indefinite integrals. You will see why in the next section when the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus is introduced. For now it is important to see that definite
integrals and indefinite integrals are different concepts. A definite integral is a
number, whereas an indefinite integral is a family of functions.
Though Riemann sums were defined for functions with very few restrictions, a
sufficient condition for a function to be integrable on 
is that it is continuous on
A proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this text.

DEFINITION OF DEFINITE INTEGRAL
If is defined on the closed interval 
and the limit of Riemann sums over
partitions 
exists (as described above), then is said to be integrable on 
and the
limit is denoted by
The limit is called the definite integral of from 
to 
The number 
is the
lower limit of integration, and the number is the upper limit of integration.

The Converse of Theorem 6.4
Is the converse of Theorem 6.4 true? That is,
if a function is integrable, does it have to be continuous? Explain your reasoning
and give examples.
Describe the relationships among continuity, differentiability, and
integrability. Which is the strongest condition? Which is the weakest? Which
conditions imply other conditions?

Evaluating a Definite Integral as a Limit
Evaluate the definite integral 
Solution
The function 
is integrable on the interval 
because it is
continuous on 
Moreover, the definition of integrability implies that any par-
tition whose norm approaches 0 can be used to determine the limit. For computational
convenience, define 
by subdividing 
into subintervals of equal width
Choosing 
as the right endpoint of each subinterval produces
So, the definite integral is given by
■
Because the definite integral in Example 2 is negative, it does not represent the
area of the region shown in Figure 6.20. Definite integrals can be positive, negative,
or zero. For a definite integral to be interpreted as an area (as defined in Section 6.2),
the function must be continuous and nonnegative on 
as stated in the following
theorem. The proof of this theorem is straightforward—you simply use the definition
of area given in Section 6.2, because it is a Riemann sum.

A straightforward technique for evaluating a definite integral such as this will be
discussed in Section 6.4. For now, however, you can evaluate a definite integral in two
ways—you can use the limit definition 
you can check to see whether the definite
integral represents the area of a common geometric region such as a rectangle, triangle,
or semicircle.

Geometrically, the following two definitions seem reasonable. For instance,
it makes sense to define the area of a region of zero width and finite height to be 0.

a. Because the integrand is defined at 
and the upper and lower limits of 
integration are equal, you can write
b. The integral 
is the same as that given in Example 3(b) except that the
upper and lower limits are interchanged. Because the integral in Example 3(b) has
a value of 
you can write
■
In Figure 6.24, the larger region can be divided at 
into two subregions
whose intersection is a line segment. Because the line segment has zero area, it
follows that the area of the larger region is equal to the sum of the areas of the two
smaller regions.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
You have now been introduced to the two major branches of calculus: differential
calculus (introduced with the tangent line problem) and integral calculus (introduced
with the area problem). At this point, these two problems might seem unrelated—but
there is a very close connection. The connection was discovered independently by
Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz and is stated in a theorem that is appropriately
called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Informally, the theorem states that differentiation and (definite) integration are
inverse operations, in the same sense that division and multiplication are inverse
operations. To see how Newton and Leibniz might have anticipated this relationship,
consider the approximations shown in Figure 6.26. The slope of the tangent line was
defined using the 
(the slope of the secant line). Similarly, the area of
a region under a curve was defined using the 
(the area of a rectangle).
So, at least in the primitive approximation stage, the operations of differentiation and
definite integration appear to have an inverse relationship in the same sense that
division and multiplication are inverse operations. The Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus states that the limit processes (used to define the derivative and definite
integral) preserve this inverse relationship.
(a) Differentiation
(b) Definite integration
Differentiation and definite integration have an “inverse”relationship.

Integration and Antidifferentiation
Throughout this chapter, you have
been using the integral sign to 
denote an antiderivative (a family 
of functions) and a definite integral
(a number).
Antidifferentiation:
Definite integration:
The use of this same symbol for
both operations makes it appear
that they are related. In the early
work with calculus, however, it
was not known that the two 
operations were related. Do you
think the symbol was first
applied to antidifferentiation or to
definite integration? Explain your
reasoning. (Hint: The symbol was
first used by Leibniz and was
derived from the letter )

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
In Section 6.2, you saw that the area of a region under a curve is greater than the area
of an inscribed rectangle and less than the area of a circumscribed rectangle. The
Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that somewhere “between” the inscribed and
circumscribed rectangles there is a rectangle whose area is precisely equal to the area
of the region under the curve, as shown in Figure 6.29.

Average Value of a Function
The value of 
given in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is called the average
value of on the interval 
To see why the average value of 
is defined in this way, suppose that you 
partition 
into subintervals of equal width 
If 
is any point in
the th subinterval, the arithmetic average (or mean) of the function values at the ’s
is given by
Average of 
By multiplying and dividing by 
you can write the average as
Finally, taking the limit as 
produces the average value of 
on the interval
as given in the definition above.
This development of the average value of a function on an interval is only one
of many practical uses of definite integrals to represent summation processes. In a
later course, you will study other applications, such as volume, arc length, centers of
mass, and work.

The Speed of Sound

speed of sound 
(in meters per second) can be modeled by
where 
is the altitude in kilometers (see Figure 6.33). What is the average speed of
sound over the interval 
Solution
Begin by integrating 
over the interval 
To do this, you can break
the integral into five parts.
By adding the values of the five integrals, you have
So, the average speed of sound from an altitude of 0 kilometers to an altitude of
80 kilometers is

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The first person to fly at a speed greater
than the speed of sound was Charles
Yeager. On October 14, 1947, Yeager was
clocked at 295.9 meters per second at an
altitude of 12.2 kilometers. If Yeager had
been flying at an altitude below 11.275
kilometers, this speed would not have
“broken the sound barrier.” The photo
above shows an F-14Tomcat, a supersonic,
twin-engine strike fighter. Currently, 
the Tomcat can reach heights of 15.24
kilometers and speeds up to 2 mach
(707.78 meters per second).

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Earlier you saw that the definite integral of on the interval 
was defined using
the constant 
as the upper limit of integration and 
as the variable of integration.
However, a slightly different situation may arise in which the variable is used in the
upper limit of integration. To avoid the confusion of using 
in two different ways,
is temporarily used as the variable of integration. (Remember that the definite integral
is 
a function of its variable of integration.)

You could evaluate five different definite integrals, one for each of the
given upper limits. However, it is much simpler to fix

CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS
By the end of the eighteenth century,
mathematicians and scientists had concluded
that most real-world phenomena could be
represented by mathematical models taken
from a collection of functions called
elementary functions. Elementary functions
fall into three categories.
1. Algebraic functions (polynomial, radical,
rational)
2. Exponential and logarithmic functions
3. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine,
tangent, and so on)
Exponential and logarithmic functions are
introduced in Chapter 7 and trigonometric
and inverse trigonometric functions are
introduced in Chapter 9.

Net Change Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 6.9) states that if is continuous on
the closed interval 
and 
is an antiderivative of on 
then
But because 
this statement can be rewritten as
where the quantity 
represents the net change of F on the interval 
EXAMPLE
9
Using the Net Change Theorem
A chemical flows into a storage tank at a rate of 
liters per minute, where
Find the amount of the chemical that flows into the tank during the first
20 minutes.
Solution
Let 
be the amount of the chemical in the tank at time 
Then 
represents the rate at which the chemical flows into the tank at time During the first
20 minutes, the amount that flows into the tank is
So, the amount that flows into the tank during the first 20 minutes is 4200 liters.
■
Another way to illustrate the Net Change Theorem is to examine the velocity of
a particle moving along a straight line where 
is the position at time 
Then its
velocity is 
and 
This definite integral represents the net change in position, or displacement, of the
particle.

When 
the 
particle moves to the left, and when 
the particle moves to the right. To 
calculate the total distance traveled, integrate the absolute value of velocity 
So,
the displacement of a particle and the total distance traveled by a particle over

Solution
a. By definition, you know that the displacement is
So, the particle moves

■Use a change of variables to evaluate a definite integral.
■Evaluate a definite integral involving an even or odd function.
Pattern Recognition
In this section you will study techniques for integrating composite functions. The
discussion is split into two parts—pattern recognition and change of variables. Both
techniques involve a 
-substitution. With pattern recognition you perform the
substitution mentally, and with change of variables you write the substitution steps.
The role of substitution in integration is comparable to the role of the Chain Rule
in differentiation. Recall that for differentiable functions given by 
and
the Chain Rule states that
From the definition of an antiderivative, it follows that
These results are summarized in the following theorem.
Example 1 shows how to apply Theorem 6.13 directly, by recognizing the presence
of

Note that the composite function in the integrand has an outside
function
and an inside function
Moreover, the derivative 
is present as a factor
of the integrand.

TECHNOLOGY
There are several techniques
for applying substitution, each differing
slightly from the others. However, you
should remember that the goal is the same
with every technique—you are trying to
find an antiderivative of the integrand.
STUDY TIP

The integrands in Example 1 fit the 
pattern exactly—you only had to
recognize the pattern. You can extend this technique considerably with the Constant
Multiple Rule
Many integrands contain the essential part (the variable part) of 
but are missing
a constant multiple. In such cases, you can multiply and divide by the necessary
constant multiple, as shown in Example 2.

move the entire integrand out and simplify the whole process. But the result would be incorrect.

Change of Variables
With a formal change of variables, you completely rewrite the integral in terms of 
and 
(or any other convenient variable). Although this procedure can involve more
written steps than the pattern recognition illustrated in Examples 1 and 2, it is useful
for complicated integrands. The change of variables technique uses the Leibniz 
notation for the differential. That is, if

The General Power Rule for Integration
One of the most common 
substitutions involves quantities in the integrand that are
raised to a power. Because of the importance of this type of substitution, it is given a
special name—the General Power Rule for Integration. A proof of this rule follows
directly from the (simple) Power Rule for Integration, together with Theorem 6.13.

Some integrals whose integrands involve quantities raised to powers cannot be
found by the General Power Rule. Consider the two integrals
and
The substitution 
works in the first integral but not in the second. In the
second, the substitution fails because the integrand lacks the factor 
needed for 
Fortunately, for this particular integral, you can expand the integrand as
and use the (simple) Power Rule to integrate each term.

Change of Variables for Definite Integrals
When using 
substitution with a definite integral, it is often convenient to determine
the limits of integration for the variable rather than to convert the antiderivative back
to the variable and evaluate at the original limits. This change of variables is stated
explicitly in the next theorem. The proof follows from Theorem 6.13 combined with
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

regions shown in Figures 6.38 and 6.39 have the 
area.
When evaluating definite integrals by substitution, it is possible for the upper
limit of integration of the 
variable form to be smaller than the lower limit. If this
happens, don’t rearrange the limits. Simply evaluate as usual. For example, after
substituting

Integration of Even and Odd Functions
Even with a change of variables, integration can be difficult. Occasionally, you can
simplify the evaluation of a definite integral over an interval that is symmetric about
the 
axis or about the origin by recognizing the integrand to be an even or odd 
function (see Figure 6.40).

Numerical Integration
■Approximate a definite integral using the Trapezoidal Rule.
■Approximate a definite integral using Simpson’s Rule.
■Analyze the approximate errors in the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule.
The Trapezoidal Rule
Some elementary functions simply do not have antiderivatives that are elementary
functions. For example, there is no elementary function that has any of the following
functions as its derivative.
If you need to evaluate a definite integral involving a function whose antiderivative
cannot be found, then while the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is still true, it 
cannot be easily applied. In this case, it is easier to resort to an approximation 
technique. Two such techniques are described in this section.
One way to approximate a definite integral is to use 
trapezoids, as shown in
Figure 6.42. In the development of this method, assume that 
is continuous and 
positive on the interval 
So, the definite integral
represents the area of the region bounded by the graph of and the axis, from 
to 
First, partition the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of width
such that
Then form a trapezoid for each subinterval (see Figure 6.43). The area of the th
trapezoid is
Area of th trapezoid 
This implies that the sum of the areas of the trapezoids is
Letting

Most graphing utilities and computer algebra systems have built-in
programs that can be used to approximate the value of a definite integral. Try using
such a program to approximate the integral in Example 1. 
When you use such a program, you need to be aware of its limitations. Often,
you are given no indication of the degree of accuracy of the approximation. Other
times, you may be given an approximation that is completely wrong. For instance,
try using a built-in numerical integration program to evaluate

Trapezoidal approximations
Figure 6.44

It is interesting to compare the Trapezoidal Rule with the Midpoint Rule given in
Section 6.2 (Exercises 67–70). For the Trapezoidal Rule, you average the function
values at the endpoints of the subintervals, but for the Midpoint Rule you take the
function values of the subinterval midpoints.
Midpoint Rule
Trapezoidal Rule
Simpson’s Rule
One way to view the trapezoidal approximation of a definite integral is to say that on
each subinterval you approximate by a first-degree polynomial. In Simpson’s Rule,
named after the English mathematician Thomas Simpson (1710–1761), you take this
procedure one step further and approximate by second-degree polynomials.
Before presenting Simpson’s Rule, we list a theorem for evaluating integrals of
polynomials of degree 2 (or less).

NOTE
There are two important points that should be made concerning the Trapezoidal Rule
(or the Midpoint Rule). First, the approximation tends to become more accurate as increases.
For instance, in Example 1, if 
the Trapezoidal Rule yields an approximation of 1.2189.
Second, although you could have used the Fundamental Theorem to evaluate the integral in
Example 1, this theorem cannot be used to evaluate an integral as simple as 
because 
has no elementary antiderivative. Yet, the Trapezoidal Rule can be applied
easily to estimate this integral.

To develop Simpson’s Rule for approximating a definite integral, you again
partition the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of width 
This
time, however,
is required to be even, and the subintervals are grouped in pairs such
that
On each (double) subinterval 
, you can approximate by a polynomial 
of
degree less than or equal to 2. (See Exercise 48.) For example, on the subinterval
choose the polynomial of least degree passing through the points
as shown in Figure 6.45. Now, using 
as an approxima-
tion of on this subinterval, you have, by Theorem 6.18,
Repeating this procedure on the entire interval 
produces the following theorem.
In Example 1, the Trapezoidal Rule was used to estimate 
In the

Error Analysis
If you must use an approximation technique, it is important to know how accurate you
can expect the approximation to be. The following theorem, which is listed without
proof, gives the formulas for estimating the errors involved in the use of Simpson’s
Rule and the Trapezoidal Rule. In general, when using an approximation, you can
think of the error 
as the difference between 
and the approximation.
Theorem 6.20 states that the errors generated by the Trapezoidal Rule and
Simpson’s Rule have upper bounds dependent on the extreme values of 
and
in the interval 
Furthermore, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by
increasing
provided that 
and 
are continuous and therefore bounded in 
EXAMPLE

The maximum value of 
on the interval 
So, by Theorem
6.20, you can write
To obtain an error 
that is less than 0.01, you must choose 
such that
So, you can choose 
(because must be greater than or equal to 2.89) and apply
the Trapezoidal Rule, as shown in Figure 6.46, to obtain
So, by adding and subtracting the error from this estimate, you know that

uniform speed whose value is the mean of the highest
speed of the accelerating body and the speed just before
acceleration began.

In this chapter you will study two types 
of nonalgebraic functions– exponential
functions and logarithmic functions.
Exponential and logarithmic functions are
widely used in describing economic and
physical phenomena such as compound
interest, population growth, memory 
retention, and decay of radioactive material. 
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How to recognize, evaluate, and graph
exponential functions. (7.1)
■How to recognize, evaluate, and graph
logarithmic functions. (7.2)
■How to use properties of logarithms to
evaluate, rewrite, expand, or condense
logarithmic expressions. (7.3)
■How to solve exponential and logarithmic
equations. (7.4)
■How to use exponential growth models,
exponential decay models, Gaussian
models, logistic growth models, and 
logarithmic models to solve real-life
problems. (7.5)
Given data about four-legged animals, how can you find a logarithmic function 
that can be used to relate an animal’s weight and its lowest galloping speed?

Exponential Functions
So far, this text has dealt mainly with algebraic functions, which include polynomial
functions and rational functions. In this chapter, you will study two types of 
nonalgebraic functions—exponential functions and logarithmic functions. These 
functions are examples of transcendental functions.
The base 
is excluded because it yields 
This is a constant function,
not an exponential function.
You have evaluated 
for integer and rational values of 
For example, you know
that 
and 
However, to evaluate 
for any real number 
you need
to interpret forms with irrational exponents. For the purposes of this text, it is 
sufficient to think of

Applications
One of the most familiar examples of exponential growth is that of an investment
earning 
Using exponential functions, you can
develop a formula for the balance in an account that pays compound interest, and
show how it leads to continuous compounding.
Suppose a principal 
is invested at an annual interest rate 
compounded once a
year. If the interest is added to the principal at the end of the year, the new balance 
is
This pattern of multiplying the previous principal by 
is then repeated each
successive year, as shown below.

To accommodate more frequent (quarterly, monthly, or daily) compounding of
interest, let be the number of compoundings per year and let be the number of years.
Then the rate per compounding is 
and the account balance after years is
Amount (balance) with compoundings per year
If you let the number of compoundings increase without bound, the process approaches
what is called continuous compounding. In the formula for compoundings per year,
let

NOTE
In Example 5, note that 
continuous compounding yields more
than quarterly, monthly, or daily 
compounding. This is typical of the two
types of compounding. That is, for a
given principal, interest rate, and time,
continuous compounding will always
yield a larger balance than compounding
times a year.

Logarithmic Functions and Their Graphs
■Recognize and evaluate logarithmic functions with base a.
■Graph logarithmic functions.
■Recognize, evaluate, and graph natural logarithmic functions.
■Use logarithmic functions to model and solve real-life problems.
Logarithmic Functions
In Section 1.5, you studied the concept of an inverse function. There, you learned that
if a function is one-to-one—that is, if the function has the property that no horizontal
line intersects the graph of the function more than once—the function must have an
inverse function. By looking back at the graphs of the exponential functions introduced
in Section 7.1, you will see that every function of the form 
passes the
Horizontal Line Test and therefore must have an inverse function. This inverse function
is called the logarithmic function with base a.
The equations
and
are equivalent. The first equation is in logarithmic form and the second is in
exponential form. For example, the logarithmic equation 
can be rewritten 
in exponential form as 
The exponential equation 
can be rewritten in
logarithmic form as 
When evaluating logarithms, remember that 
logarithm is an exponent. This
means that 
is the exponent to which 
must be raised to obtain 
For instance,
because 2 must be raised to the third power to get 8.

STUDY TIP

The Natural Logarithmic Function
By looking back at the graph of the natural exponential function introduced in Section
7.1, you will see that 
is one-to-one and so has an inverse function. This
inverse function is called the natural logarithmic function and is denoted by the
special symbol ln x, read as “the natural log of x” or “el en of x.” Note that the 
natural logarithm is written without a base. The base is understood to be 
The definition above implies that the natural logarithmic function and the natural
exponential function are inverse functions of each other. So, every logarithmic
equation can be written in an equivalent exponential form and every exponential
equation can be written in logarithmic form. That is,
and 
are
equivalent equations.
Because the functions given by 
and 
are inverse functions of
each other, their graphs are reflections of each other in the line 
This reflective
property is illustrated in Figure 7.13.
The four properties of logarithms listed on page 482 are also valid for natural 
logarithms.

Using Properties of Logarithms
■Use the change-of-base formula to rewrite and evaluate logarithmic expressions.
■Use properties of logarithms to evaluate or rewrite logarithmic expressions.
■Use properties of logarithms to expand or condense logarithmic expressions.
■Use logarithmic functions to model and solve real-life problems.
Change of Base
Most calculators have only two types of log keys, one for common logarithms 
(base 10) and one for natural logarithms (base ). Although common logarithms and
natural logarithms are the most frequently used, you may occasionally need to 
evaluate logarithms with other bases. To do this, you can use the following change-
of-base formula.
One way to look at the change-of-base formula is that logarithms with base 
are simply constant multiples of logarithms with base 
The constant multiplier is

Properties of Logarithms
You know from the preceding section that the logarithmic function with base is the
inverse function of the exponential function with base 
So, it makes sense that the
properties of exponents should have corresponding properties involving logarithms.
For instance, the exponential property 
has the corresponding logarithmic 
property 
A proof of the first property listed above is given in Appendix A.

JOHN NAPIER
John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, 
developed logarithms as a way to simplify
some of the tedious calculations of his day.
Beginning in 1594, Napier worked about 
20 years on the invention of logarithms.
Napier was only partially successful in his
quest to simplify tedious calculations.
Nonetheless, the development of logarithms
was a step forward and received immediate
recognition.

Rewriting Logarithmic Expressions
The properties of logarithms are useful for rewriting logarithmic expressions in forms
that simplify the operations of algebra. This is true because these properties convert
complicated products, quotients, and exponential forms into simpler sums, differences,
and products, respectively.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
Application
One method of determining how the - and -values for a set of nonlinear data are
related is to take the natural logarithm of each of the - and -values. If these new
points are graphed and fall on a line, then you can determine that the - and -values
are related by the equation
where 
is the slope of the line.

Finding a Mathematical Model
The table shows the mean distance from the sun and the period (the time it takes
a planet to orbit the sun) for each of the six planets that are closest to the sun. In the
table, the mean distance is given in terms of astronomical units (where Earth’s mean
distance is defined as 1.0), and the period is given in years. Find an equation that
relates and 
Solution
The points in the table above are plotted in Figure 7.16. From this figure it
is not clear how to find an equation that relates 
and 
To solve this problem, take
the natural logarithm of each of the - and -values in the table. For instance,
and
Continuing this produces the following results.
Now, by plotting the points in the second table, you can see that all six of the points
appear to lie in a line (see Figure 7.17). Using any two points, the slope of this line is
found to be 
You can therefore conclude that 
The graph of this equation is shown in Figure 7.17. Using properties of logarithms,

with two different types of motion: trotting and galloping.
An animal that is trotting has at least one foot on the
ground at all times, whereas an animal that is galloping
has all four feet off the ground at some point in its stride.
The number of strides per minute at which an animal
breaks from a trot to a gallop depends on the weight of the
animal. Use the table to find a logarithmic equation that
relates an animal’s weight

Introduction
So far in this chapter, you have studied the definitions, graphs, and properties of 
exponential and logarithmic functions. In this section, you will study procedures for
solving equations involving these exponential and logarithmic functions.
There are two basic strategies for solving exponential or logarithmic equations.
The first is based on the One-to-One Properties and the second is based on the Inverse
Properties. For

STRATEGIES FOR SOLVING EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS
1. Rewrite the original equation in a form that allows the use of the 
One-to-One Properties of exponential or logarithmic functions.
2. Rewrite an exponential equation in logarithmic form and apply the Inverse
Property of logarithmic functions.
3. Rewrite a logarithmic equation in exponential form and apply the Inverse
Property of exponential functions.

Another way to solve
Example 2(b) is by taking the natural log
of each side and then applying the Power
Property, as follows.
As you can see, you obtain the same
result as in Example 2(b).

Automobiles are designed with crumple
zones that help protect their occupants in crashes. The
crumple zones allow the occupants to move short 
distances when the automobiles come to abrupt stops.
The greater the distance moved, the fewer g’s the crash
victims experience. (One g is equal to the acceleration
due to gravity. For very short periods of time, humans
have withstood as much as 40 g’s.) In crash tests with
vehicles moving at 90 kilometers per hour, analysts
measured the numbers of g’s experienced during 
deceleration by crash dummies that were permitted to
move 
meters during impact. The data are shown in 
the table. A model for the data is given by
where is the number of g’s.

g’s experienced during impact to fewer than 23?

Some graphing utilities have an exponential regression feature 
that can be used to find exponential models that represent data. If you have such 
a graphing utility, try using it to find an exponential model for the data given in
Example 1. How does your model compare with the model given in Example 1?
TECHNOLOGY

In Example 1, you were given the exponential growth model. But suppose this
model were not given. How could you find such a model? One technique for doing
this is demonstrated in Example 2.

Modeling Population Growth
In a research experiment, a population of fruit flies is increasing according to the law
of exponential growth. After 2 days there are 100 flies, and after 4 days there are 
300 flies. How many flies will there be after 5 days?
Solution
Let be the number of flies at time From the given information, you know
that

In living organic material, the ratio of the number of radioactive carbon isotopes 
(carbon 14) to the number of nonradioactive carbon isotopes (carbon 12) is about 
1 to 
When organic material dies, its carbon 12 content remains fixed, whereas its
radioactive carbon 14 begins to decay with a half-life of about 5700 years. To estimate
the age of dead organic material, scientists use the following formula, which denotes
the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 present at any time (in years).

Gaussian Models
As mentioned at the beginning of this section, Gaussian models are of the form 
This type of model is commonly used in probability and statistics to represent 
populations that are normally distributed. For standard normal distributions, the
model takes the form
where 
is the standard deviation (
is the lowercase Greek letter sigma). The
graph of a Gaussian model is called a bell-shaped curve. Try to sketch the standard
normal distribution curve with a graphing utility. Can you see why it is called a 
bell-shaped curve?
The average value for a population can be found from the bell-shaped curve by
observing where the maximum 
-value of the function occurs. The 
-value
corresponding to the maximum -value of the function represents the average value of
the independent variable—in this case,

roughly followed the normal distribution given by
where is the SAT score for mathematics. Sketch the graph of this function. From the
graph, estimate the average SAT score.
(Source: College Board)
Solution
The graph of the function is shown in Figure 7.28. On this bell-shaped
curve, the maximum value of the curve represents the average score. From the graph,
you can estimate that the average mathematics score for college-bound seniors in 
2008 was 515.

Logistic Growth Models
Some populations initially have rapid growth, followed by a declining rate of growth,
as indicated by the graph in Figure 7.29. One model for describing this type of growth
pattern is the logistic curve given by the function
where is the population size and is the time. An example is a bacteria culture that is
initially allowed to grow under ideal conditions, and then under less favorable 
conditions that inhibit growth. A logistic growth curve is also called a sigmoidal curve.

75. Forensics
At 8:30 A.M., a coroner was called to the
home of a person who had died during the night. In order
to estimate the time of death, the coroner took the 
person’s temperature twice. At 9:00 A.M. the temperature
was 
and at 11:00 A.M. the temperature was
From these two temperatures, the coroner was
able to determine that the time elapsed since death and
the body temperature were related by the formula
where is the time in hours elapsed since the person died
and 
is the temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) of the
person’s body. (This formula is derived from a 
general cooling principle called Newton’s Law of
Cooling. It uses the assumptions that the person had a
normal body temperature of 
at death, and that the
room temperature was a constant 
) Use the 
formula to estimate the time of death of the person.

■How to find the derivative and 
antiderivative of the natural exponential
function. (8.1)
■How to find the derivative of the natural
logarithmic function, use logarithms as
an aid in differentiating nonlogarithmic

e.
A geyser is a hot spring that erupts periodically when groundwater in a confined
space boils and produces steam. The steam forces overlying water up and out
through an opening on Earth’s surface. The temperature at which water boils is
affected by pressure. Do you think an increase or a decrease in pressure causes
water to boil at a lower temperature? Why? (See Section 8.2, Exercise 88.)

■Find derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions in bases other than e.
Differentiation of the Natural Logarithmic Function
The derivative of the natural logarithmic function is given in the following theorem.
You are asked to prove the theorem in Exercise 101.
So far in your development of the natural logarithmic function, it would have been
difficult to predict its intimate relationship to the rational function 
Hidden 
relationships such as this not only illustrate the joy of mathematical discovery, they also
give you logical alternatives in constructing a mathematical system. An alternative that
Theorem 8.3 provides is that the natural logarithmic function could have been developed
as the 
of 
rather than as the inverse of

pursuing this alternative development of

If you have access to a computer algebra system, use it to find the
indefinite integrals in Examples 5 and 6. How do the forms of the antiderivatives
that it gives you compare with those given in Examples 5 and 6?
TECHNOLOGY

The next example gives another instance in which the use of the Log Rule is
disguised. In this case, a change of variables helps you recognize the Log Rule.

As you study the methods shown in Examples 5 and 6, be aware that both
methods involve rewriting a disguised integrand so that it fits one or more of the basic
integration formulas. In Chapter 11, time will be devoted to integration techniques. To
master these techniques, you must recognize the “form-fitting” nature of integration.
In this sense, integration is not nearly as straightforward as differentiation.
Differentiation takes the form
“Here is the question; what is the answer?”
Integration is more like
“Here is the answer; what is the question?”

GUIDELINES FOR INTEGRATION
1. Learn a basic list of integration formulas. At this point our list consists only
of the Power Rule, the Exponential Rule, and the Log Rule. By the end of
Section 11.5, this list will have expanded to 20 basic rules.
2. Find an integration formula that resembles all or part of the integrand, and,
by trial and error, find a choice of 
that will make the integrand conform to
the formula.
3. If you cannot find a -substitution that works, try altering the integrand. You
might try long division, multiplication and division by the same quantity, or
addition and subtraction of the same quantity. Be creative.
4. If you have access to computer software that will find antiderivatives
symbolically, use it.

u-Substitution and the Log Rule
Solve the differential equation
Solution
The solution can be written as an indefinite integral.
Because the integrand is a quotient whose denominator is raised to the first power, you
should try the Log Rule. There are three basic choices for 
The choices 
and
fail to fit the 
form of the Log Rule. However, the third choice does fit.
Letting 
produces 
and you obtain 
Divide numerator and denominator by

Apply Log Rule.

Because integration is more difficult than differentiation, keep in mind that you
can check your answer to an integration problem by differentiating the answer. For
instance, in Example 7, the derivative of

can use long division to divide by

Differential Equations: Growth and Decay
555
In Examples 2 and 3, you did not actually have to solve the differential equation
(This was done once in the proof of Theorem 8.8.) The next example demonstrates a
problem whose solution involves the separation of variables technique. The example
concerns Newton’s Law of Cooling, which states that the rate of change in the
temperature of an object is proportional to the difference between the object’s 
temperature and the temperature of the surrounding medium.
EXAMPLE
4
Newton’s Law of Cooling
Let 
represent the temperature 
of an object in a room whose temperature is
kept at a constant 
If the object cools from 
to 
in 10 minutes, how much
longer will it take for its temperature to decrease to 
Solution
From Newton’s Law of Cooling, you know that the rate of change in 
is
proportional to the difference between and 60. This can be written as 
To solve this differential equation, use separation of variables, as follows.
Differential equation
Separate variables.
Integrate each side.
Find antiderivative of each side.
Because 
and you can omit the absolute value signs.
Using exponential notation, you have
Using 
when 
you obtain 
which implies
that 
Because 
when 
So, the model is
Cooling model
and finally, when 
you obtain
So, it will require about 14.09 
minutes for the object to cool to a temperature of

Angles
As derived from the Greek language, the word trigonometry means “measurement of
triangles.” Initially, trigonometry dealt with relationships among the sides and angles
of triangles and was used in the development of astronomy, navigation, and surveying.
With the development of calculus and the physical sciences in the 17th century, a 
different perspective arose—one that viewed the classic trigonometric relationships as
functions with the set of real numbers as their domains. Consequently, the applications
of trigonometry expanded to include a vast number of physical phenomena involving
rotations and vibrations. These phenomena include sound waves, light rays, planetary
orbits, vibrating strings, pendulums, and orbits of atomic particles.
The approach in this text incorporates both perspectives, starting with angles and
their measure.
(a) Angle
(b) Angle in standard position
Figure 9.1
An angle is determined by rotating a ray (half-line) about its endpoint. The starting
position of the ray is the initial side of the angle, and the position after rotation is the
terminal side, as shown in Figure 9.1(a). The endpoint of the ray is the vertex of the
angle. This perception of an angle fits a coordinate system in which the origin is 
the vertex and the initial side coincides with the positive -axis. Such an angle is 
in standard position, as shown in Figure 9.1(b). Positive angles are generated by
counterclockwise rotation, and negative angles by clockwise rotation, as shown in
Figure 9.2. Angles are labeled with Greek letters 
(alpha),
(beta), and (theta), as
well as uppercase letters 
and 
In Figure 9.3, note that angles 
and 
have the
same initial and terminal sides. Such angles are coterminal.

Radian and Degree Measure

Radian and Degree Measure
567
Radian Measure
The measure of an angle is determined by the amount of rotation from the initial side
to the terminal side. One way to measure angles is in radians. This type of measure
is especially useful in calculus. To define a radian, you can use a central angle of a 
circle, one whose vertex is the center of the circle, as shown in Figure 9.4.
Because the circumference of a circle is 
units, it follows that a central angle of
one full revolution (counterclockwise) corresponds to an arc length of 
Moreover, because 
there are just over six radius lengths in a full circle, as
shown in Figure 9.5. In general, the radian measure of a central angle is obtained by
dividing the arc length 
by 
That is,
where 
is 
Because the units of measure for 
and 
are the same, this ratio is unitless—it is 
simply a real number.
Because the radian measure of an angle of one full revolution is 
you can
obtain

These and other common angles are shown in Figure 9.6.
Figure 9.6
Recall that the four quadrants in a coordinate system are numbered I, II, III, and
IV. Figure 9.7 shows which angles between 0 and 
lie in each of the four quadrants.
Note that angles between 0 and 
are acute and that angles between 
and 
are
obtuse.
Because two angles are coterminal if they have the same initial and terminal
sides, the angles 0 and 
are coterminal, as are the angles 
and 
You can
find an angle that is coterminal to a given angle 
by adding or subtracting 
(one
revolution), as demonstrated in Example 1. A given angle 
has infinitely many 
coterminal angles. For instance,
is coterminal with

Degree Measure
A second way to measure angles is in terms of degrees, denoted by the symbol 
A measure of one degree 
is equivalent to a rotation of 
of a complete 
revolution about the vertex. To measure angles, it is convenient to mark degrees on 
the circumference of a circle, as shown in Figure 9.10. So, a full revolution 
(counterclockwise) corresponds to 
a half revolution to 
a quarter revolution
to 
and so on.
Because 
radians corresponds to one complete revolution, degrees and radians
are related by the equations
and
From the latter equation, you obtain
and
which lead to the following conversion rules.

Trigonometric Functions: The Unit Circle
■Identify a unit circle and describe its relationship to real numbers.
■Evaluate trigonometric functions using the unit circle.
■Use the domain and period to evaluate sine and cosine functions.
■Use a calculator to evaluate trigonometric functions.
The Unit Circle
The two historical perspectives of trigonometry incorporate different methods for 
introducing the trigonometric functions. Our first introduction to these functions is
based on the unit circle.
Consider the unit circle given by
Unit circle
as shown in Figure 9.15. Imagine that the real number line is wrapped around this 
circle, with positive numbers corresponding to a counterclockwise wrapping and 
negative numbers corresponding to a clockwise wrapping, as shown in Figure 9.16.
Figure 9.16
As the real number line is wrapped around the unit circle, each real number 
corresponds to a point 
on the circle. For example, the real number 0 corresponds
to the point 
Moreover, because the unit circle has a circumference of 
the
real number 
also corresponds to the point 
In general, each real number also corresponds to a central angle 
(in standard
position) whose radian measure is 
With this interpretation of 
the arc length 
formula 
(with 
) indicates that the real number is the (directional) length
of the arc intercepted by the angle 
given in radians.

The Trigonometric Functions
From the preceding discussion, it follows that the coordinates and are two functions
of the real variable 
You can use these coordinates to define the six trigonometric 
functions of 
sine
cosine
tangent
cotangent
secant
cosecant
These six functions are normally abbreviated sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and csc,
respectively.
In the definitions of the trigonometric functions, note that the tangent and secant
are not defined when 
For instance, because 
corresponds to
it follows that 
and 
are undefined. Similarly, the
cotangent and cosecant are not defined when 
For instance, because 
corresponds to 
and csc 0 are undefined.
In Figure 9.17, the unit circle has been divided into eight equal arcs, corresponding
to -values of
and 
Similarly, in Figure 9.18, the unit circle has been divided into 12 equal arcs,
corresponding to -values of
and 
To verify the points on the unit circle in Figure 9.17, note that 
also 
lies on the line 
So, substituting 
for 
in the equation of the unit circle 
produces the following.
Because the point is in the first quadrant,
and because 
you also have
You can use similar reasoning to verify the rest of the points in Figure 9.17
and the points in Figure 9.18.
Using the 
coordinates in Figures 9.17 and 9.18, you can evaluate the
trigonometric functions for common -values. This procedure is demonstrated in
Examples 1, 2, and 3. You should study and learn these exact function values for 
common -values because they will help you in later sections to perform calculations.

Domain and Period of Sine and Cosine
The domain of the sine and cosine functions is the set of all real numbers. To determine
the range of these two functions, consider the unit circle shown in Figure 9.19. By
definition,
and 
Because

So, the values of sine and cosine also range between

and
Adding 
to each value of in the interval 
completes a second revolution
around the unit circle, as shown in Figure 9.20. The values of 
and

and 
Similar results can be obtained for
repeated revolutions (positive or negative) on the unit circle. This leads to the general
result
and
for any integer and real number Functions that behave in such a repetitive (or cyclic)
manner are called periodic.

Evaluating Trigonometric Functions with a Calculator
When evaluating a trigonometric function with a calculator, you need to set the 
calculator to the desired mode of measurement (degree or radian).
Most calculators do not have keys for the cosecant, secant, and cotangent 
functions. To evaluate these functions, you can use the 
key with their respective
reciprocal functions sine, cosine, and tangent. For instance, to evaluate 
use
the fact that

Our second look at the trigonometric functions is from a right triangle perspective.
Consider a right triangle, with one acute angle labeled 
as shown in Figure 9.21. 
Relative to the angle 
the three sides of the triangle are the hypotenuse, the 
opposite side (the side opposite the angle ), and the adjacent side (the side adjacent
to the angle ).
Using the lengths of these three sides, you can form six ratios that define the six
trigonometric functions of the acute angle

In the following definitions, it is important to see that 
lies in the first
quadrant) and that for such angles the value of each trigonometric function is positive.

RIGHT TRIANGLE DEFINITIONS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Let 
be an acute angle of a right triangle. The six trigonometric functions of
the angle are defined as follows. (Note that the functions in the second row
are the reciprocals of the corresponding functions in the first row.)
The abbreviations opp, adj, and hyp represent the lengths of the three sides of

HISTORICAL NOTE
Georg Joachim Rhaeticus (1514–1574) was
the leading Teutonic mathematical
astronomer of the 16th century. He was the
first to define the trigonometric functions 
as ratios of the sides of a right triangle.

Many applications of trigonometry involve a process called solving right
triangles. In this type of application, you are usually given one side of a right triangle
and one of the acute angles and asked to find one of the other sides,
you are given
two sides and asked to find one of the acute angles.
In Example 5, the angle you are given is the angle of elevation, which represents
the angle from the horizontal upward to an object. For objects that lie below the 
horizontal, it is common to use the term angle of depression.

Trigonometric Functions of Any Angle
To see how a reference angle is used to evaluate a trigonometric function, consider the
point 
on the terminal side of 
as shown in Figure 9.34. By definition, you know
that 
and
For the right triangle with acute angle 
and sides of lengths 
and 
you have
and
So, it follows that 
and 
are equal, except possibly in sign. The same is true
for 
and 
and for the other four trigonometric functions. In all cases, the sign
of the function value can be determined by the quadrant in which lies.
By using reference angles and the special angles discussed in the preceding 
section, you can greatly extend the scope of exact trigonometric values. For instance,
knowing the function values of 
means that you know the function values of all
angles for which 
is a reference angle. For convenience, the table below shows the
exact values of the trigonometric functions of special angles and quadrant angles.

Basic Sine and Cosine Curves
In this section, you will study techniques for sketching the graphs of the sine and
cosine functions. The graph of the sine function is a sine curve. In Figure 9.36, the
black portion of the graph represents one period of the function and is called one cycle
of the sine curve. The gray portion of the graph indicates that the basic sine curve
repeats indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. The graph of the cosine
function is shown in Figure 9.37.
Recall from Section 9.2 that the domain of the sine and cosine functions is the set
of all real numbers. Moreover, the range of each function is the interval 
and
each function has a period of 
Do you see how this information is consistent with
the basic graphs shown in Figures 9.36 and 9.37?
Figure 9.36
Figure 9.37
Note in Figures 9.36 and 9.37 that the sine curve is symmetric with respect to 
the origin, whereas the cosine curve is symmetric with respect to the 
These
properties of symmetry follow from the fact that the sine function is odd and the
cosine function is even. Note also that the cosine curve appears to be a left shift
of the sine curve. More will be said about this later in the section.

TECHNOLOGY
To sketch the graphs of the basic sine and cosine functions by hand, it helps to
note five key points in one period of each graph: the intercepts, maximum points, and 
minimum points (see Figure 9.38).

Note that
indicates that the -values for the key points will have twice the magnitude of those

By connecting these key points with a smooth curve and extending the curve in both
directions over the interval 
you obtain the graph shown in Figure 9.39.

The constant factor in

vertical shrink of the basic sine curve. If 
the basic sine curve is stretched, and
if 
the basic sine curve is shrunk. The result is that the graph of

Mathematical Modeling
Sine and cosine functions can be used to model many real-life situations, including
electric currents, musical tones, radio waves, tides, and weather patterns.
EXAMPLE

Finding a Trigonometric Model
Throughout the day, the depth of water at the end of a dock in Bar Harbor, Maine
varies with the tides. The table shows the depths (in feet) at various times during the 
morning.
(Source: Nautical Software, Inc.)
a. Use a trigonometric function to model the data.
b. Find the depths at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M.
c. A boat needs at least 10 feet of water to moor at the dock. During what times in the
afternoon can it safely dock?
Solution
a. Begin by graphing the data, as shown in Figure 9.46. You can use either a sine or
a cosine model. Use a cosine model of the form
The difference between the maximum height and the minimum height of the graph
is twice the amplitude of the function. So, the amplitude is
The cosine function completes one half of a cycle between the times at which the
maximum and minimum depths occur. So, the period is
which implies that 
Because high tide occurs 4 hours after 
midnight, consider the left endpoint to be 
so 
Moreover,
because the average depth is 
it follows that 
So, you
can model the depth with the function given by
b. The depths at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. are as follows.
9 A.M.
3 P.M.
c. To find out when the depth is at least 10 feet, you can graph the model with the
line 
using a graphing utility, as shown in Figure 9.47. Using the intersect 
feature, you can determine that the depth is at least 10 feet between 2:42 P.M.
and 5:18 P.M.

Graph of the Tangent Function
Recall that the tangent function is odd. That is,
Consequently, the
graph of 
is symmetric with respect to the origin. You also know from the 
identity 
that the tangent is undefined for values at which
Two such values are 
As indicated in the table, tan increases without bound as approaches 
from the
left, and decreases without bound as approaches 
from the right. So, the graph
of 
has vertical asymptotes at 
and 
as shown in 
Figure 9.48. Moreover, because the period of the tangent function is 
vertical 
asymptotes also occur when 
where is an integer. The domain of the
tangent function is the set of all real numbers other than 
and the range
is the set of all real numbers.
Figure 9.48
Sketching the graph of 
is similar to sketching the graph 
of 
in that you locate key points that identify the intercepts and
asymptotes. Two consecutive vertical asymptotes can be found by solving the 
equations
and
The midpoint between two consecutive vertical asymptotes is an -intercept of the graph.
The period of the function 
is the distance between two consecutive
vertical asymptotes. The amplitude of a tangent function is not defined. After plotting the
asymptotes and the -intercept, plot a few additional points between the two asymptotes
and sketch one cycle. Finally, sketch one or two additional cycles to the left and right.

Some graphing 
utilities have difficulty graphing
trigonometric functions that have 
vertical asymptotes. Your graphing
utility may connect parts of the 
graphs of tangent, cotangent, secant,
and cosecant functions that are not
supposed to be connected. To 
eliminate this problem, change 
the mode of the graphing utility 
to dot mode.

Graphs of the Reciprocal Functions
The graphs of the two remaining trigonometric functions can be obtained from the
graphs of the sine and cosine functions using the reciprocal identities
and
For instance, at a given value of 
the -coordinate of sec 
is the reciprocal of the 
-coordinate of cos 
Of course, when 
the reciprocal does not exist. Near
such values of 
the behavior of the secant function is similar to that of the tangent
function. In other words, the graphs of
and
have vertical asymptotes at 
where 
is an integer, and the cosine is
zero at these -values. Similarly,
and
have vertical asymptotes where 
—that is, at 
To sketch the graph of a secant or cosecant function, you should first make a sketch
of its reciprocal function. For instance, to sketch the graph of 
first sketch the
graph of 
Then take reciprocals of the -coordinates to obtain points on the
graph of 
This procedure is used to obtain the graphs shown in Figure 9.53.

Figure 9.53
In comparing the graphs of the cosecant and secant functions with those of the
sine and cosine functions, note that the “hills” and “valleys” are interchanged. For
example, a hill (or maximum point) on the sine curve corresponds to a valley 
(a relative minimum) on the cosecant curve, and a valley (or minimum point) on the
sine curve corresponds to a hill (a relative maximum) on the cosecant curve, as shown
in Figure 9.54. Additionally,
-intercepts of the sine and cosine functions become 
vertical asymptotes of the cosecant and secant functions, respectively (see Figure 9.54).

Inverse Sine Function
Recall from Section 1.5 that, for a function to have an inverse function, it must be 
one-to-one—that is, it must pass the Horizontal Line Test. From Figure 9.59, you can
see that 
does not pass the test because different values of 
yield the same 
-value.
Figure 9.59
However, if you restrict the domain to the interval 
(corresponding to the black portion of the graph in Figure 9.59), the following 
properties hold.
1. On the interval 
the function 
is increasing.
2. On the interval 
takes on its full range of values,
3. On the interval 
is one-to-one.
So, on the restricted domain 
,
has a unique inverse 
function called the inverse sine function. It is denoted by
or
The notation 
is consistent with the inverse function notation 
The arcsin 
notation (read as “the arcsine of ”) comes from the association of a central angle with
its intercepted arc length on a unit circle. So, arcsin means the angle (or arc) whose
sine is 
Both notations, arcsin 
and 
are commonly used in mathematics,
so remember that

As with the trigonometric functions, much of the work with the inverse
trigonometric functions can be done by exact calculations rather than by calculator

functions by relating them to the right triangle definitions of the trigonometric functions.

Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The cosine function is decreasing and one-to-one on the interval 
as
shown in Figure 9.61.

Consequently, on this interval the cosine function has an inverse function—the
inverse cosine function—denoted by
or
Similarly, you can define an inverse tangent function by restricting the domain of
to the interval 
The following list summarizes the definitions
of the three most common inverse trigonometric functions. The remaining three are

Trigonometry and Bearings
In surveying and navigation, directions can be given in terms of bearings. A bearing
measures the acute angle that a path or line of sight makes with a fixed north-south
line, as shown in Figure 9.69. For instance, the bearing S 
E in Figure 9.69 means 
35 degrees east of south.

Trigonometric Functions
Harmonic Motion
The periodic nature of the trigonometric functions is useful for describing the motion
of a point on an object that vibrates, oscillates, rotates, or is moved by wave motion.
For example, consider a ball that is bobbing up and down on the end of a spring,
as shown in Figure 9.71. Suppose that 10 centimeters is the maximum distance the
ball moves vertically upward or downward from its equilibrium (at rest) position.
Suppose further that the time it takes for the ball to move from its maximum
displacement above zero to its maximum displacement below zero and back again is
seconds. Assuming the ideal conditions of perfect elasticity and no friction or
air resistance, the ball would continue to move up and down in a uniform manner.
Figure 9.71
From this spring you can conclude that the period (time for one complete cycle)
of the motion is
and that its amplitude (maximum displacement from equilibrium) is
Motion of this nature can be described by a sine or cosine function, and is called
simple harmonic motion.

10.2 Verifying Trigonometric Identities
■Verify trigonometric identities.
Introduction
In this section, you will study techniques for verifying trigonometric identities. In the
next section, you will study techniques for solving trigonometric equations. The key
to verifying identities and solving equations is the ability to use the fundamental 
identities and the rules of algebra to rewrite trigonometric expressions.
Remember that a conditional equation is an equation that is true for only some of
the values in its domain. For example, the conditional equation
Conditional equation
is true only for 
where 
is an integer. When you find these values, you are 
solving the equation. 
On the other hand, an equation that is true for all real values in the domain of the
variable is an identity. For example, the familiar equation
Identity
is true for all real numbers 
So, it is an identity.
Verifying Trigonometric Identities
Although there are similarities, verifying that a trigonometric equation is an identity is
quite different from solving an equation. There is no well-defined set of rules to follow
in verifying trigonometric identities, and the process is best learned by practice.
Verifying trigonometric identities is a useful process if you need to convert a
trigonometric expression into a form that is more useful algebraically. When you 
verify an identity, you cannot assume that the two sides of the equation are equal
because you are trying to verify that they are equal. As a result, when verifying 
identities, you cannot use operations such as adding the same quantity to each side of
the equation or cross multiplication.

GUIDELINES FOR VERIFYING TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES
1. Work with one side of the equation at a time. It is often better to work with
the more complicated side first.
2. Look for opportunities to factor an expression, add fractions, square a
binomial, or create a monomial denominator.
3. Look for opportunities to use the fundamental identities. Note which
functions are in the final expression you want. Sines and cosines pair up
well, as do secants and tangents, and cosecants and cotangents.
4. If the preceding guidelines do not help, try converting all terms to sines
and cosines.
5. Always try something. Even paths that lead to dead ends provide insights.

Notice how the identity is verified. You start with the left side of the equation (the
more complicated side) and use the fundamental trigonometric identities to simplify
it until you obtain the right side.

There can be more than one way to verify an identity. Here is another way to
verify the identity in Example 1.

Although a graphing

an identity, you must use algebraic 
techniques to produce a valid proof.
STUDY TIP

In Examples 1 through 5, you have been verifying trigonometric identities by 
working with one side of the equation and converting to the form given on the other side.
On occasion, it is practical to work with each side separately, to obtain one common
form equivalent to both sides. This is illustrated in Example 6.

10.3 Solving Trigonometric Equations
■Use standard algebraic techniques to solve trigonometric equations.
■Solve trigonometric equations of quadratic type.
■Solve trigonometric equations involving multiple angles.
■Use inverse trigonometric functions to solve trigonometric equations.
Introduction
To solve a trigonometric equation, use standard algebraic techniques such as
collecting like terms and factoring. Your preliminary goal in solving a trigonometric
equation is to isolate the trigonometric function in the equation. For example, to solve 
the equation 
divide each side by 2 to obtain 
To solve for 
note
in Figure 10.6 that the equation 
has solutions 
and 
in the
interval 
Moreover, because 
has a period of 
there are infinitely many
other solutions, which can be written as
and
General solution
where is an integer, as shown in Figure 10.6.
Figure 10.6
Another way to show that the equation 
has infinitely many solutions is 
indicated in Figure 10.7. Any angles that are coterminal with 
or 
will also
be solutions of the equation.

When solving trigonometric equations, you should write your answer(s) using
exact values rather than decimal approximations.

STUDY TIP

The equations in Examples 1 and 2 involved only one trigonometric function.
When two or more functions occur in the same equation, collect all terms on one side
and try to separate the functions by factoring or by using appropriate identities. This
may produce factors that yield no solutions, as illustrated in Example 3.

Sometimes you must square each side of an equation to obtain a quadratic, as
demonstrated in the next example. Because this procedure can introduce extraneous
solutions, you should check any solutions in the original equation to see whether they
are valid or extraneous.

You square each side of
the equation in Example 6 because the
squares of the sine and cosine functions
are related by a Pythagorean identity.
The same is true for the squares of the
secant and tangent functions and for the
squares of the cosecant and cotangent
functions.

EXAMPLE 12 Projectile Motion
Ignoring air resistance, the range of a projectile fired at an angle with the horizontal
and with an initial velocity of 
feet per second is given by
where is the horizontal distance (in feet) that the projectile will travel. A place kicker
for a football team can kick a football from ground level with an initial velocity of 
80 feet per second (see Figure 10.18).
Figure 10.18
a. Write the projectile motion model in a simpler form.
b. At what angle must the player kick the football so that the football travels 200 feet?
c. For what angle is the horizontal distance the football travels a maximum?
Solution
a. You can use a double-angle formula to rewrite the projectile motion model as
Rewrite original projectile motion model.
Rewrite model using a double-angle formula.
b.
Write projectile motion model.
Substitute 200 for and 80 for 
Simplify.
Divide each side by 200.
You know that 
so dividing this result by 2 produces 
Because
you can conclude that the player must kick the football at an angle of
so that the football will travel 200 feet.
c. From the model 
you can see that the amplitude is 200. So the 
maximum range is 
feet. From part (b), you know that this corresponds to
an angle of 
Therefore, kicking the football at an angle of 
will produce a 
maximum horizontal distance of 200 feet.

Owaki - Kulla/Photolibrary
So far in your study of calculus, you have
learned to find limits, differentiate, and
integrate several types of functions,
including algebraic, exponential, and 
logarithmic functions. In this chapter,
the first five sections discuss calculus 
of trigonometric functions, and the 
last section briefly discusses a class of
functions called hyperbolic functions.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How to determine limits of trigonometric
functions. (11.1)
■How to find derivatives of trigonometric
functions. (11.2)
■How to find antiderivatives of 
trigonometric functions. (11.3)
■How to find derivatives of inverse
trigonometric functions. (11.4)
■How to find antiderivatives involving
inverse trigonometric functions. (11.5)
■The properties of hyperbolic functions.
How to find derivatives and antideriva-
tives of hyperbolic functions. (11.6)
The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri is over 600 feet high and covered with 
886 tons of quarter-inch stainless steel. A mathematical equation used to construct
the arch involves which function? (See Section 11.6, Section Project.)

■Determine the limits of trigonometric functions.
Limits of Trigonometric Functions
In the next section, you will see how the derivatives of the trigonometric functions can
assist you in sketching graphs of trigonometric functions. However, before 
discussing these derivatives, you need to obtain some results regarding the limits of
trigonometric functions. In Chapter 3, you saw that the limits of many algebraic 
functions can be evaluated by direct substitution. Each of the six basic trigonometric
functions also exhibit this desirable quality, as shown in the next theorem (presented
without proof).

damped by the factor

Derivatives of Sine and Cosine Functions
In the preceding section, you studied the following limits. 
and
These two limits are crucial in the proofs of the derivatives of the sine and cosine
functions. The derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions follow easily from
these two.
This differentiation formula is shown graphically in Figure 11.5. Note that for each 
the 
of the sine curve is equal to the 
of the cosine. Moreover, when 
is
increasing,
is positive, and when is decreasing,
is negative.

If you are having 
difficulty getting the correct answer 
to a calculus problem, be sure to check
that your algebra is correct. Frequent
algebraic errors can make calculus 
seem confusing and difficult.

Applications
In the remainder of this section, some applications of the derivative in the context of
trigonometric functions will be reviewed. An application to minimum and maximum
values of a function on a closed interval is shown in Example 9.

By setting the two factors equal to zero and solving for in the interval 
you
have the following.
Critical numbers

Finally, by evaluating 
at these four critical numbers and at the endpoints of the
interval, you can conclude that the maximum is 
and the minimum occurs

EXAMPLE 10 Modeling Seasonal Sales
A fertilizer manufacturer finds that the sales of one of its fertilizer brands follows a
seasonal pattern that can be modeled by
where 
is the amount sold (in pounds) and 
is the time (in days), with 
representing January 1. On which day of the year is the maximum amount of 
fertilizer sold?
Solution
You can find the derivative of the model as shown below.
Write original function.
Distributive Property
Apply Chain Rule.
Simplify.
Setting this derivative equal to zero produces
Because the cosine is zero at 
and 
you obtain the following.
The 151st day of the year is May 31 and the 334th day of the year is November 30.
From the graph in Figure 11.9, you can see that according to the model, the maximum
sales occur on May 31.

on top of the car turns at a rate of 30 revolutions per
minute. How fast is the light beam moving along the wall
when the beam makes angles of (a) 
(b) 
and (c) 
with the perpendicular line
from the light to the wall?

Each integral in Example 1 is easily recognized as fitting one of the basic integra-
tion formulas in Theorem 11.5. However, because of the variety of trigonometric iden-

in a disguised form. This is shown in the next two examples.

In Examples 4 and 5,
-substitution is used with a change

In Theorem 11.5, six trigonometric integration formulas are listed—the six that
correspond directly to differentiation rules. With the Log Rule, you can now complete
the set of basic trigonometric integration formulas.
EXAMPLE

The Antiderivative of the Tangent

Solution
This integral does not seem to fit any formulas on our basic list. However,
by using a trigonometric identity, you obtain the following quotient form.
Now, knowing that 
you can let

Substitute:
Apply Log Rule.
Back-substitute.

Example 7 uses a trigonometric identity together with the Log Rule to derive an
integration formula for the tangent function. The next example takes a rather unusual
step (multiplying and dividing by the same quantity) to derive an integration formula
for the secant function.

Review of Basic Differentiation Rules
In the 1600s, Europe was ushered into the scientific age by such great thinkers as
Descartes, Galileo, Huygens, Newton, and Kepler. These men believed that nature is
governed by basic laws—laws that can, for the most part, be written in terms of
mathematical equations. One of the most influential publications of this period—
Dialogue on the Great World Systems, by Galileo Galilei—has become a classic
description of modern scientific thought.
As mathematics has developed during the past few hundred years, a small num-
ber of elementary functions have proven sufficient for modeling most* phenomena in
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, economics, and a variety of other fields. An
elementary function is a function from the following list or one that can be formed
as the sum, product, quotient, or composition of functions in the list.
Polynomial functions
Logarithmic functions
Rational functions
Exponential functions
Functions involving radicals
Trigonometric functions
Inverse trigonometric functions
With the differentiation rules introduced so far in the text, you can differentiate any
elementary function. For convenience, these differentiation rules are summarized
below.

GALILEO GALILEI (1564–1642)
Galileo’s approach to science departed from
the accepted Aristotelian view that nature
had describable qualities, such as “fluidity”
and “potentiality.” He chose to describe the
physical world in terms of measurable 
quantities, such as time, distance, force, 
and mass.
* Some important functions used in engineering and science (such as Bessel functions and
gamma functions) are not elementary functions.

■Integrate functions whose antiderivatives involve inverse trigonometric functions.
■Use the method of completing the square to integrate a function.
■Review the basic integration rules involving elementary functions.
Integrals Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions fall into three pairs. In each
pair, the derivative of one function is the negative of the other. For example,
and
When listing the antiderivative that corresponds to each of the inverse trigonometric
functions, you need to use only one member from each pair. It is conventional to use
as the antiderivative of 
rather than 
The next theorem
gives one antiderivative formula for each of the three pairs. The proofs of these
integration rules are left to you (see Exercises 59–61).

Computer software that can perform
symbolic integration is useful for
integrating functions such as the 
one in Example 2. When using 
such software, however, you must
remember that it can fail to find an
antiderivative for two reasons. First,
some elementary functions simply 
do not have antiderivatives that are
elementary functions. Second, every
symbolic integration utility has 
limitations—you might have entered 
a function that the software was not
programmed to handle. You should
also remember that antiderivatives
involving trigonometric functions or
logarithmic functions can be written 
in many different forms. For instance,
one symbolic integration utility found
the integral in Example 2 to be

Review of Basic Integration Rules
You have now completed the introduction of the basic integration rules. To be
efficient at applying these rules, you should have practiced enough so that each rule is
committed to memory.
You can learn a lot about the nature of integration by comparing this list with the
summary of differentiation rules given in the preceding section. For differentiation,
you now have rules that allow you to differentiate any elementary function. For
integration, this is far from true.
The integration rules listed above are primarily those that were happened on 
during the development of differentiation rules. So far, you have not learned any rules
or techniques for finding the antiderivative of a general product or quotient, the 
natural logarithmic function, or the inverse trigonometric functions. More importantly,
you cannot apply any of the rules in this list unless you can create the proper 
corresponding to the in the formula.

Hyperbolic Functions
In this section, you will look briefly at a special class of exponential functions called
hyperbolic functions. The name hyperbolic function arose from comparison of the
area of a semicircular region, as shown in Figure 11.14, with the area of a region under
a hyperbola, as shown in Figure 11.15. The integral for the semicircular region
involves an inverse trigonometric (circular) function:
The integral for the hyperbolic region involves an inverse hyperbolic function:
This is only one of many ways in which the hyperbolic functions are similar to the
trigonometric functions.

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
Unlike trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions are not periodic. In fact, by
looking back at Figure 11.16, you can see that four of the six hyperbolic functions are
actually one-to-one (the hyperbolic sine, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent). So, you
can conclude that these four functions have inverse functions. The other two (the
hyperbolic cosine and secant) are one-to-one if their domains are restricted to the 
positive real numbers, and for this restricted domain they also have inverse functions.
Because the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions, it is
not surprising to find that the inverse hyperbolic functions can be written in terms of
logarithmic functions, as shown in Theorem 11.9.

The inverse hyperbolic secant can be used to define a curve called a tractrix or
pursuit curve, as discussed in Example 5.
The graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions are shown in Figure 11.20.

A Tractrix
A person is holding a rope that is tied to a boat, as shown in Figure 11.21. As the 
person walks along the dock, the boat travels along a tractrix, given by the equation
where 
is the length of the rope. If 
feet, find the distance the person must
walk to bring the boat to a position 5 feet from the dock.
Solution
In Figure 11.21, notice that the distance the person has walked is given by
When 
this distance is
feet.

Differentiation and Integration of Inverse Hyperbolic
Functions
The derivatives of the inverse hyperbolic functions, which resemble the derivatives of
the inverse trigonometric functions, are listed in Theorem 11.10 with the corresponding
integration formulas (in logarithmic form). You can verify each of these formulas by
applying the logarithmic definitions of the inverse hyperbolic functions. (See Exercises
73–75.)

More About a Tractrix
For the tractrix given in Example 5, show that the boat is always pointing toward the
person.
Solution
For a point 
on a tractrix, the slope of the graph gives the direction of
the boat, as shown in Figure 11.21.
However, from Figure 11.21, you can see that the slope of the line segment connect-
ing the point 
with the point 
is also
So, the boat is always pointing toward the person. (It is because of this property that
a tractrix is called a pursuit curve.)

Graphing an equation in the polar coordinate system involves tracing a curve about a fixed point called the pole.
One special type of polar graph is called a rose curve because each loop on the graph forms a petal. You will learn
how to sketch polar equations such as rose curves by plotting points and using your knowledge of symmetry, zeros,
and maximum values. (See Section 12.6.)
Chuck Savage/Corbis Edge/Corbis
In this chapter, you will analyze and write 
equations of conics using their properties.
You will also learn how to write and graph
parametric equations and polar equations. 
In addition to the rectangular equations of
conics, you will also study polar equations 
of conics.
In this chapter, you should learn the 
following.
■How to write equations of parabolas 
in standard form and solve real-life 
problems. (12.1)
■How to write equations of ellipses in 
standard form and solve real-life 
problems. (12.2)
■How to write equations of hyperbolas 
in standard form, solve real-life 
problems, and classify conics from 
their general equations. (12.3)
■How to sketch curves that are represented
by sets of parametric equations. (12.4)
■How to understand the polar coordinate 
system and rewrite rectangular 
coordinates and equations in polar 
form and vice versa. (12.5)
■How to sketch graphs of polar equations
and recognize special polar graphs. (12.6)
■How to write and graph equations of
conics in polar form. (12.7)
The path of a baseball hit at a particular height at an angle with the horizontal can
be modeled using parametric equations. How can a set of parametric equations be
used to find the minimum angle at which the ball must leave the bat in order for the
hit to be a home run? (See Section 12.4, Exercise 103.)

■Recognize a conic as the intersection of a plane and a double-napped cone.
■Write equations of parabolas in standard form and graph parabolas.
■Use the reflective property of parabolas to solve real-life problems.
Conics
Conic sections were discovered during the classical Greek period, 600 to 300 B.C. The
early Greeks were concerned largely with the geometric properties of conics. It was
not until the 17th century that the broad applicability of conics became apparent and
played a prominent role in the early development of calculus.
A conic section (or simply conic) is the intersection of a plane and a double-napped
cone. Notice in Figure 12.1 that in the formation of the four basic conics, the 
intersecting plane does not pass through the vertex of the cone. When the plane 
does pass through the vertex, the resulting figure is a degenerate conic, as shown in 
Figure 12.2.

There are several ways to approach the study of conics. You could begin by 
defining conics in terms of the intersections of planes and cones, as the Greeks did, or
you could define them algebraically, in terms of the general second-degree equation
General second-degree equation
However, you will study a third approach, in which each of the conics is defined as a
locus (collection) of points satisfying a geometric property. For example, in Section P.4,
you learned that a circle is defined as the collection of all points 
that are 
equidistant from a fixed point

12.1 Introduction to Conics: Parabolas

Parabolas
The first type of conic is called a parabola and is defined below.
The midpoint between the focus and the directrix is called the vertex, and the line
passing through the focus and the vertex is called the axis of the parabola. Note in 
Figure 12.3 that a parabola is symmetric with respect to its axis. Using the definition
of a parabola, you can derive the following standard form of the equation of a parabola
whose directrix is parallel to the -axis or to the -axis.

DEFINITION OF PARABOLA
A parabola is the set of all points 
in a plane that are equidistant from a
fixed line (directrix) and a fixed point (focus) not on the line.

THEOREM 12.1 STANDARD EQUATION OF A PARABOLA
The standard form of the equation of a parabola with vertex at 
is 
as follows.
Vertical axis, directrix:
Horizontal axis, directrix:
The focus lies on the axis units (directed distance) from the vertex. If the 
vertex is at the origin 
the equation takes one of the following forms.

The case for which the directrix is parallel to the -axis and the focus lies

Add 12 to each side.
Divide each side by 12.
The graph of this parabola is shown in Figure 12.7.
■
Application
A line segment that passes through the focus of a parabola and has endpoints on the
parabola is called a focal chord. The specific focal chord perpendicular to the axis of
the parabola is called the latus rectum.
Parabolas occur in a wide variety of applications. For instance, a parabolic 
reflector can be formed by revolving a parabola around its axis. The resulting surface
has the property that all incoming rays parallel to the axis are reflected through the
focus of the parabola. This is the principle behind the construction of the parabolic
mirrors used in reflecting telescopes. Conversely, the light rays emanating from the
focus of a parabolic reflector used in a flashlight are all parallel to one another, as
shown in Figure 12.8.
Tangent lines to parabolas have special properties related to the use of parabolas
in constructing reflective surfaces.

12.2 Ellipses and Implicit Differentiation
DEFINITION OF ELLIPSE
An ellipse is the set of all points 
in a plane, the sum of whose distances
from two distinct fixed points (foci) is constant. See Figure 12.10.

■Find eccentricities of ellipses.
Introduction
The second type of conic is called an ellipse, and is defined as follows.
is constant.
Figure 12.10
Figure 12.11
The line through the foci intersects the ellipse at two points called vertices. The
chord joining the vertices is the major axis, and its midpoint is the center of the
ellipse. The chord perpendicular to the major axis at the center is the minor axis of
the ellipse. See Figure 12.11.
You can visualize the definition of an ellipse by imagining two thumbtacks placed
at the foci, as shown in Figure 12.12. If the ends of a fixed length of string are fastened
to the thumbtacks and the string is drawn taut with a pencil, the path traced by the
pencil will be an ellipse.
Figure 12.12
To derive the standard form of the equation of an ellipse, consider the ellipse 
in Figure 12.13 with the following points: center,
vertices,
foci,
Note that the center is the midpoint of the segment joining the foci. The
sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. Using a 
vertex point, this constant sum is 
or simply the length of the
major axis. Now, if you let 
be any point on the ellipse, the sum of the distances
between 
and the two foci must also be 2a.

1
Finding the Standard Equation of an Ellipse
Find the standard form of the equation of the ellipse having foci at 
and 
and a major axis of length 6, as shown in Figure 12.15.
Solution
Because the foci occur at 
and 
the center of the ellipse is 
and the distance from the center to one of the foci is 
Because 
you
know that 
Now, from 
you have
Because the major axis is horizontal, the standard equation is 
This equation simplifies to

Sketching an Ellipse
Sketch the ellipse given by 
Solution
Begin by writing the original equation in standard form. In the fourth step,
note that 9 and 4 are added to both sides of the equation when completing the squares.
Write original equation.
Group terms.
Factor 4 out of 
terms.
Write in completed square form.
Divide each side by 4.
Write in standard form.
From this standard form, it follows that the center is 
Because the
denominator of the -term is 
the endpoints of the major axis lie two units to
the right and left of the center. Similarly, because the denominator of the -term is
the endpoints of the minor axis lie one unit up and down from the center. Now,
from 
you have 
So, the foci of the ellipse are

Finding the Area of an Ellipse
Find the area of an ellipse whose major and minor axes have lengths of 
and 
respectively.
Solution
For simplicity, choose an ellipse centered at the origin
Then, using symmetry, you can find the area of the entire region lying within the
ellipse by finding the area of the region in the first quadrant and multiplying by 4, as
indicated in Figure 12.19. In the first quadrant, you have
which implies that the entire area is

Application
Ellipses have many practical and aesthetic uses. For instance, machine gears, supporting
arches, and acoustic designs often involve elliptical shapes. The orbits of satellites 
and planets are also ellipses. Example 5 investigates the elliptical orbit of the moon
about Earth.
EXAMPLE

An Application Involving an Elliptical Orbit
The moon travels about Earth in an elliptical orbit with Earth at one focus, as shown in
Figure 12.20. The major and minor axes of the orbit have lengths of 768,800 kilometers
and 767,640 kilometers, respectively. Find the greatest and smallest distances (the
apogee and perigee, respectively) from Earth’s center to the moon’s center.
Solution
Because 
and 
you have 
and
which implies that  
So, the greatest distance between the center of Earth and the center of the moon is
kilometers and the smallest distance is 
kilometers.
■
Eccentricity
One of the reasons it was difficult for early astronomers to detect that the orbits of the
planets are ellipses is that the foci of the planetary orbits are relatively close to their 
centers, and so the orbits are nearly circular. To measure the ovalness of an ellipse, you
can use the concept of eccentricity.
To see how this ratio is used to describe the shape of an ellipse, note that because
the foci of an ellipse are located along the major axis between the vertices and the 
center, it follows that 
For an ellipse that is nearly circular, the foci are close
to the center and the ratio 
is small, as shown in Figure 12.21. On the other hand, for
an elongated ellipse, the foci are close to the vertices and the ratio 
is close to 1,
as shown in Figure 12.22.

ellipse can be drawn using two thumbtacks, a string
of fixed length (greater than the distance between the
two tacks), and a pencil. If the ends of the string are

12.3 Hyperbolas and Implicit Differentiation
DEFINITION OF HYPERBOLA
A hyperbola is the set of all points 
in a plane, the difference of whose
distances from two distinct fixed points (foci) is a positive constant. See
Figure 12.23.

■Write equations of hyperbolas in standard form.
■Find asymptotes of and graph hyperbolas.
■Use implicit differentiation to find the slope of a line tangent to a hyperbola.
■Use properties of hyperbolas to solve real-life problems.
■Classify conics from their general equations.
Introduction
The third type of conic is called a hyperbola. The definition of a hyperbola is similar
to that of an ellipse. The difference is that for an ellipse the sum of the distances
between the foci and a point on the ellipse is fixed, whereas for a hyperbola the 
difference of the distances between the foci and a point on the hyperbola is fixed.
Figure 12.23
Figure 12.24
The graph of a hyperbola has two disconnected branches. The line through the
two foci intersects the hyperbola at its two vertices. The line segment connecting the
vertices is the transverse axis, and the midpoint of the transverse axis is the center
of the hyperbola. See Figure 12.24. The development of the standard form of the 
equation of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse. Note in the definition below

Because 
for a hyperbola, it follows that 
If the eccentricity is large,
the branches of the hyperbola are nearly flat, as shown in Figure 12.32. If the 
eccentricity is close to 1, the branches of the hyperbola are more narrow, as shown in
Figure 12.33.

The following application was developed during World War II. It shows how the 
properties of hyperbolas can be used in radar and other detection systems.

An Application Involving Hyperbolas
Two microphones, 1 mile apart, record an explosion. Microphone A receives the
sound 2 seconds before microphone B. Where did the explosion occur? (Assume
sound travels at 1100 feet per second.)
Solution
Assuming sound travels at 1100 feet per second, you know that the 
explosion took place 2200 feet farther from B than from A, as shown in Figure 12.34.
The locus of all points that are 2200 feet closer to A than to B is one branch of the
hyperbola 
where 
and 
So,
and you can conclude that the 
explosion occurred somewhere on the right branch of the hyperbola

Another interesting application of conic sections involves the orbits of comets in
our solar system. Of the 610 comets identified prior to 1970, 245 have elliptical orbits,
295 have parabolic orbits, and 70 have hyperbolic orbits. The center of the sun is a
focus of each of these orbits, and each orbit has a vertex at the point where the comet
is closest to the sun, as shown in Figure 12.35. Undoubtedly, there have been many
comets with parabolic or hyperbolic orbits that were not identified. We only get to see
such comets once. Comets with elliptical orbits, such as Halley’s comet, are the only
ones that remain in our solar system.
If 
is the distance between the vertex and the focus (in meters), and 
is the
velocity of the comet at the vertex (in meters per second), then the type of orbit is
determined as follows.
Ellipse:
Parabola:
Hyperbola:

Three listening stations located at

explosion. The last two stations detect the explosion 
1 second and 4 seconds after the first, respectively.
Determine the coordinates of the explosion. (Assume
that the coordinate system is measured in feet and that
sound travels at 1100 feet per second.)
70. LORAN
Long distance radio navigation for aircraft and
ships uses synchronized pulses transmitted by widely
separated transmitting stations. These pulses travel at 
the speed of light (186,000 miles per second). The 
difference in the times of arrival of these pulses at an 
aircraft or ship is constant on a hyperbola having the
transmitting stations as foci. Assume that two stations,
300 miles apart, are positioned on the rectangular 
coordinate system at points with coordinates 
and 
and that a ship is traveling on a hyperbolic
path with coordinates 
(see figure). 
(a) Find the -coordinate of the position of the ship if
the time difference between the pulses from the
transmitting stations is 1000 microseconds (0.001
second).
(b) Determine the distance between the ship and 
station 1 when the ship reaches the shore.
(c) The ship wants to enter a bay located between the two
stations. The bay is 30 miles from station 1. What
should be the time difference between the pulses?
(d) The ship is 60 miles offshore when the time 
difference in part (c) is obtained. What is the 
position of the ship?

Plane Curves
Up to this point you have been representing a graph by a single equation involving the
two variables and 
In this section, you will study situations in which it is useful to
introduce a third variable to represent a curve in the plane.
To see the usefulness of this procedure, consider the path followed by an object
that is propelled into the air at an angle of 
If the initial velocity of the object is 
48 feet per second, it can be shown that the object follows the parabolic path 
Rectangular equation
as shown in Figure 12.37. However, this equation does not tell the whole story.
Although it does tell you where the object has been, it does not tell you when
the object was at a given point 
on the path. To determine this time, you can 
introduce a third variable , called a parameter. It is possible to write both and as
functions of to obtain the parametric equations

From this set of equations you can determine that at time 
the object is at the
point

the object is at the point

Sketching a Plane Curve
When sketching a curve represented by a pair of parametric equations, you still plot
points in the 
-plane. Each set of coordinates 
is determined from a value chosen
for the parameter 
Plotting the resulting points in the order of increasing values of 
traces the curve in a specific direction. This is called the orientation of the curve.
EXAMPLE
1
Sketching a Curve
Sketch the curve given by the parametric equations
and
Solution
Using values of in the specified interval, the parametric equations yield
the points 
shown in the table.
By plotting these points in the order of increasing 
you obtain the curve 
shown in
Figure 12.38. Note that the arrows on the curve indicate its orientation as increases
from 
to 3. So, if a particle were moving on this curve, it would start at 
and then move along the curve to the point 
Figure 12.38
■
Note that the graph shown in Figure 12.38 does not define as a function of 
This
points out one benefit of parametric equations—they can be used to represent graphs that
are more general than graphs of functions. It often happens that two different sets of 
parametric equations have the same graph. For example, the set of parametric equations
and
has the same graph as the set given in Example 1. However, by comparing the values
of 
in Figures 12.38 and 12.39, you can see that this second graph is traced out 
more rapidly (considering as time) than the first graph. So, in applications, different
parametric representations can be used to represent various speeds at which objects
travel along a given path.

STUDY TIP

Eliminating the Parameter
Example 1 uses simple point plotting to sketch the curve. This tedious process can
sometimes be simplified by finding a rectangular equation (in 
and ) that has the
same graph. This process is called eliminating the parameter.
Now you can recognize that the equation 
represents a parabola with a 
horizontal axis and vertex at 
When converting equations from parametric to rectangular form, you may need
to alter the domain of the rectangular equation so that its graph matches the graph of
the parametric equations. Such a situation is demonstrated in Example 2.
EXAMPLE
2
Eliminating the Parameter
Sketch the curve represented by the equations
and
by eliminating the parameter and adjusting the domain of the resulting rectangular 
equation.
Solution
Solving for in the equation for produces
which implies that
Now, substituting in the equation for 
you obtain the rectangular equation
From this rectangular equation, you can recognize that the curve is a parabola that
opens downward and has its vertex at 
Also, this rectangular equation is defined
for all values of 
but from the parametric equation for you can see that the curve is
defined only when 
This implies that you should restrict the domain of 
to 
positive values, as shown in Figure 12.40.

from 0 to 
■
In Examples 2 and 3, it is important to realize that eliminating the parameter is 
primarily an aid to curve sketching. If the parametric equations represent the path of 
a moving object, the graph alone is not sufficient to describe the object’s motion. You
still need the parametric equations to tell you the position, direction, and speed at a
given time.
Finding Parametric Equations for a Graph
You have been studying techniques for sketching the graph represented by a set of 
parametric equations. Now consider the reverse problem—that is, how can you find a
set of parametric equations for a given graph or a given physical description? From
the discussion following Example 1, you know that such a representation is not
unique. That is, the equations
and
produced the same graph as the equations

This is further demonstrated in Example 4.

Slope and Tangent Lines
Now that you can represent a graph in the plane by a set of parametric equations, it is
natural to ask how to use calculus to study plane curves. To begin, let’s take another
look at the projectile represented by the parametric equations
and
as shown in Figure 12.44. You know that these equations enable you to locate the
position of the projectile at a given time. You also know that the object is initially
projected at an angle of 
But how can you find the angle representing the object’s
direction at some other time 
The following theorem answers this question by 
giving a formula for the slope of the tangent line as a function of 
Because

higher-order derivatives. For instance,

12.5 Polar Coordinates and Calculus
■Understand the polar coordinate system.
■Rewrite rectangular coordinates and equations in polar form and vice versa.
■Find the slope of a tangent line to a polar graph.
Polar Coordinates
So far, you have been representing graphs as collections of points 
on the
rectangular coordinate system. The corresponding equations for these graphs have
been in either rectangular or parametric form. In this section you will study a
coordinate system called the polar coordinate system.
To form the polar coordinate system in the plane, fix a point 
called the pole
(or origin), and construct from 
an initial ray called the polar axis, as shown in
Figure 12.46. Then each point 
in the plane can be assigned polar coordinates
as follows.
Figure 12.47 shows three points on the polar coordinate system. Notice that in this
system, it is convenient to locate points with respect to a grid of concentric circles
intersected by radial lines through the pole.
(a)
(b)
(c)
Figure 12.47
With rectangular coordinates, each point 
has a unique representation. This
is not true with polar coordinates. For instance, the coordinates 
and 
represent the same point [see parts (b) and (c) in Figure 12.47]. Also, because is a
directed distance, the coordinates 
and 
represent the same point. In
general, the point 
can be written as
or
where is any integer. Moreover, the pole is represented by 
where is any angle.
Coordinate Conversion
To establish the relationship between polar and rectangular coordinates, let the polar
axis coincide with the positive axis and the pole with the origin, as shown in Figure
12.48. Because 
lies on a circle of radius 
it follows that 
Moreover, for 
the definitions of the trigonometric functions imply that
and 
If 
you can show that the same
relationships hold.

Equation Conversion
By comparing Examples 1 and 2, you can see that point conversion from the polar 
to the rectangular system is straightforward, whereas point conversion from the 
rectangular to the polar system is more involved. For equations, the opposite is true.
To convert a rectangular equation to polar form, you simply replace by 
and
by 
For instance, the rectangular equation 
can be written in polar form
as follows.
Rectangular equation
Polar equation
Simplest form
On the other hand, converting a polar equation to rectangular form requires considerable
ingenuity.
Example 3 demonstrates several polar-to-rectangular conversions that enable you
to sketch the graphs of some polar equations.
EXAMPLE
3
Converting Polar Equations to Rectangular Form
Describe the graph of each polar equation and find the corresponding rectangular
equation.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. The graph of the polar equation 
consists of all points that are two units from
the pole. In other words, this graph is a circle centered at the origin with a radius
of 2, as shown in Figure 12.51. You can confirm this by converting to rectangular
form, using the relationship 
Polar equation
Rectangular equation
b. The graph of the polar equation 
consists of all points on the line that
makes an angle of 
with the positive polar axis, as shown in Figure 12.52. To
convert to rectangular form, make use of the relationship 
Polar equation
Rectangular equation
c. The graph of the polar equation 
is not evident by simple inspection, so
convert to rectangular form by using the relationship

Now you see that the graph is a vertical line, as shown in Figure 12.53.

12.6 Graphs of Polar Equations
■Graph polar equations by point plotting.
■Use symmetry, zeros, and maximum r-values to sketch graphs of polar equations.
■Recognize special polar graphs.
Introduction
In previous chapters, you learned how to sketch graphs on rectangular coordinate
systems. You began with the basic point-plotting method, which was then enhanced
by sketching aids such as symmetry, intercepts, asymptotes, relative extrema,
concavity, periods, and shifts. This section approaches curve sketching on the polar
coordinate system similarly, beginning with a demonstration of point plotting.
EXAMPLE
1
Graphing a Polar Equation by Point Plotting
Sketch the graph of the polar equation 
Solution
The sine function is periodic, so you can get a full range of -values by
considering values of in the interval 
as shown in the following table.
If you plot these points, as shown in Figure 12.56, it appears that the graph is a circle
of radius 2 whose center is at the point 
Try confirming this by letting
in the polar equation and converting the result to rectangular form.
■
Symmetry
In Figure 12.56, note that as 
increases from 0 to 
the graph is traced out twice.
Moreover, note that the graph is symmetric with respect to the line
Had you
known about this symmetry and retracing ahead of time, you could have used fewer
points.
Symmetry with respect to the line 
is one of three important types of
symmetry to consider in polar curve sketching, as shown in Figure 12.57.

Using Symmetry to Sketch a Polar Graph
Use symmetry to sketch the graph of
Solution
Replacing 
by 
produces
So, you can conclude that the curve is symmetric with respect to the polar axis.
Plotting the points in the table and using polar axis symmetry, you obtain the graph of
a limaçon, as shown in Figure 12.58.
■
The three tests for symmetry in polar coordinates are sufficient to guarantee
symmetry, but they are not necessary. For instance, Figure 12.59 shows the graph of
to be symmetric with respect to the line 
and yet the tests fail to
indicate symmetry.
The equations discussed in Examples 1 and 2 are of the form
and
The graph of the first equation is symmetric with respect to the line 
and 
the graph of the second equation is symmetric with respect to the polar axis. This
observation can be generalized to yield the following tests.
Zeros and Maximum r-Values
Two additional aids to sketching graphs of polar equations involve knowing the 
-values for which 
is maximum and knowing the -values for which 
For
instance, in Example 1, the maximum value of 
for

12.7 Polar Equations of Conics
■Define conics in terms of eccentricity.
■Write and graph equations of conics in polar form.
■Use equations of conics in polar form to model real-life problems.
Alternative Definition of Conic
In Sections 12.2 and 12.3, you learned that the rectangular equations of ellipses and
hyperbolas take simple forms when the origin lies at their centers. As it happens, there
are many important applications of conics in which it is more convenient to use one
of the foci as the origin. In this section, you will learn that polar equations of conics
take simple forms if one of the foci lies at the pole.
To begin, consider the following alternative definition of conic that uses the 
concept of eccentricity.
In Figure 12.63, note that for each type of conic, the focus is at the pole.
Ellipse:
Parabola:
Hyperbola:
Figure 12.63
Polar Equations of Conics
The benefit of locating a focus of a conic at the pole is that the equation of the conic
takes on a simpler form. A proof of the polar form is given in Appendix A.

ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION OF CONIC
The locus of a point in the plane that moves so that its distance from a fixed
point (focus) is in a constant ratio to its distance from a fixed line (directrix)
is a conic. The constant ratio is the eccentricity of the conic and is denoted
by 
Moreover, the conic is an ellipse if 
a parabola if 
and a
hyperbola if

Moreover, the converse is also true—that is, any conic with a focus at the

equations.

Because 
the graph is a hyperbola. The transverse axis of the hyperbola lies
on the line

Because the
length of the transverse axis is 12, you can see that

Applications
Kepler’s Laws (listed below), named after the German astronomer Johannes Kepler
(1571–1630), can be used to describe the orbits of the planets about the sun.
1. Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus.
2. A ray from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas of the ellipse in equal
times.
3. The square of the period (the time it takes for a planet to orbit the sun) is
proportional to the cube of the mean distance between the planet and the sun.
Although Kepler simply stated these laws on the basis of observation, they were later
validated by Isaac Newton (1642–1727). In fact, Newton was able to show that each
law can be deduced from a set of universal laws of motion and gravitation that govern
the movement of all heavenly bodies, including comets and satellites. This is illustrated
in the next example, which involves the comet named after the English mathematician
and physicist Edmund Halley (1656–1742).
If you use Earth as a reference with a period of 1 year and a distance of 
1 astronomical unit (an 
is defined as the mean distance between
Earth and the sun, or about 93 million miles), the proportionality constant in Kepler’s
third law is 1. For example, because Mars has a mean distance to the sun of 
astronomical units, its period 
is given by 
So, the period of Mars is 
years.

Halley’s Comet
Halley’s comet has an elliptical orbit with an eccentricity of 
The length of
the major axis of the orbit is approximately 35.88 astronomical units. Find a polar 
equation for the orbit. How close does Halley’s comet come to the sun?
Solution
Using a vertical axis, as shown in Figure 12.67, choose an equation of the
form 
Because the vertices of the ellipse occur when 
and 
you can 
determine the length of the major axis to be the sum of the -values of the vertices.
That is,
So,
and 
Using this value of 
in the 
equation, you have
where 
is measured in astronomical units. To find the closest point to the sun (the
focus), substitute 
in this equation to obtain

Introduction
In Chapter 9, you studied techniques for solving right triangles. In this section and the
next, you will solve oblique triangles—triangles that have no right angles. As standard
notation, the angles of a triangle are labeled 
and 
and their opposite sides are
labeled 
and 
as shown in Figure 13.1.
To solve an oblique triangle, you need to know the measure of at least one side
and any two other measures of the triangle—either two sides, two angles, or one angle
and one side. This breaks down into the following four cases.
1. Two angles and any side (AAS or ASA)
2. Two sides and an angle opposite one of them (SSA)
3. Three sides (SSS)
4. Two sides and their included angle (SAS)
The first two cases can be solved using the Law of Sines, whereas the last two cases
require the Law of Cosines (see Section 13.2).

■Use Heron’s Area Formula to find the area of a triangle.
■Use the Law of Cosines to model and solve real-life problems.
Introduction
Two cases remain in the list of conditions needed to solve an oblique triangle—SSS
and SAS. If you are given three sides (SSS), or two sides and their included angle
(SAS), none of the ratios in the Law of Sines would be complete. In such cases, you
can use the Law of Cosines. See Appendix A for a proof of the Law of Cosines.
EXAMPLE

Three Sides of a Triangle—SSS
Find the three angles of the triangle in Figure 13.11.
Solution
It is a good idea first to find the angle opposite the longest side—side in
this case. Using the alternative form of the Law of Cosines, you find that 
Alternative form
Because 
is negative, you know that

At this point, it is simpler to use the Law of Sines to determine 
You know that

one obtuse angle. So,

the cosine of an angle, you can determine whether the angle is acute or obtuse. That is,

So, in Example 1, once you found that angle

acute also.

13.3 Vectors in the Plane
■Represent vectors as directed line segments.
■Write the component forms of vectors.
■Perform basic vector operations and represent them graphically.
■Write vectors as linear combinations of unit vectors.
■Find the direction angles of vectors.
■Use vectors to model and solve real-life problems.
Introduction
Quantities such as force and velocity cannot be completely characterized by a single
real number because they involve both magnitude and direction. To represent such a
quantity, you can use a directed line segment, as shown in Figure 13.17. The directed
line segment 
has initial point
and terminal point
Its magnitude (or length)
is denoted by 
and can be found using the Distance Formula.
Figure 13.17
Figure 13.18
Two directed line segments that have the same magnitude and direction are 
equivalent. For example, the directed line segments in Figure 13.18 are all equivalent. The
set of all directed line segments that are equivalent to the directed line segment 
is a vector v in the plane, written 
Vectors are denoted by lowercase, boldface
letters such as , , and .

Figure 13.19. Show that 
and are equivalent.
Solution
From the Distance Formula, it follows that 
and 
have the same 
magnitude.
Moreover, both line segments have the same direction because they are both directed
toward the upper right on lines having a slope of 
Because 
and 
have the same magnitude and direction,

Component Form of a Vector
The directed line segment whose initial point is the origin is often the most convenient
representative of a set of equivalent directed line segments. This representative of the
vector is in standard position, as shown in Figure 13.20.
A vector whose initial point is the origin 
can be uniquely represented by the
coordinates of its terminal point 
This is the component form of a vector v,
written as

Vector Operations
The two basic vector operations are scalar multiplication and vector addition. In
operations with vectors, numbers are usually referred to as scalars. In this text, scalars
will always be real numbers. Geometrically, the product of a vector and a scalar is
the vector that is 
times as long as . If is positive,
has the same direction as ,
and if is negative,
has the direction opposite that of , as shown in Figure 13.22.
To add two vectors 
and 
geometrically, first position them (without changing
their lengths or directions) so that the initial point of the second vector 
coincides
with the terminal point of the first vector 
The sum 
is the vector formed by
joining the initial point of the first vector 
with the terminal point of the second 
vector 
as shown in Figure 13.23. This technique is called the parallelogram law
for vector addition because the vector 
often called the resultant of vector 
addition, is the diagonal of a parallelogram having adjacent sides 
and 
Figure 13.23
The negative of 
is
Negative
and the difference of 
and is
Difference
To represent 
geometrically, you can use directed line segments with the same 
initial point. The difference 
is the vector from the terminal point of 
to the 
terminal point of , which is equal to 
as shown in Figure 13.24.

Unit vectors 
and 
called the standard unit vectors, are denoted by
as shown in Figure 13.26. (Note that the lowercase letters 
and 
are written in
boldface to distinguish them from scalars, variables, or the imaginary number
) These vectors can be used to represent any vector 
as shown.
The scalars 
and 
are called the horizontal and vertical components of 
respectively. The vector sum 
is called a linear combination of the vectors and 
Any vector in the plane can be
written as a linear combination of the standard unit vectors and

Using Vectors to Find Speed and Direction
An airplane is traveling at a speed of 500 miles per hour with a bearing of 
at a
fixed altitude with a negligible wind velocity as shown in Figure 13.32(a). When the
airplane reaches a certain point, it encounters a wind with a velocity of 70 miles per
hour in the direction 
as shown in Figure 13.32(b). What are the resultant
speed and direction of the airplane?
(a)
(b)
Figure 13.32
Solution
Using Figure 13.32, the velocity of the airplane (alone) is
and the velocity of the wind is
So, the velocity of the airplane (in the wind) is
and the resultant speed of the airplane is
miles per hour.
Finally, if is the direction angle of the flight path, you have
which implies that
So, the true direction of the airplane is approximately

The Dot Product of Two Vectors
So far you have studied two vector operations—vector addition and multiplication by
a scalar—each of which yields another vector. In this section, you will study a third 
vector operation, the dot product. This product yields a scalar, rather than a vector.
Proofs of Properties 1 and 4 are given in Appendix A.

Determining Orthogonal Vectors
Are the vectors 
and 
orthogonal?
Solution
Find the dot product of the two vectors.
Because the dot product is 0, the two vectors are by definition orthogonal (see Figure
13.36).
■
Finding Vector Components
You have already seen applications in which two vectors are added to produce a 
resultant vector. Many applications in physics and engineering pose the reverse 
problem—decomposing a given vector into the sum of two vector components.
Consider a boat on an inclined ramp, as shown in Figure 13.37. The force 
due
to gravity pulls the boat down the ramp and against the ramp. These two orthogonal
forces,
and 
are vector components of . That is,
Vector components of 
The negative of component 
represents the force needed to keep the boat from
rolling down the ramp, whereas 
represents the force that the tires must withstand
against the ramp.
From the definition of vector components, you can see that it is easy to find the 
component 
once you have found the projection of 
onto . To find the projection,
you can use the dot product.

Finding a Force
A 200-pound cart sits on a ramp inclined at 
as shown in Figure 13.40. What force
is required to keep the cart from rolling down the ramp?
Solution
Because the force due to gravity is vertical and downward, you can 
represent the gravitational force by the vector
Force due to gravity
To find the force required to keep the cart from rolling down the ramp, project 
onto
a unit vector in the direction of the ramp, as follows.
Unit vector along ramp
Therefore, the projection of 
onto is
The magnitude of this force is 100, and so a force of 100 pounds is required to keep
the cart from rolling down the ramp.

Trigonometric Form of a Complex Number
In Section 2.4, you learned how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex 
numbers. To work effectively with powers and roots of complex numbers, it is 
helpful to write complex numbers in trigonometric form. In Figure 13.45, consider the
nonzero complex number 
By letting be the angle from the positive real axis
(measured counterclockwise) to the line segment connecting the origin and the point

Consequently, you have

The trigonometric form of a complex number is used to raise a complex number to a

Roots of Complex Numbers
Recall that a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is that a
polynomial equation of degree 
has 
solutions in the complex number system. So,
the equation 
has six solutions, and in this particular case you can find the six
solutions by factoring and using the Quadratic Formula.
Consequently, the solutions are
and
Each of these numbers is a sixth root of 1. In general, an nth root of a complex 
number is defined as follows.
To find a formula for an th root of a complex number, let 
be an th root of 
where
and
By DeMoivre’s Theorem and the fact that 
you have
Taking the absolute value of each side of this equation, it follows that 
Substituting back into the previous equation and dividing by 
you get
So, it follows that
and
Because both sine and cosine have a period of 
these last two equations have 
solutions if and only if the angles differ by a multiple of 
Consequently, there must
exist an integer such that

they all lie on a circle of radius

Furthermore, because successive th roots have arguments that differ by 
the

GUILLAUME L’HÔPITAL (1661–1704)
L’Hôpital’s Rule is named after the French
mathematician Guillaume François Antoine de
L’Hôpital. L’Hôpital is credited with writing the
first text on differential calculus (in 1696) in
which the rule publicly appeared. It was
recently discovered that the rule and its proof
were written in a letter from John Bernoulli to
L’Hôpital. “… I acknowledge that I owe very
much to the bright minds of the Bernoulli
brothers. … I have made free use of their
discoveries …,” said L’Hôpital.

Occasionally it is necessary to apply L’Hôpital’s Rule more than once to remove
an indeterminate form, as shown in Example 3.
EXAMPLE
3
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule More Than Once
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution results in the indeterminate form 
you
can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
This limit yields the indeterminate form 
so you can apply L’Hôpital’s
Rule again to obtain
■
In addition to the forms 
and 
there are other indeterminate forms such
as 
and 
For example, consider the following four limits
that lead to the indeterminate form 
Limit is 1.
Limit is 2.
Limit is 0.
Limit is 
Because each limit is different, it is clear that the form 
is indeterminate in the
sense that it does not determine the value (or even the existence) of the limit. The 
following examples indicate methods for evaluating these forms. Basically, you
attempt to convert each of these forms to 
or 
so that L’Hôpital’s Rule can
be applied.
EXAMPLE
4
Indeterminate Form 0
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution produces the indeterminate form 
you
should try to rewrite the limit to fit the form 
or 
In this case, you can rewrite
the limit to fit the second form.

If rewriting a limit in one of the forms 
or 
does not seem to work, try
the other form. For instance, in Example 4 you can write the limit as
which yields the indeterminate form 
As it happens, applying L’Hôpital’s Rule to
this limit produces
which also yields the indeterminate form 
The indeterminate forms 
and 
arise from limits of functions that have
variable bases and variable exponents. When you previously encountered this type of
function, you used logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative. You can use a
similar procedure when taking limits, as shown in the next example.
EXAMPLE
5
Indeterminate Form 1
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution yields the indeterminate form 
you can 
proceed as follows. To begin, assume that the limit exists and is equal to 
Taking the natural logarithm of each side produces
Because the natural logarithmic function is continuous, you can write
Indeterminate form 
Indeterminate form

Now, because you have shown that 
you can conclude that

You can use a graphing utility to confirm this result, as shown in Figure B.1.

Because direct substitution yields the indeterminate form

quotients leading to the indeterminate forms

For instance, the
following application of L’Hôpital’s Rule is incorrect.
Incorrect use of L’Hôpital’s Rule
The reason this application is incorrect is that, even though the limit of the 
denominator is 0, the limit of the numerator is 1, which means that the hypotheses of
L’Hôpital’s Rule have not been satisfied.

The Disk Method
You have already learned that area is only one of the many applications of the definite
integral. Another important application is its use in finding the volume of a three-
dimensional solid. In this section you will study a particular type of three-dimensional
solid—one whose cross sections are similar. Solids of revolution are used commonly
in engineering and manufacturing. Some examples are axles, funnels, pills, bottles,
and pistons, as shown in Figure B.8.
If a region in the plane is revolved about a line, the resulting solid is a solid of
revolution, and the line is called the axis of revolution. The simplest such solid is a
right circular cylinder or disk, which is formed by revolving a rectangle about an axis
adjacent to one side of the rectangle, as shown in Figure B.9. The volume of such a
disk is
where 
is the radius of the disk and 
is the width.
To see how to use the volume of a disk to find the volume of a general solid of
revolution, consider a solid of revolution formed by revolving the plane region in
Figure B.10 about the indicated axis. To determine the volume of this solid, consider
a representative rectangle in the plane region. When this rectangle is revolved about
the axis of revolution, it generates a representative disk whose volume is 
Approximating the volume of the solid by 
such disks of width 
and radius

The Washer Method
The disk method can be extended to cover solids of revolution with holes by replac-
ing the representative disk with a representative washer. The washer is formed by
revolving a rectangle about an axis, as shown in Figure B.14. If and 
are the inner
and outer radii of the washer and 
is the width of the washer, the volume is given by
To see how this concept can be used to find the volume of a solid of revolution,
consider a region bounded by an outer radius
and an inner radius
as
shown in Figure B.15. If the region is revolved about its axis of revolution, the vol-
ume of the resulting solid is given by
Note that the integral involving the inner radius represents the volume of the hole and
is subtracted from the integral involving the outer radius.

Manufacturing
A manufacturer drills a hole through the center of a metal sphere of radius 5 inches,
as shown in Figure B.19(a). The hole has a radius of 3 inches. What is the volume of
the resulting metal ring?
Solution
You can imagine the ring to be generated by a segment of the circle whose
equation is 
as shown in Figure B.19(b). Because the radius of the hole is 3 inches, you can let
and solve the equation 
to determine that the limits of integration

■
The Shell Method
Now you will study an alternative method for finding the volume of a solid of 
revolution. This method is called the shell method because it uses cylindrical shells. 
To begin, consider a representative rectangle as shown in Figure B.20, where 
is
the width of the rectangle,
is the height of the rectangle, and 
is the distance
between the axis of revolution and the center of the rectangle. When this rectangle is
revolved about its axis of revolution, it forms a cylindrical shell (or tube) of thickness
To find the volume of this shell, consider two cylinders. The radius of the larger
cylinder corresponds to the outer radius of the shell, and the radius of the smaller
cylinder corresponds to the inner radius of the shell. Because 
is the average radius
of the shell, you know the outer radius is 
and the inner radius is

You can use this formula to find the volume of a solid of revolution. Assume that
the plane region in Figure B.21 is revolved about a line to form the indicated solid. If
you consider a horizontal rectangle of width 
then, as the plane region is revolved 
about a line parallel to the axis, the rectangle generates a representative shell whose
volume is
You can approximate the volume of the solid by such shells of thickness 
height
and average radius 
This approximation appears to become better and better as

Work Done by a Variable Force
If a variable force is applied to an object, calculus is needed to determine the work
done, because the amount of force changes as the object changes position. For instance,
the force required to compress a spring increases as the spring is compressed.
Suppose that an object is moved along a straight line from 
to 
by a
continuously varying force 
Let 
be a partition that divides the interval 
into subintervals determined by
and let 
For each choose 
such that 
Then at 
the
force is given by 
Because 
is continuous, you can approximate the work done
in moving the object through the th subinterval by the increment
as shown in Figure B.25. So, the total work done as the object moves from 
to 
is
approximated by
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
So, the
work done is
The remaining examples in this section use some well-known physical laws. The
discoveries of many of these laws occurred during the same period in which calculus
was being developed. In fact, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there
was little difference between physicists and mathematicians. One such physicist-
mathematician was Emilie de Breteuil. Breteuil was instrumental in synthesizing the
work of many other scientists, including Newton, Leibniz, Huygens, Kepler, and
Descartes. Her physics text 
was widely used for many years.

The following three laws of physics were developed by Robert Hooke
(1635–1703), Isaac Newton (1642–1727), and Charles Coulomb (1736–1806).
1. Hooke’s Law: The force 
required to compress or stretch a spring (within its
elastic limits) is proportional to the distance 
that the spring is compressed or
stretched from its original length. That is,
where the constant of proportionality 
(the spring constant) depends on the
specific nature of the spring.
2. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation: The force 
of attraction between two
particles of masses 
and 
is proportional to the product of the masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
between the two particles.
That is,
If 
and 
are given in grams and in centimeters,
will be in dynes for a value
of 
cubic centimeter per gram-second squared.
3. Coulomb’s Law: The force 
between two charges 
and 
in a vacuum is
proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between the two charges. That is,
If 
and 
are given in electrostatic units and in centimeters,
will be in dynes
for a value of 
EXAMPLE

Compressing a Spring
A force of 750 pounds compresses a spring 3 inches from its natural length of 
15 inches. Find the work done in compressing the spring an additional 3 inches.
Solution
By Hooke’s Law, the force 
required to compress the spring 
units
(from its natural length) is 
Using the given data, it follows that 
and so 
and 
as shown in Figure B.26. To find the
increment of work, assume that the force required to compress the spring over a small
increment 
is nearly constant. So, the increment of work is
Because the spring is compressed from 
to 
inches less than its natural
length, the work required is

Note that you do 
integrate from

determine the work done in compressing the spring an

EXAMPLE 10 Moving a Space Module into Orbit
A space module weighs 15 metric tons on the surface of Earth. How much work is
done in propelling the module to a height of 800 miles above Earth, as shown in
Figure B.27? (Use 4000 miles as the radius of Earth. Do not consider the effect of air
resistance or the weight of the propellant.)
Solution
Because the weight of a body varies inversely as the square of its distance
from the center of Earth, the force 
exerted by gravity is
is the constant of proportionality.
Because the module weighs 15 metric tons on the surface of Earth and the radius of
Earth is approximately 4000 miles, you have
So, the increment of work is

to 
miles, the total

EXAMPLE 11 Emptying a Tank of Oil
A spherical tank of radius 8 feet is half full of oil that weighs 50 pounds per cubic
foot. Find the work required to pump oil out through a hole in the top of the tank.
Solution
Consider the oil to be subdivided into disks of thickness 
and radius 
as shown in Figure B.28. Because the increment of force for each disk is given by its
weight, you have
For a circle of radius 8 and center at 
you have
and you can write the force increment as
In Figure B.28, note that a disk 
feet from the bottom of the tank must be moved a
distance of 
feet. So, the increment of work is
Because the tank is half full,
ranges from 0 to 8, and the work required to empty the
tank is
■
To estimate the reasonableness of the result in Example 11, consider that the
weight of the oil in the tank is
Lifting the entire half-tank of oil 8 feet would involve work of 
foot-pounds. Because the oil is actually lifted between 8 and 16 feet, it seems reasonable
that the work done is 589,782 foot-pounds.

A 20-foot chain weighing 5 pounds per foot is lying coiled on the ground. How much
work is required to raise one end of the chain to a height of 20 feet so that it is fully
extended, as shown in Figure B.29?
Solution
Imagine that the chain is divided into small sections, each of length 
Then the weight of each section is the increment of force
Because a typical section (initially on the ground) is raised to a height of

135. (a) and (b)
(c) Answers will vary. Sample answer:
(d) Answers will vary. Sample answer: The 
intercept 
indicates that in 2000 there were 44.9 thousand doctors of
osteopathic medicine. The slope means that the number of
doctors increases by 2.39 thousand each year.
(e) The model is accurate.
(f) Answers will vary. Sample answer: 73.6 thousand
137. False. The slope with the greatest magnitude corresponds to the
steepest line.
139. Find the distance between each two points and use the
Pythagorean Theorem.
141. No. The slope cannot be determined without knowing the scale
on the -axis. The slopes could be the same.
143. c
145. The line 
rises most quickly, and the line 
falls
most quickly. The greater the magnitude of the slope (the
absolute value of the slope), the faster the line rises or falls.
147. No. The slopes of two perpendicular lines have opposite signs
(assume that neither line is vertical or horizontal).

99. (a)
(b) The graph touches the 
axis at 
(c) The least possible degree of the function is 4, because there
are at least four real zeros (1 is repeated) and a 
function can have at most the number of real zeros equal to
the degree of the function. The degree cannot be odd by the
definition of multiplicity.
(d) Positive. From the information in the table, it can be 
concluded that the graph will eventually rise to the left and
rise to the right.

111. False. The most complex zeros it can have is two, and the
Linear Factorization Theorem guarantees that there are three
linear factors, so one zero must be real.

(e) Sample answer: No. You might expect the average speed for
the round trip to be the average of the average speeds for the
two parts of the trip.
(f) No. At 20 miles per hour you would use more time in one
direction than is required for the round trip at an average
speed of 50 miles per hour.
85. False. Polynomials do not have vertical asymptotes.
87. False. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of
the denominator, no horizontal asymptote exists. However, a
slant asymptote exists only if the degree of the numerator is one
greater than the degree of the denominator.
