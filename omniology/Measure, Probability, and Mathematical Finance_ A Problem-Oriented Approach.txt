PREFACE 
Mathematical finance, a new branch of mathematics concerned with financial mar-
kets, is experiencing rapid growth. During the last three decades, many books and 
papers in the area of mathematical finance have been published. However, under-
standing the literature requires that the reader have a good background in measure-
theoretic probability, stochastic processes, and stochastic calculus. The purpose of 
this book is to provide the reader with an introduction to the mathematical theory 
underlying the financial models being used and developed on Wall Street. To this 
end, this book covers important concepts and results in measure theory, probabil-
ity theory, stochastic processes, and stochastic calculus so that the reader will be in 
a position to understand these financial models. Problems as well as solutions are 
included to help the reader learn the concepts and results quickly. 
In this book, we adopted the definitions and theorems from various books and 
presented them in a mathematically rigorous way. We tried to cover the most of the 
basic concepts and the important theorems. We selected the problems in this book 
in such a way that the problems will help readers understand and know how to apply 
the concepts and theorems. This book includes 516 problems, most of which are not 
difficult and can be solved by applying the definitions, theorems, and the results of 
previous problems. 
This book is organized into five parts, each of which is further organized into sev-
eral chapters. Each chapter is divided into five sections. The first section presents

PREFACE 
the definitions of important concepts and theorems. The second, third, and fourth 
sections present the problems, hints on how to solve the problems, and the full so-
lutions to the problems, respectively. The last section contains bibliographic notes. 
Interdependencies between all chapters are shown in Table 0.1.

In Part I, we present measure theory, which is indispensable to the rigorous de-
velopment of probability theory. Measure theory is also necessary for us to discuss 
recently developed theories and models in finance, such as the martingale measures, 
the change of numeraire theory, and the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) 
market models. 
In Part II, we present probability theory in a measure-theoretic mathematical 
framework, which was introduced by A.N. Kolmogorov in 1937 in order to deal 
with David Hilbert's sixth problem. The material presented in this part was selected 
to facilitate the development of stochastic processes in Part III. 
In Part III, we present stochastic processes, which include martingales and Brow-
nian motion. In Part IV, we discuss stochastic calculus. Both stochastic processes 
and stochastic calculus are important to modem mathematical finance as they are 
used to model asset prices and develop derivative pricing models. 
In Part V, we present some classic models in mathematical finance. Many pricing 
models have been developed and published since the seminal work of Black and 
Scholes. This part covers only a small portion of many models. 
In this book, we tried to use a uniform set of symbols and notation. For example, 
we used N, R, and 0 to denote the set of natural numbers (i.e., nonnegative integers),

the set of real numbers, and the empty set, respectively. A comprehensive list of 
symbols is also provided at the end of this book. 
We have taken great pains to ensure the accuracy of the formulas and statements 
in this book. However, a few errors are inevitable in almost every book of this size.

gestions. 
How to Use This Book 
This book can be used by individuals in various ways: 
(a) It can be used as a self-study book on mathematical finance. The prerequisite is 
linear algebra and calculus at the undergraduate level. This book will provide 
you with a series of concepts, facts, and problems. You should explore each 
problem and write out your solution in such a way that it can be shared with 
others. By doing this you will be able to actively develop an in-depth and com-
prehensive understanding of the concepts and principles that cannot be archived 
by passively reading or listening to comments of others. 
(b) It can be used as a reference book. This book contains the most important 
concepts and theorems from mathematical finance. The reader can find the 
definition of a concept or the statement of a theorem in the book through the 
index at the end of this book. 
(c) It can be used as a supplementary book for individuals who take advanced 
courses in mathematical finance. This book starts with measure theory and 
builds up to stochastic financial models. It provides necessary prerequisites for 
students who take advanced courses in mathematical finance without complet-
ing background courses.

PART I 
MEASURE THEORY 


CHAPTER 1 
SETS AND SEQUENCES 
Sets are the most basic concepts in measure theory as well as in mathematics. In fact, 
set theory is a foundation of mathematics (Moschovakis, 2006). The algebra of sets 
develops the fundamental properties of set operations and relations. In this chapter, 
we shall introduce basic concepts about sets and some set operations such as union, 
intersection, and complementation. We will also introduce some set relations such 
as De Morgan's laws. 
1.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 1.1 (Set, Subset, and Empty Set). A set is a collection of objects, which 
are called elements. A set B is said to be a subset of a set A, written as B ~ A, if 
the elements of Bare also elements of A. A set A is called an empty set, denoted by 
0, if A contains no elements. 
Definition 1.2 (Countable Set). A set A is said to be countable if either A contains 
a finite number of elements or every element of A appears in an infinite sequence 
x 1, x2 , .... A set A is said to be uncountable if it is not countable.

The complement of A relative to S is defined as 
Ac = {s E S: s tf_ A}. 
Definition 1.5 (Difference and Symmetric Difference of Sets). Let A and B be two 
sets. The difference between A and B, denoted by A~ B or A\B, is defined as 
The symmetric difference between A and B is defined as 
A~B = (A\B) U (B\A). 
Definition 1.6 (Increasing and Decreasing Sequence of Sets). Let {An}n:::: 1 be a 
sequence of sets. We say that { An}n>l is an increasing sequence of sets with limit 
A, written as An t A, if 
(a) An l:: An+l for all n 2 1. 
(b) U~=l An = A. 
We say that {An }n>l is a decreasing sequence of sets with limit A, written as An .j._ 
A, if 
(a) An :2 An+l for all n 2 1. 
(b) n~= 1 An =A.

A is defined as

SETS AND SEQUENCES 
1.3 Hints 
1.1. Try to construct a sequence in which every element in A appears. 
1.2. To prove part (a), show that all rational numbers can be written as a sequence. 
Part (b) can be proved by the method of contradiction, that is, by assuming that R is 
countable and can be written as a sequence (xn)n2:l· Then represent every Xn as a 
decimal of finite digits and find a new number, which is not in the sequence. 
1.3. This problem can be proved by using Definition 1.8. 
1.4. This problem can be proved by using Definition 1.8 and Theorem 1.1. 
1.5. An indicator function has only two possible values: 0 and 1. Hence the first 
equality of the problem can be proved by considering two cases: 8 E lim sup En and 
8 ¢:_ lim sup En. The second equality of the problem can be proved using the result 
of Problem 1.4. 
1.6. The lower and upper limits of the sequence can be calculated by using Defini-
tion 1.8. 
1. 7. Use the definition of limits. For example, limn-+oo Xn = oo if and only if, given 
any E > 0, there exists an integer N< such that Xn > E for all n 2:: N<. Similarly, 
limn-+oo Xn = L for some L E ( -oo, oo) if and only if, given any E > 0, there 
exists an integer N< such that L- E < Xn < L + E for all n ::::: N<. 
1.8. Use Definition 1.9 and the fact that supn>m( -xn) = - infn>m Xn to prove 
part (a). To prove part (b), try to establish 
-
sup Xi 2:: inf Xn, 
j, m 2:: 1.

To prove part (c), try to establish the following inequality 
inf Xn+infyi :Ssupinf(xr+Yr)·

Use parts (a) and (c) to prove part (d). Use parts (a) and (d) to prove part (e). Use 
part (c) to prove part (f). Use parts (a) and (f) to prove part (g). 
1.9. Use Definition 1.11 and the results of Problems 1.5 and 1. 7. 
1.10. Use the results of Problems 1. 7 and 1.8. 
1.4 Solutions 
1.1. Since I is countable, then { Ai : i E I} is countable. Note that Ai is countable 
for each i E I. There exists a sequence (Bn)n2l of countable sets such that every 

SOLUTIONS 
9 
Ai appears in the sequence. For each integer n 2': 1, as Bn is countable, there exists 
a sequence (xn,m)m~l such that every element of Bn appears in the sequence. Now 
let (Yi)i~l be a sequence given by 
Then every element in A appears in the sequence (yi)i>l· Hence A is countable. 
This completes the proof. 
1.2. 
(a) For each integer n 2': 0, let 
An= {r E Q: n:::; r:::; n + 1}, 
Bn = {r E Q: -n- 1:::; r:::; -n}. 
Then 
00 
Q = U (An U Bn)· 
n=O 
By Problem 1.1, it is sufficient to show that An and Bn are countable for each 
integern 2': 0. NotethatAn = {r+n: r E A0 }andBn = {r-n-1: r E A0}. 
We only need to show that A0 is countable. 
Let (xn)n;::: 1 be a sequence given by 
1 1 2 1 2 3 
o, 1' 2' 3' 3' 4' 4' 4' .... 
Then every number in A0 appears in the sequence. Hence Q is countable. 
(b) Assume that R is countable. Then the subset (0, 1] ofR is also countable. Let 
the numbers in (0, 1] be written as a sequence (xn)n~l· Since Xn E (0, 1], we 
can represent Xn as a decimal 
O.zn,1Zn,2 ... ' 
where Zn,j is one ofthe 10 digits. The decimal representation is not unique for 
some numbers. For example, we have 
00 
9 
o.1 = o.o999 ... = 2::: 1Qi+l. 
j=l 
In such cases, we choose the representation with 9s at the end. Now let y = 
w1 w2 · · · be a decimal given by 
Wj = {7, 
2, 
if Zj,j :::; 5; 
if Zj,j > 5. 

1 0 
SETS AND SEQUENCES 
Since w1 i=- 9 and Wj i=- z1,1 for all j 2 1, we have y i=- Xn for all n 2 1. But 
the sequence (xn)n;:: 1 includes all numbers in (0, 1]. Hence y = Xn 0 for some 
n 0 . This is a contradiction. Hence R is uncountable. 
This completes the proof. 
1.3. Lets E liminf En. Then by Definition 1.8, we haves En.>. Ei for some 
~_Jo 
j 0 2 1. It follows that s E Ei for all i 2 j 0 . Hence we have 
S E Emax{j,jo} c:;;; U Ei 
i::Cj 
for all j 2 1. Consequently, s E lim sup En. Therefore, lim inf En c:;;; lim sup En. 
1.4. By Definition 1.8 and Theorem 1.1, we have 
(limsupEnt 
(Q (Yo E,))' ,Y, (Yo E,)' 
U (n Ef) = liminf E~. 
">1 
i>. 
)_ 
_) 
Similarly, we can show that (lim inf Ent = lim sup E~. 
1.5. To prove ( 1.1), we consider two cases: 8 E lim sup En and 8 ~ lim sup En. If 
8 E lim sup En, then 
which implies 
8 E n U En, 
s E U En, vm 2 1. 
n::Cm 
Thus s E En for infinitely many n. Hence we have 
sup hn(s) = 1, vm:::: 1, 
n2:m, 
which gives 
If s ~ lim sup En, then s E En for only finitely many n. Thus we have 
sup h,(.s) = 0, vm 2 Mo, 
n2:m 
where A10 is a sufficient large number. Hence we have 
inf sup IEn(s) = 0. 
m::Cl n::Cm 

SOLUTIONS 
11 
Therefore (1.1) is true. From (1.1) and noting that IE(s) = 1 -lEe (s), we have 
lnminf En (s) = 1- fnmsupE:; (s) = 1 -lim sup IE:; (s) = liminf lEn (s). 
Thus (1.2) holds. 
1.6. 
To find liminf An, we first need to calculate ni:2:i Ai for all j ~ 1. To do 
that, we let Bn = A2n-l and Cn = A2n for n = 1, 2, .... Then Bn and Cn are 
decreasing, and we have 
n 
Bn = [0,1] 
n:2:k 
and 
n 
Cn = (-1,0] 
n:2:k 
for all k ~ 1. Thus ni:2:i Ai = 
{ 0} for all j > 1. Hence lim inf An 
{ 0}. 
Similarly, we have lim sup An = ( -1, 1]. 
1.7. 
We first prove the "only if' part. Suppose that limn-+= Xn exists. Let L = 
limn-+= Xn and E > 0. If L = -oo, then there exists an N< ~ 1 such that Xn < -E 
for all n ~ N<. Hence 
inf sup Xn ~ sup ~ -E. 
m:2:1n;:::m 
n;;::N, 
Letting E ---+ oo in the above equation gives limsupxn 
-oo, which implies 
lim sup Xn = lim inf Xn = -oo. Similarly, we can show that 
lim sup Xn :;:= lim inf Xn 
for -oo < L < oo and L = oo. Now we prove the "if" part. Suppose that 
lim sup Xn = lim inf Xn = L and let E > 0. If -oo < L < 00, then SUPn>m, Xn ~ 
L + E for some m1 ~ 1 and infn>m2 Xn ~ L -
E for some m2 ~ 1. Therefore, we 
have 
L-E~Xn~L+E, n~max(m1,m2). 
Since this is true for every E > 0, limn-+= Xn exists and is equal to L. Similarly, we 
can show that limn-+= Xn exists for L = -oo and L = oo.

lim inf(c + Xn) - c =lim inf(c + Xn) +lim inf( -c) :::; lim inf Xn. 
It follows that c + lim inf Xn = lim inf ( c + .Tn).

(g) From parts (a) and (f) of this proof, we have 
liminf(c- Xn) = c + liminf( -xn) = c -limsupxn. 
This finishes the proof. 
1.9. First, we prove the "if" part. Suppose that lim sup An = lim inf An. Then by 
Problem 1.5, we have lim infi An ( s) = lim sup IAn ( s) for all s E S. It follows that 
lim I An ( s) exists for all s E S. Hence limn-+oo An exists. 
Next, we prove the "only if" part. Suppose that limn-+oo An exists. Then by 
definition, we have limn-+oo I An ( s) exists for all s E S. It follows that 
for all s E S. By Problem 1.5, we have hm sup An ( s) = hm inf An ( s) for all s E S. 
Therefore, lim sup An = lim inf An. By Problem 1.5, we have 
lim IAn (s) =lim sup IAn (s) = liminf IAn (s)

hmsupAn(s) = luminfAn(s),

Hence A = lim sup An = lim inf An. 
1.10. Since limn-+oo Xn and limn-+oo Yn exist, it follows from Problem 1.7 that 
and 
lim Xn = lim inf Xn = lim SUp Xn 
n-+oo 
lim Yn = lim inf Yn = lim sup Yn. 
n-+oo 
Then by parts (c) and (d) of Problem 1.8, we have 
which shows that 
lim inf(xn + Yn)

limsupxn + limsupyn 
> limsup(xn + Yn), 
limsup(xn + Yn) = liminf(xn + Yn) = lim Xn + lim Yn· 
n-+oo

This completes the proof. 
1.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced some concepts in set theory as well as some set opera-
tions and relations. For further information about these concepts, readers are referred

to Papoulis (1991), Williams (1991), Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999), Jacod and Prot-
ter (2004), and Reitano (2010). 
We also introduced some concepts related to sequences of real numbers, which are 
connected to sequences of sets via indicator functions. The properties of sequences 
of real numbers and sets are frequently used in later chapters. 
Zorn's lemma is an axiom of set theory and is equivalent to the axiom of choice. 
For a proof of the equivalence, readers are referred to Vaught (1995, p80), Dudley 
(2002, p20), and Moschovakis (2006, pll4). 

CHAPTER2 
MEASURES 
Measurable sets are to measure theory as open sets are to topology (Williams, 1991). 
Measures are set functions defined on measurable sets. These concepts are used later 
to define integration. In this chapter, we shall introduce measurable sets, measures, 
and other relevant concepts such as algebras and u-algebras. 
2.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 2.1 (Algebra). An algebra or field I:0 on S is a collection of subsets of S 
that satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) S E I:o. 
(b) IfF E I:o, then pc E I:0, where pc = S\F. 
(c) IfF E I:o and G E I:o, then F U G E I:o. 
Definition 2.2 (u-Algebra). A collection I: of subsets of Sis called au-algebra or 
u-field if I: is an algebra on S and is closed under countably infinite unions; that is, 
Measure, Probability, and Mathematical Finance.

Definition 2.3 (Measurable Space and Measurable Set). A measurable space is a 
pair (S, E), where Sis a set and Eisa a-algebra on S. A subset C of Sis said to be 
E-measurable if C E E. 
Definition 2.4 (Generated a-Algebra). Let C be a collection of subsets of a setS.

(b) IfF, G E T, then F n G E T. 
(c) If Fi E T for all i E J, then uiEI Fi E T, where I is an index set (finite, 
countable, or uncountable). 
A topological space is a pair ( S, T) where S is a nonempty set and Tis a topology 
in S. For simplicity, we classify S as a topological space if Tis evident or does not 
need an explicit name. The elements ofT are called open sets inS. 
Definition 2.6 (Borel a-Algebra). The Borel a-algebra B(S) on a topological space 
Sis the a-algebra generated by the collection of open sets inS. The Borel a-algebra 
on the real lineR is denoted by B, and the sets in Bare called Borel sets. If E E B, 
then B(E) denotes the a-algebra {An E: A E B}. 
Definition 2.7 (Borel Measure). A Borel measure is a measure defined on a Borel 
a-algebra. 
Definition 2.8 (Finitely Additive and Countably Additive Set Function). Let S be a

(b) IfF, G E Eo and F n G = 0, then J.Lo(F U G) = J.Lo(F) + J.Lo(G). 
The set function J.Lo is called countably additive if it satisfies the following condi-
tions: 
(a) J.Lo(0) = 0.

statement about points in S is said to be true a.e. if the measure of the set of points 
for which the statement is false is zero, that is 
F = { s : the statement about s is false} E I: 
and JL( F) = 0.

2.3 Hints 
2.1. Consider how many subsets contain zero elements, how many subsets contain 
one elements, and so forth. The sum of those numbers is the number of elements in 
25 . Use Definition 2.2 to show that 25 is a a-algebra. 
2.2. 
To show that C is not an algebra, one can try to find two sets A, B E C but 
An B tf_ C. If Cis indeed an algebra, then An B = (Ac U Bc)c E C. To make sure 
that An B tf_ C, one needs to show that the sequence 
i{k: 1:::; k:::; m; 
k E AnB}I 
rm= ~--------------------~ 
m 
has no limits; that is, lim sup r m -1- lim inf r m. 
2.3. Consider simple cases when n = 1, 2, 3, and then consider the general case. 
2.4. Use the standard technique to show that a(C) = B; that is, show that a(C) ~ B 
and B ~ a( C). 
2.5. Use Definition 2.2. 
2.6. Use Definitions 2.2, 2.16, and 2.15.

2.13. Write U~=l An as a union of n mutually disjoint sets. 
2.14. Since A1 , A2 , ... are pairwise disjoint, we have 
Use the above inequality to prove the inequality in question. 
2.15. Try to construct a sequence of sets A1 , A2 , ... such that lim sup An = 0 and 
J,L(An) =f. 0 for all n ~ 1. 
2.16. Use Definition 2.15 to show that I is a 1r-system and use the standard tech-
nique to show that a(I) = a(g, 1-l)[(i.e., a(I) 2 a(g, 1-l) and a(I) ~ a(Q, 1-l)]. 
2.17. Note that if limn~oo An = A, then lim inf An = lim sup An = A. 
2.18. Use Theorem 2.1. 
2.19. Write U:1 Gi as a union of pairwise disjoint sets and utilize the fact that 1-L is 
countably additive. 
2.20. Use the method of contradiction; that is, suppose that there are uncountably 
many disjoint sets A E E such that J,L(A) > 0. Then show that 1-L is infinity. 
2.4 Solutions 
2.1. Let n = lSI. Since Sis finite, we haven < oo. In addition, we can classify the 
subsets of Sinton+ 1 groups 90 , 9 1 , ... , 9n. where gi (0:::; i:::; n) is the group of 
subsets containing i elements. Then U~=l gi = 28 , and gin gi = 0 for all i =f. j. 
Hence we have 128 1 = L~=O l9il· But l9il = ( i ), so we have 128 1 = 2n < oo. 
By definition of 28 , we haveS E 28 . IfF E 28, then F ~ S, which leads to 
Fe= S\F ~Sand FeE 28 . If Fn E 28 for n ~ 1, then Fn ~ S for n ~ 1. Let 

22 
MEASURES 
X E u:=1 Fn. Then X E Fno for some no ?: 1. But Fno ~ S, we have XES. Thus 
U:=1 Fn ~ S, which gives U:=1 Fn E 28 . Therefore, 28 is a £T-algebra. 
2.2. To show that C is not an algebra, we only need to find two sets A, B E C but 
An B ¢:.C. To do this, we divide N into the following mutually disjoint intervals Ji 
and Ij fori= 0, 1, 2, ... ,where 10 = {1, 2}, J0 = {3, 4}, and 
h=(2·2k,3·2k]nN, 
Jk=(3·2\2·2k+l]nN, Vk?:l. 
Then lhl = 2k and IJkl = 2k for all k?: 1. We define A and Bas 
00 
A= u 
(JZ u JZ) 
k=O 
and 
00 
B= U(IZUJk), 
k=O 
respectively, where IZ is the set of all even numbers in h and Ik is the set of all odd 
numbers in h for all k ?: 0, JZ and Jk are defined similarly. Then we have 
00 
AnB = U IZ. 
k=O 
Now we claim that A, BE C and An B ¢:_C. Since 
l{k: 1:::; k:::; m;

2.3. The upper bound of I~ I is 2N, where N = 2n - 1. The upper bound can be 
attained when B1, B2, ... , BN are all nonempty, where 
for i = 1, 2, ... , N and h, I2, ... , IN are nonempty, distinct subsets of { 1, 2, ... , 
n}. 
The sets B1, B2, ... , BN are pairwise disjoint but may contain empty sets. One 
can use the standard technique (i.e., A ~ B and B ~ A imply A = B) to show that 
~ = a(B1,B2, ... ,BN)· 
When B1, B2, ... , BN are all nonempty, we have~ = 2{B1 ,B2 , ..• ,BN} and 1~1 = 
2N. 
Now we show that such upper bound is attainable. LetS= {0, 1, 2, ... , 2n - 1} 
and Ai = {s E S: s = f3I + /322 + · · · + f3n2n-I, f3k E {0, 1} fork=/= i, f3i = 0} 
fori = 1, 2, ... , n. Then Bi = {LjEif 21-l} for If =/= 0 and Bi = {0} for If = 0. 
Hence B1, B2, ... , BN are all nonempty. In this case, we have 1~1 = 2N. 
2.4. Since 
(-oo,c] = ft ( 
-oo,c+ ~), \fc E R, 
we have C ~B. Note that B is a a-algebra, we have a( C) ~B. 
Now we show that every open subset 0 of R is in a(C). Note that 0 is a finite or 
countable union of open intervals, we only need to show that 
(a, b) E a( C), 
\fa, bE R with a< b. 
But 
(a, b)= ( -oo, b) n ( -oo, ar = (Ql ( 
-oo, b- ~]) n( -oo, a]c, 
we have (a, b) E a( C). Thus we have B ~a( C). Therefore, B =a( C). 
Other implications can be proved by similar arguments. 

24 
MEASURES 
2.5. Since C E L, we have C E C. Let BE C. Then B =An C for some A E L. 
Thus we have C\B = C n Be = C n Ae E C, where the complement is taken 
relative to S. Now let Bn E C for n 2': 1. Then Bn = Ann C for some An E L. But 
U~= 1 Bn = U~= 1 (Ann C) = (U~=l An) n C, so we have U~= 1 Bn E C. Hence 
C is a cr -algebra over C. 
2.6. The necessity part is trivial. To prove the sufficiency, we assume that L is both 
a 1r-system and a d-system. From the assumption L is a d-system, we have S E L. 
IfF E L, then Fe= S\F E L, since F,S ELand F ~ S. If F,G E L, then 
FUG = (Fe nGe)e E L, since Lis a 1r-system and d-system. Let Fn E L (n EN) 
and An= U~=l Fi. Then An~ An+l and Ant U:1 Fi. By assumption, we have 
U:1 Fi E L. Thus, Lis a cr-algebra. 
2.7. 
From Problem 2.6, we know that cr(I) is a d-system. Note that as d(I) is 
the intersection of all d-systems containing I, we have d(I) ~ cr(I). To prove 
cr(I) ~ d(I), we only need to show that d(I) is a cr-algebra. From Problem 2.6, we 
only need to show that d(I) is a 1r-system. 
Let D1 ={DE d(I) : D n IE d(I), VIE I}, then D1 ~ d(I). We claim that 
D1 is a d-system on I. Since I is a 1r-system, we have I ~ D1. Let A, B E D1 and 
A~ B; then 
(B\A) n I= (B n I) n (Ae U Ie) = (B n I)\(A n I) E d(I), 
VIE I, 
since Ani, Bni E d(I) for all IE I and d(I) is ad-system. Thus B\A E D1. Let 
An E D1 and Ant A, then AnnIE d(I) and Ann It An I for all IE I. Since 
d(I) is ad-system, we have An IE d(I) (VIE I), which leads to A E D1. Thus 
D1 is ad-system on I. Note that d(I) is the intersection of all d-systems containing 
I, so we have d(I) ~ D1. Hence we have D1 = d(I). 
Let D2 = { D E d(I) : D n J E d(I), V J E d(I)}. We claim that D2 is also ad-
system on I. Since D1 = d(I), we have I~ D2. Let A, B E D2 and A~ B, then 
(B\A) n J = (B n J)\(A n J) E d(I) for all J E d(I), since B n J, An J E d(I) 
for all J E d(I) and d(I) is ad-system. Thus we have B\A E D2. Let An E D2 
and An t A, then Ann J E d(I) and Ann J t An J for all J E d(I). Since 
d(I) is ad-system, we have An J E d(I) for all J E d(I), which gives A E D2. 
Therefore, D2 is ad-system on I. Hence we have d(I) ~ D2. By definition, we 
have D2 ~ d(I). So we have D2 = d(I), which means that In J E d(I) for all 
I, J E d(I). Therefore d(I) is a 1r-system. 
2.8. We only need to show that D satisfies the conditions in Definition 2.16. Since 
p 1(S) = p2(S), we haveS E D. Let A,B E D and A ~ B; then we have 
A, BEL, p1(A) = p2(A) < oo, and pl(B) = p2(B) < oo, which lead to 
JLI(B\A) = JL1(B)- JLl(A) = JL2(B)- JL2(A) = JL2(B\A). 
Thus B\A ED. To check the last item, let Fn ED and Fn t F. Then by Theorem 
2.1, we have 
Jll (F) = lim Jll (Fn) = lim JL2(Fn) = JL2(F).

Hence, 1J is a d-system. 
2.9. Let Bj = ni~j Ai for j = 1, 2, .... Since :Eisa a--algebra and Ai E :E for all 
i 2: 1, we have Ai E :E for all i 2: 1 and thus Bj = ( Ui~j Ai) e E :E for all j 2: 1. 
Note that liminf An= Uj~l Bj, we have liminf An E :E. Similarly, we can show 
that lim sup An E :E. 
Now we show that lim inf An ~ lim sup An. Let s E lim inf An. Then s E 
ni~jo Ai for some jo E N; that is, s E Ai for all i 2: jo. Consequently, we have 
s E Ui~j Ai for all j 2: 1. By definition, we have s E lim sup An. Therefore, 
lim inf An ~ lim sup An. 
2.10. Since ISel = 101 = 0 < oo, we haveS E :E0 • Let A E :E0 . Then A is finite 
or A e is finite. In both cases, we have A e E :E0 • Now let A, B E :E0 . If both A and 
Bare finite, then AU B is finite and thus AU B E :E0 . If at least one of A and B is 
infinite, then (AU BY = Ae n Be is finite and thus AU B E :E0 . Hence :E0 is an 
algebra. 
Now we show that :E0 is not a a--algebra. Since Sis infinite, we can find an infinite 
subset B = {b1, b2, ... } of S. Let An = {b2n-d for all n 2: 1. Then An E :Eo for 
all n 2: 1. But A= U:'=1 An is infinite and N is also infinite. Therefore A tf. :E0 . 
Let A, B E :E0 and An B = 0. We claim that at most one of A and B can be infinite. 
If both A and B are infinite, then A e and Be are finite, which contradicts A e U Be = 
S. If both A and B are finite, then llo(A U B) = 0 = llo(A) + llo(B). If one of 
A and B is infinite and the other is finite, then llo(A U B) = 1 = llo(A) + llo(B). 
Hence /lo is finitely additive. 
Since Sis countably infinite, we can enumerate the elements of S as a 1 , a2 , .... 
But 2:::'=1 1-Lo( {an}) = 0 and /lo (U:'=l {an}) = llo(S) = 1. Therefore /lo is not 
countably additive. 
LetS= {a1, a2, ... } and An= {ai : i = 1, 2, ... , n} for all n 2: 1. Then AntS 
and /lo(An) = 0 for all n 2: 1. 
2.11. 
(a) Since AU B =AU (B\A) and An (B\A) = 0, we have 
11(A U B) = 11(A) + M(B\A). 
Note that since (B\A) U (An B)= Band (B\A) n (An B)= 0, we have 
11(B) = M(B\A) + 11(A n B). 
Combining the two equation gives 11(A U B) = 11(A) + 11(B) - 11(A n B). 
(b) Since 11 is nonnegative, this implication follows immediately from part (a). 
(c) Since A = (An B) u (B\A) and (An B) n (B\A) = 0, we have 11(A) = 
11(A n B)+ M(B\A) 2: 11(A n B).

MEASURES 
2.12. 
We use the mathematical induction method. When n = 1, the equality is 
trivial. Suppose that the equality holds for n = m. Then from problem 2.11 and the 
induction hypothesis, we have 
~ (Q Ai) + ~(Am+I)- ~ ( (Q Ai) n Am+I) 
L ~(Ai)- L 
~(Ai n Aj)

+(-l)m+l~(A 1 nA2 n · · · nAm)

Also from the induction hypothesis, we have 
~ ( (QAi) nAm+l) 
~ (Q(Ai n Am+I))

(2.2) 
l:S;i:S;m

l:S;i<j<k:S;m 
(2.3) 
It follows from Equations (2.1) and (2.3) that the equality holds for n = m + 1. 
Therefore, the equality holds for all n E N. 
2.13. 
Let B 1 = A1 and Bn = An\ ( U~:/ Ai) for n ?: 2. Then U~=l Bn = 
U~=l An, Bi n Bj = 0 for all 1 :S i < j, and ~(En) :S ~(An) for all n ?: 1. 
Consequently, we have 
This completes the proof.

2.14. Since J-Lo is finitely additive and A1, A2, ... are disjoint, we have 
for all N 2: 1. Since J-Lo is nonnegative, we have J-Lo (U~=l An) = J-Lo ( U~=l An)+ 
J-Lo (U~=N + 1 An) 2: L~= 1 J-Lo (An) for all N 2: 1. Now the result follows by letting 
N-+ oo. 
2.15. Since Sis infinite, we can find an infinite subset B = {b1, b2, ... } of S. Let 
An = {bi : i 2: n} for all n 2: 1. Then An .j,. 0. Note that J-L(An) = oo for all n 2: 1, 
we have limn-+oo J-L(An) = 00. 
2.16. 
First, we show that I is a 1r-system. Let h E I and I 2 E I. Then, by 
definition of I, we have h = G1 n H 1 and I 2 = G2 n H2 for some G 1 , G2 E Q, 
and H 1, H 2 E H. Since Q and Hare O"-algebras, we have h n I 2 = (G1 n G2) n 
(H1 n H2) E I. Thus, I is a 1r-system. 
Next, we show that O"(I) = O"(Q, H). Since I 
<;;; O"(Q, H), we have O"(I) <;;; 
O"(Q, H). Note that Q and H are O"-algebras on S, we have S E Q and S E H. 
Consequently, Q <;;; I and H <;;; I. Hence, Q U H <;;; O"(I) and O"(Q, H) <;;; O"(I). 
Therefore, O"(I) = O"(Q, H). 
2.17. This implication A E ~follows from Problems 1.9 and 2.9. 
2.18. 
By Problem 2.17, we have G E ~-
Let Fn = G k \ Gn for all n 2: k. 
Since Gn :2 Gn+l for all n and Gn .j,. G, we have Fn <;;; Fn+l for all n 2: k and 
Fn t Gk \G. Using Theorem 2.1, we have 
Since J-L(Gk) is finite by hypothesis, we have J-L(Gn) .j,. J-L(G).

Suppose that there are uncountably many disjoint sets A E I: such that 
p,(A) > 0 and let C be the collection of such sets. Let Cn = {A E C : p,(A) > 1/n} 
for all n ;:::: 1. Then C = U:=l Cn. Since Cis uncountable, there exists at least one 
Cia for some i 0 ;::=: 1 that has uncountably many elements. It follows that Jt(S) ;::=: 
LAEC, 0 p,(A) = oo, contradicting the assumption that JL is finite. Therefore, there 
cannot be uncountably many disjoint sets A E I: such that p,(A) > 0. 
2.5 
Bibliographic Notes 
A a--algebra is a structure imposed on a collection of sets on which a measure can 
be defined. Recall that a measure on a set S is a function that assigns a real number 
to subsets of S. We can think of the measure as a notion of size or volume for the 
subsets. However, it might be not possible to assign such a size to every subset of S. 
For example, it is not possible to assign a size to a Vitali set (Herrlich, 2006, p 120). 
As a result, we consider only a smaller collection of subsets of S when defining 
measures. This smaller collection of subsets are called measurable sets. 
The notions of 1r-system and ,\-system are adopted from Williams (1991). Those 
concepts are useful for dealing with a--algebras. For more information about a--
algebras and measures, readers are referred to Billingsley (1986), Williams (1991 ), 
Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999), Vestrup (2003), and Athreya and Lahiri (2006). 
Topology space and continuous functions are presented in books on real analysis 
such as Rudin (1970). For a history of measure theory, readers are referred to Pap 
(2002). 
Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 are very useful. For proofs of these theorems, readers can 
consult Williams ( 1991, pp21 ,27). 

CHAPTER 3 
EXTENSION OF MEASURES 
As defined in the previous chapter, a measure is a set function on an algebra. To 
extend a measure from an algebra to a a-algebra, we need some tools. In this chapter, 
we will introduce concepts and theorems related to measure extension. 
3.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 3.1 (Outer Measure). An outer measure on a setS is a nonnegative, ex-
tended real-valued set function J..L* : 28 --+ [0, oo] that satisfies the following condi-
tions: 
(a) J..L* (0) = 0. 
(b) (Monotonicity) If A~ B ~ S, then J..L*(A)::::; J..L*(B). 
(c) (Countable subadditivity) If An ~ S for all n ~ 1, then 
Measure, Probability, and Mathematical Finance.

EXTENSION OF MEASURES 
Definition 3.2 (Complete Measure). Let J-l be a measure on a O"-algebra ~. The 
measure f-l is said to be complete if and only if all subsets of a zero measure set in ~ 
are in~. Thus, whenever A E ~with J-l(A) = 0, we have BE~ for all B ~A. 
Definition 3.3 (Completion of Measure Spaces). Let (S, ~' J-l) be a measure space. 
The completion of (S, ~' J-l) is a measure space (S, ~~"' J-l), where 
~~" = {AUB: A E ~,B ~ N E ~,J-l(N) = 0}. 
The measure J-l is extended to ~It as follows. Let E E ~w Then E = AU B, 
where A E ~and B ~ N for some N E ~with J-l(N) = 0. We define J-l(E) = 
J-l(A U B) = J-l(A). 
Theorem 3.1 (Extension of Finite Measures). If J-l is a finite measure on an algebra 
~0 , then J-l can be extended to a measure on 0"(~0 ). 
Theorem 3.2 (Uniqueness of Extension). Let S be a set, let I be a 1r-system on S, 
and let ~ = O"(I) be the O"-algebra generated by I. If /-ll and f-l2 are measures on 
(S, ~)such that /-ll (S) = /12(8) < oo and /-ll (I) = J-l2(I) for all I E I, then 
J-li(I) = /12(!) 
't:/1 E ~. 
Theorem 3.3 (Monotone Class Theorem). Let ~ 0 be an algebra of subsets of a set 
S. Let~ be a monotone class of subsets of S. (i.e., if A 1 , A2, ... E ~and An t A 
or An_)_ A, then A E ~). lf~o ~ ~.then O"(~o) ~ ~. 
Theorem 3.4 (Caratbeodory's Extension Theorem). Let J-l be a O"-finite measure on 
an algebra ~0 of subsets of a set S. Then J-l has a unique extension to a measure on 
O"(~o). 
Theorem 3.5 (Approximation Theorem). Let (S, ~' J-l) be a measure space. Let ~0 
be an algebra of subsets of S such that 0"(~0 ) = ~. Assume that J-l is O"-finite on ~o. 
If A E ~and J-l(A) < oo, then, for each E > 0, there exists a set B E ~ 0 such that 
J-l(AtlB) < E, where AtlB is the symmetric difference of A and B (see Definition 
/.5). 
3.2 
Problems 
3.1. Let ~0 be an algebra of subsets of a setS, and let J-l be a finite measure on ~ 0 
(see Definition 2.9). Let { An}n::=: 1 and { Bn}n::=: 1 be two sequences of elements of 
~ 0 such that An t A and Bn t B (A and B may not belong to ~0 ). Show that if 
A~ B, then

3.2. Let 2::0 be an algebra of subsets of a set S, and let f1 be a finite measure on 
2::0. Let C be the collection of all limits of increasing sequence of elements of I:o. 
Thus, A E C if and only if there exists a sequence AI, A2, ... E 2::0 such that 
An t A. Let A be a set function on C defined as follows. If A E C and A t/:. 2::0 , then 
A( A) = limn--+oo fl(An), where AI, A2, ... E I:o and An t A E C. If A E C and

(d) If A, BE CandAS: B, then A(A) ::::; A(B). 
(e) If AI, A2, ... E C and Ant A, then A E C and A(An) -+A( A). 
3.3. Let C be a collection of subsets of a set S and A be a nonnegative, real-valued 
set function on C such that C and A satisfy the four conditions (b)-(e) in Problem 3.2; 
that is, C and A satisfy: 
(a) 0 E C and A(0) = 0; S E C and A(S) < oo. 
(b) If A, BE C, then AUB, AnB E C and A(AUB) = A(A) +A(B)- .A(AnB). 
(c) If A, B E C and A S: B, then A(A) ::::; A(B). 
(d) If AI, A2, ... E C and Ant A, then A E C and A(An)-+ A( A). 
For each A s:;; S, define 
fl*(A) = inf{A(G): G E C, AS: G}. 
Show that 
(a) 11* = A on C, and 0 ::::; 11* (A) ::::; A(S) for all A S: S. 
(b) fl*(A U B)+ fl*(A n B)::::; fl*(A) + fl*(B) for all A, B S: S. 
(c) If A, B S: Sand AS: B, then fl*(A)::::; fl*(B).

(e) 11* is an outer measure on S. 
(f) IfH = { H S: S : 11* (H)+ 11* (He) = fl*(S)}, then His a O"-algebra of subsets

3.3 
Hints 
3.1. Consider the sequence Am n Bn and use Theorem 2.1. 
3.2. 
The parts (a)-(d) should be straightforward according to the definition of>., 
Problem 3.1, and Problem 2.11. For part (e), we need to construct an increasing se-
quence of sets in I:0 from the increasing sequences that converge to A 1 , A2, ... , An, 
... such that the constructed increasing sequence of sets converges to A. For exam-
ple, let Bnm t An as m --+ oo for each n ~ 1. Then we let Cm = U:1 Bi,m+l-i 
form ~ 1. The sequence { Cm}m:::: 1 is an increasing sequence and converges to A. 
3.3. Part (a) follows from the definition of p,* directly. For parts (b)-(d), we need to 
use the definition of p,* in another form. For example, for each n ~ 1, there exists a 
set An E C such that A~ An and >.(An) < p,*(A) + 1/n. Part (e) can be proved 
by using the definition of outer measures and parts (a), (b), and(d). For part (f), we 
can use the concepts of 1r-system and .A-system to prove that 1i is a a-algebra. The 
method of mathematical induction can be used to prove that p,* is a measure on H. 
3.4. Follow the definition of a-algebra (see Definition 2.2). 
3.5. Part (a) can be proved by using the definition of p,1 and p,2 . For part (b), we 
need to use the E technique; that is, for any E > 0, there exists a set B€ E I: and 
B€ ~ A such that p,1 (A) < p,(B€) +E. 
3.4 Solutions 
3.1. Let m ~ 1 be fixed. Then Am n Bn t Am n B = Am as n --+ oo. By Theorem 
2.1, we have p,(Am n Bn) t p,(Am) as n --+ oo. But by Problem 2.11, we have 
p,(Am n Bn) :S: p,(Bn) for all n ~ 1. Hence we have p,(Am) = limn--+oo p,(Am n 
Bn) :S: limn--+oo p,(Bn)· Inequality (3.1) follows by letting m --+ oo. Equality (3.2) 
follows from inequality (3.1). 
3.2. 

SOLUTIONS 
33 
(a) This follows from Problem 3.1. 
(b) This is trivial since ~ 0 is an algebra, ~0 <;;; C, and>.= f-t on ~o-
(c) Let An, Bn E ~ 0 for n 2 1 such that An t A and Bn t B. Then we have 
An U Bn t AU B E C and Ann Bn t An B E C. By Problem 2.11, 
f-t(An u Bn) = f-t(An) + f-t(Bn) - f-t(An n Bn) for all n 2 1. Letting n-+ oo, 
we get >.(AU B) =>.(A)+ >.(B)- >.(An B). 
(d) This follows from Problem 3.1. 
(e) For each n 2 1, since An E C, there exists a sequence { Bnm}m>l in ~o 
such that Bnm t An as m -+ oo. Let Cn = U~ 1 Bin for all n 2-1. Then 
Bin <;;; Cn <;;; An and f-t(Bin) :::; f-t( Cn) :::; >.(An) for all i :::; n. Letting n-+ oo, 
we get Ai <;;; U~= 1 Cn <;;;A and >.(Ai) :::; limn-+oo f-t(Cn) :::; limn-+oo >.(An)· 
Letting i -+ oo, we get A = U~=l Cn (or Cn t A) and limn-+oo >.(An) 
limn-too f-t(Cn) =>.(A). 
3.3. 
(a) This follows from the definition of f-t*. 
(b) Let E > 0. By the definition of f-l*, there exists a set E E C such that A <;;; E 
and >.(E) :::; f-t*(A) +E. Similarly, there exists a set F E C and >.(F) :::; 
f-t*(B) +E. Note that AU B <;;; E U FE C and An B <;;;En FE C, we have 
f-t*(A U B):::; >.(E U F) and J.L*(A n B):::; >.(En F) by the definition of J.L*. 
Since >.(E u F)+ >.(En F) = >.(E) +>.(F), we have 
J.L*(A U B)+ J.L*(A n B):::; J.L*(A) + f-t*(B) + 2E. 
Since E > 0 is arbitrary, the result follows. 
(c) By the definition of J.L*. there exists a set Bn E C such that B <;;; Bn and 
>.(Bn) < J.L*(B) + 1/n. Since A <;;; B, we have A <;;; Bn and thus J.L*(A) :::; 
>.(Bn). Hence we have J.L*(A) < J.L*(B) + 1/n. The result follows by letting 
n-+ oo. 
(d) Since Ant A, then J.L*(An) is increasing and J.L*(An) :::; J.L*(A) :::; >.(S) < oo 
for all n 2 1. Hence the limit of J.L * (An) exists and limn-+oo J.L * (An) :::; J.L * (A). 
Thus we only need to prove J.L*(A):::; limn-+oo J.L*(An)· 
Let E > 0. For each n 2 1, by the definition of J.L*, there exists a set En E C 
such that An <;;; En and >.(En) :::; J.L*(An) + E/2n. Then A = U~=l An <;;; 
U~=l En. It follows that

(3.4) 
To prove inequality (3.4), we use mathematical induction. When N = 1, in-
equality (3.4) is true by the choice of E 1 . Assume that inequality (3.4) is true 
for N = m. Then by the property of >., we have

lim .x (u):::: lim J1*(AN) +E. 
N --+oo 
N --+oo 
n=l 
By inequality (3.3), we get J1*(A)::; limN--+oo J1*(AN) +E. Since E is arbitrary, 
we have J1*(A)::; limn--+oo J1*(An). This completes the proof. 
(e) It is clear that /1*(0) = 0 and J1*(A) ::; J1*(B) for A ~ B ~ S. Now let 
An ~ S for n 2:: 1. Then by parts (d) and (b) of this proof, we have 
Hence 11* is an outer measure on S. 
(f) By Problem 2.6, to show that 1i is a O"-algebra, we only need to show that 1i is 
both a 1r-system and ad-system. Let A, B E 1i. By part (b) of this proof, we 
have J1*(A n B)+ 11*((A n B)c) 2:: J1*(S) and J1*(A u B)+ J1*((A U B)c) 2:: 
11*(8). Hence, wehavef1*(AnB)+M*((AnB)c)::; J1*(A)+J1*(B)-J1*(Au 
B)+J1*(Ac)+J1*(Bc)-J1*(AcnBc) = 2J1*(S)-[J1*(AUB)+J1*(AcnBc)]::; 
11*(8). Hence 11*(A n B)+ J1*((A n Bn = 11*(8) and then An B E 1i. 
Therefore, 1i is a 1r-system. 
Now we show that 1i is ad-system. Since /1*(0) = 0, we haveS E 1i. Let 
A, B E 1i and A ~ B. Then Ac E 1i. Since 1i is a 1r-system, we have 
B n Ac E 1i. Now let An E 1i for n 2:: 1 and An t A. By part (d) of this proof,

we have p,*(An) t p,*(A). Since A~ J. Ae, p,*(Ae) :::; p,*(A~) = p,*(S)-
p,*(An) or p,*(An) :::; p,*(S)- p,*(Ae) for all n :::: 1. Letting n -7 oo gives 
p,*(A):::; p,*(S)-p,*(N). Butsincep,*(A)+p,*(N):::: p,*(AuAe) = p,*(S), 
we have p,*(A) + p,*(N) = p,*(S). Therefore, A E 1i. Hence 1i is ad-system. 
Finally, we show that p,* is a finite measure on 1i. Clearly, p,*(0) = 0 and 
p,* (S) < oo. To show that p,* is countably additive, let A1 , A2 , ... be disjoint 
sets in 1i. We claim that 
(3.5) 
To show this, we use mathematical induction. When N = 1, Equation (3.5) is 
trivial. Assume that Equation (3.5) holds for N = m. Then by part (b) of this 
proof, we obtain 
p,*(S)- p,* co: A~) 
> p,*(S)- p,* (ft A~) - p,*(A~+l) 
+p,* ( (01 A~) U A~+ 1 ) 
2p,*(S) _ p,* co A~) _ p,*(A~+l) 
p,* (Ql An) + p,*(Am+l) 
Therefore, equation (3.5) holds for all N :::: 1. The result follows by letting 
N -7 oo in Equation (3 .5) and part (d) of this proof. 
3.4. 
Since S E I: and p,(0) = 0, we have S = S U 0 E I:w Let E E I:w 
Then E = AU B, where A E I; and B ~ N for some N E I; with p,(N) = 0. 
Since Ne ~ Be, we have Ee = Ae n Be = (Ae nNe) u (Ae n Ben N). Note 
that since p,(Ae n Be n N) :::; p,(N) = 0, we have p,(Ae n Be n N) = 0. Thus 
Ee E I:w Now let En E I: I-' for n :::: 1. Then En =An U Bn, where An and Bn are 
defined similarly. Since U~= 1 En = U~= 1 An u Bn = (U~= 1 An) u (U~= 1 Bn) 
and JL (U~= 1 Bn) = 0 (see Problem 2.19), we have U~=l En E I:w Therefore, I:~-'

some set N E I: with J.L(N) = 0. Note that A1 E I: and A1 ~ A, we have 
J.Ll (A) 2:: J.L(Al) = J.L(A). On the other hand, we have A ~ A1 UN. We have 
J.L1 (A) :::; J.L(A1 UN) = J.L(Al) = J.L(A). Thus J.Ll(A) = J.L(A). Similarly, we 
have J.L2(A) = J.L(A). 
(b) Suppose that A ~ Sand /-Ll (A) = J.L2(A) < oo. For each n 2:: 1, by definition 
of J.L1, there exists a set Bn E I: such that Bn ~ A and /-Ll (A) < J.L(Bn) + 1/n. 
Similarly, there exists a sequence { Cn}n>l of sets in I: such that Cn ::2 A for 
all n 2:: 1 and J.L2(A) > J.L(Cn)- 1/n. Then U~ 1 Bi ~ A~ n~ 1 Ci. Now 
we let B = U~ 1 Bn and C = n~=l Cn and write A= B U (A\B). Note that 
J.L(Bn) :::; J.L (U~l. Bi), J.L(Cn) 2:: J.L(n~=l Cn), and J.L(Bn) + 1/n > /-Ll (A) = 
J.L2(A) > J.L(Cn)- 1/n for all n 2:: 1. We have J.L(C\B) = J.L(C)- J.L(B) :::; 
J.L(Cn) - J.L(Bn) < 2/n. Letting n-+ oo gives J.L(C\B) = 0. This completes 
the proof.

Bibliographic Notes 
Usually we define a set function on a field I:0 of subsets of a setS and then extend the 
set function to a measure on cr(I:0 ), the smallest cr-field containing I:0 . The theorems 
presented in this chapter provide a theoretical foundation for measure extension. For 
example, we can extend the set function J.L( a, b] = b - a defined on the set of all 
right-semiclosed intervals to B (Ash and Doleans-Dade, 1999, p12). 
In a general case, we consider extending a finite measure J.Lo from a field I:0 of 
subsets of a setS to the minimal cr-field I: = cr(I:0 ). To do this, we first consider 
extending the measure to the set of all limits of increasing sequences of sets in I:0 , 
as follows: 
I:1 ={A~ S: there are sets An E I:o such that Ant A}. 
We can do this by defining J.Ll on I:1 as follows: 
J.Ll(A) = lim J.Lo(An), 
n-+oo 
where A E I:1 and An E I:0 is a sequence such that An t A. 
Then we define an extended set function J.L* on S as 
J.L*(A) = inf{J.Ll(G): G E I:1, G ::2 A}. 
It can be shown that J.L* defined in the above equation is an outer measure on S 
(see Problem 3.3). Using the outer measure, we define a set 1i = 
{ H 
~ S : 
J.L*(H) + J.L*(Hc) = J.L*(S)}. It can be shown that 1i is a cr-field and J.L* is a finite 
measure on 1i. The set 1i is a superset of cr(I:0 ). In fact, if a set B E 1i, then 
we can write B = AU N for some A E cr(I:0 ) and N ~ M, where M E cr(I:0 ) 
and J.L* (M) = 0. The measure space (S, 1i, J.L*) is also called the completion of the 
measure space (S, cr(I:o), J.L*). 
Rosenthal (2006, Chapter 2) presented some examples of constructing probability 
measures using the extension theorem.

LEBESGUE-STIELTJES MEASURES 
Definition 4.3 (Lebesgue Measure). The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure J-L on R defined 
by 
J-L( a, b] = b - a, 
a < b 
is called the Lebesgue measure on B (see Theorem 4.1). The completion i3 of B 
relative to the Lebesgue measure is called the class of Lebesgue measurable sets. 
Definition 4.4 (Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure on Rd). A Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure 
on Rd is a measure f-L on B(Rd) such that J-L(I) < oo for each bounded interval 
I c R d, where d E N and B(R d) is the collections of Borel sets of R d, that is, the 
a-algebra generated by all intervals (a, b], a, bE Rd. 
Definition 4.5 (Difference Operator). Let G : Rd --+ R be a function. The differ-
ence operator ~i,b,aG(x 1 , x2, ... , xd), 1 :::; i :::; d, is defined as 
G(x1, ... , Xi-l, b, Xi+ I, ... , xd) 
-G(xl, ... ,Xi-l,a,xi+l,····xd)· 
(4.1) 
Definition 4.6 (Distribution Function on R d). A distribution function on R d is a 
map F : R d --+ R that satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) F is increasing; that is, a :::; b (i.e., ai :::; bi fori = 1, 2, ... , d, where ai and bi 
are the ith components of a and b, respectively), implies F(a, b] ::::: 0, where 
F(a, b] = ~l,b 1 ,a 1 •.• ~d,bd,adF(xl, x2, ... , Xd); 
(4.2) 
(b) F is right-continuous; that is, for any sequence x 1 ::::: x 2 ::::: · · · --+ x, we have 
F(xk) --+ F(x). 
Definition 4.7 (Lebesgue Measure on Rd). The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure J-L on 
R d defined by 
J-L(a, b] = F(a, b], 
a:::; b 
is called the Lebesgue measure on B(Rd) if F(x) = x 1x2 · · · Xd for x E Rd. The 
completion B(Rd) of B(Rd) relative to the Lebesgue measure is called the class of 
Lebesgue measurable sets in Rd. 
Theorem 4.1. Let F be a distribution function on R, and let B0 (R) be the algebra 
of all finite disjoint unions of right-semiclosed intervals ofR (counting [-oo, b] as 
right-semiclosed). Let J-L: B0 (R) --+ R be a set function defined as 
J-L(a, b] = F(b)- F(a), 
a< b. 
Then J-L has a unique extension to a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure on R. 
Theorem 4.2. Let F be a distribution function on Rd, and let B0(fid) be the alge-
bra of all finite disjoint unions of right-semiclosed intervals (a, b] of R d (counting 
[ -oo, b] as right-semiclosed), where 
(a, b] = {x E Rd: ai <Xi :::; bi, i = 1, 2, ... , d}.

HINTS 
41 
4.3 Hints 
4.1. Use the definition of distribution functions (see Definition 4.2) and the result of 
Problem 2.18. 
4.2. It might not be easy to find such a measure directly. But one can easily find a 
distribution function that is not left-continuous at some point. Then one can define a 
measure based on the distribution function. 
4.3. 
To prove those equalities, we need to write the intervals in terms of right-
semiclosed intervals. 
4.4. Consider simple cases when d = 1, 2 and then use the method of mathematical 
induction to deal with the general case. 
4.5. First consider simple cases when d = 1, 2 and then consider the general case. 
4.6. 
Part (a) can be proved by using the definition of F(a, b]. Part (b) can be 
proved by using the proof of part (a) and the fact that F1 , F2 , ... , Fd are distribution 
functions on R. 
4.7. Use the result of problem 4.3 and the fact that a countable set can be expressed 
as{al,a2, ... }. 
4.8. 
For part (a), we can show that C has Lebesgue measure 0 by calculating the 
Lebesgue measure of U:'=1 Mn. Part (b) can be proved by examining the construc-
tion procedure of C. For part (c), we can use the method of contradiction to prove 
that C is uncountable; that is, we assume that C is countable and try to find another 
point inC using the ternary forms (Cantor's diagonalizing method). 
4.9. Use the idea of constructing the Cantor ternary set in Problem 4.8. 
4.4 Solutions 
4.1. 
Clearly, F is increasing. To show that F is right-continuous, let Xn .j.. x0, 
that is, x1 2:: X2 2:: · · · > Xo and Xn -+ xa. Then we have (xo, Xn] .j.. 0. Then by 
Problem 2.18, we have F(xn)- F(x0) .j.. 0. Thus F is right-continuous and hence a 
distribution function. 
4.2. Let J.L be a set function defined on all right-semiclosed intervals as follows: 
{
0, 
if a< b < 0; 
J.L( a, b] = 
2, 
if a < 0 and 0 ::; b; 
0, 
if 0 ::; a < b. 

42 
LEBESGUE-STIELTJES MEASURES 
Then f-L can be extended to a measure on B according to Theorem 3.1. The corre-
sponding distribution function F is 
F(x) = {F(O)- 2, 
F(O), 
if X< 0; 
ifO::; X. 
Clearly, the distribution function is not left-continuous at 0. 
4.3. 
Parts (d)-(h) are obtained from the definition and items (a)-(c) by letting 
a--+ -oo orb--+ oo. In the following we prove parts (a)-( c). 
(a) By definition and Problem 2.18, we have 
JL[a,b] 
(b) By definition and Theorem 2.1, we get 
JL(a, b) = 
(c) Similarly, we have 
4.4. 
We use mathematical induction on d. When d = 1, Equation (4.3) reduces 
to .6.1,b,,a, = F(bi)- F(ai), which is true. Suppose that the equation holds when 
d = m. When d = m + 1, let 
f}.m+l,bm+l,am+l F(x1, · · · 'Xm+I) 
F(x1, ... , Xm, bm+l)- F(x1, ... , Xm, am+d·

J.l{Y: Yi:::; xi,i = 1,2, ... ,d- 2,ad-1:::; Yd-1:::; bd-1,ad:::; Yd:::; ad}· 
Repeating the above procedure d times gives the result. 
4.6. By definition, we have 
~d,bd,adF(x1, ... ,xd) 
F(x1, ... , Xd-1, bd) - F(x1, ... , Xd-1, ad) 
F(x1) · .. F(xd_I)F(bd)- F(x1) · · · F(xd_I)F(ad) 
F(x1) · · · F(xd_I)(F(bd)- F(ad)),

F(xl) · · · F(xd-2)(F(bd-I)- F(ad_l))(F(bd)- F(ad)). 
The result follows by repeating the above procedure d times. 
Now we show that F is a distribution function on Rd. Let a ::::; b. Then by the 
first part of this proof, we have 
d 
F(a, b] = IJ (Fi(bi)- Fi(ai)) ;:::: 0. 
i=l 
Hence F is an increasing function. The right-continuity ofF follows from the right-
continuity of F 1 , F 2 , ... , Fd. This completes the proof. 
4.7. 
Since A is a countable set, we can enumerate the elements of A and write 
A= {a1 , a 2 , ... }. Since f-L is countably additive, we have f..L(A) = 2:::~= 1 f..L(an). By 
Problem 4.3 and the assumption that F is continuous, we have f..L(an) = f..L[an, an] = 
F(an)- F(a;;) = 0. Hence f..L(A) = 0. 
4.8. 
(a) Let f-L be the Lebesgue measure. Then f..L(Mn) = ~ · (~r- 1 for n = 1, 2, .... 
Noting that lvh, M 2 , · · · are pairwise disjoint, we have 
00 
00 
f..L(C) = 1- f..L( U Mn) = 1-L f..L(Mn) = 0. 
n=l 
n=l 
(b) Suppose that x E C. Then in the first step of constructing C we have x E [0, ~] 
or x E [~, 1]. If x E [0, ~],then a 1 = 0 [~can be written as (0.0222 · · · )3]. 
If x E [{, 1], then a1 = 2. In this second step, we have x E [0, iJ U [~, ~] U 
[~, ~] U [~, 1], which implies that a 1, a 2 E {0, 2}. Repeating the above process 
shows that an E {0, 2} for all n ;:::: 1. 
Suppose that an E {0, 2} for all n;:::: 1. Then x E [0, ~] U [~, 1] in the first step 
of constructing Cas a 1 E {0, 2}. Similarly, xis not in the removed intervals in 
all steps. Hence x E C. 
(c) Suppose that C is countable. Then we can write C = { c1 , c2 , ... } . According 
to the second item of this problem, we can write en = (O.an 1an2 · · · h with 
anm E {0, 2} for all n, m;:::: 1. Now we let b = (O.b1 b2 · · · )3, where 
bn = {0, 
~f ann= 2; 
2, 
1f ann= 0. 

BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES 
45 
Then b =1- Cn for all n ~ 1 since the difference of bn and ann is 2. Hence b tJ_ C. 
But bn E {0, 2} for all n ~ 1, we have b E C, which contradicts b tJ_ C. Thus 
C is uncountable. 
4.9. We use a similar approach used to construct the Cantor ternary set to construct 
A. Let a E (0, 1) be a constant. First we remove the middle a/2 from interval [0, 1]. 
That is, we remove M 1 = (a/4, 3a/4) from [0, 1]. Then we remove the middle 
a/8 of the remaining two intervals; that is, we remove M2 = (a/16, 3a/16) U 
(8 + 5a/16, 8 + 7a/16). We continue the above process to remove M 3 , M 4 , .. . . 
Finally, we let A = [0, 1]\ U~=l Mn. Note that f.L(Mn) = a/2n and M1, M2, .. . 
are disjoint, we have f.L(A) = 1- ,L~=l f.L(Mn) = 1 a> 0. 
We claim that A does not contain any open interval. In fact, suppose that (a, b) r:;;; 
A for some a < b. Then (a, b) must be in some remaining interval after Mn is 
removed for all n ~ 1. However, for sufficient large n, the length of each remaining 
interval after Mn is removed is less than b- a. Hence (a, b) must not be in any of 
those remaining intervals. Thus, A does not contain any open interval. 
4.5 
Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced the Lebesgue measure and the Lebesgue-Stieltjes mea-
sure, which is more general than the Lebesgue measure. To define the Lebesgue 
measure on the real line, we first define the measure on the collection of left-open 
and right-closed intervals. Then we extend this measure to the collection of Borel 
sets. For more information about Lebesgue measures, readers are referred to Ash 
and Doleans-Dade (1999). 
Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 state that we can define measures based on distribution 
functions. The proofs of these theorems can be found in Ash and Doleans-Dade 
(1999, pp24,30).

5.3 Hints 
5.1. Use the definition of h- 1 (Definition 5.1) and the standard technique to prove

5.4 Solutions 
5.1. 
(a) First, let x E h-1 (U:1 Ai)· By definition, we have 
Thus we have h(x) E U:1 Ai, which implies that h(x) E Aix for some ix E 
N. Therefore 
00 
i=1 
Since x is arbitrary, we have 
(5.2) 
Next, let x E U:1 h- 1(Ai), then x E h-1(AiJ for some ix EN. By defini-
tion, we have 
00 
i=1 
which gives x E h-1 (U:1 Ai). Since xis arbitrary, we have 
(5.3) 
Combining (5.2) and (5.3) gives 
(b) Since x E h- 1(Ac) is equivalent to h(x) E Ac, which is equivalent to h(x) rf-
A, and h(x) rf- A is equivalent to x rf- h-1(A), which is equivalent to x E 
(h- 1(AW, we have h- 1(Ac) = (h- 1(AW. 
5.2. 
First, we prove necessity. Suppose that IA E mE. Then, by definition of 
E-measurable functions, we have A= 1_.41(1) E E. 
Next, we prove sufficiency. Suppose that A E E. Let BE B. Then we have 
if 1 E B and 0 rf_ B; 
if 1 rf_ B and 0 E B; 
if 1 E B and 0 E B; 
ifl rf- Band 0 rf- B.

MEASURABLE FUNCTIONS 
Thus we have (41 (B) E ~- Hence IA is ~-measurable. 
5.3. Let A be the collection of elements A of !3 such that h - 1 (A) E ~: 
A= {A E !3: h- 1(A) E ~}. 
We claim that A is a a-algebra on R. Since h-1(R) = {s E S: h(s) E R} = S E 
~.we haveR E A. Let A E A, then h- 1(A) E ~- From Problem 5.1, we have 
h- 1(Ac) = (h- 1(A))c. Note that~ is a a-algebra on S, so we have h- 1(Ac) E ~ 
which implies Ac E A. Let Ai E A (i E N), then we have h- 1(Ai) E ~for all 
i EN. From Problem 5.1, we have 
which gives 
00 U Ai EA. 
i=1 
Therefore, A is a a-algebra on R. From the definition of A, we have A s;;; !3. Since 
!3 = a(C) and C s;;; A (by hypothesis), we have !3 s;;; A. Thus we have A = !3, 
which implies that h is ~-measurable. 
5.4. This proof is similar to that of Problem 5.3. Let A be defined as 
We show that A is a a-algebra on S2. Since h-1(82) = {x E S1 : h(x) E S2} = 
S1 E ~1, we have S2 E A. Let A E A, then h- 1(A) E ~1· From Problem 
5.1, we have h- 1(Ac) = (h- 1(A))c, and so h-1(N) E ~ 1 . Hence Ac E A. Let 
Ai E A (i EN); then we have h- 1(Ai) E ~ 1 for every i EN. From Problem 5.1, 
we have 
which gives 
00 
Therefore, A is a a-algebra on S2. From the definition of A, we have As;;; ~ 2 . Since 
~2 =a( C) and C s;;; A (by hypothesis), we have ~ 2 s;;; A. Thus we have A= ~ 2 , 
which implies that h is ~I/~ 2 -measurable. 
5.5. 
First, we show that h-1(a(C)) is a a-algebra on S. In fact, since a(C) is a 
a-algebra on R, we haveS = h-1(R) E h-1(a(C)). Let F E h-1(a(C)); then 
we have F = h- 1(A) for some A E a(C). From Problem 5.1, we have pc = 

SOLUTIONS 
53 
(h- 1(A))c = h- 1(N) E h- 1(a(C)). Let Fn E h- 1(a(C)) (n E N); then Fn = 
h- 1(An) for some An E a( C). Again from Problem 5.1, we have 
9
1 Fn = 9
1 h-1(An) = h-1 (91 An) E h-1(a(C)). 
Thus, h- 1(a(C)) is a a-algebra on S. Note that as h- 1(C) ~ h- 1 (a(C)), we have 
(5.4) 
Next, we show that 
(5.5) 
To do this, we define A as 
We claim that A is a a-algebra on R. In fact, sinceRE a(C) and h- 1(R) = S E 
a(h- 1(C)), we haveR EA. Let A E A, then A E a( C) and h- 1(A) E a(h- 1(C)). 
From Problem 5.1, we have h- 1(N) = (h- 1(A))c E a(h- 1 (C)). Thus, Ac EA. 
Let An E A (n EN), then An E a(C) and h- 1(An) E a(h- 1(C)). From Problem 
5.1, we have 
h- 1 (91 An) = 9
1 h- 1(An) E a(h- 1(C)), 
which implies U:=l An E A. Therefore, A is a a-algebra on R. Note that with 
C ~ A, we have a(C) ~ A. By definition of A, we have A ~ a(C). Therefore, 
A= a( C), which implies (5.5). 
Combining (5.4) and (5.5) gives the result. 
5.6. 
Let C = {0 ~ R : 0 is open}, then B = a(C). By hypothesis, we have 
h-: 1(0) E B(S), 'VO E C. From Problem 5.3, we know that his B(S)-measurable; 
that is, h is Borel (see Definition 5.2). 
5.7. 
Let C = {( -oo, c] : c E R}, then we have B = a( C) (see Problem 2.4). 
By hypothesis, h- 1(A) E L:, 'VA E C. From Problem 5.3, we know that his L:-
measurable. This completes the proof. 
5.8. To prove a function f o h E mL:, we only need to show that {! o h > c} E 
L:, 'Vc E R, where{! o h > c} = {s E S: f(h(s)) > c} (see Problem 5.7). To do 
this, let 
Ac ={a E R: f(a) > c} = f- 1((c,oo)), 
'Vc E R. 
Since f E mB, we have AcE B, 'Vc E R. Note that 
{! o h > c} = {s E S: h(s) E Ac} = h- 1(Ac), 
'Vc E R 
and h E mL:, we have {! o h > c} E L:, which implies that f o h is L:-measurable, 
that is, f o hE mL:.

MEASURABLE FUNCTIONS 
5.9. To prove a function h E m~, we only need to show that { h > c} E ~. 't/c E R, 
where {h > c} = {s E S: h(s) > c} (see Problem 5.7). 
(a) Note that 
{~g~ hn > c} = n {hn > c}, 
't/m EN, 
-
n2':m 
which implies infn'2:m hn is ~-measurable for all mE N. 
(b) From 
{ sup hn :S c} = n {hn :S c}, 
't/m EN, 
n2':m 
n2':m 
we know that supn'2:m hn is ~-measurable for all mEN. 
(c) Since 
lim inf hn = sup inf hn 
m'2:1n'2:m 
and infn'2:m hn is ~-measurable for every m E N, we have lim inf hn E m~. 
(d) Similarly, note that 
lim sup hn = inf sup hn, 
m'2:1n'2:m 
and supn'2:m hn is ~-measurable for every m E N, we have lim sup hn E m~. 
(e) Note that limn-+oo hn ( s) exists in R if and only if 
lim sup hn(s) =lim inf hn(s). 
Thus we have 
{ s: lim hn(s)existsinR} 
n-+oo 
{lim sup hn < oo} n {liminf hn > -oo} n f-1( {0} ), 
where f = lim sup hn - lim inf hn. Since lim sup hn and lim inf hn are ~­
measurable, we have 
{ s: lim hn(s) exists in R} E ~-

5.10. 
By Theorem 5.1, we know that h1 -
h2 and h2 -
h1 are ~-measurable 
functions. Let f : R ---+ R be defined as 
f(x) = { ~ 
Then we have 
if X> 0; 
if X::::: 0. 

SOLUTIONS 
55 
By Problem 5.8, we only need to show that f is B-measurable in order to show that 
max(h1 , h 2 ) is I:-measurable. Let A E B. Then we have 
f_ 1(A) ={An (O,oo) 
ifO tf. A; 
AU ( -oo, 0] 
if 0 E A, 
which implies that f- 1 (A) E B. Hence f E mB. This completes the proof. 
5.11. 
Clearly, f n ( n ~ 1) are nonnegative simple functions and f n :::; f for all 
n~l. 
To show that f n t f, we first show that 
(5.6) 
To do this, let x E S. If f(x) = 0, then fn(x) = fn+l(x) = 0. If (i- 1)2-n < 
f(x) :::; i2-n for some 1 :::; i :::; n2n, then fn(x) = (i- 1)2-n. But (2i-
2)2-(n+l) < f(x):::; (2i)2-(n+l), we have fn+l(x) ~ (2i- 2)2-(n+l) = fn(x). 
If f(x) > n, then fn(x) = n. But fn+l(x) > n. Therefore, inequality (5.6) is true. 
Next, we show that 
lim fn =f. 
(5.7) 
n-7cxo 
Since lim sup fn :::; f, we only need to prove lim inf fn ~ f. To do this, let E > 0. 
For fixed xES, choose N, EN such that N, ~ max[f(x), log2 (1/c)]. Then 
liminf fn ~ inf fn(x) ~ fN,(x) > f(x)- TN, ~ f(x)- E. 
n?:N, 
Since this is true for every E > 0, we have lim inf f n ~ f. On combining Equation 
(5.6) and Equation (5.7), we get fn t f. 
5.12. First, we show that IA E M for every A E I:. To do that, let 
V ={A E I:: IA EM}. 
It follows from the definition of monotone classes that V is a d-system. From the 
assumption, we have I~ V. By Problem 2.7, I:= (]'(I) ~ V. Hence IA EM for 
every A E I:. Since M is a monotone class, M contains all the simple functions on 
S. 
Next, let f be a positive I:-measurable function on S. Then by Problem 5.11, 
there exists a sequence {fn: n ~ 1} of positive simple functions such that fn t f. 
Since fn EM, we have f EM. 
Finally, let f be a bounded I:-measurable function on S. Then f+ =max(!, 0) E 
M and f- = max(- f, 0) E M. Hence we have f = f+ - f- E M. 
This completes the proof.

Bibliographic Notes 
Most material in this chapter was taken from Williams (1991 ), where readers can find 
proofs of Theorem 5 .1. Proving Theorem 5.2 requires the following basic result of 
point-set topology: Iff is continuous, then f- 1 ( 0) is an open subset ofR whenever 
0 is an open subset ofR (Rosenthal, 2006, p31). 
In measure theory, the measurability of a function f : (81 , I:I) ---+ (82 , I:2 ) 
is defined in terms of the inverse image of f rather than the direct image of f. 
Hence, the function f is I:I/I:2-measurable does not imply than f(A) E I:2 for 
each A E I:1. In fact, basic set operations are preserved by inverse images but not in 
general by direct images (Ash and Doleans-Dade, 1999, p36). For example, we have 
f- 1(Ac) = [f- 1(AW but not f(Ac) = [f(AW in general. 

CHAPTER 6 
LEBESGUE INTEGRATION 
Lebesgue integration is the general theory of integration of a function with respect 
to a general measure. In this chapter, we present some concepts and theorems used 
to develop the Lebesgue integration theory. 
6.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 6.1 (Simple Function). Let (S, ~) be a measurable space and (m~)+ 
denote the set of all nonnegative ~-measurable functions. An element f of (m~)+ 
is considered simple if f can be written as a finite sum 
(6.1) 
where ak E [0, oo] and Ak E ~fork = 1, 2, ... , m. The set of all nonnegative 
simple functions is denoted by SF+.

6.3. For parts (a), (c), and (d), we need to use the result of Problem 6.1. Part (b) can 
be proved by using the definition of simple functions (see Definition 6.1). 
6.4. According to Problem 6.3, {JLo(Hn)}n>l is increasing. To show that

The first equation here is straightforward. The second one can be established by 
showing that liminf JLo(hn) ~ (1- E)JL(A) for all E > 0. 
6.5. 
Since f n and f are nonnegative simple functions, we can write them as the

Prove the problem by considering different cases of h. First show that the

Since IHml = 2m, we can show that H:j;, is a finite set. We let 1i = H:j;,. This

where ai 2: 0, bj 2: 0, Ai E :E, and Bj E :E fori = 1, 2, ... , m and j = 1, 2, ... , n. 
Iff = 0, then we have aiiA, = 0 and bjiBJ = 0 for all 1 ::; i ::; m and 
1 ::; j ::; n. In this case, both representations give JLo(f) = 0. Iff =J 0, then from 
Problem 6.1 we have 
(6.5) 
where C H ( H E H:j;,) are pairwise disjoint sets, u H > 0, D J ( J E H:/;) are pairwise

Since JLU -=1- g) = 0, we can show that (uH -VJ )JL(CHnDJ) = 0, UHJL(CH n

6.4. Since hn t IA, from Problem 6.3, we have flo(hn) :S: flo(hn+I) for n :::0: 1 and 
flo(hn) ::::; flo(IA) = fl(A), which implies that limsupflo(hn) ::::; fl(A). Thus, we 
only need to show that 
liminf flo(hn) :::0: fl(A). 
(6.13) 
Let E > 0, and let An = { s E A : hn ( s) > 1 - E}. We claim that An t A. In fact, 
since hn :S: hn+l, we have An ~ An+l· By definition, we have limn-+oo An ~ A. 
Lets E A. Since hn t IA, then hns (s) > 1 -

Letting m --+ oo in (6.14), we have

Since (6.15) is true for every E > 0, (6.13) is true. 
6.5. By hypothesis, f is a nonnegative simple function on S. Hence 
where ak 2: 0 and Ak E L: for 1 ::::; k ::::; r. 
If f = 0, then f n = 0, since, by hypothesis, f n ::::; f and f n 2: 0. By Problem 
6.2, J.Lo(fn) = J.Lo(f) = 0. Therefore (6.3) is true. 
If f > 0, then, by Problem 6.1, f can be written as 
s 
f= L:cJci, 
i=l 
where s E N, Ci > 0 for 1 ::::; i ::::; s, and Ci (1 ::::; i ::::; s) are pairwise disjoint. We 
claim that 
s 
fn = LlcJn, n 2: 1. 
(6.16) 
i=l 
To do this, let x E S. If fn(x) = 0, then Equation (6.16) is trivial. If fn(x) > 0, 
then, by hypothesis, f(x) 2: fn(x) > 0, which implies that X E Cia for some 
1 ::::; i 0 ::::; s. Accordingly, we have 
s 
fn(x) = IciJn(x) = L IcJn(x). 
i=l 
Therefore, Equation (6.16) is true. However, 
and by Problems 6.4 and 6.3, we have

Thus, by Problem 6.3 and Equation ( 6.17), we have 
This completes the proof.

where Ln = J.LoUn) for n;::: 1 and Rm = J.Lo(9m) form;::: 1. Let E > 0. Then 
for some n 0 E N. Let 
hn,rn = min(fn, 9m), 
n ;::: 1, m ;::: 1. 
By Problem 6.3, hn,m is a simple function on S. Noting that, for fixed n, 
we have 
hn,m t min(fn, f) = fn, 
E 
J.Lo(hno,mo) > Lno- 2' 
for some m 0 EN. By Problem 6.3, we have 
Roo;::: J.Lo(9m 0 );::: J.Lo(hn0 ,m0 )· 
On combining Equations (6.18)-(6.20), we get 
Roo> Loo- E, 
(6.18) 
(6.19) 
(6.20) 
so that Roo ;::: L 00 • Similarly, L 00 ;::: R 00 • Therefore, Loo = R 00 • This completes 
the proof. 
6.7. By Definition 6.3, we may choose a sequence hn (n ;::: 1) of simple functions 
on S such that hn :::; f and J.Lo(hn) t J.L(f). By Problem 5.11, we may also choose a 
sequence 9n ( n ;::: 1) of simple functions on S such that 9n t f. 
Let 
fn = max(gn, h1, h2, ... , hn), 
n EN. 
Then, fn :::; fn+l :::; f for n ;::: 1 and, by Problem 6.3, fn (n ;::: 1) are nonnegative 
simple functions. Since 9n t f and f ;::: fn ;::: 9n, we get fn t f. Since fn :::; f 
and fn is simple, by definition of J.L(f), J.LoUn) :::; J.L(f). Noting that hn :::; fn and 
J.Lo(hn) t J.L(f), we have J.LoUn) t J.L(f). 
By hypothesis, Yn t f. Since fn t f and J.Lo(fn) t J.L(f), by Problem 6.6, we 
have 
J.Lo(Yn) t J.L(f). 
Note that Yn (n;::: 1) are simple functions, we have J.L(Yn) = J.Lo(Yn). Therefore 
6.8. 
We will show that J.L( {! > 0}) = 0 by contradiction. To do this, let An = 
{f > 1/n} for n;::: 1. Then Ant {f > 0}. By Theorem 2.1, J.L(An) t J.L( {! > 0} ). 
Suppose that J.L( {! > 0}) > 0. Then J.L(AN) > 0 for some N EN. By definition of 
J.L(f), we obtain

which contradicts the hypothesis that J.LU) = 0. Thus J.L( {f > 0}) = 0. 
6.9. Let fn = o:nof and gn = o:nog, where O:n is as defined in Equation (5.1). Then 
fn and gn are nonnegative simple functions. Since, by hypothesis, J.LU =/=- g) = 0, 
J.LUn =/=- gn) = 0 and, by Problem 6.3, J.L(/n) = J.L(gn)· Noting that fn t f and 
gn t g, by Theorem 6.2, we have J.L(/) = J.L(g). 
6.10. Let f n = O:n o j+ and gn = O:n o f-, where O:n is as defined in Problem 5 .11. 
Then we have fn t j+ and gn t f-. By Theorem 6.2, we have 
i fndf-L = is fniAdJ.L tis J IAdJ.L = i fdJ.L. 
But 
0 :S: i fndf-L :S: i ndJ.L = nJ.L(A) = 0, 
which gives fA fndf-L = 0. Hence we have fA j+df-L = 0. Similarly, we have 
fA f-dJ.L = 0. Therefore, fA fdJ.L = 0. This completes the proof. 
6.11. By hypothesis, J.L(A) = 0. Hence J.LU =/=- f Is\A) = 0 and J.LUn =/=- fnls\A) = 
0. Consequently, by Problem 6.9, J.L(f) = J.LU Is\A) and J.LUn) = J.LUnis\A)· By 
Theorem 6.2, J.LUnis\A) t J.LU Is\A)· Therefore, J.LUn) t J.L(/). 
6.12. By Problem 5.11, we may choose two sequences f n ( n ;:::: 1) and gn ( n ;:::: 1) 
of nonnegative simple functions on S such that fn t f and gn t g. Then we have 
o:fn + f3gn t o:f + (3g. But, by Problem 6.3, 
J.L(o:Jn + f3gn) = O:J.L(/n) + f3J.L(gn)· 
Therefore, by Theorem 6.2, we have 
J.L(o:f + (3g) = O:J.L(f) + f3J.L(g). 
6.13. By hypothesis, fn,g E (m~)+ andfn:::; gforn;:::: 1. Theng- fn E (m~)+. 
By Theorem 6.3, we have 
J.L(liminf(g- fn)) :S: liminf J.L(g- fn)· 
Noting that J.L(g) < oo, by Problem 6.12, we have 
J.L(g)- J.L(limsupfn) :S: J.L(g) -limsupJ.L(/n), 
which leads to 
J.L(lim sup fn) ;:::: lim sup J.LUn)· 
6.14. 
(a) Since his J.L-integrable, we have f(h+ + h-)dJ.L < oo. Noting that h+ IA :::; h+

6.15. Suppose that JL( {I hi = oo}) > 0. Then fs lhidJL 2: OOJL( {I hi = oo}) = oo,

JL(iaf + fJgl)::::: JL(Iallfl + lfJIIgl)::::: laiJL(Ifl) + lfJIJL(Igl) < oo. 
Therefore, af + {Jg is JL-integrable. 
Next, we show that

(6.21) 
Let J;t = max(sgn(a)f, 0), J;; = max(- sgn(a)f, 0), gt = max(sgn(fJ)g, 0),

Then af = lal sgn(a)f = lalf;t - lalf;;, fJg = lfJI sgn(fJ)g = lfJigt - lfJig(i,

Now we show that p,(af) = ap,(f). Let j+ = max(!, 0) and f- = max(- j, 0). 
If a 2': 0, then p,(af) = p,(aj+ - af-) = ap,(J+) - ap,(f-) = ap,(f). If 
a< 0, then p,(af) = p,( -af- - ( -aj+)) = -ap,(f-)- ( -a)p,(J+) = ap,(f). 
Similarly, we can show that p,(f3g) = f3p,(g). Therefore, Equation (6.21) is true.

we can show that J-L(f;;) ---+ J-L(f-). Thus, by Problem 6.18, we have J-L(IJ;t -
J+ I) ---+ 0 and J-L(IJ;; - f-1) ---+ 0. But 
J-L(Ifn- !I) 
J-L(IJ;t- J;;- t+ + rl) 
:::; 
J-L(IJ;t- t+l) + J-L(IJ;;- rl). 
Therefore, J-L(Ifn - fl) ---+ 0. This completes the proof. 
6.20. First, we consider the case when h = IB forB E B. In this case, we have 
J-L(h of)= { h(f(s))J-L(ds) = 
{ 
1J-L(ds) = J-LU E B), 
(6.22) 
J 
S 
}{fEB} 
and 
At(h) = l h(x)At(dx) = l1At(dx) = At(B). 
(6.23) 
Suppose that h o f E L 1 (S, L-, J-L). Then, from Equation (6.22), we have J-L(f E 
B) < oo. By the definition of At, At(B) = J-L(f E B), and so J-L(h of) = At(h). 
Therefore, At(h) < oo, and soh E L 1(R,B,At). Similarly, we can show that 
hof E L1(S,L-,J-L) ifh E L 1(R,B,At)· 
Next, we consider the case when h is a simple B-measurable function. By Prob-
lem 6.1, we can write h as 
n 
h= LbJBi, 
i=l 
where bi > 0 and Bi E B (i = 1, 2, ... , n) are pairwise disjoint. Then, by Problem 
6.3 and Equation (6.22), we have 
J-L(h 0 f) 
i=l 
n 
LbiJ-L(f E Bi), 
(6.24) 
i=l 
and 
At(h) =At (~ bJBi) = ~ 
biAt(IBJ = ~ 
biAt(Bi)· 
(6.25) 
Since, by definition of At, J-LU E Bi) = At(Bi), we have J-L(h of) = At(h). 
Therefore, h of E L 1(S, L-, J-L) if and only if hE L 1(R, .%, At). 
Next, we consider the case when his a nonnegative B-measurable function. Then, 
by Problem 5.11, there exists a sequence hn ( n ;::: 1) of simple functions such that

hn t h. Since hnof t hof andJL(hnof) = At(hn) forn?: 1, we have, by Theorem 
6.2, JL(hn of) t JL(h of) and At(hn) t At(h). Therefore, JL(h of) = At(h) and 
so that h of E L 1(S, E, J.L) if and only if hE £ 1 (R, $,At). 
Finally, we consider the case when h is a B-measurable function. Then h o f = 
h+ o f - h- o J, where h+ = max(h, 0) and h- = max( -h, 0). We have al-
ready shown that JL(h+ of) = At(h+) and JL(h- of) = At(h-). If h of E 
L 1(S, E, J.L), then h+ of and h- of are in L1(S, E, J.L). Accordingly, h+ and h-
are in £ 1 (R, B, A 1) and so is h. Similarly, we can show that h E £1 (R, B, A f) if 
hof E L 1 (S,E,J.L). 
This completes the proof. 
6.21. Let 9n = 2:::~ 1 hi. Since hn E (mE)+ for all n?: 1, we have 9n E (mE)+ 
for all n ?: 1. Since 9n t 2::::1 hi, the result follows from Theorem 6.2 and Problem 
6.17. 
6.22. 
(a) If Is hdJL = oo, then Is gndJL = oo for all n ?: 1 and Is gdJL = oo. If 
Is hdJL < oo, then his finite a.e. by Problem 6.15. Let A= {s E S: lh(s)l = 
oo }. Then J.L(A) = 0. Also we have 9n- h?: 0 on S\A and 9n- h t g- h on 
S\A. By Theorem 6.2, Is\A (gn- h)dJ.L t Is\A (g- h)dJ.L. Since JL(A) = 0, 
we have Is(9n- h)dJ.L t Is(g- h)dJ.L. Since Is hdJL is finite, the result follows 
from Problem 6.17. 
(b) From the assumption, we have Is -hdJL > -oo, -gn ?: -h for n ?: 1, and 
-gn t -g. Hence the result follows from part (a) of this proof. 
6.23. Let F ( t) and G ( t) be defined as 
F(t) =lot f(s)ds, 
G(t) =lot f(s)g(s)ds. 
Then by the assumption, we have 
:t [e-F(t)G(t)] = f(t)e-F(t)(g(t)- G(t))::; af(t)e-F(t)_ 
Integrating the first and the last terms in this equation gives 
e-F(t)Q(t) :S a ( 1 - e-F(t)) , 'it E [0, T], 
which leads to 
G(t) ::; a ( eF(t) - 1) . 
Again by the assumption, we have 
g(t) ::; a+ G(t) ::; aeF(t). 
This completes the proof.

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced Lebesgue integration. To construct the Lebesgue in-
tegral, we first deal with nonnegative simple functions, which are Borel measurable 
and take on only finitely many distinct values. Then we consider general nonnega-
tive measurable functions. Finally we define the integration for general measurable 
functions. For more information about Lebesgue integration, readers are referred 
to Williams (1991) and Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999). Lebesgue integration on the 
real line is introduced in many books on real analysis such as Wheeden and Zygmund 
(1977), Royden (1988), and Yeh (2006). 
The Lebesgue integration is more general than the Riemann integration (Royden, 
1988, Section 4.1 ). For a comparison of Lebesgue and Riemann integrals, readers 
are referred to Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999, Section 1.7).

ory and has important applications in modem probability theory. For example, the 
Radon-Nikodym theorem can be used to prove the existence of conditional expecta-
tions (Klenke, 2006). In this chapter, we present some concepts and results related 
to this theorem.

and f-l2 are said to be mutually singular, denoted by /-li l_ f-l2, if and only if there 
exists a set A E I: such that /-li (A) = 0 and f-l2(Ac) = 0. The two signed measures

7.4 Solutions 
7.1. Let A E I:. Since AnD ~ A, we only need to show that .X( B) ::; .X( An D)

.X(B n D)::; .X(B n D)+ .X((A\B) n D)= .X( An D). Hence V(A) =.X( An D). 
Similarly, we can show that .X- (A) = .X(A n De). 
7.2. First let us calculate the measure .x+. By definition, we have 
.x+(A) = sup{.A(B): BE B, B ~A}

we have).. +(A) = 111 (A\ {0}) for all A E B. Similarly, we have)..- (A) = 111 (R)-
111 ( { 0}) if 0 E A and ).. - (A) = 0 if 0 ~ A. 
7.3. 
(a) Suppose that >.(An D) < 0 for some A E ~- Note that >.(D) = >-.(DnA) + 
>-.(DnA c). By the assumption that).. is bounded above, we have >.(DnA c) = 
>.(D) - >-.(DnA) > >.(D). However, this contradicts the assumption that D 
is a set on which).. attains its maximum. Hence >.(An D) ~ 0 for all A E ~­
Similarly, we can show that >.(An De) :::; 0. 
(b) Let A E ~- To show that >.+(A) = >.(An D), we only need to show that 
>.(B) :::; >.(An D) for all B ~ A and B E ~- In fact, by the result of part 
(a), we have >.(B) = >-.(B n D) + >-.(B n De) :::; >-.(B n D) :::; >-.(B n D) + 
>-.((A\B) n D)= >.(An D). Similarly, we have >.-(A)= ->.(An De). This 
completes the proof.

Since 2::~= 1 1>-.(Bi)l is bounded above by 1>-.I(A) and can reach 1>-.I(A) for some

82 
THE RADON-NIKODYM THEOREM 
(b) Let A E ~be an arbitrary set. By part (a) of this problem, we have 
n

n

IAli(A) + IA2I(A). 
Since A is arbitrary, the result follows. 
This completes the proof. 
7.5. 
(a) Since A1 ..l fl and A2 ..l fl, we have fl(A) = fl(B) = 0 and IA1I(Ae) = 
IA2 1 (Be) = 0 for some A E ~ and B E ~. Noting that fl is a measure, we 
have 0 :S: fl(A U B) :S: fl(A) + fl(B) = 0, which implies that fl(A U B) = 0. 
By Problem 7.4 and noting that IA1 + A2l, IA1I, and IA21 are measures, we have 
0 :s; IAl + A21((A u Bn = IAl + A21(N n Be) :s; IAli(Ac n Be)+ IA2I(Ac n 
Be) :S: IA1I (A c)+ IA2I (Be) = 0, which implies that IA1 + A2l ((AU B)c) = 0. 
Hence A1 + A2 ..l fl. 
(b) Let fl(A) = 0. By Problem 7.3, we have Xt = A1 (An D) and X[ = A1 (An 
De) for some set D E ~. where At and A2 are the upper variation and lower 
variation of A1, respectively. Since AnD <;;;; A, we have fl( AnD) = 0. By the 
assumption that A1 « fl, we have A1 (An D) = 0. Hence At « fl. Similarly, 
we have A[ «fl. Hence IA1I «fl. 
(c) Let fl(A) = 0. Then IA1I(A) = 0. Noting that IA11 = At + A[, we have 
At(A) = 0 and A[(A) = 0. Thus A1(A) = At(A)- A[(A) = 0. Therefore, 
Al « fL. 
(d) By assumption, we have fl(A) = IA2I(Ac) = 0 for some A E ~. By part (b) 
of this problem and the assumption that A1 « fl, we have IA11 « fl. Thus 
IA1I(A) = 0. Hence A1 ..l A2. 
(e) By part (d) of this problem, we have A1 ..l A1, which implies that IA1I(A) = 
IA1I(Ac) = 0 for some A E 
~. Therefore, IA1I(S) = 0. It follows that 
At (S) = A[ (S) = 0. Hence A1 (B) = 0 for all B E ~.

(f) First we prove the "if' part. Suppose that JL(A) = 0 and 
lim 
.A1 (B) = 0. 
!L(B)-tO 
We need to show that ,\1 (A) = 0. To do this, we let Bn = A for n = 1, 2, .... 
Then by assumption we have A1 (A) = lim!L(Bn)-+O ,\1 (Bn) = 0. Hence ,\1 « 
JL. 
Then we prove the "only if' part. Suppose that ,\1 « JL. We need to show that 
lim!L(B)-+O .A1(B) = 0. Since I.A1(B)I::; I.A1I(B) for all BEE, we only need 
to show that limn-too I.AII(An) = 0, where JL(An) -t 0 as n -too. To do this, 
we only need to show that lim sup I .Ail (An) = 0. If lim sup I .Ail (An) =f. 0, then 
there exists some E > 0 such that supi~j I.A1I(Ai) ~ 2E for all j ~ 1. Hence 
there are infinitely many An such that I.AII(An) ~E. Noting also that JL(An) -t 
0 as n -t oo, we can find a subsequence {Bn}n~l from {An}n~l such that 
JL(Bn) ::; 2-n and I.AII(Bn) ~ E. Then I::'=l JL(Bn) < oo. By Theorem 
2.2, we have JL(limsupBn) = 0. By part (b), we have I.A1I(limsupBn) = 0. 
However, I.AII(U~1 (Bi) ~ I.AII(Bj) ~ E for all j ~ 1. By Problem 2.18 
and the assumption that ,\1 is finite, we have I.AII(limsupBn) ~ E, which 
contradicts I.AII(limsupBn) = 0. Thus lim!L(B)-+0 I.AII(B) = 0. 
This completes the proof. 
7.6. First let us prove the necessity ("only if') part. Suppose that Q'"" P. Since 
0 ::; Q{g ::; 0} = J 
gdP ::; 0, 
{gS:O} 
we have Q{g ::; 0} = 0. By the assumption that Q'"" P, we have P{g ::; 0} = 0, 
which gives P{g > 0} = 1. 
Now we prove the sufficiency part. Suppose that P{g > 0} = 1. We need to 
show that P is absolutely continuous relative to Q. To do that, let A E § such that 
Q(A) = 0. Note that 
Q(A) = { gdP = { 
gdP. 
jA 
JAn{g>O} 
Then by Problem 6.8, P(A n {g > 0}) = 0. Since P{g > 0} = 1, we have 
P(A n {g > 0}) = P(A) + P{g > 0}- P(A U {g > 0}) ~ P(A). 
Hence P(A) = 0. Since A is arbitrary, Pis absolutely continuous relative to Q. 
This finishes the proof.

8.4 Solutions 
8.1. We first show, for a E (0, 1) and z ~ 1, that 
z"' - 1 :S: a(z- 1), 
(8.7) 
and the equality in (8.7) holds if and only if z = 1. To do this, consider the function 
<p(z) = a(z- 1) - z"' + 1. The derivative of this function is <p1 (z) = a(1 - z"'- 1 ). 
Since <p'(z) > 0 for z > 1, <p(z) is strictly increasing in (1, oo). Noting that <p(l) = 
0, we have <p(z) > 0 for z > 1. 
Now suppose that x ~ y (since x andy are symmetric, we can do tllis) and let 
z = xjy. Then 
which, after some algebraic manipulation, is 
x"'y13 :S: ax+ (3y, 
and the equality holds if and only if xjy = 1 or x = y. 
8.2. If f = 0 or g = 0, then both sides of (8.2) are equal to zero. If f ::/= 0 and 
g ::f. 0, then, by Problem 8.1, we have 
Therefore (8.2) follows from integrating botll sides of the above equation over S and 
the equality in (8.2) holds if and only if 
or IJIP = clglq (a.e.), where 
This completes the proof. 
8.3. Let 
Then 
Is lfiPd~-t 
c = Is lglqdf-t. 

SOLUTIONS

Note that f'(x) = p[(a + x)P-1 - (2x)P-1]. Hence 
{ 
> 0 if 0 ::::; x < a; 
f'(x) 
= 0 ifx =a; 
< 0 ifx >a, 
which implies that f(x) is maximized at x =a. Therefore 
f(b) =(a+ b)P- 2P- 1(aP + bP)::::; f(a) = 0. 
This completes the proof. 
8.4. Iff+ g = 0, then (8.3) is true. Suppose that f + g =f. 0 and let q = pf(p- 1). 
Then (p- 1)q = p and, by Theorem 8.1, we get

is If+ glp-1lfldJL::::; (is IJIPdJL)" (is If+ giCp-1)qdJL) •

(8.10) 
::::; (is If+ giPdJL) q (IIJIIP + llgllp). 
Dividing (8.10) by (f8 If+ giPdJL)i gives (8.3). In addition, the equality in (8.3) 
holds if and only if the equalities in Equations (8.8)-(8.10) hold. Therefore If+ gl = 
IJI + lgl (a.e.) and, by Theorem 8.1, If+ giP = If+ gl(p-1)q = c1IJIP = c2lgiP 
(a.e.) for some constants c1, c2 E (0, oo ). Accordingly, f = >..g (a.e.) for some 
).. E (0, oo). 
8.5. 
Since p < r, rjp > 1. Let q = r/(r- p). Then 1/(r/p) + 1/q = 1. Let 
f E U(S, E, JL). Then, by Theorem 8.1, we obtain 
Noting that JL(S) < oo and f E U(S, E, JL), we have 
is lfiPdJL < 00.

Thus f E LP(S, 'E, J.L). This completes the proof. 
8.6. First, we consider p E ( 0, oo). Then 
laf + bgiP ::::; (iafl + lbgi)P 
::::; [2max(iafl, lbgi)]P 
::::; 2P(iafiP + lbgiP) 
= l2aiPIJIP + I2WigiP. 
The result follows by integrating the above equation. 
Next, we consider p = oo. By definition, there exist constants K 1 < oo and 
K2 < oo such that J.L(Ifl > Kl) = 0 and J.L(Igl > K2) = 0. Then J.L(iaf + bgl > 
k)::::; J.L(iafl+lbgl > K)::::; J.L(Ifl > Kl)+J.L(Igl > K2) = Ofor K > !aiKI+IbiK2. 
Hence af + bg E U)0 (S, 'E, J.L). 
8.7. 
Since J.L(f -1- f) = J.L(0) = 0 for f E LP(S, 'E, J.L), f "' f. Iff "' g, then 
J.LU -1- g) = 0. But J.L(g -1- f) = J.LU -1- g) = 0. Hence g rv f. Suppose that 
f "'g and g"' h for j, g, hE LP(S, 'E, J.L). Then J.L(f -1- g) = 0 and J.L(g -1- h) = 0. 
Since {f = g} n {g = h} ~ {f = h}, {f -1- h} ~ {f -1- g} U {g -1- h}, and so 
J.LU -1- h) ::::; J.LU -1- g) + J.L(g -1- h) = 0. Hence f rv h. Thus rv is an equivalent 
relation. 
8.8. 
Since functions in an equivalence class are equivalent, dp is well defined. 
Since dp([f], [g]) = llf - giiP = llg - fliP = dp([g], [!]), symmetry holds. Let 
j, g, h E LP(S, 'E, J.L). Since 
II!- glh =is If- gldJ.L::::; is (If- hi+ lg- hl)dJ.L =II!- hll1 + llg- hll1, 
and, by Theorem 8.1, 
II!- gllp ::::; II!- hllp + llg- hllp, 
P > 1, 
we have dp([f], [g]) ::::; dp([f], [h]) + dp([g], [h]). Suppose that dp([f], [g]) = 0. 
Then, by Problem 6.8, f = g a.e. and so [!] = [g]. Suppose that[!] = [g]. Then 
f = g a.e. and so dp([j], [g]) = llf - giiP = 0. Therefore, dp is a metric on 
LP(S, 'E, J.L). 
8.9. By definition of the inner product, we obtain 
IIU +VII~+ IIU- VII~

8.10. 
Let {fn}n~I be a Cauchy sequence in (LP(S, 'E, J.L), dp)· We need to show 
that there exists a function f E (LP(S, 'E, J.L), dp) such that 
lim llfn -fliP = 0.

SOLUTIONS

First, we show that there exists a subsequence {nk}k;:::l such that Unkh2:1 con-
verges (a.e.) to a limit function f. To do this, let Ek = 2-(p+l)k and 8k = 2-k for 
k 2:: 1. Since Un}n;:::l is a Cauchy sequence, for each k 2:: 1, there exists an integer 
nk such that 
is lfr - fs I Pdp, < Ek, 
for all r, s 2:: nk. 
Let Ak = {lfnk+l - fnk I 2:: 8k} fork 2:: 1. Then 
p,(Ak) = { 1dp,

which implies L:~=l p,(Ak) < oo. By Theorem 2.2, p,(A) = 0, where A = 
limsupAk. Then for s E Ac, there exists an integer ks such that s E Ak for all 
k 2:: k 8 , and so 
Thus {fnk (s)}k;:::1 converges in R. Let

Thus fnk - f E LP(S, E, p,). Since fnk E LP(S, E, p,), by Problem 8.6, f E

Next, we show that

The result in (8.14) follows by letting k ---+ oo in the above inequality. This completes

8.11. Let {Yn}n;::1 be a sequence inK such that

Since ~(Yr + Ys) E K, IIX- ~(Yr + Ys)ll2 2 .6.. Let E > 0. Choose N, EN such 
that 
Then for r, s 2 N,, we have 
which gives II ~(Yr - Ys) ll2 < E. Thus {Yn}n;::l is a Cauchy sequence inK. Since 
K is complete, there exists a Y E K such that 
llYn - Yll2 ---+ 0. 
Since, by Theorem 8.2, IIX- Yll2 ~ IIX- Yn ll2 +llYn- Yll2, we have IIX- Yll2 = 
.6.. 
Now we show that Equations (8.4) and (8.5) are equivalent. Suppose that Y E K 
satisfies IIX- Yll2 = .6.. Then for any Z E K, we have Y + tZ E K fort E R. 
Thus IIX - Y - tZII2 2 IIX - Yll2· Note that IIX - Y- tZII~ = IIX -
Yll~ -
2t(X- Y, Z) + t 2 IIZII~, we have 
-2t(X- Y, Z) + t2 IIZII~ 2 0, 
t E R. 
Therefore (X - Y, Z) = 0. Suppose that Y satisfies (8.5), that is, X - Y .l Z for 
all Z E K. Then for any Z E K, we have Y - Z E K, and so (X - Y, Y - Z) = 0. 
Thus 
IIX- Zll~ = IIX- Yll~ + IIY- Zll~ 2 IIX- Yll~, vz E K, 
which gives (8.4). 
If Y, Y E K satisfy (8.5), then 
(X- Y, Z) = 0, 
(X- Y, Z) = 0, vz E K, 
and so (Y-Y, Z) = 0 for all Z E K. Since Y- Y E K, we have (Y-Y, Y- Y) = 
0, which implies Y = Y a.e. This completes the proof.

8.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced basic concepts of £P spaces and some inequalities such 
as the HOlder's inequality, Minkowski's inequality, and Schwarz's inequality. LP 
spaces are covered by books on functional analysis, measure theory, and probability 
theory. For example, readers can find more information on £P spaces in Williams 
(1991), Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999), Athreya and Lahiri (2006), and Capinski and 
Kopp (2007). 


CHAPTER 9 
CONVERGENCE 
In measure theory, there exist several different notions of convergence of measurable 
functions, for example, convergence almost everywhere, convergence in measure, 
convergence in £P, to just name a few. In this chapter, we present definitions of 
some common notions of convergence. 
9.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 9.1 (Convergence in Measure). Let J, JI, h, · · · be Borel measurable 
functions on a measure space (S, I;, f.L). The sequence {fn}n>l is said to converge 
to f in measure, written as f n 4 f, if and only if for every E > 0, f.L{ 8 : If n ( 8) -
f(8)1 ~ €}--+ 0 as n--+ oo. 
In particular, if f.L is a probability measure, then convergence in measure is also 
referred to as convergence in probability. 
Definition 9.2 (Convergence in £P). Let f be a Borel measurable function on a 
measure space (S, I;, f.L) and {fn}n~l a sequence of of functions in LP(S, I;, f.L).

Definition 9.3 (Uniform Convergence). Let f, fl, h, ... be Borel measurable func-
tions on a measure space (S, E, p,) and B E E. The sequence {fn}n>l is said to 
converge to f uniformly on B if and only if for every E > 0, there exists an N E N 
such that lfn(s)- f(s)i < E for all s E Band n 2:: N. 
Definition 9.4 (Almost Uniform Convergence). Let f, fl, h, ... be Borel measur-
able functions on a measure space (S, E, p,). The sequence {fn}n>l is said to con-
verge to f almost uniformly if and only if for a given E > 0, there is a set A E E 
such that p,(A) < E and fn -+ f uniformly on A c. 
Definition 9.5 (Almost Everywhere Convergence). Let f, h, h, ... be Borel mea-
surable functions on a measure space (S, E, p,). The sequence Un}n2;:l is said to 
converge to f almost everywhere, written as f n ~ 
f, if and only if there is a set 
A E E such that fn-+ f on A and p,(Ac) = p,(S\A) = 0. 
Definition 9.6 (Uniform Integrability). Let {fihEI be a collection of Borel measur-
able functions on the measure space (S, E, p,), where p, is finite and I is an index set 
(countable or uncountable). The fi are said to be uniformly integrable if and only if

9.4 Solutions 
9.1. Let E > 0. Then by Problem 6.16, we have 
tt{s: lfn(s)- f(s)l ~ E}:::; ~ r lfn(s)- f(s)IPdft. 
E ls 
By assumption, we have fs lfn(s) - f(s)IPdtt -+ 0 as n -+ oo. Thus we have 
tt{s: lfn(s)- f(s)l ~ E}-+ 0 as n-+ oo. This completes the proof. 
9.2. First, we show that fn -+ fin measure. Let E > 0. By definition, we only need 
to show that tt{s: lfn(s)- f(s)l ~ E}-+ 0 as n-+ oo. To do this, we only need to 
show that for every k > 1, there exists an integer Nk such that 
1 
tt{s: lfn(s)- f(s)l ~ E} < k 
for all n ~ Nk. By assumption that fn -+ f almost uniformly, for every k > 1 
there exists a set Ak E :E such that fn -+ f uniformly on Ak and tt(Ak) < 1/k. By 
Definition 9.3, there exists an Nk such that lfn(s)- f(s)l <Eon Ak for all n ~ Nk. 
Hence the result follows since tt{s: lfn(s)- f(s)l ~ E} = tt(Ak) < 1/k for all 
n~Nk. 
Next, we show that fn -+ f almost everywhere. Let Ak (k ~ 1) be the sets 
mentioned in the first part of this proof and B = U%':1 Ak. Then fn -+ f on B. 
Noting that tt(Bc) = tt(n%':1 Ak) :::; tt(Ak) < 1/k, we have tt(Bc) = if we let 
k -+ oo. Hence f n -+ f almost everywhere. 
9.3. First, we prove the "if" part. Suppose that for every 8 > 0, 
ft CQn {s: lfk(s)- f(s)l ~ 8}) -+ 0 as n-+ oo. 
Let Am = n~=1 U%:n{s: lfk(s)- f(s)l ~ 1/m} form= 1, 2, .... Then we 
have tt(Am) = 0 for all m ~ 1. Now let A = U:=1 Am. Then 0 :::; tt(A) :::; 
2::=1 tt(Am) = 0, implying that tt(A) = 0. The result follows if we show that 
fn-+ f on A c. To do this, JetE> 0 and tEA c. Then tEA;, for all m ~ 1. Hence 
t E A~, where r E Nand r > 1/E. Therefore, t E n%:nr {s : lfk(s)- f(s)l < 
1/r < E} for some nr ~ 1, which means that lfk(t) - f(t)l < E for all k ~ nr. 
Since E and t are arbitrary, we have f n -+ f on A c. 
Now we prove the "only if' part. Suppose that fn -+ f almost everywhere. Then 
there exists a set A E :E such that tt(A) = 0 and fn -+ f on A c. Let 8 > 0. Then 
for every t E Ac, there exists an integer Nt,i5 such that lfk(t) - f(t)l < 8 for all 
k ~ Nt,i5· Hence t E U~ 1 n%:n{s: lfk(s)- f(s)l < 8}. Since tis arbitrary, 
we have Ac <;;; U~= 1 n~=n{s: lfk(s)- f(s)l < 8}. Noting that tt is finite, we 
tt(S) ~ tt(U~= 1 n%:n{s: l!k(s)- f(s)l < 8}) ~ tt(Ac) = tt(S)- tt(A) = 
tt(S), implying that tt(U~=1 n~=n{s: l!k(s)- f(s)l < 8}) = tt(S). Therefore, 
tt(n~= 1 U%':n{s: lfk(s)- f(s)l ~ 8}) = 0. ButU~=n{s: lfk(s)- f(s)l ~ 8} -1-

n~=l U~=n{s: lfk(s)- f(s)l :2: J} as n-+ oo. The result follows from Problem 
2.18. 
9.4. Since J.L is finite and fn -+ f a.e., by Problem 9.3 we have for every J > 0, 
J.L CQn {s: lfk(s)- f(s)l :2: J}) -+ 0 
as n-+ oo. 
Let E > 0. Then for every m :2: 1, there exists an integer Nm such that J.L(Am) < 
E/2m, where 
00

Am= U {s: lfk(s)- f(s)l :2: m}. 
k=N-m 
Define A= U:=l Am. Then J.L(A) < E. 
Now we show that fn -+ f uniformly on A c. To do this, let() > 0. Choose mo 
such that ( 1 / mo) < (). Then for all m :2: N mo and s E A c, we have If m ( s) - f ( s) I < 
....!... <().Hence fn-+ f uniformly on A c. This completes the proof.

{s: f(s) -::J g(s)} = U {s: lf(s)- g(s)l :2: k}.

Since lf(s)- g(s)l ~ lfn(S)- f(s)l + lfn(s)- g(s)l, we have

{s: lf(s)-g(s)l :2: k} ~ {s: lfn(s)-f(s)l :2: 2k}U{s: lfn(s)-g(s)l :2: 2k}. 
By assumption, for every k :2: 1, there exists an integer Nk such that J.L{ s : lfn(S)-
f(s)l :2: A} < zk'+, and J.L{s : lfn(S)- g(s)l :2: 21k} < zk'+l for all n :2: Nk. 
Then we have J.L{s: lf(s)- g(s)l :2: -!-}<~-Therefore, J.LU -::J g)~ L::~=l J.L{s: 
lf(s)- g(s)l :2: -!-} <E. Since E is arbitrary, we have J.LU -::J g)= 0. This completes 
the proof.

Hence {fn}n;:>l is Cauchy in measure. Then for each positive integer k, we can 
choose an integer N k such that N k+ 1 > N k and 
Let gk =iNk' k = 1, 2, .... Then 
1L { jgk ~ gk+ll :;:, 2~} < 21k, 
k :;:, 1. 
Let A = lim sup Ak. where Ak = { jgk ~ gk+ 1 j :;:. 1 /2k}. Then by Theorem 
2.2, we have IL(A) = 0. 
If 8 ¢c A, then 8 E Ak for only finitely many k. Hence 8 ¢c Ak fork :;:. M 8 for 
some M 8 • Therefore, jgk(8) ~ gk+1(8)j < 1/2k fork:;:. M 8 • Thus {gk(8)}k;:>l 
converges to a limit g(8). Since IL(A) = 0, we have gk ~g. 
Now we show that gk converges tog almost uniformly. Let o > 0 and Bn = 
U%':n Ak. Then we can choose a large integer r such that

IL(Br) $ L IL(Ak) = 2r-l < 0·

By Theorem 9.1, gk converges tog uniformly. Since o is arbitrary, gk converges 
to g almost uniformly. 
By assumption, we have fn ~ f. Hence gk ~ f. By Problem 9.2, we have 
gk ~g. Thus, by Problem 9.5, we have f = g a.e. 
(b) This part follows from part (a) and Problem 9.2. 
9.7. First let us prove the "if" part. Suppose that, for each E > 0, we have 
Let TJ > 0 and o > 0. Then there exists an N,7 such that

lim f n exists a. e.

Figure 9.1 
Relationships of several types of convergence, where a.u and a.e. mean almost 
uniform convergence and almost everywhere convergence, respectively. 
Convergence in LP is stronger than convergence in measure. Almost uniform 
convergence is stronger than both convergence in measure and almost everywhere 
convergence. Convergence in measure does not necessarily lead to almost uniform 
convergence. However, if a sequence is convergent in measure, then there is a sub-
sequence that is convergent almost uniformly to the same limit function. If the un-
derlying measure is finite, then almost everywhere convergence implies almost uni-
form convergence. More information about convergence can be found in Ash and 
Doleans-Dade (1999, Section 2.5) and Lawler (2006).

of n-system (Definition 2.15). 
10.2. Use the definition of measurable functions (Definition 5.3). 
10.4. For part (a), consider mapping Tx : s2 ---+ s1 X s2. For part (b), consider the

To prove part (c), use Theorem 3.2. 
10.7. To prove part (a), use the result of Problem 10.5 and Theorem 5.1. Use the

10.8. 
To prove the "if' part, use the definition of infinite products (Definition 
10.4) and the result of 5.4. The "only if" part can be proved by considering special 
rectangles. 
1 0.4 Solutions 
10.1. Let A1 x A2 E I and B1 x B2 E I. Since 
we have (A1 x A2) n (B1 x B2) E I. Hence I is an-system. 
10.2. We show that p1 is ~ 1 lSI ~2 /~ 1 -measurable. By the definition of p1, we have 
P11(Bl) = B1 x S2, 
B1 E ~1· 
By the definition of ~1 lSI ~2. we have B1 X s2 E ~1 lSI ~2 for B1 E ~1- Therefore, 
P11 (Bl) E ~1 lSI ~2 for B1 E ~1; that is, P1 is ~1 lSI ~2/~1-measurable. Similarly, 
we can show that P2 is ~1 lSI ~2/~2-measurable. 
10.3. We will prove ~1 lSI ~2 = a(p1,P2) by showing that ~1 lSI ~2 ~ a(p1,P2) 
and a(p1, P2) ~ ~1 lSI ~2· To show that ~1 lSI ~2 ~ a(p1, P2), we let A1 E ~1 and 

SOLUTIONS 
119 
A2 E E2. Note that A1 x A2 = (A1 x S2) n (S1 x A2) and A1 x S2 = P11(Al) E 
a(p1,P2) and S1 X A2 = P21(A2) E a(p1,p2), we have A1 x A2 E a(p1,P2). 
Therefore, E1 0 E2 ~ a(p1,P2). 
Now we show that a(p1,p2) ~ E1 0 E2. But given P11(Al) = A1 x S2 E 
E1 0 E2 and P21(A2) = S1 x A1 E E1 0 E2 for all A1 E E1 and A2 E E2, we 
have a(p1, P2) ~ E1 0 E2. This completes the proof. 
10.4. 
(a) Let X E s1 be fixed. We consider the mapping Tx : s2 -+ s1 X s2 defined by 
Tx(Y) = (x, y). If E = A1 x A2 is a measurable rectangle, then 
r-1(E) = {A2 if x E A1; 
X 
0 
if X rJ_ A1, 
and so rx- 1 (E) E E2. Noting that E1 0 E2 is generated by all measurable 
rectangles, we have, by Problem 5.4, Tx is E2/E1 0 E2-measurable. It follows 
that Ex = Tx- 1(E) E E2 forE E E1 0 E2; that is, Ex is E2-measurable. 
Similarly, we can show that for each fixed y the set Ey is E1-measurable. 
(b) Now we show that fx is E2-measurable. To do this, let B E B. Then J;1 (B) = 
{y E S2 : fx(Y) E B} = {y E S2 : f(x, y) E B}. Since f is E1 0 E2-
measurable, we have EB = {(x, y) E S1 x S2 : f(x, y) E B} = f-1(B) E 
E1 0 E2. Noting that J;1(B) = {y E S2: (x, y) E EB}, we have, by the first 
part of this proof, J;1 (B) E E2. Hence fx is E2-measurable. Similarly, we 
can show that fy is E1-measurable for fixed y. 
10.5. 
(a) Let E E E1 0 E2. By Problem 10.4, for fixed x E S1 the set {y E S2 : 
(x, y) E E} is E2-measurable. Therefore, the function gE,1 is well defined. By 
hypothesis, f..l2 is finite. Then gE,1(x)::; M2(S2) < oo and so gE, 1 is bounded. 
Similarly, gE,2 is well defined and bounded. 
(b) Now we show that £1 = E1 0 E2. First, we show that £1 is ad-system on 
s1 X S2. Sincegslxs2,1(x) = f..l2({y E s2: (x,y) E sl X S2}) = f..l2(S2) for 
x E S1, forB E B 
and so g81\s2,1 E E1. Hence gsl xS2,1 is E1-measurable, and so s1 X s2 E £1. 
LetE1, E2 E £1 andE1 ~ E2. ThengE1,1(x) andgE2,1(x) are E1-measurable. 
Since 
gE2\E1,1(x) = f..l2({y E S2: (x,y) E E2\El}) 
= f..l2({y E S2: (x,y) E E2}\{y E S2: (x,y) E E1}) 
= f..l2({y E S2: (x,y) E E2})- f..l2({y E S2: (x,y) EEl}) 
= gE2,1 (x) - gE1,1 (x), 

120 
PRODUCT MEASURES 
9E2 \E1,I(x) is I:t-measurable. Therefore, E2\Et E Ct. Let En E Ct (n 2: 1) 
and En t E. Then {y E 82 : (x,y) E En} t {y E 82 : (x,y) E E}. By 
Theorem2.1,gen,t(x) = J12({y E 82: (x,y) E En}) t 9E,t(x) = J12({y E 
82 : (x, y) E E} ). By Problem 5.9, 9E,t (x) is I:rmeasurable. Hence E E Ct. 
Therefore, Ct is ad-system on 8t x 82. 
Next, we show that Ct contains all measurable rectangles in the product space 
8t x 82. Let E =At x A2 be a measurable rectangle. Then 9E,t (x) = 112( {y E 
82 : (x, y) E At x A2}) = IA 1 (x)112(A2) and so 9E,t (x) is I:t-measurable. 
Hence E E Ct. 
By Problem 10.1, the collection I of all measurable rectangles is an-system. 
By definition, I:t ® I:2 = a(I). Recall that Ct is ad-system. Then, by Problem 
2.7, I:t ® I:2 = a(I) = d(I) ~ Ct. By the definition of Ct, we have Ct ~ 
I:t ® I:2. Therefore, Ct = I:t ® I:2. Similarly, we can show that C2 = I:t ® I:2. 
This completes the proof. 
10.6. First, we show that Bt is a finite measure. By the definition of Bt, we have 
Bt 2: 0 and Bt(0) = fs 1 J12(0)JLt(dx) = fs 1 OJLt(dx) = 0. Let En (n 2: 1) be a 
sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in I: t ® I:2. Let f n : 8 t ---+ R and f : 8 t ---+ R be 
defined as 
f n ( x) = J12 ( { y E 82 : ( x, y) E Q 
Ei}) , 
n E N, 
f(x) = 112 ( { y E 82 : (x, y) E Q 
Ei}) , 
n EN. 
Then f n t f and, by Theorem 6.2, we obtain 
But, by Problem 6.12, we have 
From equation ( 10.4 ), we have 
and so 

SOLUTIONS 
121 
Therefore, el is a measure on (Sl X s2, I;l 0 I;2). Since /-ll and /-l2 are finite and 
B1 (S1 x S2) = /-ll (St)f-l2(S2) < oo, we see that B1 is finite. Similarly, we can show 
that e2 is a finite measure on (Sl X S2, I;l 0 I;2)· 
Next, let E = A1 x A2 be a measurable rectangle. Then 
B1(E) = { /-l2({y E S2: (x,y) E A1 x A2})/-l1(dx) 
ls, 
= r IA,(X)f..l2(A2)/-ll(dx) 
ls, 
= /-l1(A1)/-l2(A2). 
Similarly, we have B2(E) = f-l1(At)f..l2(A2)· 
Finally, we show that B1(E) = B2(E) forE E I;l 0 I;2· Since B1(E) = B2(E) 
for every E E I, where I is the collection of all measurable rectangles in the product 
space sl X S2, and I;l 0 I;2 = a(I), the equality of el and e2 on I;l 0 I;2 follows 
from Theorem 3.2. 
10.7. By hypothesis, /-ll and f-l2 are a-finite. Let Cn (n ;:::: 1) and Dm (m ;:::: 1) be 
decompositions of S1 and S2 into sets of finite measure, and let /-ln,1 (C) = /-ll ( C n 
Cn) forCE S1 and /-lm,2(D) = /-l2(D n Dm) forD E 82. 
(a) Let E E I;1 0 I;2. Since 
9E,l(x) = /-l2({y E 82: (x,y) E E}) 
= /-l2 (Q1({y E 82: (x,y) E E} nDm)) 
00 
(10.5) 
= L /-l2({y E s2: (x,y) E E} n Dm) 
m=l 
00 
= L /-lm,2({y E s2: (x,y) E E}), 
m=l 
by Problem 10.5 and Theorem 5.1, 9E,l (x) is well defined and I;1-measurable. 
Similarly, 9E,2(Y) is well defined and I;2-measurable. 

122

(b) By Equation (10.5) and Theorem 6.2, we have 
B1(E) = { 9E,l(x)J.Ll(dx)

By Problem 10.6, Bm,n,l and Bm,n2 are measures on sl X s2. Therefore, (}1 (E)

Similarly, we have B2(E) = J.LI(AI)J.L2(A2). 
(d) By Problem 10.6, we have Bm,n,l (E) = Bm,n,2(E) forE E I:1 0 I:2. There-
fore, by Equations (10.6) and (10.7), B1(E) = B2(E) forE E I:1 0 I:2.

This completes the proof. 
10.8. 
First, let us prove the "if" part. Suppose that for every t E I, ft is !7 I rf:t-
measurable. Let C be the collection of all measurable rectangles on F. Let A E C. 
Then 
A= X At, 
tEl 
where At E gt and At differs from Et for only a finite number oft. Note that 
r
1(A) ={wE 0: ft(w) EAt}= n{ft EAt}, 
tEJ 
where J is the finite index set of t where At differs from Et. Hence we have 
f- 1(A) E !7. Since <;ff =a( C), by Problem 5.4, f is !7 l';ff-measurable. 
Second, let us prove the "only if" part. Suppose that f is !7 l';ff-measurable. Let 
s E I be fixed and B E gs. Let A be a measurable rectangle on F given by 
where A 1 = Et fort =/= s and At = B fort = s. By the assumption, we have 
f- 1(A) E !7. 
But f- 1(A) = J; 1(B). Thus we have J; 1(B) E !7. 
Hence fs is !7 I rf:t-measurable. This completes the proof. 
10.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced product measures and Fubini's theorem. We presented 
the definitions using the product of two measurable spaces. In fact, these definition 
and theorems can be extended to the product of n measurable spaces. For more 
information on product measures and Fubini's theorem, readers are referred to Weir

PROBABILITY THEORY 


CHAPTER 11 
EVENTS AND RANDOM VARIABLES 
Samples, events, and random variables are the fundamental concepts in probability 
theory. In this chapter, we shall introduce the definitions of these concepts based on 
measure theory. 
11.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 11.1 (Sample Space, Sample Point, and Event). Let (0, §, P) 
be a 
probability space (see Definition 2.12). The set 0 is called the sample space, a point 
in 0 is called a sample point, and a subset of§ is called an event. 
Definition 11.2 (Discrete Probability Space). Let n = {WI' w2' ... } be a finite or 
countably infinite set. Let P be a set function defined as 
P{wi} =Pi, 
i = 1, 2, ... 
and 
P(A) = L Pi, 
A ~ n,

128 
EVENTS AND RANDOM VARIABLES 
where p 1 , p2 , ... are nonnegative numbers whose sum is 1. Then P is a probability 
measure on 2°, which is the collection of all subsets of 0. The probability space 
(0, 2°, P) is called a discrete probability space. 
Definition 11.3 (Almost Surely). Let (0, ~' P) be a probability space. A statement 
about outcomes is said to be true almost surely (a.s.), or with probability 1, if the set 
of sample points for which the statement is true has probability 1: 
F = { w E 0 : the statement about w is true} E ~ and P( F) = 1. 
Definition 11.4 (Infinitely Often Event). Let (0, ~' P) be a probability space, and 
let {En }nEN be a sequence of events. Infinitely often event lim sup En is defined as 
limsupEn = n ( U En)· 
m:::O:l 
n:::O:m 
Definition 11.5 (Eventual Event). Let (0, ~' P) be a probability space and let 
{ En}nEN be a sequence of events. Eventual event lim inf En is defined as 
lim inf En = U ( n En) · 
m:::O:l 
n:::O:m 
Definition 11.6 (Random Variable). Let (0, ~) be a measurable space. A random 
variable X is a ~-measurable function; that is, 
X: 0--+ R, 
and x- 1(A) E ~' 'v'A E 13, where 
x- 1(A) ={wE 0: X(w) E A}. 
Definition 11.7 (E-Valued Random Variable). Let (0, ~)and (E, 0") be two mea-
surable spaces. An E-valued random variable X is a ~I 6" -measurable function; 
that is, 
X: 0--+ E, 
and x- 1(A) E ~' 'v'A E 0", where 
x- 1(A) ={wE 0: X(w) E A}. 
Definition 11.8 (Random Vectors). Let (0, ~) be a measurable space. An n-
dimensional random vector X is a ~I !3(R n )-measurable function. That is, 
and x- 1(A) E ~' 'v'A E !3(Rn), where 
x- 1(A) ={wE 0: X(w) E A}. 

BASIC CONCEPTS AND FACTS 
129 
A random vector X can be regarded as ann-tuple (X1 , X2, ... , Xn) of random 
variables defined on a common probability space. 
Definition 11.9 (a-algebra Generated by a Collection of Functions). Let (0, $")be 
a measurable space and (Y1 : 'Y E C) be a collection of functions Y1 : 0 -+ R. The 
a-algebra Y generated by the collection (Y1 : 'Y E C) of functions is defined as 
Y = a(Y1 : 'Y E C)= a ({wE 0: Y1 (w) E B}: 'Y E C, BE !3). 
In other words, Y is the smallest a-algebra on 0 such that each function Y1 is Y-
measurable. 
Definition 11.10 (Probability Law and Distribution Function). Let (0, $", P) be a 
probability space and X be a random variable on 0. The probability law of X is a 
function .Cx: !3-+ [0, 1] defined as 
.Cx = PoX-1. 
The distribution function Fx : R-+ [0, 1] of X is defined as 
Fx(c) = .Cx( -oo, c] =(Po x- 1)( -oo, c] = P(X ~c)= P{w: X(w) ~ c}. 
Definition 11.11 (Joint Law and Joint Distribution Function). Let X = (X1 , X2 , 
... , Xn) be a random vector on a probability space (0, $", P), where n is a natural 
number. Then the distribution function of X is the function Fx : Rd -+ R given by 
(see Definition 4.2) 
Fx(xl,X2, ... ,xn) = P{w: X1(w) ~ x1,X2(w) ~ X2, ... ,Xn(w) ~ Xn}. 
Definition 11.12 (Absolutely Continuous Random Variable and Density Function). 
A random variable X is said to be absolutely continuous if and only if there exists a 
nonnegative Borel function f on R such that 
F(x) = lxoo f(t)dt, 
x E R, 
where F is the distribution function of X. The function f is called the density func-
tion of X. 
A random vector X is said to be absolutely continuous if and only if there exists 
a nonnegative Borel function f on R n such that 
F(x) = [x~ [x~ · · ·lx~ f(tl, t2, ... , tn)dt1dt2 · · · dtn, 
where F is the joint distribution function of X. 
Definition 11.13 (Degenerate and Nondegenerate Random Variable). A random 
variable X on a probability space (0, $", P) is said to be degenerate if its law is 
a Dirac measure be, where 
bc(A) = { 1, if c E A; 
A E !3. 
0, 
if c ~A,

EVENTS AND RANDOM VARIABLES 
A random variable is said to be nondegenerate if it is not degenerate. 
Theorem 11.1 (Fatou's Lemma). Let (S, I:, f.l) be a measure space and let { En}nEN 
be a sequence ofi:-measurable subsets of S. Then we have 
Theorem 11.2. Let (D, $") be a measurable space. Let X1, X2, ... , Xn be func-
tions from n toR. Then a function Z: n---+ R is a(X1, X2, ... , Xn)-measurable 
if and only if there exists a Borel function f : R n ---+ R such that 
Theorem 11.3. Let (D, $")be a measurable space. Let (X"' : 'Y E C) be a collection 
of functions from n to R, where C is an infinite index set. Then a function Z : n ---+ 
R is a(X'Y : 'Y E C)-measurable if and only if there exists a countable sequence 
( 'Yi : i E N) of elements of C and a Borel function f : RN ---+ R such that

11.4. 
To show that X is a random variable, we only need to show that X is §-
measurable. To do this, we show that {X > c} E §, 't/c E R (see Problem 5.7), 
where {X > c} = { w E 0 : X ( w) > c}. 
If p < ~, then p < 1 - p and 
{

{X> c} =

0, 
If p = ~, then p = 1 - p and 
{X> c} = {{H, T},

if c < p;

If p > ~, then p > 1 - p and

Thus we have {X> c} E §, Vc E R.

we have a(0, E, 0\E, 0) = {0, E, 0\E, 0}, which gives the result. 
11.6. The results follow from Theorem 2.1 and Problem 2.18 immediately. 
11.7. 
Since En -+ E, we have, by Problem 1.9, E E § 
and lim sup En 
liminf En =E. Let An = Ui>n Ei and Bn = ni>n Ei for all n?: 1. Then An .j.. 
E and Bn t E. By Problem 11.6, we have P(An) .j..-P(E) and P(Bn) t P(E). But 
P(An) ?: P(En) ?: P(Bn) for all n ?: 1, we have P(En) -+ P(E).

Let A1 = E1 and An = En\ U~:1

pairwise disjoint and U~=l An= U~=l En. Noting that Pis a probability measure 
and P(An) :::;: P(En) for n?: 1, we have 
11.9. We use the mathematical induction method. When n = 1, inequality (11.1) 
reduces to P(El) ?: P(E1 ), which is true. Suppose that inequality (11.1) is true for

Therefore, inequality ( 11.1) is true for all n 2 1. 
We can prove inequality ( 11.2) by mathematical induction and inequality ( 11.1 ). 
11.10. We first show that n(X) is an-system. Let h E n(X) and J2 E n(X); then 
fr 
{ w E 0 : X ( w) :S cr}, 
J2 
{wE 0: X(w) :S c2} 
for some c1 , c2 E R. But 
which implies that n(X) is an-system. 
Note that 
a(X) ={{wE 0: X(w) E B}: BE B} = x- 1(8), 
and 
n(X) = {{wE 0: X(w) :S c}: c E R} = x- 1(n(R)), 
where n(R) = {( -oo, c]: c E R}. By Problem 2.4 and Problem 5.5, we have 
a(X) = x- 1(8) = a(X- 1 (n(R))) = a(n(X)). 
This completes the proof. 
11.11. We first show that n(Xn : n E N) is an-system. To do this, let fr,J2 E 
n(Xn : n E N); then we have 
fr 
{wE 0: Xi(w) :Sci, i EN}, 
J2 
{wE 0: Xi(w) :S di, i EN}, 
for some ci, di E R U { oo }. But

Thus, 1r(Xn : n E N) is a 1r-system. 
Noting that, for any i E N, we obtain

which implies 
1r(Xi) ~ 1r(Xn : n EN). 
From Problem 11.1 0, we have 
Therefore

But 
a({w E 0: Xn(w) E B}: n E N,B E !3)

Thus, from ( 11. 7) we have 
Now we show that 
To do this, let I E 1r(Xn : n E N); then 
I= {wE 0: Xi(w) :s; ci, i EN}. 
But

We have I E a(Xn : n E N). Since I is arbitrary, we have 
which gives (11.9). Combining (11.8) and (11.9) gives the result.

EVENTS AND RANDOM VARIABLES 
11.12. First we show that 
{limsupXn >a}~ limsup{Xn >a}. 
To do this, let wE {limsupXn >a}. Then limsupXn(w) >a. By Definition 1.9, 
we have supn>m Xn(w) > a for all m ;::: 1, which implies that w E Un>m {Xn > 
a} for all m ~ 1. Hence wE nm>l Un>m {Xn >a}. Thus {limsupXn >a} ~ 
limsup{Xn >a}. 
-

Similarly, we can show that {limsupXn > a} ;;;;? limsup{Xn > a}. This 
completes the proof. 
11.13. 
Suppose that X is a random variable on the probability space (0., §, P). 
For each a E D, define an event 
Ea = { w E 0. : X ( w) = a}. 
Then the Ea, a E D, are disjoint sets in§. By the definition of D, for a E D, we 
have P(Ea) = F(a)- F(a-) > 0, where 
F(a-) = lim F(x). 
x---+a-
It follows from Problem 2.20 that D is a countable set. This completes the proof. 
11.14. Let Fy be the distribution function of Y. Then by Definition 11.10, we have 
Fv(y) = P{Y :<:; y} = P{F(X) :<:; y}, 
y E R. 
Note that F(X) E [0, 1]. We have Fy(y) = 0 for y < 0 and Fy(y) = 1 for y > 1. 
Now let us consider the case when y E [0, 1]. By the assumption that the distribution 
function F is continuous, we know that p-I (y) is nonempty. Hence we can find an 
x0 E F- 1 (y); that is, we can find an x0 such that F(x0 ) = y. Thus 
Fv(y) = P{F(X) :<:; y} = P{F(X) :<:; F(x0 )} = P{X :<:; x 0 } = F(x0 ) = y. 
Therefore, Y has a distribution function given by 
{
0, 
ify < 0; 
Fv(Y) = 
y, 
ifO :<:; y :<:; 1; 
1, 
if y > 1. 
11.15. To prove the result, we first show that 
limsupEn ~ [limsup(En+I nE~)] UliminfEn. 
(11.10) 
To do that, let w E lim sup En. Then there are infinitely many events containing w. 
That is, w E En, for n1 < n2 < .... 

BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES

Now if there exists an integer ko such that nk = nko + k - ko all k 2: ko, then 
w E lim inf En; that is, if w is contained in all Ei for i 2: nko, then w E lim inf En. 
In this case, we have 
wE [lim sup (En+l n E~)] U liminf En. 
Now suppose that no such k0 exists. Then for any i E N, we can find an integer 
k > i such that w E Ek+l n Ek. It follows that w E lim sup (En+l n E~). In this 
case, we still have 
wE [lim sup (En+l n E~)] U liminf En. 
Therefore, Equation (11.10) holds. By the first Borel-Cantelli lemma (Theorem 2.2) 
and the assumption, we have 
P[limsup (En+l n E~)] = 0. 
By Fatou's lemma (Theorem 11.1) and the assumption, we have 
P(liminf En)~ liminf P(En) = 0. 
Hence by Equation ( 11.1 0), we get 
P(lim sup En) ~ P[lim sup (En+l n E~)] + P(lim inf En) = 0. 
This completes the proof. 
11.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced some basic concepts in probability theory based on 
measure theory. In fact, measure theory is necessary for us to study probability 
theory in a rigorous manner. Rosenthal (2006, Chapter 1) discussed why measure 
theory is indispensable to a mathematical rigorous theory of probability. Shafer and 
Vovk (2001) discussed the historical development of probability theory. 
Theorems 11.2 and 11.3 are two interesting results that characterize the a-algebras 
generated by random variables. For proofs of these two theorems, readers are re-
ferred to ~inlar (2011, pp76-78).

CHAPTER 12 
INDEPENDENCE 
Independence is an important concept in probability theory. Intuitively, two events 
are independent if the occurrence of one event does not make the other happen more 
or less. In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of independence of events and 
random variables.

n is an element of all sub-a-algebras of$". 
12.3. 
The "only if" part is straightforward. To prove the "if" part, one needs to 
use the unique extension theorem (Theorem 3.2). To do so, one can define two set 
functions J-L1(H) = P(I n H) and J-L2(H) = P(I)P(H) on 1i for fixed IE I and 
show that /-ll = /-l2 on .J. 
12.4. Apply the same argument used to prove Problem 12.3.

12.9. Show that P(nn:;:.:m E~) = 0 and apply the result of Problem 2.19. 
12.10. 
For part (a), one needs to show that 7 and 7 are independent. To do 
this, one can show that rr(X1 , X 2 , · · · , Xn) and 7 are independent. Then show that 
rr(Xn : n E N) and 7 are independent. Part (b) is just a corollary of part (a). 
12.11. Apply the result of Problem 12.3. 
12.12. Apply the result of Problem 12.11. 
12.13. Find an example such that P(Ei n E1) = P(Ei)P(E1) for all i =!= j and 
P(E1 n E2 n · · · n En) =/= P(E1)P(E2) · · · P(En). 
12.14. Apply the result of Problem 12.4 or apply the result of Problem 12.3 to prove 
directly. 
12.15. For part (a), one can show that Ep (p E P) are independent by establishing 
P ( n;=l Ep,j) = IJ;=l P(Ep,j) for all 1 :=:; i1 < i2 < · · · < ir, where Pij are 
prime numbers. Parts (b)-(d) can be derived from part (a). 
12.16. Apply the results of Problems 11.12 and 12.9. 
12.17. For the first equation, use the fact that lim Xn(w) exists if and only if 
limsupXn(w) = liminf Xn(w). 
Other equations can be proved similarly. 
12.4 Solutions 
12.1. By Definition 12.1, we only need to show that for every A E rr(X) and every 
BEffo, 
P(A n B) = P(A) · P(B). 
(12.2) 
Since § 0 contains only two elements, we only need to verify that Equation (12.2) 
holds for B = 0 and B = n. 
If B = 0, then P(A n 0) = 0 = P(A) · P(0). If B = n, then P(A n D) = 
P(A) = P(A) · P(D). This completes the proof. 
12.2. The "if" part is straightforward. Suppose that 

SOLUTIONS

for any 1 :<:: i1 < i2 < · · · < ir and all subsets Gi1 E Yi1 (1 :<:: j :<:: r). Then by 
choosing r =nand ij = j for j = 1, 2, ... , n, we have 
Hence these sub-o--algebras are independent, by Definition 12.1. 
Now let us prove the "only if" part. Suppose that 91, 92, ... are independent. 
Then we have 
for any n :2: 1 and all subsets Gi E Yi (1 :<:: i :<:: n). 
Let 1 :<:: i1 < i2 < · · · < ir and Gi1 E Yi1 (1 :<:: j < r). Then we define 
H1, H2, ... , Hir as follows: 
if k = ij for some j. 
By assumption and the fact that P(O) = 1, we have 
Hence the "only if" part is valid. This completes the proof. 
12.3. First, suppose that g and H are independent; then by definition, we have 
P(G n H)= P(G)P(H), 
'VG E Q, 'VH E H. 
By hypothesis, we have I <;;; g and J <;;; H. Thus 
P(I n J) = P(I)P(J), 
'VIE I, 'VJ E J. 
Next, suppose that I and J are independent. For fixed I E I, we define two 
functions J..ll : H -+ [0, 1] and J.L2 : H -+ [0, 1] as 
J..l1 (H) = P(I n H), 
J..l2(H) = P(I)P(H). 
We claim that J..ll and J.L2 are measures on (0, H). In fact, noting that Pis a proba-
bility measure on (0, H), we have 
J.L1 (0) = P(0 n H) = P(0) = 0, 
J..l2(0) = P(0)P(H) = 0,

where Hn (n E N) are mutually disjoint elements of 1i. Therefore, f..LI and J.L2 are 
measures on (0, 1i). Since J.L1 and J.L2 are finite and agree on J, by Theorem 3.2 
they agree on rr(J) = 1i. Hence 
f..LI(H) = J.L2(H), 
VIE I, 't/H E 1i. 
For fixed H E 1i, we define two functions vi : g -t [0, 1] and v2 : g -t [0, 1] as 
vi(G) = P(G n H), 
v2(G) = P(H)P(G). 
Similarly, we can show that v1 and v2 are measures on (0, Q) and agree on I. By 
Theorem 3.2, they agree on a(I) = Q. Thus, g and 1i are independent. 
12.4. 
The argument used to prove this problem is similar to that in the proof of 
Problem 12.3. The "only if' part is obvious. We only prove the "if" part here. 
To do that, we fix Ii E Ii ( i = 2, 3, ... , n) and define two functions f..LI : gi -t 
[0, 1] and VI : gi -t [0, 1] as 
n 
vi(GI) 
= 
P(GI) IJ P(Ii)· 
i=2 
In the same way as in Problem 12.3, we can verify that f..LI and VI are measures on 
(0, QI). By hypothesis, f..LI and VI agree on II. By Theorem 3.2, they agree on 
gi = a(II). 

SOLUTIONS 
149 
Then we fix h E ~h and Ii E Ii ( i = 3, 4, ... , n) and define two functions

i=3 
We can verify that J.Lz and liz are measures on (0, Qz) and agree on Iz. By Theorem 
3.2, they therefore agree on Qz = a(I2). 
Repeating this process, we can show that 
for Ii E gi· Since the Ii are arbitrary, by definition 9n (n E N) are independent. 
This completes the proof. 
12.5. First let us prove the "if" part. Let n(Xi) ={{Xi :::; c}: c E R} = {{wE 
n : Xi(w) :S c} : c E R} fori = 1, 2, ... , n. Then n(Xi) is an-system and, by 
Problem 11.10, a(Xi) = a(n(Xi)). 
Let Ii E n(Xi)· Then Ii ={Xi :::; ci} for some ci E R. Then by assumption we 
have 
By Problem 12.4, we know that X 1 , Xz, ... , Xn are independent. 
The "only if" part is obvious. Suppose that X1, Xz, ... , Xn are independent. Let

Now let 7r(Xi) = {{Xi ::::; c} : c E R} = {{w E f2 : Xi(w) ::::; c} : c E R}

a(7r(Xi)). Then by assumption we have 
for all Ji E 7r(Xi), i = 1, 2, ... , n. By Problem 12.4, we know that X1, X2, ... , Xn

12.9. By Definition 11.4, we have

Since En (n E N) are independent and 1 - x ::::; e-x, Vx ;::: 0, we have 
Noting that I:~=l P(En) = oo, we have P(Gm) = 0 (mEN). Since the union of 
P-null sets are P-null (see Problem 2.19), we have 
P(limsupEn) = 1- P((limsupEnn = 1- P ( U Gm) = 1.

From Problem 11.11, we know that lCn and Jn are 7r -systems that generate Xn and

which implies that Kn and .:ln are independent. By Problem 12.3, we know that Xn 
and In are independent. Since T s;; /n, it follows that Xn and Tare independent. 
Let Xoo = rr(Xn : n E N) and Koo = U~= 1 Xn. We claim that Koo is a n-
system and rr(Koo) = X00 • In fact, let A, B E K 00 , then A E Xr and B E X 8 for 
some r, s E N. Assuming r :::; sand noting that Xr s;; X8 , we have A, B E X 8 , 
which implies An B E K00 • Thus, Koo is an-system. Noting that Xn s;; X00 for all

rr(Xn : n EN)

we have Xoo s;; rr(K00 ), since U~= 1 rr(Xn) s;; K00 • Thus Xoo = rr(K00 ); that is, 
Koo generates X00 • 
Since Xn and Tare independent for all n E N, it follows that Koo and Tare 
independent. By Problem 12.3, Xoo and Tare independent. 
Since T = n~= 1 In s;; X00 , Tis independent ofT Therefore, for F E T, we 
have 
P(F) = P(F n F)= P(F)P(F) = P(F) 2 ,

12.11. By definition, events A and Bare independent if the a-algebras £1 = {0, A, 
Ae, D} and £2 = {0,B,Be,n} are independent. However, £1 = a({A}) and 
£2 =a( { B} ). Thus the result follows from Problem 12.3. 
12.12. By Problem 12.11, to show that A and Be are independent we only need to 
prove P(A n Be) = P(A)P(Be). But P(A n Be) = P(A)- P(A n B)= P(A)-
P(A)P(B) = P(A)P(Be). Thus A and Be are independent. Other implications 
can be proved similarly. 
12.13. Let D = {1, 2, 3, 4}, ff = 211 , and P(i) = 0.25 fori= 1, 2, 3, 4. Let E 1 = 
{1, 2}, E2 = {2, 3}, and E3 = {1, 3}. Then P(Ei n Ej) = 0.25 = P(Ei)P(Ej) 
fori -1- j. But P(E1 n E2 n E3) = P(0) = 0 -1- P(EI)P(E2)P(E3). 
12.14. By hypothesis D E Ii (i = 1, 2, 3) and Ii (i = 1, 2, 3) are 1r-systems on D, 
and from (12.1) we have 
P(h n h n D) = P(h)P(I2)P(D), 
VIi E Ii, i = 1, 2. 
Since P(D) = 1, the above equation gives 
P(h n I2) = P(h)P(I2), 
VIi E Ii, i = 1, 2. 
By Problem 12.3, a( h) and a(I2 ) are independent. 
Now we define Cas 
(12.3) 
We can verify that C is a 1r-system on D. In fact, let I, J E C, then I = h n h 
and J = J1 n h for some h, J1 E I1 and h, J2 E I 2, respectively. But, In J = 
(h n h) n (J1 n J2) = (h n JI) n (I2 n J2). Noting that I1 and I2 are 1r-systems, 
we have I1 n J1 E I1 and h n J2 E I2, which lead to In J E C. Thus, Cis a 
1r-system. 
We claim that a(C) and a(I3 ) are independent. In fact, let I E a(C) and h E I 3 , 
then I = h n I2 for some h E I 1 and I2 E I 2 and 
P(I n I3) = P(h n I2 n h) = P(h)P(I2)P(h).

Since a(II) and a(I2 ) are independent, we have P(I) = P(h ni2 ) = P(h)P(I2). 
Thus from (12.4) we have 
P(I n h) = P(I)P(I3). 
Since I and ! 3 are arbitrary, by Problem 12.3, a( C) and a( h) are independent. 
Since 0 E Ii (i = 1, 2), from (12.3) we have Ii ~ C (i = 1, 2). Thus, a(Ii) ~ 
a( C) (i = 1, 2). Now let Ai E a(Ii) (i = 1, 2, 3), then A1 , A2 E a( C). Since a( C) 
and a(I3) are independent, we have P(A1 n A2 n A3) = P(A1 n A2)P(A3). Since 
a(h) and a(/2 ) are independent, we have P(A1 n A2 ) = P(AI)P(A2). Therefore 
P(A1 n A2 n A3) = P(A1 n A2)P(A3) = P(AI)P(A2)P(A3), 
which implies that a( h), a(I2), and a( h) are independent. 
12.15. 
(a) By definition of independent events, to show that Ep (p E P) are independent 
we need to show that 
Ep = {0, Ep, 0\Ep, 0}, 
p E P 
are independent. Note that Ep (p E P) are n-systems and Ep = a( { Ep} ), by 
Problem 12.4 we only need to show {Ep} (pEP) are independent. 
To do this, let P = {Pl, P2, ... } such that P1 < P2 < P3 < · · · , and let r E N 
and ij EN (j = 1, 2, ... , r) such that 1 :<::; i1 < i2 < · · · < ir; then n;=l Ep,j

J=l 
Thus,

12.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced the concept of independence in probability theory. 
Mathematically, definition of the independence of random variables and events is 
based on the independence of a-algebras. For more information on independence, 
readers are referred to Williams (1991), Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999), and <;inlar 
(2011). 


CHAPTER13 
EXPECTATION 
In probability theory, the expectation of a random variable is the integral of the ran-
dom variable with respect to its probability measure. For example, the expectation 
of a discrete random variable is the weighted average of all possible values that the 
random variable can take on. In this chapter, we shall introduce the definition of 
expectation and relevant concepts. 
13.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 13.1 (Expectation). Let (0, $, P) be a probability space and X E £ 1 (0, 
$, P), where £ 1(0, $, P) denotes the set of all P-integrable functions on 0 (see 
Definition 6.4). The expectation E(X) of X is defined as 
E(X) = k X(w)P(dw) = k XdP.

EXPECTATION 
Definition 13.2 (Expectation over Subsets). Let (0, §, P) be a probability space, 
FE§, and X be a random variable on 0. Then E(X; F) is defined as 
where 
E(X;F) = t X(w)P(dw) = t XdP = E(Xlp), 
]p(w) = {1, if wE F; 
0, 
ifwt}_F. 
Definition 13.3 (Integration with Respect to Distribution Functions). Let F be a dis-
tribution function on R n and let JL be the corresponding Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure. 
Let g be a Borel function from R n to R. Then the integration of g with respect to 
the distribution function F is defined as 
{ g(x)dF(x) = 
{ 
gdJL. 
}Rn 
}Rn 
Definition 13.4 (Covariance and Variance). Let (0, §, P) be a probability space 
and X, Y E £ 2(0, §, P). Then, by the monotonicity of norms (see Problem 8.5), 
X, Y E £ 1(0, §, P). Let X =X- JLx andY= Y- JLy, where JLx = E(X) 
and JLY = E(Y). Then X, Y E £ 2 (0, §, P) and so XY E £ 1(0, §, P). The 
covariance of X and Y is defined as 
Cov(X, Y) = E(XY) = E[(X- JLx)(Y- JLY)]. 
The variance of X is defined as 
Var(X) = Cov(X, X). 
Definition 13.5 (Moment, Central Moment and Absolute Moment). Let X be a ran-
dom variable on the probability space (0, §, P). Let k > 0. Then the kth moment 
of X is defined as 
The kth absolute moment of X is defined as 
If E(X) is finite, then the kth central moment of X is defined as 
and the kth absolute central moment of X is defined as 
E(IX- E(xW). 

PROBLEMS 
163 
The first moment of X is also called the mean of X. The second absolute central 
moment of X is also called the variance of X. 
Definition 13.6 (Correlation). Let X, Y E L2(fl, .§, P). Then the correlation of X 
and Y is defined as 
Corr(X Y) = 
Cov(X, Y) 
' 
Jvar(X)Var(Y) 
where Jlx = E(X) and JlY = E(Y).

Theorem 13.1. Let X be a random variable on the probability space (fl, .§, P), 
and let g a Borel function from R toR. Let Y =go X. Then 
E(Y) = L 
gdPx = L 
g(x)dF(x), 
where F is the distribution function of X. 
If X has a density function f, we have 
E(Y) = L 
g(x)f(x)dx. 
Theorem 13.2. Let (fl, .§, P) be a probability space, and let X andY be inde-
pendent random variables on n such that X,Y E L 1(fl,.§,P). Then XY E 
L 1(fl,.§,P)and

X is nonnegative and E(X) < ooo Then, by Problem 1502, we obtain 
which implies 
nP(X ::>: n) :::; E(X) < oo,

P(An) = 1- P(X ::>: n) ::>: 1- -E(X)o 
n 
Therefore, P(An) -t 1. Recalling that An t {X < oo }, we have, by Theorem 201, 
P(An) t P({X < oo})o HenceP({X < oo}) = 1. 

SOLUTIONS

13.3. 
By hypothesis, Zn ( n 2: 1) are nonnegative random variables on D. Then 
Sn = Z1 + Z2 + · · · + Zn (n 2: 1) are also nonnegative random variables on D. By

Noting that Sn E (rn§)+ and Sn t I;%: 1 Zko by Theorem 6.2, we have 
(13.2) 
Combining Equations (13.1) and (13.2), we get 
This completes the proof. 
13.4. Let xt and xi- be the positive and negative parts of Xi, respectively. Then 
Xi = Xt -xi-. By the assumption that Xi has finite expectation and by Definition 
6.4, we have E(Xt) < oo, E(xi-) < oo, and 
By Problem 13.3, we have 
E (~xt) = ~E(Xt) 
( 13.3) 
and 
E (~xi-) = ~ 
E(xi-). 
(13.4) 
Subtracting Equation (13.4) from Equation (13.3) gives 
This completes the proof. 
13.5. We first show that 2:::~= 1 Zn < oo a.s. Since, by hypothesis, I:~=l E(Zn) 
< oo, we have, by Problem 13.3, E (2:::~= 1 Zn) < oo. Therefore, by Problem 13.2, 
2:::~= 1 Zn < oo a.s. 
Next, we show that Zn --t 0 a.s. Let Sn = Z1 +Z2+· · ·+Zn and S = 2:::~= 1 Zn. 
Then Sn t S. Recall that S < oo a.s., we haveS- Sn + 0 a.s. Since 0 ~ Zn ~ 
S- Sn- 1 for every n 2: 2, we have Zn --t 0 a.s. This completes the proof.

13.7. 
Since X and Y are independent, we have, by Theorem 13.2, E(XY) 
E(X)E(Y). Then 
Cov(X, Y) = E[(X- E(X))(Y- E(Y))] = E(XY)- E(X)E(Y) = 0, 
and so, by Problem 13.6, we have 
Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X, Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y). 
13.8. Let us first prove the "if" part of this problem. To do that, we assume that 
E[g(X)h(Y)] = E[g(X)] · E[h(Y)] 
for all g, h : R-+ R such that the expectations exist. Let B 1 , B2 E B(R) and define 
h.h: R-+ Ras 
h(X) = e· 
if X E B1; 
0, 
if X tf. B 1, 
and 
h(Y) = e· 
ifY E B2; 
0, 
ifY tf. B2, 
Then by assumption, we have E[h(X)h(Y)] = E[!J(X)] · E[h(Y)]. But note 
that 
E[fi(X)_h(Y)] = E[IB,xB 2 (X, Y)] = P(X1 E B1, Y E B2) 
and 
E[fi(X)] = E[IB, (X)]= P(X E BI), 
E[_h(Y)] = E[IB2 (Y)] = P(Y E B2), 

SOLUTIONS 
169 
we have P(X E B1 , Y E B2 ) = P(X E Bl) · P(Y E B2 ). By Problem 12.5, we 
know that X and Y are independent. 
Now we prove the "only if" part. Suppose that X and Y are independent. We 
claim that g(X) and h(Y) are also independent for any functions g and h. To prove 
this claim, let B1, B 2 E B(R). Then we have g- 1 (Bl), h- 1 (B2) E B(R). Hence, 
by Problem 12.5, we have 
P(X E g- 1(Bl), Y E h- 1(B2 )) 
P(X E g- 1(Bl)) · P(Y E h- 1(B2 )) 
P(g(X) E Bl) · P(h(Y) E B2). 
Hence g(X) and h(Y) are independent. The result follows from Theorem 13.2. 
This completes the proof.

Hence we only need to show that

13.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced the concept of expectation, variance, covariance, and 
moments. We defined expectations on the basis of integration with respect to prob-
ability measures. In some books such as Bartoszynski and Niewiadomska-Bugaj 
(2007), expectations are defined in terms of densities. For more information on 
expectations, readers are referred to Williams ( 1991, Chapters 6 and 7), Ash and

CONDITIONAL EXPECTATION 
In probability theory, the conditional expectation is the expected value of a random 
variable given some information represented by a a-algebra. The conditional ex-
pectation defined on the basis of a a-algebra is again a random variable satisfying 
certain properties. In this chapter, we present the definition of conditional expecta-
tions based on this approach.

The version of the conditional expectation of X given Q is written as Y = E(XIQ)

Definition 14.2 (Conditional Expectation of a Random Variable Given a Random 
Variable). Let X andY be random variables on some probability space (0, §, P) 
with E(IXI) < oo. The conditional expectation ofY given X, written as E[YIX], is 
defined as E[Yiu(X)]. Similarly, E(XIZ1 , Z2 , ... ) stands for E(XIu(Z1 , Z2 , ... )). 
Definition 14.3 (Conditional Expectation of a Random Variable Given an Event). 
Let Y be a random variable on some probability space (0, §, P). Let H E /#. 
Then the conditional expectation of Y given H, written as E[YIH], is defined as 
E[Yiu(IH )], where IH is the indicator function of H. 
Definition 14.4 (Conditional Probability of an Event Given au-Algebra). Let (0, 
§, P) be a probability space and Q a sub-u-algebra of /F Let B E .'#. Then 
a version of the conditional probability of B given Q is defined to be a function 
Y : (0, Q) --+ (R, B) (see Theorem 14.2) such that 
P( A n B) = l Y dP, 
A E Q. 
The version of the conditional probability of B given Q is written as P(BIQ). 
Note that E[IsiQ] is a version of the conditional probability of B given Q. We 
also write 
P(BIQ) = E[Isl9]. 
Definition 14.5 (Conditional Probability of an Event Given a Random Variable). Let 
(0, §, P) be a probability space and Q be a sub-u-algebra of§. Let BE.'#, and let 
X be a random variable on the probability space. Then a version of the conditional 
probability of B given X is defined as 
P(BIX) = P(Biu(X)) = E[Islu(X)]. 
Then P(BIX) is a u(X)-memasurable function. By Theorem 11.2, there exists a 
Borel function f such that P(BIX) = f(X). The conditional probability P(BIX = 
x) is defined as 
P(BIX = x) = f(x). 
Definition 14.6 (Conditional Probability of an Event Given an Event). Let G and H 
be two events. The conditional probability of H given G is defined to be any number 
P(HIG) in [0, 1] satisfying 
P(G n H)= P(G) · P(HIG).

14.1. Let A : g --+ R be defined as 
A(A) = i XdP, 
A E g. 
We claim that A is a signed measure on (0, Q). By the definition of the integral over 
subsets (Definition 6.5), we have 
Let An, n = 1, 2, ... , be disjoint sets in g. Then 
Hence A is a signed measure on (0, Q). 
Now if P(A) = 0 and A E g, then by Problem 6.10, we have A(A) = 0. Hence 
A is absolutely continuous with respect to P. By the Radon-Nikodym theorem, there 
is a g-measurable random variable Y such that 
i XdP = i Y dP, 
\lA E g.

Note that X E L 1(0,ff:,P). WehaveE(IXI) < oo. But 
-E(IXI):::; E(X) = E(Y):::; E(IXI), 
which implies that E(IYI) < oo. This completes the proof. 
14.2. We only need to show that E(Y; G) = E(X; G) for G E Q. To do this, let 
C = {G E g : E(Y; G) = E(X; G)}. We claim that Cis ad-system on 0. By 
hypothesis, we have E(Y; 0) = E(X; 0). Hence 0 E C. Suppose that A, B E C 
with A ~ B. Then E(Y; B\A) = E(Y IB\A) = E(Y IB - Y IA) = E(Y; B) -
E(Y; A) = E(X; B)- E(X; A) = E(X; B\A). Hence B\A E C. Suppose that 
An E C and An t A. Then X IAn t X IA andY IAn t Y IA and so, by Theorem 6.2, 
E(X; An) = E(XIAn) t E(Xh) = E(X; A) and E(Y; An) t E(Y; A). Since 
E(Y; An) = E(X; An), we have E(X; A) = E(Y; A). Thus A E C. Therefore C 
is a d-system. 
Noting that I~ C ~ Q, we have d(I) ~ C and so, by Problem 2.7, a(I) ~ C. 
But with a(I) = Q, we have C = Q. This completes the proof. 
14.3. Let Y be a version of E(XIQ). Then, by definition of conditional expecta-
tions, we have E(Y; G) = E(X; G) for all G E Q. Since g is a sub-a-algebra of 
Y:, we have 0 E Q. Thus E(Y; 0) = E(X; 0), which is E(Y) = E(X). 
14.4. By hypothesis, we know that X is (}-measurable and E(IXI) < oo. Also, we 
have 
fc XdP= fc XdP, 
CEQ. 
Thus X is a version of E(XIQ). Hence X= E(XIQ), a.s. 
14.5. Let Y1 = E(X1IQ) and Yz = E(Xzl9). We only need to show that a1Y1 + 
azYz is a version of E(a1X 1 + azXzl9). Since Y1 and Y2 are (}-measurable, we 
have a1Y1 + azYz E mQ. Since E(IY1I) < oo and E(IYzl) < oo, we have 
Moreover, for G E g, we have 
a1E(Y1; G)+ azE(Yz; G) 
a1E(X1; G)+ azE(X2; G) 
E(a1X1 + a2X2; G). 
14.6. 
Let Y = E(XIQ). Since P(Y ?': 0) = 1 - P(Y < 0), we only need to 
show that P(Y < 0) = 0. To do this, let An = {Y < -1/n} for n ?': 1. Then 
Ant {Y < 0}. Since X ?': 0, we have

which implies P(An) = 0 for n 2: 1. Thus by Theorem 2.1, P(A) = 0, that is, 
P(Y < 0) = 0. 
14.7. Let Yn = E(XniQ). Then by Problems 14.6 and 14.5, we have Yn 2: 0 a.s. 
and Yn+l - Yn = E(Xn+l - Xnl9) 2: 0 a.s. for n 2: 1. Let Y = lim sup Yn. 
Then Y is Q-measurable and Yn t Y a.s. Since E(Yn; G) = E(Xn; G) for G E g 
and n 2: 1, it follows from Theorem 6.2 that E(Y; G) = E(X; G) for G E Q. In 
particular, E(Y; fl) = E(X; fl), which is E(Y) = E(X). Thus E(Y) < oo. Hence 
Y is a version of E(XIQ). Therefore E(XniQ) t E(XIQ) a.s. 
14.8. Let Ym = infn~m Xn form 2: 1. Then Ym t lim inf Xn as m -+ oo. Since 
Ym :-=:; Xn for n 2: m, by Problem 14.6, we have 
which gives 
E(Yml9) :S: inf E(XniQ) :S: sup inf E(XniQ) = liminf E(Xnl9).

Since Ym t liminfXn, by Problem 14.7, we have E(Yml9) t E(liminfXniQ). 
Therefore 
E(liminf XniQ) :S: liminf E(Xnl9). 
14.9. Since IXn I :S: V for n 2: 1, we have V + Xn 2: 0 and V - Xn 2: 0. Then by 
Problem 14.8, we have 
E(liminf(V + Xn)IQ) :-=:; liminf E(V + Xnl9), 
a.s. 
(14.1) 
and 
E(liminf(V- Xn)IQ) :-=:; liminf E(V- XniQ), 
a.s. 
(14.2) 
Since Xn -+ X, we have liminf(V + Xn) = V +X and liminf(V- Xn) = 
V- X. In addition, by Problem 1.8, we have liminf E(V + XniQ) = E(VIQ) + 
liminf E(Xnl9) and liminf E(V- XniQ) = E(VIQ) -limsupE(Xnl9). Thus 
it follows from (14.1) and (14.2) that 
limsupE(Xnl9) :S: E(XIQ) :S: liminf E(Xnl9), 
a.s., 
which implies E(XniQ) -+ E(XIQ), a.s. 
14.10. 
Let Y = E(XIQ) and Z = E(Xi1l). We only need to show that Z is a 
version of E(Yi1l). By definition, Z is 1l-measurable. Let Z+ = E(IXIIH). Then 
by Problem 14.6, we have IZI = IE(XIH)I :-=::: E(IXII1l) = z+ and 
E(IZI) :-=:; E(Z+) = E(Z+; fl) = E(IXI; fl) = E(IXI) < oo,

Since His a sub-a-algebra of Q, we have

Therefore Z is a version of E(YIH). 
14.11. Let §o = {0, 0} be the trivial a-field. Then by Problems 12.1 and 14.10, 
we have 
E[E[X]] = E[E[XI§o]l§o] = E[XI§o] = E[X]. 
This finishes the proof. 
14.12. Let Y be a version of E(XIQ). We show that ZY is a version of E(ZXIQ). 
Since Z is Q-measurable and bounded, we have ZY E mQ (see Theorem 5.1) and 
E(IZYI) :::; (sup Z(w)) E(IYI) < oo.

Therefore, to show ZY = E(ZXIQ), we only need to show that 
E(ZY; G)= E(ZX; G), 
G E Q.

If we can show that ( 14.3) holds for X

E ( ZY1; G) -
E(ZY2 ; G) = E(zx+; G)- E(zx-; G) = E(ZX; G) forGE Q, where Y1 = 
E(X+ 19) and Y2 = E(X-IQ). Therefore, we can assume that X ~ 0. By Problem 
14.6, Y ~ 0, a.s. 
First, we consider the case when Z is an indicator function. Since Z is Q-
measurable, we have Z = IA for some A E Q (A = z- 1(1) E Q). Then 
E(ZY;G) = E(YIA;G) = E(Y;A n G)= E(X;A n G)= E(XIA;G) = 
E(X Z; G) for G E Q. Hence (14.3) is true. 
Next, we consider the case when Z is a simple function. Then Z has finitely many 
values. Let ai ~ 0, i = 1, 2, ... , n be all the distinct values of Z. Then 
i=l 
where Ai = z- 1 (ai) E Q. ForGE Q, we have

Next, we consider the case when Z is a nonnegative function. Then there exists a 
sequence { Zn }n>l of Q-measurable simple functions such that Zn t Z (see Problem 
5.11). We have already shown that E(ZnY; G) = E(ZnX; G) for G E Q. Noting 
that Y ~ 0, a.s., and X ~ o, we have ZnY t ZY, a.s., and ZnX t ZX, a.s. By 
Theorem 6.2, E(ZY; G)= E(ZX; G) forGE Q. 
Finally, we consider the case when Z is a general function. Let Z = z+ - z-. 
Then E(ZY; G) = E(Z+Y; G)- E(z-y; G) = E(z+ X; G)- E(z- X; G) = 
E(ZX; G) forGE Q. This completes the proof. 
14.13. 
By Theorem 10.1, <p(x) is a $"-measurable function. In consequence, we 
know that <p(X) is r,1 /$"-measurable. Since <I> is nonnegative, <p(X) is also nonneg-
ative. Hence E[<p(X)] is defined. Thus, for every A E r,1, we only need to show 
that 
L 
<p(X)dP = L 
<I>(X, Y)dP. 
Then by Theorem 10.1 and Problem 14.11, we have

Thus E(ZXI()) exists. By Problem 8.5, we have X E L 1(0,§,P), which gives 
E(IXI) < oo. Hence E(XIQ) exists. 
Let Y = E(XIQ). We show that ZY is a version of E(ZXI()). By definition, 
Y is ()-measurable. Hence ZY is ()-measurable. By Problem 15.8, we know that

Using the same argument in Problem 14.12, we have E(ZY; G) = E(ZX; G) for

Since X E (m§)+ and E(X) < oo, we know that E(XIQ) exists and,

Integrating out the left term of the above equation gives

14.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced conditional expectations. Many properties of condi-
tional expectations are presented as problems. Those properties are very important 
at a later stage when we study martingales. For more information about conditional 
expectations, readers are referred to Williams ( 1991 ), Ash and Do leans-Dade ( 1999), 
Rosenthal (2006), Kuo (2006), and <;inlar (2011). Wise and Hall (1993) and Stoy-
anov (1997) present several counterexamples related to conditional expectations. 
In particular, <;inlar (2011) presents a detailed introduction to conditional expecta-
tions and conditional probabilities. As <;inlar (20 11, p 14 7) pointed out, for example, 
the proper interpretation of P(XIY = y) when P{Y = y} = 0 is f(y), where 
!(·)is defined as f(Y) = P(XIY). When P{Y = y} > 0, P(XIY = y) can be 
interpreted as P(XI{Y = y}) or f(y) as the two quantities are identical. 


CHAPTER 15 
INEQUALITIES 
We introduced several important inequalities in Chapter 8 when we presented the £P 
spaces. In this chapter, we shall introduce Jensen's inequality for convex functions. 
Jensen's inequality can be used to prove many other inequalities. 
15.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 15.1 (Convex Functions). Let G be an open subinterval ofR. A function 
c.p : G --+ R is considered convex on G if its graph lies below any of its chords; that 
is, for any x, y E G and 0:::; p:::; 1, we have 
c.p(px + qy) :::; pc.p(x) + qc.p(y), 
where q = 1 - p. 
Theorem 15.1 (Mean Value Theorem). Let f(x) be a continuous function on the 
closed interval [a, b]. Suppose that f(x) is differentiable on the open interval (a, b). 
Then there exists a point c E (a, b) such that 
!'(c)= f(b~ =~(a).

This completes the proof. 
15.3. Let p = ( v - u) I ( w - u) and q = 1 - p = ( w - v) I ( w - u). Then, 0 < p < 1 
and so, by the definition of convex functions, we obtain 
cp(pw + qu) ~ pcp(w) + qcp(u). 
Noting that pw + qu = v, we have 
(w- u)cp(v) ~ (v- u)cp(w) + (w- v)cp(u), 
(15.3) 
which is equivalent to 
(w- u)(cp(u)- cp(v)) 2:: (u- v)(cp(w)- cp(u)). 
Dividing both sides of the above equation by (w- u)(u- v), we get D.u,v ~ D.u,w· 
Note that Equation (15.3) is also equivalent to 
(u- w)(cp(v)- cp(w)) 2:: (v- w)(cp(u)- cp(w)). 
Dividing both sides of this equation by ( u- w) ( v - w ), we get D.u,w ~ D.v,w· 
Now we show that cp is continuous. Let x0 E G. To show that cp is continuous at 
x 0 , we only need to find a 8 for every E > 0 such that lcp(x)- cp(xo)l < E whenever 
lx-xo I < 8. To do this, let Y1, Y2 E G such that Y1 < xo < Y2 (Since G is open, such 
Yl,Y2 exist.). Then we have D.Yl,xo ~ D-xo,x ~ D-x0 ,y2 forx E (yl,xo) U (xo,Y2)· 
Consequently, we have 
ID-x,x 0 I ~ L, 
X E (Yl. xo) U (xo, Y2), 
where L = max(lb.y1,x0 I, ID-x0 ,y2 1). Let 8 =ElL. Then 
lcp(x)- cp(xo)l ~ Llx- xol < E, 
x E (xo- 8, xo + 8). 
Therefore, cp(x) is continuous at x0 . Since this is true for every x0 E G, cp(x) is 
continuous on G. 
15.4. 
Let x, y E G such that x < y. Let p E (0, 1). Let z = px + qy, where 
q = 1- p. Then by Theorem 15.1, we have 
cp'(6 ) = cp(z)- cp(x) = cp(z)- cp(x) 
z-x 
q(y-x) 
and 
cp'(6 ) = cp(y)- cp(z) = cp(y)- cp(z), 
y- z 
p(y- x) 
where for some 6 E (x, z) and 6 E (z, y). But by Theorem 15.1, we have 
cp"(c) = cp'(6)- cp'(6) 2:: 0, 
6-6 

194

which gives cp' ( 6) :<:; cp' ( 6). Thus we have 
cp(z)- cp(x) 
cp(y)- cp(z)

' 
q(y - X) 
-
p(y - X) 
which leads to 
cp(z) :<:; pcp(x) + qcp(y). 
Therefore, 'P is convex on G. This completes the proof. 
15.5. For q E G, let {Yn}n:;::I be a sequence of points in G such that Yn t q. Then 
by Problem 15.3, we have dn :S dn+l :S d+ for n 2:: 1, where dn = ('P(Yn) -
cp(q))/(Yn- q) and d+ = (cp(q+)- cp(q))/(q+- q) for some q+ E G and q+ > q. 
Thus limn-too dn exists and is bounded. Let 
~-(q) =lim cp(y)- cp(q), 
yfq 
y - q 
q E G. 
Let x E G. Then by Problem 15.3, we have 
cp(x)- cp(q) 2:: ~-(q)(x- q) 
or 
cp(x) 2:: ~-(q)(x- q) + cp(q) 
for all q E G. Thus 
cp(x) = sup[~-(q)(x- q) + cp(q)], 
x E G. 
qEG 
Now we show that 
cp(x) = L [~-(q)(x- q) + cp(q)], 
x E G, 
(15.4) 
qEGnQ 
where Q is the set of all rational numbers. To do this, we fix x E G. Since G is open, 
we can choose an E > 0 such that (x- E, x +E) ~ G. Let { qn}n:;::q be a sequence of 
rational numbers in (x- E, x +E) such that qn --+ x. Then it follows from Problem 
15.3 that 
~-(x- E):<:; ~-(qn) :<:;~-(X+ E), 
n 2:: 1. 
Thus 1~-(qn)l :S L = max(l~-(x- E)l, 1~-(x + E)l) for n 2:: 1 and so 
1~-(qn)(x- Qn) + cp(qn)- cp(x)l :S Llx- Qnl + lcp(qn)- cp(x)l. 
(15.5) 
By Problem 15.3, 'Pis continuous on G. Therefore, it follows from Equation (15.5) 
that ~-(qn)(x- qn) + cp(qn) --+ cp(x). Therefore (15.4) is true. Since G n Q 
is countable, we can label all the points in G n Q as a sequence {xn}n>l and let 
an= ~-(xn) and bn = cp(qn)- ~-(Qn)Qn forn 2:: 1. Then 
cp(x) = sup(anx + bn), 
x E G.

Let <p(x) = x2• Since <p(x) is a convex function, it follows from Theorem 15.2 that 
<p(E[X]):::; E[<p(x)], 
which is 
The resulting inequality follows by multiplying n 2 in both sides of the above equa-
tion. This completes the proof. 
15.7. Since <pis convex, by Problem 15.5, we have 
<p(X) = sup(anX + bn), 
n::::1 
where {(an, bn)}n::::l is a sequence in R 2 . Since E(l<p(X)I) < oo, E(<p(X)IQ) 
exists. Let Y be a version of E(<p(X)IQ) and Z be a version of E(XIQ). Since for 
each fixed n, <p(X) 2: anX +bn, by Problems 14.6 and 14.5, we have Y 2: anZ +bn, 
a.s. For each n 2: 1, let An be defined as 
Then P(An) = 1 for n 2: 1 and so, by Problem 11.1, we obtain 
P(A) = P ( n An) = 1, 
n::::1 
where A = nn>l An. Since Y(w) 2: anZ(w) + bn for all n 2: 1 and w E A, we 
have Y 2: anZ +- bn simultaneously for all n 2: 1, a.s., and so

Y 2: sup(anZ + bn) = <p(Z),

In this chapter, we introduced Jensen's inequality. Jensen's inequality is very power-
ful in that it allows us to prove many other inequalities. A proof of Jensen's inequality 
can be found in Williams (1991). For more information about probability inequal-
ities, readers are referred to Jacod and Protter (2004), Rosenthal (2006), Ross and 
Pekoz (2007), Gut (2007), and Lin and Bai (201 0). In particular, the book by Lin 
and Bai (20 I 0) is devoted to probability inequalities. 

CHAPTER 16 
LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS 
The law of large numbers is a theorem in probability theory that describes the average 
of a large number of random variables. The law states that the average of a large 
number of random variables converges to the expected value in some sense under 
certain conditions. In this chapter, we introduce some laws of large numbers. 
16.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 16.1 (Almost Surely Convergence). Let X, X 1 , X 2 , ... be random vari-
ables on a probability space (0, ~, P). The sequence { Xn}n>l is said to converge 
to X almost surely if and only if it converges to X almost everywhere; that is, there 
is a set A E ~such that Xn --+X on A and P(Ac) = P(O\A) = 0. 
Definition 16.2 (Convergence in Probability). Let X 1,X2 , ... , be a sequence of 
random variables on (0, ~. P). The sequence Xi is said to be convergent to a 
random variable X on (0, ~. P) if for every E > 0, we have 
lim P (JXn - XJ ~ E) = 0.

Definition 16.3 (Identically Distributed Random Variables and liD). A sequence of 
random variables { Xn }n> 1 is are said to be identically distributed if they have the 
same distribution. These random variables are called liD random variables if they 
are independent and identically distributed. 
Theorem 16.1 (Weak Law of Large Numbers). Let X 1, X2, ... , be a sequence 
of independent random variables on (0, .9?", P). Suppose that IE(Xi)l < oo and 
Var(Xi) < M for all i = 1, 2, ... , where M < oo. Let Sn = X 1 + X 2 + · · · + Xn.

16.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented some results on law of large numbers. The weak law 
of large numbers is about a sequence of random variables converging in probability, 
while the strong law of large numbers is about a sequence of random variables con-
verging almost surely. A proof of Theorem 16.3 based on Chebyshev's inequality 
can be found in Bhattacharya and Waymire (2007, p51). 
For more information about the law of large numbers, readers can consult text-
books such as Billingsley ( 1999), Chung (2000), and Bhattacharya and Waymire 
(2007).

characteristic functions can be used to characterize the probability distribution of a 
random variable and to identify the limit distribution of a sequence of random vari-
ables. In this chapter, we present characteristic functions and relevant results.

Let f ( t) be defined as 
f(t) = E [et(X-m-€)],

1>x(to) = eiao. 
Let a= a0 jt0 . Then the characteristic function of X- a is e-ia1>x(t). Hence we 
have E[exp(it0(X- a)] = 1. Equating the real parts gives 
E[cos(t0(X- a))]= 1. 
Since I cos Bl :::; 1 and cos e = 1 if and only if e = 27rj for some j E Z, the above 
equation implies that 
P{to(X- a) E {27rj: j E Z}} = 1. 
The result holds with h = 21r jt0 . This completes the proof.

DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS 
Discrete distributions are used to describe random variables that can only take count-
ably many different values. In this chapter, we present several discrete probability 
distributions and their properties. 
18.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 18.1 (Bernoulli Distribution). Let 0 = { 0, 1} and p E (0, 1). A random 
variable X on (0, 2°) is said to have a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p, 
written as X"' Be(p), if and only if 
P{X = k} = pk(1- P?-k, 
k = 0, 1. 
Definition 18.2 (Binomial Distribution). Let n = {0, 1, 2, ... , n }, where n is a 
positive integer, and p E (0, 1). A random variable X on (0, 2°) is said to have a 
binomial distribution with parameters (n,p), written as X"' B(n,p), if and only if

k(k-1)···1 
When n = 1, the binomial distribution is the same as the Bernoulli distribution. 
Definition 18.3 (Poisson Distribution). Let 0 = {0, 1, 2, ... } and() > 0. A random 
variable X on (0, 211 ) is said to have a Poisson distribution with parameter(), written 
as X ,...., P( e), if and only if 
e-&ek 
P{X=k}=~, k=0,1,2, ... . 
Definition 18.4 (Geometric Distribution). Let 0 = {0, 1, 2, ... } and p E (0, 1). A 
random variable X on (0, 211 ) is said to have a geometric distribution with parame-
ters p, written as X,....., G(p), if and only if 
P{X = k} = (1-p)pk, 
k = 0,1,2, .... 
Definition 18.5 (Negative Binomial Distribution). Let 0 = {0, 1, 2, ... }, r > 0, 
and p E (0, 1 ). A random variable X on (0, 211 ) is said to have a negative binomial 
distribution with parameters (r,p), written as X,...., NB(r,p), if and only if 
When r = 1, the negative binomial distribution is the same as the geometric 
distribution. 
Definition 18.6 (Hypergeometric Distribution). Let N, m, and n be integers such 
thatN ~ 1, 0 :S m :S N, and 1 :S n :S N. LetO = {k E Z: max(O,n+m-N)::; 
k::; min(m, n)}. A random variable X on (0, 211 ) is said to have a hypergeometric 
distribution with parameters (N, m, n), written as X,...., HG(N, m, n), if and only if 
P{X = k} =

Since q = 1 - p, the result follows from the above equation. Similarly, we can show 
that 
18.2. Since X1, X2, ... , Xn are independent, by Problem 12.5 we have

Since X 1, X2, ... , Xn are all Bernoulli random variables, we know that M = 0 or

P{M = 1} = 1- P{M = 0} = >.. 
Therefore, M,....., Be(>.). This completes the proof. 
18.3. By Problem 17.4, we have 
E(X) = MJfl (0) 
and 
Var(X) = E [X2] - (E[X])2 = Mfl(o)- (E[X]f. 
By Problem 18.1, we have Mx(t) = (1- p + pet)n. Hence 
MJfl(t) = npet (1- p + petr-1 
and 
Therefore, we have 
E(x) = np 
and 
Var(X) = np(1- p). 
This completes the proof. 
18.4.

233 
By the Fourier uniqueness theorem (Theorem 17.1), we know that X1 + X2 "' 
B(n1 + n 2,p), that is, X 1 + X 2 has a binomial distribution with parameter 
(n1 + n2,p). 
(b) By Definition 14.6, we have 
P({X1 = x} n {X1 + X2 = k}) 
P{X1+X2=k} 
P({X1 = x} n {X2 = k- x}) 
P{X1+X2=k} 
P{X1 = x}P{X2 = k- x} 
P{X1+X2=k} 
By part (a) and the assumption, we have 
and 
P{Xl = x} = ( :1) px(l- p)n,-x, 
P{X2=k-x}= ( n2 )Pk-x(l-p)n2-k+x, 
k-x 
P{Xl + X2 = k} = ( nl: n2) pk(l- p)n,+n2-k. 
Hence we have 
which is a hypergeometric distribution with parameter ( n 1 + n2 , n 1 , k ). 
This completes the solution. 
18.5. We use the method of mathematical induction on m. When m = 1, we have

and 
n! r (1- x)n- 1dx = -(1- xtlb = 1- (1- p)n.

Hence the result holds for m = 1. 
Suppose that the result holds form = m 0 for some integer m0 E [1, n]:

We consider the case when m = m0 + 1. In this case, the integration by parts gives 
(18.2) 
Combining Equations (18.1) and (18.2) gives 
which shows that the result also holds from m = m 0 + 1. Therefore, the result holds 
for all integers in [1, n]. This completes the proof.

This completes the proof. 
18.7. By definition, we have 
k=O 
Sirnilary, we can show that 
Mx(t) = exp [0 (et- 1)], 
This completes the proof. 
18.8. 
To calculate the mean and variance of X, we use the moment generating 
function of the Poisson distribution from Problem 18.7: 
Mx(t) = exp [0 (et- 1)]. 
The first derivative and the second derivative of the moment generating function are

respectively. Hence we have 
and 
Var(X) = E [X2] - (E[X])2 = Mfl(O)- (E[X])2 =e. 
This completes the proof.

18.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented several discrete distributions. These discrete distribu-
tions are probably discussed in many books. Johnson et al. (2005) discussed many 
advanced results of discrete distributions regarding their history, properties, estima-
tion, applications, and recent developments. Kinney (2009) introduced many ex-
amples of statistical distributions including discrete distributions. Balakrishnan and 
Nevzorov (2003) is a textbook on statistical distributions, which also discussed these 
discrete distributions. For more information about discrete distributions, readers are 
referred to Feller (1968), Wimmer and Altmann (1999), and Evans et al. (2000). 


CHAPTER 19 
CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS 
Unlike the discrete distributions described in the previous chapter, continuous distri-
butions are used to describe random variables that can take any number of values. In 
this chapter, we present some common continuous distributions and their properties. 
19.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 19.1 (Univariate Normal Distribution). A random variable X on (R, B) 
is said to be normally distributed with mean f..L and standard deviation 0', written as 
X""' N(J.L, 0'2), if and only if its probability density function is given by

( (x- J.L) 2 ) 
cp(f..L, 0', x) = O'y'27[ exp -

(19.1) 
A normal random variable is called a standard normal random variable if it has 
mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The probability density function of a standard 
normal random variable is denoted by cp(x).

¢x(t) = exp (itL1t- ~a~t2)

By Theorem 17.1, the random variable aX + bY is normally distributed with mean 
ap,1 + btt2 and variance (a2cr? + b2 cr~- 2pabcr1cr2 ). 
19.5. Let us prove the sufficiency first. Suppose that for every a = ( a 1 , a2 , ... , an) T, 
the random variable 
n 
arX= l.:aiXi 
i=l 
is a normal random variable. Then tTX is a normal random variable. Hence by 
Problem 19.1, we have

exp (ip,(tTX)- ~cr2 (tTX)) , 
where p,(tTX) and cr2 (tTX) are the mean and variance oftTX, respectively. Sup-
pose that E[X] = J-L and Cov(X) = I:. Then we have 
JL(ex) = tr J-L

Therefore, we get 
c/Jx(t) = exp (ie f-L- ~tTL;t). 
It follows from Theorem 17.1 and Problem 19.2 that X has a multivariate normal 
distribution. 
Now let us prove the necessity. Suppose that X has a multivariate normal distri-
bution whose density function is given by 
Let a= (a1. a2, ... , an)T be a vector. Let Y = arX. Then

variance aTL:a.

This completes the proof. 
19.6. The "only if" part follows from Theorem 13.2. We only need to prove the "if" 
part. AssumethatE(XiXj) = E(Xi)E(Xj) foralli =1- j. ThenCov(Xi,Xj) = 
E(XiXj)- E(Xi)E(Xj) = 0. Hence (X1,X2, ... ,Xn)T has the following joint

(b) Applying the result of part (a) gives

Since

we get f(n) = (n- 1)!.

19.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented several continuous probability distributions that can be 
used in finance. In general, probability distributions of asset returns should have the 
following properties (Watsham and Parramore, 1997): 
(a) Stationarity- that is, the parameters of the distribution are unchanging through 
time; 
(b) Stability - that is, linear combinations of the distributions have the same type of 
distribution. 
(c) Finite variance. 
Johnson et al. (1994), Johnson et al. (1995), Evans et al. (2000), and Forbes et al. 
(2011) presented a comprehensive discussion of continuous univariate distributions. 
Haas and Pigorsch (2011) studied several fat-tailed distributions. Balakrishnan and 
Nevzorov (2003) is a textbook on statistical distributions that includes several contin-
uous probability distributions. Some common continuous distributions are discussed 
in Borokov (1999), Meucci (2005), Krishnan (2006), and DasGupta (2010). 

CHAPTER 20 
CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREMS 
The central limit theorem is a very important result in probability theory. It states 
that the mean of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables will 
be approximately normally distributed under certain conditions. The central limit 
theorem has several versions. In this chapter, we present some central limit theorems. 
20.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 20.1 (Degenerate Distribution). A distribution function is said to be de-
generate if it is equal to ~xo for some x0 , where ~xo is defined as 
~xo(x) = {0, 
~fx < xo; 
1, 
lfX~Xo. 
(20.1) 
Definition 20.2 (Weak Convergence). A sequence {Fn}n>l of distribution func-
tions is said to converge weakly to a distribution function F, written as Fn =} For 
Fn(x) =} F(x), if 
lim Fn(x) = F(x),

where C(F) = {x E R: F is continuous at x }. 
Definition 20.3 (Convergence in Distribution). Let { Xn}n>l be a sequence of ran-
dom variables. The sequence is said to converge in distribution (or in law) to a 
random variable X 0 , written as Xn ~ X 0 , if Fn => Fa, where Fn is the distribution 
function of Xn for n ?: 0. 
Theorem 20.1 (Lindeberg's Central Limit Theorem). For each n, let Xn,l• Xn, 2,

then Xn ~ X 0 ; that is, if the Xn converges to X 0 in probability, then Xn converges 
to X 0 in distribution.

20.3 Hints 
20.1. 
Use the definition of convergence in probability (Definition 9.1) and the 
definition of convergence in distribution (Definition 20.3). 
20.2. To prove part (a), follow the definition of weak convergence (Definition 20.2) 
and note that a distribution function has only countably many discontinuities (see 
Problem 11.13). To prove part (b), consider the cases x > 0 and x < 0 and follow 
Definition 20.2. To prove part (c), use the method of contradiction. To prove part 
(d), use the method of contradiction and parts (a), (b), and (c). Use part (d) to prove 
part (e). 
20.3. Apply the results of Problem 20.2. 

SOLUTIONS

20.4.

20.6. Find en to satisfy the conditions in Lindeberg's central limit theorem (Theo-
rem 20.1). 
20.4 Solutions 
20.1. 
Let Fn be the distribution function of Xn for n ~ 0. Let x E C(Fa), 
where C (Fa) is the set of points at which Fa is continuous. Let o > 0. Then by the 
continuity of Fa at x, there exists an t > 0 such that 
and 
0 
IFa(x + t)- Fa(x)[ < 2 
0 
[Fa(x- t)- Fa(x)[ < 2. 
By the assumption that Xn ~ X, there exists an integer N such that 
0 
P{[Xn- X[~ t} < 2, foralln ~ N. 
For n ~ N, since 
P{Xn :S x} 
(20.2) 
(20.3) 
P({Xn :S x} n {[Xn- X[< t}) + P({Xn :S x} n {[Xn- X[~ t}),

P({Xn :S x} n {[Xn- X[~ t}) :S P{[Xn- X[~ t} < 2' 
0 
P{Xn :S x} :S 2 + P{X <X+ t}. 
Similarly, we have 
P{X:Sx-t}

P({X :S x- t} n {[Xn- X[~ t}), 
(20.4) 

262 
CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREMS 
which leads to 
6 
P{X :S: X- E} :S: 2 + P{Xn :S: x}. 
(20.5) 
Combining Equations (20.2) - (20.5) gives 
Fo(x)- 6 :S: Fn(x) :S: Fo(x) +b. 
Since 6 is arbitrary, Fn ( x) ---+ F0 ( x). Hence the conclusion is true. This completes 
the proof. 
20.2. 
(a) Let x be a continuity point of G(:r) and let E > 0. Then F(y) is continuous at 
a:r: +b. By Problem 11.13, F has only countably many discontinuities. Then 
we can choose two continuity points u and v of F such that u < ax + b < v 
and F(v)- F(u) <E. By the assumption that Fn =? F, an---+ a, and bn---+ b, 
there exists an integer N, such that for n ::>: Nc, we have 
and 
IFn(u)- F(u)l < E, 
IFn(v)- F(v)l < E, 
Therefore 
IGn(x)- G(:r:)l 
< IFn(anX + bn)- F(ax + b)l 
< 
IFn(anX + bn)- Fn(·u)l + IFn(u)- F(u)l + IF(u)- F(ax +b) I 
< Fn(v)- Fn(u) + IFn(u)- F(u)l + F(v)- F(u) 
< 
5E. 
Since E is arbitrary, we have Gn(x)---+ G(x) as n---+ oo. 
(b) Let E > 0. Let x > 0. Then ~ 0 ( x) = 1. Let u be a continuity point ofF such 
that F(u) > 1- E/2. By the assumption that Fn =? F, there exists an integer 
N 1 such that 
Since an ---+ oo and x > 0, there exists an integer N2 such that anx > u for all 
n ::>: N2. Hence for every n ::>: max(N1 , N 2 ), we have 
1- Fn(anx) < 1- Fn(u) 
< 1- F(u) + IFn(u)- F(u)l 
< 
E. 

SOLUTIONS 
263 
Since E is arbitrary, we have Fn(anx) --+ 1. Similarly, we can show that 
Fn(anx)--+ 0 when x < 0. Therefore, we have Gn =?boo. 
(c) Assume that Gn =? G for some distribution function G. Since {bn}n>l is 
unbounded, we suppose that {bn}n>l is unbounded above. Let u be a continuity 
point of G such that G(u) < ~- By the hypothesis that Gn =? G, there exists 
an integer N1 such that for all n > N1, we have 
1 
IGn(u)- G(u)l = IFn(u + bn)- G(u)l < 4' 
which implies that 
1 
G(u) > Fn(u + bn)- 4 
(20.6) 
Note the assumption that Fn =? F. Let v be a continuity point ofF such that 
F( v) > ~. Then there exists an integer N2 such that for all n > N2 , we have 
1 
IFn(v)- F(v)l < 4· 
(20.7) 
By the hypothesis that {bn}n~l is unbounded above, there exists an integer 
N3 > max(N1 , N2 ) such that u + bN3 > v. Hence from Equations (20.6) and 
(20.7), we have 
1 
1 
1 
G(u) > Fn(v)- 4 ~ F(v)- IFn(v)- F(v)l- 4 > 4· 
But G(u) < ~- This is a contradiction. Similarly, we can show that Gn cannot 
converge weakly when {bn}n>l is unbounded below. 
(d) Suppose that the sequence {an}n>l is not bounded above. Then there exists a 
subsequence { akn }n~l of { an}n~l such that akn --+ oo. By part (b), we have 
(20.8) 
Since G is nondegenerate and 
Fkn [akn (x+ !::)] =Fkn(aknx+bkn)--+G(x), 
it follows from part (c) that {bkn/akn}n~l is bounded. Hence there exists a 
subsequence {bin/ain}n~l of {bkn/akn}n~l such that 
for some constant c. Then by part (a) and Equation (20.8), we have 
Fkn [ akn (X+!::)] --+ b.o(x +c). 

264 
CENTRALUMITTHEOREMS 
This contradicts the assumption that G is nondegenerate. Thus { an}n;,-1 is 
bounded above. 
Since Gn '* G and Gn(a:;:1x- a:;:1bn) = Fn(x)--+ F(x), the same argument 
shows that { a:;: 1 }n;,- 1 is bounded above. Hence we have 
0 < inf an ""::: sup an < oo.

Since G is nondegenerate, we have 
it follows from part (c) that {bj,)a]n}n;,- 1 is bounded. This is a contradiction. 
Hence {bn}n>1 is bounded. 
(e) Since F(x) = F(ax +b) for all x, we have the following for every n?: 1: 
F(x) 
F(ax +b) 
F(a(a.T +b)+ b) 
F(anx + (1 +a+···+ an)b). 
It follows from Item (d) that {an }n;,- 1 is bounded away from 0 and oo. Hence 
a= 1. Then also by part (d), { nb }n;,- 1 is bounded. Hence b = 0. 
This completes the proof. 
20.3. Let Hn(x) = Fn(UnX + vn) for n?: 1. Then we have Hn(x) '* F(x) and

20.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced the concepts of weak convergence and convergence 
in distribution, which are classic topics in probability theory and discussed in many 
texts such as Billingsley (1995). Unlike other notions of convergence, convergence 
in distribution does not require the random variables to be defined on a common 
probability space. 
Lindeberg's central limit theorem is a very general central limit theorem, which 
can be used to prove other central limit theorems. Lindeberg's central limit theorem 
can be proved in several ways. For example, Bhattacharya and Waymire (2007) 
presented a proof without relying on the characteristic function. Athreya and Lahiri 
(2006) presented a proof using the characteristic function.

STOCHASTIC PROCESSES 


CHAPTER 21 
STOCHASTIC PROCESSES 
A stochastic process is a collection of random variables. Stochastic processes play 
an important role in mathematical finance as they are used to model the stock prices. 
In this chapter, we shall present some general concepts and results about stochastic 
processes. 
21.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 21.1 (Stochastic Process). Let I be a set and (E, c&") a measurable space. 
A stochastic process indexed by I is a family of measurable functions Xt. t E I, 
from a probability space (0, ff:, P) into (E, c&"). The measurable space (E, c&") is 
referred to as the state space. 
For each w E 0, the mapping t-+ Xt(w) is called a trajectory or a sample path 
of X. 
Definition 21.2 (Probability Law of Stochastic Process). Let {Xt : t E I} be 
a stochastic process on some probability space (0, g;, P) with some state space 
(E, c&"). Let X = (Xt)tEJ be the corresponding random variable from (0, ff:) into 
Measure, Probability, and Mathematical Finance.

the product space (F, ~) = (E1 , tff1 ), where 
E 1 =X E 
tEl 
and 
The probability law or distribution of the stochastic process { Xt : t E I} is defined 
asP o x- 1, namely, the probability law of the random variable X. 
Definition 21.3 (Continuous and Right-Continuous Stochastic Process). A stochas-
tic process { Xt : t E I} is said to be continuous if almost all sample paths of the Xt 
are continuous. A stochastic process { Xt : t E I} is said to be right-continuous if 
almost all sample paths of the Xt are right-continuous. 
Definition 21.4 (CadHtg Process). A stochastic process { Xt : t E I} is called a 
cadlag process if almost all its sample paths are right-continuous with left-hand lim-
its. 
Definition 21.5 (Independent Increments). A stochastic process {Xt : t E I} is said 
to have independent increments if Xt- Xs is independent of a(Xu : u :S s) for all 
s :S t. 
Definition 21.6 (Stationary Increments). A stochastic process { Xt : t E I} is said 
to have stationary increments if for any s, t, u, v E I, s < t, u < v, t - s = v - u; 
then the distribution Xt - Xs is the same as that of Xv - Xu. 
Definition 21.7 (Finite-Dimensional Distribution). Let { Xt : t E I} be a stochas-
tic process with values on (E, Iff). Then the finite-dimensional distributions of a 
stochastic process { Xt : t E I} are probability measures defined as 
/-Lt 1 ,t2 , ... ,tk(H) = P{(Xt,,Xt 2 , ••• ,Xtk) E H},

To do that, let w E nrE[O,oo)nQ{Xr = Yr }, then Xr(w) = Yr(w) for all r E

that Xrn (w) = Yrn (w) for all n?: 1, we have Xt(w) = yt(w). Since tis arbitrary, 
we have Xt(w) = yt(w) for all t?: 0. Hence Equation (21.3) is true. 
By the assumption that X andY are modifications of each other, for all n ?: 1, 
we have

Therefore, by Problem 11.1 and Equation (21.2), we have

Xrn (w) ~ Yrn (w) for all n ~ 1, we have Xt(w) ~ Yt(w). Since tis arbitrary, we 
have Xt(w) ~ yt(w) for all t ~ 0. Hence Equation (21.5) is true. 
By assumption, we have P{Xrn = Yrn} = 1 for all n ~ 1. It follows from

By the assumption that tfft = a(Vt). t E J, we have \1'0 <;;:: \1'1, which implies 
that a(%) <;;:: a(\1'1). To show that Equation (21.9) holds, we need to show that 
a(\1'1 ) <;;:: a(\1'0 ). To do this, it is sufficient to show that 
Let G E \1'1 . Then 
G = X At, 
tEl 
(21.10) 
where At E gt and At differs from Et for only a finite number of t. Let 
S = { t E I : At -=/:- Et}. For each s E S, let 
where Bt = Et fort -=1- sand B 8 = A 8 • Then we have 
But Gs E a(\1'o). It follows that Equation (21.10) holds. 
(c) By part (b) of this proof, \1' = a(\1'0 ). It follows from Problem 5.5 that a(X) = 
a(C). 
This finishes the proof. 
21.9. Let \1'o be the collection of all measurable rectangles in F. Then by Definition 
10.4, we have \1' = a(\1'0 ). By Problem 5.5, we have 
a(X) =a {{wE 0: X(w) E B} :BE \1'o}. 
Hence we only need to show that 
a {{wE 0: X(w) E B} :BE \1'o} = a(Xt : t E J). 
(21.11)

STOCHASTIC PROCESSES 
To do that, let us first show that 
a{{w E 0: X(w) E B}: BE ~o} ~ a(Xt: t E I). 
(21.12) 
Let A E {{wE 0: X(w) E B}: BE ~0 }. Then there exists a set B E ~0 such 
that A= {X E B}. Since% is the collection of all measurable rectangles on F, we 
have 
B = X Bt, 
Bt E rf!t, 
tEl 
where Bt differs from Et for only a finite number oft. Then we have 
A= n{Xt E Bt} E {Xt E Bt} E a(Xt: t E I). 
tEl 
Since A is arbitrary, it follows that Equation (21.12) holds. 
Next we show that 
a(Xt: t E J) ~a {{wE 0: X(w) E B}: BE ~o}. 
(21.13) 
LetA E {{wE 0: Xt(w) E B}: BE rf!t,t E J}. Thenthereexistsas E Janda 
set Bs E 6"8 such that A= {Xs E B 8 }. Let C be a rectangle on F given by 
where Ct = Et fort-/=- sand Cs = B 8 • Then we have 
A= {Xs E Bs} = n{Xt E Bt} ={X E C} E {{X E B}: BE ~o}, 
tEl 
which shows that Equation (21.13) holds. 
Combining Equations (21.12) and (21.13) gives Equation (21.11). This completes 
the proof. 
21.10. Lett ;::: 0 be fixed. By Problem 21.9, we have 
S:t = a(Xs : 0 ::; s ::; t) = a(Z), 
where Z = (Xs)o<s<t is a random variable from (0, $)to the product space 
( 
x 
R, ® B(R)) . 
o::;s::;t 
o::;s::;t 
By Problem 2.4, we have 
B(R) = a('D), 
where'D= {(-oo,x] : x E R}. Let ~0 be the collection of all rectangles Gin 
Xo::;s::;t R having the form

287 
where As E D and As differs from R for only a finite number of s. Let C1 and C2 
be given by 
C1 = { {Z E B}: BE ~o}, 
C2 = { {Y E B}: BED}. 
Then by Problem 21.8, we find that C1 and C2 are 1r-systems and that CT(Cl) = CT(Z) 
and CT(C2) = CT(Y). 
By Problem 12.3, CT(Y) and $tare independent if and only if 
P(I n J) = P(I)P(J) 
for all IE C1 and J E C2. This completes the proof. 
21.11. Let ~0 be the collection of all rectangles G in F having the form 
where At E Dt and At differs from Et for only a finite number oft. Let C be given 
by 
C ={{X E B}: BE ~o}. 
Then by Problem 21.8, we know that Cis a 1r-system and CT(X) = CT(C). Hence by 
Problem 5.12, it is sufficient to show that for every A E C, we have 
(21.14) 
To show this, we let A E C. Then there exists a set B E ~0 such that A = {X E B}. 
Since B is a rectangle, we have 
B = 
X Bt, 
tEl 
where Bt E Dt and Bt differs from Et for only a finite number oft. Then we have 
IA = IB(X) =II IB,(Xt)• 
tEl 
By the assumption, Equation (21.14) holds. This completes the proof. 
21.12. Let D = {( -oo, c] : c E R}. Then Dis a 1r-system and by Problem 2.4, 
B = CT(D). By Problem 21.9, we have CT(Xt : t E I) = CT(X). By Problem 21.11, it 
is sufficient to show that M includes every mapping V : 0-+ [0, 1] having the form 
where At E D and At differs from R for only a finite number oft.

To do this, letS = { s E I : As cf R }. For each s E S, let As = ( -oo, cs] for 
some Cs < oo. Let !s,n : R--+ [0, 1] be defined as

Then !s,n• n > 1, are bounded continuous functions and fs.n t IA., as n --+ oo. 
Hence

The result follows from the assumption. This completes the proof. 
21.13. 
Let u E R be fixed. We show that the map is continuous at an arbitrary 
point t. To do that, let E > 0. Since y --+ eiuy is continuous at the origin, we can find 
51 > 0 such that 
for all y E (-51 , ol). Also by the assumption that { Xt : t ~ 0} is stochastically 
continuous, we can find 52 > 0 such that 
for all h E ( -02, 02). 
Then for all h E (-52 , 52 ), we have

21.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced stochastic processes. The general definition of stochas-
tic process is adopted from Kallenberg (1997) and Revuz and Yor (1999). Karatzas 
and Shreve (1988) studied stochastic processes with (R d, B(R d)) as the state space. 
For a proof of Kolmogorov's existence theorem, readers are referred to Billingsley 
(1995). For a proof of Kolmogorov's continuity theorem, readers are referred to 
Stroock and Varadhan (1979). 
Brzezniak and Zastawniak (1999) is a textbook that introduces stochastic pro-
cesses base on a measure theoretic framework. Other books that introduce stochas-
tic processes on a measure theoretic framework include c;inlar (1974), Liptser and 
Shiryayev (1977), Kannan (1979), Doob (1990), Billingsley (1995), Koralov and 
Sinai (2007), and c;inlar (2011). For introduction to stochastic processes without 
measure theory, readers are referred to Karlin and Taylor (1975), Karlin and Taylor 
(1981), Resnick (1992), Ross (1995), Stirzaker (2005), and Ross (2010). 
There are also several problem books on stochastic processes. For example, 
Brzezniak and Zastawniak (1999) is a problem book that is suitable for final year 
undergraduate students. Takacs (1960), Baldi et al. (2002), and Gusak et al. (2010) 
are also problem books on stochastic processes. 


CHAPTER 22 
MARTINGALES 
A martingale is a special stochastic process whose increments over an interval in 
future have zero expectation given information of the past history of the process. 
Martingales play a central role in the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic 
calculus. In this chapter, we present the definition of martingales. 
22.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 22.1 (Martingale). Let I be a set. A stochastic process X = (Xt : t E I)

the following three conditions: 
(a) X is adapted to the filtration. 
(b) E(IXtl) < oo for all t E I. 
(c) E[Xtlffs] = X 8 a.s. for all s:::; t. 
Definition 22.2 (Supermartingale). Let I be a set. A stochastic process X = (Xt : 
t E I) is called a supermartingale relative to a filtration ( { fft : t E I}, P) if the 
process satisfies the following three conditions:

22.3 Hints 
22.1. Use the tower property of the conditional expectations (see Problem 14.10). 
22.2. Follow the definition of martingales (see Definition 22.1) and use Theorem 
11.2andtheresultsofProblem 13.3, 14.4, 14.5,and 14.16. 
22.3. Use the definition of martingales (Definition 22.1) and the definition of con-
ditional expectations (Definition 14.1). 
22.4. Use the results of Problems 14.6 and 5.10. 
22.5. Use the definition of martingales (Definition 22.1) and Theorem 13.2.

SOLUTIONS 
295 
(see Problem 14.10) and using the relation Yn+l-Xn+1 = Yn-Xn+(1-Mn)(Xn-
Xn+1) recursively. Part (c) can be proved similarly. 
22.10. Follow the definition of discrete martingales (Definition 22.1). 
22.11. Use the result ofProb1em 22.10. 
22.12. To prove the sufficiency ("only if") part, use the definition of martingales and 
the tower property of conditional expectations (see Problem 14.10). Use the method 
of contradiction to prove the necessity part. 
22.4 Solutions 
22.1. 
Note that {$n : n ~ 0} is a filtration, which is an increasing family of 
a-fields. By Problem 14.10, we have 
(22.1) 
Since X is a martingale, we have E[Xnl.%n-1] = Xn-1· Substituting Xn-1 into 
Equation (22.1) gives 
E[Xnl.%m] = E[Xn-1l.%m]· 
Repeating the above process gives E[Xnl.%m] = E[Xml.%m]. By Problem 14.4, we 
have E[Xnl.%m] = Xm. This completes the proof. 
22.2. To show that S is a martingale, we only need to verify that S satisfies the three 
conditions. First, by Theorem 11.2 we know that Sn is a .%n-measurable function 
for each n ~ 0. Hence Sn is adapted to the filtration. Then, by Problem 13.3 and the 
assumption, we have 
E(ISnl) 
E (ltxil) 
< E (tiXil) 
n 
i=1 
< 
00 
for all n ~ 0. Finally, by Problem 14.5 and the assumption, we have 
Noting that Sn-1 is .%n-1-measurable, by Problem 14.4 we have E(Sn-1l$n_1) = 
Sn-1· Also noting that Xn and $n_1 are independent, by Problem 14.16 we have 

296 
MARTINGALES 
E(Xnlffn-d = E(Xn) = 0. Hence E(Snlffn-d = Sn-1· This completes the 
proof. 
22.3. 
(a) By the assumption that {Xn}n>o is integrable, we have E(IXnl) < oo for 
n?: 0. Note that {Xn}n:;:.o is adapted to the filtration. We only need to verify 
that E(Xn+llffn) = Xn is equivalent to 
But this equation is implied by Definition 14.1 and the assumption. This com-
pletes the proof. 
(b) The proof is similar to that of part (a). 
22.4. 
By Problem 5.10, we have max(Xn, Yn), which is adapted to the filtration 
{ ffn : n ?: 0}. In addition, 
Hence we only need to verify that 
(22.2) 
By the assumption that (Xn : n ?: 0) and (Yn : n ?: 0) are submartingales and 
Problem 14.6, we have 
and 
E[max(Xn, Yn)lffn-1] ?: E[Ynlffn-d?: Yn-1· 
The above two inequalities imply that Inequality (22.2) is true. This completes the 
proof. 
22.5. By definition of Xn, Xn is ffn-measurable. By Theorem 13.2, we have 
E(IXnl) = E ( IT; ) =IT E (I; I)· 
]=1 
J 
.)=1 
.1 
Since E(Yn), n = 1, 2, ... exist, we have E(IXnl) < oo. By Theorem 13.2, we have 

SOLUTIONS 
297 
Hence { Xn}n~ 1 is a martingale with respect to the filtration { §n : n ~ 1 }. 
22.6. By definition, Xn = E(YI§n) is §n-measurable. In addition, by Problems 
15.7 and 14.10, we have 
By Problem 14.10, we have 
E[E(YI§n)l§n-1] 
E(YI§n-1) 
Xn-1, 
n ~ 1. 
Hence {Xn}n>o is a martingale. This completes the proof. 
22.7. We only need to verify the last condition of submartingales: 
But by Problem 15.7 and the assumption that g is convex, we have 
By the assumption that {Xn}n~ 1 is a submartingale, we have 
E(Xn+ll§n) ~ Xn, 
n ~ 1. 
(22.3) 
Note that g is also an increasing function. The inequality (22.3) is true. This com-
pletes the proof. 
22.8. We only need to verify the last condition of submartingales, i.e, 
But by Problem 15.7 and the assumption that g is convex, we have 
By the assumption that {Xn}n>1 is a martingale, we have 
E(Xn+1l§n) = Xn, 
n ~ 1. 
Hence the inequality (22.4) is true. This completes the proof. 
22.9. 
(22.4) 
(a) It is obvious that Yn is §n-measurable and E(IYnl) < oo for all n ~ 1. Noting 
that Mn is a Borel measurable function of X 1, X 2 , ... , Xn and that {Xn}n~ 1 
is a submartingale, we have 
E(Yn + Mn(Xn+l- Xn)l§n) 
Yn + MnE(Xn+l- Xnl§n) 
> Yn. 

298 
MARTINGALES 
Hence {Yn}n2:l is also a submartingale with respect to the filtration { §n : n 2: 
1 }. 
(b) By definition, we have 
Subtracting Xn+l from both sides of the above equation gives 
which is equivalent to 
Taking expectation of both sides of the above equation gives 
By Problem 14.10, we have 
E[(1- Mn)(Xn- Xn+I)J 
E(E[(1- Mn)(Xn- Xn+I)I§n]) 
E((1- Mn)(Xn- E[Xn+1l§n]). 
Noting that { Xn}n> 1 is a submartingale, we have 
Hence 
(1- Mn)(Xn- E(Xn+ll§n) :::; 0. 
Combining inequalities (22.5), (22.6), and (22.7) gives 
E(Yn+l- Xn+1) :::; E(Yn- Xn), 
n 2: 1. 
Note that E(Y1 -XI) = 0. We have E(Yn- Xn) :::; 0 for all n 2: 1. 
(c) The proof is similar to those of parts (a) and (b). 
(22.6) 
(22.7) 
22.10. For each n 2: 1, An is Fn_1-measurable. Hence Xn- An is jOn-measurable. 
Thus, Mn is adapted to the §n· Since Xn is a submartingale, we have 
n 
< E(IXnl) + L {E(E(IXill§i_I)) + E(IXi-11)} 
i=1 
n 
E(IXnl) + L {E(IXil) + E(IXi-11)} 
i=1 
< 
00. 

Now for n 2::: 1, we have 
E(Mnlffn-1) 
E(Xnlffn-d - E(Anlffn-d 
E(Xnlffn-d- An 
n 
n 
SOLUTIONS 
299 
E(Xnlffn-d- LE(Xilffi_I) + LXi-1 
i=1 
i=1 
Therefore, Mn is a martingale. 
22.11. Let Ao = 0 and 
n 
i=1 
Then for each n 2::: 1, An is ffn_1-measurable. Since the Xn is a submartingale, we 
have 
An= E[Xnlffn-1]- Xn-d + An-1 2::: An-1, 
n 2::: 1. 
Now let Mn = Xn - An. By Problem 22.10, the Mn is a martingale. This 
completes the proof. 
22.12. 
First, let us prove the sufficiency. Suppose that { Xt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a 
martingale. Then by Definition 22.1 we have 
E[Xrlffo] = Xo. 
By Problem 14.10, we get 
E[Xr] = E(E[Xrlffo]) = E[Xo]. 
Now let us prove the necessity. Suppose that E[Xr] = E[X0]. Since {Xt : 0:::; 
t :::; T} be a supermartingale, we have 
E[Xtlffs] :S: Xs 
a.s. 
for all s :::; t. Hence we have 
E[Xr] :::; E[Xt] :::; E[Xs] :::; E[Xo] 
for all 0 :::; s :::; t :::; T. By the assumption, we get E[Xs] = E[Xt] for all s :::; t. Let 
An= {Xs- E[Xtlffs] > 1/n} for n 2::: 1. Then for s < t, we have 
1 
0 = E[Xs]- E[Xt] = E(Xs- E[Xtlffs]) 2::: -P(An), 
n 
which implies P(An) = 0. By Theorem 2.2, we have P(lim sup An) = 0. But 
{Xs- E[Xtlffs] > 0} ~ limsupAn. 
Hence we have P{Xs- E[Xtlffs] > 0} = 0; that is, X 8
- E[Xtlffs] = 0 a.s. 
Therefore, { Xt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a martingale. This completes the proof.

MARTINGALES 
22.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we defined the martingale. Since the martingale is the most basic 
concept in stochastic processes and stochastic calculus, it has been studied in many 
books such as Karlin and Taylor (1975), Williams (1991), Resnick (1999), Shorack 
(2000), Chung (2000), Klebaner (2005), Gut (2007), and Pascucci (2011). Baldi 
et al. (2002) is a problem book with martingales. For some interesting applications 
of martingales, readers are referred to Ross ( 1995). 

CHAPTER 23 
STOPPING TIMES 
Stopping times are important tools that allow us to analyze stochastic processes by 
viewing them at random times. In this chapter, we present a definition and relevant 
results of stopping times. 
23.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 23.1 (Discrete Stopping Time). Let (0, $, P) be a probability space and 
{ $n, n = 0, 1, 2, ... } an increasing sequence of sub-a-fields of$. A stopping time 
for { $n : n 2: 0} is a function 
T: n-+ {o, 1, ... , oo}

Definition 23.3 (Events Prior to T). Let { $n, n = 0, 1, 2, ... } be an increasing 
sequence of sub-a-fields of$. LetT be a stopping time for {$n : n 2: 0}. An 
event A E $ is said to be prior to T if and only if 
The collection of all sets prior toT is denoted by $r: 
$r ={A E $: An {T :<:::; n} E $n, n = 0, 1, ... }. 
For a continuous stopping time 7 with respect to a filtration { $t : a :<:::; t :<:::; b }, the 
quantity $r is defined as

process adapted to some filtration { $t : t 2: 0}. Let A be a measurable subset of R. 
The hitting time of A is defined as 
{ inf{t 2: 0: Xt E A}, 
if {t 2: 0: Xt E A} =j;0;

23.1. By definition, we only need to show that { S V T :::; n} and { S 1\ T :::; n} are

{ S V T :::; n} = { S :::; n} n {T:::; n}

STOPPING TIMES 
and 
{S 1\ T :S: n} = {S :S: n} U {T :S: n}. 
By the assumption that SandT are stopping times, we have {S V T:::; n} E §n 
and { S 1\ T :::; n} E § n. This completes the proof. 
23.2. By definition of stopping times, we only need to show that {T :::; n} E §n, 
n 2": 0. Note that 
n 
{T :S: n} = U {Xk E B}, 
n 2": 0. 
k=O 
We have {T :::; n} E §n· Hence Tis a stopping time. 
23.3. By the definition of stopping times, we have 0 n {T:::; n} = {T :::; n} E §n. 
n = 0, 1, .... Hence 0 E §r. 
Now let A E §r. Then An {T:::; n} E §n, n = 0, 1, .... Note that 
and §n is a £T-field. We have Ac n {T:::; n} E §n, n = 0, 1, .... Hence AcE §r. 
Finally, let Ai E §r, i = 0, 1, .... Then Ai n {T :S: n} E §n, n = 0, 1, .... 
Note that 
(Q Ai) n {T:::; n} = Q[Ai n {T:::; n}]. 
We have U:o Ai E §r. Therefore, §Tis a O"-field. 
23.4. Let A E § s. Then 
An {S :S: n} E §n,

By the assumption that S :::; T, we have 
Hence 
An{T:S:n}

{T:S:n}<;;;; U{S=k}. 
k=O 
A n (Qo { 
S = k}) n {T :::; n} 
CQ0[A n {S = k}]) n {T:::; n}. 
Since Sis a stopping time for {§n: n 2": 0}, we have An {S = k} E §k <;;;; §n, 
k = 0, 1, ... , n. Therefore, the above equation implies that An {T :S: n} E §n· 
Hence A E §r. Since A is arbitrary, we have §s <;;;; §r. This completes the proof.

309 
23.5. Let BE B. Note that Xy; 1(B) ={wE 0: Xr(w) E B} = {Xr E B}. To 
show that Xr is §r-measurable, we only need show that {Xr E B} E §r. Note 
that

{Xr E B} n {T:::; n} = U [{Xk E B} n {T = k}] 
k=O 
and {Xn}n>o is adapted to {§n, n = 0, 1, 2, ... }. We have 
{Xr E B} n {T:::; n} E §n· 
Hence {Xr E B} E §r. Since B is arbitrary, Xr is §r-measurable. 
Since §T <;;; §, Xr is also §-measurable, that is, Xr is a random variable on 
(0, §, P). This completes the proof.

First, let us show that inequality (23.1) is true. By Problem 22.7, {X;{}n=l,2, ... ,m is

But {T ::::; m} = 0. It follows that inequality (23.1) is true. 
Next, let us prove inequality (23.2). Since {Xn}n=1,2, ... ,m is a submartingale and 
{T = m} = {T ~ m} = {T::::; m- 1}c E §m_ 1, by Problem 22.3, we have

But {T ~ 1} = 0. It follows that inequality (23.2) is true. This completes the proof. 
23.7. 
(a) By Problems 23.4 and 23.3, and the assumption that {Tn : n ~ 1} is increasing, 
{ .9"r, : i ~ 1} is a filtration. 
(b) Let Yi = Xr,, i = 1, 2, .... Since 
theY; are integrable. By Problem 22.3, to show that {Yi : i ~ 1} is a martingale 
with respect to {Ti : i ~ 1 }, we only need to show that 
i Yi+1dP = i Y;dP, 
\lA E .9"r" i ~ 1.

Let i ~ 1 and A E .9"r,. Since Ti is finite, we have

Then, to show that Equation (23.3) holds, it is sufficient to show that

where Dk =An {Ti = k}. 
Since Ti+1 is finite and Ti+l ?: Ti, we have 
(23.5) 
Since {Ti+l = m} = {Ti+1 ?: m} = {Ti+l :::; m- 1}c E §m_1, we have 
Dk n {Ti+1 = m} E §m_1. By the assumption that {Xn}n>1 is a martingale

Repeating the above process, we get 
Since Dk c;;- {Ti+l ;::: k }, we have Dk n {Ti+l ;::: k} = Dk. Hence the above 
equation becomes 
which shows that Equation (23.4) is true. Hence {X T, : i ;::: 1} is a martingale 
with respect to the §Ti. 
(c) The proof is similar to that of part (b). 
23.8. Let A E :!771 and t ;::: 0. Then we have 
A n { T2 :::; t} = [A n { T2 :::; t} n { T1 :::; t}] u [A n { T2 :::; t} n { T1 > t} ]. 
By the assumption that T1 :::; T2 , we have { T2 :::; t} n { T1 > t} = 0. Hence 
A n { T2 :::; t} = A n { T2 :::; t} n { T1 :::; t}. 
Since A n { T1 :::; t} E §

Since tis arbitrary, we have A E .'#T2. Hence § 71 c;;- :!772 . This completes the proof. 
23.9. 
(a) By Problem 23.8, we have .'#71 M2 c;;- .'#7 , n .'#72 . Hence we only need to prove

To do that, let A E .'#7, n §72 and t ;::: 0. Then we have A n { T] :::; t} E fft 
and A n { T2 :::; t} E .'#1 for all t ;::: 0. Note that 
Hence we have A n { T1 1\ T2 :::; t} E § 1. Since t is arbitrary, we have A E

(b) Let t ;::: 0. Since 
and {T1 1\ t :::; T2 1\ t}, {T1 :::; t}, and {T2 :::; t} are events in § 1, we have 
{ T1 :::; T2 } E :#72 • Similarly, we have { T1 < T2 } E :#72 • Since .'l'T2 is CJ-

If we interchange the roles of 7 1 and 7 2, we see that these events also belong to 
$ r 1 • Hence by the first item, these events belong to $ r 1 Ar2 . 
This completes the proof. 
23.10. First let us prove the "if" part. Suppose that 
{7 < t} E §t for all t E [a,b]. 
Then we have 
{ 7 < t + ~} E §t+ ~ for all n ?: 1. 
By the assumption that the §t is right-continuous, we have 
00 
g-t = n 
g-t+~· 
n=l 
Therefore, we have 
Since t is arbitrary, 7 is the stopping time by definition. 
Now let us prove the "only if" part. Suppose that 7 is the stopping time with 
respect to the filtration. Then we have { 7 :::.; t} E §t for all t E [a, b ]. Note that 
and 
{ 7:::.; t- ~} E §t-~ ~ §t. 
We have { 7 < t} E §t. This completes the proof. 
23.11. Lett E I be fixed. Let f2t = {7:::.; t} and .#t ={An f2t :A E §t}. Let 
f : f2t -+ [0, t] X f2t be defined as 
f(w) = (7(w),w). 
Let g : [0, t] X nt -+ E be defined as 
g(s,w) = X 8 (w). 
Then Xr =go f, that is, Xr is the composition of maps f and g. By the assumption 
that X is progressively measurable, g on [0, t] x n is B[O, t] x §t/8'-measurable. 
Hence the restriction of g on [0, t] x f2t is measurable with respect to the a-fields 
{An ([0, t] x f2t): A E B[O, t] x §t} and 8'.

Hence we only need to show that f is a measurable map. To do that, let C E

Hence f is a measurable map. This completes the proof. 
23.12. Let t E [ 0, oo). Let Kt be the largest integer in { 0, 1, ... , 2" - 1} such that 
K~;; 1 t0 ~ t. Then we have 
K, {

{T(n)~t}=U T~ ;, to. 
k=O 
Since T is a stopping time with respect to { fft : t 2::: 0}, we have 
k=0,1, ... ,Kt. 
It follows that { T(n) ~ t} E fft. Hence T(n) is a stopping time. This completes the 
proof. 
23.13. 
By Problem 23.1 0, it is sufficient to show that 
To do that, we show that 
{TA < t} = U {Xq E A}, 
qEQn(o.t) 
where Q is the set of rational numbers. Let 
wE U {Xq E A}. 
qEQn(O,t) 
(23.9) 
Thenw E {Xq E A}forsomerationalnumberin(O,t). HenceTA(w) ~ q < t, 
which implies that wE {TA < t}. Therefore, we have 
U {Xq E A}~ {TA < t}. 
(23.1 0) 
qEQn(O,t) 
Now let wE {TA < t}. Then we have XrA(w) (w) EA. Since A is an open set, 
there exists an E > 0 such that 

SOLUTIONS

Since Xt is right-continuous, there exists a o E (0, t- TA(w)) such that for 
every r E (TA(w), TA(w) + o), 
IXr(w)- XrA(w)(w)l <E. 
Let q be a rational number in (TA(w), TA(w) + o). Then we have 
Hence wE {Xq E A}. Since w is arbitray, we have 
{TA < t} s;;; U {Xq E A}. 
qEQn(O,t) 
(23.11) 
Equation (23.9) follows from Equations (23.10) and (23.11). Since {TA < t} 
is a countable union of elements in fft. we have {TA < t} E fft. 
(a) This follows from part (a) because Tv = TR\D· 
This completes the proof. 
23.14. For every n ~ 1, let 
An= { x E R: inf{IY- xl: yEA}< ~}. 
Then An is an open set for all n ~ 1. We claim that 
{TA:::; t} = {Xt E A} U ( n U {Xq E An}) . 
n=l qEQn[O,t) 
(23.12) 
To show this, let wE {TA :::; t}. IfTA(w) = t, then we have wE {Xt E A}. Hence 
we have 
{TA:::; t} s;;; {Xt E A} U ( n U {Xq E An}) . 
n=l qEQn[o,t) 
(23.13) 
Suppose that TA(w)) < t. Note that for every n ~ 1, there exists an En > 0 such 
that 
(XrA(w)(w)- En, XrA(w)(w) +En) s;;; An. 
Since the Xt is right-continuous, there exists a On E (0, t- TA(w)) such that for 
every r E (TA(w), TA(w) +On). we have 

316 
STOPPING TIMES 
Let qn be a rational number in (TA(w), TA(w) + 8n)· Then we have Xqn (w) E An, 
which implies wE {Xqn E An}· Hence for every n;::: 1, we have 
wE U {Xq E An}· 
qEQn[O,t) 
Thus Equation (23.13) still holds in this case. 
Now let 
wE{XtEA}U (n U {XqEAn}). 
n=l qEQn[o,t) 
If wE {Xt E A}, then TA(w) ::; t, which implies wE {TA ::; t}. Suppose that 
w E ( n U { Xq E An}) . 
n=l qEQn[o,t) 
Then for every n ;::: 1, we have w E {Xqn E An} for some rational number qn 
in [0, t). Let Tn = infr::::n qn and let r = limn---+oo Tn· Then we haver ::; t and 
Xr(w) E A. Hence we have TA(w) ::; r ::; t, which implies that w E {TA ::; t}. 
Therefore, we have 
{Xt E A} U (n U {Xq E An}) ~ {TA::; t}. 
n=l qEQn[O,t) 
(23.14) 
It follows from Equations (23.13) and (23.14) that Equation (23.12) holds. Since the 
right-hand side of Equation (23.12) is a countable union of 9"rmeasurable sets, we 
have {TA ::; t} E 9"t. This completes the proof. 
23.15. 
By the assumption that P( T < oo) = 1, we know that T 1\ t = T for 
sufficiently large t outside a P-null set. Hence Xrl\t = Xr a.s. as t ---+ oo. Now, by 
the assumption that Xrl\t is uniformly integrable and Problem 9.10, we have 
lim E[Xr/\t] = E[Xr]· 
t---+oo 
By Theorem 23.2, we have 
E[Xrl\t] = E(E[Xrl\tl9"o]) = E(XrAo) = E[Xo]. 
Hence E[Xrl\t] = E[X0]. This completes the proof.

23.16. By Problem 23.5, X 7 is $
7 -measurable. Let N = {0, 1, ... , oo }. Then by 
Definition 14.1 and the definition of Xn, we have

"f_hr=n} IXnldP 
< "f_hr=n} E[IZII$n]dP

= 
E[IZI]. 
Since Z is integrable, X 7 is also integrable. 
Now let A E $r- Since 
we have

It follows from Definition 14.1 that X 7 = E[ZI$7 ]. This completes the proof. 
23.17. 
Let Yn = E[XMI$n] for all n ~ 0. By Problem 23.16, {Yn XM} is a 
martingale. By the assumption that { Xn : n ~ 0} is a martingale, we have Yn = Xn 
for 0 :-:; n :-:; M. Since T :-:; M a.s., {X7 , XM} is a martingale. This completes the 
proof.

Then A = U%"=1 Ak. where 
By Definition 14.1 and the assumption that {Xn : n 2: 0} is a submartingale, we 
have 
which implies that P(Ak) = 0. Since Ak t A ask -t oo, it follows from Problem 
11.6 that P(A) = 0. Hence 
This completes the proof. 
23.19. Let 
71 = inf{t: Xt =A}, 
72 = inf{t: Xt = -B}. 
Then 7 = 71 A72 and {XT =A}= {71 < 72}. By Theorem 23.1, we have 
E[XT] = E(E[XTig-o]) = E[Xo] = 0. 
But by Problem 14.18, we have 
E[XTI71 < 72]P{71 < 72} + E[XTI71 < 72]P{71 > 72} 
AP{XT =A}- B(l- P{XT =A}). 
Combining the above two equations gives

In this chapter, we introduced the concept of stopping times and relevant results. The 
proofs of Theorems 23.1 and 23.2 can be found in Bhattacharya and Waymire (2007) 
and Pascucci (2011). Jeanblanc et al. (2009) studied hitting times for Brownian 
motions. For more properties of stopping times, readers are referred to Williams

CHAPTER 24 
MARTINGALE INEQUALITIES 
Martingale inequalities are important in the study of stochastic differential equa-
tions. For example, martingale inequalities are used to establish bounds of solutions 
to stochastic differential equations. In this chapter, we present several important 
martingale inequalities. 
24.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Theorem 24.1 (Doob's Submartingale Inequality). Let {yt 
a ::; t < b} be a 
right-continuous submartingale. Then for any E > 0, we have 
where yb+ = max(Yb, 0). In particular, if the yt is a right-continuous martingale, 
then for any E > 0, we have

Then T is a bounded stopping time. It follows from Problem 23.18 that X,. <

By the definition of conditional expectation (Definition 14.1), we have

MARTINGALE INEQUALITIES 
Combining Equations (24.3), (24.4), (24.5), and (24.6) proves the inequality. This

To prove the claim, we only need to show that

To do that, let wE {Mb >>.}.Then there exists as E [0, b] such that X,,(w) > >.. 
Since X is right-continuous, there exist K and N such that

Since w is arbitrary, the claim is valid.

The result follows immediately by taking powers of a on both sides of the above

Then Tis a stopping time with respect to the underlying filtration { §'i : 1 :::; i :::; m}. 
By Theorem 23.1, we have 
Since T = m on the event A c, we have

Since

Then T is a stopping time with respect to the underlying filtration { g;i : 1 $_ i $_ m}. 
By Theorem 23.1, we have

In this chapter, we introduced some inequalities for martingales. Doob's submartin-
gale inequality has two versions: a discrete version (see Problem 24.2) and a con-
tinuous version (see Theorem 24.1). The continuous version can be proved by the 
discrete version. For such a proof, readers are referred to Bhattacharya and Waymire 
(2007, p41). More information about martingale inequalities can be found in Brzez-
niak and Zastawniak (1999), Chung (2000), Chung and Lu (2006), and Gut (2007).

Martingale convergence theorems state that under certain conditions, a martingale, 
submartingale, or supermartingale converges to a limiting random variable. In this 
chapter, we shall present several martingale convergence theorems.

Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 25.1 (Crossing of Real Numbers). Let { Xn : n ~ 0} be a sequence of real 
numbers. Let a < b be real numbers. The sequence { T n (a, b) : n ~ 0} of crossings 
with respect to the sequence { Xn : n ~ 0} is defined by 
To(a, b)= 0,

where A2n-I = {k 2: T2n-2: Xk:::; a} and A2n = {k 2: T2n-I : Xk 2: b}. 
Definition 25.2 (Crossing of Random Variables). Let {Xn : n 2: 0} be a sequence of 
real random variables. Let a < b be real numbers. The sequence { T n (a, b) : n 2: 0} 
of crossings with respect to the sequence {Xn : n 2: 0} is defined as follows. For 
every w E 0, { T n (a, b) ( w) : n 2: 0} is the sequence of crossings with respect to the 
sequence {Xn(w) : n 2: 0}. 
Definition 25.3 (§00 ). Let {§n: n 2: 0} be a filtration. Then §
00 is the a-algebra 
generated by U~=O §n:

martingale with respect to the filtration {§n: n 2: 1}. If

Let TI = TI (w) be the first integer in {1, 2, ... , n} such that Xr, :::; a. Let T2 be 
the first integer greater than TI such that Xr2 2: b. Let T3 be the first integer greater

25.3 Hints 
25.1. Use the definition of convergences (Definition 1.1 0). 
25.2. Use the result of Problems 25 .I and ll.l. 
25.3. Use the optional skipping theorem (see Problem 22.9) and the result of Prob-
lem 22.7. First consider the case when a = 0 and Xk ~ 0. Then consider the case 
(Xk- a)+. 
25.4. 
Use Chebyshev's inequality (see Problem 6.16) and the tower property of 
conditional expectations (see Problem 14.1 0). 
25.5. Use the results of Problems 22.6 and 25.4, and the submartingale convergence 
theorem (Theorem 25.1 ). 
25.6. Use the result of Problem 9.11. 
25.7. To prove (a) ===? (b), use Theorem 25.1 and the results of Problems 9.11, 
9.4, 9.2, and 9.12. To prove (b) ===? (c), use the result of Problem 9.14. To prove 
(c) ===? (d), consider Y = X=. To prove (d) ===? (a), use the result of Problem 
25.4. 
25.8. Theproofof(a) ===?(b)===? (c)isthesameasthatofProblem25.7. The 
proof of (c) ===? (a) is similar to that of Problem 25.4. 
25.4 Solutions 
25.1. Let use first prove the necessity ("only if") part. Suppose that 
v(a,b) = max{k: T2k(a,b) < oc} < oo 
for all a, b E Q, a < b. We claim that 
liminfxn = limsupxn· 
(25.2) 
If lim inf Xn -1- lim sup Xn, there exist rational numbers a and b such that 
liminfxn <a< b < limsupxrz, 

SOLUTIONS 
337 
which implies that v( a, b) = oo. This contradicts our hypothesis. Hence Equation 
(25.2) must hold. By Definition 1.10, { Xn : n :::: 0} converges. 
Now let us prove the sufficiency. Suppose that {xn: n:::: 0} converges. Then by 
Definition 1.10, Equation (25.2) holds. We claim that 
v(a, b)= max{k: T2k(a, b)< oo} < oo 
(25.3) 
for all a, bE Q, a< b. If v(a, b) = oo for some a, bE Q, a< b, then we must have 
infinitely many x's below a and infinitely many x's above b. Hence we have 
lim inf Xn :':: a < b :':: lim sup Xn, 
which implies that { Xn : n :::: 0} does not converge. This contradicts our hypothesis. 
Hence Equation (25.3) must hold. This completes the proof. 
25.2. For a given w E 0, it follows from Problem 25 .I that {X n ( w) : n :::: 0} if and 
only if 
v(a, b)(w) = max{k: T2k(a, b)(w) < oo} < oo 
for all a, b E Q, a < b. Hence we have 
{wE 0: {Xn(w): n:::: 0} converges}= n {v(a,b)<oo}. 
a,bEQ,a<b 
If P{w E 0: {Xn(w) : n:::: 0} = 1, then we have 
p ( n {v(a,b) < oo}) = 1, 
a,bEQ,a<b 
which implies that P{v(a, b) < oo} = 1 for all a, bE Q, a< b. 
If P { v( a, b) < oo} = 1 for all a, b E Q, a < b, then it follows from Problem 
11.1 that 
p( n {v(a,b)<oo})=1, 
a,bEQ,a<b 
which gives 
P{w E 0: {Xn(w): n:::: 0} = 1. 
This completes the proof. 
25.3. First, assume that a= 0 and Xk :::: 0 fork :::: 1. Then the resulting inequality 
becomes 
Let Mk be defined as 
{
0 ifT2j-2::; k < T2j-l forsomej:::: 1; 
Mk= 
1 if T21 _ 1 ::; k < T21 for some j :::: 1, 
(25.4) 
k = 1, 2, ... , n- 1. 

338

Then let Yn be defined as 
k-1 
Yk = X1 + LMj(XJ+l- Xj), 
k = 1,2, ... ,n. 
j=l 
By Problem 22.9, we have 
But 
(25.5) 
if N is even; 
if N is odd. 
Noting that X 1 2': 0, we have Yn 2': bU0b, which gives 
(25.6) 
Combining inequalities (25.5) and (25.6) gives (25.4). 
Now we consider the general case. By Problem 22.7, (Xk -a)+ is a submartin-
gale. Since Xk upcrossing (a, b) is equivalent to (Xk- a)+ upcrossing (0, b- a), 
applying the above result proves the problem. This completes the proof. 
25.4. 
Let E > 0. Note that IYII{IYI<n} t IYI as n -t oo. By the monotone 
convergence theorem (Theorem 6.2), we have 
r IYII{IYI<n}dP = r 
IYidP t r IYidP as 
n -t 00.

If we choose c > 2N E(IYI) / E, we have

Since E is arbitrary, the conclusion follows. This completes the proof. 
25.5. 
By Problem 22.6, {Xn} is a martingale. By Problem 25.4, the Xn are 
uniformly integrable. By the assumption that Y is integrable and Problem 14.10, we 
have 
Hence, by Theorem 25.1, there exists an integrable random variable Xco such that 
X 
a.e. X 
n -----+

Note that the probability measure Pis finite. By Egoroff's theorem (see Problem 
9.4), Xn converges to Xco almost uniformly. By Problem 9.2, Xn .!!:..t Xco. By 
Ll 
Problem 9.12, Xn-+ Xco. 
Now we show that Xco is a version of E(YI~co)· Since Xco is integrable, we 
have E(IXcol) < oo. Since Xn is ~co-measurable, Xco is also ~co-measurable. 
Let A E ~co· Then 
IL YdP-i XcodPI

Since Xn -+ X co, we have 
By definition of conditional expectation, we have Xco = E(YI~co) a.e. This com-
pletes the proof. 
25.6. By the definition of conditional expectation and the hypothesis, we have

25.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented several convergence theorems for submartingales. The 
proof of Theorem 25.1 can be found in Ash and Doleans-Dade (1999) and Gut 
(2007). Lawler (2006) presented many examples of applying the martingale con-
vergence theorems. Hall and Heyde ( 1980) is a book devoted to martingale limit 
theory.

A random walk is a simple discrete stochastic process formed by successive sum-

Hints 
26.1. Consider the filtration given by

Part (c) is implied by part (b) (see Problem 23.1). To prove (d), we follow the defini-
tion of uniform integrability (Definition 9 .6) and part (c). Part (e) can be proved by 
the result of Problem 23.15. 
26.4. To prove part (a), consider different values of Z 1 and use the result of Problem 
14.18. To prove parts (b) and (c), consider cp(Nl) and cp(N2) and use part (a). 
26.5. 
Apply Doob's maximal inequality to {(q/p) 8 n 
: n ~ 0} to prove part (a). 
Use the result of Problem 13.10 to prove part (b). 
26.6. Note that 
{ max Sj ~ m} = {SN ~ m} U (D

where Aj = {81 < m, 8 2 < m, ... , Sj-1 < m, Sj = m} for j = 1, 2, ... , N. 
26.7. 
Consider lnSn(t) and use the classical central limit theorem (see Problem 
20.4) and the result of Problem 20.2. 
26.4 Solutions 
26.1. Let §'o = {0, !l} and §'n = a(Zk : k = 1, 2, ... , n) for n ~ 1. 
(a) By Schwarz's inequality (Theorem 8.3), we have 
E[ISn - J.tnl] ~ lxl + niJ.LI + nE[IZ1 - J.LI] ~ lxl + na < oo. 
Hence Sn- nJ.L is integrable. By Problem 14.4, we have 
Bn-1 + E[Zn - J.LI§'n-1] 
= Bn-1 + E[Zn -
J.L] 
= 
Bn-1· 
Hence { Sn - J.Ln : n ~ 0} is a martingale. 
(b) By Problem 15.6, we have 
E [J(Sn- J.Ln) 2 - a 2nJ] ~ na2 +n2E [(Z1 - J.L) 2] = (n+n 2)a2 < oo, 
which shows that (Sn- J.Ln) 2 - a 2n is integrable. In addition, by Problem 14.4 
we have 
E[(Sn- J.Ln) 2 - a 2nl§'n-1] 
(Sn-1- (n- 1)J.L)2 - na2 + E[2(Zn- J.L)(Sn-1- (n- 1)J.L) 
+(Zn- J.L?I§'n-1] 
(Sn-1 - (n- l)J.L)2 - na2 + 2(Sn-l - (n- l)J.L)E[(Zn - J.L)] 
+E[(Zn- J.L) 2] 
(Sn-1- (n- l)J.L) 2 - (n- l)a2 .

Hence { (Sn- ;m) 2 -
(J 2n: n;::: 0} is a martingale. 
(c) If E[euz,] = oo, then exp(uSn- nlnE[euz,]) = 0. It is a martingale. We 
assume that E[euz,] < oo. Since 
exp( uSn - n ln E[euz,]) = (E[euz, ])-n exp( uSn) 
and Zn 's are independent, by Theorem 13.2 we have, 
E[exp(uSn- nlnE[euz'])]

Also we have 
(E[euz,]) -n E[exp( uSn) l»'n-1]

(E[euz, ])-n+leus,_,. 
Hence { exp( uSn - n ln E[euZ']) : n ;::: 0} is a martingale. 
(d) Let u be such that eu = (1- p)jp in part (c). Then we have 
E[e"z1 ] = eup + e-u(1- p) = 1 
and 
exp(uSn- nlnE[euz,]) = C; P) Sn 
By part (c), we obtain that 
is a martingale. 
This completes the proof. 
26.2. If t = 0, the conclusion is trivial. Lett > 0 be fixed. Let Fn be the distribution 
function of A1[nt]/ J[nij: 
{ M[nt] 
} 
Fn(x) = P 
J[nij ~X . 
Since the Zn are independent and identically distributed and Var(Zn) = 1, it follows 
from Problem 20.4 that 
Fn(x) =? <I>(O, 1,x),

for all n such that [nt] 2 1. Then we have an --+ 1/ Vt and bn --+ 0 as n --+ oo. It 
follows from part (a) of Problem 20.2 that 
Fn(anX + bn) =?- <P ( 0, 1, ~) = <P(O, t, x). 
The result follows immediately by noting that 
This completes the proof. 
26.3. Let ffn = a(Z1, Z2, ... , Zn), n 2 1. 
(a) By the assumption that Z 1 , Z2, ... are independent, we have 
E[S~+ 1 Iffn] = S~ + E[Zn+1lffn] = S~ + E[Zn+l] = S~, 
n 2 0. 
Hence { S~ : n 2 0} is a martingale. 
(b) To show that TN, is a stopping time, we only need to show that 
{TN1 :S:n}Effn, n21. 
Note that 
n 
{TN1 :S: n} = u{sg oJ N1, ... ,Sfc-1 oJ N1,Sk = N1}. 
k=O 
But {Sg -1 N1, ... , S'k_ 1 oJ N1, S'k = NI} E ffn for all k :S: n. Hence we 
have { TN1 :S: n} E ffn. Thus TN1 is a martingale. 
Now we show that P{ TN1 < oo} = 1. Let no= N 2 - N 1. Then 
1 
P{TN, ::::; no}::::: P{Z1 = -1, z2 = -1, ... 'Zno = -1} = 2no'

Letting k -+ oo, we get P{ TN, = oo} = 0. 
Similarly, we can show that TN2 is also an a.s. finite stopping time. 
(c) By Problem 23.1, Tis a stopping time. Since 
we have 1 :::, P{T < oo} :::, P{TN, < oo} = 1 by part (b). Hence Tis a.s.

26.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented random walks. As one of the most studied topics 
in probability theory, random walks have been discussed in many books, for ex-
ample, Bailey (1964), Feller (1968), Loeve (1977), Kannan (1979), Shiryaev and 
Boas (1995), Grinstead and Snell (1997), Kallenberg (1997), Paul and Baschnagel 
(1999), Steele (2003), James (2003), Klebaner (2005), Stroock (2005), Lin (2006), 
Buchanan (2006), Bhattacharya and Waymire (2009), and Durrett (2010). There 
are several books devoted to random walks, including Spitzer (2001), Rudnick and 
Gaspari (2004), and Lawler and Limic (2010). 


CHAPTER27 
POISSON PROCESSES 
A Poisson process is a continuous-time stochastic process that counts the number of 
events in a given time interval. In mathematical finance, Poisson processes are used 
to build jump processes for modeling asset prices. In this chapter, we present the 
mathematical definition of the Poisson process and relevant results. 
27.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 27.1 (Poisson Process). Let A > 0. A stochastic process { Nt : t ~ 0} is 
said to be Poisson process with parameter A if it satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) P{No = 0} = P{w: No(w) = 0} = 1. 
(b) For any 0 :-:; s < t, the random variable Nt - N 8 is a Poisson random variable 
with parameter A(t- s): 
P{Nt- Ns = k} = e->.(t-s) (A(t ~ s))k, 
k = 0, 1, 2, .... 
(c) The Nt has independent increments, that is, for any 0 :-:; t 1 < t2 < ... < tn. 
the random variables Nt1 , Nt 2 -
Nt1 , ••• , Ntn - Ntn-l are independent.

Definition 27.2 (Poisson Process with Respect to Filtrations). Let {§1 : t :-=:: 0} be 
a filtration, and let,\ > 0. A stochastic process { N 1 : t :-=:: 0} is said to be Poisson 
process with respect to the filtration { JY1 : t :-=:: 0} and with parameter ,\ if it satisfies 
the following conditions: 
(a) P{N0 = 0} = P{w: N 0 (w) = 0} = 0. 
(b) For any 0 :::; s < t, the random variance Nt - Ns is a Poisson random variable

Definition 27.3 (Compensated Poisson Process). Let {Nt : t :-=:: 0} be a Poisson 
process with parameter,\ > 0. Then the corresponding compensated Poisson process 
Nt is defined by 
Definition 27.4 (Compound Poisson Process). A compound Poisson process { Q t

where { Nt : t :-=:: 0} is a Poisson process with some parameter ,\ > 0 defined on 
a probability space (r2, /Y, P), {Yn : n = 0,1, ... } is a sequence of independent 
and identically distributed random variables defined on the same probability space 
(r2, /F, P), and the sequence {Y;, : n = 0, 1, ... } is independent of the Poisson 
process {N1 : t :-=:: 0}. 
Definition 27.5 (Counting Process). Let {Tn : n :-=:: 1} be an increasing sequence of 
positive random variables. Let T0 = 0 a.s. Then the counting process { Nt : t :-=:: 0} 
associated to the sequence {Tn : n :-=:: 0} is defined as 
Nt = L Irn·~·J•

Theorem 27.1. Let {Tn : n :-=:: 0} be an increasing sequence qf positive random 
variables with P{T0 = 0} = 1 and P{Tn ---7 oo} = 1. Let {Nt : t :-=:: 0} be a 
counting process associated with the Tn. If { Nt : t :-=:: 0} has stationary independent 
increments, then { Nt : t :-=:: 0} is a Poisson process.

Use part (a) and the result of Problem 21.10 to prove part (c). 
27.10. To prove part (a), follow the definition of compound Poisson process (Defi-
nition 27.4) and use the result of Problem 14.18. To prove (b), note that Qt- Q 8 has 
the same distribution as Qt-s and use part (a). 
27.4 Solutions 
27.1. By definition, N(t) is fft-measurable. In addition, we have 
E(INti) = E(INt- >.ti) ~ E(Nt) + >.t = 2>.t < oo.

E(Nt- Ns + Nslffs)- t.A 
E(Nt - Ns) + Ns -.At 
N 8

AS. 
Hence the Nt is a martingale. This completes the proof. 
27.2. Since {T1 > t} = {Nt = 0}, we have 
P{T1 > t} = P{Nt = 0} = e->.t, 
t ~ 0. 
Since {T1 = s} E ffs and Nt+s - N 8 is independent of ff8 , we have 
P{Nt+s- Ns = OIT1 = s} 
P{Nt+s- Ns = 0} 
e->.t, 
which shows that T2 is independent of T1. By Definition 14.5, we have 
Hence by Problem 14.1 0, we have 
P{T2 > t} 
E[P{T2 > t!Tl}] 
E [e-At] 
->.t 
e 
. 
Similarly, we can show that Tn is independent of T1 , T2 , ... , Tn-l and 
This completes the proof. 
27 .3. To show that { Nt : t ~ 0} is a Poisson process, we only need to verify that 
{ Nt : t ~ 0} satisfies the four conditions in Definition 27 .I. First, let us show that 
P{No = 0} = 1. Note that 
{w: N0 (w) = 0} = {w: Tn(w) > 0, n = 1,2, ... } = {w: T 1(w) > 0}, 
which gives P{No = 0} = P{ T1 > 0} = 1. 
Now let us verify the second condition. Let 0 :-:::; s < t. Then we have 
n:2:1 
n:2:1 
n:2:1 

SOLUTIONS 
363 
Noting that the Tn is an non-decreasing sequence, we have 
00 
{Nt- N 8 = k} = U{Ti::; S < Ti+l• Ti+k::; t < Ti+k+l}, 
k 2: 0, 
i=O 
where T0 = 0. Since the sets {Ti ::; s < Ti+l• Ti+k ::; t < Ti+k+d are mutually 
disjoint, we have 
00 
P{Nt-Ns = k} = LP{Ti::; S < Ti+l,Ti+k::; t < Ti+k+l}, 
k 2:0. (27.1) 
i=O 
But 
Combining Equations (27.1) and (27.2) gives

Hence Nt- N 8 is Poisson distributed with parameter >.(t- s). 
To verify the third condition, we use the result of Problem 12.6. Let 0 ::; t 1 < 
t2 < · · · < tn. Then Nh, Nt2 -
Nt1 , ••• , Ntn - Ntn-l are Poisson distributed. Let 

364 
POISSON PROCESSES 
k1, k2, ... , kn ?:: 0 and j1 = k1, j2 = k1 + k2, ... , Jn = k1 + · · · + kn. Then we 
have 
P{Nt, = k1, Nt 2 ~ Nt, = k2, ... , Ntn ~ Ntn-l = kn} 
P{TJ, ::; t1 < Th+I, ... , TJn::; tn < TJn+I}. 
Using the same approach in Equation (27.2), we can get 
where to = 0. Since Nt 1 , Nt 2 ~ Nt,, ... , Ntn ~ Ntn-l are Poisson distributed, we 
have 
n IT P{Nt, ~ Nt,_, = ki} 
i=l 
Therefore, we have 
n 
P{Nt 1 = k1, Nt 2 ~Nt 1 = k2, • •., Ntn ~Ntn-l = kn} =IT P{Nti ~Nt,_ 1 = ki}. 
i=l 
It follows from Problem 12.6 that Nt,, Nt 2 ~ Nt,, .. . , Ntn ~ Ntn-l are independent. 
Finally, let us verify the fourth condition. By the definition of Nt, for almost every 
wE fl, the sample path t--+ Nt(w) is constant at each interval (Tn_ 1(w), Tn(w)), 
n = 1, 2, .... Hence 
{ wE fl: limNs(w) = Nt(w) and limNs(w) exists, 'Vt?:: o}

But 
{wE fl: Tn-I(w) < Tn(w) < Tn+I(w)}

{wE fl: 
lim Ns(w) = Nrn(w)(w) and 
lim Ns(w) exists} 
s-1-Tn(w) 
stTn(w) 
and 
P{w E fl: Tn-l(w) < Tn(w) < Tn+l(w)} = P{Tn > O,Tn+l > 0} = 1.

By Problem 11.1, we have 
P {wE !:2: limNs(w) = Nt(w) and limNs(w) exists, 'v't?: o} = 1. 
8{-t 
stt 
Therefore, almost all sample paths of {Nt : t ?: 0} are right-continuous with left-
hand limits. This completes the proof. 
27.4. To show that {NP) + NF) : t ?: 0} is a Poisson process, we only need to 
verify that it satisfies the four conditions given in Definition 27.1. Since {NP) : t?: 
0} and { Nt(2) : t ?: 0} are independent Poisson processes, we have 
P { N61l = 0, N62l = 0} 
P { N61l = 0} P { N62l = 0} 
1. 
Hence the process satisfies the first condition. 
Now let 0 :::; s < t and k ?: 0. Then we have

The third condition and the fourth condition are implied from the properties of

independent. This completes the proof.

By Problem 27.5, we have E [X?] = 2)..2(ti- ti_1) 2. Therefore, we have 
which implies that Equation (27.3) is true. This completes the proof.

27.7. Since Poisson processes are square integrable, Mt is integrable. Also the Mt 
is adapted to the filtration §t. We are left to verify that E(Mtl§s) = M 8 for all 
0 ~ s < t. 
Let 0 ~ s < t. Then we have 
E(Mtl§s) 
E[(Nt - Ns + Ns) 2 - >.tl§s]

Hence the Mt is a martingale. This completes the proof. 
27.8. 
Suppose that {Nt : t ~ 0} is adapted to a filtration {§t : t ~ 0}. Then 
{Xt : t ~ 0} is also adapted to this filtration. Now we show that 
E(IXtl) < oo,

It remains to check that

To do that, let 0 ~ s < t be fixed. By the definition of Poisson processes (Definition

it follows from Problems 14.12 and 14.16 that

(b) Lett ~ 0 and h ~ 0 be fixed. By the proof of the first item, we have

Hence Qt+h- Qt has the same distribution as Qh.

27.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced Poisson processes. The definition of Poisson process 
is similar to that of Brownian motion. This definition was adopted from Kuo (2006). 
In some books, the Poisson process is defined as a counting process [see Cont and 
Tankov (2003, Section 2.5) and Protter (2003, Section 1.3)]. Theorem 27.1 says 
that if a counting process has stationary independent increments, then it is a Poisson 
process. For a proof of this theorem, readers are referred to Cont and Tankov (2003, 
Lemma 2.1). For more information about Poisson process, readers are referred to 
Ross (1995) and Chung and Aitsahlia (2007). 


CHAPTER 28 
BROWNIAN MOTION 
Brownian motion is a fundamentally important stochastic process in that it is a cen-
tral notion throughout the theoretical development of stochastic processes. In this 
chapter, we present the definition and some properties of Brownian motion. 
28.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 28.1 (Standard Brownian Motion). Let (0, $, P) be a probability space. 
A stochastic process { Bt : t 2:: 0} on ( 0, $, P) is called a standard Brownian 
motion if it satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) P{Bo = 0} = P{w: Bo(w) = 0} = 1. 
(b) For any 0 s; s < t, the increment Bt - Bs is a random variable normally 
distributed with mean 0 and variance t - s, that is, for any a < b, we have

P{w: B(t,w) = Bt(w) is continuous}= 1. 
Definition 28.2 (Brownian Motion with Respect to Filtrations). Let { ~t : t 2': 0} be 
a filtration. A stochastic process { Bt : t 2': 0} is said to be a Brownian motion with 
respect to the filtration { ~t : t 2': 0} if it satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) P{Bo = 0} = P{w: Bo(w) = 0} = 1. 
(b) For any 0 ::::; s < t, the increment Bt - B 8 is a random variable normally 
distributed with mean 0 and variance t - s, that is, for any a < b, we have

Definition 28.3 (m-Dimensional Brownian Motion). Let m be a positive integer 
and J.L a probability measure on (R m, B(R m)). Let Bt be a continuous process with 
values in Rm, defined on a probability space (n, ~. P), and adapted to a filtration 
{ ~t : t 2': 0}. This process is called an m-dimensional Brownian motion with initial 
distribution J.L if 
(a) P{Bo E A}= J.L(A) for all A E B(Rm). 
(b) For 0 ::::; s < t, the increment Bt - Bs is independent of ~s and is normally 
distributed with mean zero and covariance matrix (t- s)Im, where Im is the 
m x m identity matrix.

28.1. Lets~ t. Then Bt- Bs is independent of g;s· Hence we have 
Note that E(Bf) = t < oo. By Problem 8.5, we have E(IBtl) < oo. Hence the Bt

(a) By Definition 28.1, Bt - B 0 is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 
t. But B 0 is equal to 0 a.s. Hence Bt is normally distributed with mean 0 and 
variance t. 
(b) Without loss of generality, we assume that 0 ~ s < t. Then by definition, 
B s - Bo and Bt - B s are independent. Hence we have 
This completes the proof. 
28.3. To show that { Bt}t>o is a Brownian motion, we only need to verify that it 
satisfies the four conditions in Definition 28.1. Since Bo = Bt0 -
Bt0 = 0, the Bt 
satisfies the first condition. Let 0 ~ s < t. Then 
which implies that Bt - Bs is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t + 
t 0 - (s + t0 ) = t- s. Hence the Bt satisfies the second condition. 
Now let 0 ~ t1 < t2 < ... < tn. Then we have 0 ~ h +to < t2 +to < 
·: · < t"':.. +to. The increments Bh = Bh+to• Bt2
- Bh = Bt.:;+to- Bt 1+to• ... , 
Btn - Btn-l = Btn+to - Btn- 1+to are independent. Hence Bt satisfies the third 
condition. Since almost all sample paths of the Bt are continuous, so are the sample 
paths of the (B)t = Bt+to- Bto· Hence the Bt satisfies the fourth condition. 
28.4. 
It is obvious that the Bt satisfies the first, third, and fourth conditions in

the Bt satisfies the second condition. Therefore the Bt is a Brownian motion. 
28.5. 
To show that {Wt}t?:O is a Brownian motion, we only need to verify that 
Wt satisfies the four conditions in Definition 28.1. By the definition of W 0 , the first 
condition is satisfied. Let 0 < s < t. Then 
Wt- Ws = tB1- sB1 = (t- s)B1- s (B1- B1).

28.2, for i > 1, we have

is normally distributed. In addition, the mean of aB8 + bBt is 0 and the variance is 
(a+ b) 2s + b2(t- s) = (a2 + 2ab)s + b2t. This completes the proof. 
28.8. 
(a) By Problem 28.7, the random variables tBt- ~Bs and aBu + bBv are normal 
random variables. By Problem 28.7, t Bt- ~ B 8 and aBu +bBv are independent 
if and only if 
E [ (~Bt- ~Bs) (aBu + bBv)] = E [~Bt- ~Bs] E[aBu + bBv]· 
(28.1)

28.13. By Theorem 28.2, the two processes

and 
( { Bt : 0 :::; t :::; T}, { Br - ( Bt+r - Br) : t :::0: 0}) 
have the same distribution. But note that the first concatenation is just { Bt : t :::0: 0} 
and the second one is just { Bt : t :::0: 0}. Hence { Bt : t :::0: 0} is a standard Brownian 
motion. This completes the proof.

distribution, which gives 
Since BT, = a, the above equation becomes 
By the assumption that f3 ~ a, we have 2a - f3 ~ a. Hence Bt ~ 2a - f3 implies 
that t ~ T a. Therefore, we get 
P{Ta ~ t,Bt ~ /3} = P{2a- (3 ~ Bt}. 
This completes the proof. 
28.15. 
(a) Let { Bt : t ~ 0} be the Brownian motion reflected at T (see Problem 28.13). 
Then we have 
Note that 
{ Mt > a} = { Bt > a} U { Mt > a, Bt ~ a}. 
We have 
{ Mt > a} = { Bt > a} U { Bt ~ a},

28.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented Brownian motion and related problems. A Brownian 
motion is defined as a stochastic process satisfying certain properties. In fact, such 
stochastic processes exist and can be constructed mathematically in several ways. 
For example, Kuo (2006, Chapter 3) introduced three approaches of constructing 
Brownian motion: Wiener's method, Kolmogorov's method, and Levy's interpo-
lation method. The history of Brownian motion is discussed in Bhattacharya and 
Waymire (2007, Chapter XIII). 
Theorem 28.1 is a very interesting result of Brownian motions. Readers can find 
a proof of this theorem in Bhattacharya and Waymire (2007, p144). For a proof of 
Theorem 28.2, readers are referred to Hunt (1956). 
The definition of m-dimensional Brownian motion (see Definition 28.3) was adopted 
from Karatzas and Shreve (1991, Section 2.5). This definition implies that the incre-
ments of the components are independent (see Problem 28.17). For more informa-
tion about Brownian motion, readers are referred to Borodin and Salminen (2002), 
Shreve (2004), Wiersema (2008), and Morters and Peres (2010). 


CHAPTER 29 
MARKOV PROCESSES 
A Markov process is a stochastic process that has the Markov property. In other 
words, a stochastic process is called a Markov process if at every time t, the condi-
tional probability law of the process given the past depends only on the present state. 
Intuitively, a Markov process is a process that does not have memory. In this chapter, 
we present the mathematical definition of Markov processes and relevant results.

MARKOVPROCESSES 
Definition 29.2 (Markov Process). Let I be an index set. Let (D, §, P) be a 
probability space and { §t : t E I} be a filtration over the probability space. 
Let { Xt : t E I} be a stochastic process adapted to the filtration. The process 
{ Xt : t E I} is called a Markov process relative to the filtration if for every t E I, 
the past §t and the future !:f!x, = a(Xu : u 2:: t, u E I) are conditionally indepen-
dent given the present state Xt. 
Definition 29.3 (Transition Kernel). Let (E, !&") and (F, §) be two measurable 
spaces. A transition kernel from (E, !&") to (F, §) is a mapping K : (E, §) --+ 
[0, oo] with the following properties: 
(a) For every set B E §,the mapping x--+ K(x, B) is !&"-measurable. 
(b) For every x E E, the mapping B--+ K(x, B) is a measure on (F, §). 
A transition kernel from ( E, !&") to ( E, !&") is called a transition kernel on ( E, !&"). 
Definition 29.4 (Markov Kernel). Let (E, !&") be a measurable space. A Markov 
kernel on (E, !&") is a transition kernel K on (E, !&") such that for every x E E, we 
have 
K(x,E) = 1. 
Definition 29.5 (Identity Kernel). Let (E, !&") be a measurable space. An identity 
kernel on (E, !&")is a transition kernel I on (E, !&") such that for every x E E, 
I(x, A)= IA(x), 
A E 0", 
where I A ( ·) is the indicator function. 
Definition 29.6 (Product of Kernels). Let K be a transition kernel from (E, !&")into 
( F, §), and let L be a transition kernel from ( F, §) into ( G, !:f). Then their product 
is a transition kernel K L from ( E, !&") into ( G, !:f) defined as 
KL(x,B) = l K(x,dy)L(y,B), 
x E E, BE 1:§. 
Definition 29.7 (Markovian Transition Function). Let ( E, !&") be a measurable space. 
Let { Pt,u : 0 ::::; t ::::; u} be a family of Markov kernels on (E, !&") indexed by pairs of 
times t and u. It is called a Markovian transition function on ( E, !&") if it satisfies the 
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation 
(29.1) 
Definition 29.8 (Markov Process with a Transition Function). Let { Xt : t E I} be 
a Markov process with some state space (E,i&"). Let {Pt,u: t,u E I,t::::; u} be 
a transition function on (E, !&"). The Markov process is said to admit the transition 
function if for every positive g -measurable function, we have 

PROBLEMS

where Pt,u! is the product of Pt,u and f (see Theorem 29.1). 
Definition 29.9 (Time-Homogeneous Markov Process). Let { Xt : t E I} be a 
Markov process that admits { Pt,u : 0 :::; t :::; u} as a transition function. The Markov 
process is said to be time-homogeneous if for every time t and time u > t, the 
dependence of Pt,u on the pair (t, u) is through u- t only, that is, 
Pt,u =Pu-t 
for some Markov kernel Pu-t· 
Definition 29.10 (Markov Chain). A stochastic process { Xt : t E I} is said to be a 
Markov chain if the process is a time-homogeneous Markov process and I = N. 
Theorem 29.1 (Measure, Kernel, and Function). Let K be a transition kernel from 
( E, 0") into ( F, $). Let f be a positive §-measurable function and J.L a measure on 
(E,6"). Then 
(a) The function K f defined as 
Kf(x) = l K(x,dy)f(y), 
x E E,

MARKOVPROCESSES 
29.3. Part (a) can be proved by using the definition of kernel and function compo-
sition (see Theorem 29.1). To prove part (b), use the third result of Theorem 29.1 to 
show that (KL)f(x) = K(Lf)(x) for x E E. 
29.4. Use the definition of Markov processes with a transition function (Definition 
29.8) to establish 
P(Xu E AIXt) = Pt,u(Xt, A). 
Then note that how P(Xu E AIXt = x) is interpreted (see Section 14.5). 
29.5. 
Part (a) follows from the definition of Markov processes directly. To prove 
part (b), one can show that 
To prove part (c), one can use the following equation 
29.6. Use the definition of Markov processes with a transition function (Definitionn 
29.8), the result of part (b) of Problem 29.2, and the tower property of conditional 
expectations (see Problem 14.10). 
29.7. Use the results of Problems 29.2 and 14.13 to prove part (a). Use Definition 
29.8, part (a) of this problem, and the result of Problem 14.13 to prove part (b). 
29.4 Solutions 
29.1. 
We first show that part (a) is equivalent to part (b). Note that part (a) is 
equivalent to 
(29.6) 
where vl and v2 are arbitrary positive random variables in m§'l and m§'2. respec-
tively. By Problem 14.15, Equation (29.6) is equivalent to 
(29.7) 
By the definition of conditional expectation (Definition 14.1), Equation (29.7) is 
equivalent to 
By the monotone convergence theorem (Theorem 6.2), we can show that Equation 
(29.8) is equivalent to 

SOLUTIONS 
395 
But by Problem 14.2, Equation (29.9) is equivalent to 
which is part (b). 
Now we show that part (b) is equivalent to part (c). It is clear that part (b) implies 
part (c). Conversely, assume that part (c) holds. Then by the definition of conditional 
expectation, we have 
(29.10) 
which implies that 
i E[V2I£' V $"1]dP = i V2dP, 
\fA E £'. 
(29.11) 
Note that E[V2I£' V $"1] Em£'. We have 
Hence part (b) is true. This completes the proof. 
29.2. Let V be a positive random variable that is measurable with respect to ~~. 
Then by Problem 29.1, part (a) is equivalent to 
E[VI§t v a(Xt)] = E[VIa(Xt)]. 
Since { Xt : t E J} is adapted to { §t : t E J}, we have a(Xt) ~ §t. Hence part (a) 
is equivalent to 
E[VI§t] = E[VIa(Xt)] = E[VIXt]. 
Therefore, part (a) is equivalent to part (c). It follows from Problem 21.12 that part 
(d) is equivalent to part (e). 
It is obvious that part (c) implies part (b). Now we show that part (b) ===> part 
(d). To do that, we use the induction method. Fork= 1, we have 
E[!l(XuJI§t] 
E[fi(XuJI§t]- E[f!(Xul)l§t] 
E[fi(Xu1 )1Xt]- E[f1(Xu1)1Xt] 
E[f1(XuJIXt] E ma(Xt)· 
Hence part (d) holds. Suppose that part (d) holds fork. Then for n = k + 1, 
E(E[Vk+ll§uk]l§t) 
E(VkE[fk+l (Xuk+l) l§uk]l§t) 
E(Vkg(Xuk) l§t) 
E 
ma(Xt)· 

396 
MARKOV PROCESSES 
Here E[fk+I (Xuk+ 1 )l§uk] E u(Xuk). By Theorem 11.2, E[fk+l (Xuk+ 1)l§uJ is 
a function of X uk. Hence part (d) holds for k + 1. 
It follows from Problem 29.1 that part (e) implies part (c). This completes the 
proof. 
29.3. 
(a) By Theorem 29.1, we have 
KIB(x) = l K(x,dy)IB(Y) = l K(x,dy). 
(29.12) 
Note that by the definition of transition kernels (Definition 29.3), K(x, ·)is a 
measure for every x. Hence from Equation (29.12), we have 
KIB(x) = K(x, B). 
(b) Let x E E be fixed. Let ILx(B) = K(x, B) forB E §. Then by Theorem 
29.1, we have 
P,xL(C) = liLx(dy)L(y, C) = l K(x, dy)L(y, C), 
C E r.1. 
(29.13) 
Again by Theorem 29.1 and Equation (29.13), we have 
(KL)f(x) 
[ KL(x, dz)f(z) 
[ J(z) l K(x, dy)L(y, dz) 
[ f(z)p,xL(dz) 
(p,xL)J 
ILx(LJ) 
lP,x(dy) [ L(y, dz)f(z) 
K(LJ)(x). 
Since xis arbitrary, it follows that (K L )! = K(LJ). 
This completes the proof. 
29.4. Let x E E and A E g be fixed. Letting f(·) = IA(·) in Definition 29.8 gives 
E[IA(Xu)IXt] = (Pt,uiA)(Xt) = l Pt,u(Xt, dy)IA(y). 
(29.14) 
Note that P(Xu E AIXt) = E[IA(Xu)IXt] and Pt,u(Xt, ·)is a measure. From 
Equation (29.14), we have 
(29.15) 

SOLUTIONS 
397 
Hence Pt,u(Xt, A) is the conditional probability of {Xu E A} given a(Xt). There-
fore, we have 
Pt,u(x, A)= P(Xu E AIXt = x). 
This completes the proof. 
29.5. 
(a) Let{~ : t ~ 0} be the filtration to which the process {Xt : t ~ 0} is adapted. 
By Problem 29.2, to prove that {yt : t ~ 0} is a Markov process, we only need 
to show that 
E[f(Yu)l~] = E[f(Yu)IYt], 
0:::; t:::; u, 
(29.16) 
where f is a positive $-measurable function. But since f(t, ·)is a nonnegative 
g -measurable function, we have 
E[f(Yu)l~] = E[f(u,Xu)l~] = E[f(u,Xu)IXt]· 
(29.17) 
Now by the definition of conditional expectation (Definition 14.1), for any C E 
a(Xt). we have 
{ 
E[f(Yu)IYt]dP 
J{u}xC 
{ 
f(Yu)dP 
J{u}xC 
lf(u,Xu)dP 
l E[f(u,Xu)IXt]dP. 
(29.18) 
Since Equation (29.18) holds for any C E a(Xt). we have E[f(Yu)IYt] 
E[f(Yu)IXt] a.s. Hence Equation (29.16) holds. 
(b) To show that {yt : t ~ 0} is time-homogeneous, we only need to show that 
But 
and 
E[f(Ys2+t)IYs 2 = (s, x)] = E[f(Ys+t)IXs = x], 
it follows that Equation (29.19) holds. 
(c) Since {yt : t ~ 0} is time-homogeneous, for y = (s, x), we have 
Qtf(y) 
E[f(Yr+t)IYr = y] 
E[f(Ys+t)IXs = x] 
E[f(s + t, Xs+t)IXs = x] 
Ps,s+tf(s + t, x) 
h 
Ps,s+t(x,dz)f(s+t,z). 
(29.19)

MARKOVPROCESSES 
This finishes the proof. 
29.6. Let f be a positive Borel function. Let 0 :::; s < t :::; u. Then by Problems 
29.2 and 14.10, and Definition 29.8, we have 
But by Theorem 29.1, we have 
E[f(Xu)[Xs] 
E[J(Xu)[§s] 
E(E[f(Xu)[§t][§s) 
E(Pt,uf(Xt)[§s) 
Ps,t(Pt,uf)(Xs) 
Hence Ps,u = Ps,tPt,u· This finishes the proof. 
29.7. Let 0 :::; t < u be fixed. 
(a) By Problem 29.2, we only need to prove that 
(29.20) 
To do this, let cp(x) = E[f(Bu- Bt + x)]. Since Bu- Bt is independent of 
§t and Bt is $t-measurable, it follows from Problem 14.13 that 
(29.21) 
Similarly, since Bu- Bt is independent of a(Bt) and Bt is a(Bt)-measurable, 
it follows from Problem 14.13 that 
(29.22) 
Hence Equation (29.20) follows by combining Equations (29.21) and (29.22). 
(b) By Theorem 29.1, we have 
By Definition 29.8 and the first item, we have 
where 
E[iA(Bu)[Xt] 
E[IA(Bu- Bt + Bt)[Xt] 
cp(Bt), 
cp(x) = E[IA(Bu- Bt + x))] = P{Bu- Bt + x E A}.

CHAPTER 30 
LEVY PROCESSES 
Levy processes are stochastic processes that have independent and stationary incre-
ments. The basic theory of Levy processes was established in the 1930s. Recently, 
Levy processes have been used as asset price models in mathematical finance. In this 
chapter, we present Levy processes and their main properties. 
30.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 30.1 (Levy Process). Let (0, §, P) be a probability space and { §t 
t ~ 0} a filtration on the probability space. A stochastic process X= {Xt : t ~ 0} 
is called a Levy process in R d with respect to { §t : t ~ 0} if it is adapted to the 
filtration and 
(a) For almost every w, the path t--+ Xt(w) is right-continuous with left limit and 
Xa(w) = 0. 
(b) For every t and h in [0, oo ), the increment Xt+h- Xt is independent of §t and 
has the same distribution as X h.

LEVY PROCESSES 
A process {yt : t 2: 0} is considered a Levy process, without mentioning a filtration, 
if it is a Levy process with respect to the filtration generated by itself. 
Definition 30.2 (Jump). Let { Xt : t 2: 0} be a Levy process. For every w E n and 
every t E [0, oo), let 
Xt_(w) = limXx(w), 
Xt+(w) = limX8 (w) = Xt(w). 
xtt 
s{.t 
Here Xt- (w) = 0 fort = 0. If Xt_(w) =1- Xt(w), we say that the path Xt(w) jumps 
from its left limit Xt_(w) to its right-hand value Xt(w). The size of the jump is 
given by 
~Xt(w) = Xt(w)- Xt_(w). 
The jump magnitude is I~Xt(w)l. The discontinuity set for the path Xt(w) is de-
noted by 
Dw = {t > 0: ~Xt(w) =/:- 0}. 
Definition 30.3 (Pure-Jump Process). A Levy process is called a pure-jump process 
if for every t 2: 0, Xt is equal to the sum of the sizes of its jumps during [0, t]. That 
is, for almost every w, we have 
Xt(w) = L 
~X8 (w), t E [0, oo), 
sEDwn[O,t) 
where the sum on the right-hand side converges absolutely: 
Vt(w) = 
L 
I~Xs(w)l < oo. 
sEDwn[O,t) 
Here vt (w) denotes the total variation of the path Xt(w) over [0, t]. 
Definition 30.4 (Jump-Diffusion Process). A stochastic process {Xt 
t > 0} is 
called a jump-diffusion process if it has the following form 
N, 
Xt = at+ aBt + L Zn, 
n=l 
where a E R, a 2: 0, { Bt : t 2: 0} is a standard Brownian motion, { Nt : t 2: 0} 
is a Poisson process, and { Zn : n = 1, 2, ... } is a sequence of independent and 
identically distributed random variables that is independent of { Nt : t 2: 0}. The 
Poisson process {Nt: t 2: 0}, the sequence {Zn: n = 1, 2, ... }, and the Brownian 
motion { Bt : t 2: 0} are assumed to be independent. 
Definition 30.5 (Infinitely Divisibility). A probability distribution F on (R, B) is 
said to be infinitely divisible if for any integer n 2: 2, there exists n independent 
and identically random variables Y1, Y2, ... , Yn such that Y1 + Y2 + · · · + Yn has 
distribution F. 

BASIC CONCEPTS AND FACTS 
403 
A random variable X is said to be infinitely divisible if and only if for each n ~ 1, 
X has the same distribution as the sum of n independent and identically distributed 
random variables. 
Definition 30.6 (Random Measure). Let (!1, ~. P) be a probability space and (E, 
6") a measurable space. A random measure on ( E, 6") is a transition kernel from 
(n, ~)into (E, 6"); that is, a mapping M : n X 6"-+ [0, oo] if 
(a) For every A E 6", M(A) : w-+ M(w, A) is a random variable. 
(b) For every wEn, Mw :A-+ M(w, A) is a measure on (E, 6"). 
Definition 30.7 (Levy Measure). A Levy measure v is a Borel measure defined on 
R\{0} = {x E R: x =/= 0} such that 
{ 
(y2 A 1)v(dy) < oo. 
jR\{0} 
A Levy measure v can be extended to the whole real line R by assigning 
v({O})=O. 
Definition 30.8 (Poisson Random Measure). Let (E, 6") be a measurable space. Let 
v be a measure on (E, 6"). A random measure N on (E, 6") is called a Poisson 
random measure with mean v if it satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) For every A E 6", the random variable N(A) has a Poisson distribution with 
mean v(A). 
(b) For every integer n ~ 2, if A 1 , A2 , ... , An E 6" are disjoint, then the random 
variables N(A1), N(A2), ... , N(An) are independent. 
Theorem 30.1 (Uvy-Khintchine Formula). A probability distribution F of a real-
valued random variable is infinitely divisible if and only if there exists a triplet 
(a, u, v ), where a E R, u ~ 0, and v is a Levy measure, such that for all() E R, 
L 
eiOxJ.tp(dx) 
L 
eiOxdF(x) 
exp (ia()- ~u2()-L 
(1- eiex + iOxi(- 1,l)(x)) v(dx)) , 
where J.tF is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure corresponding to F and J(-1,1)(·) is an 
indicator function. 
Theorem 30.2 (Levy Processes and Infinitely Divisible Distributions). If {Xt : t ~ 
0} is a Levy process, then for every t, Xt has an infinitely divisible distribution. 

404 
LEVY PROCESSES 
Conversely, ifF is an infinitely divisible distribution, then there exists a Levy process 
{ Xt : t 2: 0} such that the distribution of X 1 is F. 
Theorem 30.3 (Characteristic Function of a Levy Process). Let {Xt : t ;:::: 0} be a 
Rd-valued Levy process. Then for each t 2: 0, the characteristic function of Xt is 
given by 
¢x,(u)=etry(u), 
't:/uERd, 
where ry( u) is a continuous function, which is said to be the characteristic exponent 
of the process. 
Theorem 30.4 (Existence of Poisson Random Measure). For any given u-finite mea-
sure space (S, ~ • .X), there exists a Poisson random measure M on some probability 
space (O.,§,P) such that .X(A) = E(M(A))forall A E ~-
Theorem 30.5 (Levy-Ito Decomposition). Let {Xt : t ;:::: 0} beaR-valued Levy 
process. Then 
Xt = bt + uBt + 1 xNt(dx) + 1 xNt(dx),

Let a = a = 0 and v = .\51 , where 51 is the Dirac measure supported on { 1}: 
5l(A) = { 1,

Then we have 
ifl E A; 
if1 ~A, 
\fA E B(R). 
It follows from Theorem 30. I that F is infinitely divisible. This completes the proof. 
30.3. Let G be the distribution of X. Then we have

Comparing the above equation with the Levy-Khintchine formula gives 
a= A j_

1 XJLp(dx), 
a= 0, 
v = AJLF· 
Hence it follows from Theorem 30.1 that G is infinitely divisible. This completes the 
proof. 
30.4. By Problem 19.1, we have 
L 
eilixJLp(dx) = E [eiliX] = exp (i')'O- ~s2 82). 
Comparing the above equation with the Levy-Khintchine formula gives 
a=')', a=s, 
v=O. 
By Theorem 30.1, F is infinitely divisible. This finishes the proof. 
30.5. 
By Definition 27.1, {Nt : t ~ 0} is right-continuous with left limit and 
P { N 0 = 0} = 1. Hence { yt : t ~ 0} is right -continuous with left limit and 
P{Yo = 0} = P{No = 0} = 1. 
Let h ~ 0. Then 
Nt+h 
Yt+h- yt = L 
Zn· 
n=Nt+l 
30.6. Let Zt = Xt + yt for all t ~ 0. To show that { Zt : t ~ 0} is a Levy process, 
we only need to verify that it satisfies the two conditions in Definition 30.1. 
Since {Xt : t ~ 0} and {yt : t ~ 0} are Levy processes, we have P( {Xo = 
0} n {Yo= 0}) = 1 (see Problem 11.1). Hence Z0 = X 0 +Yo= 0 a.s. In addition, 
by Problem 1.1 0, for every s ~ 0, we have 
limZt = limXt +lim yt = X 8 + Y8 , 
t.j.s 
t.j.8 
t.j.8 
and for every s > 0, we have 
limZt = limXt +lim yt = X8- + Y8 _. 
~8 
~8 
~8 
Hence { Zt : t ~ 0} satisfies the first condition. 
Let §t = a(Z8 
: 0 ~ s ~ t) and Y4 = a(X8 , Y8 
: s ~ t) for all t ~ 0. Then we 
have 
§t <;;; .Ytt, 
t ~ 0. 
Since {Xt : t ~ 0} and {yt : t ~ 0} are independent Levy processes, Zt- Z 8 = 
(Xt- X 8 ) + (yt - Y8 ) is independent of .Yes and thus Zt- Z 8 is independent of 
§8. In addition, Zt - Z 8 has the same distribution as Xt-8 + yt_8 = Zt- 8 • Hence 
{ Zt : t ~ 0} satisfies the first condition.

LEVY PROCESSES 
This completes the proof. 
30.7. 
Let {§t : t ~ 0} be the filtration generated by {Xt : t ~ 0}. Then the 
process { exp ( iBXt - try( B)) : t ~ 0} is adapted to the filtration. In addition, we 
have 
E[l exp (iBXt- try( B)) I]= 1 < oo. 
For 0 :::; s < t, we have 
E[exp (iBXt- try( B)) l§s] 
E[exp (iB(Xt- Xs)) exp(iBXs- try(B))I§s] 
E[exp (iB(Xt- Xs))] exp(iBXs- try( B))) 
exp (iBX8
-
try( B)) ei(t-s)'1(1!) 
exp (iBXs- sry(B)). 
This completes the proof. 
30.8. Let 0 :::; s < t be fixed. Let f be a positive Borel function. Let Y = Xt- X 8 • 
Since { Xt : t ~ 0} is a Levy process, Y is independent of §s. Then by Problem 
14.13, we have 
where g(x) = E[f(Y + x)]. Since Y is also independent of a(Xs), by Problem 
14.13 we have 
Hence 
It follows from Problem 29.2 that {Xt : t ~ 0} is a Markov process. This completes 
the proof. 
30.9. 
(a) By Definition 28.1, the Brownian motion {aBt : t ~ 0} is a Levy process. 
By Problem 30.6, we only need to show that the compound Poisson process 
{'2:=~~ 1 Zn : t ~ 0} is a Levy process. To do that, let 
N, 
yt = L Zn, 
t ~ 0. 
n=l 
Then P{Yo = 0} = P{No = 0} = 1. By Problem 27.9, Yi+h - yt is 
independent of a(Ys : 0 :::; s :::; t) and Yi+h - yt has the same distribution as 
Yh. Hence {yt : t ~ 0} is a Levy process. 

SOLUTIONS

(b) Suppose that { Nt : t ;::: 0} and { Z 1 , Z2 , ... } are defined on a probability space 
(O,ff,P). 
Let A E B(R) and t ;::: 0 be fixed. We show that Mt(A) is a random variable. 
To do that, letHE B(R). Then 
{Mt(A) E H} = U _ [u ({Nt = i} n {t IA(Zn) = k})] E .'7, 
kEHnN 
22':0 
n=O 
where N = {0, 1, 2, ... }. Since His arbitrary, Mt(A) is »>-measurable. Hence 
Mt (A) is a random variable. 
Now let w E 0 and t ;::: 0 be fixed. We show that Mt,w is a measure on 
(R, B(R) ). In fact, by the definition of Mt. we have Mt,w(0) = 0 and Mt,w(A) 
;::: 0 for all A E B(R). Let G 1 , G2 , ... E B(R) be a sequence of mutually 
disjoint sets. Then 
N, L Iu~=' Gn (Zi) 
i=l 
i=l n=l 
00 
which shows that Mt,w is countably additive. Therefore, Mt,w is a measure. 
(c) By part (b), Mt is a random measure. To show that Mt is a Poisson random 
measure with mean v, we first show that for every A E B(R), Mt(A) has 
a Poisson distribution with mean v(A). Let k ;=:: 0 be an integer. Then by 
Problem 14.18, we have 
P{Mt(A) = k} = P {~ IA(Zn) = k}

P{Nt = i}P {~ IA(Zn) = k}

which shows that Mt(A) has a Poisson distribution with mean >.tP{Z1 E A}. 
Hence we have 

412 
LEVY PROCESSES 
Now let n 2': 2, and let A1 , ... , An E B(R) be disjoint. To show that Mt(AI), 
Mt(A2 ), .. . , Mt(An) are independent, we use Kac's theorem (Theorem 17.2) 
to show that 
In fact, by Problems 14.18 and 12.7 we have 
Since Z1 , Z2 , ... have the same distribution and A1 , A2 , ... , An are disjoint, 
the above equation gives 
E [exp (i ~ 
OkMt(Ak))] 
exp (AtE [exp (i ~ 
OkiAk (Zl)) ]-At) 
exp (At L 
exp (i~OkiAk(x)) fLF(dx)- At) 
exp (At [~(l+ei 1h)tLF(Ak)]). 
(30.2) 

SOLUTIONS

Since Z 1 , Z2 , •.. are independent, by Problem 14.18 and Theorem 17.2 we have

k=l 
n II exp (.Xt[1 + ei!Jk]J.LF(Ak)). 
(30.3) 
k=l 
Hence Equation (30.1) follows from Equations (30.2) and (30.3). Thus, Mt is a 
Poisson random measure.

Since f.£F is a finite measure, vis also a finite measure. 
(e) By the assumption that {Nt : t ~ 0}, {Zn : n = 1, 2, ... }, and {Bt : t ~ 0} 
are independent, we have 
By Problems 30.3 and 30.4, we have

Combining the above three equations gives 
This completes the proof. 
30.10. 
(a) Let n0 be the set such that for any w E n0 , the path {N8 (w) : 0 :::; s :::; t} 
is right-continuous with left limit and the path {as + a B s ( w) : 0 :::; s :::; t} 
is continuous. Then we have P(no) = 1. Let w E no. Since Nt(w) < oo, 
the path { N 8 ( w) : 0 :::; s :::; t} has at most a finite number of jumps. Let 
s 1 , s2 , ... , sm be the jump points of the path. Then we have 
n=1 
(b) For every n 2:: 1, let An,o = {0}, 
An,i = {X E R: (i- 1)Tn <X:::; iTn}'

where F is the distribution function of Z1 and /LF is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes mea-

30.5 Bibliographic Notes 
The Levy process introduced in this chapter forms a rich class of stochastic pro-
cesses. For example, the Poisson process and Brownian motion are special cases 
of the Levy process. Our definition of the Levy process is adopted from <;inlar 
(2011). For an alternative definition, readers are referred to Protter (2003) and Ca-
passo and Bak:stein (2005). For stochastic calculus with Levy processes, readers are 
referred to Applebaum (2009) and Pascucci (2011). For more information about 
Levy processes, readers are referred to Bertoin (1996), Sato (1999), Applebaum 
(2004), Kyprianou (2006), Pascucci (2011), and Stroock (2011). 
Levy processes with jumps have been used to model stock prices for the pur-
pose of risk management and derivative pricing. For more information about finan-
cial modeling with Levy processes, readers are referred to Cont and Tankov (2003), 
Schoutens (2003), and Schoutens and Cariboni (2009). 
The Levy-Khintchine formula (see Theorem 30.1) describes the structure of the 
characteristic exponent of an infinitely divisible distribution. A proof of this theorem 
can be found in Lukacs (1970) and Sato (1999). Theorem 30.2 states the relationship 
between Levy processes and infinitely divisible distributions. For a proof of the con-
verse part, readers are referred to Sato (1999, Corollary 11.6). A proof of Theorem 
30.3 can be found in Applebaum (2009, Theorem 1.3.3). 
Theorem 30.4 says that Poisson random measures exist. A proof of this theorem 
can be found in Sato (1999, Proposition 19.4). For more information about Poisson 
random measures, readers are referred to <;inlar (2011, Chapter VI). 
The Levy-Ito decomposition (see Theorem 30.5) is an important result, which 
describes the path properties of Levy processes. For a proof of this theorem, readers 
are referred to Applebaum (2009, Section 2.4).

CHAPTER 31 
THE WIENER INTEGRAL 
The Wiener integral is a simple stochastic integral where the integrand is a determin-
istic function. In this chapter, we present a definition and some results of the Wiener 
integral. 
31.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 31.1 (Function Space L 2 [a, b]). The function space 
denotes the space of all real-valued square Lebesgue integrable functions on [a, b], 
where J-L is the Lebesgue measure. 
Definition 31.2 (Function Space £ 2(0, ~. P)). The function space 
denotes the space of all square integrable real-valued random variables with inner 
product (X, Y) = E(XY).

THE WIENER INTEGRAL 
Definition 31.3 (Wiener Integral of Step Functions). Let f be a step function in 
L2 [a, b] given by 
n 
f(x) = 2..: aJ[t,_,,t,J(x), 
x E [a, b], 
i=l 
where a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b. The Wiener integral off is defined as 
n 
I (f) = 2..: ai(Bt, - Bt,_, ), 
i=l 
where { Bt}t>o is the standard Brownian motion. 
(31.1) 
Definition 31.4 (Wiener Integral of General Functions). Let f E L2[a, b], and let 
{fn}n>l be a sequence of step functions such that 
f 
L 2 [a,b] J 
n -----=----:.t 
. 
Then the sequence {I(fn)}n>l is Cauchy in L 2(rl,§,P) and thus converges in 
L 2 (rl, §, P). The Wiener int~gral off is defined as 
I (f) = lim I (in) 
in L 2 (rl, §, P). 
n---+oo 
(31.2) 
The Wiener integral I(f) is also denoted by I: f(t)dBt or I: f(t)dBt(w). 
Definition 31.5 (Riemann-Stieltjes Integral). Let f and g be bounded functions on a 
finite closed interval [a, b]. The function f is said to be Riemann-Stieltjes integrable 
with respect to g if the following limit exists: 
where D.n = { t0 , h, ... , tn} is a partition of [a, b], that is, a = to < h < · · · < 
tn = b, D.n = maxl<i<n(ti- ti_l), and TiE [ti-1 1 ti]· 
Theorem 31.1. For each f E L2 [a, b], the Wiener integral I: f(t)dBt is a random 
variable normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 11!11 2 = I: f(t) 2dt. 
Theorem 31.2. Let f be a continuous function in L2 [a, b]. Then for almost all 
wE rl, we have 
(lb f(t)dBt) (w) = (RS) lb f(t)dBt(w), 
where the right-hand side is the Riemann-Stieltjes integral and the left-hand side is 
the Wiener integral.

Since the Bt is a Brownian motion, E[(Bt, - Bt,_,)(Bt; - Bt;_,)] = 0 if i =f. j,

To to that, we first consider the case when f is a step function. Suppose that f is 
given by 
n 
f(r) = I:aJ[t;_ 1,ti)(r), 
r E [a, b), 
i=l 
where s = to < t 1 < · · · < tn = t. Note that the Bt is a martingale. We have 
E(Bti - Bti-l l§s) = 0 since ti 2': s for all i = 0, 1, ... , n. Then

Hence Equation (31.7) holds for step functions.

verging to fin L 2 [a, b]. Let the Xn be random variables defined as 
Then E(Xnl§s) = 0. By the conditional Jensen's inequality (see Problem 15.7)

The Wiener integral is a simple type of stochastic integral, which integrates a deter-
ministic function with respect to a standard Brownian motion. Most material in this 
chapter is taken from Kuo (2006), where readers can find proofs of Theorems 31.1 
and 31.2. 


CHAPTER 32 
THE ITO INTEGRAL 
The Ito integral defines an integral of a stochastic process with respect to a standard 
Brownian motion. The Ito integral is more general than the Wiener integral intro-
duced in the previous chapter. In this chapter, we shall introduce the concept of Ito 
integrals.

To do that, let

Then we have I: lf(u,w)l 2du ~ I: lf(u,w)l2du ~ C for all t E [a,b]. Hence 
we have fc(t,w) = f(t,w) for all t E [a,b]. It follows that I: f(t,w)dBt = 
I: fc(t,w)dBt. Therefore 
w E { lb f(t)dBt = lb fc(t)dBt}. 
Since w is arbitrary, the result holds. This completes the proof.

Since .f is an adapted stochastic process to some filtration { fft : a ::; t ::; b}, it

Bibliographic Notes 
The stochastic integral was first introduced by K. Ito in his 1944 paper (Ito, 1944 ). 
In this chapter, we defined the stochastic integral for stochastic processes f ( t) that 
are adapted to a filtration { §t : a :::; t :::; b} and satisfy the condition 
The stochastic integral 
1" f(t)dBt 
is defined in such a way that the stochastic process 
is a martingale. 
The proofs of Theorems 32.2 and 32.3 can be found in Kuo (2006, Chapter 4). 
The two theorems can be proved by first considering step stochastic processes and 
then general stochastic processes. 
There are several texts on stochastic calculus. Karatzas and Shreve ( 1991) intro-
duces stochastic calculus for Brownian motions. Baxter and Rennie (1996) gives an 
intuitive introduction to stochastic calculus. Durrett (1996) gives a concise introduc-
tion to stochastic calculus. Mikosch (1999) is a short book on stochastic calculus 
at an elementary level. Steele (2003) introduces stochastic calculus with a focus on 
finance applications. Klebaner (2005) introduced stochastic calculate with some ap-
plications in finance. Sondermann (2007) is a short course on stochastic calculus for 
finance. Roberts (2009) and Kopp (2011) are short books on Ito calculus. 
Malliavin and Thalmaier (2006) is a book on Malliavin calculus (i.e., stochastic 
calculus of variations), which provides mechanics to calculate derivatives of random 
variables.

Since P(A) = 1, the almost surely convergence is true. 
(b) By Problem 9.3, J: lfn(t) - f(t)i 2dt converges to 0 almost uniformly. By

This completes the proof.

Therefore Equation (33.4) is true. 
Since Equation (33.4) holds, we have { Tn < t} E fft. Hence by Problem 23.10, 
the r n is a stopping time. 
33.4. Let us first prove the "if" part. Suppose that { XtM : t 2: 0} is a martingale 
with respect to the filtration { fft : t 2: 0}. Then for all 0 :::; s < t, we have 
E[XtMiffs] = Xst\T· 
Since ffst\T <::;; ffs (see Problem 23.4) and Xst\T is ffsM-measurable (see Problem 
23.11), it follows from Problems 14.10 and 14.4 that 
Hence {XtM: t 2: 0} is a martingale with respect to the filtration {fftt\T: t 2: 0}. 
Now let us prove the "only if" part. Suppose that {Xtr\T : t 2: 0} is a martingale 
with respect to the filtration { fftM : t 2: 0}. Let 0 :::; s < t. Then, for all A E ffsM 
(see Problem 22.3), we have 
i XsMdP = i Xtt\TdP. 
Let C E §

C= (Cn{r:::; s})u(Cn{r > s}). 
Since C n { r > s} n { r :::; r} = C n { s < r :::; r} E ffr for all r 2: 0, it follows 
from Definition 23.3 that c n { T > s} E ffst\T• Hence we have

Also we have 
Combining Equations (33.5) and (33.6) gives

Therefore, we have

Note that I: lfn(tWdt::; n a.s. We have I: E(lfn(t)l 2 )dt::; n, which implies that 
fn E L~d([a, b] x 0). By Theorem 32.2, XtATn is the martingale. This completes 
the proof. 
33.6. LetT : n -+ [a, b] be a random variable defined as

T(w) =

if {t: f(t,w) =1- g(t,w)} = 0. 
Then T is the stopping time. Let X ( T) be a random variable defined as 
X(T) = 1T (f(u)- g(u))dBu = 1b I[a,Tj(u)(f(u)- g(u))dBu. 
Since I[a,Tj(u)(f(u)- g(u)) E L~d([a,b] x 0), the X(T) is defined. Then, by 
Theorem 32.1, we have 
But 
1b I[a,Tj(u)if(u)- g(u)l 2du = 1T lf(u)- g(u)l 2du = 0,

Therefore we have E(IX(TW) = 0, which implies that X(T) = 0 a.s., that is, 
P(X(T) = 0) = 1. Now let wE A. Then T(w) = b by the definition of A. Hence 
we have X(T(w)) = I:(f(u)- g(u))du. Hence we have 
{wE A: 1b f(t,w)dBt(w) =1-jb g(t,w)dBt(w)} <;;; {X(T) =/:- 0}, 
which implies that 
P {wE A: 1b f(t,w)dBt(w) =1-jb g(t,w)dBt(w)} = 0. 
This completes the proof.

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced the Ito integral for stochastic processes f ( t) satisfying 
the condition 
1b lf(t)l 2dt < oo, 
a.s. 
The resulting Ito integral is a random variable, which in general is not integrable. 
The associated stochastic process 
Xt = 1t f(u)dBu, 
t E [a, b], 
may not be a martingale but is a local martingale. For more information about the 
extension of Ito integrals, readers are referred to Karatzas and Shreve ( 1988), Lam-
berton and Lapeyre (1996), Steele (2003), and Kuo (2006, Chapter 5). For proper-
ties of local martingales, readers are referred to Durrett ( 1996), Meyer (2000), Steele 
(2003), and Medvegyev (2007).

Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 34.1 (Stochastic Process Space IL([a, b] x 0)). Let { $t : a :::; t :::; b} be 
a right-continuous filtration. The stochastic process space IL([a, b] X n) is the space 
of all stochastic processes X ( t, w) satisfying the following conditions: 
(a) X ( t) is adapted to the filtration { $t : a :::; t :::; b}. 
(b) Almost all sample paths of Xt are left-continuous. 
Definition 34.2 (Predictable Stochastic Process). Let P be the smallest a-field of 
subsets of [a, b] X n with respect to which all stochastic processes in IL([a, b] X n) 
are measurable. A stochastic process { Xt : a :::; t :::; b} is said to be predictable if

is P-measurable. 
Definition 34.3 (Increasing Process). A stochastic process { Xt : a ::; t ::; b} on a 
probability space (0, §, P) is said to be increasing if there exists a set 0 0 ~ 0 with 
P(00 ) = 1 such that for every w E 0 0 , 
(a) Xo(w) = 0. 
(b) The function t --+ Xt ( w) is a nondecreasing, right -continuous function, 
and E(Xt) < oo holds for every t E [a, b]. 
Definition 34.4 (Natural Process). An increasing process {At : a ::; t ::; b} is 
considered natural if for every bounded, right-continuous martingale { Mt : a ::; t ::; 
b} with left-hand limits, we have 
E ( { 
M 8 dA 8 ) == E ( { 
Ms_dAs) , 
J(o,t] 
J(o,t] 
where M 8 _ is the left-hand limit of Mt at s. 
Definition 34.5 (Square-Integrable Stochastic Process). A stochastic process { Xt : 
a ::; t ::; b} is said to be square-integrable if and only if for each t E [a, b], we have 
E(X;) < oo. 
Definition 34.6 (p-th Variation Process). Let X = { Xt : a ::; t ::; b} be a stochastic 
process. Let p > 0. Then the p-th variation process of X is defined as

where Ll = { t0 , t 1 , ... , tn} is a partition of the interval [a, t] and 
In particular, if p = 1, the process is referred to as the total variation process. If 
p = 2, the process is called the quadratic variation process and is written as [X]t.

Since Pis the a-field, we have a( C) c-;; P. 
Now we show that P c-;; a( C). To do this, let X E IL([a, b] x 0). Then X is

Note that X is adapted to the filtration fft. We have

Hence Xn is o-(C)-measurable. Since Xn converges to X a.s. and the filtration is 
complete, X is also CT(C)-measurable. Therefore, we have P <;;: CT(C) because Pis 
the smallest CT-field to which processes in JL([a, b] x n) are measurable. 
This completes the proof. 
34.3. Since { Mt : a :s; t :s; b} is a martingale, the M'f is an adapted process. By the 
assumption that the Mt is square-integrable, we have E(IMtl 2 ) < oo. Now by the 
conditional Jensen's inequality (see Problem 15.7), for a :s; s < t :s; b, we have 
E (M[Iffs) ~ [E(Mtlffs)] 2 = M?. 
Therefore, the M'f is a submartingale. 
34.4. Let 0 :s; s < t. Then 
E (Bllffs)

E ((Bt- Bs + Bs) 2lffs)

which implies that Bj; -tis a martingale. Note that 
Bl = (Bl - t) + t. 
The Doob-Meyer decomposition is Lt = Bj; - t and (B)t = t.

Theorem 34.2 states that if a square integrable martingale Mt is continuous, then 
the compensator of Ml is just the quadratic variation process of Mt. For a proof of 
Theorem 34.2, readers are referred to Karatzas and Shreve (1991, Theorem 5.8).

35.6. Apply the multidimensional Ito formula (Theorem 35.4). 
35.7. Part (a) can be proved by the definition of cross-variation processes (Definition

Xt = xoe-f3t +a 1t e-f3(t-s)dB8 • 
This completes the proof. 
35.6. Let (}(t, x, y) = xy. Then we have ~~ = 0, g! = y, g~ = x, S = 0, and 
a2e 
Bx2 = 0. By Theorem 35.4, we have

[Ytf(t) + Xtg(t)]dBt + [yt~(t) + XtTJ(t) + j(t)g(t)]dt. 
The result follows from the above equation. This completes the proof. 
35.7. 
(a) Note that (X - Y) 2 = (Y - X) 2 . By the uniqueness of the Doob-Meyer 
decomposition, we have (X - Y)t = (Y - X)t. Hence we have 
(X, Y)t 
1 4 ((X + Y)t - (X - Y)t) 
1 4 ( (Y + X)t- (Y- X)t) 
(Y, X)t· 
(b) By Theorem 35.8, (aX+ fJY, Z)t is the only process of the form A= A(l)-
A (2) with A (1) and A (2) adapted and natural, such that (aX + fJY)Z - A is a 
martingale. However, a(X, Z)t + fJ(Y, Z)t is a process of the same form such 
that 
(aX+ {JY)Z- a(X, Z)t- fJ(Y, Z)t 
is a martingale. Therefore, we have 
(aX+ {JY, Z)t = a(X, Z)t + fJ(Y, Z)t. 
(c) By definition, we have 
X'f = Mt + (X)t, 
where A1t is a martingale. Multiplying a 2 to both sides of the above equation 
gives 
(aXtf = a 2 Mt + a 2 (X)t. 
Since a 2 (X)t is an adapted and natural process and a 2 Mt is a martingale, we 
have (aX)t = a 2 (X)t· 

SOLUTIONS 
489 
(d) By parts(b) and (c), we have 
1 
(X, X)t = 4(2X)t = (X)t· 
(e) By part (b), we have 
(X + Y, X+ Y)t = (X)t + (Y)t + 2(X, Y)t 
and 
(X- Y, X- Y)t = (X)t + (Y)t - 2(X, Y)t· 
Since 
(X+ Y, X+ Y)t = (X + Y)t ~ 0 
and 
(X - Y, X - Y)t = (X - Y)t ~ 0, 
we have 
2I(X, Y)tl :S (X)t + (Y)t· 
Therefore, we have 
Replacing X by aX in the above equation and dividing a 2 in both sides, we 
get 
41 (X, Y)t 12 :S ( a(X)t - ~ (Y)t r 
+ 4(X)t (Y)t·

which gives I(X, Y)tl 2 :S (X)t(Y)t· 
This completes the proof. 
35.8. Let us first calculate (B(l), B(2))t. To do that, let us consider

THE ITO FORMULA

By using the properties of conditional expectations and the assumption that Bil) and 
Bl2l are independent, we have 
E ( Bi1l Bi2l l~s) 
E ( (Bil)- BFl)(Bi2l- Bi2l)J~s) + E ( BFl(Bi2l- B~2l)J~s)

s 
B~ll B~2l. 
Hence the BPl Bi2l is a martingale. Therefore, we have 
(B(1l, B(2l)t = 0. 
Now by Problem 35.7, we have 
(B(1l + B(2l)t = (B(ll)t + (B(2l)t + 2(B(1l, B(2l)t = 2t 
and 
(B(1l - B(2l)t = (B(1l)t + (B(2l)t - 2(B(1l, B(2l)t = 2t. 
35.9. 
Since f, g E L~d([a, b] x D), it follows from Theorems 32.1 and 32.2 that 
Xt + yt = J:(f(s) + g(s))dB8 and Xt- yt = J:(f(s)- g(s))dB8 are continuous, 
square-integrable martingales. By Problem 34.8 and Theorem 35.3, we have 
(X+ Y)t 
(Xt + Yf)2 - (Xa + Ya) 2 - 21t (Xs + Ys)(f(s) + g(s))dBs 
1t (f(s) + g(s)fds. 
Similarly, we have 
(X- Y)t 
(Xt- Yf) 2 - (Xa- Ya) 2 - 21t (Xs- Ys)(f(s)- g(s))dBs 
1t (f(s)- g(s)fds. 
Then by Definition 35.5, we have

This completes the proof. 
35.10. Since f, g E L~d([a, b] x f2), it follows from Theorems 32.1 and 32.2 that 
Xt and yt are continuous, square-integrable martingales. Since 
Xt + yt is also a continuous, square-integrable martingale. Similarly, Xt - yt is also 
a continuous, square-integrable martingale. By Problem 34.8 and Theorem 35.4, we 
have 
(X+ Y)t 
(Xt + Yt) 2 - (Xa + Ya) 2 - 21t (Xs + Ys)(f(s)dBFl + g(s)dB~2l) 
1t [!2(s) + g2(s)]ds. 
Similarly, we have 
(X- Y)t 
(Xt- Yf) 2 - (Xa- Ya) 2 - 21t (Xs- Ys)(f(s)dB~ 1)- g(s)dB~2)) 
1t [f2(s) + g2(s)]ds. 
Then by Definition 35.5, we have 
1 
(X, Y)t = 4((X + Y)t- (X- Y)t) = 0. 
This completes the proof. 
35.11. Let

THE ITO FORMULA 
By Theorem 35.4, we have 
This completes the proof. 
35.12. First let us assume that If I ::; k for some constant k. Let 
yt = 1t f(s)dBs, 
t E [a, b]. 
Then by Problem 32.16, exp(±yt) is finite. Hence all moments of Yt are finite. 
Therefore, we have 
which shows that Y 82n-l f(s) E L;d([a, b] x D). By Theorems 35.3 and 32.1, we 
have 
2nE [1t Y52n-l f(s)dBs] + n(2n- 1)E [1t Y52n- 2 j 2 (.s)ds] 
n(2n - 1 )E [1t Y82n-2 j 2 ( s )d.s] . 
(35.6) 
By Theorem 8.1, we have 
E [Y';2n] 
< n(2n- 1) 1t (E [Ys2n]) n;:' · (E [f2n(s)]) ~ ds 
n-1 
1 
:S: 
n(2n -1) (lt E [Y}n] ds) ---n · (1t E [f2n(s)] cis)" 
(35.7) 
Since Y';2n is a submartingale (see Problem 22.8), we get 

SOLUTIONS 
493 
Thus Equation (35.7) becomes 
1 
E [YrJ :::; n(2n- 1) ((t- a)E [Yr]) n;;:l · (1t E [f2n(s)] ds)"' 
Taking powers of n on both sides of the above inequality gives the result with Cn = 
[n(2n- l)]n. 
Now we prove the general case. Let fm(s) = min{m,max{-m,f(s)}} for 
m ~ 1. By the assumption that r E L~d([a, b] x 0), we have f E L~d([a, b] X 0) 
(see Problem 8.5). Since 
lfm(s)- f(s)l:::; lfm(s)l + lf(s)l:::; 21/(s)i, 
it follows from Theorem 6.4 that 
J~oo E [(fat fm(s)ds -lot f(s)ds)

Jo 
E [ rt lim Um(s)- f(s)) 2 ds] = 0. 
Jo n-+oo 
Hence 
1t fm(s)ds ~lot f(s)ds. 
Then by Problem 9.1 and Problem 9 .6, there exists a subsequence f m1 , f m2 , ••• such 
that 
lot fm;(s)ds ~lot f(s)ds. 
Hence it follows from Fatou's lemma (Theorem 6.3) that 
Cn(t- a)n- 1 1t E [f2n(s)] ds

This completes the proof.

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced the simple Ito formula, the multidimensional Ito for-
mula, and the Ito formula for martingales. For more information about Ito formula, 
readers are referred to Oksendal ( 1998) and Kuo (2006). Theorem 35.8 can be proved 
by using the same argument used to prove the uniqueness of the Doob-Meyer decom-
position (Karatzas and Shreve, 1991, p31 ). 
For some moment inequalities for Ito integrals, readers may read the papers by 
Zakai (1967) and Novikov (1973).

Then T is a stopping time and, by Problem 28.12, P { T < b} = 1.

Since h(-) is monotone, we have

37.4 Solutions 
37.1. By Definition 14.1, we have 
i Ev[Xj£]dv = i Xdv, 
\lA E £. 
Since dv = fdf-L, this equation gives

By the assumption that Ev[IXI] < oo and EIL[Ifl] < oo, by Problem 14.12, we have 
Again by Definition 14.1, we have

Combining Equations (37.1) and (37.2) gives

Hence by Definition 14.1, we get 
This completes the proof. 
37.2. Let {Xt : 0 :::; t :::; T} be defined as 
Xt = f 1t iJ(s,w)dB~il. 
j=l 0 
Then by Theorems 32.1 and 32.2, {Xt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a square-integrable martin-
gale. Note that by Ito's lemma (Theorem 35.4), we have 
m 
dXf = 2XtdXt + LJJ(t,w)dt. 
j=l 
By Theorem 34.4, we know that J; X 8 dXs is a martingale. Therefore, the compen-
sator of Xt is 
(X)t = f 1t f](s,w)ds. 
j=l 0 
Thus by the assumption, we have 
It follows from Theorem 37.1 that { Mt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a martingale. This completes 
the proof. 
37.3. By the definition of Q, we have 
Q(A) = i MTdP = Ep[MTIA], 
VA E $T. 
(37.3) 
Since $t ~ $T, Equation (37.3) leads to 
Q(A) = i MTdP = Ep[MTIA], 
VA E $t.

By Problem 14.10, we have

Combining Equation (37.4) and Equation (37.5) gives 
Q(A) = Ep[MtiA] = l MtdP,

Hence we have dQ = M 1dP on (D, § 1). This completes the proof. 
37.4. First, let use show that ~(i) is a martingale under the probability measure Q. 
To do that, let K}i) = M1 ~(i). Then by Theorem 35.4, we have 
which shows that K}i) is a martingale under probability measure P. By Problem

Hence ~(i) is a martingale under probability measure Q. 
Next, let us show that (Y(i), y(Jl)t = O;jt. Since

Therefore it follows from Theorem 37.2 that {yt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is an m-
dimensional Brownian motion with respect to the probability measure Q. This com-
pletes the proof. 
37.5. 
(a) It follows from Problem 37.4 that {Bt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is an m-dimensional

This completes the proof. 
37.6. Using the symbols from Problem 37.5, we have 
Then we can solve u 1 and u2 to get u 1 = -3 and u2 = 1. Let Mt be the martingale

Let f(t,w) = 7· Since r, f.l, and a are finite, f satisfies Novikov's

Then let Q be a probability measure on (0, §t) defined as 
dQ = MrdP. 
By Problem 37.4, the process {Wt : 0 ~ t ~ T} is a Brownian motion under Q. 
Now we show that Q and Pare equivalent. By Problem 7.6, we only need to 
show that 
P(Mr > 0) = 1.

Hence Equation (37.6) holds. This completes the proof.

37.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we introduced some results relevant to the change of measure. For 
a good introduction to how the change of measure is applied, readers are referred 
to Baxter and Rennie (1996). For more information about this subject, readers can 
consult Hunt and Kennedy (2004 ), Elliott and Kopp (2005), Sondermann (2007), and 
Hull (2008). 
N ovikov' s theorem (Theorem 3 7.1) pertains to exponential martingales constructed 
from martingales. A proof of this theorem can be found in Ikeda and Watanabe 
(1981, Theorem 5.3). 
The Levy characterization of Brownian motion theorem is very useful in that 
it allows us to check whether a stochastic process is a Brownian motion under a 
probability measure. A proof of this theorem can be found in Ikeda and Watanabe 
(1981, Chapter II) and Karatzas and Shreve (1991, Chapter 3).

STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATIONS 
A stochastic differential equation is a differential equation that involves stochastic 
processes. The solution of a stochastic differential equation is also a stochastic pro-
cess. In this chapter, we present stochastic differential equations and their solutions. 
38.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 38.1 (Strong Solution of SDE). A stochastic process { Xt : a :::; t :::; b} is 
called a strong solution of the following stochastic differential equation 
(38.1) 
if it satisfies the following conditions: 
(a) The stochastic process a(t, Xt) belongs to .Cad(O, L2[a, b]) so that for each 
t E [a, b], J: a(s, X 8 )dB8 is an Ito integral. 
(b) Almost all sample paths of f(t, Xt) belong to £ 1 [a, b].

(c) For each t, the following equation 
(38.2) 
holds almost surely. 
Definition 38.2 (Weak Solution of SDE). If there exist a probability space with a 
filtration, a Brownian motion {Bt: t ~ 0}, and a process {Xt: a:<:::; t :<:::; b} adapted 
to the filtration such that they satisfy the conditions given in Definition 38.1, then 
{ Xt : a :<:::; t :<:::; b} is called a weak solution to the stochastic differential equation 
(38.1). 
Definition 38.3 (Uniqueness of Solution). A stochastic differential equation is said 
to have a strongly unique (strong or weak) solution if any two solutions { Xt : a :<:::; 
t :<:::; b} and {lt : a :<:::; t :<:::; b} of the stochastic differential equation satisfy 
P{Xt = yt: a:<:::; t :<:::; b} = 1. 
A stochastic differential equation is said to have a weakly unique (strong or weak) 
solution if any two solutions of the stochastic differential equation have the same 
finite-dimensional distributions. 
Definition 38.4 (Lipschitz Condition). A measurable function f(t, x) on [a, b] x R 
is said to satisfy the Lipschitz condition in x if there exists a constant K > 0 such 
that 
if(t, x)- f(t, y)i :S Klx- Yi 
for all t E [a, b] and x, y E R. 
Definition 38.5 (Linear Growth Condition). A measurable function f(t, x) on [a, b] 
x R is said to satisfy the linear growth condition in x if there exists a constant K > 0 
such that 
lf(t,x)l :S K(l + lxl) 
for all t E [a, b] and x E R. 
Theorem 38.1 (Uniqueness and Existence of a Solution). Let f(·, ·) : [a, b] x Rn --+

lf(t,x)l + ia(t,x)l :S C(l + lxl),

38.4 Solutions 
38.1. 
(a) Let g(t) = J: ¢(s)ds fort E [a, b]. Then we have g'(t) = ¢(t) and g(a) = 0. 
By Equation (38.6), we get 
g'(t)::::; f(t) + f3g(t). 
Note that d[g(t)e-,6t] = e-,Bt[g'(t)- f3g(t)]dt. Hence we have 
:tg(t)e-,6t::::; f(t)e-,Bt, 
which gives 
g(t)e-,6t::::; 1t f(s)e-,6 8 ds. 
Therefore by Equation (38.6), we get 
¢(t) :'S f(t) + f3g(t)::::; f(t) + {31t f(s)e,B(t-s)ds. 
(b) This is implied from part (a). 
This completes the proof.

(a) When n = 1, by Equation (38.9), we have 
When n = 2, by Equation (38.9), the above equation, and integration by parts, 
we have 
03(t) < f(t) + (31t [f(s) + (31

(b) This is a special case of part (a). 
This completes the proof. 
38.3. Let r 1 , r 2 , ... be the sequence of all rational numbers in the interval [a, b] and 
An= {wE 0: Zrn (w) = 0} for n = 1, 2, .... By assumption, we have P(An) = 1 
for all n. Let 
00 
n=1 
Then by Problem 11.1, we have P(A) = 1. Now since the Zt is a continuous 
process, there exists a subset B of 0 such that P(B) = 1 and for each w E B, we 
see that Zt(w) is a continuous function oft on [a, b]. Let 
Oo=AnB. 
Then P(Oo) = 1. Noting that for each wE 0 0 , we have Zrn (w) = 0 for all n ~ 1. 
Hence for each w E Oo, we have Zt(w) = 0 for all t E [a, b] because each real 
number in [a, b] can be approximated by rational numbers in [a, b]. This completes 
the proof.

38.4. 
Suppose that Xt and yt are two continuous solutions of the stochastic dif-
ferential equation in Equation (38.1). Let Zt = Xt - yt. Then Zt is a continuous 
stochastic process and 
Applying the inequality (x + y) 2 :S 2x2 + 2y2 to the above equation gives 
Zz :S 2 (1t [u(s, Xs)- u(s, Ys)]dBs) 
2 + 2 (1t [f(s, Xs)- f(s, Ys)]ds) 
2 
By the assumption that u( t, x) and f ( t, x) satisfy the Lipschitz condition in x, there 
exists a constant K > 0 such that 
lu(t,x)- u(t,y)l :S Klx- Yl 
and 
lf(t,x)- f(t,y)l :S Klx- Yl 
for all t E [a, b] and x, y E R. Hence we have 
1t E [(u(s,Xs)- u(s, Ys)) 2] ds 
< K 2 1t E(z;)ds 
and by Schwarz's inequality (Theorem 8.3), we have 
(1t [f(s, Xs)- f(s, Ys)]ds) 
2 
< (t- a) 1t [f(s, Xs)- f(s, Ys)] 2ds 
< (b- a)K2 1t z;ds. 
Therefore 
Zz :S 2K2 (1 + b- a) 1t E(z;)ds. 
By Problem 38.1, we have E(Z'f) = 0 for all t E [a, b]. Hence Zt = 0 a.s. for each 
t E [a, b]. By Problem 38.3, almost all sample paths of Zt are zero. Hence Xt and 
yt are the same continuous solutions. This completes the proof.

it follows from Problem 38.1 that 
which implies that

Now if we let 
then combining Equation (38.12) and Equation (38.11) gives

which gives 
Xt = Xo exp ( (JL- ~a2) t +a Bt) . 
This finishes the solution. 
SOLUTIONS

38.8. Since f(t) and g(t) are bounded, both xf(t) and xg(t) satisfy the Lipschitz 
condition in x and the linear growth condition in x. Hence by Theorem 38.1, the 
stochastic differential equation (38.1 0) has a unique solution. 
By Theorems 34.2 and 34.4, we have 
[X]t = (X)t = lt f(s) 2d(B)s = lt f(s) 2ds. 
Let Ut be defined as 
Ut = exp ( Xt- Xo- ~ lt f(s)ds).

which shows that {Ut : t ~ 0} satisfies Equation (38.10). Hence {Ut : t ~ 0} is the 
only solution of Equation (38.1 0). This completes the proof.

Hence we have 
Xt = Xae~"t + 1t e~"(t-s)adB8 • 
38.10. By Ito's lemma, we have

Integrating both sides of the above equation gives 
et Xt = Xo + m(et- 1) +a 1t e8 dB8 • 
Hence we have 
Xt = m + (Xo- m)e-t +a 1t e8-tdB8 • 
This completes the solution. 
38.11. Let 
yt = exp ( -aBt + ~a2t). 
Then by Theorem 35.4, we have

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented stochastic differential equations. In fact, the stochas-
tic differential equation in Equation (38.1) is just a symbolic expression and must 
be interpreted as the stochastic integral equation in Equation (38.2). Under certain 
conditions, the stochastic differential equation has a unique solution. A proof of 
the uniqueness is given in Problem 38.4. For a proof of the existence, readers are 
referred to Oksendal (1998) and Kuo (2006). For a proof of Theorem 38.2 and an 
example of a stochastic differential equation that has no strong solution but a weak 
solution, readers are referred to Oksendal (1998, p71). 
Several texts on stochastic differential equations have been published since the 
mid-1990s. Oksendal (1998) is textbook on stochastic differential equations on the 
graduate level. Prevot and Rockner (2007) is a short book on stochastic partial differ-
ential equations. Allen (2007) introduced the theory, computation, and application 
of Ito stochastic differential equations. Other books that introduce stochastic dif-
ferential equations include Friedman (1975), Friedman (1976), Ikeda and Watanabe 
(1981), Karatzas and Shreve (1988), and Protter (2003). 
Numerical methods for stochastic differential equations are developed in Kloeden 
and Platen ( 1995) and Iacus (2008). For a proof of the moment inequalities given in 
Theorem 38.3, readers are referred to Kloeden and Platen ( 1995).

A diffusion or a diffusion process is a solution to a stochastic differential equation. In 
this chapter, we will present some results about diffusion, in particular, Ito diffusion.

Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 39.1 (Compact Set). A set K ~ R is called a compact set if every open 
cover of K contains a finite subcover; that is, if {VihEI is a collection of open sets 
such that 
K~ UVi,

Definition 39.3 (Support). The support of a function f on R is the closure of the set 
{x E R: f(x)-=/= 0}. 
Definition 39.4 (C1,2-Function). A function f on R x R is called a C 1,2-function 
if f(t, x) is continuously differentiable on t (i.e., ~{ is continuous) and twice con-
tinuously differentiable on x (i.e., ~:{ is continuous). 
Definition 39.5 (Diffusion). A diffusion is a solution to a stochastic differential 
equation of the form 
(39.1) 
where s ~ 0 and x are some constants, f-L and a are functions satisfying the Lip-
schitz continuity condition and the linear growth condition given in Theorem 38.1. 
The functions f-L and a are called the drift coefficient and the diffusion coefficient, 
respectively. 
The unique solution of Equation (39.1) is denoted by x;,x, t ~ s. If s = 0, the 
solution is denoted by Xf. 
Definition 39.6 (Ito Diffusion). An Ito diffusion is a stochastic process 
Xt = X(t,w): [O,oo) X n---+ R 
satisfying the following stochastic differential equation 
(39.2) 
where s ~ 0 and x are real constants, { Bt : t ~ 0} is a standard Brownian motion, 
and b : R ---+ R and a : R ---+ R are functions satisfying the Lipschitz continuity 
condition 
lb(z)- b(y)l + la(z)- a(y)l :S: c1lz- yl, 
z, y E R 
and the linear growth condition 
lb(z)l + la(z)l :S: c2(l + lzl), 
z E R. 
Definition 39.7 (Probability Measure Qx). Let {Xt : t ~ 0} be a diffusion as 
defined in Definition 39.5. The probability measure Qx is the probability law (see 
Definition 21.2) of {Xt : t ~ 0} assuming that X 0 = x. Mathematically, Qx is 
given by 
where P is the probability law of the underlying Brownian motion, h < t 2 < · · · < 
tk are arbitrary times, and E 1 , ... , Ek are arbitrary Borel sets. 
The expectation under the probability measure Qx is denoted by Ex.

where Bu = Bu+s - Bs and yt = x:-t-xs· Since {Bt : t ~ 0} is also a Brownian

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented diffusions, which are defined to be the solutions of 
stochastic differential equations. For general definition of diffusions or diffusion 
processes, readers are referred to Friedman (1975), Karlin and Taylor (1981), and 
Stirzaker (2005). Diffusions are also studied in several other books such as Stroock 
and Varadhan (1979), Durrett (1996), Oksendal (1998), Rogers and Williams (2000), 
Klebaner (2005), and Pinsky (1995). Revuz and Yor (1999) discusses properties of 
the generator of Xt. 
Theorem 39.1 and Theorem 39.2 state that Ito diffusions have the Markov prop-
erty and the strong Markov property, respectively. Proofs of these theorems can be 
found in Friedman (1975), Oksendal (1998), and <;inlar (2011). 
Some concepts (e.g., compact and support) presented in this chapter are adopted 
from real analysis. For general definition of these concepts, readers are referred to 
Rudin (1970). 


CHAPTER40 
THE FEYNMAN-KAC FORMULA 
The solutions to certain second-order partial differential equations can be represented 
as expectations of stochastic functionals. In fact, the Feynman-Kac formula estab-
lishes a link between certain partial differential equations and stochastic processes. 
In this chapter, we present the Feynman-Kac formula.

THE FEYNMAN-KAC FORMULA 
Definition 40.2 (Cauchy-Dirichlet Problem). Let Q = (0, T) x D, ~here D = (a, b) 
is an interval and T > 0. Let opQ = ([O,T] x {a,b}) U ({T} x D). A Cauchy-
Dirichlet problem is a partial differential equation of the form 
(40.2a) 
u(t, x) = cp(t, x), 
(t, x) E opQ, 
(40.2b) 
where b, u, f, a, and cp are given functions. The function u is called a solution to the 
Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. 
Definition 40.3 (Cauchy Problem). Let Q = (0, T) x R, where T > 0. A Cauchy 
problem is a partial differential equation of the form 
(40.3a) 
u(T,x) = cp(x), 
x E R, 
(40.3b) 
where b, u, f, a, and cp are given functions. The function u is called a solution to the 
Cauchy problem. 
Theorem 40.1 (The Feynman-Kac Formula). Let f be a C 2 function on R with a 
compact support. Let q be a lower bounded continuous function on R. Let v ( t, x) 
be a function on R + x R defined as 
v(t, x) =Ex [t(Xt) exp (-lot q(Xs)ds)] , 
where { Xt : t ~ 0} is an Ito diffusion as defined in Definition 39.6. Then v( t, x) is 
a solution to the following Cauchy problem 
ov 
ot (t,x) = Lv(t,x)- q(x)v(t,x), 
t > O,x E R, 
(40.4a) 
v(O, x) = f(x), 
x E R, 
(40.4b) 
where L is the second order differential operator associated with the Ito diffusion 
(see Definition 39.9 ):

Moreover, ifw(t, x) is a C1•2 function on R+ x R that is bounded on K x R+ for 
each compact K ~ Rand w( t, x) solves the initial-value problem given in Equation 
(40.4), then w(t, x) = v(t, x)_

40.1. Apply Ito's lemma (Theorem 35.3) to the process yt = u(Xt)Zt. where 
Zt = exp (-lot a(Xs)ds) .

The proof is similar to that of Problem 40.1. That is, apply Ito's lemma 
(Theorem 35.3) to the process Ys = u(X8 )Z8 , where

THE FEYNMAN-KAC FORMULA 
Then apply the Feynman-Kac formula (Theorem 40.1) and the dominated conver-
gence theorem (Theorem 6.4). 
40.6. Apply the Feynman-Kac formula (Theorem 40.1) to prove the first part. Use 
the first part to prove the second part. 
40.4 Solutions 
40.1. Let 
Zt = exp (-lot a(Xs)ds), 
t ~ 0. 
Then by Theorem 35.3, we have 
(40.10) 
Also by Theorem 35.3 and the assumption, we have 
du(Xt) 
au 
a(Xt) ax (Xt)dBt + Lu(Xt)dt 
au 
a(Xt) ax (Xt)dBt + [a(Xt)u(Xt) + f(Xt)]dt. 
(40.11) 
Then it follows from Problem 35.6, and Equations (40.10) and (40.11) that 
Zfu(Xt) = u(x) +lot Z';a(X';) ~~ (X';)dBs +lot Z'; f(X';)ds, 
where z; = exp (- J~ a(X;)ds). Hence we have 
rD 
a 
rD 
z:Du(Xf)=u(x)+ Jo 
Z';a(X';)a~(X';)dBs+ Jo 
Z';f(X';)ds. 
By the assumption, we have z; E [0, 1]. Hence Z';a(X';) ~~(X';) and z; f(X';) 
are bounded on {(t, w) : Xf(w) ED}. Therefore, by Theorem 32.1 we have 
Hence we have 
The result follows by noting that u(X;D) = c.p(X;D ). This completes the proof. 
40.2. Let 
Z 8 =exp(-1
8 a(r,Xr)dr), 
s~t. 

SOLUTIONS 
553 
Then by Theorem 35.3, we have 
dZ8 = -a(s, X 8 )Z8 ds, 
s > t. 
Also by Theorem 35.3 and the assumption, we have 
du(s, X 8 ) 
= a~~ dB8 + ( ~~ + L 8U) ds 
au 
a ax dB8 +(au+ f) ds. 
Then by Problem 35.6, we have 
Hence we have 
zt,x u(T 
xt,x ) 
Tt,x 
t,x, 
Tt,x 
where 
z;.x = exp ( -1
8 a(r, x;·x)dr) . 
By the assumption that a(s, X 8 ) is lower-bounded, a satisfies the linear growth

By Problem 38.6, Xr is integrable. Since Tn AT --+ T as n --+ oo, it follows from 
Theorem 6A that

Lett ~ 0 be fixed. Let g(x) = u(t, x). By Theorem 39.2, g(Xr) =

Combining the above two equations gives

Then f n (X) is a C 2 function with a compact support. It follows from Theorem 40.1

40.5 Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented several versions ofthe Feynman-Kac formula, each ver-
sion of which involves some technical conditions on underlying coefficients and ini-
tial data. Although these conditions are different, the idea behind the Feynman-Kac 
formula is the same. For a discussion of the technical conditions for the Feynman-
Kac formula, readers are referred to Duffie (2001). 
The Feynman-Kac formula is studied in many texts, for example, Karatzas and 
Shreve (1991), Durrett (1996), Bass (1998), Oksendal (1998), Steele (2003), and 
Pascucci (2011). In this chapter, we presented only the one-dimensional Feynman-
Kac formula. For the multidimensional Feynman-Kac formula, readers are referred 
to Karatzas and Shreve (1991), Oksendal (1998), Shreve (2004), Pinsky (1995), 
Pham (2009), and Pascucci (2011). 
The Dirichlet problem, the Cauchy problem, and the heat equation are subjects 
studied in partial differential equations. Steele (2003, Chapter 11) gives a very good 
introduction to the derivation of the heat equation. For an introduction to the heat 
equation and Cauchy problem, readers are referred to Cannon (1984). The connec-
tion between the heat equation and the Brownian motion is discussed in Karatzas and 
Shreve (1991) and Lawler (2006).

DISCRETE-TIME MODELS 
In discrete-time models, it is assumed that trading takes place at discrete time points. 
In this chapter, we present discrete-time models of financial markets. In particular, 
we will introduce the binomial model.

Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 41.1 (Discrete Market). Let T be a positive real number and N be a 
positive integer. Let 0 = t0 < t 1 < · · · < tN = T. Let (0, §, P) be a probability 
space, where 0 is finite, ,~ = 211, and P { w} > 0 for every w E 0. A discrete 
market is a ( d + 1 )-dimensional stochastic process 
s = {(S~0l, s~Il, ... , s~dl): n = o, 1, ... , N} 
defined on the probability space (0, §, P).

Definition 41.2 (Normalized Market). Let S be a discrete market and { § n : n = 
0, ... , N} be the filtration as defined in Definition 41.1. Let Y = {Yn : n = 
0, 1, ... , N} be a positive §n-adapted price process. The normalized market of S

The process Y is called a numeraire. 
Definition 41.3 (Portfolio). A portfolio or strategy is a ( d + 1 )-dimensional stochas-
tic process 
a = { ( a~0 ), a~1 ), ... , a~d)) : n = 0, 1, ... , N}. 
The value of the portfolio a at time tn is 
d 
Vn(a) = La~ls~l. 
j=O 
Definition 41.4 (Self-Financing Portfolio). A portfolio a is called self-financing if 
for every n in {1, 2, ... , N}, we have 
d 
Vn_I(a) = La~ls~2 1 .

Definition 41.5 (Predictable Portfolio). A portfolio a is called predictable if for 
every n in {1, 2, ... , N}, (a~o), a~1 ), ... , a~d)) is §n_1-measurable, where §n is 
as given in Definition 41.1. 

BASIC CONCEPTS AND FACTS 
563 
Definition 41.6 (Arbitrage). Let A be the family of all self-financing, predictable 
portfolios of the discrete market. A portfolio a E A is called an arbitrage if V0 (a) = 
0 and there exists n ~ 1 such that P{Vn(a) ~ 0} = 1 and P{Vn(a) > 0} > 0. 
The discrete market is called arbitrage-free if A does not contain arbitrage port-
folios. 
Definition 41.7 (Admissible Portfolio). A portfolio a is called admissible if for ev-
ery n in {1, 2, ... , N}, we have 
P{Vn(a) ~ 0} = 1. 
Definition 41.8 (Equivalent Martingale Measure). Let Y be an numeraire. An equiv-
alent martingale measure withY is a probability measure Q on (n, §)such that 
(a) Q"' P (see Definition 7.3). 
(b) the ¥-normalized price processes are Q-martingales: 
n = 1, 2, ... , N, j = 0, 1, ... , d, 
where EQ denotes the expectation under the probability measure Q. 
Definition 41.9 (European Derivative). A European derivative is an§ N-measurable 
random variable on (n, §, P), where §n is given in Definition 41.1. 
Definition 41.10 (Replicating Portfolio for European Derivatives). Let X be a Eu-
ropean derivative. A portfolio a E A is said to be a replicating portfolio of X if 
VN(a) =X P- a.s. 
If such a portfolio exists, the derivative is said to be replicable. 
A portfolio a E A is said to be a superreplicating portfolio for X if 
VN(a) ~X P- a.s. 
The family of all super-replicating portfolio for X is denoted by A!-: 
A!-= {a E A: P{VN(a) ~X}= 1}. 
A portfolio a E A is said to be a subreplicating portfolio for X if 
VN(a) ::; X P- a.s. 
The family of all sub-replicating portfolio for X is denoted by A _X: 
A_X ={a E A: P{VN(a)::; X}= 1}.

Definition 41.11 (American Derivative). An American derivative is a nonnegative 
discrete stochastic process X = { Xn : n = 0, 1, ... , N} adapted to the filtration 
{ $n : n = 0, 1, ... , N}, where the filtration is as given in Definition 41.1. 
Definition 41.12 (Exercise Strategy). An exercise strategy or exercise time of an 
American derivative is a stopping time v : n ---+ {0, 1, ... , N}. The set of all 
exercise strategies is denoted by To-
Definition 41.13 (Payoff of American Derivatives). Let X be an American derivative 
and v an exercise strategy. The payoff of X relative to the strategy v is the random 
variable Xv defined by 
Xv(w) = Xv(w)(w), 
\:!wE D. 
Let Q be an equivalent martingale measure with numeraire Y. An exercise strat-
egy v0 is called optimal under Q if 
Definition 41.14 (Replicating Portfolio for American Derivatives). Let X be an 
American derivative. A portfolio o: E A is said to be a superreplicating portfolio 
for X if 
Vn(o:) ~ Xn P- a.s., 
\In= 0, 1, ... , N. 
The family of all superreplicating portfolios for X is denoted by A :k: 
A:k ={a: E A: P{Vn(o:) ~ Xn} = 1, n = 0, 1, ... ,N}. 
The family Ax is defined as 
Ax = { o: E A: there exists v E To such that P{ Xv ~ Vv(o:)} = 1 }. 
Definition 41.15 (Complete Market). A market is said to be complete if every Eu-
ropean derivative is replicable. 
Definition 41.16 (Arbitrage Price). Let X be a replicable European derivative in a 
market that is free of arbitrage. Then arbitrage price or risk-neutral price of X is 
V(o:), where o: is a replicating portfolio of X (see Problem 41.16). 
Definition 41.17 (Binomial Model). In the binomial model, the market is composed 
of two assets: a riskless asset and a risky asset. The time intervals have the same 
length: 
T 
tn- tn-1 = N, 
n = 1, 2, ... , N. 
The interest rate is assumed to be constant, namely, rn = r for every n. The dynam-
ics of the riskless asset is given by 
S~0l=(1+r)n, n=0,1, ... ,N. 

PROBLEMS

the method of contradiction. 
41.2. To prove the first part, follow the definitions of equivalent martingale measure, 
self-financing portfolio, and predictable portfolio. The second part follows from the 
first part. 
41.3. Apply the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing (Theorem 41.1) and use 
the result of Problem 41.2. 
41.4. Use the result of Problem 14.20 to prove the first part. To prove the second 
part, first use the first part to show that 
j = 0, ... , d, n = 0, ... , N,

41.8. Follow the definition of equivalent martingale measures (Definition 41.8) and 
use the result of Problem 14.19 to prove part (a). Follow the definition of indepen-
dence (Definition 12.2) and use the result of Problem 14.10 to prove part (b). Use 
the result of Problem 41.7 and part (a) to prove part (c).

(Theorem 23.1). 
41.11. Use the results of Problems 41.9 and 22.11. 
41.4 Solutions 
41.1. The sufficiency part is clear. If Sis arbitrage-free, then there exist no arbitrage 
portfolios. Hence there exist no admissible arbitrage portfolios. 
Now we prove the necessity part. Assume that there exist no admissible arbitrage 
portfolios. We show that S is arbitrage-free by contradiction. If there exists an 
arbitrage portfolio a, then by Definition 41.6, we have 
d 
Vo(a) = L aij) s60) = 0, 
j=O 
and there exists an integer k :=:: 1 such that 
P{Vk(a) :=:: 0} = 1 and P{Vk(a) > 0} > 0. 
By the hypothesis, a is not admissible. Hence there exist an integer m <::; N and a 
set FE §m with P(F) > 0 such that 
and 
d

'Vw E F 
j=O 
1' { w 't,a';fl(w)s!{>(w);:, 0} ~ 1, Vm < n,; N. 
If m = N, we let (3~) = 0 on D\F for all j = 0, 1, ... , d and n = 0, 1, ... , N, 
and 
(3(j) = {-VN(a),

0, 
if n = N and j = 0; 
otherwise. 
j = 0, ... , d, n = 0, ... , N.

DISCRETE-TIME MODELS 
Hence we have Vn(,B) = 0 on 0\F, Vn(,B) = 0 on F for n < N, and VN(,B) = 
-VN(a)S~) > 0 on F. Therefore, ,B is an admissible portfolio. This contradicts the 
assumption. 
If m < N, we can also find an admissible portfolio, which contradicts the as-
sumption. This completes the proof.

(a) By the assumption that a E A, we know that a is self-financing and predictable. 
Then by Problem 14.12, for every n E { 1, 2, ... , N}, we have 
which shows that V(a) is a Q-martingale. 
(b) By the first part and Problem 14.10, we have 
Repeating the above calculation gives 
EQ [Vn(a)] = EQ [Vo(a)] = Vo(a), 
because V0 (a) is a real number. 
This completes the proof. 
41.3. 
Since Sis arbitrage-free, it follows from Theorem 41.1 that there exists an 
equivalent martingale measure Q with numeraire Y. Let V(a) and V(,B) be the 
normalized portfolios with respect to Y. By Problem 41.2, V(a) and V(,B) are 
Q-martingales. By the assumption that P{VN(a) = VN(,B)} = 1 and the fact 
that P "' Q, we have Q{VN(a) = VN(,B)} = 1. Hence we have for every n in 
{0, 1, ... , N}, 
Vn(a) = EQ [VN(a)l§n] = EQ [VN(,B)I§n] = Vn(,B) Q- a.s. 
Since P "' Q, we get 
Vn(a) = Vn(,B) P- a.s.

models. 
For numerical implementation of binomial models, readers are referred to James 
(2003), Higham (2004), Brandimarte (2006), and Rouah and Vainberg (2007). As the 
number of time steps increases, the binomial price of an European option converges 
to the Black-Scholes price (Follmer and Schied, 2004).

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING 
MODELS 
The Black-Scholes model for pricing stock options is a revolutionary result in math-
ematical finance. Many of the pricing techniques and models used today in finance 
are rooted in the methods and ideas from the Black-Scholes model. In this chapter, 
we present the Black-Scholes model and relevant results.

Definition 42.4 (Normalized Black-Scholes Market). Let { (X}0l, Xt) : 0 ::; t ::; 
T} be a Black-Scholes market given in Definition 42.2. Then X 1(o) = ert. The 
normalized Black-Scholes market is the process given by { (1, X1 ) : 0 ::; t ::; T}, 
where Xt = e-rt Xt. 
The value at timet of a portfolio¢ = { ( eio), Bt) : 0 ::; t ::; T} for the normalized 
market is given by 
Definition 42.5 (Self-Financing Portfolio). A portfolio¢ = { ( 8~ 0 ), 81 ) : 0 ::; t ::; T} 
is said to be self-financing if it satisfies the following properties: 
(a) 

BASIC CONCEPTS AND FACTS

to be replicable if there is an admissible portfolio ¢ such that 
h = Vr(¢), P- a.s., 
i.e., 
P{h = Vr(¢)} = 1. 
The admissible portfolio that replicates h is called a replicating portfolio for h.

corresponding value process { vt ( ¢) : 0 ::::; t ::::; T} satisfies 
(a) Vo(¢) = 0.

The price process {yt : 0 ~ t ~ T} is called a numeraire. 
Theorem 42.1 (First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing). Let S be a continuous 
market as defined in Definition 42.1. Then S is arbitrage-free if and only if there 
exists at least one risk-neutral measure. 
Theorem 42.2 (Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing). LetS be a contin-
uous market as defined in Definition 42.1. Suppose that S is arbitrage-free. Then

measure with numeraire { S~o) : n = 0, 1, ... , N}.

Solutions 
42.1. Let Vi ( rp) be the value of the portfolio at time t. Then the value at time t of 
the portfolio for the normalized market is Vf(¢) = r;-rtv;(¢). 
First, let us prove the sufficiency ("if") part. Suppose that ¢ is self-financing for 
the market { (X1(o), X 1 ) : 0 <::: t <::: T}. To show that ¢ is self-financing for the 
normalized market, we only need to show that for every t E [0, T], we have

for the normalized market [i.e., Equation (42.5) holds]. Since yt(¢) = e~' 1 1it:(4J), we 
have

Combining Equations (42.6) and (42.9) gives 
ciVi(¢) = rVi(dl)- r8tXt + 8tdXt = 8~ 0 )dXI 0 ) + 8tdXt. 
Hence (/J is self-financing for {(XI0J, X1): 0 <::: t <::: T}. 
This finishes the proof. 
42.2. Since q) is self-financing for the Black-Scholes market, we have 
(42.1 0) 
Let {W1 : 0 <::: t <::: T} be the Brownian motion under Q that was defined in Problem 
37.7. Then dX1 = aX1dW1• Hence from Equation (42.10), we have 
vt = Yo+ t 8saXsdWs, 
t E [0, T]. 
Jo 
By the assumption that¢ is admissible, snpo<t<T Vi is square-integrable. By Prob-
lem 33.7 and Theorem 32.1, "Vt is a square-inte-grable martingale. This finishes the 
proof. 

SOLUTIONS

42.3. By Problem 42.2, the value processes Vr ( ¢) and Vr ( 1/J) are martingales under 
Q. Hence we have 
(42.11) 
and 
1/t('l/J) = EQ[Vr('l/J)Ifft], 
Q- a.s. 
(42.12) 
By the assumption, we have P{Vr(¢) -=/= Vr('l/J)} = 0. By Problem 37.7, P"' Q. 
Hence we have Q{Vr(¢)-=/= Vr('l/J)} = 0. Therefore, we have 
(42.13) 
Combining Equations ( 42.11 ), ( 42.12), and ( 42.13) gives 1ft ( ¢) = 1ft ( 1/J ), Q-a.s. The 
result follows from the fact that Q and P are equivalent. This completes the proof. 
42.4. 
(a) Let {(1, Xt) : 0 :":: t :":: T} be the normalized market. By Problem 42.1, we 
only need to show that there exists an admissible portfolio cP = { ( 8~0), 8t) : 0 :":: 
t :":: T} such that for every t E [0, T], we get 
(42.14) 
To do that, let Mt = EQ [e-rThlfft]· Then {Mt : 0 :":: t :":: T} is a square-
integrable martingale adapted to the fft. Since { fft : 0 :":: t :":: T} is also 
the natural filtration of the Brownian motion {Wt : 0 :":: t :":: T} under Q, by 
Theorem 36.1, there exists an adapted process { Kt : 0 :":: t :":: T} such that 
and for every t E [0, T], we get 
(42.15) 
Now we define 
t E [O,T]. 
(42.16) 
Then we have 
which shows that¢ is self-financing. Since his square-integrable under Q, it 
follows from Problem 24.5 that supo<t<T 1/t(¢) is square-integrable under Q. 
Thus ¢ is an admissible portfolio.

(b) Let ¢ = { ( 0}0l, Bt) : 0 ~ t ~ T} be the admissible portfolio found in the first 
part. Since h is §r-measurable, by Problem 14.4, the value at time T of the 
portfolio is 
Vr(¢) = EQ[hl§r] =h. 
Therefore, the portfolio ¢ has the same payoff as the option at maturity. By 
Problem 42.3, the value at time t of the option is 
Vi(¢)= EQ [e-r(T-t)hl§t]

Note that Wr - Wt is independent of §t and that Xt is §t-measurable. It follows

F(t, x) = EQ [e-r(T-t) f ( xe(r-!u2)(T-t)+u(WT-Wt))].

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was 
first discovered by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes (Black and Scholes, 1973) and 
further developed by Robert Merton (Merton, 1973). There are several approaches 
to deriving the model (Andreasen et al., 1998). 
The Black-Scholes model is discussed in many books such as Merton (1990), 
Wilmott et al. (1995), Lamberton and Lapeyre (1996), Shiryaev (1999), Ross (1999), 
Neftci (2000), Duffie (2001), Karatzas and Shreve (2001), Etheridge (2002), Steele 
(2003), Shreve (2004), Bingham and Kiesel (2004), Dineen (2005), Jiang (2005), 
Elliott and Kopp (2005), Back (2005), Klebaner (2005), Musiela and Rutkowski 
(2005), Bjork (2009), and Pascucci (2011), to name only a few. 
The option pricing models presented in this chapter are based on one risky as-
set, whose price follows a geometric Brownian motion. Cherubini et al. (2004) and 
Allen (2007) discussed models based on two risky assets. Jondeau et al. (2007) 
discussed option pricing under non-Gaussian distributions. Delbaen and Schacher-
mayer (2006) presented the mathematics of arbitrage and several original papers on 
asset pricing. Back et al. (2004) introduced models for incomplete markets, where 
European options may not be replicable. Katz and McCormick (2005) presented 
other models (e.g., neural networks) for option pricing. 
Smith (1976) presented a comprehensive discussion of the analytic properties of 
the option pricing functions. Hobson (2004) is a survey paper on mathematical fi-
nance. For introduction to various financial derivatives, readers can consult Kolb 
(1993), Wilmott et al. (1995), Houthakker and Williamson (1996), Hull (2001), 
Wilmott (2001), Eales and Choudhry (2003), Franke et al. (2004), Back (2005), Mc-
Donald (2005), Wilmott (2006), Kwok (2008), Neftci (2008), and Hull (2008). 
Theorems 42.1 and 42.2 are the two fundamental asset pricing theorems for continuous-
time markets. For proofs of these theorems, readers are referred to Shreve (2004, 
Section 5.4). 


CHAPTER43 
PATH-DEPENDENT OPTIONS 
Path-dependent options are also referred to as "exotic options", whose payoffs de-
pend on the path of the underlying asset. In this chapter, we present pricing formulas 
for some path-dependent options within the Black-Scholes framework.

43.5. 
The proof is similar to that of Problem 43.4. Let Wt = 7t + Bt for 
0 ~ t ~ T and Q the risk-neutral measure Q defined in Problem 37.7. Then {Wt : 
0 ~ t ~ T} is a Brownian motion under Q. By Problem 42.4, the time-zero price of 
the up-and-out European call option is 
Guo= EQ [e-rT(Xr- K)+ l{max09 ~TXt<H}] · 
The stochastic differential equation of Xt can be written as 
Solving the above stochastic differential equation (see Problem 38.7) gives 
Xt = Sexp (aat + aWt) = Seo-z,, 
0 ~ t ~ T, 
(43.23) 
where a= (r- ~a2 )ja and Zt =at+ Wt. Let Mr = maxo:<S;t:S:T Zt. Then 
Hence, we can rewrite Equation (43.23) as 
Guo 
EQ [e-rT(Xr- K)J{XT>K,Sexp(o-MT)<H}] 
EQ [e-rT(S exp(aZr)- K)I{ZT>~ In ~,MT<~ In~}] .(43.24) 
If K 2: H, the up-and-out call option is knocked out before being in the money. 
Hence the payoff is zero and the option price is also zero. 
If K < H, then by Problem 43.1, we have 
Guo =

43.6. Let Wt = 7 t + Bt for 0 :::; t :::; T and Q the risk neutral measure Q defined 
in Problem 37.7. Then {Wt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a Brownian motion under Q. By 
Problem 42.4, the price at time t of the floating-strike lookback European put option 
is 
Pfloating(t) 
EQ [e-r(T-tl(Hr- Xr)l$t] 
e-r(T-t) (EQ [Hrl$t]- EQ [Xrl$t]). 
Since { e-rt Xt : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a Q-martingale, we have 
EQ [e-rTXrl$t] = e-rtxt. 
Hence we can write Equation (43.25) as 
Pfloating(t) = e-r(T-t) EQ [Hrl$t] - Xt. 
(43.25) 
(43.26) 
To compute EQ[Hrl$t]. we let a= (r- ~a 2 )/a and Zt =at+ Wt. Then we 
can write Xt as follows (see Problem 38.7): 
Xt = Xo exp (aat + aWt) = Xoeaz,, 
0 :::; t :::; T, 
Let Mt = maxo:S;u:S;t Zu fortE [0, T]. Then we have 
Since 
(43.27) 
Mr- Mt = [max Zu- Mt] + = [max (Zu- Zt)- (Mt- Zt)] +

Let V1 = maxt~u~ra(Zu - Zt) and V2 = ln ~0 Since Ht and V2 are §r

that

Since Zu- Zt = a(u- t) + Wu- Wt and Zu-t- Zo = a(u- t) + Wu-t have the

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented some closed-form pricing formulas for certain path-
dependent options. The pricing formulas for the European barrier options were in-
troduced by Merton (1973), Rubinstein (1991), and Rubinstein and Reiner (1991). 
General versions of these formulas can be found in Haug (2006). 
Like the European barrier options, the lookback options also have closed form 
pricing formulas. The pricing formulas for floating-strike lookback options and 
fixed-strike lookback options were introduced by Goldman et al. (1979) and Conze 
and Viswanathan (1991), respectively. These formulas are also presented in Haug 
(2006). 
Asian options are also path-dependent options. But unlike the barrier options and 
lookback options, Asian options do not have closed form pricing formulas. The price 
of Asian options is obtained by solving partial differential equations numerically. For 
more details about Asian option pricing, readers are referred to Shreve (2004) and 
Haug (2006). 

CHAPTER44 
AMERICAN OPTIONS 
Unlike European options, American options can be exercised at any time up to and 
including the expiration date. This early exercise feature makes American options 
more difficult to price than European ones. In this chapter, we present risk-neutral 
pricing of American options.

By Problem 23.9, X is also ffv-measurable. Now let C E ffv. Since

First let us prove the "only if" part. Suppose that T* is optimal. Then by 
Problem 44.2, we have 
But by Theorem 44.2, Ur. ~ Yr. a.s. The above equation implies that Ur. = Yr. 
a.s. Also by Theorem 44.2, {Ut : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a supermartingale. It follows from 
Theorem 23.1 that {UtM. : 0:::; t:::; T} is also a supermartingale. Since 
Uo = E[Yr.] = E[Ur.], 
we have 
E[UTM.J = E[Ur.] = E[E[Ur.Jl = E[Uo] = E[UoM.J· 
By Problem 22.12, {UtM. : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a martingale. 
Now we prove the "if" part. Suppose that Ur. =Yr. a.s. and the stopped process 
{UtM. : 0 :::; t :::; T} is a martingale. Then we have 
which shows that T* is optimal. This completes the proof.

Then we have Jt = Mt - Ct. Since { Mt : 0 ::::; t ::::; T} a bounded martingale under 
Q, it is a square-integrable martingale under Q. It follows from Theorem 36.1 that 
dMt = 17tdWt,

Also we have

Hence the extended strategy ((3, C, -1, r) E d 0 . 
If x6a) < Vo, we show that there is long arbitrage. Let p0 be the optimal stop-

By Theorem 32.2, we have

If X 0 > L*, then Xs > L* during the period (0, t 1\ T£. ). Hence Equation

(44.11) 
If X 0 ~ L*, we have T£. = 0. The above equation still holds. It follows 
from the optimal sampling theorem (Theorem 23.2) that {ytML. : t ~ 0} is a 
martingale. 
(e) By part (d), the process { e-rtvL. (Xt) : t ~ 0} is a supermartingale. For any

(b) By Problem 42.4, the price at timet of the European call option with strike K 
and maturity T is given by 
But by the first item, we have 
which shows that the price of the European call option always dominates the 
intrinsic value of the American call option. Hence the option to exercise early 
is worthless. Thus the price of the American call option agrees with the price 
of the European call option. 
This completes the proof.

Bibliographic Notes 
The pricing problem of the American option can be formulated in different ways 
(Barone-Adesi, 2005; Wilmott et al., 1995). In this chapter, we presented the pricing 
problem in terms of optimal stopping. For more information about optimal stopping 
and American options, readers are referred to Bensoussan ( 1984 ), Karatzas ( 1988), 
Jacka (1991), and Myneni (1992). For a survey of the results on the pricing of 
American options, readers are referred to Barone-Adesi (2005) and Ahnet al. (20 11 ). 
The American option is also studied in Briys et al. ( 1998), Oksendal ( 1998), Karatzas 
and Shreve (2001), Elliott and Kopp (2005), and Musie1a and Rutkowski (2005). 
Analytic solutions of the pricing models for American options are not avail-
able. Numerical methods for pricing American options can be found in Broadie and 
Glasserman ( 1997), Longstaff and Schwartz (200 1 ), Topper (2005), Chan and Wong 
(2006), Seydel (2006), Duffy (2006), and Korn et al. (2010). Amin and Khanna 
(1994) proved the convergence of the binomial prices of the American option. 
Although there exist no analytic pricing formulas for American options, approx-
imate analytic pricing formulas for American options have been developed. For 
such approximate pricing formulas, readers are referred to Barone-Adesi and Wha-
ley ( 1987), Kim ( 1990), and Haug (2006).

CHAPTER45 
SHORT RATE MODELS 
Short rate models are the earliest stochastic interest rate models. In this chapter, we 
present several short rate models and relevant concepts. 
45.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 45.1 (Zero-Coupon Bond). A zero-coupon bond with maturity date T is 
a contract that guarantees the holder a cash payment of one unit on the date T. Zero-
coupon bonds are also referred to as T -bonds. The price at time t of a zero-coupon 
bond maturing at Tis denoted by P(t, T). 
Definition 45.2 (Spot Rate and Short Rate). Let 0 :::;: t < T. The simple spot rate 
for [t, T] is defined to be 
F(t,T) = T~t (P(t~T) -1). 
The continuously compounded spot rate for [t, T] is defined to be 
R(t,T)= -lnP(t,T).

SHORT RATE MODELS 
The function T---+ R(t, T) is called the zero-coupon yield curve or yield curve. The 
instantaneous short rate at time t is defined as 
r(t) = limR(t,T). 
T.j,.t 
Definition 45.3 (Bank Account). A bank account or money-market account repre-
sents a risk-free investment. The value f3(t) at timet of a bank account is defined 
as 
f3(t) = ef~r(s)ds, 
where r( s) is the short rate at time s. 
Definition 45.4 (Discount Factor). Let 0 ::::; t ::::; T. The (stochastic) discount factor 
D(t, T) between timet and timeT is defined as 
D(t T) = f3(t) = e- It r(s)ds 
' 
f3(T) 
. 
Definition 45.5 (Short Rate Model). In general, a short rate model has the following 
form 
n 
dr(t) = b(t)dt + L <Tj(t)dBij), 
j=l 
where {(Bi1), Bi2), ... , Bin)) : t 2: 0} is ann-dimensional Brownian motion on 
some filtered probability space (n, §, {§t : t 2: 0}, P), and {b(t) : t 2: 0} and 
{<Tj(t) : t 2: 0} are adapted processes that satisfy standard conditions (see Theorem 
38.1) required to guarantee the existence of the short rate process. 
Definition 45.6 (Equivalent Martingale Measure). Let (r!, §, P) be the real world 
probability space for the bond market. A probability measure Q defined on (f!, §) 
is called an equivalent martingale measure if 
(a) Q "'P. 
(b) For every T > 0, the discounted price process { P~~~~) : 0 ::::; t ::::; T} is a mar-
tingale. 
In this definition, we can restrict T E [0, T*] for some upper bound T*. An equiva-
lent martingale measure is also referred to as a risk-neutral measure. 
Definition 45.7 (T-Contingent Claim). Let (f!, §, {§t : t 2: 0}, Q) be a filtered 
risk-neutral probability space for the bond market, where Q is an equivalent martin-
gale measure. AT-contingent claim X is a §r-measurable random variable such 
that

Theorem 45.1 (Risk-Neutral Price). Let (0, $, {$t: t 2: 0}, Q) be a filtered risk-
neutral probability space for the bond market, where Q is an equivalent martingale 
measure. Then the price process of a T -contingent claim X is given by 
In particular, the price process of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T is given 
by

space (D, .9/, {.9/t : t ~ 0}, P), and {a(t) : t ~ 0} and {b(t) : t ~ 0} are 
adapted processes that satisfy standard conditions (see Theorem 38.1). Suppose that 
P( t, T) = P( r( t), t, T); that is, the timet price of a zero-coupon bond with maturity

vt = P(t, S)- KP(t, T). 
This completes the proof. 
45.2. 
(a) Let Q be the equivalent martingale measure on (0, ff). Then by Theorem 45.1, 
we have 
P(t, T) = Eq [ e- It r(s)dsl fft] . 
By Theorem 39.1, the short rate process {r(t) : 0 :S t :S T} is Markovian. 
Hence it follows from Problem 29.2 that 
P(t, T) = Eq [ e- It r(s)dsl r(t)]. 
By Theorem 11.2, P(t, T) is a function of r(t). 
(b) By part (a), P(t, T) is a function of r(t). Let P(t, T) = P(r(t), t, T). Then by 
Theorem 35.3, we have

Then we have 
dP(t, T) = P(t, T)[m(t, T)dt + v(t, T)dBt]· 
(c) By the Girsanov Theorem (see Problem 37.4), {Wt : 0 :S t :S T} is a Brownian 
motion under Q. Now we show that the discounted price process { P(t, T)e- I~ r(u)du : 
0 :S t :S T} is a martingale under Q. Let Z(t, T) = P(t, T)e- I,; r(u)du. By

By the assumption that v(t, T) and m(t, T) are bounded and Theorem 38.1, we 
have 
Hence we have 
Eq [loT Z(t, T)2v(t, T) 2dt] < oo. 
It follows from Theorem 32.2 that Z(t, T) is a martingale. 
This completes the proof. 
45.3. 
(a) Let T1 < T2. Let V be a portfolio constructed by shorting V1 amount in T1-
bond and purchasing V2 amount in T2-bond. Then the value at time t of the 
portfolio is v ( t) = v2 ( t) - vl ( t). The instantaneous investment gain from t to 
t + dt is 
By Ito's lemma (Theorem 35.3), we have 
Then we have 
dV(t) = [V2(t)m(t, T2) - V1 (t)m(t, Tl)]dt 
+[V2(t)v(t, T2) - V1 (t)v(t, T1)]dBt. 
(45.5) 
Suppose that we choose V1 ( t) and V2 ( t) in such a way that 
Note that V(t) = V2(t) - V1 (t). Solving the above equations gives 
V1(t) _ 
V(t)v(t, T2) 
V2(t) = 
V(t)v(t, T1) 
- v(t, Tl) - v(t, T2)' 
v(t, Tl) - v(t, T2) 
Then Equation (45.5) becomes 
dV(t) = V(t) m(t, T2)v(t, T1) - m(t, T1)v(t, T2) dt 
(45.6) 
v(t, Tl) - v(t, T2) 
' 
which shows that the portfolio V has deterministic growth. Hence the growth 
rate must be the risk-free rate r(t): 
m(t, T2)v(t, T1) - m(t, Tl)v(t, T2) = r(t) 
v(t, T1) - v(t, T2)

models are discussed in Svoboda (2004). For discrete interest rate models, readers 
are referred to Cairns (2004) and Pascucci and Runggaldier (2012). 
Short rate models are also studied in many other books, such as Hunt and Kennedy 
(2004), Shreve (2004), Musiela and Rutkowski (2005), Brigo and Mercurio (2006), 
Bjork (2009), Filipovic (2009), Ekstrand (2011), and Lyuu (2001), to name only a 
few. For general term structure models, readers are referred to Baxter (1997), Bjork 
et al. (1997), and Jin and Glasserman (2001). For a review on interest rate models, 
readers are referred to Rebonato (2004). 
Theorem 45.1 states the risk-neutral price of interest rate derivatives, which in-
clude zero-coupon bonds. A proof of this theorem can be found in Cairns (2004, 
Theorem 4.1). 


CHAPTER46 
INSTANTANEOUS FORWARD RATE 
MODELS 
The short rate models presented in the previous chapter are not flexible for calibra-
tion. As a consequence, Heath et al. (1992) introduced a new uniform framework, 
called the HJM framework, for modeling the interest rates. In the Heath-Jarrow-
Morton (HJM) framework, the entire forward curve is modeled directly. These inter-
est rate models are called HJM models or instantaneous forward rate models. In this 
chapter, we introduce some concepts related to the HJM framework.

Definition 46.2 (Forward Contract). Lett < T. A forward contract on an underlying 
Y, entered at timet, with maturity Tis defined as follows: 
• At timeT, the contract holder at the long side pays f(t, T, Y) and receives Y 
from the contract holder at the short side, where f(t, T, Y) is the forward price 
of Y at timet. 
• At time t, the forward price is chosen such that the value of the contract is zero, 
where r( u) is the short rate and Q is the equivalent martingale measure for the 
bond market: 
Definition 46.3 (Futures Contract). Lett < T. A futures contract on an underlying 
Y, entered at timet, with maturity Tis defined as follows: 
• At timeT, the contract holder at the long side pays F(t, T, Y) and receives Y 
from the contract holder at the short side, where F(t, T, Y) is the futures price 
quoted at time t for the futures contract. 
• At time t, the futures price is chosen such that the value of the contract is zero. 
• During any infinitesimal time interval (t, t + J], the contract holder at the long 
side receives F(t + J, T, Y) - F(t, T, Y) from the contract holder at the short 
side.

Hints 
46.1. Follow the definition of instantaneous forward rates (Definition 46.1 ).

and 
lot a-(s, t)dB8 =lot a(s, s)dBs +lot lou ~;(s, u)dB8 du. 
To prove parts (b) and (c), use the classical Fubini theorem (Theorem 10.2) and the 
stochastic Fubini theorem (Theorem 46.1), respectively. Part (d) can be proved by 
parts (b) and (c). 
46.4. To prove the first part, use the results of Problems 14.10 and 14.12 to show that 
Qr(A) = Qs(A) for every A E §r. To prove the second part, follow the defini-
tion of equivalent martingale measure (Definition 45.6) and consider the probability 
measure defined as ~~ = L(T*). 
46.5. To prove part (a), use the result of Problem 46.1 and Fubini's theorem (The-
orems 10.2 and 46.1). To prove part (b), use Theorem 45.1 and Fubini's theorem 
(Theorems 10.2 and 46.1). Use part (b) and Theorem 46.3 to prove part (c). 
46.6. Use Theorem 45.1 and the results of Problems 40.6 and 46.5. 
46.4 Solutions 
46.1. By Definition 46.1, we have 
dlnP(t,u) = -f(t,u)du. 
Integrating both sides of the above equation from S to T gives 
ln P(t, T) -In P(t, S) =- fsT f(t, u)du, 
or 
P(t, T) = P(t, S) exp (- fsT f(t, u)du) . 
This completes the proof. 

46.2. By Problem 46.1 and the fact that P(t, t) = 1, we have 
lnP(t, T) = -1T f(t, u)du.

dr(t) = ( i (t, t) + a(t, t)) dt + cr(t, t)dBt. 
(b) By assumption and Theorem 10.2, we have

lot 1T a(s, u)dudB8 -lot lou a(s, u)dB8 du. 
(d) By Ito's lemma (Theorem 35.3), the stochastic differential equation 
dP(t, T) = P(t, T) [m(t, T)dt + v(t, T)dBt] 
is equivalent to the stochastic differential equation 
dlnP(t,T) = ( m(t,T)- ~v2 (t,T)) dt+v(t,T)dBt. 
(46.5) 
Now by assumption we have 
f(t, u) = f(O, u) +lot a(s, u)ds +lot a(s, u)ds. 
Since ln P(t, T) = - Jt f(t, u)du, we have 
lnP(t,T) 
-1T f(O, u)du- 1T lot a(s, u)dsdu -1T lot a(s, u)dsdu. 
By parts (b) and (c), the above equation becomes

{Wt : 0 ::; t ::; T*} be a process defined as 
Then by Problem 37.4, {Wt : 0 ::; t ::; T*} is a Brownian motion under Q. 
Equation (46.7) becomes

Hence Equation (46.8) becomes

By Theorem 32.2, { Z ( t, T) : 0 ::; t ::; T} is a martingale.

Bibliographic Notes 
In this chapter, we presented the HJM framework and the HJM drift condition. For 
more information about HJM framework, readers are referred to Bingham and Kiesel 
(2004), Svoboda (2004), Musiela and Rutkowski (2005), Carmona (2006), Brigo and 
Mercurio (2006), and Filipovic (2009). 
Theorem 46.1 is a version of Fubini's theorem for stochastic integrals. A proof of 
this theorem can be found in Svoboda (2004, p166). For a multidimensional version 
of the stochastic Fubini theorem, readers are referred to Filipovic (2009, Theorem 
6.2). A proof of Theorem 46.2 can be found in Bingham and Kiesel (2004). For the 
rational behind the futures price (see Theorem 46.3), readers are referred to Filipovic 
(2009, Section 8.2). 


CHAPTER47 
LIBOR MARKET MODELS 
The short rate models and the HJM models introduced in the previous chapters con-
centrate on unobservable rates, including short rates and instantaneous forward rates. 
Brace et al. (1997) introduced LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) market mod-
els, which model the observable LIBOR rates directly. In this chapter, we introduce 
the LIBOR model and relevant concepts. 
47.1 
Basic Concepts and Facts 
Definition 47.1 (LIBOR). Let 8 > 0 and 0::; t < T. The 8-period forward LIBOR 
for the future date T prevailing at time t is defined as 
1 ( 
P(t,T) 
) 
L(t,T)=F(t;T,T+8)=-g P(t,T+ 8) -1 . 
Definition 47.2 (T-Forward Measure). Let Q be an equivalent martingale measure 
for the bond market. LetT> 0. Then the T-forward measure on (0, .#r) is defined 
as

Definition 47.3 (LIBOR Market Model). Let 8 > 0 and M be a positive integer. 
LetTM = M8bethefinitetimehorizon. Let(O,ff,{fft: 0:::; t:::; TM},QTM) 
be the underlying filtered probability space, where QTM is the TM-forward measure. 
For every integer m = 0, 1, ... , M- 1, there is a deterministic bounded measurable 
function .>..(t, Tm), where Tm = m8. For every integer m = 0, 1, ... , M- 1, the 
initial forward LIBOR rate is given by 
L(O, Tm) = ~ ( P(O, Tm) - 1) .

In this chapter, we introduced the LIBOR market model, which is also referred to as 
the BGM model. The model is a collection of dynamics for the forward LIB OR rates 
that traders are used to working with. For more information about LIBOR market 
models, readers are referred to Rebonato (2002), Hunt and Kennedy (2004), Bing-
ham and Kiesel (2004), Musiela and Rutkowski (2005), Hull (2008), and Filipovic 
(2009).
