Preface
A fashionable curriculum proposition is that students should
be given what they need and no more. It often comes bun-
dled with language like “efﬁcient” and “lean.” Followers
are quick to enumerate a number of topics they learned as
students, which remained unused in their subsequent lives.
What could they have accomplished, they muse, if they could
have back the time lost studying such retrospectively un-
used topics?
But many go further—they conﬂate unused
with useless and then advocate that students should therefore
have lean and efﬁcient curricula, teaching only what students
need. It has a convincing ring to it. Who wants to spend time
on courses in “useless studies?”
When confronted with this compelling position, an even
more compelling reply is to look the protagonist in the eye
and ask, “How do you know what students need?” That’s the
trick, isn’t it? If you could answer questions like that, you
could become rich by making only those lean and efﬁcient
investments and bets that make money. It’s more than that
though. Knowledge of the fundamentals, unlike old lottery
tickets, retains value. Few forms of human knowledge can
beat mathematics in terms of enduring value and raw utility.
Mathematics learned that you have not yet used retains value
into an uncertain future.
It is thus ironic that the mathematics curriculum is one
of the ﬁrst topics that terms like lean and efﬁcient get applied
to. While there is much to discuss about this paradox, it is
safe to say that it has little to do with what students actually
need. If anything, people need more mathematics than ever
as the arcane abstractions of yesteryear become the consumer
products of today. Can one understand how web search en-
gines work without knowing what an eigenvector is? Can
one understand how banks try to keep your accounts safe on
the web without understanding polynomials, or grasping how
GPS works without understanding differentials?
All of this knowledge, seemingly remote from our every-
day lives, is actually at the core of the modern world. With-
out mathematics you are estranged from it, and everything
descends into rumour, superstition, and magic. The best les-
son one can teach students about what to apply themselves
to is that the future is uncertain, and it is a gamble how one
chooses to spend one’s efforts. But a sound grounding in
mathematics is always a good ﬁrst option. One of the most
common educational regrets of many adults is that they did
not spend enough time on mathematics in school, which is
quite the opposite of the efﬁciency regrets of spending too
much time on things unused.
A good mathematics textbook cannot be about a con-
trived minimal necessity. It has to be more than crib notes for
a lean and diminished course in what students are deemed to
need, only to be tossed away after the ﬁnal exam. It must be
more than a website or a blog. It should be something that
stays with you, giving help in a familiar voice when you need
to remember mathematics you will have forgotten over the
years. Moreover, it should be something that one can grow
into. People mature mathematically. As one does, concepts
that seemed incomprehensible eventually become obvious.
When that happens, new questions emerge that were previ-
ously inconceivable. This text has answers to many of those
questions too.
Such a textbook must not only take into account the na-
ture of the current audience, it must also be open to how well
it bridges to other ﬁelds and introduces ideas new to the con-
ventional curriculum. In this regard, this textbook is like no
other. Topics not available in any other text are bravely in-
troduced through the thematic concept of gateway applica-
tions. Applications of calculus have always been an impor-
tant feature of earlier editions of this book. But the agenda
of introducing gateway applications was introduced in the
8th edition. Rather than shrinking to what is merely needed,
this 9th edition is still more comprehensive than the 8th edi-
tion. Of course, it remains possible to do a light and minimal
treatment of the subject with this book, but the decision as to
what that might mean precisely becomes the responsibility
of a skilled instructor, and not the result of the limitations of
some text. Correspondingly, a richer treatment is also an op-
tion. Flexibility in terms of emphasis, exercises, and projects
is made easily possible with a larger span of subject material.
Some of the unique topics naturally addressed in the
gateway applications, which may be added or omitted, in-
clude Liapunov functions, and Legendre transformations, not
to mention exterior calculus. Exterior calculus is a powerful
reﬁnement of the calculus of a century ago, which is often
overlooked. This text has a complete chapter on it, written
accessibly in classical textbook style rather than as an ad-
vanced monograph. Other gateway applications are easy to
cover in passing, but they are too often overlooked in terms of
their importance to modern science. Liapunov functions are
often squeezed into advanced books because they are left out
of classical curricula, even though they are an easy addition
to the discussion of vector ﬁelds, where their importance to
stability theory and modern biomathematics can be usefully
noted. Legendre transformations, which are so important to
modern physics and thermodynamics, are a natural and easy
topic to add to the discussion of differentials in more than
one variable.
There are rich opportunities that this textbook captures.
For example, it is the only mainstream textbook that covers
sufﬁcient conditions for maxima and minima in higher di-
mensions, providing answers to questions that most books
gloss over. None of these are inaccessible. They are rich op-
portunities missed because many instructors are simply unfa-
miliar with their importance to other ﬁelds. The 9th edition
continues in this tradition. For example, in the existing sec-

xvi
tion on probability there is a new gateway application added
that treats heavy-tailed distributions and their consequences
for real-world applications.
The 9th edition, in addition to various corrections and
reﬁnements, ﬁlls in gaps in the treatment of differential equa-
tions from the 8th edition, with entirely new material. A
linear operator approach to understanding differential equa-
tions is added. Also added is a reﬁnement of the existing
material on the Dirac delta function, and a full treatment of
Laplace transforms. In addition, there is an entirely new sec-
tion on phase plane analysis. The new phase plane section
covers the classical treatment, if that is all one wants, but it
goes much further for those who want more, now or later. It
can set the reader up for dynamical systems in higher dimen-
sions in a unique, lucid, and compact exposition. With ex-
isting treatments of various aspects of differential equations
throughout the existing text, the 9th edition becomes suitable
for a semester course in differential equations, in addition to
the existing standard material suitable for four semesters of
calculus.
Not only can the 9th edition be used to deliver ﬁve stan-
dard courses of conventional material, it can do much more
through some of the unique topics and approaches mentioned
above, which can be added or overlooked by the instruc-
tor without penalty. There is no other calculus book that
deals better with computers and mathematics through Maple,
in addition to unique but important applications from infor-
mation theory to Lévy distributions, and does all of these
things fearlessly. This 9th edition is the ﬁrst one to be pro-
duced in full colour, and it continues to aspire to its subtitle:
“A Complete Course.” It is like no other.
About the Cover
The fall of rainwater droplets in a forest is frozen in an instant of time. For any small
droplet of water, surface tension causes minimum energy to correspond to minimum
surface area. Thus, small amounts of falling water are enveloped by nearly perfect
minimal spheres, which act like lenses that image the forest background. The forest
image is inverted because of the geometry of ray paths of light through a sphere. Close
examination reveals that other droplets are also imaged, appearing almost like bubbles
in glass. Still closer examination shows that the forest is right side up in the droplet
images of the other droplets—transformation and inverse in one picture. If the droplets
were much smaller, simple geometry of ray paths through a sphere would fail, because
the wave nature of light would dominate. Interactions with the spherical droplets are
then governed by Maxwell’s equations instead of simple geometry. Tiny spheres ex-
hibit Mie scattering of light instead, making a large collection of minute droplets, as in
a cloud, seem brilliant white on a sunny day. The story of clouds, waves, rays, inverses,
and minima are all contained in this instant of time in a forest.

To the Student
You are holding what has become known as a “high-end”
calculus text in the book trade. You are lucky. Think of it as
having a high-end touring car instead of a compact economy
car. But, even though this is the ﬁrst edition to be published
in full colour, it is not high end in the material sense. It
does not have scratch-and-sniff pages, sparkling radioactive
ink, or anything else like that. It’s the content that sets it
apart. Unlike the car business, “high-end” book content is
not priced any higher than that of any other book. It is one
of the few consumer items where anyone can afford to buy
into the high end. But there is a catch. Unlike cars, you have
to do the work to achieve the promise of the book. So in
that sense “high end” is more like a form of “secret” martial
arts for your mind that the economy version cannot deliver.
If you practise, your mind will become stronger. You will
become more conﬁdent and disciplined. Secrets of the ages
will become open to you. You will become fearless, as your
mind longs to tackle any new mathematical challenge.
But hard work is the watchword. Practise, practise, prac-
tise. It is exhilarating when you ﬁnally get a new idea that
you did not understand before. There are few experiences as
great as ﬁguring things out. Doing exercises and checking
your answers against those in the back of the book are how
you practise mathematics with a text. You can do essentially
the same thing on a computer; you still do the problems and
check the answers. However you do it, more exercises mean
more practice and better performance.
There are numerous exercises in this text—too many for
you to try them all perhaps, but be ambitious. Some are
“drill” exercises to help you develop your skills in calcula-
tion. More important, however, are the problems that develop
reasoning skills and your ability to apply the techniques you
have learned to concrete situations. In some cases, you will
have to plan your way through a problem that requires sev-
eral different “steps” before you can get to the answer. Other
exercises are designed to extend the theory developed in the
text and therefore enhance your understanding of the con-
cepts of calculus. Think of the problems as a tool to help you
correctly wire your mind. You may have a lot of great com-
ponents in your head, but if you don’t wire the components
together properly, your “home theatre” won’t work.
The exercises vary greatly in difﬁculty.
Usually, the
more difﬁcult ones occur toward the end of exercise sets, but
these sets are not strictly graded in this way because exercises
on a speciﬁc topic tend to be grouped together. Also, “dif-
ﬁculty” can be subjective. For some students, exercises des-
ignated difﬁcult may seem easy, while exercises designated
easy may seem difﬁcult. Nonetheless, some exercises in the
regular sets are marked with the symbols I, which indicates
that the exercise is somewhat more difﬁcult than most, or A,
which indicates a more theoretical exercise. The theoretical
ones need not be difﬁcult; sometimes they are quite easy.
Most of the problems in the Challenging Problems section
forming part of the Chapter Review at the end of most chap-
ters are also on the difﬁcult side.
It is not a bad idea to review the background material
in Chapter P (Preliminaries), even if your instructor does not
refer to it in class.
If you ﬁnd some of the concepts in the book difﬁcult
to understand, re-read the material slowly, if necessary sev-
eral times; think about it; formulate questions to ask fellow
students, your TA, or your instructor. Don’t delay. It is im-
portant to resolve your problems as soon as possible. If you
don’t understand today’s topic, you may not understand how
it applies to tomorrow’s either. Mathematics builds from one
idea to the next. Testing your understanding of the later top-
ics also tests your understanding of the earlier ones. Do not
be discouraged if you can’t do all the exercises. Some are
very difﬁcult indeed. The range of exercises ensures that
nearly all students can ﬁnd a comfortable level to practise
at, while allowing for greater challenges as skill grows.
Answers for most of the odd-numbered exercises are
provided at the back of the book. Exceptions are exercises
that don’t have short answers: for example, “Prove that : : : ”
or “Show that : : : ” problems where the answer is the whole
solution. A Student Solutions Manual that contains detailed
solutions to even-numbered exercises is available.
Besides I and A used to mark more difﬁcult and the-
oretical problems, the following symbols are used to mark
exercises of special types:
P Exercises pertaining to differential equations and initial-
value problems.
(It is not used in sections that are
wholly concerned with DEs.)
C
Problems requiring the use of a calculator. Often a sci-
entiﬁc calculator is needed. Some such problems may
require a programmable calculator.
G
Problems requiring the use of either a graphing calcu-
lator or mathematical graphing software on a personal
computer.
M Problems requiring the use of a computer. Typically,
these will require either computer algebra software (e.g.,
Maple, Mathematica) or a spreadsheet program such as
Microsoft Excel.

To the Instructor
Calculus: a Complete Course, 9th Edition contains 19 chap-
ters, P and 1–18, plus 5 Appendices. It covers the material
usually encountered in a three- to ﬁve-semester real-variable
calculus program, involving real-valued functions of a sin-
gle real variable (differential calculus in Chapters 1–4 and
integral calculus in Chapters 5–8), as well as vector-valued
functions of a single real variable (covered in Chapter 11),
real-valued functions of several real variables (in Chapters
12–14), and vector-valued functions of several real variables
(in Chapters 15–17). Chapter 9 concerns sequences and se-
ries, and its position is rather arbitrary.
Most of the material requires only a reasonable back-
ground in high school algebra and analytic geometry. (See
Chapter P—Preliminaries for a review of this material.)
However, some optional material is more subtle and/or the-
oretical and is intended for stronger students, special topics,
and reference purposes. It also allows instructors consider-
able ﬂexibility in making points, answering questions, and
selective enrichment of a course.
Chapter 10 contains necessary background on vectors
and geometry in 3-dimensional space as well as some lin-
ear algebra that is useful, although not absolutely essential,
for the understanding of subsequent multivariable material.
Material on differential equations is scattered throughout the
book, but Chapter 18 provides a compact treatment of or-
dinary differential equations (ODEs), which may provide
enough material for a one-semester course on the subject.
There are two split versions of the complete book.
Single-Variable Calculus, 9th Edition covers Chapters P,
1–9, 18 and all ﬁve appendices. Calculus of Several Vari-
ables, 9th Edition covers Chapters 9–18 and all ﬁve appen-
dices. It also begins with a brief review of Single-Variable
Calculus.
Besides numerous improvements and clariﬁcations
throughout the book and tweakings of existing material such
as consideration of probability densities with heavy tails in
Section 7.8, and a less restrictive deﬁnition of the Dirac delta
function in Section 16.1, there are two new sections in Chap-
ter 18, one on Laplace Transforms (Section 18.7) and one on
Phase Plane Analysis of Dynamical Systems (Section 18.9).
There is a wealth of material here—too much to include
in any one course. It was never intended to be otherwise. You
must select what material to include and what to omit, taking
into account the background and needs of your students. At
the University of British Columbia, where one author taught
for 34 years, and at the University of Western Ontario, where
the other author continues to teach, calculus is divided into
four semesters, the ﬁrst two covering single-variable calcu-
lus, the third covering functions of several variables, and the
fourth covering vector calculus. In none of these courses
was there enough time to cover all the material in the appro-
priate chapters; some sections are always omitted. The text
is designed to allow students and instructors to conveniently
ﬁnd their own level while enhancing any course from gen-
eral calculus to courses focused on science and engineering
students.
Several supplements are available for use with Calculus:

What Is Calculus?
Early in the seventeenth century, the German mathematician Johannes Kepler analyzed
a vast number of astronomical observations made by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe
and concluded that the planets must move around the sun in elliptical orbits. He didn’t
know why. Fifty years later, the English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton
answered that question.
Why do the planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun? Why do hurricane
winds spiral counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere? How can one predict the
effects of interest rate changes on economies and stock markets? When will radioactive
material be sufﬁciently decayed to enable safe handling? How do warm ocean currents
in the equatorial Paciﬁc affect the climate of eastern North America? How long will
the concentration of a drug in the bloodstream remain at effective levels? How do
radio waves propagate through space? Why does an epidemic spread faster and faster
and then slow down? How can I be sure the bridge I designed won’t be destroyed in a
windstorm?
These and many other questions of interest and importance in our world relate di-
rectly to our ability to analyze motion and how quantities change with respect to time
or each other. Algebra and geometry are useful tools for describing relationships be-
tween static quantities, but they do not involve concepts appropriate for describing how
a quantity changes. For this we need new mathematical operations that go beyond the
algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the taking
of powers and roots. We require operations that measure the way related quantities
change.
Calculus provides the tools for describing motion quantitatively. It introduces
two new operations called differentiation and integration, which, like addition and
subtraction, are opposites of one another; what differentiation does, integration undoes.
For example, consider the motion of a falling rock. The height (in metres) of the
rock t seconds after it is dropped from a height of h0 m is a function h.t/ given by
h.t/ D h0  4:9t2:
The graph of y D h.t/ is shown in the ﬁgure below:
y
t
y D h.t/
h0
The process of differentiation enables us to ﬁnd a new function, which we denote h0.t/
and call the derivative of h with respect to t, which represents the rate of change of the
height of the rock, that is, its velocity in metres/second:
h0.t/ D 9:8t:
Conversely, if we know the velocity of the falling rock as a function of time, integration
enables us to ﬁnd the height function h.t/.
Calculus was invented independently and in somewhat different ways by two seven-
teenth-century mathematicians: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. New-
ton’s motivation was a desire to analyze the motion of moving objects. Using his
calculus, he was able to formulate his laws of motion and gravitation and conclude
from them that the planets must move around the sun in elliptical orbits.

2
Many of the most fundamental and important “laws of nature” are conveniently
expressed as equations involving rates of change of quantities. Such equations are
called differential equations, and techniques for their study and solution are at the
heart of calculus. In the falling rock example, the appropriate law is Newton’s Second
Law of Motion:
force D mass  acceleration:
The acceleration, 9:8 m/s2, is the rate of change (the derivative) of the velocity,
which is in turn the rate of change (the derivative) of the height function.
Much of mathematics is related indirectly to the study of motion. We regard lines,
or curves, as geometric objects, but the ancient Greeks thought of them as paths traced
out by moving points. Nevertheless, the study of curves also involves geometric con-
cepts such as tangency and area. The process of differentiation is closely tied to the
geometric problem of ﬁnding tangent lines; similarly, integration is related to the geo-
metric problem of ﬁnding areas of regions with curved boundaries.
Both differentiation and integration are deﬁned in terms of a new mathematical
operation called a limit. The concept of the limit of a function will be developed in
Chapter 1. That will be the real beginning of our study of calculus. In the chapter called
“Preliminaries” we will review some of the background from algebra and geometry
needed for the development of calculus.

Introduction
This preliminary chapter reviews the most important
things you should know before beginning calculus.
Topics include the real number system; Cartesian coordinates in the plane; equations
representing straight lines, circles, and parabolas; functions and their graphs; and, in
particular, polynomials and trigonometric functions.
Depending on your precalculus background, you may or may not be familiar with
these topics. If you are, you may want to skim over this material to refresh your under-
standing of the terms used; if not, you should study this chapter in detail.
P.1
Real Numbers and the Real Line
Calculus depends on properties of the real number system. Real numbers are numbers
that can be expressed as decimals, for example,
5 D 5:00000 : : :
 3
4 D 0:750000 : : :
1
3 D 0:3333 : : :
p
2 D 1:4142 : : :
 D 3:14159 : : :
In each case the three dots (: : :) indicate that the sequence of decimal digits goes on
forever. For the ﬁrst three numbers above, the patterns of the digits are obvious; we
know what all the subsequent digits are. For

The real numbers can be represented geometrically as points on a number line,
which we call the real line, shown in Figure P.1. The symbol R is used to denote either
the real number system or, equivalently, the real line.

The properties of the real number system fall into three categories: algebraic prop-
erties, order properties, and completeness. You are already familiar with the algebraic
properties; roughly speaking, they assert that real numbers can be added, subtracted,
multiplied, and divided (except by zero) to produce more real numbers and that the
usual rules of arithmetic are valid.

PRELIMINARIES
The order properties of the real numbers refer to the order in which the numbers
appear on the real line. If x lies to the left of y, then we say that “x is less than y” or
“y is greater than x.” These statements are written symbolically as x < y and y > x,
respectively. The inequality x  y means that either x < y or x D y. The order
properties of the real numbers are summarized in the following rules for inequalities:
Rules for inequalities
If a, b, and c are real numbers, then:
The symbol ÷ means
“implies.”
1. a < b
÷
a C c < b C c
2. a < b
÷
a  c < b  c
3. a < b and c > 0
÷
ac < bc
4. a < b and c < 0
÷
ac > bc; in particular, a > b
5. a > 0
÷
1
a > 0
6. 0 < a < b
÷
1
b < 1
a
Rules 1–4 and 6 (for a > 0) also hold if < and > are replaced by  and .
Note especially the rules for multiplying (or dividing) an inequality by a number. If the
number is positive, the inequality is preserved; if the number is negative, the inequality
is reversed.
The completeness property of the real number system is more subtle and difﬁcult
to understand. One way to state it is as follows: if A is any set of real numbers having at
least one number in it, and if there exists a real number y with the property that x  y
for every x in A (such a number y is called an upper bound for A), then there exists a
smallest such number, called the least upper bound or supremum of A, and denoted
sup.A/. Roughly speaking, this says that there can be no holes or gaps on the real
line—every point corresponds to a real number. We will not need to deal much with
completeness in our study of calculus. It is typically used to prove certain important
results—in particular, Theorems 8 and 9 in Chapter 1. (These proofs are given in
Appendix III but are not usually included in elementary calculus courses; they are
studied in more advanced courses in mathematical analysis.) However, when we study
inﬁnite sequences and series in Chapter 9, we will make direct use of completeness.
The set of real numbers has some important special subsets:
(i) the natural numbers or positive integers, namely, the numbers 1; 2; 3; 4; : : :
(ii) the integers, namely, the numbers 0; ˙1; ˙2; ˙3; : : :
(iii) the rational numbers, that is, numbers that can be expressed in the form of a
fraction m=n, where m and n are integers, and n ¤ 0.
The rational numbers are precisely those real numbers with decimal expansions
that are either:
(a) terminating, that is, ending with an inﬁnite string of zeros, for example,
3=4 D 0:750000 : : :, or
(b) repeating, that is, ending with a string of digits that repeats over and over, for ex-
ample, 23=11 D 2:090909 : : : D 2:09. (The bar indicates the pattern of repeating
digits.)
Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational numbers.

(a) Let x D 1:323232 : : :
Then x  1 D 0:323232 : : : and
100x D 132:323232 : : : D 132 C 0:323232 : : : D 132 C x  1:
Therefore, 99x D 131 and x D 131=99.
(b) Let y D 0:3405405405 : : :
Then 10y D 3:405405405 : : :
and

Also,
10; 000y D 3; 405:405405405 : : : D 3; 405 C 10y  3:
Therefore, 9; 990y D 3; 402 and y D 3; 402=9; 990 D 63=185.
The set of rational numbers possesses all the algebraic and order properties of the real
numbers but not the completeness property. There is, for example, no rational number
whose square is 2. Hence, there is a “hole” on the “rational line” where
p
2 should
be.1 Because the real line has no such “holes,” it is the appropriate setting for studying
limits and therefore calculus.
Intervals
A subset of the real line is called an interval if it contains at least two numbers and
also contains all real numbers between any two of its elements. For example, the set of
real numbers x such that x > 6 is an interval, but the set of real numbers y such that
y ¤ 0 is not an interval. (Why?) It consists of two intervals.
If a and b are real numbers and a < b, we often refer to
(i) the open interval from a to b, denoted by .a; b/, consisting of all real numbers x
satisfying a < x < b.
(ii) the closed interval from a to b, denoted by Œa; b
, consisting of all real numbers
x satisfying a  x  b.
(iii) the half-open interval Œa; b/, consisting of all real numbers x satisfying the in-
equalities a  x < b.

These are illustrated in Figure P.2. Note the use of hollow dots to indicate endpoints of
intervals that are not included in the intervals, and solid dots to indicate endpoints that
are included. The endpoints of an interval are also called boundary points.
The intervals in Figure P.2 are ﬁnite intervals; each of them has ﬁnite length ba.
Intervals can also have inﬁnite length, in which case they are called inﬁnite intervals.
Figure P.3 shows some examples of inﬁnite intervals. Note that the whole real line R
is an interval, denoted by .1; 1/. The symbol 1 (“inﬁnity”) does not denote a real
number, so we never allow 1 to belong to an interval.

How do we know that
p
2 is an irrational number? Suppose, to the contrary, that
p
2 is rational. Then
p
2 D m=n, where m and n are integers and n ¤ 0. We can assume that the fraction m=n has been “reduced
to lowest terms”; any common factors have been cancelled out. Now m2=n2 D 2, so m2 D 2n2, which is
an even integer. Hence, m must also be even. (The square of an odd integer is always odd.) Since m is even,
we can write m D 2k, where k is an integer. Thus 4k2 D 2n2 and n2 D 2k2, which is even. Thus n is also
even. This contradicts the assumption that
p
2 could be written as a fraction m=n in lowest terms; m and n
cannot both be even. Accordingly, there can be no rational number whose square is 2.

Sometimes we will need to solve systems of two or more inequalities that must be sat-
isﬁed simultaneously. We still solve the inequalities individually and look for numbers
in the intersection of the solution sets.

(a) Using the technique of Example 2, we can solve the inequality 3  2x C 1 to get
2  2x, so x  1. Similarly, the inequality 2x C 1  5 leads to 2x  4, so x  2.
The solution set of system (a) is therefore the closed interval Œ1; 2.

Solution
(a) The trinomial x2  5x C 6 factors into the product .x  2/.x  3/, which is
negative if and only if exactly one of the factors is negative. Since x  3 < x  2,
this happens when x  3 < 0 and x  2 > 0. Thus we need x < 3 and x > 2; the
solution set is the open interval .2; 3/.
(b) The inequality 2x2C1 > 4x is equivalent to 2x24xC1 > 0. The corresponding

intersection of intervals if it belongs to every one of the intervals. We will use \ to

PRELIMINARIES
The Absolute Value
The absolute value, or magnitude, of a number x, denoted jxj (read “the absolute
value of x”), is deﬁned by the formula
jxj D
n x
if x  0
x
if x < 0
The vertical lines in the symbol jxj are called absolute value bars.
EXAMPLE 6
j3j D 3,
j0j D 0,
j  5j D 5.
Note that jxj  0 for every real number x, and jxj D 0 only if x D 0. People
sometimes ﬁnd it confusing to say that jxj D x when x is negative, but this is correct
since x is positive in that case.
The symbol pa always denotes the nonnegative
It is important to remember that
p

p
a2 D a unless you already
know that a  0.
square root of a, so an alternative deﬁnition of jxj is jxj D
p
x2.
Geometrically, jxj represents the (nonnegative) distance from x to 0 on the real
line. More generally, jx  yj represents the (nonnegative) distance between the points
x and y on the real line, since this distance is the same as that from the point x  y to
0 (see Figure P.6):
jx  yj D
 x  y;
if x  y

if x < y.

The absolute value function has the following properties:
Properties of absolute values
1. j  aj D jaj. A number and its negative have the same absolute value.
2. jabj D jajjbj and
ˇˇˇa
b
ˇˇˇ D jaj
jbj. The absolute value of a product (or quo-
tient) of two numbers is the product (or quotient) of their absolute values.
3. ja ˙ bj  jaj C jbj (the triangle inequality). The absolute value of a
sum of or difference between numbers is less than or equal to the sum of
their absolute values.
The ﬁrst two of these properties can be checked by considering the cases where either
of a or b is either positive or negative. The third property follows from the ﬁrst two
because ˙2ab  j2abj D 2jajjbj. Therefore, we have
ja ˙ bj2 D .a ˙ b/2 D a2 ˙ 2ab C b2
 jaj2 C 2jajjbj C jbj2 D .jaj C jbj/2;
and taking the (positive) square roots of both sides, we obtain ja ˙bj  jajCjbj: This
result is called the “triangle inequality” because it follows from the geometric fact that
the length of any side of a triangle cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other
two sides. For instance, if we regard the points 0, a, and b on the number line as the
vertices of a degenerate “triangle,” then the sides of the triangle have lengths jaj, jbj,
and ja  bj. The triangle is degenerate since all three of its vertices lie on a straight
line.

Equations and Inequalities Involving Absolute Values
The equation jxj D D (where D > 0) has two solutions, x D D and x D D:
the two points on the real line that lie at distance D from the origin. Equations and
inequalities involving absolute values can be solved algebraically by breaking them into
cases according to the deﬁnition of absolute value, but often they can also be solved
geometrically by interpreting absolute values as distances. For example, the inequality
jx  aj < D says that the distance from x to a is less than D, so x must lie between
a  D and a C D. (Or, equivalently, a must lie between x  D and x C D.) If D is a
positive number, then

The equation says that x is equidistant from 1 and 3. Therefore, x is the

equation says that either x C 1 D x  3 or x C 1 D .x  3/. The ﬁrst of these
equations has no solutions; the second has the solution x D 1.

In this calculation we manipulated a system of two inequalities simultaneously, rather
than split it up into separate inequalities as we have done in previous examples. Note
how the various rules for inequalities were used here. Multiplying an inequality by a
negative number reverses the inequality. So does taking reciprocals of an inequality in
which both sides are positive. The given inequality holds for all x in the open interval

ular real lines in the plane intersecting at the 0-point of each. These lines are called
coordinate axes in the plane. Usually (but not always) we call one of these axes the
x-axis and draw it horizontally with numbers x on it increasing to the right; then we
call the other the y-axis, and draw it vertically with numbers y on it increasing upward.
The point of intersection of the coordinate axes (the point where x and y are both zero)
is called the origin and is often denoted by the letter O.
If P is any point in the plane, we can draw a line through P perpendicular to
the x-axis. If a is the value of x where that line intersects the x-axis, we call a the
x-coordinate of P . Similarly, the y-coordinate of P is the value of y where a line
through P perpendicular to the y-axis meets the y-axis. The ordered pair .a; b/ is
called the coordinate pair, or the Cartesian coordinates, of the point P: We refer

to the point as P.a; b/ to indicate both the name P of the point and its coordinates
.a; b/. (See Figure P.8.) Note that the x-coordinate appears ﬁrst in a coordinate pair.
Coordinate pairs are in one-to-one correspondence with points in the plane; each point
has a unique coordinate pair, and each coordinate pair determines a unique point. We
call such a set of coordinate axes and the coordinate pairs they determine a Carte-
sian coordinate system in the plane, after the seventeenth-century philosopher René
Descartes, who created analytic (coordinate) geometry. When equipped with such a
coordinate system, a plane is called a Cartesian plane. Note that we are using the
same notation .a; b/ for the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane as we use for
an open interval on the real line. However, this should not cause any confusion because
the intended meaning will be clear from the context.
Figure P.9 shows the coordinates of some points in the plane. Note that all points
on the x-axis have y-coordinate 0. We usually just write the x-coordinates to label
such points. Similarly, points on the y-axis have x D 0, and we can label such points
using their y-coordinates only.
The coordinate axes divide the plane into four regions called quadrants. These
quadrants are numbered I to IV, as shown in Figure P.10. The ﬁrst quadrant is the
upper right one; both coordinates of any point in that quadrant are positive numbers.

Axis Scales
When we plot data in the coordinate plane or graph formulas whose variables have
different units of measure, we do not need to use the same scale on the two axes. If, for
example, we plot height versus time for a falling rock, there is no reason to place the
mark that shows 1 m on the height axis the same distance from the origin as the mark
that shows 1 s on the time axis.
When we graph functions whose variables do not represent physical measure-
ments and when we draw ﬁgures in the coordinate plane to study their geometry or

12
PRELIMINARIES
trigonometry, we usually make the scales identical. A vertical unit of distance then
looks the same as a horizontal unit. As on a surveyor’s map or a scale drawing, line
segments that are supposed to have the same length will look as if they do, and angles
that are supposed to be equal will look equal. Some of the geometric results we obtain
later, such as the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines, are valid only
if equal scales are used on the two axes.
Computer and calculator displays are another matter. The vertical and horizontal
scales on machine-generated graphs usually differ, with resulting distortions in dis-
tances, slopes, and angles. Circles may appear elliptical, and squares may appear
rectangular or even as parallelograms. Right angles may appear as acute or obtuse.
Circumstances like these require us to take extra care in interpreting what we see.
High-quality computer software for drawing Cartesian graphs usually allows the user
to compensate for such scale problems by adjusting the aspect ratio (the ratio of verti-
cal to horizontal scale). Some computer screens also allow adjustment within a narrow
range. When using graphing software, try to adjust your particular software/hardware
conﬁguration so that the horizontal and vertical diameters of a drawn circle appear to
be equal.
Increments and Distances
When a particle moves from one point to another, the net changes in its coordinates are
called increments. They are calculated by subtracting the coordinates of the starting
point from the coordinates of the ending point. An increment in a variable is the net
change in the value of the variable. If x changes from x1 to x2, then the increment in
x is x D x2  x1. (Here  is the upper case Greek letter delta.)
EXAMPLE 1

If P.x1; y1/ and Q.x2; y2/ are two points in the plane, the straight line segment PQ
is the hypotenuse of a right triangle P CQ, as shown in Figure P.12. The sides P C and
CQ of the triangle have lengths
jxj D jx2  x1j
and
jyj D jy2  y1j:
These are the horizontal distance and vertical distance between P and Q. By the
Pythagorean Theorem, the length of PQ is the square root of the sum of the squares
of these lengths.

Given two points P1.x1; y1/ and P2.x2; y2/ in the plane, we call the increments x D

Two such points always determine a unique straight line (usually called simply a line)
passing through them both. We call the line P1P2.
Any nonvertical line in the plane has the property that the ratio

x D y2  y1

nonvertical line.

The slope tells us the direction and steepness of a line. A line with positive slope rises
uphill to the right; one with negative slope falls downhill to the right. The greater the
absolute value of the slope, the steeper the rise or fall. Since the run x is zero for a
vertical line, we cannot form the ratio m; the slope of a vertical line is undeﬁned.
The direction of a line can also be measured by an angle. The inclination of a line
is the smallest counterclockwise angle from the positive direction of the x-axis to the
line. In Figure P.16 the angle  (the Greek letter “phi”) is the inclination of the line L.
The inclination  of any line satisﬁes 0ı   < 180ı. The inclination of a horizontal
line is 0ı and that of a vertical line is 90ı.

the slope m of a nonvertical line and its inclination  is shown in Figure P.16:
m D y
x D tan :
(The trigonometric function tan is deﬁned in Section P.7.)
Parallel lines have the same inclination. If they are not vertical, they must therefore
have the same slope. Conversely, lines with equal slopes have the same inclination and
so are parallel.
If two nonvertical lines, L1 and L2, are perpendicular, their slopes m1 and m2
satisfy m1m2 D 1; so each slope is the negative reciprocal of the other:
m1 D  1

m2 D  1

Equations of Lines
Straight lines are particularly simple graphs, and their corresponding equations are
also simple. All points on the vertical line through the point a on the x-axis have their
x-coordinates equal to a. Thus x D a is the equation of the line. Similarly, y D b is
the equation of the horizontal line meeting the y-axis at b.

To write an equation for a nonvertical straight line L, it is enough to know its slope m
and the coordinates of one point P1.x1; y1/ on it. If P.x; y/ is any other point on L,
then

y D mx C b:

PRELIMINARIES
A line with slope m and x-intercept a passes through .a; 0/, and so its equation is

The equation y D mx C b is called the slope–y-intercept equation of the
line with slope m and y-intercept b.
The equation y D m.x  a/ is called the slope–x-intercept equation of the
line with slope m and x-intercept a.

Comparing this with the general form y D mx C b of the slope–y-intercept equation,
we see that the slope of the line is m D 8=5, and the y-intercept is b D 4. To ﬁnd
the x-intercept, put y D 0 and solve for x, obtaining 8x D 20, or x D 5=2. The
x-intercept is a D 5=2.
The equation Ax C By D C (where A and B are not both zero) is called the general
linear equation in x and y because its graph always represents a straight line, and
every line has an equation in this form.
Many important quantities are related by linear equations. Once we know that
a relationship between two variables is linear, we can ﬁnd it from any two pairs of
corresponding values, just as we ﬁnd the equation of a line from the coordinates of two
points.
EXAMPLE 12
The relationship between Fahrenheit temperature (F ) and Celsius
temperature (C) is given by a linear equation of the form F D
mC C b. The freezing point of water is F D 32ı or C D 0ı, while the boiling point
is F D 212ı or C D 100ı. Thus,

To identify the graph, we complete the squares on the left side of the equation. Since
x2 C 2ax are the ﬁrst two terms of the square .x C a/2 D x2 C 2ax C a2, we add
a2 to both sides to complete the square of the x terms. (Note that a2 is the square of
half the coefﬁcient of x.) Similarly, add b2 to both sides to complete the square of the

Equations of Parabolas
A parabola is a plane curve whose points are equidistant from a ﬁxed point
F and a ﬁxed straight line L that does not pass through F . The point F is the
focus of the parabola; the line L is the parabola’s directrix. The line through
F perpendicular to L is the parabola’s axis. The point V where the axis meets
the parabola is the parabola’s vertex.
Observe that the vertex V of a parabola is halfway between the focus F and the point
on the directrix L that is closest to F . If the directrix is either horizontal or vertical, and
the vertex is at the origin, then the parabola will have a particularly simple equation.
EXAMPLE 5
Find an equation of the parabola having the point F.0; p/ as focus
and the line L with equation y D p as directrix.
Solution
If P.x; y/ is any point on the parabola, then (see Figure P.24) the distances
from P to F and to (the closest point Q on) the line L are given by

(called standard forms):
Figure P.24 shows the situation for p > 0; the parabola opens upward and is symmetric
about its axis, the y-axis. If p < 0, the focus .0; p/ will lie below the origin and
the directrix y D p will lie above the origin. In this case the parabola will open
downward instead of upward.

PRELIMINARIES
EXAMPLE 7
Find the focus and directrix of the parabola y D x2.
Solution
The given equation matches the standard form y D x2=.4p/ provided
4p D 1. Thus p D 1=4. The focus is .0; 1=4/, and the directrix is the line
y D 1=4.
Interchanging the roles of x and y in the derivation of the standard equation above
shows that the equation
y2 D 4px
or
x D y2
4p
(standard equation)
represents a parabola with focus at .p; 0/ and vertical directrix x D p. The axis is
the x-axis.
Reﬂective Properties of Parabolas
One of the chief applications of parabolas is their use as reﬂectors of light and radio
waves. Rays originating from the focus of a parabola will be reﬂected in a beam parallel
to the axis, as shown in Figure P.26. Similarly, all the rays in a beam striking a parabola
parallel to its axis will reﬂect through the focus. This property is the reason why
telescopes and spotlights use parabolic mirrors and radio telescopes and microwave
antennas are parabolic in shape. We will examine this property of parabolas more
carefully in Section 8.1.

Scaling a Graph
The graph of an equation can be compressed or expanded horizontally by replacing x
with a multiple of x. If a is a positive number, replacing x with ax in an equation
multiplies horizontal distances in the graph of the equation by a factor 1=a. (See
Figure P.27.) Replacing y with ay will multiply vertical distances in a similar way.
You may ﬁnd it surprising that, like circles, all parabolas are similar geometric
ﬁgures; they may have different sizes, but they all have the same shape. We can change
the size while preserving the shape of a curve represented by an equation in x and y by
scaling both the coordinates by the same amount. If we scale the equation 4py D x2
by replacing x and y with 4px and 4py, respectively, we get 4p.4py/ D .4px/2, or
y D x2. Thus, the general parabola 4py D x2 has the same shape as the speciﬁc

Shifting a Graph
The graph of an equation (or inequality) can be shifted c units horizontally by replacing
x with x  c or vertically by replacing y with y  c.
Shifts
To shift a graph c units to the right, replace x in its equation or inequality
with x  c. (If c < 0, the shift will be to the left.)
To shift a graph c units upward, replace y in its equation or inequality with
y  c. (If c < 0, the shift will be downward.)

correspond to replacing x with x  h and y with y  k.
The graph of y D ax2 C bx C c is a parabola whose axis is parallel to the y-axis. The
parabola opens upward if a > 0 and downward if a < 0. We can complete the square
and write the equation in the form y D a.x  h/2 C k to ﬁnd the vertex .h; k/.
EXAMPLE 11
Describe the graph of y D x2  4x C 3.

The equation y D x2  4x C 3 represents a parabola, opening upward. To

Ellipses and Hyperbolas
If a and b are positive numbers, the equation
x2
a2 C y2
b2 D 1
represents a curve called an ellipse that lies wholly within the rectangle a  x  a,
b  y  b. (Why?) If a D b, the ellipse is just the circle of radius a centred at the
origin. If a ¤ b, the ellipse is a circle that has been squashed by scaling it by different
amounts in the two coordinate directions.

22
PRELIMINARIES
The ellipse has centre at the origin, and it passes through the four points .a; 0/,
.0; b/, .a; 0/, and .0; b/. (See Figure P.31.) The line segments from .a; 0/ to
.a; 0/ and from .0; b/ to .0; b/ are called the principal axes of the ellipse; the longer
of the two is the major axis, and the shorter is the minor axis.

Functions and Their Graphs
The area of a circle depends on its radius. The temperature at which water boils de-
pends on the altitude above sea level. The interest paid on a cash investment depends
on the length of time for which the investment is made.
Whenever one quantity depends on another quantity, we say that the former quan-
tity is a function of the latter. For instance, the area A of a circle depends on the radius
r according to the formula
A D r2;

24
PRELIMINARIES
so we say that the area is a function of the radius. The formula is a rule that tells us
how to calculate a unique (single) output value of the area A for each possible input
value of the radius r.
The set of all possible input values for the radius is called the domain of the
function. The set of all output values of the area is the range of the function. Since
circles cannot have negative radii or areas, the domain and range of the circular area
function are both the interval Œ0; 1/ consisting of all nonnegative real numbers.
The domain and range of a mathematical function can be any sets of objects;
they do not have to consist of numbers. Throughout much of this book, however, the
domains and ranges of functions we consider will be sets of real numbers.
In calculus we often want to refer to a generic function without having any partic-
ular formula in mind. To denote that y is a function of x we write
y D f .x/;
which we read as “y equals f of x.” In this notation, due to the eighteenth-century
mathematician Leonhard Euler, the function is represented by the symbol f: Also,
x, called the independent variable, represents an input value from the domain of f;
and y, the dependent variable, represents the corresponding output value f .x/ in the
range of f:
DEFINITION
1
A function f on a set D into a set S is a rule that assigns a unique element
f .x/ in S to each element x in D.
In this deﬁnition D D D.f / (read “D of f ”) is the domain of the function f: The
range R.f / of f is the subset of S consisting of all values f .x/ of the function. Think
of a function f as a kind of machine (Figure P.35) that produces an output value f .x/
in its range whenever we feed it an input value x from its domain.
There are several ways to represent a function symbolically. The squaring function
that converts any input real number x into its square x2 can be denoted:
(a) by a formula such as y D x2, which uses a dependent variable y to denote the
value of the function;
(b) by a formula such as f .x/ D x2, which deﬁnes a function symbol f to name the
function; or
f .x/
Range R.f /
x
Domain D.f /
f
Figure P.35
A function machine
(c) by a mapping rule such as x  x2. (Read this as “x goes to x2.”)
In this book we will usually use either (a) or (b) to deﬁne functions. Strictly speaking,
we should call a function f and not f .x/, since the latter denotes the value of the func-
tion at the point x. However, as is common usage, we will often refer to the function
as f .x/ in order to name the variable on which f depends. Sometimes it is convenient
to use the same letter to denote both a dependent variable and a function symbol; the
circular area function can be written A D f .r/ D r2 or as A D A.r/ D r2. In
the latter case we are using A to denote both the dependent variable and the name of
the function.
EXAMPLE 1
The volume of a ball of radius r is given by the function
V.r/ D 4
3 r3
for r  0. Thus the volume of a ball of radius 3 ft is
V.3/ D 4
3 .3/3 D 36 ft3:
Note how the variable r is replaced by the special value 3 in the formula deﬁning the
function to obtain the value of the function at r D 3.

EXAMPLE 2
A function F is deﬁned for all real numbers t by
F.t/ D 2t C 3:
Find the output values of F that correspond to the input values 0, 2, x C 2, and F.2/.
Solution
In each case we substitute the given input for t in the deﬁnition of F :
F.0/ D 2.0/ C 3 D 0 C 3 D 3
F.2/ D 2.2/ C 3 D 4 C 3 D 7
F.x C 2/ D 2.x C 2/ C 3 D 2x C 7
F.F.2// D F.7/ D 2.7/ C 3 D 17:
The Domain Convention
A function is not properly deﬁned until its domain is speciﬁed. For instance, the func-
tion f .x/ D x2 deﬁned for all real numbers x  0 is different from the function
g.x/ D x2 deﬁned for all real x because they have different domains, even though
they have the same values at every point where both are deﬁned. In Chapters 1–9 we
will be dealing with real functions (functions whose input and output values are real
numbers). When the domain of such a function is not speciﬁed explicitly, we will as-
sume that the domain is the largest set of real numbers to which the function assigns
real values. Thus, if we talk about the function x2 without specifying a domain, we
mean the function g.x/ above.
The domain convention
When a function f is deﬁned without specifying its domain, we assume that
the domain consists of all real numbers x for which the value f .x/ of the
function is a real number.
In practice, it is often easy to determine the domain of a function f .x/ given by an
explicit formula. We just have to exclude those values of x that would result in dividing
by 0 or taking even roots of negative numbers.
EXAMPLE 3
The square root function. The domain of f .x/ D px is the
interval Œ0; 1/, since negative numbers do not have real square
roots. We have f .0/ D 0, f .4/ D 2, f .10/  3:16228. Note that, although there are
two numbers whose square is 4, namely, 2 and 2, only one of these numbers, 2, is the
square root of 4. (Remember that a function assigns a unique value to each element in
its domain; it cannot assign two different values to the same input.) The square root
function px always denotes the nonnegative square root of x. The two solutions of
the equation x2 D 4 are x D
p
4 D 2 and x D 
p
4 D 2.
EXAMPLE 4
The domain of the function h.x/ D
x
x2  4 consists of all real
numbers except x D 2 and x D 2. Expressed in terms of inter-
vals,
D.h/ D .1; 2/ [ .2; 2/ [ .2; 1/:
Most of the functions we encounter will have domains that are either intervals or unions
of intervals.

26
PRELIMINARIES
EXAMPLE 5
The domain of S.t/ D
p
1  t2 consists of all real numbers t for
which 1  t2  0. Thus we require that t2  1, or 1  t  1.
The domain is the closed interval Œ1; 1.
Graphs of Functions
An old maxim states that “a picture is worth a thousand words.” This is certainly true
in mathematics; the behaviour of a function is best described by drawing its graph.
The graph of a function f is just the graph of the equation y D f .x/. It consists
of those points in the Cartesian plane whose coordinates .x; y/ are pairs of input–
output values for f: Thus .x; y/ lies on the graph of f provided x is in the domain of
f and y D f .x/.
Drawing the graph of a function f sometimes involves making a table of coor-
dinate pairs .x; f .x// for various values of x in the domain of f, then plotting these
points and connecting them with a “smooth curve.”

How do we know the graph is smooth and doesn’t do weird things between the
points we have calculated, for example, as shown in Figure P.36(b)? We could, of
course, plot more points, spaced more closely together, but how do we know how the
graph behaves between the points we have plotted? In Chapter 4, calculus will provide
useful tools for answering these questions.
Some functions occur often enough in applications that you should be familiar
with their graphs. Some of these are shown in Figures P.37–P.46. Study them for a
while; they are worth remembering. Note, in particular, the graph of the absolute
value function, f .x/ D jxj, shown in Figure P.46. It is made up of the two half-lines
y D x for x < 0 and y D x for x  0.
If you know the effects of vertical and horizontal shifts on the equations repre-
senting graphs (see Section P.3), you can easily sketch some graphs that are shifted
versions of the ones in Figures P.37–P.46.

EXAMPLE 8
Sketch the graph of the function f .x/ D 2  x
x  1.
Solution
It is not immediately obvious that this graph is a shifted version of a known
graph. To see that it is, we can divide x  1 into 2  x to get a quotient of 1 and a
remainder of 1:
2  x
x  1 D x C 1 C 1
x  1
D .x  1/ C 1

Thus, the graph is that of 1=x from Figure P.43 shifted to the right 1 unit and down 1
unit. See Figure P.48.
Not every curve you can draw is the graph of a function. A function f can have
only one value f .x/ for each x in its domain, so no vertical line can intersect the
graph of a function at more than one point. If a is in the domain of function f, then
the vertical line x D a will intersect the graph of f at the single point .a; f .a//. The
circle x2Cy2 D 1 in Figure P.49 cannot be the graph of a function since some vertical
lines intersect it twice. It is, however, the union of the graphs of two functions, namely,

which are, respectively, the upper and lower halves (semicircles) of the given circle.
Even and Odd Functions; Symmetry and Reﬂections
It often happens that the graph of a function will have certain kinds of symmetry. The
simplest kinds of symmetry relate the values of a function at x and x.
DEFINITION
2
Even and odd functions
Suppose that x belongs to the domain of f whenever x does. We say that
f is an even function if
f .x/ D f .x/
for every x in the domain of f:
We say that f is an odd function if
f .x/ D f .x/
for every x in the domain of f:
The names even and odd come from the fact that even powers such as x0 D 1, x2, x4,
: : : , x2, x4, : : : are even functions, and odd powers such as x1 D x, x3, : : : , x1,
x3, : : : are odd functions. For example, .x/4 D x4 and .x/3 D x3.
Since .x/2 D x2, any function that depends only on x2 is even. For instance,
the absolute value function y D jxj D
p
x2 is even.
The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis. A horizontal straight
line drawn from a point on the graph to the y-axis and continued an equal distance on
the other side of the y-axis comes to another point on the graph. (See Figure P.50(a).)
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin. A straight line drawn
from a point on the graph to the origin will, if continued an equal distance on the other
side of the origin, come to another point on the graph. If an odd function f is deﬁned
at x D 0, then its value must be zero there: f .0/ D 0. (See Figure P.50(b).)
If f .x/ is even (or odd), then so is any constant multiple of f .x/, such as 2f .x/
or 5f .x/. Sums and differences of even (or odd) functions are even (or odd). For
example, f .x/ D 3x45x21 is even, since it is the sum of three even functions: 3x4,
5x2, and 1 D x0. Similarly, 4x3  .2=x/ is odd. The function g.x/ D x2  2x
is the sum of an even function and an odd function and is itself neither even nor odd.

Other kinds of symmetry are also possible. For example, consider the function
g.x/ D x2  2x, which can be written in the form g.x/ D .x  1/2  1. This shows
that the values of g.1 ˙ u/ are equal, so the graph (Figure P.51(a)) is symmetric about
the vertical line x D 1; it is the parabola y D x2 shifted 1 unit to the right and 1
unit down. Similarly, the graph of h.x/ D x3 C 1 is symmetric about the point .0; 1/
(Figure P.51(b)).

Reﬂections in Straight Lines
The image of an object reﬂected in a plane mirror appears to be as far behind the mirror
as the object is in front of it. Thus, the mirror bisects at right angles the line from a
point in the object to the corresponding point in the image. Given a line L and a point
P not on L, we call a point Q the reﬂection, or the mirror image, of P in L if L is
the right bisector of the line segment PQ. The reﬂection of any graph G in L is the
graph consisting of the reﬂections of all the points of G.
Some reﬂections of graphs are easily described in terms of the equations of the
graphs:
Reﬂections in special lines
1. Substituting x in place of x in an equation in x and y corresponds to
reﬂecting the graph of the equation in the y-axis.
2. Substituting y in place of y in an equation in x and y corresponds to
reﬂecting the graph of the equation in the x-axis.
3. Substituting a  x in place of x in an equation in x and y corresponds to
reﬂecting the graph of the equation in the line x D a=2.
4. Substituting b  y in place of y in an equation in x and y corresponds to
reﬂecting the graph of the equation in the line y D b=2.
5. Interchanging x and y in an equation in x and y corresponds to reﬂecting
the graph of the equation in the line y D x.

EXAMPLE 10
Express the equation of the red graph in Figure P.52(b) in terms of
the absolute value function jxj.
Solution
We can get the red graph by ﬁrst reﬂecting the graph of jxj (black in
Figure P.52(b)) in the x-axis to get the blue graph and then shifting that reﬂection
left 3 units to get the green graph, and then shifting that graph up 2 units. The reﬂec-
tion of y D jxj in the x-axis has equation y D jxj, or y D jxj. Shifting this left 3
units gives y D jx C 3j. Finally, shifting up 2 units gives y D 2  jx C 3j, which is
the desired equation.
Deﬁning and Graphing Functions with Maple
Many of the calculations and graphs encountered in studying calculus can be produced
using a computer algebra system such as Maple or Mathematica. Here and there,
throughout this book, we will include examples illustrating how to get Maple to per-
form such tasks. (The examples were done with Maple 10, but most of them will work
with earlier or later versions of Maple as well.)
We begin with an example showing how to deﬁne a function in Maple and then
plot its graph. We show in magenta the input you type into Maple and in cyan Maple’s
response. Let us deﬁne the function f .x/ D x3  2x2  12x C 1.
>
f := x -> x^3-2*x^2-12*x+1; <enter>
f WD x  x3  2x2  12x C 1
Note the use of := to indicate the symbol to the left is being deﬁned and the use of ->
to indicate the rule for the construction of f .x/ from x. Also note that Maple uses the
asterisk * to indicate multiplication and the caret ^ to indicate an exponent. A Maple
instruction should end with a semicolon ; (or a colon : if no output is desired) before
the Enter key is pressed. Hereafter we will not show the <enter> in our input.
We can now use f as an ordinary function:
>
f(t)+f(1);
t3  2t2  12t  11
The following command results in a plot of the graph of f on the interval Œ4; 5
shown in Figure P.53.
>
plot(f(x), x=-4..5);
We could have speciﬁed the expression x^3-2*x^2-12*x+1 directly in the plot
command instead of ﬁrst deﬁning the function f .x/. Note the use of two dots .. to
separate the left and right endpoints of the plot interval. Other options can be included

SECTION P.4:
Functions and Their Graphs
31
in the plot command; all such options are separated with commas. You can specify the
range of values of y in addition to that for x (which is required), and you can specify
scaling=CONSTRAINED if you want equal unit distances on both axes. (This would
be a bad idea for the graph of our f .x/. Why?)

When using a graphing calculator or computer graphing software, things can go hor-
ribly wrong in some circumstances. The following example illustrates the catastrophic
effects that round-off error can have.
EXAMPLE 11
Consider the function g.x/ D j1 C xj  1

.
If x > 1, then j1 C xj D 1 C x, so the formula for g.x/ simpliﬁes to g.x/ D
.1 C x/  1
x
D x
x D 1, at least provided x ¤ 0. Thus the graph of g on an interval
lying to the right of x D 1 should be the horizontal line y D 1, possibly with a hole
in it at x D 0. The Maple commands
>
g := x -> (abs(1+x)-1)/x: plot(g(x), x=-0.5..0.5);
lead, as expected, to the graph in Figure P.54. But plotting the same function on a very
tiny interval near x D 0 leads to quite a different graph. The command
>
plot([g(x),1],x=-7*10^(-16)..5*10^(-16),
style=[point,line],numpoints=4000);
produces the graph in Figure P.55.

The graphs of y D g.x/ (colour) and y D 1 (black) on the

The coloured arcs and short line through the origin are the graph of y D g.x/ plotted
as 4,000 individual points over the interval from 7  1016 to 5  1016. For com-
parison sake, the black horizontal line y D 1 is also plotted. What makes the graph
of g so strange on this interval is the fact that Maple can only represent ﬁnitely many
real numbers in its ﬁnite memory. If the number x is too close to zero, Maple cannot
tell the difference between 1 C x and 1, so it calculates 1  1 D 0 for the numerator
and uses g.x/ D 0 in the plot. This seems to happen between about 0:5  1016 and

32
PRELIMINARIES
0:8  1016 (the coloured horizontal line). As we move further away from the origin,
Maple can tell the difference between 1Cx and 1, but loses most of the signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ures in the representation of x when it adds 1, and these remain lost when it subtracts
1 again. Thus the numerator remains constant over short intervals while the denomi-
nator increases as x moves away from 0. In those intervals the fraction behaves like
constant/x, so the arcs are hyperbolas, sloping downward away from the origin. The
effect diminishes the farther x moves away from 0, as more of its signiﬁcant ﬁgures
are retained by Maple. It should be noted that the reason we used the absolute value
of 1 C x instead of just 1 C x is that this forced Maple to add the x to the 1 before
subtracting the second 1. (If we had used .1Cx/1 as the numerator for g.x/, Maple
would have simpliﬁed it algebraically and obtained g.x/ D 1 before using any values
of x for plotting.)
In later chapters we will encounter more such strange behaviour (which we call
numerical monsters and denote by the symbol K) in the context of calculator and
computer calculations with ﬂoating point (i.e., real) numbers. They are a necessary
consequence of the limitations of such hardware and software and are not restricted
to Maple, though they may show up somewhat differently with other software. It is
necessary to be aware of how calculators and computers do arithmetic in order to be
able to use them effectively without falling into errors that you do not recognize as
such.
One ﬁnal comment about Figure P.55: the graph of y D g.x/ was plotted as
individual points, rather than a line, as was y D 1, in order to make the jumps between
consecutive arcs more obvious. Had we omitted the style=[point,line] option
in the plot command, the default line style would have been used for both graphs and
the arcs in the graph of g would have been connected with vertical line segments. Note
how the command called for the plotting of two different functions by listing them
within square brackets, and how the corresponding styles were correspondingly listed.

Combining Functions to Make New Functions
Functions can be combined in a variety of ways to produce new functions. We begin
by examining algebraic means of combining functions, that is, addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.
Sums, Differences, Products, Quotients, and Multiples
Like numbers, functions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided (except
where the denominator is zero) to produce new functions.
DEFINITION

If f and g are functions, then for every x that belongs to the domains of both

Composite Functions
There is another method, called composition, by which two functions can be combined
to form a new function.
DEFINITION

Composite functions
If f and g are two functions, the composite function f ı g is deﬁned by
f ı g.x/ D f .g.x//:
The domain of f ıg consists of those numbers x in the domain of g for which
g.x/ is in the domain of f: In particular, if the range of g is contained in the
domain of f, then the domain of f ı g is just the domain of g.
As shown in Figure P.60, forming f ıg is equivalent to arranging “function machines”

In calculating f ı g.x/ D f .g.x//, we ﬁrst calculate g.x/ and then calculate f
of the result. We call g the inner function and f the outer function of the composition.
We can, of course, also calculate the composition g ı f .x/ D g.f .x//, where f is
the inner function, the one that gets calculated ﬁrst, and g is the outer function, which
gets calculated last. The functions f ı g and g ı f are usually quite different, as the
following example shows.

To see why, for example, the domain of f ı g is Œ1; 1/, observe that g.x/ D x C 1

Because the resulting function, x, is deﬁned for all real x, we might be tempted to say
that the domain of G ı G is R. This is wrong! To belong to the domain of G ı G, x
must satisfy two conditions:
(i) x must belong to the domain of G, and

36
PRELIMINARIES
(ii) G.x/ must belong to the domain of G.
The domain of G consists of all real numbers except x D 1. If we exclude x D 1
from the domain of GıG, condition (i) will be satisﬁed. Now observe that the equation
G.x/ D 1 has no solution x, since it can be rewritten in the form 1  x D .1 C x/,
or 1 D 1. Therefore, all numbers G.x/ belong to the domain of G, and condition
(ii) is satisﬁed with no further restrictions on x. The domain of G ı G is .1; 1/ [
.1; 1/, that is, all real numbers except 1.
Piecewise Deﬁned Functions
Sometimes it is necessary to deﬁne a function by using different formulas on different
parts of its domain. One example is the absolute value function
jxj D
n x
if x  0
x
if x < 0.
Another would be the tax rates applied to various levels of income. Here are some
other examples. (Note how we use solid and hollow dots in the graphs to indicate,
respectively, which endpoints do or do not lie on various parts of the graph.)

For instance, if t represents time, the function 6H.t/ can model the voltage applied

The name signum is the Latin word meaning “sign.” The value of the sgn.x/ tells
whether x is positive or negative. Since 0 is neither positive nor negative, sgn .0/ is
not deﬁned. The signum function is an odd function.

Find a formula for function g.x/ graphed in Figure P.63(b).
Solution
The graph consists of parts of three lines. For the part x < 1, the line has
slope 1 and x-intercept 2, so its equation is y D .x C 2/. The middle section is
the line y D x for 1  x  2. The right section is y D 2 for x > 2. Combining
these formulas, we write

if x > 2.
Unlike the previous example, it does not matter here which of the two possible formulas
we use to deﬁne g.1/, since both give the same value. The same is true for g.2/.
The following two functions could be deﬁned by different formulas on every interval
between consecutive integers, but we will use an easier way to deﬁne them.

the greatest integer function, or the integer ﬂoor function. It is denoted bxc, or, in

P.6
Polynomials and Rational Functions
Among the easiest functions to deal with in calculus are polynomials. These are sums
of terms each of which is a constant multiple of a nonnegative integer power of the
variable of the function.
DEFINITION
5
A polynomial is a function P whose value at x is
P.x/ D anxn C an1xn1 C    C a2x2 C a1x C a0;
where an; an1; : : : ; a2; a1, and a0, called the coefﬁcients of the polynomial,
are constants and, if n > 0, then an ¤ 0. The number n, the degree of the
highest power of x in the polynomial, is called the degree of the polynomial.
(The degree of the zero polynomial is not deﬁned.)
For example,
3
is a polynomial of degree 0:
2  x
is a polynomial of degree 1:
2x3  17x C 1
is a polynomial of degree 3:
Generally, we assume that the polynomials we deal with are real polynomials; that is,
their coefﬁcients are real numbers rather than more general complex numbers. Often
the coefﬁcients will be integers or rational numbers. Polynomials play a role in the
study of functions somewhat analogous to the role played by integers in the study of
numbers. For instance, just as we always get an integer result if we add, subtract, or
multiply two integers, we always get a polynomial result if we add, subtract, or multiply
two polynomials. Adding or subtracting polynomials produces a polynomial whose de-
gree does not exceed the larger of the two degrees of the polynomials being combined.
Multiplying two polynomials of degrees m and n produces a product polynomial of
degree m C n. For instance, for the product
.x2 C 1/.x3  x  2/ D x5  2x2  x  2;
the two factors have degrees 2 and 3, so the result has degree 5.
The following deﬁnition is analogous to the deﬁnition of a rational number as the
quotient of two integers.

40
PRELIMINARIES
DEFINITION
6
If P.x/ and Q.x/ are two polynomials and Q.x/ is not the zero polynomial,
then the function
R.x/ D P.x/
Q.x/
is called a rational function. By the domain convention, the domain of R.x/
consists of all real numbers x except those for which Q.x/ D 0.
Two examples of rational functions and their domains are
R.x/ D 2x3  3x2 C 3x C 4
x2 C 1
with domain R, all real numbers.
S.x/ D
1
x2  4
with domain all real numbers except ˙2:
Remark
If the numerator and denominator of a rational function have a common
factor, that factor can be cancelled out just as with integers. However, the resulting
simpler rational function may not have the same domain as the original one, so it should
be regarded as a different rational function even though it is equal to the original one
at all points of the original domain. For instance,
x2  x
x2  1 D
x.x  1/
.x C 1/.x  1/ D
x
x C 1
only if x ¤ ˙1,
even though x D 1 is in the domain of x=.x C 1/.
When we divide a positive integer a by a smaller positive integer b, we can obtain
an integer quotient q and an integer remainder r satisfying 0  r < b and hence write
the fraction a=b (in a unique way) as the sum of the integer q and another fraction
whose numerator (the remainder r) is smaller than its denominator b. For instance,
7
3 D 2 C 1
3I
the quotient is 2, the remainder is 1.
Similarly, if Am and Bn are polynomials having degrees m and n, respectively, and if
m > n, then we can express the rational function Am=Bn (in a unique way) as the sum
of a quotient polynomial Qmn of degree m  n and another rational function Rk=Bn
where the numerator polynomial Rk (the remainder in the division) is either zero or
has degree k < n:

Roots, Zeros, and Factors
A number r is called a root or zero of the polynomial P if P.r/ D 0. For example,
P.x/ D x3  4x has three roots: 0, 2, and 2; substituting any of these numbers
for x makes P.x/ D 0. In this context the terms “root” and “zero” are often used
interchangeably. It is technically more correct to call a number r satisfying P.r/ D 0 a
zero of the polynomial function P and a root of the equation P.x/ D 0, and later in this
book we will follow this convention more closely. But for now, to avoid confusion with
the number zero, we will prefer to use “root” rather than “zero” even when referring to
the polynomial P rather than the equation P.x/ D 0.
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (see Appendix II) states that every poly-
nomial of degree at least 1 has a root (although the root might be a complex num-
ber). For example, the linear (degree 1) polynomial ax C b has the root b=a since
a.b=a/ C b D 0. A constant polynomial (one of degree zero) cannot have any roots
unless it is the zero polynomial, in which case every number is a root.
Real polynomials do not always have real roots; the polynomial x2C4 is never zero
for any real number x, but it is zero if x is either of the two complex numbers 2i and
2i, where i is the so-called imaginary unit satisfying i2 D 1. (See Appendix I for
a discussion of complex numbers.) The numbers 2i and 2i are complex conjugates
of each other. Any complex roots of a real polynomial must occur in conjugate pairs.
(See Appendix II for a proof of this fact.)
In our study of calculus we will often ﬁnd it useful to factor polynomials into
products of polynomials of lower degree, especially degree 1 or 2 (linear or quadratic
polynomials). The following theorem shows the connection between linear factors and
roots.
T H E O R E M

The Factor Theorem
The number r is a root of the polynomial P of degree not less than 1 if and only if
x  r is a factor of P.x/.
PROOF
By the division algorithm there exists a quotient polynomial Q having degree
one less than that of P and a remainder polynomial of degree 0 (i.e., a constant c) such
that
P.x/
x  r D Q.x/ C
c
x  r :

42
PRELIMINARIES
Thus P.x/ D .x  r/Q.x/ C c, and P.r/ D 0 if and only if c D 0, in which case
P.x/ D .x  r/Q.x/ and x  r is a factor of P.x/.
It follows from Theorem 1 and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that every
polynomial of degree n  1 has n roots. (If P has degree n  2, then P has a zero
r and P.x/ D .x  r/Q.x/, where Q is a polynomial of degree n  1  1, which in
turn has a root, etc.) Of course, the roots of a polynomial need not all be different. The
4th-degree polynomial P.x/ D x4  3x3 C 3x2  x D x.x  1/3 has four roots; one
is 0 and the other three are each equal to 1. We say that the root 1 has multiplicity 3
because we can divide P.x/ by .x  1/3 and still get zero remainder.
If P is a real polynomial having a complex root r1 D uCiv, where u and v are real
and v ¤ 0, then, as asserted above, the complex conjugate of r1, namely, r2 D u  iv,
will also be a root of P . (Moreover, r1 and r2 will have the same multiplicity.) Thus,
both x  u  iv and x  u C iv are factors of P.x/, and so, therefore, is their product
.x  u  iv/.x  u C iv/ D .x  u/2 C v2 D x2  2ux C u2 C v2;
which is a quadratic polynomial having no real roots. It follows that every real poly-
nomial can be factored into a product of real (possibly repeated) linear factors and real
(also possibly repeated) quadratic factors having no real zeros.
EXAMPLE 2
What is the degree of P.x/ D x3.x2 C 2x C 5/2? What are the
roots of P; and what is the multiplicity of each root?
Solution
If P is expanded, the highest power of x present in the expansion is x3.x2/2 D
x7, so P has degree 7. The factor x3 D .x  0/3 indicates that 0 is a root of P having
multiplicity 3. The remaining four roots will be the two roots of x2 C 2x C 5, each
having multiplicity 2. Now

Hence the seven roots of P are:

1  2i; 1  2i
1  2i has multiplicity 2,
1 C 2i; 1 C 2i

(a) If D > 0, then D D k2 for some real constant k, and the quadratic has two distinct
roots, .B C k/=.2A/ and .B  k/=.2A/.
(b) If D D 0, then the quadratic has only the root B=.2A/, and this root has multi-

Remark
There exist formulas for calculating exact roots of cubic (degree 3) and
quartic (degree 4) polynomials, but, unlike the quadratic formula above, they are very
complicated and almost never used. Instead, calculus will provide us with very pow-
erful and easily used tools for approximating roots of polynomials (and solutions of
much more general equations) to any desired degree of accuracy.

For example,
x3 C a3 D .x C a/.x2  ax C a2/
x5 C a5 D .x C a/.x4  ax3 C a2x2  a3x C a4/:
Finally, we mention a trial-and-error method of factoring quadratic polynomials some-
times called trinomial factoring. Since
.x C p/.x C q/ D x2 C .p C q/x C pq;
.x  p/.x  q/ D x2  .p C q/x C pq;
and
.x C p/.x  q/ D x2 C .p  q/x  pq;
we can sometimes spot the factors of x2 C Bx C C by looking for factors of jCj for
which the sum or difference is B. More generally, we can sometimes factor
Ax2 C Bx C C D .ax C b/.cx C d/
by looking for factors a and c of A and factors b and d of C for which ad C bc D B.
Of course, if this fails you can always resort to the quadratic formula to ﬁnd the roots
and, therefore, the factors, of the quadratic polynomial.

The Trigonometric Functions
Most people ﬁrst encounter the quantities cos t and sin t as ratios of sides in a right-
angled triangle having t as one of the acute angles. If the sides of the triangle are
labelled “hyp” for hypotenuse, “adj” for the side adjacent to angle t; and “opp” for the
side opposite angle t (see Figure P.66), then
cos t D adj
hyp
and
sin t D opp
hyp:
./
These ratios depend only on the angle t, not on the particular triangle, since all right-
angled triangles having an acute angle t are similar.
In calculus we need more general deﬁnitions of cos t and sin t as functions deﬁned
for all real numbers t, not just acute angles. Such deﬁnitions are phrased in terms of a
circle rather than a triangle.

Let C be the circle with centre at the origin O and radius 1; its equation is x2 C
y2 D 1. Let A be the point .1; 0/ on C. For any real number t; let Pt be the point on
C at distance jtj from A, measured along C in the counterclockwise direction if t > 0,
and the clockwise direction if t < 0. For example, since C has circumference 2
, the
point P=2 is one-quarter of the way counterclockwise around C from A; it is the point
.0; 1/.
We will use the arc length t as a measure of the size of the angle AOPt. See
Figure P.67.

To convert degrees to radians, multiply by =180; to convert radians to degrees, mul-
tiply by 180=.
Angle convention
In calculus it is assumed that all angles are measured in radians unless degrees
or other units are stated explicitly. When we talk about the angle =3, we
mean =3 radians (which is 60ı), not =3 degrees.
EXAMPLE 1
Arc length and sector area. An arc of a circle of radius r subtends
an angle t at the centre of the circle. Find the length s of the arc
and the area A of the sector lying between the arc and the centre of the circle.

Arc length s D rt

The length s of the arc is the same fraction of the circumference 2r of the
circle that the angle t is of a complete revolution 2 radians (or 360ı). Thus,
s D

Similarly, the area A of the circular sector (Figure P.68) is the same fraction of the area
r2 of the whole circle:

2 units2:
(We will show that the area of a circle of radius r is r2 in Section 1.1.)
Using the procedure described above, we can ﬁnd the point Pt corresponding to any
real number t, positive or negative. We deﬁne cos t and sin t to be the coordinates of
Pt. (See Figure P.69.)
DEFINITION
8
Cosine and sine
For any real t, the cosine of t (abbreviated cos t) and the sine of t (abbreviated
sin t) are the x- and y-coordinates of the point Pt.
cos t D the x-coordinate of Pt
sin t D the y-coordinate of Pt
Because they are deﬁned this way, cosine and sine are often called the circular func-
tions. Note that these deﬁnitions agree with the ones given earlier for an acute angle.
(See formulas ./ at the beginning of this section.) The triangle involved is PtOQt in

Some Useful Identities
Many important properties of cos t and sin t follow from the fact that they are coordi-
nates of the point Pt on the circle C with equation x2 C y2 D 1.
The range of cosine and sine. For every real number t,
1  cos t  1
and
 1  sin t  1:
The Pythagorean identity. The coordinates x D cos t and y D sin t of Pt must
satisfy the equation of the circle. Therefore, for every real number t,
cos2 t C sin2 t D 1:
(Note that cos2 t means .cos t/2, not cos.cos t/. This is an unfortunate notation, but it
is used everywhere in technical literature, so you have to get used to it!)
Periodicity. Since C has circumference 2, adding 2 to t causes the point Pt to
go one extra complete revolution around C and end up in the same place: PtC2 D Pt.
Thus, for every t,

cos.t C 2/ D cos t
and
sin.t C 2/ D sin t:
This says that cosine and sine are periodic with period 2.
Cosine is an even function. Sine is an odd function. Since the circle x2Cy2 D 1
is symmetric about the x-axis, the points Pt and Pt have the same x-coordinates and
opposite y-coordinates (Figure P.71),
cos.t/ D cos t
and
sin.t/ D  sin t:
Complementary angle identities. Two angles are complementary if their sum
is =2 (or 90ı). The points P.=2/t and Pt are reﬂections of each other in the line
y D x (Figure P.72), so the x-coordinate of one is the y-coordinate of the other and
vice versa. Thus,

PRELIMINARIES
The three functions sine, cosine, and tangent are called primary trigonometric
functions, while their reciprocals cosecant, secant, and cotangent are called secondary
trigonometric functions. Scientiﬁc calculators usually just implement the primary
functions; you can use the reciprocal key to ﬁnd values of the corresponding secondary
functions. Figure P.84 shows a useful pattern called the “CAST rule” to help you

Maple knows all six trigonometric functions and can calculate their values and manip-
ulate them in other ways. It assumes the arguments of the trigonometric functions are

Trigonometry Review
The trigonometric functions are so called because they are often used to express the
relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. As we observed at the begin-
ning of this section, if  is one of the acute angles in a right-angled triangle, we can
refer to the three sides of the triangle as adj (side adjacent ), opp (side opposite ),
and hyp (hypotenuse). (See Figure P.85.) The trigonometric functions of  can then
be expressed as ratios of these sides, in particular:

opp

When dealing with general (not necessarily right-angled) triangles, it is often conve-
nient to label the vertices with capital letters, which also denote the angles at those
vertices, and refer to the sides opposite those vertices by the corresponding lowercase
letters. See Figure P.88. Relationships between the sides a, b, and c and opposite an-
gles A, B, and C of an arbitrary triangle ABC are given by the following formulas,
called the Sine Law and the Cosine Law.

we get c sin B D h D b sin C. Thus .sin B/=b D .sin C/=c. By the symmetry of the

A triangle is uniquely determined by any one of the following sets of data (which
correspond to the known cases of congruency of triangles in classical geometry):
1. two sides and the angle contained between them (e.g., Example 10);
2. three sides, no one of which exceeds the sum of the other two in length;
3. two angles and one side; or
4. the hypotenuse and one other side of a right-angled triangle.
In such cases you can always ﬁnd the unknown sides and angles by using the Pythagorean
Theorem or the Sine and Cosine Laws, and the fact that the sum of the three angles of
a triangle is 180ı (or  radians).
A triangle is not determined uniquely by two sides and a noncontained angle; there
may exist no triangle, one right-angled triangle, or two triangles having such data.

Introduction
Calculus was created to describe how quantities change.
It has two basic procedures that are opposites of one an-
other, namely:
 differentiation, for ﬁnding the rate of change of a given function, and
 integration, for ﬁnding a function having a given rate of change.
Both of these procedures are based on the fundamental concept of the limit of a func-
tion. It is this idea of limit that distinguishes calculus from algebra, geometry, and
trigonometry, which are useful for describing static situations.
In this chapter we will introduce the limit concept and develop some of its proper-
ties. We begin by considering how limits arise in some basic problems.
1.1
Examples of Velocity, Growth Rate, and Area
In this section we consider some examples of phenomena where limits arise in a natural
way.
Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity
The position of a moving object is a function of time. The average velocity of the
object over a time interval is found by dividing the change in the object’s position by
the length of the time interval.

(The average velocity of a falling rock) Physical experiments
show that if a rock is dropped from rest near the surface of the
earth, in the ﬁrst t s it will fall a distance
y D 4:9t2 m:
(a) What is the average velocity of the falling rock during the ﬁrst 2 s?
(b) What is its average velocity from t D 1 to t D 2?
Solution
The average velocity of the falling rock over any time interval Œt1; t2 is the
change y in the distance fallen divided by the length t of the time interval:

9:8005
Solution
We can calculate the average velocity over any time interval, but this ques-
tion asks for the instantaneous velocity at a given time. If the falling rock had a
speedometer, what would it show at time t D 1? To answer this, we ﬁrst write the
average velocity over the time interval Œ1; 1 C h starting at t D 1 and having length h:
Average velocity over Œ1; 1 C h D y
t D 4:9.1 C h/2  4:9.12/
h
:
We can’t calculate the instantaneous velocity at t D 1 by substituting h D 0 in this ex-
pression, because we can’t divide by zero. But we can calculate the average velocities
Table 2.

over shorter and shorter time intervals and see whether they seem to get close to a par-
ticular number. Table 1 shows the values of y=t for some values of h approaching
zero. Indeed, it appears that these average velocities get closer and closer to 9:8 m/s
as the length of the time interval gets closer and closer to zero. This suggests that the
rock is falling at a rate of 9.8 m/s one second after it is dropped.
Similarly, Table 2 shows values of the average velocities over shorter and shorter
time intervals Œ2; 2 C h starting at t D 2. The values suggest that the rock is falling at
19.6 m/s two seconds after it is dropped.
In Example 2 the average velocity of the falling rock over the time interval Œt; t C h is
y
t D 4:9.t C h/2  4:9t2
h
:
To ﬁnd the instantaneous velocity (usually just called the velocity) at the instants t D 1
and t D 2, we examined the values of this average velocity for time intervals whose
lengths h became smaller and smaller. We were, in fact, ﬁnding the limit of the average
velocity as h approaches zero. This is expressed symbolically in the form
velocity at time t D lim
h!0
y
t D lim

4:9.t C h/2  4:9t2
h
:
Read “limh!0 : : : ” as “the limit as h approaches zero of : : : ” We can’t ﬁnd the limit
of the fraction by just substituting h D 0 because that would involve dividing by zero.
However, we can calculate the limit by ﬁrst performing some algebraic simpliﬁcations
on the expression for the average velocity.

SECTION 1.1:
Examples of Velocity, Growth Rate, and Area
61
EXAMPLE 3
Simplify the expression for the average velocity of the rock over
Œt; t C h by ﬁrst expanding .t C h/2. Hence, ﬁnd the velocity v.t/
of the falling rock at time t directly, without making a table of values.
Solution
The average velocity of the rock over time interval Œt; t C h is
4:9.t C h/2  4:9t2
h
D 4:9.t2 C 2th C h2  t2/
h
D 4:9.2th C h2/
h
D 9:8t C 4:9h:
The ﬁnal form of the expression no longer involves division by h. It approaches 9:8t C
4:9.0/ D 9:8t as h approaches 0. Thus, t s after the rock is dropped, its velocity is
v.t/ D 9:8t m/s. In particular, at t D 1 and t D 2 the velocities are v.1/ D 9:8 m/s
and v.2/ D 19:6 m/s, respectively.
The Growth of an Algal Culture
In a laboratory experiment, the biomass of an algal culture was measured over a
74-day period by measuring the area in square millimetres occupied by the culture on a
microscope slide. These measurements m were plotted against the time t in days and
the points joined by a smooth curve m D f .t/, as shown in red in Figure 1.1.

Observe that the biomass was about 0.1 mm2 on day 10 and had grown to about
1.7 mm2 on day 40, an increase of 1:7  0:1 D 1:6 mm2 in a time interval of
40  10 D 30 days. The average rate of growth over the time interval from day 10
to day 40 was therefore
1:7  0:1
40  10 D 1:6
30  0:053 mm2/d:
This average rate is just the slope of the green line joining the points on the graph of
m D f .t/ corresponding to t D 10 and t D 40. Similarly, the average rate of growth
of the algal biomass over any time interval can be determined by measuring the slope
of the line joining the points on the curve corresponding to that time interval. Such
lines are called secant lines to the curve.
EXAMPLE 4
How fast is the biomass growing on day 60?

62
CHAPTER 1
Limits and Continuity
Solution
To answer this question, we could measure the average rates of change over
shorter and shorter times around day 60. The corresponding secant lines become
shorter and shorter, but their slopes approach a limit, namely, the slope of the tan-
gent line to the graph of m D f .t/ at the point where t D 60. This tangent line is
sketched in blue in Figure 1.1; it seems to go through the points .2; 0/ and .69; 5/, so
that its slope is
5  0
69  2  0:0746 mm2/d:
This is the rate at which the biomass was growing on day 60.
The Area of a Circle
All circles are similar geometric ﬁgures; they all have the same shape and differ only
in size. The ratio of the circumference C to the diameter 2r (twice the radius) has the
same value for all circles. The number  is deﬁned to be this common ratio:
C
2r D 
or
C D 2r:
In school we are taught that the area A of a circle is this same number  times the
square of the radius:
A D r2:
How can we deduce this area formula from the formula for the circumference that is
the deﬁnition of ?
The answer to this question lies in regarding the circle as a “limit” of regular
polygons, which are in turn made up of triangles, ﬁgures about whose geometry we
know a great deal.
Suppose a regular polygon having n sides is inscribed in a circle of radius r. (See
Figure 1.2.) The perimeter Pn and the area An of the polygon are, respectively, less
than the circumference C and the area A of the circle, but if n is large, Pn is close to
C and An is close to A. (In fact, the “circle” in Figure 1.2 was drawn by a computer
as a regular polygon having 180 sides, each subtending a 2ı angle at the centre of the
circle. It is very difﬁcult to distinguish this 180-sided polygon from a real circle.) We
would expect Pn to approach the limit C and An to approach the limit A as n grows
larger and larger and approaches inﬁnity.

A regular polygon of n sides is the union of n nonoverlapping, congruent, isosce-
les triangles having a common vertex at O, the centre of the polygon. One of these
triangles, 4OAB, is shown in Figure 1.2. Since the total angle around the point O is
2 radians (we are assuming that a circle of radius 1 has circumference 2), the angle
AOB is 2=n radians. If M is the midpoint of AB, then OM bisects angle AOB.
Using elementary trigonometry, we can write the length of AB and the area of triangle
OAB in terms of the radius r of the circle:

There is a fundamental relationship between the problem of ﬁnding the area

rate of change is f: It will be explored fully beginning in Chapter 5. As an example,
for the falling rock of Example 1–Example 3, the green area A under the graph of the
velocity function v D 9:8t m/s and above the interval Œ0; t on the t-axis is the area of
a triangle of base length t s and height 9:8t m/s, and so (see Figure 1.3) is

which is exactly the distance y that the rock falls during the ﬁrst t seconds. The rate
of change of the area function A.t/ (that is, of the distance function y) is the velocity
function v.t/.

Limits of Functions
In order to speak meaningfully about rates of change, tangent lines, and areas bounded
by curves, we have to investigate the process of ﬁnding limits. Indeed, the concept of
limit is the cornerstone on which the development of calculus rests. Before we try to
give a deﬁnition of a limit, let us look at more examples.
EXAMPLE 1
Describe the behaviour of the function f .x/ D x2  1
x  1
near
x D 1.
Solution
Note that f .x/ is deﬁned for all real numbers x except x D 1. (We can’t
divide by zero.) For any x ¤ 1 we can simplify the expression for f .x/ by factoring
the numerator and cancelling common factors:
f .x/ D .x  1/.x C 1/
x  1
D x C 1
for
x ¤ 1:
The graph of f is the line y D x C1 with one point removed, namely, the point .1; 2/.
This removed point is shown as a “hole” in the graph in Figure 1.4. Even though f .1/
is not deﬁned, it is clear that we can make the value of f .x/ as close as we want to 2 by
choosing x close enough to 1. Therefore, we say that f .x/ approaches arbitrarily close
to 2 as x approaches 1, or, more simply, f .x/ approaches the limit 2 as x approaches
1. We write this as

appear to be deﬁned for any x whose square x2 is not a rational number. (Recall that if
r D m=n, where m and n are integers and n > 0, then xr means the nth root of xm.)
Let us ignore for now the problem of deciding what g.x/ means if x2 is irrational and
consider only rational values of x. There is no obvious way to simplify the expression
for g.x/ as we did in Example 1. However, we can use a scientiﬁc calculator to obtain
approximate values of g.x/ for some rational values of x approaching 0. (The values
in Table 4 were obtained with such a calculator.)
Except for the last value in the table, the values of g.x/ seem to be approaching a
certain number, 2:71828 : : : , as x gets closer and closer to 0. We will show in Section
3.4 that
lim
x!0 g.x/ D lim
x!0.1 C x2/1=x2 D e D 2:7 1828 1828 45 90 45 : : : :
The number e turns out to be very important in mathematics.
K
Observe that the last entry in the table appears to be wrong. This is important. It is
because the calculator can only represent a ﬁnite number of numbers. The calculator
was unable to distinguish 1 C .0:00001/2 D 1:0000000001 from 1, and it therefore
calculated 110;000;000;000 D 1. While for many calculations on computers this reality
can be minimized, it cannot be eliminated. The wrong value warns us of something
called round-off error. We can explore with computer graphics what this means for
g near 0. As was the case for the numerical monster encountered in Section P.4, the
computer can produce rich and beautiful behaviour in its failed attempt to represent g,
which is very different from what g actually does. While it is possible to get computer
algebra software like Maple to evaluate limits correctly (as we will see in the next
section), we cannot use computer graphics or ﬂoating-point arithmetic to study many
mathematical notions such as limits. In fact, we will need mathematics to understand
what the computer actually does so that we can be the master of our tools.

Figures 1.5–1.7 illustrate this fascinating behaviour of g with three plots made with
Maple using its default 10-signiﬁcant-ﬁgure precision in representing ﬂoating-point
(i.e., real) numbers. Figure 1.5 is a plot of the graph of g on the interval Œ1; 1. The
graph starts out at height 2 at either endpoint x D ˙1 and rises to height approximately
2:718    as x decreases in absolute value, as we would expect from Table 4. Figure 1.6
shows the graph of g restricted to the tiny interval Œ5  108; 5  108. It consists
of many short arcs decreasing in height as jxj increases, and clustering around the
line y D 2:718   , and a horizontal part at height 1 between approximately 108
and 108. Figure 1.7 zooms in on the part of the graph to the right of the origin
up to x D 2:5  108. Note how the arc closest to 0 coincides with the graph of

(shown in black), indicating that 1 C 2  1016 may be
the smallest number greater than 1 that Maple can distinguish from 1. Both ﬁgures
show that the breakdown in the graph of g is not sudden, but becomes more and more
pronounced as jxj decreases until the breakdown is complete near ˙108.
The examples above and those in Section 1.1 suggest the following informal deﬁnition
of limit.
DEFINITION
1
An informal deﬁnition of limit
If f .x/ is deﬁned for all x near a, except possibly at a itself, and if we can
ensure that f .x/ is as close as we want to L by taking x close enough to a,
but not equal to a, we say that the function f approaches the limit L as x
approaches a, and we write
lim
x!a f .x/ D L
or
limx!af .x/ D L:
This deﬁnition is informal because phrases such as close as we want and close enough
are imprecise; their meaning depends on the context. To a machinist manufacturing a
piston, close enough may mean within a few thousandths of an inch. To an astronomer
studying distant galaxies, close enough may mean within a few thousand light-years.
The deﬁnition should be clear enough, however, to enable us to recognize and evaluate
limits of speciﬁc functions. A more precise “formal” deﬁnition, given in Section 1.5,
is needed if we want to prove theorems about limits like Theorems 2–4, stated later in
this section.
EXAMPLE 3
Find
(a) lim
x!a x
and
(b) lim
x!a c (where c is a constant).
Solution
In words, part (a) asks: “What does x approach as x approaches a?” The
answer is surely a.
lim
x!a x D a:
Similarly, part (b) asks: “What does c approach as x approaches a?” The answer here
is that c approaches c; you can’t get any closer to c than by being c.
lim
x!a c D c:
Example 3 shows that limx!a f .x/ can sometimes be evaluated by just calculating
f .a/. This will be the case if f .x/ is deﬁned in an open interval containing x D a
and the graph of f passes unbroken through the point .a; f .a//. The next example
shows various ways algebraic manipulations can be used to evaluate limx!a f .x/ in
situations where f .a/ is undeﬁned. This usually happens when f .x/ is a fraction with
denominator equal to 0 at x D a.

BEWARE!
Always be aware
that the existence of limx!a f .x/
does not require that f .a/ exist and
does not depend on f .a/ even if
f .a/ does exist. It depends only on
the values of f .x/ for x near but
not equal to a.
A function f may be deﬁned on both sides of x D a but still not have a limit at x D a.
For example, the function f .x/ D 1=x has no limit as x approaches 0. As can be seen
in Figure 1.8(a), the values 1=x grow ever larger in absolute value as x approaches 0;
there is no single number L that they approach.
The following example shows that even if f .x/ is deﬁned at x D a, the limit of
f .x/ as x approaches a may not be equal to f .a/.

(See Exercise 31 in Section 1.5.) Although a function f can only have one limit at
any particular point, it is, nevertheless, useful to be able to describe the behaviour of
functions that approach different numbers as x approaches a from one side or the other.

DEFINITION
2
Informal deﬁnition of left and right limits
If f .x/ is deﬁned on some interval .b; a/ extending to the left of x D a, and
if we can ensure that f .x/ is as close as we want to L by taking x to the left
of a and close enough to a, then we say f .x/ has left limit L at x D a, and
we write
lim
x!a f .x/ D L:
If f .x/ is deﬁned on some interval .a; b/ extending to the right of x D a, and
if we can ensure that f .x/ is as close as we want to L by taking x to the right
of a and close enough to a, then we say f .x/ has right limit L at x D a, and
we write
lim
x!aC f .x/ D L:
Note the use of the sufﬁx C to denote approach from the right (the positive side) and
the sufﬁx  to denote approach from the left (the negative side).
EXAMPLE 6
The signum function sgn .x/ D x=jxj (see Figure 1.10) has left
limit 1 and right limit 1 at x D 0:
lim
x!0 sgn .x/ D 1
and
lim
x!0C sgn .x/ D 1
because the values of sgn .x/ approach 1 (they are 1) if x is negative and ap-
proaches 0, and they approach 1 if x is positive and approaches 0. Since these left and
right limits are not equal, limx!0 sgn .x/ does not exist.

Rules for Calculating Limits
The following theorems make it easy to calculate limits and one-sided limits of many
kinds of functions when we know some elementary limits. We will not prove the
theorems here. (See Section 1.5.)

2.
Limit of a difference:
lim

3.
Limit of a product:
lim

and L ¤ 0 if m < 0.
If f .x/  g.x/ on an interval containing a in its interior, then
7.
Order is preserved:
L  M
Rules 1–6 are also valid for right limits and left limits. So is Rule 7, under the as-
sumption that f .x/  g.x/ on an open interval extending from a in the appropriate
direction.
In words, rule 1 of Theorem 2 says that the limit of a sum of functions is the sum of
their limits. Similarly, rule 5 says that the limit of a quotient of two functions is the
quotient of their limits, provided that the limit of the denominator is not zero. Try to
state the other rules in words.
We can make use of the limits (a) limx!a c D c (where c is a constant) and (b)
limx!a x D a, from Example 3, together with parts of Theorem 2 to calculate limits
of many combinations of functions.

limit zero. Thus,

The Squeeze Theorem
The following theorem will enable us to calculate some very important limits in sub-
sequent chapters. It is called the Squeeze Theorem because it refers to a function g
whose values are squeezed between the values of two other functions f and h that
have the same limit L at a point a. Being trapped between the values of two functions
that approach L, the values of g must also approach L. (See Figure 1.12.)

Using Graphing Utilities to Find Limits
Graphing calculators or computer software can be used to evaluate
limits at least approximately. Simply “zoom” the plot window to
show smaller and smaller parts of the graph near the point where
the limit is to be found. Find the following limits by graphical
techniques. Where you think it justiﬁed, give an exact answer.
Otherwise, give the answer correct to 4 decimal places. Remember
to ensure that your calculator or software is set for radian mode
when using trigonometric functions.

1.3
Limits at Inﬁnity and Inﬁnite Limits
In this section we will extend the concept of limit to allow for two situations not covered
by the deﬁnitions of limit and one-sided limit in the previous section:
(i) limits at inﬁnity, where x becomes arbitrarily large, positive or negative;
(ii) inﬁnite limits, which are not really limits at all but provide useful symbolism for
describing the behaviour of functions whose values become arbitrarily large, pos-
itive or negative.

whose graph is shown in Figure 1.15 and for which some values (rounded to 7 decimal
places) are given in Table 5. The values of f .x/ seem to approach 1 as x takes on
larger and larger positive values, and 1 as x takes on negative values that get larger
and larger in absolute value. (See Example 2 below for conﬁrmation.) We express this
behaviour by writing
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 1
“f .x/ approaches 1 as x approaches inﬁnity.”
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 1
“f .x/ approaches 1 as x approaches negative inﬁnity.”
The graph of f conveys this limiting behaviour by approaching the horizontal lines
y D 1 as x moves far to the right and y D 1 as x moves far to the left. These lines are
called horizontal asymptotes of the graph. In general, if a curve approaches a straight
line as it recedes very far away from the origin, that line is called an asymptote of the
curve.
DEFINITION
3
Limits at inﬁnity and negative inﬁnity (informal deﬁnition)
If the function f is deﬁned on an interval .a; 1/ and if we can ensure that
f .x/ is as close as we want to the number L by taking x large enough, then
we say that f .x/ approaches the limit L as x approaches inﬁnity, and we
write
lim
x!1 f .x/ D L:
If f is deﬁned on an interval .1; b/ and if we can ensure that f .x/ is as
close as we want to the number M by taking x negative and large enough
in absolute value, then we say that f .x/ approaches the limit M as x ap-
proaches negative inﬁnity, and we write
lim
x!1 f .x/ D M:
Recall that the symbol 1, called inﬁnity, does not represent a real number. We cannot
use 1 in arithmetic in the usual way, but we can use the phrase “approaches 1” to
mean “becomes arbitrarily large positive” and the phrase “approaches 1” to mean
“becomes arbitrarily large negative.”

CHAPTER 1
Limits and Continuity
EXAMPLE 1
In Figure 1.16, we can see that limx!1 1=x D limx!1 1=x D
0. The x-axis is a horizontal asymptote of the graph y D 1=x.
The theorems of Section 1.2 have suitable counterparts for limits at inﬁnity or
negative inﬁnity. In particular, it follows from the example above and from the Product
Rule for limits that limx!˙1 1=xn D 0 for any positive integer n. We will use this
fact in the following examples. Example 2 shows how to obtain the limits at ˙1 for
the function x=
p
x2 C 1 by algebraic means, without resorting to making a table of
values or drawing a graph, as we did above.

The factor

the same limits as x ! ˙1 as does sgn .x/. Therefore (see Figure 1.15),
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 1
and
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 1:
Limits at Inﬁnity for Rational Functions
The only polynomials that have limits at ˙1 are constant ones, P.x/ D c. The
situation is more interesting for rational functions. Recall that a rational function is
a quotient of two polynomials. The following examples show how to render such a
function in a form where its limits at inﬁnity and negative inﬁnity (if they exist) are
apparent. The way to do this is to divide the numerator and denominator by the highest
power of x appearing in the denominator. The limits of a rational function at inﬁnity
and negative inﬁnity either both fail to exist or both exist and are equal.

The technique used in the previous examples can also be applied to more general
kinds of functions. The function in the following example is not rational, and the limit
seems to produce a meaningless 1  1 until we resolve matters by rationalizing the
numerator.

Solution
We are trying to ﬁnd the limit of the difference of two functions, each of
which becomes arbitrarily large as x increases to inﬁnity. We rationalize the expres-

as x ! 1, we have
p

x ! 1. The limit does not exist.
Inﬁnite Limits
A function whose values grow arbitrarily large can sometimes be said to have an inﬁ-
nite limit. Since inﬁnity is not a number, inﬁnite limits are not really limits at all, but
they provide a way of describing the behaviour of functions that grow arbitrarily large
positive or negative. A few examples will make the terminology clear.
EXAMPLE 6
(A two-sided inﬁnite limit) Describe the behaviour of the func-
tion f .x/ D 1=x2 near x D 0.
Solution
As x approaches 0 from either side, the values of f .x/ are positive and
grow larger and larger (see Figure 1.17), so the limit of f .x/ as x approaches 0 does
not exist. It is nevertheless convenient to describe the behaviour of f near 0 by saying
that f .x/ approaches 1 as x approaches zero. We write
lim
x!0 f .x/ D lim
x!0
1
x2 D 1:
Note that in writing this we are not saying that limx!0 1=x2 exists. Rather, we are
saying that that limit does not exist because 1=x2 becomes arbitrarily large near x D
0. Observe how the graph of f approaches the y-axis as x approaches 0. The y-axis
is a vertical asymptote of the graph.

CHAPTER 1
Limits and Continuity
EXAMPLE 7
(One-sided inﬁnite limits) Describe the behaviour of the function
f .x/ D 1=x near x D 0. (See Figure 1.18.)
Solution
As x approaches 0 from the right, the values of f .x/ become larger and
larger positive numbers, and we say that f has right-hand limit inﬁnity at x D 0:
lim
x!0C f .x/ D 1:
Similarly, the values of f .x/ become larger and larger negative numbers as x ap-
proaches 0 from the left, so f has left-hand limit 1 at x D 0:
lim
x!0 f .x/ D 1:
These statements do not say that the one-sided limits exist; they do not exist because
1 and 1 are not numbers. Since the one-sided limits are not equal even as inﬁnite
symbols, all we can say about the two-sided limx!0 f .x/ is that it does not exist.

(d)
limx!1 .x4  5x3  x/ D 1
The highest-degree term of a polynomial dominates the other terms as jxj grows large,
so the limits of this term at 1 and 1 determine the limits of the whole polynomial.
For the polynomial in parts (a) and (b) we have
3x3  x2 C 2 D 3x3

1  1
3x C
2
3x3

:
The factor in the large parentheses approaches 1 as x approaches ˙1, so the behaviour
of the polynomial is just that of its highest-degree term 3x3.
We can now say a bit more about the limits at inﬁnity and negative inﬁnity of a rational
function whose numerator has higher degree than the denominator. Earlier in this
section we said that such a limit does not exist. This is true, but we can assign 1 or
1 to such limits, as the following example shows.

A polynomial Q.x/ of degree n > 0 can have at most n zeros; that is, there are at
most n different real numbers r for which Q.r/ D 0. If Q.x/ is the denominator of
a rational function R.x/ D P.x/=Q.x/, that function will be deﬁned for all x except
those ﬁnitely many zeros of Q. At each of those zeros, R.x/ may have limits, inﬁnite
limits, or one-sided inﬁnite limits. Here are some examples.

In parts (a) and (b) the effect of the zero in the denominator at x D 2 is cancelled
because the numerator is zero there also. Thus a ﬁnite limit exists. This is not true in
part (f) because the numerator only vanishes once at x D 2, while the denominator
vanishes three times there.
Using Maple to Calculate Limits
Maple’s limit procedure can be easily used to calculate limits, one-sided limits,
limits at inﬁnity, and inﬁnite limits. Here is the syntax for calculating

1.4
Continuity
When a car is driven along a highway, its distance from its starting point depends on
time in a continuous way, changing by small amounts over short intervals of time. But
not all quantities change in this way. When the car is parked in a parking lot where
the rate is quoted as “$2.00 per hour or portion,” the parking charges remain at $2.00
for the ﬁrst hour and then suddenly jump to $4.00 as soon as the ﬁrst hour has passed.
The function relating parking charges to parking time will be called discontinuous at
each hour. In this section we will deﬁne continuity and show how to tell whether a
function is continuous. We will also examine some important properties possessed by
continuous functions.
Continuity at a Point
Most functions that we encounter have domains that are intervals, or unions of separate
intervals. A point P in the domain of such a function is called an interior point of
the domain if it belongs to some open interval contained in the domain. If it is not an
interior point, then P is called an endpoint of the domain. For example, the domain of
the function f .x/ D
p
4  x2 is the closed interval Œ2; 2, which consists of interior
points in the interval .2; 2/, a left endpoint 2, and a right endpoint 2. The domain
of the function g.x/ D 1=x is the union of open intervals .1; 0/ [ .0; 1/ and
consists entirely of interior points. Note that although 0 is an endpoint of each of
those intervals, it does not belong to the domain of g and so is not an endpoint of that
domain.
DEFINITION
4
Continuity at an interior point
We say that a function f is continuous at an interior point c of its domain if
lim
x!c f .x/ D f .c/:
If either limx!c f .x/ fails to exist or it exists but is not equal to f .c/, then
we will say that f is discontinuous at c.
In graphical terms, f is continuous at an interior point c of its domain if its graph has
no break in it at the point .c; f .c//; in other words, if you can draw the graph through
that point without lifting your pen from the paper. Consider Figure 1.21. In (a), f is
continuous at c. In (b), f is discontinuous at c because limx!c f .x/ ¤ f .c/. In (c),

80
CHAPTER 1
Limits and Continuity
f is discontinuous at c because limx!c f .x/ does not exist. In both (b) and (c) the
graph of f has a break at x D c.

Although a function cannot have a limit at an endpoint of its domain, it can still
have a one-sided limit there. We extend the deﬁnition of continuity to provide for such
situations.
DEFINITION

Right and left continuity
We say that f is right continuous at c if lim
x!cC f .x/ D f .c/.
We say that f is left continuous at c if lim
x!c f .x/ D f .c/.

The relationship between continuity and one-sided continuity is summarized in the
following theorem.

Function f is continuous at c if and only if it is both right continuous and left contin-
uous at c.
DEFINITION
6
Continuity at an endpoint
We say that f is continuous at a left endpoint c of its domain if it is right
continuous there.
We say that f is continuous at a right endpoint c of its domain if it is left
continuous there.
EXAMPLE 2
The function f .x/ D
p
4  x2 has domain Œ2; 2. It is contin-
uous at the right endpoint 2 because it is left continuous there,
that is, because limx!2 f .x/ D 0 D f .2/. It is continuous at the left endpoint
2 because it is right continuous there: limx!2C f .x/ D 0 D f .2/. Of course,
f is also continuous at every interior point of its domain. If 2 < c < 2, then

Continuity on an Interval
We have deﬁned the concept of continuity at a point. Of greater importance is the
concept of continuity on an interval.
DEFINITION
7
Continuity on an interval
We say that function f is continuous on the interval I if it is continuous at
each point of I. In particular, we will say that f is a continuous function if
f is continuous at every point of its domain.
EXAMPLE 3
The function f .x/ D px is a continuous function. Its domain is
Œ0; 1/. It is continuous at the left endpoint 0 because it is right
continuous there. Also, f is continuous at every number c > 0 since limx!c
px D
pc.
EXAMPLE 4
The function g.x/ D 1=x is also a continuous function. This may
seem wrong to you at ﬁrst glance because its graph is broken at
x D 0. (See Figure 1.24.) However, the number 0 is not in the domain of g, so we will
prefer to say that g is undeﬁned rather than discontinuous there. (Some authors would
say that g is discontinuous at x D 0.) If we were to deﬁne g.0/ to be some number,
y

g.0/ so that g becomes continuous at 0.
EXAMPLE 5
The greatest integer function bxc (see Figure 1.20) is continuous
on every interval Œn; n C 1/, where n is an integer. It is right con-
tinuous at each integer n but is not left continuous there, so it is discontinuous at the
integers.

There Are Lots of Continuous Functions
The following functions are continuous wherever they are deﬁned:
(a) all polynomials;
(b) all rational functions;
(c) all rational powers xm=n D
npxm;
(d) the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions deﬁned in Sec-
tion P.7; and
(e) the absolute value function jxj.
Theorem 3 of Section 1.2 assures us that every polynomial is continuous everywhere
on the real line, and every rational function is continuous everywhere on its domain
(which consists of all real numbers except the ﬁnitely many where its denominator is
zero). If m and n are integers and n ¤ 0, the rational power function xm=n is deﬁned
for all positive numbers x, and also for all negative numbers x if n is odd. The domain
includes 0 if and only if m=n  0.
The following theorems show that if we combine continuous functions in various
ways, the results will be continuous.

Combining continuous functions
If the functions f and g are both deﬁned on an interval containing c and both are
continuous at c, then the following functions are also continuous at c:
1. the sum f C g and the difference f  g;
2. the product fg;
3. the constant multiple kf , where k is any number;
4. the quotient f=g (provided g.c/ ¤ 0); and
5. the nth root .f .x//1=n, provided f .c/ > 0 if n is even.
The proof involves using the various limit rules in Theorem 2 of Section 1.2. For
example,
lim
x!c

f .x/ C g.x/

D lim
x!c f .x/ C lim
x!c g.x/ D f .c/ C g.c/;
so f C g is continuous.
T H E O R E M

Composites of continuous functions are continuous
If f .g.x// is deﬁned on an interval containing c, and if f is continuous at L and
limx!c g.x/ D L, then
lim
x!c f .g.x// D f .L/ D f

lim
x!c g.x/

:
In particular, if g is continuous at c (so L D g.c/), then the composition f ı g is
continuous at c:
lim
x!c f .g.x// D f .g.c//:
(See Exercise 37 in Section 1.5.)

Continuous Extensions and Removable Discontinuities
As we have seen in Section 1.2, a rational function may have a limit even at a point
where its denominator is zero. If f .c/ is not deﬁned, but limx!c f .x/ D L exists, we
can deﬁne a new function F.x/ by
F.x/ D
n f .x/
if x is in the domain of f
L
if x D c.
F.x/ is continuous at x D c. It is called the continuous extension of f .x/ to x D
c. For rational functions f, continuous extensions are usually found by cancelling
common factors.

The graph of f is shown in Figure 1.25. The continuous extension of f .x/ to x D 1
is F.x/. It has the same graph as f .x/ except with no hole at .1; 1=2/.
If a function f is undeﬁned or discontinuous at a point a but can be (re)deﬁned at that
single point so that it becomes continuous there, then we say that f has a removable
discontinuity at a. The function f in the above example has a removable discontinuity
at x D 1. To remove it, deﬁne f .1/ D 1=2.

Continuous Functions on Closed, Finite Intervals

that make them particularly useful in mathematics and its applications. We will dis-

cuss two of these properties here. Although they may appear obvious, these properties
are much more subtle than the results about limits stated earlier in this chapter; their
proofs (see Appendix III) require a careful study of the implications of the complete-
ness property of the real numbers.
The ﬁrst of the properties states that a function f .x/ that is continuous on a closed,
ﬁnite interval Œa; b must have an absolute maximum value and an absolute mini-
mum value. This means that the values of f .x/ at all points of the interval lie between
the values of f .x/ at two particular points in the interval; the graph of f has a highest
point and a lowest point.
T H E O R E M
8
The Max-Min Theorem
If f .x/ is continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b, then there exist numbers p
and q in Œa; b such that for all x in Œa; b,
f .p/  f .x/  f .q/:
Thus, f has the absolute minimum value m D f .p/, taken on at the point p, and the
absolute maximum value M D f .q/, taken on at the point q.
Many important problems in mathematics and its applications come down to having to
ﬁnd maximum and minimum values of functions. Calculus provides some very useful
tools for solving such problems. Observe, however, that the theorem above merely
asserts that minimum and maximum values exist; it doesn’t tell us how to ﬁnd them. In
Chapter 4 we will develop techniques for calculating maximum and minimum values of
functions. For now, we can solve some simple maximum and minimum value problems
involving quadratic functions by completing the square without using any calculus.
EXAMPLE 9
What is the largest possible area of a rectangular ﬁeld that can be
enclosed by 200 m of fencing?

84
CHAPTER 1
Limits and Continuity
Solution
If the sides of the ﬁeld are x m and y m (Figure 1.27), then its perimeter
is P D 2x C 2y m, and its area is A D xy m2. We are given that P D 200, so
x C y D 100, and y D 100  x. Neither side can be negative, so x must belong to
the closed interval Œ0; 100. The area of the ﬁeld can be expressed as a function of x
by substituting 100  x for y:
A D x.100  x/ D 100x  x2:
We want to ﬁnd the maximum value of the quadratic function A.x/ D 100x  x2 on
the interval Œ0; 100. Theorem 8 assures us that such a maximum exists.
x
y
Figure 1.27
Rectangular ﬁeld:
perimeter D 2x C 2y, area D xy
To ﬁnd the maximum, we complete the square of the function A.x/. Note that
x2  100x are the ﬁrst two terms of the square .x  50/2 D x2  100x C 2;500. Thus,
A.x/ D 2;500  .x  50/2:
Observe that A.50/ D 2; 500 and A.x/ < 2;500 if x ¤ 50, because we are subtracting
a positive number .x  50/2 from 2;500 in this case. Therefore, the maximum value
of A.x/ is 2;500. The largest ﬁeld has area 2;500 m2 and is actually a square with
dimensions x D y D 50 m.
Theorem 8 implies that a function that is continuous on a closed, ﬁnite interval is
bounded. This means that it cannot take on arbitrarily large positive or negative values;
there must exist a number K such that
jf .x/j  KI
that is,
 K  f .x/  K:
In fact, for K we can use the larger of the numbers jf .p/j and jf .q/j in the theorem.
The conclusions of Theorem 8 may fail if the function f is not continuous or if
the interval is not closed. See Figures 1.28–1.31 for examples of how such failure can
occur.

The second property of a continuous function deﬁned on a closed, ﬁnite interval
is that the function takes on all real values between any two of its values. This property
is called the intermediate-value property.

SECTION 1.4:

T H E O R E M

The Intermediate-Value Theorem
If f .x/ is continuous on the interval Œa; b and if s is a number between f .a/ and
f .b/, then there exists a number c in Œa; b such that f .c/ D s.
In particular, a continuous function deﬁned on a closed interval takes on all values
between its minimum value m and its maximum value M, so its range is also a closed
interval, Œm; M.
Figure 1.32 shows a typical situation. The points .a; f .a// and .b; f .b// are on
opposite sides of the horizontal line y D s. Being unbroken, the graph y D f .x/
must cross this line in order to go from one point to the other. In the ﬁgure, it crosses
the line only once, at x D c. If the line y D s were somewhat higher, there might have
been three crossings and three possible values for c.
Theorem 9 is the reason why the graph of a function that is continuous on an
interval I cannot have any breaks. It must be connected, a single, unbroken curve
with no jumps.

EXAMPLE 10
Determine the intervals on which f .x/ D x3  4x is positive and

Solution
Since f .x/ D x.x2  4/ D x.x  2/.x C 2/, f .x/ D 0 only at x D 0; 2;
and 2. Because f is continuous on the whole real line, it must have constant sign
on each of the intervals .1; 2/, .2; 0/, .0; 2/, and .2; 1/. (If there were points a
and b in one of those intervals, say in .0; 2/, such that f .a/ < 0 and f .b/ > 0, then
by the Intermediate-Value Theorem there would exist c between a and b, and therefore
between 0 and 2, such that f .c/ D 0. But we know f has no such zero in .0; 2/.)
To ﬁnd whether f .x/ is positive or negative throughout each interval, pick a point
in the interval and evaluate f at that point:
Since f .3/ D 15 < 0, f .x/ is negative on .1; 2/.
Since f .1/ D 3 > 0, f .x/ is positive on .2; 0/.
Since f .1/ D 3 < 0, f .x/ is negative on .0; 2/.
Since f .3/ D 15 > 0, f .x/ is positive on .2; 1/.
Finding Roots of Equations
Among the many useful tools that calculus will provide are ones that enable us to cal-
culate solutions to equations of the form f .x/ D 0 to any desired degree of accuracy.
Such a solution is called a root of the equation, or a zero of the function f . Using
these tools usually requires previous knowledge that the equation has a solution in
some interval. The Intermediate-Value Theorem can provide this information.
EXAMPLE 11
Show that the equation x3x1 D 0 has a solution in the interval
Œ1; 2.
Solution
The function f .x/ D x3x1 is a polynomial and is therefore continuous
everywhere. Now f .1/ D 1 and f .2/ D 5. Since 0 lies between 1 and 5, the
Intermediate-Value Theorem assures us that there must be a number c in Œ1; 2 such
that f .c/ D 0.
One method for ﬁnding a zero of a function that is continuous and changes sign on an
interval involves bisecting the interval many times, each time determining which half
of the previous interval must contain the root, because the function has opposite signs
at the two ends of that half. This method is slow. For example, if the original interval

has length 1, it will take 11 bisections to cut down to an interval of length less than
0.0005 (because 211 > 2;000 D 1=.0:0005/), and thus to ensure that we have found
the root correct to 3 decimal places.
EXAMPLE 12
(The Bisection Method) Solve the equation x3  x  1 D 0 of
Example 11 correct to 3 decimal places by successive bisections.

We start out knowing that there is a root in Œ1; 2. Table 6 shows the results
of the bisections.

In Section 4.2, calculus will provide us with much faster methods of solving equa-
tions such as the one in the example above. Many programmable calculators and com-
puter algebra software packages have built-in routines for solving equations. For ex-
ample, Maple’s fsolve routine can be used to ﬁnd the real solution of x3x 1 D 0

Remark
The Max-Min Theorem and the Intermediate-Value Theorem are examples
of what mathematicians call existence theorems. Such theorems assert that something
exists without telling you how to ﬁnd it. Students sometimes complain that mathemati-
cians worry too much about proving that a problem has a solution and not enough about
how to ﬁnd that solution. They argue: “If I can calculate a solution to a problem, then
surely I do not need to worry about whether a solution exists.” This is, however, false
logic. Suppose we pose the problem: “Find the largest positive integer.” Of course,
this problem has no solution; there is no largest positive integer because we can add 1
to any integer and get a larger integer. Suppose, however, that we forget this and try to
calculate a solution. We could proceed as follows:
Let N be the largest positive integer.
Since 1 is a positive integer, we must have N  1.
Since N 2 is a positive integer, it cannot exceed the largest positive integer.
Therefore, N 2  N and so N 2  N  0.
Thus, N.N  1/  0 and we must have N  1  0.
Therefore, N  1. Since also N  1, we have N D 1.
Therefore, 1 is the largest positive integer.

The only error we have made here is in the assumption (in the ﬁrst line) that the prob-
lem has a solution. It is partly to avoid logical pitfalls like this that mathematicians
prove existence theorems.

The Formal Deﬁnition of Limit
The informal deﬁnition of limit given in Section 1.2 is not precise enough to enable

optional.
us to prove results about limits such as those given in Theorems 2–4 of Section 1.2.
A more precise formal deﬁnition is based on the idea of controlling the input x of a
function f so that the output f .x/ will lie in a speciﬁc interval.
EXAMPLE 1
The area of a circular disk of radius r cm is A D r2 cm2. A
machinist is required to manufacture a circular metal disk having
area 400 cm2 within an error tolerance of ˙5 cm2. How close to 20 cm must the
machinist control the radius of the disk to achieve this?
Solution
The machinist wants jr2  400j < 5, that is,
400  5 < r2 < 400 C 5;
or, equivalently,
p
400  .5=/ < r <
p
400 C .5=/
19:96017 < r < 20:03975:
Thus, the machinist needs jr  20j < 0:03975; she must ensure that the radius of the
disk differs from 20 cm by less than 0:4 mm so that the area of the disk will lie within
the required error tolerance.
When we say that f .x/ has limit L as x approaches a, we are really saying that we
can ensure that the error jf .x/  Lj will be less than any allowed tolerance, no matter
how small, by taking x close enough to a (but not equal to a). It is traditional to use
, the Greek letter “epsilon,” for the size of the allowable error and ı, the Greek letter
“delta,” for the difference x  a that measures how close x must be to a to ensure that
the error is within that tolerance. These are the letters that Cauchy and Weierstrass
used in their pioneering work on limits and continuity in the nineteenth century.

The Formal Deﬁnition of Limit
89
If  is any positive number, no matter how small, we must be able to ensure that
jf .x/  Lj <  by restricting x to be close enough to (but not equal to) a. How close
is close enough? It is sufﬁcient that the distance jx  aj from x to a be less than a
positive number ı that depends on . (See Figure 1.35.) If we can ﬁnd such a ı for any
positive , we are entitled to conclude that lim
x!a f .x/ D L.
DEFINITION
8
A formal deﬁnition of limit
We say that f .x/ approaches the limit L as x approaches a, and we write
lim
x!a f .x/ D L
or
limx!af .x/ D L;
if the following condition is satisﬁed:
for every number  > 0 there exists a number ı > 0, possibly depending on
, such that if 0 < jx  aj < ı, then x belongs to the domain of f and
jf .x/  Lj < :
Though precise, the above
deﬁnition is more restrictive than
it needs to be. It requires that the
domain of f must contain open
intervals with right and left
endpoints at a. In Section 12.2 of
Chapter 12 we will give a new,
more general deﬁnition of limit
for functions of any number of
variables. For functions of one
variable, it replaces the
requirement that f be deﬁned on
open intervals with right and left
endpoints at a with the weaker
requirement that every open
interval containing a must
contain a point of the domain of
f different from a. For now, we
prefer the simpler but more
restrictive deﬁnition given above.
The formal deﬁnition of limit does not tell you how to ﬁnd the limit of a function, but
it does enable you to verify that a suspected limit is correct. The following examples
show how it can be used to verify limit statements for speciﬁc functions. The ﬁrst of
these gives a formal veriﬁcation of the two limits found in Example 3 of Section 1.2.
EXAMPLE 2
(Two important limits) Verify that:
(a) lim
x!a x D a
and
(b) lim
x!a k D k
(k = constant).
Solution
(a) Let  > 0 be given. We must ﬁnd ı > 0 so that
0 < jx  aj < ı
implies
jx  aj < :
Clearly, we can take ı D  and the implication above will be true. This proves that
lim
x!a x D a.
(b) Let  > 0 be given. We must ﬁnd ı > 0 so that
0 < jx  aj < ı
implies
jk  kj < :
Since k  k D 0, we can use any positive number for ı and the implication above
will be true. This proves that lim
x!a k D k.
EXAMPLE 3
Verify that lim
x!2 x2 D 4.
Solution
Here a D 2 and L D 4. Let  be a given positive number. We want to ﬁnd
ı > 0 so that if 0 < jx  2j < ı, then jf .x/  4j < . Now
jf .x/  4j D jx2  4j D j.x C 2/.x  2/j D jx C 2jjx  2j:
We want the expression above to be less than . We can make the factor jx  2j as
small as we wish by choosing ı properly, but we need to control the factor jx C 2j so
that it does not become too large. If we ﬁrst assume ı  1 and require that jx 2j < ı,
then we have
jx  2j < 1

jx  2j < ı  1:
But 5jx 2j <  if jx 2j < =5. Therefore, if we take ı D minf1; =5g, the minimum

jf .x/  4j < 5jx  2j < 5  

This proves that lim

Using the Deﬁnition of Limit to Prove Theorems
We do not usually rely on the formal deﬁnition of limit to verify speciﬁc limits such as
those in the two examples above. Rather, we appeal to general theorems about limits, in
particular Theorems 2–4 of Section 1.2. The deﬁnition is used to prove these theorems.
As an example, we prove part 1 of Theorem 2, the Sum Rule.

Other Kinds of Limits
The formal deﬁnition of limit can be modiﬁed to give precise deﬁnitions of one-sided
limits, limits at inﬁnity, and inﬁnite limits. We give some of the deﬁnitions here and
leave you to supply the others.

Right limits
We say that f .x/ has right limit L at a, and we write
lim
x!aC f .x/ D L;
if the following condition is satisﬁed:
for every number  > 0 there exists a number ı > 0, possibly depending on
, such that if a < x < a C ı, then x belongs to the domain of f and
jf .x/  Lj < :

a C ı in the right limit case (Figure 1.36). The deﬁnition for a left limit is formulated
in a similar way.
EXAMPLE 5
Show that lim
x!0C
px D 0.
Solution
Let  > 0 be given. If x > 0, then jpx  0j D px. We can ensure that
px <  by requiring x < 2. Thus, we can take ı D 2 and the condition of the
deﬁnition will be satisﬁed:
0 < x < ı D 2
implies
jpx  0j < :
Therefore, lim
x!0C
px D 0.
To claim that a function f has a limit L at inﬁnity, we must be able to ensure that
the error jf .x/  Lj is less than any given positive number  by restricting x to be
sufﬁciently large, that is, by requiring x > R for some positive number R depending
on .
DEFINITION
10
Limit at inﬁnity
We say that f .x/ approaches the limit L as x approaches inﬁnity, and we
write
lim
x!1 f .x/ D L;
if the following condition is satisﬁed:
for every number  > 0 there exists a number R, possibly depending on ,
such that if x > R, then x belongs to the domain of f and
jf .x/  Lj < :
You are invited to formulate a version of the deﬁnition of a limit at negative inﬁnity.

provided
x > 1
 :
Therefore, the condition of the deﬁnition is satisﬁed with R D 1=. We have shown
that lim
x!1 1=x D 0.

92
CHAPTER 1
Limits and Continuity
To show that f .x/ has an inﬁnite limit at a, we must ensure that f .x/ is larger than any
given positive number (say B) by restricting x to a sufﬁciently small interval centred
at a, and requiring that x ¤ a.
DEFINITION
11
Inﬁnite limits
We say that f .x/ approaches inﬁnity as x approaches a and write
lim
x!a f .x/ D 1;
if for every positive number B we can ﬁnd a positive number ı, possibly
depending on B, such that if 0 < jx  aj < ı, then x belongs to the domain
of f and f .x/ > B.
Try to formulate the corresponding deﬁnition for the concept limx!a f .x/ D 1.
Then try to modify both deﬁnitions to cover the case of inﬁnite one-sided limits and
inﬁnite limits at inﬁnity.
EXAMPLE 7

Introduction
Two fundamental problems are considered in calculus.
The problem of slopes is concerned with ﬁnding the slope
of (the tangent line to) a given curve at a given point on the curve. The problem of
areas is concerned with ﬁnding the area of a plane region bounded by curves and
straight lines. The solution of the problem of slopes is the subject of differential cal-
culus. As we will see, it has many applications in mathematics and other disciplines.
The problem of areas is the subject of integral calculus, which we begin in Chapter 5.
2.1
Tangent Lines and Their Slopes
This section deals with the problem of ﬁnding a straight line L that is tangent to a
curve C at a point P . As is often the case in mathematics, the most important step in
the solution of such a fundamental problem is making a suitable deﬁnition.
For simplicity, and to avoid certain problems best postponed until later, we will
not deal with the most general kinds of curves now, but only with those that are the
graphs of continuous functions. Let C be the graph of y D f .x/ and let P be the
point .x0; y0/ on C, so that y0 D f .x0/. We assume that P is not an endpoint of C.
Therefore, C extends some distance on both sides of P . (See Figure 2.1.)
What do we mean when we say that the line L is tangent to C at P ? Past experi-
ence with tangent lines to circles does not help us to deﬁne tangency for more general
curves. A tangent line to a circle at P has the following properties (see Figure 2.2):
(i) It meets the circle at only the one point P .
(ii) The circle lies on only one side of the line.

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
(iii) The tangent is perpendicular to the line joining the centre of the circle to P:
L
P
C
Figure 2.2
L is tangent to C at P
Most curves do not have obvious centres, so (iii) is useless for characterizing tangents
to them. The curves in Figure 2.3 show that (i) and (ii) cannot be used to deﬁne tan-
gency either. In particular, the curve in Figure 2.3(d) is not “smooth” at P; so that
curve should not have any tangent line there. A tangent line should have the “same
direction” as the curve does at the point of tangency.

(a) L meets C only at P but is not
tangent to C
(b) L meets C at several points but is
tangent to C at P
(c) L is tangent to C at P but crosses C
at P

none of them is tangent to C at P

A reasonable deﬁnition of tangency can be stated in terms of limits. If Q is a point
on C different from P , then the line through P and Q is called a secant line to the
curve. This line rotates around P as Q moves along the curve. If L is a line through
P whose slope is the limit of the slopes of these secant lines PQ as Q approaches P
along C (Figure 2.4), then we will say that L is tangent to C at P .

Since C is the graph of the function y D f .x/, then vertical lines can meet C only
once. Since P D .x0; f .x0//, a different point Q on the graph must have a different
x-coordinate, say x0 C h, where h ¤ 0. Thus Q D .x0 C h; f .x0 C h//, and the slope
of the line PQ is

EXAMPLE 2
Consider the graph of the function f .x/ D
3px D x1=3, which
is shown in Figure 2.6. The graph is a smooth curve, and it seems
evident that the y-axis is tangent to this curve at the origin. Let us try to calculate the

EXAMPLE 3
On the other hand, the function f .x/ D x2=3, whose graph is
shown in Figure 2.7, does not have a tangent line at the origin be-
cause it is not “smooth” there. In this case the Newton quotient is

which has no limit as h approaches zero. (The right limit is 1; the left limit is 1.)

This graph has no tangent at
the origin
We say this curve has a cusp at the origin. A cusp is an inﬁnitely sharp point; if you
were travelling along the curve, you would have to stop and turn 180ı at the origin.
In the light of the two preceding examples, we extend the deﬁnition of tangent line to
allow for vertical tangents as follows:
DEFINITION
2
Vertical tangents
If f is continuous at P D .x0; y0/, where y0 D f .x0/, and if either

h!0
f .x0 C h/  f .x0/
h

or
lim
h!0
f .x0 C h/  f .x0/
h
D 1;
then the vertical line x D x0 is tangent to the graph y D f .x/ at P . If the
limit of the Newton quotient fails to exist in any other way than by being 1
or 1, the graph y D f .x/ has no tangent line at P .
EXAMPLE 4
Does the graph of y D jxj have a tangent line at x D 0?
Solution
The Newton quotient here is
j0 C hj  j0j
h
D jhj
h D sgn h D

1;
if h > 0
1;
if h < 0:
Since sgn h has different right and left limits at 0 (namely, 1 and 1), the Newton quo-
tient has no limit as h ! 0, so y D jxj has no tangent line at .0; 0/. (See Figure 2.8.)
The graph does not have a cusp at the origin, but it is kinked at that point; it suddenly
changes direction and is not smooth. Curves have tangents only at points where they
are smooth. The graphs of y D x2=3 and y D jxj have tangent lines everywhere except
at the origin, where they are not smooth.

DEFINITION

The slope of a curve
The slope of a curve C at a point P is the slope of the tangent line to C at P
if such a tangent line exists. In particular, the slope of the graph of y D f .x/
at the point x0 is

Normals
If a curve C has a tangent line L at point P , then the straight line N through P
perpendicular to L is called the normal to C at P . If L is horizontal, then N is
vertical; if L is vertical, then N is horizontal. If L is neither horizontal nor vertical,
then, as shown in Section P.2, the slope of N is the negative reciprocal of the slope of
L; that is,
slope of the normal D

slope of the tangent:
EXAMPLE 6
Find an equation of the normal to y D x2 at .1; 1/.

By Example 1, the tangent to y D x2 at .1; 1/ has slope 2. Hence, the

If line L is tangent to curve C at point P , then the smaller
angle between L and the secant line PQ joining P to another
point Q on C approaches 0 as Q approaches P along C. Is
the converse true: if the angle between PQ and line L (which
passes through P ) approaches 0, must L be tangent to C?

2.2
The Derivative
A straight line has the property that its slope is the same at all points. For any other
graph, however, the slope may vary from point to point. Thus, the slope of the graph
of y D f .x/ at the point x is itself a function of x. At any point x where the graph
has a ﬁnite slope, we say that f is differentiable, and we call the slope the derivative
of f: The derivative is therefore the limit of the Newton quotient.
DEFINITION
4
The derivative of a function f is another function f 0 deﬁned by
f 0.x/ D lim
h!0
f .x C h/  f .x/
h
at all points x for which the limit exists (i.e., is a ﬁnite real number). If f 0.x/
exists, we say that f is differentiable at x.
The domain of the derivative f 0 (read “f prime”) is the set of numbers x in the domain
of f where the graph of f has a nonvertical tangent line, and the value f 0.x0/ of f 0
at such a point x0 is the slope of the tangent line to y D f .x/ there. Thus, the equation
of the tangent line to y D f .x/ at .x0; f .x0// is

SECTION 2.2:
The Derivative
101
y D f .x0/ C f 0.x0/.x  x0/:
The domain D.f 0/ of f 0 may be smaller than the domain D.f / of f because it
contains only those points in D.f / at which f is differentiable. Values of x in D.f /
where f is not differentiable and that are not endpoints of D.f / are singular points
of f:
Remark
The value of the derivative of f at a particular point x0 can be expressed as
a limit in either of two ways:
f 0.x0/ D lim
h!0
f .x0 C h/  f .x0/
h
D lim
x!x0
f .x/  f .x0/
x  x0
:
In the second limit x0 Ch is replaced by x, so that h D x x0 and h ! 0 is equivalent
to x ! x0.
The process of calculating the derivative f 0 of a given function f is called differ-
entiation. The graph of f 0 can often be sketched directly from that of f by visualizing
slopes, a procedure called graphical differentiation. In Figure 2.10 the graphs of f 0
and g0 were obtained by measuring the slopes at the corresponding points in the graphs
of f and g lying above them. The height of the graph y D f 0.x/ at x is the slope of
the graph of y D f .x/ at x. Note that 1 and 1 are singular points of f: Although
f .1/ and f .1/ are deﬁned, f 0.1/ and f 0.1/ are not deﬁned; the graph of f has no
tangent at 1 or at 1.

A function is differentiable on a set S if it is differentiable at every point x in S.
Typically, the functions we encounter are deﬁned on intervals or unions of intervals. If
f is deﬁned on a closed interval Œa; b, Deﬁnition 4 does not allow for the existence
of a derivative at the endpoints x D a or x D b. (Why?) As we did for continuity in
Section 1.4, we extend the deﬁnition to allow for a right derivative at x D a and a left
derivative at x D b:

Some Important Derivatives
We now give several examples of the calculation of derivatives algebraically from the
deﬁnition of derivative. Some of these are the basic building blocks from which more
complicated derivatives can be calculated later. They are collected in Table 1 later in
this section and should be memorized.
EXAMPLE 1

An important special case of Example 1 says that the derivative of a constant function
is the zero function:
If g.x/ D c (constant),
then
g0.x/ D 0.

The three derivative formulas calculated in Example 2 are special cases of the following
General Power Rule:
If f .x/ D xr,
then
f 0.x/ D r xr1.
This formula, which we will verify in Section 3.3, is valid for all values of r and x for
which xr1 makes sense as a real number.

Eventually, we will prove all appropriate cases of the General Power Rule. For the time
being, here is a proof of the case r D n, a positive integer, based on the factoring of a
difference of nth powers:

CHAPTER 2

An alternative proof based on the product rule and mathematical induction will be
given in Section 2.3. The factorization method used above can also be used to demon-
strate the General Power Rule for negative integers, r D n, and reciprocals of inte-
gers, r D 1=n. (See Exercises 52 and 54 at the end of this section.)

Thus, from Example 1 above, f 0.x/ D 1 if x > 0 and f 0.x/ D 1 if x < 0. Also,
Example 4 of Section 2.1 shows that f is not differentiable at x D 0, which is a
singular point of f . Therefore (see Figure 2.15),

Table 1 lists the elementary derivatives calculated above. Beginning in Section 2.3
we will develop general rules for calculating the derivatives of functions obtained by
combining simpler functions. Thereafter, we will seldom have to revert to the deﬁnition
of the derivative and to the calculation of limits to evaluate derivatives. It is important,
therefore, to remember the derivatives of some elementary functions. Memorize those
in Table 1.

Leibniz Notation
Because functions can be written in different ways, it is useful to have more than one
notation for derivatives. If y D f .x/, we can use the dependent variable y to represent
the function, and we can denote the derivative of the function with respect to x in any
of the following ways:
Dxy D y0 D dy
dx D d
dx f .x/ D f 0.x/ D Dxf .x/ D Df .x/:

SECTION 2.2:
The Derivative
105
(In the forms using “Dx,” we can omit the subscript x if the variable of differentiation
is obvious.) Often the most convenient way of referring to the derivative of a function
given explicitly as an expression in the variable x is to write d
dx in front of that expres-
sion. The symbol
d
dx is a differential operator and should be read “the derivative with
respect to x of : : : ” For example,

The notations dy=dx and d
dx f .x/ are called Leibniz notations for the derivative, after
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), one of the creators of calculus, who used such
notations. The main ideas of calculus were developed independently by Leibniz and
Isaac Newton (1642–1727); Newton used notations similar to the prime .y0/ notations
we use here.

106
CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
The Leibniz notation is suggested by the deﬁnition of derivative. The Newton
quotient Œf .x C h/  f .x/=h, whose limit we take to ﬁnd the derivative dy=dx, can
be written in the form y=x, where y D f .x C h/  f .x/ is the increment in y,
and x D .x C h/  x D h is the corresponding increment in x as we pass from the
point .x; f .x// to the point .x C h; f .x C h// on the graph of f: (See Figure 2.16.)

Differentials
The Newton quotient y=x is actually the quotient of two quantities, y and x.
It is not at all clear, however, that the derivative dy=dx, the limit of y=x as x
approaches zero, can be regarded as a quotient. If y is a continuous function of x, then
y approaches zero when x approaches zero, so dy=dx appears to be the meaning-
less quantity 0=0. Nevertheless, it is sometimes useful to be able to refer to quantities
dy and dx in such a way that their quotient is the derivative dy=dx. We can justify
this by regarding dx as a new independent variable (called the differential of x) and
deﬁning a new dependent variable dy (the differential of y) as a function of x and
dx by
dy D dy
dx dx D f 0.x/ dx:
For example, if y D x2, we can write dy D 2x dx to mean the same thing as
dy=dx D 2x. Similarly, if f .x/ D 1=x, we can write df .x/ D .1=x2/ dx as
the equivalent differential form of the assertion that .d=dx/f .x/ D f 0.x/ D 1=x2.
This differential notation is useful in applications (see Sections 2.7 and 12.6), and
especially for the interpretation and manipulation of integrals beginning in Chapter 5.
Note that, deﬁned as above, differentials are merely variables that may or may not
be small in absolute value. The differentials dy and dx were originally regarded (by
Leibniz and his successors) as “inﬁnitesimals” (inﬁnitely small but nonzero) quantities
whose quotient dy=dx gave the slope of the tangent line (a secant line meeting the
graph of y D f .x/ at two points inﬁnitely close together). It can be shown that such
“inﬁnitesimal” quantities cannot exist (as real numbers). It is possible to extend the
number system to contain inﬁnitesimals and use these to develop calculus, but we will
not consider this approach here.

SECTION 2.2:
The Derivative
107
Derivatives Have the Intermediate-Value Property
Is a function f deﬁned on an interval I necessarily the derivative of some other func-
tion deﬁned on I? The answer is no; some functions are derivatives and some are not.
Although a derivative need not be a continuous function (see Exercise 28 in Section
2.8), it must, like a continuous function, have the intermediate-value property: on an
interval Œa; b, a derivative f 0.x/ takes on every value between f 0.a/ and f 0.b/. (See
Exercise 29 in Section 2.8 for a proof of this fact.) An everywhere-deﬁned step func-
tion such as the Heaviside function H.x/ considered in Example 1 in Section 1.4 (see
Figure 2.17) does not have this property on, say, the interval Œ1; 1, so cannot be the
derivative of a function on that interval. This argument does not apply to the signum

function, which is the derivative of the absolute value function on any interval where
it is deﬁned. (See Example 4.) Such an interval cannot contain the origin, as sgn .x/ is
not deﬁned at x D 0.
If g.x/ is continuous on an interval I, then g.x/ D f 0.x/ for some function f
that is differentiable on I. We will discuss this fact further in Chapter 5 and prove it in
Appendix IV.

Differentiation Rules
If every derivative had to be calculated directly from the deﬁnition of derivative as in
the examples of Section 2.2, calculus would indeed be a painful subject. Fortunately,
there is an easier way. We will develop several general differentiation rules that en-
able us to calculate the derivatives of complicated combinations of functions easily
if we already know the derivatives of the elementary functions from which they are
constructed. For instance, we will be able to ﬁnd the derivative of
x2
p
x2 C 1
if we
know the derivatives of x2 and px. The rules we develop in this section tell us how
to differentiate sums, constant multiples, products, and quotients of functions whose
derivatives we already know. In Section 2.4 we will learn how to differentiate compos-
ite functions.

SECTION 2.3:
Differentiation Rules
109
Before developing these differentiation rules we need to establish one obvious
but very important theorem which states, roughly, that the graph of a function cannot
possibly have a break at a point where it is smooth.
T H E O R E M

Differentiability implies continuity
If f is differentiable at x, then f is continuous at x.
PROOF
Since f is differentiable at x, we know that
lim
h!0
f .x C h/  f .x/
h
D f 0.x/
exists. Using the limit rules (Theorem 2 of Section 1.2), we have
lim

f .x C h/  f .x/

D lim
h!0
f .x C h/  f .x/
h

.h/ D

f 0.x/

.0/ D 0:
This is equivalent to limh!0 f .x C h/ D f .x/, which says that f is continuous at x.
Sums and Constant Multiples
The derivative of a sum (or difference) of functions is the sum (or difference) of the
derivatives of those functions. The derivative of a constant multiple of a function is
the same constant multiple of the derivative of the function.
T H E O R E M
2
Differentiation rules for sums, differences, and constant multiples
If functions f and g are differentiable at x, and if C is a constant, then the functions
f C g, f  g, and Cf are all differentiable at x and
.f C g/0.x/ D f 0.x/ C g0.x/;
.f  g/0.x/ D f 0.x/  g0.x/;
.Cf /0.x/ D Cf 0.x/:
PROOF
The proofs of all three assertions are straightforward, using the correspond-
ing limit rules from Theorem 2 of Section 1.2. For the sum, we have
.f C g/0.x/ D lim
h!0
.f C g/.x C h/  .f C g/.x/
h
D lim
h!0
.f .x C h/ C g.x C h//  .f .x/ C g.x//

h!0
f .x C h/  f .x/
h
C g.x C h/  g.x/
h

D f 0.x/ C g0.x/;
because the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. The proof for the difference f  g
is similar. For the constant multiple, we have
.Cf /0.x/ D lim
h!0
Cf .x C h/  Cf .x/

D C lim

To see this we can use a technique called mathematical induction. (See the note in
the margin.) Theorem 2 shows that the case n D 2 is true; this is STEP 1. For STEP 2,
we must show that if the formula ./ holds for some integer n D k  2, then it must
also hold for n D k C 1. Therefore, assume that
.f1 C f2 C    C fk/0 D f 0

Then we have
Mathematical Induction
Mathematical induction is a
technique for proving that a
statement about an integer n is
true for every integer n greater
than or equal to some starting
integer n0. The proof requires us
to carry out two steps:
STEP 1. Prove that the statement
is true for n D n0.
STEP 2. Prove that if the
statement is true for some integer
n D k, where k  n0, then it is
also true for the next larger
integer, n D k C 1.
Step 2 prevents there from being
a smallest integer greater than n0
for which the statement is false.
Being true for n0, the statement
must therefore be true for all
larger integers.

its terms.

The Product Rule
The rule for differentiating a product of functions is a little more complicated than that
for sums. It is not true that the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives.

SECTION 2.3:
Differentiation Rules
111
T H E O R E M

The Product Rule
If functions f and g are differentiable at x, then their product fg is also differentiable
at x, and
.fg/0.x/ D f 0.x/g.x/ C f .x/g0.x/:
PROOF
We set up the Newton quotient for fg and then add 0 to the numerator in a
way that enables us to involve the Newton quotients for f and g separately:
.fg/0.x/ D lim
h!0
f .x C h/g.x C h/  f .x/g.x/

D f 0.x/g.x/ C f .x/g0.x/:
To get the last line, we have used the fact that f and g are differentiable and the fact
that g is therefore continuous (Theorem 1), as well as limit rules from Theorem 2 of
Section 1.2. A graphical proof of the Product Rule is suggested by Figure 2.19.

EXAMPLE 6
Use mathematical induction to verify the formula d
dx xn D n xn1
for all positive integers n.
Solution
For n D 1 the formula says that
d
dx x1 D 1 D 1x0, so the formula is true in
this case. We must show that if the formula is true for n D k  1, then it is also true
for n D k C 1. Therefore, assume that
d
dx xk D kxk1:
Using the Product Rule we calculate
d
dx xkC1 D d
dx

xkx

D .kxk1/.x/C.xk/.1/ D .kC1/xk D .kC1/x.kC1/1:
Thus, the formula is true for n D k C 1 also. The formula is true for all integers n  1
by induction.
The Product Rule can be extended to products of any number of factors; for instance,
.fgh/0.x/ D f 0.x/.gh/.x/ C f .x/.gh/0.x/
D f 0.x/g.x/h.x/ C f .x/g0.x/h.x/ C f .x/g.x/h0.x/:
In general, the derivative of a product of n functions will have n terms; each term will
be the same product but with one of the factors replaced by its derivative:
.f1f2f3    fn/0 D f 0
1f2f3    fn C f1f 0
2f3    fn C    C f1f2f3    f 0

This can be proved by mathematical induction. See Exercise 54 at the end of this
section.

In all three parts of Example 9, the Quotient Rule yielded fractions with numerators
that were complicated but could be simpliﬁed algebraically. It is advisable to attempt
such simpliﬁcations when calculating derivatives; the usefulness of derivatives in ap-
plications of calculus often depends on such simpliﬁcations.
EXAMPLE 10
Find equations of any lines that pass through the point .1; 0/ and
are tangent to the curve y D .x  1/=.x C 1/.

The point .1; 0/ does not lie on the curve, so it is not the point of tangency.
Suppose a line is tangent to the curve at x D a, so the point of tangency is .a; .a

Remark
Derivatives of quotients of functions where the denominator is a monomial,
such as in Example 8, are usually easier to do by breaking the quotient into a sum of
several fractions (as was done in that example) rather than by using the Quotient Rule.

2.4
The Chain Rule
Although we can differentiate px and x2 C 1, we cannot yet differentiate
p
x2 C 1.
To do this, we need a rule that tells us how to differentiate composites of functions
whose derivatives we already know. This rule is known as the Chain Rule and is the
most often used of all the differentiation rules.
EXAMPLE 1
The function
1
x2  4 is the composite f .g.x// of f .u/ D 1
u and
g.x/ D x2  4, which have derivatives
f 0.u/ D 1
u2
and
g0.x/ D 2x:
According to the Reciprocal Rule (which is a special case of the Chain Rule),

D
2x
.x2  4/2 D
1
.x2  4/2 .2x/
D f 0.g.x//g0.x/:
This example suggests that the derivative of a composite function f .g.x// is the
derivative of f evaluated at g.x/ multiplied by the derivative of g evaluated at x.
This is the Chain Rule:
d
dx f .g.x// D f 0.g.x// g0.x/:
T H E O R E M
6
The Chain Rule
If f .u/ is differentiable at u D g.x/, and g.x/ is differentiable at x, then the compos-
ite function f ı g.x/ D f .g.x// is differentiable at x, and
.f ı g/0.x/ D f 0.g.x//g0.x/:
In terms of Leibniz notation, if y D f .u/ where u D g.x/, then y D f .g.x// and:
at u, y is changing dy
du times as fast as u is changing;
at x, u is changing du
dx times as fast as x is changing.
Therefore, at x, y D f .u/ D f .g.x// is changing dy
du  du
dx times as fast as x is
changing. That is,

SECTION 2.4:
The Chain Rule
117
dy
dx D dy

where dy
du is evaluated at u D g.x/.
It appears as though the symbol du cancels from the numerator and denominator, but
this is not meaningful because dy=du was not deﬁned as the quotient of two quantities,
but rather as a single quantity, the derivative of y with respect to u.
We would like to prove Theorem 6 by writing
y
x D y
u
u
x
and taking the limit as x ! 0. Such a proof is valid for most composite functions
but not all. (See Exercise 46 at the end of this section.) A correct proof will be given
later in this section, but ﬁrst we do more examples to get a better idea of how the Chain
Rule works.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the derivative of y D

Here y D f .g.x//, where f .u/ D pu and g.x/ D x2 C 1. Since the
derivatives of f and g are

Outside and Inside Functions
In the composite f .g.x//, the
function f is “outside,” and the
function g is “inside.” The Chain
Rule says that the derivative of
the composite is the derivative
f 0 of the outside function
evaluated at the inside function
g.x/, multiplied by the
derivative g0.x/ of the inside
function:
d
dx f .g.x// D f 0.g.x//g0.x/.
Usually, when applying the Chain Rule, we do not introduce symbols to represent
the functions being composed, but rather just proceed to calculate the derivative of the
“outside” function and then multiply by the derivative of whatever is “inside.” You can
say to yourself: “the derivative of f of something is f 0 of that thing, multiplied by the
derivative of that thing.”

d

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
(c) Here, we will need to use the Chain Rule twice. We begin by differentiating the
1=4 power of something, but the something involves the 3rd power of 2x C 1,
and the derivative of that will also require the Chain Rule:

line or two by carrying out the whole differentiation in one step:

Use of the Chain Rule produces products of factors that do not usually come out in the
order you would naturally write them. Often you will want to rewrite the result with the
factors in a different order. This is obvious in parts (a) and (c) of the example above. In
monomials (expressions that are products of factors), it is common to write the factors
in order of increasing complexity from left to right, with numerical factors coming
ﬁrst. One time when you would not waste time doing this, or trying to make any other
simpliﬁcation, is when you are going to evaluate the derivative at a particular number.
In this case, substitute the number as soon as you have calculated the derivative, before
doing any simpliﬁcation:

Finding Derivatives with Maple

Computer algebra systems know the derivatives of elementary functions and can cal-
culate the derivatives of combinations of these functions symbolically, using differen-
tiation rules. Maple’s D operator can be used to ﬁnd the derivative function D(f) of a
function f of one variable. Alternatively, you can use diff to differentiate an expres-
sion with respect to a variable and then use the substitution routine subs to evaluate
the result at a particular number.

if k ¤ 0:
By the deﬁnition of derivative, limk!0 E.k/ D f 0.u/  f 0.u/ D 0 D E.0/, so E.k/

Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
The trigonometric functions, especially sine and cosine, play a very important role in
the mathematical modelling of real-world phenomena. In particular, they arise when-
ever quantities ﬂuctuate in a periodic way. Elastic motions, vibrations, and waves of all
kinds naturally involve the trigonometric functions, and many physical and mechanical
laws are formulated as differential equations having these functions as solutions.
In this section we will calculate the derivatives of the six trigonometric functions.
We only have to work hard for one of them, sine; the others then follow from known
identities and the differentiation rules of Section 2.3.
Some Special Limits
First, we have to establish some trigonometric limits that we will need to calculate the
derivative of sine. It is assumed throughout that the arguments of the trigonometric
functions are measured in radians.

The functions sin  and cos  are continuous at every value of . In particular, at  D 0
we have:

and

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
This result is obvious from the graphs of sine and cosine, so we will not prove it here. A
proof can be based on the Squeeze Theorem (Theorem 4 of Section 1.2). The method
is suggested in Exercise 62 at the end of this section.
The graph of the function y D .sin /= is shown in Figure 2.20. Although it is
not deﬁned at  D 0, this function appears to have limit 1 as  approaches 0.

Now take reciprocals, thereby reversing the inequalities:
1 > sin

Since lim!0C cos  D 1 by Theorem 7, the Squeeze Theorem gives
lim

sin 

D 1:
Finally, note that sin  and  are odd functions. Therefore, f ./ D .sin /= is an
even function: f ./ D f ./, as shown in Figure 2.20. This symmetry implies that
the left limit at 0 must have the same value as the right limit:

so lim!0.sin /= D 1 by Theorem 1 of Section 1.2.
Theorem 8 can be combined with limit rules and known trigonometric identities to
yield other trigonometric limits.

The six trigonometric functions
are differentiable and, therefore,
continuous (by Theorem 1)
everywhere on their domains.
This means that we can calculate
the limits of most trigonometric
functions as x ! a by
evaluating them at x D a.

Reciprocal Rules and are as follows:

Higher-Order Derivatives
If the derivative y0 D f 0.x/ of a function y D f .x/ is itself differentiable at x, we
can calculate its derivative, which we call the second derivative of f and denote by
y00 D f 00.x/. As is the case for ﬁrst derivatives, second derivatives can be denoted by
various notations depending on the context. Some of the more common ones are

y00 D f 00.x/ D d 2y
dx2 D d
dx
d
dx f .x/ D d 2
dx2 f .x/ D D2
xy D D2
xf .x/:
Similarly, you can consider third-, fourth-, and in general nth-order derivatives. The
prime notation is inconvenient for derivatives of high order, so we denote the order by
a superscript in parentheses (to distinguish it from an exponent): the nth derivative of
y D f .x/ is
y.n/ D f .n/.x/ D d ny
dxn D d n
dxn f .x/ D Dn
xy D Dn
xf .x/;
and it is deﬁned to be the derivative of the .n  1/st derivative. For n D 1; 2; and 3,
primes are still normally used: f .2/.x/ D f 00.x/; f .3/.x/ D f 000.x/. It is sometimes
convenient to denote f .0/.x/ D f .x/, that is, to regard a function as its own zeroth-
order derivative.
EXAMPLE 1
The velocity of a moving object is the (instantaneous) rate of change
of the position of the object with respect to time; if the object
moves along the x-axis and is at position x D f .t/ at time t, then its velocity at that
time is
v D dx
dt D f 0.t/:
Similarly, the acceleration of the object is the rate of change of the velocity. Thus, the
acceleration is the second derivative of the position:
a D dv
dt D d 2x
dt2 D f 00.t/:
We will investigate the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration fur-
ther in Section 2.11.

it is clearly correct for n D 1; 2; 3; and 4. To complete the proof we use mathematical
induction (Section 2.3). Suppose that the formula is valid for n D k, where k is some
positive integer. Consider y.kC1/:

This is what the formula predicts for the .k C 1/st derivative. Therefore, if the formula
for y.n/ is correct for n D k, then it is also correct for n D k C 1. Since the formula
is known to be true for n D 1, it must therefore be true for every integer n  1 by
induction.

formula for f .4/.x/ without having to calculate it. In fact,
f .4/.x/ D 3.4x2  1/.x2 C 1/7=2;
so the pattern (if there is one) doesn’t become any clearer at this stage.

Remark
Computing higher-order derivatives may be useful in applications involv-
ing Taylor polynomials (see Section 4.10). As taking derivatives can be automated
with a known algorithm, it makes sense to use a computer to calculate higher-order
ones. However, depending on the function, the amount of memory and processor time
needed may severely restrict the order of derivatives calculated in this way. Higher-
order derivatives can be indicated in Maple by repeating the variable of differentiation
or indicating the order by using the $ operator:

Using Differentials and Derivatives
In this section we will look at some examples of ways in which derivatives are used
to represent and interpret changes and rates of change in the world around us. It is
natural to think of change in terms of dependence on time, such as the velocity of
a moving object, but there is no need to be so restrictive. Change with respect to
variables other than time can be treated in the same way. For example, a physician
may want to know how small changes in dosage can affect the body’s response to a
drug. An economist may want to study how foreign investment changes with respect to
variations in a country’s interest rates. These questions can all be formulated in terms
of rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.
Approximating Small Changes
If one quantity, say y, is a function of another quantity x, that is,
y D f .x/;
we sometimes want to know how a change in the value of x by an amount x will
affect the value of y. The exact change y in y is given by
y D f .x C x/  f .x/;

132
CHAPTER 2

but if the change x is small, then we can get a good approximation to y by using
the fact that y=x is approximately the derivative dy=dx. Thus,
y D y
x x  dy
dx x D f 0.x/ x:
It is often convenient to represent this approximation in terms of differentials; if we
denote the change in x by dx instead of x, then the change y in y is approximated
by the differential dy, that is (see Figure 2.25),
y  dy D f 0.x/ dx:

Whenever one makes an approximation it is wise to try and estimate how big the error
might be. We will have more to say about such approximations and their error estimates
in Section 4.9.
Sometimes changes in a quantity are measured with respect to the size of the
quantity. The relative change in x is the ratio dx=x if x changes by amount dx. The
percentage change in x is the relative change expressed as a percentage:
relative change in x = dx

percentage change in x = 100 dx

Average and Instantaneous Rates of Change
Recall the concept of average rate of change of a function over an interval, introduced
in Section 1.1. The derivative of the function is the limit of this average rate as the
length of the interval goes to zero, and so represents the rate of change of the function
at a given value of its variable.
DEFINITION
5
The average rate of change of a function f .x/ with respect to x over the
interval from a to a C h is
f .a C h/  f .a/
h
:
The (instantaneous) rate of change of f with respect to x at x D a is the
derivative
f 0.a/ D lim
h!0
f .a C h/  f .a/
h
;
provided the limit exists.
It is conventional to use the word instantaneous even when x does not represent time,
although the word is frequently omitted. When we say rate of change, we mean instan-
taneous rate of change.
EXAMPLE 3
How fast is area A of a circle increasing with respect to its radius
when the radius is 5 m?
Solution
The rate of change of the area with respect to the radius is
dA
dr D d
dr .r2/ D 2 r:
When r D 5 m, the area is changing at the rate 2  5 D 10 m2/m. This means that
a small change r m in the radius when the radius is 5 m would result in a change of
about 10r m2 in the area of the circle.

134
CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
The above example suggests that the appropriate units for the rate of change of a quan-
tity y with respect to another quantity x are units of y per unit of x.
If f 0.x0/ D 0, we say that f is stationary at x0 and call x0 a critical point of f:
The corresponding point .x0; f .x0// on the graph of f is also called a critical point
of the graph. The graph has a horizontal tangent at a critical point, and f may or may
not have a maximum or minimum value there. (See Figure 2.26.) It is still possible for
f to be increasing or decreasing on an open interval containing a critical point. (See
point a in Figure 2.26.) We will revisit these ideas in the next section.

How fast is the temperature rising or falling at 1:00 p.m.? At 3:00 p.m.? At what

dT

If t D 1, then dT

The temperature is stationary when dT
dt D 0, that is, at 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Sensitivity to Change
When a small change in x produces a large change in the value of a function f .x/,
we say that the function is very sensitive to changes in x. The derivative f 0.x/ is a
measure of the sensitivity of the dependence of f on x.

about 1.25 mm Hg.
Derivatives in Economics
Just as physicists use terms such as velocity and acceleration to refer to derivatives of
certain quantities, economists also have their own specialized vocabulary for deriva-
tives. They call them marginals. In economics the term marginal denotes the rate of
change of a quantity with respect to a variable on which it depends. For example, the
cost of production C.x/ in a manufacturing operation is a function of x, the number
of units of product produced. The marginal cost of production is the rate of change
of C with respect to x, so it is dC=dx. Sometimes the marginal cost of production is
loosely deﬁned to be the extra cost of producing one more unit; that is,
C D C.x C 1/  C.x/:
To see why this is approximately correct, observe from Figure 2.27 that if the slope of
C D C.x/ does not change quickly near x, then the difference quotient C=x will
be close to its limit, the derivative dC=dx, even if x D 1.

EXAMPLE 6
(Marginal tax rates) If your marginal income tax rate is 35%
and your income increases by $1,000, you can expect to have to
pay an extra $350 in income taxes. This does not mean that you pay 35% of your entire
income in taxes. It just means that at your current income level I, the rate of increase
of taxes T with respect to income is dT=dI D 0:35. You will pay $0.35 out of every
extra dollar you earn in taxes. Of course, if your income increases greatly, you may
land in a higher tax bracket and your marginal rate will increase.

x D 2;000, the average cost per tonne is C.2;000/=2;000 D $13:50/tonne.
(b) The marginal cost of production is

If x D 1;000, the marginal cost is C 0.1;000/ D $9:40/tonne. If x D 2;000, the
marginal cost is C 0.2;000/ D $25:40/tonne.
(c) If the production level x is increased slightly from x D 1;000, then the average
cost per tonne will drop because the cost is increasing at a rate lower than the
average cost. At x D 2;000 the opposite is true; an increase in production will
increase the average cost per tonne.
Economists sometimes prefer to measure relative rates of change that do not depend
on the units used to measure the quantities involved. They use the term elasticity for
such relative rates.
EXAMPLE 8
(Elasticity of demand) The demand y for a certain product (i.e.,
the amount that can be sold) typically depends on the price p
charged for the product: y D f .p/. The marginal demand dy=dp D f 0.p/ (which is
typically negative) depends on the units used to measure y and p. The elasticity of the
demand is the quantity
p
y
dy
dp
(the “” sign ensures elasticity is positive),
which is independent of units and provides a good measure of the sensitivity of demand
to changes in price. To see this, suppose that new units of demand and price are
introduced, which are multiples of the old units. In terms of the new units the demand
and price are now Y and P , where
Y D k1y
and
P D k2p:
Thus, Y D k1f .P=k2/ and dY=dP D .k1=k2/f 0.P=k2/ D .k1=k2/f 0.p/ by the
Chain Rule. It follows that the elasticity has the same value:

The Mean-Value Theorem
If you set out in a car at 1:00 p.m. and arrive in a town 150 km away from your
starting point at 3:00 p.m., then you have travelled at an average speed of 150=2 D
75 km/h. Although you may not have travelled at constant speed, you must have
been going 75 km/h at at least one instant during your journey, for if your speed
was always less than 75 km/h you would have gone less than 150 km in 2 h, and
if your speed was always more than 75 km/h, you would have gone more than 150
km in 2 h. In order to get from a value less than 75 km/h to a value greater than
75 km/h, your speed, which is a continuous function of time, must pass through the
value 75 km/h at some intermediate time.
The conclusion that the average speed over a time interval must be equal to the
instantaneous speed at some time in that interval is an instance of an important math-
ematical principle. In geometric terms it says that if A and B are two points on a
smooth curve, then there is at least one point C on the curve between A and B where
the tangent line is parallel to the chord line AB. See Figure 2.28.

The Mean-Value Theorem
Suppose that the function f is continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b
 and that
it is differentiable on the open interval .a; b/. Then there exists a point c in the open
interval .a; b/ such that
f .b/  f .a/
b  a
D f 0.c/:
This says that the slope of the chord line joining the points .a; f .a// and .b; f .b// is
equal to the slope of the tangent line to the curve y D f .x/ at the point .c; f .c//, so
the two lines are parallel.
We will prove the Mean-Value Theorem later in this section. For now we make several
observations:
1. The hypotheses of the Mean-Value Theorem are all necessary for the conclusion;
if f fails to be continuous at even one point of Œa; b
 or fails to be differentiable

SECTION 2.8:
The Mean-Value Theorem
139
at even one point of .a; b/, then there may be no point where the tangent line is
parallel to the secant line AB. (See Figure 2.29.)
2. The Mean-Value Theorem gives no indication of how many points C there may
be on the curve between A and B where the tangent is parallel to AB. If the curve
is itself the straight line AB, then every point on the line between A and B has the
required property. In general, there may be more than one point (see Figure 2.30);
the Mean-Value Theorem asserts only that there must be at least one.

which it says must exist. For some simple functions it is possible to calculate c
(see the following example), but doing so is usually of no practical value. As we
shall see, the importance of the Mean-Value Theorem lies in its use as a theoret-
ical tool. It belongs to a class of theorems called existence theorems, as do the
Max-Min Theorem and the Intermediate-Value Theorem (Theorems 8 and 9 of
Section 1.4).

transposing the 1.
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
Intervals on which the graph of a function f has positive or negative slope provide
useful information about the behaviour of f . The Mean-Value Theorem enables us to
determine such intervals by considering the sign of the derivative f 0.

Increasing and decreasing functions
Suppose that the function f is deﬁned on an interval I and that x1 and x2 are
two points of I.
(a)
If f .x2/ > f .x1/ whenever x2 > x1, we say f is increasing on I:
(b)
If f .x2/ < f .x1/ whenever x2 > x1, we say f is decreasing on I:
(c)
If f .x2/  f .x1/ whenever x2 > x1, we say f is nondecreasing on I:
(d)
If f .x2/  f .x1/ whenever x2 > x1, we say f is nonincreasing on I:
Figure 2.31 illustrates these terms. Note the distinction between increasing and non-
decreasing. If a function is increasing (or decreasing) on an interval, it must take differ-
ent values at different points. (Such a function is called one-to-one.) A nondecreasing
function (or a nonincreasing function) may be constant on a subinterval of its domain,
and may therefore not be one-to-one. An increasing function is nondecreasing, but a
nondecreasing function is not necessarily increasing.

Let x1 and x2 be points in I with x2 > x1. By the Mean-Value Theorem
there exists a point c in .x1; x2/ (and therefore in J ) such that
f .x2/  f .x1/
x2  x1
D f 0.c/I
hence, f .x2/  f .x1/ D .x2  x1/ f 0.c/. Since x2  x1 > 0, the difference f .x2/ 
f .x1/ has the same sign as f 0.c/ and may be zero if f 0.c/ is zero. Thus, all four
conclusions follow from the corresponding parts of Deﬁnition 6.
Remark
Despite Theorem 12, f 0.x0/ > 0 at a single point x0 does not imply that f
is increasing on any interval containing x0. See Exercise 30 at the end of this section
for a counterexample.
EXAMPLE 4
On what intervals is the function f .x/ D x312xC1 increasing?
On what intervals is it decreasing?
Solution
We have f 0.x/ D 3x2  12 D 3.x  2/.x C 2/. Observe that f 0.x/ > 0
if x < 2 or x > 2 and f 0.x/ < 0 if 2 < x < 2. Therefore, f is increasing
on the intervals .1; 2/ and .2; 1/ and is decreasing on the interval .2; 2/. See
Figure 2.32.
A function f whose derivative satisﬁes f 0.x/  0 on an interval can still be increasing
there, rather than just nondecreasing as assured by Theorem 12(c). This will happen if
f 0.x/ D 0 only at isolated points, so that f is assured to be increasing on intervals to
the left and right of these points.

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
Solution
Let x1 and x2 be any two real numbers satsifying x1 < x2. Since f 0.x/ D
3x2 > 0 except at x D 0, Theorem 12(a) tells us that f .x1/ < f .x2/ if either x1 <
x2  0 or 0  x1 < x2. If x1 < 0 < x2, then f .x1/ < 0 < f .x2/. Thus, f is
increasing on every interval.
If a function is constant on an interval, then its derivative is zero on that interval.
The Mean-Value Theorem provides a converse of this fact.
T H E O R E M
13
If f is continuous on an interval I; and f 0.x/ D 0 at every interior point of I (i.e., at
every point of I that is not an endpoint of I), then f .x/ D C, a constant, on I:
PROOF
Pick a point x0 in I and let C D f .x0/. If x is any other point of I, then the
Mean-Value Theorem says that there exists a point c between x0 and x such that
f .x/  f .x0/
x  x0
D f 0.c/:
The point c must belong to I because an interval contains all points between any two of
its points, and c cannot be an endpoint of I since c ¤ x0 and c ¤ x. Since f 0.c/ D 0
for all such points c, we have f .x/f .x0/ D 0 for all x in I, and f .x/ D f .x0/ D C
as claimed.
We will see how Theorem 13 can be used to establish identities for new functions en-
countered in later chapters. We will also use it when ﬁnding antiderivatives in Section
2.10.
Proof of the Mean-Value Theorem
The Mean-Value Theorem is one of those deep results that is based on the completeness
of the real number system via the fact that a continuous function on a closed, ﬁnite
interval takes on a maximum and minimum value (Theorem 8 of Section 1.4). Before
giving the proof, we establish two preliminary results.
T H E O R E M
14
If f is deﬁned on an open interval .a; b/ and achieves a maximum (or minimum)
value at the point c in .a; b/, and if f 0.c/ exists, then f 0.c/ D 0. (Values of x where
f 0.x/ D 0 are called critical points of the function f .)
PROOF
Suppose that f has a maximum value at c. Then f .x/f .c/  0 whenever
x is in .a; b/. If c < x < b, then
f .x/  f .c/
x  c
 0;
so
f 0.c/ D lim
x!cC
f .x/  f .c/
x  c
 0:
Similarly, if a < x < c, then
f .x/  f .c/
x  c
 0;
so
f 0.c/ D lim
x!c
f .x/  f .c/
x  c
 0:
Thus f 0.c/ D 0. The proof for a minimum value at c is similar.

Rolle’s Theorem
Suppose that the function g is continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b and that
it is differentiable on the open interval .a; b/. If g.a/ D g.b/, then there exists a point
c in the open interval .a; b/ such that g0.c/ D 0.

SECTION 2.8:
The Mean-Value Theorem
143
PROOF
If g.x/ D g.a/ for every x in Œa; b, then g is a constant function, so g0.c/ D
0 for every c in .a; b/. Therefore, suppose there exists x in .a; b/ such that g.x/ ¤
g.a/. Let us assume that g.x/ > g.a/. (If g.x/ < g.a/, the proof is similar.) By
the Max-Min Theorem (Theorem 8 of Section 1.4), being continuous on Œa; b, g must
have a maximum value at some point c in Œa; b. Since g.c/  g.x/ > g.a/ D g.b/, c
cannot be either a or b. Therefore, c is in the open interval .a; b/, so g is differentiable
at c. By Theorem 14, c must be a critical point of g: g0.c/ D 0.
Remark
Rolle’s Theorem is a special case of the Mean-Value Theorem in which the
chord line has slope 0, so the corresponding parallel tangent line must also have slope
0. We can deduce the Mean-Value Theorem from this special case.

point c in .a; b/ such that g0.c/ D 0. Since

it follows that

If functions f and g are both continuous on Œa; b and differentiable on .a; b/, and if

Implicit Differentiation
We know how to ﬁnd the slope of a curve that is the graph of a function y D f .x/ by
calculating the derivative of f: But not all curves are the graphs of such functions. To
be the graph of a function f .x/, the curve must not intersect any vertical lines at more
than one point.
Curves are generally the graphs of equations in two variables. Such equations can
be written in the form
F.x; y/ D 0;
where F.x; y/ denotes an expression involving the two variables x and y. For example,
a circle with centre at the origin and radius 5 has equation
x2 C y2  25 D 0;
so F.x; y/ D x2 C y2  25 for that circle.
Sometimes we can solve an equation F.x; y/ D 0 for y and so ﬁnd explicit formu-
las for one or more functions y D f .x/ deﬁned by the equation. Usually, however, we
are not able to solve the equation. However, we can still regard it as deﬁning y as one
or more functions of x implicitly, even it we cannot solve for these functions explicitly.
Moreover, we still ﬁnd the derivative dy=dx of these implicit solutions by a technique
called implicit differentiation. The idea is to differentiate the given equation with
respect to x, regarding y as a function of x having derivative dy=dx, or y0.
EXAMPLE 1
Find dy=dx if y2 D x.
Solution
The equation y2 D x deﬁnes two differentiable functions of x; in this case
we know them explicitly. They are y1 D px and y2 D px (see Figure 2.34), having

regarding y as a function of x
and using the Chain Rule to
differentiate functions of y.
2. Collect terms with dy=dx on
one side of the equation and
solve for dy=dx by dividing
by its coefﬁcient.

This time we cannot solve the equation for y as an explicit function of x,
so we must use implicit differentiation:

SECTION 2.9:
Implicit Differentiation
147
In the examples above, the derivatives dy=dx calculated by implicit differentiation
depend on y, or on both y and x, rather than just on x. This is to be expected because
an equation in x and y can deﬁne more than one function of x, and the implicitly
calculated derivative must apply to each of the solutions. For example, in Example 2,
the derivative dy=dx D x=y also gives the slope 3=4 at the point .3; 4/ on the
circle. When you use implicit differentiation to ﬁnd the slope of a curve at a point, you
will usually have to know both coordinates of the point.
There are subtle dangers involved in calculating derivatives implicitly. When you
use the Chain Rule to differentiate an equation involving y with respect to x, you are
automatically assuming that the equation deﬁnes y as a differentiable function of x.
This need not be the case. To see what can happen, consider the problem of ﬁnding
y0 D dy=dx from the equation
x2 C y2 D K;
./
where K is a constant. As in Example 2 (where K D 25), implicit differentiation gives
2x C 2yy0 D 0
or
y0 D x
y :
This formula will give the slope of the curve ./ at any point on the curve where
y ¤ 0. For K > 0, ./ represents a circle centred at the origin and having radius
p
K. This circle has a ﬁnite slope, except at the two points where it crosses the x-axis
(where y D 0). If K D 0, the equation represents only a single point, the origin. The
concept of slope of a point is meaningless. For K < 0, there are no real points whose
coordinates satisfy equation ./, so y0 is meaningless here too. The point of this is
that being able to calculate y0 from a given equation by implicit differentiation does
not guarantee that y0 actually represents the slope of anything.
If .x0; y0/ is a point on the graph of the equation F.x; y/ D 0, there is a theorem
that can justify our use of implicit differentiation to ﬁnd the slope of the graph there.
We cannot give a careful statement or proof of this implicit function theorem yet (see
Section 12.8), but roughly speaking, it says that part of the graph of F.x; y/ D 0
near .x0; y0/ is the graph of a function of x that is differentiable at x0, provided that
F.x; y/ is a “smooth” function, and that the derivative
d

For the circle x2 C y2  K D 0 (where K > 0) this condition says that 2y0 ¤ 0,
which is the condition that the derivative y0 D x=y should exist at .x0; y0/.

A useful strategy
When you use implicit
differentiation to ﬁnd the value
of a derivative at a particular
point, it is best to substitute the
coordinates of the point

the differentiation and before you
solve for the derivative dy=dx. It
is easier to solve an equation
involving numbers than one with
algebraic expressions.

If the two curves (they are both hyperbolas if a ¤ 0 and b ¤ 0) intersect at .x0; y0/,

To get an expression depending only on x and y, we need to substitute the expression
obtained for the ﬁrst derivative into this result. Since the result of this substitution will
involve compound fractions, let us simplify the result as well.

This is y00 expressed as a function of x and y. Now we want to substitute the coor-
dinates x D 2, y.x/ D 1 to get the value of y00 at .2; 1/. However, the order of the
substitutions is important. First we must replace y.x/ with 1 and then replace x with
2. (If we replace x ﬁrst, we would have to then replace y.2/ rather than y.x/ with 1.)
Maple’s subs command makes the substitutions in the order they are written.

implicit differentiation, we can give the proof for any rational exponent r D m=n,
where m and n are integers, and n ¤ 0.

Antiderivatives and Initial-Value Problems
Throughout this chapter we have been concerned with the problem of ﬁnding the
derivative f 0 of a given function f . The reverse problem—given the derivative f 0,
ﬁnd f —is also interesting and important. It is the problem studied in integral calculus
and is generally more difﬁcult to solve than the problem of ﬁnding a derivative. We
will take a preliminary look at this problem in this section and will return to it in more
detail in Chapter 5.
Antiderivatives
We begin by deﬁning an antiderivative of a function f to be a function F whose
derivative is f: It is appropriate to require that F 0.x/ D f .x/ on an interval.
DEFINITION
7
An antiderivative of a function f on an interval I is another function F
satisfying
F 0.x/ D f .x/
for x in I.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) F.x/ D x is an antiderivative of the function f .x/ D 1 on any interval because
F 0.x/ D 1 D f .x/ everywhere.
(b) G.x/ D 1
2 x2 is an antiderivative of the function g.x/ D x on any interval because
G0.x/ D 1
2.2x/ D x D g.x/ everywhere.
(c) R.x/ D  1
3 cos.3x/ is an antiderivative of r.x/ D sin.3x/ on any interval be-
cause R0.x/ D  1
3.3 sin.3x// D sin.3x/ D r.x/ everywhere.
(d) F.x/ D 1=x is an antiderivative of f .x/ D 1=x2 on any interval not containing
x D 0 because F 0.x/ D 1=x2 D f .x/ everywhere except at x D 0.
Antiderivatives are not unique; since a constant has derivative zero, you can always
add any constant to an antiderivative F of a function f on an interval and get another
antiderivative of f on that interval. More importantly, all antiderivatives of f on an
interval can be obtained by adding constants to any particular one. If F and G are both

D f .x/  f .x/ D 0
on I; so G.x/  F.x/ D C (a constant) on I by Theorem 13 of Section 2.8. Thus,
G.x/ D F.x/ C C on I:
Note that neither this conclusion nor Theorem 13 is valid over a set that is not an
interval. For example, the derivative of
sgn x D
n 1
if x < 0
1
if x > 0
is 0 for all x ¤ 0, but sgn x is not constant for all x ¤ 0. sgn x has different constant
values on the two intervals .1; 0/ and .0; 1/ comprising its domain.
The Indeﬁnite Integral
The general antiderivative of a function f .x/ on an interval I is F.x/ C C, where
F.x/ is any particular antiderivative of f .x/ on I and C is a constant. This general
antiderivative is called the indeﬁnite integral of f .x/ on I and is denoted
R
f .x/ dx.
DEFINITION
8
The indeﬁnite integral of f .x/ on interval I is
Z
f .x/ dx D F.x/ C C
on I;
provided F 0.x/ D f .x/ for all x in I:
The symbol
R
is called an integral sign. It is shaped like an elongated “S” for reasons
that will only become apparent when we study the deﬁnite integral in Chapter 5. Just
as you regard dy=dx as a single symbol representing the derivative of y with respect
to x, so you should regard R f .x/ dx as a single symbol representing the indeﬁnite
integral (general antiderivative) of f with respect to x. The constant C is called a
constant of integration.

All three formulas above can be checked by differentiating the right-hand sides.
Finding antiderivatives is generally more difﬁcult than ﬁnding derivatives; many func-
tions do not have antiderivatives that can be expressed as combinations of ﬁnitely many
elementary functions. However, every formula for a derivative can be rephrased as a
formula for an antiderivative. For instance,
d
dx sin x D cos xI
therefore,
Z
cos x dx D sin x C C:
We will develop several techniques for ﬁnding antiderivatives in later chapters. Until
then, we must content ourselves with being able to write a few simple antiderivatives
based on the known derivatives of elementary functions:

be rational in (f), but this restriction will be removed later.
The rule for differentiating sums and constant multiples of functions translates
into a similar rule for antiderivatives, as reﬂected in parts (b) and (c) of Example 2
above.

terval are vertically displaced versions of the same curve, as shown in Figure 2.37. In
general, only one of these curves will pass through any given point, so we can obtain a
unique antiderivative of a given function on an interval by requiring the antiderivative
to take a prescribed value at a particular point x.
EXAMPLE 3
Find the function f .x/ whose derivative is f 0.x/ D 6x2  1 for

Thus, C D 4 and f .x/ D 2x3  x  4. (By direct calculation we can verify that
f 0.x/ D 6x2  1 and f .2/ D 10.)

Differential Equations and Initial-Value Problems
A differential equation (DE) is an equation involving one or more derivatives of an
unknown function. Any function whose derivatives satisfy the differential equation
identically on an interval is called a solution of the equation on that interval. For
instance, the function y D x3  x is a solution of the differential equation
dy
dx D 3x2  1
on the whole real line. This differential equation has more than one solution; in fact,
y D x3  x C C is a solution for any value of the constant C:
EXAMPLE 5
Show that for any constants A and B, the function y D Ax3CB=x
is a solution of the differential equation x2y00  xy0  3y D 0 on
any interval not containing 0.
Solution
If y D Ax3 C B=x, then for x ¤ 0 we have
y0 D 3Ax2  B=x2
and
y00 D 6Ax C 2B=x3:
Therefore,
x2y00  xy0  3y D 6Ax3 C 2B
x  3Ax3 C B
x  3Ax3  3B
x D 0;
provided x ¤ 0. This is what had to be proved.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest-order derivative appear-
ing in the equation. The DE in Example 5 is a second-order DE since it involves y00
and no higher derivatives of y. Note that the solution veriﬁed in Example 5 involves
two arbitrary constants, A and B. This solution is called a general solution to the
equation, since it can be shown that every solution is of this form for some choice of
the constants A and B. A particular solution of the equation is obtained by assign-
ing speciﬁc values to these constants. The general solution of an nth-order differential
equation typically involves n arbitrary constants.
An initial-value problem (IVP) is a problem that consists of:
(i) a differential equation (to be solved for an unknown function) and
(ii) prescribed values for the solution and enough of its derivatives at a particular point
(the initial point) to determine values for all the arbitrary constants in the general
solution of the DE and so yield a particular solution.
Remark
It is common to use the same symbol, say y, to denote both the dependent
variable and the function that is the solution to a DE or an IVP; that is, we call the
solution function y D y.x/ rather than y D f .x/.
Remark
The solution of an IVP is valid in the largest interval containing the initial
point where the solution function is deﬁned.
EXAMPLE 6
Use the result of Example 5 to solve the following initial-value
problem.

Solution
As shown in Example 5, the DE x2y00  xy0  3y D 0 has solution y D

3A  B D 6:
Solving these two linear equations for A and B, we get A D 1 and B D 3. Hence,
y D x3 C 3=x for x > 0 is the solution of the IVP.
One of the simplest kinds of differential equation is the equation
dy
dx D f .x/;
which is to be solved for y as a function of x. Evidently the solution is
y D
Z
f .x/ dx:
Our ability to ﬁnd the unknown function y.x/ depends on our ability to ﬁnd an
antiderivative of f:

Differential equations and initial-value problems are of great importance in applica-
tions of calculus, especially for expressing in mathematical form certain laws of nature
that involve rates of change of quantities. A large portion of the total mathematical
endeavour of the last two hundred years has been devoted to their study. They are usu-
ally treated in separate courses on differential equations, but we will discuss them from
time to time in this book when appropriate. Throughout this book, except in sections
devoted entirely to differential equations, we will use the symbol P to mark exercises
about differential equations and initial-value problems.

Velocity and Acceleration
Velocity and Speed
Suppose that an object is moving along a straight line (say the x-axis) so that its po-
sition x is a function of time t, say x D x.t/. (We are using x to represent both the
dependent variable and the function.) Suppose we are measuring x in metres and t
in seconds. The average velocity of the object over the time interval Œt; t C h is the
change in position divided by the change in time, that is, the Newton quotient
vaverage D x
t D x.t C h/  x.t/
h
m/s:
The velocity v.t/ of the object at time t is the limit of this average velocity as h ! 0.
Thus, it is the rate of change (the derivative) of position with respect to time:
Velocity:
v.t/ D dx
dt D x0.t/:
Besides telling us how fast the object is moving, the velocity also tells us in which
direction it is moving. If v.t/ > 0, then x is increasing, so the object is moving to the
right; if v.t/ < 0, then x is decreasing, so the object is moving to the left. At a critical
point of x, that is, a time t when v.t/ D 0, the object is instantaneously at rest—at that
instant it is not moving in either direction.
We distinguish between the term velocity (which involves direction of motion as
well as the rate) and speed, which only involves the rate and not the direction. The

SECTION 2.11:
Velocity and Acceleration
157
speed is the absolute value of the velocity:
Speed:
s.t/ D jv.t/j D
ˇˇˇˇ
dx
dt
ˇˇˇˇ :
A speedometer gives us the speed a vehicle is moving; it does not give the velocity.
The speedometer does not start to show negative values if the vehicle turns around and
heads in the opposite direction.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Determine the velocity v.t/ at time t of an object moving along the x-axis so that
at time t its position is given by
x D v0t C 1

where v0 and a are constants.
(b) Draw the graph of v.t/, and show that the area under the graph and above the
t-axis, over Œt1; t2, is equal to the distance the object travels in that time interval.
Solution
The velocity is given by
v.t/ D dx
dt D v0 C at:
Its graph is a straight line with slope a and intercept v0 on the vertical (velocity) axis.
The area under the graph (shaded in Figure 2.38) is the sum of the areas of a rectangle
and a triangle. Each has base t2  t1. The rectangle has height v.t1/ D v0 C at1, and
the triangle has height a.t2  t1/. (Why?) Thus, the shaded area is equal to

which is the distance travelled by the object between times t1 and t2.
Remark
In Example 1 we differentiated the position x to get the velocity v and then
used the area under the velocity graph to recover information about the position. It
appears that there is a connection between ﬁnding areas and ﬁnding functions that
have given derivatives (i.e., ﬁnding antiderivatives). This connection, which we will
explore in Chapter 5, is perhaps the most important idea in calculus!
Acceleration
The derivative of the velocity also has a useful interpretation. The rate of change of the
velocity with respect to time is the acceleration of the moving object. It is measured
in units of distance/time2. The value of the acceleration at time t is
Acceleration:
a.t/ D v0.t/ D dv
dt D d 2x
dt2 :

158
CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
The acceleration is the second derivative of the position. If a.t/ > 0, the velocity is
increasing. This does not necessarily mean that the speed is increasing; if the object is
moving to the left (v.t/ < 0) and accelerating to the right (a.t/ > 0), then it is actually
slowing down. The object is speeding up only when the velocity and acceleration have
the same sign. (See Table 2.)

If a.t0/ D 0, then the velocity and the speed are stationary at t0. If a.t/ D 0 during
an interval of time, then the velocity is unchanging and, therefore, constant over that
interval.
EXAMPLE 2
A point P moves along the x-axis in such a way that its position
at time t s is given by
x D 2t3  15t2 C 24t ft:
(a) Find the velocity and acceleration of P at time t:
(b) In which direction and how fast is P moving at t D 2 s? Is it speeding up or
slowing down at that time?
(c) When is P instantaneously at rest? When is its speed instantaneously not chang-
ing?
(d) When is P moving to the left? to the right?
(e) When is P speeding up? slowing down?
Solution
(a) The velocity and acceleration of P at time t are
v D dx
dt D 6t2  30t C 24 D 6.t  1/.t  4/ ft/s
and
a D dv
dt D 12t  30 D 6.2t  5/ ft/s2:
(b) At t D 2 we have v D 12 and a D 6. Thus, P is moving to the left with
speed 12 ft/s, and, since the velocity and acceleration are both negative, its speed
is increasing.
(c) P is at rest when v D 0, that is, when t D 1 s or t D 4 s. Its speed is unchanging
when a D 0, that is, at t D 5=2 s.
(d) The velocity is continuous for all t so, by the Intermediate-Value Theorem, has a
constant sign on the intervals between the points where it is 0. By examining the
values of v.t/ at t D 0, 2, and 5 (or by analyzing the signs of the factors .t 1/ and
.t  4/ in the expression for v.t/), we conclude that v.t/ < 0 (and P is moving to
the left) on time interval .1; 4/. v.t/ > 0 (and P is moving to the right) on time
intervals .1; 1/ and .4; 1/.
(e) The acceleration a is negative for t < 5=2 and positive for t > 5=2. Table 3
combines this information with information about v to show where P is speeding
up and slowing down.

An object is hurled upward from the roof of a building 10 m high.

Solution
Refer to Figure 2.40. The vertical velocity at time t during ﬂight is
v.t/ D 2.4:9/ t C 8 D 9:8 t C 8 m/s:
The object is rising when v > 0, that is, when 0 < t < 8=9:8, and is falling for
t > 8=9:8. Thus, the object is at its maximum height at time t D 8=9:8  0:8163 s,

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
Falling under Gravity
According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, a rock of mass m acted on by an un-
balanced force F will experience an acceleration a proportional to and in the same
direction as F ; with appropriate units of force, F D ma. If the rock is sitting on
the ground, it is acted on by two forces: the force of gravity acting downward and the
reaction of the ground acting upward. These forces balance, so there is no resulting
acceleration. On the other hand, if the rock is up in the air and is unsupported, the
gravitational force on it will be unbalanced and the rock will experience downward
acceleration. It will fall.
According to Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation, the force by which the earth
attracts the rock is proportional to the mass m of the rock and inversely proportional
to the square of its distance r from the centre of the earth: F D km=r2. If the relative
change r=r is small, as will be the case if the rock remains near the surface of the
earth, then F D mg, where g D k=r2 is approximately constant. It follows that
ma D F D mg, and the rock experiences constant downward acceleration g. Since g
does not depend on m, all objects experience the same acceleration when falling near
the surface of the earth, provided we ignore air resistance and any other forces that may
be acting on them. Newton’s laws therefore imply that if the height of such an object
at time t is y.t/, then
d 2y
dt2 D g:
The negative sign is needed because the gravitational acceleration is downward, the
opposite direction to that of increasing y. Physical experiments give the following
approximate values for g at the surface of the earth:
g D 32 ft/s2
or
g D 9:8 m/s2.
EXAMPLE 4
A rock falling freely near the surface of the earth is subject to a
constant downward acceleration g, if the effect of air resistance is
neglected. If the height and velocity of the rock are y0 and v0 at time t D 0, ﬁnd the
height y.t/ of the rock at any later time t until the rock strikes the ground.

(Stopping distance) A car is travelling at 72 km/h. At a certain
instant its brakes are applied to produce a constant deceleration of
0.8 m/s2. How far does the car travel before coming to a stop?
Solution
Let s.t/ be the distance the car travels in the t seconds after the brakes are
applied. Then s00.t/ D 0:8 (m/s2), so the velocity at time t is given by

Since s0.0/ D 72 km/h D 72  1; 000=3; 600 D 20 m/s, we have C1 D 20. Thus,

its velocity will be 0. Hence, the stopping time is the solution t of the equation

that is, t D 25 s. The distance travelled during deceleration is s.25/ D 250 m.

Transcendental
Functions
“
It is well known that the central problem of the whole of modern
mathematics is the study of the transcendental functions deﬁned by
differential equations.
”
Felix Klein
1849–1925
Lectures on Mathematics (1911)
Introduction
With the exception of the trigonometric functions, all the
functions we have encountered so far have been of three
main types: polynomials, rational functions (quotients of polynomials), and algebraic
functions (fractional powers of rational functions). On an interval in its domain, each
of these functions can be constructed from real numbers and a single real variable x
by using ﬁnitely many arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division) and by taking ﬁnitely many roots (fractional powers). Functions that cannot
be so constructed are called transcendental functions. The only examples of these
that we have seen so far are the trigonometric functions.
Much of the importance of calculus and many of its most useful applications re-
sult from its ability to illuminate the behaviour of transcendental functions that arise
naturally when we try to model concrete problems in mathematical terms. This chap-
ter is devoted to developing other transcendental functions, including exponential and
logarithmic functions and the inverse trigonometric functions.
Some of these functions “undo” what other ones “do” and vice versa. When a pair
of functions behaves this way, we call each one the inverse of the other. We begin the
chapter by studying inverse functions in general.
3.1
Inverse Functions
Consider the function f .x/ D x3 whose graph is shown in Figure 3.1. Like any
function, f .x/ has only one value for each x in its domain (for x3 this is the whole
real line R). In geometric terms, this means that any vertical line meets the graph of
f at only one point. However, for this function f; any horizontal line also meets the
graph at only one point. This means that different values of x always give different
values f .x/. Such a function is said to be one-to-one.
DEFINITION
1
A function f is one-to-one if f .x1/ ¤ f .x2/ whenever x1 and x2 belong to
the domain of f and x1 ¤ x2, or, equivalently, if
f .x1/ D f .x2/
÷
x1 D x2:

SECTION 3.1:
Inverse Functions
167
A function is one-to-one if any horizontal line that intersects its graph does so at only
one point. If a function deﬁned on a single interval is increasing (or decreasing), then
it is one-to-one. (See Section 2.6 for more discussion of this.)
Reconsider the one-to-one function f .x/ D x3 (Figure 3.1). Since the equation
y D x3
has a unique solution x for every given value of y in the range of f; f is one-to-one.
Speciﬁcally, this solution is given by
x D y1=3I
it deﬁnes x as a function of y. We call this new function the inverse of f and denote it
f 1. Thus,
y
x
y D x3

The graph of f .x/ D x3

In general, if a function f is one-to-one, then for any number y in its range there
Do not confuse the 1 in f 1
with an exponent. The inverse
f 1 is not the reciprocal 1=f. If
we want to denote the reciprocal
1=f .x/ with an exponent we can
write it as

f .x/
1
.
will always exist a single number x in its domain such that y D f .x/. Since x is
determined uniquely by y, it is a function of y. We write x D f 1.y/ and call f 1
the inverse of f: The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 3.2(a) is one-to-one
and has an inverse. The function g whose graph is shown in Figure 3.2(b) is not one-
to-one (some horizontal lines meet the graph twice) and so does not have an inverse.

We usually like to write functions with the domain variable called x rather than y, so
we reverse the roles of x and y and reformulate the above deﬁnition as follows.
DEFINITION
2
If f is one-to-one, then it has an inverse function f 1. The value of f 1.x/
is the unique number y in the domain of f for which f .y/ D x. Thus,
y D f 1.x/
”
x D f .y/:
As seen above, y D f .x/ D x3 is equivalent to x D f 1.y/ D y1=3, or, reversing
the roles of x and y, y D f 1.x/ D x1=3 is equivalent to x D f .y/ D y3.
EXAMPLE 1
Show that f .x/ D 2x  1 is one-to-one, and ﬁnd its inverse
f 1.x/.
Solution
Since f 0.x/ D 2 > 0 on R, f is increasing and therefore one-to-one there.
Let y D f 1.x/. Then
x D f .y/ D 2y  1:
Solving this equation for y gives y D x C 1
2
. Thus, f 1.x/ D x C 1

.

CHAPTER 3
Transcendental Functions
There are several things you should remember about the relationship between a func-
tion f and its inverse f 1. The most important one is that the two equations
y D f 1.x/
and
x D f .y/
say the same thing. They are equivalent just as, for example, y D x C1 and x D y 1
are equivalent. Either of the equations can be replaced by the other. This implies that
the domain of f 1 is the range of f and vice versa.
The inverse of a one-to-one function is itself one-to-one and so also has an inverse.
Not surprisingly, the inverse of f 1 is f :
y D .f 1/1.x/
”
x D f 1.y/
”
y D f .x/:
We can substitute either of the equations y D f 1.x/ or x D f .y/ into the other and
obtain the cancellation identities:
f

f 1.x/

D x;
f 1
f .y/

D y:
The ﬁrst of these identities holds for all x in the domain of f 1 and the second for
all y in the domain of f . If S is any set of real numbers and IS denotes the identity
function on S; deﬁned by
IS.x/ D x
for all x in S;
then the cancellation identities say that if D.f / is the domain of f; then
f ı f 1 D ID.f 1/
and
f 1 ı f D ID.f /;
where f ı g.x/ denotes the composition f

g.x/

.
If the coordinates of a point P D .a; b/ are exchanged to give those of a new point
Q D .b; a/, then each point is the reﬂection of the other in the line x D y. (To see
this, note that the line PQ has slope 1, so it is perpendicular to y D x. Also, the
midpoint of PQ is
 aCb
2 ; bCa
2

, which lies on y D x.) It follows that the graphs of
the equations x D f .y/ and y D f .x/ are reﬂections of each other in the line x D y.
Since the equation x D f .y/ is equivalent to y D f 1.x/, the graphs of the functions
f 1 and f are reﬂections of each other in y D x. See Figure 3.3.

CHAPTER 3
Transcendental Functions
Inverting Non–One-to-One Functions
Many important functions, such as the trigonometric functions, are not one-to-one on
their whole domains. It is still possible to deﬁne an inverse for such a function, but we
have to restrict the domain of the function artiﬁcially so that the restricted function is
one-to-one.
As an example, consider the function f .x/ D x2. Unrestricted, its domain is the
whole real line and it is not one-to-one since f .a/ D f .a/ for any a. Let us deﬁne a
new function F.x/ equal to f .x/ but having a smaller domain, so that it is one-to-one.
We can use the interval Œ0; 1/ as the domain of F :
F.x/ D x2
for
0  x < 1:
The graph of F is shown in Figure 3.5; it is the right half of the parabola y D x2, the
graph of f: Evidently F is one-to-one, so it has an inverse F 1, which we calculate
as follows:
y

y D F 1.x/
y D x
y D F.x/
y D x2
Figure 3.5
The restriction F of x2 (blue)

Let y D F 1.x/, then x D F.y/ D y2 and y  0. Thus, y D px. Hence
F 1.x/ D px.
This method of restricting the domain of a non–one-to-one function to make it
invertible will be used when we invert the trigonometric functions in Section 3.5.
Derivatives of Inverse Functions
Suppose that the function f is differentiable on an interval .a; b/ and that either
f 0.x/ > 0 for a < x < b, so that f is increasing on .a; b/, or f 0.x/ < 0 for
a < x < b, so that f is decreasing on .a; b/. In either case f is one-to-one on .a; b/
and has an inverse, f 1 there. Differentiating the cancellation identity

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
To begin we review exponential and logarithmic functions as you may have encoun-
tered them in your previous mathematical studies. In the following sections we will
approach these functions from a different point of view and learn how to ﬁnd their
derivatives.
Exponentials
An exponential function is a function of the form f .x/ D ax, where the base a is a
positive constant and the exponent x is the variable. Do not confuse such functions
with power functions such as f .x/ D xa, where the base is variable and the expo-
nent is constant. The exponential function ax can be deﬁned for integer and rational
exponents x as follows:

How should we deﬁne ax if x is not rational? For example, what does 2 mean? In
order to calculate a derivative of ax, we will want the function to be deﬁned for all real
numbers x, not just rational ones.
In Figure 3.7 we plot points with coordinates .x; 2x/ for many closely spaced ra-
tional values of x. They appear to lie on a smooth curve. The deﬁnition of ax can be
extended to irrational x in such a way that ax becomes a differentiable function of x on
the whole real line. We will do so in the next section. For the moment, if x is irrational
we can regard ax as being the limit of values ar for rational numbers r approaching x:

Exponential functions satisfy several identities called laws of exponents:

If a D 1, then ax D 1x D 1 for every x. If a > 1, then ax is an increasing
function of x; if 0 < a < 1, then ax is decreasing. The graphs of some typical
exponential functions are shown in Figure 3.8(a). They all pass through the point (0,1)
since a0 D 1 for every a > 0. Observe that ax > 0 for all a > 0 and all real x and

Logarithms
The function f .x/ D ax is a one-to-one function provided that a > 0 and a ¤ 1.
Therefore, f has an inverse which we call a logarithmic function.
DEFINITION

If a > 0 and a ¤ 1, the function loga x, called the logarithm of x to the
base a, is the inverse of the one-to-one function ax:

The graphs of some typical logarithmic functions are shown in Figure 3.8(b). They all
pass through the point .1; 0/. Each graph is the reﬂection in the line y D x of the
corresponding exponential graph in Figure 3.8(a).
From the laws of exponents we can derive the following laws of logarithms:

Logarithm law (vi) presented above shows that if you know logarithms to a particular
base b, you can calculate logarithms to any other base a. Scientiﬁc calculators usually
have built-in programs for calculating logarithms to base 10 and to base e, a special
number that we will discover in Section 3.3. Logarithms to any base can be calculated
using either of these functions. For example, computer scientists sometimes need to
use logarithms to base 2. Using a scientiﬁc calculator, you can readily calculate

CHAPTER 3

3.3
The Natural Logarithm and Exponential Functions
In this section we are going to deﬁne a function ln x, called the natural logarithm
of x, in a way that does not at ﬁrst seem to have anything to do with the logarithms
Regard this paragraph as
describing a game we are going
to play in this section. The result
of the game will be that we will
acquire two new classes of
functions, logarithms, and
exponentials, to which the rules
of calculus will apply.
considered in Section 3.2. We will show, however, that it has the same properties as
those logarithms, and in the end we will see that ln x D loge x, the logarithm of x
to a certain speciﬁc base e. We will show that ln x is a one-to-one function, deﬁned
for all positive real numbers. It must therefore have an inverse, ex, that we will call
the exponential function. Our ﬁnal goal is to arrive at a deﬁnition of the exponential
functions ax (for any a > 0) that is valid for any real number x instead of just rational
numbers, and that is known to be continuous and even differentiable without our having
to assume those properties as we did in Section 3.2.

The Natural Logarithm
Table 1 lists the derivatives of integer powers of x. Those derivatives are multiples of
integer powers of x, but one integer power, x1, is conspicuously absent from the list
of derivatives; we do not yet know a function whose derivative is x1 D 1=x. We are
going to remedy this situation by deﬁning a function ln x in such a way that it will have
derivative 1=x.
To get a hint as to how this can be done, review Example 1 of Section 2.11. In that
example we showed that the area under the graph of the velocity of a moving object in a
time interval is equal to the distance travelled by the object in that time interval. Since
the derivative of distance is velocity, measuring the area provided a way of ﬁnding
a function (the distance) that had a given derivative (the velocity). This relationship
between area and derivatives is one of the most important ideas in calculus. It is called
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. We will explore it fully in Chapter 5, but we
will make use of the idea now to deﬁne ln x, which we want to have derivative 1=x.
DEFINITION

The natural logarithm
For x > 0, let Ax be the area of the plane region bounded by the curve
y D 1=t, the t-axis, and the vertical lines t D 1 and t D x. The function ln x
is deﬁned by

The deﬁnition implies that ln 1 D 0, that ln x > 0 if x > 1, that ln x < 0 if 0 < x < 1,
and that ln is a one-to-one function. We now show that if y D ln x, then y0 D 1=x. The
proof of this result is similar to the proof we will give for the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus in Section 5.5.

The two properties .d=dx/ ln x D 1=x and ln 1 D 0 are sufﬁcient to determine the
function ln x completely. (This follows from Theorem 13 in Section 2.8.) We can
deduce from these two properties that ln x satisﬁes the appropriate laws of logarithms:

The Exponential Function
The function ln x is one-to-one on its domain, the interval .0; 1/, so it has an inverse
there. For the moment, let us call this inverse exp x. Thus,
y D exp x
”
x D ln y
.y > 0/:
Since ln 1 D 0, we have exp 0 D 1. The domain of exp is .1; 1/, the range of ln.
The range of exp is .0; 1/, the domain of ln. We have cancellation identities
ln.exp x/ D x
for all real x
and
exp.ln x/ D x
for x > 0:
We can deduce various properties of exp from corresponding properties of ln. Not
surprisingly, they are properties we would expect an exponential function to have.

PROOF
We prove only identity (i); the rest are done similarly. If u D .exp x/r, then,
by Theorem 2(iv), ln u D r ln.exp x/ D rx. Therefore, u D exp.rx/.
Now we make an important deﬁnition!
Let
e D exp.1/:
The number e satisﬁes ln e D 1, so the area bounded by the curve y D 1=t; the t-axis,
and the vertical lines t D 1 and t D e must be equal to 1 square unit. See Figure 3.12.
The number e is one of the most important numbers in mathematics. Like , it is
irrational and not a zero of any polynomial with rational coefﬁcients. (Such numbers
are called transcendental.) Its value is between 2 and 3 and begins

a formula from which the value of e can be calculated to any desired precision.
Theorem 3(i) shows that exp r D exp.1r/ D .exp 1/r D er holds for any rational
number r: Now here is a crucial observation. We only know what er means if r is a
rational number (if r D m=n, then er D
np
em). But exp x is deﬁned for all real x;
rational or not. Since er D exp r when r is rational, we can use exp x as a deﬁnition of
what ex means for any real number x, and there will be no contradiction if x happens
to be rational.
ex D exp x
for all real x:
Theorem 3 can now be restated in terms of ex:

General Exponentials and Logarithms
We can use the fact that ex is now deﬁned for all real x to deﬁne the arbitrary expo-
nential ax (where a > 0) for all real x: If r is rational, then ln.ar/ D r ln a; therefore,
ar D er ln a. However, ex ln a is deﬁned for all real x; so we can use it as a deﬁnition of
ax with no possibility of contradiction arising if x is rational.

Find the critical point of y D xx.
Solution
We can’t differentiate xx by treating it as a power (like xa) because the ex-
ponent varies. We can’t treat it as an exponential (like ax) because the base varies. We
can differentiate it if we ﬁrst write it in terms of the exponential function,

Now xx is deﬁned only for x > 0 and is itself never 0. (Why?) Therefore, the critical
point occurs where 1 C ln x D 0; that is, ln x D 1, or x D 1=e.
Finally, observe that .d=dx/ax D ax ln a is negative for all x if 0 < a < 1 and is
positive for all x if a > 1. Thus, ax is one-to-one and has an inverse function, loga x,
provided a > 0 and a ¤ 1. Its properties follow in the same way as in Section 3.2. If
y D loga x, then x D ay and, differentiating implicitly with respect to x, we get
1 D ay ln a dy
dx D x ln a dy
dx :
Thus, the derivative of loga x is given by
d
dx loga x D

x ln a:
Since loga x can be expressed in terms of logarithms to any other base, say e,
loga x D ln x
ln a ;
we normally use only natural logarithms. Exceptions are found in chemistry, acoustics,
and other sciences where “logarithmic scales” are used to measure quantities for which
a one-unit increase in the measure corresponds to a tenfold increase in the quantity.
Logarithms to base 10 are used in deﬁning such scales. In computer science, where
powers of 2 play a central role, logarithms to base 2 are often encountered.
Logarithmic Differentiation
Suppose we want to differentiate a function of the form
y D .f .x//g.x/
.for f .x/ > 0/:
Since the variable appears in both the base and the exponent, neither the general power
rule, .d=dx/xa D axa1, nor the exponential rule, .d=dx/ax D ax ln a, can be
directly applied. One method for ﬁnding the derivative of such a function is to express
it in the form
y D eg.x/ ln f .x/
and then differentiate, using the Product Rule to handle the exponent. This is the
method used in Example 7.
The derivative in Example 7 can also be obtained by taking natural logarithms of
both sides of the equation y D xx and differentiating implicitly:
ln y D x ln x

y
dy
dx D ln x C x
x D 1 C ln x

dx D y.1 C ln x/ D xx.1 C ln x/:
This latter technique is called logarithmic differentiation.

Logarithmic differentiation is also useful for ﬁnding the derivatives of functions ex-
pressed as products and quotients of many factors. Taking logarithms reduces these
products and quotients to sums and differences. This usually makes the calculation
easier than it would be using the Product and Quotient Rules, especially if the deriva-
tive is to be evaluated at a speciﬁc point.

SECTION 3.4:
Growth and Decay
185
3.4
Growth and Decay
In this section we will study the use of exponential functions to model the growth
rates of quantities whose rate of growth is directly related to their size. The growth of
such quantities is typically governed by differential equations whose solutions involve
exponential functions. Before delving into this topic, we prepare the way by examining
the growth behaviour of exponential and logarithmic functions.
The Growth of Exponentials and Logarithms
In Section 3.3 we showed that both ex and ln x grow large (approach inﬁnity) as x
grows large. However, ex increases very rapidly as x increases, and ln x increases very
slowly. In fact, ex increases faster than any positive power of x (no matter how large
the power), while ln x increases more slowly than any positive power of x (no matter
how small the power). To verify this behaviour we start with an inequality satisﬁed by
ln x. The straight line y D x  1 is tangent to the curve y D ln x at the point .1; 0/.
The following theorem asserts that the curve lies below that line. (See Figure 3.14.)

As observed in Section 2.8, these inequalities imply that g is increasing on .0; 1/ and
decreasing on .1; 1/. Thus, g.x/  g.1/ D 0 for all x > 0 and ln x  x  1 for all
such x.

Each of these limits makes a statement about who “wins” in a contest between an expo-
nential or logarithm and a power. For example, in part (a), the denominator ex grows
large as x ! 1, so it tries to make the fraction xa=ex approach 0. On the other hand,
if a is a large positive number, the numerator xa also grows large and tries to make the
fraction approach inﬁnity. The assertion of (a) is that in this contest between the expo-
nential and the power, the exponential is stronger and wins; the fraction approaches 0.
The content of Theorem 5 can be paraphrased as follows:
In a struggle between a power and an exponential, the exponential wins.
In a struggle between a power and a logarithm, the power wins.
PROOF
First, we prove part (b). Let x > 1, a > 0, and let s D a=2. Since ln.xs/ D
s ln x, we have, using Theorem 4,
0 < s ln x D ln.xs/  xs  1 < xs:

Exponential Growth and Decay Models
Many natural processes involve quantities that increase or decrease at a rate propor-
tional to their size. For example, the mass of a culture of bacteria growing in a medium
supplying adequate nourishment will increase at a rate proportional to that mass. The
value of an investment bearing interest that is continuously compounding increases at a
rate proportional to that value. The mass of undecayed radioactive material in a sample
decreases at a rate proportional to that mass.
All of these phenomena, and others exhibiting similar behaviour, can be modelled
mathematically in the same way. If y D y.t/ denotes the value of a quantity y at time
t, and if y changes at a rate proportional to its size, then
dy
dt D ky;
where k is the constant of proportionality. The above equation is called the differential
equation of exponential growth or decay because, for any value of the constant C;

EXAMPLE 1
(Growth of a cell culture) A certain cell culture grows at a rate
proportional to the number of cells present. If the culture contains
500 cells initially and 800 after 24 h, how many cells will there be after a further 12 h?
Solution
Let y.t/ be the number of cells present t hours after there were 500 cells.
Thus, y.0/ D 500 and y.24/ D 800. Because dy=dt D ky, we have
y.t/ D y.0/ekt D 500ekt:
Therefore, 800 D y.24/ D 500e24k, so 24k D ln 800

k D .1=24/ ln.1:6/ and
y.t/ D 500e.t=24/ ln.1:6/ D 500.1:6/t=24:
We want to know y when t D 36: y.36/ D 500e.36=24/ ln.1:6/ D 500.1:6/3=2  1012.
The cell count grew to about 1,012 in the 12 h after it was 800.
Exponential growth is characterized by a ﬁxed doubling time. If T is the time at which
y has doubled from its size at t D 0, then 2y.0/ D y.T / D y.0/ekT . Therefore,

Solution
Let p.t/ be the percentage of the original radioactivity left after t years.
Thus p.0/ D 100 and p.1;200/ D 50. Since the radioactivity decreases at a rate

CHAPTER 3
Transcendental Functions
Sometimes an exponential growth or decay problem will involve a quantity that changes
at a rate proportional to the difference between itself and a ﬁxed value:
dy
dt D k.y  a/:
In this case, the change of dependent variable u.t/ D y.t/  a should be used to
convert the differential equation to the standard form. Observe that u.t/ changes at the
same rate as y.t/ (i.e., du=dt D dy=dt), so it satisﬁes
du

EXAMPLE 3
(Newton’s law of cooling) A hot object introduced into a cooler
environment will cool at a rate proportional to the excess of its
temperature above that of its environment. If a cup of coffee sitting in a room main-
tained at a temperature of 20 ıC cools from 80 ıC to 50 ıC in 5 minutes, how much
longer will it take to cool to 40 ıC?
Solution
Let y.t/ be the temperature of the coffee t min after it was 80 ıC. Thus,
y.0/ D 80 and y.5/ D 50. Newton’s law says that dy=dt D k.y  20/ in this case, so

Interest on Investments
Suppose that $10,000 is invested at an annual rate of interest of 8%. Thus, the value of
the investment at the end of one year will be $10,000.1:08/ D $10;800. If this amount
remains invested for a second year at the same rate, it will grow to $10,000.1:08/2 =
$11,664; in general, n years after the original investment was made, it will be worth
$10,000.1:08/n.
Now suppose that the 8% rate is compounded semiannually so that the interest is
actually paid at a rate of 4% per 6-month period. After one year (two interest periods)
the $10,000 will grow to $10,000.1:04/2 = $10,816. This is $16 more than was obtained
when the 8% was compounded only once per year. The extra $16 is the interest paid
in the second 6-month period on the $400 interest earned in the ﬁrst 6-month period.
Continuing in this way, if the 8% interest is compounded monthly (12 periods per year
and
8
12% paid per period) or daily (365 periods per year and
8
365% paid per period),
then the original $10,000 would grow in one year to $10,000

periods in a year approach inﬁnity, that is, we compound the interest continuously.
The answer is that in 1 year the $A will grow to

D $Aer=100:
For example, at 8% per annum compounded continuously, our $10,000 will grow in
one year to $10,000e0:08  $10; 832:87. (Note that this is just a few cents more than
we get by compounding daily.) To justify this result we need the following theorem.

as ex ln y. In any event, the formula in this table is not a very efﬁcient way to calculate
e to any great accuracy. Only 4 decimal places are correct for n D 100;000. A much
better way is to use the series

A ﬁnal word about interest rates. Financial institutions sometimes quote effective
rates of interest rather than nominal rates. The effective rate tells you what the actual
effect of the interest rate will be after one year. Thus, $10,000 invested at an effective
rate of 8% will grow to $10,800.00 in one year regardless of the compounding period.
A nominal rate of 8% per annum compounded daily is equivalent to an effective rate
of about 8.3278%.
Logistic Growth
Few quantities in nature can sustain exponential growth over extended periods of time;
the growth is usually limited by external constraints. For example, suppose a small
number of rabbits (of both sexes) is introduced to a small island where there were
no rabbits previously, and where there are no predators who eat rabbits. By virtue of
natural fertility, the number of rabbits might be expected to grow exponentially, but this
growth will eventually be limited by the food supply available to the rabbits. Suppose
the island can grow enough food to supply a population of L rabbits indeﬁnitely. If
there are y.t/ rabbits in the population at time t, we would expect y.t/ to grow at a
rate proportional to y.t/ provided y.t/ is quite small (much less than L). But as the
numbers increase, it will be harder for the rabbits to ﬁnd enough food, and we would
expect the rate of increase to approach 0 as y.t/ gets closer and closer to L. One
possible model for such behaviour is the differential equation
dy
dt D ky

1  y
L

;
Figure 3.16
Some logistic curves
y

L
which is called the logistic equation since it models growth that is limited by the
supply of necessary resources. Observe that dy=dt > 0 if 0 < y < L and that this
rate is small if y is small (there are few rabbits to reproduce) or if y is close to L (there
are almost as many rabbits as the available resources can feed). Observe also that
dy=dt < 0 if y > L; there being more animals than the resources can feed, the rabbits
die at a greater rate than they are born. Of course, the steady-state populations y D 0
and y D L are solutions of the logistic equation; for both of these dy=dt D 0. We
will examine techniques for solving differential equations like the logistic equation in

Section 7.9. For now, we invite the reader to verify by differentiation that the solution
satisfying y.0/ D y0 is

Observe that, as expected, if 0 < y0 < L, then
lim
t!1 y.t/ D L;
lim

The solution given above also holds for y0 > L. However, the solution does not
approach 0 as t approaches 1 in this case. It has a vertical asymptote at a certain
negative value of t. (See Exercise 30 below.) The graphs of solutions of the logistic
equation for various positive values of y0 are given in Figure 3.16.

Suppose that 1,000 rabbits were introduced onto an island
where they had no natural predators. During the next ﬁve
years, the rabbit population grew exponentially. After the ﬁrst
two years the population was 3,500 rabbits. After the ﬁrst ﬁve
years a rabbit virus was sprayed on the island, and after that
the rabbit population decayed exponentially. Two years after
the virus was introduced (so seven years after rabbits were
introduced to the island), the rabbit population had dropped to
3,000 rabbits. How many rabbits will there be on the island 10
years after they were introduced?
22. Lab rats are to be used in experiments on an isolated island.
Initially R rats are brought to the island and released. Having
a plentiful food supply and no natural predators on the island,
the rat population grows exponentially and doubles in three
months. At the end of the ﬁfth month, and at the end of every
ﬁve months thereafter, 1,000 of the rats are captured and
killed. What is the minimum value of R that ensures that the
scientists will never run out of rats?

The Inverse Trigonometric Functions

we did with the function x2 in Section 3.1, we can restrict their domains in such a way
that the restricted functions are one-to-one and invertible.

Remark
Some computer programs, especially spreadsheets, implement two versions
of the arctangent function, usually called “atan” and “atan2.” The function atan is just
the function tan1 that we have deﬁned; atan.y=x/ gives the angle in radians, between
the line from the origin to the point .x; y/ and the positive x-axis, provided .x; y/ lies
in quadrants I or IV of the plane. The function atan2 is a function of two variables:
atan2.x; y/ gives that angle for any point .x; y/ not on the y-axis. See Figure 3.24.
Some programs, for instance MATLAB, reverse the order of the variables x and y in
their atan2 function. Maple uses arctan(x) and arctan(y,x) for the one- and
two-variable versions of arctangent.

Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The function cos x is one-to-one on the interval Œ0; , so we could deﬁne the inverse
cosine function, cos1 x (or arccos x, or Arccos x, or acos x), so that

Scientiﬁc calculators usually implement only the primary trigonometric functions—

secant, cosecant, and cotangent—are calculated using the reciprocal key; to calculate
sec x you calculate cos x and take the reciprocal of the answer. The inverses of the
secondary trigonometric functions are also easily expressed in terms of those of their
reciprocal functions. For example, we deﬁne:

the absolute value from
appearing in the formula for the

harder to calculate values with
that deﬁnition. Our deﬁnition

Hyperbolic Functions
Any function deﬁned on the real line can be expressed (in a unique way) as the sum of
an even function and an odd function. (See Exercise 35 of Section P.5.) The hyperbolic
functions cosh x and sinh x are, respectively, the even and odd functions whose sum
is the exponential function ex.
DEFINITION
15
The hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine functions
For any real x the hyperbolic cosine, cosh x, and the hyperbolic sine, sinh x,
are deﬁned by
cosh x D ex C ex
2
;
sinh x D ex  ex
2
:
(The symbol “sinh” is somewhat hard to pronounce as written. Some people say
“shine,” and others say “sinch.”) Recall that cosine and sine are called circular func-
tions because, for any t, the point .cos t; sin t/ lies on the circle with equation x2 C
y2 D 1. Similarly, cosh and sinh are called hyperbolic functions because the point
.cosh t; sinh t/ lies on the rectangular hyperbola with equation x2  y2 D 1,

There is no interpretation of t as an arc length or angle as there was in the circular
case; however, the area of the hyperbolic sector bounded by y D 0, the hyperbola
x2  y2 D 1, and the ray from the origin to .cosh t; sinh t/ is t=2 square units (see
Exercise 21 of Section 8.4), just as is the area of the circular sector bounded by y D 0,
the circle x2 C y2 D 1, and the ray from the origin to .cos t; sin t/. (See Figure 3.26.)

Observe that, similar to the corresponding values of cos x and sin x, we have

sinh 0 D 0;
and cosh x, like cos x, is an even function, and sinh x, like sin x, is an odd function:
cosh.x/ D cosh x;
sinh.x/ D  sinh x:
The graphs of cosh and sinh are shown in Figure 3.27. The graph y D cosh x is called
a catenary. A chain hanging by its ends will assume the shape of a catenary.
Many other properties of the hyperbolic functions resemble those of the corre-
sponding circular functions, sometimes with signs changed.

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
The functions sinh and tanh are increasing and therefore one-to-one and invertible on
the whole real line. Their inverses are denoted sinh1 and tanh1, respectively:
y D sinh1 x

x D sinh y;
y D tanh1 x
”
x D tanh y:
Since the hyperbolic functions are deﬁned in terms of exponentials, it is not surprising
that their inverses can be expressed in terms of logarithms.

Second-Order Linear DEs with Constant Coefﬁcients
A differential equation of the form
a y00 C b y0 C cy D 0;
./
where a, b, and c are constants and a ¤ 0, is called a second-order, linear, homo-
geneous differential equation with constant coefﬁcients. The second-order refers to the
highest order derivative present; the terms linear and homogeneous refer to the fact that
if y1.t/ and y2.t/ are two solutions of the equation, then so is y.t/ D Ay1.t/CBy2.t/
for any constants A and B:
If ay00
1.t/ C by0
1.t/ C cy1.t/ D 0 and ay00
2.t/ C by0
2.t/ C cy2.t/ D 0,
and if y.t/ D Ay1.t/ C By2.t/, then ay00.t/ C by0.t/ C cy.t/ D 0.
(See Section 18.1 for more details on this terminology.) Throughout this section we
will assume that the independent variable in our functions is t rather than x, so the
prime (0) refers to the derivative d=dt. This is because in most applications of such
equations the independent variable is time.
Equations of type ./ arise in many applications of mathematics. In particular,
they can model mechanical vibrations such as the motion of a mass suspended from an
elastic spring or the current in certain electrical circuits. In most such applications the
three constants a, b, and c are positive, although sometimes we may have b D 0.
Recipe for Solving ay” + by’ + cy = 0
In Section 3.4 we observed that the ﬁrst-order, constant-coefﬁcient equation y0 D ky
has solution y D Cekt. Let us try to ﬁnd a solution of equation ./ having the form
y D ert. Substituting this expression into equation ./, we obtain
ar2ert C brert C cert D 0:
Since ert is never zero, y D ert will be a solution of the differential equation ./ if
and only if r satisﬁes the quadratic auxiliary equation
ar2 C br C c D 0;
./
which has roots given by the quadratic formula,
r D b ˙

where D D b2  4ac is called the discriminant of the auxiliary equation ./.
There are three cases to consider, depending on whether the discriminant D is
positive, zero, or negative.
CASE I
Suppose D D b2  4ac > 0. Then the auxiliary equation has two different
real roots, r1 and r2, given by
r1 D b 

(Sometimes these roots can be found easily by factoring the left side of the auxiliary
equation.) In this case both y D y1.t/ D er1t and y D y2.t/ D er2t are solutions of
the differential equation ./, and neither is a multiple of the other. As noted above, the
function

SECTION 3.7:

207
y D A er1t C B er2t
is also a solution for any choice of the constants A and B. Since the differential equa-
tion is of second order and this solution involves two arbitrary constants, we suspect it
is the general solution, that is, that every solution of the differential equation can be
written in this form. Exercise 18 at the end of this section outlines a way to prove this.
CASE II
Suppose D D b2  4ac D 0. Then the auxiliary equation has two equal
roots, r1 D r2 D b=.2a/ D r, say. Certainly, y D ert is a solution of ./. We can
ﬁnd the general solution by letting y D ertu.t/ and calculating:
y0 D ert
u0.t/ C ru.t/

y00 D ert
u00.t/ C 2ru0.t/ C r2u.t/

:
Substituting these expressions into ./, we obtain
ert
au00.t/ C .2ar C b/u0.t/ C .ar2 C br C c/u.t/

D 0:
Since ert ¤ 0, 2ar C b D 0 and r satisﬁes ./, this equation reduces to u00.t/ D 0,
which has general solution u.t/ D A C Bt for arbitrary constants A and B. Thus, the
general solution of ./ in this case is
y D A ert C Bt ert:
CASE III
Suppose D D b2  4ac < 0. Then the auxiliary equation ./ has
complex conjugate roots given by
r D b ˙

D k ˙ i!;
where k D b=.2a/, ! D

see Appendix I). As in Case I, the functions y
1.t/ D e.kCi!/t and y
2.t/ D e.ki!/t
are two independent solutions of (*), but they are not real-valued. However, since
eix D cos x C i sin x
and
eix D cos x  i sin x
(as noted in the previous section and in Appendix II), we can ﬁnd two real-valued
functions that are solutions of (*) by suitably combining y

The following examples illustrate the recipe for solving ./ in each of the three cases.

Initial-value problems for ay00 C by0 C cy D 0 specify values for y and y0 at an initial
point. These values can be used to determine the values of the constants A and B in
the general solution, so the initial-value problem has a unique solution.

Simple Harmonic Motion
Many natural phenomena exhibit periodic behaviour. The swinging of a clock pen-
dulum, the vibrating of a guitar string or drum membrane, the altitude of a rider on
a rotating ferris wheel, the motion of an object ﬂoating in wavy seas, and the voltage
produced by an alternating current generator are but a few examples where quanti-
ties depend on time in a periodic way. Being periodic, the circular functions sine and
cosine provide a useful model for such behaviour.
It often happens that a quantity displaced from an equilibrium value experiences
a restoring force that tends to move it back in the direction of its equilibrium. Besides
the obvious examples of elastic motions in physics, one can imagine such a model
applying, say, to a biological population in equilibrium with its food supply or the
price of a commodity in an elastic economy where increasing price causes decreasing
demand and hence decreasing price. In the simplest models, the restoring force is
proportional to the amount of displacement from equilibrium. Such a force causes the
quantity to oscillate sinusoidally; we say that it executes simple harmonic motion.
As a speciﬁc example, suppose a mass m is suspended by an elastic spring so that
it hangs unmoving in its equilibrium position with the upward spring tension force
balancing the downward gravitational force on the mass. If the mass is displaced ver-
tically by an amount y from this position, the spring tension changes; the extra force
exerted by the spring is directed to restore the mass to its equilibrium position. (See
Figure 3.29.) This extra force is proportional to the displacement (Hooke’s Law); its
magnitude is ky, where k is a positive constant called the spring constant. Assum-
ing the spring is weightless, this force imparts to the mass m an acceleration d 2y=dt2
that satisﬁes, by Newton’s Second Law, m.d 2y=dt2/ D ky (mass  acceleration =
force). Dividing this equation by m, we obtain the equation

The second-order differential equation

is called the equation of simple harmonic motion. Its auxiliary equation,
r2 C !2 D 0, has complex roots r D ˙i!, so it has general solution
y D A cos !t C B sin !t;
where A and B are arbitrary constants.
For any values of the constants R and t0, the function
y D R cos

!.t  t0/

is also a general solution of the differential equation of simple harmonic motion. If we
expand this formula using the addition formula for cosine, we get
y D R cos !t0 cos !t C R sin !t0 sin !t
D A cos !t C B sin !t;

in Figure 3.30 that the graph of the displacement as a function of time is the curve
y D R cos !t shifted t0 units to the right. The number t0 is called the time-shift. (The
related quantity !t0 is called a phase-shift.) The period of this curve is T D 2=!;
it is the time interval between consecutive instants when the mass is at the same height
moving in the same direction. The reciprocal 1=T of the period is called the frequency
of the motion. It is usually measured in Hertz (Hz), that is, cycles per second. The
quantity ! D 2=T is called the circular frequency. It is measured in radians per
second since 1 cycle = 1 revolution = 2 radians.

the mass is pulled down 2 cm below equilibrium and ﬂicked upward with a velocity
of 60 cm/s. Find its subsequent displacement at any time t > 0. Find the frequency,
period, amplitude, and time-shift of the motion. Express the position of the mass at
time t in terms of the amplitude and the time-shift.

SECTION 3.7:

Solution
The spring constant k is determined from Hooke’s Law, F D ky. Here
F D 3  104 g-cm/s2 is the force of the spring on the mass displaced 1/3 cm:

p
k=m D 30 rad/s, the
frequency is !=2 D 15=  4:77 Hz, and the period is 2=!  0:209 s.
Since the displacement at time t D 0 is y0 D 2 and the velocity at that time
is v0 D 60, the subsequent displacement is y D A cos.30t/ C B sin.30t/, where
A D y0 D 2 and B D v0=! D 60=30 D 2. Thus,
y D 2 cos.30t/ C 2 sin.30t/;

The amplitude of the motion is R D

Damped Harmonic Motion
If a and c are positive and b D 0, then equation
ay00 C by0 C cy D 0
is the differential equation of simple harmonic motion and has oscillatory solutions
of ﬁxed amplitude as shown above. If a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0, then the roots
of the auxiliary equation are either negative real numbers or, if b2 < 4ac, complex
numbers k ˙i! with negative real parts k D b=.2a/ (Case III). In this latter case the
solutions still oscillate, but the amplitude diminishes exponentially as t ! 1 because
of the factor ekt D e.b=2a/t. (See Exercise 17 below.) A system whose behaviour
is modelled by such an equation is said to exhibit damped harmonic motion. If
b2 D 4ac (Case II), the system is said to be critically damped, and if b2 > 4ac
(Case I), it is overdamped. In these cases the behaviour is no longer oscillatory. (See
Figure 3.31. Imagine a mass suspended by a spring in a jar of oil.)

A mass is attached to a spring mounted horizontally so the
mass can slide along the top of a table. With a suitable choice
of units, the position x.t/ of the mass at time t is governed by
the differential equation
x00 D x C F;
where the x term is due to the elasticity of the spring, and
the F is due to the friction of the mass with the table. The
frictional force should be constant in magnitude and directed
opposite to the velocity of the mass when the mass is moving.
When the mass is stopped, the friction should be constant and
opposed to the spring force unless the spring force has the
smaller magnitude, in which case the friction force should just
cancel the spring force and the mass should remain at rest
thereafter. For this problem, let the magnitude of the friction

Introduction
Differential calculus can be used to analyze many kinds
of problems and situations that arise in applied disciplines.
Calculus has made and will continue to make signiﬁcant contributions to every ﬁeld
of human endeavour that uses quantitative measurement to further its aims. From
economics to physics and from biology to sociology, problems can be found whose
solutions can be aided by the use of some calculus.
In this chapter we will examine several kinds of problems to which the techniques
we have already learned can be applied. These problems arise both outside and within
mathematics. We will deal with the following kinds of problems:
1. Related rates problems, where the rates of change of related quantities are ana-
lyzed.
2. Root ﬁnding methods, where we try to ﬁnd numerical solutions of equations.
3. Evaluation of limits.
4. Optimization problems, where a quantity is to be maximized or minimized.
5. Graphing problems, where derivatives are used to illuminate the behaviour of
functions.
6. Approximation problems, where complicated functions are approximated by poly-
nomials.
Do not assume that most of the problems we present here are “real-world” problems.
Such problems are usually too complex to be treated in a general calculus course.
However, the problems we consider, while sometimes artiﬁcial, do show how calculus
can be applied in concrete situations.

Related Rates
When two or more quantities that change with time are linked by an equation, that
equation can be differentiated with respect to time to produce an equation linking the
rates of change of the quantities. Any one of these rates may then be determined when
the others, and the values of the quantities themselves, are known. We will consider
a couple of examples before formulating a list of procedures for dealing with such
problems.

An aircraft is ﬂying horizontally at a speed of 600 km/h. How fast
is the distance between the aircraft and a radio beacon increasing

A diagram is useful here; see Figure 4.1. Let C be the point on the aircraft’s
path directly above the beacon B.

How fast is the area of a rectangle changing if one side is 10 cm
long and is increasing at a rate of 2 cm/s and the other side is 8 cm
long and is decreasing at a rate of 3 cm/s?
Solution
Let the lengths of the sides of the rectangle at time t be x cm and y cm,
respectively. Thus, the area at time t is A D xy cm2. (See Figure 4.2.) We want
to know the value of dA=dt when x D 10 and y D 8, given that dx=dt D 2 and
dy=dt D 3. (Note the negative sign to indicate that y is decreasing.) Since all
the quantities in the equation A D xy are functions of time, we can differentiate that

Procedures for Related-Rates Problems
In view of these examples we can formulate a few general procedures for dealing with
related-rates problems.

CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
How to solve related-rates problems
1. Read the problem very carefully. Try to understand the relationships be-
tween the variable quantities. What is given? What is to be found?
2. Make a sketch if appropriate.
3. Deﬁne any symbols you want to use that are not deﬁned in the statement
of the problem. Express given and required quantities and rates in terms
of these symbols.
4. From a careful reading of the problem or consideration of the sketch,
identify one or more equations linking the variable quantities. (You will
need as many equations as quantities or rates to be found in the problem.)
5. Differentiate the equation(s) implicitly with respect to time, regarding all
variable quantities as functions of time. You can manipulate the equa-
tion(s) algebraically before the differentiation is performed (for instance,
you could solve for the quantities whose rates are to be found), but it is
usually easier to differentiate the equations as they are originally obtained
and solve for the desired items later.
6. Substitute any given values for the quantities and their rates, then solve
the resulting equation(s) for the unknown quantities and rates.
7. Make a concluding statement answering the question asked. Is your an-
swer reasonable? If not, check back through your solution to see what
went wrong.

A lighthouse L is located on a small island 2 km from the nearest
point A on a long, straight shoreline. If the lighthouse lamp rotates

tween the aircraft and the car increasing 36 s after the aircraft passes directly over the

Finding Roots of Equations
Finding solutions (roots) of equations is an important mathematical problem to which
calculus can make signiﬁcant contributions. There are only a few general classes of
equations of the form f .x/ D 0 that we can solve exactly. These include linear
equations:
ax C b D 0;
.a ¤ 0/

and quadratic equations:
ax2 C bx C c D 0;
.a ¤ 0/
)
x D b ˙
p
b2  4ac

:
Cubic and quartic (3rd- and 4th-degree polynomial) equations can also be solved, but
the formulas are very complicated. We usually solve these and most other equations
approximately by using numerical methods, often with the aid of a calculator or com-
puter.
In Section 1.4 we discussed the Bisection Method for approximating a root of an
equation f .x/ D 0. That method uses the Intermediate-Value Theorem and depends
only on the continuity of f and our ability to ﬁnd an interval Œx1; x2 that must contain
the root because f .x1/ and f .x2/ have opposite signs. The method is rather slow; it
requires between three and four iterations to gain one signiﬁcant ﬁgure of precision in
the root being approximated.
If we know that f is more than just continuous, we can devise better (i.e., faster)
methods for ﬁnding roots of f .x/ D 0. We study two such methods in this section:
(a) Fixed-Point Iteration, which looks for solutions of an equation of the form x D
f .x/. Such solutions are called ﬁxed points of the function f:
(b) Newton’s Method, which looks for solutions of the equation f .x/ D 0 as ﬁxed
points of the function g.x/ D x  f .x/
f 0.x/, that is, points x such that x D g.x/.
This method is usually very efﬁcient, but it requires that f be differentiable.

SECTION 4.2:
Finding Roots of Equations
223
Like the Bisection Method, both of these methods require that we have at the outset a
rough idea of where a root can be found, and they generate sequences of approxima-
tions that get closer and closer to the root.
Discrete Maps and Fixed-Point Iteration
A discrete map is an equation of the form
xnC1 D f .xn/;
for n D 0; 1; 2; : : : ;
which generates a sequence of values x1, x2, x3, : : : , from a given starting value x0. In
certain
circumstances
this
sequence
of
numbers
will converge
to
a
limit,
r D limn!1 xn, in which case this limit will be a ﬁxed point of f : r D f .r/.
(A thorough discussion of convergence of sequences can be found in Section 9.1. For
our purposes here, an intuitive understanding will sufﬁce: limn!1 xn D r if jxn  rj
approaches 0 as n ! 1.)
For certain kinds of functions f; we can solve the equation f .r/ D r by starting
with an initial guess x0 and calculating subsequent values of the discrete map until
sufﬁcient accuracy is achieved. This is the Method of Fixed-Point Iteration. Let us
begin by investigating a simple example:
EXAMPLE 1
Find a root of the equation cos x D 5x.
Solution
This equation is of the form f .x/ D x, where f .x/ D 1
5 cos x. Since cos x
is close to 1 for x near 0, we see that 1
5 cos x will be close to 1
5 when x D 1

suggests that a reasonable ﬁrst guess at the ﬁxed point is x0 D 1

are presented in Table 1. The root is 0:196 164 28 to 8 decimal places.
Why did the method used in Example 1 work? Will it work for any function f ‹
In order to answer these questions, examine the polygonal line in Figure 4.10. Starting
at x0 it goes vertically to the curve y D f .x/, the height there being x1. Then it goes
horizontally to the line y D x, meeting that line at a point whose x-coordinate must
therefore also be x1. Then the process repeats; the line goes vertically to the curve
y D f .x/ and horizontally to y D x, arriving at x D x2. The line continues in this
way, “spiralling” closer and closer to the intersection of y D f .x/ and y D x. Each
value of xn is closer to the ﬁxed point r than the previous value.
Now consider the function f whose graph appears in Figure 4.11(a). If we try the
same method there, starting with x0, the polygonal line spirals outward, away from the
root, and the resulting values xn will not “converge” to the root as they did in Example
1. To see why the method works for the function in Figure 4.10 but not for the function
in Figure 4.11(a), observe the slopes of the two graphs y D f .x/ near the ﬁxed point
r. Both slopes are negative, but in Figure 4.10 the absolute value of the slope is less
than 1 while the absolute value of the slope of f in Figure 4.11(a) is greater than 1.
Close consideration of the graphs should convince you that it is this fact that caused
the points xn to get closer to r in Figure 4.10 and farther from r in Figure 4.11(a).

A third example, Figure 4.11(b), shows that the method can be expected to work
for functions whose graphs have positive slope near the ﬁxed point r, provided that the
slope is less than 1. In this case the polygonal line forms a “staircase” rather than a
“spiral,” and the successive approximations xn increase toward the root if x0 < r and
decrease toward it if x0 > r.
Remark
Note that if jf 0.x/j > 1 near a ﬁxed point r of f , you may still be able to
ﬁnd that ﬁxed point by applying ﬁxed-point iteration to f 1.x/. Evidently f 1.r/ D
r if and only if r D f .r/.
The following theorem guarantees that the method of ﬁxed-point iteration will
work for a particular class of functions.
T H E O R E M

A ﬁxed-point theorem
Suppose that f is deﬁned on an interval I D Œa; b and satisﬁes the following two
conditions:
(i) f .x/ belongs to I whenever x belongs to I and
(ii) there exists a constant K with 0 < K < 1 such that for every u and v in I;
jf .u/  f .v/j  Kju  vj:

SECTION 4.2:
Finding Roots of Equations
225
Then f has a unique ﬁxed point r in I; that is, f .r/ D r, and starting with any number
x0 in I; the iterates
x1 D f .x0/;
x2 D f .x1/;
: : :
converge to r.
You are invited to prove this theorem by a method outlined in Exercises 26 and 27 at
the end of this section.
EXAMPLE 2
Show that if 0 < k < 1, then f .x/ D k cos x satisﬁes the con-
ditions of Theorem 1 on the interval I D Œ0; 1. Observe that if
k D 1=5, the ﬁxed point is that calculated in Example 1 above.
Solution
Since 0 < k < 1, f maps I into I. If u and v are in I, then the Mean-Value
Theorem says there exists c between u and v such that
jf .u/  f .v/j D j.u  v/f 0.c/j D kju  vj sin c  kju  vj:
Thus, the conditions of Theorem 1 are satisﬁed and f has a ﬁxed point r in Œ0; 1.
Of course, even if k  1, f may still have a ﬁxed point in I locatable by iteration,
provided the slope of f near that point is less than 1.
Newton’s Method
We want to ﬁnd a root of the equation f .x/ D 0, that is, a number r such that f .r/ D
0. Such a number is also called a zero of the function f: If f is differentiable near the
root, then tangent lines can be used to produce a sequence of approximations to the root
that approaches the root quite quickly. The idea is as follows (see Figure 4.12). Make an
initial guess at the root, say x D x0. Draw the tangent line to y D f .x/ at .x0; f .x0//,
and ﬁnd x1, the x-intercept of this tangent line. Under certain circumstances x1 will
be closer to the root than x0 was. The process can be repeated over and over to get
numbers x2, x3, : : : , getting closer and closer to the root r. The number xnC1 is the
x-intercept of the tangent line to y D f .x/ at .xn; f .xn//.

The tangent line to y D f .x/ at x D x0 has equation

CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
Since the point .x1; 0/ lies on this line, we have 0 D f .x0/Cf 0.x0/.x1 x0/. Hence,
x1 D x0  f .x0/
f 0.x0/:
Similar formulas produce x2 from x1, then x3 from x2, and so on. The formula pro-
ducing xnC1 from xn is the discrete map xnC1 D g.xn/, where g.x/ D x  f .x/
f 0.x/.
That is,
xnC1 D xn  f .xn/
f 0.xn/;
which is known as the Newton’s Method formula. If r is a ﬁxed point of g then
f .r/ D 0 and r is a zero of f . We usually use a calculator or computer to calculate
the successive approximations x1, x2, x3, : : : ; and observe whether these numbers
appear to converge to a limit. Convergence will not occur if the graph of f has a
horizontal or vertical tangent at any of the numbers in the sequence. However, if
limn!1 xn D r exists, and if f=f 0 is continuous near r, then r must be a zero of f:
This method is known as Newton’s Method or The Newton-Raphson Method. Since
Newton’s Method is just a special case of ﬁxed-point iteration applied to the function
g.x/ deﬁned above, the general properties of ﬁxed-point iteration apply to Newton’s
Method as well.
EXAMPLE 3
Use Newton’s Method to ﬁnd the only real root of the equation
x3  x  1 D 0 correct to 10 decimal places.
Solution
We have f .x/ D x3  x  1 and f 0.x/ D 3x2  1. Since f is continuous
and since f .1/ D 1 and f .2/ D 5, the equation has a root in the interval Œ1; 2.
Figure 4.13 shows that the equation has only one root to the right of x D 0. Let us

Observe the behaviour of the numbers xn. By the third iteration, x3, we have appar-
ently achieved a precision of 6 decimal places, and by x4 over 10 decimal places. It is
characteristic of Newton’s Method that when you begin to get close to the root the con-
vergence can be very rapid. Compare these results with those obtained for the same
equation by the Bisection Method in Example 12 of Section 1.4; there we achieved
only 3 decimal place precision after 11 iterations.

Remark
Example 4 shows how useful a sketch can be for determining an initial guess
x0. Even a rough sketch of the graph of y D f .x/ can show you how many roots the
equation f .x/ D 0 has and approximately where they are. Usually, the closer the
initial approximation is to the actual root, the smaller the number of iterations needed
to achieve the desired precision. Similarly, for an equation of the form g.x/ D h.x/,
making a sketch of the graphs of g and h (on the same set of axes) can suggest starting
approximations for any intersection points. In either case, you can then apply Newton’s
Method to improve the approximations.
Remark
When using Newton’s Method to solve an equation that is of the form
g.x/ D h.x/ (such as the one in Example 4), we must rewrite the equation in the form
f .x/ D 0 and apply Newton’s Method to f: Usually we just use f .x/ D g.x/h.x/,
although f .x/ D

g.x/=h.x/

 1 is also a possibility.
Remark
If your calculator is programmable, you should learn how to program the
Newton’s Method formula for a given equation so that generating new iterations re-
quires pressing only a few buttons. If your calculator has graphing capabilities, you
can use them to locate a good initial guess.
Newton’s Method does not always work as well as it does in the preceding exam-
ples. If the ﬁrst derivative f 0 is very small near the root, or if the second derivative f 00
is very large near the root, a single iteration of the formula can take us from quite close

Here the Newton’s Method
iterations do not converge to the root

21 and 22 at the end of this section.)
Before you try to use Newton’s Method to ﬁnd a real root of a funcion f; you
should make sure that a real root actually exists. If you use the method starting with a
real initial guess, but the function has no real root nearby, the successive “approxima-
tions” can exhibit strange behaviour. The following example illustrates this for a very
simple function.

Consider the function f .x/ D 1 C x2. Clearly f has no real roots

If we start with a real guess x0 D 2, iterate this formula 20,000 times, and plot the
resulting points .n; xn/, we obtain Figure 4.16, which was done using a Maple proce-
dure. It is clear from this plot that not only do the iterations not converge (as one might
otherwise expect), but they do not diverge to 1 or 1, and they are not periodic
either. This phenomenon is known as chaos.

A deﬁnitive characteristic of this phenomenon is sensitivity to initial conditions.
To demonstrate this sensitivity in the case at hand we make a change of variables. Let
yn D

then the Newton’s Method formula for f becomes
ynC1 D 4yn.1  yn/;
(see Exercise 24), which is a special case of a discrete map called the logistic map.
It represents one of the best-known and simplest examples of chaos. If, for example,
yn D sin2.un/, for n D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; then it follows (see Exercise 25 below) that
un D 2nu0. Unless u0 is a rational multiple of , it follows that two different choices
of u0 will lead to differences in the resulting values of un that grow exponentially with
n. In Exercise 25 it is shown that this sensitivity is carried through to the ﬁrst order in
xn.
Remark
The above example does not imply that Newton’s Method cannot be used to
ﬁnd complex roots; the formula simply cannot escape from the real line if a real initial
guess is used. To accomodate a complex initial guess, z0 D a0Cib0, we can substitute,
zn D an C ibn into the complex version of Newton’s Method formula znC1 D z2

converging to the root Ci. For an initial guess, 1  i, the resulting sequence converges
as rapidly to the root i. Note that for the real initial guess z0 D 0 C i0, neither a1
nor b1 is deﬁned, so the process fails. This corresponds to the fact that 1 C x2 has a
horizontal tangent y D 1 at .0; 1/, and this tangent has no ﬁnite x-intercept.
The following theorem gives sufﬁcient conditions for the Newton approximations
to converge to a root r of the equation f .x/ D 0 if the initial guess x0 is sufﬁciently
close to that root.

Error bounds for Newton’s Method
Suppose that f , f 0, and f 00 are continuous on an interval I containing xn, xnC1, and
a root x D r of f .x/ D 0. Suppose also that there exist constants K > 0 and L > 0
such that for all x in I we have
(i) jf 00.x/j  K and
(ii) jf 0.x/j  L.
Then
(a) jxnC1  rj  K
2LjxnC1  xnj2 and
(b) jxnC1  rj  K
2Ljxn  rj2.
Conditions (i) and (ii) assert that near r the slope of y D f .x/ is not too small in size
and does not change too rapidly. If K=.2L/ < 1, the theorem shows that xn converges
quickly to r once n becomes large enough that jxn  rj < 1.
The proof of Theorem 2 depends on the Mean-Value Theorem. We will not give
it since the theorem is of little practical use. In practice, we calculate successive ap-
proximations using Newton’s formula and observe whether they seem to converge to a
limit. If they do, and if the values of f at these approximations approach 0, we can be
conﬁdent that we have located a root.
“Solve” Routines
C M
Many of the more advanced models of scientiﬁc calculators and most computer-based
mathematics software have built-in routines for solving general equations numerically
or, in a few cases, symbolically. These “Solve” routines assume continuity of the left
and right sides of the given equations and often require the user to specify an interval
in which to search for the root or an initial guess at the value of the root, or both.
Typically the calculator or computer software also has graphing capabilities, and you
are expected to use them to get an idea of how many roots the equation has and roughly
where they are located before invoking the solving routines. It may also be possible
to specify a tolerance on the difference of the two sides of the equation. For instance,
if we want a solution to the equation f .x/ D 0, it may be more important to us to be
sure that an approximate solution Ox satisﬁes jf . Ox/j < 0:0001 than it is to be sure that
Ox is within any particular distance of the actual root.
The methods used by the solve routines vary from one calculator or software pack-
age to another and are frequently very sophisticated, making use of numerical differ-
entiation and other techniques to ﬁnd roots very quickly, even when the search interval
is large. If you have an advanced scientiﬁc calculator and/or computer software with
similar capabilities, it is well worth your while to read the manuals that describe how
to make effective use of your hardware/software for solving equations. Applications of
mathematics to solving “real-world” problems frequently require ﬁnding approximate

25.
A
Sensitivity to initial conditions is regarded as a deﬁnitive
property of chaos. If the initial values of two sequences differ,
and the differences between the two sequences tends to grow
exponentially, the map is said to be sensitive to initial values.
Growing exponentially in this sense does not require that each
sequence grow exponentially on its own. In fact, for chaos the
growth should only be exponential in the differential. More-
over, the growth only needs to be exponential for large n.
a) Show that the logistic map is sensitive to initial conditions
by making the substitution yj D sin2 uj and taking the
differential, given that u0 is not an integral multiple of .
b) Use part (a) to show that the Newton’s Method map for
1 C x2 is also sensitive to initial conditions. Make the
reasonable assumption, based on Figure 4.16, that the
iterates neither converge nor diverge.
Exercises 26–27 constitute a proof of Theorem 1.

We could not readily see this by substituting x D 0 into the function .sin x/=x because
both sin x and x are zero at x D 0. We call .sin x/=x an indeterminate form of type
Œ0=0 at x D 0. The limit of such an indeterminate form can be any number. For

Indeterminate forms of type Œ0=0 are the most common. You can evaluate many in-
determinate forms of type Œ0=0 with simple algebra, typically by cancelling common
factors. Examples can be found in Sections 1.2 and 1.3. We will now develop another
method called l’H^opital’s Rules1 for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms of the
types Œ0=0 and Œ1=1. The other types of indeterminate forms can usually be re-
duced to one of these two by algebraic manipulation and the taking of logarithms. In
Section 4.10 we will discover yet another method for evaluating limits of type Œ0=0.
l’Hˆopital’s Rules
T H E O R E M
3
The ﬁrst l’H^opital Rule
Suppose the functions f and g are differentiable on the interval .a; b/, and g0.x/ ¤ 0
there. Suppose also that
(i)
lim
x!aC f .x/ D lim
x!aC g.x/ D 0 and
(ii)
lim
x!aC
f 0.x/
g0.x/ D L (where L is ﬁnite or 1 or 1).
Then
lim
x!aC
f .x/
g.x/ D L:
Similar results hold if every occurrence of limx!aC is replaced by limx!b or even
limx!c where a < c < b. The cases a D 1 and b D 1 are also allowed.
1 The Marquis de l’H^opital (1661–1704), for whom these rules are named, published the ﬁrst
textbook on calculus. The circumﬂex ( ^ ) did not come into use in the French language until
after the French Revolution. The Marquis would have written his name “l’Hospital.”

if x D a
and
G.x/ D

Then F and G are continuous on the interval Œa; x and differentiable on the interval
.a; x/ for every x in .a; b/. By the Generalized Mean-Value Theorem (Theorem 16 of
Section 2.8) there exists a number c in .a; x/ such that

BEWARE!
Note that in
applying l’H^opital’s Rule we
calculate the quotient of the
derivatives, not the derivative of the
quotient.
This example illustrates how calculations based on l’H^opital’s Rule are carried out.
Having identiﬁed the limit as that of a Œ0=0 indeterminate form, we replace it by
the limit of the quotient of derivatives; the existence of this latter limit will justify
the equality. It is possible that the limit of the quotient of derivatives may still be
indeterminate, in which case a second application of l’H^opital’s Rule can be made.
Such applications may be strung out until a limit can ﬁnally be extracted, which then
justiﬁes all the previous applications of the rule.

Suppose that f and g are differentiable on the interval .a; b/ and that g0.x/ ¤ 0 there.
Suppose also that

(ii)

(where L is ﬁnite, or 1 or 1).
Then

Again, similar results hold for limx!b and for limx!c, and the cases a D 1 and
b D 1 are allowed.
The proof of the second l’H^opital Rule is technically rather more difﬁcult than that
of the ﬁrst Rule and we will not give it here. A sketch of the proof is outlined in
Exercise 35 at the end of this section.

CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
Remark
Do not try to use l’H^opital’s Rules to evaluate limits that are not indeter-
minate of type Œ0=0 or Œ1=1; such attempts will almost always lead to false con-
clusions, as observed in Example 3(b) above. (Strictly speaking, the second l’H^opital
Rule can be applied to the form Œa=1, but there is no point to doing so if a is not
inﬁnite, since the limit is obviously 0 in that case.)
Remark
No conclusion about lim f .x/=g.x/ can be made using either l’H^opital
Rule if lim f 0.x/=g0.x/ does not exist. Other techniques might still be used. For
example, limx!0 .x2 sin.1=x//= sin.x/ D 0 by the Squeeze Theorem even though
limx!0 .2x sin.1=x/  cos.1=x//= cos.x/ does not exist.

take logarithms of the expressions involved. Here are two examples.

CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
4.4
Extreme Values
The ﬁrst derivative of a function is a source of much useful information about the
behaviour of the function. As we have already seen, the sign of f 0 tells us whether f
is increasing or decreasing. In this section we use this information to ﬁnd maximum
and minimum values of functions. In Section 4.8 we will put the techniques developed
here to use solving problems that require ﬁnding maximum and minimum values.
Maximum and Minimum Values
Recall (from Section 1.4) that a function has a maximum value at x0 if f .x/  f .x0/
for all x in the domain of f: The maximum value is f .x0/. To be more precise, we
should call such a maximum value an absolute or global maximum because it is the
largest value that f attains anywhere on its entire domain.
DEFINITION
1
Absolute extreme values
Function f has an absolute maximum value f .x0/ at the point x0 in its
domain if f .x/  f .x0/ holds for every x in the domain of f:
Similarly, f has an absolute minimum value f .x1/ at the point x1 in its
domain if f .x/  f .x1/ holds for every x in the domain of f:
A function can have at most one absolute maximum or minimum value, although this
value can be assumed at many points. For example, f .x/ D sin x has absolute maxi-
mum value 1 occurring at every point of the form x D .=2/C2n, where n is an inte-
ger, and an absolute minimum value 1 at every point of the form x D .=2/C2n.
A function need not have any absolute extreme values. The function f .x/ D 1=x be-
comes arbitrarily large as x approaches 0 from the right, so has no ﬁnite absolute
maximum. (Remember, 1 is not a number and is not a value of f:) It doesn’t have an
absolute minimum either. Even a bounded function may not have an absolute maxi-
mum or minimum value. The function g.x/ D x with domain speciﬁed to be the open
interval .0; 1/ has neither; the range of g is also the interval .0; 1/, and there is no
largest or smallest number in this interval. Of course, if the domain of g (and therefore
also its range) were extended to be the closed interval Œ0; 1, then g would have both a
maximum value, 1, and a minimum value, 0.
Maximum and minimum values of a function are collectively referred to as ex-
treme values. The following theorem is a restatement (and slight generalization) of
Theorem 8 of Section 1.4. It will prove very useful in some circumstances when we
want to ﬁnd extreme values.
T H E O R E M
5
Existence of extreme values
If the domain of the function f is a closed, ﬁnite interval or a union of ﬁnitely many
such intervals, and if f is continuous on that domain, then f must have an absolute
maximum value and an absolute minimum value.
Consider the graph y D f .x/ shown in Figure 4.17. Evidently the absolute maxi-
mum value of f is f .x2/, and the absolute minimum value is f .x3/. In addition to
these extreme values, f has several other “local” maximum and minimum values cor-
responding to points on the graph that are higher or lower than neighbouring points.
Observe that f has local maximum values at a, x2, x4, and x6 and local minimum
values at x1, x3, x5, and b. The absolute maximum is the highest of the local maxima;
the absolute minimum is the lowest of the local minima.

Local extreme values
Function f has a local maximum value (loc max) f .x0/ at the point x0 in
its domain provided there exists a number h > 0 such that f .x/  f .x0/
whenever x is in the domain of f and jx  x0j < h.
Similarly, f has a local minimum value (loc min) f .x1/ at the point x1 in
its domain provided there exists a number h > 0 such that f .x/  f .x1/
whenever x is in the domain of f and jx  x1j < h.
Thus, f has a local maximum (or minimum) value at x if it has an absolute maximum
(or minimum) value at x when its domain is restricted to points sufﬁciently near x.
Geometrically, the graph of f is at least as high (or low) at x as it is at nearby points.
Critical Points, Singular Points, and Endpoints
Figure 4.17 suggests that a function f .x/ can have local extreme values only at points
x of three special types:
(i) critical points of f (points x in D.f / where f 0.x/ D 0),
(ii) singular points of f (points x in D.f / where f 0.x/ is not deﬁned), and
(iii) endpoints of the domain of f (points in D.f / that do not belong to any open
interval contained in D.f /).
In Figure 4.17, x1, x3, x4, and x6 are critical points, x2 and x5 are singular points, and
a and b are endpoints.

Locating extreme values
If the function f is deﬁned on an interval I and has a local maximum (or local mini-
mum) value at point x D x0 in I, then x0 must be either a critical point of f; a singular
point of f; or an endpoint of I:
PROOF
Suppose that f has a local maximum value at x0 and that x0 is neither an
endpoint of the domain of f nor a singular point of f: Then for some h > 0, f .x/ is
deﬁned on the open interval .x0  h; x0 C h/ and has an absolute maximum (for that
interval) at x0. Also, f 0.x0/ exists. By Theorem 14 of Section 2.8, f 0.x0/ D 0. The
proof for the case where f has a local minimum value at x0 is similar.
Although a function cannot have extreme values anywhere other than at endpoints,
critical points, and singular points, it need not have extreme values at such points.
Figure 4.18 shows the graph of a function with a critical point x0 and a singular point
x1 at neither of which it has an extreme value. It is more difﬁcult to draw the graph of a
function whose domain has an endpoint at which the function fails to have an extreme
value. See Exercise 49 at the end of this section for an example of such a function.

Finding Absolute Extreme Values
If a function f is deﬁned on a closed interval or a union of ﬁnitely many closed in-
tervals, Theorem 5 assures us that f must have an absolute maximum value and an
absolute minimum value. Theorem 6 tells us how to ﬁnd them. We need only check
the values of f at any critical points, singular points, and endpoints.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the maximum and minimum values of the function
g.x/ D x3  3x2  9x C 2 on the interval 2  x  2.
Solution
Since g is a polynomial, it can have no singular points. For critical points,
we calculate

D 3.x C 1/.x  3/
D 0
if
x D 1 or x D 3:
However, x D 3 is not in the domain of g, so we can ignore it. We need to consider
only the values of g at the critical point x D 1 and at the endpoints x D 2 and
x D 2:
g.2/ D 0;
g.1/ D 7;
g.2/ D 20:
The maximum value of g.x/ on 2  x  2 is 7, at the critical point x D 1, and the
minimum value is 20, at the endpoint x D 2. See Figure 4.19.

Note that x1=3 is not deﬁned at the point x D 0 in D.h/, so x D 0 is a singular
point of h. Also, h has a critical point where x1=3 D 1, that is, at x D 1, which also
happens to be an endpoint of the domain of h. We must therefore examine the values
of h at the points x D 0 and x D 1, as well as at the other endpoint x D 1. We have
h.1/ D 5;
h.0/ D 0;
h.1/ D 1:
The function h has maximum value 5 at the endpoint 1 and minimum value 0 at the
singular point x D 0. See Figure 4.20.

The First Derivative Test
Most functions you will encounter in elementary calculus have nonzero derivatives ev-
erywhere on their domains except possibly at a ﬁnite number of critical points, singular
points, and endpoints of their domains. On intervals between these points the deriva-
tive exists and is not zero, so the function is either increasing or decreasing there. If
f is continuous and increases to the left of x0 and decreases to the right, then it must
have a local maximum value at x0. The following theorem collects several results of
this type together.

The First Derivative Test
PART I. Testing interior critical points and singular points.
Suppose that f is continuous at x0, and x0 is not an endpoint of the domain of f:
(a) If there exists an open interval .a; b/ containing x0 such that f 0.x/ > 0 on .a; x0/
and f 0.x/ < 0 on .x0; b/, then f has a local maximum value at x0.
(b) If there exists an open interval .a; b/ containing x0 such that f 0.x/ < 0 on .a; x0/
and f 0.x/ > 0 on .x0; b/, then f has a local minimum value at x0.
PART II. Testing endpoints of the domain.
Suppose a is a left endpoint of the domain of f and f is right continuous at a.
(c) If f 0.x/ > 0 on some interval .a; b/, then f has a local minimum value at a.
(d) If f 0.x/ < 0 on some interval .a; b/, then f has a local maximum value at a.
Suppose b is a right endpoint of the domain of f and f is left continuous at b.
(e) If f 0.x/ > 0 on some interval .a; b/, then f has a local maximum value at b.
(f) If f 0.x/ < 0 on some interval .a; b/, then f has a local minimum value at b.
Remark
If f 0 is positive (or negative) on both sides of a critical or singular point,
then f has neither a maximum nor a minimum value at that point.
EXAMPLE 3
Find the local and absolute extreme values of f .x/ D x42x23
on the interval Œ2; 2. Sketch the graph of f:
Solution
We begin by calculating and factoring the derivative f 0.x/:
f 0.x/ D 4x3  4x D 4x.x2  1/ D 4x.x  1/.x C 1/:
The critical points are 0, 1, and 1.
The corresponding values are f .0/ D 3,
f .1/ D f .1/ D 4. There are no singular points. The values of f at the endpoints
2 and 2 are f .2/ D f .2/ D 5. The factored form of f 0.x/ is also convenient for
determining the sign of f 0.x/ on intervals between these endpoints and critical points.
Where an odd number of the factors of f 0.x/ are negative, f 0.x/ will itself be nega-
tive; where an even number of factors are negative, f 0.x/ will be positive. We sum-
marize the positive/negative properties of f 0.x/ and the implied increasing/decreasing
behaviour of f .x/ in chart form:

Functions Not Deﬁned on Closed, Finite Intervals
If the function f is not deﬁned on a closed, ﬁnite interval, then Theorem 5 cannot be
used to guarantee the existence of maximum and minimum values for f: Of course,
f may still have such extreme values. In many applied situations we will want to ﬁnd
extreme values of functions deﬁned on inﬁnite and/or open intervals. The following
theorem adapts Theorem 5 to cover some such situations.
T H E O R E M
8
Existence of extreme values on open intervals
If f is continuous on the open interval .a; b/, and if
lim
x!aC f .x/ D L
and
lim
x!b f .x/ D M;
then the following conclusions hold:
(i) If f .u/ > L and f .u/ > M for some u in .a; b/, then f has an absolute maxi-
mum value on .a; b/.
(ii) If f .v/ < L and f .v/ < M for some v in .a; b/, then f has an absolute minimum
value on .a; b/.
In this theorem a may be 1, in which case limx!aC should be replaced with
limx!1, and b may be 1, in which case limx!b should be replaced with limx!1.
Also, either or both of L and M may be either 1 or 1.
PROOF
We prove part (i); the proof of (ii) is similar. We are given that there is a
number u in .a; b/ such that f .u/ > L and f .u/ > M. Here, L and M may be ﬁnite
numbers or 1. Since limx!aC f .x/ D L, there must exist a number x1 in .a; u/
such that
f .x/ < f .u/
whenever
a < x < x1:
Similarly, there must exist a number x2 in .u; b/ such that
f .x/ < f .u/
whenever
x2 < x < b:
(See Figure 4.23.) Thus, f .x/ < f .u/ at all points of .a; b/ that are not in the closed,
ﬁnite subinterval Œx1; x2. By Theorem 5, the function f; being continuous on Œx1; x2,
must have an absolute maximum value on that interval, say at the point w. Since u
belongs to Œx1; x2, we must have f .w/  f .u/, so f .w/ is the maximum value of
f .x/ for all of .a; b/.

Theorem 6 still tells us where to look for extreme values. There are no endpoints to
consider in an open interval, but we must still look at the values of the function at any
critical points or singular points in the interval.
EXAMPLE 5
Show that f .x/ D x C .4=x/ has an absolute minimum value on
the interval .0; 1/, and ﬁnd that minimum value.
Solution
We have
lim
x!0C f .x/ D 1
and
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 1:
Since f .1/ D 5 < 1, Theorem 8 guarantees that f must have an absolute minimum
value at some point in .0; 1/. To ﬁnd the minimum value we must check the values of
f at any critical points or singular points in the interval. We have

which equals 0 only at x D 2 and x D 2. Since f has domain .0; 1/, it has no
singular points and only one critical point, namely, x D 2, where f has the value
f .2/ D 4. This must be the minimum value of f on .0; 1/. (See Figure 4.24.)

Concavity and Inﬂections
Like the ﬁrst derivative, the second derivative of a function also provides useful infor-
mation about the behaviour of the function and the shape of its graph: it determines
whether the graph is bending upward (i.e., has increasing slope) or bending downward
(i.e., has decreasing slope) as we move along the graph toward the right.

SECTION 4.5:
Concavity and Inﬂections
243
DEFINITION
3
We say that the function f is concave up on an open interval I if it is differ-
entiable there and the derivative f 0 is an increasing function on I: Similarly,
f is concave down on I if f 0 exists and is decreasing on I:
The terms “concave up” and “concave down” are used to describe the graph of the
function as well as the function itself.
Note that concavity is deﬁned only for differentiable functions, and even for those,
only on intervals on which their derivatives are not constant. According to the above
deﬁnition, a function is neither concave up nor concave down on an interval where
its graph is a straight line segment. We say the function has no concavity on such an
interval. We also say a function has opposite concavity on two intervals if it is concave
up on one interval and concave down on the other.
The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 4.26 is concave up on the interval
.a; b/ and concave down on the interval .b; c/.
Some geometric observations can be made about concavity:
(i) If f is concave up on an interval, then, on that interval, the graph of f lies above
its tangents, and chords joining points on the graph lie above the graph.
(ii) If f is concave down on an interval, then, on that interval, the graph of f lies
below its tangents, and chords to the graph lie below the graph.
(iii) If the graph of f has a tangent at a point, and if the concavity of f is opposite on
opposite sides of that point, then the graph crosses its tangent at that point. (This
occurs at the point

b; f .b/

in Figure 4.26. Such a point is called an inﬂection
point of the graph of f:)

Inﬂection points
We say that the point

x0; f .x0/

is an inﬂection point of the curve y D
f .x/ (or that the function f has an inﬂection point at x0) if the following
two conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) the graph of y D f .x/ has a tangent line at x D x0, and
(b) the concavity of f is opposite on opposite sides of x0.
Note that (a) implies that either f is differentiable at x0 or its graph has a vertical
tangent line there, and (b) implies that the graph crosses its tangent line at x0. An
inﬂection point of a function f is a point on the graph of a function, rather than a
point in its domain like a critical point or a singular point. A function may or may
not have an inﬂection point at a critical point or singular point. In general, a point P

244
CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
is an inﬂection point (or simply an inﬂection) of a curve C (which is not necessarily
the graph of a function) if C has a tangent at P and arcs of C extending in opposite
directions from P are on opposite sides of that tangent line.
Figures 4.27–4.29 illustrate some situations involving critical and singular points
and inﬂections.

If a function f has a second derivative f 00, the sign of that second derivative tells
us whether the ﬁrst derivative f 0 is increasing or decreasing and hence determines the
concavity of f:
T H E O R E M
9
Concavity and the second derivative
(a) If f 00.x/ > 0 on interval I; then f is concave up on I:
(b) If f 00.x/ < 0 on interval I; then f is concave down on I:
(c) If f has an inﬂection point at x0 and f 00.x0/ exists, then f 00.x0/ D 0.
PROOF
Parts (a) and (b) follow from applying Theorem 12 of Section 2.8 to the
derivative f 0 of f: If f has an inﬂection point at x0 and f 00.x0/ exists, then f must
be differentiable in an open interval containing x0. Since f 0 is increasing on one side
of x0 and decreasing on the other side, it must have a local maximum or minimum
value at x0. By Theorem 6, f 00.x0/ D 0.
Theorem 9 tells us that to ﬁnd (the x-coordinates of) inﬂection points of a twice dif-
ferentiable function f; we need only look at points where f 00.x/ D 0. However,
not every such point has to be an inﬂection point. For example, f .x/ D x4, whose

f 00.0/ D 12x2jxD0 D 0. In fact, x4 is concave up on every interval.

We have
f 0.x/ D 6x5  40x3;
f 00.x/ D 30x4  120x2 D 30x2.x  2/.x C 2/:
Having factored f 00.x/ in this manner, we can see that it vanishes only at x D 2,
x D 0, and x D 2. On the intervals .1; 2/ and .2; 1/, f 00.x/ > 0, so f is

concave up. On .2; 0/ and .0; 2/, f 00.x/ < 0, so f is concave down. f 00.x/ changes
sign as we pass through 2 and 2. Since f .˙2/ D 96, the graph of f has inﬂection
points at .˙2; 96/. However, f 00.x/ does not change sign at x D 0, since x2 > 0
for both positive and negative x. Thus, there is no inﬂection point at 0. As was the
case for the ﬁrst derivative, information about the sign of f 00.x/ and the consequent
concavity of f can be conveniently conveyed in a chart:

The Second Derivative Test
A function f will have a local maximum (or minimum) value at a critical point if its
graph is concave down (or up) in an interval containing that point. In fact, we can
often use the value of the second derivative at the critical point to determine whether
the function has a local maximum or a local minimum value there.
T H E O R E M

The Second Derivative Test
(a) If f 0.x0/ D 0 and f 00.x0/ < 0, then f has a local maximum value at x0.
(b) If f 0.x0/ D 0 and f 00.x0/ > 0, then f has a local minimum value at x0.
(c) If f 0.x0/ D 0 and f 00.x0/ D 0, no conclusion can be drawn; f may have a local
maximum at x0 or a local minimum, or it may have an inﬂection point instead.

PROOF
Suppose that f 0.x0/ D 0 and f 00.x0/ < 0. Since
lim
h!0
f 0.x0 C h/
h
D lim
h!0
f 0.x0 C h/  f 0.x0/
h
D f 00.x0/ < 0;
it follows that f 0.x0 C h/ < 0 for all sufﬁciently small positive h, and f 0.x0 C h/ > 0
for all sufﬁciently small negative h. By the ﬁrst derivative test (Theorem 7), f must
have a local maximum value at x0. The proof of the local minimum case is similar.
The functions f .x/ D x4 (Figure 4.30), f .x/ D x4, and f .x/ D x3 (Figure 4.27)
all satisfy f 0.0/ D 0 and f 00.0/ D 0. But x4 has a minimum value at x D 0, x4
has a maximum value at x D 0, and x3 has neither a maximum nor a minimum value
at x D 0 but has an inﬂection there. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusion about
the nature of a critical point based on knowing that f 00.x/ D 0 there.
EXAMPLE 3
Find and classify the critical points of f .x/ D x2ex.
Solution
We begin by calculating the ﬁrst two derivatives of f :
f 0.x/ D .2x  x2/ex D x.2  x/ex D 0
at x D 0 and x D 2;
f 00.x/ D .2  4x C x2/ex
f 00.0/ D 2 > 0;
f 00.2/ D 2e2 < 0:
Thus, f has a local minimum value at x D 0 and a local maximum value at x D 2.

For many functions the second derivative is more complicated to calculate than the
ﬁrst derivative, so the First Derivative Test is likely to be of more use in classifying
critical points than is the Second Derivative Test. Also note that the First Derivative
Test can classify local extreme values that occur at endpoints and singular points as
well as at critical points.
It is possible to generalize the Second Derivative Test to obtain a higher derivative
test to deal with some situations where the second derivative is zero at a critical point.

4.6
Sketching the Graph of a Function
When sketching the graph y D f .x/ of a function f , we have three sources of useful
information:
(i) the function f itself, from which we determine the coordinates of some points
on the graph, the symmetry of the graph, and any asymptotes;
(ii) the ﬁrst derivative, f 0, from which we determine the intervals of increase and
decrease and the location of any local extreme values; and
(iii) the second derivative, f 00, from which we determine the concavity and inﬂection
points, and sometimes extreme values.
Items (ii) and (iii) were explored in the previous two sections. In this section we
consider what we can learn from the function itself about the shape of its graph, and
then we illustrate the entire sketching procedure with several examples using all three
sources of information.
We could sketch a graph by plotting the coordinates of many points on it and join-
ing them by a suitably smooth curve. This is what computer software and graphics
calculators do. When carried out by hand (without a computer or calculator), this sim-
plistic approach is at best tedious and at worst can fail to reveal the most interesting
aspects of the graph (singular points, extreme values, and so on). We could also com-
pute the slope at each of the plotted points and, by drawing short line segments through
these points with the appropriate slopes, ensure that the sketched graph passes through
each plotted point with the correct slope. A more efﬁcient procedure is to obtain the
coordinates of only a few points and use qualitative information from the function
and its ﬁrst and second derivatives to determine the shape of the graph between these
points.

248
CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
Besides critical and singular points and inﬂections, a graph may have other “in-
teresting” points. The intercepts (points at which the graph intersects the coordinate
axes) are usually among these. When sketching any graph it is wise to try to ﬁnd
all such intercepts, that is, all points with coordinates .x; 0/ and .0; y/ that lie on the
graph. Of course, not every graph will have such points, and even when they do exist
it may not always be possible to compute them exactly. Whenever a graph is made
up of several disconnected pieces (called components), the coordinates of at least one
point on each component must be obtained. It can sometimes be useful to determine
the slopes at those points too. Vertical asymptotes (discussed below) usually break the
graph of a function into components.
Realizing that a given function possesses some symmetry can aid greatly in ob-
taining a good sketch of its graph. In Section P.4 we discussed odd and even func-
tions and observed that odd functions have graphs that are symmetric about the origin,
while even functions have graphs that are symmetric about the y-axis, as shown in
Figure 4.34. These are the symmetries you are most likely to notice, but functions can
have other symmetries. For example, the graph of 2 C .x  1/2 will certainly be sym-
metric about the line x D 1, and the graph of 2 C .x  3/3 is symmetric about the
point .3; 2/.

Asymptotes
Some of the curves we have sketched in previous sections have had asymptotes, that is,
straight lines to which the curve draws arbitrarily close as it recedes to inﬁnite distance
from the origin. Asymptotes are of three types: vertical, horizontal, and oblique.
DEFINITION

(as x ! 1) and y D .=2/ (as x ! 1). See Figure 4.37.

Recall that a rational function is a function of the form f .x/ D P.x/=Q.x/, where
P and Q are polynomials. Following observations made in Sections P.6, 1.2, and 1.3,
we can be quite speciﬁc about the asymptotes of a rational function.
Asymptotes of a rational function
Suppose that f .x/ D Pm.x/
Qn.x/, where Pm and Qn are polynomials of degree
m and n, respectively. Suppose also that Pm and Qn have no common linear
factors. Then
(a) The graph of f has a vertical asymptote at every position x such that
Qn.x/ D 0.
(b) The graph of f has a two-sided horizontal asymptote y D 0 if m < n.
(c) The graph of f has a two-sided horizontal asymptote y D L, .L ¤ 0/ if
m D n. L is the quotient of the coefﬁcients of the highest degree terms
in Pm and Qn.
(d) The graph of f has a two-sided oblique asymptote if m D n C 1. This
asymptote can be found by dividing Qn into Pm to obtain a linear quo-
tient, ax C b, and remainder, R, a polynomial of degree at most n  1.
That is,

The oblique asymptote is y D ax C b.

Examples of Formal Curve Sketching
Here is a checklist of things to consider when you are asked to make a careful sketch
of the graph of y D f .x/. It will, of course, not always be possible to obtain every
item of information mentioned in the list.
Checklist for curve sketching
1. Calculate f 0.x/ and f 00.x/, and express the results in factored form.
2. Examine f .x/ to determine its domain and the following items:
(a) Any vertical asymptotes. (Look for zeros of denominators.)
(b) Any horizontal or oblique asymptotes. (Consider limx!˙1 f .x/.)
(c) Any obvious symmetry. (Is f even or odd?)
(d) Any easily calculated intercepts (points with coordinates .x; 0/ or
.0; y/) or endpoints or other “obvious” points. You will add to this
list when you know any critical points, singular points, and inﬂection
points. Eventually you should make sure you know the coordinates
of at least one point on every component of the graph.
3. Examine f 0.x/ for the following:
(a) Any critical points.
(b) Any points where f 0 is not deﬁned. (These will include singular
points, endpoints of the domain of f; and vertical asymptotes.)
(c) Intervals on which f 0 is positive or negative. It’s a good idea to con-
vey this information in the form of a chart such as those used in the
examples. Conclusions about where f is increasing and decreas-
ing and classiﬁcation of some critical and singular points as local
maxima and minima can also be indicated on the chart.
4. Examine f 00.x/ for the following:
(a) Points where f 00.x/ D 0.
(b) Points where f 00.x/ is undeﬁned. (These will include singular points,
endpoints, vertical asymptotes, and possibly other points as well,
where f 0 is deﬁned but f 00 isn’t.)
(c) Intervals where f 00 is positive or negative and where f is therefore
concave up or down. Use a chart.
(d) Any inﬂection points.
When you have obtained as much of this information as possible, make a careful sketch
that reﬂects everything you have learned about the function. Consider where best to
place the axes and what scale to use on each so the “interesting features” of the graph
show up most clearly. Be alert for seeming inconsistencies in the information—that is

252
CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
a strong suggestion you may have made an error somewhere. For example, if you have
determined that f .x/ ! 1 as x approaches the vertical asymptote x D a from the
right, and also that f is decreasing and concave down on the interval .a; b/, then you
have very likely made an error. (Try to sketch such a situation to see why.)

CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
4.7
Graphing with Computers
The techniques for sketching, developed in the previous section, are useful for graphs of
functions that are simple enough to allow you to calculate and analyze their derivatives.
They are also essential for testing the validity of graphs produced by computers or
calculators, which can be inaccurate or misleading for a variety of reasons, including
the case of numerical monsters introduced in previous chapters. In practice, it is often
easiest to ﬁrst produce a graph using a computer or graphing calculator, but many
times this will not turn out to be the last step. (We will use the term “computer” for
both computers and calculators.) For many simple functions this can be a quick and
painless activity, but sometimes functions have properties that complicate the process.
Knowledge of the function, from techniques like those above, is important to guide you
on what the next steps must be.
The Maple command1 for viewing the graph of the function from Example 6
of Section 4.6, together with its oblique asymptote, is a straightforward example of
plotting; we ask Maple to plot both .x2 C 2x C 4/=.2x/ and 1 C .x=2/:
>
plot(f(x^2+2*x+4)/(2*x), 1+(x/2)g, x=-6..6, y=-7..7);
This command sets the window 6  x  6 and 7  y  7. Why that window? To
get a plot that characterizes the function, knowledge of its vertical asymptote at x D 0
is essential. (If x  10 were substituted for x in the expression, the given window
would no longer produce a reasonable graph of the key features of the function. The
new function would be better viewed on the interval 4  x  16.) If the range Œ7; 7
were not speciﬁed, the computer would plot all of the points where it evaluates the
function, including those very close to the vertical asymptote where the function is
very large. The resulting plot would compress all of the features of the graph onto the
x-axis. Even the asymptote would look like a horizontal line in that scaling. You might
even miss the vertical asymptote, which is squeezed into the y-axis.
Getting Maple to plot the curve in Example 9 of Section 4.6 is a bit trickier. Be-
cause Maple doesn’t deal well with fractional powers of negative numbers, even when
they have positive real values, we must actually plot jx2  1j2=3 or ..x2  1/2/1=3.
Otherwise, the part of the graph between 1 and 1 will be missing. Either of the plot
commands
>
plot((abs(x^2-1))^(2/3), x=-4..4, y=-1..5);
>
plot(((x^2-1)^2)^(1/3), x=-4..4, y=-1..5);
will produce the desired graph. In order to ensure a complete plot with all of the
features of the function present, the graph of the simple expression should be viewed
critically, and not taken at face value.
Numerical Monsters and Computer Graphing
K
The next obvious problem is that of false features and false behaviours. Functions that
are mathematically well-behaved can still be computationally poorly behaved, leading
to false features on graphs, as we have already seen.
EXAMPLE 1
Consider the function f .x/ D ex ln.1 C ex/, which has suitably
simpliﬁed derivative
f 0.x/ D ex g.x/;
where
g.x/ D ln.1 C ex/

ex C 1:
In turn, the derivative of g.x/ simpliﬁes to
g0.x/ D 
1
.ex C 1/2 ;

presented are general ones, pertaining to all software and computers.

which is negative for all x, so g is decreasing. Since g.0/ D ln 2  1=2 > 0 and
limx!1 g.x/ D 0, it follows that g.x/ > 0 and decreasing for all x. Thus, f 0.x/ is
positive, and f .x/ is an increasing function for all x. Furthermore, l’H^opital’s Rules
show that
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 1
and
lim
x!1 f .x/ D 0:
This gives us a pretty full picture of how the function f behaves. It grows with increas-
ing x from 0 at 1, crosses the y-axis at ln 2, and ﬁnally approaches 1 asymptotically
from below as x increases toward 1.
Now let’s plot the graph of f using the Maple command
>
plot(exp(x)*ln(1+(1/exp(x))), x=-20..45, style=point,
symbol=point, numpoints=1500);

x
The result is shown in Figure 4.45. Clearly something is wrong. From x D 20
to about x D 30, the graph behaves in accordance with the mathematical analysis.
However, for larger values of x, peculiarities emerge that sharply disagree with the
analysis. The calculus of this chapter tells us that the function is increasing with no
horizontal tangents, but the computer suggests that it decreases in some places. The
calculus tells us that the function rises asymptotically to 1, but the computer suggests
that the function starts to oscillate and ultimately becomes 0 at about x D 36.
This is another numerical monster. What a computer does can simply be wrong.
In this case, it is signiﬁcantly so. In practical applications an erroneous value of 0
instead of 1 could, for example, be a factor in a product, and that would change every-
thing dramatically. If the mathematics were not known in this case, how could we
even know that the computer is wrong? Another computer cannot be used to check
it, as the problem is one that all computers share. Another program cannot be used
because all software must use the special ﬂoating-point arithmetic that is subject to the
roundoff errors responsible for the problem. Figure 4.45 is not particular to Maple.
This monster, or one much like it, can be created in nearly any software package.
Floating-Point Representation of Numbers in Computers
It is necessary that you know mathematics in order to use computers correctly and
effectively. It is equally necessary to understand why all computers fail to fully capture
the mathematics. As indicated previously, the reason is that no computer can represent
all numbers. Computer designers artfully attempt to minimize the effects of this by
making the number of representable numbers as large as possible. But, speaking in
terms of physics, a ﬁnite-sized machine can only represent a ﬁnite number of numbers.
Having only a ﬁnite number of numbers leads to numbers sufﬁciently small, compared
to 1, that the computer simply discards them in a sum. When digits are lost in this
manner, the resulting error is known as roundoff error.
In many cases the ﬁniteness shows up in the use of ﬂoating-point numbers and
a set of corresponding arithmetic rules that approximate correct arithmetic. These
approximate rules and approximate representations are not unique by any means. For
example, the software package Derive uses so-called slash arithmetic, which works

258
CHAPTER 4
More Applications of Differentiation
with a representation of numbers as continued fractions instead of decimals. This has
certain advantages and disadvantages, but, in the end, ﬁniteness forces truncation just
the same.
The term “roundoff” implies that there is some kind of mitigation procedure or
rounding done to reduce error once the smallest digits have been discarded. There are
a number of different kinds of rounding practices. The various options can be quite in-
tricate, but they all begin with the aim to slightly reduce error as a result of truncation.
The truncation is the source of error, not the rounding, despite the terminology that
seems to suggest otherwise. The entire process of truncation and rounding have come
to be termed “roundoff,” although the details of the error mitigation are immaterial for
the purposes of this discussion. Rounding is beyond the scope of this section and will
not be considered further.
Historically, the term “decimal” implies base ten, but the idea works the same
in any base. In particular, in any base, multiplying by the base to an integral power
simply shifts the position of the “decimal point.” Thus, multiplying or dividing by the
base is known as a shift operation. The term “ﬂoating-point” signiﬁes this shifting
of the point to the left or right. The general technical term for the decimal point is
radix point. Speciﬁcally for base two, the point is sometimes called the binary point.
However, we will use the term decimal point or just decimal for all bases, as the
etymological purity is not worth having several names for one small symbol.
While computers, for the most part, work in base two, they can be and have been
built in other bases. For example, there have been base-three computers, and many
computers group numbers so that they work as if they were built in base eight (octal)
or base sixteen (hexadecimal). (If you are feeling old, quote your age in hexadecimal.
For example, 48 D 3  16 or 30 in hexadecimal. If you are feeling too young, use
octal.)
In a normal binary computer, ﬂoating-point numbers approximate the mathemati-
cal real numbers. Several bytes of memory (frequently 8 bytes) are allocated for each
ﬂoating-point number. Each byte consists of eight bits, each of which has two (phys-
ical) states and can thus store one of the two base-two digits “0” or “1,” as it is the
equivalent of a switch being either off or on.
Thus, an eight-byte allocation for a ﬂoating-point number can store 64 bits of
data. The computer uses something similar to scientiﬁc notation, which is often used
to express numbers in base ten. However, the convention is to place the decimal im-
mediately to the left of all signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For example, the computer convention
would call for the base-ten number 284,070,000 to be represented as 0:28407  109.
Here 0.28407 is called the mantissa, and it has 5 signiﬁcant base-ten digits follow-
ing the decimal point, the 2 being the most signiﬁcant and the 7 the least signiﬁcant
digit. The 9 in the factor 109 is called the exponent, which deﬁnes the number of
shift operations needed to locate the correct position of the decimal point of the actual
number.
The computer only needs to represent the mantissa and the exponent, each with its
appropriate sign. The base is set by the architecture and so is not stored. Neither is the
decimal point nor the leading zero in the mantissa stored. These are all just implied.
If the ﬂoating-point number has 64 bits, two are used for the two signs, leaving 62 bits
for signiﬁcant digits in the mantissa and the exponent.
As an example of base two (i.e., binary) representation, the number
101:011 D 1  22 C 0  21 C 1  20 C 0  21 C 1  22 C 1  23
stands for the base-ten number 4 + 1 + (1/4) + (1/8) = 43/8. On a computer the stored
bits would be +101011 for the mantissa and +11 for the exponent. Thus, the base-two
ﬂoating-point form is 0:10101123, with mantissa 0.101011 and exponent 3. Note that
we are representing the exponent in base ten (3), and not base two (11), because that is
more convenient for counting shift operations.

SECTION 4.7:
Graphing with Computers
259
While the base-two representation of two is 10, we will continue, for convenience,
to write two as 2 when using it as the base for base-two representations. After all, any
base b is represented by 10 with respect to itself as base. So, if we chose to write the
number above as 0:101011  1011, the numeral could as well denote a number in any
base. However, for us people normally thinking in base ten, 0:101011  23 clearly
indicates that the base is two and the decimal point is shifted 3 digits to the right of the
most signiﬁcant digit in the mantissa.
Now consider x D 0:101  210 D 0:0000000000101, the base-two ﬂoating-
point number whose value as a base-ten fraction is x D 5=8192. The only signiﬁcant
base-two digits are the 101 in the mantissa. Now add x to 1; the result is
1 C x D 0:10000000000101  21;
which has mantissa 0.10000000000101 and exponent 1. The mantissa now has 14 sig-
niﬁcant base-two digits; all the zeros between the ﬁrst and last 1s are signiﬁcant. If
your computer or calculator software only allocates, say, 12 bits for mantissas, then
it would be unable to represent 1 C x. It would have to throw away the two least
signiﬁcant base-two digits and save the number as
1 C x D 0:100000000001  21 D 2;049
2;048;
thus creating a roundoff error of 1/8,192. Even worse, if only ten base-two digits were
used to store mantissas, the computer would store 1 C x D 0:1000000000  21 (i.e., it
would not be able to distinguish 1 C x from 1). Of course, calculators and computer
software use many more than ten or twelve base-two digits to represent mantissas of
ﬂoating-point numbers, but the number of digits used is certainly ﬁnite, and so the
problem of roundoff will always occur for sufﬁciently small ﬂoating-point numbers x.
Machine Epsilon and Its Effect on Figure 4.45
The smallest number x for which the computer recognizes that 1 C x is greater than 1
is called machine epsilon (denoted ) for that computer. The computer does not return
1 when evaluating 1 C , but for all positive numbers x smaller than , the computer
simply returns 1 when asked to evaluate 1 C x, because the computer only keeps a
ﬁnite number of (normally base two) digits.
When using computer algebra packages like Maple, the number of digits can be
increased in the software. Thus, the number of numbers that the computer can repre-
sent can be extended beyond what is native to the processor’s hardware, by stringing
together bits to make available larger numbers of digits for a single number. The Maple
command for this is “Digits,” which defaults to 10 (decimal digits). However, the
computer remains ﬁnite in size, so there will always be an effective value for , no
matter how the software is set. A hardware value for  is not uniform for all devices
either. Thus, for any device you may be using (calculator or computer), the value of
machine epsilon may not be immediately obvious. To anticipate where a computer may
be wrong, you need the value of machine epsilon, and you need to understand where
the function may run afoul of it. We will outline a simple way to determine this below.
In the case of the function f in Example 1, it is clear where the computer discards
digits in a sum. The factor ln.1 C ex/ decreases as x increases, but for sufﬁciently
large x a computer must discard the exponential in the sum because it is too small to
show up in the digits allotted for 1. When the exponential term decreases below the
value of , the computer will return 1 for the argument of the natural logarithm, and
the factor will be determined by the computer to be 0. Thus, f will be represented as
0 instead of nearly 1.
Of course, pathological behaviour begins to happen before the exponential ex
decreases to below . When the exponential is small enough, all change with x happens
in the smaller digits. The sum forces them to be discarded by the computer, so the

260
CHAPTER 4

change is discarded with it. That means for ﬁnite intervals the larger digits from the
decreasing exponential term do not change until the smaller changes accrue. In the
case of f; this means it behaves like an increasing exponential times a constant between
corrections of the larger digits. This is conﬁrmed in Figure 4.46, which is a close-up
of the pathological region given by adjusting the interval of the plot command.

Determining Machine Epsilon
A small alteration in the function f of Example 1 provides an easy way to determine
the value of machine epsilon. As computers store and process data in base-two form,
it is useful to use instead of f the function h.x/ D 2x ln.1 C 2x/. The Maple plot
command
>
plot(2^x*ln(1+1/2^x), x=50..55, style=line,
thickness=5, xtickmarks=[50,51,52,53,54]);
produces the graph in Figure 4.47. The graph drops to 0 at x D 53. Thus, 253 is
the next number below  that the computer can represent. Because the ﬁrst nonzero
digit in a base-two number is 1, the next largest number must be up to twice as large.
But because all higher digits are discarded, the effect is to have simply a change in the
exponent of the number, a shift operation. A single shift operation larger than 253 is
252, so  D 252 in the settings for this plot.

From this we can predict when f will drop to zero in Figure 4.45 and Figure 4.46.
It will be when =2 D 253 D ex, or approximately x D 36:74. While this seems
to give us a complete command of the effect for most computers, there is much more
going on with computer error that depends on speciﬁc algorithms. While signiﬁcant
error erupts when  is reached in a sum with 1, other sources of error are in play well
before that for smaller values of x.
It is interesting to look at some of the complex and structured patterns of error in
a close-up of what should be a single curve well before the catastrophic drop to zero.

In this ﬁgure there are many fascinating and beautiful patterns created, which are com-

points at which to evaluate the function and their placement in the plot. If you change
the plot window, try to zoom in on them, or change the numbers of points or the in-
terval; they will change too, or disappear. They are completely illusive and spurious

Extreme-Value Problems
In this section we solve various word problems that, when translated into mathemati-
cal terms, require the ﬁnding of a maximum or minimum value of a function of one
variable. Such problems can range from simple to very complex and difﬁcult; they can
be phrased in terminology appropriate to some other discipline, or they can be already
partially translated into a more mathematical context. We have already encountered a
few such problems in earlier chapters.
Let us consider a couple of examples before attempting to formulate any general
principles for dealing with such problems.
EXAMPLE 1
A rectangular animal enclosure is to be constructed having one
side along an existing long wall and the other three sides fenced.
If 100 m of fence are available, what is the largest possible area for the enclosure?
Solution
This problem, like many others, is essentially a geometric one. A sketch
should be made at the outset, as we have done in Figure 4.50. Let the length and width
of the enclosure be x and y m, respectively, and let its area be A m2. Thus A D xy.

A D xy

Since the total length of the fence is 100 m, we must have x C 2y D 100. A appears to

262
CHAPTER 4

be a function of two variables, x and y, but these variables are not independent; they
are related by the constraint x C 2y D 100. This constraint equation can be solved for
one variable in terms of the other, and A can therefore be written as a function of only
one variable:
x D 100  2y;
A D A.y/ D .100  2y/y D 100y  2y2:
Evidently, we require y  0 and y  50 (i.e., x  0) in order that the area make
sense. (It would otherwise be negative.) Thus, we must maximize the function A.y/
on the interval Œ0; 50. Being continuous on this closed, ﬁnite interval, A must have
a maximum value, by Theorem 5. Clearly, A.0/ D A.50/ D 0 and A.y/ > 0 for
0 < y < 50. Hence, the maximum cannot occur at an endpoint. Since A has no
singular points, the maximum must occur at a critical point. To ﬁnd any critical points,
we set
0 D A0.y/ D 100  4y:
Therefore, y D 25. Since A must have a maximum value and there is only one possible
point where it can be, the maximum must occur at y D 25. The greatest possible area
for the enclosure is therefore A.25/ D 1;250 m2.
EXAMPLE 2
A lighthouse L is located on a small island 5 km north of a point
A on a straight east-west shoreline. A cable is to be laid from L to
point B on the shoreline 10 km east of A. The cable will be laid through the water in a
straight line from L to a point C on the shoreline between A and B, and from there to
B along the shoreline. (See Figure 4.51.) The part of the cable lying in the water costs
$5,000/km, and the part along the shoreline costs $3,000/km.
(a) Where should C be chosen to minimize the total cost of the cable?
(b) Where should C be chosen if B is only 3 km from A?

T is continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œ0; 10, so it has a minimum value

the interval .0; 10/. (T has no singular points.) To ﬁnd any critical points, we set

This equation has two solutions, but only one, x D 15=4 D 3:75, lies in the inter-
val .0; 10/. Since T .0/ D 55;000, T .15=4/ D 50;000, and T .10/  55;902, the
critical point 3.75 evidently provides the minimum value for T .x/. For minimal
cost, C should be 3.75 km from A.

which differs from the total cost function T .x/ of part (a) only in the added con-

15=4 D 3:75, which does not lie in the interval .0; 3/. Since T .0/ D 34;000 and
T .3/  29;155, in this case we should choose x D 3. To minimize the total cost,
the cable should go straight from L to B.
Procedure for Solving Extreme-Value Problems
Based on our experience with the examples above, we can formulate a checklist of
steps involved in solving optimization problems.
Solving extreme-value problems
1. Read the problem very carefully, perhaps more than once. You must
understand clearly what is given and what must be found.
2. Make a diagram if appropriate. Many problems have a geometric com-
ponent, and a good diagram can often be an essential part of the solution
process.
3. Deﬁne any symbols you wish to use that are not already speciﬁed in the
statement of the problem.
4. Express the quantity Q to be maximized or minimized as a function of
one or more variables.
5. If Q depends on n variables, where n > 1, ﬁnd n  1 equations (con-
straints) linking these variables. (If this cannot be done, the problem
cannot be solved by single-variable techniques.)
6. Use the constraints to eliminate variables and hence express Q as a func-
tion of only one variable. Determine the interval(s) in which this vari-
able must lie for the problem to make sense. Alternatively, regard the
constraints as implicitly deﬁning n  1 of the variables, and hence Q, as
functions of the remaining variable.
7. Find the required extreme value of the function Q using the techniques of
Section 4.4. Remember to consider any critical points, singular points,
and endpoints. Make sure to give a convincing argument that your ex-
treme value is the one being sought; for example, if you are looking for a
maximum, the value you have found should not be a minimum.
8. Make a concluding statement answering the question asked. Is your an-
swer for the question reasonable? If not, check back through the solution
to see what went wrong.

EXAMPLE 4
Find the most economical shape of a cylindrical tin can.
Solution
This problem is stated in a rather vague way. We must consider what is
meant by “most economical” and even “shape.” Without further information, we can
take one of two points of view:
(i) the volume of the tin can is to be regarded as given, and we must choose the
dimensions to minimize the total surface area, or
(ii) the total surface area is given (we can use just so much metal), and we must choose
the dimensions to maximize the volume.
We will discuss other possible interpretations later. Since a cylinder is determined by
its radius and height (Figure 4.53), its shape is determined by the ratio radius/height.
Let r, h, S, and V denote, respectively, the radius, height, total surface area, and
volume of the can. The volume of a cylinder is the base area times the height:
r
h
Figure 4.53
V D r2h:
The surface of the can is made up of the cylindrical wall and circular disks for the top
and bottom. The disks each have area r2, and the cylindrical wall is really just a
rolled-up rectangle with base 2r (the circumference of the can) and height h. There-
fore, the total surface area of the can is
S D 2rh C 2r2:
Let us use interpretation (i): V is a given constant, and S is to be minimized. We
can use the equation for V to eliminate one of the two variables r and h on which
S depends. Say we solve for h D V=.r2/ and substitute into the equation for S to
obtain S as a function of r alone:
S D S.r/ D 2r

Evidently, limr!0C S.r/ D 1 and limr!1 S.r/ D 1. Being differentiable and
therefore continuous on .0; 1/, S.r/ must have a minimum value, and it must occur
at a critical point. To ﬁnd any critical points,
0 D S 0.r/ D 2V
r2 C 4r;
r3 D 2V
4 D 1
2 r2h D 1
2 r2h:
Thus, h D 2r at the critical point of S. Under interpretation (i), the most economical
can is shaped so that its height equals the diameter of its base. You are encouraged to
show that interpretation (ii) leads to the same conclusion.
Remark
A different approach to the problem in Example 4 shows directly that in-
terpretations (i) and (ii) must give the same solution. Again, we start from the two
equations
V D r2h
and
S D 2rh C 2r2:
If we regard h as a function of r and differentiate implicitly, we obtain
dV
dr D 2rh C r2 dh
dr ;
dS
dr D 2h C 2r dh
dr C 4r:
Under interpretation (i), V is constant and we want a critical point of S; under interpre-
tation (ii), S is constant and we want a critical point of V . In either case, dV=dr D 0
and dS=dr D 0. Hence, both interpretations yield
2rh C r2 dh
dr D 0
and
2h C 4r C 2r dh
dr D 0:
If we divide the ﬁrst equation by r2 and the second equation by 2r and subtract to
eliminate dh=dr, we again get h D 2r.
Remark
Modifying Example 4 Given the sparse information provided in the state-
ment of the problem in Example 4, interpretations (i) and (ii) are the best we can do.
The problem could be made more meaningful economically (from the point of view,
say, of a tin can manufacturer) if more elements were brought into it. For example:
(a) Most cans use thicker material for the cylindrical wall than for the top and bottom
disks. If the cylindrical wall material costs $A per unit area and the material for
the top and bottom costs $B per unit area, we might prefer to minimize the total
cost of materials for a can of given volume. What is the optimal shape if A D 2B?
(b) Large numbers of cans are to be manufactured. The material is probably being
cut out of sheets of metal. The cylindrical walls are made by bending up rect-
angles, and rectangles can be cut from the sheet with little or no waste. There
will, however, always be a proportion of material wasted when the disks are cut
out. The exact proportion will depend on how the disks are arranged; two possible
arrangements are shown in Figure 4.54. What is the optimal shape of the can if a
square packing of disks is used? A hexagonal packing? Any such modiﬁcation of
the original problem will alter the optimal shape to some extent. In “real-world”
problems, many factors may have to be taken into account to come up with a “best”
Square Packing:
each disk uses up a square
Hexagonal Packing:
each disk uses up a hexagon
Figure 4.54
Square and hexagonal
packing of disks in a plane
strategy.
(c) The problem makes no provision for costs of manufacturing the can other than
the cost of sheet metal. There may also be costs for joining the opposite edges of
the rectangle to make the cylinder and for joining the top and bottom disks to the
cylinder. These costs may be proportional to the lengths of the joins.
In most of the examples above, the maximum or minimum value being sought occurred
at a critical point. Our ﬁnal example is one where this is not the case.

23. (Flying with least energy) At the altitude of airliners, winds
can typically blow at a speed of about 100 knots (nautical
miles per hour) from the west toward the east. A westward-
ﬂying passenger jet from London, England, on its way to
Toronto, ﬂies directly against this wind for 3,000 nautical
miles. The energy per unit time expended by the airliner is
proportional to v3, where v is the speed of the airliner relative
to the air. This reﬂects the power required to push aside the air
exerting ram pressure proportional to v2. What speed uses the
least energy on this trip? Estimate the time it would take to ﬂy
this route at the resulting optimal speed. Is this a typical speed
at which airliners travel? Explain.
24. (Energy for a round trip) In the preceding problem we found
that an airliner ﬂying against the wind at speed v with respect
to the air consumes the least energy over a ﬂight if it travels at
v D 3u=2, where u is the speed of the headwind with respect
to the ground. Assume the power (energy per unit time)
required to push aside the air is kv3.

trip of distance ` ﬂying with an airspeed v into a
headwind of speed u. Also write the general expression

Linear Approximations
Many problems in applied mathematics are too difﬁcult to be solved exactly—that is
why we resort to using computers, even though in many cases they may only give
approximate answers. However, not all approximation is done with machines. Linear
approximation can be a very effective way to estimate values or test the plausibility of

The linearization of function
f about a
used to approximate (changes in) the values of functions between nearby points. In this
section we reconsider such approximations in a more formal way and obtain estimates
for the size of the errors encountered when such “linear” approximations are made.
The tangent to the graph y D f .x/ at x D a describes the behaviour of that
graph near the point P D .a; f .a// better than any other straight line through P ,
because it goes through P in the same direction as the curve y D f .x/.
(See
Figure 4.63.) We exploit this fact by using the height to the tangent line to calcu-
late approximate values of f .x/ for values of x near a. The tangent line has equation
y D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/. We call the right side of this equation the linearization of
f about a (or the linearization of f .x/ about x D a).
DEFINITION
8
The linearization of the function f about a is the function L deﬁned by
L.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/:
We say that f .x/  L.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/ provides linear approxi-
mations for values of f near a.

and L.r C r/ D V.r/ C 4	r2 r. Thus,

The following example illustrates the use of linearization to ﬁnd an approximate value
of a function near a point where the values of the function and its derivative are known.
EXAMPLE 3
Use the linearization for px about x D 25 to ﬁnd an approximate

Solution
If f .x/ D px, then f 0.x/ D 1=.2px/. Since we know that f .25/ D 5

the ﬁrst place. Approximations are useful when there is no easy way to obtain the
true value. However, if we don’t know the true value, we would at least like to have
some way of determining how good the approximation must be; that is, we want an
estimate for the error. After all, any number is an approximation to
p
26, but the error
may be unacceptably large; for instance, the size of the error in the approximation
p
26  1;000;000 is greater than 999,994.
Error Analysis
In any approximation, the error is deﬁned by
error D true value  approximate value:
If the linearization of f about a is used to approximate f .x/ near x D a, that is,
f .x/  L.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/;
then the error E.x/ in this approximation is
E.x/ D f .x/  L.x/ D f .x/  f .a/  f 0.a/.x  a/:
It is the vertical distance at x between the graph of f and the tangent line to that graph
at x D a, as shown in Figure 4.64. Observe that if x is “near” a, then E.x/ is small
compared to the horizontal distance between x and a.

Remark
The error in the linearization of f .x/ about x D a can be interpreted in
terms of differentials (see Section 2.7 and the beginning of this section) as follows: if
x D dx D x  a, then the change in f .x/ as we pass from x D a to x D a C x
is f .a C x/  f .a/ D y, and the corresponding change in the linearization L.x/
is f 0.a/.x  a/ D f 0.a/ dx, which is just the value at x D a of the differential
dy D f 0.x/ dx. Thus,
E.x/ D y  dy:

The linearization of a function f .x/ about x D a, namely, the linear function
P1.x/ D L.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/;
describes the behaviour of f near a better than any other polynomial of degree 1
because both P1 and f have the same value and the same derivative at a:
P1.a/ D f .a/
and
P 0
1.a/ D f 0.a/:
(We are now using the symbol P1 instead of L to stress the fact that the linearization
is a polynomial of degree at most 1.)
We can obtain even better approximations to f .x/ by using quadratic or higher-
degree polynomials and matching more derivatives at x D a. For example, if f is
twice differentiable near a, then the polynomial
P2.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/ C f 00.a/
2
.x  a/2
satisﬁes P2.a/ D f .a/, P 0
2.a/ D f 0.a/, and P 00
2 .a/ D f 00.a/ and describes the
behaviour of f near a better than any other polynomial of degree at most 2.
In general, if f .n/.x/ exists in an open interval containing x D a, then the poly-

and so describes f .x/ near x D a better than any other polynomial of degree at most
n. Pn is called the nth-order Taylor polynomial for f about a. (Taylor polynomials
about 0 are usually called Maclaurin polynomials.) The 0th-order Taylor polynomial
for f about a is just the constant function P0.x/ D f .a/. The nth-order Taylor poly-
nomial for f about a is sometimes called the nth-degree Taylor polynomial, but its
degree will actually be less than n if f .n/.a/ D 0.

Taylor’s Theorem
If the .n C 1/st-order derivative, f .nC1/.t/, exists for all t in an interval containing a
and x, and if Pn.x/ is the nth-order Taylor polynomial for f about a, that is,
Pn.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.a/.x  a/ C f 00.a/
2Š
.x  a/2 C    C f .n/.a/
nŠ
.x  a/n;
then the error En.x/ D f .x/  Pn.x/ in the approximation f .x/  Pn.x/ is given
by
Note that the error term
(Lagrange remainder) in Taylor’s
formula looks just like the next
term in the Taylor polynomial
would look if we continued the
Taylor polynomial to include one
more term (of degree n C 1)
EXCEPT that the derivative
f .nC1/ is not evaluated at a but
rather at some (generally
unknown) point s between a and
x. This makes it easy to
remember Taylor’s formula.
En.x/ D f .nC1/.s/
.n C 1/Š .x  a/nC1;
where s is some number between a and x. The resulting formula

.x  a/2 C    C f .n/.a/
nŠ
.x  a/n
C f .nC1/.s/
.n C 1/Š .x  a/nC1;
for some s between a and x,
is called Taylor’s formula with Lagrange remainder; the Lagrange remainder term
is the explicit formula given above for En.x/.
PROOF
Observe that the case n D 0 of Taylor’s formula, namely,
f .x/ D P0.x/ C E0.x/ D f .a/ C f 0.s/
1Š
.x  a/;
is just the Mean-Value Theorem
f .x/  f .a/
x  a
D f 0.s/
for some s between a and x.
Also note that the case n D 1 is just the error formula for linearization given in
Theorem 11.
We will complete the proof for higher n using mathematical induction. (See the
proof of Theorem 2 in Section 2.3.) Suppose, therefore, that we have proved the case
n D k  1, where k  2 is an integer. Thus, we are assuming that if f is any function
whose kth derivative exists on an interval containing a and x, then
Ek1.x/ D f .k/.s/
kŠ
.x  a/k;
where s is some number between a and x. Let us consider the next higher case: n D k.
As in the proof of Theorem 11, we assume x > a (the case x < a is similar) and apply
the Generalized Mean-Value Theorem to the functions Ek.t/ and .t  a/kC1 on Œa; x.
Since Ek.a/ D 0, we obtain a number u in .a; x/ such that

We have shown that the case n D k of Taylor’s Theorem is true if the case n D k  1
is true, and the inductive proof is complete.
Remark
For any value of x for which limn!1 En.x/ D 0, we can ensure that
the Taylor approximation f .x/  Pn.x/ is as close as we want by choosing n large
enough.

Use Taylor’s Theorem to conﬁrm that the Maclaurin polynomial

To get an approximation for e D e1 correct to 3 decimal places, we need to have

Big-O Notation
DEFINITION
9
We write f .x/ D O

u.x/

as x ! a (read this “f .x/ is big-Oh of u.x/ as
x approaches a”) provided that
jf .x/j  Kju.x/j
holds for some constant K on some open interval containing x D a.
Similarly, f .x/ D g.x/ C O

as
x ! a, that is, if
jf .x/  g.x/j  Kju.x/j
near a:
For example, sin x D O.x/ as x ! 0 because j sin xj  jxj near 0.
The following properties of big-O notation follow from the deﬁnition:
(i) If f .x/ D O

u.x/

as x ! a, then Cf .x/ D O

u.x/

as x ! a for any value

Taylor’s Theorem says that if f .nC1/.t/ exists on an interval containing a and x,
and if Pn is the nth-order Taylor polynomial for f at a, then, as x ! a,
f .x/ D Pn.x/ C O

.x  a/nC1
:
This is a statement about how rapidly the graph of the Taylor polynomial Pn.x/ ap-
proaches that of f .x/ as x ! a; the vertical distance between the graphs decreases as
fast as jx  ajnC1. The following theorem shows that the Taylor polynomial Pn.x/ is
the only polynomial of degree at most n whose graph approximates the graph of f .x/
that rapidly.
T H E O R E M

If f .x/ D Qn.x/ C O

.x  a/nC1
as x ! a, where Qn is a polynomial of degree at
most n, then Qn.x/ D Pn.x/, that is, Qn is the Taylor polynomial for f .x/ at x D a.
PROOF
Let Pn be the Taylor polynomial, then properties (i) and (ii) of big-O imply
that Rn.x/ D Qn.x/  Pn.x/ D O

.x  a/nC1
as x ! a. We want to show
that Rn.x/ is identically zero so that Qn.x/ D Pn.x/ for all x. By replacing x with
a C .x  a/ and expanding powers, we can write Rn.x/ in the form
Rn.x/ D c0 C c1.x  a/ C c2.x  a/2 C    C cn.x  a/n:
If Rn.x/ is not identically zero, then there is a smallest coefﬁcient ck (k  n), such
that ck ¤ 0, but cj D 0 for 0  j  k  1. Thus,
Rn.x/ D .x  a/k
ck C ckC1.x  a/ C    C cn.x  a/nk
:
Therefore, limx!a Rn.x/=.x  a/k D ck ¤ 0. However, by property (iii) above
we have Rn.x/=.x  a/k D O

.x  a/nC1k
. Since n C 1  k > 0, this says
Rn.x/=.x  a/k ! 0 as x ! a. This contradiction shows that Rn.x/ must be
identically zero. Therefore, Qn.x/ D Pn.x/ for all x.

It is worthwhile remembering these. The ﬁrst three can be established easily by using
Taylor’s formula with Lagrange remainder; the other three would require much more
effort to verify for general n. In Section 9.6 we will return to the subject of Taylor and
Maclaurin polynomials in relation to Taylor and Maclaurin series. At that time we will
have access to much more powerful machinery to establish such results. The need to
calculate high-order derivatives can make the use of Taylor’s formula difﬁcult for all
but the simplest functions.
The real importance of Theorem 13 is that it enables us to obtain Taylor
polynomials for new functions by combining others already known; as long as the er-
ror term is of higher degree than the order of the polynomial obtained, the polynomial
must be the Taylor polynomial. We illustrate this with a few examples.

Evaluating Limits of Indeterminate Forms

Roundoff Error, Truncation Error, and Computers
In Section 4.7 we introduced the idea of roundoff error, while in Sections 4.9 and
4.10 we discussed the result of approximating a function by its Taylor polynomials.
The resulting error here is known as truncation error. This conventional terminology
may be a bit confusing at ﬁrst because rounding off is itself a kind of truncation of
the digital representation of a number. However in numerical analysis “truncation”
is reserved for discarding higher order terms, typically represented by big-O, often
leaving a Taylor polynomial.
Truncation error is a crucial source of error in using computers to do mathematical
operations. In computation with computers, many of the mathematical functions and
structures being investigated are approximated by polynomials in order to make it pos-
sible for computers to manipulate them. However, the other source of error, roundoff,
is ubiquitous, so it is inevitable that mathematics on computers has to involve consider-
ation of both sources of error. These sources can sometimes be treated independently,
but in other circumstances they can interact with each other in fascinating ways. In this
section we look at some of these fascinating interactions in the form of numerical mon-
sters using Maple. Of course, as stated previously, the issues concern all calculation
on computers and not Maple in particular.
Taylor Polynomials in Maple
In much of the following discussion we will be examining the function sin x. Let us
begin by deﬁning the Maple expression s := sin(x)to denote this function. The
Maple input
>
u := taylor(s, x=0, 5);
produces the Taylor polynomial of degree 4 about x D 0 (i.e., a Maclaurin polynomial)
for sin.x/ together with a big-O term of order x5:
u WD x  1
6 x3 C O.x5/
The presence of the big-O term means that u is an actual representation of sin x; there
is no error involved. If we want to get an actual Taylor polynomial, we need to convert
the expression for u to drop off the big-O term. Since the coefﬁcient of x4 is zero, let
us call the resulting polynomial P3:
>
P3 := convert(u, polynom);
P 3 WD x  1
6 x3
Unlike u, P3 is not an exact representation of sin x; it is only an approximation. The
discarded term O.x5/ D s  P3 D u  P3 is the error in this approximation. On
the basis of the discussion in the previous section, this truncation error can be ex-
pected to be quite small for x close to 0, a fact that is conﬁrmed by the Maple plot
in Figure 4.66(a). The behaviour is much as expected. sin x behaves like the cubic
polynomial near 0 (so the difference is nearly 0), while farther from 0 the cubic term
dominates the expression.

The limiting behaviour near 0 can be explored by changing the plot window. If the
Maple plot instruction is revised to
>
plot(s-P3, x=-0.42e-3..0.42e-3, style=point,
symbol=point, numpoints=1000);
the plot in Figure 4.66(b) results. What is this structure? Clearly the distances from
the x-axis are very small, and one can see the cubic-like behaviour. But why are the
points not distributed along a single curve, ﬁlling out a jagged arrow-like structure
instead? This is another numerical monster connected to roundoff error, as we can see
if we plot sin.x/  P3.x/ together with the functions ˙.=2/ sin.x/ and ˙.=4/ sin x,
where  D 252 is machine epsilon, as calculated in Section 4.7.

the envelope curves y D ˙.=4/ sin x
(black), and y D ˙.=2/ sin x (grey)
like straight lines since the plot window is so close to the origin) link the structure of
the plot to machine epsilon; the seemingly random points are not as random as they
ﬁrst seemed.
Moreover, this structure is distinctive to Maple. Other software packages, such as
Matlab, produce a somewhat different, but still spurious, structure for the same plotting
window. Try some others. If different software produces different behaviour under
the same instructions, it is certain that some type of computational error is involved.
Software-dependent behaviour is one sure sign of computational error.
A distinctive aspect of this monster is that for a large plot window, the trunca-
tion error dominates, while near zero, where the truncation error approaches zero, the
roundoff error dominates. This is a common relationship between truncation error
and roundoff error. However, the roundoff error shows up for plot windows near zero,
while the truncation error is dominant over wide ranges of plot windows. Is this always
true for truncation error? No—as the next monster shows.
Persistent Roundoff Error
The trade-off between truncation error and roundoff error is distinctive, but one should
not get the impression that roundoff error only matters in extreme limiting cases in
certain plot windows. Consider, for example, the function f .x/ D x2  2x C 1  .x 
1/2. It is identically 0, not just 0 in the limiting case x D 0. However, the computer
evaluates the two mathematically equivalent parts of the function f differently, leaving
different errors from rounding off the true values of the numbers inserted into the
expression. The difference of the result is then not exactly 0. A plot of f .x/ on the

It is shown in Figure 4.68(a). The spurious values of f .x/ seem like rungs on a ladder.
Note that these false nonzero values of f .x/ (colour) are not small compared to 1.
This is because the window is so wide. But the error is clearly due to roundoff as
the grey and black envelope curves are proportional to machine epsilon. This plot is
largely independent of the width of the window chosen. Figure 4.68(b) is the same
plot with a window one million times narrower. Except for a change of scale, it is
virtually identical to the plot in Figure 4.68(a). This behaviour is quite different from
the numerical monster involving Taylor polynomials encountered above.
Truncation, Roundoff, and Computer Algebra
One of the more modern developments in computer mathematics is the computer’s
ability to deal with mathematics symbolically. This important capability is known as
“computer algebra.” For example, Maple can generate Taylor expansions of very high
order. This might appear to make the issue of error less important. If one can generate
exact Taylor polynomials of very high order, how could error remain an issue?
K
To see how the ﬁniteness of computers intrudes on our calculations in this case
too, let us consider the Taylor (Maclaurin) polynomial of degree 99 for sin x:
>
v := taylor(s, x=0, 100): P99 := convert(v, polynom):
It is good to suppress the output here; each command produces screensfull of output.
Figure 4.69 shows the result of the Maple plot command
>
plot([P99,s],x=35..39,y=-3..3,colour=[magenta,black],
style=point,symbol=point,numpoints=500,
xtickmarks=[36,37,38,39]);
The black curve is the graph of the sine function, and the colour tornado-like cloud is
the plot of P99.x/ that Maple produces. For plotting, the polynomial must be evaluated
at speciﬁc values of x. The algorithm cannot employ the large rational expressions for
coefﬁcients and high powers of input values. In order to place the result into an actual
pixel on the computer screen, the value of the polynomial must be converted to a
ﬂoating-point number. Then, with the adding and subtracting of 100 terms involving
rounded powers, roundoff error returns despite the exact polynomial that we began
with.

Consider two different but mathematically equivalent
expressions, having the value C after evaluation. On a
computer, with each step in the evaluation of each of the
expressions, roundoff error is introduced as digits are
discarded and rounded according to various rules. In
subsequent steps, resulting error is added or subtracted
according to the details of the expression producing a ﬁnal
error that depends in detail on the expression, the particular
software package, the operating system, and the machine
hardware. Computer errors are not equivalent for the two
expressions, even when the expressions are mathematically
equivalent.
(a) If we suppose that the computer satisfactorily evaluates
the expressions for many input values within an interval,
all to within machine precision, why might we expect the
difference of these expressions on a computer to have an
error contained within an interval ŒC; C?
(b) Is it possible for exceptional values of the error to lie
outside that interval in some cases? Why?
(c) Is it possible for the error to be much smaller than the
interval indicates? Why?

3. (The economics of blood testing) Suppose that it is necessary
to perform a blood test on a large number N of individuals to
detect the presence of a virus. If each test costs $C; then the
total cost of the testing program is $NC: If the proportion of
people in the population who have the virus is not large, this
cost can be greatly reduced by adopting the following strategy.
Divide the N samples of blood into N=x groups of x samples
each. Pool the blood in each group to make a single sample
for that group and test it. If it tests negative, no further testing
is necessary for individuals in that group. If the group sample
tests positive, test all the individuals in that group.
Suppose that the fraction of individuals in the population in-
fected with the virus is p, so the fraction uninfected is q D
1  p. The probability that a given individual is unaffected is
q, so the probability that all x individuals in a group are un-
affected is qx. Therefore, the probability that a pooled sample
is infected is 1  qx. Each group requires one test, and the in-
fected groups require an extra x tests. Therefore, the expected
total number of tests to be performed is
T D N

:
For example, if p D 0:01, so that q D 0:99 and x D 20,
then the expected number of tests required is T D 0:23N, a
reduction of over 75%. But maybe we can do better by making
a different choice for x.
(a) For q D 0:99, ﬁnd the number x of samples in a group
that minimizes T (i.e., solve dT=dx D 0). Show that the
minimizing value of x satisﬁes

(b) Use the technique of ﬁxed-point iteration (see Section 4.2)
to solve the equation in (a) for x. Start with x D 20, say.

where g is the acceleration of gravity.
(a) Assuming that L remains ﬁxed, show that a 1% increase
in g results in approximately a 0.5% decrease in the
period P: (Variations in the period of a pendulum can be
used to detect small variations in g from place to place on
the earth’s surface.)
(b) For ﬁxed g, what percentage change in L will produce a
1% increase in P ?
5. (Torricelli’s Law) The rate at which a tank drains is propor-
tional to the square root of the depth of liquid in the tank above
the level of the drain: if V.t/ is the volume of liquid in the
tank at time t, and y.t/ is the height of the surface of the liquid
above the drain, then dV=dt D kpy, where k is a constant
depending on the size of the drain. For a cylindrical tank with
constant cross-sectional area A with drain at the bottom:
(a) Verify that the depth y.t/ of liquid in the tank at time t
satisﬁes dy=dt D .k=A/py.
(b) Verify that if the depth of liquid in the tank at t D 0 is
y0, then the depth at subsequent times during the draining
process is y D

(c) If the tank drains completely in time T; express the depth
y.t/ at time t in terms of y0 and T:
(d) In terms of T; how long does it take for half the liquid in
the tank to drain out?
6. If a conical tank with top radius R and depth H drains accord-
ing to Torricelli’s Law and empties in time T; show that the

9. (Branching angles for electric wires and pipes)
(a) The resistance offered by a wire to the ﬂow of electric cur-
rent through it is proportional to its length and inversely
proportional to its cross-sectional area. Thus, the resis-
tance R of a wire of length L and radius r is R D kL=r2,
where k is a positive constant. A long straight wire of
length L and radius r1 extends from A to B: A second
straight wire of smaller radius r2 is to be connected be-
tween a point P on AB and a point C at distance h from
B such that CB is perpendicular to AB: (See Figure 4.72.)

(The range of a spurt) A cylindrical water tank sitting on a
horizontal table has a small hole located on its vertical wall at
height h above the bottom of the tank. Water escapes from the
tank horizontally through the hole and then curves down under
the inﬂuence of gravity to strike the table at a distance R from
the base of the tank, as shown in Figure 4.73. (We ignore air
resistance.) Torricelli’s Law implies that the speed v at which
water escapes through the hole is proportional to the square
root of the depth of the hole below the surface of the water:
if the depth of water in the tank at time t is y.t/ > h, then

“
There are in this world optimists who feel that any symbol that starts
off with an integral sign must necessarily denote something that will
have every property that they should like an integral to possess. This
of course is quite annoying to us rigorous mathematicians; what is
even more annoying is that by doing so they often come up with the
right answer.

Introduction
The second fundamental problem addressed by calculus
is the problem of areas, that is, the problem of determin-
ing the area of a region of the plane bounded by various curves. Like the problem
of tangents considered in Chapter 2, many practical problems in various disciplines
require the evaluation of areas for their solution, and the solution of the problem of
areas necessarily involves the notion of limits. On the surface the problem of areas ap-
pears unrelated to the problem of tangents. However, we will see that the two problems
are very closely related; one is the inverse of the other. Finding an area is equivalent
to ﬁnding an antiderivative or, as we prefer to say, ﬁnding an integral. The relation-
ship between areas and antiderivatives is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
When we have proved it, we will be able to ﬁnd areas at will, provided only that we
can integrate (i.e., antidifferentiate) the various functions we encounter.
We would like to have at our disposal a set of integration rules similar to the differ-
entiation rules developed in Chapter 2. We can ﬁnd the derivative of any differentiable
function using those differentiation rules. Unfortunately, integration is generally more
difﬁcult; indeed, some fairly simple functions are not themselves derivatives of simple
functions. For example, ex2 is not the derivative of any ﬁnite combination of elemen-
tary functions. Nevertheless, we will expend some effort in Section 5.6 and Sections
6.1–6.4 to develop techniques for integrating as many functions as possible. Later, in
Chapter 6, we will examine how to approximate areas bounded by graphs of functions
that we cannot antidifferentiate.
5.1
Sums and Sigma Notation
When we begin calculating areas in the next section, we will often encounter sums
of values of functions. We need to have a convenient notation for representing sums
of arbitrary (possibly large) numbers of terms, and we need to develop techniques for
evaluating some such sums.
We use the symbol P to represent a sum; it is an enlarged Greek capital letter S
called sigma.

DEFINITION
1
Sigma notation
If m and n are integers with m  n, and if f is a function deﬁned at the
integers m, m C 1, m C 2, : : : ; n, the symbol Pn
iDm f .i/ represents the sum
of the values of f at those integers:
n
X
iDm
f .i/ D f .m/ C f .m C 1/ C f .m C 2/ C    C f .n/:
The explicit sum appearing on the right side of this equation is the expansion
of the sum represented in sigma notation on the left side.
EXAMPLE 1

X
iD1
i2 D 12 C 22 C 32 C 42 C 52 D 55:
The i that appears in the symbol Pn
iDm f .i/ is called an index of summation. To
evaluate Pn
iDm f .i/, replace the index i with the integers m, m C 1, : : : , n, succes-
sively, and sum the results. Observe that the value of the sum does not depend on what
we call the index; the index does not appear on the right side of the deﬁnition. If we
use another letter in place of i in the sum in Example 1, we still get the same value for
the sum:
5
X
kD1
k2 D 12 C 22 C 32 C 42 C 52 D 55:
The index of summation is a dummy variable used to represent an arbitrary point where
the function is evaluated to produce a term to be included in the sum. On the other
hand, the sum Pn
iDm f .i/ does depend on the two numbers m and n, called the limits
of summation; m is the lower limit, and n is the upper limit.

In particular, an inﬁnite series is such a sum with inﬁnitely many terms:

When no ﬁnal term follows the   , it is understood that the terms go on forever. We
will study inﬁnite series in Chapter 9.
When adding ﬁnitely many numbers, the order in which they are added is unim-
portant; any order will give the same sum. If all the numbers have a common factor,
then that factor can be removed from each term and multiplied after the sum is eval-
uated: ca C cb D c.a C b/. These laws of arithmetic translate into the following
linearity rule for ﬁnite sums; if A and B are constants, then

This equality can also be derived by substituting i C m for j everywhere j appears on

i D n. It is often convenient to make such a change of index in a summation.

It is not usually this easy to evaluate a general sum in closed form. We can only
simplify Pn

need in the next sections are collected in Theorem 1.

Areas as Limits of Sums
We began the study of derivatives in Chapter 2 by deﬁning what is meant by a tangent
line to a curve at a particular point. We would like to begin the study of integrals by
deﬁning what is meant by the area of a plane region, but a deﬁnition of area is much
more difﬁcult to give than a deﬁnition of tangency. Let us assume (as we did, for
example, in Section 3.3) that we know intuitively what area means and list some of its
properties. (See Figure 5.3.)
(i) The area of a plane region is a nonnegative real number of square units.
(ii) The area of a rectangle with width w and height h is A D wh.

SECTION 5.2:
Areas as Limits of Sums
297
(iii) The areas of congruent plane regions are equal.
(iv) If region S is contained in region R, then the area of S is less than or equal to that
of R.
(v) If region R is a union of (ﬁnitely many) nonoverlapping regions, then the area of
R is the sum of the areas of those regions.
Using these ﬁve properties we can calculate the area of any polygon (a region bounded
by straight line segments). First, we note that properties (iii) and (v) show that the
area of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle having the same base width
and height. Any triangle can be butted against a congruent copy of itself to form a
parallelogram, so a triangle has area half the base width times the height. Finally, any
polygon can be subdivided into ﬁnitely many nonoverlapping triangles so its area is the
sum of the areas of those triangles.
We can’t go beyond polygons without taking limits. If a region has a curved
boundary, its area can only be approximated by using rectangles or triangles; calcu-
lating the exact area requires the evaluation of a limit. We showed how this could be
done for a circle in Section 1.1.

The Basic Area Problem
In this section we are going to consider how to ﬁnd the area of a region R lying under

and between the vertical lines x D a and x D b, where a < b. (See Figure 5.4.) To

CHAPTER 5
Integration
The rectangles are shown shaded in Figure 5.5 for a decreasing function f: For an
increasing function, the tops of the rectangles would lie above the graph of f rather
than below it. Evidently, Sn is an approximation to the area of the region R, and
the approximation gets better as n increases, provided we choose the points a D x0 <
x1 <    < xn D b in such a way that the width xi of the widest rectangle approaches
zero.

Observe in Figure 5.6, for example, that subdividing a subinterval into two smaller
subintervals reduces the error in the approximation by reducing that part of the area
under the curve that is not contained in the rectangles. It is reasonable, therefore, to
calculate the area of R by ﬁnding the limit of Sn as n ! 1 with the restriction that
the largest of the subinterval widths xi must approach zero:

Some Area Calculations
We devote the rest of this section to some examples in which we apply the technique
described above for ﬁnding areas under graphs of functions by approximating with
rectangles. Let us begin with a region for which we already know the area so we can
satisfy ourselves that the method does give the correct value.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the area A of the region lying under the straight line y D
x C 1, above the x-axis, and between the lines x D 0 and x D 2.
Solution
The region is shaded in Figure 5.7(a). It is a trapezoid (a four-sided polygon
with one pair of parallel sides) and has area 4 square units. (It can be divided into a
rectangle and a triangle, each of area 2 square units.) We will calculate the area as a
limit of sums of areas of rectangles constructed as described above. Divide the interval
Œ0; 2 into n subintervals of equal length by points

Solution
The area A of the region is the limit of the sum Sn of areas of the rectangles
shown in Figure 5.7(b). Again we have used equal subintervals, each of length b=n.
The height of the ith rectangle is .ib=n/2. Thus,

Finding an area under the graph of y D xk over an interval I becomes more and more
difﬁcult as k increases if we continue to try to subdivide I into subintervals of equal
length. (See Exercise 14 at the end of this section for the case k D 3.) It is, however,
possible to ﬁnd the area for arbitrary k if we subdivide the interval I into subintervals
whose lengths increase in geometric progression. Example 3 illustrates this.

5.3
The Deﬁnite Integral
In this section we generalize and make more precise the procedure used for ﬁnding
areas developed in Section 5.2, and we use it to deﬁne the deﬁnite integral of a func-
tion f on an interval I: Let us assume, for the time being, that f .x/ is deﬁned and
continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b. We no longer assume that the values of
f are nonnegative.
Partitions and Riemann Sums
Let P be a ﬁnite set of points arranged in order between a and b on the real line, say
P D fx0; x1; x2; x3; : : : ; xn1; xng;
where a D x0 < x1 < x2 < x3 <    < xn1 < xn D b. Such a set P is called a
partition of Œa; b; it divides Œa; b into n subintervals of which the ith is Œxi1; xi. We
call these the subintervals of the partition P . The number n depends on the particular
partition, so we write n D n.P /. The length of the ith subinterval of P is
xi D xi  xi1;
(for 1  i  n),
and we call the greatest of these numbers xi the norm of the partition P and denote
it kP k:
kP k D max
1in xi:
Since f is continuous on each subinterval Œxi1; xi of P; it takes on maximum and
minimum values at points of that interval (by Theorem 8 of Section 1.4). Thus, there
are numbers li and ui in Œxi1; xi such that
f .li/  f .x/  f .ui/
whenever xi1  x  xi:
If f .x/  0 on Œa; b, then f .li/ xi and f .ui/ xi represent the areas of rectangles
having the interval Œxi1; xi on the x-axis as base, and having tops passing through
the lowest and highest points, respectively, on the graph of f on that interval. (See
Figure 5.10.) If Ai is that part of the area under y D f .x/ and above the x-axis that
lies in the vertical strip between x D xi1 and x D xi, then
x
xi1
ui

Figure 5.10

If f can have negative values, then one or both of f .li/ xi and f .ui/ xi can be
negative and will then represent the negative of the area of a rectangle lying below the
x-axis. In any event, we always have f .li/ xi  f .ui/ xi.
DEFINITION

Upper and lower Riemann sums
The lower (Riemann) sum, L.f; P /, and the upper (Riemann) sum, U.f; P /,
for the function f and the partition P are deﬁned by:

Calculate lower and upper Riemann sums for the function

Solution
The partition P consists of the points x0 D 1, x1 D 5=4, x2 D 3=2,
x3 D 7=4, and x4 D 2. Since 1=x is decreasing on Œ1; 2, its minimum and maximum
values on the ith subinterval Œxi1; xi are 1=xi and 1=xi1, respectively. Thus, the

Each subinterval of Pn has length x D a=n, and the division points are
given by xi D ia=n for i D 0, 1, 2, : : : , n. Since x2 is increasing on Œ0; a, its
minimum and maximum values over the ith subinterval Œxi1; xi occur at li D xi1

The Deﬁnite Integral
If we calculate L.f; P / and U.f; P / for partitions P having more and more points
spaced closer and closer together, we expect that, in the limit, these Riemann sums
will converge to a common value that will be the area bounded by y D f .x/, y D 0,
x D a, and x D b if f .x/  0 on Œa; b. This is indeed the case, but we cannot fully
prove it yet.

CHAPTER 5
Integration
If P1 and P2 are two partitions of Œa; b such that every point of P1 also belongs
to P2, then we say that P2 is a reﬁnement of P1. It is not difﬁcult to show that in this
case
L.f; P1/  L.f; P2/  U.f; P2/  U.f; P1/I
adding more points to a partition increases the lower sum and decreases the upper sum.
(See Exercise 18 at the end of this section.) Given any two partitions, P1 and P2, we
can form their common reﬁnement P; which consists of all of the points of P1 and
P2. Thus,
L.f; P1/  L.f; P /  U.f; P /  U.f; P2/:
Hence, every lower sum is less than or equal to every upper sum. Since the real num-
bers are complete, there must exist at least one real number I such that
L.f; P /  I  U.f; P /
for every partition P:
If there is only one such number, we will call it the deﬁnite integral of f on Œa; b.
DEFINITION
3
The deﬁnite integral
Suppose there is exactly one number I such that for every partition P of Œa; b
we have
L.f; P /  I  U.f; P /:
Then we say that the function f is integrable on Œa; b, and we call I the
deﬁnite integral of f on Œa; b. The deﬁnite integral is denoted by the symbol
I D
Z b
a
f .x/ dx:
The deﬁnite integral of f .x/ over Œa; b is a number; it is not a function of x. It
depends on the numbers a and b and on the particular function f , but not on the
variable x (which is a dummy variable like the variable i in the sum Pn
iD1 f .i/).
Replacing x with another variable does not change the value of the integral:
Z b
a
f .x/ dx D
Z b
a
f .t/ dt:
While we normally write the
deﬁnite integral of f .x/ as
Z b
a
f .x/ dx;
it is equally correct to write it as
Z b
a
dx f .x/:
This latter form will become
quite useful when we deal with
multiple integrals in Chapter 14.
The various parts of the symbol
Z b
a
f .x/ dx have their own names:
(i)
R
is called the integral sign; it resembles the letter S since it represents the limit
of a sum.
(ii) a and b are called the limits of integration; a is the lower limit, b is the upper
limit.
(iii) The function f is the integrand; x is the variable of integration.
(iv) dx is the differential of x. It replaces x in the Riemann sums. If an integrand
depends on more than one variable, the differential tells you which one is the
variable of integration.

Therefore, if f is integrable on Œa; b, then its integral is the limit of such Riemann
sums, where the limit is taken as the number n.P / of subintervals of P increases to
inﬁnity in such a way that the lengths of all the subintervals approach zero. That is,
lim

As we will see in Chapter 7, many applications of integration depend on recognizing
that a limit of Riemann sums is a deﬁnite integral.

If f is continuous on Œa; b, then f is integrable on Œa; b.
Remark
The assumption that f is continuous in Theorem 2 may seem a bit super-
ﬂuous since continuity was required throughout the above discussion leading to the
deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral. We cannot, however, prove this theorem yet. Its
proof makes subtle use of the completeness property of the real numbers and is given
in Appendix IV in the context of an extended deﬁnition of deﬁnite integral that is
meaningful for a larger class of functions that are not necessarily continuous. (The
integral studied in Appendix IV is called the Riemann integral.)
We can, however, make the following observation. In order to prove that f is
integrable on Œa; b, it is sufﬁcient that, for any given positive number , we should be
able to ﬁnd a partition P of Œa; b for which U.f; P /  L.f; P / < . This condition
prevents there being more than one number I that is both greater than every lower
sum and less than every upper sum. It is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd such a partition if the
function f is nondecreasing (or if it is nonincreasing) on Œa; b. (See Exercise 17
at the end of this section.) Therefore, nondecreasing and nonincreasing continuous
functions are integrable; so, therefore, is any continuous function that is the sum of
a nondecreasing and a nonincreasing function. This class of functions includes any
continuous functions we are likely to encounter in concrete applications of calculus
but, unfortunately, does not include all continuous functions.
Meanwhile, in Sections 5.4 and 6.5 we will extend the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite
integral to certain kinds of functions that are not continuous, or where the interval of
integration is not closed or not bounded.

Solution
We want to interpret the sum as a Riemann sum for f .x/ D .1 C x/1=3.
The factor 2=n suggests that the interval of integration has length 2 and is partitioned

Properties of the Deﬁnite Integral
It is convenient to extend the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral
R b
a f .x/ dx to allow
a D b and a > b as well as a < b. The extension still involves partitions P having
x0 D a and xn D b with intermediate points occurring in order between these end
points, so that if a D b, then we must have xi D 0 for every i, and hence the integral
is zero. If a > b, we have xi < 0 for each i, so the integral will be negative for
positive functions f and vice versa.

The proofs of parts (a) and (b) are suggested in the ﬁrst paragraph of this section.

reasonable if you regard the integrals as representing (signed) areas. For instance,
properties (d) and (e) are, respectively, properties (v) and (iv) of areas mentioned in
the ﬁrst paragraph of Section 5.2. (See Figure 5.14.)

A Mean-Value Theorem for Integrals
Let f be a function continuous on the interval Œa; b. Then f assumes a minimum
value m and a maximum value M on the interval, say at points x D l and x D u,
respectively:
m D f .l/  f .x/  f .u/ D M
for all x in Œa; b:
For the 2-point partition P of Œa; b having x0 D a and x1 D b, we have

Therefore,

By the Intermediate-Value Theorem, f .x/ must take on every value between the two

number c between l and u such that

Deﬁnite Integrals of Piecewise Continuous Functions
The deﬁnition of integrability and the deﬁnite integral given above can be extended to
a wider class than just continuous functions. One simple but very important extension
is to the class of piecewise continuous functions.
Consider the graph y D f .x/ shown in Figure 5.21(a). Although f is not con-
tinuous at all points in Œa; b (it is discontinuous at c1 and c2), clearly the region lying
under the graph and above the x-axis between x D a and x D b does have an area.
We would like to represent this area as
Z c1
a
f .x/ dx C
Z c2
c1
f .x/ dx C
Z b

f .x/ dx:
This is reasonable because there are continuous functions on Œa; c1, Œc1; c2, and Œc2; b
equal to f .x/ on the corresponding open intervals, .a; c1/, .c1; c2/, and .c2; b/.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
In this section we demonstrate the relationship between the deﬁnite integral deﬁned in
Section 5.3 and the indeﬁnite integral (or general antiderivative) introduced in
Section 2.10. A consequence of this relationship is that we will be able to calculate
deﬁnite integrals of functions whose antiderivatives we can ﬁnd.
In Section 3.3 we wanted to ﬁnd a function whose derivative was 1=x. We solved
this problem by deﬁning the desired function .ln x/ in terms of the area under the graph
of y D 1=x. This idea motivates, and is a special case of, the following theorem.

Remark
You should remember both conclusions of the Fundamental Theorem; they
are both useful. Part I concerns the derivative of an integral; it tells you how to differ-
entiate a deﬁnite integral with respect to its upper limit. Part II concerns the integral
of a derivative; it tells you how to evaluate a deﬁnite integral if you can ﬁnd an anti-
derivative of the integrand.

Note that while the deﬁnite integral is a pure number, an area is a geometric quantity
that implicitly involves units. If the units along the x- and y-axes are, for example,
metres, the area should be quoted in square metres (m2). If units of length along the
x-axis and y-axis are not speciﬁed, areas should be quoted in square units.

EXAMPLE 4
Find the area of the region R lying above the line y D 1 and below
the curve y D 5=.x2 C 1/.
Solution
The region R is shaded in Figure 5.24. To ﬁnd the intersections of y D 1
and y D 5=.x2 C 1/, we must solve these equations simultaneously:
1 D

x2 C 1;
so x2 C 1 D 5, x2 D 4, and x D ˙2.
The area A of the region R is the area under the curve y D 5=.x2 C 1/ and above
the x-axis between x D 2 and x D 2, minus the area of a rectangle of width 4 and
height 1. Since tan1x is an antiderivative of 1=.x2 C 1/,

Differentiate the integral equation to get f 0.x/ D 3f .x/, the DE for ex-

equation to get f .4/ D 2. Hence 2 D Ce12, so C D 2e12. Therefore, the integral
equation has solution f .x/ D 2e3x12.
We conclude with an example showing how the Fundamental Theorem can be used to
evaluate limits of Riemann sums.

The Method of Substitution
As we have seen, the evaluation of deﬁnite integrals is most easily carried out if we
can antidifferentiate the integrand. In this section and Sections 6.1–6.4 we develop
some techniques of integration, that is, methods for ﬁnding antiderivatives of functions.
Although the techniques we develop can be used for a large class of functions, they will
not work for all functions we might want to integrate. If a deﬁnite integral involves an
integrand whose antiderivative is either impossible or very difﬁcult to ﬁnd, we may
wish, instead, to approximate the deﬁnite integral by numerical means. Techniques for
doing that will be presented in Sections 6.6–6.8.
Let us begin by assembling a table of some known indeﬁnite integrals. These
results have all emerged during our development of differentiation formulas for ele-
mentary functions. You should memorize them.

The Method of Substitution

When an integral cannot be evaluated by inspection, as those in Examples 1–2 can,
we require one or more special techniques. The most important of these techniques is
the method of substitution, the integral version of the Chain Rule. If we rewrite the
Chain Rule,

Observe that the following formalism would produce this latter formula even if we did
not already know it was true:
Let u D g.x/. Then du=dx D g0.x/, or in differential form, du D g0.x/ dx. Thus,

The method of substitution cannot be forced to work. There is no substitution that
will do much good with the integral
R
x.2 C x7/1=5 dx, for instance. However, the
integral
R
x6.2Cx7/1=5 dx will yield to the substitution u D 2Cx7. The substitution
u D g.x/ is more likely to work if g0.x/ is a factor of the integrand.
The following theorem simpliﬁes the use of the method of substitution in deﬁnite
integrals.

because this would imply that u, rather than x, goes from 0 to 8. Method I gives the
shorter solution and is therefore preferable. However, in cases where the transformed

csc u du D 0:
Although x csc.x2/ is an odd function, it is not continuous at 0, and it happens that
the given integral represents the difference of inﬁnite areas. If we assume that f is
continuous on an interval containing A and B; then it sufﬁces to know that u D g.x/
is one-to-one as well as differentiable. In this case the range of g will lie between A
and B; so the condition of Theorem 6 will be satisﬁed.
Trigonometric Integrals
The method of substitution is often useful for evaluating trigonometric integrals. We
begin by listing the integrals of the four trigonometric functions whose integrals we
have not yet seen. They arise often in applications and should be memorized.
Integrals of tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant

CHAPTER 5
Integration
All of these can, of course, be checked by differentiating the right-hand sides. The ﬁrst
two can be evaluated directly by rewriting tan x or cot x in terms of sin x and cos x and
using an appropriate substitution. For example,

The integral of sec x can be evaluated by rewriting it in the form
Z
sec x dx D
Z sec x.sec x C tan x/
sec x C tan x
dx
and using the substitution u D sec x C tan x. The integral of csc x can be evaluated
similarly. (Show that the two versions given for that integral are equivalent!)
We now consider integrals of the form
Z
sinm x cosn x dx:
If either m or n is an odd, positive integer, the integral can be done easily by sub-
stitution. If, say, n D 2k C 1 where k is an integer, then we can use the identity
sin2 x C cos2 x D 1 to rewrite the integral in the form
Z
sinm x .1  sin2 x/k cos x dx;
which can be integrated using the substitution u D sin x. Similarly, u D cos x can be
used if m is an odd integer.

Using the identities sec2 x D 1 C tan2 x and csc2 x D 1 C cot2 x and one of the
substitutions u D sec x, u D tan x, u D csc x, or u D cot x, we can evaluate integrals
of the form

or

unless m is odd and n is even. (If this is the case, these integrals can be handled by
integration by parts; see Section 6.1.)

EXERCISES 5.6
Evaluate the integrals in Exercises 1–44. Remember to include a
constant of integration with the indeﬁnite integrals. Your answers
may appear different from those in the Answers section but may
still be correct. For example, evaluating I D

using the substitution u D sin x leads to I D 1

u D cos x leads to I D  1

You can always check your own answer to an indeﬁnite
integral by differentiating it to get back to the integrand. This is
often easier than comparing your answer with the answer in the
back of the book. You may ﬁnd integrals that you can’t do, but you
should not make mistakes in those you can do because the answer
is so easily checked. (This is a good thing to remember during
tests and exams.)

Areas of Plane Regions
In this section we review and extend the use of deﬁnite integrals to represent plane
areas. Recall that the integral
R b
a f .x/ dx measures the area between the graph of f
and the x-axis from x D a to x D b, but treats as negative any part of this area that
lies below the x-axis. (We are assuming that a < b.) In order to express the total area
bounded by y D f .x/, y D 0, x D a, and x D b, counting all of the area positively,
we should integrate the absolute value of f (see Figure 5.27):

Areas Between Two Curves
Suppose that a plane region R is bounded by the graphs of two continuous functions,
y D f .x/ and y D g.x/, and the vertical straight lines x D a and x D b, as shown in
Figure 5.29(a). Assume that a < b and that f .x/  g.x/ on Œa; b, so the graph of f
lies below that of g. If f .x/  0 on Œa; b, then the area A of R is the area above the
x-axis and under the graph of g minus the area above the x-axis and under the graph

It is useful to regard this formula as expressing A as the “sum” (i.e., the integral) of
inﬁnitely many area elements
dA D .g.x/  f .x// dx;
corresponding to values of x between a and b. Each such area element is the area
of an inﬁnitely thin vertical rectangle of width dx and height g.x/  f .x/ located at
position x (see Figure 5.29(b)). Even if f and g can take on negative values on Œa; b,
this interpretation and the resulting area formula

remain valid, provided that f .x/  g.x/ on Œa; b so that all the area elements dA have
positive area. Using integrals to represent a quantity as a sum of differential elements
(i.e., a sum of little bits of the quantity) is a very helpful approach. We will do this
often in Chapter 7. Of course, what we are really doing is identifying the integral as a
limit of a suitable Riemann sum.
More generally, if the restriction f .x/  g.x/ is removed, then the vertical rect-
angle of width dx at position x extending between the graphs of f and g has height
jf .x/  g.x/j and hence area
dA D jf .x/  g.x/j dx:
(See Figure 5.30.) Hence, the total area lying between the graphs y D f .x/ and
y D g.x/ and between the vertical lines x D a and x D b > a is given by

intervals.

Find the area of the bounded, plane region R lying between the

It is sometimes more convenient to use horizontal area elements instead of vertical
ones and integrate over an interval of the y-axis instead of the x-axis. This is usually
the case if the region whose area we want to ﬁnd is bounded by curves whose equations
are written in terms of functions of y. In Figure 5.33(a), the region R lying to the right
of x D f .y/ and to the left of x D g.y/, and between the horizontal lines y D c and

Introduction
This chapter is completely concerned with how to evalu-
ate integrals. The ﬁrst four sections continue our search,
begun in Section 5.6, for ways to ﬁnd antiderivatives and, therefore, deﬁnite integrals
by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Section 6.5 deals with the problem of ﬁnd-
ing deﬁnite integrals of functions over inﬁnite intervals, or over intervals where the
functions are not bounded. The remaining three sections deal with techniques of nu-
merical integration that can be used to ﬁnd approximate values of deﬁnite integrals
when an antiderivative cannot be found.
It is not necessary to cover the material of this chapter before proceeding to the
various applications of integration discussed in Chapter 7, but some of the examples
and exercises in that chapter do depend on techniques presented here.
6.1
Integration by Parts
Our next general method for antidifferentiation is called integration by parts. Just
as the method of substitution can be regarded as inverse to the Chain Rule for dif-
ferentiation, so the method for integration by parts is inverse to the Product Rule for
differentiation.
Suppose that U.x/ and V.x/ are two differentiable functions. According to the
Product Rule,
d
dx

U.x/V.x/

D U.x/ dV
dx C V.x/ dU
dx :
Integrating both sides of this equation and transposing terms, we obtain
Z
U.x/ dV
dx dx D U.x/V.x/ 
Z
V.x/ dU
dx dx
or, more simply,

SECTION 6.1:
Integration by Parts
335
Z
U dV D U V 
Z
V dU:
The above formula serves as a pattern for carrying out integration by parts, as we will
see in the examples below. In each application of the method, we break up the given
integrand into a product of two pieces, U and V 0, where V 0 is readily integrated and
where
R
V U 0 dx is usually (but not always) a simpler integral than
R
U V 0 dx. The
technique is called integration by parts because it replaces one integral with the sum
of an integrated term and another integral that remains to be evaluated. That is, it
accomplishes only part of the original integration.
EXAMPLE 1
Z

Let
U D x,
dV D ex dx.
Then dU D dx,
V D ex.
D xex 
Z
ex dx
(i.e., U V 
R
V dU )
D xex  ex C C:
Note the form in which the integration by parts is carried out. We indicate at the side
what choices we are making for U and dV and then calculate dU and V from these.
However, we do not actually substitute U and V into the integral; instead, we use the
formula
R
U dV D U V 
R
V dU as a pattern or mnemonic device to replace the
given integral by the equivalent partially integrated form on the second line.
Note also that had we included a constant of integration with V; for example,
V D ex C K, that constant would cancel out in the next step:
Z
xex dx D x.ex C K/ 
Z
.ex C K/ dx
D xex C Kx  ex  Kx C C D xex  ex C C:
In general, do not include a constant of integration with V or on the right-hand side
until the last integral has been evaluated.
Study the various parts of the following example carefully; they show the various
ways in which integration by parts is used, and they give some insights into what
choices should be made for U and dV in various situations. An improper choice can
result in making an integral more difﬁcult rather than easier. Look for a factor of the
integrand that is easily integrated, and include dx with that factor to make up dV:
Then U is the remaining factor of the integrand. Sometimes it is necessary to take
dV D dx only. When breaking up an integrand using integration by parts, choose U
and dV so that, if possible, V dU is “simpler” (easier to integrate) than U dV:

The following are two useful rules of thumb for choosing U and dV :
(i) If the integrand involves a polynomial multiplied by an exponential, a sine or a
cosine, or some other readily integrable function, try U equals the polynomial
and dV equals the rest.
(ii) If the integrand involves a logarithm, an inverse trigonometric function, or some
other function that is not readily integrable but whose derivative is readily calcu-
lated, try that function for U and let dV equal the rest.
(Of course, these “rules” come with no guarantee. They may fail to be helpful if
“the rest” is not of a suitable form. There remain many functions that cannot be anti-
differentiated by any standard techniques; e.g., ex2.)
The following two examples illustrate a frequently occurring and very useful phe-
nomenon. It may happen after one or two integrations by parts, with the possible
application of some known identity, that the original integral reappears on the right-
hand side. Unless its coefﬁcient there is 1, we have an equation that can be solved for
that integral.

C C:
Observe that after the ﬁrst integration by parts we had an integral that was different
from, but no simpler than, the original integral. At this point we might have become
discouraged and given up on this method. However, perseverance proved worthwhile;
a second integration by parts returned the original integral I in an equation that could
be solved for I: Having chosen to let U be the exponential in the ﬁrst integration by
parts (we could have let it be the cosine), we made the same choice for U in the second
integration by parts. Had we switched horses in midstream and decided to let U be the
trigonometric function the second time, we would have obtained
I D 1
b eax sin bx  1
b eax sin bx C I;
that is, we would have undone what we accomplished in the ﬁrst step.
If we want to evaluate a deﬁnite integral by the method of integration by parts, we

Reduction Formulas
Consider the problem of ﬁnding
R
x4 ex dx. We can, as in Example 1, proceed by
using integration by parts four times. Each time will reduce the power of x by 1. Since
this is repetitive and tedious, we prefer the following approach. For n  0, let
In D

We want to ﬁnd I4. If we integrate by parts, we obtain a formula for In in terms of

Integrals of Rational Functions
In this section we are concerned with integrals of the form
Z P.x/
Q.x/ dx;
where P and Q are polynomials. Recall that a polynomial is a function P of the form
P.x/ D anxn C an1xn1 C    C a2x2 C a1x C a0;
where n is a nonnegative integer, a0; a1; a2; : : : ; an are constants, and an ¤ 0. We
call n the degree of P: A quotient P.x/=Q.x/ of two polynomials is called a rational
function. (See Section P.6 for more discussion of polynomials and rational functions.)
We need normally concern ourselves only with rational functions P.x/=Q.x/ where
the degree of P is less than that of Q. If the degree of P equals or exceeds the degree
of Q, then we can use division to express the fraction P.x/=Q.x/ as a polynomial
plus another fraction R.x/=Q.x/, where R, the remainder in the division, has degree
less than that of Q.

The numerator has degree 3 and the denominator has degree 2, so we need

The basic problem
Evaluate
Z P.x/
Q.x/ dx, where the degree of P < the degree of Q.
The complexity of this problem depends on the degree of Q.
Linear and Quadratic Denominators
Suppose that Q.x/ has degree 1. Thus, Q.x/ D ax C b, where a ¤ 0. Then P.x/
must have degree 0 and be a constant c. We have P.x/=Q.x/ D c=.ax C b/. The

Now suppose that Q.x/ is quadratic, that is, has degree 2. For purposes of this discus-
sion we can assume that Q.x/ is either of the form x2 C a2 or of the form x2  a2,
since completing the square and making the appropriate change of variable can always
reduce a quadratic denominator to this form, as shown in Section 6.2. Since P.x/ can
be at most a linear function, P.x/ D Ax C B, we are led to consider the following
four integrals:
Z
x dx
x2 C a2 ;
Z
x dx
x2  a2 ;
Z

x2 C a2 ;
and
Z
dx
x2  a2 :
(If a D 0, there are only two integrals; each is easily evaluated.) The ﬁrst two integrals
yield to the substitution u D x2 ˙a2; the third is a known integral. The fourth integral
will be evaluated by a different method below. The values of all four integrals are given
in the following box:

.x  a/.x C a/ D
A
x  a C
B
x C a D Ax C Aa C Bx  Ba
x2  a2
;
where we have added the two fractions together again in the last step. If this equation is
to hold identically for all x (except x D ˙a), then the numerators on the left and right
sides must be identical as polynomials in x. The equation .A C B/x C .Aa  Ba/ D
1 D 0x C 1 can hold for all x only if
A C B D 0
(the coefﬁcient of x),
Aa  Ba D 1
(the constant term).
Solving this pair of linear equations for the unknowns A and B, we get A D 1=.2a/

Partial Fractions
The technique used above, involving the writing of a complicated fraction as a sum of
simpler fractions, is called the method of partial fractions. Suppose that a polynomial
Q.x/ is of degree n and that its highest degree term is xn (with coefﬁcient 1). Suppose
also that Q factors into a product of n distinct linear (degree 1) factors, say,
Q.x/ D .x  a1/.x  a2/    .x  an/;
where ai ¤ aj if i ¤ j , 1  i, j  n. If P.x/ is a polynomial of degree smaller than
n, then P.x/=Q.x/ has a partial fraction decomposition of the form
P.x/
Q.x/ D
A1
x  a1
C
A2
x  a2
C    C
An
x  an
for certain values of the constants A1; A2; : : : ; An. We do not attempt to give any
formal proof of this assertion here; such a proof belongs in an algebra course. (See
Theorem 1 below for the statement of a more general result.)
Given that P.x/=Q.x/ has a partial fraction decomposition as claimed above,
there are two methods for determining the constants A1; A2; : : : ; An. The ﬁrst of
these methods, and one that generalizes most easily to the more complicated decom-
positions considered below, is to add up the fractions in the decomposition, obtaining
a new fraction S.x/=Q.x/ with numerator S.x/, a polynomial of degree one less than
that of Q.x/. This new fraction will be identical to the original fraction P.x/=Q.x/ if
S and P are identical polynomials. The constants A1; A2; : : : ; An are determined by
solving the n linear equations resulting from equating the coefﬁcients of like powers
of x in the two polynomials S and P:
The second method depends on the following observation: if we multiply the
partial fraction decomposition by x  aj , we get
.x  aj / P.x/

cancelling the factor x  aj from the denominator of P.x/=Q.x/ and evaluating the
resulting expression at x D aj .

Next, we consider a rational function whose denominator has a quadratic factor that is
equivalent to a sum of squares and cannot, therefore, be further factored into a product
of real linear factors.

EXAMPLE 5
Evaluate
Z 2 C 3x C x2
x.x2 C 1/ dx.
Solution
Note that the numerator has degree 2 and the denominator degree 3, so no
division is necessary. If we decompose the integrand as a sum of two simpler fractions,
we want one with denominator x and one with denominator x2 C 1. The appropriate
form of the decomposition turns out to be
2 C 3x C x2
x.x2 C 1/
D A
x C Bx C C
x2 C 1 D A.x2 C 1/ C Bx2 C Cx
x.x2 C 1/
:
Note that corresponding to the quadratic (degree 2) denominator we use a linear (de-
gree 1) numerator. Equating coefﬁcients in the two numerators, we obtain
A
C
B
D
1
(coefﬁcient of x2)

Hence A D 2, B D 1, and C D 3. We have, therefore,

We remark that addition of the fractions is the only reasonable real-variable method
for determining the constants A, B, and C here. We could determine A by Method II
of Example 3, but there is no simple equivalent way of ﬁnding B or C without using
complex numbers.
Completing the Square
Quadratic expressions of the form Ax2CBx CC are often found in integrands. These
can be written as sums or differences of squares using the procedure of completing
the square, as was done to ﬁnd the formula for the roots of quadratic equations in
Section P.6. First factor out A so that the remaining expression begins with x2 C 2bx,
where 2b D B=A. These are the ﬁrst two terms of .x C b/2 D x2 C 2bx C b2. Add
the third term b2 D B2=4A2 and then subtract it again:

Denominators with Repeated Factors
We require one ﬁnal reﬁnement of the method of partial fractions. If any of the lin-
ear or quadratic factors of Q.x/ is repeated (say, m times), then the partial fraction
decomposition of P.x/=Q.x/ requires m distinct fractions corresponding to that fac-
tor. The denominators of these fractions have exponents increasing from 1 to m, and
the numerators are all constants where the repeated factor is linear or linear where the
repeated factor is quadratic. (See Theorem 1 below.)

Partial fraction decompositions of rational functions
Let P and Q be polynomials with real coefﬁcients, and suppose that the degree of P
is less than the degree of Q. Then
(a) Q.x/ can be factored into the product of a constant K, real linear factors of the
form x  ai, and real quadratic factors of the form x2 C bix C ci having no real
roots. The linear and quadratic factors may be repeated:
Q.x/ D K.x  a1/m1.x  a2/m2    .x  aj /mj .x2 C b1x C c1/n1
   .x2 C bkx C ck/nk:
The degree of Q is m1 C m2 C    C mj C 2n1 C 2n2 C    C 2nk.
(b) The rational function P.x/=Q.x/ can be expressed as a sum of partial fractions
as follows:
(i) corresponding to each factor .x  a/m of Q.x/ the decomposition contains a
sum of fractions of the form
A1
x  a C
A2
.x  a/2 C    C

.x  a/m I

CHAPTER 6

(ii) corresponding to each factor .x2 C bx C c/n of Q.x/ the decomposition
contains a sum of fractions of the form
B1x C C1
x2 C bx C c C
B2x C C2
.x2 C bx C c/2 C    C
Bnx C Cn
.x2 C bx C c/n :
The constants A1; A2; : : : ; Am; B1; B2; : : : ; Bn; C1; C2; : : : ; Cn can be
determined by adding up the fractions in the decomposition and equating the
coefﬁcients of like powers of x in the numerator of the sum with those in
P.x/.
Part (a) of the above theorem is just a restatement of results discussed and proved in
Section P.6 and Appendix II. The proof of part (b) is algebraic in nature and is beyond
the scope of this text.
Note that part (a) does not tell us how to ﬁnd the factors of Q.x/; it tells us only
what form they have. We must know the factors of Q before we can make use of partial
fractions to integrate the rational function P.x/=Q.x/. Partial fraction decompositions
are also used in other mathematical situations, in particular, to solve certain problems
involving differential equations.

6.3
Inverse Substitutions
The substitutions considered in Section 5.6 were direct substitutions in the sense that
we simpliﬁed an integrand by replacing an expression appearing in it with a single
variable. In this section we consider the reverse approach: we replace the variable
of integration with a function of a new variable. Such substitutions, called inverse
substitutions, would appear on the surface to make the integral more complicated.
That is, substituting x D g.u/ in the integral
Z b
a
f .x/ dx
leads to the more “complicated” integral
Z xDb
xDa
f

g.u/

g0.u/ du:
As we will see, however, sometimes such substitutions can actually simplify an in-
tegrand, transforming the integral into one that can be evaluated by inspection or to
which other techniques can readily be applied. In any event, inverse substitutions can
often be used to convert integrands to rational functions to which the methods of Sec-
tion 6.2 can be applied.
The Inverse Trigonometric Substitutions
Three very useful inverse substitutions are
x D a sin ;
x D a tan ;
and
x D a sec :
These correspond to the direct substitutions
 D sin1 x
a ;
 D tan1 x
a ;
and
 D sec1 x
a D cos1 a
x :
The inverse sine substitution
Integrals involving
p
a2  x2 (where a > 0) can frequently be reduced to a
simpler form by means of the substitution
x D a sin 
or, equivalently,
 D sin1 x
a :
Observe that
p
a2  x2 makes sense only if a  x  a, which corresponds to
=2    =2. Since cos   0 for such , we have

(If cos  were not nonnegative, we would have obtained aj cos j instead.) If needed,

right-angled triangle labelled to correspond to the substitution (see Figure 6.1)

As an alternative to the inverse secant substitution x D a sec  to simplify integrals

If more than one fractional power is present, it may be possible to eliminate all of them
at once.

The tan(/2) Substitution
There is a certain special substitution that can transform an integral whose integrand is
a rational function of sin  and cos  (i.e., a quotient of polynomials in sin  and cos )
into a rational function of x. The substitution is
x D tan 

or, equivalently,
 D 2 tan1 x:

Other Methods for Evaluating Integrals
Sections 5.6 and 6.1–6.3 explore some standard methods for evaluating both deﬁnite
and indeﬁnite integrals of functions belonging to several well-deﬁned classes. There is
another such method that is often used to solve certain kinds of differential equations
but can also be helpful for evaluating integrals; after all, integrating f .x/ is equivalent
to solving the DE dy=dx D f .x/. It goes by the name of the Method of Undeter-
mined Coefﬁcients or the Method of Judicious Guessing, and we will investigate it
below.
Although anyone who uses calculus should be familiar with the basic techniques of
integration, just as anyone who uses arithmetic should be familiar with the techniques
of multiplication and division, technology is steadily eroding the necessity for being
able to do long, complicated integrals by such methods. In fact, today there are several
computer programs that can manipulate mathematical expressions symbolically (rather
than just numerically) and that can carry out, with little or no assistance from us, the
various algebraic steps and limit calculations that are required to calculate and simplify
both derivatives and integrals. Much pain can be avoided and time saved by having the

.x4  1/.x4  16/2 dx
rather than doing it by hand using partial fractions. Even without the aid of a computer,
we can use tables of standard integrals such as the ones in the back endpapers of
this book to help us evaluate complicated integrals. Using computers or tables can
nevertheless require that we perform some simpliﬁcations beforehand and can make
demands on our ability to interpret the answers we get. We also examine some such
situations in this section.
The Method of Undetermined Coefﬁcients
The method consists of guessing a family of functions that may contain the integral,
then using differentiation to select the member of the family with the derivative that
matches the integrand. It should be stressed that both people and machines are able
to calculate derivatives with fewer complications than are involved in calculating inte-
grals.
The method of undetermined coefﬁcients is not so much a method as a strategy,
because the family might be chosen on little more than an informed guess. But other
integration methods can involve guesswork too. There can be some guesswork, for
example, in deciding which integration technique will work best. What technique is
best can remain unclear even after considerable effort has been expended. For undeter-
mined coefﬁcients, matters are clear. If the wrong family is guessed, a contradiction
quickly emerges. Moreover, because of its broad nature, it provides a general alterna-
tive to other integration techniques. Often the guess is easily made. For example, if
the integrand belongs to a family that remains unchanged under differentiation, then a
good ﬁrst guess at the form of the antiderivative is that family. A few examples will
illustrate the technique.
EXAMPLE 1

Z
.x2 C x C 1/ ex dx using the method of undeter-

Solution
Experience tells us that the derivative of a polynomial times an exponential
is a different polynomial of the same degree times the exponential. Thus, we “guess”
that
I D .a0 C a1x C a2x2/ ex C C:
We differentiate I and equate the result to the integrand to determine the actual values
of the coefﬁeients a0, a1, and a2.

CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
Solution
The derivative of a sum of products of polynomials with sine or cosine
functions is a sum of products of polynomials with sine or cosine functions. Thus, we
try y D P.x/ cos.3x/ C Q.x/ sin.3x/ C C, where P.x/ and Q.x/ are polynomials
of degrees m and n, respectively. The degrees m and n and the coefﬁcients of the
polynomials are determined by setting the derivative y0 equal to the given integrand
x3 cos.3x/.
y0 D P 0.x/ cos.3x/  3P.x/ sin.3x/ C Q0.x/ sin.3x/ C 3Q0.x/ cos.3x/
D x3 cos 3x:
Equating coefﬁcients of like trigonometric functions, we ﬁnd
P 0.x/ C 3Q.x/ D x3
and
Q0.x/  3P.x/ D 0:
The second of these equations requires that m D n  1. From the ﬁrst we conclude
that n D 3, which implies that m D 2. Thus, we let P.x/ D p0 C p1x C p2x2 and
Q.x/ D q0 C q1x C q2x2 C q3x3 in these equations:
p1 C 2p2x C 3.q0 C q1x C q2x2 C q3x3/ D x3
q1 C 2q2x C 3q3x2  3.p0 C p1x C p2x2/ D 0:
Comparison of coefﬁcients with like powers yields:

which leads to q3 D 1=3, p2 D 1=3, q1 D 2=9, and p0 D 2=27, with p1 D q0 D

Remark
These examples and most in the following exercises can also be done using
integration by parts. Using undetermined coefﬁcients does not replace other methods,
but it does provide an alternative that gives insight into what types of functions will not
work as guesses for the integral. This has implications for how computer algorithms
can and cannot do antiderivatives. This issue is taken up in Exercise 21. Moreover, with
access to a differentiation algorithm and a computer to manage details, this method
can sometimes produce integrals more quickly and precisely than classical techniques
alone.
Using Maple for Integration
Computer algebra systems are capable of evaluating both indeﬁnite and deﬁnite in-
tegrals symbolically, as well as giving numerical approximations for those deﬁnite
integrals that have numerical values. The following examples show how to use Maple
to evaluate integrals.
We begin by calculating
Z
2xp
1 C 4x dx and
Z 
0
2xp
1 C 4x dx.
We use Maple’s “int” command, specifying the function and the variable of inte-
gration:
>
int(2^x*sqrt(1+4^x),x);
e.x ln.2//p
1 C .e.x ln.2///2
2 ln.2/
C arcsinh.e.x ln.2///
2 ln.2/
If you don’t like the inverse hyperbolic sine, you can convert it to a logarithm:
>
convert(%,ln);
e.x ln.2//p
1 C .e.x ln.2///22 ln.2/ C ln

e.x ln.2// C
p
1 C .e.x ln.2///2

2 ln.2/
The “%” there refers to the result of the previous calculation. Note how Maple prefers
to use ex ln 2 in place of 2x.
For the deﬁnite integral, you specify the interval of values of the variable of inte-
gration using two dots between the endpoints as follows:
>
int(2^x*sqrt(1+4^x),x=0..Pi);

p
2  ln.1 C
p
2/ C 2p
1 C 4 C ln.2 C
p
1 C 4/
2 ln.2/
If you want a decimal approximation to this exact answer, you can ask Maple to evalu-
ate the last result as a ﬂoating-point number:
>
evalf(%);
56:955 421 55
M
Remark
Maple defaults to giving 10 signiﬁcant digits in its ﬂoating-point numbers
unless you request a different precision by declaring a value for the variable “Digits”:
>
Digits := 20; evalf(Pi);
3:141 592 653 589 793 238 5
Suppose we ask Maple to do an integral that we know we can’t do ourselves:

Note the use of the inert Maple command “Int” on the left side to simply print the
integral without any evaluation. The active command “int” performs the evaluation.
Computer algebra programs can be used to integrate symbolically many functions,
but you may get some surprises when you use them, and you may have to do some of
the work to get an answer useful in the context of the problem on which you are work-
ing. Such programs, and some of the more sophisticated scientiﬁc calculators, are able
to evaluate deﬁnite integrals numerically to any desired degree of accuracy even if
symbolic antiderivatives cannot be found. We will discuss techniques of numerical in-
tegration in Sections 6.6–6.8, but note here that Maple’s evalf(Int()) can always
be used to get numerical values:
>
evalf(Int(sin(cos(x)),x=0..1));

Using Integral Tables
You can get some help evaluating integrals by using an integral table, such as the one in
the back endpapers of this book. Besides giving the values of the common elementary
integrals that you likely remember while you are studying calculus, they also give many
more complicated integrals, especially ones representing standard types that often arise
in applications. Familiarize yourself with the main headings under which the integrals
are classiﬁed. Using the tables usually means massaging your integral using simple
substitutions until you get it into the form of one of the integrals in the table.
EXAMPLE 4
Use the table to evaluate I D
Z
t5
p
3  2t4 dt.
Solution
This integral doesn’t resemble any in the tables, but there are numerous
integrals in the tables involving
p
a2  x2. We can begin to put the integral into this
form with the substitution t2 D u, so that 2t dt D du. Thus,
I D 1
2
Z
u2
p
3  2u2 du:
This is not quite what we want yet; let us get rid of the 2 multiplying the u2 under
the square root. One way to do this is with the change of variable
p
2u D x, so that
du D dx=

Special Functions Arising from Integrals
The integrals
Z dx
x D ln x C C
and
Z
dx
1 C x2 D tan1 x C C
both take algebraic functions to a function that is not produced by adding, subtracting,
multiplying, or dividing. In the ﬁrst case the integral expands the class of functions to
include logarithms, and in the second case, trigonometric functions.
The functions we have dealt with so far have mostly come from a class called Ele-
mentary Functions, which consists of polynomials, logarithms, exponentials, trigono-
metric and hyperbolic functions, and their inverses, and also ﬁnite sums, differences,
products, quotients, powers, and roots of such functions. The derivative of any dif-
ferentiable elementary function is elementary, but an integral may or may not be el-
ementary. This expands the class of functions to a wider class known, for historical
reasons, as Special Functions. The subject of Special Functions is a large topic in
applied mathematics. There are many standard special functions that are thoroughly
studied and important for applications. For instance,
J0.x/ D 1

Z 
0
cos.x sin t/dt
is a special function known as a Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order zero. It is a
solution of Bessel’s equation (see Exercise 20), which is a differential equation. Tradi-
tionally, this function is introduced when series methods are used to solve differential
equations (see Section 18.8), but it can be deﬁned as a deﬁnite integral.

362
CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
Another example is the Error Function, arising in the ﬁeld of probability and
statistics. It is encountered in connection with the integral of f .x/ D ex2, which
does not have an elementary integral. If one did have such an integral, it would have
to be of the form
Z
ex2 dx D P.x/ ex2
for some polynomial P having ﬁnite degree. Such is not possible. See Exercise 21
below.
To deal with this situation we use the error function deﬁned as
erf.x/ D

It follows that
Z

At ﬁrst, this may seem like the integral is merely dressed up with a new name. In a way
that is true, but it would be equally true for ln x or tan1 x above if we knew nothing
about them other than the integral deﬁnition. But we know more about ln x; tan1 x,
and erf.x/ than simply that they are antiderivatives of simpler functions. Above all, we
know that they are functions in their own right that are not algebraic in the case of the
ﬁrst two and not an elementary function in the latter case.

Improper Integrals
Up to this point, we have considered deﬁnite integrals of the form
I D
Z b
a
f .x/ dx;
where the integrand f is continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b. Since such a
function is necessarily bounded, the integral I is necessarily a ﬁnite number; for posi-
tive f it corresponds to the area of a bounded region of the plane, a region contained
inside some disk of ﬁnite radius with centre at the origin. Such integrals are also called
proper integrals. We are now going to generalize the deﬁnite integral to allow for two
possibilities excluded in the situation described above:
(i) We may have a D 1 or b D 1 or both.
(ii) f may be unbounded as x approaches a or b or both.
Integrals satisfying (i) are called improper integrals of type I; integrals satisfying (ii)
are called improper integrals of type II. Either type of improper integral corresponds
(for positive f ) to the area of a region in the plane that “extends to inﬁnity” in some
direction and therefore is unbounded. As we will see, such integrals may or may not
have ﬁnite values. The ideas involved are best introduced by examples.
Improper Integrals of Type I
EXAMPLE 1
Find the area of the region A lying under the curve y D 1=x2 and
above the x-axis to the right of x D 1. (See Figure 6.8(a).)
Solution
We would like to calculate the area with an integral
A D
Z 1
1
dx
x2 ;
which is improper of type I, since its interval of integration is inﬁnite. It is not im-
mediately obvious whether the area is ﬁnite; the region has an inﬁnitely long “spike”
along the x-axis, but this spike becomes inﬁnitely thin as x approaches 1. In order
to evaluate this improper integral, we interpret it as a limit of proper integrals over
intervals Œ1; R as R ! 1. (See Figure 6.8(b).)

We say that this improper integral diverges to inﬁnity. Observe that the region has a
similar shape to the region under y D 1=x2 considered in the above example, but its
“spike” is somewhat thicker at each value of x > 1. Evidently, the extra thickness
makes a big difference; this region has inﬁnite area.
DEFINITION

Improper integrals of type I
If f is continuous on Œa; 1/, we deﬁne the improper integral of f over Œa; 1/
as a limit of proper integrals:
Z 1
a
f .x/ dx D lim
R!1
Z R
a
f .x/ dx:
Similarly, if f is continuous on .1; b, then we deﬁne
Z b
1
f .x/ dx D
lim
R!1
Z b
R
f .x/ dx:
In either case, if the limit exists (is a ﬁnite number), we say that the im-
proper integral converges; if the limit does not exist, we say that the improper
integral diverges. If the limit is 1 (or 1), we say the improper integral
diverges to inﬁnity (or diverges to negative inﬁnity).
The integral
R 1
1 f .x/ dx is, for f continuous on the real line, improper of type I at
both endpoints. We break it into two separate integrals:
Z 1
1
f .x/ dx D
Z 0
1
f .x/ dx C
Z 1
0
f .x/ dx:
The integral on the left converges if and only if both integrals on the right converge.

The use of symmetry here requires some justiﬁcation. At the time we used it we did
not know whether each of the half-line integrals was ﬁnite or inﬁnite. However, since
both are positive, even if they are inﬁnite, their sum would still be twice one of them.
If one had been positive and the other negative, we would not have been justiﬁed in
cancelling them to get 0 until we knew that they were ﬁnite. (1C1 D 1, but 11
is not deﬁned.) In any event, the given integral converges to .

This limit does not exist (and it is not 1 or 1), so all we can say is that the given

subtracts the areas of the hills and valleys but does not approach any unique limit.

Solution
The area A is given by
A D
Z 1

which is an improper integral of type II since the integrand is unbounded near x D 0.
The region S has a “spike” extending to inﬁnity along the y-axis, a vertical asymptote
of the integrand, as shown in Figure 6.12. As we did for improper integrals of type I,
we express such integrals as limits of proper integrals:

This integral converges, and S has a ﬁnite area of 2 square units.
While improper integrals of type I are always easily recognized because of the inﬁnite
limits of integration, improper integrals of type II can be somewhat harder to spot. You
should be alert for singularities of integrands and especially points where they have
vertical asymptotes. It may be necessary to break an improper integral into several
improper integrals if it is improper at both endpoints or at points inside the interval of
integration. For example,

The integrals in Theorem 2 are called p-integrals. It is very useful to know when
they converge and diverge when you have to decide whether certain other improper
integrals converge or not and you can’t ﬁnd the appropriate antiderivatives. (See the
discussion of estimating convergence below.) Note that
R 1

for any value of p.

CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
Remark
If f is continuous on the interval Œa; b so that
R b
a f .x/ dx is a proper
deﬁnite integral, then treating the integral as improper will lead to the same value:
lim
c!aC
Z b
c
f .x/ dx D
Z b
a
f .x/ dx D lim
c!b
Z c
a
f .x/ dx:
This justiﬁes the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral of a piecewise continuous function
that was given in Section 5.4. To integrate a function deﬁned to be different continuous
functions on different intervals, we merely add the integrals of the various component
functions over their respective intervals. Any of these integrals may be proper or im-
proper; if any are improper, all must converge or the given integral will diverge.

Estimating Convergence and Divergence
When an improper integral cannot be evaluated by the Fundamental Theorem of Calcu-
lus because an antiderivative can’t be found, we may still be able to determine whether
the integral converges by comparing it with simpler integrals. The following theorem
is central to this approach.
T H E O R E M

A comparison theorem for integrals
Let 1  a < b  1, and suppose that functions f and g are continuous on the
interval .a; b/ and satisfy 0  f .x/  g.x/. If
R b
a g.x/ dx converges, then so does
R b
a f .x/ dx, and
Z b
a
f .x/ dx 
Z b
a
g.x/ dx:
Equivalently, if
R b
a f .x/ dx diverges to 1, then so does
R b
a g.x/ dx.
PROOF
Since both integrands are nonnegative, there are only two possibilities for
each integral: it can either converge to a nonnegative number or diverge to 1. Since
f .x/  g.x/ on .a; b/, it follows by Theorem 3(e) of Section 5.4 that if a < r < s <
b, then
Z s

This theorem now follows by taking limits as r ! aC and s ! b.

The Trapezoid and Midpoint Rules
Most of the applications of integration, within and outside of mathematics, involve the
deﬁnite integral
I D
Z b
a
f .x/ dx:
Thanks to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate such deﬁnite inte-
grals by ﬁrst ﬁnding an antiderivative of f: This is why we have spent considerable
time developing techniques of integration. There are, however, two obstacles that can
prevent our calculating I in this way:
(i) Finding an antiderivative of f in terms of familiar functions may be impossible,
or at least very difﬁcult.
(ii) We may not be given a formula for f .x/ as a function of x; for instance, f .x/
may be an unknown function whose values at certain points of the interval Œa; b
have been determined by experimental measurement.
In the next two sections we investigate the problem of approximating the value of the
deﬁnite integral I using only the values of f .x/ at ﬁnitely many points of Œa; b. Ob-
taining such an approximation is called numerical integration. Upper and lower sums
(or, indeed, any Riemann sum) can be used for this purpose, but these usually require
much more calculation to yield a desired precision than the methods we will develop

372
CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
here. We will develop three methods for evaluating deﬁnite integrals numerically: the
Trapezoid Rule, the Midpoint Rule, and Simpson’s Rule (see Section 6.7). All of these
methods can be easily implemented on a small computer or using a scientiﬁc calcula-
tor. The wide availability of these devices makes numerical integration a steadily more
important tool for the user of mathematics. Some of the more advanced calculators
have built-in routines for numerical integration.
All the techniques we consider require us to calculate the values of f .x/ at a set of
equally spaced points in Œa; b. The computational “expense” involved in determining
an approximate value for the integral I will be roughly proportional to the number
of function values required, so that the fewer function evaluations needed to achieve
a desired degree of accuracy for the integral, the better we will regard the technique.
Time is money, even in the world of computers.
The Trapezoid Rule
We assume that f .x/ is continuous on Œa; b and subdivide Œa; b into n subintervals
of equal length h D .b  a/=n using the n C 1 points
x0 D a;
x1 D a C h;
x2 D a C 2h;
: : : ;
xn D a C nh D b:
We assume that the value of f .x/ at each of these points is known:
y0 D f .x0/;
y1 D f .x1/;
y2 D f .x2/;
: : : ;
yn D f .xn/:
The Trapezoid Rule approximates
R b
a f .x/ dx by using straight line segments between
the points .xj 1; yj 1/ and .xj ; yj /, (1  j  n/, to approximate the graph of f;
as shown in Figure 6.15, and summing the areas of the resulting n trapezoids. A
trapezoid is a four-sided polygon with one pair of parallel sides. (For our discus-
sion we assume f is positive so we can talk about “areas,” but the resulting formulas
apply to any continuous function f:)
The ﬁrst trapezoid has vertices .x0; 0/, .x0; y0/, .x1; y1/, and .x1; 0/. The two
parallel sides are vertical and have lengths y0 and y1. The perpendicular distance
between them is h D x1  x0. The area of this trapezoid is h times the average of the
parallel sides:
h y0 C y1

CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
Note how the function values used to calculate T4 were reused in the calculation of T8,
and similarly how those in T8 were reused for T16. When several approximations are
needed, it is very useful to double the number of subintervals for each new calculation
so that previously calculated values of f can be reused.
All Trapezoid Rule approximations to I D
R 2
1 .1=x/ dx are greater than the true value
of I: This is because the graph of y D 1=x is concave up on Œ1; 2, and therefore the
tops of the approximating trapezoids lie above the curve. (See Figure 6.17.)
We can calculate the exact errors in the three approximations since we know that
I D ln 2 D 0:69314718 : : : (We always take the error in an approximation to be the
true value minus the approximate value.)

Observe that the size of the error decreases to about a quarter of its previous value each
time we double n. We will show below that this is to be expected for a “well-behaved”
function like 1=x.
Example 1 is somewhat artiﬁcial in the sense that we know the actual value of
the integral so we really don’t need an approximation. In practical applications of
numerical integration we do not know the actual value. It is tempting to calculate
several approximations for increasing values of n until the two most recent ones agree
to within a prescribed error tolerance. For example, we might be inclined to claim that
ln 2  0:69 : : : from a comparison of T4 and T8, and further comparison of T16 and
T8 suggests that the third decimal place is probably 3: I  0:693 : : : . Although this
approach cannot be justiﬁed in general, it is frequently used in practice.
The Midpoint Rule
A somewhat simpler approximation to
R b
a f .x/ dx, based on the partition of Œa; b into
n equal subintervals, involves forming a Riemann sum of the areas of rectangles whose
heights are taken at the midpoints of the n subintervals. (See Figure 6.18.)

These errors are of opposite sign and about half the size of the corresponding Trape-
zoid Rule errors I  T4 and I  T8. Figure 6.19 suggests the reason for this. The
rectangular area hf .mj / is equal to the area of the trapezoid formed by the tangent
line to y D f .x/ at .mj ; f .mj //. The shaded region above the curve is the part of the
Trapezoid Rule error due to the j th subinterval. The shaded area below the curve is
the corresponding Midpoint Rule error.

One drawback of the Midpoint Rule is that we cannot reuse values of f calculated for
Mn when we calculate M2n. However, to calculate T2n we can use the data values
already calculated for Tn and Mn. Speciﬁcally,
T2n D 1
2.Tn C Mn/:
A good strategy for using these methods to obtain a value for an integral I to a desired
degree of accuracy is to calculate successively
Tn;
Mn;
T2n D Tn C Mn

;
M2n;
T4n D T2n C M2n

until two consecutive terms agree sufﬁciently closely. If a single quick approximation
is needed, Mn is a better choice than Tn.
Error Estimates
The following theorem provides a bound for the error in the Trapezoid and Midpoint
Rule approximations in terms of the second derivative of the integrand.

PROOF
We will prove only the Trapezoid Rule error estimate here. (The one for the
Midpoint Rule is a little easier to prove; the method is suggested in Exercise 14 below.)
The straight line approximating y D f .x/ in the ﬁrst subinterval Œx0; x1 D Œa; a C h
passes through the two points .x0; y0/ and .x1; y1/. Its equation is y D ACB.xx0/,

Let the function g.x/ be the vertical distance between the graph of f and this line:
g.x/ D f .x/  A  B.x  x0/:
Since the integral of ACB.xx0/ over Œx0; x1 is the area of the ﬁrst trapezoid, which
is h.y0 C y1/=2 (see Figure 6.20), the integral of g.x/ over Œx0; x1 is the error in the

The actual errors calculated earlier are considerably smaller than these bounds, be-
cause jf 00.x/j is rather smaller than K D 2 over most of the interval Œ1; 2.
Remark
Error bounds are not usually as easily obtained as they are in Example 3. In
particular, if an exact formula for f .x/ is not known (as is usually the case if the values
of f are obtained from experimental data), then we have no method of calculating
f 00.x/, so we can’t determine K. Theorem 4 is of more theoretical than practical
importance. It shows us that, for a “well-behaved” function f , the Midpoint Rule error
is typically about half as large as the Trapezoid Rule error and that both the Trapezoid
Rule and Midpoint Rule errors can be expected to decrease like 1=n2 as n increases;
in terms of big-O notation,
I D Tn C O
 1
n2

and
I D Mn C O
 1

as n ! 1:
Of course, actual errors are not equal to the error bounds, so they won’t always be cut
to exactly a quarter of their size when we double n.
EXERCISES 6.6
In Exercises 1–4, calculate the approximations T4; M4; T8; M8,
and T16 for the given integrals. (Use a scientiﬁc calculator or
computer spreadsheet program.) Also calculate the exact value of
each integral, and so determine the exact error in each approx-
imation. Compare these exact errors with the bounds for the size
of the error supplied by Theorem 4.

6.7
Simpson’s Rule
The Trapezoid Rule approximation to
R b
a f .x/ dx results from approximating the graph
of f by straight line segments through adjacent pairs of data points on the graph. In-
tuitively, we would expect to do better if we approximate the graph by more general
curves. Since straight lines are the graphs of linear functions, the simplest obvious
generalization is to use the class of quadratic functions, that is, to approximate the
graph of f by segments of parabolas. This is the basis of Simpson’s Rule.
Suppose that we are given three points in the plane, one on each of three equally
spaced vertical lines, spaced, say, h units apart. If we choose the middle of these lines
as the y-axis, then the coordinates of the three points will be, say, .h; yL/, .0; yM /,
and .h; yR/, as illustrated in Figure 6.23.

SECTION 6.7:

Constants A, B, and C can be chosen so that the parabola y D A C Bx C Cx2
passes through these points; substituting the coordinates of the three points into the
equation of the parabola, we get

Thus, the area of the plane region bounded by the parabolic arc, the interval of length
2h on the x-axis, and the left and right vertical lines is equal to .h=3/ times the sum
of the heights of the region at the left and right edges and four times the height at the
middle. (It is independent of the position of the y-axis.)
Now suppose that we are given the same data for f as we were given for the
Trapezoid Rule; that is, we know the values yj D f .xj / .0  j  n/ at n C 1 equally
spaced points

We can approximate the graph of f over pairs of the
subintervals Œxj 1; xj  using parabolic segments and use the integrals of the corre-
sponding quadratic functions to approximate the integrals of f over these subintervals.
Since we need to use the subintervals two at a time, we must assume that n is even.

CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
Note that the Simpson’s Rule approximation Sn requires no more data than does the
Trapezoid Rule approximation Tn; both require the values of f .x/ at n C 1 equally
spaced points. However, Simpson’s Rule treats the data differently, weighting succes-
sive values either 1=3, 2=3, or 4=3. As we will see, this can produce a much better
approximation to the integral of f:

These errors are evidently much smaller than the corresponding errors for the Trape-
zoid or Midpoint Rule approximations.
Remark
Simpson’s Rule S2n makes use of the same 2n C 1 data values that Tn and
Mn together use. It is not difﬁcult to verify that
S2n D Tn C 2Mn

S2n D 2T2n C Mn

and
S2n D 4T2n  Tn

:
Figure 6.19 and Theorem 4 in Section 6.6 suggest why the ﬁrst of these formulas ought
to yield a particularly good approximation to I:
Obtaining an error estimate for Simpson’s Rule is more difﬁcult than for the Trape-
zoid Rule. We state the appropriate estimate in the following theorem, but we do not
attempt any proof. Proofs can be found in textbooks on numerical analysis.

This accounts for the fact that Sn is a much better approximation than is Tn, provided
that h is small and jf .4/.x/j is not unduly large compared with jf 00.x/j. Note also
that for any (even) n, Sn gives the exact value of the integral of any cubic function
f .x/ D A C Bx C Cx2 C Dx3; f .4/.x/ D 0 identically for such f; so we can take
K D 0 in the error estimate.

Other Aspects of Approximate Integration
The numerical methods described in Sections 6.6 and 6.7 are suitable for ﬁnding ap-
proximate values for integrals of the form
I D
Z b
a
f .x/ dx;
where Œa; b is a ﬁnite interval and the integrand f is “well-behaved” on Œa; b. In
particular, I must be a proper integral. There are many other methods for dealing
with such integrals, some of which we mention later in this section. First, however,
we consider what can be done if the function f isn’t “well-behaved” on Œa; b. We
mean by this that either the integral is improper or f doesn’t have sufﬁciently many
continuous derivatives on Œa; b to justify whatever numerical methods we want to use.
The ideas of this section are best presented by means of concrete examples.
EXAMPLE 1
Describe how to would evaluate the integral I D
Z 1

numerically?
Solution
Although I is a proper integral, with integrand f .x/ D px ex satisfying
f .x/ ! 0 as x ! 0C, nevertheless, the standard numerical methods can be expected
to perform poorly for I because the derivatives of f are not bounded near 0. This
problem is easily remedied; just make the change of variable x D t2 and rewrite I in
the form
I D 2
Z 1
0
t2 et2 dt;

SECTION 6.8:

whose integrand g.t/ D t2 et2 has bounded derivatives near 0. The latter integral can
be efﬁciently approximated by the methods of Sections 6.6 and 6.7.
Approximating Improper Integrals

However, since limx!0C

this difﬁculty:

The latter integral is not improper and is well-behaved. Numerical techniques can be

EXAMPLE 3
Show how to evaluate I D
Z 1

dx
p

Solution
Here, the integral is improper of type I; the interval of integration is inﬁnite.
Although there is no singularity at x D 0, it is still useful to break the integral into two
parts:
I D
Z 1

p

Z 1

Example 3 suggests that when an integral is taken over an inﬁnite interval, a change of
variable should be made to convert the integral to a ﬁnite interval.
Using Taylor’s Formula
Taylor’s formula (see Section 4.10) can sometimes be useful for evaluating integrals.
Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 4
Use Taylor’s formula for f .x/ D ex; obtained in Section 4.10,
to evaluate the integral

where the constants Cj depend on the 2j th derivative of f: It is possible to use this
formula to obtain higher-order approximations to I; starting with Trapezoid Rule ap-
proximations. The technique is known as Romberg integration or Richardson ex-
trapolation.
To begin, suppose we have constructed Trapezoid Rule approximations for values

also divide by 3 and deﬁne T 1

(The C 1

ones, T 1
kC1 ought to be a better approximation to I than T 0
kC1 since we have elimi-
nated the lowest order (and therefore the largest) of the error terms, C1=4kC1. In fact,
Exercise 8 in Section 6.7 shows that T 1
kC1 D S2kC1, the Simpson’s Rule approximation
based on 2kC1 subintervals.
We can continue the process of eliminating error terms begun above. Replacing
k C 1 by k C 2 in the expression for T 1

Solution
We will carry all calculations to 8 decimal places. Since we must obtain
R4, we will need to ﬁnd all the entries in the ﬁrst ﬁve columns of the scheme. First we
calculate the ﬁrst two Trapezoid Rule approximations:

The various approximations calculated above suggest that for any given value of n D
2k, the Romberg approximation Rn should give the best value obtainable for the inte-
gral based on the n C 1 data values y0, y1, : : : , yn. This is so only if the derivatives
f .n/.x/ do not grow too rapidly as n increases.
The Importance of Higher-Order Methods
Higher-order methods, such as Romberg, remove lower-order error by manipulating
series. Removing lower-order error is of enormous importance for computation. With-
out it, even simple computations would be impossible for all practical purposes. For
example, consider again the integral I D
Z 2
1
1
x dx.
We can use Maple to compute this integral numerically to 16 digits (classical
double precision),
>
Digits=16:
>
int(1/x, x = 1 .. 2.);

Comparison with ln 2

ln(2.);
0:6931471805599453
conﬁrms the consistency of this calculation. Furthermore, we can compute the proces-
sor time for this calculation
>
time(int(1/x, x = 1 .. 2.));
0:033
which indicates that, on the system used, 16 digits of accuracy is produced in hun-
dredths of seconds of processor time.
Now let’s consider what happens without removing lower-order error. If we were
to estimate this integral using a simple end point Riemann sum, as we used in the
original deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral, the error is O.h/ or O.1=n/. Let the step size
be 107.
>
1e-7*add(1/(1+i/1e7), i = 1 .. 1e7);
0:6931471555599459
which has an error of 2:5  108. The processor time used to do this sum computation
is given by

388
CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
>
time(1e-7*add(1/(1+i/1e7), i = 1 .. 1e7));
175:777
that is, 175.577 seconds on the particular computer we used. (If you do the calculation
on your machine your result will vary according to the speed of your system.) Note that
we used the Maple “add” routine rather than “sum” in the calculations above. This
was done to tell Maple to add the ﬂoating-point values of the terms one after another
rather than to attempt a symbolic summation.
Because the computation time is proportional to the number n of rectangles used
in the Riemann sum, and because the error is proportional to 1=n, it follows that error
times computation time is roughly constant. We can use this to estimate the time to
compute the integral by this method to 16 digits of precision. Assuming an error of
1016, the time for the computation will be
175:777  2:5  108
1016
seconds,
or about 1,400 years.
Maple is not limited to 16 digits, of course. For each additional digit of precision,
the Riemann sum method corresponds to a factor-of-ten increase in time because of
lower-order error. The ability to compute such quantities is a powerful and important
application of series expansions.
Other Methods
As developed above, the Trapezoid, Midpoint, Simpson, and Romberg methods all in-
volved using equal subdivisions of the interval Œa; b. There are other methods that
avoid this restriction. In particular, Gaussian approximations involve selecting eval-
uation points and weights in an optimal way so as to give the most accurate results
for “well-behaved” functions. See Exercises 11–13 below. You can consult a text on
numerical analysis to learn more about this method.
Finally, we note that even when you apply one of the methods of Sections 6.6 and
6.7, it may be advisable for you to break up the integral into two or more integrals over
smaller intervals and then use different subinterval lengths h for each of the different
integrals. You will want to evaluate the integrand at more points in an interval where
its graph is changing direction erratically than in one where the graph is better behaved.

A
(Estimating computation time) With higher-order methods,
the time to compute remains proportional to the number of
intervals n used to numerically approximate an integral. But
the error is reduced. For the Trapezoid Rule the error goes as
O.1=n2/. When n D 1  107, the error turns out to be
6  1016. The computation time is approximately the same
as that computed for the Riemann sum approximation to
R 2
1 .1=x/ dx discussed above (175.777 seconds for our
computer), because we need essentially the same number of
function evaluations. How long would it take our computer to
get the trapezoid approximation to have quadruple (i.e.,
32-digit) precession?
21.
A
Repeat the previous exercise, but this time using Simpson’s
Rule, whose error is O.1=n4/. Again use the same time,
175.777 s for n D 1  107, but for Simpson’s Rule the error for
this calculation is 3:15  1030. How long would we expect
our computer to take to achieve 32-digit accuracy (i.e., error
1032)? Note, however, that Maple’s integration package for
the computer used took 0.134 seconds to achieve this
precision. Will it have used a higher-order method than
Simpson’s Rule to achieve this time?

Summary of Techniques of Integration
Students sometimes have difﬁculty deciding which method to use
to evaluate a given integral. Often no one method will sufﬁce to
produce the whole solution, but one method may lead to a different,
possibly simpler, integral that can then be dealt with on its own
merits. Here are a few guidelines:
1. First, and always, be alert for simplifying substitutions. Even
when these don’t accomplish the whole integration, they can
lead to integrals to which some other method can be applied.

390
CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
2. If the integral involves a quadratic expression Ax2 C Bx C
C with A ¤ 0 and B ¤ 0, complete the square. A simple
substitution then reduces the quadratic expression to a sum or
difference of squares.
3. Integrals of products of trigonometric functions can sometimes
be evaluated or rendered simpler by the use of appropriate
trigonometric identities such as:
sin2 x C cos2 x D 1
sec2 x D 1 C tan2 x
csc2 x D 1 C cot2 x
sin x cos x D 1
2 sin 2x
sin2 x D 1
2.1  cos 2x/
cos2 x D 1
2.1 C cos 2x/:
4. Integrals involving .a2 x2/1=2 can be transformed using x D
a sin . Integrals involving .a2 C x2/1=2 or 1=.a2 C x2/ may
yield to x D a tan . Integrals involving .x2  a2/1=2 can be
transformed using x D a sec  or x D a cosh .
5. Use integration by parts for integrals of functions such as prod-
ucts of polynomials and transcendental functions, and for in-
verse trigonometric functions and logarithms. Be alert for ways
of using integration by parts to obtain formulas representing
complicated integrals in terms of simpler ones.
6. Use partial fractions to integrate rational functions whose de-
nominators can be factored into real linear and quadratic fac-
tors. Remember to divide the polynomials ﬁrst, if necessary, to
reduce the fraction to one whose numerator has degree smaller
than that of its denominator.
7. There is a table of integrals at the back of this book. If you
can’t do an integral directly, try to use the methods above to
convert it to the form of one of the integrals in the table.
8. If you can’t ﬁnd any way to evaluate a deﬁnite integral for
which you need a numerical value, consider using a computer
or calculator and one of the numerical methods presented in
Sections 6.6–6.8.

Introduction
Numerous quantities in mathematics, physics, economics,
biology, and indeed any quantitative science can be con-
veniently represented by integrals. In addition to measuring plane areas, the problem
that motivated the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral, we can use these integrals to ex-
press volumes of solids, lengths of curves, areas of surfaces, forces, work, energy,
pressure, probabilities, dollar values of a stream of payments, and a variety of other
quantities that are in one sense or another equivalent to areas under graphs.
In addition, as we saw previously, many of the basic principles that govern the
behaviour of our world are expressed in terms of differential equations and initial-value
problems. Indeﬁnite integration is a key tool in the solution of such problems.
In this chapter we examine some of these applications. For the most part they are
independent of one another, and for that reason some of the later sections in this chapter
can be regarded as optional material. The material of Sections 7.1–7.3, however, should
be regarded as core because these ideas will arise again in the study of multivariable
calculus.
7.1
Volumes by Slicing—Solids of Revolution
In this section we show how volumes of certain three-dimensional regions (or solids)
can be expressed as deﬁnite integrals and thereby determined. We will not attempt
to give a deﬁnition of volume but will rely on our intuition and experience with solid

objects to provide enough insight for us to specify the volumes of certain simple solids.
For example, if the base of a rectangular box is a rectangle of length l and width w (and
therefore area A D lw), and if the box has height h, then its volume is V D Ah D lwh.
If l, w, and h are measured in units (e.g., centimetres), then the volume is expressed in
cubic units (cubic centimetres, or cm3).
What is a cylinder? The word
“cylinder” has two different but
related meanings in Mathe-
matics. As used in this Section,
it is a solid object lying between
congruent bases in two parallel
planes and inside a surface (the
cylindrical wall) consisting of
parallel line segments joining
corresponding points on the
boundaries of those bases. The
second meaning for “cylinder”
that we will encounter in Chapter
10 and later, extends the concept
of the cylindrical wall of a solid
cylinder. It is a surface
consisting of a family of parallel
straight lines in three dimension-
al space that intersect a plane
perpendicular to those lines in a
curve C. In this case the cylinder
is circular if C is a circle.
A rectangular box is a special case of a solid called a cylinder. (See Figure 7.1.)
Such a solid has a ﬂat base occupying a region R in a plane, and consists of all points
on parallel straight line segments having one end in R and the other end in a (necessar-
ily congruent) region in a second plane parallel to the plane of the base. Either of these
regions can be called the base of the cylinder. The cylindrical wall is the surface con-
sisting of the parallel line segments joining corresponding points on the boundaries of
the two bases. A cylinder having a polygonal base (i.e., one bounded by straight lines)
is usually called a prism. The height of any cylinder or prism is the perpendicular
distance between the parallel planes containing the two bases. If this height is h units
and the area of a base is A square units, then the volume of the cylinder or prism is
V D Ah cubic units.
We use the adjective right to describe a cylinder or prism if the parallel line seg-
ments that constitute it are perpendicular to the base planes; otherwise, the cylinder or
prism is called oblique. For example, a right cylinder whose bases are circular disks
of radius r units and whose height is h units is called a right circular cylinder; its
volume is V D r2h cubic units. Obliqueness has no effect on the volume V D Ah
of a prism or cylinder since h is always measured in a direction perpendicular to the
base.

cylinder is the area A of its base times its

Volumes by Slicing
Knowing the volume of a cylinder enables us to determine the volumes of some more
general solids. We can divide solids into thin “slices” by parallel planes. (Think of a
loaf of sliced bread.) Each slice is approximately a cylinder of very small “height”;
the height is the thickness of the slice. See Figure 7.2, where the height is measured

horizontally in the x direction. If we know the cross-sectional area of each slice, we
can determine its volume and sum these volumes to ﬁnd the volume of the solid.
To be speciﬁc, suppose that the solid S lies between planes perpendicular to the
x-axis at positions x D a and x D b and that the cross-sectional area of S in the plane
perpendicular to the x-axis at x is a known function A.x/, for a  x  b. We assume
that A.x/ is continuous on Œa; b. If a D x0 < x1 < x2 <    < xn1 < xn D b,
then P D fx0; x1; x2; : : : ; xn1; xng is a partition of Œa; b into n subintervals, and
the planes perpendicular to the x-axis at x1, x2, : : : ; xn1 divide the solid into n slices
of which the ith has thickness xi D xi  xi1. The volume Vi of that slice lies

The volume of the solid is therefore given by the Riemann sum
V D

Vi D

A.ci/ xi:
Letting n approach inﬁnity in such a way that max xi approaches 0, we obtain the
deﬁnite integral of A.x/ over Œa; b as the limit of this Riemann sum. Therefore:
The volume V of a solid between x D a and x D b having cross-sectional
area A.x/ at position x is
V D
Z b
a
A.x/ dx:
There is another way to obtain this formula and others of a similar nature. Consider
a slice of the solid between the planes perpendicular to the x-axis at positions x and
x Cx. Since A.x/ is continuous, it doesn’t change much in a short interval, so if x
is small, then the slice has volume V approximately equal to the volume of a cylinder
of base area A.x/ and height x:
V  A.x/ x:
The error in this approximation is small compared to the size of V: This suggests,
correctly, that the volume element, that is, the volume of an inﬁnitely thin slice of
thickness dx is dV D A.x/ dx, and that the volume of the solid is the “sum” (i.e.,
the integral) of these volume elements between the two ends of the solid, x D a and
x D b (see Figure 7.4):

The volume element
We will use this differential element approach to model other applications that result
in integrals rather than setting up explicit Riemann sums each time. Even though this
argument does not constitute a proof of the formula, you are strongly encouraged to
think of the formula this way; the volume is the integral of the volume elements.
Solids of Revolution
Many common solids have circular cross-sections in planes perpendicular to some
axis. Such solids are called solids of revolution because they can be generated by
rotating a plane region about an axis in that plane so that it sweeps out the solid. For
example, a solid ball is generated by rotating a half-disk about the diameter of that
half-disk (Figure 7.5(a)). Similarly, a solid right-circular cone is generated by rotating
a right-angled triangle about one of its legs (Figure 7.5(b)).
If the region R bounded by y D f .x/, y D 0, x D a, and x D b is rotated about
the x-axis, then the cross-section of the solid generated in the plane perpendicular to
the x-axis at x is a circular disk of radius jf .x/j. The area of this cross-section is

Solution
First, we solve the pair of equations y D x2 and y D 1 to obtain the
intersections at x D 1 and x D 1. The solid lies between these two values of x. The
area element of R at position x is a vertical strip of width dx extending upward from
y D x2 to y D 1. When R is rotated about the line y D 2, this area element sweeps
out a thin, washer-shaped volume element of thickness dx and radius 2  x2, having a
hole of radius 1 through the middle. (See Figure 7.7.) The cross-sectional area of this
element is the area of a circle of radius 2  x2 minus the area of the hole, a circle of

Sometimes we want to rotate a region bounded by curves with equations of the form

horizontal slices instead of vertical ones.

Cylindrical Shells
Suppose that the region R bounded by y D f .x/  0, y D 0, x D a  0, and
x D b > a is rotated about the y-axis to generate a solid of revolution. In order
to ﬁnd the volume of the solid using (plane) slices, we would need to know the cross-
sectional area A.y/ in each plane of height y, and this would entail solving the equation
y D f .x/ for one or more solutions of the form x D g.y/. In practice this can be
inconvenient or impossible.

out a volume element in the shape of a circular cylindrical shell having radius x, height
f .x/, and thickness dx. (See Figure 7.9.) Regard this shell as a rolled-up rectangular
slab with dimensions 2x, f .x/, and dx; evidently, it has volume

The volume of the solid of revolution is the sum (integral) of the volumes of such

We have described two methods for determining the volume of a solid of revolution,
slicing and cylindrical shells. The choice of method for a particular solid is usually
dictated by the form of the equations deﬁning the region being rotated and by the axis
of rotation. The volume element dV can always be determined by rotating a suitable
area element dA about the axis of rotation. If the region is bounded by vertical lines
and one or more graphs of the form y D f .x/, the appropriate area element is a
vertical strip of width dx. If the rotation is about the x-axis or any other horizontal
line, this strip generates a disk- or washer-shaped slice of thickness dx. If the rotation
is about the y-axis or any other vertical line, the strip generates a cylindrical shell of
thickness dx. On the other hand, if the region being rotated is bounded by horizontal
lines and one or more graphs of the form x D g.y/, it is easier to use a horizontal
strip of width dy as the area element, and this generates a slice if the rotation is about
a vertical line and a cylindrical shell if the rotation is about a horizontal line. For very
simple regions either method can be made to work easily. See the following table.

More Volumes by Slicing
The method of slicing introduced in Section 7.1 can be used to determine volumes of
solids that are not solids of revolution. All we need to know is the area of cross-section
of the solid in every plane perpendicular to some ﬁxed axis. If that axis is the x-axis,
if the solid lies between the planes at x D a and x D b > a, and if the cross-sectional
area in the plane at x is the continuous (or even piecewise continuous) function A.x/,
then the volume of the solid is
V D

A.x/ dx:
In this section we consider some examples that are not solids of revolution.
Pyramids and cones are solids consisting of all points on line segments that join
a ﬁxed point, the vertex, to all the points in a region lying in a plane not containing the
vertex. The region is called the base of the pyramid or cone. Some pyramids and cones
are shown in Figure 7.15. If the base is bounded by straight lines, the solid is called
a pyramid; if the base has a curved boundary the solid is called a cone. All pyramids
and cones have volume

where A is the area of the base region, and h is the height from the vertex to the plane
of the base, measured in the direction perpendicular to that plane. We will give a very
simple proof of this fact in Section 16.4. For the time being, we verify it for the case
of a rectangular base.

Solution
Cross-sections of the pyramid in planes parallel to the base are similar rect-
angles. If the origin is at the vertex of the pyramid and the x-axis is perpendicular
to the base, then the cross-section at position x is a rectangle whose dimensions are
x=h times the corresponding dimensions of the base. For example, in Figure 7.16(a),
the length LM is x=h times the length PQ, as can be seen from the similar triangles
OLM and OPQ. Thus, the area of the rectangular cross-section at x is

A similar argument, resulting in the same formula for the volume, holds for a cone,
that is, a pyramid with a more general (curved) shape to its base, such as that in
Figure 7.16(b). Although it is not as obvious as in the case of the pyramid, the cross-
section at x still has area .x=h/2 times that of the base. A proof of this volume formula
for an arbitrary cone or pyramid can be found in Example 3 of Section 16.4.

EXAMPLE 3
Two circular cylinders, each having radius a, intersect so that their
axes meet at right angles. Find the volume of the region lying
inside both cylinders.
Solution
We represent the cylinders in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem where the plane containing the x- and y-axes is horizontal and the z-axis is verti-
cal. One-eighth of the solid is represented in Figure 7.18, that part corresponding to all
three coordinates being positive. The two cylinders have axes along the x- and y-axes,
respectively. The cylinder with axis along the x-axis intersects the plane of the y- and
z-axes in a circle of radius a.
Similarly, the other cylinder meets the plane of the x- and z-axes in a circle of
radius a. It follows that if the region lying inside both cylinders (and having x  0,
y  0, and z  0) is sliced horizontally, then the slice at height z above the xy-plane
is a square of side

Arc Length and Surface Area
In this section we consider how integrals can be used to ﬁnd the lengths of curves and
the areas of the surfaces of solids of revolution.
Arc Length
If A and B are two points in the plane, let jABj denote the distance between A and B,
that is, the length of the straight line segment AB.

iD1
jPi1Pij:
Intuition tells us that the shortest curve joining two points is a straight line segment,
so the length Ln of any such polygonal approximation to C cannot exceed the length
of C. If we increase n by adding more vertices to the polygonal line between existing
vertices, Ln cannot get smaller and may increase. If there exists a ﬁnite number K such
that Ln  K for every polygonal approximation to C, then there will be a smallest such
number K (by the completeness of the real numbers), and we call this smallest K the
arc length of C.
DEFINITION
1
The arc length of the curve C from A to B is the smallest real number s such
that the length Ln of every polygonal approximation to C satisﬁes Ln  s.
A curve with a ﬁnite arc length is said to be rectiﬁable. Its arc length s is the limit
of the lengths Ln of polygonal approximations as n ! 1 in such a way that the
maximum segment length jPi1Pij ! 0.
It is possible to construct continuous curves that are bounded (they do not go off
to inﬁnity anywhere) but are not rectiﬁable; they have inﬁnite length. To avoid such
pathological examples, we will assume that our curves are smooth; they will be deﬁned
by functions having continuous derivatives.
The Arc Length of the Graph of a Function
Let f be a function deﬁned on a closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b and having a continuous
derivative f 0 there. If C is the graph of f; that is, the graph of the equation y D f .x/,
then any partition of Œa; b provides a polygonal approximation to C. For the partition

The examples above are deceptively simple; the curves were chosen so that the arc
length integrals could be easily evaluated. For instance, the number 32 in the curve in
Example 2 was chosen so the expression 1 C .dy=dx/2 would turn out to be a perfect
square and its square root would cause no problems. Because of the square root in
the formula, arc length problems for most curves lead to integrals that are difﬁcult or
impossible to evaluate without using numerical techniques.
EXAMPLE 3

metal 2 m wide are to be formed into corrugated rooﬁng panels
2 m wide by bending them into the sinusoidal shape shown in Figure 7.23. The period
of the cross-sectional sine curve is 20 cm. Its amplitude is 5 cm, so the panel is 10 cm
thick. How long should the ﬂat sheets be cut if the resulting panels must be 5 m long?

yield a 5 m long ﬁnished panel.
If integrals needed for standard problems such as arc lengths of simple curves cannot
be evaluated exactly, they are sometimes used to deﬁne new functions whose values are
tabulated or built into computer programs. An example of this is the complete elliptic

Areas of Surfaces of Revolution
When a plane curve is rotated (in three dimensions) about a line in the plane of the
curve, it sweeps out a surface of revolution. For instance, a sphere of radius a is
generated by rotating a semicircle of radius a about the diameter of that semicircle.

SECTION 7.3:
Arc Length and Surface Area
411
The area of a surface of revolution can be found by integrating an area element dS
constructed by rotating the arc length element ds of the curve about the given line. If
the radius of rotation of the element ds is r; then it generates, on rotation, a circular
band of width ds and length (circumference) 2r: The area of this band is, therefore,
dS D 2r ds;
as shown in Figure 7.26. The areas of surfaces of revolution around various lines can
be obtained by integrating dS with appropriate choices of r: Here are some important
special cases:

Remark
Students sometimes wonder whether such complicated formulas are actu-
ally necessary. Why not just use dS D 2jyj dx for the area element when y D
f .x/ is rotated about the x-axis instead of the more complicated area element dS D
2jyj ds? After all, we are regarding dx and ds as both being inﬁnitely small, and we
certainly used dx for the width of the disk-shaped volume element when we rotated
the region under y D f .x/ about the x-axis to generate a solid of revolution. The
reason is somewhat subtle. For small thickness x, the volume of a slice of the solid
of revolution is only approximately y2 x, but the error is small compared to the
volume of this slice. On the other hand, if we use 2jyj x as an approximation to
the area of a thin band of the surface of revolution corresponding to an x interval of
width x, the error is not small compared to the area of that band. If, for instance, the
curve y D f .x/ has slope 1 at x, then the width of the band is really s D
p
2 x,
so that the area of the band is S D 2
p
2jyj x, not just 2jyj x. Always use the
appropriate arc length element along the curve when you rotate a curve to ﬁnd the area
of a surface of revolution.

7.4
Mass, Moments, and Centre of Mass
Many quantities of interest in physics, mechanics, ecology, ﬁnance, and other disci-
plines are described in terms of densities over regions of space, the plane, or even the
real line. To determine the total value of such a quantity we must add up (integrate)
the contributions from the various places where the quantity is distributed.
Mass and Density
If a solid object is made of a homogeneous material, we would expect different parts
of the solid that have the same volume to have the same mass as well. We express
this homogeneity by saying that the object has constant density, that density being
the mass divided by the volume for the whole object or for any part of it. Thus, for
By “density at a point P ” of a
solid object, we mean the limit
.P / of mass/volume for the
part of the solid lying in small
regions containing P (e.g., balls
centred at P ) as the dimensions
of the regions approach zero.
Such a density  is continuous at
P if we can ensure that
j.Q/  .P /j is as small as we
want by taking Q close enough
to P:
example, a rectangular brick with dimensions 20 cm, 10 cm, and 8 cm would have
volume V D 20  10  8 D 1;600 cm3, and if it was made of material having constant
density  D 3 g/cm3, it would have mass m D V D 3  1;600 D 4;800 g. (We will
use the lowercase Greek letter rho () to represent density.)
If the density of the material constituting a solid object is not constant but varies
from point to point in the object, no such simple relationship exists between mass and
volume. If the density  D .P / is a continuous function of position P; we can
subdivide the solid into many small volume elements and, by regarding  as approxi-
mately constant over each such element, determine the masses of all the elements and
add them up to get the mass of the solid. The mass m of a volume element V
containing the point P would satisfy
m  .P / V;

Solution
See Figure 7.29(a). A slice of the solid at height h above the base and

to its surface area times its thickness, and its mass is its volume times its density:

sity, which we will denote by ).

We used the area of a semicircle to evaluate the ﬁrst integral. The second integral is

Distributions of mass along one-dimensional structures (lines or curves) necessarily
lead to integrals of functions of one variable, but distributions of mass on a surface
or in space can lead to integrals involving functions of more than one variable. Such
integrals are studied in multivariable calculus. (See, for example, Section 14.7.) In
the examples above, the given densities were functions of only one variable, so these
problems, although higher dimensional in nature, led to integrals of functions of only
one variable and could be solved by the methods at hand.

Moments and Centres of Mass
The moment about the point x D x0 of a mass m located at position x on the x-axis
is the product m.x  x0/ of the mass and its (signed) distance from x0. If the x-axis
is a horizontal arm hinged at x0, the moment about x0 measures the tendency of the
weight of the mass m to cause the arm to rotate. If several masses m1, m2, m3, : : : ;
mn are located at the points x1, x2, x3, : : : ; xn, respectively, then the total moment
of the system of masses about the point x D x0 is the sum of the individual moments
(see Figure 7.31):

where m is the total mass of the system and MxD0 is the total moment about x D 0.
If you think of the x-axis as being a weightless wire supporting the masses, then Nx is
the point at which the wire could be supported and remain in perfect balance (equi-
librium), not tipping either way. Even if the axis represents a nonweightless support,
say a seesaw, supported at x D Nx, it will remain balanced after the masses are added,
provided it was balanced beforehand. For many purposes a system of masses behaves
as though its total mass were concentrated at its centre of mass.
Now suppose that a one-dimensional distribution of mass with continuously vari-
able line density ı.x/ lies along the interval Œa; b of the x-axis. An element of length
dx at position x contains mass dm D ı.x/ dx, so its moment is dMxD0 D x dm D
xı.x/ dx about x D 0. The total moment about x D 0 is the sum (integral) of these
moment elements:

Two- and Three-Dimensional Examples
The system of mass considered in Example 5 is one-dimensional and lies along a

vail. For a system of masses m1 at .x1; y1/, m2 at .x2; y2/, : : : ; mn at .xn; yn/, the

Remark
Similar formulas can be obtained if the density depends on y instead of
x, provided that the region admits a suitable horizontal area element (e.g., the region
might be speciﬁed by c  y  d, 0  x  g.y/). Finding centres of mass for plates
that occupy regions speciﬁed by functions of x, but where the density depends on y,
generally requires the use of “double integrals.” Such problems are therefore studied
in multivariable calculus. (See Section 14.7.)

Centroids
If matter is distributed uniformly in a system so that the density ı is constant, then that
density cancels out of the numerator and denominator in sum or integral expressions
for coordinates of the centre of mass. In such cases the centre of mass depends only on
the shape of the object, that is, on geometric properties of the region occupied by the
object, and we call it the centroid of the region.
Centroids are calculated using the same formulas as those used for centres of mass,
except that the density (being constant) is taken to be unity, so the mass is just the
length, area, or volume of the region, and the moments are referred to as moments of
the region, rather than of any mass occupying the region. If we set .x/ D 1 in the
formulas obtained in Example 8 of Section 7.4, we obtain the following result:
The centroid of a standard plane region

Thus, for example, Nx is the average value of the function x over the region.
The centroids of some regions are obvious by symmetry. The centroid of a circular
disk or an elliptical disk is at the centre of the disk. The centroid of a rectangle is at
the centre also; the centre is the point of intersection of the diagonals. The centroid of
any region lies on any axes of symmetry of the region.

The centroid of a triangle
The centroid of a triangle is the point at which all three medians of the triangle
intersect.
PROOF
Recall that a median of a triangle is a straight line joining one vertex of the
triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. Given any median of a triangle, we will
show that the centroid lies on that median. Thus, the centroid must lie on all three
medians.

Adopt a coordinate system where the median in question lies along the y-axis and
such that a vertex of the triangle is at the origin. (See Figure 7.37.) Let the midpoint
of the opposite side be .0; m/. Then the other two vertices of the triangle must have
coordinates of the form .a; m  c/ and .a; m C c/ so that .0; m/ will be the midpoint
between them. The two vertical area elements shown in the ﬁgure are at the same
distance on opposite sides of the y-axis, so they have the same heights h.x/ D h.x/

these area elements is

Therefore, the centroid of the triangle lies on the y-axis.
Remark
By simultaneously solving the equations of any two medians of a triangle,
we can verify the following formula:
Coordinates of the centroid of a triangle
The coordinates of the centroid of a triangle are the averages of the corre-
sponding coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle. The triangle with

If a region is a union of nonoverlapping subregions, then any moment of the region
is the sum of the corresponding moments of the subregions. This fact enables us
to calculate the centroid of the region if we know the centroids and areas of all the
subregions.

Pappus’s Theorem
The following theorem relates volumes or surface areas of revolution to the centroid of
the region or curve being rotated.
T H E O R E M
2
Pappus’s Theorem
(a) If a plane region R lies on one side of a line L in that plane and is rotated about
L to generate a solid of revolution, then the volume V of that solid is the product
of the area of R and the distance travelled by the centroid of R under the rotation;
that is,
V D 2 NrA;
where A is the area of R, and Nr is the perpendicular distance from the centroid of
R to L.
(b) If a plane curve C lies on one side of a line L in that plane and is rotated about
that line to generate a surface of revolution, then the area S of that surface is the
length of C times the distance travelled by the centroid of C:
S D 2 Nrs;
where s is the length of the curve C, and Nr is the perpendicular distance from the
centroid of C to the line L.
PROOF
We prove part (a). The proof of (b) is similar and is left as an exercise.
Let us take L to be the y-axis and suppose that R lies between x D a and x D b
where 0  a < b. Thus Nr D Nx, the x-coordinate of the centroid of R. Let dA denote
the area of a thin strip of R at position x and having width dx. (See Figure 7.40.) This
strip generates, on rotation about L, a cylindrical shell of volume dV D 2x dA, so
the volume of the solid of revolution is

Proving Theorem 2(a)
As the following examples illustrate, Pappus’s Theorem can be used in two ways: either
the centroid can be determined when the appropriate volume or surface area is known,
or the volume or surface area can be determined if the centroid of the rotating region
or curve is known.

Use Pappus’s Theorem to ﬁnd the centroid of the semicircle

q
a2  x2.
Solution
The centroid of the semicircle lies on its axis of symmetry, the y-axis, so it
is located at a point with coordinates .0; Ny/. Since the semicircle has length a units
and generates, on rotation about the x-axis, a sphere having area 4a2 square units,
we obtain, using part (b) of Pappus’s Theorem,
4a2 D 2.a/ Ny:
Thus Ny D 2a=, as shown previously in Example 2.

torus (doughnut) obtained by rotating the disk .x b/2 Cy2  a2

Solution
The centroid of the disk is at .b; 0/, which is at distance Nr D b units from
the axis of rotation. Since the disk has area a2 square units, the volume of the torus
is
V D 2b.a2/ D 22a2b cubic units:
To ﬁnd the surface area S of the torus (in case you want to have icing on the doughnut),
rotate the circular boundary of the disk, which has length 2a, about the y-axis and
obtain

M 31. (Stability of a ﬂoating object) Determining the orientation
that a ﬂoating object will assume is a problem of critical
importance to ship designers. Boats must be designed to ﬂoat
stably in an upright position; if the boat tilts somewhat from
upright, the forces on it must be such as to right it again. The
two forces on a ﬂoating object that need to be taken into
account are its weight W and the balancing buoyant force
B D W. The weight W must be treated for mechanical
purposes as being applied at the centre of mass (CM) of the
object. The buoyant force, however, acts at the centre of
buoyancy (CB), which is the centre of mass of the water
displaced by the object, and is therefore the centroid of the
“hole in the water” made by the object.
For example, consider a channel marker buoy consisting
of a hemispherical hull surmounted by a conical tower
supporting a navigation light. The buoy has a vertical axis of
symmetry. If it is upright, both the CM and the CB lie on this
line, as shown in the left half of Figure 7.42.
CB
CM
O
CM
W
B
CB

Figure 7.42
Is this upright ﬂotation of the buoy stable? It is if the CM
lies below the centre O of the hemispherical hull, as shown in
the right half of the ﬁgure. To see why, imagine the buoy tilted
slightly from the vertical as shown in the right half of the
ﬁgure. Observe that the CM still lies on the axis of symmetry
of the buoy, but the CB lies on the vertical line through O. The
forces W and B no longer act along the same line, but their
torques are such as to rotate the buoy back to a vertical upright
position. If CM had been above O in the left ﬁgure, the
torques would have been such as to tip the buoy over once it
was displaced even slightly from the vertical.
A wooden beam has a square cross-section and speciﬁc
gravity 0.5, so that it will ﬂoat with half of its volume
submerged. (See Figure 7.43.) Assuming it will ﬂoat
horizontally in the water, what is the stable orientation of the
square cross-section with respect to the surface of the water?
In particular, will the beam ﬂoat with a ﬂat face upward or an
edge upward? Prove your assertions. You may ﬁnd Maple or
another symbolic algebra program useful.

CHAPTER 7
Applications of Integration
Hydrostatic Pressure
The pressure p at depth h beneath the surface of a liquid is the force per unit area
exerted on a horizontal plane surface at that depth due to the weight of the liquid above
it. Hence, p is given by
p D gh;
where  is the density of the liquid, and g is the acceleration produced by gravity where
the ﬂuid is located. (See Figure 7.44.) For water at the surface of the earth we have,
approximately,  D 1;000 kg/m3 and g D 9:8 m/s2, so the pressure at depth h m is
p D 9;800h N/m2:
The unit of force used here is the newton (N); 1 N = 1 kgm/s2, the force that imparts
an acceleration of 1 m/s2 to a mass of 1 kg.
A
h
Figure 7.44
The volume of liquid above
the area A is V D Ah. The weight of this
liquid is Vg D ghA, so the pressure
(force per unit area) at depth h is p D gh
The molecules in a liquid interact in such a way that the pressure at any depth
acts equally in all directions; the pressure against a vertical surface is the same as that
against a horizontal surface at the same depth. This is Pascal’s principle.
The total force exerted by a liquid on a horizontal surface (say, the bottom of a
tank holding the liquid) is found by multiplying the area of that surface by the pressure
at the depth of the surface below the top of the liquid. For nonhorizontal surfaces,
however, the pressure is not constant over the whole surface, and the total force cannot
be determined so easily. In this case we divide the surface into area elements dA, each
at some particular depth h, and we then sum (i.e., integrate) the corresponding force
elements dF D gh dA to ﬁnd the total force.
EXAMPLE 1
One vertical wall of a water trough is a semicircular plate of radius
R m with curved edge downward. If the trough is full, so that the
water comes up to the top of the plate, ﬁnd the total force of the water on the plate.

A horizontal strip of the surface of the plate at depth h m and having
width dh m (see Figure 7.45) has length 2

Work
When a force acts on an object to move that object, it is said to have done work on the
object. The amount of work done by a constant force is measured by the product of the
force and the distance through which it moves the object. This assumes that the force
is in the direction of the motion.
work D force  distance
Work is always related to a particular force. If other forces acting on an object cause
it to move in a direction opposite to the force F; then work is said to have been done
against the force F:
Suppose that a force in the direction of the x-axis moves an object from x D a
to x D b on that axis and that the force varies continuously with the position x of
the object; that is, F D F.x/ is a continuous function. The element of work done
by the force in moving the object through a very short distance from x to x C dx is

By Hooke’s Law, the
force F.x/ required to extend (or compress) an elastic spring to
x units longer (or shorter) than its natural length is proportional to x:
F.x/ D kx;
where k is the spring constant for the particular spring. If a force of 2,000 N is
required to extend a certain spring to 4 cm longer than its natural length, how much
work must be done to extend it that far?
Solution
Since F.x/ D kx D 2;000 N when x D 4 cm, we must have

One end of a horizontal tank with cross-section a square of edge
length L metres is ﬁxed while the other end is a square piston free
to travel without friction along the length of the tank. Between the piston and the ﬁxed

(See Figure 7.48.)

CHAPTER 7
Applications of Integration
Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy
The units of energy are the same as those of work (force  distance). Work done
against a force may be regarded as storing up energy for future use or for conversion
to other forms. Such stored energy is called potential energy (P.E.). For instance,
in extending or compressing an elastic spring, we are doing work against the tension
in the spring and hence storing energy in the spring. When work is done against a
(variable) force F.x/ to move an object from x D a to x D b, the energy stored is
P.E. D 
Z b
a
F.x/ dx:
Since the work is being done against F; the signs of F.x/ and b  a are opposite,
so the integral is negative; the explicit negative sign is included so that the calculated
potential energy will be positive.
One of the forms of energy into which potential energy can be converted is kinetic
energy (K.E.), the energy of motion. If an object of mass m is moving with velocity
v, it has kinetic energy
K.E. D 1
2 m v2:
For example, if an object is raised and then dropped, it accelerates downward under
gravity as more and more of the potential energy stored in it when it was raised is
converted to kinetic energy.
Consider the change in potential energy stored in a mass m as it moves along the
x-axis from a to b under the inﬂuence of a force F.x/ depending only on x:

(The change in P.E. is negative if m is moving in the direction of F:) According to

with acceleration dv=dt given by
F.x/ D mdv

By the Chain Rule we can rewrite dv=dt in the form

This shows that the total energy (potential + kinetic) remains constant as the mass m
moves under the inﬂuence of a force F; depending only on position. Such a force is
said to be conservative, and the above result is called the Law of Conservation of
Energy. Conservative forces will be further discussed in Section 15.2.

EXAMPLE 7
(Escape velocity) Use the result of Example 5 together with the
following known values,
(a) the radius R of the earth is about 6;400 km, or 6:4  106 m,
(b) the acceleration of gravity g at the surface of the earth is about 9:8 m/s2,
to determine the constant K in the gravitational force formula of Example 5, and use
this information to determine the escape velocity for a projectile ﬁred vertically from
the surface of the earth. The escape velocity is the (minimum) speed that such a
projectile must have at ﬁring to ensure that it will continue to move farther and farther
away from the earth and not fall back.
Solution
According to the formula of Example 5, the force of gravity on a mass
m kg at the surface of the earth .h D 0/ is

According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, this force is related to the acceleration

and
K D gR2:
According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, the projectile must have sufﬁcient
kinetic energy at ﬁring to do the work necessary to raise the mass m to inﬁnite height.
By the result of Example 5, this required energy is Km=R. If the initial velocity of the
projectile is v, we want

Thus, the escape velocity is approximately 11.2 km/s and is independent of the mass
m. In this calculation we have neglected any air resistance near the surface of the earth.
Such resistance depends on velocity rather than on position, so it is not a conservative
force. The effect of such resistance would be to use up (convert to heat) some of the
initial kinetic energy and so raise the escape velocity.

The Present Value of a Stream of Payments
Suppose that you have a business that generates income continuously at a variable rate
P.t/ dollars per year at time t and that you expect this income to continue for the next
T years. How much is the business worth today?
The answer surely depends on interest rates. One dollar to be received t years from
now is worth less than one dollar received today, which could be invested at interest to
yield more than one dollar t years from now. The higher the interest rate, the lower the
value today of a payment that is not due until sometime in the future.
To analyze this situation, suppose that the nominal interest rate is r% per annum,
but is compounded continuously. Let ı D r=100. As shown in Section 3.4, an invest-
ment of $1 today will grow to
lim
n!1

1 C ı

dollars
after t years. Therefore, a payment of $1 after t years must be worth only $eıt today.
This is called the present value of the future payment. When viewed this way, the
interest rate ı is frequently called a discount rate; it represents the amount by which
future payments are discounted.
Returning to the business income problem, in the short time interval from t to t C
dt, the business produces income $P.t/ dt, of which the present value is $eıtP.t/ dt.
Therefore, the present value $V of the income stream over the time interval Œ0; T  is

Here, x D x.t/ is the size (or biomass) of the population at time t, k is the natural
rate at which the population would grow if its food supply were unlimited, and L is the
natural limiting size of the population—the carrying capacity of its environment. Such
models are thought to apply, for example, to the Antarctic blue whale and to several
species of ﬁsh and trees. If the resource is harvested (say, the ﬁsh are caught) at a rate
h.t/ units per year at time t, then the population grows at a slower rate:

In particular, if we harvest the population at its current rate of growth,

then dx=dt D 0, and the population will maintain a constant size. Assume that each
unit of harvest produces an income of $p for the ﬁshing industry. The total annual
income from harvesting the resource at its current rate of growth will be
T D ph.t/ D pkx

:
Considered as a function of x, this total annual income is quadratic and has a maximum
value when x D L=2, the value that ensures dT=dx D 0. The industry can maintain
a stable maximum annual income by ensuring that the population level remains at half
the maximal size of the population with no harvesting.
The analysis above, however, does not take into account the discounted value of fu-
ture harvests. If the discount rate is ı, compounded continuously, then the present value
of the income $ph.t/ dt due between t and t C dt years from now is eıtph.t/ dt.

will be the income-maximizing population level. More unfortunately, if ı  k, the

Of course, this model fails to take into consideration other factors that may affect

Nevertheless, it does explain the regrettable fact that, under some circumstances, an
industry based on a renewable resource can ﬁnd it in its best interest to destroy the
resource. This is especially likely to happen when the natural growth rate k of the
resource is low, as it is for the case of whales and most trees. There is good reason not
to allow economics alone to dictate the management of the resource.

17. (Managing a ﬁshery) The carrying capacity of a certain lake
is L D 80;000 of a certain species of ﬁsh. The natural growth
rate of this species is 12% per year (k D 0:12). Each ﬁsh is
worth $6. The discount rate is 5%. What population of ﬁsh
should be maintained in the lake to maximize the present
value of all future revenue from harvesting the ﬁsh? What is
the annual revenue resulting from maintaining this population
level?
18. (Blue whales) It is speculated that the natural growth rate of
the Antarctic blue whale population is about 2% per year
(k D 0:02) and that the carrying capacity of its habitat is
about L D 150;000. One blue whale is worth, on average,
$10,000. Assuming that the blue whale population satisﬁes a
logistic model, and using the data above, ﬁnd the following:
(a) The maximum sustainable annual harvest of blue whales.
(b) The annual revenue resulting from the maximum annual
sustainable harvest.
(c) The annual interest generated if the whale population
(assumed to be at the level L=2 supporting the maximum
sustainable harvest) is exterminated and the proceeds
invested at 2%.
(d) at 5%.
(e) The total present value of all future revenue if the
population is maintained at the level L=2 and the discount
rate is 5%.

The model developed above does not allow for the costs of
harvesting. Try to devise a way to alter the model to take this
into account. Typically, the cost of catching a ﬁsh goes up as
the number of ﬁsh goes down.

Probability
Probability theory is a very important ﬁeld of application of calculus. This subject
cannot, of course, be developed thoroughly here—an adequate presentation requires
one or more whole courses—but we can give a brief introduction that suggests some
of the ways sums and integrals are used in probability theory.
In the context of probability theory the term experiment is used to denote a pro-
cess that can result in different outcomes. A particular outcome is also called a real-
ization. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space for the experiment.
For example, the process might be the tossing of a coin for which we could have three
possible outcomes: H (the coin lands horizontal with “heads” showing on top), T (the
coin lands horizontal with “tails” showing on top), or E (the coin lands and remains
standing on its edge). Of course, outcome E is not very likely unless the coin is quite
thick, but it can happen. So our sample space is S D fH; T; Eg. Suppose we were
to toss the coin a great many times, and observe that the outcomes H and T each oc-
cur on 49% of the tosses while E occurs only 2% of the time. We would say that on
any one toss of the coin the outcomes H and T each have probability 0.49 and E has
probability 0.02.
An event is any subset of the sample space. The probability of an event is a
real number between 0 and 1 that measures the proportion of times the outcome of
the experiment can be expected to belong to that event if the experiment is repeated
many times. If the event is the whole sample space, its occurrence is certain, and its
probability is 1; if the event is the empty set ; D f g, it cannot possibly occur, and its
probability is 0. For the coin-tossing experiment, there are eight possible events; we
record their probabilities as follows:
Pr.;/ D 0;
Pr.fHg/ D 0:49;
Pr.fT g/ D 0:49;
Pr.fEg/ D 0:02;
Pr.fH; T g/ D 0:98;
Pr.fH; Eg/ D 0:51;
Pr.fT; Eg/ D 0:51;
Pr.S/ D 1:
Given any two events A and B (subsets of sample space S), their intersection
A \ B consists of those outcomes belonging to both A and B; it is sometimes called
the event “A and B.” Two events are disjoint if A \ B D ;; no outcome can belong
to two disjoint events. For instance, an event A and its complement, Ac, consisting of
all outcomes in S that don’t belong to A, are disjoint. The union of two events A and
B (also called the event “A or B”) consists of all outcomes that belong to at least one
of A and B. Note that A [ Ac D S.

SECTION 7.8:
Probability
437
We summarize the basic rules governing probability as follows: if S is a sample
space, ; is the empty subset of S, and A and B are any events, then
(a)
0  Pr.A/  1;
(b)
Pr.;/ D 0
and
Pr.S/ D 1;
(c)
Pr.Ac/ D 1  Pr.A/;
(d)
Pr.A [ B/ D Pr.A/ C Pr.B/  Pr.A \ B/:
Note that just adding Pr.A/ C Pr.B/ would count outcomes in A \ B twice. As
an example, in our coin-tossing experiment if A D fH; T g and B D fH; Eg, then
Ac D fEg, A [ B D fH; T; Eg D S, and A \ B D fHg. We have
Pr.Ac/ D Pr.fEg/ D 0:02 D 1  0:98 D 1  Pr.fH; T g/ D 1  Pr.A/
Pr.A [ B/ D Pr.S/ D 1 D 0:51 C 0:51  0:02 D Pr.A/ C Pr.B/  Pr.A \ B/:
Remark
The generality of these rules of probability can be misleading. Probability
only has meaning in terms of a given sample space or measure. In popular culture
probability is sometimes cited in the absence of a sample space at all. Probability
theory also has infamous paradoxes and jokes that arise from attempting to compute
probabilities across more than one sample space or computing them inadvertently from
a different sample space than a user had in mind. Misunderstandings do arise in an
overlooked shift in a question about a probability, implying an unnoticed change in the
sample space, or lack of precision about what the sample space actually is. Infamous
disputes about the “correct” probability have arisen as a result. These are beyond the
scope of this section.
Discrete Random Variables
A random variable is a function deﬁned on a sample space. We will denote random
variables by using uppercase letters such as X and Y: If the sample space contains only
discrete outcomes (like the sample space for the coin-tossing experiment), a random
variable on it will have only discrete values and will be called a discrete random
variable. If, on the other hand, the sample space contains all possible measurements
of, say, heights of trees, then a random variable equal to that measurement can itself
take on a continuum of real values and will be called a continuous random variable.
We will study both types in this section.
Most discrete random variables have only ﬁnitely many values, but some can
have inﬁnitely many values if, say, the sample space consisted of the positive integers
f1; 2; 3; : : :g. A discrete random variable X has an associated probability function
f deﬁned on the range of X by f .x/ D Pr.X D x/ for each possible value x of X.
Typically, f is represented by a bar graph; the sum of the heights of all the bars must
be 1,
X
x
f .x/ D
X
x
Pr.X D x/ D 1;
since it is certain that the experiment must produce an outcome, and therefore a value
of X.
EXAMPLE 1
A single fair die is rolled so that it will show one of the numbers
1 to 6 on top when it stops. If X denotes the number showing on
any roll, then X is a discrete random variable with 6 possible values. Since the die is
fair, no one value of X is any more likely than any other, so the probability that the
number showing is n must be 1/6 for each possible value of n. If f is the probability
function of X, then
f .n/ D Pr.X D n/ D 1
6
for each n in f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g:

438
CHAPTER 7
Applications of Integration
The discrete random variable X is therefore said to be distributed uniformly. All the
bars in the graph of its probability function f have the same height. (See Figure 7.52.)

What is the sample space for the numbers showing on top when
two fair dice are rolled? What is the probability that a 4 and a 2
will be showing? Find the probability function for the random variable X that gives
the sum of the two numbers showing on the dice. What is the probability that that sum
is less than 10?
Solution
The sample space consists of all pairs of integers .m; n/ satisfying 1 
m  6 and 1  n  6. There are 36 such pairs, so the probability of any one of them
is 1/36. Two of the pairs, .4; 2/ and .2; 4/, correspond to a 4 and a 2 showing, so the
probability of that event is .1=36/ C .1=36/ D 1=18. The random variable X deﬁned
by X.m; n/ D m C n has 11 possible values, the integers from 2 to 12 inclusive. The
following table lists the pairs that produce each value k of X and the probability f .k/
of that value, that is, the value of the probability function at k:

Expectation, Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation
Consider a simple gambling game in which the player pays the house C dollars for the
privilege of rolling a single die and in which he wins X dollars, where X is the number
showing on top of the rolled die. In each game the possible winnings are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

or 6 dollars, each with probability 1/6. In n games the player can expect to win about
n=6 C 2n=6 C 3n=6 C 4n=6 C 5n=6 C 6n=6 D 21n=6 D 7n=2 dollars, so that his
expected average winnings per game are 7/2 dollars, that is, $3.50. If C > 3:5, the
player can expect, on average, to lose money. The amount 3.5 is called the expectation,
or mean, of the discrete random variable X. The mean is usually denoted by , the
Greek letter “mu” (pronounced “mew”).
DEFINITION
2
Mean or expectation
If X is a discrete random variable with range of values R and probability
function f; then the mean (denoted ), or expectation of X (denoted E.X/),
is
 D E.X/ D
X
x2R
x f .x/:
Also, the expectation of any function g.X/ of the random variable X is
E.g.X// D
X
x2R
g.x/ f .x/:
Note that in this usage E.X/ does not deﬁne a function of X but a constant (parameter)
associated with the random variable X. Note also that if f .x/ were a mass density such
as that studied in Section 7.4, then  would be the moment of the mass about 0 and,
since the total mass would be P
x2R f .x/ D 1,  would in fact be the centre of mass.
Another parameter used to describe the way probability is distributed for a random
variable is the variable’s standard deviation.
DEFINITION
3
Variance and standard deviation
The variance of a random variable X with range R and probability function
f is the expectation of the square of the distance of X from its mean . The
variance is denoted 	2 or Var(X).

Continuous Random Variables
Now we consider an example with a continuous range of possible outcomes.
EXAMPLE 4
Suppose that a needle is dropped at random on a ﬂat table with
a straight line drawn on it. For each drop, let X be the acute an-
gle, measured in degrees, that the needle makes with the line. (See Figure 7.56(a).)
Evidently, X can take any real value in the interval Œ0; 90; therefore, X is called a
continuous random variable. The probability that X takes on any particular real
value is 0. (There are inﬁnitely many real numbers in Œ0; 90, and none is more likely
than any other.) However, the probability that X lies in some interval, say Œ10; 20, is
the same as the probability that it lies in any other interval of the same length. Since
the interval has length 10 and the interval of all possible values of X has length 90,
this probability is
Pr.10  X  20/ D 10
90 D 1
9:
More generally, if 0  x1  x2  90, then
Pr.x1  X  x2/ D 1
90.x2  x1/:
This situation can be conveniently represented as follows: Let f .x/ be deﬁned on the
interval Œ0; 90, taking at each point the constant value 1/90:
f .x/ D 1
90;
0  x  90:
The area under the graph of f is 1, and Pr.x1  X  x2/ is equal to the area under that
part of the graph lying over the interval Œx1; x2. (See Figure 7.56(b).) The function
f .x/ is called the probability density function for the random variable X. Since
f .x/ is constant on its domain, X is said to be uniformly distributed.

Probability density functions

which is the area above the interval Œx1; x2 and under the graph of f , pro-

satisfy two conditions:
Note that this deﬁnition of
probability density function
generalizes the probability
function used in the discrete case
if we regard the bar graphs there
as the graphs of step functions
with unit base lengths.

These ideas extend to random variables distributed on semi-inﬁnite or inﬁnite intervals,
but the integrals appearing will be improper in those cases. In any event, the role
played by sums in the analysis of discrete random variables is taken over by integrals
for continuous random variables.
In the example of the dropping needle, the probability density function has a hor-
izontal straight line graph, and we termed such a probability distribution uniform. The
uniform probability density function on the interval Œa; b is

Many other functions are commonly encountered as density functions for continuous

EXAMPLE 5
(The exponential distribution) The length of time T that any
particular atom in a radioactive sample survives before decaying
is a random variable taking values in Œ0; 1/. It has been observed that the proportion
of atoms that survive to time t becomes small exponentially as t increases; thus,

Let f be the probability density function for the random variable T: Then

By analogy with the discrete case, we formulate deﬁnitions for the mean (or expec-
tation), variance, and standard deviation of a continuous random variable as follows:

and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
As was the case for a discrete random variable, it is easily shown that
2 D E.X2/  2;

Again the standard deviation gives a measure of how spread out the probability distri-
bution of X is. The smaller the standard deviation, the more concentrated is the area
under the density curve around the mean, and so the smaller is the probability that a
value of X will be far away from the mean. (See Figure 7.57.)

The Normal Distribution
The most important probability distributions are the so-called normal or Gaussian
distributions. Such distributions govern the behaviour of many interesting random
variables, in particular, those associated with random errors in measurements. There
is a family of normal distributions, all related to the particular normal distribution
called the standard normal distribution, which has the following probability density
function:

It is common to use z to denote the random variable in the standard normal distribution;
the other normal distributions are obtained from this one by a change of variable. The
graph of the standard normal density has a pleasant bell shape, as shown in Figure 7.59.
As we have noted previously, the function ez2 has no elementary antiderivative,

Heavy Tails
With continuous random variables over an inﬁnite domain, complications of improper
integrals arise for certain established probability density functions that do not satisfy
the conditions needed for the normal distribution to hold. For an important class of
these functions the integrals for the mean or variance do not exist.
For example,
a common nonnormal probability density function arising in physics is the Cauchy
distribution:
DEFINITION
8
The Cauchy probability density
C.x/ D 1

 
.x  /2 C  2
 1 < x < 1:
Here the constants  and  play roles similar to those of the mean and standard devia-
tion in the normal distribution. The graph of C.x/ is symmetric about the line x D ,
and  is a measure of the width of the single peak. However,  is not really a mean and
 is certainly not a standard deviation, as neither
R 1
1 xC.x/ dx nor
R 1
1 x2C.x/ dx
is a convergent improper integral. The Cauchy density function is known in spectro-
scopy as the Lorentz proﬁle for spectral lines, while in nuclear physics it is known as
the probability density function of the Breit-Wigner distribution.

Figure 7.62 shows the graphs of the standard Normal density and the Cauchy density

2=, the latter value being chosen so that both curves would
peak at the same height. Observe the tails of these curves (i.e., the parts where jxj > 2,
say). While the normal curve is higher than the Cauchy one for small jxj, the expo-
nential factor in the normal density decreases very rapidly for large jxj; it is O.jxjn/
for every positive integer n as jxj ! 1 while the Cauchy density is only O.jxj2/.
Because of this polynomial asymptotic behaviour as jxj ! 1, the Cauchy density is
said to have fat tails or heavy tails.
To understand the signiﬁcance of this, we use
direct integration to ﬁnd the tail probability from some x to inﬁnity for the Cauchy
distribution,
Pr.X > x/ D 1
2  1
 tan1 x;
and divide it by the corresponding tail probability, Pr.X > x/ D 1  F.x/, for the
standard normal distribution. This ratio is plotted in Figure 7.63 for 1  x  8. From
about x D 7 on, the ratio grows extremely rapidly! This ratio shows that the amount
of probability in the tail of C.x/ is very “heavy” relative to the normal.

C.x/ is far from the only heavy-tailed probability density function. One important
class of heavy-tailed probability distributions are the Lévy stable distributions with
densities S˛.x/ for 0 < ˛  2. Except for ˛ D 1 (the Cauchy case) and ˛ D 2 (the
normal case), the densities S˛.x/ are not elementary functions, and providing exact
descriptions of them is beyond the scope of this section. They can be represented
explicitly as integral transforms (see Section 18.7), but must be computed numerically
to get speciﬁc values, as is the case for any other nonalgebraic function. The graphs
of the symmetric versions of S˛.x/ are similar to those of the normal and Cauchy
densities. The deﬁnitive differences are found in the speciﬁcs of the tail behaviours,
which are discussed in Exercises 23–24.
Remark
Poincaré’s telling remark, in the quotations at the beginning of this chapter,
humorously warns us that a presumption of normality is common. However, in the
standard physics examples given, normality does not hold. C.x/ arises theoretically in
them. Without a theoretical basis, any presumption of normality can only be conﬁrmed
with data alone. But the tail represents the least probable events, so tail data are least
likely to be observed over any ﬁnite time. Thus, the greatest deviations from normal
distributions are the least likely to be observed, making empirical demonstrations of
heavy tails difﬁcult.
Remark
Suppose that, because of a naïve expectation of the universality of normal
distributions, we mistakenly assume that the outcomes of a heavy tail process are dis-
tributed normally. Since the largest disagreement between the supposed and actual
distributions only occur for the rarest of events, ﬁnite samples of outcomes will not
likely expose our error; the samples won’t have any outcomes from far out in the tail.
But, being the most extreme, the rarest of events can also be the most consequen-
tial. The sharp growth of the ratio in Figure 7.63 shows that the probability of such

SECTION 7.8:
Probability
449
events can be seriously underestimated in this circumstance. People adhering to the
assumption of normality can thus experience costly surprises. A surprise of this type
is named a Black Swan by Nassim Taleb, who authored a well-known book on this
topic, entitled The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.
Remark
Measured data from a continuous process are always ﬁnite in number and
discretely sampled. While the mean and variance may not exist for a continuous heavy
tail process, they will, nonetheless, always exist for ﬁnite data. Thus statistical uncer-
tainty based on normality may be moot. Caution should be taken for questions that
depend heavily on normality.

First-Order Differential Equations
This ﬁnal section on applications of integration concentrates on application of the in-
deﬁnite integral rather than of the deﬁnite integral. We can use the techniques of
integration developed in Chapters 5 and 6 to solve certain kinds of ﬁrst-order differ-
ential equations that arise in a variety of modelling situations. We have already seen
some examples of applications of differential equations to modelling growth and decay
phenomena in Section 3.4.
Separable Equations
Consider the logistic equation introduced in Section 3.4 to model the growth of an
animal population with a limited food supply:
dy
dt D ky

1  y
L

;
where y.t/ is the size of the population at time t, k is a positive constant related to
the fertility of the population, and L is the steady-state population size that can be
sustained by the available food supply. This equation has two particular solutions,
y D 0 and y D L, that are constant functions of time.
The logistic equation is an example of a class of ﬁrst-order differential equations
called separable equations because when they are written in terms of differentials,
they can be separated with only the dependent variable on one side of the equation and
only the independent variable on the other. The logistic equation can be written in the
form
L dy

(A solution concentration problem)
Initially a tank contains
1,000 L of brine with 50 kg of dissolved salt. Brine containing
10 g of salt per litre is ﬂowing into the tank at a constant rate of 10 L/min. If the con-
tents of the tank are kept thoroughly mixed at all times, and if the solution also ﬂows
out at 10 L/min, how much salt remains in the tank at the end of 40 min?
Solution
Let x.t/ be the number of kilograms of salt in solution in the tank after
t min. Thus, x.0/ D 50. Salt is coming into the tank at a rate of 10 g/L  10 L/min
= 100 g/min = 1/10 kg/min. At all times the tank contains 1,000 L of liquid, so the
concentration of salt in the tank at time t is x=1;000 kg/L. Since the contents ﬂow out
at 10 L/min, salt is being removed at a rate of 10x=1;000 D x=100 kg/min. Therefore,

Although x.t/ D 10 is a constant solution of the differential equation, it does not

Integrating both sides of this equation, we obtain
 ln j10  xj D

100 C C:
Observe that x.t/ ¤ 10 for any ﬁnite time t (since ln 0 is not deﬁned). Since x.0/ D
50 > 10, it follows that x.t/ > 10 for all t > 0. (x.t/ is necessarily continuous,
so it cannot take any value less than 10 without somewhere taking the value 10 by
the Intermediate-Value Theorem.) Hence, we can drop the absolute value from the
solution above and obtain
ln.x  10/ D  t

Since x.0/ D 50, we have C D ln 40 and

EXAMPLE 5
(A rate of reaction problem) In a chemical reaction that goes to
completion in solution, one molecule of each of two reactants, A
and B, combine to form each molecule of the product C: According to the law of mass
action, the reaction proceeds at a rate proportional to the product of the concentrations
of A and B in the solution. Thus, if there were initially present a > 0 molecules/cm3
of A and b > 0 molecules/cm3 of B; then the number x.t/ of molecules/cm3 of C
present at time t thereafter is determined by the differential equation

First-Order Linear Equations
A ﬁrst-order linear differential equation is one of the type
dy
dx C p.x/y D q.x/;
./
where p.x/ and q.x/ are given functions, which we assume to be continuous. The
equation is called nonhomogeneous unless q.x/ is identically zero. The correspond-
ing homogeneous equation,
dy

is separable and so is easily solved to give y D K e.x/, where K is any constant and
.x/ is any antiderivative of p.x/:

Both methods really amount to the same calculations expressed in different

(An inductance-resistance circuit)
An electric circuit (see
Figure 7.67) contains a constant DC voltage source of V volts, a
switch, a resistor of size R ohms, and an inductor of size L henrys. The circuit has no
capacitance. The switch, initially open so that no current is ﬂowing, is closed at time
t D 0 so that current begins to ﬂow at that time. If the inductance L were zero, the
current would suddenly jump from 0 amperes when t < 0 to I D V=R amperes when
t > 0. However, if L > 0 the current cannot change instantaneously; it will depend
on time t. Let the current t seconds after the switch is closed be I.t/ amperes. It is
known that I.t/ satisﬁes the initial-value problem

Our ﬁnal example reviews a typical stream of payments problem of the sort consid-
ered in Section 7.7. This time we treat the problem as an initial-value problem for a
differential equation.
EXAMPLE 10
A savings account is opened with a deposit of A dollars. At any
time t years thereafter, money is being continually deposited into
the account at a rate of .C C Dt/ dollars per year. If interest is also being paid into
the account at a nominal rate of 100R percent per year, compounded continuously, ﬁnd
the balance B.t/ dollars in the account after t years. Illustrate the solution for the data
A D 5;000, C D 1;000, D D 200, R D 0:13, and t D 5.
Solution
As noted in Section 3.4, continuous compounding of interest at a nominal
rate of 100R percent causes $1.00 to grow to eRt dollars in t years. Without subsequent
deposits, the balance in the account would grow according to the differential equation
of exponential growth:

Allowing for additional growth due to the continual deposits, we observe that B must
satisfy the differential equation

2. (Conservation of earth) A landscaper wants to create on level
ground a ring-shaped pool having an outside radius of 10 m and
a maximum depth of 1 m surrounding a hill that will be built up
using all the earth excavated from the pool. (See Figure 7.71.)
She decides to use a fourth-degree polynomial to determine the
cross-sectional shape of the hill and pool bottom: at distance r
metres from the centre of the development the height above or
below normal ground level will be
h.r/ D a.r2  100/.r2  k2/ metres;
for some a > 0, where k is the inner radius of the pool. Find
k and a so that the requirements given above are all satisﬁed.

3. (Rocket design) The nose of a rocket is a solid of revolution
of base radius r and height h that must join smoothly to the
cylindrical body of the rocket. (See Figure 7.72.) Taking the
origin at the tip of the nose and the x-axis along the central axis
of the rocket, various nose shapes can be obtained by revolving
the cubic curve
y D f .x/ D ax C bx2 C cx3
about the x-axis. The cubic curve must have slope 0 at x D
h, and its slope must be positive for 0 < x < h. Find the
particular cubic curve that maximizes the volume of the nose.
Also show that this choice of the cubic makes the slope dy=dx
at the origin as large as possible and, hence, corresponds to the
bluntest nose.

He wanted a simple formula for the surface area so that he

exact formula for the area of a general ellipsoid in terms of ele-
mentary functions. However, there are such formulas for ellip-
soids of revolution, where two of the three semi-axes are equal.
These ellipsoids are called spheroids; an oblate spheroid (like
the earth) has its two longer semi-axes equal; a prolate spheroid
(like an American football) has its two shorter semi-axes equal.
A reasonable approximation to the area of a general ellipsoid
can be obtained by linear interpolation between these two.

Everyone knows what a curve is, until he has studied enough math-
ematics to become confused through the countless number of possible

Introduction
Until now, most curves we have encountered have been
graphs of functions, and they provided useful visual in-
formation about the behaviour of the functions. In this chapter we begin to look at
plane curves as interesting objects in their own right. First, we examine conic sections,
curves with quadratic equations obtained by intersecting a plane with a right-circular
cone. Then we consider curves that can be described by two parametric equations that
give the coordinates of points on the curve as functions of a parameter. If this para-
meter is time, the equations describe the path of a moving point in the plane. Finally,
we consider curves described by equations in a new coordinate system called polar
coordinates, in which a point is located by giving its distance and direction from the
origin. In Chapter 11 we will expand our study of curves to three dimensions.
8.1
Conics
Circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas are called conic sections (or, more simply,
just conics) because they are curves in which planes intersect right-circular cones.
To be speciﬁc, suppose that a line A is ﬁxed in space, and V is a point ﬁxed
on A. The right-circular cone having axis A, vertex V; and semi-vertical angle ˛
is the surface consisting of all points on straight lines through V that make angle ˛
with the line A. (See Figure 8.1.) The cone has two halves (called nappes) lying on
opposite sides of the vertex V: Any plane P that does not pass through V will intersect
the cone (one or both nappes) in a curve C. (See Figure 8.2.) If a line normal (i.e.,
perpendicular) to P makes angle  with the axis A of the cone, where 0    =2,
then

In Sections 10.4 and 10.5 it is shown that planes are represented by ﬁrst-degree equa-
tions and cones by second-degree equations. Therefore, all conics can be represented
analytically (in terms of Cartesian coordinates x and y in the plane of the conic) by a
second-degree equation of the general form
Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 C Dx C Ey C F D 0;
where A; B; : : : ; F are constants. However, such an equation can also represent the
empty set, a single point, or one or two straight lines if the left-hand side factors into
linear factors:
.A1x C B1y C C1/.A2x C B2y C C2/ D 0:
After straight lines, the conic sections are the simplest of plane curves. They have
many properties that make them useful in applications of mathematics; that is why we
include a discussion of them here. Much of this material is optional from the point
of view of a calculus course, but familiarity with the properties of conics can be very
important in some applications. Most of the properties of conics were discovered by
the Greek geometer Apollonius of Perga, around 200 BC. It is remarkable that he was
able to obtain these properties using only the techniques of classical Euclidean geom-
etry; today, most of these properties are expressed more conveniently using analytic
geometry and speciﬁc coordinate systems.
Parabolas
DEFINITION
1
Parabolas
A parabola consists of points in the plane that are equidistant from a given
point (the focus of the parabola) and a given straight line (the directrix of the
parabola). The line through the focus perpendicular to the directrix is called
the principal axis (or simply the axis) of the parabola. The vertex of the
parabola is the point where the parabola crosses its principal axis. It is on the
axis halfway between the focus and the directrix.
EXAMPLE 1
Find an equation of the parabola whose focus is the point F D
.a; 0/ and whose directrix is the line L with equation x D a.

CHAPTER 8

Solution
The parabola has axis along the x-axis and vertex at the origin.
(See
Figure 8.3.) If P D .x; y/ is any point on the parabola, then the distance from P
to F is equal to the distance from P to the nearest point Q on L. Thus,

The Focal Property of a Parabola
All of the conic sections have interesting and useful focal properties relating to the way
in which surfaces of revolution they generate reﬂect light if the surfaces are mirrors.
For instance, a circle will clearly reﬂect back along the same path any ray of light
incident along a line passing through its centre. The focal properties of parabolas,
ellipses, and hyperbolas can be derived from the reﬂecting property of a straight line
(i.e., a plane mirror) by elementary geometrical arguments.
Light travels in straight lines in a medium of constant optical density (one where
the speed of light is constant). This is a consequence of the physical Principle of
Least Action, which asserts that in travelling between two points, light takes the path
requiring the minimum travel time. Given a straight line L in a plane and two points
A and B in the plane on the same side of L, the point P on L for which the sum of
the distances AP C PB is minimum is such that AP and PB make equal angles with
L, or equivalently, with the normal to L at P: (See Figure 8.4.) If B0 is the point such
that L is the right bisector of the line segment BB0, then P is the intersection of L and
AB0. Since one side of a triangle cannot exceed the sum of the other two sides,
AP C PB D AP C PB0 D AB0  AQ C QB0 D AQ C QB:

Now consider a parabola with focus F and directrix D: Let P be on the parabola

on T: Then FQ meets the parabola at a point X between F and Q. Let M and N be
points on D such that MX and NP are perpendicular to D; and let A be a point on
the line through N and P that lies on the same side of the parabola as F: We have

Thus, among all points Q on the line T; Q D P is the one that minimizes the sum
of distances FQ C QA. By the observation made for straight lines above, FP and
PA make equal angles with T and so also with the normal to the parabola at P: (The
parabola and the tangent line have the same normal at P:)
Reﬂection by a parabola
Any ray from the focus will be reﬂected parallel to the axis of the parabola.
Equivalently, any incident ray parallel to the axis of the parabola will be re-
ﬂected through the focus.
Ellipses
DEFINITION
2
Ellipses
An ellipse consists of all points in the plane, the sum of whose distances from
two ﬁxed points (the foci) is constant.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the ellipse with foci at the points .c; 0/ and .c; 0/ if the sum
of the distances from any point P on the ellipse to these two foci
is 2a (where a > c).
Solution
The ellipse passes through the four points .a; 0/, .a; 0/, .0; b/, and .0; b/,
where b2 D a2  c2. (See Figure 8.6.) Also, if P D .x; y/ is on the ellipse, then

The Focal Property of an Ellipse
Let P be any point on an ellipse having foci F1 and F2. The normal to the ellipse at
P bisects the angle between the lines F1P and F2P:
Reﬂection by an ellipse
Any ray coming from one focus of an ellipse will be reﬂected through the
other focus.
To see this, observe that if Q is any point on the line T tangent to the ellipse at P;
then F1Q meets the ellipse at a point X between F1 and Q (see Figure 8.7), so

to the eccentricity ". If P D .x; y/, F is the focus .c; 0/, Q is on the corresponding

A parabola may be considered as the limiting case of an ellipse whose eccentricity
has increased to 1. The distance between the foci is inﬁnite, so the centre, one focus,
and its corresponding directrix have moved off to inﬁnity leaving only one focus and
its directrix in the ﬁnite plane.
Hyperbolas
DEFINITION

Hyperbolas
A hyperbola consists of all points in the plane, the difference of whose dis-
tances from two ﬁxed points (the foci) is constant.
EXAMPLE 3
If the foci of a hyperbola are F1 D .c; 0/ and F2 D .c; 0/, and
the difference of the distances from a point P D .x; y/ on the
hyperbola to these foci is 2a (where a < c), then

Classifying General Conics
A second-degree equation in two variables,
Ax2 C Bxy C Cy2 C Dx C Ey C F D 0;
.A2 C B2 C C 2 > 0/;
generally represents a conic curve, but in certain degenerate cases it may represent two
straight lines (x2  y2 D 0 represents the lines x D y and x D y), one straight line
(x2 D 0 represents the line x D 0), a single point (x2 C y2 D 0 represents the origin),
or no points at all (x2 C y2 D 1 is not satisﬁed by any point in the plane).
The nature of the set of points represented by a given second-degree equation can
be determined by rewriting the equation in a form that can be recognized as one of
the standard types. If B D 0, this rewriting can be accomplished by completing the
squares in the x and y terms.
EXAMPLE 4
Describe the curve with equation x2 C 2y2 C 6x  4y C 7 D 0.
Solution
We complete the squares in the x and y terms, and rewrite the equation in
the form

If B ¤ 0, the equation has an xy term, and it cannot represent a circle. To see what
it does represent, we can rotate the coordinate axes to produce an equation with no
xy term. Let new coordinate axes (a u-axis and a v-axis) have the same origin but be
rotated an angle  from the x- and y-axes, respectively. (See Figure 8.15.) If point P
has coordinates .x; y/ with respect to the old axes, and coordinates .u; v/ with respect

Solution
The reader is likely well aware that the given equation represents a rec-

where F is a ﬁxed point, D a ﬁxed straight line, and " a ﬁxed

the equation of the conic if F is the origin and D is the line

Another parameter associated with conics is the semi-latus
rectum, usually denoted `. For a circle it is equal to the radius. For
other conics it is half the length of the chord through a focus and
perpendicular to the axis (for a parabola), the major axis (for an
ellipse), or the transverse axis (for a hyperbola). That chord is
called the latus rectum of the conic.

touch the plane are the foci of the ellipse. Hint: All tangent
lines drawn to a sphere from a given point outside the sphere
are equal in length. The distance between the two circles in
which the spheres intersect the cone, measured along
generators of the cone (i.e., straight lines lying on the cone), is
the same for all generators.

Suppose a plane intersects a right-circular cone in a parabola
with vertex at V: Suppose that a sphere is inscribed between
the cone and the plane as in the previous exercises and is
tangent to the plane of the parabola at point F: Show that the
chord to the parabola through F that is perpendicular to F V
has length equal to that of the latus rectum of the parabola.
Therefore, F is the focus of the parabola.

SECTION 8.2:
Parametric Curves

8.2
Parametric Curves
Suppose that an object moves around in the xy-plane so that the coordinates of its
position at any time t are continuous functions of the variable t:
x D f .t/;
y D g.t/:
The path followed by the object is a curve C in the plane that is speciﬁed by the two
equations above. We call these equations parametric equations of C. A curve speciﬁed
by a particular pair of parametric equations is called a parametric curve.
DEFINITION
4
Parametric curves
A parametric curve C in the plane consists of an ordered pair .f; g/ of con-
tinuous functions each deﬁned on the same interval I: The equations
x D f .t/;
y D g.t/;
for t in I;
are called parametric equations of the curve C. The independent variable t
is called the parameter.
Note that the parametric curve C was not deﬁned as a set of points in the plane, but
rather as the ordered pair of functions whose range is that set of points. Different pairs
of functions can give the same set of points in the plane, but we may still want to
regard them as different parametric curves. Nevertheless, we will often refer to the set
of points (the path traced out by .x; y/ as t traverses I) as the curve C. The axis (real
line) of the parameter t is distinct from the coordinate axes of the plane of the curve.
(See Figure 8.16.) We will usually denote the parameter by t; in many applications
the parameter represents time, but this need not always be the case. Because f and g
are assumed to be continuous, the curve x D f .t/, y D g.t/ has no breaks in it. A
parametric curve has a direction (indicated, say, by arrowheads), namely, the direction
corresponding to increasing values of the parameter t, as shown in Figure 8.16.

EXAMPLE 1

Solution
We could construct a table of values of x and y for various values of t, thus
getting the coordinates of a number of points on a curve. However, for this example it is
easier to eliminate the parameter from the pair of parametric equations, thus producing
a single equation in x and y whose graph is the desired curve:
t D y  1;
x D t2  1 D .y  1/2  1 D y2  2y:
All points on the curve lie on the parabola x D y22y. Since y ! ˙1 as t ! ˙1,
the parametric curve is the whole parabola. (See Figure 8.17.)

CHAPTER 8
Conics, Parametric Curves, and Polar Curves
Although the curve in Example 1 is more easily identiﬁed when the parameter is elim-
inated, there is a loss of information in going to the nonparametric form. Speciﬁcally,
we lose the sense of the curve as the path of a moving point and hence also the direc-
tion of the curve. If the t in the parametric form denotes the time at which an object is
at the point .x; y/, the nonparametric equation x D y2  2y no longer tells us where
the object is at any particular time t.
EXAMPLE 2

ing through the two points P0 D .x0; y0/ and P1 D .x1; y1/ (see

The point P D .x; y/ is at position P0 when t D 0 and at P1 when t D 1. If t D 1=2,
then P is the midpoint between P0 and P1. Note that the line segment from P0 to P1
corresponds to values of t between 0 and 1.
EXAMPLE 3
(An arc of a circle) Sketch and identify the curve x D 3 cos t,
y D 3 sin t, .0  t  3=2/.
Solution
Since x2 C y2 D 9 cos2 t C 9 sin2 t D 9, all points on the curve lie on the
circle x2Cy2 D 9. As t increases from 0 through =2 and  to 3=2, the point .x; y/
moves from .3; 0/ through .0; 3/ and .3; 0/ to .0; 3/. The parametric curve is three-
quarters of the circle. See Figure 8.19. The parameter t has geometric signiﬁcance in
this example. If Pt is the point on the curve corresponding to parameter value t; then
t is the angle at the centre of the circle corresponding to the arc from the initial point
to Pt.

Solution
Observe that

b2 D cos2 t C sin2 t D 1:
Therefore, the curve is all or part of an ellipse with major axis from .a; 0/ to .a; 0/
and minor axis from .0; b/ to .0; b/. As t increases from 0 to 2, the point .x; y/
moves counterclockwise around the ellipse starting from .a; 0/ and returning to the
same point. Thus, the curve is the whole ellipse.
Figure 8.20(a) shows how the parameter t can be interpreted as an angle and how
the points on the ellipse can be obtained using circles of radii a and b. Since the curve
starts and ends at the same point, it is called a closed curve.

Note that the curve is symmetric about the y-axis because x is an odd function of t

value.)
The curve intersects itself on the y-axis. (See Figure 8.20(b).) To ﬁnd this self-

General Plane Curves and Parametrizations
According to Deﬁnition 4, a parametric curve always involves a particular set of para-
metric equations; it is not just a set of points in the plane. When we are interested
in considering a curve solely as a set of points (a geometric object), we need not be
concerned with any particular pair of parametric equations representing that curve. In
this case we call the curve simply a plane curve.

476
CHAPTER 8
Conics, Parametric Curves, and Polar Curves
DEFINITION
5
Plane curves
A plane curve is a set of points .x; y/ in the plane such that x D f .t/ and
y D g.t/ for some t in an interval I; where f and g are continuous functions
deﬁned on I: Any such interval I and function pair .f; g/ that generate the
points of C is called a parametrization of C.
Since a plane curve does not involve any speciﬁc parametrization, it has no speciﬁc
direction.
EXAMPLE 6
The circle x2 C y2 D 1 is a plane curve. Each of the following is
a possible parametrization of the circle:
(i) x D cos t; y D sin t;
.0  t  2/,
(ii) x D sin s2; y D cos s2;
.0  s 
p
2/,
(iii) x D cos.u C 1/; y D sin.u C 1/;
.1  u  1/,
(iv) x D 1  t2; y D t
p
2  t2;
.
p
2  t 
p
2/.
To verify that any of these represents the circle, substitute the appropriate functions for
x and y in the expression x2 C y2, and show that the result simpliﬁes to the value 1.
This shows that the parametric curve lies on the circle. Then examine the ranges of x
and y as the parameter varies over its domain. For example, for (iv) we have
x2 C y2 D .1  t2/2 C .t
p
2  t2/2 D 1  2t2 C t4 C 2t2  t4 D 1;
and .x; y/ moves from .1; 0/ through .0; 1/ to .1; 0/ as t increases from 
p
2
through 1 to 0, and then continues on through .0; 1/ back to .1; 0/ as t continues to
increase from 0 through 1 to
p
2.
There are, of course, inﬁnitely many other possible parametrizations of this curve.
EXAMPLE 7
If f is a continuous function on an interval I; then the graph of
f is a plane curve. One obvious parametrization of this curve is
x D t;
y D f .t/;
.t in I/:
Some Interesting Plane Curves
We complete this section by parametrizing two curves that arise in the physical world.
EXAMPLE 8
(A cycloid) If a circle rolls without slipping along a straight line,
ﬁnd the path followed by a point ﬁxed on the circle. This path is
called a cycloid.
Solution
Suppose that the line on which the circle rolls is the x-axis, that the circle
has radius a and lies above the line, and that the point whose motion we follow is
originally at the origin O: See Figure 8.21. After the circle has rolled through an
angle t, it is tangent to the line at T; and the point whose path we are trying to ﬁnd has
moved to position P; as shown in the ﬁgure. Since no slipping occurs,
segment OT D arc P T D at:

The brachistochrone and
tautochrone problems
Suppose a wire is bent into a
curve from point A to a lower
point B and a bead can slide
without friction along the wire.
If the bead is released at A, it
will fall toward B: What curve
should be used to minimize the
time it takes to fall from A to B?
This problem, known as the
brachistochrone (Greek for
“shortest time”) problem, has as
its solution part of an upside-
down arch of a cycloid.
Moreover, it takes the same
amount of time for the bead to
slide from any point on the curve
to the lowest point B; making the
cycloid the solution of the
tautochrone (“equal time”)
problem as well. We will
examine these matters further in
the Challenging Exercises at the
end of Chapter 11.

The parametric equations of the cycloid are, therefore,
x D a.t  sin t/;
y D a.1  cos t/:
Observe that the cycloid has a cusp at the points where it returns to the x-axis, that is, at
points corresponding to t D 2n, where n is an integer. Even though the functions x
and y are everywhere differentiable functions of t, the curve is not smooth everywhere.
We shall consider such matters in the next section.
EXAMPLE 9
(An involute of a circle) A string is wound around a ﬁxed circle.
One end is unwound in such a way that the part of the string not
lying on the circle is extended in a straight line. The curve followed by this free end
of the string is called an involute of the circle. (The involute of any curve is the path
traced out by the end of the curve as the curve is straightened out beginning at that
end.)
Suppose the circle has equation x2 C y2 D a2, and suppose the end of the string
being unwound starts at the point A D .a; 0/. At some subsequent time during the
unwinding let P be the position of the end of the string, and let T be the point where
the string leaves the circle. The line P T must be tangent to the circle at T:
We parametrize the path of P in terms of the angle AOT; which we denote by t:
Let points R on OA and S on TR be as shown in Figure 8.22. TR is perpendicular to
OA and to PS. Note that
OR D OT cos t D a cos t;
RT D OT sin t D a sin t:
Since angle OTP is 90ı, we have angle STP D t: Since P T D arc AT D at (because
the string does not stretch or slip on the circle), we have
SP D TP sin t D at sin t;
ST D TP cos t D at cos t:
If P has coordinates .x; y/, then x D OR C SP; and y D RT  ST :
x D a cos t C at sin t;
y D a sin t  at cos t;
.t  0/:
These are parametric equations of the involute.

(A prolate cycloid) A railroad wheel has a ﬂange extending

radius of the wheel is a and that of the ﬂange is b > a, ﬁnd
parametric equations of the path of a point P at the
circumference of the ﬂange as the wheel rolls along the track.
(Note that for a portion of each revolution of the wheel, P is

(Hypocycloids) If a circle of radius b rolls, without slipping,
around the inside of a ﬁxed circle of radius a > b, a point on
the circumference of the rolling circle traces a curve called a
hypocycloid. If the ﬁxed circle is centred at the origin and the

where t is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line
from the origin to the point at which the rolling circle touches
the ﬁxed circle.
If a D 2 and b D 1, show that the hypocycloid becomes a
straight line segment.
If a D 4 and b D 1, show that the parametric equations of
the hypocycloid simplify to x D 4 cos3 t, y D 4 sin3 t. This
curve is called a hypocycloid of four cusps or an astroid. (See
Figure 8.23.) It has Cartesian equation x2=3 C y2=3 D 42=3.

Hypocycloids resemble the curves produced by a popular
children’s toy called Spirograph, but Spirograph curves result
from following a point inside the disc of the rolling circle
rather than on its circumference, and they therefore do not
have sharp cusps.

(The witch of Agnesi)
(a) Show that the curve traced out by the point P constructed
from a circle as shown in Figure 8.24 has parametric
equations x D tan t; y D cos2 t in terms of the angle t
shown. (Hint: You will need to make extensive use of
similar triangles.)
(b) Use a trigonometric identity to eliminate t from the
parametric equations, and hence ﬁnd an ordinary
Cartesian equation for the curve.
This curve is named for the Italian mathematician Maria
Agnesi (1718–1799), one of the foremost women scholars of
the eighteenth century and author of an important calculus
text. The term witch is due to a mistranslation of the Italian
word versiera (“turning curve”), which she used to describe
the curve. The word is similar to avversiera (“wife of the
devil” or “witch”).

In Exercises 23–26, obtain a graph of the curve x D sin.mt/,
y D sin.nt/ for the given values of m and n. Such curves are
called Lissajous ﬁgures. They arise in the analysis of electrical
signals using an oscilloscope. A signal of ﬁxed but unknown
frequency is applied to the vertical input, and a control signal is
applied to the horizontal input. The horizontal frequency is varied
until a stable Lissajous ﬁgure is observed. The (known) frequency
of the control signal and the shape of the ﬁgure then determine the
unknown frequency.

8.3
Smooth Parametric Curves and Their Slopes
We say that a plane curve is smooth if it has a tangent line at each point P and this
tangent turns in a continuous way as P moves along the curve. (That is, the angle

480
CHAPTER 8
Conics, Parametric Curves, and Polar Curves
between the tangent line at P and some ﬁxed line, the x-axis say, is a continuous
function of the position of P:)
If the curve C is the graph of function f; then C is certainly smooth on any
interval where the derivative f 0.x/ exists and is a continuous function of x. It may
also be smooth on intervals containing isolated singular points; for example, the curve
y D x1=3 is smooth everywhere even though dy=dx does not exist at x D 0.
For parametric curves x D f .t/, y D g.t/, the situation is more complicated.
Even if f and g have continuous derivatives everywhere, such curves may fail to be
smooth at certain points, speciﬁcally points where f 0.t/ D g0.t/ D 0.
EXAMPLE 1
Consider the parametric curve x D f .t/ D t2; y D g.t/ D t3.
Eliminating t leads to the Cartesian equation y2 D x3 or x D
y2=3, which is not smooth at the origin even though f 0.t/ D 2t and g0.t/ D 3t2 are
continuous for all t. (See Figure 8.25.) Observe that both f 0 and g0 vanish at t D 0:
f 0.0/ D g0.0/ D 0. If we regard the parametric equations as specifying the position
at time t of a moving point P; then the horizontal velocity is f 0.t/ and the vertical
velocity is g0.t/. Both velocities are 0 at t D 0, so P has come to a stop at that

This curve is not smooth at
the origin but has a cusp there
instant. When it starts moving again, it need not move in the direction it was going
before it stopped. The cycloid of Example 8 of Section 8.2 is another example where a
parametric curve is not smooth at points where dx=dt and dy=dt both vanish.
The Slope of a Parametric Curve
The following theorem conﬁrms that a parametric curve is smooth at points where the
derivatives of its coordinate functions are continuous and not both zero.
T H E O R E M
1
Let C be the parametric curve x D f .t/, y D g.t/, where f 0.t/ and g0.t/ are contin-
uous on an interval I: If f 0.t/ ¤ 0 on I, then C is smooth and has at each t a tangent
line with slope
dy
dx D g0.t/
f 0.t/:
If g0.t/ ¤ 0 on I; then C is smooth and has at each t a normal line with slope
dx
dy D f 0.t/
g0.t/ :
Thus, C is smooth except possibly at points where f 0.t/ and g0.t/ are both 0.
PROOF
If f 0.t/ ¤ 0 on I; then f is either increasing or decreasing on I and so is
one-to-one and invertible. The part of C corresponding to values of t in I has ordinary
equation y D g

for the derivative of an inverse function obtained in Section 3.1. This slope is a con-
tinuous function of t, so the tangent to C turns continuously for t in I: The proof for
g0.t/ ¤ 0 is similar. In this case the slope of the normal is a continuous function of t;
so the normal turns continuously. Therefore, so does the tangent.

If f 0 and g0 are continuous, and both vanish at some point t0, then the curve x D f .t/,
y D g.t/ may or may not be smooth around t0. Example 1 was an example of a curve
that was not smooth at such a point.
EXAMPLE 2
The curve with parametrization x D t3, y D t6 is just the parabola
y D x2, so it is smooth everywhere, although dx=dt D 3t2 and
dy=dt D 6t5 both vanish at t D 0.
Tangents and normals to parametric curves
If f 0 and g0 are continuous and not both 0 at t0, then the parametric equations

CHAPTER 8
Conics, Parametric Curves, and Polar Curves
Sketching Parametric Curves
As in the case of graphs of functions, derivatives provide useful information about the
shape of a parametric curve. At points where dy=dt D 0 but dx=dt ¤ 0, the tangent
is horizontal; at points where dx=dt D 0 but dy=dt ¤ 0, the tangent is vertical. For
points where dx=dt D dy=dt D 0, anything can happen; it is wise to calculate left-
and right-hand limits of the slope dy=dx as the parameter t approaches one of these
points. Concavity can be determined using the formula obtained above. We illustrate
these ideas by reconsidering a parametric curve encountered in the previous section.

Polar Coordinates and Polar Curves
The polar coordinate system is an alternative to the rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate
system for describing the location of points in a plane. Sometimes it is more important
to know how far, and in what direction, a point is from the origin than it is to know its
Cartesian coordinates. In the polar coordinate system there is an origin (or pole), O,
and a polar axis, a ray (i.e., a half-line) extending from O horizontally to the right.
The position of any point P in the plane is then determined by its polar coordinates
Œr; 	, where
(i) r is the distance from O to P; and
(ii) 	 is the angle that the ray OP makes with the polar axis (counterclockwise angles
being considered positive).
We will use square brackets for polar coordinates of a point to distinguish them from
rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates. Figure 8.33 shows some points with their polar
coordinates. The rectangular coordinate axes x and y are usually shown on a polar
graph. The polar axis coincides with the positive x-axis.
Unlike rectangular coordinates, the polar coordinates of a point are not unique.
The polar coordinates Œr; 	1 and Œr; 	2 represent the same point provided 	1 and 	2
differ by an integer multiple of 2:
	2 D 	1 C 2n;
where n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : : :

and Œ1; 2 both represent the point with Cartesian coordinates .1; 0/. In addition, the
origin O has polar coordinates Œ0;  for any value of . (If we go zero distance from
O; it doesn’t matter in what direction we go.)
Sometimes we need to interpret polar coordinates Œr; , where r < 0. The ap-
propriate interpretation for this “negative distance” r is that it represents a positive
distance r measured in the opposite direction (i.e., in the direction  C ):
Œr;  D Œr;  C :
For example, Œ1; =4 D Œ1; 5=4. Allowing r < 0 increases the number of different
sets of polar coordinates that represent the same point.
If we want to consider both rectangular and polar coordinate systems in the same
plane, and we choose the positive x-axis as the polar axis, then the relationships be-
tween the rectangular coordinates of a point and its polar coordinates are as shown in
Figure 8.34.

EXAMPLE 2
Find the Cartesian equation of the curve represented by the polar
equation r D 2a cos ; hence, identify the curve.
Solution
The polar equation can be transformed to Cartesian coordinates if we ﬁrst
multiply it by r:
r2 D 2ar cos 
x2 C y2 D 2ax
.x  a/2 C y2 D a2
The given polar equation r D 2a cos  thus represents a circle with centre .a; 0/ and
radius a, as shown in Figure 8.35. Observe from the equation that r ! 0 as  !
˙=2. In the ﬁgure, this corresponds to the fact that the circle approaches the origin
in the vertical direction.

Some Polar Curves
Figure 8.36 shows the graphs of the polar equations r D a and  D ˇ, where a and ˇ
(Greek “beta”) are constants. These are, respectively, the circle with radius jaj centred
at the origin, and a line through the origin making angle ˇ with the polar axis. Note
that the line and the circle meet at two points, with polar coordinates Œa; ˇ and Œa; ˇ.
The “coordinate curves” for polar coordinates, that is, the curves with equations r D
constant and  D constant, are circles centred at the origin and lines through the origin,
respectively. The “coordinate curves” for Cartesian coordinates, x D constant and y D
constant, are vertical and horizontal straight lines. Cartesian graph paper is ruled with
vertical and horizontal lines; polar graph paper is ruled with concentric circles and
radial lines emanating from the origin, as shown in Figures 8.33 and 8.38.
The graph of an equation of the form r D f ./ is called the polar graph of
the function f: Some polar graphs can be recognized easily if the polar equation is
transformed to rectangular form.
For others, this transformation does not help; the

This is a circle of radius a that passes through the origin in the directions

ordinates .a cos 0; a sin 0/ and hence polar coordinates Œa; 0. For 0 D =2, we

Because it is shaped like a heart, this curve is called a cardioid. Observe the cusp at

directions  that make r D f ./ D 0. In this case, the only such direction is  D 0. It

It is not usually necessary to make a detailed table of values to sketch a polar
curve with a simple equation of the form r D f ./. It is essential to determine those
values of  for which r D 0 and indicate them on the graph with rays. It is also
useful to determine points where the curve is farthest from the origin. (Where is f ./
maximum or minimum?) Except possibly at the origin, polar curves will be smooth
wherever f ./ is a differentiable function of .

In all of the examples above, the functions f ./ are periodic and 2 is a period of each

Remark
Maple has a polarplot routine as part of its “plots” package, which must
be loaded prior to the use of polarplot. Here is how to get Maple to plot on the same

>
with(plots):
>
polarplot([1,2*sin(3*t)],t=0..2*Pi,scaling=constrained);
The option scaling=constrained is necessary with polar plots to force Maple
to use the same distance unit on both axes (so a circle will appear circular).

CHAPTER 8
Conics, Parametric Curves, and Polar Curves
Intersections of Polar Curves
Because the polar coordinates of points are not unique, ﬁnding the intersection points
of two polar curves can be more complicated than the similar problem for Cartesian
graphs. Of course, the polar curves r D f ./ and r D g./ will intersect at any points
Œr0; 0 for which
f .0/ D g.0/
and
r0 D f .0/;
but there may be other intersections as well. In particular, if both curves pass through
the origin, then the origin will be an intersection point, even though it may not show up
in solving f ./ D g./, because the curves may be at the origin for different values
of . For example, the two circles r D cos  and r D sin  intersect at the origin and
also at the point Œ1=
p
2; =4, even though only the latter point is obtained by solving
the equation cos  D sin . (See Figure 8.44.)

EXAMPLE 6
Find the intersections of the curves r D sin  and r D 1  sin .
Solution
Since both functions of  are periodic with period 2, we need only look
for solutions satisfying 0    2. Solving the equation
sin  D 1  sin ;
we get sin  D 1=2, so that  D =6 or  D 5=6. Both curves have r D 1=2 at these
points, so the two curves intersect at Œ1=2; =6 and Œ1=2; 5=6. Also, the origin lies
on the curve r D sin  (for  D 0 and  D 2) and on the curve r D 1  sin 
(for  D =2). Therefore, the origin is also an intersection point of the curves. (See
Figure 8.45.)
Finally, if negative values of r are allowed, then the curves r D f ./ and y D g./
will also intersect at Œr1; 1 D Œr2; 2 if, for some integer k,

Tangent direction for a polar curve
At any point P other than the origin on the polar curve r D f ./, the angle
 between the radial line from the origin to P and the tangent to the curve is
given by
tan  D f ./
f 0./:
In particular,  D =2 if f 0./ D 0. If f .0/ D 0 and the curve has a
tangent line at 0, then that tangent line has equation  D 0.
The formula above can be used to ﬁnd points where a polar graph has horizontal or
vertical tangents:
 C  D ;
so tan  D  tan 
for a horizontal tangent,
 C  D 
2 ;
so tan  D cot 
for a vertical tangent.
Remark
Since for parametric curves horizontal and vertical tangents correspond to
dy=dt D 0 and dx=dt D 0, respectively, it is usually easier to ﬁnd the critical points
of y D f ./ sin  for horizontal tangents and of x D f ./ cos  for vertical tangents.

Areas Bounded by Polar Curves
The basic area problem in polar coordinates is that of ﬁnding the area A of the region
R bounded by the polar graph r D f ./ and the two rays  D ˛ and  D ˇ. We
assume that ˇ > ˛ and that f is continuous for ˛    ˇ. See Figure 8.52.
A suitable area element in this case is a sector of angular width d, as shown in
Figure 8.52. For inﬁnitesimal d this is just a sector of a circle of radius r D f ./:

Introduction
An inﬁnite series is a sum that involves inﬁnitely many
terms. Since addition is carried out on two numbers at
a time, the evaluation of the sum of an inﬁnite series necessarily involves ﬁnding a
limit. Complicated functions f .x/ can frequently be expressed as series of simpler
functions. For example, many of the transcendental functions we have encountered
can be expressed as series of powers of x so that they resemble polynomials of inﬁnite
degree. Such series can be differentiated and integrated term by term, and they play a
very important role in the study of calculus.
9.1
Sequences and Convergence
By a sequence (or an inﬁnite sequence) we mean an ordered list having a ﬁrst element
but no last element. For our purposes, the elements (called terms) of a sequence will
always be real numbers, although much of our discussion could be applied to complex
numbers as well. Examples of sequences are:
f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; : : :g the sequence of positive integers,

1
2; 1
4; 1
8; 1
16; : : :

the sequence of positive integer powers of 1
2.
The terms of a sequence are usually listed in braces as shown. The ellipsis points .: : :/
should be read “and so on.”
An inﬁnite sequence is a special kind of function, one whose domain is a set of
integers extending from some starting integer to inﬁnity. The starting integer is usually
1, so the domain is the set of positive integers. The sequence fa1; a2; a3; a4; : : :g is
the function f that takes the value f .n/ D an at each positive integer n. A sequence
can be speciﬁed in three ways:
(i) We can list the ﬁrst few terms followed by : : : if the pattern is obvious.
(ii) We can provide a formula for the general term an as a function of n.
(iii) We can provide a formula for calculating the term an as a function of earlier terms
a1; a2; : : : ; an1 and specify enough of the beginning terms so the process of
computing higher terms can begin.

SECTION 9.1:
Sequences and Convergence
501
In each case it must be possible to determine any term of the sequence, although it may
be necessary to calculate all the preceding terms ﬁrst.

This is called the Fibonacci

In parts (a)–(g) of Example 1, the formulas on the left sides deﬁne the general term of
each sequence fang as an explicit function of n. In parts (h) and (i) we say the sequence
fang is deﬁned recursively or inductively; each term must be calculated from previous
ones rather than directly as a function of n. We now introduce terminology used to
describe various properties of sequences.
DEFINITION

Terms for describing sequences
(a) The sequence fang is bounded below by L, and L is a lower bound for
fang, if an  L for every n D 1; 2; 3; : : : : The sequence is bounded
above by M; and M is an upper bound, if an  M for every such n.
The sequence fang is bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded
below. In this case there is a constant K such that janj  K for every
n D 1; 2; 3; : : : : (We can take K to be the larger of jLj and jMj.)
(b) The sequence fang is positive if it is bounded below by zero, that is, if
an  0 for every n D 1; 2; 3; : : : I it is negative if an  0 for every n.
(c) The sequence fang is increasing if anC1  an for every n D 1; 2; 3; : : : I
it is decreasing if anC1  an for every such n. The sequence is said to be
monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing. (The terminology here
is looser than that used for functions, where we would have used non-
decreasing and nonincreasing to describe this behaviour. The distinction
between anC1 > an and anC1  an is not as important for sequences as
it is for functions deﬁned on intervals.)
(d) The sequence fang is alternating if ananC1 < 0 for every n D 1; 2; : : : ;
that is, if any two consecutive terms have opposite signs. Note that this
deﬁnition requires an ¤ 0 for each n.

When you want to show that a sequence is increasing, you can try to show that the
inequality anC1  an  0 holds for n  1. Alternatively, if an D f .n/ for a dif-
ferentiable function f .x/, you can show that f is a nondecreasing function on Œ1; 1/
by showing that f 0.x/  0 there. Similar approaches are useful for showing that a
sequence is decreasing.

is positive and, therefore,
bounded below. It seems clear that from the fourth term on, all the terms are getting
smaller. However, a2 > a1 and a3 > a2. Since anC1  an only if n  3, we say
that this sequence is ultimately decreasing. The adverb ultimately is used to describe
any termwise property of a sequence that the terms have from some point on, but not
necessarily at the beginning of the sequence. Thus, the sequence
fn  100g D f99; 98; : : : ; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; 3; : : :g
is ultimately positive even though the ﬁrst 99 terms are negative, and the sequence

is ultimately alternating even though the ﬁrst few terms do not alternate.
Convergence of Sequences
Central to the study of sequences is the notion of convergence. The concept of the
limit of a sequence is a special case of the concept of the limit of a function f .x/
as x ! 1. We say that the sequence fang converges to the limit L; and we write
limn!1 an D L; provided the distance from an to L on the real line approaches 0 as
n increases toward 1. We state this deﬁnition more formally as follows:

SECTION 9.1:
Sequences and Convergence
503
DEFINITION
2
Limit of a sequence
We say that sequence fang converges to the limit L, and we write
limn!1 an D L, if for every positive real number  there exists an integer N
(which may depend on ) such that if n  N , then jan  Lj < :
This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 9.1.

np > jcj
 ;
that is, if n  N; the least integer greater than .jcj=/1=p. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 2,
limn!1
c
np D 0.
Every sequence fang must either converge to a ﬁnite limit L or diverge. That is,
either limn!1 an D L exists (is a real number) or limn!1 an does not exist. If
limn!1 an D 1, we can say that the sequence diverges to 1; if limn!1 an D 1,
we can say that it diverges to 1. If limn!1 an simply does not exist (but is not 1
or 1), we can only say that the sequence diverges.

(d) f.1/ng D f1; 1; 1; 1; 1; : : :g simply diverges.
(e) f.1/nng D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; : : :g diverges (but not to 1 or 1 even though
limn!1 janj D 1).
The limit of a sequence is equivalent to the limit of a function as its argument ap-
proaches inﬁnity:
If lim
x!1 f .x/ D L and an D f .n/, then lim
n!1 an D L.

504
CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
Because of this, the standard rules for limits of functions (Theorems 2 and 4 of
Section 1.2) also hold for limits of sequences, with the appropriate changes of notation.
Thus, if fang and fbng converge, then

If an  bn  cn ultimately, and lim

The limits of many explicitly deﬁned sequences can be evaluated using these proper-
ties in a manner similar to the methods used for limits of the form limx!1 f .x/ in
Section 1.3.

since limn!1 1=n D 0 and limn!1 1=n2 D 0. The sequence converges and its

converges to 0.

If fang converges, then fang is bounded.
PROOF
Suppose limn!1 an D L. According to Deﬁnition 2, for  D 1 there exists
a number N such that if n > N , then jan  Lj < 1; therefore janj < 1 C jLj for such
n. (Why is this true?) If K denotes the largest of the numbers ja1j, ja2j; : : : ; jaN j,
and 1 C jLj, then janj  K for every n D 1; 2; 3; : : : : Hence, fang is bounded.
The converse of Theorem 1 is false; the sequence f.1/ng is bounded but does not
converge.
The completeness property of the real number system (see Section P.1) can be
reformulated in terms of sequences to read as follows:
Bounded monotonic sequences converge
If the sequence fang is bounded above and is (ultimately) increasing, then
it converges. The same conclusion holds if fang is bounded below and is
(ultimately) decreasing.
Thus, a bounded, ultimately monotonic sequence is convergent. (See Figure 9.2.)

There is a subtle point to note in
this solution. Showing that fang
is increasing is pretty obvious,
but how did we know to try and
show that 3 (rather than some
other number) was an upper
bound? The answer is that we
actually did the last part ﬁrst and
showed that if lim an D a exists,
then a D 3. It then makes sense
to try and show that an < 3 for
all n.
Of course, we can easily
show that any number greater
than 3 is an upper bound.

for every n by induction. Since fang is increasing and bounded above, limn!1 an D a

If fang is (ultimately) increasing, then either it is bounded above, and therefore con-

The proof of this theorem is left as an exercise. A corresponding result holds for
(ultimately) decreasing sequences.
The following theorem evaluates two important limits that ﬁnd frequent applica-
tion in the study of series.

since ln jxj < 0 when jxj < 1. Accordingly, since ex is continuous,
lim
n!1 jxjn D lim

Since jxjn  xn  jxjn, we have limn!1 xn D 0 by the Squeeze Theorem.

Inﬁnite Series
An inﬁnite series, usually just called a series, is a formal sum of inﬁnitely many terms;
for instance, a1 C a2 C a3 C a4 C    is a series formed by adding the terms of the
sequence fang. This series is also denoted P1
nD1 an:
1
X
nD1
an D a1 C a2 C a3 C a4 C    :
For example,

It is sometimes necessary or useful to start the sum from some index other than 1:

X
nD2

ln n D

ln 2 C

ln 3 C

ln 4 C    :
Note that the latter series would make no sense if we had started the sum from n D 1;
the ﬁrst term would have been undeﬁned.
When necessary, we can change the index of summation to start at a different
value. This is accomplished by a substitution, as illustrated in Example 3 of Section 5.1.
For instance, using the substitution n D m  2, we can rewrite P1
nD1 an in the form
P1
mD3 am2. Both sums give rise to the same expansion

nD1
an D a1 C a2 C a3 C    D

Addition is an operation that is carried out on two numbers at a time. If we want to
calculate the ﬁnite sum a1 C a2 C a3, we could proceed by adding a1 C a2 and then
adding a3 to this sum, or else we might ﬁrst add a2 C a3 and then add a1 to the sum.
Of course, the associative law for addition assures us we will get the same answer both
ways. This is the reason the symbol a1 C a2 C a3 makes sense; we would otherwise
have to write .a1 C a2/ C a3 or a1 C .a2 C a3/. This reasoning extends to any sum
a1 C a2 C    C an of ﬁnitely many terms, but it is not obvious what should be meant
by a sum with inﬁnitely many terms:
a1 C a2 C a3 C a4 C    :

SECTION 9.2:
Inﬁnite Series
509
We no longer have any assurance that the terms can be added up in any order to yield
the same sum. In fact, we will see in Section 9.4 that in certain circumstances, changing
the order of terms in a series can actually change the sum of the series. The interpre-
tation we place on the inﬁnite sum is that of adding from left to right, as suggested by
the grouping
   ....a1 C a2/ C a3/ C a4/ C a5/ C    :
We accomplish this by deﬁning a new sequence fsng, called the sequence of partial
sums of the series P1
nD1 an, so that sn is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the series:
s1 D a1
s2 D s1 C a2 D a1 C a2
s3 D s2 C a3 D a1 C a2 C a3
:::
sn D sn1 C an D a1 C a2 C a3 C    C an D
n
X
j D1
aj
:::
We then deﬁne the sum of the inﬁnite series to be the limit of this sequence of partial
sums.
DEFINITION
3
Convergence of a series
We say that the series P1
nD1 an converges to the sum s, and we write
1
X
nD1
an D s;
if limn!1 sn D s, where sn is the nth partial sum of P1
nD1 an:
sn D a1 C a2 C a3 C    C an D

Thus, a series converges if and only if the sequence of its partial sums converges.
Similarly, a series is said to diverge to inﬁnity, diverge to negative inﬁnity, or
simply diverge if its sequence of partial sums does so. It must be stressed that the con-
vergence of the series P1
nD1 an depends on the convergence of the sequence fsng D
fPn
j D1 aj g, not the sequence fang.

Some Theorems About Series

4
If P1
nD1 an converges, then limn!1 an D 0. Therefore, if limn!1 an does not exist,
or exists but is not zero, then the series P1
nD1 an is divergent. (This amounts to an nth
term test for divergence of a series.)

SECTION 9.2:
Inﬁnite Series
513
PROOF
If sn D a1 C a2 C    C an, then sn  sn1 D an. If P1
nD1 an converges,
then limn!1 sn D s exists, and limn!1 sn1 D s. Hence, limn!1 an D s  s D 0.
Remark
Theorem 4 is very important for the understanding of inﬁnite series. Stu-
dents often err either in forgeting that a series cannot converge if its terms do not
approach zero or in confusing this result with its converse, which is false. The con-
verse would say that if limn!1 an D 0, then P1
nD1 an must converge. The harmonic
series is a counterexample showing the falsehood of this assertion:
lim
n!1
1
n D 0
but
1
X
nD1
1
n diverges to inﬁnity:
When considering whether a given series converges, the ﬁrst question you should ask
yourself is: “Does the nth term approach 0 as n approaches 1?” If the answer is no,
then the series does not converge. If the answer is yes, then the series may or may
not converge. If the sequence of terms fang tends to a nonzero limit L, then P1
nD1 an
diverges to inﬁnity if L > 0 and diverges to negative inﬁnity if L < 0.

The following theorem asserts that it is only the ultimate behaviour of fang that deter-
mines whether P1
nD1 an converges. Any ﬁnite number of terms can be dropped from
the beginning of a series without affecting the convergence; the convergence depends
only on the tail of the series. Of course, the actual sum of the series depends on all the
terms.

If fang is ultimately positive, then the series P1

tial sums are bounded above) or diverge to inﬁnity (if its partial sums are not bounded
above).
The proofs of these two theorems are posed as exercises at the end of this section. The
following theorem is just a reformulation of standard laws of limits.

9.3
Convergence Tests for Positive Series
In the previous section we saw a few examples of convergent series (geometric and
telescoping series) whose sums could be determined exactly because the partial sums
sn could be expressed in closed form as explicit functions of n whose limits as n ! 1
could be evaluated. It is not usually possible to do this with a given series, and therefore
it is not usually possible to determine the sum of the series exactly. However, there are
many techniques for determining whether a given series converges and, if it does, for
approximating the sum to any desired degree of accuracy.
In this section we deal exclusively with positive series, that is, series of the form
1
X
nD1
an D a1 C a2 C a3 C    ;
where an  0 for all n  1. As noted in Theorem 6, such a series will converge
if its partial sums are bounded above and will diverge to inﬁnity otherwise. All our
results apply equally well to ultimately positive series since convergence or divergence
depends only on the tail of a series.
The Integral Test
The integral test provides a means for determining whether an ultimately positive series
converges or diverges by comparing it with an improper integral that behaves similarly.
Example 4 in Section 9.2 is an example of the use of this technique. We formalize the
method in the following theorem.
T H E O R E M

Suppose that an D f .n/, where f is positive, continuous, and nonincreasing on an
interval ŒN; 1/ for some positive integer N: Then

 sum of areas of shaded rectangles in Figure 9.4(b)
D aN C aN C1 C aN C2 C   
D s  sN 1 < 1;
so the improper integral represents a ﬁnite area and is thus convergent. (We omit the
remaining details showing that limR!1
R R
N f .t/ dt exists; like the series case, the
argument depends on the completeness of the real numbers.)
Remark
If an D f .n/, where f is positive, continuous, and nonincreasing on
Œ1; 1/, then Theorem 8 assures us that P1
nD1 an and
R 1
1 f .x/ dx both converge or
both diverge to inﬁnity. It does not tell us that the sum of the series is equal to the
value of the integral. The two are not likely to be equal in the case of convergence.
However, as we see below, integrals can help us approximate the sum of a series.
The principal use of the integral test is to establish the result of the following
example concerning the series P1
nD1 np, which is called a p-series. This result
should be memorized; we will frequently compare the behaviour of other series with
p-series later in this and subsequent sections.
EXAMPLE 1
(p-series) Show that
1
X
nD1
np D
1
X
nD1
1
np
 converges if p > 1
diverges to inﬁnity if p  1:
Solution
Observe that if p > 0, then f .x/ D xp is positive, continuous, and
decreasing on Œ1; 1/. By the integral test, the p-series converges for p > 1 and
diverges for 0 < p  1 by comparison with R 1
1 xp dx. (See Theorem 2(a) of
Section 6.5.) If p  0, then limn!1.1=np/ ¤ 0, so the series cannot converge in this
case. Being a positive series, it must diverge to inﬁnity.
Remark
The harmonic series P1
nD1 n1 (the case p D 1 of the p-series) is on the
borderline between convergence and divergence, although it diverges. While its terms
decrease toward 0 as n increases, they do not decrease fast enough to allow the sum
of the series to be ﬁnite. If p > 1, the terms of P1
nD1 np decrease toward zero fast
enough that their sum is ﬁnite. We can reﬁne the distinction between convergence and
divergence at p D 1 by using terms that decrease faster than 1=n, but not as fast as
1=nq for any q > 1. If p > 0, the terms 1=

n.ln n/p
have this property since ln n
grows more slowly than any positive power of n as n increases. The question now
arises whether P1
nD2 1=.n.ln n/p/ converges. It does, provided again that p > 1; you
can use the substitution u D ln x to check that
Z 1
2
dx
x.ln x/p D
Z 1
ln 2

up ;
which converges if p > 1 and diverges if 0 < p  1. This process of ﬁne-tuning
Example 1 can be extended even further. (See Exercise 36 below.)

The error in the approximation s  sn satisﬁes 0  s  sn  An. However, since s
must lie in the interval Œsn C AnC1; sn C An, we can do better by using the midpoint

Comparison Tests
The next test we consider for positive series is analogous to the comparison theorem
for improper integrals. (See Theorem 3 of Section 6.5.) It enables us to determine
the convergence or divergence of one series by comparing it with another series that is
known to converge or diverge.

A comparison test
Let fang and fbng be sequences for which there exists a positive constant K such that,
ultimately, 0  an  Kbn.
(a) If the series P1
nD1 bn converges, then so does the series P1
nD1 an.
(b) If the series P1
nD1 an diverges to inﬁnity, then so does the series P1
nD1 bn.

SECTION 9.3:
Convergence Tests for Positive Series

PROOF
Since a series converges if and only if its tail converges (Theorem 5), we can
BEWARE!
Theorem 9 does not
say that if P an converges then
P bn converges. It is possible that
the smaller sum may be ﬁnite while
the larger one is inﬁnite. (Do not
confuse a theorem with its
converse.)
assume, without loss of generality, that the condition 0  an  Kbn holds for all
n  1. Let sn D a1 C a2 C    C an and Sn D b1 C b2 C    C bn. Then sn  KSn. If
P bn converges, then fSng is convergent and hence is bounded by Theorem 1. Hence
fsng is bounded above. By Theorem 6, P an converges. Since the convergence of
P bn guarantees that of P an, if the latter series diverges to inﬁnity, then the former
cannot converge either, so it must diverge to inﬁnity too.

(b)

(c)

Solution
In each case we must ﬁnd a suitable comparison series that we already
know converges or diverges.
(a) Since 0 <
1
2n C 1 < 1
2n for n D 1; 2; 3; : : : ; and since P1
nD1
1
2n is a convergent
geometric series, the series P1
nD1
1
2n C 1 also converges by comparison.
(b) Observe that 3n C 1
n3 C 1 behaves like 3
n2 for large n, so we would expect to compare
the series with the convergent p-series P1
nD1 n2. We have, for n  1,
3n C 1
n3 C 1 D
3n
n3 C 1 C
1
n3 C 1 < 3n
n3 C 1
n3 < 3
n2 C 1
n2 D 4
n2 :
Thus, the given series converges by Theorem 9.
(c) For n D 2; 3; 4; : : : , we have 0 < ln n < n. Thus
1
ln n > 1
n. Since P1
nD2
1
n
diverges to inﬁnity (it is a harmonic series), so does P1
nD2
1
ln n by comparison.
The following theorem provides a version of the comparison test that is not quite as
general as Theorem 9 but is often easier to apply in speciﬁc cases.

A limit comparison test
Suppose that fang and fbng are positive sequences and that
lim

bn
D L;
where L is either a nonnegative ﬁnite number or C1.
(a) If L < 1 and P1
nD1 bn converges, then P1
nD1 an also converges.
(b) If L > 0 and P1
nD1 bn diverges to inﬁnity, then so does P1
nD1 an.
PROOF
If L < 1, then for n sufﬁciently large, we have bn > 0 and
0  an
bn
 L C 1;
so 0  an  .L C 1/bn. Hence P1
nD1 an converges if P1
nD1 bn converges, by
Theorem 9(a).

Therefore, 0 < bn  .2=L/an, and P1

Again we must make appropriate choices for comparison series.
(a) The terms of this series decrease like 1=pn. Observe that

Since the p-series P1
nD1
1
pn diverges to inﬁnity (p D 1=2), so does the series
P1
nD1
1
1 C pn, by the limit comparison test.
(b) For large n, the terms behave like n=n3, so let us compare the series with the
p-series P1
nD1 1=n2, which we know converges.

n3  2n C 3 also converges by the limit comparison
test.
In order to apply the original version of the comparison test (Theorem 9) successfully,
it is important to have an intuitive feeling for whether the given series converges or
diverges. The form of the comparison will depend on whether you are trying to prove
convergence or divergence. For instance, if you did not know intuitively that
1
X
nD1
1
100n C 20;000
would have to diverge to inﬁnity, you might try to argue that
1
100n C 20;000 < 1
n
for n D 1; 2; 3; : : : :
While true, this doesn’t help at all. P1
nD1 1=n diverges to inﬁnity; therefore Theorem 9
yields no information from this comparison. We could, of course, argue instead that
1
100n C 20;000 
1
20;100n
if n  1;

SECTION 9.3:
Convergence Tests for Positive Series
521
and conclude by Theorem 9 that P1
nD1.1=.100n C 20;000// diverges to inﬁnity by
comparison with the divergent series P1
nD1 1=n. An easier way is to use Theorem 10
and the fact that
L D lim

100n C 20;000

n
D lim

n
100n C 20;000 D

However, the limit comparison test Theorem 10 has a disadvantage when compared to
the ordinary comparison test Theorem 9. It can fail in certain cases because the limit
L does not exist. In such cases it is possible that the ordinary comparison test may still
work.
EXAMPLE 5

Since

The given series does, in fact, converge by comparison with P1

ordinary comparison test.
The Ratio and Root Tests

The ratio test
Suppose that an > 0 (ultimately) and that  D lim

exists or is C1.
(a) If 0   < 1, then P1
nD1 an converges.
(b) If 1 <   1, then limn!1 an D 1 and P1
nD1 an diverges to inﬁnity.
(c) If  D 1, this test gives no information; the series may either converge or diverge
to inﬁnity.
PROOF
Here  is the lowercase Greek letter “rho” (pronounced “roh”).
(a) Suppose  < 1. Pick a number r such that  < r < 1. Since we are given that
limn!1 anC1=an D , we have anC1=an  r for n sufﬁciently large; that is,
anC1  ran for n  N; say. In particular,

CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
Hence, P1
nDN an converges by comparison with the convergent geometric series
P1
kD0 rk. It follows that P1
nD1 an D PN 1
nD1 an C P1
nDN an must also converge.
(b) Now suppose that  > 1.
Pick a number r such that 1 < r < .
Since
limn!1 anC1=an D , we have anC1=an  r for n sufﬁciently large, say for
n  N: We assume N is chosen large enough that aN > 0. It follows by an
argument similar to that used in part (a) that aN Ck  rkaN for k D 0; 1; 2; : : : ,
and since r > 1, limn!1 an D 1. Therefore, P1
nD1 an diverges to inﬁnity.
(c) If  is computed for the series P1
nD1 1=n and P1
nD1 1=n2, we get  D 1 for each.
Since the ﬁrst series diverges to inﬁnity and the second converges, the ratio test
cannot distinguish between convergence and divergence if  D 1.
All p-series fall into the indecisive category where  D 1, as does P1
nD1 an, where
an is any rational function of n. The ratio test is most useful for series whose terms
decrease at least exponentially fast. The presence of factorials in a term also suggests
that the ratio test might be useful.

The following theorem is very similar to the ratio test but is less frequently used. Its
proof is left as an exercise. (See Exercise 37.) For examples of series to which it can
be applied, see Exercises 38 and 39.

The series P1

P1
nD1 1=n2 because its terms decrease like 1=n3. Hence,
fewer terms of that series will be needed to compute
P1
nD1 1=n2 to any desired degree of accuracy than would be
needed if we calculated with P1
nD1 1=n2 directly. Using
integral upper and lower bounds, determine a value of n for
which the modiﬁed partial sum s

approximates the sum of that series with error less than 0.001
in absolute value. Hence, determine P1
nD1 1=n2 to within
0.001 of its true value. (The technique exibited in this exercise
is known as improving the convergence of a series. It can be

satisfy S  s  S. In general, the cancellation that occurs because some terms are
negative and others positive makes it easier for a series to converge than if all the terms
are of one sign. We verify this insight in the following theorem.
T H E O R E M

If a series converges absolutely, then it converges.
PROOF
Let P1
nD1 an be absolutely convergent, and let bn D an C janj for each n.
Since janj  an  janj, we have 0  bn  2janj for each n. Thus, P1
nD1 bn
converges by the comparison test. Therefore, P1

Conditional convergence
If P1
nD1 an is convergent, but not absolutely convergent, then we say that it
is conditionally convergent or that it converges conditionally.
The alternating harmonic series is an example of a conditionally convergent series.
The comparison tests, the integral test, and the ratio test can each be used to test
for absolute convergence. They should be applied to the series P1
nD1 janj. For the
ratio test we calculate  D limn!1 janC1=anj. If  < 1, then P1
nD1 an converges
absolutely. If  > 1, then limn!1 janj D 1, so both P1
nD1 janj and P1
nD1 an must
diverge. If  D 1, we get no information; the series P1
nD1 an may converge absolutely,
it may converge conditionally, or it may diverge.

The Alternating Series Test
We cannot use any of the previously developed tests to show that the alternating har-
monic series converges; all of those tests apply only to (ultimately) positive series, so
they can test only for absolute convergence. Demonstrating convergence that is not
absolute is generally more difﬁcult to do. We present only one test that can establish
such convergence; this test can only be used on a very special kind of series.
T H E O R E M

The alternating series test
Suppose fang is a sequence whose terms satisfy, for some positive integer N;

SECTION 9.4:

(i) ananC1 < 0 for n  N;
(ii) janC1j  janj for n  N; and
(iii) limn!1 an D 0,
that is, the terms are ultimately alternating in sign and decreasing in size, and the
sequence has limit zero. Then the series P1
nD1 an converges.
PROOF
Without loss of generality we can assume N D 1 because convergence only
depends on the tail of a series. We also assume a1 > 0; the proof if a1 < 0 is similar.
If sn D a1 C a2 C    C an is the nth partial sum of the series, it follows from the
alternation of fang that a2nC1 > 0 and a2n < 0 for each n. Since the terms decrease
in size, a2nC1  a2nC2. Therefore, s2nC2 D s2n C a2nC1 C a2nC2  s2n for
n D 1; 2; 3; : : :; the even partial sums fs2ng form an increasing sequence. Similarly,
s2nC1 D s2n1 C a2n C a2nC1  s2n1, so the odd partial sums fs2n1g form a
decreasing sequence. Since s2n D s2n1 C a2n  s2n1, we can say, for any n, that

slowly and think about why each
statement is true.
s2  s4  s6      s2n  s2n1  s2n3      s5  s3  s1:
Hence, s2 is a lower bound for the decreasing sequence fs2n1g, and s1 is an upper
bound for the increasing sequence fs2ng. Both of these sequences therefore converge
by the completeness of the real numbers:
lim
n!1 s2n1 D sodd;
lim
n!1 s2n D seven:
Now a2n D s2n  s2n1, so 0 D limn!1 a2n D limn!1.s2n  s2n1/ D seven  sodd.
Therefore sodd D seven D s, say. Every partial sum sn is either of the form s2n1 or of
the form s2n. Thus, limn!1 sn D s exists and the series P.1/n1an converges to
this sum s.
Remark
The proof of Theorem 14 shows that the sum s of the series always lies
between any two consecutive partial sums of the series:
either
sn < s < snC1
or
snC1 < s < sn:
This proves the following theorem.

Error estimate for alternating series
If the sequence fang satisﬁes the conditions of the alternating series test (Theorem 14),
so that the series P1
nD1 an converges to the sum s, then the error in the approximation
s  sn (where n  N ) has the same sign as the ﬁrst omitted term anC1 D snC1  sn,
and its size is no greater than the size of that term:

Solution
This series satisﬁes the hypotheses for Theorem 15. If we use the partial

will satisfy

CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
This error is less than 0:001 if 1 C 2nC1 > 1;000. Since 210 D 1;024, n C 1 D 10
will do; we need 9 terms of the series to compute the sum to within 0:001 of its actual
value.
When determining the convergence of a given series, it is best to consider ﬁrst whether
the series converges absolutely. If it does not, then there remains the possibility of
conditional convergence.

Solution
The absolute values of the terms in series (a) and (b) are 1=n and 1=.ln n/,
respectively. Since 1=.ln n/ > 1=n, and P1
nD1 1=n diverges to inﬁnity, neither se-
ries (a) nor (b) converges absolutely. However, both series satisfy the requirements of
Theorem 14 and so both converge. Each of these series is conditionally convergent.
Series (c) is absolutely convergent because j.1/n1=n4j D 1=n4, and P1
nD1 1=n4
is a convergent p-series (p D 4 > 1). We could establish its convergence using
Theorem 14, but there is no need to do that since every absolutely convergent series is
convergent (Theorem 13).

The series converges absolutely if j.x  5/=2j < 1. This inequality is equivalent to
jx  5j < 2 (the distance from x to 5 is less than 2), that is, 3 < x < 7. If x < 3 or
x > 7, then j.x  5/=2j > 1. The series diverges; its terms do not approach zero.
If x D 3, the series is P1

The series converges absolutely if jxj=jxC2j < 1. This condition says that the distance
from x to 0 is less than the distance from x to 2. Hence, x > 1. The series diverges
if jxj=jx C 2j > 1, that is, if x < 1. If x D 1, the series is P1

1/2, which diverges. We conclude that the series converges absolutely for x > 1,
converges conditionally nowhere, and diverges for x  1.
When using the alternating series test, it is important to verify (at least mentally) that
all three conditions (i)–(iii) are satisﬁed.

(b) This series alternates and its terms have limit zero. However, the terms are not

be applied. In fact, since

it is readily seen that the given series diverges to inﬁnity.
Rearranging the Terms in a Series
The basic difference between absolute and conditional convergence is that when a
series P1
nD1 an converges absolutely, it does so because its terms fang decrease in
size fast enough that their sum can be ﬁnite even if no cancellation occurs due to terms
of opposite sign. If cancellation is required to make the series converge (because the
terms decrease slowly), then the series can only converge conditionally.
Consider the alternating harmonic series

This series converges, but only conditionally. If we take the subseries containing only
the positive terms, we get the series

7 C    ;
which diverges to inﬁnity. Similarly, the subseries of negative terms

diverges to negative inﬁnity.

530
CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
If a series converges absolutely, the subseries consisting of positive terms and the
subseries consisting of negative terms must each converge to a ﬁnite sum. If a series
converges conditionally, the positive and negative subseries will both diverge, to 1
and 1, respectively.
Using these facts we can answer a question raised at the beginning of Section 9.2.
If we rearrange the terms of a convergent series so that they are added in a different
order, must the rearranged series converge, and if it does will it converge to the same
sum as the original series? The answer depends on whether the original series was
absolutely convergent or merely conditionally convergent.
T H E O R E M
16
Convergence of rearrangements of a series
(a) If the terms of an absolutely convergent series are rearranged so that addition
occurs in a different order, the rearranged series still converges to the same sum as
the original series.
(b) If a series is conditionally convergent, and L is any real number, then the terms of
the series can be rearranged so as to make the series converge (conditionally) to
the sum L. It can also be rearranged so as to diverge to 1 or to 1, or just to
diverge.
Part (b) shows that conditional convergence is a rather suspect kind of convergence,
being dependent on the order in which the terms are added. We will not present a
formal proof of the theorem but will give an example suggesting what is involved.
(See also Exercise 30 below.)

it converges to 8 instead.
Solution
Start adding terms of the positive subseries

and keep going until the partial sum exceeds 8. (It will, eventually, because the positive
subseries diverges to inﬁnity.) Then add the ﬁrst term 1=2 of the negative subseries

4  1
6     :
This will reduce the partial sum below 8 again. Now resume adding terms of the
positive subseries until the partial sum climbs above 8 once more. Then add the second
term of the negative subseries and the partial sum will drop below 8. Keep repeating
this procedure, alternately adding terms of the positive subseries to force the sum above
8 and then terms of the negative subseries to force it below 8. Since both subseries have
inﬁnitely many terms and diverge to 1 and 1, respectively, eventually every term of
the original series will be included, and the partial sums of the new series will oscillate

Power Series
This section is concerned with a special kind of inﬁnite series called a power series,
which may be thought of as a polynomial of inﬁnite degree.

Power series

1
X
nD0
an.x  c/n D a0 C a1.x  c/ C a2.x  c/2 C a3.x  c/3 C   
is called a power series in powers of x  c or a power series about c. The
constants a0; a1; a2; : : : are called the coefﬁcients of the power series.
Since the terms of a power series are functions of a variable x, the series may or may
not converge for each value of x. For those values of x for which the series does
converge, the sum deﬁnes a function of x. For example, if 1 < x < 1, then
1 C x C x2 C x3 C    D
1
1  x :
The geometric series on the left side is a power series representation of the function
1=.1  x/ in powers of x (or about 0). Note that the representation is valid only in the
open interval .1; 1/ even though 1=.1  x/ is deﬁned for all real x except x D 1. For
x D 1 and for jxj > 1 the series does not converge, so it cannot represent 1=.1  x/
at these points.
The point c is the centre of convergence of the power series P1
nD0 an.x  c/n.
The series certainly converges (to a0) at x D c. (All the terms except possibly the
ﬁrst are 0.) Theorem 17 below shows that if the series converges anywhere else, then
it converges on an interval (possibly inﬁnite) centred at x D c, and it converges abso-
lutely everywhere on that interval except possibly at one or both of the endpoints if the
interval is ﬁnite. The geometric series
1 C x C x2 C x3 C   
is an example of this behaviour. It has centre of convergence c D 0, and converges
only on the interval .1; 1/, centred at 0. The convergence is absolute at every point
of the interval. Another example is the series

which we discussed in Example 4 of Section 9.4. We showed that this series con-
verges on the interval Œ3; 7/, an interval with centre x D 5, and that the convergence is
absolute on the open interval .3; 7/ but is only conditional at the endpoint x D 3.
T H E O R E M
17
For any power series P1
nD0 an .x  c/n one of the following alternatives must hold:
(i) the series may converge only at x D c,
(ii) the series may converge at every real number x, or
(iii) there may exist a positive real number R such that the series converges at every x
satisfying jx  cj < R and diverges at every x satisfying jx  cj > R. In this case
the series may or may not converge at either of the two endpoints x D c  R and
x D c C R.
In each of these cases the convergence is absolute except possibly at the endpoints
x D c  R and x D c C R in case (iii).
PROOF
We observed above that every power series converges at its centre of conver-
gence; only the ﬁrst term can be nonzero, so the convergence is absolute. To prove
the rest of this theorem, it sufﬁces to show that if the series converges at any number
x0 ¤ c, then it converges absolutely at every number x closer to c than x0 is, that is,
at every x satisfying jx  cj < jx0  cj. This means that convergence at any x0 ¤ c
implies absolute convergence on .c  x0; c C x0/, so the set of points x where the
series converges must be an interval centred at c.

(ii) the entire line .1; 1/,
(iii) a ﬁnite interval centred at c:
Œc  R; c C R, or Œc  R; c C R/, or .c  R; c C R, or .c  R; c C R/.
The number R in (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series. In case
(i) we say the radius of convergence is R D 0; in case (ii) it is R D 1.
The radius of convergence, R, can often be found by using the ratio test on the
power series: if

Algebraic Operations on Power Series

Any properties we demonstrate for such series extend automatically to power series of
the form P1

First, we observe that series having the same centre of convergence can be added
or subtracted on whatever interval is common to their intervals of convergence. The
following theorem is a simple consequence of Theorem 7 of Section 9.2 and does not
require a proof.

Long division can also be performed on power series, but there is no simple rule for
determining the coefﬁcients of the quotient series. The radius of convergence of the
quotient series is not less than the least of the three numbers R1, R2, and R3, where R1
and R2 are the radii of convergence of the numerator and denominator series and R3
is the distance from the centre of convergence to the nearest complex number where
the denominator series has sum equal to 0. To illustrate this point, observe that 1 and
1  x are both power series with inﬁnite radii of convergence:

Differentiation and Integration of Power Series
If a power series has a positive radius of convergence, it can be differentiated or inte-
grated term by term. The resulting series will converge to the appropriate derivative or
integral of the sum of the original series everywhere except possibly at the endpoints
of the interval of convergence of the original series. This very important fact ensures
that, for purposes of calculation, power series behave just like polynomials, the easiest
functions to differentiate and integrate. We formalize the differentiation and integra-
tion properties of power series in the following theorem.

CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
Together, these results imply that the termwise differentiated or integrated series have
the same radius of convergence as the given series. In fact, as the following examples
illustrate, the interval of convergence of the differentiated series is the same as that of
the original series except for the possible loss of one or both endpoints if the original
series converges at endpoints of its interval of convergence. Similarly, the integrated
series will converge everywhere on the interval of convergence of the original series
and possibly at one or both endpoints of that interval, even if the original series does
not converge at the endpoints.
Being differentiable on .R; R/, where R is the radius of convergence, the sum
f .x/ of a power series is necessarily continuous on that open interval. If the series
happens to converge at either or both of the endpoints R and R, then f is also
continuous (on one side) up to these endpoints. This result is stated formally in the fol-
lowing theorem. We will not prove it here; the interested reader is referred to textbooks
on mathematical analysis for a proof.

us that the series must converge to that function at x D 1 also. In particular, therefore,

Taylor and Maclaurin Series
If a power series P1
nD0 an.x  c/n has a positive radius of convergence R, then the
sum of the series deﬁnes a function f .x/ on the interval .c  R; c C R/. We say that
the power series is a representation of f .x/ on that interval. What relationship exists
between the function f .x/ and the coefﬁcients a0; a1; a2; : : : of the power series?
The following theorem answers this question.

SECTION 9.6:
Taylor and Maclaurin Series

Theorem 21 shows that a function f .x/ that has a power series representation with
centre at c and positive radius of convergence must have derivatives of all orders in an
interval around x D c, and it can have only one representation as a power series in
powers of x  c, namely

Taylor and Maclaurin series

is called the Taylor series of f about c (or the Taylor series of f in powers
of x  c). If c D 0, the term Maclaurin series is usually used in place of
Taylor series.
Note that the partial sums of such Taylor (or Maclaurin) series are just the Taylor (or
Maclaurin) polynomials studied in Section 4.10.
The Taylor series is a power series as deﬁned in the previous section. Theorem 17
implies that c must be the centre of any interval on which such a series converges, but
the deﬁnition of Taylor series makes no requirement that the series should converge
anywhere except at the point x D c, where the series is just f .c/ C 0 C 0 C   . The
series exists provided all the derivatives of f exist at x D c; in practice this means
that each derivative must exist in an open interval containing x D c. (Why?) However,
the series may converge nowhere except at x D c, and if it does converge elsewhere, it
may converge to something other than f .x/. (See Exercise 40 at the end of this section
for an example where this happens.) If the Taylor series does converge to f .x/ in an
open interval containing c, then we will say that f is analytic at c.
DEFINITION
9
Analytic functions
A function f is analytic at c if f has a Taylor series at c and that series
converges to f .x/ in an open interval containing c. If f is analytic at each
point of an open interval, then we say it is analytic on that interval.
Most, but not all, of the elementary functions encountered in calculus are analytic
wherever they have derivatives of all orders. On the other hand, whenever a power
series in powers of x  c converges for all x in an open interval containing c, then its
sum f .x/ is analytic at c, and the given series is the Taylor series of f about c.
Maclaurin Series for Some Elementary Functions
Calculating Taylor and Maclaurin series for a function f directly from Deﬁnition 8 is
practical only when we can ﬁnd a formula for the nth derivative of f . Examples of
such functions include .ax C b/r, eaxCb, ln.ax C b/, sin.ax C b/, cos.ax C b/, and
sums of such functions.

Observe the similarity between the series for sin x and sinh x and between
those for cos x and cosh x. If we were to allow complex numbers (numbers of the form
z D x C iy, where i2 D 1 and x and y are real; see Appendix I) as arguments
for our functions, and if we were to demonstrate that our operations on series could
be extended to series of complex numbers, we would see that cos x D cosh.ix/ and
sin x D i sinh.ix/. In fact, eix D cos x C i sin x and eix D cos x  i sin x, so

Such formulas are encountered in the study of functions of a complex variable (see

tions are just different manifestations of the same basic function, a complex exponen-
tial ez D exCiy. We content ourselves here with having mentioned the interesting
relationships above and invite the reader to verify them formally by calculating with
series. (Such formal calculations do not, of course, constitute a proof, since we have
not established the various rules covering series of complex numbers.)

CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
This series representation is valid for all x. A similar calculation would enable us to
expand cos x or sin x in powers of x  c for any real c; both functions are analytic at
every point of the real line.
Sometimes it is quite difﬁcult, if not impossible, to ﬁnd a formula for the general
term of a Maclaurin or Taylor series. In such cases it is usually possible to obtain
the ﬁrst few terms before the calculations get too cumbersome. Had we attempted to
solve Example 3(c) by multiplying the series for sin x by itself we might have found
ourselves in this bind. Other examples occur when it is necessary to substitute one
series into another or to divide one by another.
EXAMPLE 6
Obtain the ﬁrst three nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series for
(a) tan x and (b) ln cos x.
Solution
(a) tan x D .sin x/=.cos x/. We can obtain the ﬁrst three terms of the Maclaurin
series for tan x by long division of the series for cos x into that for sin x:

We cannot easily ﬁnd all the terms of the series; only with considerable computa-

rin series for tan x converges for jxj < =2, but we cannot demonstrate this fact by
the techniques we have at our disposal now. (It is true because the complex number

fact, the real value z D =2.)

Note that at each stage of the calculation we kept only enough terms to ensure
that we could get all the terms with powers up to x6. Being an even function,
ln cos x has only even powers in its Maclaurin series. Again, we cannot ﬁnd the
general term of this series. We could try to calculate terms by using the formula
ak D f .k/.0/=kŠ, but even this becomes difﬁcult after the ﬁrst few values of k.
Observe that the series for tan x could also have been derived from that of ln cos x
because we have tan x D  d

Taylor’s Formula Revisited
In the examples above we have used a variety of techniques to obtain Taylor series for
functions and verify that functions are analytic. As shown in Section 4.10, Taylor’s
Theorem provides a means for estimating the size of the error En.x/ D f .x/  Pn.x/
involved when the Taylor polynomial
Pn.x/ D
n
X
kD0
f .k/.c/
kŠ
.x  c/k
is used to approximate the value of f .x/ for x ¤ c. Since the Taylor polynomials are
partial sums of the Taylor series for f at c (if the latter exists), another technique for
verifying the convergence of a Taylor series is to use the formula for En.x/ provided
by Taylor’s Theorem to show, at least for an interval of values of x containing c, that
limn!1 En.x/ D 0. This implies that limn!1 Pn.x/ D f .x/ so that f is indeed
the sum of its Taylor series about c on that inverval, and f is analytic at c. Here is a
somewhat more general version of Taylor’s Theroem.
T H E O R E M
22
Taylor’s Theorem
If the .n C 1/st derivative of f exists on an interval containing c and x, and if Pn.x/
is the Taylor polynomial of degree n for f about the point x D c, then
f .x/ D Pn.x/ C En.x/
Taylor’s Formula
holds, where the error term En.x/ is given by either of the following formulas:
Lagrange remainder
En.x/ D f .nC1/.s/
.n C 1/Š .x  c/nC1;
for some s between c and x
Integral remainder
En.x/ D 1
nŠ
Z x
c
.x  t/nf .nC1/.t/ dt:
Taylor’s Theorem with Lagrange remainder was proved in Section 4.10 (Theorem 12)
by using the Mean-Value Theorem and induction on n. The integral remainder version
is also proved by induction on n. See Exercise 42 for hints on how to carry out the
proof. We will not make any use of the integral form of the remainder here.
Our ﬁnal example in this section re-establishes the Maclaurin series for ex by
ﬁnding the limit of the Lagrange remainder as suggested above.

Applications of Taylor and Maclaurin Series
Approximating the Values of Functions
We saw in Section 4.10 how Taylor and Maclaurin polynomials (the partial sums of
Taylor and Maclaurin series) can be used as polynomial approximations to more com-
plicated functions. In Example 5 of that section we used the Lagrange remainder in

552
CHAPTER 9
Sequences, Series, and Power Series
Taylor’s Formula to determine how many terms of the Maclaurin series for ex are
needed to calculate e1 D e correct to 3 decimal places. For comparison, we obtained
the same result in Example 7 in Section 9.3 by using a geometric series to bound the
tail of the series for e.
The following example shows how the error bound associated with the alternating
series test (see Theorem 15 in Section 9.4) can also be used for such approximations.
When the terms an of a series (i) alternate in sign, (ii) decrease steadily in size, and
(iii) approach zero as n ! 1, then the error involved in using a partial sum of the
series as an approximation to the sum of the series has the same sign as, and is no
greater in absolute value than, the ﬁrst omitted term.
EXAMPLE 1
Find cos 43ı with error less than 1=10;000.
Solution
We give two alternative solutions:
METHOD I. We can use the Maclaurin series for cosine:

    :
Now 43=180  0:750 49    < 1, so the series above must satisfy the conditions
(i)–(iii) mentioned above. If we truncate the series after the nth term
.1/n1

.2n  2/Š

then the error E will be bounded by the size of the ﬁrst omitted term:
jEj 

.2n/Š
43
180
2n
<

.2n/Š:
The error will not exceed 1=10;000 if .2n/Š > 10;000, so n D 4 will do (8Š D 40;320).

METHOD II. Since 43ı is close to 45ı D =4 rad, we can do a bit better by using the
Taylor series about =4 instead of the Maclaurin series:

(In fact, cos 43ı D 0:731 353 7    :)
When ﬁnding approximate values of functions, it is best, whenever possible, to use a
power series about a point as close as possible to the point where the approximation is
desired.

Functions Deﬁned by Integrals
Many functions that can be expressed as simple combinations of elementary func-
tions cannot be antidifferentiated by elementary techniques; their antiderivatives are
not simple combinations of elementary functions. We can, however, often ﬁnd the
Taylor series for the antiderivatives of such functions and hence approximate their def-
inite integrals.

We stopped with the nth term. Again, the alternating series test assures us that the
error in this approximation does not exceed the ﬁrst omitted term, so it will be less
than 0.0005, provided .2n C 1/nŠ > 2;000. Since 13  6Š D 9;360, n D 6 will do.

writing Taylor’s Formula for .1 C x/r with c D 0 and showing that the remainder
En.x/ ! 0 as n ! 1. (We would need to use the integral form of the remainder to
prove this for all jxj < 1.) However, we will use an easier method, similar to the one

The Multinomial Theorem
The Binomial Theorem can be extended to provide for expansions of positive integer
powers of sums of more than two quantities. Before stating this Multinomial Theo-
rem, we require some new notation.
For an integer n  2, let m D .m1; m2; : : : ; mn/ be an n-tuple of nonnegative
integers. We call m a multiindex of order n, and the number jmj D m1Cm2C  Cmn
the degree of the multiindex. In terms of multiindices, the Binomial Theorem can be
restated in the form

Evidently, the Binomial Theorem is the special case n D 2. The proof of the Multi-
nomial Theorem can be carried out by induction on n. See Exercise 12 below.
The coefﬁcients of the various products of powers of the variables xi in the Multi-
nomial Theorem are called multinomial coefﬁcients. By analogy with the notation
used for binomial coefﬁcients, if m1 C    C mn D k, the multinomial coefﬁcients can

They are useful for counting distinct arrangements of objects where not all of the ob-
jects appear to be different.
EXAMPLE 4
The number of ways that k distinct objects can be arranged in a
sequence of positions 1, 2, : : : , k is kŠ because there are k choices
for the object to go in position 1, then k  1 choices for the object to go into posi-
tion 2, and so on, until there is only 1 choice for the object to go into position k. But
what if the objects are not all distinct, but instead there are several objects of each of
n different types, say type 1, type 2, : : : , type n such that objects of the same type are
indistinguishable from one another. If you just look at positions in the sequence con-
taining objects of type j; and rearrange only those objects, you can’t tell the difference.
If there are mj objects of type j; (1  j  n), then the number of distinct rearrange-
ments of the k objects is given by the multinomial coefﬁcient ./. For example, the
number of visually different arrangements of 9 balls, 2 of which are red, 3 green, and
4 blue is

Fourier Series
As we have seen, power series representations of functions make it possible to ap-
proximate those functions as closely as we want in intervals near a particular point of
interest by using partial sums of the series, that is, polynomials. However, in many
important applications of mathematics, the functions involved are required to be peri-
odic. For example, much of electrical engineering is concerned with the analysis and
manipulation of waveforms, which are periodic functions of time. Polynomials are not
periodic functions, and for this reason power series are not well suited to representing
such functions.
Much more appropriate for the representations of periodic functions over extended
intervals are certain inﬁnite series of periodic functions called Fourier series.
Periodic Functions
Recall that a function f deﬁned on the real line is periodic with period T if
f .t C T / D f .t/
for all real t.
./
This implies that f .t C mT / D f .t/ for any integer m, so that if T is a period of f;
then so is any multiple mT of T: The smallest positive number T for which ./ holds
is called the fundamental period, or simply the period of f:
The entire graph of a function with period T can be obtained by shifting the part
of the graph in any half-open interval of length T (e.g., the interval Œ0; T /) to the left
or right by integer multiples of the period T: Figure 9.6 shows the graph of a function
of period 2.
Figure 9.6
This function has period 2.
Observe how the graph repeats the part in
the interval Œ0; 2/ over and over to the left
and right

g.t C 2/ D cos.t C 2/ D cos.t/ D g.t/:
The function k.t/ D sin.2t/ also has period 2, but this is not its fundamental period.
The fundamental period is 1:
k.t C 1/ D sin.2t C 2/ D sin.2t/ D k.t/:
The sum f .t/ D g.t/ C 1

period 2, the least common multiple of the periods of its two terms.

and
gn.t/ D sin.n!t/

SECTION 9.9:

561
both have fundamental period T D 2=.n!/. The collection of all such functions
corresponding to all positive integers n have common period T D 2=!, the funda-
mental period of f1 and g1. T is an integer multiple of the fundamental periods of
all the functions fn and gn. The subject of Fourier series is concerned with express-
ing general functions with period T as series whose terms are real multiples of these
functions.
Fourier Series
It can be shown (but we won’t do it here) that if f .t/ is periodic with fundamental
period T; is continuous, and has a piecewise continuous derivative on the real line,
then f .t/ is everywhere the sum of a series of the form

for a given such function f is made possible by the following identities, valid for
integers m and n, which are easily proved by using the addition formulas for sine and
cosine. (See Exercises 49–51 in Section 5.6.)

As noted earlier, the Fourier series of a function f .t/ that is periodic, continuous,
and has a piecewise continuous derivative on the real line converges to f .t/ at each
real number t. However, the Fourier coefﬁcients (and hence the Fourier series) can be
calculated (by the formulas given above) for periodic functions with piecewise contin-
uous derivative even if the functions are not themselves continuous, but only piecewise
continuous.
Recall that f .t/ is piecewise continuous on the interval Œa; b if there exists a
partition fa D x0 < x1 < x2 <    < xk D bg of Œa; b and functions F1, F2, : : : , Fk,
such that
(i) Fi is continuous on Œxi1; xi, and
(ii) f .t/ D Fi.t/ on .xi1; xi/.
The integral of such a function f is the sum of integrals of the functions Fi:

Since f .t/ cos.n!t/ and f .t/ sin.n!t/ are piecewise continuous if f is, the Fourier
coefﬁcients of a piecewise continuous, periodic function can be calculated by the same
formulas given for a continuous periodic function. The question of where and to what
the Fourier series converges in this case is answered by the following theorem, proved
in textbooks on Fourier analysis.
T H E O R E M
25
The Fourier series of a piecewise continuous, periodic function f with piecewise con-
tinuous derivative converges to that function at every point t where f is continuous.
Moreover, if f is discontinuous at t D c, then f has different, but ﬁnite, left and right
limits at c:
lim

and

Fourier Cosine and Sine Series
As observed in Example 3 and Example 5, even functions have no sine terms in their
Fourier series, and odd functions have no cosine terms (including the constant term
a0=2). It is often necessary in applications to ﬁnd a Fourier series representation of a
given function deﬁned on a ﬁnite interval Œ0; a having either no sine terms (a Fourier
cosine series) or no cosine terms (a Fourier sine series). This is accomplished by
extending the domain of f to Œa; 0/ so as to make f either even or odd on Œa; a,
f .t/ D f .t/ if a  t < 0 for the even extension
f .t/ D f .t/ if a  t < 0 for the odd extension,
and then calculating its Fourier series considering the extended f to have period 2a.
(If we want the odd extension, we may have to redeﬁne f .0/ to be 0.)

Introduction
A complete real-variable calculus program involves the
study of
(i) real-valued functions of a single real variable,
(ii) vector-valued functions of a single real variable,
(iii) real-valued functions of a real vector variable, and
(iv) vector-valued functions of a real vector variable.
Chapters 1–9 are concerned with item (i). The remaining chapters deal with items (ii),
(iii), and (iv). Speciﬁcally, Chapter 11 deals with vector-valued functions of a single
real variable. Chapters 12–14 are concerned with the differentiation and integration
of real-valued functions of several real variables, that is, of a real vector variable.
Chapters 15–17 present aspects of the calculus of functions whose domains and ranges
both have dimension greater than one, that is, vector-valued functions of a vector vari-
able. Most of the time we will limit our attention to vector functions with domains and
ranges in the plane, or in three-dimensional space.
In this chapter we will lay the foundation for multivariable and vector calculus
by extending the concepts of analytic geometry to three or more dimensions and by
introducing vectors as a convenient way of dealing with several variables as a single
entity. We also introduce matrices, because these will prove useful for formulating
some of the concepts of calculus. This chapter is not intended to be a full course in
linear algebra; we develop only those aspects that we will use in later chapters, and we
omit most proofs.

CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space
10.1
Analytic Geometry in Three Dimensions
We say that the physical world in which we live is three-dimensional because through
any point there can pass three, and no more, straight lines that are mutually perpen-
dicular; that is, each of them is perpendicular to the other two. This is equivalent to the
fact that we require three numbers to locate a point in space with respect to some ref-
erence point (the origin). One way to use three numbers to locate a point is by having
them represent (signed) distances from the origin, measured in the directions of three
mutually perpendicular lines passing through the origin. We call such a set of lines a
Cartesian coordinate system, and each of the lines is called a coordinate axis. We usu-
ally call these axes the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis, regarding the x- and y-axes
as lying in a horizontal plane and the z-axis as vertical. Moreover, the coordinate sys-
tem should have a right-handed orientation. This means that the thumb, foreﬁnger,
and middle ﬁnger of the right hand can be extended so as to point, respectively, in the
directions of the positive x-axis, the positive y-axis, and the positive z-axis. For the
more mechanically minded, a right-handed screw will advance in the positive z direc-
tion if twisted in the direction of rotation from the positive x-axis toward the positive
y-axis. (See Figure 10.1(a).)

With respect to such a Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates of a point
P in 3-space constitute an ordered triple of real numbers, .x; y; z/. The numbers x,
y, and z are, respectively, the signed distances of P from the origin, measured in the
directions of the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis. (See Figure 10.1(b).)
Let Q be the point with coordinates .x; y; 0/. Then Q lies in the xy-plane (the
plane containing the x- and y-axes) directly under (or over) P: We say that Q is the
vertical projection of P onto the xy-plane. If r is the distance from the origin O to P
and s is the distance from O to Q, then, using two right-angled triangles, we have
s2 D x2 C y2
and
r2 D s2 C z2 D x2 C y2 C z2:
Thus, the distance from P to the origin is given by
r D

By the cosine law, a2 D b2Cc22bc cos A: In this case a2 D 59 D 3C56 D b2Cc2,
so that 2bc cos A must be 0. Therefore, cos A D 0 and A D 90ı.
Just as the x- and y-axes divide the xy-plane into four quadrants, so also the three
coordinate planes in 3-space (the xy-plane, the xz-plane, and the yz-plane) divide
3-space into eight octants. We call the octant in which x  0, y  0, and z  0 the
ﬁrst octant. When drawing graphs in 3-space it is sometimes easier to draw only the
part lying in the ﬁrst octant (Figure 10.3).
An equation or inequality involving the three variables x, y, and z deﬁnes a subset
of points in 3-space whose coordinates satisfy the equation or inequality. A single
equation usually represents a surface (a two-dimensional object) in 3-space.

EXAMPLE 2
(Some equations and the surfaces they represent)
(a) The equation z D 0 represents all points with coordinates .x; y; 0/, that is, the
xy-plane. The equation z D 2 represents all points with coordinates .x; y; 2/,
that is, the horizontal plane passing through the point .0; 0; 2/ on the z-axis.
(b) The equation x D y represents all points with coordinates .x; x; z/. This is a
vertical plane containing the straight line with equation x D y in the xy-plane.
The plane also contains the z-axis. (See Figure 10.4.)
x
y
z
Figure 10.4
Equation x D y deﬁnes a

(c) The equation x C y C z D 1 represents all points the sum of whose coordinates
is 1. This set is a plane that passes through the three points .1; 0; 0/, .0; 1; 0/,
and .0; 0; 1/. These points are not collinear (they do not lie on a straight line), so
there is only one plane passing through all three. (See Figure 10.5.) The equation
x C y C z D 0 represents a plane parallel to the one with equation x C y C z D 1
but passing through the origin.
(d) The equation x2 C y2 D 4 represents all points on the vertical circular cylinder
containing the circle with equation x2 C y2 D 4 in the xy-plane. This cylinder
has radius 2 and axis along the z-axis. (See Figure 10.6.)
Here the term “cylinder” is used
to describe a surface ruled by
parallel straight lines, not a solid
as it was in Section 7.1.
(e) The equation z D x2 represents all points with coordinates .x; y; x2/.
This
surface is a parabolic cylinder tangent to the xy-plane along the y-axis. (See
Figure 10.7.)
(f) The equation x2 C y2 C z2 D 25 represents all points .x; y; z/ at distance 5 from
the origin. This set of points is a sphere of radius 5 centred at the origin.

CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space
Observe that equations in x, y, and z need not involve each variable explicitly. When
one of the variables is missing from the equation, the equation represents a surface
parallel to the axis of the missing variable. Such a surface may be a plane or a cylinder.
For example, if z is absent from the equation, the equation represents in 3-space a
vertical (i.e., parallel to the z-axis) surface containing the curve with the same equation
in the xy-plane.
Occasionally, a single equation may not represent a two-dimensional object (a sur-
face). It can represent a one-dimensional object (a line or curve), a zero-dimensional
object (one or more points), or even nothing at all.
EXAMPLE 3
Identify the graphs of (a) y2C.z1/2 D 4, (b) y2C.z1/2 D 0,
(c) x2 C y2 C z2 D 0, and (d) x2 C y2 C z2 D 1.
Solution
(a) Since x is absent, the equation y2 C .z  1/2 D 4 represents an object parallel to
the x-axis. In the yz-plane the equation represents a circle of radius 2 centred at
.y; z/ D .0; 1/. In 3-space it represents a horizontal circular cylinder, parallel to
the x-axis, with axis one unit above the x-axis. (See Figure 10.8.)
(b) Since squares cannot be negative, the equation y2 C .z  1/2 D 0 implies that
y D 0 and z D 1, so it represents points .x; 0; 1/. All these points lie on the line
parallel to the x-axis and one unit above it. (See Figure 10.8.)
(c) As in part (b), x2 C y2 C z2 D 0 implies that x D 0, y D 0, and z D 0. The
equation represents only one point, the origin.

(d) The equation x2 C y2 C z2 D 1 is not satisﬁed by any real numbers x, y, and
z, so it represents no points at all.
A single inequality in x, y, and z typically represents points lying on one side of the
surface represented by the corresponding equation (together with points on the surface
if the inequality is not strict).
EXAMPLE 4
(a) The inequality z > 0 represents all points above the xy-plane.
(b) The inequality x2 C y2  4 says that the square of the distance from .x; y; z/ to
the nearest point .0; 0; z/ on the z-axis is at least 4. This inequality represents all
points lying on or outside the cylinder of Example 2(d).
(c) The inequality x2 C y2 C z2  25 says that the square of the distance from
.x; y; z/ to the origin is no greater than 25. It represents the solid ball of radius 5
centred at the origin, which consists of all points lying inside or on the sphere of
Example 2(f).
Two equations in x, y, and z normally represent a one-dimensional object, the line or
curve along which the two surfaces represented by the two equations intersect. Any
point whose coordinates satisfy both equations must lie on both the surfaces, so must
lie on their intersection.

(a) The equation x Cy Cz D 1 represents the oblique plane of Example 2(c), and the
equation y  2x D 0 represents a vertical plane through the origin and the point
.1; 2; 0/. Together these two equations represent the line of intersection of the two
planes. This line passes through, for example, the points .0; 0; 1/ and . 1
3; 2
3; 0/.
(See Figure 10.9(a).)
(b) The equation x2 C y2 C z2 D 1 represents a sphere of radius 1 with centre at the
origin, and x C y D 1 represents a vertical plane through the points .1; 0; 0/ and
.0; 1; 0/. The two surfaces intersect in a circle, as shown in Figure 10.9(b). The
line from .1; 0; 0/ to .0; 1; 0/ is a diameter of the circle, so the centre of the circle
is . 1

In Sections 10.4 and 10.5 we will see many more examples of geometric objects in
3-space represented by simple equations.
Euclidean n-Space
Mathematicians and users of mathematics frequently need to consider n-dimensional
space, where n is greater than 3 and may even be inﬁnite. It is difﬁcult to visualize a
space of dimension 4 or higher geometrically. The secret to dealing with these spaces
is to regard the points in n-space as being ordered n-tuples of real numbers; that is,
.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ is a point in n-space instead of just being the coordinates of such a
point. We stop thinking of points as existing in physical space and start thinking of
them as algebraic objects. We usually denote n-space by the symbol Rn to show that
its points are n-tuples of real numbers. Thus R2 and R3 denote the plane and 3-space,
respectively. Note that in passing from R3 to Rn we have altered the notation a bit: in
R3 we called the coordinates x, y, and z, while in Rn we called them x1, x2, : : : and xn
so as not to run out of letters. We could, of course, talk about coordinates .x1; x2; x3/
in R3 and .x1; x2/ in the plane R2, but .x; y; z/ and .x; y/ are traditionally used there.
Although we think of points in Rn as n-tuples rather than geometric objects, we
do not want to lose all sight of the underlying geometry. By analogy with the two- and
three-dimensional cases, we still consider the quantity
p
.y1  x1/2 C .y2  x2/2 C    C .yn  xn/2
as representing the distance between the points with coordinates .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ and
.y1; y2; : : : ; yn/. Also, we call the .n  1/-dimensional set of points in Rn that satisfy
the equation xn D 0 a hyperplane, by analogy with the plane z D 0 in R3.
Describing Sets in the Plane, 3-Space, and n-Space
We conclude this section by collecting some deﬁnitions of terms used to describe sets
of points in Rn for n  2. These terms belong to the branch of mathematics called

574
CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space
topology, and they generalize the notions of open and closed intervals and endpoints
used to describe sets on the real line R. We state the deﬁnitions for Rn, but we are most
interested in the cases where n D 2 or n D 3.
A neighbourhood of a point P in Rn is a set of the form
Br.P / D fQ 2 Rn W distance from Q to P < rg
for some r > 0.
For n D 1, if p 2 R, then Br.p/ is the open interval .p  r; p C r/ centred at p.
For n D 2, Br.P / is the open disk of radius r centred at point P:
For n D 3, Br.P / is the open ball of radius r centred at point P:
A set S is open in Rn if every point of S has a neighbourhood contained in S.
Every neighbourhood is itself an open set. Other examples of open sets in R2 include
the sets of points .x; y/ such that x > 0, or such that y > x2, or even such that y ¤ x2.
Typically, sets deﬁned by strict inequalities (using > and <) are open. Examples in R3
include the sets of points .x; y; z/ satisfying x C y C z > 2, or 1 < x < 3.
The whole space Rn is an open set in itself. For technical reasons, the empty set
(containing no points) is also considered to be open. (No point in the empty set fails to
have a neighbourhood contained in the empty set.)
The complement, Sc; of a set S in Rn is the set of all points in Rn that do not
belong to S. For example, the complement of the set of points .x; y/ in R2 such that
x > 0 is the set of points for which x  0. A set is said to be closed if its complement
is open. Typically, sets deﬁned by nonstrict inequalities (using  and ) are closed.
Closed intervals are closed sets in R. Since the whole space and the empty set are both
open in Rn and are complements of each other, they are also both closed. They are the
only sets that are both open and closed.
A point P is called a boundary point of a set S if every neighbourhood of P
contains both points in S and points in Sc. The boundary, bdry.S/, of a set S is
the set of all boundary points of S. For example, the boundary of the closed disk
x2 C y2  1 in R2 is the circle x2 C y2 D 1. A closed set contains all its boundary
points. An open set contains none of its boundary points.
A point P is an interior point of a set S if it belongs to S but not to the boundary
of S. P is an exterior point of S if it belongs to the complement of S but not to
the boundary of S. The interior, int.S/, and exterior, ext.S/, of S consist of all the
interior points and exterior points of S, respectively. Both int.S/ and ext.S/ are open
sets. S is open if and only if int.S/ D S. S is closed if and only if ext.S/ D Sc. See
Figure 10.10.

10.2
Vectors
A vector is a quantity that involves both magnitude (size or length) and direction. For
instance, the velocity of a moving object involves its speed and direction of motion, and
so is a vector. Such quantities are represented geometrically by arrows (directed line
segments) and are often actually identiﬁed with these arrows. For instance, the vector
!
AB is an arrow with tail at the point A and head at the point B. In print, such a vector
is usually denoted by a single letter in boldface type,
B
v

AB:
(See Figure 10.11.) In handwriting, an arrow over a letter (!v D !
AB) can be used to
denote a vector. The magnitude of the vector v is the length of the arrow and is denoted
jvj or j!
ABj.
While vectors have magnitude and direction, they do not generally have position;
that is, they are not regarded as being in a particular place. Two vectors, u and v, are
considered equal if they have the same length and the same direction, even if their
representative arrows do not coincide. The arrows must be parallel, have the same
length, and point in the same direction. In Figure 10.12, for example, if ABYX is a
parallelogram, then !

For the moment we consider plane vectors, that is, vectors whose representative
arrows lie in a plane. If we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system into the plane, we
can talk about the x and y components of any vector. If A D .a; b/ and P D .p; q/,
as shown in Figure 10.13, then the x and y components of !

Vector addition
Given two vectors u and v, their sum u C v is deﬁned as follows. If an arrow
representing v is placed with its tail at the head of an arrow representing u,
then an arrow from the tail of u to the head of v represents u C v. Equiva-
lently, if u and v have tails at the same point, then u C v is represented by
an arrow with its tail at that point and its head at the opposite vertex of the
parallelogram spanned by u and v. This is shown in Figure 10.14(a).

Scalar multiplication
If v is a vector and t is a real number (also called a scalar), then the scalar
multiple tv is a vector with magnitude jtj times that of v and direction the
same as v if t > 0, or opposite to that of v if t < 0. See Figure 10.14(b). If
t D 0, then tv has zero length and therefore no particular direction. It is the
zero vector, denoted 0.
Suppose that u has components a and b and that v has components x and y. Then
the components of u C v are a C x and b C y, and those of tv are tx and ty. See
Figure 10.15.

In R2 we single out two particular vectors for special attention. They are
(i) the vector i from the origin to the point .1; 0/, and
(ii) the vector j from the origin to the point .0; 1/.
Thus, i has components 1 and 0, and j has components 0 and 1. These vectors are
called the standard basis vectors in the plane. The vector r from the origin to the
point .x; y/ has components x and y and can be expressed in the form
r D hx; yi D xi C yj:
In the ﬁrst form we specify the vector by listing its components between angle brackets;
in the second we write r as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors i and
j. (See Figure 10.16.) The vector r is called the position vector of the point .x; y/. A

The zero vector is 0 D 0i C 0j. It has length zero and no speciﬁc direction. For any
vector u we have 0u D 0. A unit vector is a vector of length 1. The standard basis

Vectors in 3-Space
The algebra and geometry of vectors described here extends to spaces of any number
of dimensions; we can still think of vectors as represented by arrows, and sums and
scalar multiples are formed just as for plane vectors.
Given a Cartesian coordinate system in 3-space, we deﬁne three standard ba-
sis vectors, i, j, and k, represented by arrows from the origin to the points .1; 0; 0/,
.0; 1; 0/, and .0; 0; 1/, respectively. (See Figure 10.17.) Any vector in 3-space can be
written as a linear combination of these basis vectors; for instance, the position vector
of the point .x; y; z/ is given by

An aircraft cruises at a speed of 300 km/h in still air. If the wind
is blowing from the east at 100 km/h, in what direction should the
aircraft head in order to ﬂy in a straight line from city P to city Q, 400 km north-
northeast of P ? How long will the trip take?
Solution
The problem is two-dimensional, so we use plane vectors. Let us choose
our coordinate system so that the x- and y-axes point east and north, respectively.
Figure 10.18 illustrates the three velocities that must be considered. The velocity of the
air relative to the ground is
vair rel ground D 100 i:
If the aircraft heads in a direction making angle 
 with the positive direction of the
x-axis, then the velocity of the aircraft relative to the air is

When it is suspended from both ends and allowed to hang under gravity, a heavy cable
or chain assumes the shape of a catenary curve, which is the graph of the hyperbolic
cosine function. We will demonstrate this now, using vectors to keep track of the
various forces acting on the cable.
Suppose that the cable has line density ı (units of mass per unit length) and hangs
as shown in Figure 10.19. Let us choose a coordinate system so that the lowest point
L on the cable is at .0; y0/; we will specify the value of y0 later. If P D .x; y/ is
another point on the cable, there are three forces acting on the arc LP of the cable
between L and P: These are all forces that we can represent using horizontal and
vertical components.
(i) The horizontal tension H D Hi at L. This is the force that the part of the
cable to the left of L exerts on the arc LP at L.
(ii) The tangential tension T D Thi C Tvj. This is the force the part of the cable
to the right of P exerts on arc LP at P:
(iii) The weight W D ıgsj of arc LP; where g is the acceleration of gravity and
s is the length of the arc LP:
Since the cable is not moving, these three forces must balance; their vector sum must
be zero:
T C H C W D 0

to be solved for the equation of the curve along which the hanging cable lies. The
appropriate initial conditions are y D y0 and dy=dx D 0 at x D 0.
Since the differential equation depends on dy=dx rather than y, we substitute
m.x/ D dy=dx and obtain a ﬁrst-order equation for m:

of the hyperbolic sine substitution for m we would have had more trouble here.)

If we choose y0 D y.0/ D 1=a, then, substituting x D 0, we will get C2 D 0. With
this choice of y0, we therefore ﬁnd that the equation of the curve along which the
hanging cable lies is the catenary

Remark
If a hanging cable bears loads other than its own weight, it will assume
a different shape. For example, a cable supporting a level suspension bridge whose
weight per unit length is much greater than that of the cable will assume the shape of
a parabola. See Exercise 34 below.
The Dot Product and Projections
There is another operation on vectors in any dimension by which two vectors are com-
bined to produce a number called their dot product.
DEFINITION
3
The dot product of two vectors
Given two vectors, u D u1i C u2j and v D v1i C v2j in R2, we deﬁne
their dot product u  v to be the sum of the products of their corresponding
components:
u  v D u1v1 C u2v2:
The terms scalar product and inner product are also used in place of dot
product. Similarly, for vectors u D u1iCu2jCu3k and v D v1iCv2jCv3k
in R3,
u  v D u1v1 C u2v2 C u3v3:
The dot product has the following algebraic properties, easily checked using the deﬁ-
nition above:
u  v D v  u
(commutative law);
u  .v C w/ D u  v C u  w
(distributive law);
.tu/  v D u  .tv/ D t.u  v/
(for real t);
u  u D juj2:
The real signiﬁcance of the dot product is shown by the following result, which could
have been used as the deﬁnition of dot product:
T H E O R E M

If  is the angle between the directions of u and v .0    /, then
u  v D jujjvj cos :
In particular, u  v D 0 if and only if u and v are perpendicular. (Of course, the zero
vector is perpendicular to every vector.)

It is sometimes useful to project one vector along another. We deﬁne both scalar and
vector projections of u in the direction of v:
DEFINITION
4
Scalar and vector projections
The scalar projection s of any vector u in the direction of a nonzero vector v
is the dot product of u with a unit vector in the direction of v. Thus, it is the
number
s D u  v
jvj
D juj cos ;
where  is the angle between u and v.
The vector projection, uv, of u in the direction of v (see Figure 10.21)
is the scalar multiple of a unit vector Ov in the direction of v, by the scalar
projection of u in the direction of v; that is,
vector projection of u along v D uv D u  v
jvj
Ov D u  v
jvj2 v:
Note that jsj is the length of the line segment along the line of v obtained by dropping
perpendiculars to that line from the tail and head of u. (See Figure 10.21.) Also, s is
negative if  > 90ı.
It is often necessary to express a vector as a sum of two other vectors parallel and
perpendicular to a given direction.

METHOD II (From basic principles) Since u is parallel to iCj and v is perpendicular
to u, we have
u D t.i C j/

v  .i C j/ D 0;
for some scalar t. We want u C v D 3i C j. Take the dot product of this equation with
i C j:
u  .i C j/ C v  .i C j/ D .3i C j/  .i C j/

Thus 2t D 4, so t D 2. Therefore,

The Cross Product in 3-Space
There is deﬁned, in 3-space only, another kind of product of two vectors called a cross
product or vector product, and denoted u  v.
DEFINITION
5
For any vectors u and v in R3, the cross product u  v is the unique vector
satisfying the following three conditions:
(i) .u  v/  u D 0
and
.u  v/  v D 0,
(ii) ju  vj D jujjvj sin ; where  is the angle between u and v, and
(iii) u, v, and u  v form a right-handed triad.
If u and v are parallel, condition (ii) says that u  v D 0, the zero vector. Otherwise,
through any point in R3 there is a unique straight line that is perpendicular to both u
and v. Condition (i) says that u  v is parallel to this line. Condition (iii) determines
which of the two directions along this line is the direction of u  v; a right-handed
screw advances in the direction of u  v if rotated in the direction from u toward v.
(This is equivalent to saying that the thumb, foreﬁnger, and middle ﬁnger of the right
hand can be made to point in the directions of u, v, and u  v, respectively.)

u  v
u
P
v
Figure 10.22
u  v is perpendicular to
both u and v and has length equal to the
area of the blue shaded parallelogram
If u and v have their tails at the point P , then u  v is normal (i.e., perpendicular)
to the plane through P in which u and v lie and, by condition (ii), u  v has length
equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by u and v. (See Figure 10.22.) These
properties make the cross product very useful for the description of tangent planes and
normal lines to surfaces in R3.
The deﬁnition of cross product given above does not involve any coordinate system
and therefore does not directly show the components of the cross product with respect
to the standard basis. These components are provided by the following theorem.

First, we observe that the vector

Since w is parallel to, and has the same length as, u  v, we must have either u  v D w
or u  v D w. It remains to be shown that the ﬁrst of these is the correct choice. To
see this, suppose that the triad of vectors u, v, and w is rigidly rotated in 3-space so
that u points in the direction of the positive x-axis and v lies in the upper half of the
xy-plane. Then u D u1i, and v D v1i C v2j, where u1 > 0 and v2 > 0. By the “right-
hand rule” u  v must point in the direction of the positive z-axis. But w D u1v2k
does point in that direction, so u  v D w, as asserted.
The formula for the cross product in terms of components may seem awkward and
asymmetric. As we shall see, however, it can be written more easily in terms of a
determinant. We introduce determinants later in this section.

Determinants
In order to simplify certain formulas such as the component representation of the cross
product, we introduce 2  2 and 3  3 determinants. General n  n determinants are
normally studied in courses on linear algebra; we will encounter them in Section 10.7
and later chapters. Here we will outline enough of the properties of determinants to
enable us to use them as shorthand in some otherwise complicated formulas.
A determinant is an expression that involves the elements of a square array (ma-
trix) of numbers. The determinant of the 2  2 array of numbers

Observe that each of the six products in the value of the determinant involves exactly
one element from each row and exactly one from each column of the array. As such,
each term is the product of elements in a diagonal of an extended array obtained by
repeating the ﬁrst two columns of the array to the right of the third column, as shown
in Figure 10.24. The value of the determinant is the sum of products corresponding
to the three complete downward diagonals minus the sum corresponding to the three
upward diagonals. With practice you will be able to form these diagonal products
without having to write the extended array.

The 22 determinants appearing here (called minors of the given 33 determinant) are
obtained by deleting the row and column containing the corresponding element from

in minors about the ﬁrst row.
Such expansions in minors can be carried out about any row or column. Note that
if i C j is an odd number, a minus sign appears in a term obtained by multiplying
the element in the ith row and j th column and its corresponding minor obtained by
deleting that row and column. For example, we can expand the above determinant in

The Cross Product as a Determinant
The elements of a determinant are usually numbers because they have to be multiplied
to get the value of the determinant. However, it is possible to use vectors as the ele-
ments of one row (or column) of a determinant. When expanding in minors about that
row (or column), the minor for each vector element is a number that determines the
scalar multiple of the vector. The formula for the cross product of
u D u1i C u2j C u3k
and
v D v1i C v2j C v3k
presented in Theorem 2 can be expressed symbolically as a determinant with the stan-
dard basis vectors as the elements of the ﬁrst row:

A parallelepiped is the three-dimensional analogue of a parallelogram. It is a solid
with three pairs of parallel planar faces. Each face is in the shape of a parallelogram.
A rectangular brick is a special case of a parallelepiped in which nonparallel faces
intersect at right angles. We say that a parallelepiped is spanned by three vectors
coinciding with three of its edges that meet at one vertex. (See Figure 10.26.)

EXAMPLE 4
Find the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors u, v,
and w.
Solution
The volume of the parallelepiped is equal to the area of one of its faces, say,
the face spanned by v and w, multiplied by the height of the parallelepiped measured
in a direction perpendicular to that face. The area of the face is jv  wj. Since v  w is
perpendicular to the face, the height h of the parallelepiped will be the absolute value
of the scalar projection of u along v  w. If  is the angle between u and v  w, then
the volume of the parallelepiped is given by
Volume D jujj v  wj j cos j D ju  .v  w/j cubic units.

Three vectors are certainly coplanar if any of them is 0, or if any pair of them is
parallel. If neither of these degenerate conditions apply, they are only coplanar if any
one of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the other two. (See Exercise
20 below.)
Applications of Cross Products
Cross products are of considerable importance in mechanics and electromagnetic the-
ory, as well as in the study of motion in general. For example:
(a) The linear velocity v of a particle located at position r in a body rotating with
angular velocity  about the origin is given by v D   r. (See Section 11.2 for
more details.)
(b) The angular momentum of a planet of mass m moving with velocity v in its orbit
around the sun is given by h D r  mv, where r is the position vector of the planet
relative to the sun as origin. (See Section 11.6.)
(c) If a particle of electric charge q is travelling with velocity v through a magnetic
ﬁeld whose strength and direction are given by vector B, then the force that the
ﬁeld exerts on the particle is given by F D qv  B. The electron beam in a tele-
vision tube is controlled by magnetic ﬁelds using this principle.
(d) The torque T of a force F applied at the point P with position vector r about
another point P0 with position vector r0 is deﬁned to be
T D !
P0P  F D .r  r0/  F:
This torque measures the effectiveness of the force F in causing rotation about P0.
The direction of T is along the axis through P0 about which F acts to rotate P:
EXAMPLE 5
An automobile wheel has centre at the origin and axle along the
y-axis. One of the retaining nuts holding the wheel is at position
P0 D .0; 0; 10/. (Distances are measured in centimetres.) A bent tire wrench with arm
25 cm long and inclined at an angle of 60ı to the direction of its handle is ﬁtted to the
nut in an upright direction, as shown in Figure 10.27. If a horizontal force F D 500i
newtons (N) is applied to the handle of the wrench, what is its torque on the nut?
What part (component) of this torque is effective in trying to rotate the nut about its
horizontal axis? What is the effective torque trying to rotate the wheel?
Solution
The nut is at position r0 D 10k, and the handle of the wrench is at position
r D 25 cos 60ıj C .10 C 25 sin 60ı/k  12:5j C 31:65k:

which is at right angles to F and to the arm of the wrench. Only the horizontal com-
ponent of this torque is effective in turning the nut. This component is 10,825 Ncm
or 108.25 Nm in magnitude. For the effective torque on the wheel itself, we have to
replace r0 by 0, the position of the centre of the wheel. In this case the horizontal
torque is
31:65k  500i  15;825j;
that is, about 158.25 Nm.

Planes and Lines
A single equation in the three variables, x, y, and z, constitutes a single constraint on
the freedom of the point P D .x; y; z/ to lie anywhere in 3-space. Such a constraint
usually results in the loss of exactly one degree of freedom and so forces P to lie on a
two-dimensional surface. For example, the equation
x2 C y2 C z2 D 4
states that the point .x; y; z/ is at distance 2 from the origin. All points satisfying this
condition lie on a sphere (i.e., the surface of a ball) of radius 2 centred at the origin.
The equation above therefore represents that sphere, and the sphere is the graph of the
equation. In this section we will investigate the graphs of linear equations in three
variables.
Planes in 3-Space
Let P0 D .x0; y0; z0/ be a point in R3 with position vector
r0 D x0i C y0j C z0k:
If n D Ai C Bj C Ck is any given nonzero vector, then there exists exactly one plane
(ﬂat surface) passing through P0 and perpendicular to n. We say that n is a normal
vector to the plane. The plane is the set of all points P for which !
P0P is perpendicular
to n. (See Figure 10.28.)
If P D .x; y; z/ has position vector r, then !
P0P D r  r0. This vector is per-
pendicular to n if and only if n  .r  r0/ D 0. This is the equation of the plane in
vector form. We can rewrite it in terms of coordinates to obtain the corresponding
scalar equation.

CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space
The scalar form can be written more simply in the standard form AxCByCCz D D,
where D D Ax0 C By0 C Cz0.
If at least one of the constants A, B, and C is not zero, then the linear equation
Ax C By C Cz D D always represents a plane in R3. For example, if A ¤ 0, it
represents the plane through .D=A; 0; 0/ with normal vector n D Ai C Bj C Ck. A
vector normal to a plane can always be determined from the coefﬁcients of x, y, and
z. If the constant term D D 0, then the plane must pass through the origin.
EXAMPLE 1
(Recognizing and writing the equations of planes)
(a) The equation 2x  3y  4z D 0 represents a plane that passes through the origin
and is normal (perpendicular) to the vector n D 2i  3j  4k.
(b) The plane that passes through the point .2; 0; 1/ and is perpendicular to the straight
line passing through the points .1; 1; 0/ and .4; 1; 2/ has normal vector n D
.4  1/i C .1  1/j C .2  0/k D 3i  2j  2k. Therefore, its equation is
3.x  2/  2.y  0/  2.z  1/ D 0, or, more simply, 3x  2y  2z D 4.
(c) The plane with equation 2x  y D 1 has a normal 2i  j that is perpendicular to
the z-axis. The plane is therefore parallel to the z-axis. Note that the equation is
independent of z. In the xy-plane, the equation 2x  y D 1 represents a straight
line; in 3-space it represents a plane containing that line and parallel to the z-axis.
What does the equation y D z represent in R3? the equation y D 2?
(d) The equation 2x Cy C3z D 6 represents a plane with normal n D 2iCjC3k. In
this case we cannot directly read from the equation the coordinates of a particular
point on the plane, but it is not difﬁcult to discover some points. For instance, if
we put y D z D 0 in the equation we get x D 3, so .3; 0; 0/ is a point on the plane.
We say that the x-intercept of the plane is 3 since .3; 0; 0/ is the point where the
plane intersects the x-axis. Similarly, the y-intercept is 6 and the z-intercept is 2
because the plane intersects the y- and z-axes at .0; 6; 0/ and .0; 0; 2/, respectively.
(e) In general, if a, b, and c are all nonzero, the plane with intercepts a, b, and c on
the coordinate axes has equation

then, for any value of the real number , the equation
Figure 10.30
A pencil of planes
A1x C B1y C C1z  D1 C .A2x C B2y C C2z  D2/ D 0
represents a plane in the pencil. To see this, observe that the equation is linear, and so
represents a plane, and that any point .x; y; z/ satisfying the equations of both given
planes also satisﬁes this equation for any value of . Any plane in the pencil except the
second deﬁning plane, A2x CB2y CC2z D D2, can be obtained by suitably choosing
the value of .
EXAMPLE 4
Find an equation of the plane passing through the line of intersec-
tion of the two planes
x C y  2z D 6
and
2x  y C z D 2
and also passing through the point .2; 0; 1/.
Solution
For any constant , the equation
x C y  2z  6 C .2x  y C z  2/ D 0
represents a plane and is satisﬁed by the coordinates of all points on the line of inter-
section of the given planes. This plane passes through the point .2; 0; 1/ if 2  2 
6C.4C12/ D 0, that is, if  D 2. The equation of the required plane therefore
simpliﬁes to 3x  3y C 4z C 2 D 0. (This solution would not have worked if the given
point had been on the second plane, 2x  y C z D 2. Why?)
Lines in 3-Space
As we observed above, any two nonparallel planes in R3 determine a unique (straight)
line of intersection, and a vector parallel to this line can be obtained by taking the cross
product of normal vectors to the two planes.
Suppose that r0 D x0i C y0j C z0k is the position vector of point P0 and v D
ai C bj C ck is a nonzero vector. There is a unique line passing through P0 parallel
to v. If r D xi C yj C zk is the position vector of any other point P on the line, then
r  r0 lies along the line and so is parallel to v. (See Figure 10.31.) Thus, r  r0 D tv
for some real number t. This equation, usually rewritten in the form

596
CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space
r D r0 C tv;
is called the vector parametric equation of the straight line. All points on the line
can be obtained as the parameter t ranges from 1 to 1. The vector v is called a
direction vector of the line.

Breaking the vector parametric equation down into its components yields the
scalar parametric equations of the line:
( x D x0 C at
y D y0 C bt
.1 < t < 1/
z D z0 C ct:
These appear to be three linear equations, but the parameter t can be eliminated to give
two linear equations in x, y, and z. If a ¤ 0, b ¤ 0, and c ¤ 0, then we can solve
each of the scalar equations for t and so obtain
x  x0
a
D y  y0
b
D z  z0
c
;
which is called the standard form for the equations of the straight line through .x0; y0; z0/
parallel to v. The standard form must be modiﬁed if any component of v vanishes. For
example, if c D 0, the equations are
x  x0
a
D y  y0
b
;
z D z0:
Note that none of the above equations for straight lines is unique; each depends on the
particular choice of the point .x0; y0; z0/ on the line. In general, you can always use
the equations of two nonparallel planes to represent their line of intersection.

EXAMPLE 6
Find a direction vector for the line of intersection of the two planes

Solution
The two planes have respective normals n1 D i C j  k and n2 D j C 2k.
Thus, a direction vector of their line of intersection is
v D n1  n2 D 3i  2j C k:
We need to know one point on the line in order to write equations in standard form.
We can ﬁnd a point by assigning a value to one coordinate and calculating the other
two from the given equations. For instance, taking z D 0 in the two equations we are
led to y D 6 and x D 6, so .6; 6; 0/ is one point on the line. Thus, the line has
standard form equations
x C 6

This answer is not unique; the coordinates of any other point on the line could be
used in place of .6; 6; 0/. You could even ﬁnd a direction vector v by subtracting the
position vectors of two different points on the line.
Distances
The distance between two geometric objects always means the minimum distance be-
tween two points, one in each object. In the case of ﬂat objects like lines and planes
deﬁned by linear equations, such minimum distances can usually be determined by
geometric arguments without having to use calculus.

33. Why does the factored second-degree equation
.A1x C B1y C C1z  D1/.A2x C B2y C C2z  D2/ D 0
represent a pair of planes rather than a single straight line?
10.5
Quadric Surfaces
The most general second-degree equation in three variables is
Ax2 C By2 C Cz2 C Dxy C Exz C Fyz C Gx C Hy C Iz D J:
We will not attempt the (rather difﬁcult) task of classifying all the surfaces that can be
represented by such an equation, but will examine some interesting special cases. Let
us observe at the outset that if the above equation can be factored in the form
.A1x C B1y C C1z  D1/.A2x C B2y C C2z  D2/ D 0;
then the graph is, in fact, a pair of planes,
A1x C B1y C C1z D D1
and
A2x C B2y C C2z D D2;
or one plane if the two linear equations represent the same plane. This is considered a
degenerate case. Where such factorization is not possible, the surface (called a quadric
surface) will not be ﬂat, although there may still be straight lines that lie on the surface.
Nondegenerate quadric surfaces fall into the following six categories:
Spheres. The equation x2 C y2 C z2 D a2 represents a sphere of radius a centred at
the origin. More generally,
.x  x0/2 C .y  y0/2 C .z  z0/2 D a2
represents a sphere of radius a centred at the point .x0; y0; z0/. If a quadratic equation
in x, y, and z has equal coefﬁcients for the x2, y2, and z2 terms and has no other
second-degree terms, then it will represent, if any surface at all, a sphere. The centre
can be found by completing the squares as for circles in the plane.

SECTION 10.5:
Quadric Surfaces
601
Cylinders. The equation x2 C y2 D a2, being independent of z, represents a right-
circular cylinder of radius a and axis along the z-axis. (See Figure 10.34(a).) The
intersection of the cylinder with the horizontal plane z D k is the circle with equations

x2 C y2 D a2
z D k:
Quadric cylinders also come in other shapes: elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. For
instance, z D x2 represents a parabolic cylinder with vertex line along the y-axis. (See
Figure 10.34(b).) In general, an equation in two variables only will represent a cylinder
in 3-space.

Cones. The equation z2 D x2 C y2 represents a right-circular cone with axis along
the z-axis. The surface is generated by rotating about the z-axis the line z D y in
the yz-plane. This generator makes an angle of 45ı with the axis of the cone. Cross-
sections of the cone in planes parallel to the xy-plane are circles. (See Figure 10.35(a).)
The equation x2 C y2 D a2z2 also represents a right-circular cone with vertex at the
origin and axis along the z-axis but having semi-vertical angle ˛ D tan1 a. A circular
cone has plane cross-sections that are elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Conversely,
any nondegenerate quadric cone has a direction perpendicular to which the cross-
sections of the cone are circular. In that sense, every quadric cone is a circular cone,
although it may be oblique rather than right-circular in that the line joining the centres
of the circular cross-sections need not be perpendicular to those cross-sections. (See
Exercise 24.)

y  b, c  z  c. If a D b D c, the ellipsoid is a sphere. In general, all plane
cross-sections of ellipsoids are ellipses. This is easy to see for cross-sections parallel
to coordinate planes, but somewhat harder to see for other planes.
Paraboloids. The equations

represent, respectively, an elliptic paraboloid and a hyperbolic paraboloid. (See
Figure 10.36(a) and (b).) Cross-sections in planes z D k (k being a positive constant)
are ellipses (circles if a D b) and hyperbolas, respectively. Parabolic reﬂective mirrors
have the shape of circular paraboloids. The hyperbolic paraboloid is a ruled surface.
(A ruled surface is one through every point of which there passes a straight line lying
wholly on the surface. Cones and cylinders are also examples of ruled surfaces.) There
are two one-parameter families of straight lines that lie on the hyperbolic paraboloid:

Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
Polar coordinates provide a useful alternative to plane Cartesian coordinates for de-
scribing plane regions with circular symmetry or bounded by arcs of circles centred

604
CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space
at the origin and radial lines from the origin. Similarly, there are two commonly en-
countered alternatives to Cartesian coordinates in 3-space. They generalize plane polar
coordinates to 3-space and are suitable for describing regions with cylindrical or spher-
ical symmetry. We introduce these two coordinate systems here, but won’t make much
use of them until the latter part of Chapter 14 when we will learn how to integrate over
such regions.
Cylindrical Coordinates
Among the most useful alternatives to Cartesian coordinates in 3-space is the coor-
dinate system that directly generalizes plane polar coordinates by replacing only the
horizontal x and y coordinates with the polar coordinates r and , while leaving the
vertical z coordinate untouched. This system is called cylindrical coordinates. Each
point in 3-space has cylindrical coordinates Œr; ; z related to its Cartesian coordinates
.x; y; z/ by the transformation
x D r cos ;

Just as planes with equations x D x0, y D y0, and z D z0 are the coordinate sur-

also the coordinate surfaces containing the point Œr0; 0; z0 in cylindrical coordinates
(see Figure 10.39) are:
the r-surface with equations r D r0 (the blue vertical circular cylinder centred on
the z-axis),
the -surface  D 0 (the yellow vertical half-plane with edge along the z-axis),
and
the z-surface z D z0 (the red horizontal plane).

SECTION 10.6:
Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

Cylindrical coordinates lend themselves to representing domains that are bounded by
such surfaces and, in particular, to problems with axial symmetry (around the z-axis).
The coordinate curves in the cylindrical coordinate system are intersections of
pairs of coordinate surfaces.
The r-curves are the intersections of the planes  D constant and z D constant,
and so are horizontal radial lines emanating from the z-axis.
The -curves are intersections of the cylinders r D constant and planes z D
constant, and so are horizontal circles centred on the z-axis.
The z-curves are intersections of the cylinders r D constant and the half-planes
 D constant, and so are vertical straight lines.
EXAMPLE 2
Identify the surfaces whose equations in cylindrical coordinates
are:
(a)
z D r2,
(b)
z D r cos ,
(c)
r D 2 cos .
Solution
(a) z D r2 represents the circular paraboloid with Cartesian equation z D x2 C y2.
It has vertex at the origin and axis of symmetry along the positive z-axis.
(b) z D r cos  represents the plane with Cartesian equation z D x. It contains the
y-axis and the point with Cartesian coordinates .1; 0; 1/.
(c) r D 2 cos  can be rewritten r2 D 2r cos , so represents the vertical surface
with Cartesian equation x2 C y2 D 2x. This is a circular cylinder of radius 1
with central axis along the vertical line through the point .1; 0; 0/ (in Cartesian
coordinates).

generator of the cone, the intersection must be a parabola rather than an ellipse or
a hyperbola. (See Section 8.1.)

a sphere of radius 2 centred at the origin. Thus, this curve is the semicircle with

Spherical Coordinates
In the system of spherical coordinates a point P in 3-space is represented by the
ordered triple ŒR; ; , where R is the distance from P to the origin O,  (Greek
“phi”) is the angle the radial line OP makes with the positive direction of the z-axis,
and  is the angle between the plane containing P and the z-axis and the xz-plane.
(See Figure 10.40.) It is conventional to consider spherical coordinates restricted in
such a way that R  0, 0    , and 0   < 2 (or  <   ). Every point
not on the z-axis then has exactly one spherical coordinate representation, and the
transformation from Cartesian coordinates .x; y; z/ to spherical coordinates ŒR; ; 
is one-to-one off the z-axis. Using the right-angled triangles in the ﬁgure, we can see
that this transformation is given by:

The coordinate surfaces for spherical
coordinates
The coordinate surfaces containing point ŒR0; 0; 0 in spherical coordinates are shown
in Figure 10.41. They are:
the R-surface R D R0, the blue sphere centred at the origin,
the -surface  D 0, the red nappe of the circular cone with the z-axis as axis,
and
the -surface  D 0, the yellow vertical half-planes with edge along the z-axis.
Similarly, pairs of coordinate surfaces intersect in coordinate curves along which only
one of the coordinates varies.
The R-curves (along which only R varies) are the intersections of - and
-surfaces, and so are radial lines emanating from the origin.
The -curves (along which only  varies) are the intersections of R- and
-surfaces, and so are vertical semicircles centred at the origin and beginning
and ending on the z-axis.
The -curves (along which only  varies) are the intersections of the R- and
-surfaces, and thus are horizontal circles with centres on the z-axis.
If we take a coordinate system with origin at the centre of the earth, z-axis through

the north pole, and x-axis through the intersection of the Greenwich meridian and the
equator, then the earth’s surface is (roughly speaking) an R-surface. It’s intersections
with the -surfaces are -curves on the earth’s surface and are called parallels of
latitude. The intersections of the surface of the earth with the -surfaces are -curves,
called meridians of longitude. Since latitude is measured from 90ı at the north pole to
90ı at the south pole, while  is measured from 0 at the north pole to  .D 180ı/ at
the south pole, the coordinate  is frequently referred to as the colatitude coordinate;
 is the longitude coordinate. Observe that  has the same signiﬁcance in spherical
coordinates as it does in cylindrical coordinates.
Spherical coordinates are suited to problems involving spherical symmetry and,
in particular, to regions bounded by spheres centred at the origin, circular cones with
axes along the z-axis, and vertical planes containing the z-axis.

(a) the Cartesian coordinates of the point P with spherical coordinates

so  D =4 or 5=4. Since x > 0, we must have  D =4. The spherical
coordinates of Q are Œ2; =4; =4.
Remark
You may wonder why we write spherical coordinates in the order R; ; 
rather than R; ; . The reason, which will not become apparent until Chapter 16,
concerns the triad of unit vectors at any point P , taken in coordinate order and tangent
to the corresponding coordinate curve in the direction of increase of that coordinate.
The order R; ;  ensures that this triad is a right-handed basis rather than a left-
handed one.

A Little Linear Algebra
Differential calculus is essentially the study of linear approximations to functions. The
tangent line to the graph y D f .x/ at x D x0 provides the “best linear approximation”
to f .x/ near x0. Differentiation of functions of several variables can also be viewed
as a process of ﬁnding best linear approximations. Therefore, the language of linear
algebra can be very useful for expressing certain concepts in the calculus of several
variables.
Linear algebra is a vast subject and is usually studied independently of calculus.
This is unfortunate because understanding the relationship between the two subjects
can greatly enhance your understanding and appreciation of each of them. Knowledge
of linear algebra, and therefore familiarity with the material covered in this section,
is not essential for fruitful study of the rest of this book. However, we shall occa-
sionally comment on the signiﬁcance of the subject at hand from the point of view
of linear algebra. To this end we need only a little of the terminology and content of
this subject, especially that part pertaining to matrix manipulation and systems of lin-
ear equations. In the rest of this section we present an outline of this material. Some
students will already be familiar with it; others will encounter it later. We make no
attempt at completeness here and refer interested students to standard linear algebra
texts for proofs of some assertions. Students proceeding beyond this book to further
study of advanced calculus and differential equations will certainly need a much more
extensive background in linear algebra.

though they appear differently as matrices.
Most of the usefulness of matrices depends on the following deﬁnition of matrix
multiplication, which enables two arrays to be combined into a single one in a manner
that preserves linear relationships.
DEFINITION

That is, cij is the dot product of the ith row of A and the j th column of B
(both of which are n-vectors).
Note that only some pairs of matrices can be multiplied. The product AB is only
deﬁned if the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B.

The left factor has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the right factor has 3 rows and 4 columns.
Therefore, the product has 2 rows and 4 columns. The element in the ﬁrst row and third
column of the product, 13, is the dot product of the ﬁrst row, .1; 0; 3/, of the left factor
and the third column, .1; 3; 4/, of the second factor:
1  1 C 0  3 C 3  4 D 13:
With a little practice you can easily calculate the elements of a matrix product by
simultaneously running your left index ﬁnger across rows of the left factor and your
right index ﬁnger down columns of the right factor while taking the dot products.

Matrix multiplication is associative. This means that
A.BC/ D .AB/C
(provided A, B, and C have dimensions compatible with the formation of the various
products); therefore, it makes sense to write ABC. However, matrix multiplication is
not commutative. Indeed, if A is an m  n matrix and B is an n  p matrix, then the
product AB is deﬁned, but the product BA is not deﬁned unless m D p. Even if A
and B are square matrices of the same size, it is not necessarily true that AB D BA.

Determinants and Matrix Inverses
In Section 10.3 we introduced 2  2 and 3  3 determinants as certain algebraic ex-
pressions associated with 2  2 and 3  3 square arrays of numbers. In general, it is
possible to deﬁne the determinant det(A) for any square matrix. For an n  n matrix

We will not attempt to give a formal deﬁnition of the determinant here but will note
that the properties of determinants stated for the 3  3 case in Section 10.3 continue to
be true. In particular, an n  n determinant can be expanded in minors about any row
or column and so expressed as a sum of multiples of .n  1/  .n  1/ determinants.
The expansion in minors of the n  n determinant det.A/ about its ith row is a sum of
n terms:
det.A/ D

where Aij is the .n1/.n1/ determinant obtained by deleting the ith row and j th
column from A. Continuing this process, we can eventually reduce the evaluation of
any n  n determinant to the evaluation of (perhaps many) 2  2 or 3  3 determinants.
It is important to realize that the “diagonal” method for evaluating 2  2 or 3  3
determinants does not extend to 4  4 or higher-order determinants.

Since the third column had only two nonzero elements, the expansion has only two
nonzero terms involving 3  3 determinants. The ﬁrst of these was then expanded
about its second row, and the other about its second column.
In addition to the properties stated in Section 10.3, determinants have two other very
important properties, which are stated in the following theorem.

If A and B are n  n matrices, then
(a)
det.AT / D det.A/ and
(b)
det.AB/ D det.A/det.B/.
We will not attempt any proof of this or other theorems in this section. The reader is
referred to texts on linear algebra. Part (a) is not very difﬁcult to prove, even in the case
of general n. Part (b) cannot really be proved in general without a formal deﬁnition
of determinant. However, the reader should verify (b) for 2  2 matrices by direct
calculation.
We say that the square matrix A is singular if det.A/ D 0. If det.A/ ¤ 0, we
say that A is nonsingular or invertible.
Remark
If A is a 33 matrix, then det(A) is the scalar triple product of the rows of
A, and its absolute value is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those rows.
Therefore, A is nonsingular if and only if its rows span a parallelepiped of positive
volume; the row vectors cannot all lie in the same plane. The same may be said of the
columns of A.
In general, an n  n matrix is singular if its rows (or columns), considered as
vectors, satisfy one or more linear equations of the form
c1x1 C c2x2 C    C cnxn D 0;
with at least one nonzero coefﬁcient ci. A set of vectors satisfying such a linear equa-
tion is called linearly dependent because one of the vectors can always be expressed
as a linear combination of the others; if c1 ¤ 0, then

All linear combinations of the vectors in a linearly dependent set of n vectors in Rn
must lie in a subspace of dimension lower than n. Conversely, a set of m vectors in Rn
(where m  n) is called linearly independent if the only linear combination of them
that equals the zero vector is the one with all coefﬁcients equal to zero; that is

Generally, matrix inversion is not carried out by the method of Example 5 but
rather by an orderly process of performing operations on the rows of the matrix to
transform it into the identity. When the same operations are performed on the rows
of the identity matrix, the inverse of the original matrix results. See a text on linear
algebra for a description of the method. A singular matrix has no inverse.

We say that F is a matrix representation of the linear transformation F. If m D n so
that F maps Rm into itself, then F is a square matrix. In this case F is nonsingular if
and only if F is one-to-one and has the whole of Rm as range.
A composition of linear transformations is still a linear transformation and will
have a matrix representation. The real motivation lying behind the deﬁnition of matrix
multiplication is that the matrix representation of a composition of linear transforma-

being composed.

Compare the equation Ax D b with the equation ax D b for a single unknown x. The
equation ax D b has the unique solution x D a1b provided a ¤ 0. By analogy, the
linear system Ax D b has a unique solution given by
x D A1b;
provided A is nonsingular. To see this, just multiply both sides of the equation Ax D b
on the left by A1; x D Ix D A1Ax D A1b.
If A is singular, then the system Ax D b may or may not have a solution, and
if a solution exists it will not be unique. Consider the case b D 0 (the zero vector).
Then any vector x perpendicular to all the rows of A will satisfy the system. Since the
rows of A lie in a space of dimension less than n (because det.A/ D 0), there will
be at least a line of such vectors x. Thus, solutions of Ax D 0 are not unique if A is
singular. The same must be true of the system AT y D 0; there will be nonzero vectors
y satisfying it if A is singular. But then, if the system Ax D b has any solution x, we
must have
.y  b/ D yT b D yT Ax D .xT AT y/T D .xT 0/T D .0/:
Hence, Ax D b can only have solutions for those vectors b that are perpendicular to
every solution y of AT y D 0.
A system of m linear equations in n unknowns may or may not have any solutions
if n < m. It will have solutions if some mn of the equations are linear combinations
(sums of multiples) of the other n equations. If n > m, then we can try to solve
the m equations for m of the variables, allowing the solutions to depend on the other
n  m variables. Such a solution exists if the determinant of the coefﬁcients of the m
variables for which we want to solve is not zero. This is a special case of the Implicit
Function Theorem, which we will examine in Section 12.8.

The following example provides a concrete illustration of the use of Cramer’s Rule
to solve a speciﬁc linear system. However, Cramer’s Rule is primarily used in a more

Quadratic Forms, Eigenvalues, and Eigenvectors
If x is a column vector in Rn and A D

is an n  n, real, symmetric matrix (i.e.,
aij D aji for 1  i; j  n), then the expression
Q.x/ D xT Ax D

i;j D1
aij xixj
is called a quadratic form on Rn corresponding to the matrix A. Observe that Q.x/
is a real number for every n-vector x.
We say that A is positive deﬁnite if Q.x/ > 0 for every nonzero vector x. Simi-
larly, A is negative deﬁnite if Q.x/ < 0 for every nonzero vector x. We say that A is
positive semideﬁnite (or negative semideﬁnite) if Q.x/  0 (or Q.x/  0) for every
nonzero vector x.
If Q.x/ > 0 for some nonzero vectors x while Q.x/ < 0 for other such x (i.e., if
A is neither positive semideﬁnite nor negative semideﬁnite), then we will say that A
is indeﬁnite.

Observe how the elements of the matrix are obtained from the coefﬁcients of Q; the
coefﬁcients of x2, y2, and z2 form the main diagonal elements, while the coefﬁcients
of the product terms are cut in half and half is put in each of the two corresponding
symmetric off-diagonal positions.
The matrix A is positive deﬁnite since Q.x; y; z/ can be rewritten in the form
Q.x; y; z/ D x2 C .x  y/2 C .x C 2z/2 C .y C z/2;
from which it is apparent that Q.x; y; z/  0 for all .x; y; z/ and Q.x; y; z/ D 0 only
if x D y D z D 0.
In Section 13.1 we will use the positive or negative deﬁniteness of certain matrices to
classify critical points of functions of several variables as local maxima and minima.
Useful criteria for deﬁniteness can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the
matrix A.
We say that  is an eigenvalue of the nn square matrix A D .aij / if there exists
a nonzero column vector x such that Ax D x, or, equivalently,
.A  I/x D 0;
where I is the n  n identity matrix. The nonzero vector x is called an eigenvector of
A corresponding to the eigenvalue  and can exist only if AI is a singular matrix,

Using Maple for Vector and Matrix Calculations
The use of a computer algebra system can free us from much of the tedious calculation
needed to do calculus. This is especially true of calculations in multivariable and vector
calculus, where the calculations can quickly become unmanageable as the number of
variables increases. This author’s colleague, Dr. Robert Israel, has written an excellent
book, Calculus, the Maple Way, to show how Maple can be used effectively for doing
calculus involving both single-variable and multivariable functions.
In this book we will occasionally call on the power of Maple to carry out calcu-
lations involving functions of several variables and vector-valued functions of one or
more variables. This section illustrates some of the most basic techniques for calculat-
ing with vectors and matrices. The examples here were calculated using Maple 10, but
Maple 6 or later should give similar output.
Most of Maple’s capability to deal with vectors and matrices is not in its kernel
but is written into a package of procedures called LinearAlgebra. Therefore, it is
customary to load this package at the beginning of a session where it will be needed:
>
with(LinearAlgebra):
One usually completes a Maple command with a semicolon rather than a colon. You

SECTION 10.8:
Using Maple for Vector and Matrix Calculations
619
can use a colon to suppress output. Had we used a semicolon to complete the command
the result would have produced a list of all the procedures deﬁned in the LinearAlgebra
package.
Maple also includes a second linear algebra package called linalg, but it is inferior
to LinearAlgebra, especially for heavy-duty numerical calculations using large matri-
ces; it is also somewhat more difﬁcult to use. However, the linalg package was present
in releases of Maple earlier than release 6 and is still present in release 9. We will
not make any use of linalg here, but it was used instead of LinearAlgebra in the ﬁfth
edition of this book.
Vectors
There are several ways to deﬁne vectors in Maple; the easiest are to use the
Vector([,]) or <,> constructions, where a comma-separated list of the compo-
nents of the vector is placed in the square or angle brackets. Both of these constructions
produce column vectors:
>
Uc := Vector([1,2,3]); Vc := <a,b,c>;
Uc WD
2
4
1
2
3
3
5
Vc WD
2
4
a
b
c
3
5
You can use Vector[row]([,]) to produce a row vector; alternatively, you can
deﬁne a row vector using angle brackets with “j” to separate the components:
>
Ur := Vector[row]([1,2,3]); Vr := <a|b|c>;
Ur WD Œ1; 2; 3
V r WD Œa; b; c
Vectors can be of any dimension; simply include the appropriate number of commas
or j separated components. You can also use the Vector() construct with two ar-
guments, the ﬁrst a positive integer giving the dimension of the vector and the second
either a square-bracket-enclosed list of components or an assignment rule giving the
value of the ith component:
>
<5|-2|3|x>; W := Vector[row](5, i -> i^2);
Œ5; 2; 3; x
W WD Œ1; 4; 9; 16; 25
We can also construct a vector with arbitrary components like this:
>
X := Vector(2, symbol=x);
Y := Vector[row](4, symbol=y);
X WD
 x1
x2

Y WD Œy1; y2; y3; y4
The components of a vector can be referenced by appending the index of the compo-
nent, enclosed in square brackets, to the name or constructor of the vector. The fourth
component of vector W above is W[4]:
>
W[4]; Vector(16, i -> 3*i - 1)[10]; X[2]+Y[3];

620
CHAPTER 10
Vectors and Coordinate Geometry in 3-Space

x2 C y3
Vectors of the same dimension and type (row or column) can be added, subtracted, and
multiplied by scalars using the ordinary operators C, , and :
>
Uc + Vc; Vc - 3*Uc;
2

For most vector calculations it doesn’t matter whether you think of vectors as row or
column vectors, but it does make a difference for some LinearAlgebra operators; if you
try to add a row vector to a column vector, or two vectors of different dimensions, you
will get an error message.
The LinearAlgebra package also deﬁnes the product functions DotProduct and
CrossProduct, each of which takes two vector arguments. For DotProduct, the
arguments must be of the same but arbitrary dimension. For CrossProduct, both argu-
ments must have dimension 3. However, neither requires both arguments to be of the
same type (row or column). The cross product will be a column vector unless both its
arguments are row vectors.
As deﬁned in the LinearAlgebra package, DotProduct can produce some strange
results. Consider the following:
>
DotProduct(Uc,Vc); DotProduct(Vc,Uc);
DotProduct(Ur,Vr);
a C 2b C 3c
Na C 2Nb C 3Nc
Na C 2Nb C 3Nc
What is going on here? The bars on the unknown quantities a, b, and c denote complex
conjugates of these quantities. The LinearAlgebra package is designed to meet the
needs of a great many users of linear algebra, not just calculus students for whom all
vectors are assumed to have real components. In fact, DotProduct(U,V) sums
the products of the complex congugates of the components of U and the unconjugated
components of V if both vectors are column vectors, and vice versa if both are row
vectors. In the ﬁrst example above, the components of Uc are real numbers, so no
conjugates appeared over them; in the other two cases it is the components of Vc or Vr
that require conjugation, and since Maple doesn’t know that these are real, it puts on the
bars. To avoid this difﬁculty when using real vectors, include “conjugate=false”
as a third argument when using DotProduct from the LinearAlgebra package:
>
DotProduct(Ur,Vr, conjugate=false);
a C 2b C 3c
It is also possible to use a dot “.” as a binary operator to calculate a dot product.
However, dot also represents matrix multiplication, so you must use a row vector to the
left of the dot and a column vector to the right to be sure of getting a dot product.

LinearAlgebra also has a CrossProduct function, which applies only to 3-vectors.
It does not matter whether either of the arguments is a row or column vector. This
function can be called using either CrossProduct(U,V) or U &x V.

LinearAlgebra has a function Norm() for calculating the length of a vector. Unfor-
tunately, Maple knows many different deﬁnitions for the length of a vector. The one
we use is the Euclidean length. The Euclidean length of a vector V is calculated by
Norm(V,Euclidean) or Norm(V,2). (In the latter case the 2 stands for the fact
that we use the square root of the sum of the squares of the components to ﬁnd the
length.)

You can use Normalize(U,Euclidean) or Normalize(U,2) to ﬁnd a unit
vector in the same direction as U. Of course, you could always just multiply U by the
scalar, which is the reciprocal of its length:

radian measure, so you will have to multiply it by 180= to get the angle in degrees.

or, as we would write it, 10x  11y C 13z D 4. Note how we used the cross product
of two row vectors (which is itself, therefore, a row vector) to the left of the “.” and a
difference of two column vectors (which is itself a column vector) to the right of the
“.” for calculating the dot product.
Finally, let us use Maple to verify the identity
.U  V/  W D .W  U/V  .W  V/U:
First, we deﬁne U, V, and W to be vectors with arbitrary components. In view of the
two dot products on the right-hand side of the identity, we make W a row vector and
the other two column vectors:
>
U := Vector(3,symbol=u);
V := Vector(3, symbol=v);
W := Vector[row](3, symbol=w);

Now we only need to subtract the right side of the identity from the left side and
simplify the result:

simplify((U &x V) &x W - (W . U)*V + (W . V)*U);

The result is the zero vector, thus conﬁrming the identity.
Remark
Maple 8 and later releases have a new package called VectorCalculus, which
provides greater functionality than the LinearAlgebra package for dealing with vector-
valued functions and functions of vector variables. We will be illustrating the use of
this package in later chapters, but note here that it also deﬁnes the vector operations
considered above but not all of the matrix functions considered below. VectorCalculus
reports vectors as linear combinations of basis vectors rather than as row or column
matrices. The default bases it uses consist of vectors ex, ey, ez (rather than i, j, k)
for vectors of dimension up to 3, but ex1; ex2; : : : for dimensions higher than 3. Nev-
ertheless, although it is not apparent from the way VectorCalculus displays vectors, it
still maintains the distinction between row and column vectors and won’t let you add
a row vector to a column vector. A big advantage of the VectorCalculus package over
LinearAlgebra is that VectorCalculus uses the usual deﬁnition of dot product (even
when using the “.” notation), so that the order of factors in a dot product is irrelevant
and no complex conjugation is used. If you want to use the VectorCalculus package
and still have access to all the matrix operations provided by LinearAlgebra, load the
VectorCalculus package after the LinearAlgebra package, so that its new deﬁnitions of
vector operations will replace those of the LinearAlgebra package.

Because V1 is a column vector and V2 is a row vector, any attempt to calculate a
linear combination of these vectors will generate an error, as will attempts to calculate
M.V2 or V1.M if M is a 3  3 matrix. Of course, M.V1 will work ﬁne, as will V2.M,
although the result will be a one-row matrix rather than a vector. We will examine
VectorCalculus further in later chapters.
Matrices
The LinearAlgebra package also provides a variety of ways to deﬁne and manipulate
matrices. We can deﬁne a matrix as a column vector whose elements are row vectors,
or as a row vector whose elements are column vectors:
>
«1|1|1>,<2|1|3»; «1,2>|<1,1>|<1,3»;

You can also use the Matrix function to deﬁne a matrix. This function can either be
supplied with a list of lists specifying the rows of the matrix, or two positive integers
(the number of rows and columns, respectively) and a rule for calculating the element
in the ith row and j th column.

Linear Equations
A set of n linear equations in n variables can be written in the form AX D B, where
A is an n  n matrix and X and B are column n-vectors. Thus, the solution can be
calculated as X D A1B. For example, the system
x C y C z D 2;
2x C y C 3z D 9;
x C y C 2z D 1

SECTION 10.8:

that is, x D 9, y D 6, z D 1. LinearAlgebra provides a simpler way of solving the

LinearSolve is better at solving linear systems than is matrix inversion, since it can
solve some systems for which the matrix is singular or not square. Consider the two
systems
x C y D 1
2x C 2y D 2
and
x C y D 1
2x C 2y D 1
The ﬁrst system has a one-parameter family of solutions x D 1 t, y D t for arbitrary
t. The second system is inconsistent and has no solutions.

The extra argument free=t was included to force LinearSolve to use subscripted t
variables for any parameters. It is always safe to include an argument of this type;
omitting it can cause output that looks somewhat strange. (Try it and see.) If the
system has a unique solution, the free=t parameter will just be ignored.

vectors of matrices. For a real symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are always real.

The Eigenvalues function produces a column vector of the eigenvalues of the
square matrix that is its argument. In this example all three eigenvalues are positive,
so K is a positive deﬁnite matrix. Our main use for eigenvalues will be the classiﬁ-
cation of critical points of functions of several variables. This use does not require
knowledge of the corresponding eigenvectors, but if we did need to know them, we
could have used the function Eigenvectors(K) instead. The output would then
have consisted of two items separated by a comma. The ﬁrst item would be the column
vector of eigenvalues of K; the second would be a square matrix whose columns are
the eigenvectors corresponding to those eigenvalues. (Corresponding to an eigenvalue
having multiplicity m there would be m linearly independent columns in the matrix.)

Maple isn’t always good at spotting simpliﬁcations. If you follow the above Maple
command with simplify(%[2]), you will see that the top row in the matrix of
eigenvectors is, in fact, much simpler than it looks.
Remark
All the matrices and vectors used in the examples of this section were
of very small dimension.
The LinearAlgebra package is capable of dealing with
large matrices with hundreds of rows and columns, but for such matrices it is best
to avoid simple expressions like 2*M-3*N and M.N for linear combinations and prod-
ucts of matrices, and use instead MatrixAdd(M,N,2,-3) and MatrixMatrix-
Multiply(M,N), which are much more efﬁcient in their calculations. Similarly,
use MatrixVectorMultiply(M,X) rather than M.X if X is a column vector and
ScalarMultiply(M,c) rather than c*M if c is a number.

Introduction
This chapter is concerned with functions of a single real
variable that have vector values. Such functions can be
thought of as parametric representations of curves, and we will examine them from
both a kinematic point of view (involving position, velocity, and acceleration of a mov-
ing particle) and a geometric point of view (involving tangents, normals, curvature,
and torsion). Finally, we will work through a simple derivation of Kepler’s laws of
planetary motion.
11.1
Vector Functions of One Variable
In this section we will examine several aspects of differential and integral calculus
as applied to vector-valued functions of a single real variable. Such functions can
be used to represent curves parametrically. It is natural to interpret a vector-valued
function of the real variable t as giving the position, at time t, of a point or “particle”
moving around in space. Derivatives of this position vector are then other vector-
valued functions giving the velocity and acceleration of the particle. To motivate the
study of vector functions, we will consider such a vectorial description of motion in
3-space. Some of our examples will involve motion in the plane; in this case the third
components of the vectors will be 0 and will be omitted.
If a particle moves around in 3-space, its motion can be described by giving the
three coordinates of its position as functions of time t:
x D x.t/;
y D y.t/;
and
z D z.t/:
It is more convenient, however, to replace these three equations by a single vector
equation,
r D r.t/;
giving the position vector of the moving particle as a function of t. (Recall that the
position vector of a point is the vector from the origin to that point.) In terms of the
standard basis vectors i, j, and k, the position of the particle at time t is

CHAPTER 11

position:
r D r.t/ D x.t/ i C y.t/ j C z.t/ k:
As t increases, the particle moves along a path, a curve C in 3-space. If z.t/ D 0, then
C is a plane curve in the xy-plane. We assume that C is a continuous curve; the particle
cannot instantaneously jump from one point to a distant point. This is equivalent to
requiring that the component functions x.t/, y.t/, and z.t/ are continuous functions
of t, and we therefore say that r.t/ is a continuous vector function of t.
In the time interval from t to t C t, the particle moves from position r.t/ to
position r.t C t/. Therefore, its average velocity is
r.t C t/  r.t/
t
;
which is a vector parallel to the secant vector from r.t/ to r.t C t/. If the average
velocity has a limit as t ! 0, then we say that r is differentiable at t, and we call
the limit the (instantaneous) velocity of the particle at time t. We denote the velocity
vector by v.t/:

This velocity vector has direction tangent to the path C at the point r.t/ (see Figure 11.1),

is called the speed of the particle:
speed:
v.t/ D jv.t/j:
Wherever the velocity vector exists, is continuous, and does not vanish, the path C is
a smooth curve; that is, it has a continuously turning tangent line. The path may not
be smooth at points where the velocity is zero, even if the components of the velocity
vector are smooth functions of t.
EXAMPLE 1
Consider the plane curve r D t3i C t2j. Its component functions
t3 and t2 have continuous derivatives of all orders. However, the
curve is not smooth at the origin (t D 0), where its velocity v D 3t2i C 2tj D 0. (See

Thus, the vector function r is differentiable at t if and only if its three scalar compo-
nents, x, y, and z, are differentiable at t. In general, vector functions can be differ-
entiated (or integrated) by differentiating (or integrating) their component functions,
provided that the basis vectors with respect to which the components are taken are
ﬁxed in space and not changing with time.
Continuing our analysis of the moving particle, we deﬁne the acceleration of the
particle to be the time derivative of the velocity:
acceleration:
a.t/ D dv
dt D d 2r
dt2 :
Newton’s Second Law of Motion asserts that this acceleration is proportional to, and
in the same direction as, the force F causing the motion: if the particle has mass m,
then the law is expressed by the vector equation F D ma.
EXAMPLE 2
Describe the curve r D ti C t2j C t3k. Find the velocity and
acceleration vectors for this curve at .1; 1; 1/.
Solution
Since the scalar parametric equations for the curve are
x D t;
y D t2;
and
z D t3;
which satisfy y D x2 and z D x3, the curve is the curve of intersection of the two
cylinders y D x2 and z D x3. At any time t the velocity and acceleration vectors are
given by
v D dr
dt D i C 2tj C 3t2k;
a D dv

The point .1; 1; 1/ on the curve corresponds to t D 1, so the velocity and acceleration
at that point are v D i C 2j C 3k and a D 2j C 6k, respectively.

Observe that jrj D 5. Therefore, the path of the particle lies on the sphere with
equation x2 C y2 C z2 D 25. Since x D 3 cos !t and y D 4 cos !t, the path also lies
on the vertical plane 4x D 3y. Hence, the particle moves around a circle of radius 5
centred at the origin and lying in the plane 4x D 3y. Observe also that r is periodic
with period 2=!. Therefore, the particle makes one revolution around the circle
in time 2=!. The acceleration is always in the direction of r, that is, toward the
origin. The term centripetal acceleration is used to describe such a “centre-seeking”
acceleration.

Note that we used x as the parameter for the curve in the above example,
so we could use t for time. If you want to analyze motion along a curve r D r.t/,

Differentiating Combinations of Vectors
Vectors and scalars can be combined in a variety of ways to form other vectors or
scalars. Vectors can be added and multiplied by scalars and can be factors in dot and
cross products. Appropriate differentiation rules apply to all such combinations of
vector and scalar functions; we summarize them in the following theorem.

Remark
Formulas (b), (c), and (d) are versions of the Product Rule. Formula (e) is
a version of the Chain Rule. Formula (f) is also a case of the Chain Rule applied to
juj D pu  u. All have the obvious form. Note that the order of the factors is the same
in the terms on both sides of the cross product formula (d). It is essential that the order
be preserved because, unlike the dot product or the product of a vector with a scalar,
the cross product is not commutative.
Remark
The formula for the derivative of a cross product is a special case of that
for the derivative of a 3  3 determinant. (See Section 10.3.) Since every term in
the expansion of a determinant of any order is a product involving one element from
each row (or column), the general Product Rule implies that the derivative of an n  n
determinant whose elements are functions will be the sum of n such nn determinants,
each with the elements of one of the rows (or columns) differentiated. For the 3  3

11.2
Some Applications of Vector Differentiation
Many interesting problems in mechanics involve the differentiation of vector functions.
This section is devoted to a brief discussion of a few of these.
Motion Involving Varying Mass
The momentum p of a moving object is the product of its (scalar) mass m and its
(vector) velocity v; p D mv. Newton’s Second Law of Motion states that the rate of
change of momentum is equal to the external force acting on the object:
F D dp
dt D d
dt

mv

:
It is only when the mass of the object remains constant that this law reduces to the
more familiar F D ma. When mass is changing you must deal with momentum rather
than acceleration.
EXAMPLE 1
(The changing velocity of a rocket) A rocket accelerates by burn-
ing its onboard fuel. If the exhaust gases are ejected with constant
velocity ve relative to the rocket, and if the rocket ejects p% of its initial mass while
its engines are ﬁring, by what amount will the velocity of the rocket change? Assume
the rocket is in deep space so that gravitational and other external forces acting on it
can be neglected.
Solution
Since the rocket is not acted on by any external forces (i.e., F D 0), New-
ton’s law implies that the total momentum of the rocket and its exhaust gases will
remain constant. At time t the rocket has mass m.t/ and velocity v.t/. At time t C t
the rocket’s mass is m C m (where m < 0), its velocity is v C v, and the mass
m of exhaust gases has escaped with velocity vCve (relative to a coordinate system
ﬁxed in space). Equating total momenta at t and t C t we obtain
.m C m/.v C v/ C .m/.v C ve/ D mv:
Simplifying this equation and dividing by t gives
.m C m/v

Remark
It is interesting that this model places no restriction on how great a velocity
the rocket can achieve, provided that a sufﬁciently large percentage of its initial mass
is fuel. See Exercise 1 at the end of the section.
Circular Motion
The angular speed  of a rotating body is its rate of rotation measured in radians per
unit time. For instance, a lighthouse lamp rotating at a rate of three revolutions per
minute has an angular speed of  D 6 radians per minute. It is useful to represent
the rate of rotation of a rigid body about an axis in terms of an angular velocity vector
rather than just the scalar angular speed. The angular velocity vector, , has magnitude
equal to the angular speed, , and direction along the axis of rotation such that if the
extended right thumb points in the direction of , then the ﬁngers surround the axis in
the direction of rotation.
If the origin of the coordinate system is on the axis of rotation, and r D r.t/ is
the position vector at time t of a point P in the rotating body, then P moves around a
circle of radius D D jr.t/j sin , where  is the (constant) angle between  and r.t/.
(See Figure 11.4.) Thus, P travels a distance 2D in time 2=, and its linear speed

Solution
There are two ways to solve this problem. We will do it both ways.
METHOD I. By the discussion above, the given differential equation is consistent
with rotation about the x-axis with angular velocity 2i, so that the angular speed is
2, and the motion is counterclockwise as seen from far out on the positive x-axis.
Therefore, the particle P moves on a circle in a plane x = constant and centred on the
x-axis. Since P is at .1; 3; 0/ at time t D 0, the plane of motion is x D 1, and the
radius of the circle is 3. Therefore, the circle has a parametric equation of the form
r D i C 3 cos.t/j C 3 sin.t/k:

638
CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
P travels once around this circle (2 radians) in time t D 2=, so the angular speed
is . Therefore,  D 2 and the motion of the particle is given by
r D i C 3 cos.2t/j C 3 sin.2t/k:
METHOD II. Break the given vector differential equation into components:

t. Differentiate the second equation with respect to t and substitute the third equation.
This leads to the equation of simple harmonic motion for y,

for which a general solution is

Thus, z D  1
2.dy=dt/ D A sin.2t/  B cos.2t/. Since y.0/ D 3 and z.0/ D 0, we
have A D 3 and B D 0. Thus, the particle P travels counterclockwise around the
circular path
r D i C 3 cos.2t/j C 3 sin.2t/k
in the plane x D 1 with angular speed 2.
Remark
Newton’s Second Law states that F D .d=dt/.mv/ D dp=dt, where
p D mv is the (linear) momentum of a particle of mass m moving under the inﬂuence
of a force F. This law may be reformulated in a manner appropriate for describing
rotational motion as follows. If r.t/ is the position of the particle at time t, then, since

The quantities H D r  .mv/ and T D r  F are, respectively, the angular momentum
of the particle about the origin and the torque of F about the origin. We have shown
that
T D dH

the torque of the external forces is equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum
of the particle. This is the analogue for rotational motion of F D dp=dt.

Rotating Frames and the Coriolis Effect
The procedure of differentiating a vector function by differentiating its components is
valid only if the basis vectors themselves do not depend on the variable of differenti-
ation. In some situations in mechanics this is not the case. For instance, in modelling
large-scale weather phenomena the analysis is affected by the fact that a coordinate
system ﬁxed with respect to the earth is, in fact, rotating (along with the earth) relative
to directions ﬁxed in space.

SECTION 11.2:
Some Applications of Vector Differentiation
639
In order to understand the effect that the rotation of the coordinate system has on
representations of velocity and acceleration, let us consider two Cartesian coordinate
frames (i.e., systems of axes with corresponding unit basis vectors), a “ﬁxed” frame
with basis fI; J; Kg, not rotating with the earth, and a rotating frame with basis fi; j; kg
attached to the earth and therefore rotating with the same angular speed as the earth,
namely, =12 radians/hour. Let us take the origin of the ﬁxed frame to be at the
centre of the earth, with K pointing north. Then the angular velocity of the earth is
 D .=12/K. The ﬁxed frame is being carried along with the earth in its orbit around
the sun, but it is not rotating with the earth, and, since the earth’s orbital rotation around
the sun has angular speed only 1/365th of the angular speed of its rotation about its
axis, we can ignore the much smaller effect of the motion of the earth along its orbit.
Let us take the origin of the rotating frame to be at the location of an observer on
the surface of the earth, say, at point P0 with position vector R0 with respect to the
ﬁxed frame.1 Assume that P0 has colatitude  (the angle between R0 and K) satisfying
0 <  < , so that P0 is not at either the north pole or the south pole. Let us assume
that i and j point, respectively, due east and north at P0. Thus, k must point directly
upward there. (See Figure 11.5.)

Since each of the vectors i, j, k, and R0 is rotating with the earth (with angular

Any vector function can be expressed in terms of either basis. Let us denote by R.t/,
V.t/, and A.t/ the position, velocity, and acceleration of a moving object with respect
to the ﬁxed frame, and by r.t/, v.t/, and a.t/ the same quantities with respect to the
rotating frame. Thus,

The term 2  v is called the Coriolis acceleration, and the term   .  R/ is
called the centripetal acceleration.
Suppose our moving object has mass m and is acted on by an external force F. By
Newton’s Second Law,
F D mA D ma C 2m  v C m  .  R/;
or, equivalently,
a D F

To the observer on the rotating earth, the object appears to be subject to F and to two
other forces, a Coriolis force, whose value per unit mass is 2  v, and a centrifugal
force, whose value per unit mass is   .  R/. The centrifugal and Coriolis forces
are not “real” forces acting on the object. They are ﬁctitious forces that compensate
for the fact that we are measuring acceleration with respect to a frame that we are
regarding as ﬁxed, although it is really rotating and hence accelerating.
Observe that the centrifugal force points directly away from the polar axis of the
earth. It represents the effect that the moving object wants to continue moving in a
straight line and “ﬂy off” from the earth rather than continuing to rotate along with the
observer. This force is greatest at the equator (where  is perpendicular to R), but it is
of very small magnitude: jj2jR0j  0:003g.
The Coriolis force is quite different in nature from the centrifugal force. In partic-
ular, it is zero if the observer perceives the object to be at rest. It is perpendicular to
both the velocity of the object and the polar axis of the earth, and its magnitude can be
as large as 2jjjvj; and, in particular, it can be larger than that of the centrifugal force
if jvj is sufﬁciently large.
EXAMPLE 3
(Winds around the eye of a storm) The circulation of winds
around a storm centre is an example of the Coriolis effect. The eye
of a storm is an area of low pressure sucking air toward it. The direction of rotation of
the earth is such that the angular velocity  points north and is parallel to the earth’s
axis of rotation. At any point P on the surface of the earth we can express  as a sum
of tangential (to the earth’s surface) and normal components (see Figure 11.7(a)),
.P / D T .P / C N .P /:

SECTION 11.2:

If P is in the northern hemisphere, N .P / points upward (away from the centre of
the earth). At such a point the Coriolis “force” C D 2.P /  v on a particle of air
moving with horizontal velocity v would itself have horizontal and normal components
C D 2T  v  2N  v D CN C CT :
The normal component of the Coriolis force has negligible effect, since air is not free
to travel great distances vertically. However, the tangential component of the Coriolis
force, CT D 2N  v, is 90ı to the right of v (i.e., clockwise from v). Therefore,
particles of air that are being sucked toward the eye of the storm experience Coriolis
deﬂection to the right and so actually spiral into the eye in a counterclockwise direction.
The opposite is true in the southern hemisphere, where the normal component N is
downward (into the earth). The suction force F, the velocity v, and the component
of the Coriolis force tangential to the earth’s surface, CT , are shown at two positions
on the path of an air particle spiralling around a low-pressure area in the northern
hemisphere in Figure 11.7(b).

Remark
Strong winds spiralling inward around low-pressure areas are called cy-
clones.
Strong winds spiralling outward around high-pressure areas are called
anticyclones. The latter spiral counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere and clock-
wise in the northern hemisphere.
The Coriolis effect also accounts for the high-
velocity eastward-ﬂowing jet streams in the upper atmosphere at midlatitudes in both
hemispheres, the energy being supplied by the rising of warm tropical air and its sub-
sequent moving toward the poles.
The relationships between the basis vectors in the ﬁxed and rotating frames can be
used to analyze many phenomena. Recall that R0 makes angle  with K. Suppose the
projection of R0 onto the equatorial plane (containing I and J) makes angle  with I,
as shown in Figure 11.5. Careful consideration of that ﬁgure should convince you that
i D  sin I C cos J
j D  cos  cos I  cos  sin J C sin K
k D sin  cos I C sin  sin J C cos K:

Curves and Parametrizations
In this section we will consider curves as geometric objects rather than as paths of
moving particles. Everyone has an intuitive idea of what a curve is, but it is difﬁcult to
give a formal deﬁnition of a curve as a geometric object (i.e., as a certain kind of set
of points) without involving the concept of parametric representation. We will avoid
this difﬁculty by continuing to regard a curve in 3-space as the set of points whose
positions are given by the position vector function
r D r.t/ D x.t/i C y.t/j C z.t/k;
a  t  b:
However, the parameter t need no longer represent time or any other speciﬁc physical
quantity.
EXAMPLE 1
Use t D y to parametrize the part of the line of intersection of the
two planes y D 2x 4 and z D 3x C1 from .2; 0; 7/ to .3; 2; 10/.
Solution
We need to express all three coordinates of an arbitrary point on the line
as functions of t D y. Since y D t, the equation y D 2x  4 assures us that x D

2.y C4/ D 1
2.t C4/. Then the equation z D 3x C1 gives z D 3

EXAMPLE 2
The plane x C y D 1 intersects the paraboloid z D x2 C y2
in a parabola. Parametrize the whole parabola using t D x as
parameter. Could t D y have been used as the parameter? What about t D z?
Solution
From the equations of the two surfaces deﬁning the parabola, we have y D
1x D 1t, and z D x2 Cy2 D 12t C2t2. Thus, the required parametrization is
r D ti C .1  t/j C .1  2t C 2t2/k;
1 < t < 1:
We could use t D y instead of t D x as the parameter; in this case the parametrization
would be r D .1  t/i C tj C .1  2t C 2t2/k;
1 < t < 1. However, if we try to
use t D z as the parameter, we would have to solve the system of equations x Cy D 1,
x2 C y2 D t for x and y. This system has two possible solutions, each corresponding
to a different half of the parabola starting at the lowest point

because there
are two points on the parabola at each height z > 1

CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
Curves can be very pathological.
For instance, there exist continuous curves that
pass through every point in a cube. It is difﬁcult to think of such a curve as a one-
dimensional object. In order to avoid such strange objects we assume hereafter that the
deﬁning function r.t/ has a continuous ﬁrst derivative, dr=dt, which we will continue
to call “velocity” and denote by v.t/ by analogy with the physical case where t is time.
(We also continue to call v.t/ D jv.t/j the “speed.”) As we will see later, this implies
that the curve has an arc length between any two points corresponding to parameter
values t1 and t2; if t1 < t2, this arc length is
Z t2
t1
v.t/ dt D
Z t2
t1
jv.t/j dt D
Z t2
t1
ˇˇˇdr
dt
ˇˇˇ dt:
Frequently we will want r.t/ to have continuous derivatives of higher order. Whenever
needed, we will assume that the “acceleration,” a.t/ D d 2r=dt2, and even the third
derivative, d 3r=dt3, are continuous. Of course, most of the curves we encounter in
practice have parametrizations with continuous derivatives of all orders.
It must be recalled, however, that no assumptions on the continuity of derivatives
of the function r.t/ are sufﬁcient to guarantee that the curve r D r.t/ is a “smooth”
curve. It may fail to be smooth at a point where v D 0. (See Example 1 in Section
11.1.) We will show in the next section that if, besides being continuous, the velocity
vector v.t/ is never the zero vector, then the curve r D r.t/ is smooth in the sense that
it has a continuously turning tangent line.
Although we have said that a curve is a set of points given by a parametric equation
r D r.t/, there is no unique way of representing a given curve parametrically. Just
as two cars can travel the same highway at different speeds, stopping and starting at
different places, so too can the same curve be deﬁned by different parametrizations; a
given curve can have inﬁnitely many different parametrizations.

All three functions represent points in the xy-plane. The function r1.t/
starts at the point .1; 0/ with position vector r1.=2/ D i and ends at the point
.1; 0/ with position vector i. It lies in the half of the xy-plane where y  0 (because

Thus, all three functions represent the same semicircle (see Figure 11.8). Of course,
the three parametrizations trace out the curve with different velocities.

SECTION 11.3:
Curves and Parametrizations
645
The curve r D r.t/, .a  t  b/, is called a closed curve if r.a/ D r.b/, that is, if the
curve begins and ends at the same point. The curve C is non–self-intersecting if there
exists some parametrization r D r.t/, .a  t  b/, of C that is one-to-one except that
the endpoints could be the same:
r.t1/ D r.t2/
a  t1 < t2  b
÷ t1 D a
and
t2 D b:
Such a curve can be closed, but otherwise does not intersect itself; it is then called a
simple closed curve. Circles and ellipses are examples of simple closed curves. Ev-
ery parametrization of a particular curve determines one of two possible orientations
corresponding to the direction along the curve in which the parameter is increasing.

Parametrizing the Curve of Intersection of Two Surfaces
Frequently, a curve is speciﬁed as the intersection of two surfaces with given Cartesian
equations. We may want to represent the curve by parametric equations. There is
no unique way to do this, but if one of the given surfaces is a cylinder parallel to a
coordinate axis (so its equation is independent of one of the variables), we can begin
by parametrizing that surface. The following examples clarify the method.
EXAMPLE 4
Parametrize the curve of intersection of the plane xC2y C4z D 4
and the elliptic cylinder x2 C 4y2 D 4.
Solution
We begin with the equation x2 C 4y2 D 4, which is independent of z. It
can be parametrized in many ways; one convenient way is
x D 2 cos t;
y D sin t;
.0  t  2/:
The equation of the plane can then be solved for z, so that z can be expressed in terms
of t:

Solution
Here, neither given equation is independent of a variable, but we can obtain
a third equation representing a surface containing the curve of intersection of the two
given surfaces by subtracting the two given equations to eliminate z:
x2 C y  xy D 1:

646
CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
This equation is readily parametrized. If, for example, we let x D t, then
t2 C y.1  t/ D 1;
so
y D 1  t2
1  t D 1 C t:
Either of the given equations can then be used to express z in terms of t:
z D 1  xy D 1  t.1 C t/ D 1  t  t2:
Thus, a possible parametrization of the curve is
r D ti C .1 C t/j C .1  t  t2/k:
Of course, this answer is not unique. Many other parametrizations can be found for the
curve, providing orientations in either direction.
Arc Length
We now consider how to deﬁne and calculate the length of a curve. Let C be a bounded,
continuous curve speciﬁed by
r D r.t/;
a  t  b:
Subdivide the closed interval Œa; b into n subintervals by points
a D t0 < t1 < t2 <    < tn1 < tn D b:
The points ri D r.ti/, .0  i  n/, subdivide C into n arcs. If we use the chord length
jri  ri1j as an approximation to the arc length between ri1 and ri, then the sum
sn D

jri  ri1j
approximates the length of C by the length of a polygonal line. (See Figure 11.11.)
Evidently, any such approximation is less than or equal to the actual length of C. We
say that C is rectiﬁable if there exists a constant K such that sn  K for every n and
every choice of the points ti. In this case, the completeness axiom of the real number
system assures us that there will be a smallest such number K. We call this smallest K
the length of C and denote it by s. Let ti D ti  ti1 and ri D ri  ri1. Then sn

Although the above formula is expressed in terms of the parameter t, the
arc length, as deﬁned above, is a strictly geometric property of the curve C. It is
independent of the particular parametrization used to represent C. See Exercise 27 at

Piecewise Smooth Curves
As observed earlier, a parametric curve C given by r D r.t/ can fail to be smooth at
points where dr=dt D 0. If there are ﬁnitely many such points, we will say that the
curve is piecewise smooth.
In general, a piecewise smooth curve C consists of a ﬁnite number of smooth
arcs, C1, C2, : : : , Ck, as shown in Figure 11.13.

The Arc-Length Parametrization
The selection of a particular parameter in terms of which to specify a given curve
will usually depend on the problem in which the curve arises; there is no one “right
way” to parametrize a curve. However, there is one parameter that is “natural” in
that it arises from the geometry (shape and size) of the curve itself and not from any
particular coordinate system in which the equation of the curve is to be expressed. This
parameter is the arc length measured from some particular point (the initial point) on
the curve. The position vector of an arbitrary point P on the curve can be speciﬁed as
a function of the arc length s along the curve from the initial point P0 to P;
r D r.s/:
This equation is called an arc-length parametrization or intrinsic parametrization
of the curve. Since ds D v.t/ dt for any parametrization r D r.t/, for the arc-
length parametrization we have ds D v.s/ ds. Thus, v.s/ D 1, identically; a curve
parametrized in terms of arc length is traced at unit speed. Although it is seldom
easy (and usually not possible) to ﬁnd r.s/ explicitly when the curve is given in terms
of some other parameter, smooth curves always have such parametrizations (see Ex-
ercise 28 at the end of this section), and they will prove useful when we develop the
fundamentals of the differential geometry for 3-space curves in the next section.

11.4
Curvature, Torsion, and the Frenet Frame
In this section and the next we develop the fundamentals of differential geometry of
curves in 3-space. We will introduce several new scalar and vector functions associated
with a curve C. The most important of these are the curvature and torsion of the curve
and a right-handed triad of mutually perpendicular unit vectors called the Frenet frame
that forms a basis at any point on the curve. The curvature measures the rate at which
a curve is turning (away from its tangent line) at any point. The torsion measures the
rate at which the curve is twisting (out of the plane in which it is turning) at any point.
The Unit Tangent Vector
The velocity vector v.t/ D dr=dt is tangent to the parametric curve r D r.t/ at the
point r.t/ and points in the direction of the orientation of the curve there. Since we are
assuming that v.t/ ¤ 0, we can ﬁnd a unit tangent vector, OT.t/, at r.t/ by dividing
v.t/ by its length:
OT.t/ D v.t/
v.t/ D dr
dt
 ˇˇˇˇ
dr

ˇˇˇˇ :
Recall that a curve parametrized in terms of arc length, r D r.s/, is traced at unit
speed; v.s/ D 1. In terms of arc-length parametrization, the unit tangent vector is
OT.s/ D dr

Remark
If the curve r D r.t/ has a continuous, nonvanishing velocity v.t/, then the
unit tangent vector OT.t/ is a continuous function of t. The angle .t/ between OT.t/
and any ﬁxed unit vector Ou is also continuous in t:
.t/ D cos1. OT.t/  Ou/:
Thus, as asserted previously, the curve is smooth in the sense that it has a continuously
turning tangent line. The rate of this turning is quantiﬁed by the curvature, which we
introduce now.
Curvature and the Unit Normal
In the rest of this section we will deal abstractly with a curve C parametrized in terms
of arc length measured from some point on it:
r D r.s/:
In the next section we return to curves with arbitrary parametrizations and apply the
principles developed in this section to speciﬁc problems. Throughout we assume that
the parametric equations of curves have continuous derivatives up to third order on the
intervals where they are deﬁned.
Having unit length, the tangent vector OT.s/ D dr=ds satisﬁes OT.s/  OT.s/ D 1.
Differentiating this equation with respect to s we get
2 OT.s/  d OT
ds D 0;
so that d OT=ds is perpendicular to OT.s/.

Curvature and radius of curvature
The curvature of C at the point r.s/ is the length of d OT=ds there. It is
denoted by , the Greek letter “kappa”:
.s/ D
ˇˇˇˇˇ
d OT
ds
ˇˇˇˇˇ :
The radius of curvature, denoted , the Greek letter “rho,” is the reciprocal
of the curvature:
.s/ D

.s/:
As we will see below, the curvature of C at r.s/ measures the rate of turning of the
tangent line to the curve there. The radius of curvature is the radius of the circle
through r.s/ that most closely approximates the curve C near that point.
According to its deﬁnition, .s/  0 everywhere on C. If .s/ ¤ 0, we can divide
d OT=ds by its length, .s/, and obtain a unit vector ON.s/ in the same direction. This
unit vector is called the unit principal normal to C at r.s/, or, more commonly, just
the unit normal:

Note that ON.s/ is perpendicular to C at r.s/ and points in the direction that OT, and
therefore C, is turning. The principal normal is not deﬁned at points where the curva-
ture .s/ is zero. For instance, a straight line has no principal normal. Figure 11.14(a)
shows OT and ON at a point on a typical curve.

Remark
Another observation can be made about the above example. The position

The unit tangent OT and unit normal ON at a point r.s/ on a curve C are regarded as
having their tails at that point. They are perpendicular, and ON points in the direction
toward which OT.s/ turns as s increases. The plane passing through r.s/ and containing
the vectors OT.s/ and ON.s/ is called the osculating plane of C at r.s/ (from the Latin
osculum, meaning kiss). For a plane curve, such as the circle in Example 2, the oscu-
lating plane is just the plane containing the curve. For more general three-dimensional
curves the osculating plane varies from point to point; at any point it is the plane that
comes closest to containing the part of the curve near that point. The osculating plane
is not properly deﬁned at a point where .s/ D 0, although if such points are isolated,
it can sometimes be deﬁned as a limit of osculating planes for neighbouring points.
Still assuming that .s/ ¤ 0, let
rc.s/ D r.s/ C .s/ ON.s/:
For each s the point with position vector rc.s/ lies in the osculating plane of C at r.s/,
on the concave side of C and at distance .s/ from r.s/. It is called the centre of
curvature of C for the point r.s/. The circle in the osculating plane having centre at
the centre of curvature and radius equal to the radius of curvature .s/ is called the
osculating circle for C at r.s/. Among all circles that pass through the point r.s/,
the osculating circle is the one that best describes the behaviour of C near that point.
Of course, the osculating circle of a circle at any point is the same circle. A typical
example of an osculating circle is shown in Figure 11.16.

Torsion and Binormal, the Frenet-Serret Formulas
At any point r.s/ on the curve C where OT and ON are deﬁned, a third unit vector, the
unit binormal OB, is deﬁned by the formula
OB D OT  ON:
Note that OB.s/ is normal to the osculating plane of C at r.s/; if C is a plane curve,
then OB is a constant vector, independent of s on any interval where .s/ ¤ 0. At each
point r.s/ on C, the three vectors f OT; ON; OBg constitute a right-handed basis of mutually
perpendicular unit vectors like the standard basis fi; j; kg. (See Figure 11.17.) This
basis is called the Frenet frame for C at the point r.s/. Note that
OB  OT D ON and ON  OB D OT:

Therefore, d OB=ds is also perpendicular to OT. Being perpendicular to both OT and OB,
d OB=ds must be parallel to ON. This fact is the basis for our deﬁnition of torsion.
DEFINITION
2
Torsion
On any interval where .s/ ¤ 0 there exists a function .s/ such that
d OB
ds D .s/ ON.s/:
The number .s/ is called the torsion of C at r.s/.
The torsion measures the degree of twisting that the curve exhibits near a point, that
is, the extent to which the curve fails to be planar. It may be positive or negative,
depending on the right-handedness or left-handedness of the twisting. We will present
an example later in this section.
Theorem 2 has an analogue for torsion, for which the proof is similar. It states
that the absolute value of the torsion, j.s/j, at point r.s/ on the curve C is the rate of
turning of the unit binormal:

Observe that the curvature .s/ and the torsion .s/ are both constant (i.e.,
independent of s) for a circular helix. In the above example,  > 0 (assuming that
b > 0). This corresponds to the fact that the helix is right-handed. (See Figure 11.12
in the previous section.) If you grasp the helix with your right hand so your ﬁngers
surround it in the direction of increasing s (counterclockwise, looking down from the
positive z-axis), then your thumb also points in the axial direction corresponding to
increasing s (the upward direction). Had we started with a left-handed helix, such as
r D a sin t i C a cos t j C btk;

we would have obtained  D b=.a2 C b2/.

Using the Frenet–Serret formulas, we can show that the shape of a curve with non-
vanishing curvature is completely determined by the curvature and torsion functions
.s/ and .s/.

The Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves
Let C1 and C2 be two curves, both of which have the same nonvanishing curvature
function .s/ and the same torsion function .s/. Then the curves are congruent. That
is, one can be moved rigidly (translated and rotated) so as to coincide exactly with the
other.
PROOF
We require  ¤ 0 because ON and OB are not deﬁned where  D 0. Move
C2 rigidly so that its initial point coincides with the initial point of C1 and so that the
Frenet frames of both curves coincide at that point. Let OT1, OT2, ON1, ON2, OB1, and OB2 be
the unit tangents, normals, and binormals for the two curves. Let
f .s/ D OT1.s/  OT2.s/ C ON1.s/  ON2.s/ C OB1.s/  OB2.s/:
We calculate the derivative of f .s/ using the Product Rule and the Frenet–Serret for-
mulas:

C  ON1  OB2   ON1  OB2   OB1  ON2
D 0:
Therefore, f .s/ is constant. Since the frames coincide at s D 0, the constant must, in
fact, be 3:
OT1.s/  OT2.s/ C ON1.s/  ON2.s/ C OB1.s/  OB2.s/ D 3:
However, each dot product cannot exceed 1 since the factors are unit vectors. Therefore,
each dot product must be equal to 1. In particular, OT1.s/  OT2.s/ D 1 for all s; hence,
dr1
ds D OT1.s/ D OT2.s/ D dr2
ds :
Integrating with respect to s and using the fact that both curves start from the same
point when s D 0, we obtain r1.s/ D r2.s/ for all s, which is what we wanted to show.
Remark
It is a consequence of the above theorem that any curve having nonzero
constant curvature and constant torsion must, in fact, be a circle (if the torsion is zero)
or a circular helix (if the torsion is nonzero). See Exercises 7 and 8 below.

Curvature and Torsion for General Parametrizations
The formulas developed above for curvature and torsion as well as for the unit normal
and binormal vectors are not very useful if the curve we want to analyze is not ex-
pressed in terms of the arc-length parameter. We will now consider how to ﬁnd these
quantities in terms of a general parametrization r D r.t/. We will express them all in
terms of the velocity, v.t/, the speed, v.t/ D jv.t/j, and the acceleration, a.t/. First,
observe that

CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
Since the curvature and torsion are both constant (they are therefore constant when
expressed in terms of any parametrization), the curve must be a circular helix by
Theorem 3. It is left-handed, since  < 0. By Example 3 in Section 11.4, it is congru-
ent to the helix
r D a cos ti C a sin tj C btk;
provided that a=.a2Cb2/ D 1=.2
p
2/ D b=.a2Cb2/. Solving these equations gives
a D
p

p

p

of this cylinder is the line x D y, z D 0, as can be seen by inspecting the components
of r.t/.

the term .dv=dt/ OT is called the tangential acceleration, and the term v2 ON is called

centre of curvature and its magnitude is v2 D v2=. Highway, railway, and roller-
coaster designers attempt to bank curves in such a way that the resultant of the corre-
sponding centrifugal force, m.v2=/ ON, and the weight, mgk, of the vehicle will be
normal to the surface at a desired speed.

(mgk) forces acting on the vehicle travelling at constant speed v0 along the road is
always normal to the surface of the road.

The deﬁnition of centripetal acceleration given above is consistent with the

of a moving particle at time t, we can regard the motion at any instant as being a
rotation about the centre of curvature, so that the angular velocity must be  D  OB.

CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
An Application to Track (or Road) Design
Model trains frequently come with two kinds of track sections: straight and curved.
The curved sections are arcs of a circle of radius R, and the track is intended to be laid
out in the shape shown in Figure 11.20(b); AB and CD are straight, and BC and DA
are semicircles. The track looks smooth, but is it smooth enough?

The track is held together by friction, and occasionally it can come apart as the
train is racing around. It is especially likely to come apart at the points A, B, C,
and D. To see why, assume that the train is travelling at constant speed v. Then
the tangential acceleration, .dv=dt/ OT, is zero, and the total acceleration is just the
centripetal acceleration, a D .v2=/ ON. Therefore, jaj D 0 along the straight sections,
and jaj D v2 D v2=R on the semicircular sections. The acceleration is discontinuous
at the points A, B, C, and D, and the reactive force exerted by the train on the track
is also discontinuous at these points. There is a “shock” or “jolt” as the train enters or
leaves a curved part of the track. In order to avoid such stress points, tracks should be
designed so that the curvature varies continuously from point to point.
EXAMPLE 5
Existing track along the negative x-axis and along the ray
y D x  1, x  2, is to be joined smoothly by track along the
transition curve y D f .x/, 0  x  2, where f .x/ is a polynomial of degree as
small as possible. Find f .x/ so that a train moving along the track will not experience
discontinuous acceleration at the joins.
Solution
The situation is shown in Figure 11.21. The polynomial f .x/ must be cho-
sen so that the track is continuous, has continuous slope, and has continuous curvature
at x D 0 and x D 2. Since the curvature of y D f .x/ is
 D jf 00.x/j

1 C .f 0.x//23=2
;
we need only arrange that f; f 0; and f 00 take the same values at x D 0 and x D 2 that
the straight sections do there:
f .0/ D 0;
f 0.0/ D 0;
f 00.0/ D 0;
f .2/ D 1;
f 0.2/ D 1;
f 00.2/ D 0:
These six independent conditions suggest we should try a polynomial of degree 5 in-
volving six arbitrary coefﬁcients:
f .x/ D A C Bx C Cx2 C Dx3 C Ex4 C F x5
f 0.x/ D B C 2Cx C 3Dx2 C 4Ex3 C 5F x4

Maple Calculations
In the following we assume the LinearAlgebra and VectorCalculus packages have been
loaded (in that order):
>
with(LinearAlgebra): with(VectorCalculus):
Here is how we might deﬁne a vector-valued function representing a circular helix:
>
R := t -> <a*cos(t), a*sin(t), b*t>;
The output from this deﬁnition (which we omit here) may appear a bit cryptic at ﬁrst;
it asserts that R is deﬁned as a procedure “VectorCalculus-<,>” whose arguments are
three “VectorCalculus-” procedures for the products that represent the three compo-
nents of R. Calling the function generates the expected results.
>

Velocity, acceleration, and speed functions can now be deﬁned in the obvious way and
the results used to ﬁnd these quantities at any point:
>
V := D(R): A := D(V):

v := t -> Norm(V(t),2):

No attempt to simplify the last expression has much effect unless we tell Maple that
a and b are real numbers. In fact, it is useful for purposes of simpliﬁcation to tell
Maple that a, b, and t are all real, and to suppress Maple’s urge to beat us over the
head with that fact by subsequently placing a tilde (~) after each of these variables in
all subsequent output. We can accomplish this with

list of functions generating the unit tangent, principal normal, and binormal vectors

In Maple 8 and some releases of Maple 9 the expression generated for the torsion had
an absolute value on the numerator (i.e., jbj instead of b). This was in error if b < 0;
the torsion should be negative in this case. In fact, the result above would make the

Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
The German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was a stu-
dent and colleague of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). Over a lifetime
of observing the positions of planets without the aid of a telescope, Brahe compiled

666
CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
a vast amount of data, which Kepler analyzed. Although Polish astronomer Nicolaus
Copernicus (1473–1543) had postulated that the earth and other planets moved around
the sun, the religious and philosophical climate in Europe at the end of the sixteenth
century still favoured explaining the motion of heavenly bodies in terms of circular
orbits around the earth. It was known that planets such as Mars could not move on
circular orbits centred at the earth, but models were proposed in which they moved on
other circles (epicycles) whose centres moved on circles centred at the earth.
Brahe’s observations of Mars were sufﬁciently detailed that Kepler realized that
no simple model based on circles could be made to conform very closely with the
actual orbit. He was, however, able to ﬁt a more general quadratic curve, an ellipse
with one focus at the sun. Based on this success and on Brahe’s data on other planets,
he formulated the following three laws of planetary motion:
Kepler’s Laws
1. The planets move on elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
2. The radial line from the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal
times.
3. The squares of the periods of revolution of the planets around the sun are
proportional to the cubes of the major axes of their orbits.
Kepler’s statement of the third law actually says that the squares of the periods of
revolution of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the
sun. The mean distance of points on an ellipse from a focus of the ellipse is equal to
the semi-major axis. (See Exercise 17 at the end of this section.) Therefore, the two
statements are equivalent.
The choice of ellipses was reasonable once it became clear that circles would not
work. The properties of the conic sections were well understood, having been devel-
oped by the Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga around 200 BC. Nevertheless,
based, as it was, on observations rather than theory, Kepler’s formulation of his laws
without any causal explanation was a truly remarkable feat. The theoretical underpin-
nings came later when Newton, with the aid of his newly created calculus, showed that
Kepler’s laws implied an inverse square gravitational force. (See Review Exercises
14–16 at the end of this chapter.) Newton believed that his universal gravitational law
also implied Kepler’s laws, but his writings fail to provide a proof that is convincing
by today’s standards.1
Later in this section we will derive Kepler’s laws from the gravitational law by
an elegant method that exploits vector differentiation to the fullest. First, however, we
need to attend to some preliminaries.

CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
Polar Components of Velocity and Acceleration
Let r.t/ be the position vector at time t of a particle P moving in the xy-plane. We
construct two unit vectors at P; the vector Or points in the direction of the position
vector r, and the vector O is rotated 90ı counterclockwise from Or. (See Figure 11.25.)
If P has polar coordinates Œr; , then Or points in the direction of increasing r at P; and
O points in the direction of increasing . Evidently,
Or D cos  i C sin  j
O D  sin  i C cos  j:
Note that Or and O do not depend on r but only on :

The pair fOr; Og forms a reference frame (a basis) at P so that vectors in the plane can
be expressed in terms of these two unit vectors. The Or component of a vector is called
the radial component, and the O component is called the transverse component. The
frame varies from point to point, so we must remember that Or and O are both functions
of t. In terms of this moving frame, the position r.t/ of P can be expressed very
simply:
r D rOr;
where r D r.t/ D jr.t/j is the distance from P to the origin at time t.
We are going to differentiate this equation with respect to t in order to express
the velocity and acceleration of P in terms of the moving frame. Along the path of
motion, r can be regarded as a function of either  or t;  is itself a function of t. To
avoid confusion, let us adopt a notation that is used extensively in mechanics and that
resembles the notation originally used by Newton in his calculus.
A dot over a quantity denotes the time derivative of that quantity. Two dots
denote the second derivative with respect to time. Thus,
Pu D du=dt
and
Ru D d 2u=dt2:
First, let us record the time derivatives of the vectors Or and O. By the Chain Rule, we

Central Forces and Kepler’s Second Law
Polar coordinates are most appropriate for analyzing motion due to a central force that
is always directed toward (or away from) a single point, the origin: F D .r/r, where
the scalar .r/ depends on the position r of the object. If the velocity and acceleration
of the object are v D Pr and a D Pv, then Newton’s Second Law of Motion (F D ma)
says that a is parallel to r. Therefore,
d
dt .r  v/ D Pr  v C r  Pv D v  v C r  a D 0 C 0 D 0;
and r  v D h, a constant vector representing the object’s angular momentum per unit
mass about the origin. This says that r is always perpendicular to h, so motion due to
a central force always takes place in a plane through the origin having normal h.
If we choose the z-axis to be in the direction of h and let jhj D h, then h D hk,
and the path of the object is in the xy-plane. In this case the position and velocity of
the object satisfy
r D rOr
and
v D PrOr C r P O:
Since Or  O D k, we have
hk D r  v D r PrOr  Or C r2 P Or  O D r2 Pk:
Hence, for any motion under a central force,
r2 P D h
(a constant for the path of motion).
This formula is equivalent to Kepler’s Second Law; if A.t/ is the area in the plane of
motion bounded by the orbit and radial lines  D 0 and  D .t/, then
A.t/ D 1

Thus, area is being swept out at the constant rate h=2, and equal areas are swept out in
equal times. Note that this law does not depend on the magnitude or direction of the
force on the moving object other than the fact that it is central. You can also derive the
equation r2 P D h (constant) directly from the fact that the transverse acceleration is
zero:

Since the force is central, we know that the transverse acceleration is zero

Derivation of Kepler’s First and Third Laws
The planets and the sun move around their common centre of mass. Since the sun is
vastly more massive than the planets, that centre of mass is quite close to the centre
of the sun. For example, the joint centre of mass of the sun and the earth lies inside
the sun. For the following derivation we will take the sun and a planet as point masses
and consider the sun to be ﬁxed at the origin. We will specify the directions of the
coordinate axes later, when the need arises.
According to Newton’s Law of Gravitation, the force that the sun exerts on a planet
of mass m whose position vector is r is
F D km
r2 Or D km
r3 r;
where k is a positive constant depending on the mass of the sun, and Or D r=r.
As observed above, the fact that the force on the planet is always directed toward
the origin implies that r  v is constant. We choose the direction of the z-axis so
that r  v D hk, so the motion will be in the xy-plane and r2 P D h. We have not
yet speciﬁed the directions of the x- and y-axes but will do so shortly. Using polar

This result, known as Hamilton’s Theorem, says that as a planet moves around its
orbit, its velocity vector (when positioned with its tail at the origin) traces out a circle
with centre at point C having position vector C. It is perhaps surprising that there is
a circle associated with the orbit of a planet after all. Only it is not the position vector
that moves on a circle but the velocity vector. (See Figure 11.26.)
Recall that so far we have speciﬁed only the position of the origin and the direction
of the z-axis. Therefore, the xy-plane is determined but not the directions of the x-axis

The position of the x-axis is now determined by the fact that the three vectors i, j, and

We have deduced Kepler’s First Law! The choices we made for the coordinate axes
result in perihelion (the point on the orbit that is closest to the sun) being on the
positive x-axis ( D 0).
EXAMPLE 2
A planet’s orbit has eccentricity " (where 0 < " < 1), and its speed
at perihelion is vP . Find its speed vA at aphelion (the point on its
orbit farthest from the sun).

672
CHAPTER 11
Vector Functions and Curves
Solution
At perihelion and aphelion the planet’s radial velocity Pr is zero (since r is
minimum or maximum), so the velocity is entirely transverse. Thus, vP D rP PP and
vA D rA PA. Since r2 P D h has the same value at all points of the orbit, we have
rP vP D r2
P PP D h D r2
A PA D rAvA:
The planet’s orbit has equation

so perihelion corresponds to  D 0 and aphelion to  D :
rP D

and
rA D
`

Therefore, vA D rP
rA
vP D 1  "

We can obtain Kepler’s Third Law from the other two as follows. Since the radial
line from the sun to a planet sweeps out area at a constant rate h=2, the total area A
enclosed by the orbit is A D .h=2/T , where T is the period of revolution. The area of
an ellipse with semi-axes a and b is A D ab. Since b2 D `a D h2a=k, we have
T 2 D 4
h2 A2 D 4
h2 2a2b2 D 42
k
a3:
Note how the ﬁnal expression for T 2 does not depend on h, which is a constant for
the orbit of any one planet, but varies from planet to planet. The constant 42=k does
not depend on the particular planet. (k depends on the mass of the sun and a universal
gravitational constant.) Thus,
T 2 D 42
k a3
says that the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the length,
2a, of the major axis of its orbit, the proportionality extending over all the planets.
This is Kepler’s Third Law. Modern astronomical data show that T 2=a3 varies by only
about three-tenths of one percent over the solar system’s known planets.
Conservation of Energy
Solving the second-order differential equation of motion F D mRr to ﬁnd the orbit
of a planet requires two integrations. In the above derivation we exploited properties
of the cross product to make these integrations easy. More traditional derivations of
Kepler’s laws usually begin with separating the radial and transverse components in
the equation of motion:
Rr  r P2 D  k
r2 ;
r R C 2Pr P D 0:
As observed earlier, the second equation above implies that r2 P D h D constant,
which is Kepler’s Second Law. This can be used to eliminate  from the ﬁrst equation

This is a conservation of energy law. The ﬁrst term on the left is v2=2, the kinetic
energy (per unit mass) of the planet. The term k=r is the potential energy per unit
mass. It is difﬁcult to integrate this equation and to ﬁnd r as a function of t. In any
event, we really want r as a function of  so that we can recognize that we have an
ellipse. Another way to obtain this is suggested in Exercise 18 below.
Remark
The procedure used above to demonstrate Kepler’s laws in fact shows that
if any object moves under the inﬂuence of a force that attracts it toward the origin (or
repels it away from the origin) and has magnitude proportional to the reciprocal of the
square of distance from the origin, then the object must move in a plane orbit whose
shape is a conic section. If the total energy E deﬁned above is negative, then the orbit
is bounded and must therefore be an ellipse. If E D 0, the orbit is a parabola. If
E > 0, the orbit is a hyperbola. Hyperbolic orbits are typical for repulsive forces but
may also occur for attractions if the object has high enough velocity (exceeding the
escape velocity). See Exercise 22 for an example.

Deductions from Kepler’s laws

150 million km. Comet Halley approaches perihelion (comes
closest to the sun) in its elliptical orbit approximately every 76
years. Estimate the major axis of the orbit of Comet Halley.
7. The mean distance from the moon to the earth is about
385,000 km, and its period of revolution around the earth is
about 27 days (the sidereal month). At approximately what

should a communications satellite be inserted into circular

regard the asteroid as almost stopped, so that it goes into a
highly eccentric elliptical orbit whose major axis is a bit
greater than the radius of the original circular orbit.

Challenging Problems
1. Let P be a point on the surface of the earth at 45ı north lati-
tude. Use a coordinate system with origin at P and basis vec-
tors i and j pointing east and north, respectively, so that k points
vertically upward.
(a) Express the angular velocity  of the earth in terms of
the basis vectors at P: What is the magnitude  of  in
radians per second?
(b) Find the Coriolis acceleration aC D 2  v of an object
falling vertically with speed v above P:
(c) If the object in (b) drops from rest from a height of 100 m
above P; approximately where will it strike the ground?
Ignore air resistance but not the Coriolis acceleration.
Since the Coriolis acceleration is much smaller than the
gravitational acceleration in magnitude, you can use the
vertical velocity as a good approximation to the actual ve-
locity of the object at any time during its fall.

(The spin of a baseball) When a ball is thrown with spin about
an axis that is not parallel to its velocity, it experiences a lat-
eral acceleration due to differences in friction along its sides.
This spin acceleration is given by as D kS  v, where v is the
velocity of the ball, S is the angular velocity of its spin, and
k is a positive constant depending on the surface of the ball.
Suppose that a ball for which k D 0:001 is thrown horizontally
along the x-axis with an initial speed of 70 ft/s and a spin of
1,000 radians/s about a vertical axis. Its velocity v must satisfy

(Charged particles moving in magnetic ﬁelds) Magnetic

bead slides from rest under gravity, starting at a point hav-
ing parameter value 0, show that the time it takes for the
bead to fall to the lowest point on the arch (corresponding to
 D ) is a constant, independent of the starting position

ferent positions along the wire will always collide at the lowest

(The Drop of Doom) An amusement park ride that used to be
located at the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, gives
thrill seekers a taste of free-fall. It consists of a car moving
along a track consisting of straight vertical and horizontal sec-
tions joined by a smooth curve. The car drops from the top
and falls vertically under gravity for 10  2

entering the curved section at B. (See Figure 11.31.) It falls
another 2

the horizontal section DE at ground level, where brakes are
applied to stop it. (Thus, the total vertical drop from A to D or
E is 10 m, a ﬁgure, like the others in this problem, chosen for
mathematical convenience rather than engineering precision.)
For purposes of this problem it is helpful to take the coordi-
nate axes at a 45ı angle to the vertical, so that the two straight
sections of the track lie along the graph y D jxj. The curved
section then goes from .2; 2/ to .2; 2/ and can be taken to be

Introduction
This chapter is concerned with extending the idea of the
derivative to real functions of a vector variable, that is, to
functions depending on several real variables. Although differentiation is carried out
one variable at a time, the relationship between derivatives with respect to different
variables makes the analysis of such functions much more complicated and subtle than
in the single-variable case.
12.1
Functions of Several Variables
The notation y D f .x/ is used to indicate that the variable y depends on the single
real variable x, that is, that y is a function of x. The domain of such a function f
is a set of real numbers. Many quantities can be regarded as depending on more than
one real variable and thus to be functions of more than one variable. For example, the
volume of a circular cylinder of radius r and height h is given by V D r2h; we say
that V is a function of the two variables r and h. If we choose to denote this function
by f , then we would write V D f .r; h/ where
f .r; h/ D r2h;
.r  0;
h  0/:
Thus, f is a function of two variables having as domain the set of points in the
rh-plane with coordinates .r; h/ satisfying r  0 and h  0. Similarly, the rela-
tionship w D f .x; y; z/ D x C 2y  3z deﬁnes w as a function of the three variables
x, y, and z, with domain the whole of R3, or, if we state explicitly, some particular
subset of R3.
By analogy with the corresponding deﬁnition for functions of one variable, we
deﬁne a function of n variables as follows:
DEFINITION
1
A function f of n real variables is a rule that assigns a unique real number
f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ to each point .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ in some subset D.f / of Rn.
D.f / is called the domain of f: The set of real numbers f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/
obtained from points in the domain is called the range of f:
As for functions of one variable, the domain convention speciﬁes that the
domain of a function of n variables is the largest set of points .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/
for which f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ makes sense as a real number, unless that domain
is explicitly stated to be a smaller set.

SECTION 12.1:
Functions of Several Variables
679
Most of the examples we consider hereafter will be functions of two or three inde-
pendent variables. When a function f depends on two variables, we will usually call
these independent variables x and y, and we will use z to denote the dependent vari-
able that represents the value of the function; that is, z D f .x; y/. We will normally
use x, y, and z as the independent variables of a function of three variables and w as
the value of the function: w D f .x; y; z/. Some deﬁnitions will be given, and some
theorems will be stated (and proved) only for the two-variable case, but extensions to
three or more variables will usually be obvious.
Graphs
The graph of a function f of one variable (i.e., the graph of the equation y D f .x/) is
the set of points in the xy-plane having coordinates

x; f .x/

, where x is in the domain
of f: Similarly, the graph of a function f of two variables (i.e., the graph of the equa-
tion z D f .x; y/) is the set of points in 3-space having coordinates

x; y; f .x; y/

,
where .x; y/ belongs to the domain of f: This graph is a surface in R3 lying above
(if f .x; y/ > 0) or below (if f .x; y/ < 0) the domain of f in the xy-plane. (See
Figure 12.1.) The graph of a function of three variables is a three-dimensional hy-
persurface in 4-space, R4. In general, the graph of a function of n variables is an
n-dimensional surface in RnC1. We will not attempt to draw graphs of functions of
more than two variables!

a particular set in the xy-plane, the graph would have been the whole plane through
these three points.

If we square the equation z D

form x2 C y2 C z2 D 9. This is a sphere of radius 3 centred at the origin. However,
the graph of f is only the upper hemisphere where z  0. (See Figure 12.3.)

most such graphs are difﬁcult to sketch without considerable artistic talent and training.
Nevertheless, you should always try to visualize such a graph and sketch it as best you
can. Sometimes it is convenient to sketch only part of a graph, for instance, the part
lying in the ﬁrst octant. It is also helpful to determine (and sketch) the intersections of
the graph with various planes, especially the coordinate planes and planes parallel to
the coordinate planes. (See Figure 12.1.)
Some mathematical software packages will produce plots of three-dimensional
graphs to help you get a feeling for how the corresponding functions behave. Figure 12.1
is an example of such a computer-drawn graph, as is Figure 12.4 below. Along with
most of the other mathematical graphics in this book, both were produced using the
mathematical graphics software package MG. Later in this section we discuss how to
use Maple to produce such graphs.

Level Curves
Another way to represent the function f .x; y/ graphically is to produce a two-
dimensional topographic map of the surface z D f .x; y/. In the xy-plane we sketch
the curves f .x; y/ D C for various values of the constant C. These curves are called
level curves of f because they are the vertical projections onto the xy-plane of the
curves in which the graph z D f .x; y/ intersects the horizontal (level) planes z D C.
The graph and some level curves of the function f .x; y/ D x2 C y2 are shown in
Figure 12.5. The graph is a circular paraboloid in 3-space, which is a smooth sur-
face. The level curves of f are circles centred at the origin in the xy-plane. Observe,
however, that the function g.x; y/ D
p
x2 C y2 has the same family of circles as its
level curves (though for different values of C), but the graph of g is a circular cone
with vertex at the origin and is therefore not smooth there. We can not infer from the
smoothness of the level curves of a function that the graph of the function is smooth.

show the elevations, in 40 m increments above sea level, on a
mountainous region bordering Narrows Inlet on the British Columbia coast. Since
these contours are drawn for equally spaced values of C, the spacing of the contours
themselves conveys information about the relative steepness at various places on the
mountains; the land is steepest where the contour lines are closest together. Observe
also that the streams shown in blue (not the grid lines) cross the contours at right
angles. They take the route of steepest descent. Isotherms (curves of constant temper-
ature) and isobars (curves of constant pressure) on weather maps are also examples of
level curves.

A function determines its level curves with any given spacing between consecutive

known.

The level curve z D g.x; y/ D C (where C is a positive constant) has
equation x2 C .y  C/2 D 2C 2 and is, therefore, a circle of radius

These level curves intersect rays from the origin at equal spacing (the spacing is differ-
ent for different rays) indicating that the surface z D g.x; y/ is an oblique cone. See

Although the graph of a function f .x; y; z/ of three variables cannot easily be drawn
(it is a three-dimensional hypersurface in 4-space), such a function has level surfaces
in 3-space that can, perhaps, be drawn. These level surfaces have equations of the form
f .x; y; z/ D C for various choices of the constant C. For instance, the level surfaces
of the function f .x; y; z/ D x2 Cy2 Cz2 are concentric spheres centred at the origin.
Figure 12.10 shows a few level surfaces of the function f .x; y; z/ D x2  z. They are
parabolic cylinders.

Using Maple Graphics
Like many mathematical software packages, Maple has several plotting routines to help
you visualize the behaviour of functions of two and three variables. We mention only
a few of them here; there are many more. Most of the plotting routines are in the plots
package, so you should begin any Maple session where you want to use them with the
input
>
with(plots);
To save space, we won’t show any of the plot output here. You will need to play with
modiﬁcations to the various plot commands to obtain the kind of output you desire.
The graph of a function f .x; y/ of two variables (or an expression in x and y)
can be plotted over a rectangle in the xy-plane with a call to the plot3d routine. For
example,
>
f := -6*y/(2+x^2+y^2);
>
plot3d(f, x=-6..6, y=-6..6);
will plot a surface similar to the one in Figure 12.4 but without axes and viewed from
a steeper angle. You can add many kinds of options to the command to change the
output. For instance,
>
plot3d(f, x=-6..6, y=-6..6, axes=boxed,
orientation=[30,70]);
will plot the same surface within a three-dimensional rectangular box with scales on
three of its edges indicating the coordinate values. (If we had said axes=normal
instead, we would have gotten the usual coordinate axes through the origin, but they
tend to be more difﬁcult to see against the background of the surface, so axes=boxed
is usually preferable.) The option orientation=[30,70] results in the plot’s
being viewed from the direction making angle 70ı with the z-axis and lying in a plane
containing the z-axis making an angle 30ı with the xz-plane. (The default value of
the orientation is Œ45; 45 if the option is not speciﬁed.) By default, the surface plotted
by plot3d is ruled by two families of curves, representing its intersection with vertical
planes x D a and y D b for several equally spaced values of a and b, and it is coloured
opaquely so that hidden parts do not show.
Instead of plot3d, you can use contourplot3d to get a plot of the surface ruled

684
CHAPTER 12
Partial Differentiation
by contours on which the value of the function is constant. If you don’t get enough
contours by default, you can include a contours=n option to specify the number
you want.
>
contourplot3d(f, x=-6..6, y=-6..6, axes=boxed,
contours=24);
The contours are the projections of the level curves onto the graph of the surface.
Alternatively, you can get a two-dimensional plot of the level curves themselves using
contourplot:
>
contourplot(f, x=-6..6, y=-6..6, axes=normal,
contours=24);
Other options you may want to include with plot3d or contourplot3d are
(a) view=zmin..zmax to specify the range of values of the function (i.e., z) to
show in the plot.
(b) grid=[m,n] to specify the number of x and y values at which to evaluate the
function. If your plot doesn’t look smooth enough, try m D n D 20 or 30 or even
higher values.
The graph of an equation, f .x; y/ D 0, in the xy-plane can be generated without
solving the equation for x or y ﬁrst by using implicitplot.
>
implicitplot(x^3-y^2-5*x*y-x-5, x=-6..7, y=-5..6);
will produce the graph of x3  y2  5xy  x  5 D 0 on the rectangle 6  x  7,
5  y  6. There is also an implicitplot3d routine to plot the surface in 3-space
having an equation of the form f .x; y; z/ D 0. For this routine you must specify
ranges for all three variables;
>
implicitplot3d(x^2+y^2-z^2-1, x=-4..4, y=-4..4,
z=-3..3, axes=boxed);
plots the hyperboloid z2 D x2 C y2  1.
Finally, we observe that Maple is no more capable than we are of drawing graphs
of functions of three or more variables, since it doesn’t have four-dimensional plot
capability. The best we can do is plot a set of level surfaces for such a function:
>
implicitplot3d(fz-x^2-2,z-x^2,z-x^2+2g,x=-2..2,
y=-2..2, z=-2..5, axes=boxed);
It is possible to construct a sequence of plot structures and assign them to, say, the
elements of a list variable, without actually plotting them. Then all the plots can be
plotted simultaneously using the display function.
>
for c from -1 to 1 do
p[c] := implicitplot3d(z^2-x^2-y^2-2*c, x=-3..3,
y=-3..3, z=0..2, color=COLOR(RGB,(1+c)/2,(1-c)/2,1))
od:
>
display([seq(p[c],c=-1..1)], axes=boxed,
orientation=[30,40]);
Note that the command creating the plots is terminated with a colon rather than the
usual semicolon. If you don’t suppress the output in this way, you will get vast amounts
of numerical output as the plots are constructed. The color=... option is an attempt
to give the three plots different colours so they can be distinguished from each other.

Limits and Continuity
Before reading this section you should review the concepts of neighbourhood, open
and closed sets, and boundary and interior points introduced in Section 10.1.
The concept of the limit of a function of several variables is similar to that for
functions of one variable. For clarity we present the deﬁnition for functions of two
variables only; the general case is similar.
We might say that f .x; y/ approaches the limit L as the point .x; y/ approaches
the point .a; b/, and write
lim
.x;y/!.a;b/ f .x; y/ D L;
if all points of a neighbourhood of .a; b/, except possibly the point .a; b/ itself, be-
long to the domain of f; and if f .x; y/ approaches L as .x; y/ approaches .a; b/.
However, it is more convenient to deﬁne the limit in such a way that .a; b/ can be a
boundary point of the domain of f: Thus, our formal deﬁnition will generalize the
one-dimensional notion of one-sided limit as well.
DEFINITION
2
Deﬁnition of Limit
We say that
lim
.x;y/!.a;b/ f .x; y/ D L, provided that
(i) every neighbourhood of .a; b/ contains points of the domain of f differ-
ent from .a; b/, and
(ii) for every positive number  there exists a positive number ı D ı./ such
that jf .x; y/  Lj <  holds whenever .x; y/ is in the domain of f and
satisﬁes 0 <
p
.x  a/2 C .y  b/2 < ı:
Condition (i) is included in Deﬁnition 2 because it is not appropriate to consider limits
at isolated points of the domain of f; that is, points with neighbourhoods that contain
no other points of the domain. As noted in the marginal note following Deﬁnition 8 in
Section 1.5, the version of the above deﬁnition for functions of one variable is more
general than that older deﬁnition. (See Exercise 24 below.)
If a limit exists it is unique. For a single-variable function f; the existence of
limx!a f .x/ implies that f .x/ approaches the same ﬁnite number as x approaches a
from either the right or the left. Similarly, for a function of two variables, we can have
lim.x;y/!.a;b/ f .x; y/ D L only if f .x; y/ approaches the same number L no matter
how .x; y/ approaches .a; b/ in the domain of f: In particular, .x; y/ can approach
.a; b/ along any curve that lies in D.f /. It is not necessary that L D f .a; b/ even if
f .a; b/ is deﬁned. The examples below illustrate these assertions.
All the usual laws of limits extend to functions of several variables in the obvious
way. For example, if lim.x;y/!.a;b/ f .x; y/ D L, lim.x;y/!.a;b/ g.x; y/ D M; and
every neighbourhood of .a; b/ contains points in D.f / \ D.g/ other than .a; b/, then

The function f .x; y/ D
p
1  x2  y2 has limit f .a; b/ at all
points .a; b/ of its domain, the closed disk x2 C y2  1, and is
therefore considered to be continuous on its domain. Of course, .x; y/ can approach
points of the bounding circle x2 C y2 D 1 only from within the disk.
The following examples show that the requirement that f .x; y/ approach the same
limit no matter how .x; y/ approaches .a; b/ can be very restrictive, and makes limits
in two or more variables much more subtle than in the single-variable case.
EXAMPLE 3
Investigate the limiting behaviour of f .x; y/ D
2xy
x2 C y2 as .x; y/
approaches .0; 0/.
Solution
Note that f .x; y/ is deﬁned at all points of the xy-plane except the origin
.0; 0/. We can still ask whether lim.x;y/!.0;0/ f .x; y/ exists. If we let .x; y/ approach
.0; 0/ along the x-axis (y D 0), then f .x; y/ D f .x; 0/ ! 0 (because f .x; 0/ D 0
identically). Thus, lim.x;y/!.0;0/ f .x; y/ must be 0 if it exists at all. Similarly, at all
points of the y-axis we have f .x; y/ D f .0; y/ D 0. However, at points of the line
x D y, f has a different constant value; f .x; x/ D 1. Since the limit of f .x; y/ is 1
as .x; y/ approaches .0; 0/ along this line, it follows that f .x; y/ cannot have a limit
at the origin. That is,
lim
.x;y/!.0;0/
2xy
x2 C y2
does not exist:
Observe that f .x; y/ has a constant value on any ray from the origin (on the ray y D
kx the value is 2k=.1Ck2/), but these values differ on different rays. The level curves
of f are the rays from the origin (with the origin itself removed). It is difﬁcult to sketch
the graph of f near the origin. The ﬁrst octant part of the graph is the “hood-shaped”
surface in Figure 12.13.

EXAMPLE 4
Investigate the limiting behaviour of f .x; y/ D
2x2y
x4 C y2 as .x; y/

Solution
As in Example 3, f .x; y/ vanishes identically on the coordinate axes, so
lim.x;y/!.0;0/ f .x; y/ must be 0 if it exists at all. If we examine f .x; y/ at points of
the ray y D kx, we obtain
f .x; kx/ D
2kx3

2kx
x2 C k2 ! 0;
as

Thus, f .x; y/ ! 0 as .x; y/ ! .0; 0/ along any straight line through the origin. We
might be tempted to conclude, therefore, that lim.x;y/!.0;0/ f .x; y/ D 0, but this is
incorrect. Observe the behaviour of f .x; y/ along the curve y D x2:
f .x; x2/ D
2x4
x4 C x4 D 1:
Thus, f .x; y/ does not approach 0 as .x; y/ approaches the origin along this curve, so
lim.x;y/!.0;0/ f .x; y/ does not exist. The level curves of f are pairs of parabolas of
the form y D kx2, y D x2=k with the origin removed. See Figure 12.14 for the ﬁrst
octant part of the graph of f:

x2y
x2 C y2 does have a limit at
the origin; speciﬁcally,
lim
.x;y/!.0;0/
x2y

Solution
This function is also deﬁned everywhere except at the origin. Observe that
since x2  x2 C y2, we have

which approaches zero as .x; y/ ! .0; 0/. (See Figure 12.15.) Formally, if  > 0 is
given and we take ı D , then jf .x; y/  0j <  whenever 0 <
p
x2 C y2 < ı, so
f .x; y/ has limit 0 as .x; y/ ! .0; 0/ by Deﬁnition 2.
As for functions of one variable, continuity of a function f at a point of its domain is
deﬁned directly in terms of the limit. (See, for instance, Example 2.)

DEFINITION
3
The function f .x; y/ is continuous at the point .a; b/ if
lim
.x;y/!.a;b/ f .x; y/ D f .a; b/:
It remains true that sums, differences, products, quotients, and compositions of con-
tinuous functions are continuous. The functions of Examples 3 and 4 above are con-
tinuous wherever they are deﬁned, that is, at all points except the origin. There is no
way to deﬁne f .0; 0/ so that these functions become continuous at the origin. They
show that the continuity of the single-variable functions f .x; b/ at x D a and f .a; y/
at y D b does not imply that f .x; y/ is continuous at .a; b/. In fact, even if f .x; y/
is continuous along every straight line through .a; b/, it still need not be continuous
at .a; b/. (See Exercises 16–17 below.) Note, however, that the function f .x; y/ of
Example 5, although not deﬁned at the origin, has a continuous extension to that point.
If we extend the domain of f by deﬁning f .0; 0/ D lim.x;y/!.0;0/ f .x; y/ D 0, then
f is continuous on the whole xy-plane.
As for functions of one variable, the existence of a limit of a function at a point
does not imply that the function is continuous at that point. The function

12.3
Partial Derivatives
In this section we begin the process of extending the concepts and techniques of single-
variable calculus to functions of more than one variable. It is convenient to begin by
considering the rate of change of such functions with respect to one variable at a time.
Thus, a function of n variables has n ﬁrst-order partial derivatives, one with respect to
each of its independent variables. For a function of two variables, we make this precise
in the following deﬁnition:
DEFINITION
4
The ﬁrst partial derivatives of the function f .x; y/ with respect to the
variables x and y are the functions f1.x; y/ and f2.x; y/ given by
f1.x; y/ D lim
h!0
f .x C h; y/  f .x; y/
h
;
f2.x; y/ D lim
k!0
f .x; y C k/  f .x; y/
k
;
provided these limits exist.
Each of the two partial derivatives is the limit of a Newton quotient in one of the vari-
ables. Observe that f1.x; y/ is just the ordinary ﬁrst derivative of f .x; y/ considered
as a function of x only, regarding y as a constant parameter. Similarly, f2.x; y/ is the
ﬁrst derivative of f .x; y/ considered as a function of y alone, with x held ﬁxed.

SECTION 12.3:
Partial Derivatives
691
EXAMPLE 1
If f .x; y/ D x2 sin y, then
f1.x; y/ D 2x sin y
and
f2.x; y/ D x2 cos y:
The subscripts 1 and 2 in the notations for the partial derivatives refer to the ﬁrst and
second variables of f: For functions of one variable we use the notation f 0 for the
derivative; the prime (0) denotes differentiation with respect to the only variable on
which f depends. For functions f of two variables, we use f1 or f2 to show the
variable of differentiation. Do not confuse these subscripts with subscripts used for
other purposes (e.g., to denote the components of vectors).
The partial derivative f1.a; b/ measures the rate of change of f .x; y/ with respect
to x at x D a while y is held ﬁxed at b. In graphical terms, the surface z D f .x; y/
intersects the vertical plane y D b in a curve. If we take horizontal and vertical
lines through the point .0; b; 0/ as coordinate axes in the plane y D b, then the curve
has equation z D f .x; b/, and its slope at x D a is f1.a; b/. (See Figure 12.16.)
Similarly, f2.a; b/ represents the rate of change of f with respect to y at y D b with
x held ﬁxed at a. The surface z D f .x; y/ intersects the vertical plane x D a in a
curve z D f .a; y/ whose slope at y D b is f2.a; b/. (See Figure 12.17.)

Various notations can be used to denote the partial derivatives of z D f .x; y/
considered as functions of x and y:

@x f .x; y/ D f1.x; y/ D D1f .x; y/
@z
@y D @
@y f .x; y/ D f2.x; y/ D D2f .x; y/
The symbol @=@x should be read as “partial with respect to x” so @z=@x is “partial
z with respect to x.” The reason for distinguishing @ (pronounced “die”) from the d
of ordinary derivatives of single-variable functions will be made clear later. Similar
notations can be used to denote the values of partial derivatives at a particular point

BEWARE!
Read the paragraph
at the right carefully. It explains
why, at least for the time being, we
are using subscripts 1 and 2 instead
of subscripts x and y for the partial
derivatives of f .x; y/. Later on, and
especially when we are discussing
partial differential equations or
dealing with vector-valued functions
for which numerical subscripts
normally represent components, we
will prefer to use letter subscripts for
partial derivatives.
of f1 and f2. However, this can lead to problems of ambiguity when compositions of
functions arise. For instance, suppose f .x; y/ D x2y. What should fx.x2; xy/ mean?
By f1.x2; xy/ we clearly mean to evaluate the partial derivative of f .u; v/ D u2v
with respect to its ﬁrst variable u and evaluate the result at u D x2 and v D xy:

In order to avoid such ambiguities we usually prefer to use f1 and f2 instead of fx and
fy. (However, in some situations where no confusion is likely to occur we may still
use the notations fx and fy, and also Dxf; Dyf; @f=@x, and @f=@y.)
All the standard differentiation rules for sums, products, reciprocals, and quotients
continue to apply to partial derivatives.

Deﬁnition 4 can be extended in the obvious way to cover functions of more than two
variables. If f is a function of n variables x1; x2; : : : ; xn, then f has n ﬁrst partial
derivatives, f1.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/, f2.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/, : : : , fn.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/, one with
respect to each variable.

Again, all the standard differentiation rules are applied to calculate partial derivatives.
Remark
If a single-variable function f .x/ has a derivative f 0.a/ at x D a, then f is
necessarily continuous at x D a. This property does not extend to partial derivatives.
Even if all the ﬁrst partial derivatives of a function of several variables exist at a point,
the function may still fail to be continuous at that point. See Exercise 36 below.
Tangent Planes and Normal Lines
If the graph z D f .x; y/ is a “smooth” surface near the point P with coordinates

a; b; f .a; b/

, then that graph will have a tangent plane and a normal line at P: The
normal line is the line through P that is perpendicular to the surface; for instance, a
line joining a point on a sphere to the centre of the sphere is normal to the sphere. Any
nonzero vector that is parallel to the normal line at P is called a normal vector to the
surface at P: The tangent plane to the surface z D f .x; y/ at P is the plane through
P that is perpendicular to the normal line at P:
Let us assume that the surface z D f .x; y/ has a nonvertical tangent plane (and
therefore a nonhorizontal normal line) at point P . (Later in this chapter we will state
precise conditions that guarantee that the graph of a function has a nonvertical tangent
plane at a point.) The tangent plane intersects the vertical plane y D b in a straight line
that is tangent at P to the curve of intersection of the surface z D f .x; y/ and the plane
y D b. (See Figures 12.16 and 12.18.) This line has slope f1.a; b/, so it is parallel to
the vector T1 D iCf1.a; b/k. Similarly, the tangent plane intersects the vertical plane
x D a in a straight line having slope f2.a; b/. This line is therefore parallel to the
vector T2 D j C f2.a; b/k. It follows that the tangent plane, and therefore the surface
z D f .x; y/ itself, has normal vector

This is an optimization problem of a sort we will deal with in a more sys-

we will quickly discover that t D 1 is a solution. The graphs of both sides of the
equation are shown in Figure 12.19(b). They show that t D 1 is the only real solution.

Higher-Order Derivatives
Partial derivatives of second and higher orders are calculated by taking partial deriva-
tives of already calculated partial derivatives. The order in which the differentiations
are performed is indicated in the notations used. If z D f .x; y/, we can calculate four
partial derivatives of second order, namely, two pure second partial derivatives with
respect to x or y,

@x D f11.x; y/ D fxx.x; y/;

Again, we remark that the notations f11, f12, f21, and f22 are usually preferable
to fxx, fxy, fyx, and fyy, although the latter are often used in partial differential
equations. Note that f12 indicates differentiation of f ﬁrst with respect to its ﬁrst
variable and then with respect to its second variable; f21 indicates the opposite order
of differentiation. The subscript closest to f indicates which differentiation occurs
ﬁrst.

In both of the examples above observe that the mixed partial derivatives taken with
respect to the same variables but in different orders turned out to be equal. This is
not a coincidence. It will always occur for sufﬁciently smooth functions. In particular,
the mixed partial derivatives involved are required to be continuous. The following
theorem presents a more precise statement of this important phenomenon.

Equality of mixed partials
Suppose that two mixed nth-order partial derivatives of a function f involve the same
differentiations but in different orders. If those partials are continuous at a point P;
and if f and all partials of f of order less than n are continuous in a neighbourhood
of P; then the two mixed partials are equal at the point P:

PROOF
We shall prove only a representative special case, showing the equality of
f12.a; b/ and f21.a; b/ for a function f of two variables, provided f12 and f21 are
deﬁned and f1, f2, and f are continuous throughout a disk of positive radius centred
at .a; b/, and f12 and f21 are continuous at .a; b/. Let h and k have sufﬁciently small
absolute values that the point .a C h; b C k/ lies in this disk. Then so do all points of
the rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and diagonally opposite corners
at .a; b/ and .a C h; b C k/. (See Figure 12.20.)

single-variable functions u.x/ and v.y/ by
u.x/ D f .x; b C k/  f .x; b/
and
v.y/ D f .a C h; y/  f .a; y/:
Evidently, Q D u.a C h/  u.a/ and also Q D v.b C k/  v.b/. By the (single-
variable) Mean-Value Theorem, there exists a number 1 satisfying 0 < 1 < 1 (so
that a C 1h lies between a and a C h) such that
Q D u.aCh/u.a/ D h u0.aC1h/ D h

:
Now we apply the Mean-Value Theorem again, this time to f1 considered as a function
of its second variable, and obtain another number 2 satisfying 0 < 2 < 1 such that
f1.a C 1h; b C k/  f1.a C 1h; b/ D k f12.a C 1h; b C 2k/:
Thus, Q D hk f12.a C 1h; b C 2k/. Two similar applications of the Mean-Value
BEWARE!
The Mean-Value
Theorem is used four times in this
proof, each time to write a
difference of the form
g.p C m/  g.p/ in the form
g0.c/m, where c is some number
between p and p C m. It is
convenient to write c in the form
p C m, where  is some number
between 0 and 1.
Theorem to Q D v.b C k/  v.b/ lead to Q D hk f21.a C 3h; b C 4k/, where 3
and 4 are two numbers each between 0 and 1. Equating these two expressions for Q
and cancelling the common factor hk, we obtain
f12.a C 1h; b C 2k/ D f21.a C 3h; b C 4k/:
Since f12 and f21 are continuous at .a; b/, we can let h and k approach zero to obtain
f12.a; b/ D f21.a; b/, as required.
Exercise 16 below develops an example of a function for which f12 and f21 exist but
are not continuous at .0; 0/, and for which f12.0; 0/ ¤ f21.0; 0/.

Remark
Partial Derivatives in Maple
When you use the Maple function diff to
calculate a derivative, you must include the name of the variable of differentiation.
For example, diff(x^2+y^3, x)gives the result 2x. It doesn’t matter that the
function being differentiated depends on more than one variable since you are telling
Maple to differentiate with respect to x. If you wanted the derivative with respect to y,
you would input diff(x^2+y^3,y)and the output would be 3y2. In this context,
there is no distinction between ordinary and partial derivatives. There is, however, a
difference when you want to apply a differential operator to a function f: If f is a
function of one variable, you can denote its derivative f 0 in Maple by D(f). For
example,
>
f := x -> sin(2*x); fprime := D(f);
f WD x ! sin.2 x/
fprime WD x ! 2 cos.2 x/
The input fprime(Pi/6) will now give the output 1, as expected.
If f is a function of two (or more) variables, then D(f) no longer makes sense; do
we mean f1 or f2? We distinguish the two (or more) ﬁrst partials by using subscripts
with D.

f := (x,y) -> exp(3*y)*sin(2*x);

fone WD .x; y/ ! 2e.3y/  cos.2 x/
f two WD .x; y/ ! 3e.3y/  sin.2 x/
Higher-order partials are denoted with multiple subscripts (within one set of square
brackets).
>
D[1,1,2](f)(Pi/4, 0);
12
You don’t need to worry about the order of the subscripts in a mixed partial. Maple
assumes the partials are continuous, even if it doesn’t know what the function is. Even
if g has not been assigned any meaning during the current Maple session, the input
D[1,2](g)(x,y)-D[2,1](g)(x,y); produces the output 0.
The Laplace and Wave Equations
Many important and interesting phenomena are modelled by functions of several vari-
ables that satisfy certain partial differential equations. In the following examples we
encounter two particular partial differential equations that arise frequently in mathe-
matics and the physical sciences. Exercises 17–19 below introduce another such equa-
tion with important applications.
EXAMPLE 3
Show that for any real number k the functions
z D ekx cos.ky/
and
z D ekx sin.ky/
satisfy the partial differential equation
@2z
@x2 C @2z
@y2 D 0
at every point in the xy-plane.
Solution
For z D ekx cos.ky/ we have
@z
@x D k ekx cos.ky/;
@2z
@x2 D k2 ekx cos.ky/;
@z
@y D k ekx sin.ky/;
@2z
@y2 D k2 ekx cos.ky/:
Thus,
@2z
@x2 C @2z
@y2 D k2 ekx cos.ky/  k2 ekx cos.ky/ D 0:
The calculation for z D ekx sin.ky/ is similar.
Remark
The partial differential equation in the above example is called the (two-
dimensional) Laplace equation. A function of two variables having continuous sec-
ond partial derivatives in a region of the plane is said to be harmonic there if it satisﬁes
Laplace’s equation. Such functions play a critical role in the theory of differentiable
functions of a complex variable (see Appendix II) and are used to model various phys-
ical quantities such as steady-state temperature distributions, ﬂuid ﬂows, and electric
and magnetic potential ﬁelds. Harmonic functions have many interesting properties.

SECTION 12.4:
Higher-Order Derivatives
701
They have derivatives of all orders, and they are analytic; that is, they are the sums of
their (multivariable) Taylor series. Moreover, a harmonic function can achieve max-
imum and minimum values only on the boundary of its domain. Laplace’s equation,
and therefore harmonic functions, can be considered in any number of dimensions.
(See Exercises 13 and 14 below.)

Thus, w satisﬁes the given differential equation.
Remark
The partial differential equation in the above example is called the (one-
dimensional) wave equation. If t measures time, then f .x  ct/ represents a wave-
form travelling to the right along the x-axis with speed c. (See Figure 12.21.) Simi-
larly, g.x C ct/ represents a waveform travelling to the left with speed c. Unlike the
solutions of Laplace’s equation that must be inﬁnitely differentiable, solutions of the
wave equation need only have enough derivatives to satisfy the differential equation.
The functions f and g are otherwise arbitrary.

SECTION 12.5:
The Chain Rule

The Chain Rule
The Chain Rule for functions of one variable is a formula that gives the derivative of a
composition f

g.x/

of two functions f and g:
d
dx f

g.x/

D f 0
g.x/

g0.x/:
The situation for several variables is more complicated. If f depends on more than
one variable, and any of those variables can be functions of one or more other vari-
ables, we cannot expect a simple formula for partial derivatives of the composition to
cover all possible cases. We must come to think of the Chain Rule as a procedure for
differentiating compositions rather than as a formula for their derivatives. In order to
motivate a formulation of the Chain Rule for functions of two variables, we begin with
a concrete example.
EXAMPLE 1
Suppose you are hiking in a mountainous region for which you
have a map. Let .x; y/ be the coordinates of your position on
the map (i.e., the horizontal coordinates of your actual position in the region). Let
z D f .x; y/ denote the height of land (above sea level, say) at position .x; y/. Suppose
you are walking along a trail so that your position at time t is given by x D u.t/ and
y D v.t/. (These are parametric equations of the trail on the map.) At time t your
altitude above sea level is given by the composite function
z D f

u.t/; v.t/

a function of only one variable. How fast is your altitude changing with respect to time
at time t?

We added 0 to the numerator of the Newton quotient in a creative way so as to separate
the quotient into the sum of two quotients, in the ﬁrst of which the difference of values
of f involves only the ﬁrst variable of f; and in the second of which the difference
involves only the second variable of f: The single-variable Chain Rule suggests that

CHAPTER 12
Partial Differentiation
Note that there are two terms in the expression for dz=dt (or g0.t/), one arising from
each variable of f that depends on t.
Now consider a function f of two variables, x and y, each of which is in turn a
function of two other variables, s and t:
z D f .x; y/;
where
x D u.s; t/
and
y D v.s; t/:
We can form the composite function
z D f

u.s; t/; v.s; t/

D g.s; t/:
For instance, if f .x; y/ D x2 C 3y, where u.s; t/ D st2 and v.s; t/ D s  t, then
g.s; t/ D s2t4 C 3.s  t/.
Let us assume that f; u, and v have ﬁrst partial derivatives with respect to their
respective variables and that those of f are continuous. Then g has ﬁrst partial deriva-
tives given by

We will comment on the signiﬁcance of this matrix form at the end of the next section.
In general, if z is a function of several “primary” variables, and each of these
depends on some “secondary” variables, then the partial derivative of z with respect
to one of the secondary variables will have several terms, one for the contribution to
the derivative arising from each of the primary variables on which z depends.
Remark
Note the signiﬁcance of the various subscripts denoting partial derivatives
in the functional form of the Chain Rule:
g1.s; t/ D f1

u.s; t/; v.s; t/

u1.s; t/ C f2

u.s; t/; v.s; t/

v1.s; t/:
The “1” in g1.s; t/ refers to differentiation with respect to s, the ﬁrst variable on which
g depends. By contrast, the “1” in f1.u.s; t/; v.s; t// refers to differentiation with
respect to x, the ﬁrst variable on which f depends. (This derivative is then evaluated
at x D u.s; t/; y D v.s; t/.)

The following example involves a hybrid application of the Chain Rule to a function
that depends both directly and indirectly on the variable of differentiation.
EXAMPLE 5
Find dz=dt, where z D f .x; y; t/, x D g.t/, and y D h.t/.
(Assume that f; g, and h all have continuous derivatives.)
Solution
Since z depends on t through each of the three variables of f; there will be
three terms in the appropriate Chain Rule:
dz
dt D @z
@x
dx
dt C @z
@y
dy
dt C @z
@t
D f1.x; y; t/g0.t/ C f2.x; y; t/h0.t/ C f3.x; y; t/:
Remark
In the above example we can easily distinguish between the meanings of the
symbols dz=dt and @z=@t. If, however, we had been dealing with the situation
z D f .x; y; s; t/;
where
x D g.s; t/
and
y D h.s; t/;
then the meaning of the symbol @z=@t would be unclear; it could refer to the simple
partial derivative of f with respect to its fourth primary variable (i.e., f4.x; y; s; t/),
or it could refer to the derivative of the composite function f .g.s; t/; h.s; t/; s; t/.
Three of the four primary variables of f depend on t and, therefore, contribute to the
rate of change of z with respect to t. The partial derivative f4.x; y; s; t/ denotes the
contribution of only one of these three variables. It is conventional to use @z=@t to
denote the whole derivative of the composite function with respect to the secondary
variable t:
@z
@t D @
@t f .g.s; t/; h.s; t/; s; t/
D f1.x; y; s; t/g2.s; t/ C f2.x; y; s; t/h2.s; t/ C f4.x; y; s; t/:
When it is necessary, we can denote the contribution coming from the primary variable
t by
@z
@t

x;y;s
D @
@t f .x; y; s; t/ D f4.x; y; s; t/:
Here, the subscripts denote those primary variables of f being held ﬁxed, that is,
whose contributions to the rate of change of z with respect to t are being ignored. Of
course, in the situation described above, .@z=@t/s means the same as @z=@t.
In applications, the variables that contribute to a particular partial derivative will
usually be clear from the context. The following example contains such an application.
This is an example of a procedure called differentiation following the motion.
EXAMPLE 6
Atmospheric temperature depends on position and time. If we de-
note position by three spatial coordinates x, y, and z (measured in
kilometres) and time by t (measured in hours), then the temperature T ıC is a function
of four variables, T .x; y; z; t/.

SECTION 12.5:
The Chain Rule
707
(a) If a thermometer is attached to a weather balloon that moves through the atmo-
sphere on a path with parametric equations x D f .t/, y D g.t/, and z D h.t/,

mometer?
(b) Find the rate of change of the recorded temperature at time t D 1 if
T .x; y; z; t/ D
xy
1 C z .1 C t/;
and if the balloon moves along the curve
x D t;
y D 2t;
z D t  t2:
Solution
(a) Here, the rate of change of the thermometer reading depends on the change in
position of the thermometer as well as increasing time. Thus, none of the four
variables of T can be ignored in the differentiation. The rate is given by
dT
dt D @T
@x
dx
dt C @T
@y
dy
dt C @T
@z

The term @T=@t refers only to the rate of change of the temperature with respect
to time at a ﬁxed position in the atmosphere. The other three terms arise from the
motion of the balloon.
(b) The values of the three coordinates and their derivatives at t D 1 are x D 1,
y D 2, z D 0, dx=dt D 1, dy=dt D 2, and dz=dt D 1. Also, at t D 1,

The recorded temperature is increasing at a rate of 14 ıC/h at time t D 1.
The discussion and examples above show that the Chain Rule for functions of several
variables can take different forms depending on the numbers of variables of the various
functions being composed. As an aid in determining the correct form of the Chain
Rule in a given situation you can construct a chart showing which variables depend

CHAPTER 12
Partial Differentiation
Homogeneous Functions
A function f .x1; : : : ; xn/ is said to be positively homogeneous of degree k if, for
every point .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ in its domain and every real number t > 0, we have
f .tx1; tx2; : : : ; txn/ D tk f .x1; : : : ; xn/:
For example,
f .x; y/ D x2 C xy  y2
is positively homogeneous of degree 2;
f .x; y/ D
p
x2 C y2
is positively homogeneous of degree 1;
f .x; y/ D
2xy
x2 C y2
is positively homogeneous of degree 0;
f .x; y; z/ D x  y C 5z
yz  z2
is positively homogeneous of degree 1;
f .x; y/ D x2 C y
is not positively homogeneous:
Observe that a positively homogeneous function of degree 0 remains constant along
rays from the origin. More generally, along such rays a positively homogeneous func-
tion of degree k grows or decays proportionally to the kth power of distance from the
origin.

Higher-Order Derivatives
Applications of the Chain Rule to higher-order derivatives can become quite compli-
cated. It is important to keep in mind at each stage which variables are independent of
one another.
EXAMPLE 8
Calculate
@2
@x@y f .x2  y2; xy/ in terms of partial derivatives of

Solution
In this problem symbols for the primary variables on which f depends are

f
Figure 12.24
Chart showing the
dependence of f on x and y through the
primary variables u and v in Example 8
not stated explicitly. Let them be u and v. (See Figure 12.24.) The problem therefore
asks us to ﬁnd
@2
@x@y f .u; v/;
where
u D x2  y2
and
v D xy:

SECTION 12.5:
The Chain Rule
709
First differentiate with respect to y:
@
@y f .u; v/ D 2yf1.u; v/ C xf2.u; v/:
Now differentiate this result with respect to x. Note that the second term on the right
is a product of two functions of x, so we need to use the Product Rule:
@2
@x@y f .u; v/ D  2y

2xf11.u; v/ C yf12.u; v/

C f2.u; v/ C x

2xf21.u; v/ C yf22.u; v/

Df2.u; v/  4xyf11.u; v/ C 2.x2  y2/f12.u; v/ C xyf22.u; v/:
In the last step we have used the fact that the mixed partials of f are continuous, so we
could equate f12 and f21.
Review the above calculation very carefully and make sure you understand what is
being done at each step. Note that all the derivatives of f that appear are evaluated at
.u; v/ D .x2  y2; xy/, not at .x; y/, because x and y are not themselves the primary
variables on which f depends.
Remark
The kind of calculation done in the above example (and the following ones)
is easily carried out by a computer algebra system. In Maple:
>
g := (x,y) -> f(x^2 - y^2, x*y):
simplify(D[1,2](g)(x,y));
4yD1;1.f /.x2  y2; xy/x  2  D1;2.f /.x2  y2; xy/y2

which, on close inspection, is the same answer we calculated in the example.
EXAMPLE 9

Solution
It is possible to do this in two different ways; we can start with either side
and use the Chain Rule to show that it is equal to the other side. Here, we will calculate
the partial derivatives with respect to r and  that appear on the left side and express
them in terms of partial derivatives with respect to x and y. The other approach,
involving expressing partial derivatives with respect to x and y in terms of partial
derivatives with respect to r and , is a little more difﬁcult. (See Exercise 24 at the
end of this section.) However, we would have to do it that way if we were not given the
form of the differential equation in polar coordinates and had to ﬁnd it.
First, note that
@x

@x
@ D r sin ;
@y
@r D sin ;

and @z=@y depend on x and y and, therefore, on r and .

Remark
The initial-value problem in Exercise 34 gives the
small lateral displacement u.x; t/ at position x at time t of a
vibrating string held under tension along the x-axis. The function
p.x/ gives the initial displacement at position x, that is, the
displacement at time t D 0. Similarly, q.x/ gives the initial
velocity at position x. Observe that the position at time t depends
only on values of these initial data at points no further than ct
units away. This is consistent with the previous observation that
the solutions of the wave equation represent waves travelling with
speed c.

Here, L.x/ is the linearization of f at a; its graph is the tangent line to y D f .x/
there. The mere existence of f 0.a/ is sufﬁcient to guarantee that the error in the
approximation (the vertical distance between the curve and tangent at x) is small com-
pared with the distance h D x  a between a and x, that is,

Unlike the single-variable case, the mere existence of the partial derivatives f1.a; b/

error in the linearization is small compared with the distance

between .a; b/ and .x; y/. We adopt this latter condition as our deﬁnition of what it
means for a function of two variables to be differentiable at a point.

CHAPTER 12
Partial Differentiation
DEFINITION
5
We say that the function f .x; y/ is differentiable at the point .a; b/ if
lim
.h;k/!.0;0/
f .a C h; b C k/  f .a; b/  h f1.a; b/  kf2.a; b/
p
h2 C k2
D 0:
This deﬁnition and the following theorems can be generalized to functions of any num-
ber of variables in the obvious way. For the sake of simplicity, we state them for the
two-variable case only.
The function f .x; y/ is differentiable at the point .a; b/ if and only if the surface
z D f .x; y/ has a nonvertical tangent plane at .a; b/. This implies that f1.a; b/ and
f2.a; b/ must exist and that f must be continuous at .a; b/. (Recall, however, that the
existence of the partial derivatives does not even imply that f is continuous, let alone
differentiable.) In particular, the function is continuous wherever it is differentiable.
We will prove a two-variable version of the Mean-Value Theorem and use it to show
that functions are differentiable wherever they have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives.

A Mean-Value Theorem
If f1.x; y/ and f2.x; y/ are continuous in a neighbourhood of the point .a; b/, and if
the absolute values of h and k are sufﬁciently small, then there exist numbers 1 and
2, each between 0 and 1, such that
f .a C h; b C k/  f .a; b/ D hf1.a C 1h; b C k/ C kf2.a; b C 2k/:
PROOF
The proof of this theorem is very similar to that of Theorem 1 in Section 12.4,
so we give only a sketch here. The reader can ﬁll in the details. Write

f .aCh; bCk/f .a; bCk/

;
and then apply the single-variable Mean-Value Theorem separately to f .x; b C k/ on
the interval between a and a C h, and to f .a; y/ on the interval between b and b C k
to get the desired result.

Since f1 and f2 are continuous at .a; b/, each of these latter terms approaches 0 as h
and k approach 0. This is what we needed to prove.
We illustrate differentiability with an example where we can calculate directly the error
in the tangent plane approximation.
EXAMPLE 2
Calculate f .x C h; y C k/  f .x; y/  f1.x; y/h  f2.x; y/k if
f .x; y/ D x3 C xy2.
Solution
Since f1.x; y/ D 3x2 C y2 and f2.x; y/ D 2xy, we have
f .x C h; y C k/  f .x; y/  f1.x; y/h  f2.x; y/k

D 3xh2 C h3 C 2yhk C hk2 C xk2:
Observe that the result above is a polynomial in h and k with no term of degree less
than 2 in these variables. Therefore, this difference approaches zero like the square
of the distance
p
h2 C k2 from .x; y/ to .x C h; y C k/ as .h; k/ ! .0; 0/, so the
condition for differentiability is certainly satisﬁed:

This quadratic behaviour is the case for any function f with continuous second partial
derivatives. (See Exercise 23 below.)

case of the Chain Rule for multivariate functions.

The proof for w2 is similar.
Differentials
If the ﬁrst partial derivatives of a function z D f .x1; : : : ; xn/ exist at a point, we may
construct a differential dz or df of the function at that point in a manner similar to
that used for functions of one variable:
dz D df D @z

@x2
dx2 C    C @z
@xn
dxn
D f1.x1; : : : ; xn/ dx1 C    C fn.x1; : : : ; xn/ dxn:
Here, the differential dz is considered to be a function of the 2n independent variables
x1, x2, : : : , xn, dx1, dx2, : : : , dxn.
For a differentiable function f; the differential df is an approximation to the
change f in value of the function given by
f D f .x1 C dx1; : : : ; xn C dxn/  f .x1; : : : ; xn/:
The error in this approximation is small compared with the distance between the two
points in the domain of f I that is,
f  df
p
.dx1/2 C    C .dxn/2 ! 0

In this sense, differentials are just another way of looking at linearization.

Functions from n-Space to m-Space
(This is an optional topic.) A vector f D .f1; f2; : : : ; fm/ of m functions, each depend-
ing on n variables .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/, deﬁnes a transformation (i.e., a function) from Rn
to Rm; speciﬁcally, if x D .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ is a point in Rn, and
y1 D f1.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/
y2 D f2.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/

then y D .y1; y2; : : : ; ym/ is the point in Rm that corresponds to x under the
transformation f. We can write these equations more compactly as
y D f.x/:

If the partial derivatives in the Jacobian matrix are continuous, we say that f is differ-
entiable at x. In this case the linear transformation (see Section 10.7) represented by
the Jacobian matrix is called the derivative of the transformation f.
Remark
We can regard the scalar-valued function of two variables, f .x; y/ say, as
a transformation from R2 to R. Its derivative is then the linear transformation with

It is not our purpose to enter into a study of such vector-valued functions of a vector
variable at this point, but we can observe here that the Jacobian matrix of the compo-
sition of two such transformations is the matrix product of their Jacobian matrices.

For transformations between spaces of the same dimension (say from Rn to Rn), the
corresponding Jacobian matrices are square and have determinants. These Jacobian
determinants will play an important role in our consideration of implicit functions and
inverse functions in Section 12.8 and in changes of variables in multiple integrals in
Chapter 14.
Maple’s VectorCalculus package has a function Jacobian that takes two inputs,
a list (or vector) of expressions and a list of variables, and produces the Jacobian ma-
trix of the partial derivatives of those expressions with respect to the variables. For

Differentials in Applications
Differentials are sometimes used as an alternative representation for differentiable
functions. This is particularly so in the ﬁeld of thermodynamics. In thermodynamics,
physical states of thermodynamic equilibrium are expressed mathematically in terms
of the existence of a function,
E D E.S; V; N1; : : : ; Nn/;
where E is internal energy, S is entropy, V is volume, and the Ni are numbers of atoms
or molecules of type i.
These quantities are interpreted physically, but they are just independent variables
in a function to which normal mathematical rules apply. Discussion of the physical
meaning of a quantity like entropy, for example, is largely beyond the scope of this
book. (One might remark that entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of
underlying physical states that appear indistinguishable on human scales, but such a
description is completely unnecessary for this discussion.) E.S; V; N1; : : : ; Nn/ is
known as a function of state. Any explicit equation relating thermodynamic variables
is also known as an equation of state.

720
CHAPTER 12
Partial Differentiation
Thermodynamics allows for any number of such variables to deﬁne the state.
There can be others than those indicated for different physical systems. All such vari-
ables are additive in that, for example, the energy of two physical systems together is
simply the sum of the energies of each system. The same is true for volume, entropy,
and number. These additive variables are called extensive variables. In thermodynam-
ics they are referred to as state variables or as state functions. That is because any one
of the other variables can be expressed as a function of E and the remaining variables.
For example, S D S.E; V; N1; : : : ; Nn/.
Differentials appear in thermodynamics as the normal way to express the existence
of a state function. In writing
dE D @E
@S dS C @E
@V dV C @E
@N1
dN1 C    C @E
@Nn
dNn;
we are saying that E depends on the variables whose differentials appear on the right
side of the equation. In fact, everything is so effectively done with differentials that
often no explicit function E is needed or even known.
Historically, the differential was also meant to convey an intuitive sense of change
in time, even though mathematically it is simply the differential of a function. In
fact, this historical interpretation can be quite confusing, because, paradoxically, the
existence of the function of state, and its differential, means the physical system is in
thermodynamic equilibrium, which can be described as a time-independent condition
of a physical system. If it were not in (timeless) thermodynamic equilibrium, there
would be no state function and no corresponding differentials. The resolution of the
paradox is to stick to the mathematics, remembering that the differential only depicts
a change in the values of variables and not any external process.
So, for example, the state equation has nothing to do with whether some process is
slow or not. Differentials in this case do not suggest a physical process any more than
the differential of any other function does. The differential only expresses the content
of the function, so it has nothing to do with the physical processes that cause changes,
or with whether any change is carried out slowly (reversible processes) or not.
The partial derivatives that appear in the differential form of the state equation
also have explicit physical interpretations: @E
@S is temperature T; @E
@V is pressure P;
and the quantities @E
@Ni
are known as chemical potentials, i. These partial derivatives
represent slopes on the graph of the function of state, and as such they are not additive.
It makes no sense, for example, to add temperatures. Physically, these slopes deﬁne
a condition rather than an amount. These nonadditive quantities are called intensive
variables.
With these deﬁnitions substituted, the differential form of the equation of state
becomes
dE D T dS  P dV C 1 dN1 C    C n dNn;
which is known as the Gibbs equation. However, despite the special treatment, this ex-
pression remains simply the differential of E.S; V; N1; : : : ; Nn/. The Gibbs equation
is a fundamental starting point in many thermodynamical problems.
Another related, and well-known, equation of differentials is the Gibbs-Duhem
equation,
0 D S dT  V dP C N1 d1 C    C Nn dn:
This remarkable equation indicates that the intensive variables of thermodynamics are
not independent of each other. It holds because the additivity of the extensive vari-
ables implies that the function of state, E D E.S; V; N1; : : : ; Nn/, is homogeneous of
degree 1. (See Exercise 24 at the end of this section.)

Differentials and Legendre Transformations
It is often useful to shift the dependence of a function on one or more of its indepen-
dent variables to dependence on, instead, the derivatives of the function with respect to
these variables. Consider, for example, the function y D f .x/, and denote its deriva-
tive by p; that is, p D f 0.x/. If we let u D px  f .x/ and calculate the differential
of u, treating x and p as independent variables, we obtain
du D p dx C x dp  f 0.x/ dx D p dx C x dp  p dx D x dp:
Since there is no dx term remaining in this differential, u does not depend explicitly
on x, but only on p. Let us therefore deﬁne f .p/ D u D px  f .x/. f .p/ is
called the Legendre transformation of f .x/ with respect to x, and the two variables x
and p are said to be conjugate to one another. Observe that
f .x/ C f .p/ D px;
and the symmetry of this equation indicates that f must also be the Legendre trans-
formation of f ; f  D f: In fact, taking the partial derivatives of the equation with
respect to x and p we obtain the symmetric relationships
f 0.x/ D p
and
.f /0.p/ D x
from which it is apparent that f 0 and .f /0 are inverse functions;
f 0
.f /0.p/

D p;
.f /0
f 0.x/

D x:
Remark
The above deﬁnition of f  clearly shows the symmetry in its relationship
with f: An alternative transformation, f .p/ (i.e., the function f .x/  px) shifts
dependence between a variable and the derivative of the function just as effectively,
although it does not share this symmetry. In some ﬁelds, particularly thermodynamics,
this alternative is known as the Legendre transformation instead.
EXAMPLE 5
Calculate the Legendre transformation f .p/ of the function
f .x/ D ex.
Solution
Here p D f 0.x/ D ex, so x D ln p. Therefore,
f .p/ D px  f .x/ D p ln p  p:
For functions of several variables, Legendre transformations can be taken with
respect to one or more of the independent variables. If u D f .x; y/, p D f1.x; y/,
and q D f2.x; y/, and if w D px C qy  u, then
dw D p dx C x dp C q dy C y dq  f1.x; y/ dx  f2.x; y/ dy D x dp C y dq
and w does not depend explicitly on x or y, but only on p and q. We can call w.p; q/
(or w.p; q/ if we are doing thermodynamics) the Legendre transformation of f .x; y/
with respect to x and y, and treat both fx; pg and fy; qg as conjugate pairs of variables.
Observe that
f1.x; y/ D p
f2.x; y/ D q
and
w1.p; q/ D x
w2.p; q/ D y:
Returning to thermodynamics, the Gibbs equation tells us that E depends on S,
V , and Ni. Since T D @E
@S , T and S are conjugate and we can express energy in terms
of temperature rather than entropy by using an (alternative) Legendre transformation.

Partial Differentiation
Thus, F D F.T; V; N1; : : : ; Nn/: F is known as the Helmholtz free energy, which is
called a thermodynamic potential. It can be more practical to use F; which depends
explicitly on T; rather than E when an experiment is run at constant temperature.
Legendre transformations can be done in terms of any or all of the conjugate pairs.
In the case of the Helmholtz free energy, only the conjugates T and S are used. Other
speciﬁc Legendre transformations lead to other thermodynamic potentials. For exam-
ple, the Gibbs free energy, G D E  TS C P V; is widely used in chemistry, where
processes normally take place at constant temperature and pressure. (See Exercise 30
below.)
Legendre transformations are very important in other areas of classical and mod-
ern physics. Historically, they appear in classical mechanics, where the functional
expression of the energy, known as the Hamiltonian, is expressed in terms of Legendre
transformations of a function known as the Lagrangian. (See Exercise 32 for a problem
developing this relationship.) These notions extend to modern physics, which is often
cast in terms of Lagrangians.

In classical mechanics, the energy of a system is expressed in

is independent of time, the Hamiltonian depends only on the
positions, qi, and the momenta, pi, of the particles in the
system, that is, H D H.q1;    ; qn; p1;    ; pn/. There is also
another function, called the Lagrangian, that depends on the
positions qi and the velocities Pqi, that is,
L D L.q1;    ; qn; Pq1;    ; Pqn/, such that the Hamiltonian is a

Gradients and Directional Derivatives
A ﬁrst partial derivative of a function of several variables gives the rate of change of
that function with respect to distance measured in the direction of one of the coordinate
axes. In this section we will develop a method for ﬁnding the rate of change of such
a function with respect to distance measured in any direction in the domain of the
function.
To begin, it is useful to combine the ﬁrst partial derivatives of a function into a
single vector function called a gradient. For simplicity, we will develop and interpret
the gradient for functions of two variables. Extension to functions of three or more
variables is straightforward and will be discussed later in this section.
DEFINITION
6
At any point .x; y/ where the ﬁrst partial derivatives of the function f .x; y/
exist, we deﬁne the gradient vector rf .x; y/ D grad f .x; y/ by
rf .x; y/ D grad f .x; y/ D f1.x; y/i C f2.x; y/j:
Recall that i and j denote the unit basis vectors from the origin to the points .1; 0/
and .0; 1/, respectively. The symbol r, called del or nabla, is a vector differential
operator:
r D i @
@x C j @
@y :
We can apply this operator to a function f .x; y/ by writing the operator to the left of
the function. The result is the gradient of the function

If f .x; y/ D x2 C y2, then rf .x; y/ D 2xi C 2yj. In particular,
rf .1; 2/ D 2i C 4j. Observe that this vector is perpendicular to
the tangent line x C 2y D 5 to the circle x2 C y2 D 5 at .1; 2/. This circle is the level
curve of f that passes through the point .1; 2/. (See Figure 12.26.) As the following
theorem shows, this perpendicularity is not a coincidence.

Directional Derivatives
The ﬁrst partial derivatives f1.a; b/ and f2.a; b/ give the rates of change of f .x; y/
at .a; b/ measured in the directions of the positive x- and y-axes, respectively. If we
want to know how fast f .x; y/ changes value as we move through the domain of f at
.a; b/ in some other direction, we require a more general directional derivative. We
can specify the direction by means of a nonzero vector. It is most convenient to use a
unit vector.
DEFINITION
7
Let u D ui C vj be a unit vector, so that u2 C v2 D 1. The directional
derivative of f .x; y/ at .a; b/ in the direction of u is the rate of change of
f .x; y/ with respect to distance measured at .a; b/ along a ray in the direction

Remark
This is nothing more than the basic derivative in one variable disguised by
the complications arising when u is not parallel to either coordinate axis. The line L
through .a; b/ parallel to u is given by the position vector r.t/ D ai C bj C tu. If we
regard L as a single coordinate axis with position on it given by the coordinate t and

for any t along L. Similarly, if we return to the original axes and choose a direction par-

We already know that having partial derivatives at a point does not imply that a func-
tion is continuous there, let alone that it is differentiable. The same can be said about
directional derivatives. It is possible for a function to have a directional derivative
in every direction at a given point and still not be continuous at that point.
See
Exercise 37 for an example of such a function.
Given any nonzero vector v, we can always obtain a unit vector in the same di-
rection by dividing v by its length. The directional derivative of f at .a; b/ in the
direction of v is therefore given by
Dv=jvjf .a; b/ D v
jvj  rf .a; b/:
Remark
When trying to understand why u must be a unit vector for calculating a
directional derivative by the formula in Theorem 7, it helps to think of the directional
derivative as a simple derivative with respect to a parameter t along the line L, de-
scribed by a position vector r.t/ as described in the remark preceeding the statement
of the theorem. As in that remark, we have

change with respect to distance or arc length, s D t. Given the formula for arc length

If we move along the surface z D f .x; y/ through the point .0; 1; 1/ in a direction

Note the use of the symbol Df .x; y/ to denote a derivative of f with respect to

As observed in the previous example, Theorem 7 provides a useful interpretation
for the gradient vector. For any unit vector u we have
Duf .a; b/ D u  rf .a; b/ D jrf .a; b/j cos ;
where  is the angle between the vectors u and rf .a; b/. Since cos  only takes
on values between 1 and 1, Duf .a; b/ only takes on values between jrf .a; b/j
and jrf .a; b/j. Moreover, Duf .a; b/ D jrf .a; b/j if and only if u points in the
opposite direction to rf .a; b/ (so that cos  D 1), and Duf .a; b/ D jrf .a; b/j
if and only if u points in the same direction as rf .a; b/ (so that cos  D 1). The
directional derivative is zero in the direction  D =2; this is the direction of the
(tangent line to the) level curve of f through .a; b/.
We summarize these properties of the gradient as follows:
Geometric properties of the gradient vector
(i) At .a; b/, f .x; y/ increases most rapidly in the direction of the gradient
vector rf .a; b/. The maximum rate of increase is jrf .a; b/j.
(ii) At .a; b/, f .x; y/ decreases most rapidly in the direction of rf .a; b/.
The maximum rate of decrease is jrf .a; b/j.
(iii) The rate of change of f .x; y/ at .a; b/ is zero in directions tangent to the
level curve of f that passes through .a; b/.
Look again at the topographic map in Figure 12.6 in Section 12.1. The streams on
the map ﬂow in the direction of steepest descent, that is, in the direction of rf;
where f measures the elevation of land. The streams therefore cross the contours (the
level curves of f ) at right angles. Like the stream, an experienced skier might choose
a downhill path close to the direction of the negative gradient, while a novice skier
would prefer to stay closer to the level curves.

EXAMPLE 4
A hiker is standing beside a stream on the side of a mountain,
examining her map of the region. The height of land (in metres) at
any point .x; y/ is given by the function
h.x; y/ D
20;000
3 C x2 C 2y2 ;
where x and y (in kilometres) denote the coordinates of the point on the hiker’s map.
The hiker is at the point .3; 2/.
(a) What is the direction of ﬂow of the stream at .3; 2/ on the hiker’s map? How fast
is the stream descending at her location?
(b) Find the equation of the path of the stream on the hiker’s map.
(c) At what angle to the path of the stream (on the map) should the hiker set out if she
wishes to climb at a 15ı inclination to the horizontal?
(d) Make a sketch of the hiker’s map, showing some curves of constant elevation, and
showing the stream.
Solution
(a) We begin by calculating the gradient of h and its length at .3; 2/:

.3 C x2 C 2y2/2 .2xi C 4yj/;
rh.3; 2/ D 100.3i C 4j/;

The stream is ﬂowing in the direction whose horizontal projection at .3; 2/ is
rh.3; 2/, that is, in the horizontal direction of the vector 3i C 4j. The stream is
descending at a rate of 500 m/km, that is, 0.5 m per horizontal metre travelled.
(b) Coordinates on the map are the coordinates .x; y/ in the domain of the height
function h. We can ﬁnd an equation of the path of the stream on a map of the
region by setting up a differential equation for a change of position along the path.
If the vector dr D dx i C dy j is tangent to the path of the stream at point .x; y/
on the map, then dr is parallel to rh.x; y/. Hence, the components of these two
vectors are proportional:
dx
2x D dy
4y
or
dy
y D 2dx
x :

SECTION 12.7:

729
Integrating both sides of this equation, we get ln y D 2 ln x C ln C, or y D Cx2.
Since the path of the stream passes through .3; 2/, we have C D 2=9 and the
equation is 9y D 2x2.
(c) Suppose the hiker moves away from .3; 2/ in the direction of the unit vector u.
She will be ascending at an inclination of 15ı if the directional derivative of h in
the direction of u is 1;000 tan 15ı  268. (The 1,000 compensates for the fact that
the vertical units are metres while the horizontal units are kilometres.) If  is the
angle between u and the upstream direction, then
500 cos  D jrh.3; 2/j cos  D Duh.3; 2/  268:
Hence, cos   0:536 and   57:6ı. She should set out in a direction making a
horizontal angle of about 58ı with the upstream direction.

Rates Perceived by a Moving Observer
Suppose that an observer is moving around in the xy-plane measuring the value of
a function f .x; y/ deﬁned in the plane as he passes through each point .x; y/. (For
instance, f .x; y/ might be the temperature at .x; y/.) If the observer is moving with
velocity v at the instant when he passes through the point .a; b/, how fast would he
observe f .x; y/ to be changing at that moment?

730
CHAPTER 12
Partial Differentiation
At the moment in question the observer is moving in the direction of the unit
vector v=jvj. The rate of change of f .x; y/ at .a; b/ in that direction is
Dv=jvjf .a; b/ D v
jvj  rf .a; b/
measured in units of f per unit distance in the xy-plane. To convert this rate to units
of f per unit time, we must multiply by the speed of the observer, jvj units of distance
per unit time. Thus, the time rate of change of f .x; y/ as measured by the observer
passing through .a; b/ is
jvj v
jvj  rf .a; b/ D v  rf .a; b/:
It is natural to extend our use of the symbol Dvf .a; b/ to represent this rate even
though v is not (necessarily) a unit vector. Thus, we have established the following
principle:
The rate of change of f .x; y/ at .a; b/ as measured by an observer moving
through .a; b/ with velocity v is
Dvf .a; b/ D v  rf .a; b/
units of f per unit time.
If the hiker in Example 4 moves away from .3; 2/ with horizontal velocity v D i  j

D 7
10 km/h:
As deﬁned here, Dvf is the spatial component of the derivative of f following the
motion. See Example 6 in Section 12.5. The rate of change of the reading on the
moving thermometer in that example can be expressed as
dT
dt D DvT .x; y; z; t/ C @T
@t ;
where v is the velocity of the moving thermometer and DvT D vrT: The gradient is
being taken with respect to the three spatial variables only. (See below for the gradient
in 3-space.)
The Gradient in Three and More Dimensions
By analogy with the two-dimensional case, a function f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ of n variables
possessing ﬁrst partial derivatives has gradient given by
rf .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ D @f
@x1
e1 C @f
@x2
e2 C    C @f
@xn
en;
where ej is the unit vector from the origin to the unit point on the j th coordinate axis.
In particular, for a function of three variables,
rf .x; y; z/ D @f
@x i C @f
@y j C @f
@z k:
The level surface of f .x; y; z/ passing through .a; b; c/ has a tangent plane there if f
is differentiable at .a; b; c/ and rf .a; b; c/ ¤ 0.
For functions of any number of variables, the vector rf .P0/ is normal to the
“level surface” of f passing through the point P0 (i.e., the (hyper)surface with equation
f .x1; : : : ; xn/ D f .P0/), and, if f is differentiable at P0, the rate of change of f at
P0 in the direction of the unit vector u is given by u  rf .P0/. Equations of tangent
planes to surfaces in 3-space can be found easily with the aid of gradients.

BEWARE!
Make sure you
understand the difference between
the graph of a function and a level
curve or level surface of that
function. (See the discussion
following this example.) Here, the
surface z D f .x; y/ is the graph of
the function f; but it is also a level
surface of a different function g.
z D f .a; b/ C f1.a; b/.x  a/ C f2.a; b/.y  b/:
(See Figure 12.31.) This result was obtained by a different argument in Section 12.3.
Students sometimes confuse graphs of functions with level curves or surfaces of those
functions. In the above example, we are talking about a level surface of the function
g.x; y; z/ that happens to coincide with the graph of a different function, f .x; y/. Do
not confuse that surface with the graph of g, which is a three-dimensional hypersurface
in 4-space having equation w D g.x; y; z/. Similarly, do not confuse the tangent plane
to the graph of f .x; y/ (i.e., the plane obtained in the above example) with the tangent
line to the level curve of f .x; y/ passing through .a; b/ and lying in the xy-plane. This
line has an equation involving only x and y: f1.a; b/.x  a/ C f2.a; b/.y  b/ D 0.

Remark
Maple’s VectorCalculus package deﬁnes a function Gradient that takes a
pair of arguments—an expression and a list of variables—and produces the gradient of
the expression with respect to those variables:
>
with(VectorCalculus):
>
f := x^2+y^3+z^4; G := Gradient(f, [x,y,z]);
f WD x2 C y3 C z4
G WD 2 x Nex C 3 y2 Ney C 4 z3 Nez
Although the result for G looks like a vector, it is actually something different, namely
a vector ﬁeld, which is a vector-valued function of a vector variable. This fact is
conveyed by the bars that appear over the basis vectors in the output. We will deal
extensively with vector ﬁelds in Chapters 15 and 16 and will say little about them here
except to note that evaluating the Gradient at a particular point requires the evalVF
function, which takes two arguments: a vector ﬁeld and a vector at which to evaluate
it.
>
evalVF(G,<2,3,-1>);

Observe that the output is a vector, not a vector ﬁeld; there are no bars on the basis
vectors.
If you want to deﬁne a gradient function (let us call it grad) such that you would
get the above value by using the input grad(f)(2,3,-1), you could use

grad := g -> ((u,v,w) ->

evalVF(Gradient(g,[x,y,z]),<u,v,w>));

0;
if .x; y/ D .0; 0/.
Use the deﬁnition of directional derivative as a limit
(Deﬁnition 7) to show that Duf .0; 0/ exists for every unit
vector u D ui C vj in the plane. Speciﬁcally, show that
Duf .0; 0/ D 0 if v D 0, and Duf .0; 0/ D 2u2=v if v ¤ 0.
However, as was shown in Example 4 in Section 12.2, f .x; y/
has no limit as .x; y/ ! .0; 0/, so it is not continuous there.
Even if a function has directional derivatives in all directions
at a point, it may not be continuous at that point.
12.8
Implicit Functions
When we study the calculus of functions of one variable, we encounter examples of
functions that are deﬁned implicitly as solutions of equations in two variables. Sup-
pose, for example, that F.x; y/ D 0 is such an equation. Suppose that the point .a; b/
satisﬁes the equation and that F has continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives (and so is dif-
ferentiable) at all points near .a; b/. Can the equation be solved for y as a function
of x near .a; b/? That is, does there exist a function y.x/ deﬁned in some interval
I D .a  h; a C h/ (where h > 0) satisfying y.a/ D b and such that
F

x; y.x/

D 0
holds for all x in the interval I? If there is such a function y.x/, we can try to ﬁnd its
derivative at x D a by differentiating the equation F.x; y/ D 0 implicitly with respect
to x, and evaluating the result at .a; b/:
F1.x; y/ C F2.x; y/ dy
dx D 0;
so that

F2.a; b/;
provided
F2.a; b/ ¤ 0:
Observe, however, that the condition F2.a; b/ ¤ 0 required for the calculation of
y0.a/ will itself guarantee that the solution y.x/ exists. This condition, together with
the differentiability of F.x; y/ near .a; b/, implies that the level curve F.x; y/ D
F.a; b/ has nonvertical tangent lines near .a; b/, so some part of the level curve near
.a; b/ must be the graph of a function of x. (See Figure 12.32; the part of the curve
F.x; y/ D 0 in the shaded disk centred at P0 D .a; b/ is the graph of a function y.x/
because vertical lines meet that part of the curve only once. The only points on the
curve where a disk with that property cannot be drawn are the three points V1, V2,
and V3, where the curve has a vertical tangent, that is, where F2.x; y/ D 0.) This is
a special case of the Implicit Function Theorem, which we will state more generally
later in this section.

The equation F.x; y/ D 0
can be solved for y as a function of x near
P0 or near any other point except the three
points V1, V2, and V3, where the curve has
vertical tangent lines
A similar situation holds for equations involving several variables. We can, for
example, ask whether the equation
F.x; y; z/ D 0

SECTION 12.8:
Implicit Functions
735
deﬁnes z as a function of x and y (say, z D z.x; y/) near some point P0 with coordi-
nates .x0; y0; z0/ satisfying the equation. If so, and if F has continuous ﬁrst partials
near P0, then the partial derivatives of z can be found at .x0; y0/ by implicit differen-
tiation of the equation F.x; y; z/ D 0 with respect to x and y:
F1.x; y; z/ C F3.x; y; z/ @z
@x D 0
and
F2.x; y; z/ C F3.x; y; z/ @z

F3.x0; y0; z0/;
provided F3.x0; y0; z0/ ¤ 0. Since F3 is the z component of the gradient of F; this
condition implies that the level surface of F through P0 does not have a horizontal
normal vector, so it is not vertical (i.e., it is not parallel to the z-axis). Therefore, part
of the surface near P0 must indeed be the graph of a function z D z.x; y/. Similarly,
F.x; y; z/ D 0 can be solved for x as a function of y and z near points where F1 ¤ 0
and for y D y.x; z/ near points where F2 ¤ 0.
EXAMPLE 1
Near what points on the sphere x2Cy2 Cz2 D 1 can the equation
of the sphere be solved for z as a function of x and y? Find @z=@x
and @z=@y at such points.
Solution
The sphere is the level surface F.x; y; z/ D 0 of the function
F.x; y; z/ D x2 C y2 C z2  1:
The above equation can be solved for z D z.x; y/ near P0 D .x0; y0; z0/, provided
that P0 is not on the equator of the sphere, that is, the circle x2 C y2 D 1, z D 0.
The equator consists of those points that satisfy F3.x; y; z/ D 0. If P0 is not on the
equator, then it is on either the upper or the lower hemisphere. The upper hemisphere
has equation z D z.x; y/ D

Systems of Equations
Experience with linear equations shows us that systems of such equations can generally
be solved for as many variables as there are equations in the system. We would expect,
therefore, that a pair of equations in several variables might determine two of those
variables as functions of the remaining ones. For instance, we might expect the two
equations
 F.x; y; z; w/ D 0
G.x; y; z; w/ D 0
to possess, near some point that satisﬁes them, solutions of one or more of the forms
 x D x.z; w/
y D y.z; w/;
 x D x.y; w/
z D z.y; w/;
 x D x.y; z/
w D w.y; z/;

z D z.x; w/;
 y D y.x; z/
w D w.x; z/;
 z D z.x; y/
w D w.x; y/:
Where such solutions exist, we should be able to differentiate the given system of
equations implicitly to ﬁnd partial derivatives of the solutions.
If you are given a single equation F.x; y; z/ D 0 and asked to ﬁnd @x=@z, you
would understand that x is intended to be a function of the remaining variables y and
z, so there would be no chance of misinterpreting which variable is to be held constant
in calculating the partial derivative. Suppose, however, that you are asked to calculate
@x=@z given the system F.x; y; z; w/ D 0, G.x; y; z; w/ D 0. The question implies
that x is one of the dependent variables and z is one of the independent variables, but
does not imply which of y and w is the other dependent variable and which is the other
independent variable. In short, which of the situations
 x D x.z; w/
y D y.z; w/
and
 x D x.y; z/
w D w.y; z/
are we dealing with? As it stands, the question is ambiguous. To avoid this ambiguity,
we can specify in the notation for the partial derivative which variable is to be regarded
as the other independent variable and therefore held ﬁxed during the differentiation.
Thus,

EXAMPLE 2
Given the equations F.x; y; z; w/ D 0 and G.x; y; z; w/ D 0,
where F and G have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives, calculate
.@x=@z/w.
Solution
We differentiate the two equations with respect to z, regarding x and y as
functions of z and w, and holding w ﬁxed:
F1
@x
@z C F2
@y
@z C F3 D 0
G1
@x
@z C G2
@y
@z C G3 D 0
(Note that the terms F4.@w=@z/ and G4.@w=@z/ are not present because w and z are
independent variables, and w is being held ﬁxed during the differentiation.) The pair of
equations above is linear in @x=@z and @y=@z. Eliminating @y=@z (or using Cramer’s
Rule, Theorem 6 of Section 10.7), we obtain

In the light of the examples considered above, you should not be too surprised to
learn that the nonvanishing of the denominator F1G2  F2G1 at some point P0 D
.x0; y0; z0; w0/ satisfying the system F D 0, G D 0 is sufﬁcient to guarantee that the
system does indeed have a solution of the form x D x.z; w/, y D y.z; w/ near P0.
We will not, however, attempt to prove this fact here.

At x D 2, y D 1 the ﬁrst equation immediately gives .@x=@u/y D 1=3.
E
Choosing Dependent and Independent Variables
Some applications involve several variables that must satisfy a smaller number of equa-
tions. The question naturally arises concerning which variables should be considered
independent. Typically, if there are n equations to be satisﬁed by n C m variables,
we can choose any n of the variables to be considered as functions of the remaining
m independent variables; in theory, at least, it is possible to solve the n equations for
any n of the variables. However, applications often come with conventions that prefer
one set of variables over others. For example, in Section 12.6 we introduced the exten-
sive variables in thermodynamics, which are referred to as proper variables by some
authors. In mechanics there are also preferred variables, which are called canonical.
However, as alternative selections of independent and dependent variables are
mathematically sound, and often useful, they cannot be excluded by such conventions.
As discussed in Section 12.6, a single component gas involves seven variables, energy
E, entropy S, volume V; temperature T; pressure P; number N of molecules, and
chemical potential, . Among these seven variables there hold four equations. In the
usual formulation E is a function of three independent variables S, V; and N , while
P; T; and  are partial derivatives of that function and so functions of the same three
independent variables:
E D f .S; V; N /;
T D @E
@S D f1.S; V; N /;
P D @E
@V D f2.S; V; N /;
 D @E
@N D f3.S; V; N /:
But it is just as reasonable (and sometimes preferable) to consider the independent
variables to be T; V; and N with the other four variables being dependent on these
three. In particular, we would have E D g.T; V; N / and similar representations would
hold for S, P; and . Confusion arises because f and g are sometimes casually
written as if they are the same function (e.g., E D E.S; V; N / or E D E.T; V; N /).
They normally are not the same function. As shown in Exercise 25 of Section 12.6, the
energy of an ideal gas can be written both as
E D f .S; V; N / D 3h2N

and
E D g.T; V; N / D 3
2N kT:
Clearly, f and g are different functions, in different variables, that nevertheless pro-
duce the same energy. Observe, also, that while g is allowed to depend on V it is
actually independent of V; while f is not. These functions may produce the same
value, but the differences in their partial derivatives cannot be overlooked. We have

Thus, it is necessary to specify what variables are independent in the notation for
the partial derivative, if it is not otherwise completely clear. The energy of an ideal
gas will not change with volume, provided the temperature and number of molecules
remain constant. On the other hand, energy will decrease as volume increases if the
entropy and number of molecules remain constant.

This is one of the general relationships between partial derivatives in thermodynamics
known as the Maxwell relations. Note that the subscripts S, V; and N in the two partial
derivatives involved tell us that we are regarding those three variables as the indepen-
dent variables on which the remaining variables T; P; E, and 	 depend. There are
three more Maxwell relations that can be derived in terms of the Legendre transfor-
mations of E (with N held ﬁxed) introduced in Section 12.6. These are presented in
Exercises 32–34 at the end of this section.

Jacobian Determinants
Partial derivatives obtained by implicit differentiation of systems of equations are frac-
tions, the numerators and denominators of which are conveniently expressed in terms
of certain determinants called Jacobians.
DEFINITION

The Jacobian determinant (or simply the Jacobian) of the two functions,
u D u.x; y/ and v D v.x; y/, with respect to two variables, x and y, is the

The deﬁnition above can be extended in the obvious way to give the Jacobian of n
functions (or variables) with respect to n variables. For example, the Jacobian of three
functions, F; G, and H, with respect to three variables, x, y, and z, is the determinant

Jacobians are the determinants of the square Jacobian matrices corresponding to trans-
formations of Rn to Rn as discussed brieﬂy in Section 12.6.
EXAMPLE 5
In terms of Jacobians, the value of .@x=@z/w, obtained from the
system of equations
F.x; y; z; w/ D 0;
G.x; y; z; w/ D 0
in Example 2 can be expressed in the form
@x

@.F; G/

Observe the pattern here. The denominator is the Jacobian of F and G with respect to
the two dependent variables, x and y. The numerator is the same Jacobian except that
the dependent variable x is replaced by the independent variable z.
The pattern observed above is general. We state it formally in the Implicit Function
Theorem below.
The Implicit Function Theorem
The Implicit Function Theorem guarantees that systems of equations can be solved for
certain variables as functions of other variables under certain circumstances, and it
provides formulas for the partial derivatives of the solution functions. Before stating
it, we consider a simple illustrative example.

Note in the above example that @u=@x ¤ 1=.@x=@u/. This should be con-
trasted with the single-variable situation where, if y D f .x/ and dy=dx ¤ 0, then
x D f 1.y/ and dx=dy D 1=.dy=dx/. This is another reason for distinguishing
between @ and d. It is the Jacobian rather than any single partial derivative that takes
the place of the ordinary derivative in such situations.
Remark
Let us look brieﬂy at the general case of invertible transformations from Rn
to Rn. Suppose that y D f.x/ and z D g.y/ are both functions from Rn to Rn whose
components have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives. As shown in Section 12.6, the

Taylor’s Formula, Taylor Series, and Approximations
As is the case for functions of one variable, power series representations and their
partial sums (Taylor polynomials) can provide an efﬁcient method for determining the
behaviour of a smooth function of several variables near a point in its domain. In this
section we will look brieﬂy at the extension of Taylor’s formula and Taylor series to
such functions. We will do this for functions of n variables as it is no more difﬁcult to
do this than to treat the special case n D 2.
As a starting point, recall Taylor’s formula for a function F.t/ with continuous
derivatives of order up to m C 1 on the interval Œ0; 1. (See Theorem 12 in Section
4.10, and put f D F; a D 0, x D h D 1, and s D  in the version of Taylor’s formula
given there.)

mŠ
C F .mC1/./
.m C 1/Š ;
where  is some number between 0 and 1. (The last term in the formula is the Lagrange
form of the remainder.)
Now suppose that a D .a1; a2; : : : ; an/ and h D .h1; h2; : : : ; hn/ belong to Rn. If
To simplify the manipulation of
many variables, irrespective of
how many there are, it is con-
venient to introduce the idea of a
function of a vector, which is an
intuitively straightforward
extension from functions of
scalars. If x has components
.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/, then f .x/ just
means f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/, a
function of n variables.
f is a function of x 2 Rn that has continuous partial derivatives of orders up to m C 1
in an open set containing the line segment joining a and a C h, we can apply the above
formula to

This is Taylor’s formula for f about x D a. Pm.h/ is a polynomial of degree m in
the components of h. Pm.h/ is called the mth degree Taylor polynomial of f about
x D a. The term corresponding to j in the summation deﬁning Pm is, if not zero,
a polynomial of degree exactly j in the components of h, whose coefﬁcients are j th
order partial derivatives of f evaluated at x D a. The remainder term Rm.h; / is
also a polynomial in the components of h, each of whose terms if not zero has degree
exactly mC1, but its coefﬁcients are .mC1/st order partial derivatives of f evaluated
at an indeterminate point a C h along the line segment between a and a C h.
Sometimes it is useful to replace the explicit remainder in Taylor’s formula with a
Big-O term that is bounded by a multiple of jhjmC1 as jhj ! 0. (See Section 4.10.)

An alternative approach is to develop Taylor’s formula with directional

distance, measured along a line L in direction u, from the point on L corresponding to
s D s0. As in Section 4.10, a Taylor formula for g.s/ is

Approximating Implicit Functions
In the previous section we saw how to determine whether an equation in several vari-
ables could be solved for one of those variables as a function of the others. Even when
such a solution is known to exist, it may not be possible to ﬁnd an exact formula for it.
However, if the equation involves only smooth functions, then the solution will have a
Taylor series. We can determine at least the ﬁrst several coefﬁcients in that series and
thus obtain a useful approximation to the solution. The following example shows the
technique.
EXAMPLE 4
Show that the equation sin.x C y/ D xy C 2x has a solution of
the form y D f .x/ near x D 0 satisfying f .0/ D 0, and ﬁnd the
terms up to fourth degree for the Taylor series for f .x/ in powers of x.
Solution
The given equation can be written in the form F.x; y/ D 0, where
F.x; y/ D sin.x C y/  xy  2x:
Since F.0; 0/ D 0 and F2.0; 0/ D cos.0/ D 1 ¤ 0, the equation has a solution
y D f .x/ near x D 0 satisfying f .0/ D 0 by the Implicit Function Theorem. It is not
possible to calculate f .x/ exactly, but it will have a Maclaurin series of the form
y D f .x/ D a1x C a2x2 C a3x3 C a4x4 C    :
(There is no constant term because f .0/ D 0.) We can substitute this series into
the given equation and keep track of terms up to degree 4 in order to calculate the
coefﬁcients a1, a2, a3, and a4. For the left side we use the Maclaurin series for sin to

ferentiation of the given equation and then determining the series coefﬁcients from
them. This would have been a much more difﬁcult way to do it. (Try it and see.)

Introduction
In this chapter we will discuss some of the ways partial
derivatives contribute to the understanding and solution
of problems in applied mathematics. Many such problems can be put in the context of
determining maximum or minimum values for functions of several variables, and the
ﬁrst four sections of this chapter deal with that subject. The remaining sections discuss
some miscellaneous problems involving the differentiation of functions with respect
to parameters, and also Newton’s Method for approximating solutions of systems of
nonlinear equations. Much of the material in this chapter may be considered optional.
Only Sections 13.1–13.3 contain core material, and even parts of those sections can be
omitted (e.g., the discussion of linear programming in Section 13.2).
13.1
Extreme Values
The function f .x; y/ D x2 C y2, part of whose graph is shown in Figure 13.1, has a
x
y
z
z D x2 C y2
Figure 13.1
x2 C y2 has minimum value
0 at the origin
minimum value of 0; this value occurs at the origin .0; 0/ where the graph has a hor-
izontal tangent plane. Similarly, the function g.x; y/ D 1  x2  y2, part of whose
graph appears in Figure 13.2, has a maximum value of 1 at .0; 0/. What techniques
could be used to discover these facts if they were not evident from a diagram? Finding
maximum and minimum values of functions of several variables is, like its single-
variable counterpart, the crux of many applications of advanced calculus to problems
that arise in other disciplines. Unfortunately, this problem is often much more com-
plicated than in the single-variable case. Our discussion will begin by developing the
techniques for functions of two variables. Some of the techniques extend to functions
of more variables in obvious ways. The extension of those that do not will be discussed
later in this section.
Let us begin by reviewing what we know about the single-variable case. Recall
that a function f .x/ has a local maximum value (or a local minimum value) at a point
a in its domain if f .x/  f .a/ (or f .x/  f .a/) for all x in the domain of f that
are sufﬁciently close to a. If the appropriate inequality holds for all x in the domain
of f; then we say that f has an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) value at a.
Moreover, such local or absolute extreme values can occur only at points of one of the
following three types:

(b) singular points, where f 0.x/ does not exist, or
(c) endpoints of the domain of f:
A similar situation exists for functions of several variables. We say that a function of
two variables has a local maximum or relative maximum value at the point .a; b/
in its domain if f .x; y/  f .a; b/ for all points .x; y/ in the domain of f that are
sufﬁciently close to the point .a; b/. If the inequality holds for all .x; y/ in the domain
of f; then we say that f has a global maximum or absolute maximum value at .a; b/.
Similar deﬁnitions hold for local (relative) and absolute (global) minimum values. In
practice, the word absolute or global is usually omitted, and we refer simply to the
maximum or the minimum value of f:
The following theorem shows that there are three possibilities for points where
extreme values can occur, analogous to those for the single-variable case.
T H E O R E M
1
Necessary conditions for extreme values
A function f .x; y/ can have a local or absolute extreme value at a point .a; b/ in its
domain only if .a; b/ is one of the following:
(a) a critical point of f; that is, a point satisfying rf .a; b/ D 0,
(b) a singular point of f; that is, a point where rf .a; b/ does not exist, or
(c) a boundary point of the domain of f:
PROOF
Suppose that .a; b/ belongs to the domain of f: If .a; b/ is not on the bound-
ary of the domain of f; then it must belong to the interior of that domain, and if .a; b/
is not a singular point of f; then rf .a; b/ exists. Finally, if .a; b/ is not a critical point
of f; then rf .a; b/ ¤ 0, so f has a positive directional derivative in the direction of
rf .a; b/ and a negative directional derivative in the direction of rf .a; b/; that is,
f is increasing as we move from .a; b/ in one direction and decreasing as we move in
the opposite direction. Hence, f cannot have either a maximum or a minimum value
at .a; b/. Therefore, any point where an extreme value occurs must be either a critical
point or a singular point of f; or a boundary point of the domain of f:
Note that Theorem 1 remains valid with unchanged proof for functions of any number
of variables. Of course, Theorem 1 does not guarantee that a given function will have
any extreme values. It only tells us where to look to ﬁnd any that may exist. Theorem 2,
below, provides conditions that guarantee the existence of absolute maximum and min-
imum values for a continuous function. It is analogous to the Max-Min Theorem for
functions of one variable. The proof is beyond the scope of this book; an interested
student should consult an elementary text on mathematical analysis.

of ﬁnite radius R. A set on the real line is bounded if it is contained in an interval of

Sufﬁcient conditions for extreme values
If f is a continuous function of n variables whose domain is a closed and bounded set
in Rn, then the range of f is a bounded set of real numbers, and there are points in its
domain where f takes on absolute maximum and minimum values.
EXAMPLE 1
The function f .x; y/ D x2 C y2 (see Figure 13.1) has a critical
point at .0; 0/, since rf D 2xi C 2yj and both components of

CHAPTER 13

rf vanish at .0; 0/. Since
f .x; y/ > 0 D f .0; 0/
if
.x; y/ ¤ .0; 0/;
f must have (absolute) minimum value 0 at that point. If the domain of f is not
restricted, f has no maximum value. Similarly, g.x; y/ D 1  x2  y2 has (absolute)
maximum value 1 at its critical point .0; 0/. (See Figure 13.2.)
EXAMPLE 2
The function h.x; y/ D y2  x2 also has a critical point at .0; 0/
but has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum value at that
point. Observe that h.0; 0/ D 0 but h.x; 0/ < 0 and h.0; y/ > 0 for all nonzero values
of x and y. (See Figure 13.3.) The graph of h is a hyperbolic paraboloid. In view of
the shape of this surface, we call the critical point .0; 0/ a saddle point of h.

y2  x2 has a saddle point at

In general, we will somewhat loosely call any interior critical point of the domain of a
function f of several variables a saddle point if f does not have a local maximum or
minimum value there. Even for functions of two variables, the graph will not always
look like a saddle near a saddle point. For instance, the function f .x; y/ D x3 has a
whole line of saddle points along the y-axis (see Figure 13.4), although its graph does
not resemble a saddle anywhere. These points resemble inﬂection points of a function
of one variable. Saddle points are higher-dimensional analogues of such horizontal
inﬂection points.
EXAMPLE 3
The function f .x; y/ D
p
x2 C y2 has no critical points but does
have a singular point at .0; 0/ where it has a local (and abso-
lute) minimum value, zero. The graph of f is (one nappe of) a circular cone. (See

EXAMPLE 4
The function f .x; y/ D 1  x is deﬁned everywhere in the
xy-plane and has no critical or singular points. (rf .x; y/ D i
at every point .x; y/.) Therefore, f has no extreme values. However, if we restrict
the domain of f to the points in the disk x2 C y2  1 (a closed bounded set in the
xy-plane), then f does have absolute maximum and minimum values, as it must by
Theorem 2. The maximum value is 2 at the boundary point .1; 0/ and the minimum
value is 0 at .1; 0/. (See Figure 13.5(b).)

Classifying Critical Points
The above examples were very simple ones; it was immediately obvious in each case
whether the function had a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point at the
critical or singular point. For more complicated functions, it may be harder to classify
the interior critical points. In theory, such a classiﬁcation can always be made by
considering the difference

for small values of h and k, where .a; b/ is the critical point in question. If the dif-
ference is always nonnegative (or nonpositive) for small h and k, then f must have a
local minimum (or maximum) at .a; b/; if the difference is negative for some points
.h; k/ arbitrarily near .0; 0/ and positive for others, then f must have a saddle point at
.a; b/.

Together, these equations imply that x2 D x so that x D 0 or x D 1. Therefore, the
critical points are .0; 0/ and .1; 1/.
Consider .0; 0/. Here f is given by
f D f .h; k/  f .0; 0/ D 2h3  6hk C 3k2:
Since f .h; 0/  f .0; 0/ D 2h3 is positive for small positive h and negative for small
negative h, f cannot have a maximum or minimum value at .0; 0/. Therefore, .0; 0/ is
a saddle point.
Now consider .1; 1/. Here f is given by
f D f .1 C h; 1 C k/  f .1; 1/
D 2.1 C h/3  6.1 C h/.1 C k/ C 3.1 C k/2  .1/

D 6h2  6hk C 3k2 C 2h3
D 3.h  k/2 C h2.3 C 2h/:
Both terms in the latter expression are nonnegative if jhj < 3=2, and they are not both
zero unless h D k D 0. Hence, f > 0 for small h and k, and f has a local minimum
value 1 at .1; 1/.
The method used to classify critical points in the above example takes on a “brute
force” aspect if the function involved is more complicated. However, there is a second
derivative test similar to that for functions of one variable. The n-variable version
is the subject of the following theorem, the proof of which is based on properties of
quadratic forms presented in Section 10.7.

If H .a/ is positive deﬁnite, then, by the continuity of H , so is H .a C h/ for jhj

Parts (b) and (c) are proved similarly. The functions f .x; y/ D x4Cy4, g.x; y/ D
x4  y4, and h.x; y/ D x4  y4 all fall under part (d) and show that in this case a
function can have a minimum, a maximum, or a saddle point.
Remark
As mentioned in Section 12.9, the second derivative term hT H .aCth/h is
a second directional derivative. It can be thought of as a simple second derivative with
respect to a single variable along a line L through a lying in the domain of f in the
direction given by h. This direction is not necessarily parallel to the given coordinate
axes. Viewed as a simple second derivative, Theorem 9 from Section 4.5 tells us that
the sign of this term determines the concavity of the curve in which the vertical plane
containing L intersects the graph of f: This concavity makes sense even if a is not a
critical point of f; and can vary as the direction of h changes. Therefore the Hessian
can tell us about the concavity of the entire surface.

Remark
Applying the test (given in Theorem 8 of Section 10.7) for positive or nega-
tive deﬁniteness or indeﬁniteness of a real symmetric matrix to the Hessian matrix for
a function of two variables, we can paraphrase the second derivative test Theorem 3
for such a function:
Suppose that .a; b/ is a critical point of the function f .x; y/ that is interior to the
domain of f . Suppose also that the second partial derivatives of f are continuous in
a neighbourhood of .a; b/ and have at that point the values
A D f11.a; b/;
B D f12.a; b/ D f21.a; b/;
and
C D f22.a; b/:
(a) If B2  AC < 0 and A > 0, then f has a local minimum value at .a; b/.
(b) If B2  AC < 0 and A < 0, then f has a local maximum value at .a; b/.
(c) If B2  AC > 0, then f has a saddle point at .a; b/.
(d) If B2  AC D 0, this test provides no information; f may have a local maximum
or a local minimum value or a saddle point at .a; b/.

At any critical point f1 D 0 and f2 D 0, so the critical points are the solutions of the
system of equations
y.1  x2/ D 0
.A/
x.1  y2/ D 0:
.B/
Equation (A) says that y D 0 or x D ˙1. If y D 0, then equation (B) says that
x D 0. If either x D 1 or x D 1, then equation (B) forces y D ˙1. Thus, there are
ﬁve points satisfying both equations: .0; 0/, .1; 1/, .1; 1/, .1; 1/, and .1; 1/. We
classify them using the second derivative test.
At .0; 0/ we have A D C D 0, B D 1, so that B2  AC D 1 > 0. Thus, f has a
saddle point at .0; 0/.
At .1; 1/ and .1; 1/ we have A D C D 2=e < 0, B D 0. It follows that
B2  AC D 4=e2 < 0. Thus, f has local maximum values at these points. The
value of f is 1=e at each point.
At .1; 1/ and .1; 1/ we have A D C D 2=e > 0, B D 0. If follows that
B2  AC D 4=e2 < 0. Thus, f has local minimum values at these points. The
value of f at each of them is 1=e.
Indeed, f has absolute maximum and minimum values, namely, the values ob-
tained above as local extrema. To see why, observe that f .x; y/ approaches 0 as the
point .x; y/ recedes to inﬁnity in any direction because the negative exponential dom-
inates the power factor xy for large x2 C y2. Pick a number between 0 and the local
maximum value 1=e found above, say, the number 1=.2e/. For some R, we must have
jf .x; y/j  1=.2e/ whenever x2 C y2  R2. On the closed disk x2 C y2  R2, f
must have absolute maximum and minimum values by Theorem 2. These cannot occur
on the boundary circle x2 C y2 D R2 because jf j is smaller there ( 1=.2e/) than it
is at the critical points considered above. Since f has no singular points, the absolute
maximum and minimum values for the disk, and therefore for the whole plane, must
occur at those critical points.
EXAMPLE 9
Find the shape of a rectangular box with no top having given vol-
ume V and the least possible total surface area of its ﬁve faces.
Solution
If the horizontal dimensions of the box are x, y, and its height is z (see
Figure 13.6), then we want to minimize
x

to reduce the number of variables on which S depends, for instance, by substituting

SECTION 13.1:

759
Then S becomes a function of the two variables x and y:
S D S.x; y/ D xy C 2V
x C 2V
y :
A real box has positive dimensions, so the domain of S should consist of only those
points .x; y/ that satisfy x > 0 and y > 0. If either x or y approaches 0 or 1, then
S ! 1, so the minimum value of S must occur at a critical point. (S has no singular
points.) For critical points we solve the equations

@x D y  2V

”
x2y D 2V;
0 D @S
@y D x  2V
y2
”
xy2 D 2V:
Thus, x2y  xy2 D 0, or xy.x  y/ D 0. Since x > 0 and y > 0, this implies that
x D y. Therefore, x3 D 2V , x D y D .2V /1=3, and z D V=.xy/ D 22=3V 1=3 D
x=2. Since there is only one critical point, it must minimize S. (Why?) The box
having minimal surface area has a square base but is only half as high as its horizontal
dimensions.
Remark
The preceding problem is a constrained extreme-value problem in three
variables; the equation xyz D V is a constraint limiting the freedom of x, y, and z.
We used the constraint to eliminate one variable, z, and so to reduce the problem to a
free (i.e., unconstrained) problem in two variables. In Section 13.3 we will develop a
more powerful method for solving constrained extreme-value problems.

Extreme Values of Functions Deﬁned on Restricted Domains
Much of the previous section was concerned with techniques for determining whether
a critical point of a function provides a local maximum or minimum value or is a
saddle point. In this section we address the problem of determining absolute maximum
and minimum values for functions that have them—usually functions whose domains
are restricted to subsets of R2 (or Rn) having nonempty interiors. In Example 8 of
How to ﬁnd extreme values of a
continuous function f on a
closed, bounded domain D
1. Find any critical or singular
points of f in the interior of
D.
2. Find any points on the
boundary of D where f
might have extreme values.
To do this you can
parametrize the whole
boundary, or parts of it, and
express f as a function of
the parameter(s). If you
break the boundary into
pieces, you must consider
the endpoints of those
pieces. Section 13.3 will
present another alternative
for analyzing f on the
boundary of D.
3. Evaluate f at all the points
found in steps 1 and 2.
Section 13.1 we had to prove that the given function had absolute extreme values. If,
however, we are dealing with a continuous function on a domain that is closed and
bounded, then we can rely on Theorem 2 to guarantee the existence of such extreme
values, but we will always have to check boundary points as well as any interior critical
or singular points to ﬁnd them. The following examples illustrate the technique.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the maximum and minimum values of f .x; y/ D 2xy on the
closed disk x2 C y2  4. (See Figure 13.7.)
Solution
Since f is continuous and the disk is closed, f must have absolute maxi-
mum and minimum values at some points of the disk. The ﬁrst partial derivatives of
f are
f1.x; y/ D 2y
and
f2.x; y/ D 2x;
so there are no singular points, and the only critical point is .0; 0/, where f has the
value 0.
We must still consider values of f on the boundary circle x2 C y2 D 4. We
can express f as a function of a single variable on this circle by using a convenient
parametrization of the circle, say,
x D 2 cos t;
y D 2 sin t;

We must ﬁnd any extreme values of g.t/. We can do this in either of two ways. If we
rewrite g.t/ D 4 sin 2t, it is clear that g.t/ has maximum value 4 (at t D

and minimum value 4 (at t D

which again yield the maximum value 4 and the minimum value 4. (It is not neces-
sary to check the endpoints t D  and t D ; since g is everywhere differentiable
and is periodic with period , any absolute maximum or minimum will occur at a
critical point.)

straight line segments. On two of these, the coordinate axes, f is identically zero. The

We conclude that the maximum value of f over the region T is 4=e3 and that it occurs
at the interior critical point .2; 1/. The minimum value of f is zero and occurs at all
points of the two perpendicular boundary segments. Note that f has neither a local
maximum nor a local minimum at the boundary point .8=3; 4=3/, although g has a
local maximum there. Of course, that point is not a saddle point of f either; it is not a
critical point of f:

Among all triangles with vertices on a given circle, ﬁnd those that

CHAPTER 13
Applications of Partial Derivatives
Solution
Intuition tells us that the equilateral triangles must have the largest area.
However, proving this can be quite difﬁcult unless a good choice of variables in which
to set up the problem analytically is made. With a suitable choice of units and axes
we can assume the circle is x2 C y2 D 1 and that one vertex of the triangle is the
point P with coordinates .1; 0/. Let the other two vertices, Q and R, be as shown in
Figure 13.9. There is no harm in assuming that Q lies on the upper semicircle and R on
the lower, and that the origin O is inside triangle PQR. Let PQ and PR make angles
 and , respectively, with the negative direction of the x-axis. Clearly 0    =2
and 0    =2. The lines from O to Q and R make equal angles  with the line
QR, where 2 C 2 C 2 D . Dropping perpendiculars from O to the three sides
of the triangle PQR, we can write the area A of the triangle as the sum of the areas of
six small, right-angled triangles:

this interior critical point maximizes the area of the inscribed triangle. Finally, observe
that for  D  D =6, we also have  D =6, so the largest triangle is indeed
equilateral.
Remark
Since the area A of the inscribed triangle must have a maximum value (A is
continuous and its domain is closed and bounded), a strictly geometric argument can
be used to show that the largest triangle is equilateral. If an inscribed triangle has two
unequal sides, its area can be made larger by moving the common vertex of these two
sides along the circle to increase its perpendicular distance from the opposite side of
the triangle.
E
Linear Programming
Linear programming is a branch of linear algebra that develops systematic techniques
for ﬁnding maximum or minimum values of a linear function subject to several lin-
ear inequality constraints. Such problems arise frequently in management science
and operations research. Because of their linear nature they do not usually involve
calculus in their solution; linear programming is frequently presented in courses on
ﬁnite mathematics. We will not attempt any formal study of linear programming here,
but we will make a few observations for comparison with the more general nonlinear
extreme-value problems considered above that involve calculus in their solution.
The inequality ax C by  c is an example of a linear inequality in two variables.
The solution set of this inequality consists of a half-plane lying on one side of the
straight line ax C by D c. The solution set of a system of several two-variable linear
inequalities is an intersection of such half-planes, so it is a convex region of the plane
bounded by a polygonal line. If it is a bounded set, then it is a convex polygon together
with its interior. (A set is called convex if it contains the entire line segment between
any two of its points. On the real line the convex sets are intervals.)
Let us examine a simple concrete example that involves only two variables and a
few constraints.

Solution
The solution set S of the system of four constraint inequalities is shown in
Figure 13.11. It is the quadrilateral region with vertices .0; 0/, .3; 0/, .2; 2/, and .0; 3/.
Several level curves of the linear function F are also shown in the ﬁgure. They are
parallel straight lines with slope  2
7. We want the line that gives F the greatest value
and that still intersects S. Evidently this is the line F D 21 that passes through the
vertex .0; 3/ of S. The maximum value of F subject to the constraints is 21.

As this simple example illustrates, a linear function with domain restricted by linear
inequalities does not achieve maximum or minimum values at points in the interior
of its domain (if that domain has an interior). Any such extreme value occurs at a
boundary point of the domain or a set of such boundary points. Where an extreme value
occurs at a set of boundary points, that set will always contain at least one vertex. This
phenomenon holds in general for extreme-value problems for linear functions in any
number of variables with domains restricted by any number of linear inequalities. For
problems involving three variables the domain will be a convex region of R3 bounded
by planes. For a problem involving n variables the domain will be a convex region
in Rn bounded by .n  1/-dimensional hyperplanes. Such polyhedral regions still
have vertices (where n hyperplanes intersect), and maximum or minimum values of
linear functions subject to the constraints will still occur at subsets of the boundary
containing such vertices. These problems can therefore be solved by evaluating the
linear function to be extremized (it is called the objective function) at all the vertices
and selecting the greatest or least value.
In practice, linear programming problems can involve hundreds or even thousands
of variables and even more constraints. Such problems need to be solved with com-
puters, but even then it is extremely inefﬁcient, if not impossible, to calculate all the
vertices of the constraint solution set and the values of the objective function at them.
Much of the study of linear programming therefore centres on devising techniques for
getting to (or at least near) the optimizing vertex in as few steps as possible. Usually,
this involves criteria whereby large numbers of vertices can be rejected on geometric
grounds. We will not delve into such techniques here but will content ourselves with
one more example to illustrate, in a very simple case, how the underlying geometry of
a problem can be used to reduce the number of vertices that must be considered.
EXAMPLE 5
A tailor has 230 m of a certain fabric and has orders for up to 20
suits, up to 30 jackets, and up to 40 pairs of slacks to be made from
the fabric. Each suit requires 6 m, each jacket 3 m, and each pair of slacks 2 m of the
fabric. If the tailor’s proﬁt is $20 per suit, $14 per jacket, and $12 per pair of slacks,
how many of each should he make to realize the maximum proﬁt from his supply of
the fabric?

SECTION 13.2:
Extreme Values of Functions Deﬁned on Restricted Domains
765
Solution
Suppose he makes x suits, y jackets, and z pairs of slacks. Then his proﬁt
will be
P D 20x C 14y C 12z:
The constraints posed in the problem are
x  0;
y  0;
z  0;
x  20;
y  30;
z  40;
6x C 3y C 2z  230:
The last inequality is due to the limited supply of fabric. The solution set is shown in
Figure 13.12. It has 10 vertices, A; B; : : : ; J: Since P increases in the direction of the
vector rP D 20i C 14j C 12k, which points into the ﬁrst octant, its maximum value
cannot occur at any of the vertices A; B; : : : ; G. (Think about why.) Thus, we need
look only at the vertices H, I; and J .
H D .20; 10; 40/;
P D 1;020 at H:
I D .10; 30; 40/;
P D 1;100 at I:
J D .20; 30; 10/;
P D 940 at J:
Thus, the tailor should make 10 suits, 30 jackets, and 40 pairs of slacks to realize the
maximum proﬁt, $1,100, from the fabric.

13.3
Lagrange Multipliers
A constrained extreme-value problem is one in which the variables of the function to
be maximized or minimized are not completely independent of one another, but must
satisfy one or more constraint equations or inequalities. For instance, the problems
maximize
f .x; y/
subject to
g.x; y/ D C
and
minimize
f .x; y; z; w/
subject to
g.x; y; z; w/ D C1;
and
h.x; y; z; w/ D C2
have, respectively, one and two constraint equations, while the problem
maximize
f .x; y; z/
subject to
g.x; y; z/  C
has a single constraint inequality.
Generally, inequality constraints can be regarded as restricting the domain of the
function to be extremized to a smaller set that still has interior points. Section 13.2 was
devoted to such problems. In each of the ﬁrst three examples of that section we looked
for free (i.e., unconstrained) extreme values in the interior of the domain, and we also
examined the boundary of the domain, which was speciﬁed by one or more constraint
equations. In Example 1 we parametrized the boundary and expressed the function
to be extremized as a function of the parameter, thus reducing the boundary case to
a free problem in one variable instead of a constrained problem in two variables. In
Example 2 the boundary consisted of three line segments, on two of which the function
was obviously zero. We solved the equation for the third boundary segment for y
in terms of x, again in order to express the values of f .x; y/ on that segment as a
function of one free variable. A similar approach was used in Example 3 to deal with
the triangular boundary of the domain of the area function A.; 
/.
The reduction of extremization problems with equation constraints to free prob-
lems with fewer independent variables is only feasible when the constraint equations
can be solved either explicitly for some variables in terms of others or parametrically
for all variables in terms of some parameters. It is often very difﬁcult or impossible to
solve the constraint equations, so we need another technique.
The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
A technique for ﬁnding extreme values of f .x; y/ subject to the equality constraint
g.x; y/ D 0 is based on the following theorem:

SECTION 13.3:

Suppose that f
and g have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives near the point
P0 D .x0; y0/ on the curve C with equation g.x; y/ D 0. Suppose also that, when
restricted to points on C, the function f .x; y/ has a local maximum or minimum value
at P0. Finally, suppose that
(i) P0 is not an endpoint of C, and
(ii) rg.P0/ ¤ 0.
Then there exists a number 0 such that .x0; y0; 0/ is a critical point of the
Lagrange function
L.x; y; / D f .x; y/ C g.x; y/:
PROOF
Together, (i) and (ii) imply that C is smooth enough to have a tangent line at
P0 and that rg.P0/ is normal to that tangent line. If rf .P0/ is not parallel to rg.P0/,
then rf .P0/ has a nonzero vector projection v along the tangent line to C at P0. (See
Figure 13.13.) Therefore, f has a positive directional derivative at P0 in the direction
of v and a negative directional derivative in the opposite direction. Thus, f .x; y/
increases or decreases as we move away from P0 along C in the direction of v or v,
and f cannot have a maximum or minimum value at P0. Since we are assuming that f
does have an extreme value at P0, it must be that rf .P0/ is parallel to rg.P0/. Since
rg.P0/ ¤ 0, there must exist a real number 0 such that rf .P0/ D 0rg.P0/, or
r.f C 0g/.P0/ D 0:
The two components of the above vector equation assert that @L=@x D 0 and @L=@y D
0 at .x0; y0; 0/. The third equation that must be satisﬁed by a critical point of L is
@L=@ D g.x; y/ D 0. This is satisﬁed at .x0; y0; 0/ because P0 lies on C. Thus,
.x0; y0; 0/ is a critical point of L.x; y; /.

Theorem 4 suggests that to ﬁnd candidates for points on the curve g.x; y/ D 0 at which
f .x; y/ is maximum or minimum, we should look for critical points of the Lagrange
function

Note that it is assumed that the constrained problem does, in fact, have a solution.
Theorem 4 does not guarantee that a solution exists; it only provides a means for ﬁnd-
ing a solution already known to exist. It is usually necessary to satisfy yourself that
the problem you are trying to solve has a solution before using this method to ﬁnd the
solution.
Let us put the method to a concrete test:
EXAMPLE 1
Find the shortest distance from the origin to the curve x2y D 16.

CHAPTER 13
Applications of Partial Derivatives
Solution
The graph of x2y D 16 is shown in Figure 13.14. There appear to be two
points on the curve that are closest to the origin and no points that are farthest from the
origin. (The curve is unbounded.) To ﬁnd the closest points it is sufﬁcient to minimize
the square of the distance from the point .x; y/ on the curve to the origin. (It is easier
to work with the square of the distance rather than the distance itself, which involves a
square root and so is harder to differentiate.) Thus, we want to solve the problem
minimize
f .x; y/ D x2 C y2
subject to
g.x; y/ D x2y  16 D 0:

The number  that occurs in the Lagrange function is called a Lagrange multi-
plier. The technique for solving an extreme-value problem with equation constraints
by looking for critical points of an unconstrained problem in more variables (the orig-
inal variables plus a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to each constraint equation)
is called the method of Lagrange multipliers. It can be expected to give results as
long as the function to be maximized or minimized (called the objective function or
cost function) and the constraint equations have smooth graphs in a neighbourhood of
the points where the extreme values occur, and these points are not on edges of those
graphs. See Example 3 and Exercise 26 below.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the points on the curve 17x2 C 12xy C 8y2 D 100 that are
closest to and farthest away from the origin.
Solution
The quadratic form on the left side of the equation above is positive deﬁnite,
as can be seen by completing a square. Hence, the curve is bounded and must have
points closest to and farthest from the origin. (In fact, the curve is an ellipse with
centre at the origin and oblique principal axes. The problem asks us to ﬁnd the ends of
the major and minor axes.)

(D)
We multiply equation (D) by 4 and add the result to equation (C) to get 25x2 D 100,
so that x D ˙2. Finally, we substitute each of these values of x into (D) and obtain
(for each) two values of y from the resulting quadratics:

origin
ﬁrst two points are closest to the origin (they are the ends of the minor axis of the

Figure 13.15.)
Considering the geometric underpinnings of the method of Lagrange multipliers, we
would not expect the method to work if the level curves of the functions involved are
not smooth or if the maximum or minimum occurs at an endpoint of the constraint
curve. One of the pitfalls of the method is that the level curves of functions may not be
smooth, even though the functions themselves have partial derivatives. Problems can
occur where a gradient vanishes, as the following example shows.
EXAMPLE 3
Find the minimum value of f .x; y/ D y subject to the constraint
equation g.x; y/ D y3  x2 D 0.
Solution
The curve y3 D x2, called a semicubical parabola, has a cusp at the origin.
(See Figure 13.16.) Clearly, f .x; y/ D y has minimum value 0 at that point. Suppose,
however, that we try to solve the problem using the method of Lagrange multipliers.
The Lagrange function here is
L.x; y; / D y C .y3  x2/;
which has critical points given by
2x D 0;
1 C 3y2 D 0;
y3  x2 D 0:
Observe that y D 0 cannot satisfy the second equation, and, in fact, the three equations

The minimum of y occurs
at a point on the curve where the curve has

neither of these is consistent with the other two equations.)

770
CHAPTER 13
Applications of Partial Derivatives
Remark
The method of Lagrange multipliers breaks down in the above example
because rg D 0 at the solution point, and therefore the curve g.x; y/ D 0 need not be
smooth there. (In this case, it isn’t smooth!) The geometric condition that rf should
be parallel to rg at the solution point is meaningless in this case. When applying the
method of Lagrange multipliers, be aware that an extreme value may occur at
(i) a critical point of the Lagrange function,
(ii) a point where rg D 0,
(iii) a point where rf or rg does not exist, or
(iv) an “endpoint” of the constraint set.
This situation is similar to that for extreme values of a function f of one variable,
which can occur at a critical point of f , a singular point of f , or an endpoint of the
domain of f:
EXAMPLE 4
Find the maximum and minimum values of f .x; y; z/ D xy2z3
on the ball x2 C y2 C z2  1.
Solution
Since f1.x; y; z/ D y2z3 D 0 only if either y D 0 or z D 0, there can be
no critical points of f where f .x; y; z/ ¤ 0. Evidently .x; y; z/ is positive at some
points in the ball, and negative at others, so no interior critical points can provide a
maximum or minimum value for f on the ball. Therefore, these extreme values must

Problems with More than One Constraint
Next, consider a three-dimensional problem requiring us to ﬁnd a maximum or mini-
mum value of a function of three variables subject to two equation constraints:
extremize
f .x; y; z/
subject to
g.x; y; z/ D 0 and h.x; y; z/ D 0:
Again, we assume that the problem has a solution, say, at the point P0 D .x0; y0; z0/,
and that the functions f; g, and h have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives near P0.
Also, we assume that T D rg.P0/  rh.P0/ ¤ 0. These conditions imply that the
surfaces g.x; y; z/ D 0 and h.x; y; z/ D 0 are smooth near P0 and are not tangent
to each other there, so they must intersect in a curve C that is smooth near P0. The
curve C has tangent vector T at P0. The same geometric argument used in the proof
of Theorem 4 again shows that rf .P0/ must be perpendicular to T. (If not, then it
would have a nonzero vector projection along T, and f would have nonzero direc-
tional derivatives in the directions ˙T and would therefore increase and decrease as
we moved away from P0 along C in opposite directions.)
Since rg.P0/ and rh.P0/ are nonzero and both are perpendicular to T (see
Figure 13.17), rf .P0/ must lie in the plane spanned by these two vectors and hence
must be a linear combination of them:
rf .x0; y0; z0/ D 0rg.x0; y0; z0/  0rh.x0; y0; z0/
for some constants 0 and 0. It follows that .x0; y0; z0; 0; 0/ is a critical point of

Applications of Partial Derivatives
Solving such a system can be very difﬁcult. It should be noted that, in using the method
of Lagrange multipliers instead of solving the constraint equations, we have traded the
problem of having to solve two equations for two variables as functions of a third one
for a problem of having to solve ﬁve equations for numerical values of ﬁve unknowns.
EXAMPLE 5
Find the maximum and minimum values of f .x; y; z/ D xy C 2z
on the circle that is the intersection of the plane x C y C z D 0
and the sphere x2 C y2 C z2 D 24.
Solution
The function f is continuous, and the circle is a closed bounded set in
3-space. Therefore, maximum and minimum values must exist. We look for critical
points of the Lagrange function
L D xy C 2z C .x C y C z/ C .x2 C y2 C z2  24/:
Setting the ﬁrst partial derivatives of L equal to zero, we obtain

CASE I
If  D 1

x C  C y D 0
and
2 C  C z D 0:
Thus, x C y D 2 C z. Combining this with (D), we get z D 1 and x C y D 1.
Now, by (E), x2 C y2 D 24  z2 D 23. Since x2 C y2 C 2xy D .x C y/2 D 1,
we have 2xy D 1  23 D 22 and xy D 11. Now .x  y/2 D x2 C y2  2xy D

CASE II
If x D y, then (D) implies that z D 2x, and (E) then gives 6x2 D 24, so
x D ˙2. Therefore, points .2; 2; 4/ and .2; 2; 4/ must be considered. We have
f .2; 2; 4/ D 4  8 D 4 and f .2; 2; 4/ D 4 C 8 D 12.
We conclude that the maximum value of f on the circle is 12, and the minimum
value is 13.

Lagrange Multipliers in n-Space
In this section we will show how the method of Lagrange multipliers extends to the
problem of ﬁnding local extreme values of a function f of n real variables, that is, of
a vector variable x D .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/,
f .x/ D f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/;
subject to m  n  1 constraints
Here the indices on g denote
different functions, not partial
derivatives.
g1.x/ D 0;
g2.x/ D 0;
: : : ;
gm.x/ D 0;
where 1  m  n  1.
In what follows we will assume that f and each of the functions gi, .1  i  m/,
is smooth in the sense that its partial derivatives of orders up to 3 are all continuous.
We also assume that for each i, the gradient rgi ¤ 0 at any point x where gi.x/ D 0.
This means that for each i, the set of points x in Rn satisfying gi.x/ D 0 is a smooth
hypersurface of dimension n  1 (called an .n  1/-dimensional manifold).
In R2 a manifold of dimension 1
is just a curve. In R3 a manifold
of dimension 1 is a curve; a
manifold of dimension 2 is a
surface. We are introducing the
term manifold here to avoid
having to use different terms to
distinguish between curves,
surfaces, and smooth subsets of
dimension up to n  1 in an
n-dimensional space Rn.
The intersection M of all m of these manifolds (i.e., the set of points satisfying all
m constraint equations) will be a surface in Rn called the constraint manifold for the
extremization problem. M will have dimension n  m provided that the set of normal
vectors rgi.x/, .1  i  m/, is linearly independent at each point x on M; that is, if
an equation of the form
c1rg1.a/ C c2rg2.a/ C    C cmrgm.a/ D 0
holds, then every coefﬁcient ci D 0 for 1  i  m. The subspace of Rn spanned by
the m gradient vectors rgi.a/, .1  i  m/, is the m-dimensional space N normal to
M at a. In particular, if m D 1, then M has dimension n  1 and the normal space N
has dimension 1. If m D n  1, then M has dimension 1 (and so is a curve in Rn) and
the normal space N is an .n  1/-dimensional hyperplane perpendicular to that curve
at the point a. The tangent space T to M at a is the subspace of Rn consisting of all
The concept of a tangent space T
is simply the extension to higher
dimensions of the tangent line in
Section 2.1 and the tangent plane
in Section 12.3. Similarly, the
normal space N extends the
concept of normal line or normal
plane.
vectors perpendicular to the normal space N . Equivalently, T consists of all points on
lines through a that are tangent to M at a. Like M, its tangent space T has dimension
n  m. For example, in R3, the normal space to a surface (two-dimensional manifold)
at a point is just the normal line to the surface at that point. The tangent space is the
plane perpendicular to the normal line at that point. Similarly, the normal space to a
curve (one-dimensional manifold) at a point is the plane normal to the curve at that
point and the tangent space is the tangent line to the curve there. (See Section 17.3 for
more discussion of these ideas.)
Under the conditions described above, we will show that if f; when restricted to
points on the constraint manifold M, has a local extreme value at point a, then a must
be a critical point of the Lagrange function

.n  m/-dimensional space T tangent to M at a to provide a second derivative test for
classifying the critical point a. This test is presented in the following theorem. It is
analagous to the test for unconstrained extrema given in Theorem 3 in Section 13.1.1

If rf .a/ does not lie in the normal space N to M at a, then it will

pi D C exp.Ei/ for 1  i  n, where the constants C and  can be found by
substituting these values into the two constraint equations and solving. There is just
the one critical point. Observe that

and so the (unconstrained) Hessian matrix H has its only nonzero elements on the
main diagonal, and these are all negative at the critical point. Accordingly, H is neg-
ative deﬁnite (by either of Theorems 7 and 8 of Section 10.7), and we don’t need to
worry about restricting H to the (tangent space to) the constraint manifold. The criti-
cal point gives S a local maximum value. Since, limpi!0C pi ln pi D 0 and there are
no other critical points, the local maximum must, in fact, be an absolute maximum.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the minimum distance between the circle x2 C y2 D 2 and
the line x C y D 4.
Solution
We really don’t need to use such fancy theory to solve this problem. It is
geometrically evident in Figure 13.18 that the two closest points are B D .1; 1/ on
the circle and A D .2; 2/ on the line. We shall, however, treat it as a problem of
minimizing (the square of) the distance between two arbitrary points, .x1; y1/ on the
circle and .x2; y2/ on the line:

In order to calculate the restrictions of these Hessians to the space tangent to the con-

The eigenvalues of these 2  2 matrices are easily calculated. (See Section 10.7.) For

Theorem 7 of Section 10.7, and S has a local minimum value at P: It is also the
absolute minimum, as observed in Figure 13.18. The minimum distance is the distance
from A D .2; 2/ to B D .1; 1/, that is,
p
2 units.
For H .Q/T the eigenvalues are 1˙
p
13, which have opposite signs. Therefore,
H .Q/T is indeﬁnite and S has neither a local minimum nor a local maximum at Q.
At ﬁrst this may seem strange; it may appear that S should have a local maximum at
Q; if point C in the ﬁgure moves along the circle away from .1; 1/, its distance
from A D .2; 2/ is decreasing. However, if A moves along the line away from .2; 2/,
its distance from C D .1; 1/ is increasing. Thus, Q really is a saddle point of the
constrained problem. Of course, there is no absolute maximum distance since the line
is unbounded.
Using Maple to Solve Constrained Extremal Problems
As the previous example indicates, the classiﬁcation of critical points for constrained
problems can be quite computationally intensive. Our next example will show how to
make use of Maple to relieve some of the burden.

Solution
We begin by loading two Maple packages deﬁning routines useful in what
follows
>
with(LinearAlgebra): with(VectorCalculus):
The colons suppress output from these with commands. We will not reproduce here
the results of the next few commands either, as their output just restates the input. First
we deﬁne expressions for F and G and the Lagrange function L. We do not need these
to be Maple functions, so we just set them up as expressions.
>
F := x^3 + y^3 + z^3;
>
G := (1/x) + (1/y) + (1/z);
>
L := F + lambda*(G - 1);
Newer versions of Maple will use the symbol 	 in place of lambda in the output.
Some of the commands used below require us to list the variables to which the com-
mand should be applied. We require two sets of variables, the space variables x; y; z,
and all variables, which includes the 	 as well.
>
spvars := [x, y, z]; allvars := [x, y, z, lambda];
Now we can get down to business. We calculate the gradient of L with respect to
all four variables. The list allvars is required by the Gradient command in the
VectorCalculus package.

a set of four equations obtained by setting the four components of GrL equal to zero.
We construct the list of these equations as follows.

We now attempt to solve these equations for all four variables using Maple’s solve
command.
>
solns := solve(eqns,allvars);
This command produces several lines of output, not all of which we reproduce here.
The output consists of a list of eight lists, each of which provides one solution for the
four variables. Only four of those solutions consist entirely of real numbers (in fact, in-
tegers). The other four involve expressions like RootOf(_Z^2+1) and RootOf(5-
2_Z+_Z^2), both of which represent complex numbers and are of no use to us. The
four real critical points of L are

Œx D 1; y D 1; z D 1;  D 3;

that is, the points P D .3; 3; 3; 343/, Q D .1; 1; 1; 3/, R D .1; 1; 1; 3/, and
S D .1; 1; 1; 3/. When we did this calculation, the four real solutions were the
ﬁrst, second, fourth, and ﬁfth ones in the solns list. Thus, P was solns[1] and Q
was solns[2]. Now we need to classify these four points. By the symmetry of F
and G in the spatial variables x, y, and z, the points Q, R and S will be of the same
type, so we need only look at P and Q. The VectorCalculus package has a function
for calculating Hessian matrices.

Both matrices are diagonal, so the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. HP is pos-
itive deﬁnite, so the constrained problem must have a local minimum at P: However,
HQ is indeﬁnite so we have to consider the restriction of HQ to the tangent plane T
to the constraint manifold at Q to determine the nature of Q. A vector normal to T is
given by

NQ := subs([x=1,y=1,z=-1],Gradient(G,spvars));

We need two linearly independent vectors each normal to NQ. Evidently, two such

This matrix is diagonal and clearly indeﬁnite, so we conclude that F; when restricted
to the constraint manifold, has saddle behaviour rather than a local maximum or mini-
mum at Q, and by symmetry also at R and S.
Remark
There are two places in the above use of Maple where difﬁculties can arise
for other constrained problems. First, depending on the functions involved, Maple’s
solve routine may not be able to solve the system of equations for a critical point of
the Lagrange function. If so, you should try the ﬂoating point fsolve routine, but
this may only give one solution even if there are many. Second, if F is a function of
n variables, and is subject to m  n constraints, the tangent to the constraint manifold
will have dimension n  m and you will need to ﬁrst ﬁnd m  n linearly independent
vectors, each normal to the m gradients of the constraint functions, in order to apply
the GramSchmidt routine to generate an orthonormal basis for T . This can usually
be done by solving an underdetermined system of m linear equations in n unknowns.
Signiﬁcance of Lagrange Multiplier Values
It would seem that the actual value of a Lagrange multiplier is of little signiﬁcance for
the process of solving constrained extreme-value problems. However, it is signiﬁcant
if we want to determine the sensitivity of the extreme value to changes in the value of
a parameter on which a constraint function depends.
Consider, for example, the problem of extremizing f .x; y/ subject to the con-
straint g.x; y; p/ D 0. Here p is a parameter in the constraint equation that is beyond
our control and so does not enter into the process of ﬁnding the extreme value of f:
If f has an extreme value at .a; b/, then for some , .a; b; / is a critical point of the
Lagrange function
L D f .x; y/ C g.x; y; p/

782
CHAPTER 13

and so a, b, and  are determined by the three equations
f1.a; b/ D g1.a; b; p/
f2.a; b/ D g2.a; b; p/
g.a; b; p/ D 0:
The solution of these equations for a, b, and  results in all three being functions of p.
How does the extreme value f .a; b/ change if p changes? Observe that

But, since g.a; b; p/ D 0, we have

dp C g2.a; b/db
dp C g3.a; b; p/:
Thus,
d

The extreme value of f changes at a rate  times the rate of change of the function g
with respect to the parameter p at the point where the extreme value occurs.
E
Nonlinear Programming
When we looked for extreme values of functions f on restricted domains R in Section
13.2, we had to look separately for critical points of f in the interior of R and then
for critical points of the restriction of f to the boundary of R. The interior of R is
typically speciﬁed by one or more inequality constraints of the form g < 0, while the
boundary corresponds to equation constraints of the form g D 0 (for which Lagrange
multipliers can be used).
It is possible to unify these approaches into a single method for ﬁnding extreme
values of functions deﬁned on regions speciﬁed by inequalities of the form g  0.
Consider, for example, the problem of ﬁnding extreme values of f .x; y/ over the
region R speciﬁed by g.x; y/  0. We can proceed by trying to ﬁnd critical points of
the four-variable function
L.x; y; ; u/ D f .x; y/ C 

g.x; y/ C u2

Suppose that .x; y; ; u/ satisﬁes these equations. We consider two cases:
CASE I
u ¤ 0. Then (D) implies that  D 0, (C) implies that g.x; y/ D u2 < 0,
and (A) and (B) imply that f1.x; y/ D 0 and f2.x; y/ D 0. Thus, .x; y/ is an interior
critical point of f:
CASE II
u D 0. Then (C) implies that g.x; y/ D 0, and (A) and (B) imply that
rf .x; y/ D rg.x; y/, so that .x; y/ is a boundary point candidate for the location
of the extreme value.
This technique can be extended to the problem of ﬁnding extreme values of a

The Method of Least Squares
Important optimization problems arise in the statistical analysis of experimental data.
Frequently, experiments are designed to measure the values of one or more quantities

784
CHAPTER 13

supposed to be constant, or to demonstrate a supposed functional relationship between
variable quantities. Experimental error is usually present in the measurements, and
experiments need to be repeated several times in order to arrive at mean or average
values of the quantities being measured.
Consider a very simple example. An experiment to measure a certain physical
constant c is repeated n times, yielding the values c1; c2; : : : ; cn. If none of the mea-
surements is suspected of being faulty, intuition tells us that we should use the mean
value Nc D .c1 C c2 C    C cn/=n as the value of c determined by the experiments.
Let us see how this intuition can be justiﬁed.
Various methods for determining c from the data values are possible. We could,
for instance, choose c to minimize the sum T of its distances from the data points:
T D jc  c1j C jc  c2j C    C jc  cnj:
This is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. Since absolute values have singular
points, it is difﬁcult to determine the minimizing value of c. More importantly, c may
not be determined uniquely. If n D 2, any point in the interval between c1 and c2 will
give the same minimum value to T: (See Exercise 24 below for a generalization of this
phenomenon.)
A more promising approach is to minimize the sum S of squares of the distances
from c to the data points:
S D .c  c1/2 C .c  c2/2 C    C .c  cn/2 D
n
X
iD1
.c  ci/2:
S is known as the cost function or objective function. It is well known in the theory
of optimization that the objective function is not unique, and that the outcome depends
on the choice of objective function. There is no reason why, for example, we could not
choose to minimize the sum of the fourth powers of the distances from c to the data
points instead. However, the second power is both convenient and traditional. In this
type of analysis, we simply hope that other cost functions will produce results that are
not too different.
S is convenient because second-degree polynomials have linear derivatives, mean-
ing that the emerging expressions are linear equations, about which so much powerful
and straightforward mathematical machinery is easily available. To see this, we note
that S.c/ is smooth, and its (unconstrained) minimum value will occur at a critical
point Nc given by

Thus, Nc is the mean of the data values:

ci D c1 C c2 C    C cn

:
The technique used to obtain Nc above is an example of what is called the method
of least squares. It has the following geometric interpretation. If the data values
c1; c2; : : : ; cn are regarded as components of a vector c in Rn, and w is the vector with
components 1; 1; : : : ; 1, then the vector projection of c in the direction of w,
cw D c  w
jwj2 w D c1 C c2 C    C cn

w;
has all its components equal to the average of the data values. Thus, determining c from
the data by the method of least squares corresponds to ﬁnding the vector projection of
the data vector onto the one-dimensional subspace of Rn spanned by w. Had there
been no error in the measurements ci, then c would have been equal to cw.

SECTION 13.5:
The Method of Least Squares
785
Linear Regression
In scientiﬁc investigations it is often believed that the response of a system is a certain
kind of function of one or more input variables. An investigator can set up an exper-
iment to measure the response of the system for various values of those variables in
order to determine the parameters of the function.
For example, suppose that the response y of a system is suspected to depend on
the input x according to the linear relationship
y D ax C b;
where the values of a and b are unknown. An experiment set up to measure values of
y corresponding to several values of x yields n data points, .xi; yi/, i D 1; 2; : : : ; n.
If the supposed linear relationship is valid, these data points should lie approximately
along a straight line, but not exactly on one because of experimental error. Suppose
the points are as shown in Figure 13.19. The linear relationship seems reasonable in
this case. We want to ﬁnd values of a and b so that the straight line y D ax C b “best”
ﬁts the data.

This procedure for ﬁtting the “best” straight line through data points by the method
of least squares is called linear regression, and the line y D ax C b obtained in this
way is called the empirical regression line corresponding to the data. Some scientiﬁc
calculators with statistical features provide for linear regression by accumulating the
sums of xi, yi, x2
i , and xiyi in various registers and keeping track of the number n
of data points entered in another register. At any time it has available the information
necessary to calculate a and b and the value of y corresponding to any given x.

Remark
Linear regression can also be interpreted in terms of vector projection. The
data points deﬁne two vectors x and y in Rn with components x1; x2; : : : ; xn and
y1; y2; : : : ; yn, respectively. Let w be the vector with components 1; 1; : : : ; 1. Finding
the coefﬁcients a and b for the regression line corresponds to ﬁnding the orthogonal
projection of y onto the two-dimensional subspace (plane) in Rn spanned by x and w.

SECTION 13.5:
The Method of Least Squares
787
(See Figure 13.20.) This projection is p D axCbw. In fact, the two equations obtained
above by setting the partial derivatives of S equal to zero are just the two conditions
x

p D ax C bw is the
projection of y onto the plane spanned by x
and w
.y  p/  x D 0;
.y  p/  w D 0;
stating that y minus its projection onto the subspace is perpendicular to the subspace.
The angle between y and this p provides a measure of how well the empirical regression
line ﬁts the data; the smaller the angle, the better the ﬁt.
Linear regression can be used to ﬁnd speciﬁc functional relationships of types
other than linear if suitable transformations are applied to the data.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the values of constants K and s for which the curve y D Kxs
best ﬁts the experimental data points .xi; yi/, i D 1; 2; : : : ; n.
(Assume all data values are positive.)
Solution
Observe that the required functional form corresponds to a linear relation-
ship between ln y and ln x:
ln y D ln K C s ln x:
If we determine the parameters a and b of the empirical regression line  D a C b
corresponding to the transformed data .i; i/ D .ln xi; ln yi/, then s D a and K D eb
are the required values.
Remark
It should be stressed that the constants K and s obtained by the method
used in the solution above are not the same as those that would be obtained by di-
rect application of the least squares method to the untransformed problem, that is, by
minimizing Pn

Generally, the method of least squares is applied to ﬁt an equation in which the
response is expressed as a sum of constants times functions of one or more input vari-
ables. The constants are determined as critical points of the sum of squared deviations
of the actual response values from the values predicted by the equation.
Applications of the Least Squares Method to Integrals
The method of least squares can be used to ﬁnd approximations to reasonably well-
behaved (say, piecewise continuous) functions as sums of constants times speciﬁed
functions. The idea is to choose the constants to minimize the integral of the square of
the difference.
For example, suppose we want to approximate the continuous function f .x/ over
the interval Œ0; 1
 by a linear function g.x/ D px C q. The method of least squares
would require that p and q be chosen to minimize the integral

the Laplace, heat, and wave equations and other partial differential equations that arise
in applied mathematics. (See Section 9.9.)

Representing a function as the sum of a Fourier series is analogous to rep-
resenting a vector as a linear combination of basis vectors. If we think of continuous
functions on the interval Œ0;  as “vectors” with addition and scalar multiplication
deﬁned pointwise:

f are the components of f with respect to that basis.

13.6
Parametric Problems
In this section we will brieﬂy examine three unrelated situations in which we want
to differentiate a function with respect to a parameter rather than one of the basic
variables of the function. Such situations arise frequently in mathematics and its ap-
plications.
Differentiating Integrals with Parameters
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows how to differentiate a deﬁnite integral
with respect to the upper limit of integration:
d
dx
Z x
a
f .t/ dt D f .x/:
We are going to look at a different problem about differentiating integrals. If the
integrand of a deﬁnite integral also depends on variables other than the variable of
integration, then the integral will be a function of those other variables. How are we to
ﬁnd the derivative of such a function? For instance, consider the function F.x/ deﬁned
by
F.x/ D
Z b
a
f .x; t/ dt:
We would like to be able to calculate F 0.x/ by taking the derivative inside the integral:
F 0.x/ D d
dx
Z b
a
f .x; t/ dt D
Z b
a
@
@x f .x; t/ dt:

SECTION 13.6:
Parametric Problems
791
Observe that we use d=dx outside the integral and @=@x inside; this is because the
integral is a function of x only, but the integrand f is a function of both x and t. If
the integrand depends on more than one parameter, then partial derivatives would be
needed inside and outside the integral:
@
@x
Z b
a
f .x; y; t/ dt D
Z b
a
@
@x f .x; y; t/ dt:
The operation of taking a derivative with respect to a parameter inside the integral, or
differentiating through the integral, as it is usually called, seems plausible. We dif-
ferentiate sums term by term, and integrals are the limits of sums. However, both the
differentiation and integration operations involve the taking of limits (limits of New-
ton quotients for derivatives, limits of Riemann sums for integrals). Differentiating
through the integral requires changing the order in which the two limits are taken and,
therefore, requires justiﬁcation.
We have already seen another example of change of order of limits. When we
assert that two mixed partial derivatives with respect to the same variables are equal,
@2f
@x@y D @2f
@y@x ;
we are, in fact, saying that limits corresponding to differentiation with respect to x and
y can be taken in either order with the same result. This is not true in general; we
proved it under the assumption that both of the mixed partials were continuous. (See
Theorem 1 and Exercise 16 of Section 12.4.) In general, some assumptions are required
to justify the interchange of limits. The following theorem gives one set of conditions
that justify the interchange of limits involved in differentiating through the integral.

Remark
It can be shown that the conclusion of Theorem 6 also holds under the sole
assumption that f1.x; t/ is continuous on the closed, bounded rectangle c  x 
d; a  t  b. We cannot prove this here; the proof depends on a subtle property
called uniform continuity possessed by continuous functions on closed bounded sets in
Rn. (See Appendix IV for the case n D 1.) In any event, Theorem 6 is more useful for
our purposes because it allows for improper integrals.

The latter equation is the differential equation of simple harmonic motion. Observe
that the given equation for f and that for f 0 imply the initial conditions
f .b/ D a
and
f 0.b/ D 0:
Accordingly, we write the general solution of f 00.x/ D f .x/ in the form
f .x/ D A cos.x  b/ C B sin.x  b/:
The initial conditions then imply A D a and B D 0, so the required solution is
f .x/ D a cos.x  b/. Finally, we note that this function is indeed smooth enough
to allow the differentiations through the integral and is, therefore, the solution of the
given integral equation. (If you wish, verify it in the integral equation.)
Envelopes
An equation f .x; y; c/ D 0 that involves a parameter c as well as the variables x and
y represents a family of curves in the xy-plane. Consider, for instance, the family
f .x; y; c/ D x
c C cy  2 D 0:
This family consists of straight lines with intercepts .2c; 2=c/ on the coordinate axes.
Several of these lines are sketched in Figure 13.21. It appears that there is a curve to
which all these lines are tangent. This curve is called the envelope of the family of
lines.
In general, a curve C is called the envelope of the family of curves with equations
f .x; y; c/ D 0 if, for each value of c, the curve f .x; y; c/ D 0 is tangent to C at some
point depending on c.
For the family of lines in Figure 13.21 it appears that the envelope may be the
rectangular hyperbola xy D 1. We will verify this after developing a method for
determining the equation of the envelope of a family of curves. We assume that the
function f .x; y; c/ has continuous ﬁrst partials and that the envelope is a smooth curve.

these equations are parametric equations of the envelope. Since .x; y/ lies on the curve

SECTION 13.6:

where the partials of f are evaluated at

g.c/; h.c/; c

The slope of the curve f .x; y; c/ D 0 at

g.c/; h.c/; c

can be obtained by differ-
entiating its equation implicitly with respect to x:
f1 C f2

On the other hand, the slope of the envelope x D g.c/; y D h.c/ at that point is
dy=dx D h0.c/=g0.c/. Since the curve and the envelope are tangent at f

g.c/; h.c/; c

these slopes must be equal. Therefore,
f1 C f2

so
f1g0.c/ C f2h0.c/ D 0:
Combining this with equation ./ we get f3.x; y; c/ D 0 at all points of the envelope.
The equation of the envelope can be found by eliminating c between the two
equations
f .x; y; c/ D 0
and

that the envelope is xy D 1, as we conjectured earlier.

EXAMPLE 6
(The Mach cone) Suppose that sound travels at speed c in still
air and that a supersonic aircraft is travelling at speed v > c along
the x-axis, so that its position at time t is .vt; 0; 0/. Find the envelope at time t of the
sound waves created by the aircraft at previous times. See Figure 13.23.

Solution
The sound created by the aircraft at time  < t spreads out as a spherical
wave front at speed c. The centre of this wave front is .v; 0; 0/, the position of the
aircraft at time . At time t the radius of this wave front is c.t  /, so its equation is

Equations with Perturbations
In applied mathematics one frequently encounters intractable equations for which at
least approximate solutions are desired. Sometimes such equations result from adding
an extra term to what would otherwise be a simple and easily solved equation. This
extra term is called a perturbation of the simpler equation. Often the perturbation
has a coefﬁcient smaller than the other terms in the equation; that is, it is a small
perturbation. If this is the case, you can ﬁnd approximate solutions to the perturbed
equation by replacing the small coefﬁcient by a parameter and calculating Maclaurin
polynomials in that parameter. One example should serve to clarify the method.
EXAMPLE 7
Find an approximate solution of the equation

Without the logarithm term, the equation would clearly have the solution

Newton’s Method
A frequently encountered problem in applied mathematics is to determine, to some
desired degree of accuracy, a root (i.e., a solution r) of an equation of the form
f .r/ D 0:
Such a root is called a zero of the function f: In Section 4.2 we introduced Newton’s
Method, a simple but powerful method for determining roots of functions that are
sufﬁciently smooth. The method involves guessing an approximate value x0 for a root
r of the function f; and then calculating successive approximations x1, x2, : : : , using
the formula
xnC1 D xn  f .xn/
f 0.xn/;
n D 0; 1; 2;    :
If the initial guess x0 is not too far from r, and if jf 0.x/j is not too small and jf 00.x/j is
not too large near r, then the successive approximations x1, x2, : : : will converge very
rapidly to r. Recall that each new approximation xnC1 is obtained as the x-intercept
of the tangent line drawn to the graph of f at the previous approximation, xn. The
tangent line to the graph y D f .x/ at x D xn has equation
y  f .xn/ D f 0.xn/.x  xn/:
(See Figure 13.24.) The x-intercept, xnC1, of this line is determined by setting y D 0,
x D xnC1 in this equation, so is given by the formula in the shaded box above.
y

Figure 13.24
xnC1 is the x-intercept of
the tangent at xn
Newton’s Method can be extended to ﬁnding solutions of systems of m equations
in m variables. We will show here how to adapt the method to ﬁnd approximations to
a solution .x; y/ of the pair of equations
 f .x; y/ D 0
g.x; y/ D 0;
starting from an initial guess .x0; y0/. Under auspicious circumstances, we will ob-
serve the same rapid convergence of approximations to the root that typiﬁes the single-
variable case.
The idea is as follows. The two surfaces z D f .x; y/ and z D g.x; y/ intersect
in a curve which itself intersects the xy-plane at the point whose coordinates are the
desired solution. If .x0; y0/ is near that point, then the tangent planes to the two
surfaces at .x0; y0/ will intersect in a straight line. This line meets the xy-plane at a
point .x1; y1/ that should be even closer to the solution point than was .x0; y0/. We
can easily determine .x1; y1/. The tangent planes to z D f .x; y/ and z D g.x; y/ at
.x0; y0/ have equations
z D f .x0; y0/ C f1.x0; y0/.x  x0/ C f2.x0; y0/.y  y0/;
z D g.x0; y0/ C g1.x0; y0/.x  x0/ C g2.x0; y0/.y  y0/:

The values in Table 1 were calculated sequentially in a spreadsheet by the method
suggested below. They were rounded for inclusion in the table, but the unrounded
values were used in subsequent calculations. If you actually use the (rounded) values
of xn and yn given in the table to calculate f .xn; yn/ and g.xn; yn/, your results may
vary slightly.
The desired approximations to the root are the xn and yn values in the last line of
the above table. Note the rapidity of convergence. However, many function evaluations
are needed for each iteration of the method. For large systems, Newton’s Method is
computationally too inefﬁcient to be practical. Other methods requiring more iterations
but many fewer calculations per iteration are used in practice.
Implementing Newton’s Method Using a Spreadsheet
A computer spreadsheet is an ideal environment in which to calculate Newton’s Method
approximations.
For a pair of equations in two unknowns such as the system in
Example 1, you can proceed as follows:
(i) In the ﬁrst nine cells of the ﬁrst row (A1–I1) put the labels n, x, y, f, g, f1,
f2, g1, and g2.
(ii) In cells A2–A9 put the numbers 0, 1, 2, : : : , 7.
(iii) In cells B2 and C2 put the starting values x0 and y0.
(iv) In cells D2–I2 put formulas for calculating f .x; y/, g.x; y/, : : : , g2.x; y/ in
terms of values of x and y assumed to be in B2 and C2.
(v) In cells B3 and C3 store the Newton’s Method formulas for calculating x1
and y1 in terms of the values x0 and y0, using values calculated in the second
row. For instance, cell B3 should contain the formula
+B2-(D2I2-G2E2)/(F2I2-G2H2):
(vi) Replicate the formulas in cells D2–I2 to cells D3–I3.
(vii) Replicate the formulas in cells B3–I3 to the cells B4–I9.
You can now inspect the successive approximations xn and yn in columns B and C. To
use different starting values, just replace the numbers in cells B2 and C2. To solve a
different system of (two) equations, replace the contents of cells D2–I2. You may wish
to save this spreadsheet for reuse with the exercises below or other systems you may
want to solve later.
Remark
While a detailed analysis of the convergence of Newton’s Method approx-
imations is beyond the scope of this book, a few observations can be made. At each
step in the approximation process we must divide by J , the Jacobian determinant of
f and g with respect to x and y evaluated at the most recently obtained approxima-
tion. Assuming that the functions and partial derivatives involved in the formulas are
continuous, the larger the value of J at the actual solution, the more likely are the
approximations to converge to the solution, and to do so rapidly. If J vanishes (or is
very small) at the solution, the successive approximations may not converge, even if
the initial guess is quite close to the solution. Even if the ﬁrst partials of f and g are
large at the solution, their Jacobian may be small if their gradients are nearly parallel
there. Thus, we cannot expect convergence to be rapid when the curves f .x; y/ D 0
and g.x; y/ D 0 intersect at a very small angle.
Newton’s Method can be applied to systems of m equations in m variables; the
formulas are the obvious generalizations of those for two functions given above.

Calculations with Maple
The calculations involved in solving systems of equations involving several variables
can be very lengthy, even if the number of variables is small. In particular, locating
critical points of a function of n variables involves solving a system of n (usually non-
linear) equations in n unknowns. In such situations the effective use of a computer
algebra system like Maple can be very helpful. In this optional (and brief) section we
present examples of how to use Maple’s “fsolve” routine to solve systems of nonlin-
ear equations and to ﬁnd and classify critical points and thereby solve extreme-value
problems.
Solving Systems of Equations
Maple has a procedure called fsolve built into its kernel (no package needs to be loaded
to access it) that attempts to ﬁnd ﬂoating-point real solutions to systems n equations
in n variables. (For a single polynomial equation in one variable it will try to ﬁnd
all the real roots, but it may miss some.) For our purposes, an equation consists of
either a single expression f in the variables (in which case the equation is taken to be
f D 0) or else two expressions joined by an equal sign, as in f D g. The procedure
takes two or three arguments. The ﬁrst is a set of n equations, enclosed in braces and
separated by commas. The second argument is a set (also enclosed in braces) listing
the n variables for which the equations are to be solved. (The number of variables in
the equations must equal the number of equations.) The elements of the second set
may consist of equations of the form “variable = initial guess,” where the initial guess
is a number we have reason to believe is close to the actual solution. It may not always
be possible to make a good initial guess at the values of the variables, so, if we like,
we can include a third argument speciﬁng intervals of values of the variables in which
to search for a solution. For example, to ﬁnd a solution to the system x2 C y3 D 3,
x sin.y/  y cos.x/ D 0 near .1; 2/, we could try
>
Digits := 6:
>
fsolve({x^2+y^2=3, x*sin(y)-y*cos(x)}, {x=1, y=2});
fx D 0:909510; y D 1:47404g

SECTION 13.8:
Calculations with Maple
803
If we had been unable to specify an initial guess, but instead had looked for a solution
with x and y in Œ0; 2, we would have got the same answer:
>
fsolve({x^2+y^2=3, x*sin(y)-y*cos(x)},
{x,y}, {x=0..2, y=0..2});
fx D 0:909510; y D 1:47404g
In fact, not specifying an initial guess or even search intervals would have led to the
same outcome:
>
fsolve({x^2+y^2=3, x*sin(y)-y*cos(x)}, {x,y});
fy D 1:47404; x D 0:909510g;
although, for its own private reasons, Maple chose to report the values of x and y in
the opposite order this time. Had we speciﬁed a different search interval, we might
have got a different result:
>
fsolve({x^2+y^2=3, x*sin(y)-y*cos(x)},
{x,y}, {x=0..2, y=0..1});
fy D 0:; x D 1:73205g
or even no solution at all, if there is in fact no solution in the given intervals.
>
fsolve({x^2+y^2=3, x*sin(y)-y*cos(x)},
{x,y}, {x=0..1, y=0..1});
fsolve.fx2 C y2 D 3; s sin.y/  y sin.x/g; fx; yg; fx D .0::1/; y D .0::1/g/
Using fsolve efﬁciently usually requires us to have some idea where solutions can
be found. If the number of variables is 2 or 3, Maple’s graphical routines can often be
used to help us ﬁnd approximate locations of solutions.

What are we to use for initial guesses? The ﬁrst equation cannot be satisﬁed by
any points outside the square 1  x  1, 1  y  1, so we need only consider
starting values for x and y inside this square. The second equation then forces z to lie
between 1 and 1. We could just try many initial guesses that satisfy these conditions
and see what we get using fsolve. Alternatively, we can make several implicit plots of
the three equations for ﬁxed values of z between 1 and 1, looking for cases where the
three curves come close to having a common intersection point:
>
with(plots):
for z from -1 by .2 to 1 do print("z =", z);
implicitplot({x^2+y^4-1, z-x^3*y, exp(x)-2*y+z},
x=-1.5 .. 1.5, y=-1.5 .. 1.5) od;
These commands produce 11 graphs of the three equations, considered as depend-
ing on x and y for z values ranging from 1 to 1 in steps of 0:2. Two of them
are shown in Figure 13.26 and Figure 13.27.
They correspond to z D 0:2 and
z D 0:2 and indicate that the three equations likely have solutions near .1; 0:2; 0:2/
and .0:5; 0:9; 0:2/. We run fsolve with these starting values and then substitute the
resulting output into the three equations to check that the equations are satisﬁed. We
limit Maple’s output to 6 signiﬁcant ﬁgures rather than the default 10:

We have found the two solutions to 6 signiﬁcant digits.
Finding and Classifying Critical Points
Finding the critical points of a function of several variables amounts to solving the
system of equations obtained by setting the ﬁrst partial derivatives of the function to
zero. The following example illustrates how this can be accomplished using Maple’s
fsolve routine. Since we also want to classify the critical points, we will ﬁnd the
eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the function at each critical point to determine
whether that matrix is positive deﬁnite, negative deﬁnite, or indeﬁnite.
Because the VectorCalculus package contains a procedure Hessian for calculat-
ing the Hessian matrix and the LinearAlgebra package contains a procedure Eigen-
values for determining the eigenvalues of a square matrix, we will either have to load
both these packages or else call the procedures using VectorCalculus[Hessian]
and LinearAlgebra[Eigenvalues], respectively.
As we need nothing else
from these packages here, we will do it the latter way. If you have a version earlier
than Maple 8, be aware that the older linalg package has procedures hessian and
eigenvals that will do the same job.
EXAMPLE 2
Find and classify the critical points of
.x2 C xy C 5y2 C x  y/e.x2Cy2/:
Solution
We begin by deﬁning f to be the expression above, which involves only
the two variables x and y. We don’t need f to be a function, so just deﬁne it as an
expression.
>
f := (x^2+x*y+5*y^2+x-y)*exp(-(x^2+y^2));

Next, we deﬁne H to be the Hessian matrix for f with respect to the variables x and
y. Since this produces several lines of output, we will suppress the output.
>
H := VectorCalculus[Hessian](f,[x,y]):
The equations we want to solve to ﬁnd the critical points of f are

eqns := {diff(f,x)=0, diff(f,y)=0}:
Again we have surpressed output. We could have omitted the “ D 0” from each equa-
tion; it would have been assumed.
Now comes the hard part: where do we look for solutions? Plotting some level
curves of f can suggest likely locations for critical points.

.1:6; 0:2/. We use each of these as initial guesses with fsolve. For each we ﬁrst run
fsolve to ﬁnd the critical point. Then we ﬁnd the value of f at that point. Finally,
we calculate the eigenvalues of the Hessian of f to determine the nature of the critical
point. We set Maple for 6 signiﬁcant ﬁgures again.

Remark
The most difﬁcult part of using fsolve for large systems is determining
suitable starting values for the roots or critical points. Graphical means are really only
suitable for small systems (one, two, or three equations), and even then it is important
to analyze the equations or functions involved for clues on where the roots or critical
points may be. Here are some possibilities to consider:

SECTION 13.9:

807
1. Sometimes some of the equations will be simple enough that they can be solved for
some variables and thus used to reduce the size of the system. We could have used
the second equation in Example 1 to eliminate z from the ﬁrst and third equations
and, hence, reduced the system to two equations in two unknowns.
2. The system might result from adding a small extra term to a simpler system, the
location of whose roots is known. In this case you can use those known roots as
initial guesses.
3. Always be alert for equations limiting the possible values of some variables. For
instance, in Example 1 the equation x2 C y4 D 1 limited x and y to the interval

Entropy in Statistical Mechanics and Information Theory
Entropy was introduced in Chapter 12 as an independent variable in a function that
determines internal energy. Many feel compelled to ask what entropy means physically.
It is curious that when carefully examined, thermodynamic energy is no less intuitively
mysterious from a physical point of view, but few feel moved to subject it to the same
level of scrutiny. Nonetheless, physicists have delved extensively into the microscopic
origins of both of these quantities through the subject of statistical mechanics.
This section presents gateway applications (marked E) that pertain to entropy
and represent entries into two distinct ﬁelds without attempting comprehensive treat-
ments. First, elementary multivariate calculus leads to a statistical mechanical view of
entropy. This not only turns out to be surprisingly simple, but it also has an unantici-
pated broad scope, as often happens with mathematics. An important example of this is
the distinct ﬁeld of information theory where entropy becomes the central object. As
an entry to the subject, we illustrate with the elementary example of data compression.
E
Boltzmann Entropy
The main city graveyard of Vienna is a fascinating place. It is the ﬁnal resting place
of many important historical ﬁgures, including the famous scientist Ludwig Boltz-
mann. His tombstone has an equation carved into it that relates a quantity S, known as
entropy, to a single quantity W; known as statistical weight. W represents the number
of ways that atomic and molecular positions and momenta can be rearranged without

808
CHAPTER 13
Applications of Partial Derivatives
apparently changing how a physical system appears to us in our everyday world.
Entropy is how we keep track of all of these invisible possibilities in thermo-
dynamics. It has the key property that the overall entropy of two completely inde-
pendent physical systems is just the sum of the entropies of each system evaluated
separately. On the other hand, the number of ways one system can be arranged is in-
dependent of the other system, so the overall statistical weight of the independent pair
of systems viewed as a whole is just the product of the statistical weights from each
system. The size of the statistical weights are so large in reality that one can very ef-
fectively treat them as continuous variables and entropy as a differentiable function of
them. We will use these properties to deduce the unique equation, valid for all systems,
that you will ﬁnd on Boltzmann’s tombstone when you make your visit to the main city
graveyard of Vienna.
We seek a unique function of the form S D f .W / valid for all physical systems.
Accordingly, two independent systems, labelled 1 and 2, will have entropies given by
S1 D f .W1/ and S2 D f .W2/ in terms of their statistical weights W1 and W2.
Because of additivity, S D S1 C S2. Because of independence, for every state in
system 1 there are W2 states in independent system 2, so the number of states for both
systems combined is W D W1W2. Thus, S D f .W / D f .W1W2/. Since S1 does not
depend on W2 and S2 does not depend on W1, it follows that
dS1
dW1
D @S
@W1
D f 0.W /W2
and
dS2
dW2
D @S
@W2
D f 0.W /W1;
and so
W1
dS1
dW1
D W2
dS2
dW2
:
Since the left side of this equation is independent of W2 and the right side is indepen-
dent of W1, both sides sides must be independent of both variables and so must be a
constant k. Hence, S1 D k ln W1 C C1 and S2 D k ln W2 C C2: The only way to make
the function of statistical weight independent of the system is to require that entropy
vanish when there is only one way to arrange the system; that is, when the statistical
weight is 1, the entropy must be 0, and C1 D C2 D 0 (see Exercise 1 below). Thus,
generally,
S D k ln W;
which is Boltzmann’s epitaph. A quibble is that the actual epitaph precedes the use of
the ln notation for the natural logarithm. So what is actually carved in the stone is
S D k:logeW
where the unorthodox “period” so carved clearly denotes multiplication.
The positive constant k is known as the Boltzmann constant, which is regarded
as one of the fundamental constants of nature. If entropy has units of energy per
temperature, as we deduce from the deﬁnition of temperature in Chapter 12, then those
are also the units of k. In modern physics, k is often written kB to distinguish it
from other uses for the symbol. But because temperature scales are discretionary to an
extent, k can just as easily be set to 1 with suitable units.
E
Shannon Entropy
An equivalent form of entropy can be expressed in terms of probabilities. We intro-
duced it in Example 1 of Section 13.4. Although this form originated in physics, also
dating back to Boltzmann, it was made most famous by Claude Shannon in the 1950s in
his creation, information theory. Thus, it became widely known as Shannon entropy.
We adopt this slightly ahistorical usage for that reason.

SECTION 13.9:
Entropy in Statistical Mechanics and Information Theory
809
To deduce this form, ﬁrst consider an ensemble of M identical systems, each with
entropy S. Each system has the same internal probability pi of being in any particular
state i. The number of systems in state i is Mpi = mi, where P
i pi D 1. The number
of ways that the collection of M systems can have m1 systems in state 1, m2 systems
in state 2, etc., is
WM D
MŠ
m1Š m2Š    miŠ   :
By additivity, the combined entropy of the M systems is
SM D MS D k ln WM D k.ln MŠ 
X
i
ln miŠ/:
If we use the Modiﬁed Stirling Formula ln mŠ  m ln mm (see Exercise 45 of Section
9.6) to approximate the factorials, the above expression becomes

so that, on division by M, we get
S D k

pi ln pi:
Example 1 in Section 13.4 illustrated this with two constraints. This representa-
tion of entropy also retains a useful maximum property when constrained in terms of
probability alone. For example, consider the problem
extremize:
S D k
n
X
iD1
pi ln pi
where
n

The maximum value occurs when all the probabilities pi are equal to 1=n. We expect a
maximum principle to persist because in Example 1 of Section 13.4 it became apparent
that any attempt to ﬁnd a critical point of the entropy of the system led to a maximum
value of the entropy.
E
Information Theory
The joining of probability with the maximum property of entropy led, amazingly, to
an understanding of the general limits of transmission and encoding of signals, which
was the origin of the subject of information theory. In information theory, entropy is
expressed in a superﬁcially different manner than it is in statistical mechanics. Instead
of the natural logarithm, log to the base 2 is normally, but not necessarily, used and the
constant is set to 1,
S D H.p1; : : : ; pN / D

H is the customary notation for the Shannon or information entropy (or just informa-
tion). It is a common problem that one must dress up universal concepts in different
clothes as they pass between different ﬁelds. Although H has been widely adopted by
users of information theory, its use to denote entropy in this probabilistic form actu-
ally dates back to Boltzmann, who articulated his early ideas in his historically famous
“H-theorem.” In this form, H can be viewed as the mean value of log21=pi, which is
called the self information or the surprisal.

810
CHAPTER 13
Applications of Partial Derivatives
Of course, these superﬁcial changes do not alter the basic properties of entropy.
H still has the maximum property, and it is still additive. That is, two independent
systems with entropies H1 and H2 can be regarded as a single system with entropy
H1 C H2. The proof of this is left as an exercise. (See Exercise 3.)
If one has a sequence of n bits to represent a number in base 2, then there are 2n
possible numbers, and the probability, when all probabilities are the same, of any one
number is 2n. This is the maximum entropy scenario. In this case for n bits,
H D 
2n
X
iD1
2n log2 2n D n:
Thus, the maximum information entropy is nothing more than the number of bits in
the sequence.
We can use a string of bits to send a message, even though we send messages with
an alphabet instead of bits. We can imagine a message as being a string of x characters.
Each character is drawn from an alphabet of y letters. If all letters are equally likely,
the number of possible messages is yx. This means that the entropy of the message
string is
Hm D 
yx
X
iD1
yx log2 yx D yx yx .x/ log2 y D x log2 y:
On the other hand, the entropy of each letter is given by
Hl D 
y
X
iD1
y1 log2 y1 D y y1 .1/ log2 y D log2 y:
By the additivity of entropy, since the message consists of x such letters, it’s entropy
must satisfy
Hm D xHl D x log2 y;
agreeing with the earlier calculation.
We can use a bit string to assign a speciﬁc string of bits to represent one mem-
ber of an alphabet. The now-classical example is ASCII (American Standard Code for
Information Interchange), which in its original form had 27 D 128 characters in its al-
phabet. This included the regular English alphabet in upper- and lower-case, numbers,
punctuation marks, and other special characters. For ASCII, in the unlikely case where
all characters were equally probable, the entropy of our x-character message would be
Hm D 7x. More generally, for an m-bit alphabet (i.e., y D 2m),
Hm D mx:
Thus, what seemed to be the maximum entropy for the message string turns out to be
equivalent to the maximum entropy of the entire binary string, since mx D n.
The relationship between entropy and bit string length only holds in the case of
equal probabilities with symbols represented by equal numbers of bits. We could, for
example, change the probability structure by making some of the characters in the
alphabet more likely than others, while using the same rules for sending the message
in terms of bits. In that case, the number of bits would be unchanged, but the entropy
would not be given by the length of the bit string any longer. Instead of the length of
the string, the entropy is given by
H D x

pi log2 pi:

SECTION 13.9:

811
Here pi is the probability of character i in an alphabet of y characters forming a mes-
sage string of x characters.
This allows the possibility of compression. We might, on average, send a partic-
ular message with fewer than mx bits. This can be done quite simply by allowing the
alphabet to be represented by unique bit strings of varying size. The improbable char-
acters are assigned to longer bit strings, while the probable ones are assigned to shorter
ones. A theorem from information theory says that the best compression possible is
given by
 Py
iD1 pi log2 pi

;
which is just the ratio of entropies.
EXAMPLE 1
Suppose our alphabet has only y D 8 characters, using the letters
A through H for convenience. Then log2 y D 3, and we must
use an average of 3 bits per character. Suppose, however, that the probabilities of the
characters are as follows:

using three ﬁgures of accuracy.
If we represent A by the string 10, B by 11, C by 001, D by 000, E by 010, F by 0111,
G by 01101, and H by 01100, any string of bits can be uniquely decoded by a simple
algorithm. One such algorithm for decoding the string character by character is:
Read the ﬁrst two bits.
If 1 0 then A (done)
If 1 1 then B (done)
If 0 0 then read the 3rd bit
If 1 then C (done)
If 0 then D (done)
If 0 1 then read the 3rd bit
If 0 then E (done)
If 1 then read the 4th bit
If 1 then F (done)
If 0 then read the 5th bit
If 1 then G (done)
If 0 then H (done)
Repeat the above starting with the ﬁrst unread bits for remaining characters. Here, in
conformance to the entropy structure for average string length 3 bits, 2 bits correspond
to the most probable letters while 5 bits represent the least. The optimal encoding
scheme is not unique; all that is needed to be optimal is to assign the numbers of bits in
such a way that the correct encoding can be deduced. If we use this encoding structure,
we will on average have 89.6% of the message length of a scheme that assigns exactly
3 bits to every one of the characters in the 8-character alphabet.
Compression is just one simple application. There are also many other important
results of information theory such as the transmission capacity on noisy channels, data
analysis methods, and much more.

among N states is just NŠ. But suppose these states form M
groupings, each grouping with distinct energy i per atom,
such that the atoms within each grouping may be exchanged
without observable consequence. The physical condition of
the system can then be speciﬁed by knowing only the number
of atoms in each of these groupings, n1; n2; : : : ; nM , where
PM

Assuming all ni are large, use the Modiﬁed Stirling
approximation ln nŠ  n ln n  n to show that maximizing the
entropy S D k ln W subject to the constraints of having a
ﬁxed total number N of atoms, and a ﬁxed total energy
PM

where the constants A and B are determined by the values of
the Lagrange multipliers for the constrained extremal problem
for S, and hence by the two constraints.

The result of the previous problem holds for other classes of
particles, for instance, molecules of an ideal gas, provided the
energies of the particles are mainly the kinetic energies of
their translational motions. In that result, we can let N and M
grow very large in such a way that the largest gap between
adjacent values of j approaches zero in length. In the limit,
the kinetic energy of each atom is a function of its mass m and
speed v:  D 1
2mv2.
Consider for the moment only the part of the kinetic
energy of the particle due to its velocity ui in the x direction.
The number of atoms for which the x-component of velocity
is u will be given by a density function n.u/ satisfying, by the
result of the previous exercise,

is a normally distributed probability
density function. What are the values of the mean and
variance of u? (See Deﬁnition 7 in Section 7.8 and the
following discussion.) Express the value of A in terms of B,
m, and N.
(b) Find the expectation of u2 for the random variable u, and
hence the expected value of the part of the kinetic energy of a
random particle in our system due to its motion in the x
direction. What is the expected value of the total kinetic
energy of a random particle in the system, and of all the
particles?
(c) Use the formula E D 3

12.6 or the discussion preceding Example 4 in Section 12.8),
expressing the energy of an ideal gas at absolute temperature

Introduction
In this chapter we extend the concept of the deﬁnite inte-
gral to functions of several variables. Deﬁned as limits of
Riemann sums, like the one-dimensional deﬁnite integral, such multiple integrals can
be evaluated using successive single deﬁnite integrals. They are used to represent and
calculate quantities speciﬁed in terms of densities in regions of the plane or spaces of
higher dimension. In the simplest instance, the volume of a three-dimensional region
is given by a double integral of its height over the two-dimensional plane region that
is its base.

problem, namely, the problem of ﬁnding the area of the plane region bounded by the
curve y D f .x/, the x-axis, and the lines x D a and x D b. Similarly, we can
motivate the double integral of a function of two variables over a domain D in the
plane by means of the standard volume problem of ﬁnding the volume of the three-
dimensional region S bounded by the surface z D f .x; y/, the xy-plane, and the
cylinder parallel to the z-axis passing through the boundary of D. (See Figure 14.1. D
is called the domain of integration.) We will call such a three-dimensional region S
a “solid,” although we are not implying that it is ﬁlled with any particular substance.
We will deﬁne the double integral of f .x; y/ over the domain D,
ZZ

f .x; y/ dA;
in such a way that its value will give the volume of the solid S whenever D is a
“reasonable” domain and f is a “reasonable” function with positive values.

Let us start with the case where D is a closed rectangle with sides parallel to the
coordinate axes in the xy-plane, and f is a bounded function on D. If D consists of
the points .x; y/ such that a  x  b and c  y  d, we can form a partition P
of D into small rectangles by partitioning each of the intervals Œa; b and Œc; d, say by
points

c D y0 < y1 < y2 <    < yn1 < yn D d:

which is the sum of mn terms, one for each rectangle in the partition. (Here, the

is itself a sum as j goes from 1 to n.) The term corresponding to rectangle Rij is, if
f .x

the Riemann sum R.f; P / approximates the volume above D and under the graph of
f: The double integral of f over D is deﬁned to be the limit of such Riemann sums,
provided the limit exists as kP k ! 0 independently of how the points .x

chosen. We make this precise in the following deﬁnition.

The dA that appears in the expression for the double integral is an area element. It
represents the limit of the A D x y in the Riemann sum and can also be written
dx dy or dy dx, the order being unimportant. When we evaluate double integrals by
iteration in the next section, dA will be replaced with a product of differentials dx and
dy, and the order will be important.
As is true for functions of one variable, functions that are continuous on D are
integrable on D. Of course, many bounded but discontinuous functions are also inte-
grable, but an exact description of the class of integrable functions is beyond the scope
of this text.

Double Integrals over More General Domains
It is often necessary to use double integrals of bounded functions f .x; y/ over domains
that are not rectangles. If the domain D is bounded, we can choose a rectangle R
with sides parallel to the coordinate axes such that D is contained inside R. (See
Figure 14.5.) If f .x; y/ is deﬁned on D, we can extend its domain to be R by deﬁning
f .x; y/ D 0 for points in R that are outside of D. The integral of f over D can then
be deﬁned to be the integral of the extended function over the rectangle R.

DEFINITION
2
If f .x; y/ is deﬁned and bounded on domain D, let Of be the extension of f
that is zero everywhere outside D:
Of .x; y/ D
 f .x; y/;
if .x; y/ belongs to D
0;
if .x; y/ does not belong to D.
If D is a bounded domain, then it is contained in some rectangle R with sides
parallel to the coordinate axes. If Of is integrable over R, we say that f is
integrable over D and deﬁne the double integral of f over D to be
ZZ
D
f .x; y/ dA D
ZZ
R
Of .x; y/ dA:
This deﬁnition makes sense because the values of Of in the part of R outside of D are
all zero, so do not contribute anything to the value of the integral. However, even if
f is continuous on D, Of will not be continuous on R unless f .x; y/ ! 0 as .x; y/
approaches the boundary of D. Nevertheless, if f and D are “well-behaved,” the
integral will exist. We cannot delve too deeply into what constitutes well-behaved, but
assert, without proof, the following theorem that will assure us that most of the double
integrals we encounter do, in fact, exist.
T H E O R E M

If f is continuous on a closed, bounded domain D whose boundary consists of ﬁnitely
many curves of ﬁnite length, then f is integrable on D.
According to Theorem 2 of Section 13.1, a continuous function is bounded if its domain
is closed and bounded. Generally, however, it is not necessary to restrict our domains
to be closed. If D is a bounded domain and int(D) is its interior (an open set), and if
f is integrable on D, then

Properties of the Double Integral
Some properties of double integrals are analogous to properties of the one-dimensional
deﬁnite integral and require little comment: if f and g are integrable over D, and if L

Double Integrals by Inspection
As yet, we have not said anything about how to evaluate a double integral. The main
technique for doing this, called iteration, will be developed in the next section, but it is
worth pointing out that double integrals can sometimes be evaluated using symmetry
arguments or by interpreting them as volumes that we already know.

The domain of integration (Figure 14.7) is a circular disk of radius 1 centred at the
origin. Since f .x; y/ D sin x is an odd function of x, its graph bounds as much
volume below the xy-plane in the region x < 0 as it does above the xy-plane in the
region x > 0. These two contributions to the double integral cancel, so I1 D 0. Note
that symmetry of both the domain and the integrand is necessary for this argument.
Similarly, I2 D 0 because y3 is an odd function and D is symmetric about the
x-axis.

Iteration of Double Integrals in Cartesian Coordinates
The existence of the double integral

D. As we shall see, evaluation of double integrals is easiest when the domain of
integration is of simple type.

An x-simple domain
We say that the domain D in the xy-plane is y-simple if it is bounded by two vertical
lines x D a and x D b, and two continuous graphs y D c.x/ and y D d.x/ between
these lines. (See Figure 14.10.) Lines parallel to the y-axis intersect a y-simple domain
in an interval (possibly a single point) if at all. Similarly, D is x-simple if it is bounded
by horizontal lines y D c and y D d, and two continuous graphs x D a.y/ and
x D b.y/ between these lines. (See Figure 14.11.) Many of the domains over which we
will take integrals are y-simple, x-simple, or both. For example, rectangles, triangles,
and disks are both x-simple and y-simple. Those domains that are neither one nor
the other will usually be unions of ﬁnitely many nonoverlapping subdomains that are

822
CHAPTER 14

both x-simple and y-simple. We will call such domains regular. The shaded region
in Figure 14.12 is divided into four subregions, each of which is both x-simple and
y-simple.

D
Figure 14.12
A regular domain
It can be shown that a bounded, continuous function f .x; y/ is integrable over a
bounded x-simple or y-simple domain and, therefore, over any regular domain.
Unlike the examples in the previous section, most double integrals cannot be eval-
uated by inspection. We need a technique for evaluating double integrals similar to the
technique for evaluating single deﬁnite integrals in terms of antiderivatives. Since the
double integral represents a volume, we can evaluate it for simple domains by a slicing
technique.
Suppose, for instance, that D is y-simple and is bounded by x D a, x D b,
y D c.x/, and y D d.x/, as shown in Figure 14.13(a). Then
RR
D f .x; y/ dA represents
(at least for positive f ) the volume of the solid region inside the vertical cylinder
through the boundary of D and between the xy-plane and the surface z D f .x; y/.
Consider the cross-section of this solid in the vertical plane perpendicular to the x-axis
at position x. Note that x is constant in that plane. If we use the projections of the
y- and z-axes onto the plane as coordinate axes there, the cross-section is a plane
region bounded by vertical lines y D c.x/ and y D d.x/, by the horizontal line
z D 0, and by the curve z D f .x; y/. The area of the cross-section is therefore given
by
A.x/ D
Z d.x/
c.x/
f .x; y/ dy:
The double integral
RR
D f .x; y/ dA is obtained by summing the volumes of “thin”
slices of area A.x/ and thickness dx between x D a and x D b and is therefore given
by
RELAX! Do not be confused by
the position of the dx in the
formula ./. Although up until
now we have been in the habit of
writing the integral of a function
A.x/ from x D a to x D b in the
form
Z b
a
A.x/ dx; there is no
reason we cannot write the dx
before instead of after the A.x/:
Z b
a
A.x/ dx D
Z b
a
dx A.x/:
When A.x/ is itself an integral
in a different variable, as it is in
./, writing the dx closer to its
own integral sign can be useful.
It is still understood that the y
integral must be done ﬁrst as its
integrand and limits can both
depend on x so the result will be
a function A.x/ of x.

SECTION 14.2:
Iteration of Double Integrals in Cartesian Coordinates
823
The expressions on the right-hand sides of the above formulas are called iterated
integrals. Iteration is the process of reducing the problem of evaluating a double
(or multiple) integral to one of evaluating two (or more) successive single deﬁnite
integrals. In the above iteration, the integral
Z d.x/
c.x/
f .x; y/ dy
is called the inner integral since it must be evaluated ﬁrst. It is evaluated using standard
techniques, treating x as a constant. The result of this evaluation is a function of x
alone (note that both the integrand and the limits of the inner integral can depend on
x) and is the integrand of the outer integral in which x is the variable of integration.
For double integrals over x-simple domains, we can slice perpendicularly to the
y-axis and obtain an iterated integral with the outer integral in the y direction. (See
Figure 14.13(b).) We summarize the above discussion in the following theorem whose
formal proof we will, however, not give.

Remark
The symbol dA in the double integral is replaced in the iterated integrals
by the dx and the dy. Accordingly, dA is frequently written dx dy or dy dx even in
the double integral. The three expressions
ZZ
D
f .x; y/ dx dy;
ZZ
D
f .x; y/ dy dx;
and
ZZ
D
f .x; y/ dA
all stand for the double integral of f over D. Only when the double integral is iterated
does the order of dx and dy become important. Later in this chapter we will iterate
double integrals in polar coordinates, and dA will take the form r dr d.
It is not always necessary to make a three-dimensional sketch of the solid volume
represented by a double integral. In order to iterate the integral properly (in one direc-
tion or the other) it is usually sufﬁcient to make a sketch of the domain D over which
the integral is taken. The direction of iteration can be shown by a line along which the
inner integral is taken. The following examples illustrate this.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the volume of the solid lying above the square Q deﬁned by
0  x  1 and 1  y  2 and below the plane z D 4  x  y.
Solution
The square Q is both x-simple and y-simple, so the double integral giving
the volume can be iterated in either direction. We will do it both ways just for practice.
The horizontal line at height y in Figure 14.14 suggests that we ﬁrst integrate with
respect to x along this line (from 0 to 1) and then integrate the result with respect to y
from 1 to 2. Iterating the double integral in this direction, we calculate

It is comforting to get the same answer both ways! Note that because Q is a rectangle
with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the limits of the inner integrals do not depend
on the variables of the outer integrals in either iteration. This cannot be expected to
happen with more general domains.

In both of the examples above, the double integral could be evaluated easily using
either possible iteration. (We did them both ways just to illustrate that fact.) It often
occurs, however, that a double integral is easily evaluated if iterated in one direction
and very difﬁcult, or impossible, if iterated in the other direction. Sometimes you will
even encounter iterated integrals whose evaluation requires that they be expressed as
double integrals and then reiterated in the opposite direction.

The following is an example of the calculation of the volume of a somewhat awkward
solid. Even though it is not always necessary to sketch solids to ﬁnd their volumes, you
are encouraged to sketch them whenever possible. When we encounter triple integrals
over three-dimensional regions later in this chapter, it will usually be necessary to
sketch the regions. Get as much practice as you can.

Solution
The solid is shown in Figure 14.19. Its base is the parabolic segment D in

Remark
Maple’s int routine can be nested to evaluate iterated double (or multiple)
integrals symbolically. For instance, the iterated integral for the volume V calculated
in Example 4 above can be calculated via the Maple command
>
V = int(int(a+y, y=0..a - x^2/a), x=-a..a);
V D 28

Recall that “int” has an inert form “Int,” which prints the integral without attempting
to evaluate it symbolically. For instance, we can print an equation for the reiterated
integral in the solution of Example 3 using the command

Of course, Maple can’t evaluate all integrals in symbolic form. If we replace exp.y3/
in the iterated integral above with exp.x3/, recent versions of Maple will just return
the inert form as the answer, being unable to calculate the inner integral.

In recent versions of Maple it is not necessary to use the inert form of the integral with

bers for values of evidently real integrals) if you did not use the inert form. Software
like Maple is constantly being revised and tweaked so that in unusual circumstances
different versions of the software can lead to different results.

Improper Integrals and a Mean-Value Theorem
To simplify matters, the deﬁnition of the double integral given in Section 14.1 required
that the domain D be bounded and that the integrand f be bounded on D. As in
the single-variable case, improper double integrals can arise if either the domain of
integration is unbounded or the integrand is unbounded near any point of the domain
or its boundary.
Improper Integrals of Positive Functions
An improper integral of a function f satisfying f .x; y/  0 on the domain D must
either exist (i.e., converge to a ﬁnite value) or be inﬁnite (diverge to inﬁnity). Conver-
gence or divergence of improper double integrals of such nonnegative functions can
be determined by iterating them and determining the convergence or divergence of any
single improper integrals that result.

Remark
In each of the examples above, the integrand was nonnegative on the do-
main of integration. Nonpositive integrands could have been handled similarly, but
we cannot deal here with the convergence of general improper double integrals with
integrands f .x; y/ that take both positive and negative values on the domain D of the
integral. We remark, however, that such an integral cannot converge unless
ZZ
E
f .x; y/ dA
is ﬁnite for every bounded, regular subdomain E of D. We cannot, in general, de-
termine the convergence of the given integral by looking at the convergence of itera-
tions. The double integral may diverge even if its iterations converge. (See Exercise
21 below.) In fact, opposite iterations may even give different values. This happens
because of cancellation of inﬁnite volumes of opposite sign. (Similar behaviour in
one dimension is exempliﬁed by the integral
R 1
1 dx=x, which does not exist, although
it represents the difference between “equal” but inﬁnite areas.) It can be shown (for
a large class of functions containing, for example, continuous functions) that an im-
proper double integral of f .x; y/ over D converges if the integral of jf .x; y/j over D
converges:
ZZ
D
jf .x; y/j dA converges

f .x; y/ dA converges:
In this case any iterations will converge to the same value. Such double integrals are
called absolutely convergent by analogy with absolutely convergent inﬁnite series.
A Mean-Value Theorem for Double Integrals
Let D be a set in the xy-plane that is closed and bounded and has positive area A D

D dA. Suppose that f .x; y/ is continuous on D. Then there exist points .x1; y1/
and .x2; y2/ in D where f assumes minimum and maximum values (see Theorem 2
of Section 13.1); that is,
f .x1; y1/  f .x; y/  f .x2; y2/
for all points .x; y/ in D. If we integrate this inequality over D, we obtain

A set D in the plane is said to be connected if any two points in it can be joined by
a continuous parametric curve x D x.t/, y D y.t/, .0  t  1/, lying in D. Suppose
this curve joins .x1; y1/ (where t D 0) and .x2; y2/ (where t D 1). Let g.t/ satisfy

Then g is continuous and takes the values f .x1; y1/ at t D 0 and f .x2; y2/ at t D 1.
By the Intermediate-Value Theorem there exists a number t0 between 0 and 1 such that
Nf D g.t0/ D f .x0; y0/, where x0 D x.t0/ and y0 D y.t0/. Thus, we have found a

Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates
For many applications of double integrals, either the domain of integration, the inte-
grand function, or both may be more easily expressed in terms of polar coordinates
than in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Recall that a point P with Cartesian coordi-
nates .x; y/ can also be located by its polar coordinates Œr; , where r is the distance
from P to the origin O; and  is the angle OP makes with the positive direction of the
x-axis. (Positive angles  are measured counterclockwise.) The polar and Cartesian
coordinates of P are related by the transformations (see Figure 14.24)

In the Cartesian formula for V; the area element dA D dx dy represents the area
of the “inﬁnitesimal” region bounded by the coordinate lines at x, x C dx, y, and
y C dy. (See Figure 14.25(a).) In the polar formula, the area element dA should rep-
resent the area of the “inﬁnitesimal” region bounded by the coordinate circles with
radii r and r C dr, and coordinate rays from the origin at angles  and  C d. (See
Figure 14.25(b).) Observe that dA is approximately the area of a rectangle with dimen-
sions dr and r d. The error in this approximation becomes negligible compared with
the size of dA as dr and d approach zero. Thus, in transforming a double integral
between Cartesian and polar coordinates, the area element transforms according to the
formula
dx dy D dA D r dr d:
In order to iterate the polar form of the double integral for V considered above, we
can regard the domain of integration as a set in a plane having Cartesian coordinates r
and . In the xy Cartesian plane the domain is a disk r  1 (see Figure 14.26), but in
the r Cartesian plane (with perpendicular r- and -axes) the domain is the rectangle
R speciﬁed by 0  r  1 and 0    2. (See Figure 14.27.) The area element
in the r-plane is dA D dr d, so area is not preserved under the transformation to

A standard area problem for

There is no ﬁrm rule as to whether one should or should not convert a double integral
from Cartesian to polar coordinates. In Example 1 above, the conversion was strongly
suggested by the shape of the domain but was also indicated by the fact that the inte-
grand, y2=x2, becomes a function of  alone when converted to polar coordinates. It
is usually wise to switch to polar coordinates if the switch simpliﬁes the iteration (i.e.,
if the domain is “simpler” when expressed in terms of polar coordinates), even if the
form of the integrand is made more complicated.

on what symbol we use for the variable of integration. Therefore, we can express the
square of the integral as a product of two identical integrals but with their variables
of integration named differently. We then interpret this product as an improper double

if we complete the square in the y terms. Thus, it is a vertical circular cylinder of

Change of Variables in Double Integrals
The transformation of a double integral to polar coordinates is just a special case of
a general change of variables formula for double integrals. Suppose that x and y are
expressed as functions of two other variables u and v by the equations
x D x.u; v/
y D y.u; v/:
We regard these equations as deﬁning a transformation (or mapping) from points
.u; v/ in a uv-Cartesian plane to points .x; y/ in the xy-plane. (See Figure 14.32.) We
say that the transformation is one-to-one from the set S in the uv-plane onto the set D
in the xy-plane provided:

CHAPTER 14
Multiple Integration
(i) every point in S gets mapped to a point in D,
(ii) every point in D is the image of a point in S, and
(iii) different points in S get mapped to different points in D.
If the transformation is one-to-one, the deﬁning equations can be solved for u and v as
functions of x and y, and the resulting inverse transformation,
u D u.x; y/
v D v.x; y/;
is one-to-one from D onto S.
Let us assume that the functions x.u; v/ and y.u; v/ have continuous ﬁrst partial
derivatives and that the Jacobian determinant
@.x; y/
@.u; v/ ¤ 0
at
.u; v/:
As noted in Section 12.8, the Implicit Function Theorem implies that the transforma-
tion is one-to-one near .u; v/ and the inverse transformation also has continuous ﬁrst
partial derivatives and nonzero Jacobian satisfying

Near any point except the origin (where r D 0) the transformation is one-to-one. (In
fact, it is one-to-one from any set in the r-plane that does not contain more than one
point where r D 0 and lies in, say, the strip 0   < 2.)
A one-to-one transformation can be used to transform the double integral
ZZ
D
f .x; y/ dA
to a double integral over the corresponding set S in the uv-plane. Under the trans-
formation, the integrand f .x; y/ becomes g.u; v/ D f

x.u; v/; y.u; v/

. We must
discover how to express the area element dA D dx dy in terms of the area element
du dv in the uv-plane.
If the value of u is ﬁxed, say u D c, the equations
x D x.c; v/
and
y D y.c; v/
deﬁne a parametric curve (with v as parameter) in the xy-plane. This curve is called a
u-curve corresponding to the value u D c. Similarly, for ﬁxed v D c the equations
x D x.u; c/
and
y D y.u; c/
deﬁne a parametric curve (with parameter u) called a v-curve. Consider the differ-
ential area element bounded by the u-curves corresponding to nearby values u and
u C du and the v-curves corresponding to nearby values v and v C dv. Since these
curves are smooth, for small values of du and dv the area element is approximately a
parallelogram, and its area is approximately

where P , Q, and R are the points shown in Figure 14.33. The error in this approxima-

Remark
It is not necessary that S or D be closed or that the transformation be one-
to-one on the boundary of S. The transformation to polar coordinates maps the rect-
angle 0 < r < 1, 0   < 2 one-to-one onto the punctured disk 0 < x2 C y2 < 1
and, as in the ﬁrst example in this section, we can transform an integral over the closed
disk x2 C y2  1 to one over the closed rectangle 0  r  1, 0    2.

It is often tempting to try to use the change of variable formula to transform the domain
of a double integral into a rectangle so that iteration will be easy. As the following
example shows, this usually involves deﬁning the inverse transformation (u and v in
terms of x and y). Remember that inverse transformations have reciprocal Jacobians.

Solution
Since x D 4u  4u2 D 1  .1  2u/2, the minimum value of x on the
interval 0  u  1 is 0 (at u D 0 and u D 1), and the maximum value is 1 (at u D 1

Therefore, x D 4u  4u2 maps the interval 0  u  1 onto the interval 0  x  1.

Triple Integrals
Now that we have seen how to extend deﬁnite integration to two-dimensional domains,
the extension to three (or more) dimensions is straightforward. For a bounded function
f .x; y; z/ deﬁned on a rectangular box B (x0  x  x1, y0  y  y1, z0  z  z1),
the triple integral of f over B,
Again, we remark that triple and
other multiple integrals are often
represented with a single integral
sign, for example,

or

f .x; y; z/ dx dy dz;
can be deﬁned as a suitable limit of Riemann sums corresponding to partitions of B
into subboxes by planes parallel to each of the coordinate planes. We omit the details.
Triple integrals over more general domains are deﬁned by extending the function to be
zero outside the domain and integrating over a rectangular box containing the domain.
All the properties of double integrals mentioned in Section 14.1 have analogues
for triple integrals. In particular, a continuous function is integrable over a closed,
bounded domain. If f .x; y; z/ D 1 on the domain D, then the triple integral gives the

The triple integral of a positive function f .x; y; z/ can be interpreted as the “hyper-
volume” (i.e., the four-dimensional volume) of a region in 4-space having the set D as
its three-dimensional “base” and having its top on the hypersurface w D f .x; y; z/.
This is not a particularly useful interpretation; many more useful ones arise in appli-
cations. For instance, if .x; y; z/ represents the density (mass per unit volume) at
position .x; y; z/ in a substance occupying the domain D in 3-space, then the mass
m of the solid is the “sum” of mass elements dm D .x; y; z/ dV occupying volume

x2Cy2Cz2a2.2 C x  sin z/ dV:
Solution
The domain of integration is the ball of radius a centred at the origin. The
integral of 2 over this ball is twice the ball’s volume, that is, 8a3=3. The integrals
of x and sin z over the ball are both zero, since both functions are odd in one of the
variables and the domain is symmetric about each coordinate plane. (For instance, for
every volume element dV in the half of the ball where x > 0, there is a correspond-
ing element in the other half where x has the same size but the opposite sign. The
contributions from these two elements cancel one another.) Thus,

Most triple integrals are evaluated by an iteration procedure similar to that used for
double integrals. We slice the domain D with a plane parallel to one of the coordinate
planes, double integrate the function with respect to two variables over that slice, and
then integrate the result with respect to the remaining variable. Some examples should
clarify the procedure.

As indicated in Figure 14.42(a), we will slice with planes perpendicular to

so the double integrals over them can be immediately iterated also. We do it with the
y integral outer and the x integral inner, as suggested by the line shown in the slice.

Solution
The tetrahedron is shown in Figure 14.42(b). The plane slice in the plane
normal to the x-axis at position x is the triangle T .x/ shown in that ﬁgure; x is constant
and y and z are variables in the slice. The double integral of y over T .x/ is a function
of x. We evaluate it by integrating ﬁrst in the z direction and then in the y direction as
suggested by the vertical line shown in the slice:

In the above solution we carried out the iteration in two steps in order to show the

CHAPTER 14
Multiple Integration
The evaluation proceeds as above, starting with the right (i.e., inner) integral, followed
by the middle integral and then the left (outer) integral. The triple integral represents
the “sum” of elements y dV over the three-dimensional region T: The above iteration
corresponds to “summing” (i.e., integrating) ﬁrst along a vertical line (the z integral),
then summing these one-dimensional sums in the y direction to get the double sum
of all elements in the plane slice, and ﬁnally summing these double sums in the x
direction to add up the contributions from all the slices. The iteration can be carried out
in other directions; there are six possible iterations corresponding to different orders
of doing the x, y, and z integrals. The other ﬁve are

You should verify these by drawing diagrams analogous to Figure 14.42(b). Of course,
all six iterations give the same result.
It is sometimes difﬁcult to visualize the region of 3-space over which a given triple
integral is taken. In such situations try to determine the projection of that region on
one or other of the coordinate planes. For instance, if a region R is bounded by two
surfaces with given equations, combining these equations to eliminate one variable
will yield the equation of a cylinder (not necessarily circular) with axis parallel to the
axis of the eliminated variable. This cylinder will then determine the projection of R
onto the coordinate plane perpendicular to that axis. The following example illustrates
the use of this technique to ﬁnd a volume bounded by two surfaces. The volume is
expressed as a triple integral with unit integrand.
EXAMPLE 4
Find the volume of the region R lying below the plane z D 3 2y
and above the paraboloid z D x2 C y2.
Solution
The region R is shown in Figure 14.43. The two surfaces bounding R in-
tersect on the vertical cylinder x2 C y2 D 3  2y, or x2 C .y C 1/2 D 4. If D is the
circular disk in which this cylinder intersects the xy-plane, then partial iteration gives

but there is an easier way to iterate the double integral. Since D is a circular disk of
radius 2 and centre .0; 1/, we can use polar coordinates with centre at that point (i.e.,

As was the case for double integrals, it is sometimes necessary to reiterate a given
iterated integral so that the integrations are performed in a different order. This task
is most easily accomplished if we can translate the given iteration into a sketch of the
region of integration. The ability to deduce the shape of the region from the limits in
the iterated integral is a skill that you can acquire with a little practice. You should ﬁrst
determine the projection of the region on a coordinate plane, namely, the plane of the
two variables in the outer integrals of the given iteration.
It is also possible to reiterate an iterated integral in a different order by manipulat-
ing the limits of integration algebraically. We will illustrate both approaches (graphical
and algebraic) in the following examples.
EXAMPLE 5
Express the iterated integral
I D

as a triple integral, and sketch the region over which it is taken. Reiterate the integral
in such a way that the integrations are performed in the following order: ﬁrst y, then
z, then x (i.e., the opposite order to the given iteration).
Solution
We express I as an uniterated triple integral:
I D
ZZZ
R
f .x; y; z/ dV:
The outer integral in the given iteration shows that the region R lies between the planes
y D 0 and y D 1. For each such value of y, z must lie between y and 1. Therefore,
R lies below the plane z D 1 and above the plane z D y, and the projection of R onto
the yz-plane is the triangle with vertices .0; 0; 0/, .0; 0; 1/, and .0; 1; 1/. Through any
point .0; y; z/ in this triangle, a line parallel to the x-axis intersects R between x D 0
and x D z. Thus, the solid is bounded by the ﬁve planes x D 0, y D 0, z D 1, y D z,
and z D x. It is sketched in Figure 14.44(a), with slice and line corresponding to the
given iteration.

with the order of integrations reversed.
Solution
From the given iteration we can write three sets of inequalities satisﬁed by
the outer variable x, the middle variable y, and the inner variable z. We write these in
order as follows:
0  x  1
inequalities for x
x  y  1
inequalities for y
x  z  y
inequalities for z.
Note that the limits for each variable can be constant or can depend only on variables
whose inequalities are on lines above the line for that variable. (In this case, the limits
for x must both be constant, those for y can depend on x, and those for z can depend
on both x and y.) This is a requirement for iterated integrals; outer integrals cannot
depend on the variables of integration of the inner integrals.
We want to construct an equivalent set of inequalities with those for z on the top
line, then those for y, then those for x on the bottom line. The limits for z must be
constants. From the inequalities above we determine that 0  x  z and z  y  1.
Thus, z must satisfy 0  z  1. The inequalities for y can depend on z. Since z  y
and y  1, we have z  y  1. Finally, the limits for x can depend on both y and z.
We have 0  x, x  y, and x  z. Since we have already determined that z  y, we
must have 0  x  z. Thus, the revised inequalities are
0  z  1
inequalities for z
z  y  1
inequalities for y
0  x  z
inequalities for x

CHAPTER 14
Multiple Integration
Spherical coordinates are suited to problems involving spherical symmetry and, in
particular, to regions bounded by spheres centred at the origin, circular cones with
axes along the z-axis, and vertical planes containing the z-axis.
EXAMPLE 4
A solid half-ball H of radius a has density  (mass per unit vol-
ume) depending on the distance R from the centre of the base disk.
The density is given by  D k.2a  R/, where k is a constant. Find the mass of the
half-ball.
Solution
Choosing coordinates with origin at the centre of the base, so that the half-
ball lies above the xy-plane, we calculate the mass m as follows:

In the above example, both the integrand and the region of integration ex-

The choice of coordinate system can greatly affect the difﬁculty of computation of a
multiple integral.
Many problems will have elements of spherical and axial symmetry. In such cases
it may not be clear whether it would be better to use spherical or cylindrical coordi-
nates. In such doubtful cases the integrand is usually the best guide. Use cylindri-
cal or spherical coordinates according to whether the integrand involves x2 C y2 or
x2 C y2 C z2.

Applications of Multiple Integrals
When we express the volume V of a region R in 3-space as an integral,
V D
ZZZ
R
dV;
we are regarding V as a “sum” of inﬁnitely many inﬁnitesimal elements of volume, that
is, as the limit of the sum of volumes of smaller and smaller nonoverlapping subregions
into which we subdivide R. This idea of representing sums of inﬁnitesimal elements
of quantities by integrals has many applications.
For example, if a rigid body of constant density  g/cm3 occupies a volume V cm3,
then its mass is m D V g. If the density is not constant but varies continuously over
the region R of 3-space occupied by the rigid body, say  D .x; y; z/, we can still
regard the density as being constant on an inﬁnitesimal element of R having volume
dV: The mass of this element is therefore dm D .x; y; z/ dV; and the mass of the
whole body is calculated by integrating these mass elements over R:
m D
ZZZ
R
.x; y; z/ dV:
Similar formulas apply when the rigid body is one- or two-dimensional, and its density
is given in units of mass per unit length or per unit area. In such cases single or double
integrals are needed to sum the individual elements of mass. All this works because
mass is “additive”; that is, the mass of a composite object is the sum of the masses of
the parts that compose the object. The surface areas, gravitational forces, moments,
and energies we consider in this section all have this additivity property.
The Surface Area of a Graph
We can use a double integral over a domain D in the xy-plane to add up surface
area elements and thereby calculate the total area of the surface S with equation

CHAPTER 14
Multiple Integration
The Gravitational Attraction of a Disk
Newton’s universal law of gravitation asserts that two point masses m1 and m2, sepa-
rated by a distance s, attract one another with a force
F D km1m2
s2
;
k being a universal constant. The force on each mass is directed toward the other, along
the line joining the two masses. Suppose that a ﬂat disk D of radius a, occupying the
region x2 C y2  a2 of the xy-plane, has constant areal density  (units of mass
per unit area). Let us calculate the total force of attraction that this disk exerts upon a
mass m located at the point .0; 0; b/ on the positive z-axis. The total force is a vector
quantity. Although the various mass elements on the disk are in different directions
from the mass m, symmetry indicates that the net force will be in the direction toward
the centre of the disk, that is, toward the origin. Thus, the total force will be F k,
where F is the magnitude of the force.
We will calculate F by integrating the vertical component dF of the force of
attraction on m due to the mass  dA in an area element dA on the disk. If the area
element is at the point with polar coordinates Œr; , and if the line from this point to
.0; 0; b/ makes angle  with the z-axis as shown in Figure 14.55, then the vertical
component of the force of attraction of the mass element  dA on m is

reason on physical grounds why this should be so.

859
Remark
The force of attraction on a point mass due to suitably symmetric solid
objects (such as balls, cylinders, and cones) having constant density  (units of mass
per unit volume) can be found by integrating elements of force contributed by thin,
disk-shaped slices of the solid. See Exercises 14–17.
Moments and Centres of Mass
The centre of mass of a rigid body is that point (ﬁxed in the body) at which the body
can be supported so that in the presence of a constant gravitational ﬁeld it will not
experience any unbalanced torques that will cause it to rotate. The torques experienced
by a mass element dm in the body can be expressed in terms of the moments of dm
about the three coordinate planes. If the body occupies a region R in 3-space and has
continuous volume density .x; y; z/, then the mass element dm D .x; y; z/ dV that
occupies the volume element dV is said to have moments .x  x0/ dm, .y  y0/ dm,
and .z  z0/ dm about the planes x D x0, y D y0, and z D z0, respectively. Thus,
the total moments of the body about these three planes are

centre of mass NP D . Nx; Ny; Nz/ of the body is that point for which MxD Nx, MyD Ny, and
MzDNz are all equal to zero. Thus,
Centre of mass
The centre of mass of a solid occupying region R of 3-space and having

Remark
Similar expressions hold for distributions of mass over regions in the plane
or over intervals on a line. We use the appropriate areal or line densities and double or
single deﬁnite integrals.
Remark
If the density is constant, it cancels out of the expressions for the centre of
mass. In this case the centre of mass is a geometric property of the region R and is
called the centroid or centre of gravity of that region.

The density is assumed to be constant, so we may take it to be unity. The

Moment of Inertia
The kinetic energy of a particle of mass m moving with speed v is
KE D 1
2 mv2:
The mass of the particle measures its inertia, which is twice the energy it has when its
speed is one unit.
If the particle is moving in a circle of radius D, its motion can be described in
terms of its angular speed, , measured in radians per unit time. In one revolution
the particle travels a distance 2D in time 2=. Thus, its (translational) speed v is
related to its angular speed by
v D D:
Suppose that a rigid body is rotating with angular speed  about an axis L. If (at some
instant) the body occupies a region R and has density  D .x; y; z/, then each mass
element dm D  dV in the body has kinetic energy
dKE D 1
2 v2 dm D 1

I is called the moment of inertia of the rotating body about the axis L. The moment
of inertia plays the same role in the expression for kinetic energy of rotation (in terms
of angular speed) that the mass does in the expression for kinetic energy of translation
(in terms of linear speed). The moment of inertia is twice the kinetic energy of the
body when it is rotating with unit angular speed.
If the entire mass of the rotating body were concentrated at a distance D0 from the
axis of rotation, then its kinetic energy would be 1

easy to imagine the need for multiple integrations beyond just triple integrals. For
instance, in physics we must consider both position and momentum of a particle to
understand its behaviour. Each of these requires three coordinates, so a total of six
coordinates are needed. Integrals may have to be taken over all six.
Suppose we know that the number of particles per unit interval in three space coor-
dinates, x1; x2; x3, and per unit momentum in three momentum coordinates p1; p2; p3,
is N.x1; x2; x3; p1; p2; p3/. If the energy, 
.p1; p2; p3/, per particle is deﬁned by its
momentum, then the total energy of the system of particles is given by the repeated
integral

where the domain of integration is over the entire six-dimensional space. Clearly, this
notation is a bit clumsy.
Of course, we don’t stop with six dimensions. The numbers of integrations can be
arbitrarily large. In kinetic theory, for example, one may imagine spaces where there
are six coordinates for every particle. If the number of particles is typically very large
(e.g., 1023), integrals over that space might involve 6  1023 integrations. Clearly,
writing an integration sign for each coordinate is not just clumsy—it is impossible and
pointless in such cases.
One alternative is to represent the integral of function f .x/ D f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/
over a domain D in n-dimensional space as

where the space and domain of the integration are simply described in the surrounding
text. This is the common approach for all types of integrals in advanced texts. However,
for introductory material with three or fewer iterations of integration, it remains helpful
to denote numbers of integrations involved symbolically.

A rigid pendulum of mass m swings about point A on a

Introduction
This chapter and the next are concerned mainly with
vector-valued functions of a vector variable, typically
functions whose domains and ranges lie in the plane or in 3-space. Such functions
are frequently called vector ﬁelds. Applications of vector ﬁelds often involve integrals
taken not along axes or over regions in the plane or 3-space, but rather over curves
and surfaces. We will introduce such line and surface integrals in this chapter. The
next chapter will be devoted to developing versions of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus for integrals of vector ﬁelds.
15.1
Vector and Scalar Fields
A function whose domain and range are subsets of Euclidean 3-space, R3, is called
a vector ﬁeld. Thus, a vector ﬁeld F associates a vector F.x; y; z/ with each point
.x; y; z/ in its domain. The three components of F are scalar-valued (real-valued)
functions F1.x; y; z/, F2.x; y; z/, and F3.x; y; z/, and F.x; y; z/ can be expressed in
terms of the standard basis in R3 as
F.x; y; z/ D F1.x; y; z/i C F2.x; y; z/j C F3.x; y; z/k:
(Note that the subscripts here represent components of a vector, not partial derivatives.)
If F3.x; y; z/ D 0 and F1 and F2 are independent of z, then F reduces to
F.x; y/ D F1.x; y/i C F2.x; y/j
and so is called a plane vector ﬁeld, or a vector ﬁeld in the xy-plane. We will fre-
quently make use of position vectors in the arguments of vector ﬁelds. The position
vector of .x; y; z/ is r D xi C yj C zk, and we can write F.r/ as a shorthand for
F.x; y; z/. In the context of discussion of vector ﬁelds, a scalar-valued function of a
vector variable (i.e., a function of several real variables as considered in the context of
Chapters 12–14) is frequently called a scalar ﬁeld. Thus, the components of a vector
ﬁeld are scalar ﬁelds.
Many of the results we prove about vector ﬁelds require that the ﬁeld be smooth
in some sense. We will call a vector ﬁeld smooth wherever its component scalar ﬁelds
have continuous partial derivatives of all orders. (For most purposes, however, second
order would be sufﬁcient.)

868
CHAPTER 15
Vector Fields
Vector ﬁelds arise in many situations in applied mathematics. Let us list some:
(a) The gravitational ﬁeld F.x; y; z/ due to some object is the force of attraction that
the object exerts on a unit mass located at position .x; y; z/.
(b) The electrostatic force ﬁeld E.x; y; z/ due to an electrically charged object is the
electrical force that the object exerts on a unit charge at position .x; y; z/. (The
force may be either an attraction or a repulsion.)
(c) The velocity ﬁeld v.x; y; z/ in a moving ﬂuid (or solid) is the velocity of motion
of the particle at position .x; y; z/. If the motion is not “steady state,” then the
velocity ﬁeld will also depend on time: v D v.x; y; z; t/.
(d) The gradient rf .x; y; z/ of any scalar ﬁeld f gives the direction and magnitude
of the greatest rate of increase of f at .x; y; z/. In particular, a temperature gradi-
ent, rT .x; y; z/, is a vector ﬁeld giving the direction and magnitude of the great-
est rate of increase of temperature T at the point .x; y; z/ in a heat-conducting
medium. Pressure gradients provide similar information about the variation of
pressure in a ﬂuid such as an air mass or an ocean.
(e) The unit radial and unit transverse vectors Or and O are examples of vector ﬁelds in
the xy-plane. Both are deﬁned at all points of the plane except the origin.
EXAMPLE 1
(The gravitational ﬁeld of a point mass) The gravitational force
ﬁeld due to a point mass m located at point P0 having position
vector r0 is
F.x; y; z/ D F.r/ D
km
jr  r0j3 .r  r0/
D km

3=2 ;
where k > 0 is a constant. F points toward the point r0 and has magnitude
jFj D km=jr  r0j2:
Some vectors in a plane section of the ﬁeld are shown graphically in Figure 15.1. Each
represents the value of the ﬁeld at the position of its tail. The lengths of the vectors
indicate that the strength of the force increases the closer you get to P0. However,
the vectors have a schematic meaning relative to each other; they do not imply actual
distances in the plane.

Remark
The electrostatic ﬁeld F due to a point charge q at P0 is given by the same
formula as the gravitational ﬁeld above, except with m replaced by q. The reason
for the opposite sign is that like charges repel each other whereas masses attract each
other.
EXAMPLE 2
The velocity ﬁeld of a solid rotating about the z-axis with angular
velocity  D k is
v.x; y; z/ D v.r/ D   r D yi C xj:
Being the same in all planes normal to the z-axis, v can be regarded as a plane vector
ﬁeld. Some vectors of the ﬁeld are shown in Figure 15.2.
Field Lines (Integral Curves, Trajectories, Streamlines)
The graphical representations of vector ﬁelds such as those shown in Figures 15.1 and
15.2 and the wind velocity ﬁeld over a hill shown in Figure 15.3 suggest a pattern of
motion through space or in the plane. Whether or not the ﬁeld is a velocity ﬁeld, we
can interpret it as such and ask what path will be followed by a corresponding particle,
initially at some point, whose velocity is given by the ﬁeld. The path will be a curve
to which the ﬁeld is tangent at every point. Such curves are called ﬁeld lines, integral
curves, or trajectories for the given vector ﬁeld. In the speciﬁc case where the vector
ﬁeld gives the velocity in a ﬂuid ﬂow, the ﬁeld lines are also called streamlines or ﬂow
lines of the ﬂow; some of these are shown for the air ﬂow in Figure 15.3. For a force
ﬁeld, the ﬁeld lines are called lines of force.
Figure 15.3
The velocity ﬁeld and some
streamlines of wind blowing over a hill
The ﬁeld lines of F do not depend on the magnitude of F at any point but only on
the direction of the ﬁeld. If the ﬁeld line through some point has parametric equation
r D r.t/, then its tangent vector dr=dt must be parallel to F.r.t// for all t. Thus,
dr
dt D .t/F

r.t/

:
For some vector ﬁelds, this differential equation can be integrated to ﬁnd the ﬁeld lines.
If we break the equation into components,
dx
dt D .t/F1.x; y; z/;
dy
dt D .t/F2.x; y; z/;
dz
dt D .t/F3.x; y; z/;
we can obtain equivalent differential expressions for .t/ dt and hence write the dif-
ferential equation for the ﬁeld lines in the form
dx
F1.x; y; z/ D
dy
F2.x; y; z/ D
dz
F3.x; y; z/:

870
CHAPTER 15
Vector Fields
If multiplication of these differential equations by some function puts them in the form
P.x/ dx D Q.y/ dy D R.z/ dz;
then we can integrate all three expressions to ﬁnd the ﬁeld lines.

or, on taking exponentials,
C1.x  x0/ D C2.y  y0/ D C3.z  z0/:
This represents two families of planes all passing through P0 D .x0; y0; z0/. The ﬁeld
lines are the intersections of planes from each of the families, so they are straight lines
through the point P0. (This is a two-parameter family of lines; any one of the constants
Ci that is nonzero can be divided out of the equations above.) The nature of the ﬁeld
lines should also be apparent from the plot of the vector ﬁeld in Figure 15.1.
EXAMPLE 4
Find the ﬁeld lines of the velocity ﬁeld v D .yi C xj/ of
Example 2.
Solution
The ﬁeld lines satisfy the differential equation
dx
y D dy
x :
We can separate variables in this equation to get x dx D y dy. Integration then gives
x2=2 D y2=2 C C=2, or x2 C y2 D C. Thus, the ﬁeld lines are circles centred at
the origin in the xy-plane, as is also apparent from the vector ﬁeld plot in Figure 15.2.
If we regard v as a vector ﬁeld in 3-space, we ﬁnd that the ﬁeld lines are horizontal
circles centred on the z-axis:
x2 C y2 D C1;
z D C2:
Our ability to ﬁnd ﬁeld lines depends on our ability to solve differential equations and,
in 3-space, systems of differential equations.

Solution

The ﬁeld lines are the curves of intersection of the two families y D x2 C C1 and
y D z2 C C2 of parabolic cylinders.

Vector Fields in Polar Coordinates
A vector ﬁeld in the plane can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates in the form
F D F.r; / D Fr.r; /Or C F.r; / O;
where Or and O, deﬁned everywhere except at the origin by
Or D
cos i C sin j
O D  sin i C cos j;
are unit vectors in the direction of increasing r and  at Œr; . Note that d Or=d D O
and that O is just Or rotated 90ı counterclockwise. Also note that we are using Fr and
F to denote the components of F with respect to the basis fOr; Og; the subscripts do
not indicate partial derivatives. Here, Fr.r; / is called the radial component of F, and
F.r; / is called the transverse component.
A curve with polar equation r D r./ can be expressed in vector parametric form,
r D rOr;
as we did in Section 11.6. This curve is a ﬁeld line of F if its differential tangent vector
dr D dr Or C r d Or

is parallel to the ﬁeld vector F.r; / at any point except the origin, that is, if r D f ./
satisﬁes the differential equation

F.r; /:
In speciﬁc cases we can ﬁnd the ﬁeld lines by solving this equation.
EXAMPLE 6
Sketch the vector ﬁeld F.r; / D Or C O, and ﬁnd its ﬁeld lines.
Sketch several ﬁeld lines.
Solution
At each point Œr; , the ﬁeld vector bisects the angle between Or and O,
making a counterclockwise angle of 45ı with Or. All of the vectors in the ﬁeld have
the same length,
p
2. Some of them are shown in Figure 15.4(a). They suggest that
the ﬁeld lines will spiral outward from the origin. Since Fr.r; / D F.r; / D 1
for this ﬁeld, the ﬁeld lines satisfy dr D r d, or, dividing by d, dr=d D r.
This is the differential equation of exponential growth and has solution r D Ke, or,
equivalently, r D eC˛, where ˛ D ln K is a constant. Several such curves are shown
in Figure 15.4(b).

Nonlinear Systems and Liapunov Functions
Many differential equations that arise in applications are nonlinear and cannot easily be
solved. However, such an equation can sometimes be associated with a vector ﬁeld in
such a way that useful information about the behaviour of solutions of the differential
equation can be obtained by examining the vector ﬁeld.
An example is the Van der Pol equation x00.1x2/x0Cx D 0, which arises in
connection with electrical circuits, where the independent variable on which x depends
is time. If we take the constant  D 1, this equation can be rewritten as a ﬁrst-order
system of equations by substituting x0 D y. The ﬁrst-order system is
(
x0 D y
y0 D x C y.x2  1/;
and is associated with the vector ﬁeld
F D x0 i C y0 j D y i C

.x C y.x2  1/

j:
We examine what the structure of this ﬁeld implies about the solutions .x; y/ of the
linear system and hence about the Van der Pol equation.
One deﬁnitive property that ﬁelds and their associated trajectories have is the lo-
cation and nature of “ﬁxed points,” which are the zeros of the vector ﬁeld, or crit-
ical points of the ﬁrst-order system. Since the “velocity” F.x; y/ D 0 D 0i C 0j
there, movement along trajectories must stop at those points. Fixed points provide
important insight into the solutions of differential equations and their visualization,
helping us to have conﬁdence in approximate solution methods. A key property of a
ﬁxed point is whether it is stable or not. Generally speaking, stability of a ﬁxed point
means that all trajectories near a ﬁxed point trap any “particle” travelling on them so
that it remains near the ﬁxed point (weak stability), or, more stringently, so that it
approaches the ﬁxed point (asymptotic stability). For the case of the Van der Pol
equation, .x; y/ D .0; 0/ is clearly a ﬁxed point.
Can we determine whether the ﬁxed points of ﬁelds are stable or not, without solv-
ing the differential equations, and without resorting to approximate methods such as
those used with computers? One powerful method for doing so is to use a Liapunov
function in conjunction with the vector ﬁeld. A Liapunov function is a positive func-
tion V.x; y/ that is decreasing toward the ﬁxed point and that vanishes at the ﬁxed
point. One can always deﬁne many such functions for any point, but a Liapunov func-
tion must not only decrease, but must decrease along every trajectory of the vector ﬁeld
approaching the ﬁxed point. Thus, for weak stability, we require dV=dt D rV F  0
near the ﬁxed point, and for asymptotic stability, we require dV=dt < 0 near the ﬁxed
point. Since rV is an outward normal to level curves of V that surround the ﬁxed
point, it follows for asymptotic stability that F points inward, across level curves of
the Liapunov function, and thus “particles” moving along its trajectories get trapped in
successively smaller domains surrounding the ﬁxed point as t increases. Clearly, if the
derivative is positive instead of negative, the ﬁxed point is certainly unstable.
The mere existence of a Liapunov function with a negative derivative along tra-
jectories of a vector ﬁeld conﬁrms stability of a ﬁxed point. The entire test depends
on a matter of existence. If a Liapunov function is not found, this does not prove or
disprove stability.
EXAMPLE 7
(A Liapunov function for a Van der Pol equation) Show that
the point .0; 0/ is an asymptotically stable ﬁxed point of the Van
der Pol vector ﬁeld (case  D 1) given above.
Solution
Substituting .x; y/ D .0; 0/ into the vector ﬁeld expressions of the Van der
Pol equation yields F D x0i C y0j D yi C .x C y.x2  1//j D 0i C 0j D 0, which
conﬁrms that .0; 0/ is a ﬁxed point.

SECTION 15.1:

873
Note that a poor guess at a Liapunov function would be V.x; y/ D 2x2 C y2.
While it is positive and vanishes at .0; 0/, it fails to meet the requirement that its time
derivative is always negative near .0; 0/: for instance, at points .2y; y/ arbitrarily close
to .0; 0/, we have
dV

x C y.x2  1/

D 2y2.x2  1/  0
whenever x2 < 1. This shows that the ﬁxed point .0; 0/ is at least weakly stable, but it
does not imply asymptotic stability because dV=dt D 0 if y D 0.
We could try something more general, like V.x; y/ D ax2 C bxy C cy2 and
attempt to choose the values of a > 0, c > 0, and b satisfying b2 < 4ac (why?) so
that whenever .x; y/ is sufﬁciently close (but not equal) to .0; 0/, we have dV=dt < 0.
It turns out that we can make V.x; y/ D x2 C xy C y2 work. For this V; we have

22. Consider the vector ﬁeld of the Van der Pol equation when
 D 0. Use the Liapunov function, V.x; y/ D x2 C y2, to
attempt to determine the stability of the ﬁxed point (0,0).
Explain the result.
23. In Example 7, using the simpler Liapunov function,
V.x; y/ D x2 C y2, we found V 0 D 2y2.x2  1/  0. This
was not sufﬁcient to establish asymptotic stability in itself
because V 0 D 0 occurs when y D 0. Zeros of V 0 form a
curve, in this case given by the entire x-axis, which all occur
when x0 D 0. Curves deﬁned by one component of the vector
ﬁeld vanishing are known as nullclines. The zeros of V 0 occur
on one nullcline (i.e., y D 0). Write an expression for another
nullcline of the Van der Pol vector ﬁeld of Example 7.

that the simpler Liapunov function in the previous exercise is
given by V D r2 in polar coordinates. Show explicitly that all

15.2
Conservative Fields
Since the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld is a vector ﬁeld, it is natural to ask whether every
vector ﬁeld is the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld. Given a vector ﬁeld F.x; y; z/, does there
exist a scalar ﬁeld .x; y; z/ such that
F.x; y; z/ D r.x; y; z/ D @
@x i C @
@y j C @
@z k ‹
The answer in general is “no.” Only special vector ﬁelds can be written in this way.
DEFINITION
1
If F.x; y; z/ D r.x; y; z/ in a domain D, then we say that F is a conser-
vative vector ﬁeld in D, and we call the function  a (scalar) potential for F
on D. Similar deﬁnitions hold in the plane or in n-space.
Like antiderivatives, potentials are not determined uniquely; arbitrary constants can be
added to them. Note that F is conservative in a domain D if and only if F D r at
every point of D; the potential  cannot have any singular points in D.
The equation F1.x; y; z/ dxCF2.x; y; z/ dyCF3.x; y; z/ dz D 0 is called an ex-
act differential equation if the left side is the differential of a scalar function .x; y; z/:
d D F1.x; y; z/ dx C F2.x; y; z/ dy C F3.x; y; z/ dz:
In this case the differential equation has solutions given by .x; y; z/ D C (constant).
(See Section 18.2 for a discussion of exact equations in the plane.) Observe that the
differential equation is exact if and only if the vector ﬁeld F D F1i C F2j C F3k is
conservative and that  is the potential of F.
Being scalar ﬁelds rather than vector ﬁelds, potentials for conservative vector
ﬁelds are easier to manipulate algebraically than the vector ﬁelds themselves. For
instance, a sum of potential functions is the potential function for the sum of the cor-
responding vector ﬁelds. A vector ﬁeld can always be computed from its potential
function by taking the gradient.
EXAMPLE 1
(The gravitational ﬁeld of a point mass is conservative) Show
that the gravitational ﬁeld F.r/ D km.r  r0/=jr  r0j3 of Ex-
ample 1 in Section 15.1 is conservative wherever it is deﬁned (i.e., everywhere in R3
except at r0), by showing that

and similar formulas hold for the other partial derivatives of the function . It follows
that r.x; y; z/ D F.x; y; z/ for .x; y; z/ ¤ .x0; y0; z0/, and F is conservative except
at r0.
Remark
It is not necessary to write the expression km=jr  r0j in terms of the com-
ponents of r  r0 as we did in Example 1 in order to calculate its partial derivatives.
Here is a useful formula for the derivative of the length of a vector function F with
respect to a variable x:

EXAMPLE 2
Show that the velocity ﬁeld v D yi C xj of rigid body rota-
tion about the z-axis (see Example 2 of Section 15.1) is not con-
servative if  ¤ 0.
Solution
There are two ways to show that no potential for v can exist. One way is to
try to ﬁnd a potential .x; y/ for the vector ﬁeld. We require
@
@x D y
and
@
@y D x:
The ﬁrst of these equations implies that .x; y/ D xy C C1.y/. (We have inte-
grated with respect to x; the constant can still depend on y.) Similarly, the second
equation implies that .x; y/ D xy C C2.x/. Therefore, we must have xy C
C1.y/ D xy CC2.x/, or 2xy D C1.y/C2.x/ for all .x; y/. This is not possible
for any choice of the single-variable functions C1.y/ and C2.x/ unless  D 0.

876
CHAPTER 15
Vector Fields
Alternatively, if v has a potential , then we can form the mixed partial derivatives
of  from the two equations above and get
@2
@y@x D 
and
@2
@x@y D :
This is not possible if  ¤ 0 because the smoothness of v implies that its potential
should be smooth, so the mixed partials should be equal. Thus, no such  can exist; v
is not conservative.
Example 2 suggests a condition that must be satisﬁed by any conservative plane vector
ﬁeld.
BEWARE!
Do not confuse this
necessary condition with a
sufﬁcient condition to guarantee
that F is conservative. We will show
later that more than just
@F1=@y D @F2=@x on D is
necessary to guarantee that F is
conservative on D.
Necessary condition for a conservative plane vector ﬁeld
If F.x; y/ D F1.x; y/i C F2.x; y/j is a conservative vector ﬁeld in a domain
D of the xy-plane, then the condition
@
@y F1.x; y/ D @
@x F2.x; y/
must be satisﬁed at all points of D.
To see this, observe that
F1i C F2j D F D r D @
@x i C @
@y j
implies the two scalar equations
F1 D @
@x
and
F2 D @
@y ;
and since the mixed partial derivatives of  should be equal,
@F1
@y D @2
@y@x D @2
@x@y D @F2
@x :
A similar condition can be obtained for vector ﬁelds in 3-space.
Necessary conditions for a conservative vector ﬁeld in 3-space
If F.x; y; z/ D F1.x; y; z/i C F2.x; y; z/j C F3.x; y; z/k is a conservative

Equipotential Surfaces and Curves
If .x; y; z/ is a potential function for the conservative vector ﬁeld F, then the level
surfaces .x; y; z/ D C of  are called equipotential surfaces of F. Since F D r
is normal to these surfaces (wherever it does not vanish), the ﬁeld lines of F always
intersect the equipotential surfaces at right angles. For instance, the equipotential sur-
faces of the gravitational force ﬁeld of a point mass are spheres centred at the point;
these spheres are normal to the ﬁeld lines, which are straight lines passing through the
point. Similarly, for a conservative plane vector ﬁeld, the level curves of the potential
function are called equipotential curves of the vector ﬁeld. They are the orthogonal
trajectories of the ﬁeld lines; that is, they intersect the ﬁeld lines at right angles.

intersect at right angles. (See Figure 15.5.) Note, however, that F does not specify a
direction at the origin and the orthogonality breaks down there; in fact, neither family
has a unique curve through that point.

In the above example we constructed the potential  by ﬁrst integrating

Remark
The existence of a potential for a vector ﬁeld depends on the topology of
the domain of the ﬁeld (i.e., whether the domain has holes in it and what kind of
holes) as well as on the structure of the components of the ﬁeld itself. (Even if the
necessary conditions given above are satisﬁed, a vector ﬁeld may not be conservative
in a domain that has holes.) We will be probing further into the nature of conservative
vector ﬁelds in Section 15.4 and in the next chapter; we will eventually show that the
above necessary conditions are also sufﬁcient to guarantee that F is conservative if the
domain of F satisﬁes certain conditions. At this point, however, we give an example
in which a plane vector ﬁeld fails to be conservative on a domain where the necessary
condition is, nevertheless, satisﬁed.

Thus, r D F holds everywhere in the plane, except at points .x; 0/ where x  0.
(c) Suppose that F is conservative on the whole plane excluding the origin. Then
F D r there, for some scalar function .x; y/. Then r.  / D 0 for 0 <
 < 2, and    D C (constant), or  D  C C. The left side of this equation
is discontinuous along the positive x-axis but the right side is not. Therefore, the
two sides cannot be equal. This contradiction shows that F cannot be conservative
on the whole plane, excluding the origin.
Remark
Observe that the origin .0; 0/ is a hole in the domain of F in the above
example. While F satisﬁes the necessary condition for being conservative everywhere
except at this hole, you must remove from the domain of F a half-line (ray), or, more
generally, a curve from the origin to inﬁnity in order to get a potential function for
F. F is not conservative on any domain containing a curve that surrounds the origin.
Exercises 22–24 of Section 15.4 will shed further light on this situation.
Sources, Sinks, and Dipoles
Imagine that 3-space is ﬁlled with an incompressible ﬂuid emitted by a point source
at the origin at a volume rate dV=dt D 4m. (We say that the origin is a source of
strength m.) By symmetry, the ﬂuid ﬂows outward on radial lines from the origin with
equal speed at equal distances from the origin in all directions, and the ﬂuid emitted at
the origin at some instant t D 0 will at later time t be spread over a spherical surface
of radius r D r.t/. All the ﬂuid inside that sphere was emitted in the time interval
Œ0; t, so we have
4
3 r3 D 4mt:
Differentiating this equation with respect to t we obtain r2.dr=dt/ D m, and the
outward speed of the ﬂuid at distance r from the origin is v.r/ D m=r2. The velocity
ﬁeld of the moving ﬂuid is therefore
v.r/ D v.r/ r
jrj D m
r3 r:
This velocity ﬁeld is conservative (except at the origin) and has potential
.r/ D m
r :
A sink is a negative source. A sink of strength m at the origin (which annihilates
or sucks up ﬂuid at a rate dV=dt D 4m) has velocity ﬁeld and potential given by
v.r/ D  m
r3 r
and
.r/ D m
r :
The potentials or velocity ﬁelds of sources or sinks located at other points are
obtained by translation of these formulas; for instance, the velocity ﬁeld of a source of
strength m at the point with position vector r0 is

This should be compared with the gravitational force ﬁeld due to a mass m at the
origin. The two are the same except for sign and a constant related to units of measure-
ment. For this reason we regard a point mass as a sink for its own gravitational ﬁeld.
Similarly, the electrostatic ﬁeld due to a point charge q at r0 is the ﬁeld of a source
(or sink if q < 0) of strength proportional to q; if units of measurement are suitably
chosen we have

In general, the ﬁeld lines of a vector ﬁeld converge at a source or sink of that ﬁeld.
A dipole is a system consisting of a source and a sink of equal strength m separated
by a short distance `. The product  D m` is called the dipole moment, and the line
containing the source and sink is called the axis of the dipole. Real physical dipoles,
such as magnets, are frequently modelled by ideal dipoles that are the limits of such
real dipoles as m ! 1 and ` ! 0 in such a way that the dipole moment  remains
constant.

Line Integrals
The deﬁnite integral,
R b
a f .x/ dx, represents the total amount of a quantity distributed
along the x-axis between a and b in terms of the line density, f .x/, of that quantity
at point x. The amount of the quantity in an inﬁnitesimal interval of length dx at x
is f .x/ dx, and the integral adds up these inﬁnitesimal contributions (or elements)
to give the total amount of the quantity. Similarly, the integrals
RR
D f .x; y/ dA and
RRR
R f .x; y; z/ dV represent the total amounts of quantities distributed over regions
D in the plane and R in 3-space in terms of the areal or volume densities of these
quantities.
It may happen that a quantity is distributed with speciﬁed line density along a
curve in the plane or in 3-space, or with speciﬁed areal density over a surface in
3-space. In such cases we require line integrals or surface integrals to add up the
contributing elements and calculate the total quantity. We examine line integrals in
this section and the next and surface integrals in Sections 15.5 and 15.6.
Let C be a bounded, continuous parametric curve in R3. Recall (from Section 11.1)
that C is a smooth curve if it has a parametrization of the form
r D r.t/ D x.t/i C y.t/j C z.t/k;
t in interval I;
with “velocity” vector v D dr=dt continuous and nonzero. We will call C a smooth
arc if it is a smooth curve with ﬁnite parameter interval I D Œa; b.
In Section 11.3 we saw how to calculate the length of C by subdividing it into short
arcs using points corresponding to parameter values
a D t0 < t1 < t2 <    < tn1 < tn D b;
adding up the lengths jrij D jri  ri1j of line segments joining these points, and
taking the limit as the maximum distance between adjacent points approached zero.
The length was denoted
Z
C
ds
and is a special example of a line integral along C having integrand 1.
The line integral of a general function f .x; y; z/ can be deﬁned similarly. We
choose a point .x

i ; z
i / on the ith subarc and form the Riemann sum
Sn D

CHAPTER 15
Vector Fields
If this sum has a limit as max jrij ! 0, independent of the particular choices of the
points .x
i ; y
i ; z
i /, then we call this limit the line integral of f along C and denote it
Z
C
f .x; y; z/ ds:
If C is a smooth arc and if f is continuous on C, then the limit will certainly exist;
its value is given by a deﬁnite integral of a continuous function, as shown in the next
paragraph. It will also exist (for continuous f ) if C is piecewise smooth, consisting of
ﬁnitely many smooth arcs linked end to end; in this case the line integral of f along
C is the sum of the line integrals of f along each of the smooth arcs. Improper line
integrals can also be considered, where f has discontinuities or where the length of a
curve is not ﬁnite.
Evaluating Line Integrals
The length of C was evaluated by expressing the arc length element ds D jdr=dtj dt
in terms of a parametrization r D r.t/, (a  t  b) of the curve, and integrating this
from t D a to t D b:

Of course, all of the above discussion applies equally well to line integrals of functions
f .x; y/ along curves C in the xy-plane.
Remark
It should be noted that the value of the line integral of a function f along
a curve C depends on f and C but not on the particular way C is parametrized. If
r D r.u/, ˛  u  ˇ, is another parametrization of the same smooth curve C, then
any point r.t/ on C can be expressed in terms of the new parametrization as r.u/,
where u depends on t: u D u.t/. If r.u/ traces C in the same direction as r.t/, then
u.a/ D ˛, u.b/ D ˇ, and du=dt  0; if r.u/ traces C in the opposite direction, then
u.a/ D ˇ, u.b/ D ˛, and du=dt  0. In either event,

It is comforting to get the same answer using different parametrizations. Unlike the
line integrals of vector ﬁelds considered in the next section, the line integrals of scalar
ﬁelds considered here do not depend on the direction (orientation) of C. The two
parametrizations of the semicircle were in opposite directions but still gave the same
result.
Line integrals frequently lead to deﬁnite integrals that are very difﬁcult or impossible
to evaluate without using numerical techniques. Only very simple curves and ones
that have been contrived to lead to simple expressions for ds are amenable to exact
calculation of line integrals.

Sometimes a curve, along which a line integral is to be taken, is speciﬁed as the inter-
section of two surfaces with given equations. It is normally necessary to parametrize
the curve in order to evaluate a line integral. Recall from Section 11.3 that if one of
the surfaces is a cylinder parallel to one of the coordinate axes, it is usually easiest to
begin by parametrizing that cylinder. (Otherwise, combine the equations to eliminate
one variable and thus obtain such a cylinder on which the curve lies.)

Line Integrals of Vector Fields
In elementary physics the work done by a constant force of magnitude F in moving
an object a distance d is deﬁned to be the product of F and d: W D Fd. There
is, however, a catch to this: it is understood that the force is exerted in the direction
of motion of the object. If the object moves in a direction different from that of the
force (because of some other forces acting on it), then the work done by the particular
force is the product of the distance moved and the component of the force in the di-
rection of motion. For instance, the work done by gravity in causing a 10 kg crate to
slide 5 m down a ramp inclined at 45ı to the horizontal is W D 50g=
p
2 Nm (where
g D 9:8 m/s2), since the scalar projection of the 10g N gravitational force on the crate
in the direction of the ramp is 10g=
p
2 N.
The work done by a variable force F.x; y; z/ D F.r/, which depends continu-
ously on position, in moving an object along a smooth curve C is the integral of work
elements dW: The element dW corresponding to arc length element ds at position r
on C is ds times the tangential component of the force F.r/ along C in the direction of
motion (see Figure 15.8); since OT D dr=ds is the unit tangent to C,
dW D F.r/  OT ds D F  dr:

Such a line integral is sometimes called, somewhat improperly, the line integral of F
along C. (It is not the line integral of F, which should have a vector value, but rather
the line integral of the tangential component of F, which has a scalar value.) Unlike
the line integral considered in the previous section, this line integral depends on the
direction of the orientation of C; reversing the direction of C causes this line integral
to change sign.
If C is a closed curve, the line integral of the tangential component of F around C
is also called the circulation of F around C. The fact that the curve is closed is often
indicated by a small circle drawn on the integral sign;

denotes the circulation of F around the closed curve C.
Like the line integrals studied in the previous section, a line integral of a continu-
ous vector ﬁeld is converted into an ordinary deﬁnite integral by using a parametriza-
tion of the path of integration. For a smooth arc r D r.t/ D x.t/i C y.t/j C z.t/k,

Although this type of line integral changes sign if the orientation of C is reversed,
it is otherwise independent of the particular parametrization used for C. Again, a line
integral over a piecewise smooth path is the sum of the line integrals over the individual
smooth arcs constituting that path.

Some readers may have noticed that in Example 1 above the vector ﬁeld F is con-
servative, while in Example 2 it is not. Theorem 1 below conﬁrms the link between
independence of path for a line integral of the tangential component of a vector ﬁeld
and the existence of a scalar potential function for that ﬁeld. This and subsequent the-
orems require speciﬁc assumptions on the nature of the domain of the vector ﬁeld F,
so we need to formulate some topological deﬁnitions.
Connected and Simply Connected Domains
Recall that a set S in the plane (or in 3-space) is open if every point in S is the centre of
a disk (or a ball) having positive radius and contained in S. If S is open and B is a set
(possibly empty) of boundary points of S, then the set D D S [B is called a domain.
A domain can be open or closed or neither, but cannot contain isolated points; it must
have interior points near any of its boundary points. (See Section 10.1 for a discussion
of open and closed sets and interior and boundary points.)
DEFINITION
2
A domain D is said to be connected if every pair of points P and Q in D
can be joined by a piecewise smooth curve lying in D.
For instance, the set of points .x; y/ in the plane satisfying x > 0, y > 0, and x2 C
y2  4 is a connected domain, but the set of points satisfying jxj > 1 is not connected.
(There is no path from .2; 0/ to .2; 0/ lying entirely in jxj > 1.) The set of points
.x; y; z/ in 3-space satisfying 0 < z < 1 is a connected domain, but the set satisfying
z ¤ 0 is not.
A closed curve is simple if it has no self-intersections other than beginning and
ending at the same point. (For example, a circle is a simple closed curve.) Imagine an
elastic band stretched in the shape of such a curve. If the elastic is inﬁnitely shrinkable,
it can contract down to a single point.
DEFINITION
3
A simply connected domain D is a connected domain in which every simple
closed curve can be continuously shrunk to a point in D without any part ever
passing out of D.

Figure 15.11 shows a simply connected domain in the plane. Figure 15.12 shows a
connected but not simply connected domain. (A closed curve surrounding the hole
cannot be shrunk to a point without passing out of D.) The domain in Figure 15.13 is
not even connected. It has two components; points in different components cannot be
joined by a curve that lies in D.
In the plane, a simply connected domain D can have no holes, not even a hole
consisting of a single point. The interior of every non–self-intersecting closed curve in
such a domain D lies in D. For instance, the domain of the function 1=.x2 C y2/ is
not simply connected because the origin does not belong to it. (The origin is a “hole”
in that domain.) In 3-space, a simply connected domain can have holes. The set of all
points in R3 different from the origin is simply connected, as is the exterior of a ball.
But the set of all points in R3 satisfying x2 C y2 > 0 is not simply connected. Neither
is the interior of a doughnut (a torus). In general, each of the following conditions
characterizes simply connected domains D:
(i) Any simple closed curve in D is the boundary of a “surface” lying in D.
(ii) If C1 and C2 are two curves in D having the same endpoints, then C1 can be
continuously deformed into C2 while remaining in D throughout the defor-
mation process.
Independence of Path
T H E O R E M

Independence of path
Let D be an open, connected domain, and let F be a smooth vector ﬁeld deﬁned on D.
Then the following three statements are equivalent in the sense that, if any one of them
is true, so are the other two:
(a) F is conservative in D.
(b)

F  dr D 0 for every piecewise smooth, closed curve C in D.
(c) Given any two points P0 and P1 in D,

wise smooth curves in D starting at P0 and ending at P1.
PROOF
We will show that (a) implies (b), that (b) implies (c), and that (c) implies
We require the domain D to be
open in this theorem to ensure
that partial derivatives can be
deﬁned at any point of D
(a). It then follows that any one implies the other two.

two piecewise smooth curves in D from P0 to P1. Let C D C1  C2 denote the closed
curve going from P0 to P1 along C1 and then back to P0 along C2 in the opposite
direction. (See Figure 15.14.) Since we are assuming that (b) is true, we have

Finally, suppose that (c) is true. Let P0 D .x0; y0; z0/ be a ﬁxed point in the

where C is some piecewise smooth curve in D from P0 to P . (Under the hypotheses
of the theorem such a curve exists, and, since we are assuming (c), the integral has the
same value for all such curves. Therefore,  is well deﬁned in D.) We will show that
r D F and thus establish that F is conservative and has potential .
It is sufﬁcient to show that @=@x D F1.x; y; z/; the other two components are
treated similarly. Since D is open, there is a ball of positive radius centred at P and
contained in D. Pick a point .x1; y; z/ in this ball having x1 < x. Note that the line
from this point to P is parallel to the x-axis. Since we are free to choose the curve
C in the integral deﬁning , let us choose it to consist of two segments: C1, which
is piecewise smooth and goes from .x0; y0; z0/ to .x1; y; z/, and C2, a straight line
segment from .x1; y; z/ to .x; y; z/. (See Figure 15.15.) Then

Remark
In the next chapter we will add another item to the list of three conditions
shown to be equivalent in Theorem 1, provided that the domain D is simply connected.
For such a domain, each of the above three conditions in the theorem is equivalent to

and
@F2
@z D @F3

We already know that these equations are satisﬁed on a domain where F is conserva-
tive. Theorem 4 of Section 16.2 states that if these three equations hold on a simply
connected domain, then F is conservative on that domain.

Surfaces and Surface Integrals
This section and the next are devoted to integrals of functions deﬁned over surfaces in
3-space. Before we can begin, it is necessary to make more precise just what is meant
by the term “surface.” Until now we have been treating surfaces in an intuitive way,
either as the graphs of functions f .x; y/ or as the graphs of equations f .x; y; z/ D 0.
A smooth curve is a one-dimensional object because points on it can be located
by giving one coordinate (for instance, the distance from an endpoint). Therefore,
the curve can be deﬁned as the range of a vector-valued function of one real variable.
A surface is a two-dimensional object; points on it can be located by using two co-
ordinates, and it can be deﬁned as the range of a vector-valued function of two real
variables. We will call certain such functions parametric surfaces.

Parametric Surfaces
DEFINITION
4
A parametric surface in 3-space is a continuous function r deﬁned on some
rectangle R given by a  u  b, c  v  d in the uv-plane and having
values in 3-space:
r.u; v/ D x.u; v/i C y.u; v/j C z.u; v/k;
.u; v/ in R:

Actually, we think of the range of the function r.u; v/ as being the parametric surface.
It is a set S of points .x; y; z/ in 3-space whose position vectors are the vectors r.u; v/
for .u; v/ in R. (See Figure 15.16.) If r is one-to-one, then the surface does not intersect
itself. In this case r maps the boundary of the rectangle R (the four edges) onto a curve
in 3-space, which we call the boundary of the parametric surface. The requirement
that R be a rectangle is made only to simplify the discussion. Any connected, closed,
bounded set in the uv-plane, having well-deﬁned area and consisting of an open set
together with its boundary points, would do as well. Thus, we will from time to time
consider parametric surfaces over closed disks, triangles, or other such domains in the
uv-plane. Being the range of a continuous function deﬁned on a closed, bounded set,
a parametric surface is always bounded in 3-space.
EXAMPLE 1
The graph of z D f .x; y/, where f has the rectangle R as its
domain, can be represented as the parametric surface
r D r.u; v/ D ui C vj C f .u; v/k
for .u; v/ in R. Its scalar parametric equations are
x D u;
y D v;
z D f .u; v/;
.u; v/ in R:
For such graphs it is sometimes convenient to identify the uv-plane with the xy-plane
and write the equation of the surface in the form
r D xi C yj C f .x; y/k;
.x; y/ in R:
EXAMPLE 2
Describe the surface
r D a cos u sin v i C a sin u sin v j C a cos v k;
.0  u  2; 0  v  =2/;
where a > 0. What is its boundary?

SECTION 15.5:
Surfaces and Surface Integrals
897
Solution
Observe that if x D a cos u sin v, y D a sin u sin v, and z D a cos v, then
x2 C y2 C z2 D a2. Thus, the given parametric surface lies on the sphere of radius
a centred at the origin. (Observe that u and v are the spherical coordinates  and 
on the sphere.) The restrictions on u and v allow .x; y/ to be any point in the disk
x2 C y2  a2 but force z  0. Thus, the surface is the upper half of the sphere. The
given parametrization is one-to-one on the open rectangle 0 < u < 2, 0 < v < =2,
but not on the closed rectangle, since the edges u D 0 and u D 2 get mapped onto
the same points, and the entire edge v D 0 collapses to a single point. The boundary
of the surface is still the circle x2 C y2 D a2, z D 0, and corresponds to the edge
v D =2 of the rectangle.
Remark
Surface parametrizations that are one-to-one only in the interior of the para-
meter domain R are still reasonable representations of the surface. However, as in Ex-
ample 2, the boundary of the surface may be obtained from only part of the boundary
of R, or there may be no boundary at all, in which case the surface is called a closed
surface. For example, if the domain of r in Example 2 is extended to allow 0  v  ,
then the surface becomes the entire sphere of radius a centred at the origin. The sphere
is a closed surface, having no boundary curves.
Remark
Like parametrizations of curves, parametrizations of surfaces are not unique.
The hemisphere in Example 2 can also be parametrized:
r.u; v/ D ui C vj C
p
a2  u2  v2k
for
u2 C v2  a2:
Here, the domain of r is a closed disk of radius a.

then the parametric surface

This closed curve is called a trefoil knot.

Composite Surfaces
If two parametric surfaces are joined together along part or all of their boundary curves,
the result is called a composite surface, or, thinking geometrically, just a surface. For
example, a sphere can be obtained by joining two hemispheres along their boundary
circles. In general, composite surfaces can be obtained by joining a ﬁnite number
of parametric surfaces pairwise along edges. The surface of a cube consists of the
six square faces joined in pairs along the edges of the cube. This surface is closed
since there are no unjoined edges to comprise the boundary. If the top square face is
removed, the remaining ﬁve form the surface of a cubical box with no top. The top
edges of the four side faces now constitute the boundary of this composite surface.
(See Figure 15.18.)
Surface Integrals
In order to deﬁne integrals of functions deﬁned on a surface as limits of Riemann sums,
we need to refer to the areas of regions on the surface. It is more difﬁcult to deﬁne
the area of a curved surface than it is to deﬁne the length of a curve. However, you

surfaces (squares) in pairs along edges.
The four unpaired edges at the tops of the
side faces make up the boundary of the

will likely have a good idea of what area means for a region lying in a plane, and we
examined brieﬂy the problem of ﬁnding the area of the graph of a function f .x; y/
in Section 14.7. We will avoid difﬁculties by assuming that all the surfaces we will
encounter are “smooth enough” that they can be subdivided into small pieces each of
which is approximately planar. We can then approximate the surface area of each piece
by a plane area and add up the approximations to get a Riemann sum approximation
to the area of the whole surface. We will make more precise deﬁnitions of “smooth
surface” and “surface area” later in this section. For the moment, we assume the reader
has an intuitive feel for what they mean.

Let S be a smooth surface of ﬁnite area in R3, and let f .x; y; z/ be a bounded
function deﬁned at all points of S. If we subdivide S into small, nonoverlapping pieces,
say S1, S2, : : : ; Sn, where Si has area Si (see Figure 15.19), we can form a Riemann
sum Rn for f on S by choosing arbitrary points .xi; yi; zi/ in Si and letting

If such Riemann sums have a unique limit as the diameters of all the pieces Si approach

integrable on S and call the limit the surface integral of f over S, denoting it by

Smooth Surfaces, Normals, and Area Elements
A surface is smooth if it has a unique tangent plane at any nonboundary point P: A
nonzero vector n normal to that tangent plane at P is said to be normal to the surface
at P: The following somewhat technical deﬁnition makes this precise.
DEFINITION
5
A set S in 3-space is a smooth surface if any point P in S has a neighbour-
hood N (an open ball of positive radius centred at P ) that is the domain of a
smooth function g.x; y; z/ satisfying:
(i) N \ S D fQ 2 N W g.Q/ D 0g and
(ii) rg.Q/ ¤ 0, if Q is in N \ S.
For example, the cone x2 C y2 D z2, with the origin removed, is a smooth surface.
Note that r.x2 C y2  z2/ D 0 at the origin, and the cone is not smooth there, since
it does not have a unique tangent plane.

SECTION 15.5:
Surfaces and Surface Integrals
899
A parametric surface cannot satisfy the condition of the smoothness deﬁnition
at its boundary points but will be called smooth if that condition is satisﬁed at all
nonboundary points.
We can ﬁnd the normal to a smooth parametric surface deﬁned on parameter do-
main R as follows. If .u0; v0/ is a point in the interior of R, then r D r.u; v0/ and
r D r.u0; v/ are two curves on S, intersecting at r0 D r.u0; v0/ and having, at that
point, tangent vectors (see Figure 15.20)

Even though most surfaces we encounter can be easily parametrized, it is usually pos-
sible to obtain the surface area element dS geometrically rather than relying on the
parametric formula. As we have seen above, if a surface has a one-to-one projection
onto a region in the xy-plane, then the area element dS on the surface can be expressed
as

where  is the angle between the normal vector n to S and the positive z-axis. This

Consider a surface S with equation of the form G.x; y; z/ D 0. As we discovered
in Section 12.7, if G has continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives that do not all vanish at a
point .x; y; z/ on S, then the nonzero vector
n D rG.x; y; z/
is normal to S at that point. Since nk D G3.x; y; z/, if S has a one-to-one projection
onto the domain D in the xy-plane, then

The next example illustrates a technique that can often reduce the effort needed to
integrate over a cylindrical surface.
EXAMPLE 8
Find the area of that part of the cylinder x2 C y2 D 2ay that lies
inside the sphere x2 C y2 C z2 D 4a2.
Solution
One quarter of the required area lies in the ﬁrst octant. (See Figure 15.23.)
Since the cylinder is generated by vertical lines, we can express an area element dS on
it in terms of the length element ds along the curve C in the xy-plane having equation
x2 C y2 D 2ay:
dS D z ds D
p
4a2  x2  y2 ds:
In expressing dS this way, we have already integrated dz, so only a single integral is
needed to sum these area elements. Again, it is convenient to use polar coordinates in
the xy-plane. In terms of polar coordinates, the curve C has equation r D 2a sin .
Thus, dr=d D 2a cos  and ds D

Finally, if a composite surface S is composed of smooth parametric surfaces joined
pairwise along their edges, then we call S a piecewise smooth surface. The surface
integral of a function f over a piecewise smooth surface S is the sum of the surface
integrals of f over the individual smooth surfaces comprising S. We will encounter
an example of this in the next section.
The Attraction of a Spherical Shell
In Section 14.7 we calculated the gravitational attraction of a disk in the xy-plane
on a mass m located at position .0; 0; b/ on the z-axis. Here, we undertake a similar
calculation of the attractive force exerted on m by a spherical shell of radius a and areal
density 
 (units of mass per unit area) centred at the origin. This calculation would
be more difﬁcult if we tried to do it by integrating the vertical component of the force
on m as we did in Section 14.7. It is greatly simpliﬁed if, instead, we use an integral
to ﬁnd the total gravitational potential ˆ.0; 0; z/ due to the sphere at position .0; 0; z/
and then calculate the force on m as F D mrˆ.0; 0; b/.

The potential is constant inside the sphere and decreases proportionally to 1=z outside.
The force on a mass m located at .0; 0; b/ is, therefore,
F D mrˆ.0; 0; b/ D

.4kma2=b2/k
if b > a
0
if b < a.
We are led to the somewhat surprising result that, if the mass m is anywhere inside the
sphere, the net force of attraction of the sphere on it is zero. This is to be expected at
the centre of the sphere, but away from the centre it appears that the larger forces due
to parts of the sphere close to m are exactly cancelled by smaller forces due to parts
farther away; these farther parts have larger area and therefore larger total mass. If m
is outside the sphere, the sphere attracts it with a force of magnitude
F D kmM
b2
;
where M D 4a2 is the total mass of the sphere. This is the same force that would
be exerted by a point mass with the same mass as the sphere and located at the centre
of the sphere.
Remark
A solid ball of constant density, or density depending only on the distance
from the centre (for instance, a planet), can be regarded as being made up of mass
elements that are concentric spheres of constant density. Therefore, the attraction of
such a ball on a mass m located outside the ball will also be the same as if the whole
mass of the ball were concentrated at its centre. However, the attraction on a mass m
located somewhere inside the ball will be that produced by only the part of the ball
that is closer to the centre than m is. The maximum force of attraction will occur when
m is right at the surface of the ball. If the density is constant, the magnitude of the
force increases linearly with the distance from the centre (why?) up to the surface
and then decreases with the square of the distance as m recedes from the ball. (See
Figure 15.25.)

Remark
All of the above discussion also holds for the electrostatic attraction or re-
pulsion of a point charge by a uniform charge density over a spherical shell, which is
also governed by an inverse square law. In particular, there is no net electrostatic force
on a charge located inside the shell.

Oriented Surfaces and Flux Integrals

15.6
Oriented Surfaces and Flux Integrals
Surface integrals of normal components of vector ﬁelds play a very important role in
vector calculus, similar to the role played by line integrals of tangential components of
vector ﬁelds. Before we consider such surface integrals we need to deﬁne the orienta-
tion of a surface.
Oriented Surfaces
A smooth surface S in 3-space is said to be orientable if there exists a unit vector ﬁeld
ON.P / deﬁned on S that varies continuously as P ranges over S and that is everywhere
normal to S. Any such vector ﬁeld ON.P / determines an orientation of S. The surface
must have two sides since ON.P / can have only one value at each point P: The side
out of which ON points is called the positive side; the other side is the negative side.
An oriented surface is a smooth surface together with a particular choice of orienting
unit normal vector ﬁeld ON.P /.
For example, if we deﬁne ON on the smooth surface z D f .x; y/ by
ON D
f1.x; y/i  f2.x; y/j C k
p
1 C .f1.x; y//2 C .f2.x; y//2 ;
then the top of the surface is the positive side. (See Figure 15.26.)
A smooth or piecewise smooth surface may be closed (i.e., it may have no bound-
ary), or it may have one or more boundary curves. (The unit normal vector ﬁeld ON.P /
need not be deﬁned at points of the boundary curves.)
An oriented surface S induces an orientation on any of its boundary curves C; if
we stand on the positive side of the surface S and walk around C in the direction of its
orientation, then S will be on our left side. (See Figure 15.26(a) and (b).)

(b)
A piecewise smooth surface is orientable if, whenever two smooth component
surfaces join along a common boundary curve C, they induce opposite orientations
along C. This forces the normals ON to be on the same side of adjacent components.
For instance, the surface of a cube is a piecewise smooth, closed surface, consisting of
six smooth surfaces (the square faces) joined along edges. (See Figure 15.27.) If all of
the faces are oriented so that their normals ON point out of the cube (or if they all point
into the cube), then the surface of the cube itself is oriented.

The MRobius band is not orientable; it has
only one “side”
Not every surface can be oriented, even if it appears smooth. An orientable surface
must have two sides. For example, a MRobius band, consisting of a strip of paper with
ends joined together to form a loop, but with one end given a half twist before the
ends are joined, has only one side (make one and see), so it cannot be oriented. (See
Figure 15.28.) If a nonzero vector is moved around the band, starting at point P; so
that it is always normal to the surface, then it can return to its starting position pointing
in the opposite direction.
The Flux of a Vector Field Across a Surface
Suppose 3-space is ﬁlled with an incompressible ﬂuid that ﬂows with velocity ﬁeld v.
Let S be an imaginary, smooth, oriented surface in 3-space. (We say S is imaginary
because it does not impede the motion of the ﬂuid; it is ﬁxed in space and the ﬂuid can
move freely through it.) We calculate the rate at which ﬂuid ﬂows across S. Let dS be
a small area element at point P on the surface. The ﬂuid crossing that element between
time t and time t Cdt occupies a cylinder of base area dS and height jv.P /j dt cos ,
where  is the angle between v.P / and the normal ON.P /. (See Figure 15.29.) This
cylinder has (signed) volume v.P / ON.P / dS dt. The rate at which ﬂuid crosses dS is
v.P / ON.P / dS, and the total rate at which it crosses S is given by the surface integral

Find the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld F D mr=jrj3 out of a sphere S of

Solution
Since F is the ﬁeld associated with a source of strength m at the origin
(which produces 4m units of ﬂuid per unit time at the origin), the answer must be
4m. Let us calculate it anyway. We use spherical coordinates. At any point r on
the sphere, with spherical coordinates Œa; ; , the unit outward normal is Or D r=jrj.

where the sign must be chosen to reﬂect the desired orientation of S. The ﬂux of

There are, of course, simpler versions of these formulas for surfaces of special
types. For instance, let S be a smooth, oriented surface with a one-to-one projection
onto a domain D in the xy-plane, and with equation of the form G.x; y; z/ D 0. In
Section 15.5 we showed that the surface area element on S could be written in the form
dS D
ˇˇˇˇ
rG
G3
ˇˇˇˇ dx dy;
and hence surface integrals over S could be reduced to double integrals over the domain
D. Flux integrals can be treated likewise. Depending on the orientation of S, the unit
normal ON can be written as
ON D ˙ rG
jrGj:
Thus, the vector area element dS can be written
dS D ON dS D ˙ rG.x; y; z/
G3.x; y; z/ dx dy:
The sign must be chosen to give S the desired orientation. If G3 > 0 and we want
the positive side of S to face upward, we should use the C sign. Of course, simi-
lar formulas apply for surfaces with one-to-one projections onto the other coordinate
planes.

it is quite difﬁcult. By symmetry, it is sufﬁcient to evaluate the
net ﬂux out of the cube through any one of the three pairs of
opposite faces; that is, you must calculate the ﬂux through
only two faces, say z D 1 and z D 2. Be prepared to work

Introduction
In this chapter we develop two- and three-dimensional
analogues of the one-dimensional Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus. These analogues—Green’s Theorem, Gauss’s Divergence Theorem, and
Stokes’s Theorem—are of great importance both theoretically and in applications.
They are phrased in terms of certain differential operators, divergence and curl, which
are related to the gradient operator encountered in Section 12.7. The operators are in-
troduced and their properties are derived in Sections 16.1 and 16.2. The rest of the
chapter deals with the generalizations of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and
their applications.
16.1
Gradient, Divergence, and Curl
First-order information about the rate of change of a three-dimensional scalar ﬁeld,
f .x; y; z/, is contained in the three ﬁrst partial derivatives @f=@x, @f=@y, and @f=@z.
The gradient,
grad f .x; y; z/ D rf .x; y; z/ D @f
@x i C @f
@y j C @f
@z k;
collects this information into a single vector-valued “derivative” of f: We will develop
similar ways of conveying information about the rate of change of vector ﬁelds.
First-order information about the rate of change of the vector ﬁeld
F.x; y; z/ D F1.x; y; z/i C F2.x; y; z/j C F3.x; y; z/k
is contained in nine ﬁrst partial derivatives, three for each of the three components of
the vector ﬁeld F:

(Again, we stress that F1, F2, and F3 denote the components of F, not partial deriva-
tives.) Two special combinations of these derivatives organize this information in par-
ticularly useful ways, as the gradient does for scalar ﬁelds. These are the divergence
of F (div F) and the curl of F (curl F), deﬁned as follows:

Note that the divergence of a vector ﬁeld is a scalar ﬁeld, while the curl is another
vector ﬁeld. Also observe the notation r  F and r  F, which we will sometimes use
instead of div F and curl F. This makes use of the vector differential operator

as formal scalar multiplication of r and f; so also can the divergence and curl of F
be regarded as formal dot and cross products of r with F.

Interpretation of the Divergence
The value of the divergence of a vector ﬁeld F at point P is, loosely speaking, a mea-
sure of the rate at which the ﬁeld “diverges” or “spreads away” from P: This spreading
away can be measured by the ﬂux out of a small closed surface surrounding P: For
instance, div F.P / is the limit of the ﬂux per unit volume out of smaller and smaller
spheres centred at P:

PROOF
Without loss of generality we assume that P is at the origin. We want to
expand F D F1i C F2j C F3k in a Taylor series about the origin (a Maclaurin series).
As shown in Section 12.9 for a function of two variables, the Maclaurin series for a
scalar-valued function of three variables takes the form

where “  ” represents terms of second and higher degree in x, y, and z. If we apply
this formula to the components of F, we obtain

CHAPTER 16
Vector Calculus
Remark
In two dimensions, the value div F.P / represents the limiting ﬂux per unit
area outward across small, non–self-intersecting closed curves that enclose P: See
Exercise 13 at the end of this section.
Let us return again to the interpretation of a vector ﬁeld as a velocity ﬁeld of a
moving incompressible ﬂuid. If the total ﬂux of the velocity ﬁeld outward across the
boundary surface of a domain is positive (or negative), then the ﬂuid must be produced
(or annihilated) within that domain.
The vector ﬁeld F D xi C yj C zk of Example 2 in Section 15.6 has constant
divergence, r  F D 3. In that example we showed that the ﬂux of F out of a certain
cylinder of base radius a and height 2h is 6a2h, which is three times the volume of
the cylinder. Exercises 2 and 3 of Section 15.6 conﬁrm similar results for the ﬂux of F
out of other domains. This leads to another interpretation for the divergence: div F.P /
is the source strength per unit volume of F at P: With this interpretation, we would
expect, even for a vector ﬁeld F with nonconstant divergence, that the total ﬂux of F
out of the surface S of a domain D would be equal to the total source strength of F
within D; that is,
Z

This is the Divergence Theorem, which we will prove in Section 16.4.
EXAMPLE 3
Verify that the vector ﬁeld F D mr=jrj3, due to a source of strength
m at .0; 0; 0/, has zero divergence at all points in R3 except the
origin. What would you expect to be the total ﬂux of F outward across the boundary
surface of a domain D if the origin lies outside D? if the origin is inside D?
Solution
Since

Similarly,

@y D m r2  3y2
r5
and
@F3
@z D m r2  3z2
r5
:
Adding these up, we get r  F.x; y; z/ D 0 if r > 0.
If the origin lies outside the domain D, then the source density of F in D is zero,
so we would expect the total ﬂux of F out of D to be zero. If the origin lies inside D,
then D contains a source of strength m (producing 4m cubic units of ﬂuid per unit
time), so we would expect the ﬂux out of D to be 4m. See Example 1 of Section 15.6
and also Exercises 13 and 14 of that section for speciﬁc examples.
Distributions and Delta Functions
It is very useful to represent masses, charges, or other physical properties as existing
at one point in space, or physical forces (impulses) occurring at one instant in time.
These are ﬁnite quantities but they must exist in zero space or take place over no time.
This sounds paradoxical, but the paradox can be formally resolved in the context of
integration through the theory of generalized functions (also called distributions).
Putting this into a speciﬁc context, suppose that .x/ represents the line density (mass
per unit length) of mass distributed on the interval .a; b/ of the x-axis, then the total
mass so distributed is
m D
Z b
a
.x/ dx:

SECTION 16.1:
Gradient, Divergence, and Curl
919
Now suppose that the only mass on the axis is a “point mass” m D 1 located at x D 0,
where a < 0 < b. Then at all other points x ¤ 0 on the interval, the density is
.x/ D 0, but we must still have
Z b
a
.x/ dx D m D 1;
so .0/ must be inﬁnite. This is an idealized situation—a mathematical model. No
actual function .x/ can have such properties. Functions are undeﬁned at singular
points. They do not have inﬁnite values, moreover it is ambiguous to have area deﬁned
by an inﬁnite value traded off against a zero width. We have encountered such things
before, for example in indeterminate forms. But this time the indeterminacy is resolved
by the ﬁniteness of the integral.
We can think of the density of a point mass 1 at x D 0 as the limit of large

DEFINITION
1
The Dirac distribution ı.x/ (also called the Dirac delta function, although
it is really not a function) is the “limit” of the sequence dn.x/ as n ! 1. It
is deﬁned by the requirement that

for every smooth function f .x/ deﬁned on a domain including .a; b/.
Remark
Historically .a; b/ was .1; 1/, because of the origins of ı in Fourier
analysis on the inﬁnite domain.
Many modern treatments still adopt this picture,
not only because of this, but also because many typical distributions are deﬁned on
.1; 1/. But there is no reason why distributions such as dn cannot be on ﬁnite
or semi-inﬁnite domains. This less restrictive picture will prove of importance when
discussing integral transforms in Chapter 18.

920
CHAPTER 16
Vector Calculus
Remark
The notation of Deﬁnition 1, while well-established and traditional, is odd
because it deﬁnes the properties of an integral of ı without saying what ı is directly. To
do so requires a formal mathematical study of distributions, which is beyond the scope
of this book. For physical and engineering applications though, if we bear in mind
the origin of this object as the limit of an integral, rather than the integral of a limit,
despite the notation, there is no mathematical difﬁculty. Moreover, while the intuitive
idea of ı is very useful in idealized reasoning, Deﬁnition 1 implies that the picture is
never complete without integration. Generalized functions are always partnered with
an implied integration.
Remark
Because the deﬁnition of ı is as the limit of dn, the pre-limit forms of ı
are not unique. For instance, one can approach the limit with a sequence of normal
probability densities whose standard deviations approach zero. A formal change of
variables shows that the delta function also satisﬁes

EXAMPLE 4
In view of the fact that F.r/ D mr=jrj3 satisﬁes div F.x; y; z/ D 0
for .x; y; z/ ¤ .0; 0; 0/ but produces a ﬂux of 4m out of any
sphere centred at the origin, we can regard div F.x; y; z/ as a distribution
div F.x; y; z/ D 4mı.x/ı.y/ı.z/:
In particular, integrating this distribution against f .x; y; z/ D 1 over R3, we have

The integral can equally well be taken over any domain in R3 that contains the origin
in its interior, and the result will be the same. If the origin is outside the domain, the
result will be zero. We will re-examine this situation after establishing the Divergence
Theorem in Section 16.4.
Interpretation of the Curl
Roughly speaking, curl F.P / measures the extent to which the vector ﬁeld F “swirls”
around P:

the circulation is the product of .curl v/  k and the area bounded by C. Note that this
circulation is constant for circles of any ﬁxed radius; it does not depend on the position
of the centre.
The calculations in the example above suggest that the curl of a vector ﬁeld is a measure
of the circulation per unit area in planes normal to the curl. A more precise version
of this conjecture is stated in Theorem 2 below. We will not prove this theorem now
because a proof at this stage would be quite complicated. (However, see Exercise 14
below for a special case.) A simple proof can be based on Stokes’s Theorem; see
Exercise 13 in Section 16.5.

Theorem 2 states that the local angular velocity .P / is that vector whose component
in the direction of any unit vector ON is one-half of the limiting circulation per unit area
around the (oriented) boundary circles of small circular disks centred at P and having
normal ON.
Not all vector ﬁelds with nonzero curl appear to circulate. The velocity ﬁeld for
the rigid body rotation considered in Example 5 appears to circulate around the axis of
rotation, but the circulation around a circle in a plane perpendicular to that axis turned
out to be independent of the position of the circle; it depended only on its area. The
circle need not even surround the axis of rotation. The following example investigates
a ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld whose streamlines are straight lines but that still has nonzero,
constant curl and, therefore, constant local angular velocity.

Identities (a)–(f) are versions of the Product Rule and are ﬁrst-order identities involving
only one application of r. Identities (g)–(i) are second-order identities. Identities (g)
and (h) are equivalent to the equality of mixed partial derivatives and are especially
important for the understanding of div and curl .

The ﬁrst two terms on the right constitute the ﬁrst component of .r/  F, and
the last two terms constitute the ﬁrst component of .r  F/. Therefore, the ﬁrst
components of both sides of identity (c) are equal. The equality of the other com-
ponents follows similarly.
(e) Again, it is sufﬁcient to show that the ﬁrst components of the vectors on both sides
of the identity are equal. To calculate the ﬁrst component of r  .F  G/ we need
the second and third components of F  G, which are
.F  G/2 D F3G1  F1G3

While these are useful identities, they cannot be used to give simpler proofs of the
identities in Theorem 3 by replacing one or other of the vectors with r. (Why?)
Scalar and Vector Potentials
Two special terms are used to describe vector ﬁelds for which either the divergence or
the curl is identically zero.
DEFINITION
2
Solenoidal and irrotational vector ﬁelds
A vector ﬁeld F is called solenoidal in a domain D if div F D 0 in D.
A vector ﬁeld F is called irrotational in a domain D if curl F D 0 in D.
Part (h) of Theorem 3 says that F D grad  ÷ curl F D 0. Thus,
Every conservative vector ﬁeld is irrotational.
Part (g) of Theorem 3 says that F D curl G ÷ div F D 0. Thus,
The curl of any vector ﬁeld is solenoidal.
The converses of these assertions hold if the domain of F satisﬁes certain conditions.
T H E O R E M
4
If F is a smooth, irrotational vector ﬁeld on a simply connected domain D, then F D
r for some scalar potential function deﬁned on D, so F is conservative.
T H E O R E M
5
If F is a smooth, solenoidal vector ﬁeld on a domain D with the property that every
closed surface in D bounds a domain contained in D, then F D curl G for some vector
ﬁeld G deﬁned on D. Such a vector ﬁeld G is called a vector potential of the vector
ﬁeld F.
We cannot prove these results in their full generality at this point. However, both
theorems have simple proofs in the special case where the domain D is star-like. A
star-like domain is one for which there exists a point P0 such that the line segment
from P0 to any point P in D lies wholly in D. (See Figure 16.4.) Both proofs are
constructive in that they tell you how to ﬁnd a potential.

Without loss of generality, we can

segment

The details of the proof of Theorem 5 for star-like domains are similar to those of
Theorem 4, and we relegate the proof to Exercise 18 below.
Note that vector potentials, when they exist, are very nonunique. Since curl grad 
is identically zero (Theorem 3(h)), an arbitrary conservative ﬁeld can be added to G
without changing the value of curl G. The following example illustrates just how
much freedom you have in making simplifying assumptions when trying to ﬁnd a vec-
tor potential.
EXAMPLE 1
Show that the vector ﬁeld F D .x2Cyz/i2y.xCz/jC.xyCz2/k
is solenoidal in R3 and ﬁnd a vector potential for it.
Solution
Since div F D 2x  2.x C z/ C 2z D 0 in R3, F is solenoidal. A vector
potential G for F must satisfy curl G D F; that is,
@G3
@y  @G2
@z
D x2 C yz;
@G1
@z  @G3
@x D 2xy  2yz;
@G2
@x  @G1
@y D xy C z2:
The three components of G have nine independent ﬁrst partial derivatives, so there are
nine “degrees of freedom” involved in their determination. The three equations above
use up three of these nine degrees of freedom. That leaves six. Let us try to ﬁnd a
solution G with G2 D 0 identically. This means that all three ﬁrst partials of G2 are
zero, so we have used up three degrees of freedom in making this assumption. We have
three left. The ﬁrst equation now implies that
G3 D
Z
.x2 C yz/ dy D x2y C 1
2 y2z C M.x; z/:
(Since we were integrating with respect to y, the constant of integration can still de-
pend on x and z.) We make a second simplifying assumption, that M.x; z/ D 0. This
uses up two more degrees of freedom, leaving one. From the second equation we have
@G1
@z
D @G3
@x  2xy  2yz D 2xy  2xy  2yz D 2yz;
so
G1 D 2
Z
yz dz D yz2 C N.x; y/:

SECTION 16.2:

We cannot assume that N.x; y/ D 0 identically because that would require two degrees
of freedom and we have only one. However, the third equation implies
xy C z2 D @G1
@y D z2  @N
@y :
Thus, .@=@y/N.x; y/ D xy; observe that the terms involving z have cancelled out.
This happened because div F D 0. Had F not been solenoidal, we could not have
determined N as a function of x and y only from the above equation. As it is, however,
we have
N.x; y/ D 
Z

as the required vector potential for F. You can check that curl G D F. Of course,
other choices of simplifying assumptions would have led to very different functions G,
which would have been equally correct.
In theoretical physics any particular choice of curl free term added to G is called a
“gauge,” and there is an elaborate theory known as “gauge theory,” which explores the
relative merits of such gauges and their relationships to each other.
Maple Calculations
The Maple VectorCalculus package deﬁnes routines for creating a vector ﬁeld as well
as calculating the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld and the divergences and curl of a vector
ﬁeld. It will also calculate the Laplacian of a scalar or vector ﬁeld and allow the use of
the “del” operator in dot and cross products. Some of these capabilities are restricted
to three-dimensional vector ﬁelds. Let us begin by loading the package and declaring
the type of coordinate system we will use and the names of the coordinates:
>
with(VectorCalculus):
>
SetCoordinates(’cartesian’[x,y,z]);
cartesianx;y;z
Setting the coordinates at the outset means we don’t have to do it every time we call
one of the procedures for handling vector ﬁelds, such as the Gradient procedure,
which we illustrated at the end of Section 12.7. To calculate the gradient of a scalar
expression in the variables x, y, and z, we could simply enter
>
f := x^2 + x*y - z^3; G := Gradient(f);
f WD x2 C xy  z3
G WD .2x C y/ Nex C x Ney  3z2 Nez
Maple shows that the result G is a vector ﬁeld rather than just a vector by placing
bars over the basis vectors. Maple treats vector ﬁelds and vectors as different kinds of
objects; you can, for example, add two vector ﬁelds or two vectors, but you can’t add a
vector to a vector ﬁeld. A vector ﬁeld is a vector-valued function of a vector variable.
To evaluate a vector ﬁeld at a particular vector, you use the evalVF procedure:
>
evalVF(G,<1,1,1>);

CHAPTER 16

You can deﬁne a vector ﬁeld F with the VectorField procedure:
>
F := VectorField(<x*y, 2*y*z, 3*x*z>);
F WD x y Nex C 2 y z Ney C 3 x z Nez
Then we can calculate the divergence or curl of F by using the Divergence or Curl
procedures, or by dot or cross products with the Del operator:
>
Divergence(F); Del.F;
y C 2 z C 3 x
y C 2 z C 3 x
>
Curl(F); Del &x F;
2 y Nex  3 z Ney  x Nez
2 y Nex  3 z Ney  x Nez
We can verify the identities in Theorem 3 by using arbitrary scalar and vector
ﬁelds:
>
H := VectorField(<u(x,y,z),v(x,y,z),w(x,y,z)>);
H WD u.x; y; z/ Nex C v.x; y; z/ Ney C w.x; y; z/ Nez
>
Divergence(Curl(H)); Curl(Gradient(u(x,y,z));
0
0 Nex
0 Nex is VectorCalculus’s way of denoting the zero vector ﬁeld.
>
Curl(Curl(H)) - Gradient(Divergence(H)) + Laplacian(H);
0 Nex
VectorCalculus also has procedures for ﬁnding the scalar potential of an irrota-
tional vector ﬁeld and the vector potential of a solenoidal vector ﬁeld:
>
ScalarPotential(VectorField(<x,y,z>));
1
2 x2 C 1
2 y2 C 1
2 z2
>
VectorPotential(VectorField(<x^2, -x*y, -x*z>));
x y z Nex  x2 z Ney
Neither procedure gives any output if you fail to feed it a vector ﬁeld satisfying the
appropriate condition (irrotational or solenoidal).
Finally, let us note that VectorCalculus is quite happy to deal with coordinate
systems other than ’cartesian’[x,y,z]. For instance,
>
SetCoordinates(’cylindrical’[r,theta,z]);

Green’s Theorem
Let R be a regular, closed region in the xy-plane whose boundary, C, consists of one or
more piecewise smooth, simple closed curves that are positively oriented with respect
to R. If F D F1.x; y/i C F2.x; y/j is a smooth vector ﬁeld on R, then

PROOF
Recall that a regular region can be divided into nonoverlapping subregions
that are both x-simple and y-simple. (See Section 14.2.) When two such regions share
a common boundary curve, they induce opposite orientations on that curve, so the
sum of the line integrals over the boundaries of the subregions is just the line integral
over the boundary of the whole region. (See Figure 16.6.) The double integrals over
the subregions also add to give the double integral over the whole region. It there-
fore sufﬁces to show that the formula holds for a region R that is both x-simple and
y-simple.

The Two-Dimensional Divergence Theorem
The following theorem is an alternative formulation of the two-dimensional Funda-

the boundary C of R.

(Average values of harmonic functions) If u.x; y/ is

the value of u at the centre. Prove this by showing that the

the Divergence Theorem and the harmonicity of u, and the
fact that the limit of the average value as r ! 0 is the value of
u at the centre.

The Divergence Theorem in 3-Space
The Divergence Theorem (also called Gauss’s Theorem) is one of two important ver-
sions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in R3. (The other is Stokes’s Theorem,
presented in the next section.)
In the Divergence Theorem, the integral of the derivative div F D r  F over
a domain in 3-space is expressed as the ﬂux of F out of the surface of that domain.
It therefore closely resembles the two-dimensional version, Theorem 7, given in the
previous section. The theorem holds for a general class of domains in R3 that are
bounded by piecewise smooth closed surfaces. However, we will restrict our statement
and proof of the theorem to domains of a special type. Extending the concept of an
x-simple plane domain deﬁned in Section 14.2, we say the three-dimensional domain
D is x-simple if it is bounded by a piecewise smooth surface S and if every straight
line parallel to the x-axis and passing through an interior point of D meets S at exactly
two points. Similar deﬁnitions hold for y-simple and z-simple, and we call the domain
D regular if it is a union of ﬁnitely many, nonoverlapping subdomains, each of which
is x-simple, y-simple, and z-simple.

PROOF
Since the domain D is a union of ﬁnitely many nonoverlapping domains
that are x-simple, y-simple, and z-simple, it is sufﬁcient to prove the theorem for a
subdomain of D with this property. To see this, suppose, for instance, that D and S
are each divided into two parts, D1 and D2, and S1 and S2, by a surface S slicing
through D. (See Figure 16.10.) S is part of the boundary of both D1 and D2,

Stokes’s Theorem
Let S be a piecewise smooth, oriented surface in 3-space, having unit normal ﬁeld

PROOF
An argument similar to those given in the proofs of Green’s Theorem and the
Divergence Theorem shows that if S is decomposed into ﬁnitely many nonoverlapping
subsurfaces, then it is sufﬁcient to prove that the formula above holds for each of
them. (If subsurfaces S1 and S2 meet along the curve C, then C inherits opposite
orientations as part of the boundaries of S1 and S2, so the line integrals along C
cancel out. See Figure 16.15(a).) We can subdivide S into enough smooth subsurfaces
that each one has a one-to-one normal projection onto a coordinate plane. We will
establish the formula for one such subsurface, which we will now call S.

Remark
If curl F D 0 on a domain D with the property that every piecewise smooth,
non–self-intersecting, closed curve in D is the boundary of a piecewise smooth surface
in D, then Stokes’s Theorem assures us that
H
C F  dr D 0 for every such curve
C; therefore F must be conservative. A simply connected domain D does have the
property speciﬁed above. We will not attempt a formal proof of this topological fact
here, but it should seem plausible if you recall the deﬁnition of simple connectedness;
a closed curve C in a simply connected domain D must be able to shrink to a point in
D without ever passing out of D. In so shrinking, it traces out a surface in D. This is
why Theorem 4 of Section 16.2 is valid for simply connected domains.

As with the Divergence Theorem, the principal importance of Stokes’s Theorem is as
a theoretical tool. However, it can also simplify the calculation of circulation integrals
such as the one in the previous example. It is not difﬁcult to imagine integrals whose
evaluation would be impossibly difﬁcult without the use of Stokes’s Theorem or the
Divergence Theorem. In the following example we use Stokes’s Theorem twice, but
the result could be obtained just as easily by using the Divergence Theorem.

CHAPTER 16

16.6
Some Physical Applications of Vector Calculus
In this section we will show how the theory developed in this chapter can be used
to model concrete applied mathematical problems.
We will look at two areas of
application—ﬂuid dynamics and electromagnetism—and will develop a few of the
fundamental vector equations underlying these disciplines. Our purpose is to illus-
trate the techniques of vector calculus in applied contexts, rather than to provide any
complete or even coherent introductions to the disciplines themselves.
E
Fluid Dynamics
Suppose that a region of 3-space is ﬁlled with a ﬂuid (liquid or gas) in motion. Two
approaches can be taken to describe the motion. We could attempt to determine the
position, r D r.a; b; c; t/ at any time t, of a “particle” of ﬂuid that was located at
the point .a; b; c/ at time t D 0. This is the Lagrange approach. Alternatively, we
could attempt to determine the velocity, v.x; y; z; t/, the density, .x; y; z; t/, and
other physical variables such as the pressure, p.x; y; z; t/, at any time t at any point
.x; y; z/ in the region occupied by the ﬂuid. This is the Euler approach.
We will examine the latter method and describe how the Divergence Theorem
can be used to translate some fundamental physical laws into equivalent mathemat-
ical equations. We assume throughout that the velocity, density, and pressure vary
smoothly in all their variables and that the ﬂuid is an ideal ﬂuid, that is, nonviscous
(it doesn’t stick to itself), homogeneous, and isotropic (it has the same properties at all
points and in all directions). Such properties are not always shared by real ﬂuids, so
we are dealing with a simpliﬁed mathematical model that does not always correspond
exactly to the behaviour of real ﬂuids.
Consider an imaginary closed surface S in the ﬂuid, bounding a domain D. We
call S “imaginary” because it is not a barrier that impedes the ﬂow of the ﬂuid in any
way; it is just a means to concentrate our attention on a particular part of the ﬂuid. It is
ﬁxed in space and does not move with the ﬂuid. Let us assume that the ﬂuid is being
neither created nor destroyed anywhere (in particular, there are no sources or sinks), so
the law of conservation of mass tells us that the rate of change of the mass of ﬂuid in
D equals the rate at which ﬂuid enters D across S.
The mass of ﬂuid in volume element dV located at position .x; y; z/ at time t is
.x; y; z; t/ dV; so the mass in D at time t is
RRR
D  dV; which depends only on t. This
mass changes at rate

As we noted in Section 15.6, the volume of ﬂuid passing out of D through area element

ON dS dt, where ON is the unit normal at .x; y; z/ on S pointing out of D. Hence, the
mass crossing dS outward in that time interval is v  ON dS dt, and the rate at which
mass is ﬂowing out of D across S at time t is

This equation must hold for any domain D in the ﬂuid.
If a continuous function f satisﬁes
RRR
D f .P / dV D 0 for every domain D, then
f .P / D 0 at all points P; for if there were a point P0 such that f .P0/ ¤ 0 (say
f .P0/ > 0), then, by continuity, f would be positive at all points in some sufﬁciently
small ball B centred at P0, and
RRR
B f .P / dV would be greater than 0. Applying this
principle, we must have
@

and div .v/ D  div v. Therefore, the equation of continuity for an incompressible
ﬂuid is simply
div v D 0:
The motion of the ﬂuid is governed by Newton’s Second Law, which asserts that the
rate of change of momentum of any part of the ﬂuid is equal to the sum of the forces
applied to that part. Again, let us consider the part of the ﬂuid in a domain D. At any

forces) acting on the ﬂuid. Let us examine each of these causes in turn.

Electromagnetism
In 3-space there are deﬁned two vector ﬁelds that determine the electric and magnetic
forces that would be experienced by a unit charge at a particular point if it is moving
with unit speed. (These vector ﬁelds are determined by electric charges and currents
present in the space.) A charge q0 at position r D xi C yj C zk moving with velocity
v0 experiences an electric force q0E.r/, where E is the electric ﬁeld, and a magnetic
force q0v0  B.r/, where B is the magnetic ﬁeld. We will look brieﬂy at each of these
ﬁelds but will initially restrict ourselves to considering static situations. Electric ﬁelds
produced by static charge distributions and magnetic ﬁelds produced by static electric
currents do not depend on time. Later we will consider the interaction between the two
ﬁelds when they are time-dependent.

Experimental evidence shows that the value of the electric ﬁeld at any point r is the
vector sum of the ﬁelds caused by any elements of charge located in 3-space. A “point

Magnetic ﬁelds are produced by moving charges, that is, by currents. Suppose that
a constant electric current, I, is ﬂowing in a ﬁlament along the curve F. It has been
determined experimentally that the magnetic ﬁelds produced at position r D xiCyjC

Imagine a circuit consisting of a straight ﬁlament along the z-axis with return at
inﬁnite distance. The ﬁeld B at a ﬁnite point will then just be due to the current along
the z-axis, where the current I is ﬂowing in the direction of k, say. The currents in all

Observe that the circulation calculated above is independent of a. In fact, if C is any
closed curve that encircles the z-axis once counterclockwise (as seen from above),
then C and Ca comprise the oriented boundary of a washer-like surface S with a hole
in it through which the ﬁlament passes. Since curl B D 0 on S, Stokes’s Theorem
guarantees that

Furthermore, when C is very small (and therefore very close to the ﬁlament), most of
the contribution to the circulation of B around it comes from the part of the ﬁlament
that is very close to C. It therefore does not matter whether the ﬁlament is straight or
inﬁnitely long. For any closed-loop ﬁlament carrying a current, the circulation of the
magnetic ﬁeld around the oriented boundary of a surface through which the ﬁlament
passes is equal to 0 times the current ﬂowing in the loop. This is Ampère’s Circuital
Law. The surface is oriented with normal on the side out of which the current is
ﬂowing.
Now let us replace the ﬁlament with a more general current speciﬁed by a vector
density, J. This means that at any point s the current is ﬂowing in the direction J.s/
and that the current crossing an area element dS with unit normal ON is J  ON dS. The
circulation of B around the boundary C of surface S is equal to the total current ﬂowing

The differential form of Ampère’s Law, curl B D 0 J, also requires modiﬁcation.
If the electric ﬁeld depends on time, then so will the current density J. Assuming

argument identical to that used to obtain the continuity equation for ﬂuid motion earlier
in this section, that the rate of change of charge density satisﬁes

Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinates
In this optional section we will derive formulas for the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld and
the divergence and curl of a vector ﬁeld in terms of coordinate systems more general
than the Cartesian coordinate system used in the earlier sections of this chapter. In

952
CHAPTER 16
Vector Calculus
particular, we will express these quantities in terms of the cylindrical and spherical
coordinate systems introduced in Section 14.6.
We denote by xyz-space the usual system of Cartesian coordinates .x; y; z/ in R3.
A different system of coordinates Œu; v; w in xyz-space can be deﬁned by a continuous
transformation of the form
x D x.u; v; w/;
y D y.u; v; w/;
z D z.u; v; w/:
If the transformation is one-to-one from a region D in uvw-space onto a region R in
xyz-space, then a point P in R can be represented by a triple Œu; v; w, the (Cartiesian)
coordinates of the unique point Q in uvw-space that the transformation maps to P: In
this case we say that the transformation deﬁnes a curvilinear coordinate system in
R and call Œu; v; w the curvilinear coordinates of P with respect to that system.
Note that Œu; v; w are Cartesian coordinates in their own space (uvw-space); they are
curvilinear coordinates in xyz-space.
Typically, we relax the requirement that the transformation deﬁning a curvilinear
coordinate system be one-to-one, that is, that every point P in R should have a unique
set of curvilinear coordinates. It is reasonable to require the transformation to be only
locally one-to-one. Thus, there may be more than one point Q that gets mapped to a
point P by the transformation, but only one in any suitably small subregion of D. For
example, in the plane polar coordinate system
x D r cos ;
y D r sin ;
the transformation is locally one-to-one from D, the half of the r-plane where 0 <
r < 1, to the region R consisting of all points in the xy-plane except the origin.
Although, say, Œ1; 0 and Œ1; 2	 are polar coordinates of the same point in the xy-
plane, they are not close together in D. Observe, however, that there is still a problem
with the origin, which can be represented by Œ0;  for any . Since the transformation
is not even locally one-to-one at r D 0, we regard the origin of the xy-plane as a
singular point for the polar coordinate system in the plane.
EXAMPLE 1
The cylindrical coordinate system Œr; ; z in R3 is deﬁned by the
transformation
x D r cos ;
y D r sin ;
z D z;
where r  0. (See Section 10.6.) This transformation maps the half-space D given
by r > 0 onto all of xyz-space excluding the z-axis, and it is locally one-to-one. We
regard Œr; ; z as cylindrical polar coordinates in all of xyz-space but call points on
the z-axis singular points of the system since the points Œ0; ; z are identical for any .
EXAMPLE 2
The spherical coordinate system ŒR; ;  is deﬁned by the
transformation
x D R sin  cos ;
y D R sin  sin ;
z D R cos ;
where R  0 and 0    	. (See Section 10.6.) The transformation maps the
region D in R-space given by R > 0, 0 <  < 	 in a locally one-to-one way onto
xyz-space excluding the z-axis. The point with Cartesian coordinates .0; 0; z/ can be
represented by the spherical coordinates Œ0; ;  for arbitrary  and  if z D 0, by
Œz; 0;  for arbitrary  if z > 0, and by Œjzj; 	;  for arbitrary  if z < 0. Thus, all
points of the z-axis are singular for the spherical coordinate system.

SECTION 16.7:
Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinates
953
Coordinate Surfaces and Coordinate Curves
Let Œu; v; w be a curvilinear coordinate system in xyz-space, and let P0 be a non-
singular point for the system. Thus, the transformation
x D x.u; v; w/;
y D y.u; v; w/;
z D z.u; v; w/
is locally one-to-one near P0. Let P0 have curvilinear coordinates Œu0; v0; w0. The
plane with equation u D u0 in uvw-space gets mapped by the transformation to a
surface in xyz-space passing through P0. We call this surface a u-surface and still
refer to it by the equation u D u0; it has parametric equations
x D x.u0; v; w/;
y D y.u0; v; w/;
z D z.u0; v; w/
with parameters v and w. Similarly, the v-surface v D v0 and the w-surface w D w0
pass through P0; they are the images of the planes v D v0 and w D w0 in uvw-space.
Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates
We say that Œu; v; w is an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system in
xyz-space if, for every nonsingular point P0 in xyz-space, each of the three
coordinate surfaces u D u0, v D v0, and w D w0 intersects the other two
at P0 at right angles.
It is tacitly assumed that the coordinate surfaces are smooth at all nonsingular points, so
we are really assuming that their normal vectors are mutually perpendicular.
Figure 16.19 shows the coordinate surfaces through P0 for a typical orthogonal curvi-
linear coordinate system.
Pairs of coordinate surfaces through a point intersect along a coordinate curve
through that point. For example, the coordinate surfaces v D v0 and w D w0 intersect
along the u-curve with parametric equations
x D x.u; v0; w0/;
y D y.u; v0; w0/;
and
z D z.u; v0; w0/;
where the parameter is u. A unit vector Ou tangent to the u-curve through P0 is normal
to the coordinate surface u D u0 there. Similar statements hold for unit vectors Ov
and Ow. For an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system, the three vectors Ou, Ov, and Ow
form a basis of mutually perpendicular unit vectors at any nonsingular point P0. (See
Figure 16.19.) We call this basis the local basis at P0.

Scale Factors and Differential Elements
For the rest of this section we assume that Œu; v; w are orthogonal curvilinear coordi-
nates in xyz-space deﬁned via the transformation
x D x.u; v; w/;
y D y.u; v; w/;
z D z.u; v; w/:
We also assume that the coordinate surfaces are smooth at any nonsingular point and
that the local basis vectors Ou, Ov, and Ow at any such point form a right-handed triad.
This is the case for both cylindrical and spherical coordinates. For spherical coordi-
nates, this is the reason we chose the order of the coordinates as ŒR; ; , rather than
ŒR; ; .
The position vector of a point P in xyz-space can be expressed in terms of the
curvilinear coordinates:
r D x.u; v; w/i C y.u; v; w/j C z.u; v; w/k:

SECTION 16.7:

If we hold v D v0 and w D w0 ﬁxed and let u vary, then r D r.u; v0; w0/ deﬁnes a
u-curve in xyz-space. At any point P on this curve, the vector
@r
@u D @x
@ui C @y
@uj C @z
@uk
is tangent to the u-curve at P: In general, the three vectors
@r
@u;
@r
@v ;
and
@r
@w
are tangent, respectively, to the u-curve, the v-curve, and the w-curve through P: They
are also normal, respectively, to the u-surface, the v-surface, and the w-surface through
P; so they are mutually perpendicular. (See Figure 16.19.) The lengths of these tangent
vectors are called the scale factors of the coordinate system.
The scale factors of the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system Œu; v; w
are the three functions

@u
ˇˇˇˇ ;
hv D
ˇˇˇˇ
@r
@v
ˇˇˇˇ ;
hw D
ˇˇˇˇ
@r
@w
ˇˇˇˇ :
The scale factors are nonzero at a nonsingular point P of the coordinate system, so
the local basis at P can be obtained by dividing the tangent vectors to the coordinate
curves by their lengths. As noted previously, we denote the local basis vectors by Ou, Ov,
and Ow. Thus,
@r
@u D hu Ou;
@r
@v D hv Ov;
and
@r
@w D hw Ow:
The basis vectors Ou, Ov, and Ow will form a right-handed triad provided we have chosen
a suitable order for the coordinates u, v, and w.

The volume element in an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system is the volume
of an inﬁnitesimal coordinate box bounded by pairs of u-, v-, and w-surfaces corre-
sponding to values u and u C du, v and v C dv, and w and w C dw, respectively.
See Figure 16.24. Since these coordinate surfaces are assumed smooth, and since they
intersect at right angles, the coordinate box is rectangular and is spanned by the vectors
@r
@u du D hu du Ou;
@r
@v dv D hv dv Ov;
and
@r
@w dw D hw dw Ow:
Therefore, the volume element is given by

Grad, Div, and Curl in Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinates
The gradient rf of a scalar ﬁeld f can be expressed in terms of the local basis at any
point P with curvilinear coordinates Œu; v; w in the form
rf D fu Ou C fv Ov C fw Ow:
In order to determine the coefﬁcients fu, fv, and fw in this formula, we will compare
two expressions for the directional derivative of f along an arbitrary curve in xyz-
space.
If the curve C has parametrization r D r.s/ in terms of arc length, then the direc-
tional derivative of f along C is given by
df

On the other hand, this directional derivative is also given by df=ds D rf  OT, where

The ﬂux of F out of the inﬁnitesimal coordinate box of Figure 16.24 is the sum of the

To calculate the curl of a vector ﬁeld expressed in terms of orthogonal curvi-
linear coordinates we can make use of some previously obtained vector identities.
First, observe that the gradient of the scalar ﬁeld f .u; v; w/ D u is Ou=hu, so that
Ou D huru. Similarly, Ov D hvrv and Ow D hwrw. Therefore, the vector ﬁeld
F D Fu Ou C Fv Ov C Fw Ow
can be written in the form
F D Fuhuru C Fvhvrv C Fwhwrw:

the result above. This is why we assumed that the curvilinear coordinate system was
right-handed.
Corresponding expressions can be calculated for the other two terms in the for-
mula for curl F. Combining the three terms, we conclude that the curl of

(The expanding universe) Let v be the large-scale velocity
ﬁeld of matter in the universe. (Large-scale means on the scale
of intergalactic distances; small-scale motion such as that of
planetary systems about their suns, and even stars about galac-
tic centres, has been averaged out.) Assume that v is a smooth
vector ﬁeld. According to present astronomical theory, the dis-
tance between any two points is increasing, and the rate of in-
crease is proportional to the distance between the points. The
constant of proportionality, C, is called Hubble’s constant. In

(Solid angle) Two rays from a point P determine an angle at
P whose measure in radians is equal to the length of the arc
of the circle of radius 1 with centre at P lying between the two
rays. Similarly, an arbitrarily shaped half-cone K with vertex at
P determines a solid angle at P whose measure in steradians
(stereo + radians) is the area of that part of the sphere of radius
1 with centre at P lying within K. For example, the ﬁrst octant
of R3 is a half-cone with vertex at the origin. It determines a
solid angle at the origin measuring

Differential Forms
and Exterior Calculus
“
The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics
for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we
neither understand nor deserve.
”
Eugene P. Wigner 1902–1995
from The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences (1960)
Introduction
In S. P. Thompson’s classic 1914 text, Calculus Made
Easy (2nd ed.), he playfully described the “d” in a dif-
ferential as a “dreadful” symbol. He concluded it was best to think of “d” as an op-
eration that takes “a little bit of.” Thus, the ubiquitous intuition about differentials
being vaguely “small” has a long history that belies the historical, but ultimately suc-
cessful, struggle of mathematicians to escape from “inﬁnitesimals.” Our deﬁnitions of
differentials in Sections 2.2 and 12.6 made it quite clear that differentials are just new
independent and dependent variables that can have any values, not just small ones. It is
only when we have used differentials to approximate the changes in values of functions
that we have thought of differentials as small in order that the errors in the approxi-
mations be small. We have also seen differentials used in contexts where smallness
is neither implied nor desirable, for example, in the applications in Sections 12.6 and
13.9.
This chapter focuses on differentials and develops a new kind of “calculus” called
exterior calculus that enables differentials to play a much greater role in applications
in the physical and other sciences. It amounts to a rethink of how calculus is tradi-
tionally done. Sections 17.1 and 17.2 set up the mechanics of “k-forms” and “differen-
tial forms” (which are ﬁelds of k-forms analogous to vector ﬁelds) and the operators
“wedge product” and “exterior derivative” that act on them. These are analogous to dif-
ferential calculus, while the remaining three sections constitute a rethink of integration.
Section 17.3 deﬁnes manifolds and bridges the classical multiple integral to integrals
of differential forms. A central issue in integration is orientation, which differential
forms naturally take into account in any dimension. This is the subject of Section 17.4.
Section 17.5 revisits the classical integration theorems of advanced calculus, showing
them in a uniﬁed light in the Generalized Stokes’s Theorem.
Differentials and Vectors
Differentials have properties similar to vectors. Consider the differential of the func-
tion f .x; y; z/ and its gradient rf :
df D @f
@x dx C @f
@y dy C @f
@z dz
rf D @f
@x i C @f
@y j C @f
@z k:
The expression for df appears to expand df as a linear combination of “basis vectors”
dx, dy, and dz, which play the same role that i, j, and k do in the expression for rf :

SECTION 17.1:
k-Forms
965
they both imply direction as well as magnitude. We will come to regard differentials
as elements of vector spaces in this chapter.
The idea of a differential having direction (orientation) is implicit in the deﬁnition
of the deﬁnite integral in Chapter 5.
R b
a f .x/ dx is the integral of the differential form
f .x/ dx over the interval Œa; b oriented from a to b. Reversing this orientation results
in the integral changing sign:
R a
b f .x/ dx D 
R b
a f .x/ dx. Our deﬁnitions of double
and triple integrals in Chapter 14 involved no such “built-in” concept of orientation;
for instance, we treated the area element in R2 as dA D dx dy D dy dx. This meant
that the orientation concept had to be artiﬁcially built in to the statements of two- and
three-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in Chapter 16.
Other than representing the
dreaded “little bit of area,” dA
has no meaning; it is not the
differential of anything, and
neither is dx dy.
This deﬁciency will be remedied in this chapter by the introduction of a new kind of
product (the wedge product), where we will replace the inadequate product dx dy with
dx ^ dy, which is antisymmetric in the sense that dy ^ dx D dx ^ dy. This will,
in turn, make it possible to deﬁne integrals over “manifolds” of any dimension and
obtain a single version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that applies in any
dimension.
Derivatives versus Differentials
It is a peculiarity of the conventional language that, except in special cases, when we
speak of differential equations we are actually speaking of equations between deriva-
tives and not equations between differentials. Exterior calculus inverts this. The ex-
terior derivative deﬁned in Section 17.2 is properly a kind of differential and not a
derivative as the term is conventionally used in calculus. The exterior derivative (i.e.,
“d”), together with the notion of products of forms, allows for a new kind of object.
One can, loosely speaking, take the differential of a differential in a meaningful way.
This is something completely new. By forming independent bases in their own vector
spaces, k-forms retain the ability to “separate” (into components) that vectors have.
Thus, differential equations can be replaced by equivalent equations in differentials of
k-forms.
17.1
k-Forms
In this section, we develop the notion of forms and their products, known as wedge
products. Let the n vectors e1 D .1; 0; 0; : : : ; 0/, e2 D .0; 1; 0; : : : ; 0/, : : : , and
en D .0; 0; 0; : : : ; 1/ be the standard basis for the n-dimensional real vector space
Rn. A function that maps a real vector space into R is called a “functional.” In phys-
ical examples, such as integrals for energy, functionals are commonly encountered on
vector spaces of functions (inﬁnite dimensional function spaces), but in the following
deﬁnition we introduce a functional on the ﬁnite dimensional vector space Rn.
DEFINITION
1
A real-valued function  deﬁned on Rn is called a 1-form (or a linear func-
tional) on Rn if, whenever x and y belong to Rn and a and b are real numbers,
then
.ax C by/ D a.x/ C b.y/:
For example, if x D x1e1 C x2e2 C    C xnen, then the function  deﬁned by
.x/ D a1x1 C a2x2 C    C anxn D a  x
is a 1-form on Rn for any a 2 Rn. In fact, every 1-form on Rn is of this type, because,

The set of all 1-forms on Rn is denoted ƒ1.Rn/ and is a real vector space called
the dual space of Rn. If  and  are 1-forms and  D u C v , where u and v
are real numbers, then, as noted above, .x/ D a  x, and  .x/ D b  x for certain
n-vectors a and b, so
.x/ D u.x/ C v .x/ D ua  x C vb  x D .ua C vb/  x;
and  is a 1-form corresponding to the vector ua C vb.
Now we make an important deﬁnition that appears to give “differentials” a new
role to play, rather than just being new independent and dependent variables in a dif-
ferentiation process. Being a vector space, ƒ1.Rn/ must itself have a basis.
DEFINITION
2
Differentials as basis vectors for 1-forms
For 1  i  n, let dxi be the 1-form that assigns to v 2 Rn its ith component
vi:
dxi.v/ D vi
for all v 2 Rn:
Since any 1-form  on Rn can be written in the form
.v/ D
n
X
iD1
.ei/ vi D
n
X
iD1
.ei/ dxi.v/;
we can therefore write  D
n
X
iD1
.ei/ dxi.
We have now departed from the
convention up to this point of
depicting differentials on both
sides of any equality. It is not
necessary that a 1-form be the
differential of some function.
Thus, the differentials dxi for 1  i  n constitute a basis for ƒ1.Rn/,
which we will call the standard basis. ƒ1.Rn/ must therefore also be an
n-dimensional vector space.
Bilinear Forms and 2-Forms
The Cartesian product RnRn D f.x; y/ W x; y 2 Rng is a vector space of dimension
2n. A bilinear form  on Rn is a map from Rn  Rn into R such that .x; y/ is linear
in x for each ﬁxed y and linear in y for each ﬁxed x; that is,
.ax C by; z/ D a.x; z/ C b.y; z/
.x; ay C bz/ D a.x; y/ C b.x; z/
holds for all a; b 2 R and all x; y; z 2 Rn.
EXAMPLE 1
If x 2 Rn and y 2 Rn are row vectors (so that the transpose yT is
a column vector), and if A D .aij / is a real n  n matrix, then

A 2-form on Rn is a bilinear form on Rn that is also antisymmetric (or skew-
symmetric) in the sense that for every .x; y/ 2 Rn  Rn,
.y; x/ D .x; y/:
The set of all such 2-forms on Rn is denoted ƒ2.Rn/ and is a vector space.
EXAMPLE 2
Let  and  be two 1-forms on Rn, (i.e.,  and  belong to

ˇˇˇˇ D .x/ .y/  .y/ .x/
is bilinear and antisymmetric, and so is a 2-form on Rn. (This follows at once from
properties of the determinant.) The symbol ^ is called a wedge product. This wedge
product is a function of two vectors. (Later we will encounter wedge products that have
more than two arguments.) For example, in terms of elementary 1-forms,
.dxi ^ dxj /.x; y/ D

ˇˇˇˇ D xiyj  xj yi:
Note that the antisymmetric property of the wedge product implies that  ^ D 0
(the zero 2-form) for any  2 ƒ1.Rn/.
Let  2 ƒ2.Rn/, and let x D Pn
iD1 xiei and y D Pn
j D1 yj ej belong to Rn. If
aij D .ei; ej /, then the numbers aij satisfy aji D aij and aii D 0; that is, the
matrix .aij / is antisymmetric. Therefore, we have, using the bilinearity of ,

Moreover, if P

then, taking x D ei and y D ej , we obtain aij D 0 for all choices of i and j satisfying

While we have been explicitly stating the functional dependence on two vectors x and

the result correspond to if we regard the three basis vectors above as corresponding to

C a2b1 dx2 ^ dx1 C a2b2 dx2 ^ dx2 C a2b3 dx2 ^ dx3

D .a2b3  a3b2/ dx2 ^ dx3 C .a3b1  a1b3/ dx3 ^ dx1

The coefﬁcients here are those of the cross product of a D a1i C a2j C a3k and
b D b1i C b2j C b3k in R3. Thus, the wedge product mapping of ƒ1.R3/  ƒ1.R3/
into ƒ2.R3/ corresponds to the cross product mapping of R3  R3 into R3.
Remark
Note that n D 3 is a unique case in that it is the only one with the bases for
ƒ2.Rn/ and ƒ1.Rn/ having the same dimension. In a sense, this is what makes cross
products possible in R3.
k-Forms
DEFINITION
4
A k-form on Rn is a multilinear antisymmetric functional  deﬁned on the
Cartesian product .Rn/k D Rn  Rn      Rn (k factors Rn). That is, 
maps .Rn/k into R and satisﬁes the two conditions:
(a) multilinearity: .v1; : : : ; vk/ is linear in each of the vectors vi with the
others held ﬁxed.
.v1; : : : ; vi1; .au C bw/; viC1; : : : ; vk/
D a.v1; : : : ; vi1; u; viC1; : : : ; vk/
C b.v1; : : : ; vi1; w; viC1; : : : ; vk/
for all real numbers a and b and vectors u and w in Rn, and
(b) antisymmetry: if any two arguments of  have their positions switched,
the value of  changes sign.
.v1; : : : ; vi; : : : ; vj ; : : : vk/ D .v1; : : : ; vj ; : : : ; vi; : : : vk/:
The vector space of all k-forms on Rn is denoted ƒk.Rn/.
If k > 2, we need to extend the notion of antisymmetry to allow for exchanges involv-
ing more than two arguments. We call a rearrangement of the numbers f1; 2; 3; : : : ; kg
a permutation. Such permutations can always be constructed by successive reversals
of pairs of the numbers. The reversal .i; j / exchanges the numbers i and j (where
j ¤ i). Every permutation can be expressed as a “product of reversals.” For example,
the permutation  that maps f1; 2; 3g to f2; 3; 1g can be written as  D .1; 3/.1; 2/;
observe that f1; 2; 3g D .1; 3/.1; 2/f1; 2; 3g D .1; 3/f2; 1; 3g D f2; 3; 1g, that is, 
ﬁrst switches 1 and 2 (producing f2; 1; 3g) and then switches 1 and 3 to get f2; 3; 1g.
This use of sgn to denote the
sign for an even or odd
permutation should not be
confused with the signum
function of Section P.5, neither
should , the permutation, be
confused with the number .
Of course, such a representation is not unique; it is also true that  D .1; 3/.2; 3/.
However, if a permutation  can be expressed as a product of an even (or odd) number
of reversals, then all ways of expressing it as a product of reversals will involve an even
(or odd) number, and we say that the permutation itself is even (or odd). Accordingly,
we deﬁne the sign of the permutation  as
sgn ./ D
 1
if  is an even permutation
1
if  is an odd permutation.
It follows that the antisymmetry property of a k-form  can be generalized as follows:
if  is any permutation of the numbers f1; 2; : : : ; kg, then

We can now extend the deﬁnition of the wedge product to allow for k factors. Let
dxi be the 1-form introduced earlier in this section: dxi.x/ D xi for all x 2 Rn. We
deﬁne the elementary k-forms

Remark
While the above formula makes sense for all positive integers k, the result-
ing determinant will be zero if k > n. Since there are only n distinct 1-forms dxi, if
k > n at least two of the subscripts i1; i2; : : : ; ik will be equal and so the determinant
will have at least two identical rows. The same applies for k  n; if any two of the
factors in dxi1 ^ dxi2 ^    ^ dxik are identical, then the wedge product is the zero
k-form.
Remark
For k  n, let the numbers i1; i2; : : : ; ik satisfy 1  i1 < i2 <    < ik 
n. If  is a permutation of those numbers, then
dx.i1/ ^ dx.i2/ ^    ^ dx.ik/ D sgn ./ dxi1 ^ dxi2 ^    ^ dxik:
As observed earlier for 2-forms, the collection of all wedge products of the form dxi1 ^
dxi2 ^    ^ dxik, where i1; i2; : : : ; ik satisfy 1  i1 < i2 <    < ik  n, constitute

using the bases of ƒk.Rn/ and ƒ`.Rn/. If

The result is a .k C `/-form. Any terms on the right side for which one of the dxi’s is

Assuming that , 1, and 2 are k-forms, that  is an `-form, that

Forms on a Vector Space
Everything said above about forms on Rn can be applied to any n-dimensional real
vector space provided we redeﬁne the elementary forms so that dxi.v/ selects the
ith component of the vector v 2 V with respect to some particular basis of V: For
our purposes, we will be mainly interested in the case where V is an m-dimensional
subspace of Rn, where m < n. In this case, it is possible to restrict the elementary
forms dxi1 ^    ^ dxik in ƒk.Rn/ so that they apply only to vectors in V: In this
restriction, there will generally be fewer independent forms, because ƒk.V / will have
smaller dimension

Differential Forms and the Exterior Derivative
Just as we extended the notion of vector to deﬁne vector ﬁelds as vector-valued func-
tions of position in a domain in R2 or R3, so we can also extend the notion of k-form to
deﬁne k-form ﬁelds as k-form-valued functions of position in a domain in Rn. These
ﬁelds will be called differential forms.
DEFINITION
5
For k  1, a differential k-form on a domain D (an open set) in Rn is a
smooth function ˆ from D into ƒk.Rn/. Thus, for each x 2 D, ˆ.x/ is a
k-form on Rn that can be expressed as a linear combination of the the
 n
k

standard basis vectors of ƒk.Rn/. The coefﬁcients of this linear combination
(i.e., the coefﬁcients of ˆ.x/) will be smooth real-valued functions of x:

A differential 0-form on D is a smooth real-valued function f on D.
For simplicity, we take “smooth” to mean that the coefﬁcients have continu-
ous partial derivatives of all orders (or at least all orders we need to calculate
in a given situation).
For k  0, we denote the set of all differential k-forms on D by Fk.D/.

The wedge product of k-forms extends in the obvious way (pointwise on D) to
differential k-forms with the added requirement that if f is a differential 0-form on D,
then f ^ ˆ D f ˆ for any differential k-form ˆ; the coefﬁcients of f ^ ˆ are just the
coefﬁcients of ˆ multiplied by f: Observe that for any two differential forms ˆ and ‰,
and any differential 0-form f; we have
.f ˆ/ ^ ‰ D f .ˆ ^ ‰/ D ˆ ^ .f ‰/:
The Exterior Derivative
The following deﬁnition is central to the study of differential forms; in a sense it jus-
tiﬁes our use of the symbols dxi in the bases of the spaces of k-forms, and the use of
the term “differential k-form” to describe a form-ﬁeld.
DEFINITION

The exterior derivative of a differential 0-form (that is, a function) f on
domain D  Rn is the differential 1-form df given by
df .x/ D
n
X
iD1
@f
@xi
dxi:
In ordinary calculus “d” denotes
the differential of a function (i.e.,
of a 0-form). Here we have
extended “d” to apply to any
differential form to give a new
form of one higher order. Do not
confuse “d” with “D,” which
can represent a derivative in
ordinary calculus.

SECTION 17.2:

It is worth stressing that the exterior derivative of a differential 0-form f coincides
with the ordinary differential of f: The coefﬁcients of df are just those of the gradient

illustrating again that a 1-form on Rn is just a dot product with a ﬁxed vector. But it is

is something completely new.

Properties of the exterior derivative
If ˆ and ‰ are differential k-forms and  is a differential ` form on domain D  Rn,
and if a and b are real numbers, then
(a) d.aˆ C b‰/ D a dˆ C b d‰; that is, the operator d is linear from Fk.D/ into
FkC1.D/.
(b) d.ˆ ^ / D .dˆ/ ^  C .1/k ˆ ^ .d/; (a Product Rule).
(c) d 2ˆ D d.dˆ/ D f0g, the zero differential form. That is, d 2 D 0.
d 2f D ddf makes no sense in
terms of classical differentials. It
is only in the context of wedge
products and differential forms
that d 2 makes sense. d 2 maps
every differential k-form to the
zero .k C 2/-form.
PROOF
The proofs of parts (a) and (b) are elementary and left as exercises for the
reader. For (c) we proceed as follows. If ˆ is a differential k-form, then ˆ.x/ is a sum
of terms of the form a.x/ dxi1 ^ dxi2 ^ : : : ^ dxik. By part (a), it is sufﬁcient to prove
that d 2ˆ is zero for any one such term. We have
d 2 a.x/ dxi1 ^ dxi2 ^ : : : ^ dxik D d

Remark
The power of wedge products and exterior derivatives begins to become
evident in the above proof, which holds only if the d-operator has been applied twice
to a differential form. It is clear that the exterior derivative of a general differential
form is not necessarily zero. We will, of course, have dˆ D 0 if ˆ is a differential
n-form on Rn. (Why?)
EXAMPLE 2
Let ˆ D F1 dx CF2 dy CF3 dz belong to F1.R3/. Calculate and
simplify dˆ. What does the result correspond to if we identify
ˆ with the vector ﬁeld F D F1i C F2j C F3k and the differential 2-form dˆ with
the vector ﬁeld having components that are the coefﬁcients of dy ^ dz, dz ^ dx, and
dx ^ dy?

The ﬁrst of these is the Maxwell relation from Example 4 of Section 12.8. The other
two are additional relations not previously mentioned because Maxwell relations are
traditionally used for ﬁxed N; but they are no less valid.
1-Forms and Legendre Transformations
As we saw in Chapter 12, thermodynamic variables come in conjugate pairs. For
S, V; and N in the energy 1-form in Example 4, T; P; and  are the respective
conjugate variables. A conjugate variable is deﬁned here as the function in front of
the differential of that variable that ensures the product has a positive sign. In Section
12.6 we found that Legendre transformations, such as F D E  TS, led to 1-forms in
a new quantity, which was the exterior derivative of a 0-form in a new set of variables.
Clearly,
dF D dE  T dS  S dT D S dT  P dV C  dN;
so that F is a function of T; V; and N; instead of S, V; and N: The conjugate variables
are now S, P; and . Note that the Legendre transformation introduces a sign
change for the new conjugate variable. See Section 12.6 for details.
Once we realize that, we can use Legendre transformations of E to construct a dif-
ferential 0-form that depends on any three of the six variables S, V , N , T , P , and 
that we may choose, provided the three chosen variables do not include a variable and
its conjugate (and we account for the sign change due to Legendre transformations).
It is easy to generate any of the many Maxwell relations using the properties of the
wedge product and the exterior derivative. Note that it is only necessary to know that
the differential 0-form exists and how many variables have been swapped between in-
dependent variables and conjugate variables, not what the new function is speciﬁcally,
because d 2 will eliminate it. d 2 D 0 helps explain why thermodynamic potentials,
as these Legendre transformations of energy are known, are better understood for their
properties under differential operations than for their actual values.
Deducing more Maxwell relations employing wedge products and exterior deriva-
tives is a topic for the exercises.

CHAPTER 17
Differential Forms and Exterior Calculus
Maxwell’s Equations Revisited
James Clerk Maxwell is most famous for his four differential equations governing elec-
tromagnetism, which are known as Maxwell’s equations and are described in Section
16.6. These are not to be confused with the Maxwell relations of thermodynamics.
Maxwell’s equations are four partial differential equations in the magnetic ﬁeld vector
B and the electric ﬁeld vector E:
r  E D 
0
r  B D 0J C 1
c2
@E
@t
r  B D 0
r  E D @B
@t ;
where  and J are charge density and charge current density (i.e., current per unit area)
respectively, 0 and 0 are constants, and c D 1=p00 is the speed of light.
EXAMPLE 5
Consider the two 2-forms constructed from the six components of
B and E within R4 (known in physics as “space-time”) as follows:
F DBx dy ^ dz C By dz ^ dx C Bz dx ^ dy C Ex dx ^ dt C Ey dy ^ dt
C Ez dz ^ dt
G DEx
c2 dy ^ dz C Ey
c2 dz ^ dx C Ez
c2 dx ^ dy  Bx dx ^ dt  By dy ^ dt
 Bz dz ^ dt
Show that the equation dF D 0 is equivalent to the last two Maxwell equations above.
The ﬁrst two Maxwell equations are related to G in a somewhat more complicated
way. (See Exercise 17 for the details, and Exercise 18 for further implications of this
approach.)

C Ez dz ^ dt

D
@Bx
@t dt C @Bx
@x dx C @Bx

@z dz

^ dy ^ dz C : : :
There are six such terms in total. In each case only two terms in the brackets will sur-
vive when wedged with the associated 2-form because no wedge factors are repeated.
Grouping the surviving terms, we obtain only four distinct 3-forms in the expansion of
dF; namely,
@Bx
@x C @By
@y C @Bz
@z

dx ^ dy ^ dz C

The coefﬁcients for the respective 3-forms vanish if the latter two of Maxwell’s equa-
tions hold. The ﬁrst coefﬁcient vanishes because r  B D 0 while the remaining three
represent the components of r  E C @B=@t. Thus, the latter two Maxwell equations
are equivalent to dF D 0. The remaining two Maxwell equations can be expressed in
the form dG D H, where H will be determined in Exercise 17.
Closed and Exact Forms
A differential k-form ˆ is said to be closed if dˆ D 0 (the zero .k C 1/-form).
Depending on the context, closed forms are analogous to irrotational or solenoidal
vector ﬁelds. Since d 2 D 0, every exterior derivative is a closed form.

SECTION 17.2:
Differential Forms and the Exterior Derivative
977
A differential k-form ˆ is exact if ˆ D d‰ for some .k  1/-form ‰. For k D 1,
exact forms are analogous to conservative vector ﬁelds.
Every exact differential form is closed. Depending on the domain of the form, the
converse of this statement may or may not be true. It is true for a smooth differential
k-form (where k  1) deﬁned on a domain in Rk that can be shrunk to a point. We will
not attempt to prove this here. A slightly weaker version is stated below for star-like
domains. (See the discussion following Theorems 4 and 5 in Section 16.2.)

elementary 2-forms from which F and G are constructed
form a basis in the six-dimensional vector space of 2-forms in
4 variables, show that the vectors F and G, having the same

satisfy F  G D 0. Thus, F and G are orthogonal, and in this
sense the ﬁrst two of Maxwell’s equations listed above

independent of, the remaining two.

Integration on Manifolds
This section introduces the language of manifolds. It also introduces parametrizations
to link integrals of differential forms to speciﬁc iterated integrals. While the concepts
of vector calculus were adequate for extending the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
to functions in R2 and R3, they do not lend themselves to higher-dimensional problems.
The natural setting for integration in Rn (which we will not encounter until Section
17.4) is the integral of a differential k-form ˆ over a k-dimensional manifold M:
This is a departure from notation
in classical integral calculus
because the “d” is hidden in ˆ.

A brief discussion of manifolds in Rn and their tangent and normal spaces was given
in Section 13.4. We amplify this further here.
Smooth Manifolds
The graph of a function f from Rm into Rn is the set of all points .x; y/ 2 Rm  Rn D
RmCn satisfying y D f.x/. The graph is smooth if all ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of
all n components of f exist and are continuous. (See Section 12.6 for a brief discussion
of such functions.)
We need to introduce a general term like “manifold” because terms like “curve”
and “surface,” which worked in three or fewer dimensions, do not encompass all the
smooth objects in higher dimensions. Roughly speaking, a smooth manifold of dimen-
sion k in Rn (where k  n) is a subset M of Rn that is locally the graph of a smooth
.n  k/-vector-valued function of k variables. Let us make this more precise.
DEFINITION
7
A subset M of Rn is a smooth manifold of dimension k  n, or, more
simply, a k-manifold in Rn, if for every point x 2 M there exists an open set
U in Rn containing x, and a smooth function f from U into Rnk, such that
the following two conditions hold:
i) the part of M inside U is speciﬁed by the equation f.x/ D 0, and
ii) the linear transformation from Rn into Rnk given by the Jacobian matrix
(see Section 12.6)

EXAMPLE 1
(a) The graph y D f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ of a smooth real-valued
function f is a smooth n-manifold in RnC1, that is, a smooth
hypersurface in RnC1.
(b) An open set M in Rn is a smooth n-manifold in Rn. Since M is open, we can
take U D M and use the trivial function f .x/ D 0 from M \ U into f0g, the
zero-dimensional subspace of Rn.
(c) Although x1=3 is not a smooth function on R, the curve y D x1=3 is a smooth
1-manifold in R2 because it coincides with the curve x D y3, and y3 is a smooth
function on R.
(d) The sphere S with equation x2 C y2 C z2 D 1 is a smooth 2-manifold in R3. Any
point on the sphere is the centre of an open ball U whose radius is sufﬁciently
small that the projection of U onto at least one of the coordinate planes, say the
plane x D 0, lies inside S. The intersection U \ S will then be given by one of
the two equations x D ˙
p
1  y2  z2 and will be smooth.
There are two ways a smooth k-manifold M in Rn can be described:
Strictly speaking, the two ways
of describing smooth manifolds
given at the right need only apply
locally to pieces of the manifold
rather than to the manifold as a
whole. More about this in the
next section.
(a) By requiring that its points x D .x1; : : : ; xn/ satisfy a set of n  k independent
equations in .x1; : : : ; xn/:
f.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ D 0;
where
f D .f1; f2; : : : fnk/:
This was the method used to describe the constraint manifold in Section 13.4.
Each equation represents an .n  1/-dimensional surface in Rn and so reduces the
dimension by 1. The equations are independent if the gradients r.fi/, .1  i 
n  k/ are linearly independent at every point x 2 M. In this case, the dimension
will be reduced by n  k and so it will be k.
(b) By using a parametrization, that is, a mapping x D p.u/ from an open set U  Rk
into Rn that satisﬁes
(i) p.u/ is one-to-one from U onto M, and
(ii) the linear transformation from Rk into Rn with Jacobian matrix

is one-to-one. (See Section 12.6. This condition requires that the n  k ma-
trix J.u/ have k linearly independent columns for each u 2 U .) Later in
this section we will relax these conditions to allow slightly less restrictive
parametrizations to be used for integration purposes.
Both descriptions have their good and bad features. For the equations description,
it is easy to check whether a given point lies on the manifold, but hard to ﬁnd a point
on it. For the parametric description, it is easy to ﬁnd points on the manifold but hard
to check whether a given point lies on it.
EXAMPLE 2
Consider the two equations f .x; y; z/ D x2 C z2  1 D 0 and
g.x; y; z/ D x C y C z  1 D 0 in R3. Since r.f / D 2xi C 2zk
and r.g/ D i C j C k are never linearly dependent, the two equations deﬁne a smooth
manifold of dimension 3  2 D 1, that is, a smooth curve in R3. (If you think about it
for a moment, you will realize that this curve is an ellipse.)

Since all the partials in J are continuous, the transformation is smooth. Since all but
one of them is positive on the square .0; 1/  .0; 1/, it is easily seen that the trans-
formation is one-to-one; different points .u1; u2/ in the square give different points in
R4. Finally, since the last two rows of J are linearly independent for every .u1; u2/,
the range of the linear transformation Dp.u/ having matrix J is a two-dimensional
subspace of R4. Thus, the range of the transformation is a 2-manifold in R4.
At every point x on a smooth k-manifold M in Rn there will exist a k-dimensional
tangent space Tx.M/ consisting of all vectors in Rn that are tangent to M at x, and
also an .n  k/-dimensional normal space Nx.M/ consisting of all vectors in Rn that
are normal to the tangent space, and therefore to M at x.
For a manifold speciﬁed by nk equations fi.x/ D 0, 1  i  n  k, the normal

For manifolds speciﬁed by a parametrization x.u/, the tangent space at x is spanned

BEWARE!
In the rest of this
section, we are going to revert to the
classic approach (from Chapter 14)
to multiple integrals of functions as
limits of Riemann sums and extend
them to Rn. In so doing we will be
writing volume elements dVn as
though they had meaning as
differentials, which they do not. In
Section 17.4, we will climb back on
the wagon and properly deﬁne the
integral of a differential form over a
manifold.
Integration in n Dimensions
The deﬁnition of a double integral given in Section 14.1 (or a triple integral in Section
14.5) can be extended to integrals of real-valued functions f .x/ D f .x1; x2; : : : ; xn/
over suitable domains in Rn. First, we consider the rectangular domain R D fx 2 Rn W
ai  xi  bi; 1  i  ng, which we consider to have n-volume …n
iD1.bi  ai/. If
f is continuous on R, we deﬁne the integral of f over R to be the limit of a suitable
Riemann sum:
Z
R
f .x/ dVn D lim
N
X
iD1
f .xi/ voln.Ri/;
where the sum is taken over a partition of R into N subrectangles Ri of volume
voln.Ri/ and xi is a point in Ri. The limit is taken as N ! 1 in such a way that
the maximum dimension of the hyperrectangles Ri approaches zero. Note that we use

a single integral sign rather than an n-fold one, which is rather too awkward.
If f is deﬁned in a domain D  Rn that is “sufﬁciently nice,” we can ﬁnd a
hyperrectangle R containing D and deﬁne

where Of is deﬁned to be f .x/ if x 2 D and 0 otherwise. Even if f is continuous on D,
it will likely be discontinuous on the boundary @D of D, so “How nice is sufﬁciently
nice?” is a question that will have to be answered.
Some simple integrals over domains in Rn can be evaluated by the technique of
iteration used to evaluate double and triple integrals in Chapter 14.

SECTION 17.3:
Integration on Manifolds
981
The “n-volume element” dVn that we warned about in this chapter’s introduction,
is also written as dx or dx1 dx2 : : : dxn sometimes. The latter notation is perhaps
even more unsatisfactory than dVn, as it suggests the differential of a vector, which it
certainly is not. However, it does indicate what variables are being integrated, which is
useful in this context. Another popular alternative (never used in this book, including
here) is to write d nx. This also has its problems, as we are not speaking of an n-fold
exterior derivative of x.

Sets of k-Volume Zero
We are used to manifolds having zero area in R2 (e.g., curves) or zero volume in R3
(e.g., curves and surfaces). In higher dimensions we have no such classical terminol-
ogy for describing the “volume” of manifolds or their subsets, that may be zero in
higher dimensional spaces. Accordingly, we make the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION
8
Sets of k-volume zero in Rn
Let 1  k  n. For each positive integer m,
let Qm be a partition of Rn into n-dimensional cubes each having edge length
1=2m. If S is a bounded subset of Rn we say that S has k-volume 0 if
lim
m!1
X
Q2Qm
Q\S¤;
1
2km D 0:
The sum is taken over only those cubes Q 2 Qm that contain points of S.
If S is unbounded, let Sr D fx 2 S W jxj  rg. We say that S has
k-volume zero if Sr has k-volume zero for every positive r.
It can be shown that a smooth m-manifold in Rn has k-volume 0 provided m < k  n.
If the boundary @D of a bounded open set D  Rn is a smooth .n1/-manifold in
Rn, then @D has n-volume zero and will contribute nothing to the integral of a function
f continuous on the closed, bounded set D [@D. Thus,
R
D f .x/ dVn will exist in this
case.
Parametrizing and Integrating over a Smooth Manifold
In order to deﬁne integrals over a smooth k-manifold M in Rn, where k < n (such
as, for example, curves in R2 and R3, and surfaces in R3), we need to parametrize
the manifold using a smooth, one-to-one mapping from an open set in Rk onto M.
This approach generalizes the technique used to evaluate line and surface integrals in
Chapter 15.
Unfortunately, the deﬁnition of parametrization given earlier in this section is a
bit too restrictive; it rules out, for example, the parametrization x D cos u cos v, y D
cos u sin v, z D sin u, 0  u  ,  < v   of the sphere x2 C y2 C z2 D 1 in
R3. We can ﬁx this by slightly easing the restrictions on parametrizations as follows.

CHAPTER 17

DEFINITION

Smooth parametrization of a manifold
Let M  Rn be a smooth k-manifold in Rn. Let U be a subset of Rk having
boundary @U with k-volume 0. Let S be a subset of U with k-volume 0 such
that U  S D fx 2 U W x … Sg is open in Rk. Suppose p is a mapping from
U into Rn satisfying the following conditions:
(i) p.S/ has k-volume 0,
(ii) M  p.U /,
(iii) p.U  S/  M,
(iv) p is one-to-one and differentiable on U  S, and
(v) the derivative Dp.u/ is one-to-one from Rk onto the tangent space Tp.u/.M/.
Then we say that p is a smooth parametrization of M over U; and that it is
a strict parametrization over U  S.
These conditions are satisﬁed for the parametrization of the unit sphere in the para-
graph preceding the deﬁnition if we take U D f.u; v/ W 0  u  ;  < v  g
and S D f.u; v/ W u D 0 or u D  or v D g.
As was done for surface integrals in Section 15.5, we can evaluate an integral
of a function f .x/ of n variables deﬁned on a k-manifold M in Rn by transforming
it into an integral of a function of k variables over a domain in Rk. We do this by
using a smooth parametrization x D p.u/. A differential volume element dVk.u/ D
du1 du2 : : : duk at point u 2 Rk is a k-dimensional rectangular box with corner at u
spanned by the vectors du1 e1, du2 e2    duk ek. The derivative Dp.u/ transforms
this volume element to a k-dimensional parallelogram in the tangent space Tp.u/.M/,
the k-volume of which provides the volume element dVk

Orientations, Boundaries, and Integration of Forms
Oriented Manifolds
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, it was the fact that an interval on the real line
has a natural orientation (left to right) that enabled us to formulate the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus for functions of one variable. We now examine how to specify
the orientation of a manifold.
DEFINITION
11
If V is a k-dimensional vector space, then any nonzero k-form ! on V de-
ﬁnes an orientation for V: Any k-dimensional vector space has only two
orientations. Since ƒk.V / is one dimensional, any nonzero k-form on V will
be a multiple of ! by a nonzero real number, either positive or negative. The
positive multiples of ! provide the same orientation for V as !; the negative
multiples provide the opposite orientation for V:
For example, ! D dx1 ^ dx2 ^    ^ dxn provides an orientation for Rn that gives the
value C1 to the standard basis e1; e2; : : : ; en. If n D 3, this orientation is shared by
any basis satisfying the “right-hand-rule.” (See Section 10.1.) We usually refer to the
orientation of Rn given by ! as the “positive” orientation.
The tangent space Tx.M/ at any point x on a smooth, k-manifold M in Rn is
itself a k-dimensional vector subspace of Rn and so has one of two possible orienta-
tions. If we can select a nonzero k-form on each such subspace in a way that varies
smoothly with x, they will constitute a smooth k-form ﬁeld on M, which then orients
the manifold.

SECTION 17.4:
Orientations, Boundaries, and Integration of Forms
985
DEFINITION
12
Suppose that at each x on the k-manifold M, there exists a nonzero k-form
!x that varies smoothly with x and orients the tangent space Tx.M/, then we
say that M is orientable and that the differential k-form ﬁeld !.x/ D !x
orients M.
EXAMPLE 1
(Orienting a curve in Rn)
A smooth curve (1-manifold) C in
Rn is orientable if there exists a nonvanishing, smoothly varying
tangent vector ﬁeld t.x/ on C. Since the tangent space Tx.C/ is one-dimensional, the
differential 1-form whose value at any x on C and any v 2 Rn is given by !.x/.v/ D
t.x/  v orients C. It speciﬁes the positive direction of C at x as the direction of t.x/.
The opposite (negative) direction would be speciﬁed by the nonvanishing tangent ﬁeld
t.x/.
EXAMPLE 2
(Orienting a hypersurface in Rn)
A smooth .n  1/-manifold
M in Rn (also called a hypersurface) is orientable if there exists a
nonvanishing, smoothly varying normal vector ﬁeld n.x/ on M. For instance, if M is
speciﬁed by the single equation g.x/ D 0, and grad g.x/ ¤ 0 anywhere on M, then
n.x/ D grad g.x/ can provide an orientation for M. Since the tangent space Tx.M/ to
M at x has dimension n  1, any n  1 linearly independent vectors v1, v2, : : : , vn1
in Tx.M/ will be perpendicular to n, and the differential .n  1/-form

An open set M in Rn is an
n-manifold. At any point x 2 M, the tangent space Tx.M/ D

When we say that an oriented
point is Cx or x, we don’t
intend the orientation signs “C”
or “” to mean scalar multi-
plication of the vector x by 1 or

value of a function f at Cx is

case choosing an orientation comes down to choosing a sign to attach to the point. One
orientation of x is Cx; the opposite orientation is x.
Not every smooth manifold is orientable. The Möbius band illustrated in Section
15.6 has only one side and is not orientable.
The following example illustrates how you can orient a k-manifold M in Rn, where
1 < k < n  1. The idea is to ﬁnd a basis of n  k vectors for the normal space at an
arbitrary point x on M and use them to deﬁne a differential k-form that orients M.

At any point x satisfying the two equations, the vectors grad f D e1 C e3

Pieces-with-Boundary of a Manifold
The extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (the Generalized Stokes’s The-
orem) that we will develop in the next section relates the integral of the exterior deriva-
tive dˆ of a differential .k  1/-form ˆ over a subset M of an oriented
k-manifold in Rn to the integral of ˆ over the suitably oriented boundary @M of S:
R
M dˆ D
R
@M ˆ. We must now clarify some of these terms, in particular, the kind of
set M must be to enable the evaluation of integrals over its boundary. Boundaries of
open sets can be very pathological, and we will have to restrict them somehow.
A manifold M in Rn does not itself contain any boundary points, but a subset M
of M can have a boundary contained in M. Speciﬁcally, the boundary @M of M
in M consists of all points x 2 M such that every open set U  Rn containing x
also contains points y ¤ x in M and points y ¤ x that are in M but not in M. The
boundary may or may not be a subset of M.
EXAMPLE 5
(a) The sphere x2 C y2 C z2 D 1 in R3 (a smooth 2-manifold) has
no boundary, but its upper hemisphere (the subset H of the
sphere where z  0) has a boundary @H consisting of all points on the circle
x2 C y2 D 1, z D 0. For this example, the boundary is a smooth manifold of
dimension 1, and H contains its boundary.
(b) All of R2 is a 2-manifold M in R2. It has no boundary, but the square subset
Q D f.x; y/ 2 R2 W 0  x  1; 0  y  1g does have a boundary. @Q consists
of all points on the four edges of square. This boundary is not a smooth manifold,
but if we omit the four corners of the square, each of the remaining straight line
segments is a one-dimensional manifold in R2. Again, @Q  Q.

SECTION 17.4:
Orientations, Boundaries, and Integration of Forms
987
It would be nice if we only had to deal with boundaries that are smooth, but such an
assumption is too restrictive for our purposes.
DEFINITION
13
Smooth and nonsmooth boundary points
Let M be a subset of a
k-manifold M in Rn. A point x on the boundary @M is a smooth bound-
ary point of M if there exists an open set U  Rn containing x, a smooth
function f mapping U into Rnk, and a smooth function g mapping U into R,
such that:
(i) M \ U D fy 2 U W f.y/ D 0g,
(ii) M \ U D fy 2 U W f.y/ D 0
and
g.y/  0g, and
(iii) If h.x/ D

f.x/; g.x/

, then Dh.x/ maps Rn onto RnkC1.
The set of all smooth boundary points of M constitutes the smooth boundary
of M: The points of @M that are not smooth boundary points constitute the
nonsmooth boundary of M:
Remark
The smooth boundary of a subset M of a smooth k-manifold in Rn consists
of one or more smooth .k  1/-manifolds in Rn.
DEFINITION
14
A piece-with-boundary of a k-manifold M in Rn is a closed (in Rn) subset
M of M satisfying
(i) the nonsmooth part of the boundary of M has .k  1/-volume zero,
and
(ii) for every point x 2 @M; there is an open set U  Rn such that
fy 2 @M \ U g has ﬁnite .k  1/-volume.
Evidently, both of the subsets in Example 5 above are pieces-with-boundary of their
respective manifolds. The smooth boundary of the hemisphere in part (a) is the whole
circle.1 The smooth boundary of the square region in part (b) consists of the four sides
of the square excluding the corner points, which are nonsmooth boundary points.
The tangent space to the smooth boundary @M of a piece-with-boundary M of
k-manifold M at x is a .k  1/-dimensional subspace of the k-dimensional tangent
space to M at x. Therefore, there exists a one-dimensional space that is tangent to M
at x but normal to @M at x. This normal space is spanned by grad g.x/, where g is
the function in the deﬁnition of smooth boundary. Since g.x/ D 0 and g.y/  0 for
y 2 M, grad g.x/ is a normal pointing into M and grad g.x/ is an outward pointing
normal. (Note that condition (iii) of Deﬁnition 13 guarantees that grad g.x/ ¤ 0.) We
always use an outer normal to orient the smooth boundary of M; describing the result
as the orientation inherited from the orientation of M:
DEFINITION
15
Inherited orientation of the smooth boundary
If M is a piece-with-bound-
ary of an oriented (by !) k-manifold in Rn, the .k  1/-dimensional
smooth boundary of M inherits the orientation @! given by the differential
.k  1/-form
@!.x/.v1; : : : ; vk1/ D !.x/.n.x/; v1; : : : ; vk1/;
where n.x/ is a normal ﬁeld on the smooth part of @M that points out of M:
We have already seen this situation when considering Green’s Theorem in R2, Stokes’s
Theorem in R3, and the Divergence Theorem in both R2 and R3 in Chapter 16. The
following examples conﬁrm that the deﬁnition above gives the same result as the ori-
entations used there.
1 Like some other terms used here, “piece-with-boundary” was introduced by John
and Barbara Hubbard in their text Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential
Forms, 2nd ed., Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.

A region R in R2 bounded by one or more piecewise smooth

If we assume that R2 is oriented by the 2-form ! D dx ^ dy so that !.i; j/ D 1,
then !.n; t/ will be positive whenever n is an outward (from R) normal to C and t is
a tangent to C in the direction of the orientation of C. See Figure 17.1. The positive
direction of C given by t is 90ı counterclockwise from the outward normal.

Let S be a smooth surface (2-manifold) in R3. Let n D n1i C

If S is a piece-with-boundary of S having smooth boundary consisting of pieces of
curves (1-manifolds), the boundary @S inherits the orientation given by the differential
1-form @!.x/.v/ D !.x/.nout; v/, where nout is an outward (from S) normal to the
smooth boundary at x, and v is tangent to that boundary. It follows that @!.x/.v/ is
the value of the 3  3 determinant whose columns, in order, are the components of the
normal ﬁeld n orienting S, the components of nout (which is tangent to S but normal to

the vectors n, nout, and v form a right-handed triad, so the boundary orientation is such
that if we stand erect on the smooth boundary of S (head upward in the direction of n)
facing out of S (i.e., in the direction of nout), then the positive direction of the boundary
of S will be to our left. See Figure 17.2.
EXAMPLE 8
Consider a cube Q in R3 with the standard orientation given by
! D dx ^dy ^dz. @Q consists of 6 square faces (smooth bound-
ary) and 12 edges together with their endpoints (nonsmooth boundary). Each square
face is oriented with an outward normal n inherited from !. In turn, each square face
induces an orientation on its four edges. That orientation is counterclockwise as seen
from a point outside the cube in the direction of the normal for that face. Note that
every edge of the cube is part of the smooth boundary of two of the square faces, and
those faces induce opposite orientations on that edge. See Figure 17.3. This “can-
cellation” suggests the observation that the boundary of a boundary of a piece-with-
boundary is empty.

Observe that the sum of the front and back orientations is 0. A similar situation holds
for the sum of the orientations of the left and right side square faces, and the top and
bottom square faces. See Exercise 1 and Exercise 2.

989
When the smooth boundary of a piece-with-boundary of a smooth, oriented
k-manifold consists of several disjoint pieces-with-boundary of .k  1/-manifolds,
together with some nonsmooth sets where these .k  1/-dimensional pieces join in
pairs, as is the case in Example 8, it is useful to write the smooth boundary as a “sum”
of these disjoint pieces, each with its proper orientation, given by a C or  sign.
EXAMPLE 9
Denote by Qky.he1; : : : ; hek/ the k-cube in Rk having edge length
h > 0, one corner at y, and spanned by the given multiples of
the standard basis vectors in Rk. (This is by analogy with the deﬁnition of a k-par-
allelogram given in Deﬁnition 10.) The cube shown in Figure 17.3 is Q3
0.hi; hj; hk/.
The cube Qky.he1; : : : ; hek/ has smooth oriented boundary consisting of 2k cubes of
dimension .k  1/ oriented by the direction of their outward normals. The boundary
cubes come in pairs of opposite ones; for example, the pair with normals ˙ej are

to move the normals Cej and ej into the missing positions in these orientations so
they are consistent with the standard positive orientation ! of Rk and, therefore, of the
given k-cube. Accordingly, the smooth oriented boundary of Qky.he1; : : : ; hek/ can

Integrating a Differential Form over a Manifold
As we did for functions in Section 17.3, we are going to deﬁne the integral of a smooth
differential k-form over a smooth k-manifold in Rn by using a parametrization of the
manifold over a set in Rk. Now, however, the orientation of the manifold must be
preserved by the parametrization.
DEFINITION
16
Orientation-preserving parametrizations
Let M  Rn be a smooth
k-manifold in Rn oriented by the differential k-form !.x/. Suppose p is a
smooth parametrization of M over a subset U  Rk, and that it is strict on
U  S where S  U has k-volume zero (as speciﬁed in Deﬁnition 9 in

The Generalized Stokes’s Theorem
The previous four sections have developed much new machinery: forms and differen-
tial forms, the exterior derivative, manifolds and their boundaries and orientations, and
integrals of functions and differential forms over manifolds and their boundaries. This

992
CHAPTER 17

has all been done with one ultimate goal in mind—namely, the provision of a general-
ized version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that holds and appears the same
in any number of dimensions. Without further ado, here it is.

The Generalized Stokes’s Theorem (GST)

where @M has the orientation inherited from M. It is understood that the boundary
integral is really taken over the smooth part of the boundary @M:
Remark
While we will not prove this theorem in its full generality here, we will
prove it for a signiﬁcant special case from which the general case can, with some
effort, be deduced. We will also give a somewhat handwaving argument that should
convince you of the validity of the general case. Then we will show how the major
theorems of vector calculus are all special cases of the Generalized Stokes’s Theorem.
Remark
The requirement that M be bounded is not necessarily restrictive. If M
is the union of nonoverlapping, bounded pieces-with-boundary of M, we can add the
results of the theorem applied to the individual pieces to get the integral of dˆ over the
whole piece. Where two pieces abut along parts of their boundaries, those parts will
have opposite orientations inherited from M, so their contributions to the sum of the
boundary integrals will cancel, leaving only the contributions from the parts that are
part of the boundary of the union. If M is unbounded but the sums taken over those
bounded pieces contained in the ball of radius r in Rn approach limits as r ! 1, the
GST will still hold for M:

Let us conﬁrm that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus really is a special

Remark
Although the proof above was carried out for a k-cube in Rk, the result
extends to a k-cube in Rn. If the cube is spanned by k mutually perpendicular unit
vectors, an invertible linear transformation of coordinates in Rn can be found that maps
those vectors to the ﬁrst k basis vectors e1, : : : , ek so that the coordinates of x 2 Q
satisfy xi D constant in Q for i > k. If ˆ is a .k  1/-form on Q, its coefﬁcients
will not vary with those coordinates, and those of its exterior derivative dˆ will be a
multiple of dx1 ^    ^ dxk.

If the coefﬁcients of the differential .k  1/-form ˆ are smooth, and if, for

Completing the Proof
While we will not give a detailed proof of the GST here, we will make several obser-
vations about extending the proof to wider classes of domains.
(a) The proof above extends with minimal change to k-dimensional rectangles.
(b) An invertible linear transformation can map a k-parallelogram in Rn to a k-cube,
so the GST holds for k-parallelograms.
(c) Let M be a piece-with-boundary of a k-manifold.
If M is a union of non-
overlapping k-cubes (or k-rectangles), then
R
M dˆ will be the sum of the inte-
grals over those cubes. However, where two such cubes abut along parts of their
smooth boundaries, they induce opposite orientations, so that those contributions
to the boundary integral of ˆ will cancel and the sum of the integrals over the
boundaries of the cubes will reduce to the boundary integral on @M: This sug-
gests that we can approximate M by nonoverlapping cubes of small edge length h
and obtain

The error in the ﬁrst approximation in ./ approaches 0 as h ! 0 because the
number of cubes near the boundary grows of order h.n1/, while the volume of
each decreases of order hn. The error in the second approximation in ./ cannot
be similarly argued to decrease with h because the .k  1/-volumes of the uncan-
celled parts of the boundaries of the cubes may remain relatively larger than the
.k  1/-volume of @M. However, we can exploit the assumed smoothness of ˆ
to compensate for this. Expanding (the coefﬁcients of) ˆ in Taylor series about
a point y near the boundary @M we obtain ˆ.x/ D ˆ0.y/ C O.jx  yj/ for x
near y. If we can ﬁll the region between @M and the set of cubes used above to
approximate
R
M dˆ with convex sets of diameter of order h abutting the cubes
and numbering of order h.n1/, and use the fact that the integral of ˆ0 over the
boundary of such convex sets is zero (see Exercise 8 in the previous section), we
can still have the error in the second approximation decreasing of order h.
(d) Strict parametrization
Let U be an open set in Rk and let x D p.u/ be a one-to-
one, orientation-preserving parametrization over U of a subset of M containing
the closed piece-with-boundary M. Suppose that M D p.Q/, where Q is a
closed k-cube in U with edges parallel to the standard basis vectors in Rk, and
that @M D p.@Q/. If ˆ is a smooth differential .k  1/-form on M, then

Introduction
A differential equation (or DE) is an equation that in-
volves one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
Solving a differential equation means ﬁnding functions that satisfy the differential
equation. The presence of derivatives routinely leads to nonunique solution functions.
Typically, but not necessarily, they exist as families of functions deﬁned by free param-
eters (or even free functions when partial derivatives are involved). As speciﬁc values
of the parameters must be set to select one solution, such families have an inﬁnite
number of solutions. These parameters do not appear in the originating differential
equations themselves. For example, we already know that antiderivatives differ from
each other, each deﬁned by a particular integration constant. If G0.t/ D g.t/, then
x D G.t/ C c, involving the integration constant c, implies the simple differential
equation
dx
dt D g.t/:
Conversely, the integration constant can be eliminated by differentiation of the general
solution, x D G.t/ C c, where c is an arbitrary constant. The general solution is
a collection of all solutions of the differential equation. Any particular choice of c
produces a particular solution.
A differentiable family of functions implies a differential equation. For another
example, x D c1t C c2t2, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, implies the differ-
ential equation
t2
2
d 2x
dt2  t dx
dt C x D 0;

1000
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
as can be seen by differentiating x twice with respect to t, solving the resulting equa-
tions for c1 and c2, and substituting back into the given expression for x. The fam-
ily of solutions requires two values to identify any one particular solution in this
case. More generally, a family of functions could have n arbitrary constants x D
f .t; c1; c2; : : : ; cn/; implying a differential equation involving all derivatives up to or-
der n, which is then described as nth-order DE.
We know that capturing the movements of an object along the x-axis as time t
increases using a differential equation requires knowing the position, x, and the veloc-
ity, dx=dt, both at a given time. That sets two distinct values, c1 and c2, to select a
particular solution from any differential equation that captures that movement. Thus,
the differential equation describing motion (the equation of motion) will be second
order no matter what else. That is so in Newtonian mechanics, where the differential
equation for x, from Newton’s Second Law, is
md 2x
dt2 D F.t/;
where d 2x=dt2 is acceleration, and m is the mass of the object subjected to a force,
F.t/.
If one needs only one value to ﬁx what the future will be, then the differential
equation will be ﬁrst order. For example, suppose that only the biomass, m, at some
instant needs to be known in order for m to be determined for all time t, then a ﬁrst-
order differential equation is implied. If, further, we suppose that the rate of growth is
proportional to the biomass, a speciﬁc ﬁrst-order equation follows,
dm
dt D km.t/;
which is the differential equation of exponential growth (or, if k < 0, exponential
decay).
The arbitrary constants in solution families may seem on ﬁrst encounters with
differential equations like a nuisance arising while searching for speciﬁc answers. But
their distinctive character yields striking ﬂexibility. It allows precise expressions for
universal laws while simultaneously allowing for local speciﬁcations external to the
equation. This extraordinary combination allows a universal but precise ﬂexibility that
makes differential equations central to any human hopes to predict the future, because
if we have the true equation of motion and we are given all needed conditions at the
start (initial conditions), we will know the future via the particular solution satisfying
those conditions. Applied to the natural world in total this becomes a form of precise
determinism famously articulated by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the beginning of the
nineteenth century. While complications have arisen for the Laplacian picture since
then, it was not because of these properties of differential equations.
Differential equations with initial conditions would be enough to make this topic
central to modern science in and of itself, but if we set the conditions at different times
or (better) different places, the problem becomes known as a boundary-value problem
and the conditions are known as boundary conditions. This structure becomes the
mathematical backbone of quantum mechanics, let alone structures of all kinds from
physics to engineering. Alan Turing’s quip (quoted at the beginning of the chapter)
starts to make sense: the differential equation is the structure discovered by science,
and the boundary conditions are external to it.
Indeed, most of the existing mathematical literature is either directly involved with
differential equations or is motivated by problems arising in the study of such equa-
tions. Because of this, we have introduced various differential equations, terms for
their description, and techniques for their solution at several places throughout this
book, as they naturally arise in the development of calculus. This ﬁnal chapter brings
these concepts together, uniting them in a full introductory treatment of ordinary dif-
ferential equations. Some material from earlier sections (notably Sections 7.9 and 3.7)
forms a natural part of this chapter; you will be referred back to these sections at ap-
propriate times.

SECTION 18.1:
Classifying Differential Equations
1001
18.1
Classifying Differential Equations
Differential equations are classiﬁed in several ways. The most signiﬁcant classiﬁcation
is based on the number of variables with respect to which derivatives appear in the
equation. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is one that involves derivatives
with respect to only one variable. Both of the examples given above are ordinary
differential equations. A partial differential equation (PDE) is one that involves
partial derivatives of the unknown function with respect to more than one variable.
For example, the one-dimensional wave equation
@2u
@t2 D c2 @2u
@x2
models the lateral displacement u.x; t/ at position x at time t of a stretched vibrating
string. (See Section 12.4.) We will not discuss partial differential equations in this
chapter.
Differential equations are also classiﬁed with respect to order. The order of a
differential equation is the order of the highest-order derivative present in the equation.
The one-dimensional wave equation is a second-order PDE. The following example
records the order of two ODEs.
EXAMPLE 1
d 2y

Like any equation, a differential equation can be written in the form F D 0, where
F is a function. For an ODE, the function F can depend on the independent variable
(usually called x or t), the unknown function (usually y), and any derivatives of the
unknown function up to the order of the equation. For instance, an nth-order ODE can
be written in the form
F.x; y; y0; y00; : : : ; y.n// D 0:
An important special class of differential equations consists of those that are linear.
An nth-order linear ODE has the form
an.x/y.n/.x/ C an1.x/y.n1/.x/ C   
C a2.x/y00.x/ C a1.x/y0.x/ C a0.x/y.x/ D f .x/:
Each term in the expression on the left side is the product of a coefﬁcient that is a func-
tion of x, and a second factor that is either y or one of the derivatives of y. The term
on the right does not depend on y; it is called the nonhomogeneous term. Observe
that no term on the left side involves any power of y or its derivatives other than the
ﬁrst power, and y and its derivatives are never multiplied together.
A linear ODE is said to be homogeneous if all of its terms involve the unknown
function y, that is, if f .x/ D 0. If f .x/ is not identically zero, the equation is non-
homogeneous.
EXAMPLE 2
In Example 1 the ﬁrst DE, d 2y
dx2 C x3y D sin x, is linear. Here,
the coefﬁcients are a2.x/ D 1, a1.x/ D 0, a0.x/ D x3, and the
nonhomogeneous term is f .x/ D sin x. Although it can be written in the form

CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
the second equation is not linear (we say it is nonlinear) because the second term
involves the square of a derivative of y, the third term involves the product of y and
one of its derivatives, and the fourth term is not y times a function of x. The equation
.1 C x2/d 3y
dx3 C sin x d 2y
dx2  4dy
dx C y D 0
is a linear equation of order 3. The coefﬁcients are a3.x/ D 1 C x2, a2.x/ D sin x,
a1.x/ D 4, and a0.x/ D 1. Since f .x/ D 0, this equation is homogeneous.
The following theorem states that any linear combination of solutions of a linear,
homogeneous DE is also a solution. This is an extremely important fact about lin-
ear, homogeneous DEs.

then y D y1.x/ C y2.x/ is also a solution of the same linear, nonhomogeneous
equation.
We will make extensive use of the two theorems above when we discuss second-order
linear equations in Sections 18.4–18.6.
EXAMPLE 3

y00 C 4y D 0. A similar calculation shows that y D cos 2x also satisﬁes the DE. Since
the DE is linear and homogeneous, the function
y D A sin 2x C B cos 2x
is a solution for any values of the constants A and B. We want y.0/ D 2, so we need
2 D A sin 0 C B cos 0 D B. Thus, B D 2. Also,
y0 D 2A cos 2x  2B sin 2x:
We want y0.0/ D 4, so 4 D 2A cos 0  2B sin 0 D 2A. Thus, A D 2 and the
required solution is y D 2 sin 2x C 2 cos 2x.
Remark
Let Pn.r/ be the nth-degree polynomial in the variable r given by
Pn.r/ D an.x/rn C an1.x/rn1 C    C a2.x/r2 C a1.x/r C a0.x/;
with coefﬁcients depending on the variable x. We can write the nth-order linear ODE
with coefﬁcients ak.x/, .0  k  n/, and nonhomogeneous term f .x/ in the form
Pn.D/y.x/ D f .x/;
where D stands for the differential operator d=dx. The left side of the equation above
denotes the application of the nth-order differential operator
Pn.D/ D an.x/Dn C an1.x/Dn1 C    C a2.x/D2 C a1.x/D C a0.x/
to the function y.x/. For example,
ak.x/Dky.x/ D ak.x/d ky
dxk :
It is often useful to write linear DEs in terms of differential operators in this way.
Remark
Unfortunately, the term homogeneous is used in more than one way in the
study of differential equations. Certain ODEs that are not necessarily linear are called
homogeneous for a different reason than the one applying for linear equations above.
We will encounter equations of this type in Section 18.2.

18.2
Solving First-Order Equations
In this section we will develop techniques for solving several types of ﬁrst-order ODEs,
speciﬁcally,
1. separable equations,
2. linear equations,
3. homogeneous equations, and
4. exact equations.
Most ﬁrst-order equations are of the form
dy
dx D f .x; y/:
Solving such differential equations typically involves integration; indeed, the process
of solving a DE is called integrating the DE. Nevertheless, solving DEs is usually more
complicated than just writing down an integral and evaluating it. The only kind of DE
that can be solved that way is the simplest kind of ﬁrst-order, linear DE that can be
written in the form
dy
dx D f .x/:
The solution is then just the antiderivative of f :
y D
Z
f .x/ dx:
Separable Equations
The next simplest kind of equation to solve is a so-called separable equation. A
separable equation is one of the form
dy
dx D f .x/g.y/;
where the derivative dy=dx is a product of a function of x alone times a function of y
alone, rather than a more general function of the two variables x and y.
A thorough discussion of separable equations with examples and exer-
cises can be found in Section 7.9; we will not repeat it here. If you have
not studied that material, please do so now.

SECTION 18.2:
Solving First-Order Equations
1005
First-Order Linear Equations
A ﬁrst-order linear differential equation is one of the type
dy
dx C p.x/y D q.x/;
where p.x/ and q.x/ are given functions, which we assume to be continuous. The
equation is homogeneous (in the sense described in Section 18.1) provided that q.x/ D
0 for all x. In that case, the given linear equation is separable,
dy
y D p.x/ dx;
which can be solved by integrating both sides. Nonhomogeneous ﬁrst-order linear
equations can be solved by a procedure involving the calculation of an integrating
factor.
The technique for solving ﬁrst-order linear differential equations, along
with several examples and exercises, can be found in Section 7.9. If you
have not studied that material, please do so now.
First-Order Homogeneous Equations
A ﬁrst-order DE of the form
dy
dx D f
y
x

is said to be homogeneous. This is a different use of the term homogeneous from that
in the previous section, which applied only to linear equations. Here, homogeneous
refers to the fact that y=x, and therefore g.x; y/ D f .y=x/ is homogeneous of degree
0 in the sense described after Example 7 in Section 12.5. Such a homogeneous equation
can be transformed into a separable equation (and therefore solved) by means of a
change of dependent variable. If we set
v D y
x ;
or equivalently
y D xv.x/;
then we have
dy
dx D v C x dv
dx ;
and the original differential equation transforms into
dv
dx D f .v/  v
x
;
which is separable.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve the equation

Solution
The equation is homogeneous. (Divide the numerator and denominator of
the right-hand side by x2 to see this.) If y D vx the equation becomes

The solution is best expressed in the form x2  y2 D C4. However, near points where
y ¤ 0, the equation can be solved for y as a function of x.
Exact Equations
A ﬁrst-order differential equation expressed in differential form as
M.x; y/ dx C N.x; y/ dy D 0;
which is equivalent to dy
dx D M.x; y/
N.x; y/ , is said to be exact if the left-hand side is the
differential of a function .x; y/:
d.x; y/ D M.x; y/ dx C N.x; y/ dy:
The function  is called an integral function of the differential equation. The level
curves .x; y/ D C of  are the solution curves of the differential equation. For
example, the differential equation
x dx C y dy D 0
has solution curves given by
x2 C y2 D C
since d.x2 C y2/ D 2.x dx C y dy/ D 0.
Remark
The condition that the differential equation M dx C N dy D 0 should be
exact is just the condition that the vector ﬁeld
F D M.x; y/ i C N.x; y/ j
should be conservative; the integral function of the differential equation is then the
potential function of the vector ﬁeld. (See Section 15.2.)

SECTION 18.2:
Solving First-Order Equations
1007
A necessary condition for the exactness of the DE M dx C N dy D 0 is that
@M
@y D @N
@x I
this just says that the mixed partial derivatives @2
@x@y and @2
@y@x of the integral function
 must be equal.
Once you know that an equation is exact, you can often guess the integral function.
In any event,  can always be found by the same method used to ﬁnd the potential of a
conservative vector ﬁeld in Section 15.2.
EXAMPLE 2
Verify that the DE
.2x C sin y  yex/ dx C .x cos y C cos y C ex/ dy D 0

Solution
Here, M D 2x C sin y  yex and N D x cos y C cos y C ex. Since
@M
@y D cos y  ex D @N
@x ;
the DE is exact. We want to ﬁnd  so that
@
@x D M D 2x C sin y  yex

Now substitute this expression into the second equation:

1.y/:
Thus, C 0
1.y/ D cos y, and C1.y/ D sin y C C2. (It is because the original DE was
exact that the equation for C 0
1.y/ turned out to be independent of x; this had to happen
or we could not have found C1 as a function of y only.) Choosing C2 D 0, we ﬁnd that
.x; y/ D x2 C x sin y C yex C sin y is an integral function for the given DE. The
solution curves for the DE are the level curves
x2 C x sin y C yex C sin y D C:
Integrating Factors
Any ordinary differential equation of order 1 and degree 1 can be expressed in dif-
ferential form: M dx C N dy D 0. However, this latter equation will usually not be
exact. It may be possible to multiply the equation by an integrating factor .x; y/ so
that the resulting equation
.x; y/ M.x; y/ dx C .x; y/ N.x; y/ dy D 0
is exact. In general, such integrating factors are difﬁcult to ﬁnd; they must satisfy the
partial differential equation

which follows from the necessary condition for exactness stated above. We will not try
to solve this equation here.
Sometimes it happens that a differential equation has an integrating factor depend-
ing on only one of the two variables. Suppose, for instance, that .x/ is an integrating

resents a slope ﬁeld. Such a slope ﬁeld can be represented graphically by drawing
short line segments of the indicated slope at many points in the xy-plane. Slope ﬁelds
resemble vector ﬁelds, but the segments are usually drawn having the same length and
without arrowheads. Figure 18.1 portrays the slope ﬁeld for the differential equation

any rectangle containing .0; 0/ in its interior. The conditions of Theorem 3 are not
satisﬁed, and the initial-value problem has a solution, but not a unique one.
Remark
The unique solution y D .x/ to the initial-value problem ./ guaranteed
by Theorem 3 may not be deﬁned on the whole interval Œa; b
 because it can “es-
cape” from the rectangle R through the top or bottom edges. Even if f .x; y/ and
.@=@y/f .x; y/ are continuous on the whole xy-plane, the solution may not be deﬁned
on the whole real line. For example,

we want to the left of x D 0, but to the right of x D 0 the curve recedes to 1 as
x ! 1. (See Figure 18.2.) It makes no sense to regard the part of the curve to the
right of x D 1 as part of the solution curve to the initial-value problem.

starting at x0. Here, h > 0 (or h < 0) is called the step size of the approximation
scheme. In the remainder of this section we will describe three methods for construct-
ing the approximations fyng:

CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
1. the Euler method,
2. the improved Euler method, and
3. the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.
Each of these methods starts with the given value of y0 and provides a formula for
constructing ynC1 when you know yn. The three methods are listed above in increasing
order of the complexity of their formulas, but the more complicated formulas produce
much better approximations for any given step size h.
The Euler method involves approximating the solution curve y D .x/ by a
polygonal line (a sequence of straight line segments joined end to end), where each
segment has horizontal length h and slope determined by the value of f .x; y/ at the
end of the previous segment. Thus, if xn D x0 C nh, then

Observe that the error at the end of the ﬁrst step is about one-quarter of the error at the
end of the ﬁrst step in part (a), but the ﬁnal error at x D 1 is only about half as large
as in part (a). This behaviour is characteristic of Euler’s method.
If we decrease the step size h, it takes more steps (n D jx  x0j=h) to get from
the starting point x0 to a particular value x where we want to know the value of the
solution. For Euler’s method it can be shown that the error at each step decreases on
average proportionally to h2, but the errors can accumulate from step to step, so the
error at x can be expected to decrease proportionally to nh2 D jx  x0jh. This is
consistent with the results of Example 1. Decreasing h and so increasing n is costly
in terms of computing resources, so we would like to ﬁnd ways of reducing the error
without decreasing the step size. This is similar to developing better techniques than
the Trapezoid Rule for evaluating deﬁnite integrals numerically.

1014
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
The improved Euler method is a step in this direction. The accuracy of the Euler
method is hampered by the fact that the slope of each segment in the approximating
polygonal line is determined by the value of f .x; y/ at one endpoint of the segment.
Since f varies along the segment, we would expect to do better by using, say, the
average value of f .x; y/ at the two ends of the segment, that is, by calculating ynC1
from the formula
ynC1 D yn C hf .xn; yn/ C f .xnC1; ynC1/
2
:
Unfortunately, ynC1 appears on both sides of this equation, and we can’t usually solve
the equation for ynC1. We can get around this difﬁculty by replacing ynC1 on the right
side by its Euler approximation yn Chf .xn; yn/. The resulting formula is the basis for
the improved Euler method.

Observe that the errors are considerably less than one-tenth those obtained in Ex-
ample 1(a). Of course, more calculations are necessary at each step, but the number
of evaluations of f .x; y/ required is only twice the number required for Example 1(a).
As for numerical integration, if f is complicated, it is these function evaluations that
constitute most of the computational “cost” of computing numerical solutions.
Remark
It can be shown for well-behaved functions f that the error at each step
in the improved Euler method is bounded by a multiple of h3 rather than h2 as for
the (unimproved) Euler method. Thus, the cumulative error at x can be bounded by a
constant times jx  x0jh2. If Example 2 is repeated with 10 steps of size h D 0:1, the
error at n D 10 (i.e., at x D 1) is 0:001 323, which is about one-fourth the size of
the error at x D 1 with h D 0:2.
The fourth-order Runge–Kutta method further improves upon the improved
Euler method, but at the expense of requiring more complicated calculations at each
step. It requires four evaluations of f .x; y/ at each step, but the error at each step is
less than a constant times h5, so the cumulative error decreases like h4 as h decreases.
Like the improved Euler method, this method involves calculating a certain kind of
average slope for each segment in the polygonal approximation to the solution to the

The errors here are about 1/500 of the size of the errors obtained with the im-
proved Euler method and about 1/7,000 of the size of the errors obtained with the
Euler method. This great improvement was achieved at the expense of doubling the
number of function evaluations required in the improved Euler method and quadru-
pling the number required in the Euler method. If we use 10 steps of size h D 0:1 in
the Runge–Kutta method, the error at x D 1 is reduced to 6:664 82  107, which is
less than 1/16 of its value when h D 0:2.
Our ﬁnal example shows what can happen with numerical approximations to a solution
that is unbounded.

Little useful information can be read from the Euler results. The improved Euler
results suggest that the solution exists at x D 0:4 and x D 0:8, but likely not at x D 1.
The Runge–Kutta results conﬁrm this and suggest that y.0:4/ D 5=3 and y.0:8/ D 5,
which are the correct values provided by the actual solution y D 1=.1  x/. They also
suggest very strongly that the solution “blows up” at (or near) x D 1.

Differential Equations of Second Order
The general second-order ordinary differential equation is of the form
F

dx ; y; x

D 0
for some function F of four variables. When such an equation can be solved explicitly
for y as a function of x, the solution typically involves two integrations and therefore
two arbitrary constants. A unique solution usually results from prescribing the values
of the solution y and its ﬁrst derivative y0 D dy=dx at a particular point. Such a
prescription constitutes an initial-value problem for the second-order equation.

property that C1y1.x/ C C2y2.x/ D 0 for all x in the interval only if C1 D C2 D 0.

Whenever one solution, y1.x/, of a homogeneous linear second-order equation is
known, another independent solution (and therefore the general solution) can be found
by substituting y D v.x/y1.x/ into the differential equation. This leads to a ﬁrst-order,
linear, separable equation for v0.
EXAMPLE 3
Show that y1 D e2x is a solution of y00 C 4y0 C 4y D 0, and ﬁnd
the general solution of this equation.
Solution
Since y0
1 D 2e2x and y00
1 D 4e2x, we have
y00
1 C 4y0
1 C 4y1 D e2x.4  8 C 4/ D 0;
so y1 is indeed a solution of the given differential equation. To ﬁnd the general solu-
tion, try y D y1v D e2xv.x/. We have
y0 D 2e2xv C e2xv0
y00 D 4e2xv  4e2xv0 C e2xv00:
Substituting these expressions into the given DE, we obtain
0 D y00 C 4y0 C 4y
D e2x.4v  4v0 C v00  8v C 4v0 C 4v/ D e2xv00:
Thus, y D y1v is a solution provided v00.x/ D 0. This equation for v has the general
solution v D C1 C C2x, so the given equation has the general solution
y D C1e2x C C2xe2x D C1y1.x/ C C2y2.x/;
where y2 D xe2x is a second solution of the DE, independent of y1.
By Theorem 2 of Section 18.1, the general solution of the second-order, linear,
nonhomogeneous equation (with f .x/ ¤ 0) is of the form
y D yp.x/ C yh.x/;
where yp.x/ is any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation, and yh.x/ is
the general solution (as described above) of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
In Section 18.6 we will discuss the solution of nonhomogeneous linear equations. First,
however, in Section 18.5 we concentrate on some special classes of homogeneous,
linear equations.

Linear Differential Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
A differential equation of the form
a y00 C b y0 C cy D 0;
./
where a, b, and c are constants and a ¤ 0, is said to be a linear, homogeneous,
second-order equation with constant coefﬁcients.
A thorough discussion of techniques for solving such equations, together
with examples, exercises, and applications to the study of simple and
damped harmonic motion, can be found in Section 3.7; we will not re-
peat that discussion here. If you have not studied it, please do so now.

SECTION 18.5:
Linear Differential Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
1021
We will, however, extend the treatment to cover linear, constant-coefﬁcient differential
equations of higher order.
Constant-Coefﬁcient Equations of Higher Order
Because in most applications of equation ./ the dependent variable represents time,
we will, as we did in Section 3.7, regard y as a function of t rather than x, so that
the prime symbol .0/ denotes the derivative d=dt. The basic result of Section 3.7 was
that the function y D ert was a solution of ./ provided that r satisﬁes the auxiliary
equation
ar2 C br C c D 0:
./
The auxiliary equation is quadratic and can have either
(a) two distinct real roots, r1 and r2 (if b2 > 4ac), in which case ./ has general
solution y D C1er1t C C2er2t,
(b) a single repeated real root r (if b2 D 4ac), in which case ./ has general solution
y D .C1 C C2t/ert, or
(c) a pair of complex conjugate roots, r D k ˙ i! with k and ! real (if b2 < 4ac),
in which case ./ has general solution y D ekt
C1 cos.!t/ C C2 sin.!t/

.
The situation is analogous for higher-order linear, homogeneous DEs with constant
coefﬁcients. We describe the procedure without offering any proofs. If
Pn.r/ D anrn C an1rn1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0
is a polynomial of degree n with constant coefﬁcients aj , (0  j  n), and an ¤ 0,
then the DE
Pn.D/y D 0;
(†)
where D D d=dt can be solved by substituting y D ert and obtaining the auxiliary
equation Pn.r/ D 0. This polynomial equation has n roots (see Appendix II) some
of which may be equal and some or all of which can be complex. If the coefﬁcients
of the polynomial Pn.r/ are all real, then any complex roots must occur in complex
conjugate pairs k ˙ i! (with the same multiplicity), where k and ! are real.
The general solution of .†/ can be expressed as a linear combination of n inde-
pendent particular solutions
y D C1y1.t/ C C2y2.t/ C    C Cnyn.t/;
where the Cj are arbitrary constants. The independent solutions y1, y2, : : : , yn are
constructed as follows:
1. If r1 is a k-fold real root of the auxiliary equation (i.e., if .r  r1/k is a factor of
Pn.r/), then
er1t;
ter1t;
t2er1t;
: : : ;
tk1er1t
are k independent solutions of .†/.
2. If r D a C ib and r D a  ib (where a and b are real) constitute a k-fold pair
of complex conjugate roots of the auxiliary equation (i.e., if Œ.r  a/2 C b2k is a
factor of Pn.r/), then
eat cos bt;
teat cos bt;
: : : ;
tk1eat cos bt;
eat sin bt;
teat sin bt;
: : : ;
tk1eat sin bt
are 2k independent solutions of .†/.

1022
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
Remark
There is a simple explanation for such solutions, even though some treat-
ments make them seem needlessly experimental. They arise because the operator poly-
nomial is factorable, and the factors are commutative,
Pn.D/y D an.D  r1/.D  r2/ : : : .D  rn/y D 0:
Being commutative, any factor, .D rk/, can be placed ﬁrst in the order of application
to y. Thus, if .D  rk/yk D 0, then yk must be a solution and every factor contributes
a solution, Ckerkx. The contributions of each factor are additive, because the operators
are linear. For distinct roots, rk, this captures all possible solutions.
However, for roots occurring m times things are more complicated. Suppose the
root rk appears m times. If yk represents the contributions of these m factors to the
general solution, then

and so uk.t/ must be a polynomial of degree at most m  1: uk.t/ D Pm1.t/erkt:
Similarly, the trigonometric solutions arise from complex roots and Euler’s formula.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve
(a) y.4/  16y D 0 and
(b) y.5/  2y.4/ C y.3/ D 0.
Solution
The auxiliary equation for (a) is r4  16 D 0, which factors down to
.r  2/.r C 2/.r2 C 4/ D 0 and, hence, has roots r D 2, 2, 2i, and 2i. Thus,
the DE (a) has general solution
y D C1e2t C C2e2t C C3 cos.2t/ C C4 sin.2t/
for arbitrary constants C1, C2, C3, and C4.
The auxiliary equation for (b) is r52r4Cr3 D 0, which factors to r3.r1/2 D 0,
and so has roots r D 0; 0; 0; 1; 1. The general solution of the DE (b) is

where C1, : : : , C5 are arbitrary constants.

Solution
The auxiliary equation has degree 7, so the DE is of seventh order. Since
r2 C 4r C 13 D .r C 2/2 C 9, which has roots 2 ˙ 3i, the DE must have the general

Euler (Equidimensional) Equations
A homogeneous, linear equation of the form
ax2 d 2y
dx2 C bx dy
dx C cy D 0
is called an Euler equation or an equidimensional equation, the latter term being
appropriate since all the terms in the equation have the same dimension (i.e., they
are measured in the same units), provided that the constants a, b, and c all have the
same dimension. The coefﬁcients of an Euler equation are not constant, but there
is a technique for solving these equations that is similar to that for solving equations
with constant coefﬁcients, so we include a brief discussion of these equations in this
section. As in the case of constant-coefﬁcient equations, we assume that the constants
a, b, and c are real numbers and that a ¤ 0. Even so, the leading coefﬁcient, ax2,
does vanish at x D 0 (which is called a singular point of the equation), and this can
cause solutions to fail to be deﬁned at x D 0. We will solve the equation in the interval
x > 0; the same solution will also hold for x < 0 provided we replace x by jxj in the
solution.
Let us search for solutions in x > 0 given by powers of x; if
y D xr;
dy
dx D rxr1;
d 2y
dx2 D r.r  1/xr2;
then the Euler equation becomes

ar.r  1/ C br C c

xr D 0:
This will be satisﬁed for all x > 0, provided that r satisﬁes the auxiliary equation
ar.r  1/ C br C c D 0
or, equivalently,
ar2 C .b  a/r C c D 0:
As for constant-coefﬁcient equations, there are three possibilities.
CASE I.
If .b  a/2  4ac, then the auxiliary equation has two real roots:
r1 D a  b C
p
.b  a/2  4ac
2a
;
r2 D a  b 
p
.b  a/2  4ac
2a
:
In this case, the Euler equation has the general solution
y D C1xr1 C C2xr2;
.x > 0/:
The general solution is usually quoted in the form
y D C1jxjr1 C C2jxjr2;
which is valid in any interval not containing x D 0 and may even be valid on intervals
containing the origin if, for example, r1 and r2 are nonnegative integers.

If .ba/2 D 4ac, then the auxiliary equation has one double root, namely,

mation y D xrv.x/ leads to the general solution
y D C1xr C C2xr ln x;
.x > 0/;
or, more generally,
y D C1jxjr C C2jxjr ln jxj;
.x ¤ 0/:

roots:

x˛˙iˇ D e.˛˙iˇ/ ln x D e˛ ln x
cos.ˇ ln x/ ˙ i sin.ˇ ln x/

D x˛ cos.ˇ ln x/ ˙ ix˛ sin.ˇ ln x/:
Accordingly, the Euler equation has the general solution
y D C1jxj˛ cos.ˇ ln jxj/ C C2jxj˛ sin.ˇ ln jxj/:
EXAMPLE 4
Solve the DE x2y00  3xy0 C 13y D 0.
Solution
The DE has the auxiliary equation r.r  1/  3r C 13 D 0, that is, r2 
4r C 13 D 0, which has roots r D 2 ˙ 3i. The DE, therefore, has the general solution
y D C1x2 cos.3 ln jxj/ C C2x2 sin.3 ln jxj/:
Remark
Euler equations can be transformed into constant-coefﬁcient equations by
using a simple change of variable. See Exercise 14 for the details. In terms of the
new variable the operator is factorable, and the factors are commutative, therefore all
solution forms follow according to the previous remark. Transforming the resulting
solutions back in terms of the original variable brings us to the solutions above.

Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations
We now consider the problem of solving the nonhomogeneous second-order differen-
tial equation
a2.x/d 2y
dx2 C a1.x/ dy
dx C a0.x/y D f .x/:
./
We assume that two independent solutions, y1.x/ and y2.x/, of the corresponding
homogeneous equation
a2.x/d 2y
dx2 C a1.x/ dy
dx C a0.x/y D 0
are known. The function yh.x/ D C1y1.x/ C C2y2.x/, which is the general so-
lution of the homogeneous equation, is called the complementary function for the
nonhomogeneous equation. Theorem 2 of Section 18.1 suggests that the general solu-
tion of the nonhomogeneous equation is of the form
y D yp.x/ C yh.x/ D yp.x/ C C1y1.x/ C C2y2.x/;
where yp.x/ is any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation. All we
need to do is ﬁnd one solution of the nonhomogeneous equation, and we can write the
general solution.
There are two common methods for ﬁnding a particular solution yp of the
nonhomogeneous equation ./:
1. the method of undetermined coefﬁcients, and
2. the method of variation of parameters.

1026
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
The ﬁrst of these hardly warrants being called a method; it just involves making an edu-
cated guess about the form of the solution as a sum of terms with unknown coefﬁcients
and substituting this guess into the equation to determine the coefﬁcients. This method
works well for simple DEs, especially ones with constant coefﬁcients. The nature of
the guess depends on the nonhomogeneous term f .x/, but can also be affected by the
solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation. A few examples will illustrate
the ideas involved.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the general solution of y00 C y0  2y D 4x.
Solution
Because the nonhomogeneous term f .x/ D 4x is a ﬁrst-degree polyno-
mial, we “guess” that a particular solution can be found that is also such a polynomial.
Thus, we try
y D Ax C B;
y0 D A;
y00 D 0:
Substituting these expressions into the given DE, we obtain
0 C A  2.Ax C B/ D 4x
or
.2A C 4/x C .A  2B/ D 0:
This latter equation will be satisﬁed for all x provided 2A C 4 D 0 and A  2B D 0.
Thus, we require A D 2 and B D 1; a particular solution of the given DE is
yp.x/ D 2x  1:
Since the corresponding homogeneous equation y00 C y0  2y D 0 has auxiliary
equation r2 C r  2 D 0 with roots r D 1 and r D 2, the given DE has the
general solution
y D yp.x/ C C1ex C C2e2x D 2x  1 C C1ex C C2e2x:
EXAMPLE 2
Find general solutions of the equations (where 0 denotes d=dt)
(a)
y00 C 4y D sin t,
(b)
y00 C 4y D sin.2t/,
(c)
y00 C 4y D sin t C sin.2t/.
Solution
(a) Let us look for a particular solution of the form
y D A sin t C B cos t
so that
y0 D A cos t  B sin t
y00 D A sin t  B cos t:
Substituting these expressions into the DE y00 C 4y D sin t, we get
A sin t  B cos t C 4A sin t C 4B cos t D sin t;
which is satisﬁed for all x if 3A D 1 and 3B D 0.
Thus, A D 1=3 and
B D 0. Since the homogeneous equation y00 C 4y D 0 has general solution
y D C1 cos.2t/ C C2 sin.2t/, the given nonhomogeneous equation has the gen-
eral solution
y D 1
3 sin t C C1 cos.2t/ C C2 sin.2t/:

SECTION 18.6:
Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations
1027
(b) Motivated by our success in part (a), we might be tempted to try for a particular
solution of the form y D A sin.2t/ C B cos.2t/, but that won’t work, because this
function is a solution of the homogeneous equation, so we would get y00 C4y D 0
for any choice of A and B. In this case it is useful to try
y D At sin.2t/ C Bt cos.2t/:
We have
y0 D A sin.2t/ C 2At cos.2t/ C B cos.2t/  2Bt sin.2t/
D .A  2Bt/ sin.2t/ C .B C 2At/ cos.2t/
y00 D 2B sin.2t/ C 2.A  2Bt/ cos.2t/ C 2A cos.2t/
 2.B C 2At/ sin.2t/
D 4.B C At/ sin.2t/ C 4.A  Bt/ cos.2t/:
Substituting into y00 C 4y D sin.2t/ leads to
4.B C At/ sin.2t/ C 4.A  Bt/ cos.2t/ C 4At sin.2t/ C 4Bt cos.2t/
D sin.2t/:
Observe that the terms involving t sin.2t/ and t cos.2t/ cancel out, and we are left
with
4B sin.2t/ C 4A cos.2t/ D sin.2t/;
which is satisﬁed for all x if A D 0 and B D 1=4. Hence, the general solution
for part (b) is
y D 1
4t cos.2t/ C C1 cos.2t/ C C2 sin.2t/:
(c) Since the homogeneous equation is the same for (a), (b), and (c), and the non-
homogeneous term in equation (c) is the sum of the nonhomogeneous terms in
equations (a) and (b), the sum of particular solutions of (a) and (b) is a particular
solution of (c). (This is because the equation is linear.) Thus, the general solution
of equation (c) is
y D 1
3 sin t  1
4t cos.2t/ C C1 cos.2t/ C C2 sin.2t/:
We summarize the appropriate forms to try for particular solutions of constant-coefﬁcient
equations as follows:

The phenomenon illustrated here is called resonance. Vibrating mechanical sys-
tems have natural frequencies at which they will vibrate. If you try to force them to
vibrate at a different frequency, the amplitude of the vibrations will themselves vary si-
nusoidally over time, producing an effect known as beats. The amplitudes of the beats
can grow quite large, and the period of the beats lengthens as the forcing frequency
approaches the natural frequency of the system. If the system has no resistive damp-
ing (the one illustrated here has no damping), then forcing vibrations at the natural
frequency will cause the system to vibrate at ever increasing amplitudes.
As a concrete example, if you push a child on a swing, the swing will rise highest
if your pushes are timed to have the same frequency as the natural frequency of the
swing. Resonance is used in the design of tuning circuits of radios; the circuit is
tuned (usually by a variable capacitor) so that its natural frequency of oscillation is the
frequency of the station being tuned in. The circuit then responds much more strongly
to the signal received from that station than to others on different frequencies.

Requiring yp to satisfy the given nonhomogeneous DE () provides one equation that

Remark
This method for solving the nonhomogeneous equation is called the method
of variation of parameters. It is completely general and extends to higher-order equa-
tions in a reasonable way, but it can be computationally somewhat difﬁcult. We would
not likely have been able to “guess” the form of the particular solution in the above ex-
ample, so we could not have used the method discussed earlier in this section to solve
this equation.
Maple Calculations
Maple has a dsolve routine for solving (some) differential equations and initial-value
problems. This routine takes as input a DE and, if desired, initial conditions for it. We
illustrate for the equation y00 C 2y0 C 5y D 25t C 20 (assuming that the independent
variable is t):
>
DE := (D@@2)(y)(t)+2*D(y)(t)+5*y(t)=25*t+20;
DE WD D.2/.y/.t/ C 2D.y/.t/ C 5y.t/ D 25t C 20
>
dsolve(DE, y(t));
y.t/ D e.t/ sin.2t/ C2 C e.t/ cos.2t/ C1 C 2 C 5t
Note Maple’s use of C1 and C2 for arbitrary constants. For an initial-value problem
we supply the DE and its initial conditions to dsolve as a single list or set argument
enclosed in square brackets or braces:
>
dsolve([DE, y(0)=3, D(y)(0)=-2], y(t));
y.t/ D 3e.t/ sin.2t/ C e.t/ cos.2t/ C 2 C 5t
You might think that this output indicates that y has been deﬁned as a function of t
and you can ﬁnd a decimal value for, say, y.1/ by giving the input evalf(y(1)).
But this won’t work. In fact, the output of the dsolve is just an equation with left
side the symbol y.t/. We can, however, use this output to deﬁne y as a function of t
as follows:
>
y := unapply(op(2,%),t);
y WD t ! 3e.t/ sin.2t/ C e.t/ cos.2t/ C 2 C 5t
The op(2,%) in the unapply command refers to the second operand of the previous
result (i.e., the right side of equation output from the dsolve). unapply(f,t)
converts an expression f to a function of t. To conﬁrm:
>
evalf(y(1));

18.7
The Laplace Transform
Previously we have regarded differentiation, d=dt, as an operation, sometimes denot-
ing it with D placed before a function, F.t/, so that DF.t/ D F 0.t/. Let us now
introduce a similar notation, T , for an integration operation on F.t/ in the form of a
deﬁnite integral
T fF.t/g D
Z b
a
K.s; t/F.t/ dt D f .s/;
called an integral transform or simply a transform of F.t/. The brace brackets
convey the idea that, unlike D, T takes a function in t and returns a function in a
different variable, s. K.s; t/ is known as the kernel of T: T is determined when a, b;
and the kernel K are chosen.
Transforms provide a powerful and systematic way to solve differential equations,
if you have the right transform for the job. The wrong transform can make for very
tough going, or may make no sense at all. There are many different named transforms
in use, such as Laplace, Fourier, Hankel, Mellin, and Radon transforms, to name only a
few. There is a well-known class of linear boundary-value problems, known as Sturm–
Liouville problems, to each of which there corresponds a distinct natural integral trans-
form. By far the best-known transforms are the Laplace and Fourier transforms. They
are appropriate for constant-coefﬁcient linear differential equations and they are close
cousins of each other, differing for the most part in the kinds of problems for which
each is suited.
In this section we are going to examine the Laplace transform, denoted L, for
which K D est; a D 0, and b D 1: The Laplace transform is the tool of choice
for solving initial-value problems for linear DEs, because the ﬁnite lower limit a D 0
automatically brings initial conditions at t D 0 into the calculation, as we will see
below. For Fourier transforms the kernel is also exponential but, since a D 1 and
b D 1, if t were integrated to 1 the improper integral would diverge. We therefore
replace the real variable s with an imaginary variable, eliminating this problem. The
Fourier transform naturally captures boundary-value problems with conditions at 1.
Most initial-value problems involve time, so we choose to use t as the variable of the
function F:
In order for the improper integral deﬁning the Laplace transform of F.t/ to con-
verge, we must restrict F in some way. We say that F is of exponential order if it is
at least piecewise continuous on the interval Œ0; 1/ and satisﬁes
jF.t/j  Kect;
for some positive constants K and c.

SECTION 18.7:
The Laplace Transform
1033
Of course, not every function deﬁned on Œ0; 1/ is of exponential order. For instance,
F.t/ D et2 is not.
DEFINITION

The Laplace Transform
If F.t/ is of exponential order, the Laplace transform LfF.t/g is deﬁned by
LfF.t/g D
Z 1
0
est F.t/ dt D f .s/:
Note that f .s/ exists at least for all s > c, the constant in the exponential
order condition.
Remark
For any transform, T , to be useful for solving differential equations, an
inverse transform T 1 must exist such that
F.t/ D T 1fT fF.t/gg
for suitable classes of functions. For the case of the Laplace transform, L1 exists and
is known:
L1ff .s/g D
1
2i
Z  Ci1
 i1
estf .s/ ds D F.t/:
Calculating L1ff .s/g requires a contour integral in the complex s plane, the speciﬁc
path of which is determined by choosing a real value of  to meet requirements arising
in the theory of complex variables. Such contour integration is beyond the scope of this
book, and it is not needed here. In fact, the integral is rarely ever computed in practice.
All we need to know is that L1ff .s/g exists to justify the following theorem.
T H E O R E M

A Uniqueness Theorem
If F.t/ is piecewise continuous on Œ0; 1/ and f .s/ D
R 1
0 estF.t/ dt exists, then,
except at isolated points where F is discontinuous, F.t/ is uniquely determined by
f .s/ and L1ff .s/g D F.t/ exists.
Remark
The continuity conditions exclude the obvious deviations that could be in-
vented between functions at single points, which cannot be captured by integration.
Some examples will be provided in the exercises.
Remark
Mathematical variables can carry physical units. It is worth noting that
since units concern linear scaling, the nonlinear exponential factor must be unit free.
Thus, st must be unitless or s must have units of t1. Thus, if t has units of time,
then s must have units of frequency. This goes for other transforms, notably Fourier
transforms, too. The physical interpretation of the transformed variable as representing
physical frequencies is of great importance.
Remark
One reason why the Laplace transform is useful for solving linear differen-
tial equations is that L (and its inverse L1) are linear operators:
LfAF.t/ C BG.t/g D ALfF.t/g C BLfG.t/g:

By Theorem 4, the solution of the initial-value problem is y D et.
Several useful observations about using Laplace transforms for solving differential
equations can be made from this solution:
1. The initial conditions are built into the solution process, which differs from strate-
gies that call for the general solution to be found and then reﬁned by initial or
boundary conditions.
2. Since the Laplace transforms of derivatives of the desired solution function y are
expressed in terms of that of y itself and initial values, the process of solving an
initial-value problem reduces to one of solving an algebraic equation for Lfyg.
3. Once we have found Lfyg, we must still ﬁnd y. Since we are not able to calculate
the inverse Laplace transform (even though we know it exists), we must be able
to recognize Lfyg as being the transform of a known function y. To this end, it
is useful to build up a library of known Laplace transforms. A short such library
is provided below and in the Exercises. In the above example, we would not have
known that 1=.s  1/ was the Laplace transform of et unless we were already
aware that the transform of ekt was 1=.s  k/.
4. Laplace transforms exist only for functions of exponential order. For functions that
grow faster than exponential order (either as coefﬁcients or forcing terms in linear
differential equations), we may not be able to use the methods of this section.
Some Basic Laplace Transforms

Since both the cosine and sine functions never grow large, these transforms are valid
for all s > 0.
These straightforward transforms provide the means to solve fairly complex clas-
sical initial-value problems.

The Heaviside Function and the Dirac Delta Function
Recall the Heaviside step function H.x/, which has value 0 if x < 0 and 1 if x  0.
Evidently, its Laplace transform is LfH.t/g D Lf1g D 1=s. Of more interest is the
shifted Heaviside function H.t  a/ for some a > 0. This function does its jump from
0 to 1 at t D a, so it is useful for representing a forcing term in a differential equation
that only comes into play at a positive time t D a > 0, for example, voltage applied to
an electric circuit when a switch is turned on at time a.

So far the properties of Laplace transforms only provide tools for an alternative
approach to solving differential equations. They could as well be solved with methods
from the preceding sections. The result of the previous example may cause you to
wonder whether eas is itself the Laplace transform of some function. The answer
is no—there is no function F.t/ such that LfF.t/g D eas. However, there is a
generalized function (also called a distribution) that ﬁlls the bill. Recall the Dirac
distribution (also called the Dirac delta function, although it is not really a function),
ı.t/, deﬁned in Section 16.1 by the requirement that if f is any function continuous on
a domain containing the open interval .b; c/ and if b < a < c, then
Z c
b
ı.t  a/f .t/ dt D f .a/:
If ı.t/ were actually a function, it would have to be zero whenever t was not zero, and
inﬁnity at t D 0, but no function with these properties can ever have a nonzero integral
over any interval. The Dirac distribution ı.t a/ can model a unit “point mass” located
at point a on a t-axis, or an impulsive force acting over an inﬁnitesimal time interval
at t D a but large enough to suddenly increase the velocity of a unit mass by one unit.
For purposes of Laplace transforms, we want the interval .b; c/ to be .0; 1/. If
a > 0, then the Laplace transform of ı.t  a/ is

Compare this result to that of Example 6 with the constant function F.t/ D 1 for
which LfF.t/g D 1=s:
L fH.t  a/g D esa 1

Thus, since a > 0 implies H.a/ D 0, we have
Lfı.t  a/g D sL fH.t  a/g :
This means that ı.t/ behaves like a derivative of H.t/ in terms of Laplace transform
formulas. (Classically, H 0.0/ does not exist.) It also suggests that one might deﬁne
derivative-like generalized functions that act like a second or higher derivatives. The
Laplace transform provides a new insight into the structure of these singular objects.
The following example illustrates how these properties work in practice.
EXAMPLE 7
Consider a harmonic oscillator consisting of a mass m suspended
from an elastic spring having spring constant k. As shown in Sec-
tion 3.7, the vertical position y.t/ of the mass at time t is governed by the DE
y00 C !2y D f .t/;
where !2 D k=m and f .t/ is an external force per unit mass applied to the mass at
time t. Suppose the mass is at rest at height 0 at time t D 0 and is not acted on by any
net external force. It will then remain at rest. Now suppose that, at time t D a > 0,
a small pellet hits the mass, delivering an upward impulsive force, mı.t  a/, on the
spring. Determine the subsequent height of the mass, y.t/, for t > a.
Solution
Formally, we want to solve the initial-value problem

The same solution would have resulted for t > a if there were no impulse and the
initial conditions were set to y.a/ D 0 and y0.a/ D 1: That is because the impulse at
t D a gave the mass an upward velocity of 1 at that time.

Series Solutions of Differential Equations
In Section 18.5 we developed a recipe for solving second-order, linear, homogeneous
differential equations with constant coefﬁcients:
ay00 C by0 C cy D 0
and Euler equations of the form
ax2y00 C bxy0 C cy D 0:
Many of the second-order, linear, homogeneous differential equations that arise in ap-
plications do not have constant coefﬁcients and are not of Euler type. If the coefﬁcient
functions of such an equation are sufﬁciently well-behaved, we can often ﬁnd solutions
in the form of power series (Taylor series). Such series solutions are frequently used
to deﬁne new functions, whose properties are deduced partly from the fact that they
solve particular differential equations. For example, Bessel functions of order  (Greek
“nu”) are deﬁned to be certain series solutions of Bessel’s differential equation
x2y00 C xy0 C .x2  2/y D 0:
Series solutions for second-order homogeneous linear differential equations are most
easily found near an ordinary point of the equation. This is a point x D a such that
the equation can be expressed in the form
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0;

1042
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
where the functions p.x/ and q.x/ are analytic at x D a. (Recall that a function f is
analytic at x D a if f .x/ can be expressed as the sum of its Taylor series in powers of
x  a in an interval of positive radius centred at x D a.) Thus, we assume
p.x/ D

q.x/ D

X
nD0
qn.x  a/n;
with both series converging in some interval of the form a  R < x < a C R.
Frequently p.x/ and q.x/ are polynomials, so they are analytic everywhere. A change
of independent variable  D x  a will put the point x D a at the origin  D 0, so we
can assume that a D 0.
The following example illustrates the technique of series solution around an
ordinary point.

If x D a is not an ordinary point of the equation
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0;
then it is called a singular point of that equation. This means that at least one of
the functions p.x/ and q.x/ is not analytic at x D a. If, however, .x  a/p.x/ and
.x  a/2q.x/ are analytic at x D a, then the singular point is said to be a regular
singular point. For example, the origin x D 0 is a regular singular point of Bessel’s
equation,

since p.x/ D 1=x and q.x/ D .x22/=x2 satisfy xp.x/ D 1 and x2q.x/ D x22,
which are both polynomials and therefore analytic.
The solutions of differential equations are usually not analytic at singular points.

Ordinary Differential Equations
Substitution into the differential equation produces a quadratic indicial equation, which
determines one or two values of  for which such solutions can be found, and a recur-
rence relation enabling the coefﬁcients an to be calculated for n  1. If the indicial
roots are not equal and do not differ by an integer, two independent solutions can be
calculated. If the indicial roots are equal or differ by an integer, one such solution
can be calculated (corresponding to the larger indicial root), but ﬁnding a second in-
dependent solution (and so the general solution) requires techniques beyond the scope
of this book. The reader is referred to standard texts on differential equations for more

Dynamical Systems, Phase Space, and the Phase Plane
Phase space is a concept originating from classical physics, especially from celestial
mechanics. It provides the setting for representing the movements of a particle (or
many particles) by joining the space of conventional positions (often referred to as
“conﬁguration space”) to the space of momentum coordinates. That is, the three coor-
dinates of position are joined to the three components of momentum so they together
form a 6-D (six-dimensional) phase space. If there are N bodies, then the phase space
can be expanded to consider 6N coordinates, where each particle contributes its own
6-D space. A gas with 1023 atoms (approximately Avogadro’s number) can be seen
as having either a 6-D phase space for each of the 1023 particles, or as one point in a
6  1023-D phase space.
Remarkably, this approach transforms analyzing movement into a problem of
geometry and topology because, in classical physics, knowing the positions and
momenta of all particles at a particular instant of time determines their positions and
momenta at all subsequent times. This concept was most famously articulated by the
French mathematician Laplace (also responsible for the transform in Section 18.7).
Any particle’s positions and momenta now and forever is a known or knowable curve
in phase space. That curve is described as its trajectory (or orbit, echoing the origins
in celestial mechanics). This fuelled a vexing philosophical problem that remains with
us today. If, through physics, we can know where every atom will be forever, based on
what they are all doing now, how can there be any choice? In the twentieth century,
this dilemma was substantially molliﬁed with the emergence of quantum mechanics
and chaos.
As is often the case, this physics reﬂects underlying mathematics, which is the
topic of this section. It can be built up from what we have already seen in this chapter
involving systems of differential equations in the exercises of Section 18.4, ﬁxed points
of dynamical systems in Section 4.1, and properties of vector ﬁelds in Section 15.1.

CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
Phase space analysis opens up a very powerful and general way to look at initial-value
problems of ordinary differential equations of any order, linear or not. Like Section
4.1, these represent dynamical systems, but they are continuous rather than discrete.
A Differential Equation as a First-Order System
A large class of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with independent variable t
and dependent variable x, can be represented in the form
x.n/ D g.t; x; x0; x00; : : : ; x.n1//;
which includes both nonlinear and linear equations, and as such is much more general
than the ﬁrst-order systems arising in the exercises of Section 18.4. This equation
can be represented by a ﬁrst-order system of differential equations in many ways. For
example, the variables y1; y2; : : : ; yn can be assigned to x and its derivatives up to
order n  1 respectively, yielding the ﬁrst-order system

where y D .y1; y2; y3; : : : ; yn/ and f.t; y/ D .y2; y3; y4; : : : ; yn; g.t; y//.
The space formed by the variables .y1; y2; y3; : : : ; yn/ is referred to as the phase
space of the differential equation, extending the classical deﬁnition from physics to
higher-order cases. In phase space, y0 deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld in the sense of Section
15.1. The ﬁeld lines of y0 are the trajectories of the differential equation, oriented in
the direction of increasing t.
EXAMPLE 1
Write the differential equation x000 C 3x0 C ex00x D sin .xt/ as a
ﬁrst-order system using the variable assignments indicated above.
What is the value of n? Write the vectors y 2 Rn and f 2 Rn explicitly.
Solution
The differential equation has order 3; therefore, n D 3. So y 2 R3 and
f 2 R3. Let x D y1, x0 D y2, and x00 D y3. Thus,

Remark
The method for creating a ﬁrst-order system from a higher-order equation
is not unique. However, setting the new variables as the derivatives of the solution of
the higher-order equation has the advantages of being simple, naturally incorporating
initial values, and preserving the historical analogy with physics. Alternative para-
meterizations arise, as will be discussed below. Moreover, ﬁrst-order nonlinear systems
of interest need not lead in any obvious manner to a single higher-order differential
equation.

except that the independent variable in that theorem was called x, while for the system
we are using time t.
Remark
Also, the system variables are depicted in vector font. The vector font ex-
aggerates the differences between the ﬁrst-order equation and the ﬁrst-order system.
To avoid this, modern treatments do not use boldface for vectors. Instead they simply
deﬁne y 2 Rn and f 2 Rn, which fully identiﬁes these quantities as n-dimensional
vectors. It is simply irrelevant to assert the vector properties of a variable with its every
appearance, and it distracts from the properties that are common with scalars. Below
we will ﬁnd that all of the essential properties of the discussion are the same for the
system and the ﬁrst-order equation, so boldface vector notation distracts for these pur-
poses. However, for consistency with the rest of this book, we continue to use it. Do
not be distracted!
Theorem 3 asserts that under certain assumptions about the function f .x; y/, this
initial-value problem has a unique solution, y D .x/, valid for all x in some open
interval containing x0. Moreover, .x/ satisﬁes the integral equation

Remark
Although we have left a full treatment of the existence and uniqueness the-
orem and its proof to more advanced books, it is clear that a large class of differen-
tial equations of any order have much in common with ﬁrst-order equations. Some
structures of ﬁrst-order equations translate directly to any differential equation when
viewed as a ﬁrst-order system. Numerical methods for higher-order differential equa-
tions proceed naturally from the ﬁrst-order formulation as well. No matter what the
order, no matter whether they are linear or nonlinear, they have much in common with
each other. This is quite unexpected when you ﬁrst embark on a study of differential
equations.

1048
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
When f.t; y/ D f.y/ (i.e., f does not depend on t), the system ./ is said to
be autonomous. This is the higher-dimensional version of an “unforced” differential
equation. If autonomous, solutions y.t/ of the initial-value problem ./ are uniquely
deﬁned for all time t, and their trajectories in phase space cannot intersect one another
at any ﬁnite time. But autonomous systems have a more general signiﬁcance than one
might attribute to them at a ﬁrst glance, because all systems can be made autonomous
with an easy but remarkable adjustment. Simply redeﬁne the vectors in ./, such that
y D .y1; y2; y3; : : : ; yn; ynC1/ and f.t; y/ D .y2; y3; y4; : : : ; g.ynC1; y/; 1/,
using the new variable, ynC1 D t, such that y0
nC1 D 1. The revised version of ./ is
now autonomous, but with a decisive difference hidden in the notation: it has a new
phase space with one more dimension.
EXAMPLE 2
Write the differential equation x00 C 3x0 C x2 D sin t as an
autonomous system of ﬁrst-order differential equations.
Solution
Let y1 D x and y2 D x0 to get a ﬁrst-order system in two dimensions that
is nonautonomous. To make it autonomous, deﬁne an additional variable, y3 D t.

which has a 3 (D 2 C 1)-dimensional phase space.
In the following, we will concern ourselves with autonomous systems in a two-
dimensional phase space, because a nonautonomous system is most thoroughly treated
as a three-dimensional autonomous system, while the focus of this section will be two-
dimensional phase spaces.
Generally, existence and uniqueness for any system (adjusted to be autonomous),
in addition to the basic nature of phase space, impose surprisingly restrictive structure
on the trajectories of solutions of DEs:
Solutions, Trajectories, and Phase Space
1. In the unforced (i.e., autonomous) case, the order of a differential equa-
tion is the number of dimensions in its associated phase space.
2. The curve r D y.t/ in phase space (Rn) is a trajectory of the ﬁrst-order
system resulting from parametrization of the given DE. Its tangent vector,
y0.t/ (also in Rn), is given by that ﬁrst-order system itself.
3. With a limited continuity condition (e.g., Theorem 3, Section 18.3 or Lip-
schitz continuity, as above), these trajectories ﬁll phase space because of
existence. For nonlinear equations, without such a condition, trajectories
may be conﬁned within envelopes (violating uniqueness), which exclude
parts of phase space.
4. Because of uniqueness, trajectories never cross each other. Choosing an
initial point determines a unique trajectory through that point and com-
pletely determines the future and past along that trajectory. The com-
ponents of the initial-position vector are constants of motion along that
trajectory.
5. The tangent vectors on trajectories induce a vector ﬁeld for which the
trajectories are streamlines, as discussed in Section 15.1.
Second-Order Autonomous Equations and the Phase Plane
Many essential applications are expressed using second-order differential equations,
giving the n D 2 case special importance. For n D 2, the phase space is known

as the phase plane, and we use u and v to replace the two components y1 and y2
of y. We also consider now only the autonomous version of the ﬁrst-order system and
denote by F.u; v/ and G.u; v/ the two components of f.y/. Thus, the two-dimensional
autonomous system becomes

in phase space (the uv-plane) there exists a

If G=F D u=v, show that solution trajectories in the phase plane

F.u; v/ D u
v determin-
ing slope, we obtain v dv D u du so that v2 C u2 D c2, which is a family of circles
all centred at the origin.
Like all ﬁrst-order systems, ./ provides a direction for trajectories correspond-
ing to increasing t. However, the slopes are not enough to determine this direction
because a sign change in t can be absorbed in the ratio G=F: For instance, consider
the systems

Each has slope ﬁeld v=u, so its trajectories are the circles in Example 3, but for (A)
the orientation of the circles is clockwise in the uv-plane (see Figure 18.6), while for
(B) the orientation is counterclockwise. (To see this, for each system check the signs
of du=dt and dv=dt in, say, the ﬁrst quadrant of the uv-plane.) Both of these systems
are different parametrized versions of the second-order autonomous DE x00 C x D 0,
which, lacking a term with x0, cannot distinguish between t and t.

Trajectories of system (A)
Remark
x00 C x D 0 is the equation for a harmonic oscillator, in this case repre-
senting a linear spring with spring constant 1 and mass 1. As such, it is iconic of
periodic motion. It is fully solved with the methods of preceding sections as a lin-
ear combination of sines and cosines. Thus, circles in the phase plane represent this
periodic motion. In Chapter 17, the vector-like quality of differentials became the heart
of exterior calculus. But this quality is suppressed in a second derivative, so there is
no sense of direction implied by x00 C x D 0. From where then does the orientation
of trajectories in phase space originate? It depends on the choice of parameterization
in ./. An alternative, and equally valid, parameterization can be made that produces a
vector ﬁeld with the opposite orientation. (When oriented, the streamlines are known
collectively as the ﬂow).
Remark
Some ﬁnd this degree of ﬂexibility foreign to their vision of mathematics,
but that reﬂects a misunderstanding. There are many other parameterizations possi-
ble. Some will give, say, ellipses rather than circles or even more convoluted closed
orbits. The resulting trajectories in different phase plane parameterizations are similar
topologically, not metrically.

1050
CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
Fixed Points
Fixed points interrupt the ﬂow because they represent a position where the ﬂow stops
(i.e., u0 D 0 and v0 D 0 for the phase plane in particular), as do ﬁxed points for discrete
maps in Section 4.2. Trajectories must go around them or stop at them (but only in
the limit). Directions of the vector ﬁeld vary as one approaches them along different
paths. They are singularities of the vector ﬁeld in this sense. As such, they are referred
to as singular points by some, but this term is already in use in the preceding sections.
They also go by other names: stationary point, equilibrium point, and more. If two
trajectories approach a common ﬁxed point, uniqueness means that neither actually
reaches the ﬁxed point in any ﬁnite t.
The ﬁxed point is a limit point outside of the ﬂow. Understanding the nature of
solutions becomes a question of studying the nature of ﬁxed points, which come in a
number of varieties generally, and in the phase plane in particular. The connectedness
of the trajectories around ﬁxed points determines key questions about stability, as well
as the structure of the ﬂow, which we call the phase portrait. In the case of u0 D
v; v0 D u, the origin is a ﬁxed point around which the other trajectories seem to
act as orbits. It is a type of ﬁxed point known as a centre. The character of the phase
portrait of this system is determined by the presence of the centre ﬁxed point at the
origin.
To see different ﬁxed points, we introduce the second-order differential equation
for the pendulum, with length equal to gravitational acceleration (i.e., x00 C sin.x/ D
0). We ﬁnd, in addition to a centre, other ﬁxed points that change the overall phase
portrait, except near the origin where sin x  x, recovering the simple harmonic oscil-
lator.
EXAMPLE 4
Convert x00 C sin.x/ D 0 to a ﬁrst-order system and ﬁnd the ﬁxed
points in the phase plane.
Solution
Let x D u and x0 D v, then the ﬁrst order system becomes u0 D v; v0 D
 sin.u/. Fixed points occur along the u axis for u D n where n 2 I.

Figure 18.7 is part of the phase portrait of the pendulum showing three ﬁxed points.
The origin is still a centre, but the other two ﬁxed points .˙; 0/ are known as sad-
dle points. They are limit points of a particular pair of trajectories that separate two
distinct types of behaviours. Each of these two trajectories is known as a separatrix.
The portion of the plane lying between the separatrices has trajectories that represent
classical back and forth oscillations of the pendulum. The trajectories above (or be-
low) both separatrices extend from u D 1 to u D 1 and represent the pendulum
winding around its axis, as a swing does when it goes over the top. This implies that x
is actually an angle and only acts as a spatial displacement by virtue of the scale fac-
tor of the pendulum’s length. The remaining ﬁxed points in the phase plane are simply

centres at .˙2n; 0/ and saddle points at .˙.2n C 1/; 0/ for n D 0; 1; 2; : : : .)
EXAMPLE 5
Repeat the calculation done for the simple harmonic oscillator in
Example 3 for the pendulum, using the slope formula to ﬁnd an
expression relating u and v with one integration constant. This is known as the ﬁrst
integral. Find the value of the integration constant for the trajectories in the eye-
shaped region containing the origin and lying between the separatrices. Show that for
small u, the corresponding formula for the harmonic oscillator is recovered.
Solution
We have dv=du D G=F D  sin.u/=v, so v dv D  sin.u/ du. Thus,
v2=2  cos.u/ D C. For the trajectories with limit points at .˙; 0/ (i.e., the separa-
trices), we must have C D  cos.˙/ D 1. For small u, we have cos.u/ D 1u2=2C
O.u4/. Thus, for the closed trajectories near the origin we have v2 C u2  2.C C 1/.
As jCj < 1 these trajectories approximate circles with radii
p
2.C C 1/ when only
terms up to second degree are retained.
Remark
The ﬁrst integral for both the pendulum and the harmonic oscillator repre-
sent energy in terms of physics. The integration constant amounts to a statement of
conservation of energy. From that standpoint, each trajectory has its own invariant
energy. But any one trajectory is not set by this value alone. A second condition still
must be set to specify a speciﬁc trajectory for a second-order differential equation.
Remark
Not only does the pendulum’s ﬁrst integral go over to the harmonic oscilla-
tor’s ﬁrst integral in the phase plane, but x00 C sin.x/ D 0 becomes x00 C x D 0 when
terms above second order are discarded. This is known as linearization, and it gives
special importance to linear systems when exploring the ﬂow near objects of interest
in the phase plane, such as ﬁxed points.
Linear Systems, Eigenvalues, and Fixed Points
Since any ﬁxed point of a system to DEs can be translated to the origin by a linear
change of variables, and then the DE can be linearized about the origin by discarding
higher-order terms, it is useful to investigate the linearized version of the autonomous
system ./, that is, the linear system

where a, b, c, and d are constants. The origin is the only ﬁxed point of this system.
Classifying the kinds of behaviour ./ can exhibit near the origin can help us determine
the behaviour of more general systems near their ﬁxed points. Although ./ has only
one ﬁxed point by design, it allows us to examine some kinds of phase portraits
around ﬁxed points of many DEs. We must examine the solutions of ./ and can do so

This representation of the general solution of the system gives insight into the types
of ﬁxed points, except for the repeated root case. The structures that emerge are sur-
prisingly rich. Fixed points can be divided into two broad classes: hyperbolic and
nonhyperbolic. This terminology is well established, although it causes confusion
with the saddle point, discussed below. A hyperbolic ﬁxed point in the plane is one
where Re.r1/ ¤ 0 and Re.r2/ ¤ 0. These points are robust under small changes of
the parameters in ./, whereas the centre, as discussed in connection with oscillation,
is nonrobust or fragile. There are three types of hyperbolic ﬁxed points in the plane.
Those three, together with the centre, are the four basic types of ﬁxed points for linear
systems.

SECTION 18.9:
Dynamical Systems, Phase Space, and the Phase Plane
1053
Four important types of ﬁxed points for 2-D linear systems
Centre A centre was shown in Figure 18.6 and Figure 18.7. The eigenvalues of
a centre are purely imaginary, so  < 0 and a C d D 0. Trajectories
around a centre are closed orbits. A centre is not hyperbolic as even
minute changes in a or d can shift the value of a C d away from zero. In
this sense, if the centre arises from a linearization, the ﬁxed point cannot
be guaranteed to represent a centre in the full, unlinearized equations.
Focus
If a C d ¤ 0 and  < 0, the trajectories are not closed. They spiral in
toward or outward from the ﬁxed point, depending on the sign of a C d.
See Figure 18.8(a). Such a ﬁxed point is called a focus. If a C d < 0,
the ﬁxed point is a limit point for trajectories, That is, it is only reached
in the limit as t ! 1. It is said to be a stable or an unstable ﬁxed point
based on whether trajectories approach or recede from the ﬁxed point as
t increases. Unlike a centre, a focus is hyperbolic. Thus, it is robust in
that small changes in a C d, say, do not change the type of ﬁxed point.
Saddle A ﬁxed point is called a saddle if the eigenvalues are real and of opposite
sign (i.e., if  > 0, and r1r2 < 0). This means that one term in ./
shrinks while the other grows. If, say, r1 < 0, we may choose initial
values so that C2 D 0. Then the resulting trajectory in the phase plane
is a straight line with slope p.r1/. Any starting point on it moves to the
ﬁxed point in the limit as t ! 1. The ﬁxed point is called the omega
limit point for this trajectory. Similarly, since r2 > 0, if C1 D 0, then the
trajectory is also a straight line having slope p.r2/, but represents move-
ment away from the ﬁxed point. In this case, the trajectory approaches
the ﬁxed point as t ! 1 and the ﬁxed point is called the alpha limit
point of this trajectory. (Alpha and omega are the beginning and end
letters of the Greek alphabet.)
No other trajectories have the ﬁxed point as a limit point, but all of
them must approach asymptotically both of the straight trajectories as
t ! ˙1. A linear saddle (unlike the nonlinear ones in Figure 18.7) is
depicted in Figure 18.8(b). Saddles are hyperbolic and thus robust, but
unstable, except for the stable asymptotes.
Node
A ﬁxed point is called a node when  > 0 and r1r2 > 0 (while r1 ¤ r2).
The ﬁxed point is either unstable (if both the eigenvalues are positive) or
stable (if both are negative). In contrast to saddles, the ﬁxed point is a
limit point of all trajectories. However, like saddles and foci, nodes are
hyperbolic. Figure 18.9 shows the phase portrait of a node.

trajectories of the stable, counterclockwise

EXAMPLE 7
Suppose that the origin is a node of the linear system ./, either
stable or unstable, and the two eigenvalues of the system satisfy
r1 > r2. Show that the slopes of all trajectories approach the value of p.r/ at one of
the eigenvalues as t ! 1 and approach p.r/ at the other eigenvalue as t ! 1.
Solution
Using the general solution ./ to express the slope of a trajectory:

Since r2  r1 < 0, we have

For a stable node r2 < r1 < 0, so the trajectories approach the node as t ! 1 and
their slopes approach p.r1/ there. For an unstable node 0 < r2 < r1, so the trajectories
approach the node as t ! 1 and their slopes approach p.r2/ there.
Remark
For the unstable node in Figure 18.9, r2 D 1

as t ! 1. The trajectories thus approach the origin tangent to the blue line, which
has slope p.r2/ in the ﬁgure. As t ! 1 the trajectories recede to inﬁnity, with slopes
approaching p.r1/  0:6830, the slope of the green line.
The focus, saddle, and node are the three classes of hyperbolic ﬁxed points. Like the
more well-known centre, the remaining cases are nonrobust transitions between those
robust cases, which will be explored further in the exercises.
Implications for Nonlinear Systems
Linear systems are only a special case. Most nonlinear differential equations have no
known direct solutions, as all known direct techniques fail on them. Even numerical
methods can produce equivocal results. But understanding the nature of objects that
exist in the phase space, their nature as limits for trajectories, and where they are,
helps enormously in detecting errors in numerics, or simply in grasping the nature of
solutions. In the phase plane, nonisolated ﬁxed points lying on continuous curves can
exist. One may have limiting behaviours of trajectories being separatrices “strung”
between ﬁxed points too. But, to complete the possibilities, in the phase plane one
may also have trajectories that have a closed cycle as a limit. This is known as a limit
cycle. There are more possibilities in higher dimensions, such as strange attractors, but
for autonomous systems in the phase plane there is nothing more.

from which it follows that d=dt D 1, and  is increasing at a constant rate. Thus,
some trajectories spiral counterclockwise outward from the origin toward the circle
r D 1 and others spiral counterclockwise inward from inﬁnity toward that circle. The
circle itself is also a trajectory, called a limit cycle, and is a stable limit for the other
trajectories. See Figure 18.10.
The ﬂow near hyperbolic ﬁxed points preserves its topology when linearized.
Thus, knowing linearized behaviours has value for nonlinear cases. But this is not
the case for the nonhyperbolic ﬁxed points.
EXAMPLE 9
Compare the result of Section 15.1 where Liapunov’s direct method
was applied to the vector ﬁeld induced by Van der Pol’s equation,
x00 C .1  x2/x0 C x D 0, to study the stability of the ﬁxed point at the origin.

CHAPTER 18
Ordinary Differential Equations
Thus, a D 0; b D 1; c D 1; d D 1, from which we ﬁnd  < 0 and a C d < 0.
According to the ﬁxed point classes above, this is one of the three hyperbolic types.
The origin of the linear system is a stable focus, and as it is a hyperbolic ﬁxed point,
the topology of the ﬂow is unchanged by linearization. Thus, the eigenvalues of the
linearized system bring us to the same conclusion as Liapunov’s direct method did.
Remark
Note in this case that Liapunov’s direct method does not provide the insight
into the speciﬁc nature of the ﬁxed point that the eigenvalue analysis does in this case.
It is not only stable, but a stable focus.
EXAMPLE 10
Compare the result of Exercise 25 of Section 15.1, where
Liapunov’s direct method was applied to the vector ﬁeld produced
by
u0 D v
v0 D u  vu2;
to study the nature of the ﬁxed point at the origin.
Solution
In Exercise 25 the origin was stable or unstable based on the sign of . The
variables are reassigned x D u, and y D v. Discarding terms of second and higher
order,
u0 D v
v0 D u:
Thus, a D 0; b D 1; c D 1; d D 0, from which we ﬁnd  < 0 and a C d D 0. The
linear system has a centre at the origin. It is not hyperbolic, so the linear system need
not be representative of the nonlinear system’s ﬂow at the origin. It is in fact of no
use in that regard, because the stability, as Liapunov’s direct method shows in Section
15.1, is determined entirely by the nonlinear terms in the differential equation.
Predator–Prey Models
A classic example of the use of phase plane techniques is the analysis of the inter-
action of competing biological populations. As a particularly simple example, consider
an island, covered with grass, having only two species of animals living on it; namely,
rabbits, which eat only grass, and foxes, which eat only rabbits. If the number of rabbits
is much smaller than could be supported by the supply of grass, and if there are no
foxes, the size u.t/ of the rabbit population will grow at a rate proportional to that size
(due to the natural fertility of rabbits). Similarly, if there are no rabbits, the size v.t/ of
the fox population will decrease at a rate proportional to that size, as there is nothing for
the foxes to eat. If both populations are positive, then the interactions between them
might be expected to be proportional to the product u.t/v.t/, the interactions being
unfavourable to the rabbits and favourable to the foxes involved. Thus, the populations
might be governed by a nonlinear system of the form

where a, b, ˛, and ˇ are positive constants. These equations are known as the Lotka–

This nonlinear system has two ﬁxed points: P D .0; 0/ and Q D .˛=ˇ; a=b/. P
corresponds to zero populations of both species. The linearized version of the system
(in which the uv terms are dropped) has matrix A D

P are the u-axis, with alpha limit point at P and the v-axis with omega limit point at
P: We are only interested in the ﬁrst quadrant, where u and v are both positive, and
no trajectory in that region can intersect either of the two axes.

which has purely imaginary eigenvalues  D ˙pa˛ i. For the linearized version, the
system has a centre at Q, but centres are fragile (nonhyperbolic), so we can’t be sure the
original nonlinear system will have a centre at Q. Since no trajectories can cross the
coordinate axes, however, Q cannot be a saddle or a node; it must therefore be either a
centre or a focus. Examining the signs of du=dt and dv=dt in the four subregions into
which the horizontal and vertical lines through Q divide the ﬁrst quadrant, we see that
trajectories appear to circulate around Q in a counterclockwise direction. The slope of
a trajectory at point .u; v/ is given by

ˇa=b  ˛ ln.a=b/ C C D bv C C1. Being concave downward, the graph of the
function ln x can cross the oblique straight line graph of bx C C1 in at most two
points. Therefore, no trajectory of the nonlinear system can cross the vertical line
through Q more than twice, and so Q cannot be a focus. Q is a centre even for the
nonlinear Lotka–Volterra system. Figure 18.11(a) shows part of the phase plane of the
Lotka–Volterra system.

Remark
The Lotka–Volterra model of predator–prey interaction has the disadvan-
tage that if there are no predators, the prey population will grow exponentially to inﬁn-
ity. This is impossible if their food supply (the grass the rabbits eat) is only ﬁnite. We
can correct this problem by using a logistic model for the growth of the rabbit popula-
tion; if the available grass can only feed a maximum of L rabbits, then we can use the
modiﬁed Lotka–Volterra model:

where, again, all the parameters are positive numbers. Figure 18.11(b) shows the more
complicated phase plane structure in this case. Observe there are now two saddle points
and a focus instead of a centre. Exercise 15 below provides a simple example of this
modiﬁed model.
Remark
The correction mentioned above is not unique. Other modiﬁcations may be
just as effective to the stated end. Model designers make no pretense at an exact theory
as one aims at in, say, physics. Such modelling is mathematical artistry. The models
are caricatures drawn in mathematics. One expects many different equation systems
to exhibit qualitatively similar behaviours. There is no expectation that such a model
would ever be able to predict, say, the exact number of predators and prey in any actual
setting. But that does not mean that models are unimportant. On the contrary, the
Lorenz equations are a famous system of differential equations modelling weather. No
one ever expected them to forecast actual weather, but they tell us in a direct manner
why the weather is so difﬁcult to forecast. Similarly, when virologists imagined that
HIV was dormant for many years before turning into AIDS, it was a model system
of differential equations that showed that low HIV amounts did not require dormancy.
Instead, using actual data in a model for virus populations, the system showed very high
activity, not dormancy. That is, small function values do not imply small rates. AIDS
occurred when the body’s resistance ﬁnally gave out. This meant that only multi-drug
treatments could control AIDS, as any single drug therapy would rapidly encounter
drug resistance from HIV. Thus modellers, like Alan Perelson and others who did the
work, have saved many lives through their models.

Many of the problems to which mathematics is applied involve the solution of equa-
tions. Over the centuries the number system had to be expanded many times to provide
solutions for more and more kinds of equations. The natural numbers
N D f1; 2; 3; 4; : : :g
are inadequate for the solutions of equations of the form
x C n D m;
.m; n 2 N/:
Zero and negative numbers can be added to create the integers
Z D f: : : ; 3; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; 3; : : :g
in which that equation has the solution x D m  n even if m < n. (Historically,
this extension of the number system came much later than some of those mentioned
below.) Some equations of the form
nx D m;
.m; n 2 Z;
n ¤ 0/;
cannot be solved in the integers. Another extension is made to include numbers of the
form m=n, thus producing the set of rational numbers
Q D

Every linear equation
ax D b;
.a; b 2 Q;
a ¤ 0/;
has a solution x D b=a in Q, but the quadratic equation
x2 D 2
has no solution in Q, as was shown in Section P.1. Another extension enriches the
rational numbers to the real numbers R in which some equations like x2 D 2 have
solutions. However, other quadratic equations, for instance,
x2 D 1
do not have solutions, even in the real numbers, so the extension process is not com-
plete. In order to be able to solve any quadratic equation, we need to extend the real
number system to a larger set, which we call the complex number system. In this
appendix we will deﬁne complex numbers and develop some of their basic properties.

APPENDIX I
Complex Numbers
Deﬁnition of Complex Numbers
We begin by deﬁning the symbol i, called the imaginary unit,1 to have the property
i2 D 1:
Thus, we could also call i the square root of 1 and denote it
p
1. Of course, i is
not a real number; no real number has a negative square.
DEFINITION
1
A complex number is an expression of the form
a C bi
or
a C ib;
where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit.
For example, 3 C 2i, 7
2  2
3i, i D 0 C i, and 3 D 3 C 0i are all complex
numbers. The last of these examples shows that every real number can be regarded as
a complex number. (We will normally use aCbi unless b is a complicated expression,
in which case we will write a C ib instead. Either form is acceptable.)
It is often convenient to represent a complex number by a single letter; w and z
are frequently used for this purpose. If a, b, x, and y are real numbers, and
w D a C bi
and
z D x C yi;
then we can refer to the complex numbers w and z. Note that w D z if and only if
a D x and b D y. Of special importance are the complex numbers
0 D 0 C 0i;
1 D 1 C 0i;
and
i D 0 C 1i:
DEFINITION
2
If z D x C yi is a complex number (where x and y are real), we call x the
real part of z and denote it Re .z/. We call y the imaginary part of z and
denote it Im .z/:
Re .z/ D Re .x C yi/ D x;
Im .z/ D Im .x C yi/ D y:
Note that both the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are real numbers:
Re .3  5i/ D 3

Graphical Representation of Complex Numbers
Since complex numbers are constructed from pairs of real numbers (their real and
imaginary parts), it is natural to represent complex numbers graphically as points in
a Cartesian plane. We use the point with coordinates .a; b/ to represent the complex
number w D a C ib. In particular, the origin .0; 0/ represents the complex number
0, the point .1; 0/ represents the complex number 1 D 1 C 0i, and the point .0; 1/
represents the point i D 0 C 1i. (See Figure I.1.)

In some ﬁelds, for example, electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted j instead
of i. Like “negative,” “surd,” and “irrational,” the term “imaginary” suggests the distrust that
greeted the new kinds of numbers when they were ﬁrst introduced.

Such a representation of complex numbers as points in a plane is called an Argand
diagram. Since each complex number is represented by a unique point in the plane,
the set of all complex numbers is often referred to as the complex plane. The symbol
C is used to represent the set of all complex numbers and, equivalently, the complex
plane:
C D fx C yi W x; y; 2 Rg :
The points on the x-axis of the complex plane correspond to real numbers (x D x C
0i), so the x-axis is called the real axis. The points on the y-axis correspond to pure
imaginary numbers (yi D 0 C yi), so the y-axis is called the imaginary axis.
It can be helpful to use the polar coordinates of a point in the complex plane.
DEFINITION

The distance from the origin to the point .a; b/ corresponding to the complex
number w D a C bi is called the modulus of w and is denoted by jwj or
ja C bij:
jwj D ja C bij D

DEFINITION

If the line from the origin to .a; b/ makes angle  with the positive direction
of the real axis (with positive angles measured counterclockwise), then we
call  an argument of the complex number w D a C bi and denote it by
arg .w/ or arg .a C bi/. (See Figure I.2.)
The modulus of a complex number is always real and nonnegative. It is positive unless
the complex number is 0. Modulus plays a similar role for complex numbers that
absolute value does for real numbers. Indeed, sometimes modulus is called absolute
value.
Arguments of complex numbers are not unique. If w D a C bi ¤ 0, then
any two possible values for arg .w/ differ by an integer multiple of 2. The sym-
bol arg .w/ actually represents not a single number, but a set of numbers. When we
write arg .w/ D , we are saying that the set arg .w/ contains all numbers of the form
 C 2k, where k is an integer. Similarly, the statement arg .z/ D arg .w/ says that
two sets are identical.
If w D a C bi, where a D Re .w/ ¤ 0, then
tan arg .w/ D tan arg .a C bi/ D b
a:
This means that tan  D b=a for every  in the set arg .w/.

It is sometimes convenient to restrict  D arg .w/ to an interval of length 2, say,
the interval 0   < 2, or  <   , so that nonzero complex numbers will have
unique arguments. We will call the value of arg .w/ in the interval  <    the
principal argument of w and denote it Arg .w/. Every complex number w except 0
has a unique principal argument Arg .w/.

BEWARE!
Review the
cautionary remark at the end of the
discussion of the arctangent function
in Section 3.5; different programs
implement the two-variable
arctangent using different notations
and/or order of variables.
computer spreadsheets and mathematical software packages implement a two-variable
arctan function denoted atan2.x; y/, which gives the polar angle of .x; y/ in the inter-
val .; 
. Thus,
Arg .x C yi/ D atan2.x; y/:
Given the modulus r D jwj and any value of the argument  D arg .w/ of a complex
number w D a C bi, we have a D r cos  and b D r sin , so w can be expressed in
terms of its modulus and argument as
w D r cos  C i r sin :
The expression on the right side is called the polar representation of w.
DEFINITION

The conjugate or complex conjugate of a complex number w D a C bi is
another complex number, denoted w, given by
w D a  bi:

Observe that

arg .w/ D  arg .w/:
In an Argand diagram the point w is the reﬂection of the point w in the real axis. (See
Figure I.4.)
Note that w is real (Im .w/ D 0) if and only if w D w. Also, w is pure imaginary
(Re .w/ D 0) if and only if w D w. (Here, w D a  bi if w D a C bi.)
Complex Arithmetic
Like real numbers, complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and
divided.
Two complex numbers are added or subtracted as though they are two-
dimensional vectors whose components are their real and imaginary parts.

The sum and difference of complex numbers
If w D a C bi and z D x C yi, where a, b, x, and y are real numbers, then
w C z D .a C x/ C .b C y/i
w  z D .a  x/ C .b  y/i:
In an Argand diagram the points wCz and wz are the points whose position vectors
are, respectively, the sum and difference of the position vectors of the points w and
z. (See Figure I.5.) In particular, the complex number a C bi is the sum of the real
number a D a C 0i and the pure imaginary number bi D 0 C bi.
Complex addition obeys the same rules as real addition: if w1, w2, and w3 are
three complex numbers, the following are easily veriﬁed:
w1 C w2 D w2 C w1
.w1 C w2/ C w3 D w1 C .w2 C w3/

difference) of the conjugates:
w C z D w C z:

Multiplication of the complex numbers w D a C bi and z D x C yi is carried out by
formally multiplying the binomial expressions and replacing i2 by 1:
wz D .a C bi/.x C yi/ D ax C ayi C bxi C byi2
D .ax  by/ C .ay C bx/i:

Multiplication of a complex number by i has a particularly simple geometric inter-
pretation in an Argand diagram. Since jij D 1 and arg .i/ D =2, multiplication
of w D a C bi by i leaves the modulus of w unchanged but increases its argument
by =2. (See Figure I.7.) Thus, multiplication by i rotates the position vector of w
counterclockwise by 90ı about the origin.

Roots of Complex Numbers
If a is a positive real number, there are two distinct real numbers whose square is a.
These are usually denoted
pa
(the positive square root of a)
and
pa
(the negative square root of a).
Every nonzero complex number z D x C yi (where x2 C y2 > 0) also has two square
roots; if w1 is a complex number such that w2
1 D z, then w2 D w1 also satisﬁes
w2
2 D z. Again, we would like to single out one of these roots and call it pz.
Let r D jzj, so that r > 0. Let  D Arg .z/. Thus,  <   . Since

pz. The two solutions of the equation w2 D z are, thus, w D pz and w D pz.
Observe that the real part of pz is always nonnegative, since cos.=2/  0 for
=2 <   =2. In this interval sin.=2/ D 0 only if  D 0, in which case pz is

“
The shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes
through the complex domain.
”
Jacques Hadamard
1865–1963
quoted in The Mathematical Intelligencer, v 13, 1991
Most of this book is concerned with developing the properties of real functions, that is,
functions of one or more real variables, having values that are themselves real numbers
or vectors with real components. The deﬁnition of function given in Section P.4 can be
paraphrased to allow for complex-valued functions of a complex variable.
DEFINITION
1
A complex function f is a rule that assigns a unique complex number f .z/
to each number z in some set of complex numbers (called the domain of the
function).
Typically, we will use z D x Cyi to denote a general point in the domain of a complex
function and w D uCvi to denote the value of the function at z; if w D f .z/, then the
real and imaginary parts of w (u D Re .w/ and v D Im .w/) are real-valued functions
of z, and hence real-valued functions of the two real variables x and y:
u D u.x; y/;
v D v.x; y/:
For example, the complex function f .z/ D z2, whose domain is the whole complex
plane C, assigns the value z2 to the complex number z. If w D z2 (where w D uCvi
and z D x C yi), then
u C vi D .x C yi/2 D x2  y2 C 2xyi;
so that
u D Re .z2/ D x2  y2
and
v D Im .z2/ D 2xy:
It is not convenient to draw the graph of a complex function. The graph of w D
f .z/ would have to be drawn in a four-dimensional (real) space, since two dimen-
sions (a z-plane) are required for the independent variable, and two more dimensions
(a w-plane) are required for the dependent variable. Instead, we can graphically rep-
resent the behaviour of a complex function w D f .z/ by drawing the z-plane and the
w-plane separately, and showing the image in the w-plane of certain, appropriately
chosen sets of points in the z-plane. For example, Figure II.1 illustrates the fact that
for the function w D z2 the image of the quarter-disk jzj  a, 0  arg .z/ 

2
is the half-disk jwj  a2, 0  arg .w/  . To see why this is so, observe that if
z D r.cos  C i sin /, then w D r2.cos 2 C i sin 2/. Thus, the function maps the
circle jzj D r onto the circle jwj D r2 and the radial line arg .z/ D  onto the radial
line arg .w/ D 2.

Limits and Continuity
The concepts of limit and continuity carry over from real functions to complex func-
tions in an obvious way providing we use jz1z2j as the distance between the complex
numbers z1 and z2. We say that
lim
z!z0 f .z/ D 
provided we can ensure that jf .z/  j is as small as we wish by taking z sufﬁciently
close to z0. Formally,
DEFINITION
2
We say that f .z/ tends to the limit  as z approaches z0, and we write
lim
z!z0 f .z/ D ;
if for every positive real number  there exists a positive real number ı (de-
pending on ), such that
0 < jz  z0j < ı
÷
jf .z/  j < :
DEFINITION
3
The complex function f .z/ is continuous at z D z0 if limz!z0 f .z/ exists
and equals f .z0/.
All the laws of limits and continuity apply as for real functions. Polynomials, that is,
functions of the form
P.z/ D a0 C a1z C a2z2 C    C anzn;
are continuous at every point of the complex plane. Rational functions, that is, func-
tions of the form
R.z/ D P.z/
Q.z/;
where P.z/ and Q.z/ are polynomials, are continuous everywhere except at points
where Q.z/ D 0. Integer powers zn are continuous except at the origin if n < 0. The
situation for fractional powers is more complicated. For example, pz (the principal
square root) is continuous except at points z D x < 0. The function f .z/ D z is
continuous everywhere, because
jz  z0j D jz  z0j D jz  z0j:

The Complex Derivative
The deﬁnition of derivative is the same as for real functions:
DEFINITION
4
The complex function f is differentiable at z and has derivative f 0.z/ there,
provided
lim
h!0
f .z C h/  f .z/
h
D f 0.z/
exists.
Note, however, that in this deﬁnition h is a complex number. The limit must exist no
matter how h approaches 0 in the complex plane. This fact has profound implications.
The existence of a derivative in this sense forces the function f to be much better
behaved than is necessary for a differentiable real function. For example, it can be
shown that if f 0.z/ exists for all z in an open region D in C, then f has derivatives of
all orders throughout D. Moreover, such a function is the sum of its Taylor series
f .z/ D f .z0/ C f 0.z0/.z  z0/ C f 00.z0/
2Š
.z  z0/2 C   
about any point z0 in D; the series has positive radius of convergence R and converges
in the disk jz  z0j < R. For this reason, complex functions that are differentiable
on open sets in C are usually called analytic functions. It is beyond the scope of this
introductory appendix to prove these assertions. They are proved in courses and texts
on complex analysis.
The usual differentiation rules apply:

As one would expect, the derivative of f .z/ D zn is f 0.z/ D nzn1.

But h=h D 1 if h is real, and h=h D 1 if h is pure imaginary. Since there are real
and pure imaginary numbers arbitrarily close to 0, the limit above does not exist, so
f 0.z/ does not exist.
The following theorem links the existence of the derivative of a complex function f .z/
with certain properties of its real and imaginary parts u.x; y/ and v.x; y/.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
As observed at the beginning of Appendix I, extending the number system to include
complex numbers allows larger classes of equations to have solutions. We conclude
this appendix by verifying that polynomial equations always have solutions in the com-
plex numbers.
A complex polynomial of degree n is a function of the form
Pn.z/ D anzn C an1zn1 C    C a2z2 C a1z C a0;
where a0, a1, : : : , an are complex numbers and an ¤ 0. The numbers ai (0  i  n)
are called the coefﬁcients of the polynomial. If they are all real numbers, then Pn.x/
is called a real polynomial.
A complex number z0 that satisﬁes the equation P.z0/ D 0 is called a zero or
root of the polynomial. Every polynomial of degree 1 has a zero: if a1 ¤ 0, then
a1z C a0 has zero z D a0=a1. This zero is real if a1 and a0 are both real.
Similarly, every complex polynomial of degree 2 has two zeros. If the polynomial
is given by
P2.z/ D a2z2 C a1z C a0
(where a2 ¤ 0), then the zeros are given by the quadratic formula
z D z1 D
a1 
q

1  4a2a0
2a2
and
z D z2 D
a1 C
q
a2
1  4a2a0

:
In this case, P2.z/ has two linear factors:
P2.z/ D a2.z  z1/.z  z2/:
Even if a2
1  4a2a0 D 0, so that z1 D z2, we still regard the polynomial as having two
(equal) zeros, one corresponding to each factor. If the coefﬁcients a0, a1, and a2 are
all real numbers, the zeros will be real provided a2
1  4a2a0. When real coefﬁcients
satisfy a2
1 < 4a2a0 then the zeros are complex, in fact, complex conjugates: z2 D z1.

n  1, then there exists a complex number z1 such that P.z1/ D 0.

APPENDIX II
Complex Functions
PROOF
(We will only give an informal sketch of the proof.) We can assume that the
coefﬁcient of zn in P.z/ is an D 1, since we can divide the equation P.z/ D 0 by
an without changing its solutions. We can also assume that a0 ¤ 0; if a0 D 0, then
z D 0 is certainly a zero of P.z/. Thus, we deal with the polynomial
P.z/ D zn C Q.z/;
where Q.z/ is a polynomial of degree less than n having a nonzero constant term. If
R is sufﬁciently large, then jQ.z/j will be less than Rn for all numbers z satisfying
jzj D R. As z moves around the circle jzj D R in the z-plane, w D zn moves around
the circle jwj D Rn in the w-plane (n times). Since the distance from zn to P.z/ is
equal to jP.z/  znj D jQ.z/j < Rn, it follows that the image of the circle jzj D R
under the transformation w D P.z/ is a curve that winds around the origin n times.
(If you walk around a circle of radius r n times, with your dog on a leash of length
less than r, and your dog returns to his starting point, then he must also go around the
centre of the circle n times.) This situation is illustrated for the particular case
P.z/ D z3 C z2  iz C 1;
jzj D 2
in Figure II.3. The image of jzj D 2 is the large curve in the w-plane that winds
around the origin three times. As R decreases, the curve traced out by w D P.z/ for
jzj D R changes continuously. For R close to 0, it is a small curve staying close to the
constant term a0 of P.z/. For small enough R the curve will not enclose the origin.
(In Figure II.3 the image of jzj D 0:3 is the small curve staying close to the point 1 in
the w-plane.) Thus, for some value of R, say R D R1, the curve must pass through
the origin. That is, there must be a complex number z1, with jz1j D R1, such that
P.z1/ D 0.

Remark
The above proof suggests that there should be n such solutions of the equa-
tion P.z/ D 0; the curve has to go from winding around the origin n times to winding
around the origin 0 times as R decreases toward 0. We can establish this as follows.
P.z1/ D 0 implies that z  z1 is a factor of P.z/:
P.z/ D .z  z1/Pn1.z/;
where Pn1 is a polynomial of degree n  1. If n > 1, then Pn1 must also have a
zero, z2, by the Fundamental Theorem. We can continue this argument inductively to
obtain n zeros and factor P.z/ into a product of the constant an and n linear factors:
P.z/ D an.z  z1/.z  z2/    .z  zn/:
Of course, some of the zeros can be equal.

APPENDIX II

Remark
If P is a real polynomial, that is, one whose coefﬁcients are all real num-
bers, then P.z/ D P.z/. Therefore, if z1 is a nonreal zero of P.z/, then so is z2 D z1:
P.z2/ D P.z1/ D P.z1/ D 0 D 0:
Real polynomials can have complex zeros, but they must always occur in complex
conjugate pairs. Every real polynomial of odd degree must have at least one real zero.
EXAMPLE 4
Show that z1 D i is a zero of the polynomial
P.z/ D z4 C 5z3 C 7z2 C 5z C 6; and ﬁnd all the other zeros of
this polynomial.
Solution
First observe that P.z1/ D P.i/ D 1 C 5i  7  5i C 6 D 0, so z1 D i
is indeed a zero. Since the coefﬁcients of P.z/ are real, z2 D i must also be a zero.
Thus, z C i and z  i are factors of P.z/, and so is
.z C i/.z  i/ D z2 C 1:
Dividing P.z/ by z2 C 1, we obtain
P.z/
z2 C 1 D z2 C 5z C 6 D .z C 2/.z C 3/:
Thus, the four zeros of P.z/ are z1 D i, z2 D i, z3 D 2, and z4 D 3.

Geometry may sometimes appear to take the lead over analysis, but in
fact precedes it only as a servant goes before his master to clear the

The development of calculus depends in an essential way on the concept of the limit
of a function and thereby on properties of the real number system. In Chapter 1 we
presented these notions in an intuitive way and did not attempt to prove them except
in Section 1.5, where the formal deﬁnition of limit was given and used to verify some
elementary limits and prove some simple properties of limits.
Many of the results on limits and continuity of functions stated in Chapter 1 may
seem quite obvious; most students and users of calculus are not bothered by applying
them without proof. Nevertheless, mathematics is a highly logical and rigorous dis-
cipline, and any statement, however obvious, that cannot be proved by strictly logical
arguments from acceptable assumptions must be considered suspect. In this appendix
we build upon the formal deﬁnition of limit given in Section 1.5 and combine it with
the notion of completeness of the real number system ﬁrst encountered in Section P.1
to give formal proofs of the very important results about continuous functions stated in
Theorems 8 and 9 of Section 1.4, the Max-Min Theorem and the Intermediate-Value
Theorem. Most of our development of calculus in this book depends essentially on
these two theorems.
The branch of mathematics that deals with proofs such as these is called mathe-
matical analysis. This subject is usually not pursued by students in introductory cal-
culus courses but is postponed to higher years and studied by students in majors or
honours programs in mathematics. It is hoped that some of this material will be of
value to honours-level calculus courses and individual students with a deeper interest
in understanding calculus.
Limits of Functions
At the heart of mathematical analysis is the formal deﬁnition of limit, Deﬁnition 8 in
Section 1.5, which we restate as follows:
The formal deﬁnition of limit
We say that limx!a f .x/ D L if for every positive number  there exists a
positive number ı, depending on  (i.e., ı D ı./), such that
0 < jx  aj < ı
÷
jf .x/  Lj < :
Section 1.5 was marked “optional” because understanding the material presented there
was not essential for learning calculus.
However, that material is an essential
prerequisite for this appendix. It is highly recommended that you go back to Sec-

tion 1.5 and read it carefully, paying special attention to Examples 2 and 4, and attempt
at least Exercises 31–36. These exercises provide proofs for the standard laws of limits
stated in Section 1.2.
Continuous Functions
Consider the following deﬁnitions of continuity, which are equivalent to those given in
Section 1.4.
DEFINITION
1
Continuity of a function at a point
A function f; deﬁned on an open interval containing the point a, is said to be
continuous at the point a if
lim
x!a f .x/ D f .a/I
that is, if for every  > 0 there exists ı > 0 such that if jx  aj < ı, then
jf .x/  f .a/j < .
DEFINITION
2
Continuity of a function on an interval
A function f is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point of
that interval. In the case of an endpoint of a closed interval, f need only be
continuous on one side. Thus, f is continuous on the interval Œa; b if
lim
t!x f .t/ D f .x/
for each x satisfying a < x < b, and
lim
t!aC f .t/ D f .a/
and
lim
t!b f .t/ D f .b/:
These concepts are illustrated in Figure III.1.

real line.
(d) For any rational number r; the function f .x/ D xr is continuous at every real
number where it is deﬁned.

example,
lim

x!a f .x//. lim
x!a g.x// D f .a/g.a/:

there exists k > 0 such that jf

limx!a g.x/ D L, there exists ı > 0 such that if 0 < jxaj < ı, then jg.x/Lj < k.

Completeness and Sequential Limits
DEFINITION
3
A real number u is said to be an upper bound for a nonempty set S of real
numbers if x  u for every x in S.
The number u is called the least upper bound or supremum of S if u is an
upper bound for S and u  u for every upper bound u of S. The supremum
of S is usually denoted sup.S/.
Similarly, ` is a lower bound for S if `  x for every x in S. The number `
is the greatest lower bound or inﬁmum of S if ` is a lower bound for S and
`  ` for every lower bound ` of S. The inﬁmum of S is denoted inf.S/.
EXAMPLE 1
Set S1 D Œ2; 3 and S2 D .2; 1/. Any number u  3 is an
upper bound for S1. S2 has no upper bound; we say that it is
not bounded above. The least upper bound of S1 is sup.S1/ D 3. Any real number
`  2 is a lower bound for both S1 and S2. The greatest lower bound of each set is 2:
inf.S1/ D inf.S2/ D 2. Note that the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a
set may or may not belong to that set.
We now recall the completeness axiom for the real number system, which we discussed
brieﬂy in Section P.1.
The completeness axiom for the real numbers
A nonempty set of real numbers that has an upper bound must have a least
upper bound.
Equivalently, a nonempty set of real numbers having a lower bound must have
a greatest lower bound.
We stress that this is an axiom to be assumed without proof. It cannot be deduced
from the more elementary algebraic and order properties of the real numbers. These
other properties are shared by the rational numbers, a set that is not complete. The
completeness axiom is essential for the proof of the most important results about con-
tinuous functions, in particular, for the Max-Min Theorem and the Intermediate-Value

Theorem. Before attempting these proofs, however, we must develop a little more
machinery.
In Section 9.1 we stated a version of the completeness axiom that pertains to
sequences of real numbers; speciﬁcally, that an increasing sequence that is bounded
above converges to a limit. We begin by verifying that this follows from the version
stated above. (Both statements are, in fact, equivalent.) As noted in Section 9.1, the
sequence
fxng D fx1; x2; x3; : : :g
is a function on the positive integers, that is, xn D x.n/. We say that the sequence
converges to the limit L, and we write lim xn D L, if the corresponding function x.t/
satisﬁes limt!1 x.t/ D L as deﬁned above. More formally,
DEFINITION
4
Limit of a sequence
We say that lim xn D L if for every positive number  there exists a positive
number N D N./ such that jxn  Lj <  holds whenever n  N:
T H E O R E M
2
If fxng is an increasing sequence that is bounded above, that is,
xnC1  xn
and
xn  K
for n D 1; 2; 3; : : : ;
then lim xn D L exists. (Equivalently, if fxng is decreasing and bounded below, then
lim xn exists.)
PROOF
Let fxng be increasing and bounded above. The set S of real numbers xn has
an upper bound, K, and so has a least upper bound, say L D sup.S/. Thus, xn  L
for every n, and if  > 0, then there exists a positive integer N such that xN > L  .
(Otherwise, L   would be an upper bound for S that is lower than the least upper
bound.) If n  N; then we have L   < xN  xn  L, so jxn  Lj < . Thus,
lim xn D L. The proof for a decreasing sequence that is bounded below is similar.
T H E O R E M
3
If a  xn  b for each n, and if lim xn D L, then a  L  b.
PROOF
Suppose that L > b. Let  D L  b. Since lim xn D L, there exists n such
that jxn  Lj < . Thus, xn > L   D L  .L  b/ D b, which is a contradiction,
since we are given that xn  b. Thus, L  b. A similar argument shows that L  a.
T H E O R E M

If f is continuous on Œa; b	, if a  xn  b for each n, and if lim xn D L, then
lim f .xn/ D f .L/.
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 1(b) and is left as Exercise 15 at the end of this
appendix.
Continuous Functions on a Closed, Finite Interval
We are now in a position to prove the main results about continuous functions on
closed, ﬁnite intervals.

The Boundedness Theorem
If f is continuous on Œa; b, then f is bounded there; that is, there exists a constant K
such that jf .x/j  K if a  x  b.
PROOF
We show that f is bounded above; a similar proof shows that f is bounded
below. For each positive integer n let Sn be the set of points x in Œa; b such that
f .x/ > n:
Sn D fx W a  x  b
and
f .x/ > ng:
We would like to show that Sn is empty for some n. It would then follow that f .x/  n
for all x in Œa; b; that is, n would be an upper bound for f on Œa; b.
Suppose, to the contrary, that Sn is nonempty for every n. We will show that
this leads to a contradiction. Since Sn is bounded below (a is a lower bound), by
completeness Sn has a greatest lower bound; call it xn. (See Figure III.2.) Evidently,
a  xn. Since f .x/ > n at some point of Œa; b and f is continuous at that point,
f .x/ > n on some interval contained in Œa; b. Hence, xn < b. It follows that
f .xn/  n. (If f .xn/ < n, then by continuity f .x/ < n for some distance to the right
of xn, and xn could not be the greatest lower bound of Sn.)

For each n, we have SnC1  Sn. Therefore, xnC1  xn and fxng is an increasing
sequence. Being bounded above (b is an upper bound) this sequence converges, by
Theorem 2. Let lim xn D L. By Theorem 3, a  L  b. Since f is continuous at
L, lim f .xn/ D f .L/ exists by Theorem 4. But since f .xn/  n, lim f .xn/ cannot
exist. This contradiction completes the proof.

The Max-Min Theorem
If f is continuous on Œa; b, then there are points v and u in Œa; b such that for any x
in Œa; b we have
f .v/  f .x/  f .u/I
that is, f assumes maximum and minimum values on Œa; b.
PROOF
By Theorem 5 we know that the set S D ff .x/ W a  x  bg has an upper
bound and, therefore, by the completeness axiom, a least upper bound. Call this least
upper bound M. Suppose that there exists no point u in Œa; b such that f .u/ D M.
Then by Theorem 1(a), 1=.M  f .x// is continuous on Œa; b. By Theorem 5, there
exists a constant K such that 1=.M  f .x//  K for all x in Œa; b. Thus f .x/ 
M  1=K, which contradicts the fact that M is the least upper bound for the values of
f . Hence, there must exist some point u in Œa; b such that f .u/ D M. Since M is

A-26
APPENDIX III

an upper bound for the values of f on Œa; b, we have f .x/  f .u/ D M for all x in
Œa; b.
The proof that there must exist a point v in Œa; b such that f .x/  f .v/ for all x
in Œa; b is similar.

The Intermediate-Value Theorem
If f is continuous on Œa; b and s is a real number lying between the numbers f .a/
and f .b/, then there exists a point c in Œa; b such that f .c/ D s.
PROOF
To be speciﬁc, we assume that f .a/ < s < f .b/. (The proof for the case
f .a/ > s > f .b/ is similar.) Let S D fx W a  x  b and f .x/  sg. S is nonempty
(a belongs to S) and bounded above (b is an upper bound), so by completeness S has
a least upper bound; call it c.
Suppose that f .c/ > s. Then c ¤ a and, by continuity, f .x/ > s on some
interval .c  ı; c where ı > 0. But this says c  ı is an upper bound for S lower than
the least upper bound, which is impossible. Thus, f .c/  s.
Suppose f .c/ < s. Then c ¤ b and, by continuity, f .x/ < s on some interval of
the form Œc; c Cı/ for some ı > 0. But this says that Œc; c Cı/  S, which contradicts
the fact that c is an upper bound for S. Hence, we cannot have f .c/ < s. Therefore,
f .c/ D s.

The Riemann Integral
“
It seems to be expected of every pilgrim up the slopes of the
mathematical Parnassus, that he will at some point or other of his
journey sit down and invent a deﬁnite integral or two towards the
increase of the common stock.
”
J. J. Sylvester
1814–1897
In Section 5.3 we deﬁned the deﬁnite integral
R b
a f .x/ dx of a function f that is con-
tinuous on the ﬁnite, closed interval Œa; b. The integral was deﬁned as a kind of “limit”
of Riemann sums formed by partitioning the interval Œa; b into small subintervals. In
this appendix we will reformulate the deﬁnition of the integral so that it can be used for
functions that are not necessarily continuous; in the following discussion we assume
only that f is bounded on Œa; b. Later we will prove Theorem 2 of Section 5.3, which
asserts that any continuous function is integrable.
Recall that a partition P
of Œa; b is a ﬁnite,
ordered set of points
P D fx0; x1; x2; : : : ; xng, where a D x0 < x1 < x2 <    < xn1 < xn D b.
Such a partition subdivides Œa; b into n subintervals Œx0; x1; Œx1; x2; : : : ; Œxn1; xn,
where n D n.P / depends on the partition. The length of the j th subinterval Œxj 1; xj 
is xj D xj  xj 1.
Suppose that the function f is bounded on Œa; b. Given any partition P; the n
sets Sj D ff .x/ W xj 1  x  xj g have least upper bounds Mj and greatest lower
bounds mj , .1  j  n/, so that
mj  f .x/  Mj

Œxj 1; xj :
We deﬁne upper and lower Riemann sums for f corresponding to the partition P to

III); that is, mj D f .lj / and Mj D f .uj/, where f .lj /  f .x/  f .uj/ for xj 1 

If P is any partition of Œa; b and we create a new partition P  by adding new
subdivision points to those of P; thus subdividing the subintervals of P into smaller
ones, then we call P  a reﬁnement of P:

If S and T are sets of real numbers, and S  T; then any lower bound (or
upper bound) of T is also a lower bound (or upper bound) of S. Hence, the greatest
lower bound of S is at least as large as that of T; and the least upper bound of S is no
greater than that of T:
Let P be a given partition of Œa; b and form a new partition P 0 by adding one
subdivision point to those of P; say, the point k dividing the j th subinterval Œxj 1; xj 
of P into two subintervals Œxj 1; k and Œk; xj . (See Figure IV.2.) Let mj , m0

PROOF
Suppose that for every  > 0 there exists a partition P of Œa; b such that

Conversely, if I  D I and  > 0 are given, we can ﬁnd a partition P 0 such

both x and ) such that jf .y/  f .x/j <  whenever jy  xj < ı and y lies in I: If it
is possible to ﬁnd a such a number ı independent of x and so depending only on  such
that jf .y/  f .x/j <  holds whenever x and y belong to I and satisfy jy  xj < ı,
we say that that f is uniformly continuous on the interval I:
Such is the case for a
closed ﬁnite interval.
T H E O R E M

If f is continuous on the closed, ﬁnite interval Œa; b, then f is uniformly continuous
on that interval.
PROOF
Let  > 0 be given. Deﬁne numbers xn in Œa; b and subsets Sn of Œa; b as
follows:
x1 D a
S1 D
n
x W x1 < x  b and jf .x/  f .x1/j  
3
o
:
If S1 is empty, stop; otherwise, let
x2 D the greatest lower bound of S1
S2 D
n
x W x2 < x  b and jf .x/  f .x2/j  
3
o
:
If S2 is empty, stop; otherwise, proceed to deﬁne x3 and S3 analogously. We proceed
in this way as long as we can; if xn and Sn have been deﬁned and Sn is not empty, we
deﬁne
xnC1 D the greatest lower bound of Sn
SnC1 D
n
x W xnC1 < x  b and jf .x/  f .xnC1/j  
3
o
:
At any stage where Sn is not empty, the continuity of f at xn assures us that xnC1 > xn
and jf .xnC1/  f .xn/j D =3.
We must consider two possibilities for the above procedure: either Sn is empty for
some n, or Sn is nonempty for every n.
Suppose Sn is nonempty for every n. Then we have constructed an inﬁnite, in-
creasing sequence fxng in Œa; b that, being bounded above (by b), must have
a limit by completeness (Theorem 2 of Appendix II). Let lim xn D x. We have a 
x

b.
Since f
is continuous at x, there exists ı
>
0 such that
jf .x/  f .x/j < =8 whenever jx  xj < ı and x lies in Œa; b. Since lim xn D x,
there exists a positive integer N such that jxn  xj < ı whenever n  N: For such n
we have


 jf .xnC1/  f .x/j C jf .xn/  f .x/j

4;
which is clearly impossible. Thus, Sn must, in fact, be empty for some n.
Suppose that SN is empty. Thus, Sn is nonempty for n < N; and the procedure
for deﬁning xn stops with xN. Since SN 1 is not empty, xN < b. In this case deﬁne
xN C1 D b and let

The minimum of a ﬁnite set of positive numbers is a positive number, so ı > 0. If
x lies in Œa; b, then x lies in one of the intervals Œx1; x2, Œx2; x3, : : :, ŒxN ; xN C1.
Suppose x lies in Œxk; xkC1. If y is in Œa; b and jy  xj < ı, then y lies in either
the same subinterval as x or in an adjacent one; that is, y lies in Œxj ; xj C1, where

If f is continuous on Œa; b, then f is integrable on Œa; b.
PROOF
By Theorem 4, f is uniformly continuous on Œa; b. Let  > 0 be given. Let
ı > 0 be such that jf .x/f .y/j < =.ba/ whenever jxyj < ı and x and y belong
to Œa; b. Choose a partition P D fx0; x1; : : : ; xng of Œa; b for which each subinterval
Œxj 1; xj  has length 	xj < ı. Then the greatest lower bound, mj , and the least upper
bound, Mj , of the set of values of f .x/ on Œxj 1; xj  satisfy Mj  mj < =.b  a/.

Doing Calculus with Maple

AI [Artiﬁcial Intelligences] think,
therefore I am.
”
David Braue
APC Magazine, November 2003
Computer algebra systems like Maple and Mathematica are capable of doing most of
the tedious calculations involved in doing calculus, especially the very intensive calcu-
lations required by many applied problems. (They cannot, of course, do the thinking
for you; you must still fully understand what you are doing and what the limitations
are of such programs.) Throughout this text we have inserted material illustrating how
to use Maple to do common calculus-oriented calculations. These insertions range in
length from single paragraphs and remarks to entire sections. To help you locate the
Maple material appropriate for speciﬁc topics, we include below a list pointing to the
text sections containing Maple examples and the pages where they occur.
Note, however, that this material assumes you are familiar with the basics of start-
ing a Maple session, preferably with a graphical user interface, which typically displays
the prompt > when it is waiting for your input. In this book the input is shown in ma-
genta. It normally concludes with a semicolon (;) followed by pressing the <enter>
key, which we omit from our examples. The output is typically printed by Maple cen-
tred in the window; we show it in cyan. For instance,
>
factor(x^2-x-2);
.x C 1/.x  2/
Output can be supressed by using a colon (:) instead of a semicolon at the end of the
input.
The authors used Maple 10 for preparing the Maple examples in this edition. They
should work equally well in later editions. These examples are by no means complete
or exhaustive. For a more complete treatment of Maple as a tool for doing calculus,
the authors highly recommend the excellent Maple lab manual Calculus: The Maple
Way, written by Professor Robert Israel of the University of British Columbia. Like
this book, it is published by Pearson Canada under the Addison-Wesley logo.

49. 1=x2 is not continuous (or even deﬁned) at x D 0,
so the Fundamental Theorem cannot be applied over
Œ1; 1. Since 1=x2 > 0 on its domain, we would ex-
pect the integral to be positive if it exists at all. (It
doesn’t.)
51. F.x/ has a maximum value at x D 1 but no minimum
