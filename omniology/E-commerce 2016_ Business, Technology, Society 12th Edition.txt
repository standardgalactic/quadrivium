E-commerce. Business. Technology. Society. Global Edition 12E provides you with an in-
depth introduction to the field of global e-commerce. We focus on key concepts, and 
the latest empirical and financial data, that will help you understand and take advan-
tage of the evolving world of opportunity offered by e-commerce, which is dramati-
cally altering the way business is conducted and driving major shifts in the global 
economy. E-commerce is a global phenomenon affecting economic and social life 
throughout the world. The Global Edition is aimed at students and professionals in 
the European Union, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Australia, and South Africa. Case 
studies reflect e-commerce firms in these regions, and figures and tables relate to 
these regional sources wherever possible.
Just as important as our global orientation, we have tried to create a book that is 
thought-provoking and current. We use the most recent data available, and focus on 
companies that you are likely to encounter on a daily basis in your everyday life, 
such as Uber, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube, Pinterest, eBay, What-
sApp, Snapchat, and many more that you will recognize, as well as some exciting 
startups that may be new to you. Global Edition cases include Puma, Financial Times, 
Ace & Tate, InMobi, Just Falafel, Spotify, Deezer, Viadeo, Souq, Alibaba, and Rocket 
Internet, among others. We also have up-to-date coverage of the key topics in e-com-
merce today, from privacy and piracy, to government surveillance, cyberwar, social, 
local, and mobile marketing, Internet sales taxes, intellectual property, and more. 
You will find here the most up-to-date and comprehensive overview of e-commerce 
today.
The e-commerce concepts you learn in this book will make you valuable to 
potential employers. The e-commerce job market is expanding rapidly. Many employ-
ers expect new employees to understand the basics of e-commerce, social and mobile 
marketing, and how to develop an e-commerce presence. Every industry today is 
touched in at least some way by e-commerce. The information and knowledge you 
find in this book will be valuable throughout your career, and after reading this book, 
we expect that you will be able to participate in, and even lead, management discus-
sions of e-commerce for your firm.

Themes
E-commerce has significantly evolved over the last decade. The iPhone was intro-
duced in 2007. The iPad tablet was first introduced in 2010 and has already gone 
through several generations! Cloud services for storing and streaming content, and 
hosting thousands of apps, were not widely available until 2011. Smartphone and tab-
let devices have changed e-commerce into a social, local, and mobile experience. The 
12th edition spotlights the following themes and content: 
Headlines 
•	 Social, Mobile, Local: We include an entire chapter describing social, mobile, and
local marketing. Content about social networks, the mobile platform, and local
e-commerce appears throughout the book.
»»
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn
continue their rapid growth, laying the groundwork for a social network mar-
keting platform 
»»
The mobile platform composed of smartphones and tablet computers takes off 
and becomes a major factor in search, marketing, payment, retailing and ser-
vices, and online content, as well as on-demand service companies. Mobile 
device use poses new security and privacy issues as well.
»»
Location-based services lead to explosive growth in local advertising and mar-
keting.
•	 Online privacy continues to deteriorate, driven by a culture of self-revelation and
powerful technologies for collecting personal information online without the
knowledge or consent of users. A growing number of consumers adopt ad blockers.
•	 Internet security risks increase; cyberwarfare becomes a new way of conducting
warfare among nation-states and a national security issue. A growing perception of
online risk supports a growing lack of trust in e-commerce firms and transactions.
Business
•	 Global e-commerce revenues surge, despite slow economic growth.
•	 Internet advertising growth continues to outpace traditional advertising, including
television.
•	 Social marketing grows faster than traditional online marketing like search and
display advertising.
•	 E-books sales plateau but continue as a major channel for books. Consumers
increasingly use smartphones and tablets as reader devices.
•	 Newspapers struggle to define a digital first news service.
•	 Streaming of popular TV shows and movies (Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, and Hulu.
com) becomes a reality, as Internet distributors and Hollywood and TV producers
strike deals for Web distribution that also protects intellectual property.

6	
	
P r e f a c e
•	 “Free” and “freemium” business models compete to support digital content. Sub-
scription services show unexpected strength.
•	 New mobile payment platforms emerge to challenge PayPal.
•	 B2B e-commerce exceeds pre-recession levels as firms become more comfortable 
with digital supply chains.
Technology 
•	 Smartphones, tablets, and e-book readers, along with associated cloud-based soft-
ware applications, and coupled with 4G cellular network expansion, fuel rapid 
growth of the mobile platform.
•	 Investment in cloud computing increases, providing the computing infrastruc-
ture for a massive increase in online digital information content, and e-com-
merce.
•	 Cloud-based streaming services for music and video challenge sales of downloads 
and physical product.
•	 Software apps fuel growth in app sales, marketing, and advertising; transforming 
software production and distribution.
•	 The cost of developing sophisticated Web sites continues to drop due to declining 
software and hardware prices and open source software tools.
•	 Internet and cellular network capacity is challenged by the rapid expansion in 
digital traffic generated by mobile devices; the use of bandwidth caps tier-pricing 
expands.
Society
•	 The mobile, “always on” culture in business and family life continues to grow.
•	 European countries develop much stronger privacy policies, including Right to be 
Forgotten laws, and expand the rights of citizens viz-a-viz Internet data giants.
•	 U.S. state governments heat up the pursuit of taxes on Internet sales by e-com-
merce firms.
•	 Intellectual property issues remain a source of conflict with significant movement 
toward resolution in some areas, such as Google’s deals with Hollywood and the 
publishing industry, and Apple’s and Amazon’s deals with e-book and magazine 
publishers.
•	 Net neutrality regulations forbid Internet providers from discriminating against 
types of content, or providing differential service to large players
•	 P2P piracy traffic declines as paid streaming music and video gains ground, 
although digital piracy of online content remains a significant threat to Hollywood 
and the music industry.
•	 Governments around the world increase surveillance of Internet users and Web 
sites in response to national security threats; Google continues to tussle with China 
and other countries over censorship and security issues. Europe ends safe harbor 
protections for U.S. Internet firms.

•	 Venture capital investing in e-commerce explodes for social, mobile, and local soft-
ware applications. Crowdfunding becomes a new source of funding for e-com-
merce start-ups.
WELCOME TO E-COMMERCE
Since it began in 1995, global e-commerce has grown from a standing start to €1.96 
billion business-to-consumer and a €14.2 trillion business-to-business juggernaut, 
bringing about enormous change in business firms, markets, and consumer behavior. 
Economies and business firms around the globe are being similarly affected. During 
this relatively short time, e-commerce has itself been transformed from its origin as 
a mechanism for online retail sales into something much broader. Today, e-commerce 
has become the platform for media and new, unique services and capabilities that 
aren’t found in the physical world. There is no physical world counterpart to Face-
book, Twittter, Google search, or a host of other recent online innovations from Pin-
terest and iTunes to Tumblr. The Internet is about to replace television as the largest 
entertainment platform. Welcome to the new e-commerce!
E-commerce is projected to continue growing at double-digit rates over the next 
five years, remaining the fastest growing form of commerce. Just as automobiles, 
airplanes, and electronics defined the twentieth century, so will e-commerce of all 
kinds define business and society in the twenty-first century. The rapid movement 
toward an e-commerce economy and society is being led by both established business 
firms such as Tesco, Ford, IBM, Carrefours, and General Electric, and online firms 
such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, and YouTube. Students of 
business and information technology need a thorough grounding in e-commerce in 
order to be effective and successful managers in the next decade.
While firms such as Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, and Uber have 
grown explosively in the last two years and grab our attention, the traditional forms of 
retail e-commerce and services also remain vital and have proven to be more resilient 
than traditional retail channels in facing the economic recession. The experience of 
these firms from 1995 to the present is also a focus of this book. The defining character-
istic of these firms is that they are profitable, sustainable, efficient, and innovative, with 
powerful brand names. Many of these now-experienced retail and service firms, such 
as eBay, Amazon, E*Trade, Priceline, and Expedia, are survivors of the first era of 
e-commerce. These surviving firms have evolved their business models, integrated 
their online and offline operations, and changed their revenue models to become prof-
itable. Understanding how these online businesses succeeded will help students to 
manage their own firms in the current omni-channel business environment. 
It would be foolish to ignore the lessons learned in the early period of e-commerce. 
Like so many technology revolutions in the past—automobiles, electricity, tele-
phones, television, and biotechnology—there was an explosion of entrepreneurial 
efforts, followed by consolidation. By 2005, the survivors of the early period were 
moving to establish profitable businesses while maintaining rapid growth in reve-
nues. In 2015, e-commerce is in the midst of a new period of explosive entrepreneur-
ial activity focusing on on-demand services, social networks and the mobile platform

P r e f a c e
created by smartphones and tablet computers. These technologies and social behav-
iors are bringing about extraordinary changes to our personal lives, markets, indus-
tries, individual businesses, and society as a whole. E-commerce is generating 
thousands of new jobs in all fields from marketing to management, entrepreneurial 
studies, and information systems. Today, e-commerce has moved into the main-
stream life of established businesses that have the market brands and financial mus-
cle required for the long-term deployment of e-commerce technologies and methods. 
If you are working in an established business, chances are the firm’s e-commerce 
capabilities are important factors for its success. If you want to start a new business, 
chances are very good that the knowledge you learn in this book will be very helpful.
BUSINESS. TECHNOLOGY. SOCIETY.
We believe that in order for business and technology students to really understand  
e-commerce, they must understand the relationships among e-commerce business 
concerns, Internet technology, and the social and legal context of e-commerce. These 
three themes permeate all aspects of e-commerce, and therefore, in each chapter, we 
present material that explores the business, technological, and social aspects of that 
chapter’s main topic.
Given the continued growth and diffusion of e-commerce, all students—regard-
less of their major discipline—must also understand the basic economic and business 
forces driving e-commerce. E-commerce has created new digital markets where 
prices are more transparent, markets are global, and trading is highly efficient, 
though not perfect. E-commerce has a direct impact on a firm’s relationship with sup-
pliers, customers, competitors, and partners, as well as how firms market products, 
advertise, and use brands. Whether you are interested in marketing and sales, design, 
production, finance, information systems, or logistics, you will need to know how 
e-commerce technologies can be used to reduce supply chain costs, increase produc-
tion efficiency, and tighten the relationship with customers. This text is written to 
help you understand the fundamental business issues in e-commerce.
We spend a considerable amount of effort analyzing the business models and strat-
egies of both online companies and established businesses now employing “bricks-and-
clicks” business models. We explore why e-commerce firms fail and the strategic, 
financial, marketing, and organizational challenges they face. We also discuss how 
e-commerce firms learned from the mistakes of early firms, and how established firms 
are using e-commerce to succeed. Above all, we attempt to bring a strong sense of busi-
ness realism and sensitivity to the often exaggerated descriptions of e-commerce. 
The Web and mobile platform have caused a major revolution in marketing and 
advertising in the United States. We spend two chapters discussing online marketing 
and advertising. Chapter 6 discusses “traditional” online marketing formats like 
search engine marketing, display advertising, and e-mail, as well as various Internet 
marketing technologies underlying those efforts, and metrics for measuring market-
ing success. Chapter 7 provides an in-depth examination of social, mobile, and local 
marketing, which relies on mobile devices and social networks.

E-commerce is driven by Internet technology. Internet technology, and informa-
tion technology in general, is perhaps the star of the show. Without the Internet, 
e-commerce would be virtually nonexistent. Accordingly, we provide three chapters 
specifically on the Internet and e-commerce technology, and in every chapter we 
provide continuing coverage by illustrating how the topic of the chapter is being 
shaped by new information technologies. For instance, Internet technology drives 
developments in security and payment systems, marketing strategies and advertis-
ing, financial applications, media distribution, business-to-business trade, and retail 
e-commerce. We discuss the rapid growth of the mobile platform, the emergence of 
cloud computing, new open source software tools and applications, and new types of 
Internet-based information systems that support digital business-to-business markets.
E-commerce is not only about business and technology, however. The third part 
of the equation for understanding e-commerce is society. E-commerce and Internet 
technologies have important social consequences that business leaders can ignore 
only at their peril. E-commerce has challenged our concepts of privacy, intellectual 
property, and even our ideas about national sovereignty and governance. Google, 
Facebook, Amazon, and assorted advertising networks maintain profiles on millions 
of shoppers and consumers worldwide. The proliferation of illegally copied music, 
videos, and books on the Internet, and the growth of social network sites often based 
on displaying copyrighted materials without permission, are challenging the intel-
lectual property rights of record labels, Hollywood studios, artists, and writers. And 
many countries—including the United States—are demanding to control the content 
of Web sites displayed within their borders for political and social reasons. Tax author-
ities in the United States and Europe are demanding that e-commerce sites pay sales 
taxes just like ordinary brick and mortar stores on Main Street. As a result of these 
challenges to existing institutions, e-commerce and the Internet are the subject of 
increasing investigation, litigation, and legislation. Business leaders need to under-
stand these societal developments, and they cannot afford to assume any longer that 
the Internet is borderless, beyond social control and regulation, or a place where 
market efficiency is the only consideration. In addition to an entire chapter devoted 
to the social and legal implications of e-commerce, each chapter contains material 
highlighting the social implications of e-commerce.
FEATURES AND COVERAGE
Strong Conceptual Foundation  The book emphasizes the three major driving forces 
behind e-commerce: business development and strategy, technological innovations, 
and social controversies and impacts. Each of these driving forces is represented in 
every chapter, and together they provide a strong and coherent conceptual frame-
work for understanding e-commerce. We analyze e-commerce, digital markets, and 
e-business firms just as we would ordinary businesses and markets using concepts 
from economics, marketing, finance, sociology, philosophy, and information sys-
tems. We strive to maintain a critical perspective on e-commerce and avoid industry 
hyperbole. 

10	
	
P r e f a c e
Some of the important concepts from economics and marketing that we use to 
explore e-commerce are transaction cost, network externalities, information asym-
metry, social networks, perfect digital markets, segmentation, price dispersion, tar-
geting, and positioning. Important concepts from the study of information systems 
and technologies play an important role in the book, including Internet standards and 
protocols, client/server computing, cloud computing, mobile platform and wireless 
technologies, and public key encryption, among many others. From the literature on 
ethics and society, we use important concepts such as intellectual property, privacy, 
information rights and rights management, governance, public health, and welfare.
From the literature on business, we use concepts such as business process design, 
return on investment, strategic advantage, industry competitive environment, oli-
gopoly, and monopoly. We also provide a basic understanding of finance and account-
ing issues, and extend this through an “E-commerce in Action” case that critically 
examines the financial statements of Amazon. One of the witticisms that emerged 
from the early years of e-commerce and that still seems apt is the notion that e-com-
merce changes everything except the rules of business. Businesses still need to make 
a profit in order to survive in the long term.
Currency  Important new developments happen almost every day in e-commerce 
and the Internet. We try to capture as many of these important new developments as 
possible in each annual edition. You will not find a more current book for a course 
offered for the 2016 academic year. Many other texts are already six months to a year 
out of date before they even reach the printer. This text, in contrast, reflects extensive 
research through October 2015, just weeks before the book hits the press.
Real-World Global Business Firm Focus and Cases  From Akamai Technologies to 
Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, to Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, to Netflix, 
Pandora, and Elemica, this book contains hundreds of real-company examples and 
over 60 more extensive cases that place coverage in the context of actual e-commerce 
businesses. You’ll find these examples in each chapter, as well as in special features 
such as chapter-opening, chapter-closing, and “Insight on” cases. The book takes a 
realistic look at the world of e-commerce, describing what’s working and what isn’t, 
rather than presenting a rose-colored or purely “academic” viewpoint.
In-depth Coverage of Marketing and Advertising  The text includes two chapters on 
marketing and advertising, both traditional online marketing and social, mobile, and 
local marketing. Marketing concepts, including market segmentation, personaliza-
tion, clickstream analysis, bundling of digital goods, long-tail marketing, and dynamic 
pricing, are used throughout the text.
In-depth Coverage of B2B E-commerce  We devote an entire chapter to an examina-
tion of B2B e-commerce. In writing this chapter, we developed a unique and easily 
understood classification schema to help students understand this complex arena of 
e-commerce. This chapter covers e-distributors, e-procurement companies, exchanges, 

	
P r e f a c e 	

11
and industry consortia, as well as the development of private industrial networks and 
collaborative commerce.
Current and Future Technology Coverage  Internet and related information tech-
nologies continue to change rapidly. The most important changes for e-commerce 
include dramatic price reductions in e-commerce infrastructure (making it much less 
expensive to develop a sophisticated e-commerce presence), the explosive growth in 
the mobile platform such as iPhones, iPads, and tablet computers, and expansion in 
the development of social technologies, which are the foundation of online social 
networks. What was once a shortage of telecommunications capacity has now turned 
into a surplus, PC prices have continued to fall, smartphone and tablet sales have 
soared, Internet high-speed broadband connections are now typical and are continu-
ing to show double-digit growth, and wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi and cellular 
broadband are transforming how, when, and where people access the Internet. While 
we thoroughly discuss the current Internet environment, we devote considerable 
attention to describing emerging technologies and applications such as the Internet 
of Things, advanced network infrastructure, fiber optics, wireless Web and 4G tech-
nologies, Wi-Fi, IP multicasting, and future guaranteed service levels.
Up-to-Date Coverage of the Research Literature  This text is well grounded in the  
e-commerce research literature. We have sought to include, where appropriate, refer-
ences and analysis of the latest e-commerce research findings, as well as many classic 
articles, in all of our chapters. We have drawn especially on the disciplines of eco-
nomics, marketing, and information systems and technologies, as well as law jour-
nals and broader social science research journals including sociology and psychology.
We do not use references to Wikipedia in this text, for a variety of reasons. Most 
colleges do not consider Wikipedia a legitimate or acceptable source for academic 
research and instruct their students not to cite it. Material found on Wikipedia may 
be out of date, lack coverage, lack critical perspective, and cannot necessarily be 
trusted. Our references are to respected academic journals; industry sources such as 
eMarketer, comScore, Hitwise, Nielsen, and Gartner; newspapers such as the New 
York Times and Wall Street Journal; and industry publications such as Computerworld 
and InformationWeek, among others. Figures and tables sourced to “authors’ estimates” 
reflect analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimates from vari-
ous research firms, historical trends, revenues of major online retailers, consumer 
online buying trends, and economic conditions.
Special Attention to the Social and Legal Aspects of E-commerce  We have paid 
special attention throughout the book to the social and legal context of e-commerce. 
Chapter 8 is devoted to a thorough exploration of four ethical dimensions of e-com-
merce: information privacy, intellectual property, governance, and protecting public 
welfare on the Internet. We have included an analysis of the latest Federal Trade 
Commission and other regulatory and nonprofit research reports, and their likely 
impact on the e-commerce environment.
A major theme throughout this chapter, and the remainder of the book, is the 
impact of social, mobile, and local commerce on how consumers use the Internet.

Writing That’s Fun to Read  Unlike some textbooks, we’ve been told by many stu-
dents that this book is actually fun to read and easy to understand. This is not a book 
written by committee—you won’t find a dozen different people listed as authors, co-
authors, and contributors on the title page. We have a consistent voice and perspec-
tive that carries through the entire text and we believe the book is the better for it. 
OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK
The book begins with an introductory chapter that provides an introduction to 
the major themes of the book. Chapter 1 defines e-commerce, distinguishes between 
e-commerce and e-business, and defines the different types of e-commerce. Chapter 
2 traces the historical development of the Internet and thoroughly describes how 
today’s Internet works. A major focus of this chapter is mobile technology, new soft-
ware applications, and the near-term future Internet that is now under development 
and will shape the future of e-commerce. Chapter 3 builds on the Internet chapter by 
focusing on the steps managers need to follow in order to build an e-commerce pres-
ence. This e-commerce infrastructure chapter covers the process that should be fol-
lowed in building an e-commerce presence; the major decisions regarding outsourcing 
site development and/or hosting; how to choose software, hardware, and other tools 
that can improve Web site performance, and issues involved in developing a mobile 
Web site and mobile applications. Chapter 4 focuses on e-commerce security and pay-
ments, building on the e-commerce infrastructure discussion of the previous chapter 
by describing the ways security can be provided over the Internet. This chapter 
defines digital information security, describes the major threats to security, and then 
discusses both the technology and policy solutions available to business managers 
seeking to secure their firm’s sites. This chapter concludes with a section on e-com-
merce payment systems. We identify the various types of online payment systems 
(credit cards, stored value payment systems such as PayPal, digital wallets such as 
Google Wallet, and others), and the development of mobile and social payment sys-
tems such as Apple Pay, Venmo, and Facebook Messenger.
The next four chapters focus directly on the business concepts and social-legal 
issues that surround the development of e-commerce. Chapter 5 introduces and 
defines the concepts of business model and revenue model, describes the major 
e-commerce business and revenue models for both B2C and B2B firms, and intro-
duces the basic business concepts required throughout the text for understanding 
e-commerce firms including industry structure, value chains, and firm strategy. 
Chapter 6 focuses on e-commerce consumer behavior, the Internet audience, and 
introduces the student to the basics of online marketing and branding, including tra-
ditional online marketing technologies and marketing strategies. Topics include the 
Web site as a marketing platform, search engine marketing and advertising, display 
ad marketing, e-mail campaigns, affiliate and lead generation marketing programs, 
multichannel marketing, and various customer retention strategies such as personal-
ization (including interest-based advertising, also known as behavioral targeting) and 
customer service tools. The chapter also covers other marketing strategies such as

pricing and long-tail marketing. Internet marketing technologies (Web transaction 
logs, tracking files, data mining, and Big Data) and marketing automation and CRM 
systems are also explored. The chapter concludes with a section on understanding 
the costs and benefits of various types of online marketing, including a new section 
on Web analytics software. Chapter 7 is devoted to an in-depth analysis of social, 
mobile, and local marketing. Topics include Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest market-
ing platforms, the evolution of mobile marketing, and the growing use of geo-aware 
technologies to support proximity marketing. Chapter 8 provides a thorough intro-
duction to the social and legal environment of e-commerce. Here, you will find a 
description of the ethical and legal dimensions of e-commerce, including a thorough 
discussion of the latest developments in personal information privacy, intellectual 
property, Internet governance, jurisdiction, and public health and welfare issues such 
as pornography, gambling, and health information.
The final four chapters focus on real-world e-commerce experiences in retail and 
services, online media, auctions, portals, and social networks, and business-to-busi-
ness e-commerce. These chapters take a sector approach rather than the conceptual 
approach used in the earlier chapters. E-commerce is different in each of these sec-
tors. Chapter 9 explores the world of online content and digital media and examines 
the enormous changes in online publishing and entertainment industries that have 
occurred over the last two years, including streaming movies, e-books, and online 
newspapers and magazines. Chapter 10 explores the online world of social networks, 
auctions, and portals. Chapter 11 takes a close look at the experience of firms in the 
retail marketplace for both goods and services, as well as on-demand service compa-
nies such as Uber and Airbnb. Chapter 11 also includes an “E-commerce in Action” 
case that provides a detailed analysis of the business strategies and financial operat-
ing results of Amazon, which can be used as a model to analyze other e-commerce 
firms. Chapter 12 concentrates on the world of B2B e-commerce, describing both Net 
marketplaces and the less-heralded, but very large arena of private industrial net-
works and the movement toward collaborative commerce.
PEDAGOGY AND CHAPTER OUTLINE
The book’s pedagogy emphasizes student cognitive awareness and the ability to ana-
lyze, synthesize, and evaluate e-commerce businesses. While there is a strong data 
and conceptual foundation to the book, we seek to engage student interest with lively 
writing about e-commerce businesses and the transformation of business models at 
traditional firms. 
Each chapter contains a number of elements designed to make learning easy as 
well as interesting.

rom the earliest of days, humans have 
warred against and stolen from each 
other, with the tools evolving over time 
from sticks and stones, to arrows and spears, to 
guns and bombs. Physical weaponry is familiar and 
readily recognizable. But today, algorithms and com-
puter code have moved to the forefront. Cyberspace 
has become a new battlefield, one that often involves 
targets such as financial systems and communica-
tions networks. 
In 2013, the European Cybercrime Center 
(EC3) was created at Europol, the European law 
enforcement agency in The Hague, to combat the rise 
of cybercrime and cyberattacks throughout Europe 
and the rest of the world. More than half of the EU’s 
population is now online, meaning that an organi-
zation like the EC3 is needed in Europe now more 
than ever before.
A major challenge in fighting cybercrime is to even concretely define it and measure 
the amount of cybercrime taking place. Estimates of how much cybercrime costs companies 
and individuals vary widely, but a 2015 study by the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies estimates that the economic impact of cybercrime and cyberespionage worldwide is 
in a range of between €345 billion and €530 billion, and that both the cost and frequency 
of attacks are on the rise. Cybercrime is a global problem, and countries have attempted 
many different strategies to fight it. However, sharing information about cybercrime is 
critical for success in apprehending cybercriminals, making Europol the ideal vehicle to 
combat multi-national criminal operations. The EC3 will help to standardize approaches 
to better counteract European cybercrime, and will help set guidelines regarding what 
incidents constitute cybercrime.
EC3 began operations out of The Hague on January 1, 2013, with a focus on three 
areas of cybercrime: crime committed by organized groups or rings, crime that causes 
harm to a victim, like child pornography, and cyberattacks on European Union infrastruc-
ture, such as government Web sites, databases, and storage centers.   In the wake of the 
terrorist attacks in Paris, France, EC3 received a boost in financial backing and powers, 
including the ability to coordinate police units to counter emerging threats and the capacity 
to directly force sites like Facebook and Twitter to remove Web pages containing terrorist

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THE APPIFICATION OF FACEBOOK
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg 
first envisioned Facebook as a uni-
tary experience, a place where all your 
social needs could be addressed. This 
approach fit with the branding strategy 
of Facebook connecting people all around the 
world and the Facebook mobile app used a similar 
all-in-one interface for many years. However, in an 
effort to create a more mobile-friendly experience, 
Facebook is moving from a single do-it-all app to 
a collection of apps that stand alone and compete 
with other apps in specific categories. This will allow 
the main Facebook app to focus on what it does 
best—posting updates and displaying the News 
Feed and Timelines of users while other functions 
of Facebook will operate separately. It’s a risky 
strategy that worried investors at first and has met 
with mixed results, including some major successes. 
The first app split off was Messenger, previ-
ously a functionality within Facebook that is used 
by hundreds of millions around the world. The Mes-
senger function within Facebook’s app was turned 
off and replaced by an icon. When users press the 
icon, the Messenger app launches.The Messenger 
app is faster and leaner than its predecessor, and 
can be more easily customized by the
a result, messages can b
than bef
Facebook created a new unit called Creative Labs 
to build apps free of the burden of integration with 
the main Facebook app. The idea is that single func-
tion apps can have a simpler interface, run faster, 
and be more intuitive. Creative Labs programmers 
report greater freedom to develop new products. 
Facebook’s track record with apps is mostly 
disappointing. Skeptical investors and critics point 
out that the most innovative and popular products 
coming out of Facebook are those that it recently 
purchased rather than any developed in-house. Face-
book has launched a number of ho-hum apps that 
few people use. Home was an Android feature that 
locked your smartphone screen to your Facebook. 
Few adopted it, as most found it redundant. Seeing 
the rapid growth of Instagram, the photo-based 
social network, Facebook developed a copycat 
app called Camera. Sensing another flop, it bought 
Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, hoping to 
appeal to younger users. Camera has since been 
discontinued while Instagram has grown from 40 
to over 400 million users; however, it does not yet 
generate any revenue. Paper, the first ne

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE INTERNET DRUG BAZAAR OPERATES 
AROUND THE GLOBE
In June 2015, Interpol announced the 
latest round of arrests and seizures as 
part of its Operation Pangea effort to 
combat sales of illegal drugs online. The 
operation seized 20 million illegal medicines 
worth more than $81 million, shut down 2,414 
fake online pharmacies, removed 550 advertise-
ments from social media, and resulted in 156 
arrests. Despite successes such as this, however, 
the Internet drug bazaar operated by rogue Inter-
net drug outlets remains a continuing public health 
and safety issue. According to a study done by the 
Treatment Research Institute at the University of 
Pennsylvania, addictive and potentially lethal med-
ications are available without prescription from 
more than 2 million Web sites around the world, 
with many sites based in countries that impose 
little if any regulation on pharmaceuticals. A 
Google search on “drugs no prescription” in 2015 
returns more than 49 million results. 
The International Narcotics Control Board, 
a U.N. narcotics watchdog agency, has provided 
guidelines and a framework for governments 
struggling to contain growing abuse of prescrip-
tion drugs on the Internet. According to the report
only two of 365 so-called Internet ph
surveyed were legiti
re
terfeit drugs or unapproved drugs. For instance, in 
the past, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has issued warnings that a number of con-
sumers who had purchased Ambien, Xanax, and 
Lexapro online had instead received a product con-
taining haloperial, a powerful anti-psychotic drug. 
Drug pushers on the Internet also include legitimate 
pharmaceutical firms who have discovered search 
engine advertising. Google and other search engines 
have come under fire for its relationships with pur-
veyors of illegal drugs and other unlawful products 
like stolen credit cards and fake IDs. In 2014, 
Google announced a settlement in a shareholder 
lawsuit over accusations that it had allowed adver-
tising from illegal drug sellers outside the United 
States. As part of the settlement, Google agreed to 
allocate $50 million per year to an internal effort to 
sever ties with and disrupt the operations of illegal 
online pharmacies. In 2015, Bing agreed to partner 
with the FDA to display warnings next to links to 
Web sites listed as illegal pharmacies. 
Despite these dangers, online pharmacies
remain alluring and are one of the f

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
ROCKET INTERNET
By now we’ve all heard the story of 
code written by Mark Zuckerberg in 
a Harvard dorm room blossoming 
into a multi-billion dollar business. 
These days, it’s harder than ever to keep 
track of all the tech startups being bought 
for millions and even billions of euros, often even 
without any revenue to show for themselves. Many 
of them have something in common—they have 
been nurtured, and in some cases, whipped into 
shape, with the help of an “incubator.”
Incubators have come to occupy a vital role 
in tech, helping new businesses move from little 
more than a great idea to an established, vibrant 
business. Rocket Internet is one such incubator. 
Founded in 2007 by German entrepreneurs Alex-
ander, Oliver, and Marc Samwer, Rocket Internet 
launches e-commerce and other Internet start-ups 
in emerging markets, with the goal of becoming 
the world’s largest Internet platform outside the 
United States and China. Headquartered in Berlin 
and with 25 international offices, Rocket Inter-
net has over 75 independent companies active 
in 110 countries in its portfolio In 2014, Rocket 
went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, in 
the largest German technology IPO in the past 
decade. The initial pricing valued the company 
at around €6.5 billion. In the previous two y
the company had raised ne
l
investors I
functions to help them cut down on operational 
costs. The growing network of Rocket Internet 
companies is also a valuable resource. In many 
emerging markets, the most talented workers end 
up in established industries, but Rocket is ensur-
ing that e-commerce also captures top talent in 
those regions. Prominent companies launched via 
Rocket Internet include Germany’s Zalando, India’s 
Jabong, Russia’s Lamoda, Australia’s The Iconic 
and Zanui, Pakistan’s Azmalo (now Kaymu) and 
Daraz, and Southeast Asia’s Zalora. 
Former Rocket Internet employees also have 
a strong track record with their own independent 
start-ups once they’ve left the parent company. 
These employees note that their experience at 
Rocket has made the prospect of starting new 
businesses seem less intimidating. They also praise 
Oliver Samwer’s attention to detail and emphasis 
on making decisions using data. Rocket Internet 
start-ups collect and analyze as much data as pos-
sible on their markets and customers. They also 
report that their association with Rocket Internet 
gives them more credibility with major investors.
Rocket Internet has yet to launch many new 
businesses in the United States, where the

hen Puma, one of the world’s top sports footwear, apparel, and ac-
cessories brands, conceived its Love=Football campaign in 2010, the 
goal was to create a memorable tagline in a language that would be 
understood the world over—pictures. In the process, the company stumbled upon the 
power of social marketing. Puma’s ad agency, Droga5, filmed a light-hearted commercial 
featuring scruffy everyday men in a Tottenham pub singing love songs to their Valentines. 
The video went viral, garnering more than 130 million impressions and spawning hundreds 
of homemade response videos. In 2015, Puma launched an ad campaign called Forever 
Faster, featuring videos of celebrities and professional athletes training to meet their goals, 
including sprinter Usain Bolt and pop star Rihanna, whom the company also named its 
women’s creative director. The campaign has been another major success, driving sales 
of Puma’s Ignite XT shoe and further rejuvenating its brand.
Puma maintains an extensive presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest,  
and YouTube and closely integrates its social strategy with its other marketing channels

f you were trying to pick iconic 
examples of e-commerce in the 
two decades since it began in 
1995, it is likely that companies such 
as Amazon, eBay, Google, Apple, and 
Facebook would be high on the list. 
Today, there’s a new company that may 
become the face of e-commerce as it 
enters its third decade: Uber. Uber and 
other firms with similar business models, 
such as Lyft (a ride service similar to 
Uber’s), Airbnb (rooms for rent), 
Heal (doctor home visits), Handy and 
Homejoy (part-time household helpers), 
Instacart (grocery shopping), Washio 
(laundry service), and BloomThat 
(flower delivery), are the pioneers of a new on-demand service e-commerce business model 
that is sweeping up billions of investment dollars in 2015 and disrupting major industries 
from transportation to hotels, real estate, house cleaning, maintenance, and grocery shop-
ping. On-demand service firms have collected over $26 billion in venture capital funding 
over the last five years, making this the hottest business model in e-commerce for 2015.
Uber provides two major services: UberTaxi (also called UberX), which provides 
taxi service, and UberBlack, which provides a higher-priced town car service for business 
executives. UberPool is a ride-sharing service that allows users to share a ride with another 
person who happens to be going to same place. Google is working with Uber on developing 
this new service. In several cities, Uber is developing UberEats, a food delivery service; 
UberRush, a same-day delivery service; and UberCargo, a trucking service. 
Uber was founded in 2009 by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, and has grown 
explosively since then to over 300 cities and 60 countries. Drivers are signing up at 
an exponential rate, doubling every year; as of the beginning of 2015, there were over 
160,000. According to an Uber-sponsored survey, over 44% of Uber drivers have 
college degrees (compared to 15% of taxi drivers), 71% say they have boosted their 
income and financial security by driving for Uber, and 73% say they prefer a job where 
they choose their hours rather than a 9-to-5 job. In 2015, Uber’s revenue is estimated 
to be $10 billion, with profits (after paying its drivers) of $2 billion. This is five times 
as much as it made in 2014, when net revenue was about $400 million, which itself is 
about four times as much as its net revenue in 2013. Uber appears to be growing at

300% a year! As a result, in 2015, Uber is the most richly valued start-up in history and 
is currently valued at more than $50 billion.
Uber has a compelling value proposition for both customers and drivers. Customers 
can sign up for free, request and pay for a ride (at a cost Uber claims is 40% less than 
a traditional taxi) using a smartphone and credit card, and get picked up within a few 
minutes. No need to stand on a street corner frantically waving, competing with others, 
or waiting and waiting for an available cab to drive by without knowing when that might 
happen. Instead, customers can use the Uber app to secure a ride, and they know just how 
long it will take for the ride to arrive and how much it will cost. With UberPool, the cost 
of a ride drops by 50%, making it cost-competitive with owning a car in an urban area, 
according to Uber. For drivers, Uber’s value proposition is: set your own hours, work when 
you like, and put your own car to use generating revenue.
Uber is the current poster child for “digital disruption.” It is easy see to why Uber has 
ignited a firestorm of opposition from existing taxi services around the world. Who can 
compete in a market where a new upstart firm offers a 50% price reduction? If you’ve 
paid €240,000 for a license to drive a taxi in Paris, what is it worth now that Uber has 
arrived? Even governments find Uber to be a disruptive threat. Cities and states do not 
want to give up regulatory control over passenger safety, driver training, or the healthy 
revenue stream generated by charging taxi firms for a taxi license and sales taxes. 
Uber’s business model differs from traditional retail e-commerce. Uber doesn’t sell 
goods. Instead, it has created a smartphone-based platform that enables people who 
want a service—like a taxi—to find a provider with the resources, such as a personal 
automobile that spends much of its time parked and a driver with available time, to fill 
the demand. It’s important to understand that although Uber and similar firms were 
initially called “sharing economy” companies, this is a misnomer. Uber drivers are selling 
their services as drivers and the temporary use of their car. Uber the company is not in 
the sharing business either: it charges a hefty fee for every transaction on its platform. 
Uber is not an example of “peer-to-peer” e-commerce because Uber transactions involve 
an online intermediary: a third party that takes a cut of all transactions and arranges for 
the marketplace to exist in the first place. 
Uber has disrupted the traditional taxi business model because it offers a superior, 
fast, convenient taxi-hailing service when compared to traditional taxi companies that rely 
on the telephone, a central dispatcher using antiquated radio communications to direct 
cabs, or, as in many urban areas, customers standing on street corners frantically waving 
their hands. With traditional taxi services, there is no guarantee you will find a cab or that 
a cab will arrive when you really need one. Customers have no way of knowing how long 
a traditional taxi will take to arrive. Uber reduces that uncertainty: using a smartphone, 
the customer enters a request for pickup, and nearly instantly (under the best of circum-
stances) a provider will be found by Uber and the estimated time of arrival established 
along with the price. Riders can accept the price or find an alternative. 
Uber’s business model is much more efficient than a traditional taxi firm. Uber does 
not own taxis and has no maintenance or financing costs. It does not have employees but 
instead calls its drivers “independent contractors.” Uber is not encumbered with the costs

for workers compensation, minimum wage requirements, background checks on drivers, 
driver training, health insurance, or commercial licensing. 
Quality control would seem to be a nightmare with over 160,000 contract drivers. 
But Uber relies on user reviews of drivers and the ride experience to identify problematic 
drivers, and driver reviews of customers to identify problematic passengers. It also sets 
standards for cleanliness. The reviews can be used to discipline drivers: drivers are evalu-
ated by riders on a 5-point scale, and if drivers fall below 4.5, they are warned and may 
be dropped if they don’t improve. Anything less than a 5 is a sign to the company that 
something was not right about the ride experience. Customers are also rated with a 5-point 
system. Drivers can refuse to pick up troublesome customers, and the Uber server can 
delay service to problematic people with low ratings or ban them entirely. Uber does not 
publicly report on how many poorly rated drivers or passengers there are in its system. 
Academic articles have found that in similar on-demand companies, such as Airbnb, there’s 
a built-in bias for both sellers and buyers to give good reviews regardless of the actual 
experience. If you routinely give low reviews to sellers (drivers), they will think you are too 
demanding and not service you in the future. If a driver gives low reviews to passengers, 
they might not rate you highly in return. 
Rather than having a dispatcher in every city, Uber has an Internet-based app service 
running on cloud servers located throughout the world. It does not provide radios to its 
drivers, who instead must use their own smartphones and cell service, which the drivers 
pay for. It does not provide insurance or maintenance for its drivers’ cars. Uber has shifted 
the costs of running a taxi service entirely to the drivers. Uber charges prices that vary 
dynamically with demand: the higher the demand, the greater the price of a ride. Therefore, 
it is impossible using public information to know if Uber’s prices are lower than traditional 
taxis. Clearly, in high-demand situations they are higher, sometimes ten times higher, than 
a regulated taxi. There is no regulatory taxi commission setting uniform per mile fares. 
Consumers do face some traditional uncertainties regarding availability: during a rain 
storm, a convention, or a sports event, when demand peaks, not enough drivers may be 
available at any price. 
What could be wrong with Uber’s apparent over-the-top success? It is digitally 
disrupting a staid, highly regulated, and decidedly non-digital industry that employs over 
200,000 people, most of whom are full-time employees, and who have a median pay of 
$22,820 per year, or about $11 an hour. In the not-so-distant future, Uber’s part-time 
drivers will likely outnumber full-time taxi drivers worldwide. 
If Uber is the poster child for the new on-demand service economy, it’s also the iconic 
example of the social costs and conflicts associated with this new kind of e-commerce. 
Uber has been accused by attorney generals in many countries of misclassifying its 
drivers as contractors as opposed to employees, thereby denying the drivers the benefits 
of employee status, such as minimum wages, social security, workers compensation, and 
health insurance.  
Uber has also been accused of violating public transportation laws and regulations 
throughout the world; abusing the personal information it has collected on users of the 
service; seeking to use personal information to intimidate journalists; failing to protect 

46	
	
C H A P T E R  1     I n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  E - c o m m e r c e
public safety by refusing to do adequate criminal, medical, and financial background 
checks on its drivers; taking clandestine actions against its chief competitor Lyft in order 
to disrupt its business; and being tone-deaf to the complaints of its own drivers against the 
firm’s efforts to reduce driver fees in 2015. Uber has met with heavy resistance in Europe’s 
largest cities in 2015. In London, regulators hope to impose a mandatory five-minute 
wait before passengers can begin a ride as a protection for traditional taxicab drivers. In 
Paris, Uber executives appeared in court to stand trial for running an illegal taxi service, 
and the company was forced to shut down service in Paris due to “violent attacks” during 
protests against Uber following similar shutdowns of Uber service in Germany and Italy. 
In Amsterdam, law enforcement has searched Uber offices for evidence of transport law 
infractions. The EU’s most powerful court, the European Court of Justice, is likely to rule 
on whether Uber is a transportation service that violates the existing laws in many coun-
tries or an “information society service” that requires more flexible rules and regulations. 
Critics also fear that on-demand firms will create a society of part-time, low-paid 
temp work, displacing traditionally full-time, secure jobs—the so-called Uber-ization 
of work. As one critic put it, Uber is not the Uber for rides so much as it is the Uber 
for low-paid jobs. Uber responds to this fear by claiming that it is lowering the cost of 
transportation, making better use of spare human and financial resources, expanding the 
demand for ride services, and expanding opportunities for car drivers, whose pay is about 
the same as other taxi drivers. In reality, the point is moot: on-demand service companies 
will continue to grow explosively until the supply of part-time workers is exhausted. This 
means, inevitably, the continued growth of a part-time work economy, and growing political 
pressure to bring benefits to these workers. 
Does Uber have a sustainable business model? Is the company really worth over $50 
billion based on $2 billion in net revenue a year? If the company continues to triple its 
net revenue every year, the answer is yes. But Uber does have a few competitors already, 
such as Lyft in the United States, GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia, Cabify in Spain and Latin 
America, and a host of local firms around the world. Lyft is currently about one-tenth the 
size of Uber but growing rapidly, thanks to the support of Alibaba and several prominent 
venture capitalists. Uber faces a bevy of new, smaller competing firms, including Sidecar, 
Via, Tripda, and Shuddle, all of whom offer app-based hailing services. Many of these firms 
prioritize following the law and local regulations, which dramatically reduces expenses 
compared to Uber’s growth-at-any-cost approach and its attendant legal fees. China has 
its own cab hailing services, Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache, although Uber reports that 
30% of its rides take place in China. Uber may find that its strong brand may be its most 
important asset going forward.

n 1994, e-commerce as we now know it did not exist. In 2015, just 21 years 
later, around 1.4 billion consumers worldwide are expected to spend about 
€1.96 trillion, and businesses around €14.2 trillion, purchasing goods, services, 
and digital content online or via a mobile device. And in this short period of time, 
e-commerce has been reinvented not just once, but twice.
The early years of e-commerce, during the late 1990s, were a period of business 
vision, inspiration, and experimentation. It soon became apparent, however, that 
establishing a successful business model based on those visions would not be easy. 
There followed a period of retrenchment and reevaluation, which led to the stock 
market crash of 2000–2001, with the value of e-commerce, telecommunications, and 
other technology stocks plummeting. After the bubble burst, many people were quick 
to write off e-commerce. But they were wrong. The surviving firms refined and honed 
their business models, and the technology became more powerful and less expensive, 
ultimately leading to business firms that actually produced profits. Between 2002–2008, 
retail e-commerce grew at more than 25% per year.
Today, we are in the middle of yet another transition. Social networks such as 
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and Tumblr, which enable users to distribute 
their own content (such as videos, music, photos, personal information, commentary, 
blogs, and more), have rocketed to prominence. Never before in the history of media 
have such large audiences been aggregated and made so accessible. Businesses are 
grappling with how best to approach this audience from a marketing, advertising, 
and sales perspective. At the same time, the traditional desktop platform and Web 
browser that most consumers have used to access the Internet in the past is being 
augmented by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, and mobile 
apps. Facilitated by technologies such as cloud computing, mobile devices have 
become advertising, shopping, reading, and media viewing machines, and in the 
process, consumer behavior is being transformed yet again. Mobile, social, and local 
have become driving forces in e-commerce. The mobile platform infrastructure is 
also giving birth to yet another e-commerce innovation: on-demand services that are 
local and personal. From hailing a taxi, to shopping, to washing your clothes, these 
new businesses are creating a marketspace where owners of resources such as cars, 
spare bedrooms, and spare time can find a market of eager consumers looking to buy 
a service in a few minutes using their smartphones. The opening case on Uber is a 
leading example of these new on-demand service firms that are disrupting traditional 
business models.

E-COMMERCE: THE REVOLUTION IS JUST BEGINNING
Table 1.1 describes the major trends in e-commerce in 2015–2016. The mobile platform 
based on smartphones and tablet computers has finally arrived with a bang, making 
true mobile e-commerce a reality. Social networks are enabling social e-commerce by 
providing search, advertising, and payment services to vendors and customers. More

and more people and businesses are using the Internet and mobile devices to conduct 
commerce; smaller, local firms are taking advantage of the Internet and mobile plat-
form as e-commerce technologies become less and less expensive. New e-commerce 
brands have emerged while traditional retail brands such as Tesco and Carrefour are 
further extending their omnichannel strategies and retaining their dominant retail 
positions by strengthening their e-commerce operations. At the societal level, other 
trends are apparent. The Internet and mobile platform provide an environment that 
allows millions of people to create and share content, establish new social bonds, 
and strengthen existing ones through social network, photo- and video-posting, and 
blogging sites and apps, while at the same time creating significant privacy issues. 
The major digital copyright owners have increased their pursuit of online file-sharing 
services with mixed success, while reaching broad agreements with the big technology 
players like Apple, Amazon, and Google to protect intellectual property rights. Taxation 
of online sales continues to pose challenges for governments. Sovereign nations have 
expanded their surveillance of, and control over, online communications and content 
as a part of their anti-terrorist activities and their traditional interest in snooping on 
citizens. Privacy seems to have lost some of its meaning in an age when millions create 
public online personal profiles.
THE FIRST 30 SECONDS
It is important to realize that the rapid growth and change that has occurred in the first 
21 years of e-commerce represents just the beginning—what could be called the first 30 
seconds of the e-commerce revolution. Technology continues to evolve at exponential 
rates. This underlying ferment presents entrepreneurs with new opportunities to both 
create new businesses and new business models in traditional industries, and also to 
destroy old businesses. Business change becomes disruptive, rapid, and even destruc-
tive, while offering entrepreneurs new opportunities and resources for investment. For 
instance, on-demand service firms such as Uber and Airbnb threaten the traditional 
taxi and low-cost hotel industries.
Improvements in underlying information technologies and continuing entrepre-
neurial innovation in business and marketing promise as much change in the next 
decade as was seen in the previous decade. The twenty-first century will be the age 
of a digitally enabled social and commercial life, the outlines of which we can barely 
perceive at this time. Analysts estimate that by 2019, U.S. consumers will be spending 
over $775 billion and businesses over $8.5 trillion in digital transactions. It appears 
likely that e-commerce will eventually impact nearly all commerce, and that most 
commerce will be e-commerce by the year 2050.
Can e-commerce continue to grow indefinitely? It’s possible that at some point, 
e-commerce growth may slow simply as a result of overload: people may just not have 
the time to watch yet another online video, open another e-mail, or read another blog, 
tweet, or Facebook update. However, currently, there is no foreseeable limit to the 
continued rapid development of e-commerce technology, or limits on the inventive-
ness of entrepreneurs to develop new uses for the technology. Therefore, for now at 
least, it is likely that the disruptive process will continue.

Business fortunes are made—and lost—in periods of extraordinary change such as 
this. The next five years hold out exciting opportunities—as well as risks—for new and 
traditional businesses to exploit digital technology for market advantage. For society 
as a whole, the next few decades offer the possibility of extraordinary gains in social 
wealth as the digital revolution works its way through larger and larger segments of 
the world’s economy, offering the possibility of high rates of productivity and income 
growth in an inflation-free environment.
As a business or technology student, this book will help you perceive and under-
stand the opportunities and risks that lie ahead. By the time you finish, you will be 
able to identify the technological, business, and social forces that have shaped, and 
continue to shape, the growth of e-commerce, and ready to participate in, and ultimately 
guide, discussions of e-commerce in the firms where you work.
WHAT IS E-COMMERCE?
Our focus in this book is e-commerce—the use of the Internet, the World Wide Web 
(Web), and mobile apps and browsers running on mobile devices to transact business. 
Although the terms Internet and Web are often used interchangeably, they are actually 
two very different things. The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks, 
and the Web is one of the Internet’s most popular services, providing access to billions 
of Web pages. An app (short-hand for application) is a software application. The term 
is typically used when referring to mobile applications, although it is also sometimes 
used to refer to desktop computer applications as well. A mobile browser is a version 
of Web browser software accessed via a mobile device. (We describe the Internet, Web, 
and mobile platform more fully later in this chapter and in Chapters 2 and 3.) More 
formally, we focus on digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among 
organizations and individuals. Each of these components of our working definition of 
e-commerce is important. Digitally enabled transactions include all transactions medi-
ated by digital technology. For the most part, this means transactions that occur over 
the Internet, the Web, and/or via mobile devices. Commercial transactions involve the 
exchange of value (e.g., money) across organizational or individual boundaries in 
return for products and services. Exchange of value is important for understanding 
the limits of e-commerce. Without an exchange of value, no commerce occurs. 
The professional literature sometimes refers to e-commerce as digital commerce. 
For our purposes, we consider e-commerce and digital commerce to be synonymous. 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN E-COMMERCE AND E-BUSINESS
There is a debate about the meaning and limitations of both e-commerce and e-busi-
ness. Some argue that e-commerce encompasses the entire world of electronically 
based organizational activities that support a firm’s market exchanges—including 
a firm’s entire information system’s infrastructure (Rayport and Jaworski, 2003). 
Others argue, on the other hand, that e-business encompasses the entire world of 
internal and external electronically based activities, including e-commerce (Kalakota 
and Robinson, 2003).
We think it is important to make a working distinction between e-commerce and 
e-business because we believe they refer to different phenomena. E-commerce is not

“anything digital” that a firm does. For purposes of this text, we will use the term 
e‑business to refer primarily to the digital enabling of transactions and processes 
within a firm, involving information systems under the control of the firm. For the 
most part, in our view, e-business does not include commercial transactions involving 
an exchange of value across organizational boundaries. For example, a company’s 
online inventory control mechanisms are a component of e-business, but such internal 
processes do not directly generate revenue for the firm from outside businesses or 
consumers, as e-commerce, by definition, does. It is true, however, that a firm’s 
e-business infrastructure provides support for online e-commerce exchanges; the same 
infrastructure and skill sets are involved in both e-business and e-commerce. E-com-
merce and e-business systems blur together at the business firm boundary, at the point 
where internal business systems link up with suppliers or customers (see Figure 1.1). 
E-business applications turn into e-commerce precisely when an exchange of value 
occurs (see Mesenbourg, U.S. Department of Commerce, 2001, for a similar view). We 
will examine this intersection further in Chapter 12.
WHY STUDY E-COMMERCE?
Why are there college courses and textbooks on e-commerce when there are no 
courses or textbooks on “TV Commerce,” “Radio Commerce,” “Railroad Commerce,” or 
“Highway Commerce,” even though these technologies had profound impacts on com-
merce in the twentieth century and account for far more commerce than e-commerce? 
The reason for the interest specifically in e-commerce is that e-commerce tech-
nology (discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 3) is different and more powerful than 
any of the other technologies we have seen in the past century. E-commerce tech-
nologies—and the digital markets that result—have brought about some fundamen-
tal, unprecedented shifts in commerce. While these other technologies transformed

economic life in the twentieth century, the evolving Internet and other information 
technologies are shaping the twenty-first century.
Prior to the development of e-commerce, the marketing and sale of goods was a 
mass-marketing and sales force–driven process. Marketers viewed consumers as passive 
targets of advertising campaigns and branding “blitzes” intended to influence their long-
term product perceptions and immediate purchasing behavior. Companies sold their 
products via well-insulated channels. Consumers were trapped by geographical and 
social boundaries, unable to search widely for the best price and quality. Information 
about prices, costs, and fees could be hidden from the consumer, creating profitable 
information asymmetries for the selling firm. Information asymmetry refers to any 
disparity in relevant market information among parties in a transaction. It was so expen-
sive to change national or regional prices in traditional retailing (what are called menu 
costs) that one national price was the norm, and dynamic pricing to the marketplace let 
alone to individuals in the marketplace—changing prices in real time—was unheard of. 
In this environment, manufacturers prospered by relying on huge production runs of 
products that could not be customized or personalized. One of the shifts that e-commerce 
is bringing about is a reduction in information asymmetry among market participants 
(consumers and merchants). Preventing consumers from learning about costs, price 
discrimination strategies, and profits from sales becomes more difficult with e-com-
merce, and the entire marketplace potentially becomes highly price competitive. At the 
same time, online merchants gain considerable market power over consumers by using 
consumer personal information in ways inconceivable 10 years ago to maximize their 
revenues.
EIGHT UNIQUE FEATURES OF E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY
Figure 1.2 illustrates eight unique features of e-commerce technology that both chal-
lenge traditional business thinking and explain why we have so much interest in 
e-commerce. These unique dimensions of e-commerce technologies suggest many 
new possibilities for marketing and selling—a powerful set of interactive, personal-
ized, and rich messages are available for delivery to segmented, targeted audiences. 
E-commerce technologies make it possible for merchants to know much more about 
consumers and to be able to use this information more effectively than was ever true 
in the past. Online merchants can use this new information to develop new informa-
tion asymmetries, enhance their ability to brand products, charge premium prices for 
high-quality service, and segment the market into an endless number of subgroups, 
each receiving a different price. To complicate matters further, these same technolo-
gies make it possible for merchants to know more about other merchants than was 
ever true in the past. This presents the possibility that merchants might collude on 
prices rather than compete and drive overall average prices up. This strategy works 
especially well when there are just a few suppliers (Varian, 2000a). We examine these 
different visions of e-commerce further in Section 1.2 and throughout the book.
Each of the dimensions of e-commerce technology illustrated in Figure 1.2 
deserves a brief exploration, as well as a comparison to both traditional commerce 
and other forms of technology-enabled commerce.

Ubiquity
In traditional commerce, a marketplace is a physical place you visit in order to 
transact. For example, television and radio typically motivate the consumer to go 
someplace to make a purchase. E-commerce, in contrast, is characterized by its 
u­biquity: it is available just about everywhere, at all times. It liberates the market 
from being restricted to a physical space and makes it possible to shop from your 
desktop, at home, at work, or even from your car, using mobile e-commerce. The 
result is called a marketspace—a marketplace extended beyond traditional boundar-
ies and removed from a temporal and geographic location. From a consumer point 
of view, ubiquity reduces transaction costs—the costs of participating in a market. To 
transact, it is no longer necessary that you spend time and money traveling to a 
market. At a broader level, the ubiquity of e-commerce lowers the cognitive energy 
required to transact in a marketspace. Cognitive energy refers to the mental effort 
required to complete a task. Humans generally seek to reduce cognitive energy 
outlays. When given a choice, humans will choose the path requiring the least 
effort—the most convenient path (Shapiro and Varian, 1999; Tversky and Kahneman, 
1981).

EIGHT UNIQUE FEATURES OF E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY
E-commerce technologies provide a number of unique features that have impacted the conduct of business.

54	
	
C H A P T E R  1     I n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  E - c o m m e r c e
Global Reach
E-commerce technology permits commercial transactions to cross cultural, regional, 
and national boundaries far more conveniently and cost-effectively than is true in 
traditional commerce. As a result, the potential market size for e-commerce merchants 
is roughly equal to the size of the world’s online population (an estimated 3.1 billion 
in 2015) (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). More realistically, the Internet makes it much easier 
for start-up e-commerce merchants within a single country to achieve a national 
audience than was ever possible in the past. The total number of users or customers 
an e-commerce business can obtain is a measure of its reach (Evans and Wurster, 
1997).
In contrast, most traditional commerce is local or regional—it involves local 
merchants or national merchants with local outlets. Television and radio stations, and 
newspapers, for instance, are primarily local and regional institutions with limited 
but powerful national networks that can attract a national audience. In contrast to 
e-commerce technology, these older commerce technologies do not easily cross 
national boundaries to a global audience.
Universal Standards
One strikingly unusual feature of e-commerce technologies is that the technical stan-
dards of the Internet, and therefore the technical standards for conducting e-commerce, 
are universal standards—they are shared by all nations around the world. In contrast, 
most traditional commerce technologies differ from one nation to the next. For 
instance, television and radio standards differ around the world, as does cell phone 
technology. The universal technical standards of e-commerce greatly lower market 
entry costs—the cost merchants must pay just to bring their goods to market. At the 
same time, for consumers, universal standards reduce search costs—the effort required 
to find suitable products. And by creating a single, one-world marketspace, where 
prices and product descriptions can be inexpensively displayed for all to see, price 
discovery becomes simpler, faster, and more accurate (Banerjee et al., 2005; Bakos, 
1997; Kambil, 1997). Users, both businesses and individuals, also experience network 
externalities—benefits that arise because everyone uses the same technology. With 
e-commerce technologies, it is possible for the first time in history to easily find many 
of the suppliers, prices, and delivery terms of a specific product anywhere in the 
world, and to view them in a coherent, comparative environment. Although this is 
not necessarily realistic today for all or even most products, it is a potential that will 
be exploited in the future.
Richness
Information richness refers to the complexity and content of a message (Evans and 
Wurster, 1999). Traditional markets, national sales forces, and small retail stores have 
great richness: they are able to provide personal, face-to-face service using aural and 
visual cues when making a sale. The richness of traditional markets makes them a 
powerful selling or commercial environment. Prior to the development of the Web,


55
there was a trade-off between richness and reach: the larger the audience reached, 
the less rich the message. E-commerce technologies have the potential for offering 
considerably more information richness than traditional media such as printing 
presses, radio, and television because they are interactive and can adjust the message 
to individual users. Chatting with an online sales person, for instance, comes very 
close to the customer experience in a small retail shop. The richness enabled by 
e-commerce technologies allows retail and service merchants to market and sell 
“complex” goods and services that heretofore required a face-to-face presentation by 
a sales force to a much larger audience.
Interactivity
Unlike any of the commercial technologies of the twentieth century, with the possible 
exception of the telephone, e-commerce technologies allow for interactivity, meaning 
they enable two-way communication between merchant and consumer and among 
consumers. Traditional television, for instance, cannot ask viewers questions or enter 
into conversations with them, or request that customer information be entered into a 
form. In contrast, all of these activities are possible on an e-commerce site and are 
now commonplace with smartphones, social networks, and Twitter. Interactivity allows 
an online merchant to engage a consumer in ways similar to a face-to-face 
experience.
Information Density
E-commerce technologies vastly increase information density—the total amount 
and quality of information available to all market participants, consumers, and mer-
chants alike. E-commerce technologies reduce information collection, storage, process-
ing, and communication costs. At the same time, these technologies greatly increase 
the currency, accuracy, and timeliness of information—making information more 
useful and important than ever. As a result, information becomes more plentiful, less 
expensive, and of higher quality.
A number of business consequences result from the growth in information density. 
In e-commerce markets, prices and costs become more transparent. Price transparency 
refers to the ease with which consumers can find out the variety of prices in a market; 
cost transparency refers to the ability of consumers to discover the actual costs merchants 
pay for products (Sinha, 2000). But there are advantages for merchants as well. Online 
merchants can discover much more about consumers; this allows merchants to segment 
the market into groups willing to pay different prices and permits them to engage in price 
discrimination—selling the same goods, or nearly the same goods, to different targeted 
groups at different prices. For instance, an online merchant can discover a consumer’s 
avid interest in expensive exotic vacations, and then pitch expensive exotic vacation 
plans to that consumer at a premium price, knowing this person is willing to pay extra 
for such a vacation. At the same time, the online merchant can pitch the same vacation 
plan at a lower price to more price-sensitive consumers. Merchants also have enhanced 
abilities to differentiate their products in terms of cost, brand, and quality.

Personalization/Customization
E-commerce technologies permit personalization: merchants can target their mar-
keting messages to specific individuals by adjusting the message to a person’s name, 
interests, and past purchases. Today this is achieved in a few milliseconds and fol-
lowed by an advertisement based on the consumer’s profile. The technology also 
permits customization—changing the delivered product or service based on a user’s 
preferences or prior behavior. Given the interactive nature of e-commerce technol-
ogy, much information about the consumer can be gathered in the marketplace at 
the moment of purchase. With the increase in information density, a great deal of 
information about the consumer’s past purchases and behavior can be stored and 
used by online merchants. The result is a level of personalization and customization 
unthinkable with traditional commerce technologies. For instance, you may be able 
to shape what you see on television by selecting a channel, but you cannot change 
the contents of the channel you have chosen. In contrast, the online version of the 
Financial Times allows you to select the type of news stories you want to see first, 
and gives you the opportunity to be alerted when certain events happen. Personaliza-
tion and customization allow firms to precisely identify market segments and adjust 
their messages accordingly.
Social Technology: User-Generated Content and Social Networks
In a way quite different from all previous technologies, e-commerce technologies 
have evolved to be much more social by allowing users to create and share content 
with a worldwide community. Using these forms of communication, users are able to 
create new social networks and strengthen existing ones. All previous mass media in 
modern history, including the printing press, used a broadcast model (one-to-many) 
where content is created in a central location by experts (professional writers, editors, 
directors, actors, and producers) and audiences are concentrated in huge aggregates 
to consume a standardized product. The telephone would appear to be an exception 
but it is not a mass communication technology. Instead the telephone is a one-to-one 
technology. E-commerce technologies have the potential to invert this standard media 
model by giving users the power to create and distribute content on a large scale, and 
permit users to program their own content consumption. E-commerce technologies 
provide a unique, many-to-many model of mass communication.
Table 1.2 provides a summary of each of the unique features of e-commerce 
technology and their business significance.
TYPES OF E-COMMERCE
There are several different types of e-commerce and many different ways to character-
ize them. Table 1.3 on page 58 lists the major types of e-commerce discussed in this

the market relationship—who is selling to whom. Mobile, social, and local e-commerce 
can be looked at as subsets of these types of e-commerce.
Business-to-Consumer (B2C) E-commerce
The most commonly discussed type of e-commerce is business-to-consumer (B2C) 
e-commerce, in which online businesses attempt to reach individual consumers. 
B2C commerce includes purchases of retail goods, travel services, and online content. 
B2C has grown exponentially since 1995, and is the type of e-commerce that most

Ubiquity—E-commerce technology is 
available everywhere: at work, at home, 
and elsewhere via mobile devices, 
anytime.
The marketplace is extended beyond traditional 
boundaries and is removed from a temporal and 
geographic location. “Marketspace” is created; 
shopping can take place anywhere. Customer 
convenience is enhanced, and shopping costs are 
reduced.
Global reach—The technology reaches 
across national boundaries, around the 
earth.
Commerce is enabled across cultural and national 
boundaries seamlessly and without modification. 
“Marketspace” includes potentially billions of 
consumers and millions of businesses worldwide.
Universal standards—There is one set 
of technology standards.
There is a common, inexpensive, global technology 
foundation for businesses to use.
Richness—Video, audio, and text 
messages are possible.
Video, audio, and text marketing messages are 
integrated into a single marketing message and 
consuming experience.
Interactivity—The technology works 
through interaction with the user.
Consumers are engaged in a dialog that dynamically 
adjusts the experience to the individual, and makes the 
consumer a co-participant in the process of delivering 
goods to the market.
Information density—The technology 
reduces information costs and raises 
quality.
Information processing, storage, and communication 
costs drop dramatically, while currency, accuracy, and 
timeliness improve greatly. Information becomes 
plentiful, cheap, and accurate.
Personalization/Customization—The 
technology allows personalized 
messages to be delivered to individuals 
as well as groups.
Personalization of marketing messages and 
customization of products and services are based on 
individual characteristics.
Social technology—User-generated 
content and social networks.
New online social and business models enable user 
content creation and distribution, and support social 
networks.

consumers are likely to encounter (see Figure 1.3). Within the B2C category, there 
are many different types of business models. Chapter 5 has a detailed discussion of 
seven different B2C business models: portals, online retailers, content providers, 
transaction brokers, market creators, service providers, and community providers.
Business-to-Business (B2B) E-commerce
Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, in which businesses focus on selling to 
other businesses, is the largest form of e-commerce, with around $6.3 trillion in trans-
actions in the United States in 2015 (see Figure 1.4 on page 60) and about €14.2 trillion 
worldwide. This is a small portion of total B2B commerce (which remains largely 
non-automated), suggesting that B2B e-commerce has significant growth potential. 
The ultimate size of B2B e-commerce is potentially huge. There are two primary 
business models used within the B2B arena: Net marketplaces, which include e-dis-
tributors, e-procurement companies, exchanges and industry consortia, and private 
industrial networks.
Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) E-commerce
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce provides a way for consumers to sell to 
each other, with the help of an online market maker (also called a platform provider) 
such as eBay or Etsy, the classifieds site Craigslist, or on-demand service companies such 
as Airbnb and Uber. Given that in 2014, eBay by itself generated around €76 billion in 
gross merchandise volume around the world, it is probably safe to estimate that the size 
of the global C2C market in 2015 is more than €92 billion (eBay, 2015). In C2C e-com-
merce, the consumer prepares the product for market, places the product for auction or

consumers. Airbnb and Uber provide similar platforms for 
services such as room rental and transportation.

sale, and relies on the market maker to provide catalog, search engine, and transaction-
clearing capabilities so that products can be easily displayed, discovered, and paid for.
Mobile E-commerce (M-commerce)
Mobile e-commerce, or m-commerce, refers to the use of mobile devices to enable 
online transactions. Described more fully in Chapter 2, m-commerce involves the use 
of cellular and wireless networks to connect laptops, smartphones such as the iPhone 
and Android phones, and tablet computers such as the iPad to the Internet. Once 
connected, mobile consumers can conduct transactions, including stock trades, in-store 
price comparisons, banking, travel reservations, and more. M-commerce purchases 
are expected to reach around £19 billion in 2015 in the United Kingdom, for instance, 
and to grow rapidly over the next five years (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b).
Social E-commerce
Social e-commerce is e-commerce that is enabled by social networks and online 
social relationships. It is sometimes also referred to as Facebook commerce, but in 
actuality is a much larger phenomenon that extends beyond just Facebook. The growth

of social e-commerce is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing 
popularity of social sign-on (signing onto Web sites using your Facebook or other social 
network ID), network notification (the sharing of approval or disapproval of products, 
services, and content via Facebook’s Like button or Twitter tweets), online collabora-
tive shopping tools, and social search (recommendations from online trusted friends). 
Social e-commerce is still in its infancy, but in 2014, the top 500 retailers in Internet 
Retailer’s Social Media 500 earned about $3.3 billion from social commerce, a 25% 
increase over 2013, and shoppers clicking from social networks to Social Media 500 
retailers’ Web sites accounted for about 5.8% of all traffic to those Web sites in 2014, 
up from about 5.4% in the previous year (Zaroban, 2015).
Local E-commerce
Local e-commerce, as its name suggests, is a form of e-commerce that is focused on 
engaging the consumer based on his or her current geographic location. Local mer-
chants use a variety of online marketing techniques to drive consumers to their stores. 
Local e-commerce is the third prong of the mobile, social, local e-commerce wave, and 
fueled by an explosion of interest in local on-demand services such as Uber, is expected 
to grow in the United States to over $25 billion in 2015.

GROWTH OF THE INTERNET, WEB, AND MOBILE PLATFORM
The technology juggernauts behind e-commerce are the Internet, the Web, and increas-
ingly, the mobile platform. We describe the Internet, Web, and mobile platform in 
some detail in Chapter 2. The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks 
built on common standards. Created in the late 1960s to connect a small number of 
mainframe computers and their users, the Internet has since grown into the world’s 
largest network. It is impossible to say with certainty exactly how many computers 
and other wireless access devices such as smartphones are connected to the Internet 
worldwide at any one time, but the number is clearly more than 1 billion. The Internet 
links businesses, educational institutions, government agencies, and individuals 
together, and provides users with services such as e-mail, document transfer, shopping, 
research, instant messaging, music, videos, and news.
One way to measure the growth of the Internet is by looking at the number 
of Internet hosts with domain names. (An Internet host is defined by the Internet 
Systems Consortium as any IP address that returns a domain name in the in-addr.arpa 
Internet

on common standards
B2B e-commerce dwarfs all other forms of e-commerce; mobile, social, and local e-commerce, although 
growing rapidly, are still relatively small in comparison to “traditional” e-commerce.

domain, which is a special part of the DNS namespace that resolves IP addresses into 
domain names.) In July 2015, there were more than 1 billion Internet hosts in over 
245 countries, up from just 70 million in 2000 (Internet Systems Consortium, 2015).
The Internet has shown extraordinary growth patterns when compared to other 
electronic technologies of the past. It took radio 38 years to achieve a 30% share of U.S. 
households. It took television 17 years to achieve a 30% share. It took only 10 years 
for the Internet/Web to achieve a 53% share of U.S. households once a graphical user 
interface was invented for the Web in 1993.
The World Wide Web (the Web) is one of the most popular services that runs 
on the Internet infrastructure. The Web was the original “killer app” that made the 
Internet commercially interesting and extraordinarily popular. The Web was developed 
in the early 1990s and hence is of much more recent vintage than the Internet. We 
describe the Web in some detail in Chapter 2. The Web provides access to billions of 
Web pages indexed by Google and other search engines. These pages are created in a 
language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML pages can contain text, 
graphics, animations, and other objects. You can find an exceptionally wide range of 
information on Web pages, ranging from the entire collection of public records from 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the card catalog of your local library, to 
millions of music tracks and videos. The Internet prior to the Web was primarily used 
for text communications, file transfers, and remote computing. The Web introduced 
far more powerful and commercially interesting, colorful multimedia capabilities of 
direct relevance to commerce. In essence, the Web added color, voice, and video to 
the Internet, creating a communications infrastructure and information storage system 
that rivals television, radio, magazines, and even libraries.
There is no precise measurement of the number of Web pages in existence, in 
part because today’s search engines index only a portion of the known universe of 
Web pages, and also because the size of the Web universe is unknown. Google has 
identified over 60 trillion unique URLs, up from 1 trillion in 2008, although many of 
these pages do not necessarily contain unique content (Google, 2014). In addition to 
this “surface” or “visible” Web, there is also the so-called deep Web that is reportedly 
500 to 1,000 times greater than the surface Web. The deep Web contains databases and 
other content that is not routinely indexed by search engines such as Google. Although 
the total size of the Web is not known, what is indisputable is that Web content has 
grown exponentially since 1993.
The mobile platform is the newest development in Internet infrastructure. The 
mobile platform provides the ability to access the Internet from a variety of mobile 
devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other ultra-lightweight laptop computers 
via wireless networks or cell phone service. In 2015, there are over 350 million mobile 
devices in the United States that can be connected to the Internet (more than 1 device 
for each person in the United States), and that number is expected to grow to around 
370 million by 2019 (eMarketer, Inc., 2015e). Figure 1.6 illustrates the rapid growth 
of mobile Internet access.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
WILL APPS MAKE THE WEB IRRELEVANT?
Nowadays, it’s hard to recall a time 
before the Web. How did we get 
along without the ability to pull up 
a Web browser and search for any 
item, learn about any topic, or play just 
about any type of game? Though the Web 
has come a remarkably long way from its humble 
beginnings, many experts claim that the Web’s 
best days are behind it, and that there’s a new 
player on the field: apps. Opinions vary widely over 
the future role of the Web in a world where apps 
have become an ever larger portion of the Internet 
marketspace. In 10 years, will Web browsers be 
forgotten relics, as we rely entirely on apps to do 
both our work and our play on the Internet? Will 
the Web and apps coexist peacefully as vital cogs 
in the Internet ecosystem? Or will the app craze 
eventually die down as tech users gravitate back 
toward the Web as the primary way to perform 
Internet-related tasks?
Apps have grown into a disruptive force ever 
since Apple launched its App Store in 2008. The 
list of industries apps have disrupted is wide-
ranging: communications, media and entertain-
ment, logistics, education, healthcare, and most 
recently, with Uber, the taxi industry. Despite not 
even existing prior to 2008, in 2015, sales of apps 
are expected to account for well over $30 billion 
in revenues worldwide, and the app economy is 
continuing to show robust growth, with estimates 
of $70 billion in revenue by 2017. More of those 
revenues are likely to come from in-app purchases 
than from paid app downloads. Not only that, but 
the growth is not coming from more users trying 
the same small number of apps. Although usage 
of apps tends to be highly concentrated, with 
nearly 80% of smartphone app minutes spent on 
an individual’s top 3 apps, consumers are trying 
new apps all the time and visit about 25 apps 
per month, leaving plenty of room for new app 
developers to innovate and create best-selling apps. 
In fact, according to mobile advertising company 
Flurry, 280 million people worldwide qualify as 
mobile addicts, which they define as someone who 
launches a smartphone app more than 60 times 
a day. According to Flurry, the number of such 
addicts has increased by about 350% from 2013 
to 2015. 
In January 2014, for the first time ever, 
Americans used apps more than desktop comput-
ers to access the Internet. The time U.S. adults are 
spending using mobile apps has exploded, growing 
by 90% over the past two years, and now account-
ing for 53.8% of total digital media time spent; 
time spent on the desktop now accounts for just 
38%, and mobile browsers just 8.2%. U.S. adults 
are spending 68 hours a month (over 2 hours a 
day) within apps on their smartphones, while 
young adults between the ages of 18–24 spend 
over 90 hours a month (3+ hours a day). Consum-
ers have gravitated to apps for several reasons. 
First, smartphones and tablet computers enable 
users to use apps anywhere, instead of being teth-
ered to a desktop or having to lug a heavy laptop 
around. Of course, smartphones and tablets enable 
users to use the Web too, but apps are often more 
convenient and boast more streamlined, elegant 
interfaces than mobile Web browsers.
Not only are apps more appealing in certain 
ways to consumers, they are much more appealing 
to content creators and media companies. Apps 
are much easier to control and monetize than 
Web sites, not to mention they can’t be crawled by 
Google or other services. On the Web, the average 
price of ads per thousand impressions is falling, 
and after twenty years, many content providers 
are still mostly struggling to turn the Internet into 
a profitable content delivery platform. Much of 
software and media companies’ focus has shifted 
to developing mobile apps for this reason.

These trends are why some pundits boldly 
proclaim that the Web is dead, and that the shift 
from the Web to apps has only just started. These 
analysts believe that the Internet will be used to 
transport data, but individual app interfaces will 
replace the Web browser as the most common way 
to access and display content. Even the creator of 
the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, feels that the Web as we 
know it is being threatened. That’s not a good sign. 
But there is no predictive consensus about the 
role of the Web in our lives in the next decade and 
beyond. Many analysts believe the demise of the 
Web has been greatly exaggerated, and that the 
Web boasts many advantages over today’s apps 
that users will be unwilling to relinquish. Although 
apps may be more convenient than the Web in 
many respects, the depth of the Web browsing 
experience trumps that of apps. The Web is a 
vibrant, diverse array of sites, and browsers have 
an openness and flexibility that apps lack. The con-
nections between Web sites enhance their useful-
ness and value to users, and apps that instead seek 
to lock users in cannot offer the same experience.
Other analysts who are more optimistic 
about the Web’s chances to remain relevant in an 
increasingly app-driven online marketplace feel 
this way because of the emergence of HTML5. 
HTML5 is a new markup language that will 
enable more dynamic Web content and allow for 
browser-accessible Web apps that are as appealing 
as device-specific apps. In fact, there is another 
group of analysts who believe that apps and the 
Web are going to come together, with 
HTML5 bringing the best of the app experi-
ence to the Web, and with apps developing new 
Web-like capabilities. Already, work is underway 
to create more “smart” apps that handle a wider 
array of tasks than today’s apps can handle, such 
as apps with Siri integration.
A shift towards apps and away from the Web 
could have a ripple effect on e-commerce firms. 
As the pioneer of apps and the market leader in 
apps, smartphones, and tablet computers, Apple 
stands to gain from a shift towards apps, and 
although it will also face increasing opposition 
from other companies, including Google, the 
established success of the App Store will make 
it next to impossible to dethrone Apple. While 
Google’s Google Play store has dwarfed the App 
Store in downloads in 2015, Apple nevertheless 
maintains a strong lead in app revenues. Google’s 
search business is likely to suffer from all of the 
“walled garden” apps that it cannot access, but 
it also has a major stake in the world of smart-
phones, tablets, and apps itself with its Android 
operating system, which is used by over 80% of 
smartphones worldwide. Facebook has already 
seen its members make the transition from using 
its site on the Web to using its mobile app and has 
made, and continues to make, significant invest-
ments in standalone apps, such as Instagram and 
WhatsApp. Web-based companies that fail to find 
an answer to the growth of the mobile platform 
may eventually fall by the wayside.

ORIGINS AND GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE
It is difficult to pinpoint just when e-commerce began. There were several precursors 
to e-commerce. In the late 1970s, a pharmaceutical firm named Baxter Healthcare 
initiated a primitive form of B2B e-commerce by using a telephone-based modem that 
permitted hospitals to reorder supplies from Baxter. This system was later expanded 
during the 1980s into a PC-based remote order entry system and was widely copied 
throughout the United States long before the Internet became a commercial environ-
ment. The 1980s saw the development of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards 
that permitted firms to exchange commercial documents and conduct digital com-
mercial transactions across private networks.
In the B2C arena, the first truly large-scale digitally enabled transaction system 
was deployed in France in 1981. The Minitel was a French videotext system that 
combined a telephone with an 8-inch screen. By the mid-1980s, more than 3 million 
Minitels were deployed, and more than 13,000 different services were available, 
including ticket agencies, travel services, retail products, and online banking. The 
Minitel service continued in existence until December 31, 2006, when it was finally 
discontinued by its owner, France Telecom.
However, none of these precursor systems had the functionality of the Internet. 
Generally, when we think of e-commerce today, it is inextricably linked to the Inter-
net. For our purposes, we will say e-commerce begins in 1995, following the appear-
ance of the first banner advertisements placed by AT&T, Volvo, Sprint, and others on 
Hotwired in late October 1994, and the first sales of banner ad space by Netscape and 
Infoseek in early 1995. Since then, e-commerce has been the fastest growing form of 
commerce in the United States. 
The data suggests that, over the next five years, global retail e-commerce will grow 
by over 20% annually, much faster than traditional retail sales (which are growing 
at only about 6% a year). There is tremendous upside potential. Today, for instance, 
retail e-commerce is still a very small part (around 7%) of the overall €21 trillion retail 
market, and under current projections, in 2019, will still only be about 12% of total 
retail sales. There is obviously much room to grow (see Figure 1.7). However, it’s not 
likely that retail e-commerce revenues will continue to expand forever at double-digit 
rates. As online sales become a larger percentage of all sales, online sales growth will 
likely eventually decline to that growth level. This point still appears to be a long 
way off. Online content sales, everything from music, to video, medical information, 
games, and entertainment, have an even longer period to grow before they hit any 
ceiling effects.
	 1.2	
E-COMMERCE: A BRIEF HISTORY
Although e-commerce is not very old, it already has a tumultuous history. The history 
of e-commerce can be usefully divided into three periods: 1995–2000, the period 
of invention; 2001–2006, the period of consolidation; and 2007–present, a period of 

	
E - c o m m e r c e :  A  B r i e f  H i s t o r y 	

67
reinvention with social, mobile, and local expansion. The following examines each 
of these periods briefly, while Figure 1.8 places them in context along a timeline. 
E-COMMERCE 1995–2000: INVENTION
The early years of e-commerce were a period of explosive growth and extraordinary 
innovation, beginning in 1995 with the first widespread use of the Web to advertise 
products. During this Invention period, e-commerce meant selling retail goods, usually 
quite simple goods, on the Internet. There simply was not enough bandwidth for 
more complex products. Marketing was limited to unsophisticated static display ads 
and not very powerful search engines. The Web policy of most large firms, if they had 
one at all, was to have a basic static Web site depicting their brands. The rapid growth 
in e-commerce was fueled by over $125 billion in U.S. venture capital. This period 
of e-commerce came to a close in 2000 when stock market valuations plunged, with 
thousands of companies disappearing (the “dot-com crash”). 
The early years of e-commerce were also one of the most euphoric of times in 
commercial history. It was also a time when key e-commerce concepts were devel-
oped. For computer scientists and information technologists, the early success of 
e-commerce was a powerful vindication of a set of information technologies that 
had developed over a period of 40 years—extending from the development of the 
early Internet, to the PC, to local area networks. The vision was of a universal 
E-commerce retail is still just a small part of the overall global retail market, but with much room to grow in 
the future.

communications and computing environment that everyone on Earth could access 
with cheap, inexpensive computers—a worldwide universe of knowledge stored on 
HTML pages created by hundreds of millions of individuals and thousands of librar-
ies, governments, and scientific institutes. Technologists celebrated the fact that the 
Internet was not controlled by anyone or any nation, but was free to all. They believed 
the Internet—and the e-commerce that rose on this infrastructure—should remain a 
self-governed, self-regulated environment.
For economists, the early years of e-commerce raised the realistic prospect of a 
nearly perfect competitive market: where price, cost, and quality information are equally 
distributed, a nearly infinite set of suppliers compete against one another, and customers 
have access to all relevant market information worldwide. The Internet would spawn 
digital markets where information would be nearly perfect—something that is rarely 
true in other real-world markets. Merchants in turn would have equal direct access to 
hundreds of millions of customers. In this near-perfect information marketspace, trans-
action costs would plummet because search costs—the cost of searching for prices, 
product descriptions, payment settlement, and order fulfillment—would all fall drasti-
cally (Bakos, 1997). For merchants, the cost of searching for customers would also fall, 
reducing the need for wasteful advertising. At the same time, advertisements could be 
personalized to the needs of every customer. Prices and even costs would be increasingly 
transparent to the consumer, who could now know exactly and instantly the worldwide

best price, quality, and availability of most products. Information asymmetry would be 
greatly reduced. Given the instant nature of Internet communications, the availability 
of powerful sales information systems, and the low cost involved in changing prices on 
a Web site (low menu costs), producers could dynamically price their products to reflect 
actual demand, ending the idea of one national price, or one suggested manufacturer’s 
list price. In turn, market middlemen—the distributors and wholesalers who are inter-
mediaries between producers and consumers, each demanding a payment and raising 
costs while adding little value—would disappear (disintermediation). Manufacturers 
and content originators would develop direct market relationships with their customers. 
The resulting intense competition, the decline of intermediaries, and the lower transac-
tion costs would eliminate product brands, and along with these, the possibility of 
monopoly profits based on brands, geography, or special access to factors of production. 
Prices for products and services would fall to the point where prices covered costs of 
production plus a fair, “market rate” of return on capital, plus additional small payments 
for entrepreneurial effort (that would not last long). Unfair competitive advantages 
(which occur when one competitor has an advantage others cannot purchase) would be 
reduced, as would extraordinary returns on invested capital. This vision was called 
friction-free commerce (Smith et al., 2000).
For real-world entrepreneurs, their financial backers, and marketing professionals, 
e-commerce represented an extraordinary opportunity to earn far above normal returns 
on investment. This is just the opposite of what economists hoped for. The e-commerce 
marketspace represented access to millions of consumers worldwide who used the 
Internet and a set of marketing communications technologies (e-mail and Web pages) 
that was universal, inexpensive, and powerful. These new technologies would permit 
marketers to practice what they always had done—segmenting the market into groups 
with different needs and price sensitivity, targeting the segments with branding and 
promotional messages, and positioning the product and pricing for each group—but with 
even more precision. In this new marketspace, extraordinary profits would go to first 
movers—those firms who were first to market in a particular area and who moved 
quickly to gather market share. In a “winner take all” market, first movers could establish 
a large customer base quickly, build brand name recognition early, create an entirely 
new distribution channel, and then inhibit competitors (new entrants) by building in 
switching costs for their customers through proprietary interface designs and features 
available only at one site. The idea for entrepreneurs was to create near monopolies 
online based on size, convenience, selection, and brand. Online businesses using the 
new technology could create informative, community-like features unavailable to tra-
ditional merchants. These “communities of consumption” also would add value and be 
difficult for traditional merchants to imitate. The thinking was that once customers 
became accustomed to using a company’s unique Web interface and feature set, they 
could not easily be switched to competitors. In the best case, the entrepreneurial firm 
would invent proprietary technologies and techniques that almost everyone adopted, 
creating a network effect. A network effect occurs where all participants receive value 
from the fact that everyone else uses the same tool or product (for example, a common 
operating system, telephone system, or software application such as a proprietary instant

messaging standard or an operating system such as Windows), all of which increase in 
value as more people adopt them.2
To initiate this process, entrepreneurs argued that prices would have to be very 
low to attract customers and fend off potential competitors. E-commerce was, after all, 
a totally new way of shopping that would have to offer some immediate cost benefits 
to consumers. However, because doing business on the Web was supposedly so much 
more efficient when compared to traditional “bricks-and-mortar” businesses (even 
when compared to the direct mail catalog business) and because the costs of customer 
acquisition and retention would supposedly be so much lower, profits would inevitably 
materialize out of these efficiencies. Given these dynamics, market share, the number 
of visitors to a site (“eyeballs”), and gross revenue became far more important in the 
earlier stages of an online firm than earnings or profits. Entrepreneurs and their 
financial backers in the early years of e-commerce expected that extraordinary profit-
ability would come, but only after several years of losses.
Thus, the early years of e-commerce were driven largely by visions of prof-
iting from new technology, with the emphasis on quickly achieving very high 
market visibility. The source of financing was venture capital funds. The ideology 
of the period emphasized the ungoverned “Wild West” character of the Web and 
the feeling that governments and courts could not possibly limit or regulate the 
Internet; there was a general belief that traditional corporations were too slow and 
bureaucratic, too stuck in the old ways of doing business, to “get it”—to be competi-
tive in e-commerce. Young entrepreneurs were therefore the driving force behind 
e-commerce, backed by huge amounts of money invested by venture capitalists. 
The emphasis was on disrupting (destroying) traditional distribution channels and 
disintermediating existing channels, using new pure online companies who aimed 
to achieve impregnable first-mover advantages. Overall, this period of e-commerce 
was characterized by experimentation, capitalization, and hypercompetition 
(Varian, 2000b).
E-COMMERCE 2001–2006: CONSOLIDATION
In the second period of e-commerce, from 2000 to 2006, a sobering period of reassess-
ment of e-commerce occurred, with many critics doubting its long-term prospects. 
Emphasis shifted to a more “business-driven” approach rather than being technology 
driven; large traditional firms learned how to use the Web to strengthen their market 
positions; brand extension and strengthening became more important than creating 
new brands; financing shrunk as capital markets shunned start-up firms; and tradi-
tional bank financing based on profitability returned. 
During this period of consolidation, e-commerce changed to include not just 
retail products but also more complex services such as travel and financial services. 
This period was enabled by widespread adoption of broadband networks in American 
homes and businesses, coupled with the growing power and lower prices of personal

computers that were the primary means of accessing the Internet, usually from work 
or home. Marketing on the Internet increasingly meant using search engine advertis-
ing targeted to user queries, rich media and video ads, and behavioral targeting of 
marketing messages based on ad networks and auction markets. The Web policy of 
both large and small firms expanded to include a broader “Web presence” that included 
not just Web sites, but also e-mail, display, and search engine campaigns; multiple Web 
sites for each product; and the building of some limited community feedback facilities. 
E-commerce in this period was growing again by more than 10% a year. 
E-COMMERCE 2007–PRESENT: REINVENTION
Beginning in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone, to the present day, e-commerce 
has been transformed yet again by the rapid growth of Web 2.0 (a set of applications 
and technologies that enable user-generated content, such as online social networks, 
blogs, video and photo sharing sites, and wikis), widespread adoption of consumer 
mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, the expansion of e-com-
merce to include local goods and services, and the emergence of an on-demand service 
economy enabled by millions of apps on mobile devices and cloud computing. This 
period can be seen as both a sociological, as well as a technological and business, 
phenomenon.
The defining characteristics of this period are often characterized as the “social, 
mobile, local” online world. Entertainment content has developed as a major source 
of e-commerce revenues and mobile devices have become entertainment centers, 
as well as on-the-go shopping devices for retail goods and services. Marketing has 
been transformed by the increasing use of social networks, word-of-mouth, viral 
marketing, and much more powerful data repositories and analytic tools for truly 
personal marketing. Firms have greatly expanded their online presence by moving 
beyond static Web pages to social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and 
Instagram in an attempt to surround the online consumer with coordinated market-
ing messages. These social networks share many common characteristics. First, they 
rely on user-generated content. “Regular” people (not just experts or professionals) 
are creating, sharing, and broadcasting content to huge audiences. They are inher-
ently highly interactive, creating new opportunities for people to socially connect 
to others. They attract extremely large audiences (about 1.5 billion monthly active 
users worldwide as of June 2015 in the case of Facebook). These audiences present 
marketers with extraordinary opportunities for targeted marketing and advertising. 
More recently, the re-invention of the Web and e-commerce has resulted in a 
new set of on-demand, personal service businesses such as Uber, Airbnb, Instacart, 
Handy, and Homejoy. These businesses have been able to tap into a large reservoir 
of unused assets (cars, spare rooms, and personal spare time) and to create lucrative 
markets based on the mobile platform infrastructure. The Insight on Business case, 
Rocket Internet, takes a look at Rocket Internet, which has mentored a number of 
these new social, mobile, and local e-commerce ventures.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
ROCKET INTERNET
By now we’ve all heard the story of 
code written by Mark Zuckerberg in 
a Harvard dorm room blossoming 
into a multi-billion dollar business. 
These days, it’s harder than ever to keep 
track of all the tech startups being bought 
for millions and even billions of euros, often even 
without any revenue to show for themselves. Many 
of them have something in common—they have 
been nurtured, and in some cases, whipped into 
shape, with the help of an “incubator.”
Incubators have come to occupy a vital role 
in tech, helping new businesses move from little 
more than a great idea to an established, vibrant 
business. Rocket Internet is one such incubator. 
Founded in 2007 by German entrepreneurs Alex-
ander, Oliver, and Marc Samwer, Rocket Internet 
launches e-commerce and other Internet start-ups 
in emerging markets, with the goal of becoming 
the world’s largest Internet platform outside the 
United States and China. Headquartered in Berlin 
and with 25 international offices, Rocket Inter-
net has over 75 independent companies active 
in 110 countries in its portfolio In 2014, Rocket 
went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, in 
the largest German technology IPO in the past 
decade. The initial pricing valued the company 
at around €6.5 billion. In the previous two years, 
the company had raised nearly €3.2 billion from 
investors. In 2015, the share price dropped steeply 
for much of the year, but made a late rebound to 
approximately €30 per share. 
Rocket bills itself as more than a venture 
capital firm or typical incubator. Rocket has a 
variety of teams that work closely with each of its 
ventures, including teams focused on engineering 
and product development, online marketing, CRM, 
business intelligence, operations, HR, and finance. 
Rocket also helps its start-ups by providing access 
to centralized logistics and other back-office 
functions to help them cut down on operational 
costs. The growing network of Rocket Internet 
companies is also a valuable resource. In many 
emerging markets, the most talented workers end 
up in established industries, but Rocket is ensur-
ing that e-commerce also captures top talent in 
those regions. Prominent companies launched via 
Rocket Internet include Germany’s Zalando, India’s 
Jabong, Russia’s Lamoda, Australia’s The Iconic 
and Zanui, Pakistan’s Azmalo (now Kaymu) and 
Daraz, and Southeast Asia’s Zalora. 
Former Rocket Internet employees also have 
a strong track record with their own independent 
start-ups once they’ve left the parent company. 
These employees note that their experience at 
Rocket has made the prospect of starting new 
businesses seem less intimidating. They also praise 
Oliver Samwer’s attention to detail and emphasis 
on making decisions using data. Rocket Internet 
start-ups collect and analyze as much data as pos-
sible on their markets and customers. They also 
report that their association with Rocket Internet 
gives them more credibility with major investors.
Rocket Internet has yet to launch many new 
businesses in the United States, where the com-
petitive environment is much more difficult than 
in emerging markets and even Europe. In 2015, 
Rocket Internet began the process of selling 
its holdings in India, including Jabong and on-
demand food delivery company Foodpanda, due 
to increasingly heavy competition from India’s 
booming startup environment. Many of Rocket’s 
ventures focus on emerging markets because the 
profit margins are higher although the markets are 
smaller. This is in contrast to Amazon, for example, 
which has razor-thin margins but enormous scope 
and market reach. Critics of Rocket Internet claim 
that the company is less concerned with innova-
tion than it is with launching clones of successful 
United States-based businesses in other markets.

For instance, in 2014, Rocket launched Zipjet, an 
on-demand laundry service modeled after U.S. 
counterpart Washio, and ShopWings, an online 
supermarket resembling Instacart, a similar service 
launched in major U.S. cities. Oliver Samwer coun-
ters talk of clones, noting that for the majority of 
these types of businesses, truly disruptive innova-
tion is rare, and the business succeeds or not based 
on the efficiency of its business processes. Marc 
Samwer adds that Rocket Internet takes the best 
ideas and improves on them by localizing them to 
better fit specific areas. Investors are also con-
cerned about the profitability of Rocket’s portfolio. 
Many of Rocket’s companies have market leader 
status in their respective areas, but hardly any of 
them are currently profitable. Rocket contends 
that by focusing on growth in emerging markets 
first, profits will come in time, but in 2015 Rocket 
amassed more than €46 million in yearly losses by 
the end of October, despite posting 142% revenue 
growth in its subset of “proven winner” businesses, 
nearly all of which are still unprofitable themselves.
Nevertheless, Rocket has captured significant 
market share in many industries by launching 
companies modeled after established businesses 
in emerging markets, and then selling these ven-
tures to those established businesses when they’re 
looking to expand into those markets. eBay’s 
acquisition of Germany’s leading auction site, 
Alando, where the Samwers got their start, is an 
example. Amazon was rumored to be interested 
in Jabong, though those talks were abandoned 
in 2015, and Africa-based Jumia and Southeast 
Asia-based Lazada, also modeled after 
Amazon, could conceivably be additional 
targets for Amazon. Payleven is a European 
mobile payment company modeled after Square 
and Paypal. Increasingly, however, Rocket is 
looking to create sustainable companies who 
are focused less on their eventual sale to bigger 
companies and more on their own growth. Oliver 
Samwer believes that in the past, it may have sold 
some businesses, such as Alando, too early, but 
that it was necessary in order for Rocket to build 
a track record. Now that it has one, it can afford 
to take a longer-term view.
Startupbootcamp is another start-up accel-
erator based in Europe that selects 10 start-
ups from a pool of hundreds of applicants and 
provides cutting-edge training and a network of 
professionals to help them go from an idea to a 
thriving business. Applicants receive coaching from 
a network of  volunteer mentors from successful 
tech companies as well as significant stipends for 
living expenses and partner deals. After 3 months, 
start-ups pitch their businesses to venture capital-
ists and investors. Established companies also have 
made deals with Startupbootcamp to mentor spe-
cific types of businesses, such as AVG Technologies’ 
agreement to invest in Startupbootcamp’s NFC 
and Contactless division. Though Internet start-ups 
have boomed, busted, and are now booming again, 
as the global economy continues to rely more on 
the Internet and Internet-based services, incuba-
tors and accelerators like Rocket Internet and 
Startupbootcamp are here to stay.

ASSESSING E-COMMERCE: SUCCESSES, SURPRISES, AND FAILURES
Looking back at the evolution of e-commerce, it is apparent that e-commerce has been 
a stunning technological success as the Internet and the Web ramped up from a few 
thousand to billions of e-commerce transactions per year, and this year will generate 
an estimated €1.96 trillion in total B2C revenues and around €14.2 trillion in B2B rev-
enues, with around 1.4 billion online buyers in the United States. With enhancements

and strengthening, described in later chapters, it is clear that e-commerce’s digital 
infrastructure is solid enough to sustain significant growth in e-commerce during the 
next decade. The Internet scales well. The “e” in e-commerce has been an overwhelm-
ing success.
From a business perspective, though, the early years of e-commerce were a mixed 
success, and offered many surprises. Only about 10% of dot-coms formed since 1995 
have survived as independent companies in 2015. Only a very tiny percentage of these 
survivors are profitable. Yet online B2C sales of goods and services are still growing very 
rapidly. Contrary to economists’ hopes, online sales are increasingly concentrated in the 
top ten retailers who account for over 50% of all online retail sales (Internet Retailer, 
2015). So thousands of firms have failed, and those few that have survived dominate 
the market. The idea of thousands of suppliers competing on price has been replaced 
by a market dominated by giant firms. Consumers have learned to use the Web as a 
powerful source of information about products they actually purchase through other 
channels, such as at a traditional bricks-and-mortar store. For instance, a 2014 study 
found that almost 90% of those surveyed “webroomed” (researched a product online 
before purchasing at a physical store) (Interactions Consumer Experience Marketing, 
Inc., 2014). This is especially true of expensive consumer durables such as appliances, 
automobiles, and electronics. This offline “Internet-influenced” commerce is very dif-
ficult to estimate, but is believed to be somewhere around $1.5 trillion in 2015 (Forrester 
Research, 2014). Altogether then, B2C retail e-commerce (actual online purchases) 
and purchases influenced by online shopping but actually buying in a store (Internet-
influenced commerce) are expected to amount to almost $1.9 trillion in 2015, or almost 
40% of total retail sales in the United States. The “commerce” in e-commerce is basically 
very sound, at least in the sense of attracting a growing number of customers and 
generating revenues and profits for large e-commerce players. 
Although e-commerce has grown at an extremely rapid pace in customers and 
revenues, it is clear that many of the visions, predictions, and assertions about 
e-commerce developed in the early years have not have been fulfilled. For instance, 
economists’ visions of “friction-free” commerce have not been entirely realized. 
Prices are sometimes lower online, but the low prices are sometimes a function 
of entrepreneurs selling products below their costs. In some cases, online prices 
are higher than those of local merchants, as consumers are willing to pay a small 
premium for the convenience of buying online. Consumers are less price sensitive 
than expected; surprisingly, the Web sites with the highest revenue often have the 
highest prices. There remains considerable persistent and even increasing price 
dispersion: online competition has lowered prices, but price dispersion remains 
pervasive in many markets despite lower search costs (Levin, 2011; Ghose and Yao, 
2010). In a study of 50,000 goods in the United Kingdom and the United States, 
researchers found Internet prices were sticky even in the face of large changes 
in demand, online merchants did not alter prices significantly more than offline 
merchants, and price dispersion across online sellers was somewhat greater than 
traditional brick and mortar stores (Gorodnichenko, et al., 2014). The concept of one 
world, one market, one price has not occurred in reality as entrepreneurs discover 

76	
	
C H A P T E R  1     I n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  E - c o m m e r c e
new ways to differentiate their products and services. While for the most part Internet 
prices save consumers about 20% on average when compared to in-store prices, some-
times online prices are higher than for similar products purchased offline, especially if 
shipping costs are considered. For instance, prices on books and CDs vary by as much 
as 50%, and prices for airline tickets as much as 20% (Alessandria, 2009; Aguiar and 
Hurst, 2008; Baye, 2004; Baye et al., 2004; Brynjolfsson and Smith, 2000; Bailey, 1998a, 
b). Merchants have adjusted to the competitive Internet environment by engaging in 
“hit-and-run pricing” or changing prices every day or hour (using “flash pricing” or 
“flash sales”) so competitors never know what they are charging (neither do custom-
ers); by making their prices hard to discover and sowing confusion among consum-
ers by “baiting and switching” customers from low-margin products to high-margin 
products with supposedly “higher quality.” Finally, brands remain very important in 
e-commerce—consumers trust some firms more than others to deliver a high-quality 
product on time and they are willing to pay for it (Rosso and Jansen, 2010).
The “perfect competition” model of extreme market efficiency has not come 
to pass. Merchants and marketers are continually introducing information asym-
metries. Search costs have fallen overall, but the overall transaction cost of actually 
completing a purchase in e-commerce remains high because users have a bewilder-
ing number of new questions to consider: Will the merchant actually deliver? What 
is the time frame of delivery? Does the merchant really stock this item? How do 
I fill out this form? Many potential e-commerce purchases are terminated in the 
shopping cart stage because of these consumer uncertainties. Some people still find 
it easier to call a trusted catalog merchant on the telephone than to order on a Web 
site. Finally, intermediaries have not disappeared as predicted. Most manufacturers, 
for instance, have not adopted the manufacturer-direct sales model of online sales, 
and some that had, such as Sony, have returned to an intermediary model. Dell, 
one of the pioneers of online manufacturer-direct sales, has moved toward a mixed 
model heavily reliant on in-store sales where customers can “kick the tires;” Apple’s 
physical stores are among the most successful stores in the world. People still like 
to shop in a physical store.
If anything, e-commerce has created many opportunities for middlemen to aggre-
gate content, products, and services and thereby introduce themselves as the “new” 
intermediaries. Third-party travel sites such as Travelocity, Orbitz, and Expedia are 
an example of this kind of intermediary. E-commerce has not driven existing retail 
chains and catalog merchants out of business, although it has created opportunities 
for entrepreneurial online-only firms to succeed.
The visions of many entrepreneurs and venture capitalists for e-commerce have 
not materialized exactly as predicted either. First-mover advantage appears to have 
succeeded only for a very small group of companies, albeit some of them extremely 
well-known, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others. Getting big fast sometimes 
works, but often not. Historically, first movers have been long-term losers, with the 
early-to-market innovators usually being displaced by established “fast-follower” firms 
with the right complement of financial, marketing, legal, and production assets needed 
to develop mature markets, and this has proved true for e-commerce as well. Many

77
e-commerce first movers, such as eToys, FogDog (sporting goods), Webvan (grocer-
ies), and Eve.com (beauty products), failed. Customer acquisition and retention costs 
during the early years of e-commerce were extraordinarily high, with some firms, 
such as E*Trade and other financial service firms, paying up to $400 to acquire a new 
customer. The overall costs of doing business online—including the costs of technol-
ogy, site design and maintenance, and warehouses for fulfillment—are often no lower 
than the costs faced by the most efficient bricks-and-mortar stores. A large warehouse 
costs tens of millions of dollars regardless of a firm’s online presence. The knowledge 
of how to run the warehouse is priceless, and not easily moved. The start-up costs 
can be staggering. Attempting to achieve or enhance profitability by raising prices has 
often led to large customer defections. From the e-commerce merchant’s perspective, 
the “e” in e-commerce does not stand for “easy.”
On the other hand, there have been some extraordinary, and unanticipated sur-
prises in the evolution of e-commerce. Few predicted the impact of the mobile plat-
form. Few anticipated the rapid growth of social networks or their growing success as 
advertising platforms based on a more detailed understanding of personal behavior 
than even Google has achieved. And few, if any, anticipated the emergence of on-
demand e-commerce, which enables people to use their mobile devices to order up 
everything from taxis, to groceries, to laundry service. 
	 1.3	
UNDERSTANDING E-COMMERCE: ORGANIZING THEMES
Understanding e-commerce in its totality is a difficult task for students and instruc-
tors because there are so many facets to the phenomenon. No single academic dis-
cipline is prepared to encompass all of e-commerce. After teaching the e-commerce 
course for several years and writing this book, we have come to realize just how 
difficult it is to “understand” e-commerce. We have found it useful to think about 
e-commerce as involving three broad interrelated themes: technology, business, and 
society. We do not mean to imply any ordering of importance here because this book 
and our thinking freely range over these themes as appropriate to the problem we 
are trying to understand and describe. Nevertheless, as in previous technologically 
driven commercial revolutions, there is a historic progression. Technologies develop 
first, and then those developments are exploited commercially. Once commercial 
exploitation of the technology becomes widespread, a host of social, cultural, and 
political issues arise, and society is forced to respond to them.
TECHNOLOGY: INFRASTRUCTURE
The development and mastery of digital computing and communications technology 
is at the heart of the newly emerging global digital economy we call e-commerce. 
To understand the likely future of e-commerce, you need a basic understanding of 
the information technologies upon which it is built. E-commerce is above all else a 
technologically driven phenomenon that relies on a host of information technologies 

78	
	
C H A P T E R  1     I n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  E - c o m m e r c e
as well as fundamental concepts from computer science developed over a 50-year 
period. At the core of e-commerce are the Internet and the Web, which we describe 
in detail in Chapter 2. Underlying these technologies are a host of complementary 
technologies: cloud computing, desktop computers, smartphones, tablet computers, 
local area networks, relational and non-relational databases, client/server comput-
ing, data mining, and fiber-optic switches, to name just a few. These technologies lie 
at the heart of sophisticated business computing applications such as enterprise-wide 
information systems, supply chain management systems, manufacturing resource 
planning systems, and customer relationship management systems. E-commerce 
relies on all these basic technologies—not just the Internet. The Internet, while 
representing a sharp break from prior corporate computing and communications 
technologies, is nevertheless just the latest development in the evolution of corpo-
rate computing and part of the continuing chain of computer-based innovations in 
business. Figure 1.9 illustrates the major stages in the development of corporate 
computing and indicates how the Internet and the Web fit into this development 
trajectory.
To truly understand e-commerce, you will need to know something about packet-
switched communications, protocols such as TCP/IP, client/server and cloud comput-
ing, mobile digital platforms, Web servers, HTML5, CSS, and software programming 
tools such as Flash and JavaScript on the client side, and Java, PHP, Ruby on Rails, 
and ColdFusion on the server side. All of these topics are described fully in Chapters 
2 and 3.
BUSINESS: BASIC CONCEPTS
While technology provides the infrastructure, it is the business applications—the 
potential for extraordinary returns on investment—that create the interest and excite-
ment in e-commerce. New technologies present businesses and entrepreneurs with 
new ways of organizing production and transacting business. New technologies change 
the strategies and plans of existing firms: old strategies are made obsolete and new 
ones need to be invented. New technologies are the birthing grounds where thousands 
of new companies spring up with new products and services. New technologies are 
the graveyard of many traditional businesses. To truly understand e-commerce, you 
will need to be familiar with some key business concepts, such as the nature of digital 
markets, digital goods, business models, firm and industry value chains, value webs, 
industry structure, digital disruption, and consumer behavior in digital markets, as 
well as basic concepts of financial analysis. We’ll examine these concepts further in

With 3.1 billion people now using the Internet worldwide, the impact of the Internet and 
e-commerce on society is significant and global. Increasingly, e-commerce is subject to 
the laws of nations and global entities. You will need to understand the pressures that 
global e-commerce places on contemporary society in order to conduct a successful

e-commerce business or understand the e-commerce phenomenon. The primary 
societal issues we discuss in this book are individual privacy, intellectual property, 
and public welfare policy.
Because the Internet and the Web are exceptionally adept at tracking the iden-
tity and behavior of individuals online, e-commerce raises difficulties for preserv-
ing privacy—the ability of individuals to place limits on the type and amount of

THE INTERNET AND THE EVOLUTION OF CORPORATE 
COMPUTING
The Internet and Web, and the emergence of a mobile platform held together by the Internet cloud, are the 
latest in a chain of evolving technologies and related business applications, each of which builds on its 
predecessors.

information collected about them, and to control the uses of their personal informa-
tion. Read the Insight on Society case, Facebook and the Age of Privacy, to get a view of 
some of the ways e-commerce sites use personal information.
Because the cost of distributing digital copies of copyrighted intellectual prop-
erty—tangible works of the mind such as music, books, and videos—is nearly zero on 
the Internet, e-commerce poses special challenges to the various methods societies 
have used in the past to protect intellectual property rights.
The global nature of e-commerce also poses public policy issues of equity, equal 
access, content regulation, and taxation. For instance, in the United States, public 
telephone utilities are required under public utility and public accommodation laws 
to make basic service available at affordable rates so everyone can have telephone 
service. Should these laws be extended to the Internet and the Web? If goods are 
purchased by a New York State resident from a Web site in California, shipped from 
a center in Illinois, and delivered to New York, what state has the right to collect a 
sales tax? Should some heavy Internet users who consume extraordinary amounts 
of bandwidth by streaming endless movies be charged extra for service, or should 
the Internet be neutral with respect to usage? What rights do nation-states and their 
citizens have with respect to the Internet, the Web, and e-commerce? We address issues 
such as these in Chapter 8, and also throughout the text.
ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES CONCERNED WITH E-COMMERCE
The phenomenon of e-commerce is so broad that a multidisciplinary perspective is 
required. There are two primary approaches to e-commerce: technical and behavioral.
Technical Approaches
Computer scientists are interested in e-commerce as an exemplary application of 
Internet technology. They are concerned with the development of computer hard-
ware, software, and telecommunications systems, as well as standards, encryption, 
and database design and operation. Operations management scientists are primarily 
interested in building mathematical models of business processes and optimizing 
these processes. They are interested in e-commerce as an opportunity to study how 
business firms can exploit the Internet to achieve more efficient business operations. 
The information systems discipline spans the technical and behavioral approaches. 
Technical groups within the information systems specialty focus on data mining, 
search engine design, and artificial intelligence.
Behavioral Approaches
From a behavioral perspective, information systems researchers are primarily inter-
ested in e-commerce because of its implications for firm and industry value chains, 
industry structure, and corporate strategy. Economists have focused on online con-
sumer behavior, pricing of digital goods, and on the unique features of digital electronic 
markets. The marketing profession is interested in marketing, brand development and 
extension, online consumer behavior, and the ability of e-commerce technologies to

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY 
FACEBOOK AND THE AGE OF PRIVACY
In a January 2010 interview, 
Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of 
Facebook, proclaimed that the age 
of privacy had to come to an end. 
According to Zuckerberg, people were 
no longer worried about sharing their per-
sonal information with friends, friends of friends, 
or even the entire Web. Supporters of Zucker-
berg’s viewpoint believe the twenty-first century 
is a new era of openness and transparency. If 
true, this is good news for Facebook because its 
business model is based on selling access to a 
database of personal information. 
However, not everyone is a true believer. 
Privacy—limitations on what personal infor-
mation government and private institutions 
can collect and use—is a founding principle 
of democracies. A decade’s worth of privacy 
surveys in the United States show that well over 
80% of the American public fear the Internet is 
a threat to their privacy.
With about 1.5 billion monthly users world-
wide, and around 165 million in North America, 
Facebook’s privacy policies are going to shape 
privacy standards on the Internet for years to 
come. The economic stakes in the privacy debate 
are quite high, involving billions in advertising 
and transaction dollars. Facebook’s business 
model is based on building a database of billions 
of users who are encouraged, or even perhaps 
deceived, into relinquishing control over personal 
information, which is then sold to advertisers and 
other third parties. The less privacy Facebook’s 
users want or have, the more Facebook profits. 
Eliminating personal information privacy is built 
into Facebook’s DNA.
Facebook’s current privacy policies are 
quite a flip-flop from its original policy in 2004, 
which promised users near complete control over 
who could see their personal profile. However, 
every year since 2004, Facebook has attempted 
to extend its control over user information and 
content, often without notice. For instance, in 
2007, Facebook introduced the Beacon program, 
which was designed to broadcast users’ activities 
on participating Web sites to their friends. After 
a public outcry, Facebook terminated the Beacon 
program, and paid $9.5 million to settle a host 
of class action lawsuits. In 2009, undeterred by 
the Beacon fiasco, Facebook unilaterally decided 
that it would publish users’ basic personal infor-
mation on the public Internet, and announced 
that whatever content users had contributed 
belonged to Facebook, and that its ownership 
of that information never terminated. However, 
as with the Beacon program, Facebook’s efforts 
to take permanent control of user information 
resulted in users joining online resistance groups 
and it was ultimately forced to withdraw this 
policy as well.
In 2011, Facebook began publicizing users’ 
“likes” of various advertisers in Sponsored 
Stories (i.e., advertisements) that included 
the users’ names and profile pictures without 
their explicit consent, without paying them, 
and without giving them a way to opt out. This 
resulted in yet another class action lawsuit, which 
Facebook settled for $20 million in June 2012. 
(Facebook dropped Sponsored Stories in April 
2014.) In 2011, Facebook enrolled all Facebook 
subscribers into its facial recognition program 
without notice. This too raised the privacy alarm, 
forcing Facebook to make it easier for users to 
opt out. 
In May 2012, Facebook went public, cre-
ating even more pressure to increase revenues 
and profits to justify its stock market value. 
Shortly thereafter, Facebook announced that 
it was launching a mobile advertising product 
that pushes ads to the mobile news feeds of 

82	
	
C H A P T E R  1     I n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  E - c o m m e r c e
users based on the apps they use through 
the Facebook Connect feature, without 
explicit permission from the user to do so. It 
also announced Facebook Exchange, a program 
that allows advertisers to serve ads to Facebook 
users based on their browsing activity while 
not on Facebook. Privacy advocates raised the 
alarm yet again and more lawsuits were filed by 
users. In 2013, Facebook agreed to partner with 
several data marketing companies that deliver 
targeted ads based on offline data. The firms 
provide customer data to Facebook, which then 
allows Facebook advertisers to target their ads 
to those users based on that data. 
In December 2013, another class action 
lawsuit was filed against Facebook by users 
alleging that it violated their privacy by scanning 
users’ private Facebook messages and mining 
them for data such as references to URLs that 
Facebook could then sell to advertisers. In May 
2014, an enhancement to Facebook’s mobile app 
that allows the app to recognize the music, tele-
vision show, or movie playing in the background 
when a user makes a status update raised a new 
privacy alarm. In 2015, Facebook implemented 
a “new” privacy policy that allows it to share 
user personal data across partner sites and 
apps, including WhatsApp and Instagram. Also 
in 2015, Facebook admitted that its Facebook 
Messenger app collected and shared user geo-
location as the default setting. After negative 
publicity, it changed the default to “do not 
share.” 
After all these lawsuits and online public 
protests, one might think that Facebook’s 
privacy policy would improve. But an academic 
analysis of Facebook’s privacy policies from 
2008 to 2015 found that on most measures 
of privacy protection, Facebook’s policies have 
worsened. Since 2008, Facebook has made it 
more difficult for users to find out what infor-
mation is being shared with whom, how it builds 
profiles, or how to change privacy settings. Its 
privacy policies have become less readable, even 
inscrutable, according to the researchers.
Facebook is certainly aware of consumer 
suspicion of its privacy policies, and it changes 
its policies almost yearly in response to criticism. 
But the response is often not helpful for users, 
and typically extends the company’s claims to do 
whatever it wants with personal information. Its 
latest privacy policy, implemented in 2015, claims 
to switch its default privacy settings for new users 
from Public to Friends, provide a Privacy Checkup 
tool for users, and give users the ability to see 
the data it keeps on their likes and interests, and 
enable users to change, delete, or add to that 
data. Facebook argues this new policy gives users 
more control of the ads they are shown. Analysts 
point out, however, that using these new features 
requires users to navigate a maze of check boxes 
and menus that are difficult to understand even 
for expert Facebook users. Facebook’s growth 
in North America has steadily declined in part 
because users have come to realize that everything 
they post or say on Facebook will be given over 
to advertisers. There is no privacy on Facebook. 
People who are concerned about their privacy, 
analysts have concluded, should delete their Face-
book accounts.

segment and target consumer groups, and differentiate products. Economists share 
an interest with marketing scholars who have focused on e-commerce consumer 
response to marketing and advertising campaigns, and the ability of firms to brand, 
segment markets, target audiences, and position products to achieve above-normal 
returns on investment.
Management scholars have focused on entrepreneurial behavior and the chal-
lenges faced by young firms who are required to develop organizational structures in 
short time spans. Finance and accounting scholars have focused on e-commerce firm 
valuation and accounting practices. Sociologists—and to a lesser extent, psycholo-
gists—have focused on general population studies of Internet usage, the role of social 
inequality in skewing Internet benefits, and the use of the Web as a social network and 
group communications tool. Legal scholars are interested in issues such as preserving 
intellectual property, privacy, and content regulation.
No one perspective dominates research about e-commerce. The challenge is to 
learn enough about a variety of academic disciplines so that you can grasp the signifi-
cance of e-commerce in its entirety.

hen Puma, one of the world’s top sports footwear, apparel, and ac-
cessories brands, conceived its Love=Football campaign in 2010, the 
goal was to create a memorable tagline in a language that would be 
understood the world over—pictures. In the process, the company stumbled upon the 
power of social marketing. Puma’s ad agency, Droga5, filmed a light-hearted commercial 
featuring scruffy everyday men in a Tottenham pub singing love songs to their Valentines. 
The video went viral, garnering more than 130 million impressions and spawning hundreds 
of homemade response videos. In 2015, Puma launched an ad campaign called Forever 
Faster, featuring videos of celebrities and professional athletes training to meet their goals, 
including sprinter Usain Bolt and pop star Rihanna, whom the company also named its 
women’s creative director. The campaign has been another major success, driving sales 
of Puma’s Ignite XT shoe and further rejuvenating its brand.

with an eye towards driving the conversation and deepening its engagement with consum-
ers. It uses social media in part to better understand the different regional and sub-brand 
audiences within more than 120 countries in which it operates. Not all content is suitable 
for every one of its 14+ million global Facebook fans. Dedicated sport, country, region, 
and product category pages were created for each social network. For several years, Puma 
took a trial-and-error approach, focusing on building its follower base. Today, Puma uses 
a data-driven approach, geo-targeting posts at the appropriate times of day to maximize 
fan engagement and generate the right mix of online content to best drive sales. A tab 
for its iPhone app sends followers directly to Apple’s App Store, substantially boosting 
sales. This integration of channels into a cohesive customer acquisition strategy is in fact 
a key element of the emerging world of omni-channel retailing.
The advent of the term omni-channel signals the evolution of multi-channel or cross-
channel retailing to encompass all digital and social technologies. The idea is that custom-
ers can examine, access, purchase, and return goods from any channel, and even change 
channels during the process, and receive timely and relevant product information at each 
step along the way and in each channel. The rise of social networks and the personalized 
retail it engenders is a primary driver of omni-channel—the complete integration of the 
shopping and brand experience. Marketing efforts must be unified undertakings combining 
offline events and sales and online promotions and brand building that not only employ 
all available channels but provide multiple opportunities for customer involvement. For a 
company like Puma, with e-commerce sites in the United States, Russia, Canada, China, 
India, Switzerland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and a European site that serves 
multiple countries in multiple languages, this presents quite a challenge.
Puma’s Global Head of E-Commerce, Tom Davis, has overseen a major restructuring 
of its e-commerce business. Puma was not fully prepared to compete with Adidas, Nike, 
and other sports apparel companies in a global market that was rapidly shifting away 
from mature Western markets and desktop commerce. To coordinate market rollouts 
and ensure a unified brand image, Puma’s regional e-commerce teams needed oversight. 
A command center took over brand strategy and investment decisions, leaving daily 
operational and locality-based decision-making to the regional teams. Unified content 
and product strategies were developed in addition to a centralized product database. One 
central Web site replaced multiple e-commerce sites on different platforms. Demandware, 
Puma’s main e-commerce platform, was used to simplify managing global e-commerce 
operations from a central digital platform, though several other e-commerce platforms 
are still used. The goal was to achieve a consistent and cohesive brand building strategy so 
that the teams would all be on the same page and decisions could be more quickly reached. 
Yet local customization of the message and ensuring that globally produced goods meet 
local requirements would still be most efficiently handled. 
Puma assigned the overhaul of its Web site to Viget, a Web design firm. It created 
templates to unite several Puma sites into one and unify the look across numerous 
categories and content types. A dozen category sites now complement Puma.com, with a 
custom-built content management system (CMS) ensuring that consistent Puma branding

and navigation are maintained across all sub-sites and pages. Category managers can 
customize home pages outside of the template layout. The flexibility to roll out local, 
regional, or global campaigns is thus built into the Web site design. What’s more, the CMS 
integrates with a language translation tool, a Storefinder tool that helps visitors locate 
Puma stores, and Puma’s product inventory manager. The design changes have improved 
site visualization and navigation, prompting customers to spend twice as much time on 
the site and raising the order rate by 7.1%.
The Viget team then turned to the mobile site, first incorporating Storefinder into 
the interface. Using the GPS capability of the mobile device, Puma stores nearest to the 
user can be located, along with address and contact information. Users experience the 
same content and appearance as Puma.com and each of the category sites, managed by 
the same CMS. Puma’s mobile site has also been rebuilt using responsive design features. 
Puma also incorporated mobile into its omni-channel marketing strategy. The Puma Joy 
Pad—32 synchronized iPads mounted on a wall—allows shoppers at its flagship Paris 
store and other select locations to play games and experiment with Web apps. In the near 
future, shoppers will be able to generate content that they can share with their social 
networks, and walls will be connected so that customers in stores around the globe will 
be able to share their shopping experiences. On Black Friday 2014, 3.4% of mobile visi-
tors to Puma’s site made a purchase, compared to just 1.6% the previous year. In 2013, 
Puma released PUMATRAC, an iPhone app that automatically analyzes environmental 
conditions to give runners feedback on how these variables impact their performance. The 
app offers multiple options to share statistics and routes with other runners.
In 2014, Puma focused on unifying its branding efforts and e-commerce Web sites 
within one centralized site. The company has also solidified its worldwide e-commerce 
teams. In the past, Puma maintained nine independent e-commerce teams on five conti-
nents. Currently, it is working towards teams divided into the three major segments that 
comprise the majority of its sales—North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific—as well 
as a global unit that operates at a level above these regional segments. The goal is to 
centralize Puma’s e-commerce business both at one e-commerce site as well as internally 
within the company. At the same time, the company hopes to pursue a strategy that is 
flexible and focused more on the precise local needs in individual markets. These changes 
have already reaped rewards, improving conversion rates from 10% to 20% and boosting 
average order value by 12%. Centralizing its e-commerce operations under a single site 
also helps Puma better collect customer data to personalize marketing and develop more 
appealing products.
Although over the past three years Puma has gained invaluable omni-channel experi-
ence, racked up social marketing accomplishments, and laid the groundwork for resurgent 
e-commerce success, implementing a successful omni-channel strategy is a monumental 
task. In 2013 and 2014, Puma’s profits sagged, and the company claimed its increased 
marketing budget was the reason while insisting that their strategy would pay dividends 
in the future. Puma knows it cannot compete on price with mass merchandisers such as 
Amazon and Zappos, and it cannot control Puma product presentation in those venues.

External loss of brand control necessitates superior product content, product information 
management, and shopping experience internally, precisely the skills it has been nurturing. 
Puma’s ability to adapt its strategy to individual areas is also likely to help the company 
advance into China, a growing market where Puma has traditionally had minimal pres-
ence. This flexibility allowed Puma to adapt to Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Tmall 
platform, where it holds a strong brand score. In 2015, Puma finally began to see results 
from its innovative advertising, product development, and centralization efforts as its 
earnings rebounded to beat analysts’ estimates, growing by 18% over its second quarter 
from 2014. Puma CEO Bjorn Gulden believes that 2014 and 2015 represent a turning 
point for the Puma brand back to profitability.  
Case Study Questions
1.	 What is the purpose of Puma’s content management system?
2.	 Why did Puma build a single centralized Web site rather than continue with mul-
tiple Web sites serving different countries and regions? 
3.	 What social media sites does Puma use, and what do they contribute to Puma’s 
marketing effort?

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Define e-commerce and describe how it differs from e-business.
•	
E-commerce involves digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations and 
individuals. Digitally enabled transactions include all those mediated by digital technology, meaning, for 
the most part, transactions that occur over the Internet, the Web, and/or via mobile devices. Commercial 
transactions involve the exchange of value (e.g., money) across organizational or individual boundaries in 
return for products or services.
•	
E-business refers primarily to the digital enabling of transactions and processes within a firm, involving 
information systems under the control of the firm. For the most part, e-business does not involve com-
mercial transactions across organizational boundaries where value is exchanged.
Identify and describe the unique features of e-commerce technology and discuss their business significance.
There are eight features of e-commerce technology that are unique to this medium:
•	
Ubiquity—available just about everywhere, at all times, making it possible to shop from your desktop, at 
home, at work, or even from your car.
•	
Global reach—permits commercial transactions to cross cultural and national boundaries far more conve-
niently and cost-effectively than is true in traditional commerce.

•	
Universal standards—shared by all nations around the world, in contrast to most traditional commerce 
technologies, which differ from one nation to the next.
•	
Richness—enables an online merchant to deliver marketing messages in a way not possible with tradi-
tional commerce tech­nologies.
•	
Interactivity—allows for two-way communication between merchant and consumer and enables the mer-
chant to engage a consumer in ways similar to a face-to-face experience, but on a much more massive, 
global scale.
•	
Information density—is the total amount and quality of information available to all market participants. 
The Internet reduces information collection, storage, processing, and communication costs while increas-
ing the currency, accuracy, and timeliness of information.
•	
Personalization and customization—the increase in information density allows merchants to target their 
marketing messages to specific individuals and results in a level of personalization and customization 
unthinkable with previously existing commerce technologies.
•	
Social technology—provides a many-to-many model of mass communications. Millions of users are able to 
generate content consumed by millions of other users. The result is the formation of social networks on a 
wide scale and the aggregation of large audiences on social network platforms.
Describe the major types of e-commerce.
There are six major types of e-commerce:
•	
B2C e-commerce involves businesses selling to consumers and is the type of e-commerce that most con-
sumers are likely to encounter. 
•	
B2B e-commerce involves businesses selling to other businesses and is the largest form of e-commerce.
•	
C2C e-commerce is a means for consumers to sell to each other. In C2C e-commerce, the consumer pre-
pares the product for market, places the product for auction or sale, and relies on the market maker to 
provide catalog, search engine, and transaction clearing capabilities so that products can be easily dis-
played, discovered, and paid for.
•	
Social e-commerce is e-commerce that is enabled by social networks and online social relationships.
•	
M-commerce involves the use of wireless digital devices to enable online transactions.
•	
Local e-commerce is a form of e-commerce that is focused on engaging the consumer based on his or her 
current geographic location.
Understand the evolution of e-commerce from its early years to today.
E-commerce has gone through three stages: innovation, consolidation, and reinvention.

The early years of e-commerce were a technological success, with the digital infrastructure created dur-
ing the period solid enough to sustain significant growth in e-commerce during the next decade, and a 
mixed business success, with significant revenue growth and customer usage, but low profit margins.
•	
E-commerce entered a period of consolidation beginning in 2001 and extending into 2006.
•	
E-commerce entered a period of reinvention in 2007 with the emergence of the mobile digital platform, 
social networks, and Web 2.0 applications that attracted huge audiences in a very short time span.
Describe the major themes underlying the study of e-commerce.
E-commerce involves three broad interrelated themes:
•	
Technology—To understand e-commerce, you need a basic understanding of the information technologies 
upon which it is built, including the Internet, the Web, and mobile platform, and a host of complemen-
tary technologies—cloud computing, desktop computers, smartphones, tablet computers, local area net-
works, client/server computing, packet-switched communications, protocols such as TCP/IP, Web servers, 
HTML, and relational and non-relational databases, among others.

•	
Business—While technology provides the infrastructure, it is the business applications—the potential for 
extraordinary returns on investment—that create the interest and excitement in e-commerce. Therefore, 
you also need to understand some key business concepts such as electronic markets, information goods, 
business models, firm and industry value chains, industry structure, and consumer behavior in digital 
markets.
•	
Society—Understanding the pressures that global e-commerce places on contemporary society is critical to 
being successful in the e-commerce marketplace. The primary societal issues are intellectual property, 
individual privacy, and public policy.
Identify the major academic disciplines contributing to e-commerce.
There are two primary approaches to e-commerce: technical and behavioral. Each of these approaches is 
represented by several academic disciplines. On the technical side, this includes computer science, opera-
tions management, and information systems. On the behavioral side, it includes information systems as well 
as sociology, economics, finance and accounting, management, and marketing.

alk down the street in any 
city and count the number 
of people pecking away at 
their smartphones. Ride the train, and observe 
how many fellow travelers are using a tablet. 
Today, one of the primary means of accessing 
the Internet is via a mobile device. Traditional 
desktop computers still play a role, but in 2015, 
2.25 billion people worldwide use a mobile device 
to access the Internet, and over 45% of total 
Internet traffic comes from mobile devices. That 
percentage is only going to grow. The mobile plat-
form provides the foundation for a number of 
unique new services, including augmented reality, 
which involves content (text, video, and sound) 
that is superimposed over live images in order to 
enrich the user’s experience.
Augmented reality combines the geolocating functionality built into smartphones to 
bring together location, and context, helping the user understand his or her environment 
better. Wikitude is one of the most prominent examples of the many augmented reality 
platforms in development. It is a “points of interest” location-based service that uses the 
same kind of wiki tools that power Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. The Wikitude 8 
app is available for all major mobile operating systems, and the company released the 
latest edition of its developer kit, SDK 5.0 in August 2015. When users examine objects 
and locations using the Wikitude app on their smartphones, the app uses smartphone 
features like GPS and the accelerometer to display information on over 100 million points 
of interest gathered from Wikipedia, Yelp, and other third-party services. Wikitude most 
often functions as a very sophisticated travel guide as well as an advertising platform, 
allowing merchants to advertise their local offerings and discount coupons based on where 
the user is located. 
Organizations throughout Europe and the rest of world are using Wikitude to create 
custom apps for a variety of purposes. Fashion retailer Zalando and concept car manu-
facturer Rinspeed collaborated with Wikitude to produce an augmented reality display 
inside Rinspeed’s latest vehicle. Wikitude and eoVision, which offers services and products 
related to Earth’s observation and geoinformation, collaborated on a book entitled “one

earth,” which has 119 pages of satellite images that analyze the environment and display 
maps, descriptions, 3D modeling, and advanced augmented reality technology to deliver 
an entirely new media experience. Wikitude technology also features prominently in the 
companion app to “Who We Are: One Direction,” an autobiography of the popular band 
One Direction, released in 2014. App users can place their mobile device over photographs 
and other areas of the book, allowing them to view exclusive videos, interviews, and other 
interactive material. The app was downloaded more than 60,000 times in the two weeks 
after its launch. Wikitude’s app platform was used in a 2015 exhibit of dinosaurs at 
the St. Louis Science Center, allowing kids to interact with virtual dinosaurs in a jungle 
environment.
Layar, a Wikitude competitor that also offers an augmented reality browser, also 
offers services that allow users to hold up a smartphone to a real-life object and receive 
an overlay of data about it, including advertising offers. In 2014, Layar was acquired by 
fellow augmented reality start-up Blippar, an image recognition platform used in digital 
advertising. Blippar creates “blipps” in which users snap pictures of products to view 
content-rich, interactive experiences via mobile devices. The move gives Layar the ability 
to compete with a wider array of AR and VR companies. Although Blippar announced 
losses of approximately $7.5 million over its last financial year in 2015, the company’s 
revenue grew 45% over that span, and after a $45 million round of funding, Blippar 
reached a valuation of $1.5 billion. Advertisers are lining up to work with Blippar, including 
hundreds of the top newsstand magazines in the world, which agreed in 2015 to make 
their magazines compatible with Blippar advertising and interactive features.
More and more commercial applications of augmented reality technology are being 
introduced every day. Yellow Pages has tested the use of augmented reality to overlay 
advertisements, paid for by businesses, to street views where its app is used. Another 
variation is a real estate app tested by RightMove that allows users to point their phone 
up and down a street and find out what is for sale or for rent, and how much it costs. 
It also provides contact information for each of the properties. Yelp, TripAdvisor, and 
Lonely Planet are just a few of the travel companies that have introduced some aspects 
of augmented reality to their apps. 
Yet another current use of augmented reality is to allow users to simulate “trying on” 
the product. For instance, eBay’s Fashion iPhone app lets users virtually try on sunglasses 
using the phone’s front-facing camera to take a picture of themselves and then virtually 
“fit” the sunglasses to their face. Watchmaker Neuvo offers a similar app that lets users 
virtually try on watches, while a Converse app lets you do the same with Converse shoes. 
Software from Zugara allows you try on clothing from online shops. 
Gaming is another area where augmented reality is expected to make a big splash. 
Oculus VR is gaining traction despite the fact that its Oculus Rift headset is not slated to 
ship to consumers until 2016. Although the headset was originally conceived as a gaming 
platform, Oculus Rift has potential applications for virtual reality training programs, 
performing advanced medical procedures, and any number of other more practical uses. 
And the VR gaming landscape is getting more crowded. Two former employees from 
gaming company Valve received over $400,000 in Kickstarter funding in under two days

and over $1 million in total for its castAR augmented reality gaming project, which uses 
glasses, an RFID tracking grid, and a controller to enable augmented reality gaming. The 
company moved to Silicon Valley in 2014 to hire more talented hardware engineers and 
meet increased production demands. In 2015, the castAR developers released a video 
of the headset in action, showing users playing 3D and virtual reality games, viewing 
building plans in 3D, and browsing the Web in an immersive environment. Many other 
gaming companies are considering the possibilities for augmented reality in future projects, 
including the HTC Vive and Sony’s Playstation VR.
One of the most promising platforms for augmented reality was Google Glass, a pair 
of glasses capable of a variety of augmented and virtual reality applications, but the device 
failed to gain traction and was discontinued in 2015. However, Google plans to release an 
updated version of the technology in late 2015, with an emphasis on use in the workplace. 
Rumor also has it that Apple may be planning its own augmented reality foray, 
which may be the final push needed to put augmented reality squarely into the main-
stream.  Apple has applied for and won patents involving augmented reality technologies 
from 2013 to 2015. Apple appears to be developing a system that can provide virtual 
overlays of their surroundings akin to Layar, but which also will include “x-ray vision” 
that allows users to look behind walls of select structures. A combination of a live 
feed from the iPhone’s camera and local sensor information would pinpoint a user’s 
position and generate an interactive wireframe model of their immediate surroundings. 
Users will be able to manipulate the frame so that it matches their view. Applications 
for the service could be as an advanced version of Apple’s Maps service, complete with 
capability for local businesses to advertise and generate special offers based on Apple’s 
granular user data.

his chapter examines the Internet, Web, and mobile platform of today 
and tomorrow, how it evolved, how it works, and how its present and 
future infrastructure enables new business opportunities.
The opening case illustrates the importance of understanding how the Internet 
and related technologies work, and to be aware of what’s new. The Internet and its 
underlying technology are not static phenomena, but instead continue to change over 
time. Computers have merged with cell phone services; broadband access in the home 
and broadband wireless access to the Internet via smartphones, tablet computers, and 
laptops are expanding rapidly; self-publishing on the Web via social networks and 
blogging now engages millions of Internet users; and software technologies such as 
cloud computing, and smartphone apps are revolutionizing the way businesses are 
using the Internet. Looking forward a few years, the business strategies of the future 
will require a firm understanding of these technologies and new ones, such as different 
types of wearable technology, the Internet of Things, and the “smart/connected” move-
ment (smart homes, smart TVs, and connected cars) to deliver products and services 
to consumers. Table 2.1 summarizes some of the most important developments in 
e-commerce infrastructure for 2015–2016.
	 2.1	
THE INTERNET: TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND
What is the Internet? Where did it come from, and how did it support the growth of 
the Web? What are the Internet’s most important operating principles? How much do 
you really need to know about the technology of the Internet?
Let’s take the last question first. The answer is: It depends on your career inter-
ests. If you are on a marketing career path, or general managerial business path, 
then you need to know the basics about Internet technology, which you’ll learn in 
this and the following chapter. If you are on a technical career path and hope to 
become a Web designer, or pursue a technical career in Web infrastructure for busi-
nesses, you’ll need to start with these basics and then build from there. You’ll also 
need to know about the business side of e-commerce, which you will learn about 
throughout this book.
As noted in Chapter 1, the Internet is an interconnected network of thousands 
of networks and millions of computers (sometimes called host computers or just hosts) 
linking businesses, educational institutions, government agencies, and individuals. 
The Internet provides approximately 3.1 billion people around the world with services 
such as e-mail, apps, newsgroups, shopping, research, instant messaging, music, 
videos, and news (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a, 2015b). No single organization controls the 
Internet or how it functions, nor is it owned by anybody, yet it has provided the 
infrastructure for a transformation in commerce, scientific research, and culture. The 
word Internet is derived from the word internetwork, or the connecting together of two 
or more computer networks. The Web is one of the Internet’s most popular services, 
providing access to billions, perhaps trillions, of Web pages, which are documents

TABLE 2.1	
TRENDS IN E-COMMERCE INFRASTRUCTURE 2015–2016
B U S I N E S S
•	 Mobile devices become the primary access point to social network services and a rapidly expanding 
social marketing and advertising platform, and create a foundation for location-based Web services and 
business models.
•	 Explosion of Internet content services and mobile access devices strains the business models of Internet 
backbone providers (the large telecommunication carriers).
•	 The growth in cloud computing and bandwidth capacity enables new business models for distributing 
music, movies, and television.
•	 Search becomes more social and local, enabling social and local commerce business models.
•	 Internet backbone carriers initiate differential pricing models so that users pay for bandwidth usage.
•	 “Big Data” produced by the Internet creates new business opportunities for firms with the analytic 
capability to understand it.
T E C H N O L O G Y
•	 Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have become the dominant mode of access 
to the Internet. The new client is mobile.
•	 The explosion of mobile apps threatens the dominance of the Web as the main source of online 
software applications and leads some to claim the Web is dead.
•	 HTML5 grows in popularity among publishers and developers and makes possible Web applications 
that are just as visually rich and lively as native mobile apps.
•	 Cloud computing reshapes computing and storage, and becomes an important force in the delivery of 
software applications and online content.
•	 The Internet runs out of IPv4 addresses; the transition to IPv6 continues.
•	 The decreased cost of storage and advances in database software lead to explosion in online data 
collection known as Big Data and creates new business opportunities for firms with the analytic 
capability to understand it.
•	 The Internet of Things, with millions of sensor-equipped devices connecting to the Internet, starts to 
become a reality, and is powering the development of smart connected “things” such as televisions, 
houses, cars, and wearable technology.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET: 1961—THE PRESENT
Today’s Internet has evolved over the last 55 or so years. In this sense, the Internet is 
not “new;” it did not happen yesterday. Although journalists talk glibly about “­Internet” 
time—suggesting a fast-paced, nearly instant, worldwide global change mechanism—in 
fact, it has taken about 55 years of hard work to arrive at today’s Internet.

The history of the Internet can be segmented into three phases (see Figure 2.1). 
In the first phase, the Innovation Phase, from 1961 to 1974, the fundamental building 
blocks of the Internet were conceptualized and then realized in actual hardware and 
software. The basic building blocks are packet-switching hardware, a communications 
protocol called TCP/IP, and client/server computing (all described more fully later 
in this section). The original purpose of the Internet, when it was conceived in the 
1960s, was to link large mainframe computers on different college campuses. This 
kind of one-to-one communication between campuses was previously only possible 
through the telephone system or private networks owned by the large computer 
manufacturers.
In the second phase, the Institutionalization Phase, from 1975 to 1995, large insti-
tutions such as the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) provided funding and legitimization for the fledging invention 
called the Internet. Once the concepts behind the Internet had been proven in several 
government-supported demonstration projects, the DoD contributed $1 million to 
further develop them into a robust military communications system that could with-
stand nuclear war. This effort created what was then called ARPANET (Advanced 
Research Projects Agency Network). In 1986, the NSF assumed responsibility for the 
development of a civilian Internet (then called NSFNET) and began a 10-year-long 
$200 million expansion program.
In the third phase, the Commercialization Phase, from 1995 to the present, govern-
ment agencies encouraged private corporations to take over and expand both the 
Internet backbone and local service to ordinary citizens—families and individuals 
across the world who were not students on campuses. By 2000, the Internet’s use had 
expanded well beyond military installations and research universities. See Table 2.2 
on pages 100–102 for a closer look at the development of the Internet from 1961 on.
	
FIGURE 2.1	
STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET
The Internet has developed in three stages over approximately a 55-year period from 1961 to the present. 
In the Innovation stage, basic ideas and technologies were developed; in the Institutionalization stage, these 
ideas were brought to life; in the Commercialization stage, once the ideas and technologies had been 
proven, private companies brought the Internet to millions of people worldwide.

THE INTERNET: KEY TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS
In 1995, the Federal Networking Council (FNC) passed a resolution formally defin-
ing the term Internet as a network that uses the IP addressing scheme, supports the 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and makes services available to users much 
like a telephone system makes voice and data services available to the public (see 
Figure 2.2).
Behind this formal definition are three extremely important concepts that are the 
basis for understanding the Internet: packet switching, the TCP/IP communications 
protocol, and client/server computing. Although the Internet has evolved and changed 
dramatically in the last 30 years, these three concepts are at the core of the way the 
Internet functions today and are the foundation for the Internet of the future.
Packet Switching
Packet switching is a method of slicing digital messages into discrete units called 
packets, sending the packets along different communication paths as they become 
available, and then reassembling the packets once they arrive at their destination (see 
Figure 2.3 on page 103). Prior to the development of packet switching, early computer 
networks used leased, dedicated telephone circuits to communicate with terminals 
and other computers. In circuit-switched networks such as the telephone system, a 
complete point-to-point circuit is put together, and then communication can proceed. 
However, these “dedicated” circuit-switching techniques were expensive and wasted 
available communications capacity—the circuit would be maintained regardless of 
whether any data was being sent. For nearly 70% of the time, a dedicated voice circuit 
is not being fully used because of pauses between words and delays in assembling the

meters) network to share files, run applications, and send 
messages.
1974
“Open architecture” networking and TCP/IP 
concepts are presented in a paper by Vint Cerf

computers, and a common addressing scheme for all 
computers connected to the network, are born.
Prior to this, computers could communicate only if they shared 
a common proprietary network architecture. With TCP/IP, 
computers and networks could work together regardless of 
their local operating systems or network protocols.

circuit segments, both of which increase the length of time required to find and 
connect circuits. A better technology was needed.
The first book on packet switching was written by Leonard Kleinrock in 1964 
(Kleinrock, 1964), and the technique was further developed by others in the defense 
research labs of both the United States and England. With packet switching, the 
communications capacity of a network can be increased by a factor of 100 or more. 
(The communications capacity of a digital network is measured in terms of bits per 
second.2) Imagine if the gas mileage of your car went from 15 miles per gallon to 1,500 
miles per gallon—all without changing too much of the car!
In packet-switched networks, messages are first broken down into packets. 
Appended to each packet are digital codes that indicate a source address (the origina-
tion point) and a destination address, as well as sequencing information and error-
control information for the packet. Rather than being sent directly to the destination 
address, in a packet network, the packets travel from computer to computer until they 
reach their destination. These computers are called routers. A router is a special-
purpose computer that interconnects the different computer networks that make up 
the Internet and routes packets along to their ultimate destination as they travel. To 
ensure that packets take the best available path toward their destination, routers use 
a computer program called a routing algorithm.
2	A bit is a binary digit, 0 or 1. A string of eight bits constitutes a byte. A home telephone dial-up 
modem connects to the Internet usually at 56 Kbps (56,000 bits per second). Mbps refers to millions 
of bits per second, whereas Gbps refers to billions of bits per second.

FIGURE 2.3	
PACKET SWITCHING
In packet switching, digital messages are divided into fixed-length packets of bits (generally about 1,500 
bytes). Header information indicates both the origin and the ultimate destination address of the packet, the 
size of the message, and the number of packets the receiving node should expect. Because the receipt of 
each packet is acknowledged by the receiving computer, for a considerable amount of time, the network is 
not passing information, only acknowledgments, producing a delay called latency.

C H A P T E R  2     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e
Packet switching does not require a dedicated circuit, but can make use of any 
spare capacity that is available on any of several hundred circuits. Packet switching 
makes nearly full use of almost all available communication lines and capacity. More-
over, if some lines are disabled or too busy, the packets can be sent on any available 
line that eventually leads to the destination point.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
While packet switching was an enormous advance in communications capacity, there 
was no universally agreed-upon method for breaking up digital messages into packets, 
routing them to the proper address, and then reassembling them into a coherent 
message. This was like having a system for producing stamps but no postal system 
(a series of post offices and a set of addresses). The answer was to develop a protocol 
(a set of rules and standards for data transfer) to govern the formatting, ordering, com-
pressing, and error-checking of messages, as well as specify the speed of transmission 
and means by which devices on the network will indicate they have stopped sending 
and/or receiving messages.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) has become the 
core communications protocol for the Internet (Cerf and Kahn, 1974). TCP establishes 
the connections among sending and receiving Web computers, and makes sure that 
packets sent by one computer are received in the same sequence by the other, without 
any packets missing. IP provides the Internet’s addressing scheme and is responsible 
for the actual delivery of the packets.
TCP/IP is divided into four separate layers, with each layer handling a different 
aspect of the communication problem (see Figure 2.4). The Network Interface 
Layer is responsible for placing packets on and receiving them from the network 
medium, which could be a LAN (Ethernet) or Token Ring network, or other network 
technology. TCP/IP is independent from any local network technology and can adapt 
to changes at the local level. The Internet Layer is responsible for addressing, packag-
ing, and routing messages on the Internet. The Transport Layer is responsible for 
providing communication with the application by acknowledging and sequencing the 
packets to and from the application. The Application Layer provides a wide variety 
of applications with the ability to access the services of the lower layers. Some of the 
best-known applications are HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Pro-
tocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), all of which we will discuss 
later in this chapter.
IP Addresses
The IP addressing scheme answers the question “How can billions of computers 
attached to the Internet communicate with one another?” The answer is that every 
computer connected to the Internet must be assigned an address—otherwise it cannot 
send or receive TCP packets. For instance, when you sign onto the Internet using a 
dial-up, DSL, or cable modem, your computer is assigned a temporary address by your 
Internet Service Provider. Most corporate and university computers attached to a local 
area network have a permanent IP address.

There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 Internet 
address is a 32-bit number that appears as a series of four separate numbers marked 
off by periods, such as 64.49.254.91. Each of the four numbers can range from 0–255. 
This “dotted quad” addressing scheme supports up to about 4 billion addresses (2 to 
the 32nd power). In a typical Class C network, the first three sets of numbers identify 
the network (in the preceding example, 64.49.254 is the local area network identifica-
tion) and the last number (91) identifies a specific computer.
Because many large corporate and government domains have been given millions 
of IP addresses each (to accommodate their current and future work forces), and with 
all the new networks and new Internet-enabled devices requiring unique IP addresses 
being attached to the Internet, in 2015, the number of IPv4 addresses available to be 
assigned has shrunk significantly. In North America, only about 3.4 million remain 
available from the American Registry for Internet Numbers; registries in Asia and 
Europe have already essentially run out (McMillan, 2015). IPv6 was created to address

this problem. An IPv6 Internet address is 128 bits, so it can support up to 2128 
(3.4×1038) addresses, many more than IPv4. According to Akamai, in the United States, 
about 20% of Internet traffic now occurs over IPv6. Belgium leads the way globally, 
with almost 40% of Internet traffic converted to IPv6 (Akamai, 2015).
Figure 2.5 illustrates how TCP/IP and packet switching work together to send 
data over the Internet.
Domain Names, DNS, and URLs
Most people cannot remember 32-bit numbers. An IP address can be represented by 
a natural language convention called a domain name. The Domain Name System 
(DNS) allows expressions such as Cnet.com to stand for a numeric IP address (cnet.
com’s numeric IP is 216.239.113.101).3 A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which 
is the address used by a Web browser to identify the location of content on the Web, 
also uses a domain name as part of the URL. A typical URL contains the protocol to 
be used when accessing the address, followed by its location. For instance, the URL 
http://www.azimuth-interactive.com/flash_test refers to the IP address 208.148.84.1 
with the domain name “azimuth-interactive.com” and the protocol being used to access 
the address, HTTP. A resource called “flash_test” is located on the server directory 
path /flash_test. A URL can have from two to four parts; for example, 
name1.name2.name3.org. We discuss domain names and URLs further in Section 2.4. 
Figure 2.6 illustrates the Domain Name System and Table 2.3 summarizes the impor-
tant components of the Internet addressing scheme.

cmd to open the DOS prompt. Type ping <Domain Name>. You will receive the IP address in return.

ROUTING INTERNET MESSAGES: TCP/IP AND PACKET

The Internet uses packet-switched networks and the TCP/IP communications protocol to send, route, and 
assemble messages. Messages are broken into packets, and packets from the same message can travel along 
different routes.

Client/Server Computing
While packet switching exploded the available communications capacity and TCP/IP 
provided the communications rules and regulations, it took a revolution in computing 
to bring about today’s Internet and the Web. That revolution is called client/server 
computing and without it, the Web—in all its richness—would not exist. Client/server

THE HIERARCHICAL DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
The Domain Name System is a hierarchical namespace with a root server at the top. Top-level domains appear next and identify the 
organization type (such as .com, .gov, .org, etc.) or geographic location (such as .uk [Great Britain] or .ca [Canada]). Second-level servers 
for each top-level domain assign and register second-level domain names for organizations and individuals such as IBM.com, 
Microsoft.com, and Stanford.edu. Finally, third-level domains identify a particular computer or group of computers within an 
organization, e.g., www.finance.nyu.edu.

network with one or more servers, which are computers that are dedicated to perform-
ing common functions that the client computers on the network need, such as file 
storage, software applications, printing, and Internet access. The client computers are 
themselves sufficiently powerful to accomplish complex tasks. Servers are networked 
computers dedicated to common functions that the client computers on the network 
need, such as file storage, software applications, utility programs that provide Web 
connections, and printers (see Figure 2.7). The Internet is a giant example of client/
server computing in which millions of Web servers located around the world can be 
easily accessed by millions of client computers, also located throughout the world.
To appreciate what client/server computing makes possible, you must understand 
what preceded it. In the mainframe computing environment of the 1960s and 1970s, 
computing power was very expensive and limited. For instance, the largest commer-
cial mainframes of the late 1960s had 128k of RAM and 10-megabyte disk drives, and 
occupied hundreds of square feet. There was insufficient computing capacity to support 
graphics or color in text documents, let alone sound files, video, or hyperlinked docu-
ments. In this period, computing was entirely centralized: all work was done by a single 
mainframe computer, and users were connected to the mainframe using terminals.
With the development of personal computers and local area networks during 
the late 1970s and early 1980s, client/server computing became possible. Client/
server computing has many advantages over centralized mainframe computing. For 
instance, it is easy to expand capacity by adding servers and clients. Also, client/
server networks are less vulnerable than centralized computing architectures. If 
one server goes down, backup or mirror servers can pick up the slack; if a client 
computer is inoperable, the rest of the network continues operating. Moreover, 
processing load is balanced over many powerful smaller computers rather than being 
concentrated in a single huge computer that performs processing for everyone. Both 
software and hardware in client/server environments can be built more simply and 
economically.

more servers.

In 2015, there were about 1.8 billion personal computers in use around the world 
(Imbert, 2015). Personal computing capabilities have also moved to smartphones and 
tablet computers (all much “thinner” clients with a bit less computing horsepower, and 
limited memory, but which rely on Internet servers to accomplish their tasks). In the 
process, more computer processing will be performed by central servers.
THE NEW CLIENT: THE MOBILE PLATFORM
There’s a new client in town. The primary means of accessing the Internet worldwide 
is now through highly portable smartphones and tablet computers, and not traditional 
desktop or laptop PCs. This means that the primary platform for e-commerce products 
and services is also changing to a mobile platform.
The change in hardware has reached a tipping point. The form factor of PCs 
has changed from desktops to laptops and tablet computers such as the iPad (and 
more than 100 other competitors). Tablets are lighter, do not require a complex 
operating system, and rely on the Internet cloud to provide processing and storage. 
And, while there are an estimated 1.8 billion PCs in the world, the number of cell 
phones long ago exceeded the population of PCs. In 2015, there are an estimated 4.43 
billion worldwide mobile phone users, with 258 million in the United States, around 
1 billion in China, and 638 million in India. The population of mobile phone users 
is almost three times that of PC owners. Around 42%, or 1.84 billion, of the world’s 
mobile phone users are smartphone users. Around 2.25 billion people around the 
world access the Internet using mobile devices, mostly smartphones and tablets 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2015c, 2015d, 2015e). Briefly, the Internet world is turning into a 
lighter, mobile platform. The tablet is not replacing PCs so much as supplementing 
PCs for use in mobile situations.
Smartphones are a disruptive technology that radically alters the personal comput-
ing and e-commerce landscape. Smartphones have created a major shift in computer 
processors and software that has disrupted the dual monopolies long established by 
Intel and Microsoft, whose chips, operating systems, and software applications began 
dominating the PC market in 1982. Few smartphones use Intel chips, which power 
90% of the world’s PCs; only a small percentage of smartphones use Microsoft’s operat-
ing system (Windows Mobile). Instead, smartphone manufacturers either purchase 
operating systems such as Symbian, the world leader, or build their own, such as 
Apple’s iPhone iOS, typically based on Linux and Java platforms. Smartphones do not 
use power-hungry hard drives but instead use flash memory chips with storage up to 
64 gigabytes that also require much less power.
The mobile platform has profound implications for e-commerce because it influ-
ences how, where, and when consumers shop and buy.
THE INTERNET “CLOUD COMPUTING” MODEL: HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE 
AS A SERVICE
Cloud computing is a model of computing in which computer processing, storage, 
software, and other services are provided as a shared pool of virtualized resources over 
the Internet. These “clouds” of computing resources can be accessed on an as-needed 
cloud computing

basis from any connected device and location. Figure 2.8 illustrates the cloud comput-
ing concept.
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud 
computing as having the following essential characteristics:
•	 On-demand self-service: Consumers can obtain computing capabilities such as 
server time or network storage as needed automatically on their own.
•	 Ubiquitous network access: Cloud resources can be accessed using standard 
network and Internet devices, including mobile platforms.
•	 Location-independent resource pooling: Computing resources are pooled to 
serve multiple users, with different virtual resources dynamically assigned accord-
ing to user demand. The user generally does not know where the computing 
resources are located.
•	 Rapid elasticity: Computing resources can be rapidly provisioned, increased, or 
decreased to meet changing user demand.
•	 Measured service: Charges for cloud resources are based on the amount of 
resources actually used.
Cloud computing consists of three basic types of services:
•	 Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Customers use processing, storage, network-
ing, and other computing resources from third-party providers called cloud service 
providers (CSPs) to run their information systems. For example, Amazon used the 
spare capacity of its information technology infrastructure to develop Amazon 
Web Services, which offers a cloud environment for a myriad of different IT infra-
structure services. See Table 2.4 for a description of the range of services that AWS 
offers, such as its Simple Storage Service (S3) for storing customers’ data and its

•	 Software as a service (SaaS): Customers use software hosted by the vendor on 
the vendor’s cloud infrastructure and delivered as a service over a network. Leading 
SaaS examples are Google Apps, which provides common business applications 
online, and Salesforce.com, which provides customer relationship management and 
related software services over the Internet. Both charge users an annual subscrip-
tion fee, although Google Apps also has a pared-down free version. Users access 
these applications from a Web browser, and the data and software are maintained 
on the providers’ remote servers.
•	 Platform as a service (PaaS): Customers use infrastructure and programming 
tools supported by the CSP to develop their own applications. For example, IBM 
offers Bluemix for software development and testing on its cloud infrastructure. 
Another example is Salesforce.com’s Force.com, which allows developers to build 
applications that are hosted on its servers as a service.
A cloud can be private, public, or hybrid. A public cloud is owned and maintained 
by CSPs, such as Amazon Web Services, IBM, HP, and Dell, and made available to

multiple customers, who pay only for the resources they use. A public cloud offers rela-
tively secure enterprise-class reliability at significant cost savings. Because organizations 
using public clouds do not own the infrastructure, they do not have to make large 
investments in their own hardware and software. Instead, they purchase their computing 
services from remote providers and pay only for the amount of computing power they 
actually use (utility computing) or are billed on a monthly or annual subscription basis. 
The term on-demand computing is also used to describe such services. As such, public 
clouds are ideal environments for small and medium-sized businesses who cannot afford 
to fully develop their own infrastructure; for applications requiring high performance, 
scalability, and availability; for new application development and testing; and for com-
panies that have occasional large computing projects. Gartner estimates that spending 
on public cloud services worldwide will grow over 15% in 2015, to €162 billion (Gartner, 
Inc., 2015a). Companies such as Google, Apple, Dropbox, and others also offer public 
clouds as a consumer service for online storage of data, music, and photos. Google Drive, 
Dropbox, and Apple iCloud are leading examples of this type of consumer cloud service.
A private cloud provides similar options as a public cloud but is operated solely 
for the benefit of a single tenant. It might be managed by the organization or a third 
party and hosted either internally or externally. Like public clouds, private clouds can 
allocate storage, computing power, or other resources seamlessly to provide computing 
resources on an as-needed basis. Companies that have stringent regulatory compliance 
or specialized licensing requirements that necessitate high security, such as financial 
services or healthcare companies, or that want flexible information technology 
resources and a cloud service model while retaining control over their own IT infra-
structure, are gravitating toward these private clouds.
Large firms are most likely to adopt a hybrid cloud computing model, in which 
they use their own infrastructure for their most essential core activities and adopt 
public cloud computing for less-critical systems or for additional processing capacity 
during peak business periods. Table 2.5 compares the three cloud computing models. 
Cloud computing will gradually shift firms from having a fixed infrastructure capacity

toward a more flexible infrastructure, some of it owned by the firm, and some of it 
rented from giant data centers owned by CSPs.
Cloud computing has some drawbacks. Unless users make provisions for storing their 
data locally, the responsibility for data storage and control is in the hands of the provider. 
Some companies worry about the security risks related to entrusting their critical data 
and systems to an outside vendor that also works with other companies. Companies 
expect their systems to be available 24/7 and do not want to suffer any loss of business 
capability if cloud infrastructures malfunction. Nevertheless, the trend is for companies to 
shift more of their computer processing and storage to some form of cloud infrastructure.
Cloud computing has many significant implications for e-commerce. For e-com-
merce firms, cloud computing radically reduces the cost of building and operating Web 
sites because the necessary hardware infrastructure and software can be licensed as 
a service from CSPs at a fraction of the cost of purchasing these services as products. 
This means firms can adopt “pay-as-you-go” and “pay-as-you-grow” strategies when 
building out their Web sites. For instance, according to Amazon, hundreds of thousands 
of customers use Amazon Web Services. For individuals, cloud computing means you 
no longer need a powerful laptop or desktop computer to engage in e-commerce or 
other activities. Instead, you can use much less-expensive tablet computers or smart-
phones that cost a few hundred dollars. For corporations, cloud computing means that 
a significant part of hardware and software costs (infrastructure costs) can be reduced 
because firms can obtain these services online for a fraction of the cost of owning, and 
they do not have to hire an IT staff to support the infrastructure.
OTHER INTERNET PROTOCOLS AND UTILITY PROGRAMS
There are many other Internet protocols and utility programs that provide services 
to users in the form of Internet applications that run on Internet clients and servers. 
These Internet services are based on universally accepted protocols—or standards—
that are available to everyone who uses the Internet. They are not owned by any 
organization, but they are services that have been developed over many years and 
made available to all Internet users.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the Internet protocol used to transfer 
Web pages (described in the following section). HTTP was developed by the World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). HTTP 
runs in the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model shown in Figure 2.4 on page 105. 
An HTTP session begins when a client’s browser requests a resource, such as a Web 
page, from a remote Internet server. When the server responds by sending the page 
requested, the HTTP session for that object ends. Because Web pages may have many 
objects on them—graphics, sound or video files, frames, and so forth—each object 
must be requested by a separate HTTP message. For more information about HTTP, 
you can consult RFC 2616, which details the standards for HTTP/1.1, the version of 
HTTP most commonly used today (Internet Society, 1999). (An RFC is a document 
published by the Internet Society [ISOC] or one of the other organizations involved in 
Internet governance that sets forth the standards for various Internet-related technolo-
gies. You will learn more about the organizations involved in setting standards for the 
Internet later in the chapter.)

E-mail is one of the oldest, most important, and frequently used Internet services. 
Like HTTP, the various Internet protocols used to handle e-mail all run in the Applica-
tion Layer of TCP/IP. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the Internet protocol 
used to send e-mail to a server. SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol that 
was developed in the early 1980s. SMTP handles only the sending of e-mail. To retrieve 
e-mail from a server, the client computer uses either Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) 
or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). You can set POP3 to retrieve e-mail 
messages from the server and then delete the messages on the server, or retain them 
on the server. IMAP is a more current e-mail protocol supported by all browsers and 
most servers and ISPs. IMAP allows users to search, organize, and filter their mail prior 
to downloading it from the server.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is one of the original Internet services. FTP runs 
in TCP/IP’s Application Layer and permits users to transfer files from a server to their 
client computer, and vice versa. The files can be documents, programs, or large data-
base files. FTP is the fastest and most convenient way to transfer files larger than 1 
megabyte, which some e-mail servers will not accept. More information about FTP is 
available in RFC 959 (Internet Society, 1985).
Telnet is a network protocol that also runs in TCP/IP’s Application Layer and is 
used to allow remote login on another computer. The term Telnet also refers to the 
Telnet program, which provides the client part of the protocol and enables the client 
to emulate a mainframe computer terminal. (The industry-standard terminals defined 
in the days of mainframe computing are VT-52, VT-100, and IBM 3250.) You can then 
attach yourself to a computer on the Internet that supports Telnet and run programs 
or download files from that computer. Telnet was the first “remote work” program that 
permitted users to work on a computer from a remote location.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) are protocols 
that operate between the Transport and Application Layers of TCP/IP and secure 
communications between the client and the server. SSL/TLS helps secure e-commerce 
communications and payments through a variety of techniques, such as message 
encryption and digital signatures, that we will discuss further in Chapter 4.
Packet InterNet Groper (Ping) is a utility program that allows you to check the 
connection between a client computer and a TCP/IP network (see Figure 2.9). Ping

will also tell you the time it takes for the server to respond, giving you some idea about 
the speed of the server and the Internet at that moment. You can run Ping from the 
DOS prompt on a personal computer with a Windows operating system by typing: 
ping <domain name>. We will discuss Ping further in Chapter 4, because one way 
to slow down or even crash a domain server is to send it millions of ping requests.
Tracert is one of several route-tracing utilities that allow you to follow the path 
of a message you send from your client to a remote computer on the Internet. 
Figure 2.10 shows the result of a message sent to a remote host using a visual route-
tracing program called VisualRoute (available from Visualware).

THE INTERNET TODAY
In 2015, there are an estimated 3.1 billion Internet users worldwide, up from 100 million 
users at year-end 1997. While this is a huge number, it represents only about 40% of the 
world’s population (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). Although Internet user growth has slowed in 
the United States and Western Europe to about 1%–2% annually, worldwide, the growth

rate is about 6.7%, with the highest growth areas being the Asia-Pacific region and the 
Middle East and Africa (both still growing at over 8%). By 2019, it is expected that there 
will be almost 3.9 billion Internet users worldwide. One would think the Internet would 
be overloaded with such incredible growth; however, this has not been true for several 
reasons. First, client/server computing is highly extensible. By simply adding servers 
and clients, the population of Internet users can grow indefinitely. Second, the Internet 
architecture is built in layers so that each layer can change without disturbing develop-
ments in other layers. For instance, the technology used to move messages through the 
Internet can go through radical changes to make service faster without being disruptive 
to your desktop applications running on the Internet.
Figure 2.11 illustrates the “hourglass” and layered architecture of the Internet. 
The Internet can be viewed conceptually as having four layers: Network Technology 
	 FIGURE 2.11	
THE HOURGLASS MODEL OF THE INTERNET
The Internet can be characterized as an hourglass modular structure with a lower layer containing the 
bit-carrying infrastructure (including cables and switches) and an upper layer containing user applications 
such as e-mail and the Web. In the narrow waist are transportation protocols such as TCP/IP.

Substrates, Transport Services and Representation Standards, Middleware Services, and 
Applications.4 The Network Technology Substrate layer is composed of telecom-
munications networks and protocols. The Transport Services and Representation 
Standards layer houses the TCP/IP protocol. The Applications layer contains client 
applications such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, and audio or video playback. The 
Middleware Services layer is the glue that ties the applications to the communications 
networks and includes such services as security, authentication, addresses, and storage 
repositories. Users work with applications (such as e-mail) and rarely become aware of 
middleware that operates in the background. Because all layers use TCP/IP and other 
common standards linking all four layers, it is possible for there to be significant changes 
in the Network layer without forcing changes in the Applications layer.
THE INTERNET BACKBONE
Figure 2.12 illustrates some of the main physical elements of today’s physical Internet. 
Originally, the Internet had a single backbone, but today’s Internet is woven together 
from numerous privately owned networks comprised of high-bandwidth fiber-optic

architecture layers.

cable that are physically connected with each other and that transfer information 
from one private network to another. These long-haul fiber-optic networks are owned 
by the major cable providers and firms which are sometimes referred to as Tier 1 
Internet Service Providers (Tier 1 ISPs) (see Table 2.6). For the sake of clarity we 
will refer to these networks of backbones as a single “backbone.” The backbone has 
been likened to a giant pipeline that transports data around the world in milliseconds. 
The backbone is typically composed of fiber-optic cable with bandwidths ranging from 
155 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps. Bandwidth measures how much data can be transferred over a 
communications medium within a fixed period of time and is usually expressed in bits 
per second (Bps), kilobits (thousands of bits) per second (Kbps), megabits (millions of 
bits) per second (Mbps), or gigabits (billions of bits) per second (Gbps).
Connections to other continents are made via a combination of undersea fiber-
optic cable and satellite links. The backbones in foreign countries typically are 
operated by a mixture of private and public owners. The backbone has built-in 
redundancy so that if one part breaks down, data can be rerouted to another part of 
the backbone. Redundancy refers to multiple duplicate devices and paths in a 
network. A recent study of the Internet’s physical structure in the United States has 
created one of the first maps of the Internet’s long-haul fiber network as it currently 
exists. The map reveals that, not surprisingly, there are dense networks of fiber in 
the Northeast and coastal areas of the United States, while there is a pronounced 
absence of infrastructure in the Upper Plains and Four Corners regions. The U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security has made the map, as well as the data that under-
lies it, available to government, private, and public researchers, believing that doing 
so could make the Internet more resilient by improving knowledge (Simonite, 2015; 
Durairajan et al., 2015).
INTERNET EXCHANGE POINTS
Hubs where the backbone intersects with regional and local networks, and where the 
backbone owners connect with one another were originally called Network Access 
Points (NAPs) or Metropolitan Area Exchanges (MAEs), but now are more commonly 
referred to as Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) (see Figure 2.13). IXPs use high-
speed switching computers to connect the backbone to regional and local networks, 
and exchange messages with one another. The regional and local networks are owned 
by private telecommunications firms; they generally are fiber-optic networks operating 
at more than 100 Mbps. The regional networks lease access to ISPs, private companies, 
and government institutions.

CAMPUS AREA NETWORKS
Campus area networks (CANs) are generally local area networks operating within 
a single organization—such as New York University or Microsoft Corporation. In fact, 
most large organizations have hundreds of such local area networks. These organiza-
tions are sufficiently large that they lease access to the Web directly from regional and 
national carriers. These local area networks generally are running Ethernet (a local 
area network protocol) and have network operating systems such as Windows Server 
or Linux that permit desktop clients to connect to the Internet through a local Internet 
server attached to their campus networks. Connection speeds in campus area networks 
are in the range of 10–100 Mbps to the desktop.
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
The firms that provide the lowest level of service in the multi-tiered Internet archi-
tecture by leasing Internet access to home owners, small businesses, and some large 
institutions are called Internet Service Providers (ISPs). ISPs are retail providers. 
They deal with “the last mile of service” to the curb—homes and business offices. ISPs 
typically connect to IXPs with high-speed telephone or cable lines (45 Mbps and 
higher).
There are a number of major ISPs throughout Europe, such as BT (Plusnet), 
Sky Broadband, Virgin Media, and TalkTalk in the United Kingdom; Orange, Free, 
and Alice in France; and Tiscali, BT Italia, and Fastweb in Italy. If you have home 
or small business Internet access, an ISP likely provides the service to you. Satel-
lite firms also offer Internet access, especially in remote areas where broadband 
service is not available.
Table 2.7 summarizes the variety of services, speeds, and costs of ISP Internet 
connections. There are two types of ISP service: narrowband and broadband. Narrow­
band service is the traditional telephone modem connection now operating at 56.6 
Kbps (although the actual throughput hovers around 30 Kbps due to line noise that

causes extensive resending of packets). This used to be the most common form of 
connection worldwide but it has been largely replaced by broadband connections in 
the United States, Europe, and Asia. Broadband service is based on DSL (including 
high speed fiber-optic service), cable, telephone (T1 and T3 lines), and satellite tech-
nologies. Broadband, in the context of Internet service, refers to any communication 
technology that permits clients to play streaming audio and video files at acceptable 
speeds. In January 2015, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission updated its 
broadband benchmark speeds to 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. 
According to Akamai, the global average connection speed in 2015 was 5.1 Mbps, and 
the global average peak connection speed was 32.5 Mbps. The United States ranks 20th 
with an 11.7 Mbps average connection speed (South Korea leads, at 23.1 Mbps) and 
24th with a 50.4 Mbps average peak connection speed (Singapore leads, at 108.3 Mbps) 
(Akamai, 2015). The FCC found that 17% of all Americans lack access to 25 Mbps/3 
Mbps service, and that rural America is particularly underserved, with more than half 
lacking such access (Federal Communication Commission, 2015). In 2015, there are 
an estimated 670 million broadband households (almost 32% of all households) (eMar-
keter, Inc., 2014).
The actual throughput of data will depend on a variety of factors including noise 
in the line and the number of subscribers requesting service. Service-level speeds 
quoted are typically only for downloads of Internet content; upload speeds tend to be 
slower, although a number of broadband ISPs have plans that offer the same upload 
as download speed. T1 and T3 lines are publicly regulated utility lines that offer a 
guaranteed level of service, but the actual throughput of the other forms of Internet 
service is not guaranteed.
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service is a telephone technology that provides 
high-speed access to the Internet through ordinary telephone lines found in a home 
or business. Service levels typically range from about .5 to 15 Mbps. DSL service 
requires that customers live within two miles (about 4,000 meters) of a neighborhood 
telephone switching center. In order to compete with cable companies, telephone 
companies now also offer an advanced form of DSL called FiOS (fiber-optic service) 
that provides up to 500 Mbps to homes and businesses.
Cable Internet refers to a cable television technology that piggybacks digital 
access to the Internet using the same analog or digital video cable providing television 
signals to a home. Cable Internet is a major broadband alternative to DSL service, 
generally providing faster speeds and a “triple play” subscription: telephone, television, 
and Internet for a single monthly payment. Cable Internet services typically range 
from 1 Mbps up to 500 Mbps. Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, Telefonica, and Liberty 
Global are some of the major cable Internet providers in Europe.
T1 and T3 are international telephone standards for digital communication. T1 
lines offer guaranteed delivery at 1.54 Mbps, while T3 lines offer 45 Mbps. T1 lines 
cost about $200–$300 per month, and T3 lines around $2500–$6000 per month. These 
are leased, dedicated, guaranteed lines suitable for corporations, government agencies, 
and businesses such as ISPs requiring high-speed guaranteed service levels.

band Internet access primarily to homes and offices located in rural areas where DSL

or cable Internet access is not available. Access speeds and monthly costs are comparable 
to DSL and cable, but typically require a higher initial payment for installation of a small 
(18-inch) satellite dish. Upload speeds tend to be slower, typically 1–5 Mbps. Satellite 
providers typically have policies that limit the total megabytes of data that a single 
account can download within a set period, usually monthly. Major satellite providers in 
Europe include Hughes, Telefonica, Europasat, and Bentley Walker, among others.
Nearly all business firms and government agencies have broadband connections 
to the Internet. Demand for broadband service has grown so rapidly because it greatly 
speeds up the process of downloading Web pages and large video and audio files 
(see Table 2.8). As the quality of Internet service offerings continues to expand, the 
demand for broadband access will continue to swell.
INTRANETS
The very same Internet technologies that make it possible to operate a worldwide 
public network can also be used by private and government organizations as internal 
networks. An intranet is a TCP/IP network located within a single organization for 
purposes of communications and information processing. Internet technologies are 
generally far less expensive than proprietary networks, and there is a global source of 
new applications that can run on intranets. In fact, all the applications available on 
the public Internet can be used in private intranets. The largest provider of local area 
network software is Microsoft, followed by open source Linux, both of which use TCP/
IP networking protocols.
WHO GOVERNS THE INTERNET?
Aficionados and journalists often claim that the Internet is governed by no one, 
and indeed cannot be governed, and that it is inherently above and beyond the 
law. What these people forget is that the Internet runs over private and public 
intranet
a TCP/IP network located 
within a single 
organization for purposes 
of communications and 
information processing

telecommunications facilities that are themselves governed by laws, and subject to 
the same pressures as all telecommunications carriers. In fact, the Internet is tied into 
a complex web of governing bodies, national governments, and international profes-
sional societies. There is no one single governing organization that controls activity on 
the Internet. Instead, there are a number of organizations that influence the system 
and monitor its operations. Among the governing bodies of the Internet are:
•	 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which coordi-
nates the Internet’s systems of unique identifiers: IP addresses, protocol parameter 
registries, and the top-level domain systems. ICANN was created in 1998 as a non-
profit organization and currently manages the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
(IANA), which is in charge of assigning IP addresses, under a contract from the U.S. 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an agency 
of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
•	 The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is an open international com-
munity of network operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolu-
tion of the Internet architecture and operation of the Internet. The IETF has a 
number of working groups, organized into several different areas, that develop 
and promote Internet standards, which influence the way people use and manage 
the Internet.
•	 The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which focuses on the evolution of the Inter-
net. The IRTF has a number of long-term research groups working on various topics 
such as Internet protocols, applications, applications, and technology.
•	 The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), which is responsible for technical 
management of IETF activities and the Internet standards process.
•	 The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which helps define the overall architecture of 
the Internet and oversees the IETF and IRTF.
•	 The Internet Society (ISOC), which is a consortium of corporations, government 
agencies, and nonprofit organizations that monitors Internet policies and practices.
•	 The Internet Governance Forum (IGF), which is a multi-stakeholder open forum for 
debate on issues related to Internet governance.
•	 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is a largely academic group that sets 
HTML and other programming standards for the Web.
•	 The Internet Network Operators Groups (NOGs), which are informal groups that are 
made up of ISPs, IXPs, and others that discuss and attempt to influence matters 
related to Internet operations and regulation.
While none of these organizations has actual control over the Internet and how 
it functions, they can and do influence government agencies, major network owners, 
ISPs, corporations, and software developers with the goal of keeping the Internet 
operating as efficiently as possible. ICANN comes closest to being a manager of the 
Internet and reflects the powerful role that the U.S. Department of Commerce has 
played historically in Internet governance. The United States has been responsible for 
the IANA function since the beginning of the Internet. After the creation of ICANN,

however, the expectation was the function would eventually be transferred out of 
the U.S. government’s control. In 2006, however, the U.S. Department of Commerce 
announced that the U.S. government would retain oversight over the root servers, 
contrary to initial expectations. There were several reasons for this move, including 
the use of the Internet for basic communications services by terrorist groups and the 
uncertainty that might be caused should an international body take over. In 2008, 
the Department of Commerce reaffirmed this stance, stating that it did not have 
any plans to transition management of the authoritative root zone file to ICANN 
(U.S. Department of Commerce, 2008). At the same time, growing Internet powers 
China and Russia were lobbying for more functions of the Internet to be brought 
under the control of the United Nations, raising fears that governance of the Internet 
could become even more politicized (Pfanner, 2012). In 2014, the United States, under 
continued pressure from other countries, finally announced its willingness to transi-
tion control of IANA, provided that certain stipulations are met, including that the 
organization managing the IANA functions not be specifically controlled by any other 
government or inter-governmental organization (such as the United Nations). The 
transition is intended to take place by September 2016, although it could be extended 
to as late as September 2019.
In addition to these professional bodies, the Internet must also conform to the laws 
of the sovereign nation-states in which it operates, as well as the technical infrastruc-
tures that exist within each nation-state. Although in the early years of the Internet 
there was very little legislative or executive interference, this situation is changing as 
the Internet plays a growing role in the distribution of information and knowledge, 
including content that some find objectionable.

further look at the issue of censorship of Internet content and substance.

THE FUTURE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE
The Internet is changing as new technologies appear and new applications are 
developed. The next era of the Internet is being built today by private corporations, 
universities, and government agencies. To appreciate the potential benefits of the 
Internet of the future, you must first understand the limitations of the Internet’s 
current infrastructure.
LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT INTERNET
Much of the Internet’s current infrastructure is several decades old (equivalent to a 
century in Internet time). It suffers from a number of limitations, including:
•	 Bandwidth limitations. There is insufficient capacity throughout the backbone, the 
metropolitan switching centers, and most importantly, the “last mile” to the house 
and small businesses. The result is slow peak-hour service (congestion) and a 
limited ability to handle high volumes of video and voice traffic.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND 
SURVEILLANCE OF THE INTERNET
Hardly a week goes by without reports 
that a massive protest has occurred in 
the streets of a big city somewhere in 
the world. Invariably, the Internet, social 
media, and mobile phones are either blamed or 
praised for enabling these popular expressions of 
discontent with political regimes, corrupt officials, 
unemployment, or wealth inequality. Events such 
as the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia and the Arab 
Spring in Egypt in 2010, and more recently, pro-
tests in Madrid, Caracas, Moscow, Pakistan, Syria, 
and even heretofore quiet U.S. Midwestern towns 
like Ferguson, Missouri, encourage us all to think 
of the Internet and the Web as an extraordinary 
technology unleashing torrents of human creativ-
ity, innovation, expression, and sometimes, popular 
rebellion, and even democracy.
How ironic then that the same Internet has 
spawned an explosion in government control and 
surveillance of individuals on the Internet. Totalitar-
ian dictators of the mid-twentieth century would 
have given their eyeteeth for a technology such as 
this, that can track what millions of people do, say, 
think, and search for in billions of e-mails, searches, 
blogs, and Facebook posts every day.
In the early years of the Internet and the Web, 
many people assumed that because the Internet is 
so widely dispersed, it must be difficult to control 
or monitor. But the reality is quite different. We 
now know that just about all governments assert 
some kind of control and surveillance over Inter-
net content and messages, and in many nations this 
control over the Internet and the people who use it 
is very extensive.
While the Internet is a decentralized network, 
Internet traffic in all countries runs through 
large fiber-optic trunk lines that are controlled 
by national authorities or private firms. In China, 
there are three such lines, and China requires the 
companies that own these lines to configure their 
routers for both internal and external service 
requests. When a request originates in China for a 
Web page in Chicago, Chinese routers examine the 
request to see if the site is on a blacklist, and then 
examine words in the requested Web page to see if 
it contains blacklisted terms. The system is often 
referred to as “The Great Firewall of China” and is 
implemented with the assistance of Cisco Systems 
(the U.S. firm that is the largest manufacturer of 
routers in the world) and California-based Blue 
Coat, which provides deep packet inspection soft-
ware. Other U.S. Internet firms are also involved in 
China’s censorship and surveillance efforts, includ-
ing Yahoo, Microsoft, and Juniper Networks, among 
many others.
In 2015, China strengthened and extended 
its regulation of the Internet in the name of 
social stability as political unrest in the country 
has worsened. Recently passed legislation allows 
Web users to be jailed for up to three years if they 
post defamatory rumors that are read by more 
than 5,000 people. China also issued new rules 
to restrict the dissemination of political news and 
opinions on instant messaging applications such as 
WeChat, a text messaging app similar to Twitter 
and WhatsApp. Users are required to post political 
opinions and news only to state-authorized media 
outlets and are required to use their own names 
when establishing accounts. In 2015, Chinese Inter-
net companies deleted over 60,000 accounts with 
names that failed to adhere to the new regulations. 
In 2015, China also issued guidelines to regulate 
Internet-based financial institutions, such as peer-
to-peer lending platforms.
Displeased by China’s censorship efforts, 
Google began to encrypt searches originating in 

China in order to prevent surveillance by state 
agencies in 2014. In response, Chinese authorities 
severely disrupted Google search access, as well as 
popular services like Google Maps and Gmail. The 
disruption occurred on the 25th anniversary of the 
government’s crackdown on the pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Facebook, 
Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube have been blocked in 
China for years. Access to Google was eventually 
restored, but in 2015 China continued to battle 
Google, this time over Google’s decision to no 
longer recognize security certificates for Chinese 
sites issued by major Chinese Internet authori-
ties, instead displaying them as “distrusted sites.” 
Google and China are also battling to bring greater 
Internet connectivity to Cuba, which ranks near the 
bottom in Internet penetration worldwide. Google’s 
proposed plan for Cuba would focus on mobile con-
nectivity and favor openness, and China’s would 
allow the Cuban government to conduct significant 
surveillance on their citizens’ Internet activities.
While China is often criticized for its extensive 
Internet controls, other countries are not far behind. 
Iran’s Internet surveillance of its citizens is con-
sidered by security experts to be one of the world’s 
most sophisticated mechanisms for controlling and 
censoring the Internet, allowing it to examine the 
content of individual online communications on a 
massive scale, far more sophisticated than even 
China’s Internet surveillance activities. The Iranian 
system goes far beyond preventing access to specific 
sites such as BBC World News, Google, and Face-
book. One technique is deep packet inspection of 
every e-mail, text, or tweet. Deep packet inspection 
allows governments to read messages, alter their 
contents for disinformation purposes, and iden-
tify senders and recipients. It is accomplished by 
installing computers in the line between users and 
ISPs, opening up every digitized packet, inspect-
ing for keywords and images, reconstructing the 
message, and sending it on. This is done for all 
Internet traffic including Skype, Facebook, e-mail, 
tweets, and messages sent to proxy servers. In 
2015, Iran acknowledged an overarching 
effort to surveil social networks, resulting in 
the elimination of 130 Facebook pages and 12 
arrests for crimes such as insulting the Ayatollah 
Khomeini.
In Russia, a new law took effect in February 
2014 that allows the government to close Web sites 
without a court decision. Sites can be closed if the 
General Prosecutor’s office declares the material 
on a site to be “extremist.” In August 2014, Russia 
expanded Internet regulations to the blogosphere, 
requiring bloggers with more than 3,000 daily 
readers to register their real names and contact 
information with Russia’s communications regula-
tor. In 2015, Russia passed laws requiring domestic 
Internet companies to store their data on Russian 
soil, allowing the government to control it and limit 
access.
In January 2014, the Turkish government shut 
down the file-sharing site SoundCloud after record-
ings of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
arranging to obtain two villas for his family in 
return for a zoning change granted to a construc-
tion tycoon surfaced. When the recordings moved to 
YouTube, Turkey shut down YouTube. Turkey already 
has extensive regulations prohibiting online por-
nography, gambling, and criticism of the founder of 
modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Attaturk. In April 
2014, the Turkish Constitutional Court ordered the 
government to restore access to YouTube, Twitter, 
SoundCloud, and other sites because the shut-
downs were a violation of freedom of expression, 
but the culture of censorship remains. In 2015, the 
Turkish parliament voted to expand Turkish law 
enforcement’s ability to conduct online surveillance 
without court orders.
Both Europe and the United States have, at 
various times, also taken steps to control access to 
Internet sites, censor Web content, and engage in 
extensive surveillance of communications, although 
not to the extent of Iran, China, and many other 
nations nor to attack specific political groups or 
inhibit the freedom of expression. For instance,

Great Britain has a list of blocked sites, as 
do Germany and France. The Australian Com-
munications and Media Authority has developed 
a list of several hundred Web sites that have been 
refused registration in Australia, mostly violent 
video game and online pornography sites. The 
United States and European countries generally 
ban the sale, distribution, and/or possession of 
online child pornography. Both France and Germany 
bar online Nazi memorabilia. Even in South Korea, 
one of the world’s most wired countries, there are 
restrictions on pornographic sites, games sites, and 
limits on Google Maps.
In response to terrorism threats and other 
crimes, European governments and the U.S. govern-
ment also perform deep packet inspection on e-mail 
and text communications of terrorist suspects. This 
surveillance is not limited to cross-border interna-
tional data flows and includes large-scale domestic 
surveillance and analysis of routine e-mail, tweets, 
and other messages. In 2013, National Security 
Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden made 
headlines by leaking classified NSA documents 
shedding light on the NSA’s PRISM program, which 
grants the agency unauthorized access to the servers 
of major Internet companies such as Facebook, 
Google, Apple, Microsoft, and many others. Addi-
tionally, the documents revealed the existence of the 
NSA’s XKeyscore program, which allows analysts 
to search databases of e-mails, chats, and browsing 
histories of individual citizens without any authori-
zation. Warrants, court clearance, or other forms of 
legal documentation are not required for analysts 
to use the technology. Snowden’s documents also 
showed spy agencies were tapping data from smart-
phone apps like Candy Crush, and most others, and 
that the NSA was tapping the flow of personal user 
information between Google and Yahoo. The NSA 
claimed that the program was only used to monitor 
foreign intelligence targets and that the information 
it collects has assisted in apprehending terrorists. 
The FBI also has an Internet surveillance unit, the 
National Domestic Communications Assistance 
Center. The NDCAC’s mission is to assist in the 
development of new surveillance technologies that 
will allow authorities to increase the interception of 
Internet, wireless, and VoIP communications.
However, efforts are underway in the United 
States to curb domestic and international counter-
terrorist agencies like the NSA from conducting 
dragnet surveillance of the entire American popu-
lation, strengthen court oversight of surveillance, 
limit surveillance to specific individuals, and ease 
disclosure rules for Internet firms who receive 
requests from government agencies. In 2015, Con-
gress passed the USA Freedom Act, which limits 
the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records. 
However, equally concerted efforts are underway 
to expand these types of spying powers. In 2015, 
for instance, the Obama administration expanded 
the NSA’s ability to perform warrantless wiretaps 
on suspected malicious hackers, allowing them to 
monitor international Internet traffic from these 
suspects as well as domestic traffic.

•	 Quality of service limitations. Today’s information packets take a circuitous route to 
get to their final destinations. This creates the phenomenon of latency—delays in 
messages caused by the uneven flow of information packets through the network. 
In the case of e-mail, latency is not noticeable. However, with streaming video and 
synchronous communication, such as a telephone call, latency is noticeable to the 
user and perceived as “jerkiness” in movies or delays in voice communication. 
Today’s Internet uses “best-effort” quality of service (QOS), which makes no guar-
antees about when or whether data will be delivered, and provides each packet 
with the same level of service, no matter who the user is or what type of data is 
contained in the packet. A higher level of service quality is required if the Internet 
is to keep expanding into new services, such as video on demand and telephony.
•	 Network architecture limitations. Today, a thousand requests for a single music track 
from a central server will result in a thousand efforts by the server to download 
the music to each requesting client. This slows down network performance, as the 
same music track is sent out a thousand times to clients that might be located in the 
same metropolitan area. This is very different from television, where the program 
is broadcast once to millions of homes.
•	 Wired Internet. The Internet is still largely based on cables—fiber-optic and coaxial 
copper cables. Copper cables use a centuries-old technology, and fiber-optic cable is 
expensive to place underground. The wired nature of the Internet restricts mobility 
of users although it is changing rapidly as Wi-Fi hotspots proliferate, and cellular 
phone technology advances. However, cellular systems are often overloaded due 
to the growth in the number of smartphones.
Now imagine an Internet at least 1,000 times as powerful as today’s Internet, one 
that is not subjected to the limitations of bandwidth, protocols, architecture, physical 
connections, and language detailed previously. Welcome to the world of the future 
Internet, and the next generation of e-commerce services and products!
THE INTERNET2® PROJECT
Internet2® is an advanced networking consortium of more than 450 member institu-
tions including universities, corporations, government research agencies, and not-for-
profit networking organizations, all working in partnership to facilitate the 
development, deployment, and use of revolutionary Internet technologies. The broader 
Internet2 community includes more than 93,000 institutions across the United States 
and international networking partners in more than 100 countries. Internet2’s work 
is a continuation of the kind of cooperation among government, private, and educa-
tional organizations that created the original Internet.
The advanced networks created and in use by Internet2 members provide an 
environment in which new technologies can be tested and enhanced. For instance, 
Internet2 provides a next-generation, nationwide 100 gigabit-per-second network that 
not only makes available a reliable production services platform for current high-
performance needs but also creates a powerful experimental platform for the develop-
ment of new network capabilities. See Table 2.9 to get some sense of just how fast a 
100-Gbps network is in terms of data transmission times. The fourth generation of this

and Information Administration’s Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, has 
now been deployed. The hybrid optical and packet network provides 8.8 terabits of 
capacity with the ability to seamlessly scale as requirements grow, includes over 15,000 
miles of owned fiber optic cable, and reaches into underserved areas of the country, 
supporting connectivity for approximately 200,000 U.S. community anchor institutions 
(schools, local libraries, and museums), and enabling them to provide citizens across 
the country with telemedicine, distance learning, and other advanced applications not 
possible with consumer-grade Internet services. The infrastructure supports a wide 
range of IP and optical services already available today and also will stimulate a new 
generation of innovative services. The goal is to create an intelligent global ecosystem 
that will enable researchers, scientists, and others to “turn on” high-capacity network 
connections whenever and wherever they are needed. Table 2.10 describes some of 
the projects that Internet2’s 100-Gbps network is enabling. Other initiatives involve 
science and engineering (advanced network applications in support of distributed lab 
environments, remote access to rare scientific instruments, and distributed large-scale 
computation and data access), health sciences and health networks (telemedicine, 
medical and biological research, and health education and awareness), and arts and 
humanities (collaborative live performances, master classes, remote auditions, and 
interactive performing arts education and media events).
THE FIRST MILE AND THE LAST MILE
The Internet2 project is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to future enhancements 
to the Internet. In 2007, the NSF began work on the Global Environment for Network 
Innovations (GENI) initiative. GENI is a unique virtual laboratory for exploring future 
internets at scale. GENI aims to promote innovations in network science, security tech-
nologies, services, and applications. GENI is a partnership of leading academic centers 
and private corporations such as Cisco, IBM, and HP, among many others. To date, 
awards have been made to 83 academic/industry teams for various projects to build, 
integrate, and operate early prototypes of the GENI virtual laboratory (Geni.net, 2014). 
Over the next two years, GENI will transition from being overseen by NSF’s GENI Project 
Office to a community governance model (Geni.net, 2015).
The most significant privately initiated (but often government-influenced) 
changes are coming in two areas: fiber-optic trunk line bandwidth and wireless Inter-
net services. Fiber optics is concerned with the first mile or backbone Internet services 
that carry bulk traffic long distances. Wireless Internet is concerned with the last 
mile—from the larger Internet to the user’s smartphone, tablet computer, or laptop.

Fiber Optics and the Bandwidth Explosion in the First Mile
Fiber-optic cable consists of up to hundreds of strands of glass that use light to 
transmit data. It often replaces existing coaxial and twisted pair cabling because it can 
transmit much more data at faster speeds, with less interference and better data 
security. Fiber-optic cable is also thinner and lighter, taking up less space during 
installation. The hope is to use fiber optics to expand network bandwidth capacity in 
order to prepare for the expected increases in Web traffic once next-generation Internet 
services are widely adopted.
Telecommunication firms have made substantial investments in fiber optic cross-
country and regional cable systems in the last decade. For instance, Verizon has spent 
over $23 billion since 2004, building and expanding its FiOS fiber-optic Internet service 
that can provide speeds of up to 500 Mbps, and currently has about 6.6 million FiOS 
customers. In 2012, Google joined the fray with Google Fiber, a 1-Gbps fiber-optic 
network, that is currently available in 3 cities. This installed base of fiber-optic cable 
represents a vast digital highway that is currently being exploited by YouTube (Google), 
Facebook, and other high-bandwidth applications. But despite the interest in fiber, only 
about 7.7% of U.S. homes had fiber connections as of 2014, a much lower percentage 
than a number of other countries around the world (Murphy, 2014). Table 2.11 illus-
trates several optical bandwidth standards and compares them to traditional T lines.
The Last Mile: Mobile Internet Access

will play an important role in bringing high-speed broadband to the household and

small business. The goal of the Internet2 and GENI projects is to bring gigabit and 
ultimately terabit bandwidth to the household over the next 20 years. But along with 
fiber optics, arguably the most significant development for the Internet and Web in 
the last five years has been the emergence of mobile Internet access.
Wireless Internet is concerned with the last mile of Internet access to the user’s 
home, office, car, smartphone, or tablet computer, anywhere they are located. Up 
until 2000, the last-mile access to the Internet—with the exception of a small satellite 
Internet connect population—was bound up in land lines of some sort: copper coaxial 
TV cables or telephone lines or, in some cases, fiber-optic lines to the office. Today, 
in comparison, high-speed cell phone networks and Wi-Fi network hotspots provide 
a major alternative.
Today, sales of desktop computers have been eclipsed by sales of smartphones, 
and tablet and ultramobile laptop computers with built-in wireless networking func-
tionality. Clearly, a large part of the Internet is now mobile, access-anywhere broad-
band service for the delivery of video, music, and Web search. According to eMarketer, 
there are almost more than 2.25 billion mobile Internet users worldwide in 2015 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2015e; 2015f).
Telephone-based versus Computer Network-based Wireless Internet Access
There are two different basic types of wireless Internet connectivity: telephone-based 
and computer network-based systems.
Telephone-based wireless Internet access connects the user to a global telephone 
system (land, satellite, and microwave) that has a long history of dealing with mil-
lions of users simultaneously and already has in place a large-scale transaction billing 
system and related infrastructure. Cellular telephones and the telephone industry 
are currently the largest providers of wireless access to the Internet today. In 2014, 
there were almost 1.9 billion mobile phones sold worldwide (of which 1.2 billion 
were smartphones), with a similar amount expected to be sold in 2015 (Gartner, Inc.,

2015b). Table 2.12 summarizes the various telephone technologies used and under 
development for wireless Internet access.
Smartphones combine the functionality of a cell phone with that of a laptop com-
puter with Wi-Fi capability. This makes it possible to combine in one device music, video, 
Web access, and telephone service. Tablet computers can also access cellular networks.
Wireless local area network (WLAN)-based Internet access derives from a completely 
different background from telephone-based wireless Internet access. Popularly known 
as Wi-Fi, WLANs are based on computer local area networks where the task is to 
connect client computers (generally stationary) to server computers within local areas 
of, say, a few hundred meters. WLANs function by sending radio signals that are 
broadcast over the airwaves using certain radio frequency ranges (2.4 GHz to 5.875

GHz, depending on the type of standard involved). The major technologies here are 
the various versions of the Wi-Fi standard, WiMax, and Bluetooth (see Table 2.13).
In a Wi-Fi network, a wireless access point (also known as a “hot spot”) connects 
to the Internet directly via a broadband connection (cable, DSL telephone, or T1 
line) and then transmits a radio signal to a transmitter/receiver installed in a tablet 
or laptop computer or smartphone. Figure 2.14 illustrates how a Wi-Fi network 
works.
Wi-Fi provided under the 802.11 a/b/g/n specifications offers high-bandwidth 
capacity from 11 Mbps up to a maximum of 7 Gbps—far greater than any 3G or 
4G service currently in existence—but has a limited range of 300 meters, with the 
exception of WiMax discussed below. Wi-Fi is also exceptionally inexpensive. The 
cost of creating a corporate Wi-Fi network in a single 14-story building with an 
access point for each floor is less than $100 an access point. It would cost well over 
$500,000 to wire the same building with Ethernet cable. IEEE 802.11ac is a version 
of the 802.11 specification adopted in December 2013 that provides for throughputs 
of between 500 Mbps to over 1 Gbps. The newest standard, IEEE 802.11ad provides 
for throughput up to 7 Gbps. The first 802.11ad devices are likely to begin shipping 
by the end of 2015. Next-generation Wi-Fi standards currently being worked on by 
the IEEE 802.11 Working Group include 802.11ay, which deals with 60 Ghz wireless 
operations, and will provide for data rates of up to 20 Gbps, and 802.11ax, aimed at 
high-efficiency WLANs used for stadiums and other areas where many people want 
to access a Wi-Fi network at the same time. A next-generation 802.11ah standard 
aimed at the Internet of Things is also being developed (Weiss, 2015; Hsu, 2015).

WI-FI NETWORKS
In a Wi-Fi network, wireless access points connect to the Internet using a land-based broadband connection. 
Clients, which could be laptops, desktops, or tablet computers, connect to the access point using radio signals.
While initially a grass roots, “hippies and hackers” public access technology, billions 
of dollars have subsequently been poured into private ventures seeking to create for-profit 
Wi-Fi networks. One of the most prominent networks has been created by Boingo Wire-
less with more than 1 million hot spots around the globe. Optimum WiFi (available to 
Optimum Online customers for free) also offers over 1 million hotspots around the world. 
AT&T Wi-Fi Services (formerly Wayport) created another large network that provides 
Wi-Fi service at hotels, airports, McDonald’s, and IHOP restaurants, and Hertz airport 
rental offices, with more than 30,000 hot spots in the United States and access to Boingo’s 
wireless network internationally. T-Mobile and Sprint have also established Wi-Fi services 
at 2,000 Starbucks coffee shops and thousands of other public locations in the United 
States. Apple, in turn, has made Wi-Fi automatically available to iPhone and iPad devices 
as an alternative to the more expensive and much slower 3G and 4G cellular systems.
Will WLAN compete directly against far more expensive telephone 4G services? 
The answer is “eventually, but not right now.” Wi-Fi was originally a local area network 
technology of limited range, for stationary client computers, but with high capac-
ity suitable for most Web surfing and some corporate uses with modest bandwidth 
demands. Cellular phone systems are wide area networks of nearly unlimited range, 
for mobile client computers and handhelds, and with modest but rapidly increas-
ing capacity suitable for e-mail, photos, and Web browsing (on very small screens). 
However, the rock-bottom price of Wi-Fi coupled with ambitious plans for a 30-mile-
range WiMax (802.16) service suggests that Wi-Fi could drain significant business from 
far more capital-intensive cellular systems.

A second WLAN technology for connecting to the Internet, and for connecting 
Internet devices to one another, is called Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a personal connectivity 
technology that enables links between mobile devices and connectivity to the Internet 
(Bluetooth.com, 2015). Bluetooth is the universal cable cutter, promising to get rid of the 
tangled mess of wires, cradles, and special attachments that plague the current world 
of personal computing. With Bluetooth, users can wear a wireless earbud, share files in 
a hallway or conference room, synchronize their smartphone with their laptop without 
a cable, send a document to a printer, and even pay a restaurant bill from the table to a 
Bluetooth-equipped cash register. Bluetooth is also an unregulated media operating in 
the 2.4 GHz spectrum but with a very limited range of 30 feet or less. It uses a frequency 
hopping signal with up to 1,600 hops per second over 79 frequencies, giving it good 
protection from interference and interception. Bluetooth-equipped devices constantly 
scan their environments looking for connections to compatible devices. Today, almost 
all mobile devices are Bluetooth-enabled. Bluetooth may also play a role in the future 
as a platform for the Internet of Things (see page 137).
INTERNET ACCESS DRONES
A new method of providing Internet access to areas that are not well served by wired or 
cellular networks is being explored by companies such as Google and Facebook. Both 
companies have recently purchased companies that make drones (unmanned aircraft/
satellites) that may be used to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world.
In April 2014, Google purchased Titan Aerospace, which makes solar-powered 
drones that can fly for several years at 65,000 feet. In October 2015, Google filed paper-
work with the Federal Aviation Administration covering two drones from Project Titan. 
Google is also experimenting with high-altitude balloons with its Project Loon. Google 
envisions a network of balloons circling high above the earth in the stratosphere, estab-
lishing a ring of uninterrupted connectivity. A pilot test of the concept was conducted 
over New Zealand in 2013, and in 2014, Google sent a prototype of a networked hot-air 
balloon around the world in 22 days, even taking photos for its Street View program, 
and in July 2015, the government of Sri Lanka announced that Sri Lanka would be the 
first country to use Project Loon to provide universal Internet access across Sri Lanka.
In a similar effort, Facebook has put together the Facebook Connectivity Lab, where 
engineers will focus on solar-powered drones, satellites, and infrared lasers capable of 
providing Internet access. To propel that effort, Facebook has purchased the British 
company Ascenta, whose founders helped create the world’s longest flying solar-powered 
drone. In July 2015, Facebook announced that a prototype of its first Internet access 
solar-powered drone, Aquila, was complete and ready for testing. Created from carbon 
fiber, the drone has the wingspan of a Boeing 737 but weighs less than a small car, and 
is designed to fly at 60,000 to 90,000 feet for up to three months at a time. It reportedly 
uses a laser communications system that can beam data from the sky.

First-mile enhancements created by fiber-optic networks will enhance reliability and 
quality of Internet transmissions and create new business models and opportunities. 
Some of the major benefits of these technological advancements include latency solu-
tions, guaranteed service levels, lower error rates, and declining costs. Widespread 
wireless access to the Internet will also essentially double or even triple the size of 
the online shopping marketspace because consumers will be able to shop and make 
purchases just about anywhere. We describe some of these benefits in more detail in 
the following sections.
Latency Solutions
One of the challenges of packet switching, where data is divided into chunks and then 
sent separately to meet again at the destination, is that the Internet does not differenti-
ate between high-priority packets, such as video clips, and those of lower priority, such 
as self-contained e-mail messages. Because the packets cannot yet be simultaneously 
reassembled, the result can be distorted audio and video streams.
Differentiated quality of service (diffserv) is a technology that assigns levels 
of priority to packets based on the type of data being transmitted. Video conference 
packets, for example, which need to reach their destination almost instantaneously, 
receive much higher priority than e-mail messages. In the end, the quality of video 
and audio will skyrocket without undue stress on the network. Differential service is 
very controversial because it means some users may get more bandwidth than others, 
and potentially they may have to pay a higher price for more bandwidth.
Guaranteed Service Levels and Lower Error Rates
In today’s Internet, there is no service-level guarantee and no way to purchase the 
right to move data through the Internet at a fixed pace. Today’s Internet promises only 
“best effort.” The Internet is democratic—it speeds or slows everyone’s traffic alike. In 
the future, it might be possible to purchase the right to move data through the network 
at a guaranteed speed in return for higher fees.
Declining Costs
As the Internet pipeline is upgraded, the availability of broadband service will expand 
beyond major metropolitan areas, significantly reducing the cost of access. More users 
mean lower cost, as products and technology catch on in the mass market. Higher 
volume usage enables providers to lower the cost of both access devices, or clients, and 
the service required to use such products. Both broadband and wireless service fees 
are expected to decline as geographic service areas increase, in part due to competition 
for that business.
The Internet of Things
No discussion of the future Internet would be complete without mentioning the 
Internet of Things (IoT), also sometimes referred to as the Industrial Internet. 
Internet technology is spreading beyond the desktop, laptop, and tablet computer, and

beyond the smartphone, to consumer electronics, electrical appliances, cars, medical 
devices, utility systems, machines of all types, even clothing—just about anything that 
can be equipped with sensors that can collect data and connect to the Internet, 
enabling the data to be analyzed with data analytics software.
IoT builds on a foundation of existing technologies, such as RFID, and is being 
enabled by the availability of low-cost sensors, the drop in price of data storage, the 
development of “Big Data” analytics software that can work with trillions of pieces 
of data, as well as implementation of IPv6, which will allow Internet addresses to be 
assigned to all of these new devices. Although IoT devices don’t necessarily have to 
be wireless, most use wireless communications technology previously discussed, such 
as cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless protocols such as ZigBee or 
Z-Wave, to connect either directly or via a mobile app to the Internet (often a cloud 
service).
IoT technology is powering the development of “smart” connected “things”— 
televisions, houses, and cars, as well as wearable technology—clothing and devices 
like the Apple Watch. Smart televisions that integrate the Internet directly into the 
set and can run apps have become very popular, with 45% of TVs sold in the United 
States in the second quarter of 2015 being smart, and 50% of U.S. homes with Internet 
access now owning a connected TV device (NPD, 2015). Smart houses have attracted 
even more interest, fueled by Google’s purchase of Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014. 
Nest Labs makes smart thermostats, home security cameras, and smoke and carbon 
monoxide alarms. In October 2015, Nest Labs announced that it was making Nest 
Weave, a protocol it had developed that enables appliances, thermostats, door locks, 
and other devices to communicate with each other and other Nest products, avail-
able to third-party developers and manufacturers. Apple announced a smart home 
platform that it calls HomeKit in June 2014. HomeKit is a framework and network 
protocol for controlling devices in the home that is programmed directly into Apple’s 
iOS software for iPhones and iPads, and is integrated with Siri, Apple’s voice-activiated 
artificial intelligence assistant. By October 2015, a number of devices were designed 
specifically for use with HomeKit, such as a smart thermostat, a smart deadbolt lock, 
a home sensor that provides temperature, humidity, and air quality readings, and an 
iDevices switch that enables you to turn electronic devices on and off using Siri. Many 
cable companies such as Time Warner Cable, Comcast, and AT&T already offer con-
nected home systems that include appliances and lights. All in all, the global market 
for smart house products was valued at about €18 billion in 2014, and is expected to 
grow to over €53 billion by 2020.
In September 2014, Apple introduced the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch features a 
fitness/activity tracker similar to offerings from Fitbit, Nike+, FuelBand, and Jawbone 
Up, is able to access a wide variety of apps, and also works with Apple Pay, Apple’s 
mobile payment service. A number of other manufacturers, such as Samsung, LG, 
Motorola, and Swatch, also introduced smartwatches in 2014. Wearable computing is 
expected to grow into a €31 billion business worldwide by 2020.
Connected cars that have built-in Internet access have also arrived. Here too, 
Google and Apple are major players. In January 2014, Google announced the Open

Automotive Alliance, a group of leading automakers and technology companies focused 
on bringing the Android platform to cars. In March 2014, Apple announced CarPlay, a 
software platform that synchronizes iPhones to the car’s infotainment system. Android 
Auto and CarPlay-enabled vehicles began to be introduced in 2015, and will become 
more widely available in 2016, when GM plans to make both available as an option on 
all models. Connected cars are likely to be integrated with smart home initiatives in 
the future. Already, iControl, which provides the software underlying automated home 
systems from Comcast, TimeWarner, ADT, and others, has entered into a partnership 
with Zubie, a provider of connected car services.
Despite all of the IoT activity, however, interoperability remains a major 
concern. As with many technologies in the early stages of development, many 
organizations are fighting to create the standards that participants in the market 
will follow. The AllSeen Alliance, formed by Qualcomm in December 2013 with 50 
other companies, including Microsoft and Cisco, is one group that hopes to create 
an open source standard. Membership in the Alliance has soared by over 650% since 
its initial founding. Another group, the Open Interconnect Consortium, formed by 
Intel, Broadcom, Dell, and others apparently not happy with the AllSeen effort, 
formed in July 2014, and has also seen its membership soar to over 100 members. 
A different group, the Industrial Internet Consortium, has been formed by AT&T, 
Cisco, GE, IBM, and Intel to focus on engineering standards for industrial assets. 
The Wolfram Connected Devices Project is aimed at developing a database of IoT 
devices, and currently includes more than 2,000. And as with many other types of 
Internet-related technology, Google with its Android operating system and Apple 
with AirPlay wireless streaming protocol may be trying to create their own standards.
Other concerns include security and privacy. Security experts believe that IoT 
devices could potentially be a security disaster, with the potential for malware being 
spread through a connected network, and difficulty in issuing patches to devices, 
leaving them vulnerable (Internet Society, 2015). Data from stand-alone smart devices 
can reveal much personal detail about a consumer’s life, and if those devices are all 
ultimately interconnected, there will be little that is truly private.
Although challenges remain before the Internet of Things is fully realized, it is 
coming closer and closer to fruition, with some experts projecting as many as 100 
billion connected IoT devices and global economic impact of more than €10 trillion 
by 2025 (Internet Society, 2015).

THE WEB
Without the Web, there would be no e-commerce. The invention of the Web brought an 
extraordinary expansion of digital services to millions of amateur computer users, includ-
ing color text and pages, formatted text, pictures, animations, video, and sound. In short, 
the Web makes nearly all the rich elements of human expression needed to establish a 
commercial marketplace available to nontechnical computer users worldwide.

C H A P T E R  2     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e
While the Internet was born in the 1960s, the Web was not invented until 1989–
1991 by Dr. Tim Berners-Lee of the European Particle Physics Laboratory, better 
known as CERN (Berners-Lee et al., 1994). Several earlier authors—such as Vannevar 
Bush (in 1945) and Ted Nelson (in the 1960s)—had suggested the possibility of organiz-
ing knowledge as a set of interconnected pages that users could freely browse (Bush, 
1945; Ziff Davis Publishing, 1998). Berners-Lee and his associates at CERN built on 
these ideas and developed the initial versions of HTML, HTTP, a Web server, and a 
browser, the four essential components of the Web.
First, Berners-Lee wrote a computer program that allowed formatted pages within 
his own computer to be linked using keywords (hyperlinks). Clicking on a keyword in 
a document would immediately move him to another document. Berners-Lee created 
the pages using a modified version of a powerful text markup language called Standard 
Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
Berners-Lee called this language HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. He 
then came up with the idea of storing his HTML pages on the Internet. Remote client 
computers could access these pages by using HTTP (introduced earlier in Section 2.1 
and described more fully in the next section). But these early Web pages still appeared 
as black and white text pages with hyperlinks expressed inside brackets. The early 
Web was based on text only; the original Web browser only provided a line interface.
Information being shared on the Web remained text-based until 1993, when Marc 
Andreessen and others at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) 
at the University of Illinois created a Web browser with a graphical user interface (GUI) 
called Mosaic that made it possible to view documents on the Web graphically—using 
colored backgrounds, images, and even primitive animations. Mosaic was a software 
program that could run on any graphically based interface such as Macintosh, 
Windows, or Unix. The Mosaic browser software read the HTML text on a Web page 
and displayed it as a graphical interface document within a GUI operating system such 
as Windows or Macintosh. Liberated from simple black and white text pages, HTML 
pages could now be viewed by anyone in the world who could operate a mouse and 
use a Macintosh or PC.
Aside from making the content of Web pages colorful and available to the world’s 
population, the graphical Web browser created the possibility of universal comput-
ing, the sharing of files, information, graphics, sound, video, and other objects across 
all computer platforms in the world, regardless of operating system. A browser could 
be made for each of the major operating systems, and the Web pages created for one 
system, say, Windows, would also be displayed exactly the same, or nearly the same, 
on computers running the Macintosh or Unix operating systems. As long as each 
operating system had a Mosaic browser, the same Web pages could be used on all the 
different types of computers and operating systems. This meant that no matter what 
kind of computer you used, anywhere in the world, you would see the same Web 
pages. The browser and the Web have introduced us to a whole new world of comput-
ing and information management that was unthinkable prior to 1993.
In 1994, Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape, which created the first 
commercial browser, Netscape Navigator. Although Mosaic had been distributed free 
of charge, Netscape initially charged for its software. In August 1995, Microsoft

Corporation released its own free version of a browser, called Internet Explorer. In 
the ensuing years, Netscape fell from a 100% market share to less than .5% in 2009. 
The fate of Netscape illustrates an important e-commerce business lesson. Innovators 
usually are not long-term winners, whereas smart followers often have the assets 
needed for long-term survival. Much of the Netscape browser code survives today in 
the Firefox browser produced by Mozilla, a nonprofit heavily funded by Google.
HYPERTEXT
Web pages can be accessed through the Internet because the Web browser software 
on your PC can request Web pages stored on an Internet host server using the HTTP 
protocol. Hypertext is a way of formatting pages with embedded links that connect 
documents to one another and that also link pages to other objects such as sound, 
video, or animation files. When you click on a graphic and a video clip plays, you have 
clicked on a hyperlink. For example, when you type a Web address in your browser 
such as http://www.sec.gov, your browser sends an HTTP request to the sec.gov server 
requesting the home page of sec.gov.
HTTP is the first set of letters at the start of every Web address, followed by the 
domain name. The domain name specifies the organization’s server computer that 
is housing the document. Most companies have a domain name that is the same as 
or closely related to their official corporate name. The directory path and document 
name are two more pieces of information within the Web address that help the browser 
track down the requested page. Together, the address is called a Uniform Resource 
Locator, or URL. When typed into a browser, a URL tells it exactly where to look for 
the information. For example, in the following URL:
http://www.megacorp.com/content/features/082602.html
http = the protocol used to display Web pages
www.megacorp.com = domain name
content/features = the directory path that identifies where on the domain Web 
server the page is stored
082602.html = the document name and its format (an HTML page)
The most common domain extensions (known as general top-level domains, or 
gTLDs) currently available and officially sanctioned by ICANN are shown in Table 
2.14. Countries also have domain names, such as .uk, .au, and .fr (United Kingdom, 
Australia, and France, respectively). These are sometimes referred to as country-
code top-level domains, or ccTLDs. In 2008, ICANN approved a significant expansion 
of gTLDs, with potential new domains representing cities (such as .berlin), regions 
(.africa), ethnicity (.eus), industry/activities (such as .health), and even brands (such 
as .deloitte). In 2009, ICANN began the process of implementing these guidelines. 
In 2011, ICANN removed nearly all restrictions on domain names, thereby greatly 
expanding the number of different domain names available. As of October 2015, 
about 765 gTLDs have been applied for, acquired, and launched, and another 575

HTML is a text markup language used to create Web pages. It has a fixed set of “tags” that are used to tell the browser software how to

characters (including Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian) and include geographic 
place names such as .nyc, .london, and .paris; business identifiers such as .restaurant, 
.realtor, .technology, and .lawyer; brand names such as .bmw and .suzuki; and a whole 
host of other descriptive names.
MARKUP LANGUAGES
Although the most common Web page formatting language is HTML, the concept 
behind document formatting actually had its roots in the 1960s with the development 
of Generalized Markup Language (GML).
HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a GML that is relatively easy to use. HTML 
provides Web page designers with a fixed set of markup “tags” that are used to format 
a Web page (see Figure 2.15). When these tags are inserted into a Web page, they are 
read by the browser and interpreted into a page display. You can see the source HTML 
code for any Web page by simply clicking on the “Page Source” command found in all 
browsers. In Figure 2.15, the HTML code in the first screen produces the display in 
the second screen.
HTML defines the structure and style of a document, including the headings, 
graphic positioning, tables, and text formatting. Since its introduction, the major

browsers have continuously added features to HTML to enable programmers to further 
refine their page layouts. Unfortunately, some browser enhancements may work only 
in one company’s browser. Whenever you build an e-commerce site, you should take 
care that the pages can be viewed by the major browsers, even outdated versions of 
browsers. HTML Web pages can be created with any text editor, such as Notepad or 
WordPad, using Microsoft Word (simply save the Word document as a Web page), or 
any one of several Web page development tools such as Microsoft Expression Web or 
Adobe Dreamweaver CC.5
The most recent version of HTML is HTML5. HTML5 introduces features like 
video playback and drag-and-drop that in the past were provided by plug-ins like Adobe 
Flash. HTML5 is also used in the development of mobile Web sites and mobile apps, 
and is an important tool in both responsive Web design and adaptive Web delivery, all 
of which are discussed more fully in Chapter 3. The Insight on Technology case, The 
Rise of HTML5, examines the increasing use of HTML5.
eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) takes Web document formatting a giant leap 
forward. XML is a markup language specification developed by the W3C that is similar 
to HTML, but has a very different purpose. Whereas the purpose of HTML is to control 
the “look and feel” and display of data on the Web page, XML is designed to describe 
data and information. For example, consider the sample XML document in Figure 
2.16. The first line in the sample document is the XML declaration, which is always 
included; it defines the XML version of the document. In this case, the document 
conforms to the 1.0 specification of XML. The next line defines the first element of 
the document (the root element): <note>. The next four lines define four child ele-
ments of the root (to, from, heading, and body). The last line defines the end of the 
root element. Notice that XML says nothing about how to display the data, or how the 
text should look on the screen. HTML is used for information display in combination 
with XML, which is used for data description.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THE RISE OF HTML5
In 2010, Apple founder Steve Jobs 
lambasted Adobe Flash for its poor 
security, its poor performance on 
mobile devices, and for being an energy 
hog. Jobs instead trumpeted HTML5 as 
the preferred method for displaying video online. 
Flash forward to 2015. A year after its official 
ratification by the W3C, the Web’s standards-
setting organization, HTML5 has become a de 
facto standard, proving once again Jobs’ uncanny 
ability to see and perhaps shape the future.
HTML5 has become a catch-all term that 
encompasses not only the video element but also 
the use of the newest versions of Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS3) and Java­Script, and another new 
tool, HTML5 Canvas. Also intended to replace 
plug-ins, it is used with a set of JavaScript functions 
to render simple animations, which reduces page 
load time. Multi-platform Web developers began 
using HTML5 because these new elements provided 
device independence, but soon discovered that they 
could do even more. The built-in functionality of 
mobile devices, including GPS and swiping, can be 
accessed, enabling m-commerce sites to build Web-
based mobile apps that can replicate the native app 
experience. Web-based mobile apps (HTML5 apps) 
work just like Web pages. When a user navigates 
to the page containing the mobile app, the page 
content, including graphics, images, and video, are 
loaded into the browser from the Web server, rather 
than residing in the mobile device hardware like 
a native app. This concept has been embraced by 
mobile developers, who naturally dream of being 
able to reach all platforms with a single product.
For businesses, the cost savings of HTML5 
are obvious. A single HTML5 app requires far less 
effort to build than multiple native apps for the 
iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and other platforms. 
HTML5 apps can more easily be linked to and 
shared on social networks, encouraging viral dis-
tribution. Some HTML5 apps can even be designed 
so that they can be run on mobile devices when they 
are offline. Differences in how apps run across dif-
ferent platforms and workarounds are eliminated. 
It used to be the case that HTML5 apps couldn’t 
approach the smooth and speedy user experience 
of a native app, but thanks to many advancements 
in the underlying technologies behind HTML5 and 
improvements in the expertise of HTML5 develop-
ers, that is no longer the case. And plug-ins like 
Flash require installation, whereas HTML5 does 
not.
In 2014, the Interactive Advertising Bureau 
(IAB), together with a number of the largest pub-
lishers and advertising firms, urged advertisers 
to implement HTML5 as the standard for mobile 
ads in order to guarantee that ads will run and 
look good on different platforms, and in 2015 
released guidelines that fully embrace HTML5, 
citing interoperability and the improved effec-
tiveness of HTML5 ads. The rise of HTML5 has 
mirrored the growth of the mobile platform as 
it supplants Flash, which was developed for the 
desktop, as the preferred media delivery platform 
on the Web. In 2015, the number of Flash vulner-
abilities reported nearly doubled to 133 from just 
over 70 in the previous year. Many of the Web’s 
most prominent advertisers responded accordingly. 
In 2015, Facebook announced it would introduce 
HTML5 capability to its News Feed, and Google 
signaled a shift towards HTML5 by blocking Flash 
advertisements from autoplaying in Chrome, in part 
due to their notorious security issues. Mozilla fol-
lowed suit with Firefox, meaning that over 80% 
of the Web browser market is now blocking Flash. 
Amazon also switched to HTML5-only promos in 

146	
	
C H A P T E R  2     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e
2015. The moves from these advertising and 
tech juggernauts have solidified the downfall 
of Flash and the rise of HTML5 as the future 
of advertising.
Retailers have taken notice. In 2015, almost 
50% of Internet Retailer’s top 500 mobile retailers 
use HTML5 for their smartphone or tablet mobile 
sites. One example of a company using HTML5 
with success is Rakuten Shopping, an online retailer 
that offers a wide variety of goods online, and is 
currently ranked as one of Internet Retailer’s top 
30 mobile retailers in 2015. Using HTML5 has 
enabled Rakuten to shift away from using cook-
ies to store customer attributes and has lightened 
the load on its servers, which are receiving fewer 
calls from mobile devices because once content 
is downloaded, it is stored locally in the device’s 
browser. HTML5’s video tag has also enabled 
Rakuten to embed video within HTML pages on 
a mobile device.
Another example is the Financial Times, whose 
HTML5 app has proven to be an important driver 
for FT’s business. FT first switched from a native 
app to HTML5 in 2011, in part to make maintain-
ing the app across multiple platforms and devices 
easier. In 2013, FT rolled out a redesign of the 
app, featuring even more videos and personal-
ization features. FT’s managing director, Robert 
Grimshaw, believes that those who have chosen to 
develop native apps in parallel will struggle with 
the overhead of maintaining and developing them.
In fact, according to Indeed, which searches 
millions of jobs from thousands of different job 
sites, “HTML5” continues to be one of the fastest-
growing keywords found in online job postings 
in 2015, ahead of iOS and Android. As a result, 
HTML5 projects typically take longer to develop 
than planned, according to a Forrester survey.
According to Tim Berners-Lee, founder and 
chief of the W3C, and an ardent opponent of 
native apps because they remove functionality 
from the Web, HTML5 security and access control 
issues are currently being addressed. For instance, 
HTML5 has not consistently supported digital 
rights management (DRM). In the past, media 
companies developed their own copy protection 
standards based on geographical region and/or 
whether payment had been proffered. These were 
enforced through their own media players. Because 
HTML5 does not require plug-ins to play video (or 
audio), and further, because HTML5 is an official 
W3C standard charged with remaining vendor 
neutral, this presents a challenge to the HTML5 
working group. HTML5 also allows Web sites to 
track how much battery power their site visitors 
have remaining. This feature was implemented so 
that sites could warn users to recharge their bat-
tery, but the reporting is so detailed that sites can 
determine what sites you’ve come from last solely 
based on your battery information. However, the 
security issues with HTML5 pale in comparison to 
those associated with Flash, and it’s still early in 
the development cycle for HTML5.
Although HTML5 is being widely adopted on 
e-commerce and m-commerce sites, native apps 
aren’t going anywhere. Instead, many developers 
are incorporating HTML5 code into native apps, 
creating a kind of hybrid or mixed mode app. 
Gartner expects that more than 50% of mobile 
applications will be hybrid by 2016.

Figure 2.17 shows how XML can be used to define a database of company names 
in a company directory. Tags such as <Company>, <Name>, and <Specialty> can 
be defined for a single firm, or an entire industry. On an elementary level, XML is 
extraordinarily easy to learn and is very similar to HTML except that you can make 
up your own tags. At a deeper level, XML has a rich syntax and an enormous set of 
software tools, which make XML ideal for storing and communicating many types of 
data on the Web.
XML is “extensible,” which means the tags used to describe and display data are 
defined by the user, whereas in HTML the tags are limited and predefined. XML can 
also transform information into new formats, such as by importing information from 
a database and displaying it as a table. With XML, information can be analyzed and 
displayed selectively, making it a more powerful alternative to HTML. This means 
that business firms, or entire industries, can describe all of their invoices, accounts 
payable, payroll records, and financial information using a Web-compatible markup 
language. Once described, these business documents can be stored on intranet Web 
servers and shared throughout the corporation.
WEB SERVERS AND CLIENTS
We have already described client/server computing and the revolution in computing 
architecture brought about by client/server computing. You already know that a server 
is a computer attached to a network that stores files, controls peripheral devices,

for other computers on the network.
But what is a Web server? Web server software refers to the software that enables 
a computer to deliver Web pages written in HTML to client computers on a network that 
request this service by sending an HTTP request. Apache, which works with Linux and 
Unix operating systems, is the most commonly used type of Web server software. Micro-
soft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) also has significant market share (Netcraft, 2015).
Aside from responding to requests for Web pages, all Web servers provide some 
additional basic capabilities such as the following:
•	 Security services—These consist mainly of authentication services that verify that 
the person trying to access the site is authorized to do so. For Web sites that process 
payment transactions, the Web server also supports SSL and TLS, the protocols for 
transmitting and receiving information securely over the Internet. When private 
information such as names, phone numbers, addresses, and credit card data needs 
to be provided to a Web site, the Web server uses SSL to ensure that the data passing 
back and forth from the browser to the server is not compromised.
•	 FTP—This protocol allows users to transfer files to and from the server. Some sites 
limit file uploads to the Web server, while others restrict downloads, depending on 
the user’s identity.
•	 Search engine—Just as search engine sites enable users to search the entire Web 
for particular documents, search engine modules within the basic Web server soft-
ware package enable indexing of the site’s Web pages and content and permit easy 
keyword searching of the site’s content. When conducting a search, a search engine 
makes use of an index, which is a list of all the documents on the server. The search 
term is compared to the index to identify likely matches.
•	 Data capture—Web servers are also helpful at monitoring site traffic, capturing 
information on who has visited a site, how long the user stayed there, the date 
and time of each visit, and which specific pages on the server were accessed. This 
information is compiled and saved in a log file, which can then be analyzed. By 
analyzing a log file, a site manager can find out the total number of visitors, the 
average length of each visit, and the most popular destinations, or Web pages.
The term Web server is also used to refer to the physical computer that runs Web 
server software. Leading manufacturers of Web server computers include Lenovo, Dell, 
and Hewlett-Packard. Although any desktop computer can run Web server software, 
it is best to use a computer that has been optimized for this purpose. To be a Web 
server, a computer must have the Web server software installed and be connected 
to the Internet. Every public Web server computer has an IP address. For example, 
if you type http://www.pearsonhighered.com/laudon in your browser, the browser 
software sends a request for HTTP service to the Web server whose domain name is 
pearsonhighered.com. The server then locates the page named “laudon” on its hard 
drive, sends the page back to your browser, and displays it on your screen. Of course, 
firms also can use Web servers for strictly internal local area networking in intranets.
Aside from the generic Web server software packages, there are actually many types 
of specialized servers on the Web, from database servers that access specific information 
within a database, to ad servers that deliver targeted banner ads, to mail servers that

provide e-mail messages, and video servers that provide video clips. At a small e-com-
merce site, all of these software packages might be running on a single computer, with a 
single processor. At a large corporate site, there may be hundreds or thousands of discrete 
server computers, many with multiple processors, running specialized Web server func-
tions. We discuss the architecture of e-commerce sites in greater detail in Chapter 3.
A Web client, on the other hand, is any computing device attached to the 
Internet that is capable of making HTTP requests and displaying HTML pages. The 
most common client is a Windows or Macintosh desktop computer, with various 
flavors of Unix/Linux computers a distant third. However, the fastest growing cat-
egory of Web clients is not computers at all, but mobile devices. In general, a Web 
client can be any device—including a printer, refrigerator, stove, home lighting 
system, or automobile instrument panel—capable of sending and receiving informa-
tion from a Web server.
WEB BROWSERS
A Web browser is a software program whose primary purpose is to display Web pages. 
Browsers also have added features, such as e-mail and newsgroups (an online discussion 
group or forum). As of September 2015, the leading Web browser remains Microsoft 
Internet Explorer, with about 52% of the market. The second most popular browser, with 
about a 30% market share, is Google’s Chrome, a small, yet technologically advanced 
open source browser. Mozilla Firefox has dropped to third place, with only about 11.5% 
of the U.S. Web browser market. First released in 2004, Firefox is a free, open source Web 
browser for the Windows, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems, based on Mozilla 
open source code (which originally provided the code for Netscape). It is small and fast 
and offers many features such as pop-up blocking and tabbed browsing. Apple’s Safari 
browser is fourth, with about 5% of the market (Marketshare.hitslink.com, 2015). In July 
2015, Microsoft introduced Edge, an entirely new browser bundled with its new operating 
system, Windows 10. Edge is designed to replace Internet Explorer. However, despite the 
popularity of Windows 10 (it has already been installed on 110 million devices as of 
October 2015), Edge has thus far been largely ignored by Windows 10 adopters. Instead, 
Chrome is the dominant browser on Windows 10 (Keizer, 2015).

THE INTERNET AND THE WEB: FEATURES AND 
SERVICES
The Internet and the Web have spawned a number of powerful software applications 
upon which the foundations of e-commerce are built. You can think of all these as 
Web services, and it is interesting as you read along to compare these services to other 
traditional media such as television or print media. If you do, you will quickly realize 
the richness of the Internet environment.
E-MAIL
Since its earliest days, electronic mail, or e-mail, has been the most-used application 
of the Internet. Worldwide, there are an estimated 4.4 billion e-mail accounts, sending

an estimated 205 billion e-mails a day. There are an estimated 1.4 billion mobile e-mail 
users worldwide, and their number is expected to almost double, to 2.5 billion, by 2019 
(Radicati Group, 2015). Estimates vary on the amount of spam, ranging from 40% to 
90%. E-mail marketing and spam are examined in more depth in Chapter 6.
E-mail uses a series of protocols to enable messages containing text, images, sound, 
and video clips to be transferred from one Internet user to another. Because of its flexibil-
ity and speed, it is now the most popular form of business communication—more 
popular than the phone, fax, or snail mail (the U.S. Postal Service). In addition to text 
typed within the message, e-mail also allows attachments, which are files inserted 
within the e-mail message. The files can be documents, images, sounds, or video clips.
INSTANT MESSAGING
Instant messaging (IM) allows you to send messages in real time, one line at a time, 
unlike e-mail. E-mail messages have a time lag of several seconds to minutes between 
when messages are sent and received. IM displays lines of text entered on a computer 
almost instantaneously. Recipients can then respond immediately to the sender the 
same way, making the communication more like a live conversation than is possible 
through e-mail. To use IM, users create a buddy list they want to communicate with, 
and then enter short text messages that their buddies will receive instantly (if they 
are online at the time). And although text remains the primary communication mecha-
nism in IM, more advanced systems also provide voice and video chat functionality. 
Instant messaging over the Internet competes with cell phone Short Message Service 
(SMS) texting, which is far more expensive than IM.
The major IM systems are Skype, Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, and AIM (AOL 
Instant Messenger). Facebook also offers instant messaging services via Facebook 
Chat. IM systems were initially developed as proprietary systems, with competing 
firms offering versions that did not work with one another. Today, there still is no 
built-in interoperability among the major IM systems. Mobile messaging apps, such 
as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp (purchased by Facebook for $22 billion in 2014), 
Snapchat (which allows users to send pictures, videos, and texts that will disappear 
after a short period of time), Viber, and others are also becoming very popular, pro-
viding competition for both traditional desktop IM systems and SMS text messaging.
SEARCH ENGINES
Search engines identify Web pages that appear to match keywords, also called queries, 
entered by a user and then provide a list of the best matches (search results). Almost 
85% of U.S. Internet users regularly use search engines from either desktop or mobile 
devices, and they generate around 18 billion queries a month (eMarketer, Inc., 2015g). 
There are hundreds of different search engines, but in the United States, the vast 
majority of the search results are supplied by the top five providers (see Figure 2.18). 
Google, Bing, Ask and Yahoo are also major search providers in Europe. Other  Euro-
pean search providers include T-Online (Germany), Qwant (France) and the anony-
mous search engine Unbubble. In China, Baidu, Qihoo 360, Sohu Sogou and Tencent 
Soso are major search engine providers.
Web search engines started out in the early 1990s shortly after Netscape released 
the first commercial Web browser. Early search engines were relatively simple software

programs that roamed the nascent Web, visiting pages and gathering information about 
the content of each Web page. These early programs were called variously crawlers, 
spiders, and wanderers; the first full-text crawler that indexed the contents of an entire 
Web page was called WebCrawler, released in 1994. AltaVista (1995), one of the first 
widely used search engines, was the first to allow “natural language” queries such as 
“history of Web search engines” rather than “history + Web + search engine.”
The first search engines employed simple keyword indexes of all the Web pages 
visited. They would count the number of times a word appeared on the Web page, and 
store this information in an index. These search engines could be easily fooled by Web 
designers who simply repeated words on their home pages. The real innovations in 
search engine development occurred through a program funded by the Department 
of Defense called the Digital Library Initiative, designed to help the Pentagon find 
research papers in large databases. Stanford, Berkeley, and three other universities 
became hotbeds of Web search innovations in the mid-1990s. At Stanford in 1994, two 
computer science students, David Filo and Jerry Yang, created a hand-selected list 
of their favorite Web pages and called it “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,” 
or Yahoo!. Yahoo initially was not a real search engine, but rather an edited selection 
of Web sites organized by categories the editors found useful. Yahoo later developed 
“true” search engine capabilities.

C H A P T E R  2     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e
In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford computer science students, 
released their first version of the Google search engine. This search engine was dif-
ferent: not only did it index each Web page’s words, but Page had discovered that the 
AltaVista search engine not only collected keywords from sites but also calculated what 
other sites linked to each page. By looking at the URLs on each Web page, they could 
calculate an index of popularity. AltaVista did nothing with this information. Page took 
this idea and made it a central factor in ranking a Web page’s appropriateness to a 
search query. He patented the idea of a Web page ranking system (PageRank System), 
which essentially measures the popularity of the Web page. Brin contributed a unique 
Web crawler program that indexed not just keywords on a Web page, but combina-
tions of words (such as authors and their article titles). These two ideas became the 
foundation for the Google search engine (Brandt, 2004). Figure 2.19 illustrates how 
Google works.
Initially, few understood how to make money from search engines. That changed 
in 2000 when Goto.com (later Overture) allowed advertisers to bid for placement 
on their search engine results, and Google followed suit in 2003 with its AdWords 
program, which allowed advertisers to bid for placement of short text ads on Google 
search results. The spectacular increase in Internet advertising revenues (which have 
been growing at around 20%–25% annually over the last few years) has helped search 
engines transform themselves into major shopping tools and created an entire new 
industry called “search engine marketing.”
	 FIGURE 2.19	
HOW GOOGLE WORKS
The Google search engine is continuously crawling the Web, indexing the content of each page, calculating 
its popularity, and caching the pages so that it can respond quickly to your request to see a page. The entire 
process takes about one-half of a second.

When users enter a search term at Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any of the other Web 
sites serviced by these search engines, they receive two types of listings: sponsored 
links, for which advertisers have paid to be listed (usually at the top of the search 
results page), and unsponsored “organic” search results. Advertisers can also purchase 
small text ads on the right side of the search results page. In addition, search engines 
have extended their services to include news, maps, satellite images, computer images, 
e-mail, group calendars, group meeting tools, and indexes of scholarly papers.
Although the major search engines are used for locating general information of 
interest to users, search engines have also become a crucial tool within e-commerce 
sites. Customers can more easily search for the product information they want with 
the help of an internal search program; the difference is that within Web sites, the 
search engine is limited to finding matches from that one site. For instance, more 
online shoppers use Amazon’s internal search engine to look for products than con-
ducting a product search using Google, a fact noted by Google’s executive chairman 
Eric Schmidt, who believes that Amazon search poses a significant threat to Google 
(Mangalindan, 2014).
ONLINE FORUMS
An online forum (also referred to as a message board, bulletin board, discussion 
board, discussion group, or simply a board or forum) is a Web application that 
enables Internet users to communicate with each other, although not in real time. 
A forum provides a container for various discussions (or “threads”) started (or 
“posted”) by members of the forum, and depending on the permissions granted to 
forum members by the forum’s administrator, enables a person to start a thread and 
reply to other people’s threads. Most forum software allows more than one forum to 
be created. The forum administrator typically can edit, delete, move, or otherwise 
modify any thread on the forum. Unlike an electronic mailing list (such as a listserv), 
which automatically sends new messages to a subscriber, an online forum typically 
requires that the member visit the forum to check for new posts. Some forums offer 
an “e-mail notification” feature that notifies users that a new post of interest to them 
has been made.
STREAMING MEDIA
Streaming media enables live Web video, music, video, and other large-bandwidth 
files to be sent to users in a variety of ways that enable the user to play back the files. 
In some situations, such as live Web video, the files are broken into chunks and served 
by specialized video servers to users in chunks. Client software puts the chunks 
together and plays the video. In other situations, such as YouTube, a single large file 
is downloaded from a standard Web server to users who can begin playing the video 
before the entire file is downloaded. Streamed files must be viewed “live;” they cannot 
be stored on client hard drives without special software. Streamed files are “played” 
by a software program such as Windows Media Player, Apple QuickTime, Adobe Flash, 
and RealMedia Player. There are a number of tools used to create streaming files,

including HTML5 and Adobe Flash, as well as technologies specifically adapted for 
the mobile platform such as the Meerkat and Periscope apps.
Sites such as YouTube, Metacafe, and Facebook have popularized user-generated 
video streaming. Web advertisers increasingly use video to attract viewers. Streaming 
audio and video segments used in Web ads and news stories are perhaps the most 
frequently used streaming services. As the capacity of the Internet grows, streaming 
media will play an even larger role in e-commerce.
COOKIES
A cookie is a tool used by a Web site to store information about a user. When a visitor 
enters a Web site, the site sends a small text file (the cookie) to the user’s computer 
so that information from the site can be loaded more quickly on future visits. 
The cookie can contain any information desired by the Web site designers, including 
customer number, pages visited, products examined, and other detailed information 
about the behavior of the consumer at the site. Cookies are useful to consumers 
because the Web site will recognize returning patrons and not ask them to register 
again. Cookies are also used by advertisers to ensure visitors do not receive the same 
advertisements repeatedly. Cookies can also help personalize a Web site by allowing 
the site to recognize returning customers and make special offers to them based on 
their past behavior at the site. Cookies allow Web marketers to customize products 
and segment markets—the ability to change the product or the price based on prior 
consumer information (described more fully in Chapter 6). As we will discuss through-
out the book, cookies also can pose a threat to consumer privacy, and at times they 
are bothersome. Many people clear their cookies at the end of every day. Some disable 
them entirely using tools built into most browsers.
WEB 2.0 FEATURES AND SERVICES
Today’s broadband Internet infrastructure has greatly expanded the services avail-
able to users. These capabilities have formed the basis for new business models. 
Digital content and digital communications are the two areas where innovation is most 
rapid. Web 2.0 applications and services are “social” in nature because they support 
communication among individuals within groups or social networks.
Online Social Networks
Online social networks are services that support communication within networks of 
friends, colleagues, and entire professions. Online social networks have developed 
very large worldwide audiences and form the basis for new advertising platforms 
and for social e-commerce (see Chapters 6, 7, and 10). The largest social networks 
are Facebook (1.5 billion members worldwide), Instagram (400 million members 
worldwide), LinkedIn (more than 380 million members worldwide), Twitter (more 
than 315 million active users worldwide), and Pinterest (around 100 million active 
users). These networks rely on user-generated content (messages, photos, and 
cookie
a tool used by Web sites to 
store information about a 
user. When a visitor enters 
a Web site, the site sends a 
small text file (the cookie) 
to the user’s computer so 
that information from the 
site can be loaded more 
quickly on future visits. 
The cookie can contain any 
information desired by the 
site designers

videos) and emphasize sharing of content. All of these features require significant 
broadband Internet connectivity and equally large cloud computing facilities to 
store content.
Blogs
A blog (originally called a weblog) is a personal Web page that typically contains a 
series of chronological entries (newest to oldest) by its author, and links to related Web 
pages. The blog may include a blogroll (a collection of links to other blogs) and track-
backs (a list of entries in other blogs that refer to a post on the first blog). Most blogs 
allow readers to post comments on the blog entries as well. The act of creating a blog 
is often referred to as “blogging.” Blogs are either hosted by a third-party site such as 
Blogger, LiveJournal, TypePad, Xanga, WordPress, and Tumblr, or prospective bloggers 
can download software such as Movable Type to create a blog that is hosted by the 
user’s ISP. Blog pages are usually variations on templates provided by the blogging 
service or software and hence require no knowledge of HTML. Therefore, millions of 
people without HTML skills of any kind can post their own Web pages, and share 
content with friends and relatives. The totality of blog-related Web sites is often 
referred to as the “blogosphere.”
Blogs have become hugely popular. Tumblr, WordPress, and LiveJournal together 
hosted over 330 million blogs as of October 2015, so it is likely that the total number is 
significantly higher. According to eMarketer, there are an estimated 28 million active 
U.S. bloggers, and 79 million U.S. blog readers (eMarketer, Inc., 2015h; 2015i). No one 
knows how many of these blogs are kept up to date or are just yesterday’s news. And 
no one knows how many of these blogs have a readership greater than one (the blog 
author). In fact, there are so many blogs you need a search engine just to find them, 
or you can just go to a list of the most popular 100 blogs and dig in.
Really Simple Syndication (RSS)
The rise of blogs is correlated with a distribution mechanism for news and information 
from Web sites that regularly update their content. Really Simple Syndication (RSS) 
is an XML format that allows users to have digital content, including text, articles, 
blogs, and podcast audio files, automatically sent to their computers over the Internet. 
An RSS aggregator software application that you install on your computer gathers 
material from the Web sites and blogs that you tell it to scan and brings new informa-
tion from those sites to you. Sometimes this is referred to as “syndicated” content 
because it is distributed by news organizations and other syndicators (or distributors). 
Users download an RSS aggregator and then “subscribe” to the RSS “feeds.” When you 
go to your RSS aggregator’s page, it will display the most recent updates for each 
channel to which you have subscribed. RSS has rocketed from a “techie” pastime to a 
broad-based movement. Although Google has closed down Google Reader, a popular 
RSS product, a number of other RSS reader options remain, including Feedly, Reeder, 
and NewsBlur.

Podcasting
A podcast is an audio presentation—such as a radio show, audio from a movie, or 
simply a personal audio presentation—stored as an audio file and posted to the Web. 
Listeners download the files from the Web and play them on their players or comput-
ers. While commonly associated with Apple’s iPod portable music player, you can 
listen to MP3 podcast files with any MP3 player. Podcasting has transitioned from an 
amateur independent producer media in the “pirate radio” tradition to a professional 
news and talk content distribution channel. For instance, National Public Radio’s This 
American Life’s Serial podcast has been downloaded over 90 million times, and in 
October 2015, WNYC, a major public radio station, announced it would create a new 
division devoted solely to the production of podcasts.
Wikis
A wiki is a Web application that allows a user to easily add and edit content on a 
Web page. (The term wiki derives from the “wiki wiki” (quick or fast) shuttle buses 
at Honolulu Airport.) Wiki software enables documents to be written collectively 
and collaboratively. Most wiki systems are open source, server-side systems that 
store content in a relational database. The software typically provides a template 
that defines layout and elements common to all pages, displays user-editable source 
code (usually plain text), and then renders the content into an HTML-based page 
for display in a Web browser. Some wiki software allows only basic text formatting, 
whereas others allow the use of tables, images, or even interactive elements, such 
as polls and games. Because wikis by their very nature are very open in allowing 
anyone to make changes to a page, most wikis provide a means to verify the validity 
of changes via a “Recent Changes” page, which enables members of the wiki com-
munity to monitor and review the work of other users, correct mistakes, and hope-
fully deter “vandalism.”
The most well-known wiki is Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that contains 
more than 4.9 million English-language articles on a variety of topics, appears in 288 
languages, and has around 500 million unique visitors each month worldwide. The 
Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia, also operates a variety of related 
projects, including Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks 
and manuals; Wikinews, a free content news source; and Wiktionary, a collaborative 
project to produce a free multilingual dictionary in every language, with definitions, 
etymologies, pronunciations, quotations, and synonyms.
Music and Video Services
With the low-bandwidth connections of the early Internet, audio and video files were 
difficult to download and share, but with the huge growth in broadband connections, 
these files are not only commonplace but today constitute the majority of Web traffic. 
Spurred on by the worldwide sales of more than 1 billion iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, 
and iPod Touches) as of January 2015, as well as millions of other smartphones, the 
Internet has become a virtual digital river of music and video files.

The Apple iTunes store is probably the most well-known repository of digital 
music tracks online, with a catalog of more than 43 million songs in its catalog as 
of May 2015. Google Play offers over 30 million, and there are hundreds of other 
sites offering music downloads as well. In addition, streaming music services (see 
the Insight on Technology case study, Music: Battle of the Titans and Lilliputians, 
in Chapter 5) and Internet radio add to the bandwidth devoted to the delivery of 
online music.
Online video viewing has also exploded in popularity. In June 2015, for instance, 
around 193 million U.S. Internet users watched online video content via a desktop 
computer, while 100 million watched on smartphones and tablet computers (com-
Score, 2015b). Cisco estimates that consumer Internet video traffic constituted a whop-
ping 64% of all consumer Internet traffic in 2014, not including the video exchanged 
through P2P file sharing (Cisco, 2015). By far, the most common type of Internet 
video is provided by YouTube, with more than 1 billion unique visitors worldwide 
each month who watch more than 6 billion hours of video, most of it short clips taken 
from television shows, or user-generated content. The largest sources of legal, paid 
television content are the iTunes Store, where you can purchase specific episodes or 
entire seasons of TV shows, Netflix, and Hulu.
Internet advertising makes extensive use of streaming video ads. Companies that 
want to demonstrate use of their products have found video clips to be extremely 
effective. And audio reports and discussions also have become commonplace, either 
as marketing materials or customer reports.
Future digital video networks will be able to deliver better-than-broadcast-quality 
video over the Internet to computers and other devices in homes and on the road. 
High-quality interactive video and audio makes sales presentations and demonstrations 
more effective and lifelike and enables companies to develop new forms of customer 
support. The Internet has become a major distribution channel for movies, television 
shows, and sporting events (see Chapter 9).
Internet Telephony
If the telephone system were to be built from scratch today, it would be an Internet-
based, packet-switched network using TCP/IP because it would be less expensive and 
more efficient than the alternative existing system, which involves a mix of circuit-
switched legs with a digital backbone. In fact, AT&T has begun testing all-digital IP 
phone networks in several U.S. cities. Likewise, if cable television systems were built 
from scratch today, they most likely would use Internet technologies for the same 
reasons.
 IP telephony is a general term for the technologies that use Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) and the Internet’s packet-switched network to transmit voice, fax, 
and other forms of audio communication over the Internet. VoIP can be used over a 
traditional handset as well as over a mobile device. VoIP avoids the long distance 
charges imposed by traditional phone companies.
There were about 224 million residential VoIP subscribers worldwide in 2014, and 
in the United States, more than half of residential customers are now using VoIP, and

this number is expanding rapidly as cable systems provide telephone service as part of 
their “triple play”: voice, Internet, and TV as a single package. This number is dwarfed, 
however, by the number of mobile VoIP subscribers, which has grown explosively over 
the last several years, fueled by the rampant growth of mobile messaging apps that 
now also provide free VoIP services, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, 
WeChat, Line, KakaoTalk, and others (Infonetics Research, 2015; BuddeComm, 2015).
VoIP is a disruptive technology. In the past, voice and fax were the exclusive 
provenance of the regulated telephone networks. With the convergence of the Internet 
and telephony, however, this dominance is already starting to change, with local and 
long distance telephone providers and cable companies becoming ISPs, and ISPs 
getting into the phone market. Key players in the VoiP market include independent 
service providers such as VoIP pioneers Vonage and Skype (now owned by Microsoft), 
as well as traditional players such as telephone and cable companies that have moved 
aggressively into the market. Skype currently dominates the international market and 
carries 50 billion minutes (one-third of the world’s long distance traffic) each month 
(Skype for Business Team, 2015).
Video Conferencing, Video Chatting, and Telepresence
Internet video conferencing is accessible to anyone with a broadband Internet con-
nection and a Web camera (webcam). The most widely used Web conferencing suite 
of tools is WebEx (now owned by Cisco). VoIP companies such as Skype and ooVoo 
also provide more limited Web conferencing capabilities, commonly referred to as 
video chatting. Apple’s FaceTime is another video chatting technology available for 
iOS mobile devices with a forward-facing camera and Macintosh computers equipped 
with Apple’s version of a webcam, called a FaceTime camera.
Telepresence takes video conferencing up several notches. Rather than single 
persons “meeting” by using webcams, telepresence creates an environment in a room 
using multiple cameras and screens, which surround the users. The experience is 
uncanny and strange at first because as you look at the people in the screens, they are 
looking directly at you. Broadcast quality and higher screen resolutions help create the 
effect. Users have the sensation of “being in the presence of their colleagues” in a way 
that is not true for traditional webcam meetings. Providers of telepresence software 
and hardware include Cisco, HP, and Dimension Data (formerly Teliris).
Intelligent Personal Assistants
The idea of having a conversation with a computer, having it understand you and be 
able to carry out tasks according to your direction, has long been a part of science 
fiction, from the 1968 Hollywood movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, to an old Apple pro-
motional video depicting a professor using his personal digital assistant to organize 
his life, gather data, and place orders at restaurants. That was all fantasy. But Apple’s 
Siri, billed as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator and released in 
2011, has many of the capabilities of the computer assistants found in fiction. Siri has 
a natural language, conversational interface, situational awareness, and is capable of 
carrying out many tasks based on verbal commands by delegating requests to a variety

of different Web services. For instance, you can ask Siri to find a restaurant nearby that 
serves Italian food. Siri may show you an ad for a local restaurant in the process. Once 
you have identified a restaurant you would like to eat at, you can ask Siri to make a 
reservation using OpenTable. You can also ask Siri to place an appointment on your 
calendar, search for airline flights, and figure out what’s the fastest route between your 
current location and a destination using public transit. The answers are not always 
completely accurate, but critics have been impressed with its uncanny abilities. Siri is 
currently available on the Apple Watch, the iPhone 4S and later versions, iPads with 
Retina display, the iPad Mini, and iPod Touches (fifth generation and later versions).
In 2012, Google released its version of an intelligent assistant for Android-based 
smartphones, which it calls Google Now. Google Now is part of the Google Search 
mobile application. While Google Now has many of the capabilities of Apple’s Siri, it 
attempts to go further by predicting what users may need based on situational aware-
ness, including physical location, time of day, previous location history, calendar, and 
expressed interests based on previous activity, as described in its patent application 
(United States Patent Office, 2012). For instance, if you often search for a particular 
musician or style of music, Google Now might provide recommendations for similar 
music. If it knows that you go to a health club every other day, Google Now will remind 
you not to schedule events during these periods. If it knows that you typically read 
articles about health issues, the system might monitor Google News for similar articles 
and make recommendations. Other intelligent personal assistants include Samsung’s 
S Voice, LG’s Voice Mate, and Microsoft’s Cortana.

MOBILE APPS: THE NEXT BIG THING IS HERE
The use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers in e-com-
merce has truly exploded, as has the use of mobile apps. Worldwide, according to 
451 Research, there are around 2 billion active mobile app users worldwide, and this 
number is expected to increase to over 3 billion by 2018. Although the United States 
accounts for the most mobile app downloads on an absolute basis, countries in Asia, 
such as Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, have much 
higher app download rates on a per-user basis, based on activity on InMobi’s mobile 
ad network (see the opening case in Chapter 6, InMobi’s Global Mobile Ad Network for 
further information on InMobi).
Although using mobile browsers to access mobile Web sites remains popular, 
increasingly more and more time is being spent with mobile apps. For instance, in 
United Kingdom, 46% of total digital media time is spent using an app on a mobile 
device, compared to only 10% using a mobile browser. A much higher percentage of 
social media time is spent by users in the United Kingdom on a mobile app (61%) 
versus a mobile browser (only 8%) (comScore, 2015). However, U.K. mobile phone 
users are still more likely to use a mobile Web browser for shopping than an app.
In Finland, 80% of smartphone owners in 2014 used mobile apps on their devices, 
a 150% increase from 2012. Activities that are popular on apps include accessing 

160	
	
C H A P T E R  2     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e
social networks such as Facebook and Instagram, using Google Maps, using messag-
ing apps such as WhatsApp, listening to music on Spotify, watching online video on 
YouTube, and playing games. Social networks are the dominant mobile app activity in 
Australia, with almost two-thirds of mobile Internet users using such apps monthly. 
As with Finland, games, maps, and entertainment apps are also popular. In France, 
the top mobile app ranked by unique visitors is YouTube. We examine development 
of mobile apps and mobile Web sites in further detail in Chapter 3. Insight on Business: 
Apps For Everything: The App Ecosystem also gives you some further background on 
mobile apps.
PLATFORMS FOR MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
Unlike mobile Web sites, which can be accessed by any Web-enabled mobile device, 
native apps, which are designed specifically to operate using the mobile device’s hard-
ware and operating system, are platform-specific. Applications for the iPhone, iPad, 
and other iOS devices are written in the Objective-C programming language using the 
iOS SDK (software developer kit). Applications for Android operating system–based 
phones typically are written using Java, although portions of the code may be in the 
C or C++ programming language. BlackBerry apps also are written in Java. Applica-
tions for Windows mobile devices are written in C or C++. In addition to creating 
native apps using a programming language such as Objective C or Java, there are 
also hundreds of low-cost or open source app development toolkits that make creat-
ing cross-platform mobile apps relatively easy and inexpensive without having to 
use a device-specific programming language. See Section 3.6 in Chapter 3 for more 
information.
APP MARKETPLACES
Once written, applications are distributed through various marketplaces. Android apps 
for Android-based phones are distributed through Google Play, which is controlled by 
Google. iPhone applications are distributed through Apple’s App Store. BlackBerry 
applications can be found in RIM’s App World, while Microsoft operates the Windows 
Phone Marketplace for Windows mobile devices. Apps can also be purchased from 
third-party vendors such as Amazon’s Appstore. It is important to distinguish “native” 
mobile apps, which run directly on a mobile device and rely on the device’s internal 
operating system, from Web apps referred to in Section 2.5, which install into your 
browser, although these can operate in a mobile environment as well.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
APPS FOR EVERYTHING: THE APP ECOSYSTEM
When Steve Jobs introduced the 
iPhone in January 2007, no one—
including himself—envisioned that 
the device would launch a revolution 
in consumer and business software or 
become a major e-commerce platform, let 
alone a game platform, advertising platform, 
and general media platform for television shows, 
movies, videos, and e-books. In short, it’s become 
the personal computer all over again, just in a 
much smaller form factor.
The iPhone’s original primary functions, 
beyond being a cell phone, were to be a camera, 
text messaging device, and Web browser. What 
Apple initially lacked for the iPhone were soft-
ware applications that would take full advantage 
of its computing capabilities. The solution was 
software developed by outside developers—tens 
of thousands of outside developers—who were 
attracted to the mission by potential profits and 
fame from the sale or free distribution of their 
software applications on a platform approved by 
the leading innovator in handheld computing and 
cellular devices. More than two-thirds of apps are 
free. Every month, Apple receives thousands of 
new apps from over 9 million registered developers 
who may be teenagers in a garage, major video 
game developers, or major publishers, as well as 
Fortune 500 consumer products firms using apps 
for marketing and promotion.
In July 2008, Apple introduced the App 
Store, which provides a platform for the distri-
bution and sale of apps by Apple as well as by 
independent developers. Following in the footsteps 
of the iTunes music store, Apple hoped that the 
software apps—most of them free—would drive 
sales of the iPhone device. It was not expecting 
the App Store itself to become a major source of 
revenue. Fast forward to 2015: there are now an 
estimated 1.5 million approved apps available for 
download from the App Store. Other smartphone 
developers also followed suit: by 2015, there 
were over 1.6 million apps available for Android 
devices as well. As of June 2015, more than 100 
billion apps had been downloaded from the App 
Store, and approximately 8 million apps are down-
loaded from the App Store every day. Apple has 
reported that customers spent about $15 billion 
in the App Store in 2014, generating an estimated 
profit for Apple of nearly $5 billion. Even so, 
Apple’s primary goal in offering apps is not to 
make money from them but instead to drive sales 
of devices—the iPhones, iPads, and iPods that 
need software to become useful. It’s the reverse 
of printer companies who make cheap printers in 
order to sell expensive ink. At the same time, apps 
tie the customer to a hardware platform: the cost 
of switching to a different platform rises with each 
new app installed.
The app phenomenon has spawned a new 
digital ecosystem: tens of thousands of developers, 
a wildly popular hardware platform, and millions of 
consumers looking for a computer in their pocket 
that can replace their now clunky desktop-laptop 
Microsoft Windows computers, do a pretty good 
job as a digital media center while on the road, and, 
by the way, serve as a cell phone. And the mobile 
platform has even started to usurp TV as the most 
popular entertainment medium. A 2015 report 
from Flurry found that the average U.S. consumer 
now spends nearly 200 minutes per day within 
apps, well ahead of the 168 minutes spent watch-
ing TV. As recently as 2014, TV was still comfort-
ably ahead of apps. More consumers are opting to 
consume media on their phones than ever before, 
which is more good news for app developers.
The range of applications among the 1.5 
million or so apps on the Apple platform is stag-
gering and defies brief description. Currently, there 
are 24 different categories. You can use the Genius 

162	
	
C H A P T E R  2     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e
feature to recommend new apps based on 
ones you already have. The most popular app 
categories are games, education, business, life-
style, and entertainment.
The implications of the app ecosystem for 
e-commerce are significant. The smartphone in your 
pocket becomes not only a general-purpose com-
puter but also an always-present shopping tool for 
consumers, as well as an entirely new marketing and 
advertising platform for vendors. Early e-commerce 
applications using desktops and laptops were cel-
ebrated as allowing people to shop in their pajamas. 
Smartphones extend this range from pajamas to 
office desktops to trains, planes, and cars—all while 
fully clothed. You can shop anywhere, shop every-
where, and shop all the time, in between talking, 
texting, watching video, and listening to music.
Almost all of the top 100 brands have a 
presence in at least one of the major app stores, 
and more than 90% have an app in the Apple 
App Store. Here are a few examples of how some 
firms are using apps to advance and support their 
brands:
•	 Coca-Cola Freestyle: Allows users to create 
custom drinks by combining choices and use 
the Location Finder to find a Freestyle machine 
to actually create the drink
•	 Benjamin Moore’s Color Capture: Enables 
users to match colors and paints
•	 Colgate-Palmolive’s Max White Photo 
Recharger: Enables users to whiten their teeth 
in photos
•	 Tiffany’s Engagement Ring Finder: Lets users 
view diamonds by size, shape, setting, metal, 
and design
•	 Charmin’s SitOrSquat Restroom Finder: Pro-
vides users with locations of nearest public 
bathrooms, including cleanliness reviews, avail-
ability of changing tables, and handicapped 
access.
There are, of course, dangers in any ecosys-
tem dominated by a single company. The Apple 
iOS platform is a closed sandbox, inviting the 
potential for censorship. Whether that censor-
ship is justified depends upon who you ask. For 
instance, Apple has removed applications because 
of sexually themed content. Clearly Apple is con-
cerned the App Store might become an adult 
digital theme park that would turn off parents 
and families who are the target audience for 
iPhone and iPad sales. In 2015, Apple removed 
all games and apps featuring images of the Con-
federate flag, including a game intended to teach 
users about Civil War history. After some back-
lash, they reinstated many of these games, but 
required the game developers to remove the flag 
from screenshots and app icons. Apple has also 
had to fight to keep malware off of the App Store. 
For instance, a Russian app entitled “Find and 
Call” purported to simplify users’ contacts lists, 
but instead stole those contacts and uploaded 
the address book to a remote server, spamming 
those addresses. In 2013, researchers at Georgia 
Tech created an app that was able to elude all of 
Apple iOS’s most current security tools, including 
sandboxing, code signing, and various anti-exploit 
technologies. Thus far, most Apple app malware 
has been targeted toward jailbroken iPhones. 
However, in 2015, security researchers exposed 
flaws in the App Store that allow malicious apps 
to steal passwords and private user data. Clearly, 
the app ecosystem is not immune to many of 
the same issues that apply to the Internet and 
e-commerce at large.

n 2015, the amount of Internet traffic generated by YouTube alone is greater 
than the amount of traffic on the entire Internet in 2000. Because of video 
streaming and the explosion in mobile devices demanding high-bandwidth 
applications, Internet traffic has increased over 500% since 2010 and is pre-
dicted to nearly triple over the next five years (see Figure 2.20). Internet video is now 
a majority of Internet traffic and will reach 80% by 2019, according to Cisco. Experts 
call services like YouTube, Netflix, and high definition streaming video “net bombs” 
because they threaten the effective operation of the Internet. Mobile platform traffic

is growing at nearly 70% and will soon push cellular networks and the Internet to 
their capacities. Cisco estimates that annual global Internet traffic will be around 2 
zettabytes in 2019: that’s 2,000 exabytes, or, in other words, 20 with 19 zeroes behind it!
Analysts differ on how fast Internet capacity is growing. Large telecommunication 
companies argue that demand will soon overwhelm capacity, while other experts 
argue that Internet bandwidth can double every year for a very long time and easily 
keep up with demand. Perhaps they’re both right: Internet capacity can expand to keep 
up with demand if sufficient capital is invested in backbone and local networks. That’s 
a big “if.” As a result, and in order to raise revenue, many large ISPs have bandwidth 
caps that require heavy users of video to pay more for their Internet service. More 
charges based on usage are in the pipeline.
In today’s broadband environment, the threshold of patience is very low. Increased 
video and audio customer expectations are bad news for anyone seeking to use the 
Web for delivery of high-quality multimedia content and high definition video. Akamai 
is one of the Web’s major helpers, and an overwhelming majority of the Web’s top 
companies use Akamai’s services to speed the delivery of content. Akamai serves more 
than 25 terabits of Web traffic per second.
Slow-loading Web pages and Web content sometimes result from poor design, but 
more often than not, the problem stems from the underlying infrastructure of the 
Internet. The Internet is a collection of networks that has to pass information from 
one network to another. Sometimes the handoff is not smooth. Every 1,500-byte packet 
of information sent over the Internet must be verified by the receiving server and 
an acknowledgment sent to the sender. This slows down not only the distribution of 
content such as music, but also interactive requests such as purchases, which require 
the client computer to interact with an online shopping cart. Moreover, each packet 
may go through many different servers on its way to its final destination, multiplying 
by several orders of magnitude the number of acknowledgments required to move a 
packet from New York to San Francisco. The Internet today spends much of its time 
and capacity verifying packets, contributing to a problem called “latency” or delay. 
For this reason, a single e-mail with a 1-megabyte attached PDF file can create more 
than 50 megabytes of Internet traffic and data storage on servers, client hard drives, 
and network backup drives.
Akamai Technologies was founded by Tom Leighton, an MIT professor of applied 
mathematics, and Daniel Lewin, an MIT grad student, with the idea of expediting 
Internet traffic to overcome these limitations. Lewin’s master’s thesis was the theoreti-
cal starting point for the company. It described storing copies of Web content such 
as pictures or video clips at many different locations around the Internet so that one 
could always retrieve a nearby copy, making Web pages load faster.
Officially launched in August 1998, Akamai’s current products are based on the 
Akamai Intelligent Platform, a cloud platform made up of over 200,000 servers in 
110 countries within over 1,400 networks around the world, and all within a single 
network hop of 85% of all Internet users. Akamai software on these servers allows the 
platform to identify and block security threats and provide comprehensive knowledge 
of network conditions, as well as instant device-level detection and optimization.

Akamai’s site performance products allow customers to move their Web content closer 
to end users so a user in New York City, for instance, will be served L.L.Bean pages 
from the New York Metro area Akamai servers, while users of the L.L.Bean site in San 
Francisco will be served pages from Akamai servers in San Francisco. Akamai has a 
wide range of large corporate and government clients: 1 out of every 3 global Fortune 
500 companies, the top 30 media and entertainment companies, 97 of the top 100 
online U.S. retailers, all branches of the U.S. military, all the top Internet portals, all 
the major U.S. sports leagues, and so on. In 2015, Akamai delivers between 15% and 
30% of all Web traffic, and over 2 trillion daily Internet interactions. Other competitors 
in the content delivery network (CDN) industry include Limelight Networks, Level 3 
Communications, and Mirror Image Internet.
Accomplishing this daunting task requires that Akamai monitor the entire Inter-
net, locating potential sluggish areas and devising faster routes for information to 
travel. Frequently used portions of a client’s Web site or large video or audio files that 
would be difficult to send to users quickly are stored on Akamai’s servers. When a user 
requests a song or a video file, his or her request is redirected to an Akamai server 
nearby and the content served from this local server. Akamai’s servers are placed 
in Tier 1 backbone supplier networks, large ISPs, universities, and other networks. 
Akamai’s software determines which server is optimum for the user and then trans-
mits the “Akamaized” content locally. Web sites that are “Akamaized” can be delivered 
anywhere from 4 to 10 times as fast as non-Akamaized content. Akamai has developed 
a number of other business services based on its Internet savvy, including targeted 
advertising based on user location and zip code, content security, business intelligence, 
disaster recovery, on-demand bandwidth and computing capacity during spikes in 
Internet traffic, storage, global traffic management, and streaming services. Akamai 
also offers a product called Advertising Decision Solutions, which provides compa-
nies with intelligence generated by the Internet’s most accurate and comprehensive 
knowledge base of Internet network activity. Akamai’s massive server deployment 
and relationships with networks throughout the world enable optimal collection of 
geography and bandwidth-sensing information. As a result, Akamai provides a highly 
accurate knowledge base with worldwide coverage. Customers integrate a simple 
program into their Web server or application server. This program communicates with 
the Akamai database to retrieve the very latest information. The Akamai network of 
servers is constantly mapping the Internet, and at the same time, each company’s 
software is in continual communication with the Akamai network. The result: data 
is always current. Advertisers can deliver ads based on country, region, city, market 
area, area code, county, zip code, connection type, and speed. You can see several 
interesting visualizations of the Internet that log basic real-time Web activity by visiting 
the Akamai Web site.
The shift toward cloud computing and the mobile platform as well as the growing 
popularity of streaming video have provided Akamai with new growth opportunities. 
As more businesses and business models are moving to the Web, Akamai has seen its 
client base continue to grow beyond the most powerful Internet retailers and online 
content providers. In 2014, Akamai made a push to encourage Hollywood studios to

use the cloud for feature films. Akamai announced that it was partnering with Aspera, 
a high-speed file transfer company, to develop the capability to upload and download 
large video files fast enough for business use, including feature films. Akamai had 
already developed partnerships with companies that allow movie studios to convert 
movie files from one format to another as well as to apply DRM protections all in one 
step. Establishing partnerships with movie studios represents big business for Akamai, 
with an increasing amount of media consumption taking place on mobile devices 
through the cloud. To that end, Akamai acquired video streaming optimization start-
up Octoshape in 2015, improving its ability to deliver high quality streaming video.
Akamai is also acutely aware of the increase in cybercrime as more traffic migrates 
to the Internet. Growth in Internet traffic is good news for Akamai, but the company 
must also now deal with politically motivated cyberattacks, organized crime online, 
and state-sponsored cyberwarfare. In 2014, Akamai improved its Kona Site Defender 
tool, which offers a variety of security measures for Akamai clients. The tool protects 
against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and includes a firewall for Web 
applications. Akamai also upgraded Site Defender’s Web Application Firewall feature 
and developed modifications to the tool that make it easier for its users to use. Akamai 
has continued to acquire security companies in 2014, purchasing Prolexic Technolo-
gies, a cloud-based security provider specializing in protecting data centers from DDoS 
attacks. With so many businesses now dependent on the uninterrupted flow of content 
over the Internet, Akamai is in a very strong position to sell security services to its 
customers. In 2015, Akamai partnered with top information security firm Trustwave 
to cross-sell each other’s services and products, expanding their offerings and reach-
ing even further. They made a similar agreement with China Unicom, a provider of 
cloud services in the fast-growing Chinese market. Akamai has also moved into areas 
of the world with less developed broadband infrastructure, such as the Middle East. 
In 2015, Akamai opened an office in Dubai, hoping to bolster its presence in an area 
where the adoption rate for broadband is skyrocketing. However, as impressive as 
Akamai’s operation has become, it may not be nearly enough to cope with the next 5 
to 10 years of Internet growth.
Case Study Questions
1.	 Why does Akamai need to geographically disperse its servers to deliver its cus-
tomers’ Web content?
2.	 If you wanted to deliver software content over the Internet, would you sign up for 
Akamai’s service? Why or why not?
3.	 What advantages does an advertiser derive from using Akamai’s service? What 
kinds of products might benefit from this kind of service?
4.	 Do you think Internet users should be charged based on the amount of band-
width they consume, or on a tiered plan where users would pay in rough propor-

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Discuss the origins of, and the key technology concepts behind, the Internet.
•	
The Internet has evolved from a collection of mainframe computers located on a few U.S. college cam-
puses to an interconnected network of thousands of networks and millions of computers worldwide.
•	
The history of the Internet can be divided into three phases: the Innovation Phase (1961–1974), the Insti-
tutionalization Phase (1975–1995), and the Commercialization Phase (1995 to the present).
•	
Packet switching, TCP/IP, and client/server technology are key technology concepts behind the Internet.
•	
The mobile platform has become the primary means for accessing the Internet.
•	
Cloud computing refers to a model of computing in which firms and individuals obtain computing power 
and software applications over the Internet, rather than purchasing the hardware and software and 
installing it on their own computers.
•	
Internet protocols and utility programs such as HTTP, SMTP and POP, SSL and TLS, FTP, Telnet, Ping, 
and Tracert provide a number of Internet services.
Explain the current structure of the Internet.
•	
The main structural elements of the Internet are the backbone (composed primarily high-bandwidth fiber 
optic cable), IXPs (hubs that use high-speed switching computers to connect to the backbone), CANs 
(campus areas networks), and ISPs (which deal with the “last mile” of service to homes and offices).
•	
Governing bodies, such as IAB, ICANN, IESG, IETF, ISOC, and W3C, have influence over the Internet and 
monitor its operations, although they do not control it.
Understand the limitations of today’s Internet and the potential capabilities of the Internet of the future.
•	
To envision what the Internet of tomorrow will look like, we must first look at the limitations of today’s 
Internet, which include bandwidth limitations, quality of service limitations, network architecture limita-
tions, language limitations, and limitations arising from the wired nature of the Internet.
•	
Internet2 is a consortium working together to develop and test new technologies for potential use on the 
Internet. Other groups are working to expand Internet bandwidth via improvements to fiber optics. Wire-
less LAN and 4G technologies are providing users of smartphones and tablet computers with increased 
access to the Internet and its various services. The increased bandwidth and expanded connections will 
result in a number of benefits, including latency solutions; guaranteed service levels; lower error rates; 
and declining costs. The Internet of Things will be a big part of the Internet of the future, with more and 
more sensor-equipped machines and devices connected to the Internet.
Understand how the Web works.
•	
The Web was developed during 1989–1991 by Dr. Tim Berners-Lee, who created a computer program that 
allowed formatted pages stored on the Internet to be linked using keywords (hyperlinks). In 1993, Marc 
Andreessen created the first graphical Web browser, which made it possible to view documents on the 
Web graphically and created the possibility of universal computing.
•	
The key concepts you need to be familiar with in order to understand how the Web works are hypertext, 
HTTP, URLs, HTML, XML, Web server software, Web clients, and Web browsers.

Describe how Internet and Web features and services support e-commerce.
•	
Together, the Internet and the Web make e-commerce possible by allowing computer users to access 
product and service information and to complete purchases online.
•	
Some of the specific features that support e-commerce include e-mail, instant messaging, search engines, 
online forums (message boards), streaming media, and cookies.
•	
Web 2.0 features and services include social networks, blogs, RSS, podcasts, wikis, music and video ser-
vices, Internet telephony, and online software and services.
Understand the impact of m-commerce applications.
•	
M-commerce applications are part of the larger $128 billion m-commerce market.
•	
Smartphone and tablet users spent the majority of their time using mobile apps rather than the mobile 
Web.
•	
There are a variety of different platforms for mobile application development including Objective-C (for 
iOS devices), Java (BlackBerrys and Android smartphones), and C and C++ (Windows mobile devices 
and some BlackBerry coding).
•	
Mobile apps for the iPhone are distributed through Apple's App Store, for BlackBerrys through RIM's App 
World, for Android devices through Google Play, and for Windows mobile devices through Microsoft’s 
Windows Phone Marketplace. There are also third-party vendors such as Amazon's Appstore.

hen the London-based 
Financial Times (FT) 
updated its apps with 
a new browser-based HTML5 Web app in 
2011, it became the first major news outlet 
to employ responsive design tools to create a 
single app for multiple platforms. FT believed 
that the HMTL5 app would yield significant 
cost savings in comparison to building multiple 
native apps for different platforms, and would 
also liberate it from app stores and their at-
tendant commission fees. The decision was 
also triggered by Apple’s pronouncement that 
it would no longer share subscriber data from 
subscriptions purchased through its App Store. 
So when FT began considering its next 
upgrade, it had a firm technological base on which to build. Its next major goal was to 
satisfy the yearning of a significant portion of its readership who still wanted to be able 
to read the paper as they always did, from cover to cover. Released in 2013, FT’s new Web 
app has two modes: Live and Morning. The Live version provides frequently updated stories 
and shifting article arrangement. The Morning version, on the other hand, reproduces the 
experience of yesteryear, presenting a snapshot of the previous day’s news just like the 
print edition. Because the majority of FT Web app users access the site from their iPads, 
the upgrade applied only to that channel. A navigation bar allows readers to easily toggle 
between the two versions and also presents thumbnails for easy navigation to newspaper 
sections, a search bar, and a refresh button. A new section, My FT, provides article 
recommendations based on reading history and a place to store personal portfolios and 
clippings. Clippings are saved articles and links that readers can share with other FT.com 
users. Articles can be clipped from the Web site on a desktop and saved for later reading 
within the Web app. Portfolios can include any personal investments the user wants to 
track. Personal notes can be added to any holding, and articles pertaining to any company 
or investment can be automatically added to the News tab. Subscribers can also create 
personalized charts to monitor investment performance vs. performance benchmarks and 
organize how they view their portfolio. While some of these tools had been available in the 
original Web app, My FT consolidated them in a handy single-page hub.
But while FT.com subscribers have access to the latest tools and technologies for man-
aging, monitoring, and viewing their investments and sharing articles with fellow readers, 
they now also experience a digital design that simulates the reading of a newspaper. A

fixed-height page and two-column layout limits the amount of up and down scrolling 
needed to read an article, and a left-to-right swipe navigates to the next article. This format 
has been found to keep readers engaged longer as they dig deeper into the site. Full-page 
ads, often including multimedia content, are interspersed between articles and display 
at each section change. Simulating a television commercial break or an advertisement 
encountered while turning the pages of a magazine, these ads command a premium. FT’s 
digital subscriptions have long since surpassed print circulation, and the new app design 
provides additional opportunities for digital advertising growth, including space on article 
pages in addition to the interstitials. In 2015, a full half of FT’s total traffic comes via 
mobile devices.
Other changes aimed at enhancing the reader experience included new sections for the 
weekly publications FT Money and FTfm, an analysis of the fund management industry, 
a new index hub for FT blogs, and beefed-up multimedia story accompaniments such 
as slideshows and videos. Another new attraction is fastFT, a market-focused, Monday-
through-Friday, live commentary and reporting service offering up short summaries of 
significant market events that can be expanded to the full story length if desired. In 2014, 
FT launched its fastFT service for the Samsung Gear S smartwatch, representing its first 
foray into wearable electronics. The service will stream fastFT headlines to smartwatch 
users at customizable speeds. FT also made upgrades to its Android app in 2014. The 
Android version now allows video content, high-resolution images optimized for mobile 
screens, clearer design, and embedded slideshows.
The overarching goal of the revamp was to balance the desires of FT’s older, but 
technologically proficient, audience with the expectations of its newer, younger audience. 
FT wanted to provide its older subscribers a soothingly familiar experience while introduc-
ing them to the convenience and efficiencies of modern tools. At the same time, it hoped 
to keep its younger audience on the site longer, giving FT advertisers more marketing 
opportunities. Thus far, the results of FT’s efforts have been a resounding success. In 2015, 
FT announced that its circulation had reached an all-time high at 737,000 subscribers, 
a 9% increase over the previous year. The digital subscriber segment of FT’s subscriber 
base grew 14% over the previous year to 520,000, comprising 70% of total subscribers, 
and digital accounts for more than 40% of FT’s total income, compared to closer to 10 
or 15% for most other modern newspapers.
The FT app experience, like that of several other prominent publishers, is essentially 
marrying the print experience and the digital experience, mixing static daily print content 
and a more print-like reading experience with dynamic Web-only content and content 
management tools. But the FT.com—Web app union is equally important. FT wanted to 
further encourage an emerging trend it had observed among its million readers: channel 
hopping.
FT invested significant time and resources into adapting storage tools and methods 
including cookies, the application cache (AppCache), IndexDB, and the bootstrap process 
so that subscribers could have access even when they had no network connection. The 
majority of each Web page is JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), templates, adver-
tising, and UI images that do not change from page to page. Most go into local storage. 
The Web app automatically caches the content on load, and the page is assembled in the 

browser using JavaScript. When an online reader goes to an article page, the server only 
has to send the article content. Everything else is added to the page in the browser. For 
FT’s audience, many of whom switch back and forth between workplace computers and 
mobile devices, and which also includes a sizable business traveler audience, this means 
that cached articles, clipped articles, My FT, and even video content are available offline 
and can even be streamed to in-flight entertainment screens without a network connection. 
What’s more, FT has discovered that tablet use is more conducive to the consump-
tion of longer, more in-depth pieces. While the smartphone is clearly a device designed 
for the consumption of short bursts of pertinent information, tablet reading more closely 
approximates how people read books and magazines. 
In 2014, Tom Betts, VP of Customer Analytics at FT, and his team also observed that 
during normal business hours, the desktop site gets the most traffic, but during weekends, 
a whopping 75% of traffic comes from mobile devices. This informed FT’s decision to 
split its Weekend section into a separate app, FT Weekend. FT Weekend is a graphically 
rich, premium print product focusing on lifestyle, and the app focuses more on these 
qualities than the flagship site. FT launched the app in 2014 across all major platforms 
along with a digital marketing campaign to raise awareness of the new offering. Although 
there’s some chance that FT Weekend will cannibalize some of their main subscriber 
base going forward, FT is confident that new subscribers who wouldn’t otherwise pay for 
digital editions will do so for premium content from FT Weekend, and that many readers 
will want access to both. FT will also be able to upsell FT Weekend subscribers, offering 
them deals on the full version.
FT’s revenue mix, like most other former print-only publications, has rapidly morphed 
from being primarily advertising-based to being primarily subscription-based, with profits 
declining commensurately. So while the Web app upgrade focused heavily on the goal of 
increasing subscriptions, it was also designed to bolster stalling digital and mobile adver-
tising revenue, which so far have not been able to replace lost print advertising dollars. 
Rich media ads, which FT is betting are the future of Web advertising, can be cached 
on devices and served to the Web app offline. No click is required to reach multimedia 
content; instead it is part of the content stream as readers move between articles and 
sections. FT prefers this quality-over-quantity approach, aiming to persuade advertisers 
that high-quality rich media ads that directly engage the viewer are worth the premium. 
Awareness of the browsing and reading habits of its audience is a springboard for further 
differentiation to come in how content—and advertising—is displayed in each channel. 
FT’s stance on spin-off efforts like FT Weekend is that they’re willing to do so, but only 
if they see both a need and an opportunity.
In 2015, FT’s parent company, Pearson, sold FT Group to the Japanese business 
newspaper publisher Nikkei for $1.3 billion. FT’s market-leading status in mobile and 
digital was likely a significant reason for its lofty valuation, dwarfing the Washington 
Post’s $250 million price tag. The opportunity to buy a respected news organization is 
also exceedingly rare. Nikkei has vowed not to alter the day-to-day operation of the FT, 
but it remains to be seen whether Nikkei is as committed to developing innovative ways 
to produce and deliver digital content going forward.

n Chapter 2, you learned about e-commerce’s technological foundation: the Inter-
net, Web, and the mobile platform. In this chapter, you will examine the important 
factors that a manager needs to consider when building an e-commerce presence. 
The focus will be on the managerial and business decisions you must make before you 
begin, and that you will continually need to make. Although building a sophisticated 
e-commerce presence isn’t easy, today’s tools are much less expensive and far more 
powerful than they were during the early days of e-commerce. You do not have to be 
Amazon or eBay to create a successful Web e-commerce presence. In this chapter, we 
focus on both small and medium-sized businesses as well as much larger corporate enti-
ties that serve thousands of customers a day, or even an hour. As you will see, although 
the scale may be very different, the principles and considerations are basically the same.
	 3.1	
IMAGINE YOUR E-COMMERCE PRESENCE
Before you begin to build a Web site or app of your own, there are some important 
questions you will need to think about and answer. The answers to these questions 
will drive the development and implementation of your e-commerce presence. 
WHAT’S THE IDEA? (THE VISIONING PROCESS)
Before you can plan and actually build an e-commerce presence, you need to have a 
vision of what you hope to accomplish and how you hope to accomplish it. The vision 
includes not just a statement of mission, but also identification of the target audience, 
characterization of the market space, a strategic analysis, a marketing matrix, and a 
development timeline. It starts with a dream of what’s possible, and concludes with a 
timeline and preliminary budget for development.
If you examine any successful Web site, you can usually tell from the home page 
what the vision that inspires the site is. If the company is a U.S. public company, you can 
often find a succinct statement of its vision or mission in the reports it files with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. For Amazon, it’s to become the largest marketplace 
on earth. For Facebook, it’s to make the world more open and connected. For Google, it’s 
to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. The 
e-commerce presence you want to build may not have such all-encompassing ambitions, 
but a succinct statement of mission, purpose, and direction is the key factor in driving the 
development of your project. For instance, the mission of TheKnot is to be the Internet’s 
comprehensive, one-stop wedding planning solution. 
WHERE’S THE MONEY: BUSINESS AND REVENUE MODEL
Once you have defined a mission statement, a vision, you need to start thinking about 
where the money will be coming from. You will need to develop a preliminary idea of 
your business and revenue models. You don’t need detailed revenue and cost projec-
tions at this point. Instead, you need a general idea of how your business will generate 
revenues. The basic choices will be described in Chapter 5. Basic business models are 
portal, e-tailer, content provider, transaction broker, market creator, service provider, 
and community provider (social network). 

	
I m a g i n e  Y o u r  E - c o m m e r c e  P r e s e n c e 	

177
The basic revenue model alternatives are advertising, subscriptions, transaction 
fees, sales, and affiliate revenue. There’s no reason to adopt a single business or revenue 
model, and in fact, many firms have multiple models. For instance, the Financial Times 
igital business model is to both sell subscriptions and sell ad space. In addition, they sell 
unique photographs and gifts. At TheKnot, a vertical portal for the wedding industry, you 
will find ads, affiliate relationships, and sponsorships from major creators of wedding 
products and services, including a directory to local wedding planners, all of which 
produce revenue for TheKnot. PetSmart, the most popular pet Web site in the United 
States, has a more focused sales revenue model, and presents itself almost entirely as 
an e-tailer of pet supplies. 
WHO AND WHERE IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE
Without a clear understanding of your target audience, you will not have a successful 
e-commerce presence. There are two questions here: who is your target audience and 
where can you best reach them? Your target audience can be described in a number of 
ways: demographics, behavior patterns (lifestyle), current consumption patterns (online 
vs. offline purchasing), digital usage patterns, content creation preferences (blogs, social 
networks, sites like Pinterest), and buyer personas (profiles of your typical customer). 
Understanding the demographics of your target audience is usually the first step. Demo-
graphic information includes age, income, gender, and location. In some cases, this may 
be obvious and in others, much less so. For instance, Harley-Davidson sells motorcycles 
to a very broad demographic range of varying ages, incomes, and locations, from 34-year-
olds to 65-year-olds. Although most of the purchasers are middle-aged men, with middle 
incomes, many of the men ride with women, and the Harley-Davidson Web site has a 
collection of women’s clothing and several Web pages devoted to women riders. While 
the majority of men who purchase Harley-Davidsons have modest incomes, a significant 
group of purchasers are professionals with above-average incomes. Hence, the age and 
income demographic target is quite broad. What ties Harley-Davidson riders together is 
not their shared demographics, but their love of the motorcycles and the brand, and the 
lifestyle associated with touring the highways of America on a powerful motorcycle that 
sounds like a potato popper. In contrast, a company like TheKnot is aimed at women in 
the 18–34-year-old range who are in varying stages of getting married, with lifestyles that 
include shopping online, using smartphones and tablets, downloading apps, and using 
Facebook. This audience is technologically hip. These women read and contribute to 
blogs, comment on forums, and use Pinterest to find ideas for fashion. A “typical” visitor 
to TheKnot would be a 28-year-old woman who has an engagement ring, is just starting 
the wedding planning process, has an income of $45,000, lives in the Northeast United 
States, and is interested in a beach wedding. There are, of course, other “typical” profiles. 
For each profile for your Web site you will need to develop a detailed description. 
WHAT IS THE BALLPARK? CHARACTERIZE THE MARKETPLACE
The chances of your success will depend greatly on the characteristics of the market 
you are about to enter, and not just on your entrepreneurial brilliance. Enter into a 
declining market filled with strong competitors, and you will multiply your chances 
of failure. Enter into a market that is emerging, growing, and has few competitors, and 

178	
	
C H A P T E R  3     B u i l d i n g  a n  E - c o m m e r c e  P r e s e n c e
you stand a better chance. Enter a market where there are no players, and you will 
either be rewarded handsomely with a profitable monopoly on a successful product 
no one else thought of (Apple) or you will be quickly forgotten because there isn’t a 
market for your product at this point in time (the Franklin e-book reader circa 1999). 
Features of the marketplace to focus on include the demographics of the market 
and how an e-commerce presence fits into the market. In addition, you will want to 
know about the structure of the market: competitors and substitute products. 
What are the features of the marketplace you are about to enter? Is the market 
growing, or receding in size? If it’s growing, among which age and income groups? Is 
the marketplace shifting from offline to online delivery? If so, is the market moving 
toward traditional Web sites, mobile, and/or tablets? Is there a special role for a mobile 
presence in this market? What percentage of your target audience uses a Web site, 
smartphone, or tablet? What about social networks? What’s the buzz on products like 
yours? Are your potential customers talking about the products and services you want 
to offer on Facebook, Twitter, or blogs? How many blogs focus on products like yours? 
How many Twitter posts mention similar offerings? How many Facebook Likes (signs 
of customer engagement) are attached to products you want to offer? 
The structure of the market is described in terms of your direct competitors, 
suppliers, and substitute products. You will want to make a list of the top five or ten 
competitors and try to describe their market share, and distinguishing characteristics. 
Some of your competitors may offer traditional versions of your products, while others 
will offer new renditions or versions of products that have new features. You need 
to find out everything you can about your competitors. What’s the market buzz on 
your competitors? How many unique monthly visitors (UMVs) do they have? How 
many Facebook Likes, Twitter followers, and/or Pinterest followers? How are your 
competitors using social sites and mobile devices as a part of their online presence. Is 
there something special you could do with social networks that your competitors do 
not? Do a search on customer reviews of their products. You can find online services 
(some of them free) that will measure the number of online conversations about your 
competitors, and the total share of Internet voice each of your competitors receives. 
Do your competitors have a special relationship with their suppliers that you may not 
have access to? Exclusive marketing arrangements would be one example of a special 
supplier relationship. Finally, are there substitutes for your products and services? 
For instance, your site may offer advice to the community of pet owners, but local pet 
stores or local groups may be a more trusted source of advice on pets. 
WHERE’S THE CONTENT COMING FROM? 
Web sites are like books: they’re composed of a lot of pages that have content ranging 
from text, to graphics, photos, and videos. This content is what search engines catalog 
as they crawl through all the new and changed Web pages on the Internet. The content 
is why your customers visit your site and either purchase things or look at ads that 
generate revenue for you. Therefore, the content is the single most important founda-
tion for your revenue and ultimate success. 
There are generally two kinds of content: static and dynamic. Static content is 
text and images that do not frequently change, such as product descriptions, photos, 

	
I m a g i n e  Y o u r  E - c o m m e r c e  P r e s e n c e 	

179
or text that you create to share with your visitors. Dynamic content is content that 
changes regularly, say, daily or hourly. Dynamic content can be created by you, or 
increasingly, by bloggers and fans of your Web site and products. User-generated 
content has a number of advantages: it’s free, it engages your customer fan base, and 
search engines are more likely to catalog your site if the content is changing. Other 
sources of content, especially photos, are external Web sites that aggregate content 
such as Pinterest, discussed in the closing case study in Chapter 1. 
KNOW YOURSELF: CONDUCT A SWOT ANALYSIS
A SWOT analysis is a simple but powerful method for strategizing about your business 
and understanding where you should focus your efforts. In a SWOT analysis you 
describe your strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. In the example SWOT 
analysis in Figure 3.1, you will see a profile of a typical start-up venture that includes 
a unique approach to an existing market, a promise of addressing unmet needs in this 
market, and the use of newer technologies (social and mobile platforms) that older 
competitors may have overlooked. There are many opportunities to address a large 
market with unmet needs, as well as the potential to use the initial Web site as a home 
base and spin-off related or nearby sites, leveraging the investment in design and 
technology. But there are also weaknesses and threats. Lack of financial and human 
resources are typically the biggest weakness of start-up sites. Threats include competi-
tors that could develop the same capabilities as you, and low market entry costs, which 
might encourage many more start-ups to enter the marketplace. 
Once you have conducted a SWOT analysis, you can consider ways to overcome 
your weaknesses and build on your strengths. For instance, you could consider hiring

or partnering to obtain technical and managerial expertise, and looking for financing 
opportunities (including friends and relatives). 
DEVELOP AN E-COMMERCE PRESENCE MAP 
E-commerce has moved from being a PC-centric activity on the Web to a mobile and 
tablet-based activity as well. While 75% of e-commerce today is still conducted using 
desktop computers, increasingly smartphones and tablets will be used for purchasing. 
Currently, smartphones and tablets are used by a majority of Internet users in the 
United States to shop for goods and services, explore purchase options, look up prices, 
and access social sites. Your potential customers use these various devices at different 
times during the day, and involve themselves in different conversations depending on 
what they are doing—touching base with friends, tweeting, or reading a blog. Each of 
these are “touch points” where you can meet the customer, and you have to think about 
how you develop a presence in these different virtual places. Figure 3.2 provides a 
roadmap to the platforms and related activities you will need to think about when 
developing your e-commerce presence. 
Figure 3.2 illustrates four different kinds of e-commerce presence: Web site/App, 
e-mail, social media, and offline media. For each of these types there are different 
platforms that you will need to address. For instance, in the case of Web sites and/or 
apps, there are three different platforms: traditional desktop, tablets, and smartphones, 
each with different capabilities. And for each type of e-commerce presence there 
are related activities you will need to consider. For instance, in the case of Web sites

An e-commerce presence requires firms to consider the four different kinds of presence, and the platforms 
and activities associated with each type of presence.

181
and apps, you will want to engage in search engine marketing, display ads, affiliate 
programs, and sponsorships. Offline media, the fourth type of e-commerce presence, 
is included here because many firms use multiplatform or integrated marketing where 
print, television, or radio ads refer customers to Web sites and apps. The marketing 
activities in Figure 3.2 are described in much greater detail in Chapters 6 and 7. 
DEVELOP A TIMELINE: MILESTONES 
Where would you like to be a year from now? It’s a good idea for you to have a rough 
idea of the time frame for developing your e-commerce presence when you begin. You 
should break your project down into a small number of phases that could be completed 
within a specified time. Six phases are usually enough detail at this point. Table 3.1 
illustrates a one-year timeline for the development of a start-up Web site.
Note that this example timeline defers the development of a mobile plan until 
after a Web site and social media plan have been developed and implemented. There 
is a growing trend, however, to flip this timeline around, and begin with a mobile plan 
instead (sometimes referred to as mobile first design). Mobile first design has both 
advantages and disadvantages that will be examined more fully in Section 3.6.
HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST? 
It’s too early in the process to develop a detailed budget for your e-commerce presence, 
but it is a good time to develop a preliminary idea of the costs involved. How much 
you spend on a Web site, for instance, depends on what you want it to do. Simple Web 
sites can be built and hosted with a first-year cost of €4,000 or less if all the work is 
done in-house by yourself and others willing to work without pay. A more reasonable 
budget for a small Web start-up might be €20,000 to €40,000. Here the firm owner 
would develop all the content at no cost, and a Web designer and programmer would 
be hired to implement the initial Web site. As discussed later, the Web site would be

hosted on a cloud-based server. The Web sites of large firms that offer high levels of 
interactivity and linkage to corporate systems can cost several hundred thousand to 
millions of dollars a year to create and operate.
While how much you spend to build a Web site depends on how much you can 
afford, and, of course, the size of the opportunity, Figure 3.3 provides some idea of the 
relative size of various Web site costs. In general, the cost of hardware, software, and 
telecommunications for building and operating a Web site has fallen dramatically (by 
over 50%) in the last decade, making it possible for very small entrepreneurs to build 
fairly sophisticated sites. At the same time, while technology has lowered the costs of 
system development, the costs of marketing, content development, and design have 
risen to make up more than half of typical Web site budgets. The longer-term costs 
would also have to include site and system maintenance, which are not included here. 
The costs of developing a mobile site and apps are discussed in Section 3.6. 
	 3.2	
BUILDING AN E-COMMERCE PRESENCE: A 
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
Once you have developed a vision of the e-commerce presence you want to build, it’s 
time to start thinking about how to build and implement that presence. Building a suc-
cessful e-commerce presence requires a keen understanding of business, technology, 
and social issues, as well as a systematic approach. E-commerce is just too important 
to be left totally to technologists and programmers.
The two most important management challenges are (1) developing a clear under-
standing of your business objectives and (2) knowing how to choose the right technology 
	
FIGURE 3.3	
COMPONENTS OF A WEB SITE BUDGET
While hardware and software costs have fallen dramatically, Web sites face significant design, content 
development, and marketing costs.

183
to achieve those objectives. The first challenge requires you to build a plan for developing 
your firm’s presence. The second challenge requires you to understand some of the basic 
elements of e-commerce infrastructure. Let the business drive the technology.
Even if you decide to outsource the development effort and operation to a service 
provider, you will still need to have a development plan and some understanding of the 
basic e-commerce infrastructure issues such as cost, capability, and constraints. Without 
a plan and a knowledge base, you will not be able to make sound management decisions 
about e-commerce within your firm.
Let’s assume you are a manager for a medium-sized industrial parts firm in Munich, 
Germany. You have been given a budget of €80,000 to develop an e-commerce presence 
for the firm. The purpose will be to sell and service the firm’s customers, who are mostly 
small machine and metal fabricating shops, and to engage your customers through a blog 
and user forum. Where do you start? In the following sections, we will examine developing 
an e-commerce Web site, and then, at the end of the chapter, discuss some of the more spe-
cific considerations involved in developing a mobile site and building mobile applications.
First, you must be aware of the main areas where you will need to make decisions 
(see Figure 3.4). On the organizational and human resources fronts, you will have 
to bring together a team of individuals who possess the skill sets needed to build and 
manage a successful e-commerce presence. This team will make the key decisions 
about business objectives and strategy, technology, design, and social and information 
policies. The entire development effort must be closely managed if you hope to avoid 
the disasters that have occurred at some firms.
You will also need to make decisions about hardware, software, and telecommu-
nications infrastructure. The demands of your customers should drive your choices of 
technology. Your customers will want technology that enables them to find what they 
want easily, view the product, purchase the product, and then receive the product from 
Building an e-commerce presence requires that you systematically consider the many factors that go into 
the process.

your warehouses quickly. You will also have to carefully consider design. Once you have 
identified the key decision areas, you will need to think about a plan for the project.
PLANNING: THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Your second step in building an e-commerce Web site will be creating a plan document. 
In order to tackle a complex problem such as building an e-commerce site, you will 
have to proceed systematically through a series of steps. One methodology is the 
systems development life cycle. The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a 
methodology for understanding the business objectives of any system and designing 
an appropriate solution. Adopting a life cycle methodology does not guarantee success, 
but it is far better than having no plan at all. The SDLC method also helps in creating 
documents that communicate objectives, important milestones, and the uses of 
resources to management. Figure 3.5 illustrates the five major steps involved in the 
systems development life cycle for an e-commerce site:
•	 Systems analysis/planning
•	 Systems design
•	 Building the system
•	 Testing
•	 Implementation
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS/PLANNING: IDENTIFY BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, 
SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY, AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
In the systems analysis/planning step of the SDLC, you try to answer the question, 
“What do we want this e-commerce site to do for our business?” The key point is to let 
the business decisions drive the technology, not the reverse. This will ensure that your 
systems development 
life cycle (SDLC)
a methodology for under-
standing the business 
objectives of any system 
and designing an appro-
priate solution

technology platform is aligned with your business. We will assume here that you have 
identified a business strategy and chosen a business model to achieve your strategic 
objectives (see Chapter 5). But how do you translate your strategies, business models, 
and ideas into a working e-commerce Web site?
One way to start is to identify the specific business objectives for your site, and 
then develop a list of system functionalities and information requirements. Business 
objectives are simply capabilities you want your site to have.
System functionalities are types of information systems capabilities you will 
need to achieve your business objectives. The information requirements for a 
system are the information elements that the system must produce in order to achieve 
the business objectives. You will need to provide these lists to system developers and 
programmers so they know what you as the manager expect them to do.
Table 3.2 describes some basic business objectives, system functionalities, and 
information requirements for a typical e-commerce site. As shown in the table, there 
are ten basic business objectives that an e-commerce site must deliver. These objec-
tives must be translated into a description of system functionalities and ultimately 
into a set of precise information requirements. The specific information requirements 
for a system typically are defined in much greater detail than Table 3.2 indicates. To a

large extent, the business objectives of an e-commerce site are not that different from 
those of an ordinary retail store. The real difference lies in the system functionalities 
and information requirements. In an e-commerce site, the business objectives must 
be provided entirely in digital form without buildings or salespeople, 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week.
SYSTEM DESIGN: HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS
Once you have identified the business objectives and system functionalities, and have 
developed a list of precise information requirements, you can begin to consider just 
how all this functionality will be delivered. You must come up with a system design 
specification—a description of the main components in the system and their relation-
ship to one another. The system design itself can be broken down into two compo-
nents: a logical design and a physical design. A logical design includes a data flow 
diagram that describes the flow of information at your e-commerce site, the processing 
functions that must be performed, and the databases that will be used. The logical 
design also includes a description of the security and emergency backup procedures 
that will be instituted, and the controls that will be used in the system.
A physical design translates the logical design into physical components. For 
instance, the physical design details the specific model of server to be purchased, the 
software to be used, the size of the telecommunications link that will be required, the 
way the system will be backed up and protected from outsiders, and so on.
Figure 3.6(a) presents a data flow diagram for a simple high-level logical design 
for a very basic Web site that delivers catalog pages in HTML in response to HTTP 
requests from the client’s browser, while Figure 3.6(b) shows the corresponding 
physical design. Each of the main processes can be broken down into lower-level 
designs that are much more precise in identifying exactly how the information flows 
and what equipment is involved.
BUILDING THE SYSTEM: IN-HOUSE VERSUS OUTSOURCING
Now that you have a clear idea of both the logical and physical designs for your site, you 
can begin considering how to actually build the site. You have many choices, and much 
depends on the amount of money you are willing to spend. Choices range from outsourc-
ing everything (including the actual systems analysis and design) to building everything 
yourself (in-house). Outsourcing means that you will hire an outside vendor to provide 
the services involved in building the site rather than using in-house personnel. You also 
have a second decision to make: will you host (operate) the site on your firm’s own 
servers or will you outsource the hosting to a Web host provider? These decisions are 
independent of each other, but they are usually considered at the same time. There are 
some vendors who will design, build, and host your site, while others will either build 
or host (but not both). Figure 3.7 on page 188 illustrates the alternatives.
Build Your Own versus Outsourcing
Let’s take the building decision first. If you elect to build your own site, there are a 
range of options. Unless you are fairly skilled, you should use a pre-built template to 
create the Web site. For example, Yahoo Store provides templates that merely require

CHOICES IN BUILDING AND HOSTING
You have a number of alternatives to consider when building and hosting an e-commerce site.
you to input text, graphics, and other data, as well as the infrastructure to run a sales-
oriented Web site once it has been created.
If your Web site is not a sales-oriented site requiring a shopping cart, one of the least 
expensive and most widely used site building tools is WordPress. WordPress is a Web 
site development tool with a sophisticated content management system. A content 
management system (CMS) is a database software program specifically designed to 
manage structured and unstructured data and objects in a Web site environment. A CMS 
provides Web managers and designers with a centralized control structure to manage 
Web site content. WordPress also has thousands of user-built plug-ins and widgets that 
you can use to extend the functionality of a Web site. Web sites built in WordPress are 
treated by search engines like any other Web site: their content is indexed and made 
available to the entire Web community. Revenue-generating ads, affiliates, and sponsors 
are the main sources of revenue for WordPress sites. Other similar Web site building 
tools are provided by Google Sites, Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly. While these are the 
least costly ways to create a Web site, you will be limited to the “look and feel” and 
functionality provided by the templates and infrastructure supplied by these vendors.
If you have some programming experience, you might decide to build the site yourself 
“from scratch.” There are a broad variety of tools, ranging from those that help you build 
everything truly “from scratch,” such as Adobe Dreamweaver CC and Microsoft Visual 
Studio, to top-of-the-line prepackaged site-building tools that can create sophisticated sites 
customized to your needs. Figure 3.8 illustrates the spectrum of tools available. We will 
look more closely at the variety of e-commerce software available in Section 3.3.
The decision to build a Web site on your own has a number of risks. Given the 
complexity of features such as shopping carts, credit card authentication and process-
ing, inventory management, and order processing, the costs involved are high, as are 
the risks of doing a poor job. You will be reinventing what other specialized firms 
have already built, and your staff may face a long, difficult learning curve, delaying 
your entry to market. Your efforts could fail. On the positive side, you may be better 
able to build a site that does exactly what you want, and, more importantly, develop

the in-house knowledge to allow you to change the site rapidly if necessary due to a 
changing business environment.
If you choose more expensive site-building packages, you will be purchasing 
state-of-the art software that is well tested. You could get to market sooner. However, 
to make a sound decision, you will have to evaluate many different packages, and this 
can take a long time. You may have to modify the package to fit your business needs 
and perhaps hire additional outside vendors to do the modifications. Costs rise rapidly 
as modifications mount. A €3,200 package can easily become a €32,000 to €48,000 
development project (see Figure 3.9).
While sophisticated site development software packages appear to reduce costs and increase speed to 
market, as the modifications required to fit the package to your business needs rise, costs rise rapidly.

In the past, bricks-and-mortar retailers in need of an e-commerce site typically 
designed the site themselves (because they already had the skilled staff in place and 
had extensive investments in information technology capital such as databases and 
telecommunications). However, as Web applications have become more sophisticated, 
larger retailers today rely heavily on vendors to provide sophisticated Web site capabili-
ties, while also maintaining a substantial internal staff. Small start-ups may build their 
own sites from scratch using in-house technical personnel in an effort to keep costs 
low. Medium-size start-ups will often purchase a Web site design and programming 
expertise from vendors. Very small mom-and-pop firms seeking simple storefronts will 
use templates like WordPress. For e-commerce sites, the cost of building has dropped 
dramatically in the last five years, resulting in lower capital requirements for all 
players (see Insight on Business: Weebly Makes Building Web Sites Easy.)
Host Your Own versus Outsourcing
Now let’s look at the hosting decision. Most businesses choose to outsource hosting and 
pay a company to host their Web site, which means that the hosting company is respon-
sible for ensuring the site is “live,” or accessible, 24 hours a day. By agreeing to a monthly 
fee, the business need not concern itself with many of the technical aspects of setting 
up a Web server and maintaining it, telecommunications links, nor with staffing needs.
You can also choose to co-locate. With a co-location agreement, your firm pur-
chases or leases a Web server (and has total control over its operation) but locates the 
server in a vendor’s physical facility. The vendor maintains the facility, communica-
tions lines, and the machinery. Co-location has expanded with the spread of virtualiza-
tion where one server has multiple processors (4 to 16) and can operate multiple Web 
sites at once with multiple operating systems. In this case, you do not buy the server 
but rent its capabilities on a monthly basis, usually at one-quarter of the cost of owning 
the server itself. See Table 3.3 for a list of some of the major hosting/co-location/
cloud providers. There is an extraordinary range of prices for co-location, ranging from 
a few euros a month, to several hundred thousands of euros per month depending on 
the size of the Web site, bandwidth, storage, and support requirements.
While co-location involves renting physical space for your hardware, you can 
think of using a cloud service provider as renting virtual space in your provider’s 
infrastructure. Cloud services are rapidly replacing co-location because they are less 
expensive, and arguably more reliable. Unlike with co-location, your firm does not own 
the hardware. Cloud service providers offer a standardized infrastructure, virtualization 
technology, and usually employ a pay-as-you-go billing system.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
WEEBLY MAKES CREATING WEB SITES EASY
With so many big companies domi-
nating the e-commerce scene, you 
may wonder if there’s a chance for 
the little guy anymore. The answer is 
yes: there are still billions left in potential 
online retail sales, with additional money to be 
made from advertising revenues. In fact, there’s 
an e-commerce frenzy going on that nearly rivals 
the dot-com era with one exception: the start-ups 
have access to cheap technology and social media 
that can provide inexpensive marketing and sales.
Weebly provides valuable Web site solutions 
to smaller businesses and entrepeneurs. Founded 
in 2007 by Penn State graduates David Rusenko, 
Chris Fanini, and Dan Veltri, Weebly provides 
Web site templates that allow small businesses 
to create their own Web sites with a full suite 
of features, including blogs, online stores, and 
mobile compatibility. Weebly’s customers have 
built over 25 million sites, with over 240 million 
monthly unique visitors. Users create sites using 
a drag-and-drop, widget-based tool that works 
within a Web browser. Weebly’s typical customers 
are the “little guys” hoping to harness the site 
tools traditionally available only to bigger Web 
sites and retailers.
Weebly is just one option in an increasingly 
crowded marketplace for website creation ser-
vices. Today’s offerings are a far cry from early 
services like GeoCities and Angelfire, which 
look crude by today’s standards. Weebly and its 
competitors, including Squarespace, Wix, and 
WordPress, offer a much more polished product 
than their predecessors. The company has a free 
option with basic features as well as premium 
plans starting at $4 per month and increasing to 
only $25 per month for its high-end Business plan. 
Over the course of its growth, Weebly has added 
Google AdSense monetization features, CSS/
HTML editing support, and the ability to generate 
a mobile version of each Web site automatically. 
Weebly dominates in this marketplace, with its 25 
million sites dwarfing the 2.5 million made with 
Squarespace, its closest competitor.
Weebly has increasingly focused on improving 
its e-commerce services, such as a mobile store 
and checkout capability, integrated shopping cart, 
and filtered product search. It also offers basic 
support for PayPal and Google Checkout, and 
in 2015 announced a partnership with payment 
solution developer Square that would allow 
Weebly site creators to keep track of all of their 
payments and orders in one place using Square. 
By revamping its e-commerce tools, Weebly hopes 
to better compete with Amazon, as well as similar 
user-friendly marketplaces such as Etsy and 
Shopify. Sixty percent of Weebly users identify 
themselves as entrepreneurs hoping to create an 
online presence for their business. 
One example is Kim Beers. Her gifts of hand-
made, environmentally friendly pet toys were so 
well received by friends that she decided to start 
selling them under the name Woof Purr Studio. 
Beers first tried selling on Etsy and eBay, which 
enabled her to build an initial following. Dissatis-
fied with the fees and lack of control offered by 
those platforms, she decided to create her own 
Web site with Weebly, starting with Weebly’s 
Basic version and then upgrading to its Business 
version. Beers reports a much better user expe-
rience, with the ability to display larger images 
and videos, offer coupon codes, and ship items 

192	
	
C H A P T E R  3     B u i l d i n g  a n  E - c o m m e r c e  P r e s e n c e
internationally more easily. Even better, her 
sales have improved, which she attributes to 
her ability to be able to explain in a video on 
the site why her toys are better although they cost 
more than toys made in China from potentially 
chemical-laced materials. 
Although Weebly doesn’t disclose its revenue, 
the company is profitable and has been since 
2009. This is an attractive quality for a start-up 
company, many of which have historically sought 
growth first and profitability later. In 2014, 
Weebly received $35 million in venture capital 
funding that valued the company at $455 million. 
Weebly is one of the more valuable companies to 
graduate the technology incubator Y Combinator, 
which its founders attended in 2007.
Because so many businesses still don’t have 
an online presence, Weebly’s prospects for growth 
are bright. Less than 40% of restaurants have 
online menus, for example. Although its com-
petitors, such as Squarespace and Wix, are also 
growing fast, there appears to be enough room 
in this market for several companies. In 2013, 
Wix launched an initial public offering, but the 
response was lukewarm, with investors expressing 
concern over its lack of profitability. So far, that’s 
an advantage for Weebly, but as Weebly begins an 
aggressive push for growth, the company’s profit-
ability may suffer.
Weebly has continued adapting its platform 
to mobile devices. It launched a full version of 
its site creation tool for iPad in late 2014, and 
for Android in 2015. These tools allow users to 
create the same high quality Web sites without 
ever logging on to Weebly’s desktop site. Both 
tools required complete rebuilds of Weebly’s site 
creation system from the ground up, and both 
use native code to maximize speed. Weebly even 
developed an app for the Apple Watch that allows 
users to monitor site traffic and visitor statistics, 
manage blog comments, check store orders, and 
other basic functions. Weebly’s push to the mobile 
platform will only help its prospects for future 
growth, and existing customers will have more 
options for building and maintaining their sites.
In 2015, Weebly also announced a program 
that will provide enhanced support for merchants 
located in the United Kingdom, France, and 
Germany. It will also now offer localized domain 
names for Web sites that it hosts, utilizing coun-
try-code top level domains (ccTLDs). 
Weebly is just one example of a larger 
trend toward leaner business models that rely on 
outside help for many of their business functions. 
Although hardware has become less expensive 
over time, many startup firms have found that 
cloud computing and social marketing greatly 
reduce the costs of starting a company. Market 
intelligence, public relations, and even design ser-
vices can be found online for a fraction of the 
cost of traditional service firms. It’s never been 
cheaper to start an e-commerce company.

Hosting, co-location, and cloud services have become a commodity and a utility: 
costs are driven by very large providers (such as IBM) who can achieve large econo-
mies of scale by establishing huge “server farms” located strategically around the 
country and the globe. This means the cost of pure hosting has fallen as fast as the 
fall in server prices, dropping about 50% every year! Telecommunications costs have 
also fallen. As a result, most hosting services seek to differentiate themselves from the 
commodity hosting business by offering extensive site design, marketing, optimization, 
and other services. Small, local ISPs also can be used as hosts, but service reliability is 
an issue. Will the small ISPs be able to provide uninterrupted service, 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week, 365 days a year? Will they have service staff available when you need it?
There are several disadvantages to outsourcing hosting. If you choose a vendor, 
make sure the vendor has the capability to grow with you. You need to know what 
kinds of security provisions are in place for backup copies of your site, internal moni-
toring of activity, and security track record. Is there a public record of a security breach 
at the vendor? Most Fortune 500 firms have their own private cloud data centers so 
they can control the Web environment. On the other hand, there are risks to hosting 
your own site if you are a small business. Your costs will be higher than if you had used 
a large outsourcing firm because you don’t have the market power to obtain low-cost 
hardware and telecommunications. You will have to purchase hardware and software, 
have a physical facility, lease communications lines, hire a staff, and build security 
and backup capabilities yourself.
TESTING THE SYSTEM
Once the system has been built and programmed, you will have to engage in a testing 
process. Depending on the size of the system, this could be fairly difficult and lengthy. 
Testing is required whether the system is outsourced or built in-house. A complex 
e-commerce site can have thousands of pathways through the site, each of which must 
be documented and then tested. It is important to note that testing is generally under-
budgeted. As much as 50% of the budget can be consumed by testing and rebuilding 
(usually depending on the quality of the initial design). Unit testing involves testing 
the site’s program modules one at a time. System testing involves testing the site as 
a whole, in the same way a typical user would when using the site. Because there is 
no truly “typical” user, system testing requires that every conceivable path be tested. 
Final acceptance testing requires that the firm’s key personnel and managers in 
marketing, production, sales, and general management actually use the system as 
installed on a test Internet or intranet server. This acceptance test verifies that the 
business objectives of the system as originally conceived are in fact working. 
Another form of testing is called A/B testing (or split testing). This form of 
testing involves showing two versions (A and B) of a Web page or Web site to different 
users to see which one performs better. There are several different types of A/B testing 
that can be used for a Web site design project. A template test compares the same 
general page content using two different layouts and or design treatments. A new 
concept test compares a control page with one that is very different.  A funnel test 
compares the flow through a series of pages (such as a product page, to a registration 
page, to shopping cart page, versus skipping the registration page) to see which one

results in a higher percentage of conversions. Multivariate testing is a much more 
sophisticated form of testing than A/B testing. Multivariate testing involves identifying 
specific elements, or variables, on a Web page, such as a headline, image, button and 
text, creating versions for each element, and then creating a unique combination of 
each element and version to test. So for example, if there are three elements and two 
versions of each, there will be eight possible combinations (2*2*2 = 8) to test. When 
used correctly, multivariate testing enables designers to identify the most optimal 
layout, color, content and format. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE
Most people unfamiliar with systems erroneously think that once an information system 
is installed, the process is over. In fact, while the beginning of the process is over, the 
operational life of a system is just beginning. Systems break down for a variety of 
reasons—most of them unpredictable. Therefore, they need continual checking, testing, 
and repair. Systems maintenance is vital, but sometimes not budgeted for. In general, 
the annual system maintenance cost will roughly parallel the development cost. An 
e-commerce site that cost €32,000 to develop is likely to require a €32,000 annual expen-
diture to maintain. Very large e-commerce sites experience some economies of scale, 
so that, for example, a site that cost €1 million to develop is likely to require an annual 
maintenance budget of perhaps half to three-quarters of that cost.
Why does it cost so much to maintain an e-commerce site? Unlike payroll systems, 
for example, e-commerce sites are always in a process of change, improvement, and 
correction. Studies of traditional systems maintenance have found 20% of the time 
is devoted to debugging code and responding to emergency situations (for example, 
a new server was installed by your ISP, and all your hypertext links were lost and 
CGI scripts disabled—the site is down!). Another 20% of the time is concerned with 
changes in reports, data files, and links to backend databases. The remaining 60% of 
maintenance time is devoted to general administration (making product and price 
changes in the catalog) and making changes and enhancements to the system. E-com-
merce sites are never finished: they are always in the process of being built and rebuilt. 
They are dynamic—much more so than payroll systems.
The long-term success of an e-commerce site will depend on a dedicated team of 
employees (the Web team) whose sole job is to monitor and adapt the site to changing 
market conditions. The Web team must be multi-skilled; it will typically include program-
mers, designers, and business managers drawn from marketing, production, and sales 
support. One of the first tasks of the Web team is to listen to customers’ feedback on the 
site and respond to that feedback as necessary. A second task is to develop a systematic 
monitoring and testing plan to be followed weekly to ensure all the links are operating, 
prices are correct, and pages are updated. A large business may have thousands of Web 
pages, many of them linked, that require systematic monitoring. Other important tasks 
of the Web team include benchmarking (a process in which the site is compared with 
those of competitors in terms of response speed, quality of layout, and design) and 
keeping the site current on pricing and promotions. The Web is a competitive environ-
ment where you can very rapidly frustrate and lose customers with a dysfunctional site.

FACTORS IN OPTIMIZING WEB SITE PERFORMANCE
The purpose of a Web site is to deliver content to customers and to complete transac-
tions. The faster and more reliably these two objectives are met, the more effective the 
Web site is from a commerce perspective. If you are a manager or marketing executive, 
you will want the Web site operating in a way that fulfills customers’ expectations. 
You’ll have to make sure the Web site is optimized to achieve this business objective. 
The optimization of Web site performance is more complicated than it seems and 
involves at least three factors: page content, page generation, and page delivery (see 
Figure 3.10). In this chapter, we describe the software and hardware choices you will 
need to make in building an e-commerce site; these are also important factors in Web 
site optimization.
Using efficient styles and techniques for page design and content can reduce 
response times by two to five seconds. Simple steps include reducing unnecessary 
HTML comments and white space, using more efficient graphics, and avoiding unnec-
essary links to other pages in the site. Page generation speed can be enhanced by 
segregating computer servers to perform dedicated functions (such as static page 
generation, application logic, media servers, and database servers), and using various 
devices from vendors to speed up these servers. Using a single server or multiple 
servers to perform multiple tasks reduces throughput by more than 50%. Page delivery 
can be speeded up by using specialized content delivery networks such as Akamai, 
or by increasing local bandwidth. We will discuss some of these factors throughout 
the chapter, but a full discussion of optimizing Web site performance is beyond the 
scope of this text.

CHOOSING SOFTWARE
Along with telecommunications, software and hardware constitute the infrastructure of 
an e-commerce presence. As a business manager in charge of creating an e-commerce 
presence, you will need to know some basic information about both.
SIMPLE VERSUS MULTI-TIERED WEB SITE ARCHITECTURE
Prior to the development of e-commerce, Web sites simply delivered Web pages to 
users who were making requests through their browsers for HTML pages with 
content of various sorts. Web site software was appropriately quite simple—it con-
sisted of a server computer running basic Web server software. We might call this 
arrangement a single-tier system architecture. System architecture refers to the 
arrangement of software, machinery, and tasks in an information system needed to 
achieve a specific functionality (much like a home’s architecture refers to the 
arrangement of building materials to achieve a particular functionality). Many Web 
sites started this way—there are no monetary transactions. Tens of thousands of sites 
still perform this way. Orders can always be called in by telephone and not taken 
online.
However, the development of e-commerce required a great deal more interactive 
functionality, such as the ability to respond to user input (name and address forms), 
take customer orders for goods and services, clear credit card transactions on the fly, 
consult price and product databases, and even adjust advertising on the screen based 
on user characteristics. This kind of extended functionality required the develop-
ment of Web application servers and a multi-tiered system architecture to handle the 
processing loads. Web application servers, described more fully later in this section, are 
specialized software programs that perform a wide variety of transaction processing 
required by e-commerce.
In addition to having specialized application servers, e-commerce sites must be 
able to pull information from and add information to pre-existing corporate databases. 
These older databases that predate the e-commerce era are called backend or legacy 
databases. Corporations have made massive investments in these systems to store 
their information on customers, products, employees, and vendors. These backend 
systems constitute an additional layer in a multi-tiered site.
Figure 3.11 illustrates a simple two-tier and a more complex multi-tier e-com-
merce site architecture. In two-tier architecture, a Web server responds to requests 
for Web pages and a database server provides backend data storage. In a multi-tier 
architecture, in contrast, the Web server is linked to a middle-tier layer that typically 
includes a series of application servers that perform specific tasks, as well as to a 
backend layer of existing corporate systems containing product, customer, and pricing 
information. A multi-tiered site typically employs several physical computers, each 
running some of the software applications and sharing the workload across many 
physical computers.
The remainder of this section describes basic Web server software functionality 
and the various types of Web application servers.

WEB SERVER SOFTWARE
All e-commerce sites require basic Web server software to answer requests from cus-
tomers for HTML and XML pages.
When you choose Web server software, you will also be choosing an operating 
system for your site’s computers. Apache, which works with Linux and Unix operat-
ing systems, is the leading Web server software (Netcraft, 2015). Unix is the original 
programming language of the Internet and Web, and Linux is a derivative of Unix 
designed for the personal computer. Apache was developed by a worldwide commu-
nity of Internet innovators. Apache is free and can be downloaded from many sites 
on the Web; it also comes installed on most IBM Web servers. Literally thousands of 
In a multi-tier architecture, a Web server is linked to a middle-tier layer that typically includes a 
series of application servers that perform specific tasks, as well as to a backend layer of existing 
corporate systems.
In a two-tier architecture, a Web server responds to requests for Web pages and a database server 
provides backend data storage.

programmers have worked on Apache over the years; thus, it is extremely stable. There 
are thousands of utility software programs written for Apache that can provide all the 
functionality required for a contemporary e-commerce site. In order to use Apache, 
you will need staff that is knowledgeable in Unix or Linux.
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is another popular type of Web server 
software. IIS is based on the Windows operating system and is compatible with a wide 
selection of Microsoft utility and support programs. 
There are also at least 100 other smaller providers or open source versions of 
Web server software, most of them based on the Unix operating system. Note that the 
choice of Web server has little effect on users of your system. The pages they see will 
look the same regardless of the development environment. There are many advantages 
to the Microsoft suite of development tools—they are integrated, powerful, and easy 
to use. The Unix operating system, on the other hand, is exceptionally reliable and 
stable, and there is a worldwide open software community that develops and tests 
Unix-based Web server software.
Table 3.4 shows the basic functionality provided by all Web servers.
Site Management Tools
In Chapter 2, we described most of the basic functionality of the Web servers listed in 
Table 3.4. Another functionality not described previously is site management tools. Site 
management tools are essential if you want to keep your site working, and if you want 
to understand how well it is working. Site management tools verify that links on pages 
are still valid and also identify orphan files, or files on the site that are not linked to any 
pages. By surveying the links on a Web site, a site management tool can quickly report 
on potential problems and errors that users may encounter. Your customers will not be 
impressed if they encounter a “404 Error: Page Does Not Exist” message on your Web 
site. Links to URLs that have moved or been deleted are called dead links; these can

cause error messages for users trying to access that link. Regularly checking that all 
links on a site are operational helps prevent irritation and frustration in users who may 
decide to take their business elsewhere to a better functioning site.
Even more importantly, site management tools can help you understand con-
sumer behavior on your Web site. Site management software and services, such as 
those provided by Webtrends, can be purchased in order to more effectively monitor 
customer purchases and marketing campaign effectiveness, as well as keep track of 
standard hit counts and page visit information. Figure 3.12 shows a screenshot that 
illustrates Webtrends Analytics 10.
Dynamic Page Generation Tools
One of the most important innovations in Web site operation has been the develop-
ment of dynamic page generation tools. Prior to the development of e-commerce, 
Web sites primarily delivered unchanging static content in the form of HTML pages. 
	 FIGURE 3.12

While this capability might be sufficient to display pictures of products, consider all 
the elements of a typical e-commerce site today by reviewing Table 3.2 (on page 185), 
or visit what you believe is an excellent e-commerce site. The content of successful 
e-commerce sites is always changing, often day by day. There are new products and 
promotions, changing prices, news events, and stories of successful users. E-commerce 
sites must intensively interact with users who not only request pages but also request 
product, price, availability, and inventory information. One of the most dynamic 
sites is eBay—the auction site. There, the content is changing minute by minute. 
E-commerce sites are just like real markets—they are dynamic. News sites, where 
stories change constantly, also are dynamic.
The dynamic and complex nature of e-commerce sites requires a number of 
specialized software applications in addition to static HTML pages. Perhaps one of the 
most important is dynamic page generation software. With dynamic page genera-
tion, the contents of a Web page are stored as objects in a database, rather than being 
hard-coded in HTML. When the user requests a Web page, the contents for that page 
are then fetched from the database. The objects are retrieved from the database using 
Common Gateway Interface (CGI), Active Server Pages (ASP), Java Server Pages (JSP), 
or other server-side programs. CGI, ASP, and JSP are described in the last section of 
this chapter. This technique is much more efficient than working directly in HTML 
code. It is much easier to change the contents of a database than it is to change the 
coding of an HTML page. A standard data access method called Open Database Con-
nectivity (ODBC) makes it possible for applications written in the C programming 
language to access data from any database regardless of the database and operating 
system software being used via an ODBC driver that serves as a translator between 
the application and the database. ODBC drivers are available for most of the major 
database management systems offered by companies such as Oracle, SAP, Sybase, and 
IBM. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a version of ODBC that provides connectiv-
ity between applications written in the Java programming language and a wide range 
of databases. However, while ODBC remains the de facto standard for cross-platform 
data access, today many web development platforms provide functionality that allows 
a programmer to directly link to a target database, making ODBC/JDBC drivers 
unnecessary. 
Dynamic page generation gives e-commerce several significant capabilities that 
generate cost and profitability advantages over traditional commerce. Dynamic page 
generation lowers menu costs (the costs incurred by merchants for changing product 
descriptions and prices). Dynamic page generation also permits easy online market 
segmentation—the ability to sell the same product to different markets. For instance, 
you might want variations on the same banner ad depending on how many times 
the customer has seen the ad. In the first exposure to a car ad, you might want to 
emphasize brand identification and unique features. On the second viewing you might 
want to emphasize superlatives like “most family friendly” to encourage comparison 
to other brands. The same capability makes possible nearly cost-free price discrimina-
tion—the ability to sell the same product to different customers at different prices. For 
instance, you might want to sell the same product to corporations and government

agencies but use different marketing themes. Based on a cookie you place on client 
computers, or in response to a question on your site that asks visitors if they are from 
a government agency or a corporation, you would be able to use different marketing 
and promotional materials for corporate clients and government clients. You might 
want to reward loyal customers with lower prices, say on DVDs or musical tracks, and 
charge full price to first-time buyers. Dynamic page generation allows you to approach 
different customers with different messages and prices.
Dynamic page generation also enables the use of a content management system 
(CMS). As previously described, a CMS is used to create and manage Web content. A 
CMS separates the design and presentation of content (such as HTML documents, 
images, video, audio) from the content creation process. The content is maintained in 
a database and dynamically linked to the Web site. A CMS usually includes templates 
that can be automatically applied to new and existing content, WYSIWYG editing tools 
that make it easy to edit and describe (tag) content, and collaboration, workflow, and 
document management tools. Typically, an experienced programmer is needed to 
install the system, but thereafter, content can be created and managed by non-technical 
staff. There are a wide range of commercial CMSs available, from top-end enterprise 
systems offered by HP Autonomy, EMC Documentum, OpenText, IBM, Adobe, and 
Oracle, to mid-market systems by Sitecore, PaperThin, and EPiServer, as well as hosted 
software as a service (SaaS) versions by Clickability (Upland) and CrownPeak Technol-
ogy among others. There are also several open source content management systems 
available, such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, OpenCms, and others.
APPLICATION SERVERS
Web application servers are software programs that provide the specific business 
functionality required of a Web site. The basic idea of application servers is to isolate 
the business applications from the details of displaying Web pages to users on the front 
end and the details of connecting to databases on the back end. Application servers 
are a kind of middleware software that provides the glue connecting traditional cor-
porate systems to the customer as well as all the functionality needed to conduct 
e-commerce. In the early years, a number of software firms developed specific sepa-
rate programs for each function, but increasingly, these specific programs are being 
replaced by integrated software tools that combine all the needed functionality for an 
e-commerce site into a single development environment, a packaged software 
approach.
Table 3.5 illustrates the wide variety of application servers available in the mar-
ketplace. The table focuses on “sell-side” servers that are designed to enable selling 
products on the Web. So-called “buy-side” and “link” servers focus on the needs of 
businesses to connect with partners in their supply chains or find suppliers for specific 
parts and assemblies. There are several thousand software vendors that provide appli-
cation server software. For Linux and Unix environments, many of these capabilities 
are available free on the Internet from various sites. Most businesses—faced with this 
bewildering array of choices—choose to use integrated software tools called merchant 
server software.

E-COMMERCE MERCHANT SERVER SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY
E-commerce merchant server software provides the basic functionality needed for 
online sales, including an online catalog, order taking via an online shopping cart, and 
online credit card processing.
Online Catalog
A company that wants to sell products on the Web must have a list, or online catalog, 
of its products, available on its Web site. Merchant server software typically includes 
a database capability that will allow for construction of a customized online catalog. 
The complexity and sophistication of the catalog will vary depending on the size of 
the company and its product lines. Small companies, or companies with small product 
lines, may post a simple list with text descriptions and perhaps color photos. A larger

site might decide to add sound, animations, or videos (useful for product demonstra-
tions) to the catalog, or interactivity, such as customer service representatives available 
via instant messaging to answer questions. Today, larger firms make extensive use of 
streaming video.
Shopping Cart
Online shopping carts are much like their real-world equivalent; both allow shoppers 
to set aside desired purchases in preparation for checkout. The difference is that the 
online variety is part of a merchant server software program residing on the Web 
server, and allows consumers to select merchandise, review what they have selected, 
edit their selections as necessary, and then actually make the purchase by clicking a 
button. The merchant server software automatically stores shopping cart data.
Credit Card Processing
A site’s shopping cart typically works in conjunction with credit card processing soft-
ware, which verifies the shopper’s credit card and then puts through the debit to the 
card and the credit to the company’s account at checkout. Integrated e-commerce soft-
ware suites typically supply the software for this function. Otherwise, you will have to 
make arrangements with a variety of credit card processing banks and intermediaries.
MERCHANT SERVER SOFTWARE PACKAGES (E-COMMERCE SOFTWARE 
PLATFORMS)
Rather than build your site from a collection of disparate software applications, it is 
easier, faster, and generally more cost-effective to purchase a merchant server soft-
ware package (also called an e-commerce software platform). Merchant server 
software offers an integrated environment that promises to provide most or all of the 
functionality and capabilities you will need to develop a sophisticated, customer-
centric site. An important element of merchant sofware packages is a built-in shopping 
cart that can display merchandise, manage orders, and clear credit card transactions. 
E-commerce software platforms come in three general ranges of price and 
functionality.
While existing firms often have the financial capital to invest in commercial mer-
chant server software, many small firms and start-up firms do not. There are really 
two options here, the key factor being how much programming experience and time 
you have. One option is to utilize the e-commerce merchant services provided by sites 
such as Yahoo Stores. For instance, for $26 a month and a 1.5% transaction fee for each 
transaction processed through the store, Yahoo Stores Basic makes it easy to create 
an e-commerce Web site with customizable templates. An e-commerce template is a 
predesigned Web site that allows users to customize the look and feel of the site to fit 
their business needs and provides a standard set of functionalities. Most templates 
today contain ready-to-go site designs with built-in e-commerce functionality like 
shopping carts, payment clearance, and site management tools. Yahoo Stores also 
includes a mobile storefront, search engine optimization tools, social media support,

and a variety of other marketing tools. Many others, such as Bigcommerce, Homestead, 
Vendio, and Shopify offer similar services. 
If you have considerable, or at least some, programming background, you can 
consider open source merchant server software. Open source software is software 
developed by a community of programmers and designers, and is free to use and 
modify. Table 3.6 provides a description of some open source options. The advantage 
of using open source Web building tools is that you get exactly what you want, a truly 
customized unique Web site. The disadvantage is that it will take several months for 
a single programmer to develop the site and get all the tools to work together seam-
lessly. How many months do you want to wait before you get to market with your 
ideas? 
Midrange e-commerce software platforms include IBM WebSphere Commerce 
Express Edition and Sitecore Commerce Server (formerly Microsoft Commerce Server). 
High-end enterprise solutions for large global firms are provided by IBM Websphere 
Professional and Enterprise Editions, IBM Commerce on Cloud, Oracle ATG Web 
Commerce, Demandware, Magento, NetSuite, and others. Many of these e-commerce 
software platforms are now available on a Software as a Service (SaaS) basis, a model

Django are other popular open source Web application 
frameworks.
Analytics
Analytics keep track of your site’s customer activities 
and the success of your Web advertising campaign. 
You can also use Google Analytics if you advertise on 
Google, which provides good tracking tools; most 
hosting services will provide these services as well. 
Other open source analytic tools include Piwik, 
CrawlTrack, and Open Web Analytics.

in which the software is hosted in the cloud and run by the client via a Web browser. 
This model enables a firm to launch an e-commerce site very quickly. For instance, 
Williams-Sonoma, a housewares retail chain in the United States, used Web-hosted 
e-commerce software from NetSuite to launch an e-commerce site in Australia in only 
3 months time (Dusto, 2014). There are several hundred software firms that provide 
e-commerce software, which raises the costs of making sensible decisions on this 
matter. 
Choosing an E-commerce Software Platform
With all of these vendors, how do you choose the right one? Evaluating these tools 
and making a choice is one of the most important and uncertain decisions you will 
make in building an e-commerce site. The real costs are hidden—they involve training 
your staff to use the tools and integrating the tools into your business processes and 
organizational culture. The following are some of the key factors to consider:
•	 Functionality, including availability on an SaaS basis
•	 Support for different business models, including m-commerce
•	 Business process modeling tools
•	 Visual site management tools and reporting
•	 Performance and scalability
•	 Connectivity to existing business systems
•	 Compliance with standards
•	 Global and multicultural capability
•	 Local sales tax and shipping rules
For instance, although e-commerce software platforms promise to do everything, 
your business may require special functionality—such as streaming audio and video. 
You will need a list of business functionality requirements. Your business may involve 
several different business models—such as a retail side and a business-to-business 
side; you may run auctions for stock excess as well as fixed-price selling. Be sure the 
package can support all of your business models. You may wish to change your busi-
ness processes, such as order taking and order fulfillment. Does the platform contain 
tools for modeling business process and work flows? Understanding how your site 
works will require visual reporting tools that make its operation transparent to many 
different people in your business. A poorly designed software package will drop off 
significantly in performance as visitors and transactions expand into the thousands 
per hour, or minute. Check for performance and scalability by stress-testing a pilot 
edition or obtaining data from the vendor about performance under load. You will have 
to connect the e-commerce platform to your traditional business systems. How will 
this connection to existing systems be made, and is your staff skilled in making the 
connection? Because of the changing technical environment—in particular, changes 
in m-commerce platforms—it is important to document exactly what standards the 
platform supports now, and what the migration path will be toward the future. Finally, 
your e-commerce site may have to work both globally and locally. You may need a

foreign language edition using foreign currency denominations. And you will have 
to collect sales taxes across many local, regional, and national tax systems. Does the 
e-commerce platform support this level of globalization and localization?
	 3.4	
CHOOSING HARDWARE
Whether you host your own site or outsource the hosting and operation of your site, 
you will need to understand certain aspects of the computing hardware platform. The 
hardware platform refers to all the underlying computing equipment that the 
system uses to achieve its e-commerce functionality. Your objective is to have enough 
platform capacity to meet peak demand (avoiding an overload condition), but not so 
much platform that you are wasting money. Failing to meet peak demand can mean 
your site is slow, or actually crashes. How much computing and telecommunications 
capacity is enough to meet peak demand? How many hits per day can your site 
sustain?
To answer these questions, you will need to understand the various factors that 
affect the speed, capacity, and scalability of an e-commerce site.
RIGHT-SIZING YOUR HARDWARE PLATFORM: THE DEMAND SIDE
The most important factor affecting the speed of your site is the demand that cus-
tomers put on the site. Table 3.7 lists the most important factors to consider when 
estimating the demand on a site.
Demand on a Web site is fairly complex and depends primarily on the type of site 
you are operating. The number of simultaneous users in peak periods, the nature of 
customer requests, the type of content, the required security, the number of items 
in inventory, the number of page requests, and the speed of legacy applications that 
may be needed to supply data to the Web pages are all important factors in overall 
demand on a Web site system.
Certainly, one important factor to consider is the number of simultaneous users 
who will likely visit your site. In general, the load created by an individual customer 
on a server is typically quite limited and short-lived. A Web session initiated by the 
typical user is stateless, meaning that the server does not have to maintain an ongoing, 
dedicated interaction with the client. A Web session typically begins with a page 
request, then a server replies, and the session is ended. The sessions may last from 
tenths of a second to a minute per user. Nevertheless, system performance does 
degrade as more and more simultaneous users request service. Fortunately, degrada-
tion (measured as “transactions per second” and “latency” or delay in response) is 
fairly graceful over a wide range, up until a peak load is reached and service quality 
becomes unacceptable (see Figure 3.13 on page 208).
Serving up static Web pages is I/O intensive, which means it requires input/
output (I/O) operations rather than heavy-duty processing power. As a result, Web 
site performance is constrained primarily by the server’s I/O limitations and the 
telecommunications connection, rather than the speed of the processor.

Other factors to consider when estimating the demand on a Web site are the 
user profile and the nature of the content. If users request searches, registration 
forms, and order taking via shopping carts, then demands on processors will increase 
markedly.
RIGHT-SIZING YOUR HARDWARE PLATFORM: THE SUPPLY SIDE
Once you estimate the likely demand on your site, you will need to consider how to 
scale up your site to meet demand. We have already discussed one solution that 
requires very little thought: outsource the hosting of your Web site to a cloud-based 
service. You can also engage the services of a content delivery network (CDN) such 
as Akamai. See Chapter 2 for a discussion of cloud-based computing services and a

case study on Akamai. However, if you decide to host your own Web site, scalability 
is an important consideration. Scalability refers to the ability of a site to increase in 
size as demand warrants. There are three steps you can take to meet the demands for 
service at your site: scale hardware vertically, scale hardware horizontally, and/or 
improve the processing architecture of the site (see Table 3.8). Vertical scaling refers 
to increasing the processing power of individual components. Horizontal scaling 
refers to employing multiple computers to share the workload and increase the “foot-
print” of the installation (IBM, 2002).
You can scale your site vertically by upgrading the servers from a single processor 
to multiple processors. You can keep adding processors to a computer depending on 
the operating system and upgrade to faster chip speeds as well.
There are two drawbacks to vertical scaling. First, it can become expensive to 
purchase additional processors with every growth cycle, and second, your entire site 
becomes dependent on a small number of very powerful computers. If you have two 
such computers and one goes down, half of your site, or perhaps your entire site, may 
become unavailable.
Horizontal scaling involves adding multiple single-processor servers to your site 
and balancing the load among the servers. You can then partition the load so some 
servers handle only requests for HTML or ASP pages, while others are dedicated to 
handling database applications. You will need special load-balancing software (provided 
by a variety of vendors such as Cisco, Microsoft, and IBM) to direct incoming requests 
to various servers.
There are many advantages to horizontal scaling. It is inexpensive and often can 
be accomplished using older PCs that otherwise would be disposed of. Horizontal 
scaling also introduces redundancy—if one computer fails, chances are that another 
computer can pick up the load dynamically. However, when your site grows from a 
single computer to perhaps 10 to 20 computers, the size of the physical facility required 
(the “footprint”) increases and there is added management complexity.

A third alternative—improving the processing architecture—is a combination of 
vertical and horizontal scaling, combined with artful design decisions. Table 3.9 lists 
some of the more common steps you can take to greatly improve performance of your 
site. Most of these steps involve splitting the workload into I/O-intensive activities 
(such as serving Web pages) and CPU-intensive activities (such as taking orders). Once 
you have this work separated, you can fine-tune the servers for each type of load. One 
of the least expensive fine-tuning steps is to simply add RAM to a few servers and store 
all your HTML pages in RAM. This reduces load on your hard drives and increases 
speed dramatically. RAM is thousands of times faster than hard disks, and RAM is 
inexpensive. The next most important step is to move your CPU-intensive activities, 
such as order taking, onto a high-end, multiple-processor server that is dedicated to 
handling orders and accessing the necessary databases. Taking these steps can permit 
you to reduce the number of servers required to service 10,000 concurrent users from 
100 down to 20, according to one estimate.

OTHER E-COMMERCE SITE TOOLS
Now that you understand the key factors affecting the speed, capacity, and scalability 
of your Web site, we can consider some other important requirements. You will need 
a coherent Web site design that makes business sense—not necessarily a site to wow 
visitors or excite them, but to sell them something. You will also need to know how 
to build active content and interactivity into your site—not just display static HTML 
pages. You must be able to track customers who come, leave, and return to your site 
in order to be able to greet return visitors (“Hi Sarah, welcome back!”). You will also 
want to track customers throughout your site so you can personalize and customize 
their experience. You will definitely want the ability for customers to generate content 
and feedback on your site to increase their engagement with your brand. Finally, you

will need to establish a set of information policies for your site—privacy, accessibility, 
and access to information policies.
In order to achieve these business capabilities, you will need to be aware of some 
design guidelines and additional software tools that can cost-effectively achieve the 
required business functionality.
WEB SITE DESIGN: BASIC BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS
This is not a text about how to design Web sites. (In Chapter 6, we discuss Web 
site design issues from a marketing perspective.) Nevertheless, from a business 
manager’s perspective, there are certain design objectives you must communicate 
to your Web site designers to let them know how you will evaluate their work. At 
a minimum, your customers will need to find what they need at your site, make a 
purchase, and leave. A Web site that annoys customers runs the risk of losing the 
customer forever. See Table 3.10 for a list of the most common consumer complaints 
about Web sites.
Some critics believe poor design is more common than good design. It appears 
easier to describe what irritates people about Web sites than to describe how to design 
a good Web site. The worst e-commerce sites make it difficult to find information about 
their products and make it complicated to purchase goods; they have missing pages 
and broken links, a confusing navigation structure, and annoying graphics or sounds 
that you cannot turn off. Table 3.11 restates these negative experiences as positive 
goals for Web site design.
TOOLS FOR SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
A Web site is only as valuable from a business perspective as the number of people 
who visit. The first stop for most customers looking for a product or service is to start 
with a search engine, and follow the listings on the page, usually starting with the 
top three to five listings, then glancing to the sponsored ads to the right. The higher 
you are on the search engine pages, the more traffic you will receive. Page 1 is much 
better than Page 2. So how do you get to Page 1 in the natural (unpaid) search listings? 
•	 Requiring user to view ad or Flash introduction 
before going to Web site content
•	 Pop-up and pop-under ads and windows
•	 Too many clicks to get to the content
•	 Links that don’t work
•	 Confusing navigation; no search function
•	 Requirement to register and log in before 
viewing content or ordering
•	 Slow loading pages
•	 Content that is out of date
•	 Inability to use browser’s Back button
•	 No contact information available 
(Web form only)
•	 Unnecessary splash/flash screens, 
animation, etc.
•	 Music or other audio that plays automatically
•	 Unprofessional design elements
•	 Text not easily legible due to size, color, format
•	 Typographical errors
•	 No or unclear returns policy

While every search engine is different, and none of them publish their algorithms for 
ranking pages, there are some basic ideas that work well:
•	 Metatags, titles, page contents: Search engines “crawl” your site and identify 
keywords as well as title pages and then index them for use in search arguments. 
Pepper your pages with keywords that accurately describe what you say you do 
in your metatag site “description” and “keywords” sections of your source code. 
Experiment: use different keywords to see which work. “Vintage cars” may attract 
more visitors than “antique cars” or “restored cars.”
•	 Identify market niches: Instead of marketing “jewelry,” be more specific, such 
as “Victorian jewelry,” or “1950s jewelry” to attract small, specific groups who are 
intensely interested in period jewelry and closer to purchasing.
•	 Offer expertise: White papers, industry analyses, FAQ pages, guides, and histories 
are excellent ways to build confidence on the part of users and to encourage them 
to see your Web site as the place to go for help and guidance.
•	 Get linked up: Encourage other sites to link to your site; build a blog that attracts 
people and who will share your URL with others and post links in the process. List 
your site with Yahoo Directory. Build a Facebook page for your company, and think 
about using Twitter to develop a following or fan base for your products.
•	 Buy ads: Complement your natural search optimization efforts with paid search 
engine keywords and ads. Choose your keywords and purchase direct exposure on 
Web pages. You can set your budget and put a ceiling on it to prevent large losses. 
See what works, and observe the number of visits to your site produced by each 
keyword string.
•	 Local e-commerce: Developing a national market can take a long time. If your 
Web site is particularly attractive to local people, or involves products sold locally, 
use keywords that connote your location so people can find you nearby. Town, city,

and region names in your keywords can be helpful, such as “Vermont cheese” or 
“San Francisco blues music.”
TOOLS FOR INTERACTIVITY AND ACTIVE CONTENT
The more interactive a Web site is, the more effective it will be in generating sales and 
encouraging return visitors. Although functionality and ease of use are the supreme 
objectives in site design, you will also want to interact with users and present them 
with a lively, “active” experience. You will want to personalize the experience for 
customers by addressing their individual needs, and customize the content of your 
offerings based on their behavior or expressed desires. In order to achieve these 
business objectives, you will need to consider carefully the tools necessary to build 
these capabilities. Simple interactions such as a customer submitting a name, along 
with more complex interactions involving credit cards, user preferences, and user 
responses to prompts, all require special programs. The following sections provide a 
brief description of some commonly used software tools for achieving high levels of 
site interactivity.
Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a set of standards for communication between 
a browser and a program running on a server that allows for interaction between the 
user and the server. CGI permits an executable program to access all the information 
within incoming requests from clients. The program can then generate all the output 
required to make up the return page (the HTML, script code, text, etc.), and send it 
back to the client via the Web server. For instance, if a user clicks the My Shopping 
Cart button, the server receives this request and executes a CGI program. The CGI 
program retrieves the contents of the shopping cart from the database and returns it 
to the server. The server sends an HTML page that displays the contents of the shop-
ping cart on the user’s screen. Notice that all the computing takes place on the server 
side (this is why CGI programs and others like it are referred to as “server-side” 
programs).
CGI programs can be written in nearly any programming language as long as 
they conform to CGI standards. Currently, Perl is one of the most popular languages 
for CGI scripting. Generally, CGI programs are used with Unix servers. CGI’s primary 
disadvantage is that it is not highly scalable because a new process must be created 
for each request, thereby limiting the number of concurrent requests that can be 
handled. CGI scripts are best used for small to medium-sized applications that do not 
involve a high volume of user traffic. There are also Web server extensions available, 
such as FastCGI, that improve CGI’s scalability and SCGI, which is a simpler version 
of FastCGI (Doyle and Lopes, 2005).
CGI scripts also face security issues. In 2014, a major security hole in the com-
mand-line shell used by many Linux and Unix operating systems was discovered. 
Nicknamed Shellshock, the hole allowed hackers to target vulnerable CGI scripts on 
Apache Web servers. These types of security issues have resulted in some Web hosting 
services, such as Rackspace, requiring their customers to use alternatives to CGI.

Active Server Pages (ASP) and ASP.NET
Active Server Pages (ASP) is Microsoft’s original version of server-side programming 
for Windows. Invented by Microsoft in late 1996, ASP grew rapidly to become the 
major technique for server-side Web programming in the Windows environment. ASP 
enables developers to easily create and open records from a database and execute 
programs within an HTML page, as well as handle all the various forms of interactivity 
found on e-commerce sites. Like CGI, ASP permits an interaction to take place between 
the browser and the server. ASP uses the same standards as CGI for communication 
with the browser. ASP programs are restricted to use on Windows servers running 
Microsoft’s IIS Web server software. ASP.NET, first released in January 2002, and part 
of Microsoft’s .NET framework, is the successor to ASP. As of September 2015, ASP.NET 
3.6 is the most current version of ASP.NET. ASP.NET 5, a major rewrite aimed at provid-
ing an improved, modern, cross-platform Web framework for cloud and regular applica-
tion servers, is also under development.
Java, Java Server Pages (JSP), and JavaScript
Java is a programming language that allows programmers to create interactivity and 
active content on the client computer, thereby saving considerable load on the server. 
Java was initially developed by Sun Microsystems as a platform-independent program-
ming language for consumer electronics. The idea was to create a language whose 
programs (so-called Write Once Run Anywhere [WORA] programs) could operate on 
any computer regardless of operating system. This would be possible if every operating 
system at the time (Macintosh, Windows, Unix, DOS, and mainframe MVS systems) 
had a Java Virtual Machine (VM) installed that would interpret the Java programs for 
that environment.
By 1995, however, when Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0, the first public 
version of the language, it had become clear that Java was more applicable to the 
Web than to consumer electronics. Java programs (known as Java applets) could be 
downloaded to the client over the Web and executed entirely on the client’s com-
puter. Applet tags could be included in an HTML page. To enable this, each browser 
would have to include a Java VM. Today, the leading browsers include a VM to run 
Java programs and according to Oracle, which inherited oversight over Java when it 
acquired Sun Microsystems, Java is used on 97% of enterprise desktop computers. 
When the browser accesses a page with an applet, a request is sent to the server to 
download and execute the program and allocate page space to display the results 
of the program. Java can be used to display interesting graphics, create interactive 
environments (such as a mortgage calculator), and directly access the Web server. 
JDK (Java Development Kit) 8 and the Java SE 8 Runtime Environment (for running 
Java applications) were released in 2014, and Java 9, which reportedly will focus on 
modularization of the platform, is expected to be released in 2016. Today, Java remains 
one of the most popular programming languages, with many critical technologies, 
such as the Google Android mobile platform (although not Apple’s iOS), leveraging 
aspects of the language. However, Java does face some challenges. In recent years, it 
has been plagued by security flaws, which Oracle has been attempting to address with 
the frequent release of new versions and security patches (Krill, 2015).

215
Java Server Pages (JSP), like CGI and ASP, is a Web page coding standard that 
allows developers to use a combination of HTML, JSP scripts, and Java to dynamically 
generate Web pages in response to user requests. JSP uses Java “servlets,” small Java 
programs that are specified in the Web page and run on the Web server to modify the 
Web page before it is sent to the user who requested it. JSP is supported by most of 
the popular application servers on the market today.
JavaScript is a programming language invented by Netscape that is used to 
control the objects on an HTML page and handle interactions with the browser. It is 
most commonly used on the client side to handle verification and validation of user 
input, as well as to implement business logic. For instance, JavaScript can be used on 
customer registration forms to confirm that a valid phone number, zip code, or even 
e-mail address has been given. Before a user finishes completing a form, the e-mail 
address given can be tested for validity. JavaScript appears to be much more acceptable 
to corporations and other environments in large part because it is more stable and 
also it is restricted to the operation of requested HTML pages. JavaScript is also used 
as part of Node.js, a cross-platform environment for server-side applications (including 
mobile), which has been used by companies such as PayPal, Walmart, and LinkedIn. 
In September 2015, Node.js v4.0 was released, combining Node.js and io.js, a variant 
of the JavaScript platform built on V8, the JavaScript virtual machine used in Google 
Chrome, into a single codebase for the first time. Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and 
XML) uses a variety of different tools, including JavaScript, to allow Web pages to be 
updated asynchronously (i.e., updating only parts of the page rather than having to 
reload the entire page to change just part of the content).
ActiveX and VBScript
Microsoft invented the ActiveX programming language to compete with Java and 
VBScript to compete with JavaScript. When a browser receives an HTML page with 
an ActiveX control (comparable to a Java applet), the browser simply executes the 
program. Unlike Java, however, ActiveX has full access to all the client’s resources—
printers, networks, and hard drives. VBScript performs in the same way as JavaScript. 
ActiveX and VBScript work only if you are using Internet Explorer. Otherwise, that 
part of the screen is blank. However, the days of ActiveX and VBScript are numbered. 
Microsoft has dropped support for both in Microsoft Edge, the browser that has 
replaced Internet Explorer in the Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft believes 
that the need for ActiveX and VBScript has been significantly reduced given the capa-
bilities of HTML5, and that eliminating them will enhance browser security.
ColdFusion
ColdFusion is an integrated server-side environment for developing interactive Web 
and mobile applications. Originally developed by Macromedia and now offered by 
Adobe, ColdFusion combines an intuitive tag-based scripting language and a tag-based 
server scripting language (CFML) that lowers the cost of creating interactive features. 
ColdFusion offers a powerful set of visual design, programming, debugging, and 
deployment tools. ColdFusion 11, the most recent version of ColdFusion, was released 
in 2015 and provides enhanced ability to create mobile apps, as well as a number of

new security features and programming language enhancements, as well as increased 
support for interoperability.
PHP, Ruby on Rails (RoR), and Django
PHP is an open source, general purpose scripting language that is most frequently 
used in server-side Web applications to generate dynamic Web page content, although 
it can also be used for client-side graphical user interface applications. PHP is also a 
part of many Web application development frameworks, such as CakePHP, CodeIgniter, 
and others, and is also part of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) open source 
Web development model for building dynamic Web sites and web applications (Perl 
and Python are sometimes substituted for PHP in some LAMP projects). According to 
W3Techs, PHP is, by far and away, the most commonly used server-side scripting 
language (used by over 80% of the Web sites whose server-side programming language 
it was able to identify), with ASP.NET a distant second, used by around 16.5%, followed 
by Java, with 3%. ColdFusion, Perl, Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript were all 
less than 1% (W3techs.com, 2015). Netcraft’s Web Server Survey has found PHP on 
over 240 million sites (Netcraft, 2014). PHP is also popular with hackers; according to 
Netcraft, nearly all phishing kits are written in PHP (Mutton, 2015).
Ruby on Rails (RoR or Rails) is an open source Web application framework 
based on the Ruby programming language. RoR is based on a philosophy known as 
convention over configuration, or coding by convention (CoC), which means that the 
framework provides a structured layout that minimizes the number of decisions that 
the programmer needs to make, thereby simplifying and speeding development. 
JavaScript and Ajax are highly integrated into RoR, which makes it easy to handle Ajax 
requests for page updates. Some well-known Web sites based on RoR include Shopify, 
Groupon, Indiegogo, and Airbnb (Codefactory, 2014).
Django is also an open source Web application framework. It is based on the 
Python programming language. Django is optimized for the creation of complex, 
database-driven Web sites. It allows for fast development, focuses on automating as 
much as possible, emphasizes the reusability of various components, and follows the 
DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) programming principle. Some well-known Web sites based 
on Django include Instagram, Pinterest, and the satirical news site, The Onion (Code-
condo, 2013). 
Other Design Elements
One easy way to pump up the energy on your Web site is to include some appropriate 
widgets (sometimes called gadgets, plug-ins, or snippets). Widgets are small chunks 
of code that execute automatically in your HTML Web page. They are prebuilt and 
many are free. Social networks and blogs use widgets to present users with content 
drawn from around the Web (news headlines from specific news sources, announce-
ments, press releases, and other routine content), calendars, clocks, weather, live TV, 
games, and other functionality. You can copy the code to an HTML Web page. You can 
find widgets at Apple’s Dashboard Widgets, Wolfram|Alpha Widgets, and SIMILE 
Widgets. There are also widgets for specific platforms such as WordPress, Amazon 
Widgets, and Pinterest’s Widget Builder.

Mashups are a little more complicated and involve pulling functionality and data 
from one program and including it in another. The most common mashup involves 
using Google Maps data and software and combining it with other data. For instance, 
if you have a local real estate Web site, you can download Google Maps and satellite 
image applications to your site so visitors can get a sense of the neighborhood. There 
are thousands of Google Map mashups, from maps of Myanmar political protests, to 
maps of the Fortune 500 companies, all with associated news stories and other content. 
Other mashups involve sports, photos, video, shopping, and news.
PERSONALIZATION TOOLS
You will definitely want to know how to treat each customer on an individual basis 
and emulate a traditional face-to-face marketplace. Personalization (the ability to treat 
people based on their personal qualities and prior history with your site) and custom-
ization (the ability to change the product to better fit the needs of the customer) are 
two key elements of e-commerce that potentially can make it nearly as powerful as 
a traditional marketplace, and perhaps even more powerful than direct mail or shop-
ping at an anonymous suburban shopping mall. Speaking directly to the customer on 
a one-to-one basis, and even adjusting the product to the customer is quite difficult 
in the usual type of mass marketing, one-size-fits-all commercial transaction that 
characterizes much of contemporary commerce.
There are a number of methods for achieving personalization and customization. 
For instance, you could personalize Web content if you knew the personal background 
of the visitor. You could also analyze the pattern of clicks and sites visited for every 
customer who enters your site. We discuss these methods in later chapters on market-
ing. The primary method for achieving personalization and customization is through 
the placement of cookie files on the user’s client computer. As we discussed in Chapter 
2, a cookie is a small text file placed on the user’s client computer that can contain 
any kind of information about the customer, such as customer ID, campaign ID, or 
purchases at the site. And then, when the user returns to the site, or indeed goes 
further into your site, the customer’s prior history can be accessed from a database. 
Information gathered on prior visits can then be used to personalize the visit and 
customize the product.
For instance, when a user returns to a site, you can read the cookie to find a cus-
tomer ID, look the ID up in a database of names, and greet the customer (“Hello Mary! 
Glad to have you return!”). You could also have stored a record of prior purchases, and 
then recommend a related product (“How about the wrench tool box now that you 
have purchased the wrenches?”). And you could think about customizing the product 
(“You’ve shown an interest in the elementary training programs for Word. We have 
a special ‘How to Study’ program for beginners in Office software. Would you like to 
see a sample copy online?”).
We further describe the use of cookies in Chapter 6.
THE INFORMATION POLICY SET
In developing an e-commerce site, you will also need to focus on the set of information 
policies that will govern the site. You will need to develop a privacy policy—a set of 
privacy policy
a set of public statements 
declaring to your customers 
how you treat their 
personal information that 
you gather on the site
accessibility rules
a set of design objectives 
that ensure disabled users 
can effectively access your 
site

public statements declaring to your customers how you treat their personal informa-
tion that you gather on the site. You also will need to establish accessibility rules—a 
set of design objectives that ensure disabled users can effectively access your site. 
There are more than 650 million people worldwide who are disabled and many of 
whom may require special help in order to be able to access computer systems (see 
Insight on Society: Designing for Accessibility). E-commerce information policies are 
described in greater depth in Chapter 8.

DEVELOPING A MOBILE WEB SITE AND BUILDING 
MOBILE APPLICATIONS
Today, building a Web site is just one part of developing an e-commerce presence. 
Given that around 2.25 billion Internet users worldwide (over 70% of all Internet users) 
access the Web at least part of the time from mobile devices, businesses today need 
to develop mobile Web sites, and mobile Web apps, native apps, or hybrid apps, in 
order to interact with customers, suppliers, and employees. Deciding which of these 
extended Web presence tools to use is a first step. 
There are different kinds of m-commerce platform offerings to consider, each with 
unique advantages and costs. A mobile Web site is a version of a regular Web site 
that is scaled down in content and navigation so that users can find what they want 
and move quickly to a decision or purchase. You can see the difference between a 
regular Web site and a mobile site by visiting the Amazon Web site from your desktop 
computer and then a smartphone or tablet computer. Amazon’s mobile site is a cleaner, 
more interactive site suitable for finger navigation, and efficient consumer decision 
making. Like traditional Web sites, mobile Web sites run on a firm’s servers, and are 
built using standard Web tools such as server-side HTML, Linux, PHP, and SQL. Like 
all Web sites, the user must be connected to the Web and performance will depend on 
bandwidth. Generally, mobile Web sites operate more slowly than traditional Web sites 
viewed on a desktop computer connected to a broadband office network. Most large 
firms today have mobile Web sites. 
A mobile Web app is an application built to run on the mobile Web browser built 
into a smartphone or tablet computer. In the case of Apple, the native browser is Safari. 
Generally it is built to mimic the qualities of a native app using HTML5 and Java. 
Mobile Web apps are specifically designed for the mobile platform in terms of screen 
size, finger navigation, and graphical simplicity. Mobile Web apps can support complex 
interactions used in games and rich media, perform real-time, on-the-fly calculations, 
and can be geo-sensitive using the smartphone’s built-in global positioning system 
(GPS) function. Mobile Web apps typically operate faster than mobile Web sites but 
not as fast as native apps.
A native app is an application designed specifically to operate using the mobile 
device’s hardware and operating system. These stand-alone programs can connect to 
the Internet to download and upload data, and can operate on this data even when 
not connected to the Internet. Download a book to an app reader, disconnect from the

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY 
About 10% of the population world-
wide has a disability that affects their 
ability to use the Internet. There are 
approximately 360 million people world-
wide with hearing loss and 285 million 
with significant vision loss. These and other dis-
abilities, such as motor and mobility impairments, 
can often be addressed with intelligent software and 
hardware design. But, for the most part, this has not 
yet occurred. As a result, the Internet and mobile 
devices are unfriendly places for many disabled. 
So how should designers build in accessibility 
for the blind? One tool is screen-reader software 
that translates text information on the screen into 
synthesized speech or Braille. A blind person navi-
gates a Web page by checking the hypertext links 
on the page, usually by jumping from link to link 
with the Tab key; the screen-reader software auto-
matically reads the highlighted text as the focus 
moves from link to link. The screen-reader software 
is looking for ASCII text, which it can convert to 
speech or Braille. Once the desired hypertext link 
has been located, the blind person presses the 
Enter key (clicks on the link) to go where the link 
points. Examples of such software include Freedom 
Scientific’s Job Access with Speech (JAWS) and 
MacForTheBlind’s VoiceOver.
There are also several simple strategies Web 
designers can use to improve accessibility. Embed-
ding text descriptions behind images is one example 
that allows screen readers to announce those 
descriptions. So instead of hearing “Image,” when 
a screen reader passes over an image, the visually 
impaired user can hear “Photo of a cruise ship 
sitting in a harbor.” Allowing users to set the color 
and font schemes also can make a difference for 
the visually impaired. Adding screen magnification 
tools and sound labels where hyperlinks appear are 
two additional ways to increase accessibility. For 
those who are hearing impaired, access to close-
captioned video with subtitles, as mandated by the 
United States’ 21st Century Communications and 
Video Accessibility Act, can also be helpful.
These are examples of “equivalent alternatives” 
that disability advocates suggest should be required 
for both visual and auditory content to ensure that 
individuals with disabilities have equal access to 
information that appears on-screen. Guidelines for 
creating accessible Web pages include ensuring that 
text and graphics are understandable when viewed 
without color, using features that enable activation 
of page elements via a variety of input devices (such 
as keyboard, head wand, and Braille reader), and 
providing clear navigation mechanisms (such as 
navigation bars or a site map) to aid users.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) issued 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
2.0 in June 2010 (final draft form) that provide 
all organizations with strategies in Web design for 
accommodating people with many different kinds 
of disabilities.
Ensuring accessibility of mobile devices has 
its own set of issues, in many instances ones that 
are even more challenging than those associated 
with the Web. There is only a limited selection of 
mobile devices with built-in accessibility features. 
The small size of the device, screen, and keypad 
presents its own problems. Third-party applications, 
such as text-to-speech/screen readers and screen 
magnifiers, are starting to become available, but 
much work still needs to be done. For instance, 
many mobile devices come equipped with voice 
control capabilities and audio alerts, which could 
be helpful to those with vision or motor difficulties, 
but in most cases, these are still limited to simple 
tasks, and do not provide access to the full function-
ality of the device. In addition, the deaf community 
cannot rely on audio content or alerts, so developers

need to provide text or other alternatives 
for auditory information. Those with impaired 
motor functionality also face great challenges 
in dealing with input to mobile devices. To deal 
with these challenges, the WC3 recommends that 
mobile content developers follow WCAG 2.0 and 
its guidelines on mobile Web best practices.
Web accessibility is not just a concern for Web 
developers or a question of technical Web standards, 
but is also a matter of government policy. Article 9 
of the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities requires that appropriate 
measures must be taken to ensure access to informa-
tion and communications technologies for persons 
with disabilities on an equal basis with others as a 
matter of basic human rights. All member states 
of the EU have signed the Convention and 25 have 
ratified it. Despite this, actual accessibility of both 
government and private Web sites remains quite low. 
For instance, a recent European Commission report 
on monitoring accessibility found that only one-third 
of the content generated by public authorities was 
accessible. In December 2015, the European Com-
mission proposed a European Accessibility Act, 
which will set accessibility requirements for certain 
products and services, including computers and 
operating systems, banking services, smartphones, 
digital television services, transportation services, 
e-books, and e-commerce. The requirements set 
forth what features must be accessible, such as a 
user interface, but do not mandate specific technical 
solutions.  
Various countries have also implemented 
accessibility legislation. In many cases, standards 
apply only to government agency Web sites and not 
private Web sites. For example, French law requires 
all French public Web sites to comply with its stan-
dard, RGAA 2.2.1, which is based on WCAG2. In 
Germany, all government Web sites must comply with 
BITV 2 (also based on WCAG 2). One exception is 
Australia, which requires non-government as well as 
government Web sites to comply with WCAG 2. In 
the United Kingdom, service providers must make 
reasonable adjustments to ensure that their Web 
sites are accessible to all users. In determining what 
is reasonable, the Statutory Code of Practice indi-
cates that factors to be taken into account include 
the service provider’s financial and other resources, 
the amount of resources already spent on making 
adjustments, and the extent of any disruption that it 
would cause the service provider. Large companies 
will clearly have a more difficult time justifying any 
failure to make their Web sites accessible. In the 
United States, several statutes, including the Reha-
bilitation Act (Section 508), the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (the ADA), and the 21st Century 
Communications and Video Accessibility Act, impose 
various obligations with respect to accessibility. 
Disability advocates are also using lawsuits 
as a way to get the ball rolling. In 2012, the Royal 
National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) brought a 
court case against BMI Baby, a British travel agency. 
BMI Baby ultimately agreed to make changes to its 
Web site to enable the blind to book flights. In the 
United States, the National Association of the Deaf 
sued Netflix, charging that its “Watch Instantly” 
feature does not provide equal access, which it must 
do as a “place of exhibition or entertainment” under 
the ADA. In 2012, a U.S. federal district court ruled 
that Web sites can be considered “public accommo-
dation,” and as such do fall under the jurisdiction of 
the ADA. Netflix ultimately settled the case, agree-
ing to caption all of its streaming videos by 2014. 
Despite these successes, however, much remains to be 
done to make Web sites, mobile sites, and apps fully 
accessible to the disabled.

Internet, and read your book. Because the various types of smartphones have different 
hardware and operating systems, apps are not “one size fits all” and therefore need to 
be developed for different mobile platforms. An Apple app that runs on an iPhone 
cannot operate on Android phones. As you learned in Chapter 2, native apps are built 
using different programming languages depending on the device for which they are 
intended, which is then compiled into binary code, and which executes extremely fast 
on mobile devices, much faster than HTML or Java-based mobile Web apps. For this 
reason, native apps are ideal for games, complex interactions, on-the-fly calculations, 
graphic manipulations, and rich media advertising.
Increasingly, developers are combining elements of native apps and mobile Web 
apps into hybrid apps. A hybrid app has many of the features of both a native app 
and a mobile Web app. Like a native app, it runs inside a native container on the 
mobile device and has access to the device’s APIs, enabling it to take advantage of 
many of the device’s features, such as a gyroscope, that are normally not accessible 
by a mobile Web app. It can also be packaged as an app for distribution from an App 
store. Like a mobile Web app, it is based on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, but uses 
the device’s browser engine to render the HTML5 and process the JavaScript locally.
PLANNING AND BUILDING A MOBILE PRESENCE
What is the “right” mobile presence for your firm? The answer depends on identifying 
the business objectives, and from these, deriving the information requirements of 
your mobile presence. The same kind of systems analysis and design (SAD) reasoning 
described earlier in the chapter is needed for planning and building a mobile presence, 
although there are important differences. 
The first step is to identify the business objectives you are trying to achieve. 
Table 3.12 illustrates the thought process for the analysis stage of building a mobile 
presence. Why are you developing a mobile presence? Is it to drive sales by creating 
hybrid app

both a native app and a 
mobile Web app

an easily browsed catalog where users can shop and purchase? Strengthen your brand 
by creating an engaging, interactive experience? Enable customers to interact with 
your customer community? How are your competitors using their mobile presence? 
Once you have a clear sense of business objectives, you will be able to describe the 
kind of system functionality that is needed and specify the information requirements 
for your mobile presence.
After you have identified the business objectives, system functionality, and 
information requirements, you can think about how to design and build the system. 
Now is the time to consider which to develop: a mobile Web site, a mobile Web app, 
or a native app. For instance, if your objective is branding or building community, a 
native app might be the best choice because it enables you to deliver a rich, interac-
tive, and immersive experience that can strengthen the emotional connection with 
the brand. Because native apps are stored locally on the device, they can be accessed 
even when the user is offline, enabling the user to more deeply engage. In addi-
tion, native apps can take advantage of the mobile device’s unique characteristics, 
such as using the gyroscope to deliver a 360-degree view. If your objective, on the 
other hand, is to create broad awareness, provide specific information on particular 
products, or drive sales, then a mobile Web site or mobile Web app makes more 
sense, because it is relatively easy and inexpensive to simply publish information to 
the mobile Web and consumers are still most comfortable completing transactions 
on the Web (although this is changing as more and more retailers add e-commerce 
functionality directly into apps). Increasingly, however, the choice will not be an 
either/or decision. Mobile apps and mobile Web sites each offer distinct benefits, 
and in most cases, the best strategy will be to plan to deliver compelling content 
across all devices.
MOBILE PRESENCE: DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
Designing a mobile presence is somewhat different from traditional desktop Web site 
design because of different hardware, software, and consumer expectations. Table 
3.13 describes some of the major differences.
Designers need to take mobile platform constraints into account when designing 
for the mobile platform. File sizes should be kept smaller and the number of files sent 
to the user reduced. Focus on a few, powerful graphics, and minimize the number of 
images sent to the user. Simplify choice boxes and lists so the user can easily scroll 
and touch-select the options. 
Mobile presence has become so important that it is fueling a growing trend to 
flip the traditional e-commerce development process and begin instead with devel-
opment of a mobile presence rather than a desktop Web site (known as mobile 
first design). Mobile first design has several advantages. Instead of creating a 
full-featured design for a desktop Web site that then needs to be scaled back, mobile 
first design focuses on creating the best possible experience given mobile platform 
constraints and then adding back elements for the desktop platform, progressively 
enhancing the functionality of the site. Proponents of mobile first design argue that 
it forces designers to focus on what is most important, and this helps create a lean 
mobile first design
beginning the e-commerce 
development process with 
a mobile presence rather 
than a desktop Web site

and efficient mobile design that functions much better than a design that begins 
with a traditional platform that must be stripped down to work on mobile. Mobile 
first design is not without its challenges, however. It can be more difficult for 
designers who are more comfortable with the more traditional process (Byers, 2013).
Other important trends in the development of mobile Web sites include responsive 
Web design and adaptive Web design. 
Responsive Web design (RWD) tools and design techniques make it possible 
to design a Web site that automatically adjusts its layout and display according to 
the screen resolution of the device on which it is being viewed, whether a desktop, 
tablet, or smartphone. RWD tools include HTML5 and CSS3 and its three key design 
principles involve using flexible grid-based layouts, flexible images and media, and 
media queries. RDW uses the same HTML code and design for each device, but uses 
CSS (which determines the layout of the Web page) to adjust the layout and display 
to the screen’s form factor. RWD sites typically work well for sites with relatively 
simple functionality (i.e., sites that primarily deliver content) and that users engage 
with in a similar manner no matter the device being used. However, using RWD 
can be costly, often requiring a complete redesign of the Web site’s interface. 
Another problem with RDW, particularly if not coupled with mobile first design, is 
that the responsive Web site still has the size and complexity of a traditional desktop 
site, sometimes making it slow to load and perform on a mobile device. Another 
technique, known as adaptive Web design, has been developed to deal with this 
issue.
With adaptive Web design (AWD) (sometimes also referred to as adaptive deliv-
ery or responsive Web design with server-side components (RESS)), the server hosting the 
Web site detects the attributes of the device making the request and, using predefined 
templates based on device screen size along with CSS and JavaScript, loads a version 
of the site that is optimized for the device. AWD has a number of advantages, including 
responsive Web design 
(RWD) 
tools and design principles 
that automatically adjust 
the layout of a Web site 
depending on the screen 
resolution of the device on 
which it is being viewed

Hardware
Mobile hardware is smaller, and there are more resource 
constraints in data storage and processing power.
Connectivity
The mobile platform is constrained by slower connection speeds 
than desktop Web sites.
Displays
Mobile displays are much smaller and require simplification. 
Some screens are not good in sunlight.
Interface
Touch-screen technology introduces new interaction routines 
different from the traditional mouse and keyboard. The mobile 
platform is not a good data entry tool but can be a good 
navigational tool.

faster load times, the ability to enhance or remove functionality on the fly, and typi-
cally a better user experience, particularly for businesses where user intent differs 
depending on the platform being used. For example, creating its mobile Web site with 
AWD enabled Lufthansa to focus on actions its mobile users are most likely to take, 
such as checking in, getting flight status information, and looking up travel itineraries, 
and to provide a differentiated experience from its traditional desktop site (Pratap, 
2013). A variation on AWD uses a cloud-based platform to provide similar functionality 
(Moovweb, 2013). 
CROSS-PLATFORM MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
In addition to creating native apps from scratch using a programming language such 
as Objective C or Java (as described in Chapter 2), there are hundreds of low-cost or 
open source app development toolkits that make creating cross-platform mobile apps 
relatively easy and inexpensive without having to use a device-specific programming 
language. 
Tools include Appery.io, a cloud-based platform that enables you to a drag-and-
drop visual builder tool to create HTML5 apps using jQuery Mobile. Appery.io supports 
Android, iOS, and Windows Phone applications. Codiqa is a similar tool that is even 
easier to use. It also provides a drag-and-drop interface and builds an app with 100% 
HTML5 components, without the need to do any coding. For those who are even less 
technical, Conduit is a free mobile app builder that allows you to include a variety of 
functionality, including e-commerce, notifications, and a social feed. 
On the more technical side, PhoneGap is a mobile development framework that 
uses software called Apache Cordova to enable building hybrid mobile applications 
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. MoSync is another advanced tool for developing 
cross-platform apps for iOS, Android, Linux Mobile, Windows Mobile, and Symbian 
operating systems. Appcelerator is a similar, less technical tool for creating and manag-
ing hybrid mobile apps. 
MOBILE PRESENCE: PERFORMANCE AND COST CONSIDERATIONS
If you don’t have an existing Web site, the most efficient process may be to use a 
mobile first design philosophy and design a mobile site first. Alternatively, you may 
choose to build a traditional Web site using RWD or AWD techniques. If you already 
have a Web site that you don’t want to totally redevelop, the least expensive path is 
to resize it to create a smartphone-friendly mobile site. Doing so typically will not 
require a complete redesign effort. You will need to reduce the graphics and text, 
simplify the navigation, and focus on improving the customer experience so you do 
not confuse people. Because your customers might still need to use a relatively slow 
cell connection at times, you will need to lighten up the amount of data you send. 
Also, given the difficulty of customer data entry on a mobile device, you cannot expect 
customers to happily enter long strings of numbers or text characters. For marketing 
clarity, make sure the brand images used on the mobile Web site match those on the 
traditional Web site. The cost of developing a mobile Web site can range widely, from 
upwards of €1 million for a custom-designed site for a large global enterprise to well 

under €1,000 for a small business who chooses a company such as Wix or MoFuse that 
offers a template or mobile Web site creator, as described in the Insight on Technology 
case, Building a Mobile Presence. 
Building a mobile Web app that uses the mobile device’s browser requires more 
effort and cost than developing a mobile Web site and suffers from the same limita-
tions as any browser-based application. However, it does offer some advantages such 
as better graphics, more interactivity, and faster local calculations as, for instance, 
in mobile geo-location applications like Foursquare that require local calculations of 
position and then communication with the site’s Web server. 
The most expensive path to a mobile presence is to build a native app. Native apps 
can require more extensive programming expertise. In addition, virtually none of the 
elements used in your existing Web site can be reused, and you will need to redesign 
the entire logic of the interface and carefully think out the customer experience. For 
instance, there is a fairly stable HTML traditional Web site interface with buttons, 
graphics, videos, and ads that has developed over the last decade. This is not true for 
apps. There is no set of standards or expectations even on the part of users—every app 
looks different from every other app. This means the user confronts large variations 
in app design, so your interface must be quite simple and obvious. Many of the bells 
and whistles found on the large desktop Web site screen cannot be used in mobile 
apps. You’ll need even greater simplification and focus. These weaknesses are also 
native apps’ greatest strength: you have the opportunity to create a really stunning, 
unique customer experience where users can interact with your brand. If you want 
an intense branding experience with your customers, where interaction between your 
brand and customers is effortless and efficient, then native apps are the best choice.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY 
BUILDING A MOBILE PRESENCE
Today, almost every company 
with a Web presence is thinking about 
or developing mobile applications and 
a mobile Web site. Customers expect, 
and even demand, to be able to use a 
mobile device of their choice to obtain infor-
mation or perform a transaction anywhere and at 
any time. So, if a company wants to stay connected 
to its customers, it needs a mobile presence. 
Developing mobile apps or a mobile Web 
site has some special challenges. The user expe-
rience on a mobile device is fundamentally dif-
ferent from that on a desktop computer. There 
are special features on mobile devices such as 
location-based services that give a company the 
potential to interact with customers in new ways. 
Businesses need to be able to take advantage 
of those features while delivering an experience 
that is appropriate to a small screen. You can’t 
just port a Web site or desktop application to a 
smartphone or tablet. There are multiple mobile 
platforms to work with—iPhone, Android, Black-
Berry, and Windows—and a company may need a 
different version of an application to run on each 
of these. Increasingly, mobile-optimized Web sites 
are “responsive,” which means they adapt their 
displays based on the screen resolution of the 
mobile device used to view the site. Some mobile 
sites have tweaks to their layout that factor in the 
smartphone browsing experience, such as placing 
company contact information at the top of the 
screen on every page instead of at the bottom of 
only certain pages.
It’s important to understand how, why, and 
where customers use mobile devices and how 
these mobile experiences change business inter-
actions and behavior. For example, do custom-
ers who use an app conduct a greater number 
of transactions (like purchasing) on apps when 
compared to a mobile browser? When compared 
to a tablet computer, do customers spend more or 
less time researching products and shopping from 
a smartphone? 
Local businesses may stand to significantly 
gain from the shift to mobile. Approximately half 
of all mobile searches are done in search of a 
nearby business. The total number of local busi-
ness searches performed on mobile phones has 
been growing explosively, along with nearly every 
other statistic related to mobile devices or mobile 
apps. Almost 60% of the U.S. population has a 
smartphone and almost as many (about 50%) 
own a tablet.
The number of small businesses with Web 
sites optimized for mobile navigation is trailing 
behind those numbers. Although almost two-thirds 
of U.S. small and medium-sized businesses have 
a professional Web site, only a third of this group 
(constituting 25% of all those surveyed) had a 
mobile-optimized site in September 2015. These 
numbers are expected to rise over time as the 
businesses that optimize their sites first reap the 
benefits, such as increased traffic and better stand-
ing in Google searches and other search engines. A 
report by Adobe showed that companies investing 
in mobile-optimized sites are three times more 
likely to achieve mobile conversion rates of 5% 
or higher than companies relying exclusively on 
traditional desktop Web sites. During the original 
dot-com boom, companies that were quick to 
adjust to the new online business environment 
gained an edge on their competitors. The same 
thing is happening with the mobile platform today.
Before entering the mobile sphere, companies 
should develop a clear strategy and goals they 
hope to accomplish. A mobile strategy involves 
more than selecting mobile devices, operating 
systems, and applications. It also involves changes 

to the way a business interacts with its custom-
ers. Mobile technology can streamline processes, 
make them more portable, and enhance them with 
capabilities such as touch interfaces, location and 
mapping features, alerts, texting, cameras, and 
video functionality. The technology can also create 
less efficient processes or fail to deliver benefits 
if the mobile application is not properly designed. 
Many small businesses have struggled to 
adapt to the changes of designing for mobile. 
Often, businesses design their Web sites with artis-
tic considerations in mind, but mobile users are 
less interested in presentation and more interested 
in functionality. Sites with Flash elements are 
incompatible with the iPhone, which makes the 
mobile browsing experience incomplete or frus-
trating for the user. Many times with mobile, less is 
more when it comes to design. Common features 
of today’s mobile Web sites are a navigation bar 
at the top of each page that persists throughout 
browsing, collapsible sets of data that cut down 
on screen space unless users specifically request 
to see the complete set of information, such as 
a restaurant menu or full mailing address, and 
simple, easy-to-read icons and buttons such as a 
Facebook Like button.
Many businesses are still getting used to 
the costs of maintaining a Web site and aren’t 
willing to redo that work and spend more time and 
resources to incorporate responsive design. In one 
survey of small businesses, businesses not using 
any mobile solutions said that the two biggest 
reasons for staying away from mobile were lack of 
customer demand and lack of ability to deploy and 
use them. But the total number of businesses that 
say they have no intention of entering the mobile 
arena is going down precipitously. In an eMarketer 
survey, 59% of respondents considered 
improving their mobile Web and m-commerce 
capability to be one of their highest priorities, 
while 35% of respondents considered implement-
ing responsive design to be one of their highest 
priorities. 
There are a number of Web site design com-
panies that offer templates that can automatically 
convert Web sites into mobile-only versions of the 
same site. For example, you can create a desktop 
Web site using a template provided by Wix, and 
it will automatically create a mobile version of 
the site. A Mobile Editor enables you to change 
the design of the mobile site without affecting 
the desktop version of the site, giving businesses 
more creative freedom. MoFuse is another 
company that offers an easy-to-use mobile Web 
site creator. For those who are challenged by 
even that prospect, MoFuse will create the site 
for you. Developing mobile apps is probably a bit 
more daunting for the average small business, but 
there are a number of platforms that can help you 
build a mobile app on a budget without any pro-

Its Mobile Trajectory 
W
hen it comes to mobile apps and gauging their impact on consumers 
and business, there’s no better industry to look at than the online 
travel industry and its airline and hotel reservation systems. And 
there’s no better company in this industry in developing mobile 
apps than Orbitz Worldwide Inc., the leading online travel site. Orbitz connects con-
sumers to hundreds of airlines, over 80,000 hotels, 15 rental car agencies, as well as 
cruises and vacation packages. Orbitz typically has approximately 9 million unique 
visitors to its Web site each month.
As early as 1999, fledgling Internet travel companies such as Priceline, Expedia, 
and Travelocity were already transforming the travel industry. Recognizing the threat, 
and the opportunity, five major airlines—United, Delta, Continental, Northwest, and 
American—banded together to form a new venture that would become Orbitz. By the

time the site launched in 2001, six other airlines had invested and anti-trust objections 
from consumer groups and competitors had been rejected by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. Even at that early date, the Orbitz management team was forward-
thinking, providing the capability for consumers to access flight updates and cancel-
lations via pagers and mobile phones. By the time the Department of Justice had 
completely cleared Orbitz for takeoff and it had completed its IPO in November 2003, 
Orbitz had recruited more than 100 independent hotels in addition to its initial Trav-
elWeb syndicate, which included the big players such as Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt.
In 2006, Orbitz became the first Internet travel company to offer a WML-only 
(Wireless Markup Language) mobile Web site in the United States. (Expedia had a 
mobile site for its U.K. customers.) Users could check flight statuses for 27 airlines, 
some of which did not yet have a mobile site, and search for hotels in the 19 largest 
destination markets in the United States and in Cancun, Mexico. They also had access 
to a personal page dedicated to itineraries for Orbitz-booked trips and links to autodial 
Orbitz customer service. Additional services added in 2007 included enabling mobile 
users to view average wait times to get through security and available Wi-Fi services for 
a particular airport. A data feedback system was instituted to compute check-in delays 
and taxi line wait-times based on customer-inputted experiences. In 2008, Orbitz added 
an iPhone/iPod–specific app with the same capabilities for itinerary, flight status, WiFi 
availability, and wait-time checking as well as the ability to view weather and traffic 
conditions, reports from other travelers, and information about where to park and 
ground transportation. Customers could also now use technology specifically designed 
for touch-based Safari browsers to book a hotel room during inclement weather.
By 2010, market research had pushed Orbitz to increase its investment in mobile 
technology. It launched a redesigned mobile Web site and a smartphone app for Google 
Inc.’s Android operating system along with an updated iPhone app. Users of any 
Web-enabled device could now access a tool set comparable to the one available on 
its regular Web site to purchase flights, book car rentals, and secure hotel accommoda-
tions, including same-day reservations, as well as Orbitz’s Price Assurance service, 
which guarantees consumers an automatic refund if another Orbitz customer books 
the same service for less. The native apps and redesigned mobile site were developed 
in-house with input from an unnamed outside vendor.
In 2011, Orbitz was the first to launch an m-commerce site designed for business 
users. The site was accessible from any Web-enabled device, which avoided the pit-
falls of developing native apps for the wide variety of different devices its customers 
used. Users could enter and modify their trips via the app and give preference to a 
preferred vendor, which helped to adhere to company-specific travel policies. They 
also launched a hotel-booking app for iPad users. The app used the GPS function to 
display a detailed map of the user’s location, with pins denoting nearby hotels and 
providing hotel details like address, phone number, and cost per night. Barney Harford, 
CEO of Orbitz Worldwide, touted the ability to book a hotel room in just three taps. 
The rollout of the m-commerce site and iPad app prepared Orbitz to create second-
generation applications that could meet evolving consumer expectations and adjust 
to the rapidly expanding and changing mobile environment. Three main improve-
ments were made to the second-generation m-commerce site. First, it was optimized

to accommodate the small screen size of any Web-enabled mobile device. Second, it 
was updated to accommodate swiping gestures, and third, it was revamped to expedite 
touch screen transactions. HTML5 enabled Orbitz to incorporate features traditionally 
associated with apps, such as swiping and faster browsing. Features were also added, 
including the ability to book vacation packages, view savings made by booking flight 
and hotel rooms at once, improved search and filtering capabilities, and linking an 
online profile to credit cards to hasten the checkout process.
Looking to capitalize on the market research findings that highlighted the burgeon-
ing role of Web-enabled mobile devices in securing same-day accommodations, Orbitz 
also instituted mobile-exclusive same-day deals. These specials, called Mobile Steals, 
are available both on the m-commerce site and through the Hotels by Orbitz app, 
which was also released for the Android and iPhone. Last-minute perishable goods are 
available in more than 50 markets worldwide, benefitting both lodging proprietors and 
consumers. Proprietors are able to fill rooms that might otherwise remain vacant, and 
consumers enjoy savings of up to 50% off the standard rate. In 2015, Orbitz expanded 
Mobile Steals to include car rentals as well, offering thousands of exclusive deals for 
app users.
With mobile transaction customers doubling in one year’s time, Orbitz decided 
that an overhaul of its native iPhone app was also in order. When relaunched in June 
2012, the iOS app included an improved filtering tool that enabled users to search 
and compare offerings by cost, distance from destination, and star ratings. Securing 
flight, lodging, and car rental reservations was simplified, eliminating browser screens 
and data entry repetition, and allowing users to perform all three operations in a 
continuous in-app stream unassociated with a mobile Web site. This was the heart of 
the redesign: to eliminate the mobile Web site and consolidate the entire search and 
reservation process within the native app so that users would no longer experience 
disruptive and time-consuming redirects either to Orbitz’s mobile site or to an airline, 
hotel, or car rental agency site to complete the booking. The goal was to trump its 
competitors on speed and ease of use. 
In order to verify that its goals for the app had been achieved, Orbitz com-
missioned a speed comparison study with Atmosphere Research Group and C+R 
Research. The travel apps, m-commerce sites, and e-commerce sites of its major com-
petitors, including Kayak, Expedia, Priceline, and Travelocity, were pitted against the 
Orbitz iPhone app. The study found that Orbitz iPhone app users were able to book a 
round-trip flight to Hilton Head, South Carolina, a hotel reservation, and a car rental 
in slightly more than seven minutes, twice as fast as people using its iPhone app 
competitors. Only 60% of study participants using a competitor’s product (aggregated) 
were able to complete the task as quickly. The Orbitz iPhone app transaction speed 
also surpassed comparable iPad and Android apps as well as desktop e-commerce site 
experiences. Study participants overwhelmingly awarded positive marks to the Orbitz 
iPhone app in comparison to its competitors, at 92% and 30%, respectively. 
To speed the identification and fulfillment of future needs, customers’ search 
history, personal information, frequent flyer program data, and travel preferences are 
saved within the app, enabling one-tap access to recent searches and automatic search 
suggestions. Itineraries can be accessed even while offline, and flight status and gate

change data can be accessed with a single tap. Trips can also be easily added to the 
Apple Calendar app, formerly called iCal, used by many iPhone and iPod touch users. 
Since then, Orbitz has continued to expand its array of apps across different operat-
ing systems and platforms. In 2013, it launched a full version of its Flights, Hotels, Cars 
app as a native app optimized for iPad, the first of its kind among travel service provid-
ers. Orbitz also fully overhauled the same app for Android, marking the third generation 
of its Android native app. In October 2013, Orbitz launched Orbitz Rewards, a rewards 
program that has led to a marked increase in mobile purchases. The program already 
has over 2 million members, many of which are entirely new customers to Orbitz. In 
January 2014, Orbitz introduced Orbitz Labs, as part of an effort to use the increasing 
amount of data its users generate to provide better services and drive more bookings. 
Orbitz is using Orbitz Labs to test out new features and keep track of which ones are 
most popular with users, with the intent of incorporating those popular features into the 
Orbitz mobile app. In March 2014, Orbitz released a new version of its Orbitz for Business 
mobile site, with a new design that increases ease of use and provides improved speed 
and touch responsiveness. In addition, it is rolling out a responsive design approach 
across devices, and has started syncing user searches across devices so that users can 
pick up where they left off, no matter what device they are using. Orbitz has earned 
rave reviews for its efforts, winning the APPY Award for best travel app and receiving 
the top rating in customer satisfaction among all online travel Web sites. The efforts 
are paying off. Orbitz reports that more than 30% of its hotel bookings now come via a 
mobile channel, compared to only 3% in 2010, and up from 24% in 2013.
Orbitz continues its mobile development across all platforms, even newer ones 
such as the Apple Watch. In 2015, Orbitz released a version of its app customized 
for the Apple Watch, with the ability to see flight status, gate numbers, check-in and 
check-out information, and rewards points information. Orbitz also became the first 
travel company to use the Smart Lock password manager system from Google, which 
automatically signs customers into Orbitz.com whenever they return to the site or 
the app even on different devices. The system will allow users to quickly shift from 
device to device to make their travel plans.
In September 2015, Orbitz was acquired by Expedia in a $1.6 billion deal, solidify-
ing Expedia’s place as the top digital travel provider in the industry. The move came 
after Priceline purchased OpenTable in 2014 and Travelocity in 2015, setting up a battle 
between the two largest online travel services. 
Case Study Questions
1.	 When compared to traditional desktop customers, why are mobile phone users 
much more likely to book a room or airline reservation for the same day?
2.	 In the mobile design project of 2011, why did Orbitz management decide to 
construct a mobile Web site for corporate users rather than a native app? 
3.	 Why has Orbitz decided to go with native apps for each mobile platform (iOS, 
Android, and Kindle Fire) instead of a single mobile Web site as it did with the 
Orbitz for Business mobile site?
4.	 What issues does syncing recent user searches across devices pose?

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the questions you must ask and answer, and the steps you should take, in developing an e-commerce 
presence.
•	
Questions you must ask and answer when developing an e-commerce presence include:
•	
What is your vision and how do you hope to accomplish it?
•	
What is your business and revenue model?
•	
Who and where is the target audience?
•	
What are the characteristics of the marketplace?
•	
Where is the content coming from?
•	
Conduct a SWOT analysis.
•	
Develop an e-commerce presence map.
•	
Develop a timeline.
•	
Develop a detailed budget.
Explain the process that should be followed in building an e-commerce presence.
•	
Factors you must consider when building an e-commerce site include hardware, software, telecommuni-
cations capacity, Web site and mobile platform design, human resources, and organizational capabilities.
•	
The systems development life cycle (a methodology for understanding the business objectives of a sys-
tem and designing an appropriate solution) for building an e-commerce Web site involves five major 
steps:
•	
Identify the specific business objectives for the site, and then develop a list of system functionalities 
and information requirements.
•	
Develop a system design specification (both logical design and physical design).
•	
Build the site, either by in-house personnel or by outsourcing all or part of the responsibility to out-
side contractors.
•	
Test the system (unit testing, system testing, acceptance testing, A/B (split) testing, and multivariate 
testing).
•	
Implement and maintain the site.
•	
The basic business and system functionalities an e-commerce site should contain include a digital 
catalog, a product database, customer tracking, shopping cart/payment system, an on-site blog, a cus-
tomer database, an ad server, a site tracking and reporting system, and an inventory management 
system.
•	
Advantages of building a site in-house include the ability to change and adapt the site quickly as the 
market demands and the ability to build a site that does exactly what the company needs.
•	
Disadvantages of building a site in-house include higher costs, greater risks of failure, a more time-
consuming process, and a longer staff learning curve that delays time to market.
•	
Using design templates cuts development time, but preset templates can also limit functionality.
•	
A similar decision is also necessary regarding outsourcing the hosting of the site versus keeping it 
in-house. Relying on an outside vendor places the burden of reliability on someone else in return for a 
monthly hosting fee. The downside is that if the site requires fast upgrades due to heavy traffic, the 
chosen hosting company may or may not be capable of keeping up. Reliability versus scalability is the 
issue in this instance.

Identify and understand the major considerations involved in choosing Web server and e-commerce merchant server 
software.
•	
Early Web sites used single-tier system architecture and consisted of a single-server computer that deliv-
ered static Web pages to users making requests through their browsers. The extended functionality of 
today’s Web sites requires the development of a multi-tiered systems architecture, which utilizes a variety 
of specialized Web servers, as well as links to pre-existing backend or legacy corporate databases.
•	
All e-commerce sites require basic Web server software to answer requests from customers for HTML and 
XML pages. When choosing Web server software, companies are also choosing what operating system the 
site will run on. Apache, which runs on the Unix system, is the market leader.
•	
Web servers provide a host of services, including processing user HTML requests, security services, file 
transfer, a search engine, data capture, e-mail, and site management tools.
•	
Dynamic server software allows sites to deliver dynamic content, rather than static, unchanging informa-
tion. Web application server programs enable a wide range of e-commerce functionality, including creat-
ing a customer database, creating an e-mail promotional program, and accepting and processing orders, 
as well as many other services.
•	
E-commerce merchant server software is another important software package that provides catalog dis-
plays, information storage and customer tracking, order taking (shopping cart), and credit card purchase 
processing. E-commerce software platforms can save time and money, but customization can signifi-
cantly drive up costs. Factors to consider when choosing an e-commerce software platform include its 
functionality, support for different business models, visual site management tools and reporting systems, 
performance and scalability, connectivity to existing business systems, compliance with standards, and 
global and multicultural capability.
Understand the issues involved in choosing the most appropriate hardware for an e-commerce site.
•	
Speed, capacity, and scalability are three of the most important considerations when selecting an operat-
ing system, and therefore the hardware that it runs on.
•	
To evaluate how fast the site needs to be, companies need to assess the number of simultaneous users the 
site expects to see, the nature of their requests, the type of information requested, and the bandwidth 
available to the site. The answers to these questions will provide guidance regarding the processors neces-
sary to meet customer demand. In some cases, additional processing power can increase capacity, 
thereby improving system speed.
•	
Scalability is also an important issue. Increasing processing supply by scaling up to meet demand can be 
done through vertical or horizontal scaling or by improving processing architecture.
Identify additional tools that can improve Web site performance.
•	
In addition to providing a speedy Web site, companies must also strive to have a well-designed site that 
encourages visitors to buy. Building in interactivity improves site effectiveness, as do personalization 
techniques. 
•	
Commonly used software tools for achieving high levels of Web site interactivity and customer personal-
ization include Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, Active Server Pages (ASP) and ASP.NET, Java 
applets, JavaScript, ActiveX and VBScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby on Rails (RoR or Rails), and Django.
Understand the important considerations involved in developing a mobile Web site and building mobile applications.
•	
When developing a mobile presence, it is important to understand the difference between a mobile Web 
site, mobile Web apps, native apps, and hybrid apps.
•	
The first step is to identify business objectives, because they help determine which type of mobile pres-
ence is best.

Design should take into account mobile platform constraints. Recent trends include mobile first design, 
responsive Web design, and adaptive Web delivery.

Developing a mobile Web site is likely to be the least expensive option; mobile Web apps require more 
effort and cost; native apps are likely to be the most expensive to develop.

	 1.	 Go to the Web site of Wix, Weebly, or another provider of your choosing that allows you to create a 
simple e-tailer Web site for a free trial period. Create a Web site. The site should feature at least four 
pages, including a home page, product page, shopping cart, and contact page. Extra credit will be given 
for additional complexity and creativity. Come to class prepared to present your e-tailer concept and 
Web site.
	 2.	 Visit several e-commerce sites, not including those mentioned in this chapter, and evaluate the effective-
ness of the sites according to the eight basic criteria/functionalities listed in Table 3.11. Choose one site 
you feel does an excellent job on all the aspects of an effective site and create an electronic presenta-
tion, including screen shots, to support your choice.
	 3.	 Imagine that you are in charge of developing a fast-growing start-up’s e-commerce presence. Consider 
your options for building the company’s e-commerce presence in-house with existing staff, or 
outsourcing the entire operation. Decide which strategy you believe is in your company’s best interest 
and create a brief presentation outlining your position. Why choose that approach? And what are the

rom the earliest of days, humans have 
warred against and stolen from each 
other, with the tools evolving over time 
from sticks and stones, to arrows and spears, to 
guns and bombs. Physical weaponry is familiar and 
readily recognizable. But today, algorithms and com-
puter code have moved to the forefront. Cyberspace 
has become a new battlefield, one that often involves 
targets such as financial systems and communica-
tions networks. 
In 2013, the European Cybercrime Center 
(EC3) was created at Europol, the European law 
enforcement agency in The Hague, to combat the rise 
of cybercrime and cyberattacks throughout Europe 
and the rest of the world. More than half of the EU’s 
population is now online, meaning that an organi-
zation like the EC3 is needed in Europe now more 
than ever before.
A major challenge in fighting cybercrime is to even concretely define it and measure 
the amount of cybercrime taking place. Estimates of how much cybercrime costs companies 
and individuals vary widely, but a 2015 study by the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies estimates that the economic impact of cybercrime and cyberespionage worldwide 
is in a range between €345 billion and €530 billion, and that both the cost and frequency 
of attacks are on the rise. Cybercrime is a global problem, and countries have attempted 
many different strategies to fight it. However, sharing information about cybercrime is 
critical for success in apprehending cybercriminals, making Europol the ideal vehicle to 
combat multi-national criminal operations. The EC3 will help to standardize approaches 
to better counteract European cybercrime, and will help set guidelines regarding what 
incidents constitute cybercrime.
EC3 began operations out of The Hague on January 1, 2013, with a focus on three 
areas of cybercrime: crime committed by organized groups or rings, crime that causes 
harm to a victim, like child pornography, and cyberattacks on European Union infrastruc-
ture, such as government Web sites, databases, and storage centers.   In the wake of the 
terrorist attacks in Paris, France, EC3 received a boost in financial backing and powers, 
including the ability to coordinate police units to counter emerging threats and the capacity 
to directly force sites like Facebook and Twitter to remove Web pages containing terrorist

communications. EC3 has also joined forces with private security firms, such as FireEye 
in 2015, forming agreements to share knowledge and expertise on cybercrime prevention 
techniques. EC3 started with 43 anti-cybercrime experts, but has increased its size to 
more than 70 people, and is guided by a 12-member advisory board on Internet security 
featuring some of the foremost experts from a variety of different fields.
The EC3 describes its operations as having five main functions. First is data fusion, 
which involves gathering and processing information on cybercrime. The EC3 hopes to 
function as a central repository for statistics on cybercrime and its apprehension. Its 
second function will be cybercrime prevention operations, including conducting cyber-
crime investigations within individual EU states or facilitating joint investigations across 
multiple EU states. The third major function of the EC3 will be developing strategies for 
fighting cybercrime, analyzing crime trends, and forecasting future trends in cybercrime. 
The fourth function will be research and development as well as training of law enforce-
ment agencies in the skills required to effectively investigate and combat cybercrime. The 
organization will also educate judges and prosecutors on cybercrime. Lastly, the EC3 
will conduct outreach, working with the private sector, academia, and society at large to 
better handle cybercrime.
The majority of credit card numbers used in cybercrime in the EU have historically 
originated from United States data breaches, so a major focus of the EC3 has been pre-
venting card-not-present (CNP) fraud. Europol has reported that organized crime makes 
around €1.5 billion annually from credit card fraud, € 900 million of which originates 
from CNP fraud. As technological infrastructure improves in developing nations, it is ex-
pected that incidences of online credit card fraud originating in Africa and other similar 
countries will increase. The EC3 will need to be prepared for this type of cybercrime be-
coming more prevalent.
The early results of the EC3 have been positive. In 2013, it took down the largest 
ransomware cybercrime network in Russia, Operation Ransom, which spanned 33 coun-
tries, including 22 in the EU. Operation Ransom infected computers with police ransom-
ware, which is a type of malware that blocks a computer completely and warns the user 
that they have visited illegal websites, such as child pornography, and requests payment 
of a fine to unblock it. The leader of the ring was arrested in Dubai by Spanish police and 
Europol along with at least ten more members of the group. Later in 2013, in an opera-
tion code-named “Operation Ransom II,” EC3 and Spanish police arrested two Ukranian 
cybercriminals who sold access to a botnet with over 21,000 compromised servers located 
in 80 different countries. They also operated a sophisticated money laundering scheme 
that processed around €10,000 a day through various electronic payment systems and 
virtual currencies. These two investigations were part of EC3’s “Focal Point Cyborg,” 
which assisted in a total of 19 cybercrime operations in the EC3’s first year of existence.
As part of its “Focal Point Terminal” division, the EC3 busted an Asian criminal 
network responsible for the theft of 15,000 credit card numbers and for conducting illegal 
Internet transactions and purchases of airline tickets. In 2014, the EC3 held a “day of 
action” to target criminals using stolen credit cards to buy airline tickets as part of a 
different ring. Europol and individual law enforcement officers worked in concert in each 
country to make the arrests, which yielded further links to other criminal organizations. A

third area, “Focal Point Twins,” focused on nine sophisticated online child sexual exploita-
tion rings in EC3’s first year. EC3 has continued to shut down high-profile cybercriminal 
operations in 2015, including the Ramnit and Beebone botnets, and its improved ability 
to work with other law enforcement entities have helped it to bring down the creators 
of the Dridex banking malware, which accounted for £20 million in losses in the United 
Kingdom and $10 million in the United States.
The EC3 has increasingly focused on fighting “cybercrime-as-a-service.” Experienced 
cybercriminals are selling programs and services that buyers can use to commit cybercrime 
without the same knowledge of criminal techniques. When cybercrime is committed outside 
of the EU’s jurisdiction, it is more difficult to police, so many skilled cybercriminals within 
EU borders have taken to cybercrime-as-a-service to reduce their risk, allowing others to 
execute the cybercrime instead. Criminals are also increasingly making use of legitimate 
tools to stay anonymous on the Web, such as encryption techniques; virtual currencies 
like Bitcoin; and anonymization services such as Tor, which are used to navigate areas on 
the Web known as the Darknet, private networks where connections are made without 
sharing IP addresses. Many cybercriminals have migrated their efforts to mobile phones, 
forcing EC3 to begin targeting these operations. In its first major success in that area, 
EC3 brought down the DroidJack mobile phone malware in 2015.
Troels Oerting, head of the EC3, noted that although these obstacles are daunting, 
worldwide cybercrime is driven by a small number of talented programmers, and that fo-
cusing on these top-level criminals is the best way to combat cybercrime going forward. 
To that end, EC3 has launched a cybercrime task force in tandem with other law en-
forcement agencies called the Joint Cybercrime Action Task Force, which will focus on 
developing strategies for handling newer cybercrime techniques, pursuing the most dan-
gerous cybercriminals, and further improving the flow of data between law enforcement 
agencies across borders. In 2014, the EC3 demonstrated its ability to shut down sites on 
the Darknet, shutting down the second iteration of the underground black market Silk 
Road 2.0, and arresting its operator, a 26-year old former Google programmer. In 2015, 
it continued to bring down illicit sites on the Darknet, including a service for distributing 
child pornography. EC3’s challenge will be to continue making these high-profile arrests 
while adapting to the ever-changing array of techniques cybercriminals use.

s Europol Takes on Cybercrime with EC3 illustrates, the Internet and Web 
are increasingly vulnerable to large-scale attacks and potentially large-
scale failure. Increasingly, these attacks are led by organized gangs of 
criminals operating globally—an unintended consequence of globalization. Even more 
worrisome is the growing number of large-scale attacks that are funded, organized, 
and led by various nations against the Internet resources of other nations. Currently 
there are few if any steps that individuals or businesses can take to prevent these 
kinds of attacks. However, there are several steps you can take to protect your business 
Web sites, your mobile devices, and your personal information from routine security 
attacks. Reading this chapter, you should also start thinking about how your business 
could survive in the event of a large-scale “outage” of the Internet.
In this chapter, we will examine e-commerce security and payment issues. First, 
we will identify the major security risks and their costs, and describe the variety of 
solutions currently available. Then, we will look at the major payment methods and 
consider how to achieve a secure payment environment. Table 4.1 highlights some 
of the major trends in online security in 2015–2016.
	 4.1	
THE E-COMMERCE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
For most law-abiding citizens, the Internet holds the promise of a huge and convenient 
global marketplace, providing access to people, goods, services, and businesses world-
wide, all at a bargain price. For criminals, the Internet has created entirely new—and 
lucrative—ways to steal from the more than 1.35 billion Internet consumers world-
wide in 2015. From products and services, to cash, to information, it’s all there for the 
taking on the Internet.
	
TABLE 4.1	
WHAT’S NEW IN E-COMMERCE SECURITY 2015–2016
•	 Large-scale data breaches continue to expose data about individuals to hackers and other 
cybercriminals.
•	 Mobile malware presents a tangible threat as smartphones and other mobile devices become more 
common targets of cybercriminals, especially as their use for mobile payments rises.
•	 Malware creation continues to skyrocket and ransomware attacks rise.
•	 Nations continue to engage in cyberwarfare and cyberespionage.
•	 Hackers and cybercriminals continue to focus their efforts on social network sites to exploit potential 
victims through social engineering and hacking attacks.
•	 Politically motivated, targeted attacks by hacktivist groups continue, in some cases merging with 
financially motivated cybercriminals to target financial systems with advanced persistent threats.
•	 Software vulnerabilities, such as the Heartbleed bug and other zero day vulnerabilities, continue to 
create security threats.
•	 Incidents involving celebrities raise awareness of cloud security issues.

It’s also less risky to steal online. Rather than rob a bank in person, the Inter-
net makes it possible to rob people remotely and almost anonymously. Rather than 
steal a CD at a local record store, you can download the same music for free and 
almost without risk from the Internet. The potential for anonymity on the Inter-
net cloaks many criminals in legitimate-looking identities, allowing them to place 
fraudulent orders with online merchants, steal information by intercepting e-mail, 
or simply shut down e-commerce sites by using software viruses and swarm attacks. 
The Internet was never designed to be a global marketplace with billions of users 
and lacks many basic security features found in older networks such as the tele-
phone system or broadcast television networks. By comparison, the Internet is an 
open, vulnerable-design network. The actions of cybercriminals are costly for both 
businesses and consumers, who are then subjected to higher prices and additional 
security measures. The costs of malicious cyberactivity include not just the cost of 
the actual crime, but also the additional costs that are required to secure networks 
and recover from cyberattacks, the potential reputational damage to the affected 
company, as well as reduced trust in online activities, the loss of potentially sensi-
tive business information, including intellectual property and confidential business 
information, and the cost of opportunities lost due to service disruptions. Ponemon 
Institute estimates that the average total cost of a data breach to the 350 compa-
nies from 11 different countries participating in its 2015 study was €3.5 million 
(Ponemon Institute, 2015a).
THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
Cybercrime is becoming a more significant problem for both organizations and con-
sumers. Bot networks, DDoS attacks, Trojans, phishing, ransomware, data theft, iden-
tity fraud, credit card fraud, and spyware are just some of the threats that are making 
daily headlines. Social networks also have had security breaches. But despite the 
increasing attention being paid to cybercrime, it is difficult to accurately estimate the 
actual amount of such crime, in part because many companies are hesitant to report 
it due to the fear of losing the trust of their customers, and because even if crime is 
reported, it may be difficult to quantify the actual dollar amount of the loss. A 2014 
study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies examined the difficulties in 
accurately estimating the economic impact of cybercrime and cyberespionage, with its 
research indicating a range of between €345 billion to €530 billion worldwide. Further 
research is planned to try to help determine an even more accurate estimate (Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, 2014).
One source of information is a survey conducted by Ponemon Institute. Ponemon’s 
2015 survey included 252 companies in seven countries: Germany, the United 
Kingdom, Russia, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and the United States.  There were 1,928 
total attacks reported, a 12.3% increase from the previous year. The average annu-
alized cost for organizations in the study was around €7.1 million.  In all countries, 
virtually all organizations experienced attacks involving viruses, worms, Trojans, and 
malware. More than 50% of the companies also suffered  Web-based attacks, phish-
ing and social engineering attacks, malicious code, botnets, and denial of service

attacks. The most costly types of attacks were those by malicious insiders, denial of 
service, and Web-based attacks (Ponemon Institute, 2015b). 
Reports issued by security product providers, such as Symantec, are another 
source of data. Symantec issues a semi-annual Internet Security Threat Report, based on 
57.6 million sensors monitoring Internet activity in more than 157 countries. Advances 
in technology have greatly reduced the entry costs and skills required to enter the 
cybercrime business. Low-cost and readily available Web attack kits enable hackers 
to create malware without having to write software from scratch. In addition, there 
has been a surge in polymorphic malware, which enables attackers to generate a 
unique version of the malware for each victim, making it much more difficult for 
pattern-matching software used by security firms to detect. According to Symantec, 
the number of data breaches increased 23% in 2014, the number of spear-phishing 
attacks increased by 8%, malware increased by 26%, and ransomware attacks grew 
by 113% (Symantec, 2015l). However, Symantec does not attempt to quantify actual 
crimes and/or losses related to these threats.
Online credit card fraud is one of the most high-profile forms of e-commerce 
crime. Although the average amount of credit card fraud loss experienced by any 
one individual is typically relatively small, the overall amount is substantial. The 
overall rate of online credit card fraud is estimated to be about 0.9% of all online 
card transactions, including both mobile and Web transactions (Cybersource, 2015). 
The nature of credit card fraud has changed greatly from the theft of a single credit 
card number and efforts to purchase goods at a few sites, to the simultaneous theft 
of millions of credit card numbers and their distributions to thousands of criminals 
operating as gangs of thieves. The emergence of identity fraud, described in detail 
later in this chapter, as a major online/offline type of fraud may well increase mark-
edly the incidence and amount of credit card fraud, because identity fraud often 
includes the use of stolen credit card information and the creation of phony credit 
card accounts. 
The Underground Economy Marketplace: The Value of Stolen Information
Criminals who steal information on the Internet do not always use this informa-
tion themselves, but instead derive value by selling the information to others on the 
so-called underground or shadow economy market. Data is currency to cybercrimi-
nals and has a “street value” that can be monetized. For example, in 2013, Vladislav 
Horohorin (alias “BadB”) was sentenced to over 7 years in federal prison for using 
online criminal forums to sell stolen credit and debit card information (referred to as 
“dumps”). At the time of his arrest, Horohorin possessed over 2.5 million stolen credit 
and debit card numbers. There are several thousand known underground economy 
marketplaces around the world that sell stolen information, as well as malware, such 
as exploit kits, access to botnets, and more. Table 4.2 lists some recently observed 
prices for various types of stolen data, which typically vary depending on the quan-
tity being purchased, supply available, and “freshness.” For example, when credit card 
information from the Target data breach first appeared on the market, individual card 
numbers went for up to $120 each. After a few weeks, however, the price dropped

dramatically (Leger, 2014). Experts believe the cost of stolen information has gener-
ally fallen as the tools of harvesting have increased the supply. On the demand side, 
the same efficiencies and opportunities provided by new technology have increased 
the number of people who want to use stolen information. It’s a robust marketplace.
Finding these marketplaces and the servers that host them can be difficult for 
the average user (and for law enforcement agencies), and prospective participants 
are typically vetted by other criminals before access is granted. This vetting process 
takes place through Twitter, Tor, and VPN services, and sometimes e-mail exchanges 
of information, money (often Bitcoins, a form of digital cash that we discuss further 
in Section 4.5 and in the Insight on Business case study on pages 301–302), and reputa-
tion. There is a general hierarchy of cybercriminals in the marketplace, with low-level, 
nontechnical criminals who frequent “carder forums,” where stolen credit and debit 
card data is sold, aiming to make money, a political statement, or both at the bottom; 
resellers in the middle acting as intermediaries; and the technical masterminds who 
create malicious code at the top. 
So, what can we can conclude about the overall size of cybercrime? Cybercrime 
against e-commerce sites is dynamic and changing all the time, with new risks 
appearing often. The amount of losses to businesses is significant and growing. The 
managers of e-commerce sites must prepare for an ever-changing variety of criminal 
assaults, and keep current in the latest security techniques.

WHAT IS GOOD E-COMMERCE SECURITY?
What is a secure commercial transaction? Anytime you go into a marketplace you 
take risks, including the loss of privacy (information about what you purchased). Your 
prime risk as a consumer is that you do not get what you paid for. As a merchant in the 
market, your risk is that you don’t get paid for what you sell. Thieves take merchan-
dise and then either walk off without paying anything, or pay you with a fraudulent 
instrument, stolen credit card, or forged currency.
E-commerce merchants and consumers face many of the same risks as participants 
in traditional commerce, albeit in a new digital environment. Theft is theft, regard-
less of whether it is digital theft or traditional theft. Burglary, breaking and entering, 
embezzlement, trespass, malicious destruction, vandalism—all crimes in a traditional 
commercial environment—are also present in e-commerce. However, reducing risks 
in e-commerce is a complex process that involves new technologies, organizational 
policies and procedures, and new laws and industry standards that empower law 
enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute offenders. Figure 4.1 illustrates 
the multi-layered nature of e-commerce security.
To achieve the highest degree of security possible, new technologies are available 
and should be used. But these technologies by themselves do not solve the problem. 
Organizational policies and procedures are required to ensure the technologies are 
not subverted. Finally, industry standards and government laws are required to 
enforce payment mechanisms, as well as to investigate and prosecute violators of 
laws designed to protect the transfer of property in commercial transactions.

The history of security in commercial transactions teaches that any security 
system can be broken if enough resources are put against it. Security is not absolute. 
In addition, perfect security of every item is not needed forever, especially in the infor-
mation age. There is a time value to information—just as there is to money. Sometimes 
it is sufficient to protect a message for a few hours or days. Also, because security is 
costly, we always have to weigh the cost against the potential loss. Finally, we have 
also learned that security is a chain that breaks most often at the weakest link. Our 
locks are often much stronger than our management of the keys.
We can conclude then that good e-commerce security requires a set of laws, pro-
cedures, policies, and technologies that, to the extent feasible, protect individuals and 
organizations from unexpected behavior in the e-commerce marketplace.
DIMENSIONS OF E-COMMERCE SECURITY
There are six key dimensions to e-commerce security: integrity, nonrepudiation, 
authenticity, confidentiality, privacy, and availability.
Integrity refers to the ability to ensure that information being displayed on a Web 
site, or transmitted or received over the Internet, has not been altered in any way by 
an unauthorized party. For example, if an unauthorized person intercepts and changes 
the contents of an online communication, such as by redirecting a bank wire transfer 
into a different account, the integrity of the message has been compromised because 
the communication no longer represents what the original sender intended.
Nonrepudiation refers to the ability to ensure that e-commerce participants do 
not deny (i.e., repudiate) their online actions. For instance, the availability of free 
e-mail accounts with alias names makes it easy for a person to post comments or 
send a message and perhaps later deny doing so. Even when a customer uses a real 
name and e-mail address, it is easy for that customer to order merchandise online 
and then later deny doing so. In most cases, because merchants typically do not 
obtain a physical copy of a signature, the credit card issuer will side with the customer 
because the merchant has no legally valid proof that the customer ordered the mer-
chandise.
Authenticity refers to the ability to identify the identity of a person or entity 
with whom you are dealing on the Internet. How does the customer know that the 
Web site operator is who it claims to be? How can the merchant be assured that the 
customer is really who she says she is? Someone who claims to be someone he is not 
is “spoofing” or misrepresenting himself.
Confidentiality refers to the ability to ensure that messages and data are avail-
able only to those who are authorized to view them. Confidentiality is sometimes 
confused with privacy, which refers to the ability to control the use of information a 
customer provides about himself or herself to an e-commerce merchant.
E-commerce merchants have two concerns related to privacy. They must establish 
internal policies that govern their own use of customer information, and they must 
protect that information from illegitimate or unauthorized use. For example, if hackers 
break into an e-commerce site and gain access to credit card or other information, this 
violates not only the confidentiality of the data, but also the privacy of the individuals 
who supplied the information.

TABLE 4.3	
CUSTOMER AND MERCHANT PERSPECTIVES ON THE 
DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF E-COMMERCE SECURITY
Availability refers to the ability to ensure that an e-commerce site continues to 
function as intended.
Table 4.3 summarizes these dimensions from both the merchants’ and customers’ 
perspectives. E-commerce security is designed to protect these six dimensions. When 
any one of them is compromised, overall security suffers.
THE TENSION BETWEEN SECURITY AND OTHER VALUES
Can there be too much security? The answer is yes. Contrary to what some may 
believe, security is not an unmitigated good. Computer security adds overhead and 
expense to business operations, and also gives criminals new opportunities to hide 
their intentions and their crimes.
Ease of Use
There are inevitable tensions between security and ease of use. When traditional 
merchants are so fearful of robbers that they do business in shops locked behind 
security gates, ordinary customers are discouraged from walking in. The same can

be true with respect to e-commerce. In general, the more security measures added 
to an e-commerce site, the more difficult it is to use and the slower the site becomes. 
As you will discover reading this chapter, digital security is purchased at the price of 
slowing down processors and adding significantly to data storage demands on storage 
devices. Security is a technological and business overhead that can detract from doing 
business. Too much security can harm profitability, while not enough security can 
potentially put you out of business.
Public Safety and the Criminal Uses of the Internet
There is also an inevitable tension between the desires of individuals to act anony-
mously (to hide their identity) and the needs of public officials to maintain public 
safety that can be threatened by criminals or terrorists. This is not a new problem, 
or even new to the electronic era. The U.S. government began tapping telegraph 
wires during the Civil War in the mid-1860s in order to trap conspirators and ter-
rorists, and the first police wiretaps of local telephone systems were in place by the 
1890s—20 years after the invention of the phone (Schwartz, 2001). No nation-state 
has ever permitted a technological haven to exist where criminals can plan crimes 
or threaten the nation-state without fear of official surveillance or investigation. In 
this sense, the Internet is no different from any other communication system. Drug 
cartels make extensive use of voice, fax, the Internet, and encrypted e-mail; a number 
of large international organized crime groups steal information from commercial Web 
sites and resell it to other criminals who use it for financial fraud. Over the years, the 
U.S. government has successfully pursued various “carding forums” (Web sites that 
facilitate the sale of stolen credit card and debit card numbers), such as Shadowcrew, 
Carderplanet, and Cardersmarket resulting in the arrest and prosecution of a number 
of their members and the closing of the sites. However, other criminal organizations 
have emerged to take their place.
The Internet and mobile platform also provide terrorists with convenient com-
munications channels. Encrypted files sent via e-mail were used by Ramzi Yousef—a 
member of the terrorist group responsible for bombing the World Trade Center in 
1993—to hide plans for bombing 11 U.S. airliners. The Internet was also used to plan 
and coordinate the subsequent attacks on the World Trade Center on September 
11, 2001. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab further illustrates how terrorists 
make effective use of the Internet to radicalize, recruit, train, and coordinate youth-
ful terrorists. Abdulmutallab allegedly attempted to blow up an American airliner in 
Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. He was identified, contacted, recruited, and trained, 
all within six weeks, according to a Pentagon counterterrorism official. In an effort to 
combat such terrorism, the U.S. government has significantly ramped up its surveil-
lance of communications delivered via the Internet over the past several years. The 
extent of that surveillance created a major controversy with National Security Agency 
contractor Edward Snowden’s release of classified NSA documents that revealed that 
the NSA had obtained access to the servers of major Internet companies such as Face-
book, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others, as well as that NSA analysts have been 
searching e-mail, online chats, and browsing histories of U.S. citizens without any

against terrorism has proven to be a very thorny problem for the U.S. government.

SECURITY THREATS IN THE E-COMMERCE 
ENVIRONMENT
From a technology perspective, there are three key points of vulnerability when 
dealing with e-commerce: the client, the server, and the communications pipeline. 
Figure 4.2 illustrates a typical e-commerce transaction with a consumer using a credit 
card to purchase a product. Figure 4.3 illustrates some of the things that can go wrong 
at each major vulnerability point in the transaction—over Internet communications 
channels, at the server level, and at the client level.
In this section, we describe a number of the most common and most damaging 
forms of security threats to e-commerce consumers and site operators: malicious code, 
potentially unwanted programs, phishing, hacking and cybervandalism, credit card 
fraud/theft, spoofing, pharming, spam (junk) Web sites (link farms), identity fraud,

Denial of Service (DoS) and DDoS attacks, sniffing, insider attacks, poorly designed 
server and client software, social network security issues, mobile platform security 
issues, and finally, cloud security issues.
MALICIOUS CODE
Malicious code (sometimes referred to as “malware”) includes a variety of threats 
such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and bots. Some malicious code, 
sometimes referred to as an exploit, is designed to take advantage of software vulner-
abilities in a computer’s operating system, Web browser, applications, or other software 
components. Exploit kits are collections of exploits bundled together and rented or 
sold as a commercial product, often with slick user interfaces and in-depth analytics 
functionality. Use of an exploit kit typically does not require much technical skill, 
enabling novices to become cybercriminals. Exploit kits typically target software that 
is widely deployed, such as Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash and 
Reader, and Oracle Java. In 2014, according to Cisco, Angler, an exploit kit that uses 
Flash, Java, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Silverlight vulnerabilities, was 
one of the exploit kits most observed “in the wild” (Cisco, 2015). According to Syman-
tec, more than 317 million new variants of malware were created in 2014, an average 
of close to 1 million strains a day, with the overall number of malware variants now

VULNERABLE POINTS IN AN E-COMMERCE TRANSACTION
There are three major vulnerable points in e-commerce transactions: Internet communications, servers, and clients.

totaling 1.7 billion (Symantec, 2015). In the past, malicious code was often intended 
to simply impair computers, and was often authored by a lone hacker, but increasingly 
the intent is to steal e-mail addresses, logon credentials, personal data, and financial 
information. Malicious code is also used to develop integrated malware networks that 
organize the theft of information and money.
In the early days of the Internet, malicious code was often delivered by e-mail, 
in the form of a malicious attachment such as a Microsoft Word document or Excel 
spreadsheet and this remains a popular distribution method, with 1 in about every 
244 e-mails containing mailware, either in the form of a malicious attachment or a 
malicious URL. The links lead directly to a malicious code download or Web sites that 
include malicious code (Symantec, 2015). One of the latest innovations in malicious 
code distribution is to embed it in the online advertising chain (known as maladver-
tising), including in Google, AOL, and other ad networks. As the ad network chain 
becomes more complicated, it becomes more and more difficult for Web sites to vet 
ads placed on their sites to ensure they are malware-free. A 2014 research study indi-
cated that as many as 1% of all ads served may be maladvertising (Zarras et al., 2014). 
Much of the maladvertising in the recent years has been in the form of drive-by down-
loads that exploited the frequent zero-day vulnerabilities that have plagued Adobe 
Flash, which is often used for online advertisements. As a result, the Internet Adver-
tising Bureau has urged advertisers to abandon Adobe Flash in favor of HTML5, and 
Mozilla Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Google’s Chrome browser all now block Flash 
advertisements from autoplaying. Amazon has also stopped accepting Flash ads. A 
drive-by download is malware that comes with a downloaded file that a user inten-
tionally or unintentionally requests. Drive-by is now one of the most common methods 
of infecting computers. For instance, Web sites as disparate as eWeek (a technology 
site), to MLB (Major League Baseball), and Yahoo have experienced instances where 
ads placed on their sites either had malicious code embedded or directed clickers to 
malicious sites (RAND Corporation, 2014). According to Symantec, drive-by download 
exploit kits, including updates and 24/7 support, can be rented for between $100 to 
$700 per week. Malicious code embedded in PDF files also is common. Equally impor-
tant, there has been a major shift in the writers of malware from amateur hackers and 
adventurers to organized criminal efforts to defraud companies and individuals. In 
other words, it’s now more about the money than ever before.
A virus is a computer program that has the ability to replicate or make copies of 
itself, and spread to other files. In addition to the ability to replicate, most computer 
viruses deliver a “payload.” The payload may be relatively benign, such as the display 
of a message or image, or it may be highly destructive—destroying files, reformatting 
the computer’s hard drive, or causing programs to run improperly.
Viruses are often combined with a worm. Instead of just spreading from file to 
file, a worm is designed to spread from computer to computer. A worm does not 
necessarily need to be activated by a user or program in order for it to replicate itself. 
The Slammer worm is one of the most notorious. Slammer targeted a known vulner-
ability in Microsoft’s SQL Server database software and infected more than 90% of 
vulnerable computers worldwide within 10 minutes of its release on the Internet; 
crashed Bank of America cash machines, especially in the southwestern part of the

United States; affected cash registers at supermarkets such as the Publix chain in 
Atlanta, where staff could not dispense cash to frustrated buyers; and took down 
most Internet connections in South Korea, causing a dip in the stock market there. 
The Conficker worm, which first appeared in November 2008, is the most significant 
worm since Slammer, and reportedly infected 9 to 15 million computers worldwide 
(Symantec, 2010).
Ransomware (scareware) is a type of malware (often a worm) that locks your 
computer or files to stop you from accessing them. Ransomware will often display a 
notice that says an authority such as the FBI, Department of Justice, or IRS has 
detected illegal activity on your computer and demands that you pay a fine in order 
to unlock the computer and avoid prosecution. In 2013, a new type of ransomware 
named CryptoLocker emerged. CryptoLocker encrypts victims’ files with a virtually 
unbreakable asymmetric encryption and demands a ransom to decrypt them, often 
in Bitcoins. If the victim does not comply within the time allowed, the files will not 
ever be able to be decrypted. Other variants include CryptoDefense and Cryptowall. 
Ransomware attacks increased by over 113% in 2014, and those involving crypto-
ransomware such as CryptoLocker increased astronomically, by 45 times. Crypto-
ransomware infections often take place via a malicious e-mail attachment that purports 
to be an invoice (Symantec, 2015).
A Trojan horse appears to be benign, but then does something other than 
expected. The Trojan horse is not itself a virus because it does not replicate, but is 
often a way for viruses or other malicious code such as bots or rootkits (a program 
whose aim is to subvert control of the computer’s operating system) to be introduced 
into a computer system. The term Trojan horse refers to the huge wooden horse in 
Homer’s Iliad that the Greeks gave their opponents, the Trojans—a gift that actually 
contained hundreds of Greek soldiers. Once the people of Troy let the massive horse 
within their gates, the soldiers revealed themselves and captured the city. In today’s 
world, a Trojan horse may masquerade as a game, but actually hide a program to steal 
your passwords and e-mail them to another person. Miscellaneous Trojans and Trojan 
downloaders and droppers (Trojans that install malicious files to a computer they have 
infected by either downloading them from a remote computer or from a copy con-
tained in their own code) are a common type of malware. For example, according to 
Microsoft, the encounter rate for downloaders and droppers spiked in the third quarter 
of 2014 because of detections of a Trojan downloader known as Tugspay. Tugspay was 
the most commonly encountered malware family in the second half of 2014, and 
spread by posing as an installer for legitimate software, such as Java update (Microsoft, 
2015). According to Panda Security, Trojans accounted for almost 70% of all malware 
created in 2014, and 65% of all malware infections. In May 2011, Sony experienced 
the largest data breach in history up to that time when a Trojan horse took over the 
administrative computers of Sony’s PlayStation game center and downloaded personal 
and credit card information involving 77 million registered users (Wakabayashi, 2011). 
Trojan horses are often used for financial malware distributed via botnets. One example 
is Zeus, which steals information by keystroke logging and has infected over 10 million 
computers since it first became known in 2007. Other examples include SpyEye, a 
Trojan that can steal banking information via both a keylogging application and the 
ransomware

ability to take screenshots on a victim’s computer, and which has infected 1.4 million 
computers as of October 2015; Torpig, a botnet that is spread by a Trojan horse called 
Meboot; and Vawtrak, a Trojan that spreads via social media, e-mail, and FTP, and is 
able to hide evidence of fraud by changing bank balances shown to the victim on the 
fly (Cyphort, 2015). 
A backdoor is a feature of viruses, worms, and Trojans that allows an attacker to 
remotely access a compromised computer. Downadup is an example of a worm with 
a backdoor, while Virut, a virus that infects various file types, also includes a backdoor 
that can be used to download and install additional threats.
Bots (short for robots) are a type of malicious code that can be covertly installed 
on your computer when attached to the Internet. Once installed, the bot responds to 
external commands sent by the attacker; your computer becomes a “zombie” and is 
able to be controlled by an external third party (the “bot-herder”). Botnets are collec-
tions of captured computers used for malicious activities such as sending spam, par-
ticipating in a DDoS attack, stealing information from computers, and storing network 
traffic for later analysis. The number of botnets operating worldwide is not known but 
is estimated to be well into the thousands, controlling millions of computers. Bots and 
bot networks are an important threat to the Internet and e-commerce because they 
can be used to launch very large-scale attacks using many different techniques. In 
2011, federal marshals accompanied members of Microsoft’s digital crimes unit in raids 
designed to disable the Rustock botnet, at that time the leading source of spam in the 
world with nearly 500,000 slave PCs under the control of its command and control 
servers located at six Internet hosting services in the United States. Officials confis-
cated the Rustock control servers at the hosting sites, which claimed they had no idea 
what the Rustock servers were doing. The actual spam e-mails were sent by the slave 
PCs under the command of the Rustock servers (Wingfield, 2011). In 2013, Microsoft 
and the FBI engaged in another aggressive botnet operation, targeting 1,400 of Zeus-
derived Citadel botnets, which had been used in 2012 to raid bank accounts at major 
banks around the world, netting over $500 million (Chirgwin, 2013). In 2014, the 
Gameover Zeus botnet, used for banking fraud and distribution of CryptoLocker ran-
somware, was shut down. As a result of efforts such as these, Symantec estimates that 
the number of bots declined by 18% in 2014, from over 2.3 million in 2013 to 1.9 
million in 2014 (Symantec, 2015). In April 2015, an international cybersquad took down 
the Beebone botnet, made up of 12,000 computers that had been infecting about 30,000 
computers a month around the world via drive-by downlaods with Changeup, a poly-
morphic worm use to distribute Trojans, worms, backdoors, and other types of malware 
(Constantin, 2015).
Malicious code is a threat at both the client and the server levels, although servers 
generally engage in much more thorough anti-virus activities than do consumers. At 
the server level, malicious code can bring down an entire Web site, preventing mil-
lions of people from using the site. Such incidents are infrequent. Much more frequent 
malicious code attacks occur at the client level, and the damage can quickly spread 
to millions of other computers connected to the Internet. Table 4.4 lists some well-
known examples of malicious code.

POTENTIALLY UNWANTED PROGRAMS (PUPS)
In addition to malicious code, the e-commerce security environment is further chal-
lenged by potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) such as adware, browser para-
sites, spyware, and other applications that install themselves on a computer, such as 
rogue security software, typically without the user’s informed consent. Such programs 
are increasingly found on social network and user-generated content sites where users 
are fooled into downloading them. Once installed, these applications are usually 
exceedingly difficult to remove from the computer. One example of a PUP is System 
Doctor 2014, which infects PCs running Windows operating systems. System Doctor 
2014 poses as a legitimate anti-spyware program when in fact it is malware that, when 
installed, disables the user’s security software, alters the user’s Web browser, and 
diverts users to scam Web sites where more malware is downloaded.
Adware is typically used to call for pop-up ads to display when the user visits 
certain sites. While annoying, adware is not typically used for criminal activities. A 
browser parasite is a program that can monitor and change the settings of a user’s 
browser, for instance, changing the browser’s home page, or sending information about 
the sites visited to a remote computer. Browser parasites are often a component of 
adware. In early 2015, Lenovo faced a barrage of criticism when it became known that, 
since September 2014, it had been shipping its Windows laptops with Superfish adware 
preinstalled. Superfish injected its own shopping results into the computer’s browser 
when the user searched on Google, Amazon, or other Web sites. In the process, Superfish 
created a security risk by enabling others on a Wi-Fi network to silently hijack the 
browser and collect anything typed into it. Lenovo ultimately issued a removal tool to 
enable customers to delete the adware. 
Spyware, on the other hand, can be used to obtain information such as a user’s 
keystrokes, copies of e-mail and instant messages, and even take screenshots (and 
thereby capture passwords or other confidential data). 
PHISHING
Social engineering relies on human curiosity, greed, and gullibility in order to trick 
people into taking an action that will result in the downloading of malware. Kevin 
Mitnick, until his capture and imprisonment in 1999, was one of America’s most 
wanted computer criminals. Mitnick used simple deceptive techniques to obtain pass-
words, social security, and police records all without the use of any sophisticated 
technology (Mitnick, 2011).
Phishing is any deceptive, online attempt by a third party to obtain confidential 
information for financial gain. Phishing attacks typically do not involve malicious code 
but instead rely on straightforward misrepresentation and fraud, so-called “social engi-
neering” techniques. One of the most popular phishing attacks is the e-mail scam 
letter. The scam begins with an e-mail: a rich former oil minister of Nigeria is seeking 
a bank account to stash millions of dollars for a short period of time, and requests your 
bank account number where the money can be deposited. In return, you will receive 
a million dollars. This type of e-mail scam is popularly known as a “Nigerian letter” 
scam (see Figure 4.4).

Thousands of other phishing attacks use other scams, some pretending to be 
eBay, PayPal, or Citibank writing to you for account verification (known as spear 
phishing, or targeting a known customer of a specific bank or other type of busi-
ness). Click on a link in the e-mail and you will be taken to a Web site controlled by 
the scammer, and prompted to enter confidential information about your accounts, 
such as your account number and PIN codes. On any given day, millions of these 
phishing attack e-mails are sent, and, unfortunately, some people are fooled and 
disclose their personal account information.
Phishers rely on traditional “con man” tactics, but use e-mail to trick recipients 
into voluntarily giving up financial access codes, bank account numbers, credit card 
numbers, and other personal information. Often, phishers create (or “spoof”) a Web 
site that purports to be a legitimate financial institution and cons users into enter-
ing financial information, or the site downloads malware such as a keylogger to the 
victim’s computer. Phishers use the information they gather to commit fraudulent 
acts such as charging items to your credit cards or withdrawing funds from your bank 
account, or in other ways “steal your identity” (identity fraud). Symantec reported 
that in 2014, about 1 in every 965 e-mails contained a phishing attack. The number 
of spear-phishing attacks increased by 8%, with the average duration of campaigns 
reaching 9 days. In 2014, according to Symantec, over 40% of spear-phishing e-mails 
were directed at large organizations with more than 2,500 employees, and over 80% of

large organizations reported they were targeted in spear-phishing campaigns. Accord-
ing to Verizon, more than two-thirds of cyberespionage incidents in 2014 involved 
spear-phishing (Verizon, 2015; Symantec, 2015). 
To combat phishing, in January 2012, leading e-mail service providers, including 
Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and AOL, as well as financial services companies such as 
PayPal, Bank of America, and others, joined together to form DMARC.org, an organiza-
tion aimed at dramatically reducing e-mail address spoofing, in which attackers use real 
e-mail addresses to send phishing e-mails to victims who may be deceived because the 
e-mail appears to orginate from a source the receiver trusts. DMARC offers a method 
of authenticating the origin of the e-mail and allows receivers to quarantine, report, or 
reject messages that fall to pass its test. Yahoo and AOL have reported significant success 
against email fraud as a result of using DMARC, and in October 2015, Google announced 
that, effective as of June 2016, it was joining them in implementing a stricter version 
of DMARC, in which e-mail that fails DMARC authentication checks will be rejected 
(Vijayan, 2015).
HACKING, CYBERVANDALISM, AND HACKTIVISM
A hacker is an individual who intends to gain unauthorized access to a computer 
system. Within the hacking community, the term cracker is typically used to denote a 
hacker with criminal intent, although in the public press, the terms hacker and cracker 
tend to be used interchangeably. Hackers and crackers gain unauthorized access by 
finding weaknesses in the security procedures of Web sites and computer systems, often 
taking advantage of various features of the Internet that make it an open system that is 
easy to use. In the past, hackers and crackers typically were computer aficionados 
excited by the challenge of breaking into corporate and government Web sites. Some-
times they were satisfied merely by breaking into the files of an e-commerce site. Today, 
hackers have malicious intentions to disrupt, deface, or destroy sites (cybervandalism) 
or to steal personal or corporate information they can use for financial gain (data 
breach).
Hacktivism adds a political twist. Hacktivists typically attack governments, orga-
nizations, and even individuals for political purposes, employing the tactics of cyber-
vandalism, distributed denial of service attacks, data thefts, doxing (gathering and 
exposing personal information of public figures, originating from the term “documents” 
or “docx”), and more. LulzSec and Anonymous are two prominent hacktivist groups. 
In 2015, another hacktivist group called the Impact Team allegedly hacked the Ashley 
Madison Web site to call attention to its weak security, and after its owner Avid Life 
Media refused to shut it down as they demanded, the group released millions of sen-
sitive customer records. See the Insight on Society case study, The Ashley Madison Data 
Breach, for a more in-depth look at implications of this high-profile hack.
Groups of hackers called tiger teams are sometimes used by corporate security depart-
ments to test their own security measures. By hiring hackers to break into the system 
from the outside, the company can identify weaknesses in the computer system’s armor. 
These “good hackers” became known as white hats because of their role in helping 
organizations locate and fix security flaws. White hats do their work under contract, with 
agreement from clients that they will not be prosecuted for their efforts to break in.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE ASHLEY MADISON DATA BREACH
As the Internet continues to per-
meate even the most intimate aspects 
of our lives, the stigma attached to 
online dating has largely disappeared. 
Online dating has grown into a $2.2 
billion industry annually in the United 
States, led by companies like eHarmony, OKCupid, 
and Match. The online dating industry is one with 
excellent profit margins and growth potential, 
unlike many other Internet-based industries. These 
sites cater broadly to different demographics, and a 
number of smaller niche sites cater to people with 
more specific interests or lifestyles. While online 
dating has entered the mainstream, some of these 
niche sites are more controversial. Perhaps the 
most controversial site of all is Ashley Madison. 
Based in Canada and launched in 2001 by 
its parent company, Avid Life Media, Ashley 
Madison is certainly not emblematic of the rest 
of the online dating industry at large, which 
encourages healthy, monogamous relationships. 
Ashley Madison specifically markets itself to 
people in marriages or committed relationships, 
which has earned the site a tawdry reputation. 
Users purchase credits rather than a monthly 
subscription, and then redeem the credits to 
participate in conversations with other members, 
which can be through messages or real-time chat. 
Ashley Madison also uses fictitious female pro-
files to balance out the ratio of men and women 
on the site, which skews dramatically towards 
men. Women are also not charged money to 
create a profile on the site, nor are they charged 
to send or receive messages, while men are 
charged for both. 
The perception of secrecy is critical for pro-
spective users of Ashley Madison, many of whom 
undoubtedly want to cheat and get away with it 
without anyone knowing. But in 2015, the veil of 
secrecy for the site’s millions of members came 
crashing down. The site was hacked by a group 
known as The Impact Team, which stated that its 
motivations were to harm the site and its unethi-
cal business model, as well as to protest the site’s 
use of a $19 data deletion fee for users seeking 
to close their accounts. The Impact Team stated 
that after creating a plan to make an undetect-
able breach, they discovered they were easily able 
to access the entire cache of company data. They 
released the data in two batches of 10 and 12 
gigabytes, and the data is now easily searchable 
on the Web. Names, street addresses, and dates of 
birth were all stolen and made public, as well as 
interests and other personal information. They also 
stole company documents, including the e-mails 
of CEO Noel Biderman, many of which caused 
further damage to the company’s shattered repu-
tation. For example, Biderman’s e-mails revealed 
that the CTO of Ashley Madison, Raja Bhatia, 
had hacked a competitor’s database, revealing 
key security flaws (perhaps he should have been 
paying more attention to his own company’s secu-
rity systems). Partial credit card information of 
Ashley Madison users was also leaked, but not 
enough for identity thieves to use. 
Demographic information gleaned from the 
data dump shows that of the site’s 36 million 
users, 31 million were males, and only 10 million 
of those were actively involved in site features like 
chatting with other members. The other 5 million 
profiles were female, but not even 2,500 of those 
were involved in chats with other users, suggest-
ing that fake female profiles were the overwhelm-
ing majority of female profiles on the site. A full 
third of the accounts on the site were created with 
dummy e-mail addresses. North Americans had 
the highest number of accounts as a percentage 
of population, with the United States coming in

at 5.1%. E-mail addresses associated with 
government accounts were well-represented, 
as were big banks, large tech companies, and 
other high-powered industries. This stands in stark 
demographic contrast to a service like Tinder, 
which consists of much younger members; Ashley 
Madison users tended to be more established 
financially and willing to pay for what they per-
ceived to be a discreet and upscale service.
How could a site which advertises the ability 
to discreetly have an affair allow its data to be 
breached and stolen so easily? Security experts 
reviewing Ashley Madison’s setup claimed that the 
site lacked even simplistic security measures. For 
example, all of the data belonging to users who 
paid the $19 data deletion fee persisted on Ashley 
Madison servers and was obtained in the hack. Addi-
tionally, none of the data was encrypted. Encryption 
would have incurred hefty additional expense for 
the company, but it might have saved it consider-
able embarrassment during a breach like this one.
Most data breaches allow criminals to engage 
in identity theft and other types of online fraud. 
But in this case, the Ashley Madison hack has even 
more significant ramifications on the personal lives 
of users on the site. There are already multiple 
reported incidents of suicides committed by former 
users, and a handful of notable public figures have 
been publicly embarrassed by the release of their 
profile data. The hack has the potential to ruin 
the marriages and personal lives of thousands of 
people. Of course, one could argue that by creat-
ing a profile on a Web site explicitly designed to 
help people cheat on their spouses and significant 
others, Ashley Madison’s users don’t have justifi-
cation to be upset. But these people were still the 
victims of a crime and an invasion of privacy that 
goes beyond typical data breaches. Spammers have 
used the now-public data to extort users, demanding 
Bitcoin in exchange for silence and threatening to 
share Ashley Madison data with users’ families and 
social media contacts. Ashley Madison can expect a 
barrage of lawsuits alleging negligence and personal 
damages. If the company fails to show that it did 
enough to protect its customers’ data, it’s likely to 
be defeated soundly in court.
As a result of the hack, Biderman quickly 
stepped down from his post as CEO. The company 
then offered a reward of over $350,000 for infor-
mation about The Impact Team and its members, 
though there are no credible leads as of this writing. 
Going forward, the revelations about fake profiles, 
impending lawsuits, and overall negative coverage 
of the breach will likely derail plans for growth. 
Ashley Madison has already struggled to market 
its business and raise funds in the past, despite its 
very solid financial profile. Ashley Madison earned 
$115.5 million in revenue in 2014 along with $55 
million in profits, significant increases over figures 
from the previous year. The company was growing 
so fast that Biderman had started investigating 
launching an IPO in England to fuel its expansion. 
Although Ashley Madison had been highly profit-
able, investors and advertisers have unsurprisingly 
balked at the association with adultery. After the 
breach, future investments are likely to be much 
more difficult to come by, and thanks to a hack 
made possible by its nonexistent security proce-
dures, the site may quickly find profits difficult to 
come by as well. Ashley Madison’s business model 
was dependent on its users trusting in the site’s dis-
cretion and ability to keep their accounts a secret; 
for that reason, they may be particularly susceptible 
to fallout from a data breach of this magnitude.

In contrast, black hats are hackers who engage in the same kinds of activities 
but without pay or any buy-in from the targeted organization, and with the intention 
of causing harm. They break into Web sites and reveal the confidential or proprietary 
information they find. These hackers believe strongly that information should be free, 
so sharing previously secret information is part of their mission.
Somewhere in the middle are the grey hats, hackers who believe they are pursuing 
some greater good by breaking in and revealing system flaws. Grey hats discover weak-
nesses in a system’s security, and then publish the weakness without disrupting the site 
or attempting to profit from their finds. Their only reward is the prestige of discovering 
the weakness. Grey hat actions are suspect, however, especially when the hackers reveal 
security flaws that make it easier for other criminals to gain access to a system.
DATA BREACHES
A data breach occurs whenever organizations lose control over corporate informa-
tion to outsiders. According to Symantec, the total number of data breaches in 2014 
grew by over 20% compared to 2013 (Symantec, 2015). The number of data breaches 
tracked by the Identity Theft Resource Center in the United States reached an all-
time high of 783 (Dell Inc., 2015). Although fewer “mega” breaches occurred in 2014, 
data breaches exposed an estimated 348 million U.S. identities. Hackers are the 
leading cause of data breaches and were responsible for almost 50% of the data 
breaches that occurred in 2014 and 75% of the identities disposed. Accidental dis-
closures were the second most common cause, accounting for 22% of breaches, while 
the theft or loss of a computer or hard drive ranked third, causing 21% of breaches. 
Among the high profile breaches that occurred in 2014 were those affecting eBay, 
which announced a breach involving user names, passwords, phone numbers, and 
addresses in May 2014 affecting 145 million of its users, JPMorgan Chase, which 
exposed 76 million records, and Home Depot, which announced in September 2014 
that data from 56 million cards had been taken in a months-long security breach. In 
November 2014, in another very high-profile data breach, hackers infiltrated Sony’s 
servers and exposed a wide range of data, including the contents of e-mails and 
internal documents related to Sony employees and actors. In 2015, the trend has 
continued, with numerous high-profile data breaches, including several against gov-
ernment agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management and the Internal 
Revenue Service, as well as others against health-care insurers such as Anthem, 
retailers such as CVS and Walgreens, and the credit rating agency Experian. 
CREDIT CARD FRAUD/THEFT
Theft of credit card data is one of the most feared occurrences on the Internet. Fear 
that credit card information will be stolen prevents users from making online pur-
chases in many cases. Interestingly, this fear appears to be largely unfounded. Inci-
dences of stolen credit card information are actually much lower than users think, 
around 0.9% of all online card transactions (CyberSource, 2015). Online merchants 
use a variety of techniques to combat credit card fraud, including using automated 
fraud detection tools, manually reviewing orders, and rejection of suspect orders.

In addition, U.S. federal law limits the liability of individuals to $50 for a stolen 
credit card. For amounts more than $50, the credit card company generally pays the 
amount, although in some cases, the merchant may be held liable if it failed to verify 
the account or consult published lists of invalid cards. Banks recoup the cost of credit 
card fraud by charging higher interest rates on unpaid balances, and by merchants who 
raise prices to cover the losses. In 2015, the U.S. credit card system is in the midst of 
a shift to EMV credit cards, also known as smart cards or chip cards. Already widely 
used in Europe, EMV credit cards have a computer chip instead of a magnetic strip 
that can be easily copied by hackers and sold as dump data (see Table 4.2). While EMV 
technology cannot prevent data breaches from occurring, the hope is that it will make 
it harder for criminals to profit from stolen cards.
In the past, the most common cause of credit card fraud was a lost or stolen card 
that was used by someone else, followed by employee theft of customer numbers and 
stolen identities (criminals applying for credit cards using false identities). Today, the 
most frequent cause of stolen cards and card information is the systematic hacking and 
looting of a corporate server where the information on millions of credit card purchases 
is stored. For instance, in 2010, Albert Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in prison for 
organizing one of the largest thefts of credit card numbers in American history. Along 
with several Russian co-conspirators, Gonzalez broke into the central computer systems 
of TJX, BJ’s, Barnes & Noble, and other companies, stealing over 160 million card 
numbers and costing these firms over $200 million in losses (Fox and Botelho, 2013).
International orders have a much higher risk of being fraudulent, with fraud losses 
twice that of domestic orders. If an international customer places an order and then 
later disputes it, online merchants often have no way to verify that the package was 
actually delivered and that the credit card holder is the person who placed the order. 
As a result, most online merchants will not process international orders.
A central security issue of e-commerce is the difficulty of establishing the customer’s 
identity. Currently there is no technology that can identify a person with absolute cer-
tainty. Until a customer’s identity can be guaranteed, online companies are at a higher 
risk of loss than traditional offline companies. The federal government has attempted to 
address this issue through the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 
Act (the “E-Sign” law), which gives digital signatures the same authority as hand-written 
signatures in commerce. This law also intended to make digital signatures more com-
monplace and easier to use. Although the use of e-signatures is still uncommon in the 
B2C retail e-commerce arena, many businesses are starting to implement e-signature 
solutions, particularly for B2B contracting, financial services, insurance, health care, 
and government and professional services. DocuSign, Adobe eSign, RightSignature, 
and Silanis e-SignLive are currently among the most widely adopted e-signature solu-
tions. They use a variety of techniques, such as remote user identification through 
third-party databases or personal information verification such as a photo of a driver’s 
license; multi-factor user authentication methods (user ID and password, e-mail address 
verification, secret question and answer); and public/private key encryption to create 
a digital signature and embedded audit trail that can be used to verify the e-signature’s 
integrity (Silanis Technology, 2014). Mobile e-signature solutions are also beginning to 
be adopted by early movers (DocuSign, 2015).

IDENTITY FRAUD
Identity fraud involves the unauthorized use of another person’s personal data, such 
as social security, driver’s license, and/or credit card numbers, as well as user names 
and passwords, for illegal financial benefit. Criminals can use such data to obtain loans, 
purchase merchandise, or obtain other services, such as mobile phone or other utility 
services. Cybercriminals employ many of the techniques described previously, such 
as spyware, phishing, data breaches, and credit card theft, for the purpose of identity 
fraud. Data breaches, in particular, often lead to identity fraud: in 2013, one in three 
data breach notification recipients later became a victim. 
Identity fraud is a significant problem in the United States and around the world. 
In 2014, according to Javelin Strategy & Research, 12.7 million U.S. consumers suffered 
identity fraud. The total dollar losses as a result of identity fraud were approximately 
$16 billion (Javelin Research & Strategy, 2015). 
SPOOFING, PHARMING, AND SPAM (JUNK) WEB SITES
Spoofing involves attempting to hide a true identity by using someone else’s e-mail or 
IP address. For instance, a spoofed e-mail will have a forged sender e-mail address 
designed to mislead the receiver about who sent the e-mail. IP spoofing involves the 
creation of TCP/IP packets that use someone else’s source IP address, indicating that the 
packets are coming from a trusted host. Most current routers and firewalls can offer pro-
tection against IP spoofing. Spoofing a Web site sometimes involves pharming, auto-
matically redirecting a Web link to an address different from the intended one, with the 
site masquerading as the intended destination. Links that are designed to lead to one site 
can be reset to send users to a totally unrelated site—one that benefits the hacker.
Although spoofing and pharming do not directly damage files or network servers, 
they threaten the integrity of a site. For example, if hackers redirect customers to a 
fake Web site that looks almost exactly like the true site, they can then collect and 
process orders, effectively stealing business from the true site. Or, if the intent is to 
disrupt rather than steal, hackers can alter orders—inflating them or changing prod-
ucts ordered—and then send them on to the true site for processing and delivery. 
Customers become dissatisfied with the improper order shipment, and the company 
may have huge inventory fluctuations that impact its operations.
In addition to threatening integrity, spoofing also threatens authenticity by making 
it difficult to discern the true sender of a message. Clever hackers can make it almost 
impossible to distinguish between a true and a fake identity or Web address.
Spam (junk) Web sites (also sometimes referred to as link farms) are a little dif-
ferent. These are sites that promise to offer some product or service, but in fact are 
just a collection of advertisements for other sites, some of which contain malicious 
code. For instance, you may search for “[name of town] weather,” and then click on a 
link that promises your local weather, but then discover that all the site does is display 
ads for weather-related products or other Web sites. Junk or spam Web sites typically 
appear on search results, and do not involve e-mail. These sites cloak their identities 
by using domain names similar to legitimate firm names, and redirect traffic to known 
spammer-redirection domains such as topsearch10.com.

SNIFFING AND MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS
A sniffer is a type of eavesdropping program that monitors information traveling over 
a network. When used legitimately, sniffers can help identify potential network trou-
ble-spots, but when used for criminal purposes, they can be damaging and very dif-
ficult to detect. Sniffers enable hackers to steal proprietary information from anywhere 
on a network, including passwords, e-mail messages, company files, and confidential 
reports. For instance, in 2013, five hackers were charged in another worldwide hacking 
scheme that targeted the corporate networks of retail chains such as 7-Eleven and the 
French retailer Carrefour SA, using sniffer programs to steal more than 160 million 
credit card numbers (Voreacos, 2013).
E-mail wiretaps are a variation on the sniffing threat. An e-mail wiretap is a method 
for recording or journaling e-mail traffic generally at the mail server level from any 
individual. E-mail wiretaps are used by employers to track employee messages, and by 
government agencies to surveil individuals or groups. E-mail wiretaps can be installed 
on servers and client computers. In the United States, the USA PATRIOT Act permits 
the FBI to compel ISPs to install a black box on their mail servers that can impound the 
e-mail of a single person or group of persons for later analysis. In the case of American 
citizens communicating with other citizens, an FBI agent or government lawyer need 
only certify to a judge on the secret 11-member U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Court (FISC) that the information sought is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation 
to get permission to install the program. Judges have no discretion. They must approve 
wiretaps based on government agents’ unsubstantiated assertions. In the case of sus-
pected terrorist activity, law enforcement does not have to inform a court prior to install-
ing a wire or e-mail tap. A 2007 amendment to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act, known as FISA, provided new powers to the National Security Agency to monitor 
international e-mail and telephone communications where one person is in the United 
States, and where the purpose of such interception is to collect foreign intelligence 
(Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; Protect America Act of 2007). The FISA 
Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2012 extends the provisions of FISA for five more 
years, until 2017. NSA’s XKeyscore program, revealed by Edward Snowden, is a form of 
“wiretap” that allows NSA analysts to search through vast databases containing not only 
e-mail, but online chats, and browsing histories of millions of individuals (Wills, 2013).
The U.S. Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires 
all communications carriers (including ISPs) to provide near-instant access to law 
enforcement agencies to their message traffic. Many Internet services (such as Face-
book and Linked­In) that have built-in ISP services technically are not covered by 
CALEA. One can only assume these non-ISP e-mail operators cooperate with law 
enforcement. Unlike the past where wiretaps required many hours to physically tap 
into phone lines, in today’s digital phone systems, taps are arranged in a few minutes 
by the large carriers at their expense. 
A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack also involves eavesdropping but is more 
active than a sniffing attack, which typically involves passive monitoring. In a MitM 
attack, the attacker is able to intercept communications between two parties who 
believe they are directly communicating with one another, when in fact the attacker 
is controlling the communications.

DENIAL OF SERVICE (DOS) AND DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) 
ATTACKS
In a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, hackers flood a Web site with useless pings or 
page requests that inundate and overwhelm the site’s Web servers. Increasingly, DoS 
attacks involve the use of bot networks and so-called “distributed attacks” built from 
thousands of compromised client computers. DoS attacks typically cause a Web site 
to shut down, making it impossible for users to access the site. For busy e-commerce 
sites, these attacks are costly; while the site is shut down, customers cannot make 
purchases. And the longer a site is shut down, the more damage is done to a site’s 
reputation. Although such attacks do not destroy information or access restricted areas 
of the server, they can destroy a firm’s online business. Often, DoS attacks are accom-
panied by attempts at blackmailing site owners to pay tens or hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to the hackers in return for stopping the DoS attack.
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack uses hundreds or even thou-
sands of computers to attack the target network from numerous launch points. DoS 
and DDoS attacks are threats to a system’s operation because they can shut it down 
indefinitely. Major Web sites have experienced such attacks, making the companies 
aware of their vulnerability and the need to continually introduce new measures to 
prevent future attacks. According to Akamai, the number of DDoS attacks in 2nd 
quarter of 2015 increased by over 130% compared to same period in 2014. One new 
technique increasingly being used targets insecure routers and other home devices 
such as webcams that use UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to amplify the attacks 
(Akamai, 2015). In another measure of the prevalence of DDoS attacks, in an Arbor 
Networks survey of 287 ISP and network operators around the world, respondents 
noted that DDoS attacks against customers constituted the number one operational 
threat, with nearly 50% of respondents experiencing DDoS attacks during the survey 
period. Arbor Networks also reported that the size of reported DDoS attacks in terms 
of bandwidth consumed continued to increase in 2014, with attackers using reflection/
amplification techniques to create attacks reaching 400 Gpbs (Arbor Networks, 2015). 
Another trend is DDoS smokescreening, in which attackers use DDoS as a distraction 
while they also insert malware or viruses or steal data. A 2015 survey of 760 security 
and IT professionals in companies in North America and Europe, the Middle East, and 
Africa conducted by Neustar found that 36% reported that a virus or malware was 
installed as a result of the DDoS attack, while nearly 40% also experienced a theft of 
data or funds (Neustar, 2015). And not surprisingly, now that mobile data connections 
have become faster and more stable, hackers are beginning to harness mobile devices 
for mobile-based DDoS attacks. A recent attack originating from China used malicious 
ads loaded inside mobile apps and mobile browesrs as the attack mechanism 
(Majkowski, 2015). 
China also appears to have been behind another major DDoS attack in March 2015 
against the software development platform GitHub, aimed specifically at two Chinese 
anti-censorship projects hosted on the platform. Researchers say the attack was an 
example of a new tool they have nicknamed the Great Cannon. Although originally 
thought to be part of China’s Great Firewall censorship system, further investigation 
revealed that the Great Cannon is a separate distinct offensive system that is co-
Denial of Service

located with the Great Firewall. The Great Cannon enables hackers to hijack traffic to 
individual IP addresses and uses a man-in-the-middle attack to replace unencrypted 
content between a Web server and the user with malicious Javascript that would load 
the two GitHub project pages every two seconds (Kirk, 2015b; Essers, 2015).
INSIDER ATTACKS
We tend to think of security threats to a business as originating outside the organiza-
tion. In fact, the largest financial threats to business institutions come not from rob-
beries but from embezzlement by insiders. Bank employees steal far more money than 
bank robbers. The same is true for e-commerce sites. Some of the largest disruptions to 
service, destruction to sites, and diversion of customer credit data and personal infor-
mation have come from insiders—once trusted employees. Employees have access to 
privileged information, and, in the presence of sloppy internal security procedures, 
they are often able to roam throughout an organization’s systems without leaving a 
trace. Research from Carnegie Mellon University documents the significant damage 
insiders have done to both private and public organizations (Software Engineering 
Institute, 2012). Survey results also indicate that insiders are more likely to be the 
source of cyberattacks than outsiders, and to cause more damage to an organization 
than external attacks (PWC, 2015). In some instances, the insider might not have crimi-
nal intent, but inadvertently exposes data that can then be exploited by others. For 
instance, a Ponemon Institute study found that negligent insiders are a top cause of 
data breaches (Ponemon Institute, 2015c). Another study based on an analysis of the 
behavior of 10 million users during the second quarter of 2015 estimated that 1% of 
employees are responsible for 75% of cloud-related enterprise security risk, by reusing 
or sending out plain-text passwords, indiscriminately sharing fiiles, using risky applica-
tions, or accidentally downloading malware or clicking phishing links (Korolov, 2015).
POORLY DESIGNED SOFTWARE
Many security threats prey on poorly designed software, sometimes in the operating 
system and sometimes in the application software, including browsers. The increase 
in complexity and size of software programs, coupled with demands for timely deliv-
ery to markets, has contributed to an increase in software flaws or vulnerabilities that 
hackers can exploit. For instance, SQL injection attacks take advantage of vulnera-
bilities in poorly coded Web application software that fails to properly validate or filter 
data entered by a user on a Web page to introduce malicious program code into a 
company’s systems and networks. An attacker can use this input validation error to 
send a rogue SQL query to the underlying database to access the database, plant mali-
cious code, or access other systems on the network. Large Web applications have 
hundreds of places for inputting user data, each of which creates an opportunity for 
an SQL injection attack. A large number of Web-facing applications are believed to 
have SQL injection vulnerabilities, and tools are available for hackers to check Web 
applications for these vulnerabilities.
Each year, security firms identify thousands of software vulnerabilities in Internet 
browsers, PC, Macintosh, and Linux software, as well as mobile device operating 
systems and applications. According to Microsoft, vulnerability disclosures across the 
SQL injection attack
takes advantage of poorly 
coded Web application 
software that fails to 
properly validate or filter 
data entered by a user on a 
Web page 

software industry in the second half of 2014 increased by 56% compared to the same 
period in 2013. Over 4,500 vulnerabilities were identified, the highest number in any 
six-month period in the history of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system 
that was originally launched in 1999 (Microsoft, 2015). Browser vulnerabilities in par-
ticular are a popular target, as well as browser plug-ins such as for Adobe Reader. A 
zero-day vulnerability is one that has been previously unreported and for which no 
patch yet exists. In 2014, 25 zero-day vulnerabilities were reported, up from 14 in 2013 
(Kirk, 2015). The trend continues in 2015. For instance, four zero-day vulnerabilities 
involving Microsoft’s Internet Explorer were disclosed in a single day in July 2015. 
The very design of the personal computer includes many open communication ports 
that can be used, and indeed are designed to be used, by external computers to send 
and receive messages. Ports that are frequently attacked include TCP port 445 (Micro-
soft-DS), port 80 (WWW/HTTP), and 443 (SSL/HTTPS). Given their complexity and 
design objectives, all operating systems and application software, including Linux and 
Macintosh, have vulnerabilities. 
In April 2014, a flaw in the OpenSSL encryption system, used by millions of Web 
sites, known as the Heartbleed bug, was discovered (see Section 4.3 for a further 
discussion of SSL). The vulnerability allowed hackers to decrypt an SSL session and 
discover user names, passwords, and other user data, by using OpenSSL in combina-
tion with a communications protocol called the RFC6520 heartbeat that helps a remote 
user remain in touch after connecting with a Web site server. In the process a small 
chunk of the server’s memory content can leak out (hence the name heartbleed), 
potentially large enough to hold a password or encryption key that would allow a 
hacker to exploit the server further. The Heartbleed bug also affected over 1,300 
Android apps (Trend Micro, 2014). In September 2014, another vulnerability known 
as ShellShock or BashBug that affected most versions of Linux and Unix, as well as 
Mac OS X, was revealed. ShellShock enabled attackers to use CGI (see Chapter 3) to 
add malicious commands (Symantec, 2015). In March 2015, researchers announced 
that they had discovered a new SSL/TLS vulnerability that they named FREAK (Fac-
toring Attack on RSA-Export Keys) that allows man-in-the-middle attacks that enable 
the interception and decryption of encrypted communications between clients and 
servers, which would then allow the attackers to steal passwords and other personal 
information. More than one-third of encrypted Web sites were reportedly open to 
attack via this security vulnerability, including those for the White House, the FBI, 
and the National Security Agency (Vaughan-Nichols, 2015).
SOCIAL NETWORK SECURITY ISSUES
Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Tumblr provide a 
rich and rewarding environment for hackers. Viruses, site takeovers, identity fraud, 
malware-loaded apps, click hijacking, phishing, and spam are all found on social net-
works. According to Symantec, the most common type of scam on social media sites 
in 2014 were manual sharing scams, where victims unwittingly shared videos, stories, 
and pictures that included links to malicious sites. Fake offerings that invite victims 
to join a fake event or group with incentives such as free gift cards and that require 
a user to share his or her information with the attacker were another common tech-
zero-day vulnerability

has been previously unre-
ported and for which no

nique. Other techniques include fake Like buttons that, when clicked, install malware 
and post updates to the user’s Newsfeed, further spreading the attack, and fake apps 
(Symantec, 2015). By sneaking in among our friends, hackers can masquerade as 
friends and dupe users into scams. 
Social network firms have thus far been relatively poor policemen because they 
have failed to aggressively weed out accounts that send visitors to malware sites 
(unlike Google, which maintains a list of known malware sites and patrols its search 
results looking for links to malware sites). Social networks are open: anyone can set 
up a personal page, even criminals. Most attacks are social engineering attacks that 
tempt visitors to click on links that sound reasonable. Social apps downloaded from 
either the social network or a foreign site are not certified by the social network to be 
clean of malware. It’s “clicker beware.”
MOBILE PLATFORM SECURITY ISSUES
The explosion in mobile devices has broadened opportunities for hackers. Mobile 
users are filling their devices with personal and financial information, and using them 
to conduct an increasing number of transactions, from retail purchases to mobile 
banking, making them excellent targets for hackers. In general, mobile devices face 
all the same risks as any Internet device as well as some new risks associated with 
wireless network security. For instance, public Wi-Fi networks that are not secured 
are very susceptible to hacking. While most PC users are aware their computers and 
Web sites may be hacked and contain malware, most cell phone users believe their cell 
phone is as secure as a traditional landline phone. As with social network members, 
mobile users are prone to think they are in a shared, trustworthy environment.
Mobile cell phone malware (sometimes referred to as malicious mobile apps 
(MMAs) or rogue mobile apps) was developed as early as 2004 with Cabir, a Bluetooth 
worm affecting Symbian operating systems (Nokia phones) and causing the phone to 
continuously seek out other Bluetooth-enabled devices, quickly draining the battery. 
The iKee.B worm, first discovered in 2009, only two years after the iPhone was intro-
duced, infected jailbroken iPhones, turning the phones into botnet-controlled devices. 
An iPhone in Europe could be hacked by an iPhone in the United States, and all its 
private data sent to a server in Poland. IKee.B established the feasibility of cell phone 
botnets. 
By the end of 2014, Symantec had identified more than 1 million apps that it clas-
sified as malware, and it expects the growth in mobile malware to continue in 2015 and 
become more aggressive in targeting mobile payment and mobile banking applications. 
The majority of mobile malware still targets the Android platform. For instance, Syman-
tec has already discovered Android malware that can intercept text messages with 
bank authentication codes and forward them to attackers, as well as fake versions of 
legitimate mobile banking applications. However, the Apple iPhone platform is begin-
ning to be increasingly targeted as well, and in 2015, Chinese hackers infected Xcode, 
Apple’s integrated suite of development tools for creating iOS appps, and as a result, 
unsuspecting Chinese iOS developers unknowingly created thousands of apps with the 
malicious code (Keizer, 2015). And it is not just rogue applications that are dangerous, 

but also popular legitimate applications that simply have little protection from hackers. 
For instance, in 2014, security researchers revealed that the Starbucks mobile app, the 
most used mobile payment app in the United States, was storing user names, e-mail 
addresses, and passwords in clear text, in such a way that anyone with access to the 
phone could see the passwords and user names by connecting the phone to a computer. 
According to researchers, Starbucks erred in emphasizing convenience and ease of use 
in the design of the app over security concerns (Schuman, 2014).
Vishing attacks target gullible cell phone users with verbal messages to call a 
certain number and, for example, donate money to starving children in Haiti. Smish-
ing attacks exploit SMS/text messages. Compromised text messages can contain e-mail 
and Web site addresses that can lead the innocent user to a malware site. Criminal 
SMS spoofing services have emerged, which conceal the cybercriminal’s true phone 
number, replacing it with a false alpha-numeric name. SMS spoofing can also be used 
by cybercriminals to lure mobile users to a malicious Web site by sending a text that 
appears to be from a legitimate organization in the From field, and suggesting the 
receiver click on a malicious URL hyperlink to update an account or obtain a gift card. 
A small number of downloaded apps from app stores have also contained malware. 
Madware—innocent-looking apps that contain adware that launches pop-up ads and 
text messages on your mobile device—is also becoming an increasing problem. An 
examination of 2.3 million apps in 2014 that Symantec classified as grayware (programs 
that do not contain viruses and are not overtly malicious, but which can be annoy-
ing or harmful) found that 1.3 million of those ads were madware (Symantec, 2015).
Read the Insight on Technology case, Think Your Smartphone Is Secure? for a further 
discussion of some of the issues surrounding smartphone security.
CLOUD SECURITY ISSUES
The move of so many Internet services into the cloud also raises security risks. From 
an infrastructure standpoint, DDoS attacks threaten the availability of cloud services 
on which more and more companies are relying. According to Alert Logic, which ana-
lyzed 1 billion security events in the IT environments of more than 3,000 enterprise 
customers, attacks against cloud-based services and applications increased by 45% in 
2014. Alert Logic also found a a 36% increase in suspicious activity in cloud environ-
ment, such as attempts to scan the infrastructure (Alert Logic, 2015). Safeguarding 
data being maintained in a public cloud environment is also a major concern. For 
example, researchers identified several ways data could be accessed without authori-
zation on Dropbox, which offers a popular cloud file-sharing service. In 2014, compro-
mising photos of as many as 100 celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence were posted 
online, reportedly stolen from Apple’s iCloud. Although initially it was thought that 
the breach was made possible by a vulnerability in Apple’s Find My iPhone API, it 
instead apparently resulted from lower-tech phishing attacks that yielded passwords 
that could be used to connect to iCloud. A similar hack into writer Mat Honan’s Apple 
iCloud account using social engineering tactics in 2012 allowed the hackers to wipe 
everything from his Mac computer, iPhone, and iPad, which were linked to the cloud 
service, as well as take over his Twitter and Gmail accounts (Honan, 2012). These

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THINK YOUR SMARTPHONE IS SECURE?
So far, there have been few publicly 
identified, large-scale, smartphone 
security breaches, but just because 
it hasn’t happened yet doesn’t mean 
it won’t. With about 190 million smart-
phone users in the United States, business 
firms increasingly switching their employees to 
the mobile platform, and consumers using their 
phones for financial transactions and even paying 
bills, the size and richness of the smartphone 
target for hackers is growing.
Many users believe their smartphones 
are unlikely to be hacked because Apple and 
Google are protecting them from malware, and 
that Verizon and AT&T can keep the cell phone 
network secure just as they do the land-line phone 
system. Telephone systems are “closed” and there-
fore not subject to the kinds of attacks that occur 
on the open Internet. 
But hackers can do to a smartphone just 
about anything they can do to any Internet device: 
request malicious files without user intervention, 
delete files, transmit files, install programs running 
in the background that can monitor user actions, 
and potentially convert the smartphone into a 
robot that can be used in a botnet to send e-mail 
and text messages to anyone.
Apps are an emerging avenue for poten-
tial security breaches. Apple and Google now 
offer over 3 million apps collectively. Apple 
claims that it examines each and every app to 
ensure that it plays by Apple’s App Store rules, 
but risks remain. Most of the known cases that 
have occurred thus far have involved jailbro-
ken phones. The first iPhone app confirmed to 
have embedded malware made it past Apple into 
the App Store in July 2012. However, security 
company Kaspersky expects the iPhone to face 
an onslaught of malware going forward. Apple’s 
app rules make some user information available 
to all apps by default, including the user’s GPS 
position and name. However, a rogue app could 
easily do much more. Nicolas Seriot, a Swiss 
researcher, built a test app called SpyPhone 
that was capable of tracking users and all their 
activities, then transmitting this data to remote 
servers, all without user knowledge. The app 
harvested geolocation data, passwords, address 
book entries, and e-mail account information. 
Apple removed the app once it was identified. In 
2014, malware known as WireLurker attacked 
iPhone and iPad users in China via the Mac OS 
X operating system, representing the first attack 
on iPhones that were not jailbroken. Apple 
quickly moved to remove affected apps, but the 
attack was a warning sign that the iOS system 
is not likely to be a malware-free environment 
going forward. That these apps were initially 
accepted by the App Store staff of reviewers 
suggests Apple cannot effectively review new 
apps prior to their use. In addition, companies 
are increasingly using enterprising provisioning, 
which allows them to distribute apps to employ-
ees without Apple’s review so long as the apps 
are signed with an Apple-issued enterprise cer-
tificate. Attackers have been able to hijack this 
app distribution mechanism to sideload apps on 
non-jailbroken devices, as demonstrated by both 
the WireLurker attack noted above and another 
threat known as XAgent, which can collect data 
from compromised devices including SMS mes-
sages, contacts, photos, and GPS locations, and 
which can also remotely activate voice recording 
on compromised devices. And thanks to Apple’s 
walled garden approach to the iOS platform, 
third parties are not able to develop services to 
protect Apple devices as easily as they may be 
able to with Android.

But Android’s security future appears just 
as murky. The amount of malware on the Android 
platform has skyrocketed over the past few years, 
with the number of spyware apps quadrupling from 
its level just a few years ago. According to the 
Pulse Secure Mobile Threat Center, 97% of all 
mobile malware in 2014 targeted Android devices, 
and according to Verizon, more than 5 billion 
downloaded Android apps are vulnerable to remote 
attacks, particularly via a vulnerability known as 
JavaScript-Binding-Over-HTTP (JBOH), which 
enables an attacker to execute code remotely on 
Android devices that have affected apps. In part 
this is due to the fact that security on that plat-
form is much less under the control of Google 
because it employs an “open” app model com-
pared to Apple’s “walled garden” approach, which 
makes security flaws easier to detect. In addition, 
in the past, Google did not review Android apps, 
instead relying on user input and technical hurdles 
to limit malware. However, in 2013, in response to 
the growing malware problem, Google launched 
a universal app-scanning system that instantly 
checks each app for malicious code at the device 
level.
Android apps can use any personal informa-
tion found on a phone but they must also inform 
the user what each app is capable of doing, and 
what personal data it requires. Google removes 
any apps that break its rules against malicious 
activity. Google can also perform a remote wipe 
of offending apps from all Droid phones without 
user intervention. In one incident, Google pulled 
down dozens of mobile banking apps made by 
a developer called 09Droid. The apps claimed 
to give users access to their accounts at 
many banks throughout the world. In fact, 
the apps were unable to connect users to any 
bank, and were removed before they could do 
much harm. Google does take preventive steps 
to reduce malware apps such as requiring devel-
opers to register and be approved by Google 
before they can distribute apps through Google 
Play. 
Beyond the threat of rogue apps, smartphones 
of all stripes are susceptible to browser-based 
malware that takes advantage of vulnerabilities 
in all browsers. In addition, most smartphones, 
including the iPhone, permit the manufactur-
ers to remotely download configuration files to 
update operating systems and security protections. 
Unfortunately, flaws in the public key encryption 
procedures that permit remote server access to 
iPhones have been discovered, raising further 
questions about the security of such operations. 
Attackers have also developed methods of hijack-
ing phones using weaknesses in SIM cards. There 
are at least 500 million vulnerable SIM cards in 
use today, and the defects allow hackers to obtain 
the encryption key that guards users’ personal 
information, granting them nearly complete access 
over the phone in the process.
In 2015, documents obtained by Edward 
Snowden indicated that the United States and 
Great Britain had hacked into Gemalto, a man-
ufacturer of SIM cards, and obtained encryp-
tion keys that allowed them to surveil mobile 
phone users across the globe. The investigation 
is still ongoing, but suddenly, our smartphones 
and tablets don’t seem quite as safe anymore.

INTERNET OF THINGS SECURITY CHALLENGES
incidents highlight the risks involved as devices, identities, and data become more 
and more interconnected in the cloud. A 2014 Ponemon Insititute study found that 
the majority of IT and IT security practitioners surveyed felt that the likelihood of a 
data breach increases due to the cloud, in part due to the fact that many organizations 
do not thoroughly examine cloud security before deploying cloud services (Ponemon 
Institute, 2014).
INTERNET OF THINGS SECURITY ISSUES
As you learned in Chapter 2, the Internet of Things (IoT) involves the use of the 
Internet to connect a wide variety of sensors, devices, and machines, and is powering 
the development of a multitude of smart connected things, such as home electronics 
(smart TVs, thermostats, home security systems, and more), connected cars, medical 
devices and industrial equipment that supports manufacturing, energy, transporta-
tion, and other industrial sectors. IoT raises a host of security issues that are in some 
ways similar to existing security issues, but even more challenging, given the need to 
deal with a wider range of devices, operating in a less controlled, global environment, 
and with an expanded range of attack. In a world of connected things, the devices, the 
data produced and used by the devices, and the systems and applications supported 
by those devices, can all potentially be attacked (IBM, 2015). Table 4.5 takes a closer 
look at some of the unique security challenges posed by IoT identified by the Internet 
C H A L L E N G E
P O S S I B L E  I M P L I C A T I O N S
Many IoT devices, such as sensors, are 
intended to be deployed on a much greater 
scale than traditional Internet-connected 
devices, creating a vast quantity of 
interconnected links that can be exploited.
Existing tools, methods, and strategies need to be 
developed to deal with this unprecedented scale.
Many instances of IoT consist of collections 
of identical devices that all have the same 
characteristics.
Magnifies the potential impact of a security 
vulnerability.
Many IoT devices are anticipated to have a 
much longer service life than typical 
equipment.
Devices may “outlive” manufacturer, leaving them 
without long-term support that creates persistent 
vulnerabilities.
Many IoT devices are intentionally designed 
without the ability to be upgraded, or the 
upgrade process is difficult.
Raises the possibility that vulnerable devices 
cannot or will not be fixed, leaving them 
perpetually vulnerable.
Many IoT devices do not provide the user 
with visibility into the workings of the device 
or the data being produced, nor alert the 
user when a security problem arises.
Users may believe an IoT device is functioning as 
intended when in fact, it may be performing in a 
malicious manner.
Some IoT devices, such as sensors, are 
unobtrusively embedded in the environment 
such that a user may not even be aware of 
the device.
Security breach might persist for a long time 
before being noticed.

Society (ISOC), a consortium of corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit 
organizations that monitors Internet policies and practices (Internet Society, 2015). 
Already, alarming reports of hacked IoT devices are starting to pop up in the 
popular press. For example, in July 2015, researchers demonstrated the ability to 
hack into a Jeep Cherokee through its entertainment system, sending commands to 
the dashboard, steering, brakes, and transmission system from a remote laptop that 
turned the steering wheel, disabled the brakes, and shut down the engine (Greenberg, 
2015). Fiat Chrysler Automobiles immediately issued a recall notice to fix the soft-
ware vulnerability involved, but it is almost certain that such incidents will continue 
to occur, as auto manufacturers add more and more wireless “connected car” features 
to automobiles. Other reports have surfaced of wireless baby monitors being hacked, 
as well as medical devices such as hospital lab blood gas analyzers, radiology picture 
archive and communication systems, drug infusion pumps, and hospital x-ray systems 
(Storm, 2015a, 2015b).

TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
At first glance, it might seem like there is not much that can be done about the 
onslaught of security breaches on the Internet. Reviewing the security threats in the 
previous section, it is clear that the threats to e-commerce are very real, potentially 
devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire nations, and likely to be increasing 
in intensity along with the growth in e-commerce. But in fact a great deal of progress 
has been made by private security firms, corporate and home users, network admin-
istrators, technology firms, and government agencies. There are two lines of defense: 
technology solutions and policy solutions. In this section, we consider some technol-
ogy solutions, and in the following section, we look at some policy solutions that work.
The first line of defense against the wide variety of security threats to an e-com-
merce site is a set of tools that can make it difficult for outsiders to invade or destroy 
a site. Figure 4.5 illustrates the major tools available to achieve site security.
PROTECTING INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS
Because e-commerce transactions must flow over the public Internet, and therefore 
involve thousands of routers and servers through which the transaction packets flow, 
security experts believe the greatest security threats occur at the level of Internet 
communications. This is very different from a private network where a dedicated 
communication line is established between two parties. A number of tools are avail-
able to protect the security of Internet communications, the most basic of which is 
message encryption.
ENCRYPTION
Encryption is the process of transforming plain text or data into cipher text that 
cannot be read by anyone other than the sender and the receiver. The purpose of 
encryption

plain text or data into 
cipher text that cannot be 
read by anyone other than

encryption is (a) to secure stored information and (b) to secure information transmis-
sion. Encryption can provide four of the six key dimensions of e-commerce security 
referred to in Table 4.3 on page 246:
•	 Message integrity—provides assurance that the message has not been altered.
•	 Nonrepudiation—prevents the user from denying he or she sent the message.
•	 Authentication—provides verification of the identity of the person (or computer) 
sending the message.
•	 Confidentiality—gives assurance that the message was not read by others.
This transformation of plain text to cipher text is accomplished by using a key or 
cipher. A key (or cipher) is any method for transforming plain text to cipher text.
Encryption has been practiced since the earliest forms of writing and commercial 
transactions. Ancient Egyptian and Phoenician commercial records were encrypted 
using substitution and transposition ciphers. In a substitution cipher, every occur-
rence of a given letter is replaced systematically by another letter. For instance, if we 
used the cipher “letter plus two”—meaning replace every letter in a word with a new 
letter two places forward—then the word “Hello” in plain text would be transformed 
into the following cipher text: “JGNNQ.” In a transposition cipher, the ordering of 
the letters in each word is changed in some systematic way. Leonardo Da Vinci 
recorded his shop notes in reverse order, making them readable only with a mirror. 
The word “Hello” can be written backwards as “OLLEH.” A more complicated cipher

would (a) break all words into two words and (b) spell the first word with every other 
letter beginning with the first letter, and then spell the second word with all the 
remaining letters. In this cipher, “HELLO” would be written as “HLO EL.”
Symmetric Key Cryptography
In order to decipher (decrypt) these messages, the receiver would have to know the 
secret cipher that was used to encrypt the plain text. This is called symmetric key 
cryptography or secret key cryptography. In symmetric key cryptography, both 
the sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message. 
How do the sender and the receiver have the same key? They have to send it over 
some communication media or exchange the key in person. Symmetric key cryptog-
raphy was used extensively throughout World War II and is still a part of Internet 
cryptography.
The possibilities for simple substitution and transposition ciphers are endless, but 
they all suffer from common flaws. First, in the digital age, computers are so power-
ful and fast that these ancient means of encryption can be broken quickly. Second, 
symmetric key cryptography requires that both parties share the same key. In order 
to share the same key, they must send the key over a presumably insecure medium 
where it could be stolen and used to decipher messages. If the secret key is lost or 
stolen, the entire encryption system fails. Third, in commercial use, where we are not 
all part of the same team, you would need a secret key for each of the parties with 
whom you transacted, that is, one key for the bank, another for the department store, 
and another for the government. In a large population of users, this could result in as 
many as n(n–1) keys. In a population of billions of Internet users, billions of keys would 
be needed to accommodate all e-commerce customers. Clearly this situation would be 
too unwieldy to work in practice.
Modern encryption systems are digital. The ciphers or keys used to transform 
plain text into cipher text are digital strings. Computers store text or other data as 
binary strings composed of 0s and 1s. For instance, the binary representation of the 
capital letter “A” in ASCII computer code is accomplished with eight binary digits (bits): 
01000001. One way in which digital strings can be transformed into cipher text is by 
multiplying each letter by another binary number, say, an eight-bit key number 0101 
0101. If we multiplied every digital character in our text messages by this eight-bit key 
and sent the encrypted message to a friend along with the secret eight-bit key, the 
friend could decode the message easily.
The strength of modern security protection is measured in terms of the length of 
the binary key used to encrypt the data. In the preceding example, the eight-bit key is 
easily deciphered because there are only 28 or 256 possibilities. If the intruder knows 
you are using an eight-bit key, then he or she could decode the message in a few 
seconds using a modern desktop PC just by using the brute force method of checking 
each of the 256 possible keys. For this reason, modern digital encryption systems use 
keys with 56, 128, 256, or 512 binary digits. With encryption keys of 512 digits, there 
are 2512 possibilities to check out. It is estimated that all the computers in the world 
would need to work for 10 years before stumbling upon the answer.

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was developed by the National Security 
Agency (NSA) and IBM in the 1950s. DES uses a 56-bit encryption key. To cope with 
much faster computers, it has been improved by the Triple DES Encryption Algorithm 
(TDEA)—essentially encrypting the message three times, each with a separate key. 
Today, the most widely used symmetric key algorithm is Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES), which offers key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. AES had been 
considered to be relatively secure, but in 2011, researchers from Microsoft and a 
Belgian university announced that they had discovered a way to break the algorithm, 
and with this work, the “safety margin” of AES continues to erode. There are also 
many other symmetric key systems that are currently less widely used, with keys 
up to 2,048 bits.1 
Public Key Cryptography
In 1976, a new way of encrypting messages called public key cryptography was 
invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Public key cryptography (also 
referred to as asymmetric cryptography) solves the problem of exchanging keys. In this 
method, two mathematically related digital keys are used: a public key and a private 
key. The private key is kept secret by the owner, and the public key is widely dis-
seminated. Both keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. However, once 
the keys are used to encrypt a message, the same key cannot be used to unencrypt 
the message. The mathematical algorithms used to produce the keys are one-way 
functions. A one-way irreversible mathematical function is one in which, once the algo-
rithm is applied, the input cannot be subsequently derived from the output. Most food 
recipes are like this. For instance, it is easy to make scrambled eggs, but impossible to 
retrieve whole eggs from the scrambled eggs. Public key cryptography is based on the 
idea of irreversible mathematical functions. The keys are sufficiently long (128, 256, 
and 512 bits) that it would take enormous computing power to derive one key from 
the other using the largest and fastest computers available. Figure 4.6 illustrates a 
simple use of public key cryptography and takes you through the important steps in 
using public and private keys.
Public Key Cryptography Using Digital Signatures and Hash Digests
In public key cryptography, some elements of security are missing. Although we 
can be quite sure the message was not understood or read by a third party (message 
confidentiality), there is no guarantee the sender really is the sender; that is, there 
is no authentication of the sender. This means the sender could deny ever sending 
the message (repudiation). And there is no assurance the message was not altered 
somehow in transit. For example, the message “Buy Cisco @ $16” could have been 
accidentally or intentionally altered to read “Sell Cisco @ $16.” This suggests a poten-
tial lack of integrity in the system.

described later in this chapter, which uses 128-bit keys.

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY—A SIMPLE CASE
In the simplest use of public key cryptography, the sender encrypts a message using the recipient’s public 
key, and then sends it over the Internet. The only person who can decrypt this message is the recipient, 
using his or her private key. However, this simple case does not ensure integrity or an authentic message.
S T E P
D E S C R I P T I O N
1.  The sender creates a digital 
message.
The message could be a document, spreadsheet, or any 
digital object.
2.  The sender obtains the recipient’s 
public key from a public directory 
and applies it to the message.
Public keys are distributed widely and can be obtained 
from recipients directly.
3.  Application of the recipient’s key 
produces an encrypted cipher text 
message.
Once encrypted using the public key, the message cannot 
be reverse-engineered or unencrypted using the same 
public key. The process is irreversible.
4.  The encrypted message is sent over 
the Internet.
The encrypted message is broken into packets and sent 
through several different pathways, making interception 
of the entire message difficult (but not impossible).
5.  The recipient uses his/her private 
key to decrypt the message.
The only person who can decrypt the message is the 
person who has possession of the recipient’s private key. 
Hopefully, this is the legitimate recipient.
A more sophisticated use of public key cryptography can achieve authentication, 
nonrepudiation, and integrity. Figure 4.7 illustrates this more powerful approach.
To check the integrity of a message and ensure it has not been altered in transit, 
a hash function is used first to create a digest of the message. A hash function is an 
algorithm that produces a fixed-length number called a hash or message digest. A hash 
function can be simple, and count the number of digital 1s in a message, or it can be 
more complex, and produce a 128-bit number that reflects the number of 0s and 1s, 
the number of 00s and 11s, and so on. Standard hash functions are available (MD4 and

1. The sender creates an original message.
The message can be any digital file.
2.  The sender applies a hash function, producing a 128-bit 
hash result.
Hash functions create a unique digest of the message based on 
the message contents.
3.  The sender encrypts the message and hash result using the 
recipient’s public key.
This irreversible process creates a cipher text that can be read 
only by the recipient using his or her private key.
4.  The sender encrypts the result, again using his or her private 
key.
The sender’s private key is a digital signature. There is only one 
person who can create this digital mark.
5.  The result of this double encryption is sent over the Internet.
The message traverses the Internet as a series of independent 
packets.
6.  The receiver uses the sender’s public key to authenticate the 
message.
Only one person can send this message, namely, the sender.
7.  The receiver uses his or her private key to decrypt the hash 
function and the original message. The receiver checks to 
ensure the original message and the hash function results 
conform to one another.
The hash function is used here to check the original message. 
This ensures the message was not changed in transit.
A more realistic use of public key cryptography uses hash functions and digital signatures to both ensure the confidentiality of the message 
and authenticate the sender. The only person who could have sent the above message is the owner or the sender using his/her private key. 
This authenticates the message. The hash function ensures the message was not altered in transit. As before, the only person who can 
decipher the message is the recipient, using his/her private key.

MD5 produce 128- and 160-bit hashes) (Stein, 1998). These more complex hash func-
tions produce hashes or hash results that are unique to every message. The results of 
applying the hash function are sent by the sender to the recipient. Upon receipt, the 
recipient applies the hash function to the received message and checks to verify the 
same result is produced. If so, the message has not been altered. The sender then 
encrypts both the hash result and the original message using the recipient’s public 
key (as in Figure 4.6 on page 275), producing a single block of cipher text.
One more step is required. To ensure the authenticity of the message and to 
ensure nonrepudiation, the sender encrypts the entire block of cipher text one more 
time using the sender’s private key. This produces a digital signature (also called an 
e-signature) or “signed” cipher text that can be sent over the Internet.
A digital signature is a close parallel to a handwritten signature. Like a handwrit-
ten signature, a digital signature is unique—only one person presumably possesses 
the private key. When used with a hash function, the digital signature is even more 
unique than a handwritten signature. In addition to being exclusive to a particular 
individual, when used to sign a hashed document, the digital signature is also unique 
to the document, and changes for every document.
The recipient of this signed cipher text first uses the sender’s public key to authen-
ticate the message. Once authenticated, the recipient uses his or her private key to 
obtain the hash result and original message. As a final step, the recipient applies the 
same hash function to the original text, and compares the result with the result sent 
by the sender. If the results are the same, the recipient now knows the message has 
not been changed during transmission. The message has integrity.
Early digital signature programs required the user to have a digital certificate, and 
were far too difficult for an individual to use. Newer programs are Internet-based and 
do not require users to install software, or understand digital certificate technology. 
DocuSign, Adobe eSign, and Sertifi are among a number of companies offering online 
digital signature solutions. Many insurance, finance, and surety companies now permit 
customers to electronically sign documents.
Digital Envelopes
Public key cryptography is computationally slow. If one used 128- or 256-bit keys to 
encode large documents—such as this chapter or the entire book—significant declines 
in transmission speeds and increases in processing time would occur. Symmetric key 
cryptography is computationally faster, but as we pointed out previously, it has a weak-
ness—namely, the symmetric key must be sent to the recipient over insecure transmis-
sion lines. One solution is to use the more efficient symmetric encryption and 
decryption for large documents, but public key cryptography to encrypt and send the 
symmetric key. This technique is called using a digital envelope. See Figure 4.8 for 
an illustration of how a digital envelope works.
In Figure 4.8, a diplomatic document is encrypted using a symmetric key. The 
symmetric key—which the recipient will require to decrypt the document—is itself 
encrypted, using the recipient’s public key. So we have a “key within a key” (a digital 
envelope). The encrypted report and the digital envelope are sent across the Web.

The recipient first uses his/her private key to decrypt the symmetric key, and then 
the recipient uses the symmetric key to decrypt the report. This method saves time 
because both encryption and decryption are faster with symmetric keys.
Digital Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
There are still some deficiencies in the message security regime described previ-
ously. How do we know that people and institutions are who they claim to be? 
Anyone can make up a private and public key combination and claim to be someone 
they are not. Before you place an order with an online merchant such as Amazon, 
you want to be sure it really is Amazon you have on the screen and not a spoofer 
masquerading as Amazon. In the physical world, if someone asks who you are and 
you show a social security number, they may well ask to see a picture ID or a second 
form of certifiable or acceptable identification. If they really doubt who you are, 
they may ask for references to other authorities and actually interview these other 
authorities. Similarly, in the digital world, we need a way to know who people and 
institutions really are.

Digital certificates, and the supporting public key infrastructure, are an attempt 
to solve this problem of digital identity. A digital certificate is a digital document 
issued by a trusted third-party institution known as a certification authority (CA) 
that contains the name of the subject or company, the subject’s public key, a digital 
certificate serial number, an expiration date, an issuance date, the digital signature of 
the certification authority (the name of the CA encrypted using the CA’s private key), 
and other identifying information (see Figure 4.9).
Worldwide, thousands of organizations issue CAs. GlobalSign was the first certifi-
cation authority created in Europe. EU member states and other European nations 
maintain lists of approved CAs. A hierarchy of CAs has emerged with less-well-known 
CAs being certified by larger and better-known CAs, creating a community of mutu-
ally verifying institutions. Public key infrastructure (PKI) refers to the CAs and 
digital certificate procedures that are accepted by all parties. When you sign into a 
“secure” site, the URL will begin with “https” and a closed lock icon will appear on 
your browser. This means the site has a digital certificate issued by a trusted CA. It is 
not, presumably, a spoof site.
To create a digital certificate, the user generates a public/private key pair and 
sends a request for certification to a CA along with the user’s public key. The CA veri-
fies the information (how this is accomplished differs from CA to CA). The CA issues

DIGITAL CERTIFICATES AND CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES
The PKI includes certification authorities that issue, verify, and guarantee digital certificates that are used in 
e-commerce to assure the identity of transaction partners.

a certificate containing the user’s public key and other related information. Finally, 
the CA creates a message digest from the certificate itself (just like a hash digest) and 
signs it with the CA’s private key. This signed digest is called the signed certificate. We 
end up with a totally unique cipher text document—there can be only one signed 
certificate like this in the world.
There are several ways the certificates are used in commerce. Before initiating a 
transaction, the customer can request the signed digital certificate of the merchant and 
decrypt it using the merchant’s public key to obtain both the message digest and the 
certificate as issued. If the message digest matches the certificate, then the merchant 
and the public key are authenticated. The merchant may in return request certifica-
tion of the user, in which case the user would send the merchant his or her individual 
certificate. There are many types of certificates: personal, institutional, Web server, 
software publisher, and CAs themselves.
PKI and CAs can also be used to secure software code and content for applications 
that are directly downloaded to mobile devices from the Internet. Using a technique 
referred to as code signing, mobile application developers use their private key to 
encrypt a digital signature. When end users decrypt the signature with the correspond-
ing public key, it confirms the developer’s identity and the integrity of the code. 
You can easily obtain a public and private key for personal, noncommercial use 
at the International PGP Home Page Web site, Pgpi.org. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) 
was invented in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, and has become one of the most widely 
used e-mail public key encryption software tools in the world. Using PGP software 
installed on your computer, you can compress and encrypt your messages as well as 
authenticate both yourself and the recipient. There are also a number of Firefox, 
Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari add-ons, extensions, or plug-ins that enable you 
to encrypt your e-mail. 
Limitations of PKI
PKI is a powerful technological solution to security issues, but it has many limitations, 
especially concerning CAs. PKI applies mainly to protecting messages in transit on 
the Internet and is not effective against insiders—employees—who have legitimate 
access to corporate systems including customer information. Most e-commerce sites 
do not store customer information in encrypted form. Other limitations are apparent. 
For one, how is your private key to be protected? Most private keys will be stored on 
insecure desktop or laptop computers.
There is no guarantee the person using your computer—and your private key—is 
really you. For instance, you may lose your laptop or smartphone, and therefore lose 
the private key. Likewise, there is no assurance that someone else in the world cannot 
use your personal ID papers, such as a social security card, to obtain a PKI authen-
ticated online ID in your name. If there’s no real world identification system, there 
can be no Internet identification system. Under many digital signature laws, you are 
responsible for whatever your private key does even if you were not the person using 
the key. This is very different from mail-order or telephone order credit card rules, 
where you have a right to dispute the credit card charge. Second, there is no guar-

antee the verifying computer of the merchant is secure. Third, CAs are self-selected 
organizations seeking to gain access to the business of authorization. They may not 
be authorities on the corporations or individuals they certify. For instance, how can a 
CA know about all the corporations within an industry to determine who is or is not 
legitimate? A related question concerns the method used by the CA to identify the 
certificate holder. Was this an e-mail transaction verified only by claims of the appli-
cants who filled out an online form? For instance, VeriSign acknowledged in one case 
that it had mistakenly issued two digital certificates to someone fraudulently claim-
ing to represent Microsoft. Digital certificates have been hijacked by hackers, tricking 
consumers into giving up personal information. For example, in 2014, India’s National 
Informatics Centre, an intermediate CA that was trusted by the Indian Controller of 
Certifying Authorities, whose certificates are included in the Microsoft Root Store and 
thus trusted by the vast majority of programs running on Windows, including Internet 
Explorer and Chrome, was hacked and a number of unauthorized digital certificates 
were issued for domains operated by Google and Yahoo (Datta, 2014). Last, what are 
the policies for revoking or renewing certificates? The expected life of a digital cer-
tificate or private key is a function of the frequency of use and the vulnerability of 
systems that use the certificate. Yet most CAs have no policy or just an annual policy 
for reissuing certificates. If Microsoft, Apple, or Cisco ever rescinded a number of 
CAs, millions of users would not be able to access sites. The CA system is difficult 
and costly to police.
SECURING CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION
The concepts of public key cryptography are used routinely for securing channels of 
communication.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
The most common form of securing channels is through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. When you receive a message from a server 
on the Web with which you will be communicating through a secure channel, this 
means you will be using SSL/TLS to establish a secure negotiated session. (Notice that 
the URL changes from HTTP to HTTPS.) A secure negotiated session is a client-
server session in which the URL of the requested document, along with the contents, 
contents of forms, and the cookies exchanged, are encrypted (see Figure 4.10). For 
instance, your credit card number that you entered into a form would be encrypted. 
Through a series of handshakes and communications, the browser and the server 
establish one another’s identity by exchanging digital certificates, decide on the stron-
gest shared form of encryption, and then proceed to communicate using an agreed-
upon session key. A session key is a unique symmetric encryption key chosen just 
for this single secure session. Once used, it is gone forever. Figure 4.10 shows how this 
works.
In practice, most private individuals do not have a digital certificate. In this case, 
the merchant server will not request a certificate, but the client browser will request 
the merchant certificate once a secure session is called for by the server.

SSL/TLS provides data encryption, server authentication, optional client authen-
tication, and message integrity for TCP/IP connections. SSL/TLS addresses the issue 
of authenticity by allowing users to verify another user’s identity or the identity of a 
server. It also protects the integrity of the messages exchanged. However, once the 
merchant receives the encrypted credit and order information, that information is typi-
cally stored in unencrypted format on the merchant’s servers. While SSL/TLS provides 
secure transactions between merchant and consumer, it only guarantees server-side 
authentication. Client authentication is optional.
In addition, SSL/TLS cannot provide irrefutability—consumers can order goods 
or download information products, and then claim the transaction never occurred. 
Recently, social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter have begun to use SSL/
TLS for a variety of reasons, including the ability to thwart account hijacking using 
Firesheep over wireless networks. Firesheep, an add-on for Firefox, can be used by 
hackers to grab unencrypted cookies used to “remember” a user and allow the hacker 
to immediately log on to a Web site as that user. SSL/TLS can thwart such an attack 
because it encrypts the cookie. In June 2015, the White House’s Office of Management 
and Budget issued a memorandum requiring that all publicly accessible federal Web 
sites and Web services use HTTPS by December 31, 2016.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
A virtual private network (VPN) allows remote users to securely access a corpora-
tion’s local area network via the Internet, using a variety of VPN protocols. VPNs use 
both authentication and encryption to secure information from unauthorized persons 
(providing confidentiality and integrity). Authentication prevents spoofing and mis-
representation of identities. A remote user can connect to a remote private local 
network using a local ISP. The VPN protocols will establish the link from the client to 
the corporate network as if the user had dialed into the corporate network directly. 
The process of connecting one protocol through another (IP) is called tunneling, 
because the VPN creates a private connection by adding an invisible wrapper around 
a message to hide its content. As the message travels through the Internet between 
the ISP and the corporate network, it is shielded from prying eyes by an encrypted 
wrapper.
A VPN is “virtual” in the sense that it appears to users as a dedicated secure line 
when in fact it is a temporary secure line. The primary use of VPNs is to establish 
secure communications among business partners—larger suppliers or customers, and 
employees working remotely. A dedicated connection to a business partner can be 
very expensive. Using the Internet and VPN as the connection method significantly 
reduces the cost of secure communications.
Wireless (Wi-Fi) Networks 
Accessing the Internet via a wireless (Wi-Fi) network has its own particular security 
issues. Early Wi-Fi networks used a security standard called Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) to encrypt information. WEP was very weak, and easy for hackers to crack. A 
new standard, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), was developed that provided a higher 
standard of protection, but this too soon became vulnerable to intrusion. Today, the 
current standard is WPA2, which uses the AES algorithm for encryption and CCMP, 
a more advanced authentication code protocol.
PROTECTING NETWORKS
Once you have protected communications as well as possible, the next set of tools to 
consider are those that can protect your networks, as well as the servers and clients 
on those networks.
Firewalls
Firewalls and proxy servers are intended to build a wall around your network and the 
attached servers and clients, just like physical-world firewalls protect you from fires 
for a limited period of time. Firewalls and proxy servers share some similar functions, 
but they are quite different.
A firewall refers to either hardware or software that filters communication packets 
and prevents some packets from entering or exiting the network based on a security 
policy. The firewall controls traffic to and from servers and clients, forbidding com-
munications from untrustworthy sources, and allowing other communications from 
trusted sources to proceed. Every message that is to be sent or received from the 
virtual private 
network (VPN)
allows remote users to 
securely access internal 
networks via the Internet, 
using the Point-to-Point 
Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)

network is processed by the firewall, which determines if the message meets security 
guidelines established by the business. If it does, it is permitted to be distributed, and 
if it doesn’t, the message is blocked. Firewalls can filter traffic based on packet attri-
butes such as source IP address, destination port or IP address, type of service (such 
as WWW or HTTP), the domain name of the source, and many other dimensions. Most 
hardware firewalls that protect local area networks connected to the Internet have 
default settings that require little if any administrator intervention and employ simple 
but effective rules that deny incoming packets from a connection that does not origi-
nate from an internal request—the firewall only allows connections from servers that 
you requested service from. A common default setting on hardware firewalls (DSL 
and cable modem routers) simply ignores efforts to communicate with TCP port 445, 
the most commonly attacked port. The increasing use of firewalls by home and busi-
ness Internet users has greatly reduced the effectiveness of attacks, and forced hackers 
to focus more on e-mail attachments to distribute worms and viruses.
There are two major methods firewalls use to validate traffic: packet filters and 
application gateways. Packet filters examine data packets to determine whether they are 
destined for a prohibited port or originate from a prohibited IP address (as specified 
by the security administrator). The filter specifically looks at the source and destina-
tion information, as well as the port and packet type, when determining whether the 
information may be transmitted. One downside of the packet filtering method is that 
it is susceptible to spoofing, because authentication is not one of its roles.
Application gateways are a type of firewall that filters communications based on 
the application being requested, rather than the source or destination of the message. 
Such firewalls also process requests at the application level, farther away from the 
client computer than packet filters. By providing a central filtering point, application 
gateways provide greater security than packet filters but can compromise system 
performance.
Next-generation firewalls use an application-centric approach to firewall control. 
They are able to identify applications regardless of the port, protocol, or security 
evasion tools used; identify users regardless of device or IP address; decrypt outbound 
SSL; and protect in real-time against threats embedded in applications.
Proxy Servers
Proxy servers (proxies) are software servers (often a dedicated computer) that 
handle all communications originating from or being sent to the Internet by local 
clients, acting as a spokesperson or bodyguard for the organization. Proxies act primar-
ily to limit access of internal clients to external Internet servers, although some proxy 
servers act as firewalls as well. Proxy servers are sometimes called dual-home systems 
because they have two network interfaces. To internal computers, a proxy server is 
known as the gateway, while to external computers it is known as a mail server or 
numeric address.
When a user on an internal network requests a Web page, the request is routed 
first to the proxy server. The proxy server validates the user and the nature of the 
request, and then sends the request onto the Internet. A Web page sent by an exter-
nal Internet server first passes to the proxy server. If acceptable, the Web page passes

onto the internal network Web server and then to the client desktop. By prohibiting 
users from communicating directly with the Internet, companies can restrict access 
to certain types of sites, such as pornographic, auction, or stock-trading sites. Proxy 
servers also improve Web performance by storing frequently requested Web pages 
locally, reducing upload times, and hiding the internal network’s address, thus making 
it more difficult for hackers to monitor. Figure 4.11 illustrates how firewalls and proxy 
servers protect a local area network from Internet intruders and prevent internal 
clients from reaching prohibited Web servers.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
In addition to a firewall and proxy server, an intrusion detection and/or prevention 
system can be installed. An intrusion detection system (IDS) examines network 
traffic, watching to see if it matches certain patterns or preconfigured rules indicative 
of an attack. If it detects suspicious activity, the IDS will set off an alarm alerting 
administrators and log the event in a database. An IDS is useful for detecting malicious 
activity that a firewall might miss. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) has all 
the functionality of an IDS, with the additional ability to take steps to prevent and 
block suspicious activities. For instance, an IPS can terminate a session and reset a 
connection, block traffic from a suspicious IP address, or reconfigure firewall or router 
security controls.

PROTECTING SERVERS AND CLIENTS
Operating system features and anti-virus software can help further protect servers and 
clients from certain types of attacks.
Operating System Security Enhancements
The most obvious way to protect servers and clients is to take advantage of automatic 
computer security upgrades. The Microsoft, Apple, and Linux/Unix operating systems 
are continuously updated to patch vulnerabilities discovered by hackers. These patches 
are autonomic; that is, when using these operating systems on the Internet, you are 
prompted and informed that operating system enhancements are available. Users can 
easily download these security patches for free. The most common known worms 
and viruses can be prevented by simply keeping your server and client operating 
systems and applications up to date. In April 2014, Microsoft ended security support 
and updates for its Windows XP operating system. Despite this, many organizations 
continue to use XP-based systems, and as a result, many security experts anticipate a 
wave of strikes against such systems. Application vulnerabilities are fixed in the same 
manner. For instance, most popular Internet browsers are updated automatically with 
little user intervention.
Anti-Virus Software
The easiest and least-expensive way to prevent threats to system integrity is to install 
anti-virus software. Programs by McAfee, Symantec (Norton AntiVirus), and many 
others provide inexpensive tools to identify and eradicate the most common types of 
malicious code as they enter a computer, as well as destroy those already lurking on a 
hard drive. Anti-virus programs can be set up so that e-mail attachments are inspected 
before you click on them, and the attachments are eliminated if they contain a known 
virus or worm. It is not enough, however, to simply install the software once. Because 
new viruses are developed and released every day, daily routine updates are needed 
in order to prevent new threats from being loaded. Some premium-level anti-virus 
software is updated hourly.
Anti-virus suite packages and stand-alone programs are available to eliminate 
intruders such as bot programs, adware, and other security risks. Such programs work 
much like anti-virus software in that they look for recognized hacker tools or signature 
actions of known intruders.

MANAGEMENT POLICIES, BUSINESS PROCEDURES, 
AND PUBLIC LAWS
Worldwide, in 2015, companies are expected to spend over €69 billion on security hard-
ware, software, and services (Gartner, 2015). However, most CEOs and CIOs believe 
that technology is not the sole answer to managing the risk of e-commerce. The tech-
nology provides a foundation, but in the absence of intelligent management policies, 
even the best technology can be easily defeated. Public laws and active enforcement 

of cybercrime statutes also are required to both raise the costs of illegal behavior on 
the Internet and guard against corporate abuse of information. Let’s consider briefly 
the development of management policy.
A SECURITY PLAN: MANAGEMENT POLICIES
In order to minimize security threats, e-commerce firms must develop a coherent 
corporate policy that takes into account the nature of the risks, the information assets 
that need protecting, and the procedures and technologies required to address the risk, 
as well as implementation and auditing mechanisms. Figure 4.12 illustrates the key 
steps in developing a solid security plan.
A security plan begins with risk assessment—an assessment of the risks and 
points of vulnerability. The first step is to inventory the information and knowledge 
assets of the e-commerce site and company. What information is at risk? Is it customer 
information, proprietary designs, business activities, secret processes, or other inter-
nal information, such as price schedules, executive compensation, or payroll? For each 
type of information asset, try to estimate the dollar value to the firm if this informa-
tion were compromised, and then multiply that amount by the probability of the loss 
occurring. Once you have done so, rank order the results. You now have a list of infor-
mation assets prioritized by their value to the firm.
Based on your quantified list of risks, you can start to develop a security policy—
a set of statements prioritizing the information risks, identifying acceptable risk

DEVELOPING AN E-COMMERCE SECURITY PLAN
There are five steps involved in building an e-commerce security plan.

targets, and identifying the mechanisms for achieving these targets. You will obviously 
want to start with the information assets that you determined to be the highest prior-
ity in your risk assessment. Who generates and controls this information in the firm? 
What existing security policies are in place to protect the information? What enhance-
ments can you recommend to improve security of these most valuable assets? What 
level of risk are you willing to accept for each of these assets? Are you willing, for 
instance, to lose customer credit card data once every 10 years? Or will you pursue a 
100-year hurricane strategy by building a security edifice for credit card data that can 
withstand the once-in-100-year disaster? You will need to estimate how much it will 
cost to achieve this level of acceptable risk. Remember, total and complete security 
may require extraordinary financial resources. By answering these questions, you will 
have the beginnings of a security policy.
Next, consider an implementation plan—the steps you will take to achieve the 
security plan goals. Specifically, you must determine how you will translate the levels 
of acceptable risk into a set of tools, technologies, policies, and procedures. What new 
technologies will you deploy to achieve the goals, and what new employee procedures 
will be needed?
To implement your plan, you will need an organizational unit in charge of secu-
rity, and a security officer—someone who is in charge of security on a daily basis. For 
a small e-commerce site, the security officer will likely be the person in charge of 
Internet services or the site manager, whereas for larger firms, there typically is a 
dedicated team with a supporting budget. The security organization educates and 
trains users, keeps management aware of security threats and breakdowns, and main-
tains the tools chosen to implement security.
The security organization typically administers access controls, authentication 
procedures, and authorization policies. Access controls determine which outsiders 
and insiders can gain legitimate access to your networks. Outsider access controls 
include firewalls and proxy servers, while insider access controls typically consist of 
login procedures (usernames, passwords, and access codes).
Authentication procedures include the use of digital signatures, certificates of 
authority, and PKI. Now that e-signatures have been given the same legal weight as 
an original pen-and-ink version, companies are in the process of devising ways to test 
and confirm a signer’s identity. Companies frequently have signers type their full 
name and click on a button indicating their understanding that they have just signed 
a contract or document.
Biometric devices can also be used to verify physical attributes associated with 
an individual, such as a fingerprint or retina (eye) scan or speech recognition system. 
(Biometrics is the study of measurable biological, or physical, characteristics.) A 
company could require, for example, that an individual undergo a fingerprint scan 
before being allowed access to a Web site, or before being allowed to pay for merchan-
dise with a credit card. Biometric devices make it even more difficult for hackers to 
break into sites or facilities, significantly reducing the opportunity for spoofing. Secu-
rity tokens are used by millions of corporation and government workers to log on to 
corporate clients and servers. Newer Apple iPhones (5S and later) feature a fingerprint 
sensor called the Touch ID built into the iPhone’s home button to unlock the phone

and authorize purchases from the iTunes, iBooks, and App Stores without requiring 
users to enter a PIN or other security code. According to Apple, the system does not 
store an actual fingerprint, but rather biometric data, which will be encrypted and 
stored only on a chip within the iPhone, and will not be made available to third parties.
Security tokens are physical devices or software that generate an identifier that 
can be used in addition to or in place of a password. One example is RSA’s SecurID 
token, which continously generates six-digit passwords.
Authorization policies determine differing levels of access to information assets 
for differing levels of users. Authorization management systems establish where 
and when a user is permitted to access certain parts of a Web site. Their primary func-
tion is to restrict access to private information within a company’s Internet infrastruc-
ture. Although there are several authorization management products currently 
available, most operate in the same way: the system encrypts a user session to function 
like a passkey that follows the user from page to page, allowing access only to those 
areas that the user is permitted to enter, based on information set at the system data-
base. By establishing entry rules up front for each user, the authorization management 
system knows who is permitted to go where at all times.
The last step in developing an e-commerce security plan is performing a security 
audit. A security audit involves the routine review of access logs (identifying how 
outsiders are using the site as well as how insiders are accessing the site’s assets). A 
monthly report should be produced that establishes the routine and nonroutine 
accesses to the systems and identifies unusual patterns of activities. As previously 
noted, tiger teams are often used by large corporate sites to evaluate the strength of 
existing security procedures. Many small firms have sprung up in the last five years 
to provide these services to large corporate sites.
THE ROLE OF LAWS AND PUBLIC POLICY
The public policy environment today is very different from the early days of e-com-
merce. The net result is that the Internet is no longer an ungoverned, unsupervised, 
self-controlled technology juggernaut. Just as with financial markets in the last 70 years, 
there is a growing awareness that e-commerce markets work only when a powerful 
institutional set of laws and enforcement mechanisms are in place. These laws help 
ensure orderly, rational, and fair markets. This growing public policy environment is 
becoming just as global as e-commerce itself. Despite some spectacular internation-
ally based attacks on U.S. e-commerce sites, the sources and persons involved in major 
harmful attacks have almost always been uncovered and, where possible, prosecuted.
Voluntary and private efforts have played a very large role in identifying criminal 
hackers and assisting law enforcement. Since 1995, as e-commerce has grown in sig-
nificance, national and local law enforcement activities have expanded greatly. New 
laws have been passed that grant local and national authorities new tools and mecha-
nisms for identifying, tracing, and prosecuting cybercriminals. For instance, a major-
ity of states now require companies that maintain personal data on their residents 
to publicly disclose when a security breach affecting those residents has occurred.

lation. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has asserted that it has authority

over corporations’ data security practices. The FTC sued the Wyndham hotel chain 
after hacking attacks in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a data breach that led to fraudu-
lent credit charges of more than $10 million. According to the FTC, its investigation 
showed that Wyndham had failed to follow basic data security practices, while at the 
same time assuring customers that their data was safe. In August 2015, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the FTC was within the scope of its author-
ity, opening the door for it to take a greater role, especially in light of the failure of 
Congress to adopt legislation governing data security. By increasing the punishment 
for cybercrimes, the U.S. government is attempting to create a deterrent to further 
hacker actions. And by making such actions federal crimes, the government is able to 
extradite international hackers and prosecute them within the United States.
After September 11, 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which broadly 
expanded law enforcement’s investigative and surveillance powers. The act has pro-
visions for monitoring e-mail and Internet use. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 
also attempts to fight cyberterrorism and increases the government’s ability to compel 
information disclosure by computer and ISP sources. Recent proposed legislation 
that focuses on requiring firms to report data breaches to the FTC, protection of the 
national electric grid, and cybersecurity has all failed to pass. However, in October 
2015, the U.S. Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA). The 
bill, which is intended to create a system that lets companies share evidence about 
attacks without the risk of being sued, has been opposed by many large technology 
companies and privacy advocates on the grounds that it does not do enough to protect 
individual privacy and could lead to increased government surveillance. Before becom-
ing law, the bill must be reconciled with the version passed by the House of Represen-
tatives in April 2015, and then signed by the President (Peterson, 2015).
Private and Private-Public Cooperation Efforts
The good news is that e-commerce sites are not alone in their battle to achieve secu-
rity on the Internet. Several organizations—some public and some private—are devoted 
to tracking down criminal organizations and individuals engaged in attacks against 
Internet and e-commerce sites. On the federal level, the Office of Cybersecurity and 
Communications (CS&C) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
is responsible for overseeing the security, resilience, and reliability of the United 
States’ cyber and communications infrastructure. The National Cybersecurity and 
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) acts as a 24/7 cyber monitoring, incident 
response, and management center. In addition, the DHS also operates the United 
States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), which coordinates cyber 
incident warnings and responses across both the government and private sectors. One 
of the better-known private organizations is the CERT Coordination Center (formerly 
known as the Computer Emergency Response Team) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
CERT monitors and tracks online criminal activity reported to it by private corpora-
tions and government agencies that seek out its help. CERT is composed of full-time 
and part-time computer experts who can trace the origins of attacks against sites 
despite the complexity of the Internet. Its staff members also assist organizations in 
identifying security problems, developing solutions, and communicating with the

Government Policies and Controls on Encryption Software
In the United States, both Congress and the executive branch have sought to regulate 
the uses of encryption and to restrict availability and export of encryption systems as a 
means of preventing crime and terrorism. At the international level, four organizations 
have influenced the international traffic in encryption software: the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), G-7 (the heads of state of the top seven 
industrialized countries in the world, not including Russia, which was suspended from 
participation in 2014), the European Council, and the Wassenaar Arrangement (which 
includes 41 countries that produce sensitive industrial equipment or weapons). Various 
governments have proposed schemes for controlling encryption software or at least 
preventing criminals from obtaining strong encryption tools (see Table 4.7). The U.S. 
and U.K. governments are also devoting a large amount of resources to cryptography-
related programs that will enable them to break encrypted communications collected 
on the Internet. Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden indicate 
that both the NSA and its U.K. counterpart, the GCHQ, may be able to break encryption 
schemes used by SSL/TLS, VPNs, and on 4G smartphones (Vaughan-Nichols, 2013).

mobile platform, have also created both a need and an opportunity for the develop-
ment of new payment systems. In this section, we provide an overview of the major 
e-commerce payment systems in use today. Table 4.8 lists some of the major trends 
in e-commerce payments in 2015–2016.
Worldwide, online payments by consumers represent a market of almost €2 billion 
in 2015. Institutions and business firms that can handle this volume of transactions 
(mostly the large banking and credit firms) generally extract 2%–3% of the transac-
tions in the form of fees. Given the size of the market, competition for online pay-
ments is spirited.
In the United States, the primary form of online payment is still the existing 
credit and debit card system. Alternative payment methods such as PayPal, Amazon 
Payments, and Bill Me Later are expected to continue to make inroads into traditional 
payment methods. Mobile payments are also expected to grow significantly (Javelin 
Strategy & Research, 2014). Figure 4.13 illustrates the percentage of consumers that 
use various alternative payment methods in 2015.
In other parts of the world, e-commerce payments can be very different depend-
ing on traditions and infrastructure. Credit cards are not nearly as dominant a form 
of online payment as they are in the United States. If you plan on operating an 
e-commerce site in Europe, Asia, or Latin America, you will need to develop different 
payment systems for each region. For instance, in Denmark, Norway, and Finland 
payment is primarily with debit or credit cards, while in Sweden, payment after being 
tendered an invoice and by bank transfer are very popular in addition to credit/debit 
cards. In the Netherlands, the online payments service iDEAL is the most popular 
retail e-commerce payment method. In Italy, consumers rely heavily on both credit 
cards and PayPal. In Japan, although credit card is the primary payment method, 
many consumers still pick up and pay for goods at local convenience stores (konbini) 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2015).

ONLINE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
Because credit and debit cards are the dominant form of online payment, it is impor-
tant to understand how they work and to recognize the strengths and weaknesses 
of this payment system. Online credit card transactions are processed in much the 
same way that in-store purchases are, with the major differences being that online 
merchants never see the actual card being used, no card impression is taken, and 
no signature is available. Online credit card transactions most closely resemble Mail 
Order-Telephone Order (MOTO) transactions. These types of purchases are also called 
Cardholder Not Present (CNP) transactions and are the major reason that charges can 
be disputed later by consumers. Because the merchant never sees the credit card, nor 
receives a hand-signed agreement to pay from the customer, when disputes arise, the 
merchant faces the risk that the transaction may be disallowed and reversed, even 
though he has already shipped the goods or the user has downloaded a digital product.
Figure 4.14 illustrates the online credit card purchasing cycle. There are five 
parties involved in an online credit card purchase: consumer, merchant, clearinghouse, 
merchant bank (sometimes called the “acquiring bank”), and the consumer’s card-
issuing bank. In order to accept payments by credit card, online merchants must have 
a merchant account established with a bank or financial institution. A merchant 
account is simply a bank account that allows companies to process credit card pay-
ments and receive funds from those transactions.

As shown in Figure 4.14, an online credit card transaction begins with a purchase 
(1). When a consumer wants to make a purchase, he or she adds the item to the mer-
chant’s shopping cart. When the consumer wants to pay for the items in the shopping 
cart, a secure tunnel through the Internet is created using SSL/TLS. Using encryption, 
SSL/TLS secures the session during which credit card information will be sent to the 
merchant and protects the information from interlopers on the Internet (2). SSL does 
not authenticate either the merchant or the consumer. The transacting parties have 
to trust one another.
Once the consumer credit card information is received by the merchant, the mer-
chant software contacts a clearinghouse (3). As previously noted, a clearinghouse is a 
financial intermediary that authenticates credit cards and verifies account balances. 
The clearinghouse contacts the issuing bank to verify the account information (4). 
Once verified, the issuing bank credits the account of the merchant at the merchant’s 
bank (usually this occurs at night in a batch process) (5). The debit to the consumer 
account is transmitted to the consumer in a monthly statement (6).
Credit Card E-commerce Enablers
Companies that have a merchant account still need to buy or build a means of han-
dling the online transaction; securing the merchant account is only step one in a 
two-part process. Today, Internet payment service providers (sometimes referred to

as payment gateways) can provide both a merchant account and the software tools 
needed to process credit card purchases online.
For instance, Authorize.net is an Internet payment service provider. The company 
helps a merchant secure an account with one of its merchant account provider part-
ners and then provides payment processing software for installation on the merchant’s 
server. The software collects the transaction information from the merchant’s site 
and then routes it via the Authorize.net “payment gateway” to the appropriate bank, 
ensuring that customers are authorized to make their purchases. The funds for the 
transaction are then transferred to the merchant’s merchant account. CyberSource is 
another well-known Internet payment service provider.
PCI-DSS Compliance
The PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard) is a data security 
standard instituted by the five major credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, Amer-
ican Express, Discover, and JCB). PCI-DSS is not a law or governmental regulation, 
but an industry-mandated standard. Every online merchant must comply with the 
appropriate level of PCI-DSS in order to accept credit card payments. Those that fail 
to comply and are involved in a credit card breach may ultimately be subjected to 
fines and other expenses. PCI-DSS has various levels, related to the number of credit 
and/or debit cards processed by the merchant each year. Level 1, the strictest level, 
applies to very large merchants that process more than 6 million transactions a year, 
while Level 2 applies to those who process between 1 million and 6 million. Level 3 
applies to organizations that process between 20,000 and 1 million transactions, while 
Level 4 applies to smaller merchants that process less than 20,000 transactions. 
PCI-DSS has six major control objectives. It requires the merchant to (a) build and 
maintain a secure network, (b) protect cardholder data, (c) maintain a vulnerability 
management program, (d) implement strong access control measures, (e) regularly 
test and monitor networks, and (f) maintain an information security policy. Each of 
these six broad control objectives has further specific requirements that must be met. 
The most current version of PCI-DSS is Version 3.1, which went into effect as of April 
2015 (PCI Security Standards Council, 2015).
Limitations of Online Credit Card Payment Systems
There are a number of limitations to the existing credit card payment system. The 
most important limitations involve security, merchant risk, administrative and trans-
action costs, and social equity.
The existing system offers poor security. Neither the merchant nor the consumer 
can be fully authenticated. The merchant could be a criminal organization designed 
to collect credit card numbers, and the consumer could be a thief using stolen or 
fraudulent cards. The risk facing merchants is high: consumers can repudiate charges 
even though the goods have been shipped or the product downloaded. The banking 
industry attempted to develop a secure electronic transaction (SET) protocol, but this 
effort failed because it was too complex for consumers and merchants alike.

The administrative costs of setting up an online credit card system and becoming 
authorized to accept credit cards are high. Transaction costs for merchants also are 
significant—roughly 3.5% of the purchase plus a transaction fee of 20–35 cents per 
transaction, plus other setup fees. 
Credit cards are not very democratic, even though they seem ubiquitous. Millions 
of young adults do not have credit cards, along with millions of others who cannot 
afford cards or who are considered poor risks because of low incomes.
ALTERNATIVE ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEMS
The limitations of the online credit card system have opened the way for the develop-
ment of a number of alternative online payment systems. Chief among them is PayPal. 
PayPal (purchased by eBay in 2002 and then spun-off as an independent company 
again in 2015) enables individuals and businesses with e-mail accounts to make and 
receive payments up to a specified limit. Paypal is an example of an online stored 
value payment system, which permits consumers to make instant, online payments 
to merchants and other individuals based on value stored in an online account. PayPal 
has 173 million active customer accounts as of September 2015 and in 2014 processed 
4 billion payments, of which 1 billion were on mobile devices. It operates in 203 coun-
tries around the world. It allows customers to be paid in more than 100 currencies, to 
withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 57 currencies, and to hold balances in their 
PayPal account in 26 currencies. In 2014, PayPal processed $228 billion in payments 
($60 billion of which were generated on eBay, and $168 billion elsewhere). PayPal 
builds on the existing financial infrastructure of the countries in which it operates. 
You establish a PayPal account by specifying a credit, debit, or checking account you 
wish to have charged or paid when conducting online transactions. When you make 
a payment using PayPal, you e-mail the payment to the merchant’s PayPal account. 
PayPal transfers the amount from your credit or checking account to the merchant’s 
bank account. The beauty of PayPal is that no personal credit information has to be 
shared among the users, and the service can be used by individuals to pay one another 
even in small amounts. However, one issue with PayPal is its relatively high cost. For 
example, to send or request money, the cost ranges from 2.9% to 5.99% of the amount 
(depending on the type of transaction) plus a small fixed fee (typically $0.30) per 
transaction. PayPal is discussed in further depth in the case study at the end of the 
chapter.
Although PayPal is by far the most well-known and commonly used online credit/
debit card alternative, there are a number of other alternatives as well. Amazon Pay-
ments is aimed at consumers who have concerns about entrusting their credit card 
information to unfamiliar online retailers. Consumers can purchase goods and ser-
vices at non-Amazon Web sites using the payment methods stored in their Amazon 
accounts, without having to reenter their payment information at the merchant’s site. 
Amazon provides the payment processing. Visa Checkout (formerly V.me) and Mas-
terCard’s MasterPass substitute a user name and password for an actual payment card 
number during online checkout. Both MasterPass and Visa Checkout are supported by 
online stored value 
payment system

instant, online payments to 
merchants and other 
individuals based on value

a number of large payment processors and online retailers. However, they have not 
yet achieved the usage of Paypal.
Bill Me Later (owned by PayPal as well) also appeals to consumers who do not 
wish to enter their credit card information online. Bill Me Later describes itself as 
an open-ended credit account. Users select the Bill Me Later option at checkout and 
are asked to provide their birth date and the last four digits of their social security 
number. They are then billed for the purchase by Bill Me Later within 10 to 14 days. 
Bill Me Later is currently offered by more than 1,000 online merchants. 
WUPay (formerly eBillme, and now operated by Western Union) offers a similar 
service. WUPay customers who select the WUPay option at firms such as Sears, 
Kmart, Buy.com, and other retailers do not have to provide any credit card informa-
tion. Instead they are e-mailed a bill, which they can pay via their bank’s online bill 
payment service, or in person at any Western Union location. Dwolla is a similar 
cash-based payment network for both individuals and merchants. It bypasses the 
credit card network and instead connects directly into a bank account. In 2015, Dwolla 
eliminated its transaction and processing fees, changing its focus from consumer-to-
consumer payments to larger businesses. Dwolla has its own network that bypasses 
the Automated Clearing House (ACH), the traditional system for processing finan-
cial transactions in the United States, and in 2015, signed up major U.S. bank BBVA 
Compass. Earlier in the year, the U.S. Treasury had selected Dwolla (along with PayPal) 
to process payments to federal agencies, and in October 2015, the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange chose Dwolla to replace ACH. Dwolla now processes more than $1 billion 
a year (Patane, 2015; Leising, 2015). 
Like Dwolla, Stripe is another company that is attempting to provide an alterna-
tive to the traditional online credit card system. Stripe focuses on the merchant side 
of the process. It provides simple software code that enables companies to bypass 
much of the administrative costs involved in setting up an online credit card system, 
and instead lets companies begin accepting credit card payments almost immedi-
ately without the need to obtain a merchant account or use a gateway provider. 
Unlike PayPal, the customer doesn’t need a Stripe account to pay, and all payments 
are made directly to the company rather than being routed through a third party.
MOBILE PAYMENT SYSTEMS: YOUR SMARTPHONE WALLET
The use of mobile devices as payment mechanisms is already well established in 
Europe and Asia and is now exploding in the United States, where the infrastructure 
to support mobile payment is finally being put in place. Total U.S. mobile online 
retail payments are expected to grow from $76 billion in 2014 to $217 billion by 2019. 
Physical goods are the most common purchase in mobile online shopping, with over 
50% of mobile buyers reporting that they had purchased such goods (Javelin Strategy 
& Research, 2015c; Hernandez, 2015). Near field communication (NFC) is one of the 
enabling technologies for mobile payment systems. Near field communication 
(NFC) is a set of short-range wireless technologies used to share information among 
devices within about 2 inches of each other (50 mm). NFC devices are either powered

or passive. A connection requires one powered unit (the initiator), and one target 
unpowered unit that can respond to requests from the powered unit. NFC targets 
can be very simple forms such as tags, stickers, key fobs, or readers. NFC peer-to-
peer communication is possible where both devices are powered. An NFC-equipped 
smartphone, for instance, can be swiped by a merchant’s reader to record a payment 
wirelessly and without contact. About 444 million NFC-enabled phones were sold 
worldwide in 2014, and that number is expected to more than double to over 1 billion 
by 2016 (IHS Technologies, 2015). Prior to September 2014, Apple’s failure to include 
an NFC chip in the iPhone had slowed the adoption of NFC-based mobile wallet 
technology in the United States. However, in September 2014, Apple introduced the 
iPhone 6, which is equipped with NFC chips designed to work with Apple’s mobile 
payments platform, Apple Pay. Building on Apple Passbook and Touch ID biometric 
fingerprint scanning and encryption that Apple previously introduced in September 
2012, Apple Pay is able to be used for mobile payments at the point of sale at a 
physical store as well as online. It is supported by the major credit card networks 
and card issuing banks responsible for over 80% of all credit card transactions, as 
well as many national retailers. Other competitors in NFC-enabled mobile payments 
include Android Pay and Samsung Pay. PayPal and Square are also attacking the 
mobile payment market from a different direction, with apps and credit card readers 
that attach to smartphones. The promise of riches beyond description to a firm that 
is able to dominate the mobile payments marketplace has set off what one commen-
tator has called a goat rodeo surrounding the development of new technologies and 
methods of mobile payment. The end-of-chapter case study, Mobile Payment Market-
place: Goat Rodeo, provides a further look at the future of online and mobile payment 
in the United States, including the efforts of Apple, Google, Samsung, Square, PayPal, 
and others.
SOCIAL/MOBILE PEER-TO-PEER PAYMENT SYSTEMS
In addition to using a mobile device as a vehicle for e-commerce and as a payment 
method at physical point-of-sale, another type of mobile payment transaction is 
becoming increasingly popular: social/mobile peer-to-peer payments. Services such 
as Venmo, Square Cash, Snapcash, the newly refocused Google Wallet, and the new 
Facebook Messenger Payment service all enable users to send another person money 
through a mobile application or Web site, funded by a checking account, debit card, 
credit card, or a digital wallet balance. Currently, these services are the most popular 
among Millennials, which is the key demographic driving their growth. According 
to 451 Research, there are about 22 million mobile P2P payment users in 2015 in 
the United States, a number they expect to grow to over 44 million by 2018. Venmo, 
owned by PayPal, is particularly popular, with its success in part due to its integra-
tion with Facebook and its only social network newsfeed, which lets users see when 
and why friends are paying other friends. In 2014, almost $2.5 billion in transactions 
were made over Venmo. Total mobile P2P volume is projected to grow to $17 billion 
by 2019, according to Forrester Research (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b).

DIGITAL CASH AND VIRTUAL CURRENCIES
Although the terms digital cash and virtual currencies are often used synonymously, 
they actually refer to two separate types of alternative payment systems. Digital cash 
typically is based on an algorithm that generates unique authenticated tokens repre-
senting cash value that can be used “in the real world.” Bitcoin is the best known 
example of digital cash. Bitcoins are encrypted numbers (sometimes referred to as 
cryptocurrency) that are generated by a complex algorithm using a peer-to-peer 
network in a process referred to as “mining” that requires extensive computing power. 
Like real currency, Bitcoins have a fluctuating value tied to open-market trading. Like 
cash, Bitcoins are anonymous—they are exchanged via a 34-character alphanumeric 
address that the user has, and do not require any other identifying information. Bit-
coins have recently attracted a lot of attention as a potential money laundering tool 
for cybercriminals, and have also been plagued by security issues, with some high-
profile heists. Nonetheless, there are companies now using Bitcoins as a legitimate 
alternative payment system. Read the Insight on Business case, Bitcoin, for a further 
look at Bitcoin and some of the issues surrounding it. 
Virtual currencies, on the other hand, typically circulate primarily within an 
internal virtual world community, such as Linden Dollars, created by Linden Lab for 
use in its virtual world, Second Life. Virtual currencies are typically used for purchas-
ing virtual goods. 
	 4.6	
ELECTRONIC BILLING PRESENTMENT AND PAYMENT
In 2007, for the first time, the number of bill payments made online exceeded the 
number of physical checks written in the United States (Fiserv, 2007). In the $17.8 
trillion U.S. economy with a $12.2 trillion consumer sector for goods and services, 
there are billions of bills to pay. According to the U.S. Postal Service, U.S. households 
received about 14 billion bills in 2013 via the mail. No one knows for sure, but some 
experts believe the life-cycle cost of a paper bill for a business, from point of issuance 
to point of payment, ranges from $3 to $7. This calculation does not include the value 
of time to consumers, who must open bills, read them, write checks, address enve-
lopes, stamp, and then mail remittances. The billing market represents an extraordi-
nary opportunity for using the Internet as an electronic billing and payment system 
that potentially could greatly reduce both the cost of paying bills and the time con-
sumers spend paying them. Estimates vary, but online payments are believed to cost 
between only 20 to 30 cents to process.
Electronic billing presentment and payment (EBPP) systems are systems 
that enable the online delivery and payment of monthly bills. EBPP services allow 
consumers to view bills electronically and pay them through electronic funds transfers 
from bank or credit card accounts. More and more companies are choosing to issue 
statements and bills electronically, rather than mailing out paper versions. But even

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
BITCOIN 
In recent years, a number of coun-
tries around the world have experi-
enced banking crises, eroding trust 
in the system. Enter Bitcoin, a form 
of electronic currency that does not 
exist in physical form and can be trans-
ferred from one person to another via peer-to-
peer networks, without the need for a bank or 
other financial institution as intermediary. This 
ability to operate outside the banking system has 
made Bitcoin a favorite of narcotics traffickers 
and buyers and sellers of illicit goods and ser-
vices; but more recently, it has made Bitcoin a 
darling among many in the technological elite 
who believe that Bitcoin and the technology 
behind it could be the next big thing in the pay-
ments industry.
Bitcoin has many unique attributes that 
differentiate it from traditional currencies. Bit-
coins are not physically minted, but have been 
generated by computer software at a predeter-
mined rate beginning in 2009. A finite amount 
of coins are “built into the software,” such that 
in the year 2140, all of the coins will be mined 
and present in the market. The program that is 
used to generate Bitcoins runs on a peer-to-peer 
network and requires powerful computer systems 
to operate. “Mining” a Bitcoin is the result of 
these powerful computers solving cryptographic 
problems in tandem with other similar comput-
ers—the computer that hits upon the solution 
is awarded the coin, and a record of all of the 
involved computers’ attempts at mining the coin 
is logged. Bitcoins derive some of their initial 
value because of the time and computational 
effort required to mine them. 
There are, however, many reasons to be skep-
tical of Bitcoin. Law enforcement agencies and 
governments are justifiably concerned about the 
emergence of a new currency whose purpose is 
to avoid regulation. A newly mined Bitcoin can 
be used with nearly complete anonymity. One 
report found that a full 5% percent of Bitcoins 
that were in circulation were collected by the 
online black market Silk Road, which sold illegal 
drugs before its closure. Still, by using Bitcoin 
addresses in tandem with the services used by 
the individuals in charge of those addresses, 
law enforcement can catch thieves and appre-
hend individuals making illegal purchases. For 
instance, in January 2014, Charlie Shrem, the 
founding member of a foundation to promote 
Bitcoin, was arrested for selling $1 million in 
Bitcoin to Silk Road and for purchasing illegal 
drugs on the site. The Silk Road’s founder, Ross 
Ulbricht, was convicted in February 2015 of 
several charges, including money laundering and 
conspiracy to traffic narcotics.
Nevertheless, the traditional banking system 
does a better job at curtailing money launder-
ing and illicit money transfers than Bitcoin. 
As a result, many governments have taken a 
firm stand against digital cash. In 2014, for 
instance, China’s government announced that it 
had ordered banks to close their Bitcoin trading 
accounts. Denmark has also banned digital cash 
deposits, and other countries like Russia and 
Israel have warned their citizens that similar 
regulations may be forthcoming. 
Each of these developments has put down-
ward pressure on Bitcoin’s value and slowed its 
growth, although nearly 80% of Bitcoin volume 
in 2015 is backed by the Chinese yuan, sug-
gesting that China’s attempts to limit Bitcoin’s 
usage have been unsuccessful. A 2015 analysis 
of Bitcoin usage suggested that Bitcoins are still 
used primarily for gambling, illicit goods, and 
hoarding by speculators. Security concerns have 
also crippled the largest Bitcoin exchanges to 
date, including Mt. Gox and Flexcoin. Hackers

stole $425 million and $600,000 in Bit-
coins from the two exchanges, respectively. 
These regulatory pressures and security con-
cerns have driven Bitcoin’s dizzying volatility. In 
2012, Bitcoin’s value was $6; in 2013, it rose to 
$1,200; and in 2015, it plummeted back down to 
$225, and is struggling to regain traction. 
Despite all of these drawbacks, Bitcoin con-
tinues to move forward, and more banks and 
regulators are recognizing that it may be here to 
stay. In 2015, Goldman Sachs invested heavily in 
Circle Internet Financial, a Bitcoin peer-to-peer 
payment platform, noting that Bitcoin could gain 
international acceptance over time. In June 2015, 
the New York State Department of Financial 
Services released regulations governing the issu-
ance of BitLicenses, which provide a framework 
for virtual currency businesses to operate within 
the state of New York. In September 2015, New 
York issued the first BitLicense to Circle Internet, 
giving it the right to operate in the state, while 
subjecting it to strict capital, consumer protection, 
and anti-money laundering requirements. Many 
large U.S. banks, the New York Stock Exchange, 
Japanese telecom giant DoCoMo, and other com-
panies have invested in Coinbase, an intermedi-
ary for Bitcoin transactions. In 2015, the first 
ever legitimate, licensed Bitcoin bank, itBit, went 
live. Also in 2015, the regulatory agency FINRA 
allowed the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) to be 
traded publicly on an electronic platform, making 
it the first publicly traded Bitcoin investment fund. 
In 2014, the IRS began taxing Bitcoin earnings, 
further legitimizing it in the eyes of regulators.
Companies like Circle Internet Financial hope 
to harness Bitcoin’s decentralized network of com-
puters to enable frictionless and inexpensive move-
ment of currencies across international borders. 
Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are all logged 
on a public ledger known as the blockchain, which 
is updated and maintained by all of the members 
of the network. Contrast this with a bank, which 
is a central hub where all currency and financial 
information reside. With the blockchain, there isn’t 
a single point of failure or vulnerability the way 
there may be with a bank, and no single entity 
must update and maintain the ledger. Businesses 
like Coinbase also want to “sanitize” the currency, 
and distance it from its negative association with 
narcotics and illicit goods. For Bitcoin to truly gain 
acceptance, regular people will need to begin using 
it for everyday transactions. In countries where 
the banking system is less developed than in the 
United States, this has already begun to happen. 
In Argentina, the Philippines, Kenya, and other 
similar countries, excessive banking regulations 
have made Bitcoin a more appealing alternative 
for ordinary people making normal commercial 
transactions.
A number of high-profile online businesses 
accept Bitcoin, such as Dell and Microsoft, as 
well as reportedly over 80,000 other merchants 
around the world. But the total number of busi-
nesses adding Bitcoin as a payment method is on 
the decline. And while the number of individuals 
with Bitcoin wallets grew from 7.4 million in 2014 
to 8.4 million in 2015, Bitcoin trading volume is 
down from its peak in 2014.

as an option to customers, allowing them to immediately transfer funds from a bank 
or credit card account to pay a bill somewhere else.
MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH
In 2002, 61% of bill payments in the United States were made by check, and only 
12% by online bill payments. In 2014, in contrast, online bill payments accounted 
for more than half of all bill payments, while paper checks now account for less than 
25%. Among online households, almost three-quarters pay at least one bill online each 
month, and almost half receive at least one bill electronically each month. Mobile bill 
payments are surging, with 27 million U.S. households in 2014 paying at least one bill 
on a mobile device, up 70% from the previous year. Most consumers cited the con-
venience and time saved by using mobile bill payment (Fiserv, 2013, 2014a, 2014b).
One major reason for the surge in EBPP usage is that companies are starting to 
realize how much money they can save through online billing. Not only is there the 
savings in postage and processing, but payments can be received more quickly (3 to 
12 days faster, compared to paper bills sent via regular mail), thereby improving cash 
flow. Online bill payment options can also reduce the number of phone calls to a 
company’s customer service line. In order to realize these savings, many companies 
are becoming more aggressive in encouraging their customers to move to EBPP by 
instituting a charge for the privilege of continuing to receive a paper bill.
Financials don’t tell the whole story, however. Companies are discovering that a 
bill is both a sales opportunity and a customer retention opportunity, and that the elec-
tronic medium provides many more options when it comes to marketing and promotion. 
Rebates, savings offers, cross-selling, and upselling are all possible in the digital realm.
EBPP BUSINESS MODELS
There are two main competing business models in the EBPP marketspace: biller-direct 
and consolidator. The biller-direct system was originally created by utility companies 
that send millions of bills each month. Their purpose is to make it easier for their 
customers to pay their utility bills routinely online. Today, telephone and credit card 
companies also frequently offer this service, as well as a number of individual stores. 
Companies implementing a biller-direct system can either develop their own system in-
house (usually only an option for the very largest companies), install a system acquired 
from a third-party EBPP software vendor, use a third-party EBPP service bureau (the 
service bureau hosts a biller-branded Web site that enables consumers to view and pay 
bills and handles all customer enrollment, bill presentment, and payment processing), or 
use an application service provider (similar to a service bureau, but runs on the biller’s 
Web site rather than being hosted on the service provider’s Web site).
In the consolidator model, a third party, such as a financial institution or a focused 
portal such as Intuit’s Paytrust, Fiserv’s MyCheckFree, Mint Bills, and others, aggre-
gates all bills for consumers and ideally permits one-stop bill payment (pay anyone). 
Currently, financial institutions have been more successful than portals in attracting 
online bill payers. The consolidator model faces several challenges. For billers, using 
the consolidator model means an increased time lag between billing and payment, and 
also inserts an intermediary between the company and its customer. For consumers,

security continues to be a major issue. Most consumers are unwilling to pay any kind 
of fee to pay bills online, and many are concerned about sharing personal financial 
information with nonfinancial institutions. Today, more and more banks are offering 
online bill payment free to some or all of their customers as an enticement.
Supporting these two primary business models are infrastructure providers such 
as Fiserv, Yodlee, FIS Global, ACI Worldwide, MasterCard RPPS (Remote Payment and 
Presentment Service), and others that provide the software to create the EBPP system 
or handle billing and payment collection for the biller. Figure 4.15 categorizes the 
major players in the EBPP marketspace.

Goat Rodeo
N
early every day, it seems, a new mobile payment system is 
announced. The mobile payment marketplace is experiencing an 
explosion of innovative ideas, plans, and announcements, which 
one commentator has likened to a goat rodeo, a chaotic situation in 
which powerful players with different agendas compete with one another for public 
acceptance, and above all, huge potential revenues. It’s a battle among the titans of 
online payment and retailing: PayPal, credit card companies like Visa and Master-
Card, Google, Apple, start-up tech companies like Square that offer mobile credit card 
swiping backed by millions in venture capital, and even large retailers like Walmart, 
Best Buy, and Target, all of which are developing their own mobile payment systems 
that they control. Although consumers still prefer to pay with credit cards and cash

on the go, digital mobile payment systems may finally be poised to deliver on their 
long-awaited promise. 
Apple entered the fray in 2014 with its announcement of Apple Pay for iPhone 
6 smartphones, joining Google and others that already had developed a mobile 
payment system using Near Field Communication (NFC), a short-range radio com-
munications protocol that operates within a range of a few inches, and allows con-
sumers to bump, swipe, or just come close to a merchant’s NFC reader to pay for 
goods and services. What’s different about Apple’s announcement of an NFC-based 
payment system is that it’s Apple—the firm that revolutionized five different indus-
tries and introduced the first smartphones, forever changing how people shop and 
communicate with one another. Apple’s iTunes store already has the credit card 
information of 800 million users, arguably the largest such collection on earth. In 
2015, Apple introduced its Apple Watch, which also includes Apple Pay.
Apple Pay is more than an app or a smartphone feature—it’s an ecosystem 
unto itself. Apple has developed relationships with many of the key players in the 
payment ecosystem, including credit giants Visa, MasterCard, American Express, 
and Discover, as well as 11 large bank credit card issuers including JPMorgan Chase, 
Bank America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, which together account for 83% of U.S. 
credit card payment volume. Apple has also signed up national merchants such 
as Walgreens, Duane Reade, McDonald’s, Disney, Macys, Bloomingdales, Staples, 
and Whole Foods. Groupon and Uber have integrated Apple Pay into their systems. 
Unlike the introductions of other mobile payment systems, which tended to reflect 
the self-interest of those making the introduction, Apple’s approach is much more 
inclusive of the major stakeholders in the marketplace. Target, Walmart, and Best 
Buy are missing the Apple party because they are developing their own mobile 
payment systems. 
Security is a central issue for all payment systems, and given the evident lack of 
security for Internet-connected devices and databases, payment security is a major 
concern for consumers and banks and merchants. The Apple announcement came 
on the heels of news in August 2014 that several celebrities had their personal iCloud 
accounts hacked, resulting in the distribution of provocative pictures on social media 
and the Web. Target, Home Depot, and several major banks reported their customer 
databases and point of sale terminals had been hacked in 2014 as well, resulting in 
hackers gaining access to millions of credit card numbers and pin codes. For this 
reason, the emphasis at Apple Pay’s introduction was security.
The Apple Pay system uses several levels of security to avoid the loss of cus-
tomer information. Apple Pay relies on the customer having a credit card on file with 
Apple’s iTunes, and that card is the financial vehicle for payment. When a customer 
wants to make a payment, he or she presses the iPhone Touch ID button, which reads 
the customer’s fingerprint and ensures the phone does indeed belong to the person. 
On the Apple Watch, there’s a special button just for Apple Pay transactions. Next, 
the consumer swipes the device near a merchant’s NFC point-of-sale terminal, which 
begins the transaction process. The iPhone 6 comes with a hardware-defined secure 
area on a chip that contains a unique device number and the ability to generate a

one-time 16-digit code. Together they form a digital token. The token information is 
encrypted and sent to Apple servers to verify the authenticity of the device and the 
person. Credit card issuers verify the account owner and available credit. In about 
one second, the transaction is approved or denied. Credit card information is not 
shared with the merchant and not transmitted from the iPhone. The 800 million 
credit cards stored on Apple’s servers are also encrypted. If hackers intercept the 
NFC communication at the point of sale, or intercept the stream of data moving over 
the cellular network, it would be useless, and incapable of supporting additional 
transactions because the message is encrypted, and involves a one-time-only code. 
Privacy is also an issue. Traditional credit card payment systems gather extensive 
information on user charges, recording what is purchased, where, and when. Selling 
credit card purchase information to credit agencies and data brokers is an important 
income stream for banks that issue credit cards. Apple Pay will not be playing that 
game. Timothy Cook, Apple’s CEO, pointed out in an interview in September 2014 
that Apple Pay gathers no consumer information, and that Apple is a technology 
company and not an advertising company. Apple Pay will not gather any consumer 
information that could be used to target or track consumers, or expose them to addi-
tional targeted advertising. 
How will Apple make money from Apple Pay? Credit card companies charge 
merchants a fee of 2% to 3% of the amount for each transaction. Apple Pay will not 
charge the merchant or the consumer an additional fee. Instead Apple will charge 
the credit card issuer bank a .15% fee in return for guaranteeing the authenticity of 
the transaction. In essence, Apple is providing an insurance policy for the issuers 
of credit cards. If the transaction is fraudulent, Apple will pay the issuer. Apple 
Pay could significantly reduce credit card fraud in the United States, benefiting the 
issuing banks directly.
Apple’s .15% fee is a very small charge, but Apple is confident in its system and 
willing to invest in its own technology. Assuming Apple Pay rings up $1 billion in 
transactions, how much will the banks and Apple receive as revenue? The banks on 
average will collect 3%, which works out to $30 million. Apple will receive just .15% 
or $1.5 million for every $1 billion in transactions, which probably will not clear 
the costs of operating Apple Pay. The real value to Apple is not the revenue from 
Apple Pay, but its contribution to the sales of Apple products like the iPhone and 
iPad, as well as the entire Apple ecosystem of services provided by iTunes. Apple 
becomes not just your source for music, videos, movies, television, books, and over 
1.5 million apps, but also your wallet. 
There are some obvious drawbacks to Apple Pay. It works only on Apple devices 
(and only on the latest iPhone 6 and Apple Watch); merchants need to buy NFC-
enabled point-of-sale terminals, and consumers will need to change their behaviors 
for Apple Pay to achieve widespread acceptance. Finally, merchants lose some of 
their control over the point-of-payment/purchase moment when they could be up-
selling customers, offering coupons, ads, and loyalty points.
The overall online payment market in the United States is estimated to be 
worth about $530 billion in 2015 and is growing at more than 12% a year. While

still comparatively small compared to the total e-commerce picture, m-commerce, 
driven by smartphones, tablets, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks, is growing at more 
than 30% a year. In 2015, U.S. m-commerce is expected to generate $128 billion in 
revenue. While most of these m-commerce transactions are occurring through the 
use of credit cards (just as with desktop e-commerce), there is a rapidly growing 
segment of proximity mobile payments (payments that use a mobile phone as the 
payment method, via tapping, waving, or similar functionality) which is expected 
to amount to about $8.7 billion in the United States in 2015 and grow astronomi-
cally to over $210 billion by 2019. U.S. consumers spent an estimated $5.1 trillion 
on credit and debit card transactions in 2014. Even if a small percentage of these 
transactions move from plastic to mobile payments, the potential revenue is very 
large. This is enough to drive even old goats into a frenzy. 
Apple has a number of competitors in mobile payments. Contenders in the NFC-
enabled proximity mobile payment market currently include Android Pay, Samsung 
Pay, and CurrentC, a system being developed by Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX). 
Android Pay is a Google app that provides an NFC-based payment system much 
like Apple Pay. Android Pay replaces Google Wallet, which has been repurposed 
as a peer-to-peer payment service that allows users to pay friends using only their 
e-mail address, similar to PayPal. Android Pay is enabled by a prepaid MasterCard. 
Users must keep a balance with the issuing bank to fund purchases, as with any 
debit card, and have an Android Pay account. To use Android Pay, customers hold 
their phone near the merchant’s NFC terminal at checkout. Users are asked for their 
PIN and then choose to pay with either a MasterCard debit card or a balance kept 
with Android Pay. If the user chooses to pay with MasterCard, the app passes the 
credit information to the merchant’s terminal, which then clears the transaction 
with MasterCard. Bancorp Bank is the issuing bank. Android Pay is free to credit 
card companies and merchants. However, Google may offer consumers, rewards, 
and other loyalty programs through Android Pay that could generate substantial 
revenue. 
Samsung Pay was introduced by Samsung in the United States in September 
2015, after an earlier roll-out in Samsung’s home country, South Korea. Unlike Apple 
Pay or Android Pay, Samsung Pay reportedly works in almost all stores, without 
merchants needing to opt-in to any program or update their point-of-sale terminals, 
by using Magnetic Secure Transmission, a technology Samsung acquired when it 
purchased mobile payment company LoopPay earlier in 2015. Samsung Pay works 
only with certain phones offered by Samsung using AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or US 
Cellular. An American Express card, or a Visa or MasterCard issued by Bank of 
America, Citibank, or US Bank, also is required. 
Perhaps the strongest competition for both Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung 
Pay will eventually come from the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), a joint 
venture of 15 of the largest retailers, including Walmart, Target, Sears, 7-Eleven, 
Sunoco, and 10 other national pharmacies, supermarkets, and restaurant chains. 
Announced in March 2012, the backers of this effort have annual sales of more than 
$1 trillion dollars. That’s enough to make everyone involved in mobile payments

stand up and listen, even Google and Apple. The MCX system, called CurrentC, was 
pilot tested in 2014, and will be released in a national roll-out in 2016 after plans for 
a 2015 rollout were delayed. It is the only merchant-owned mobile payment system.
CurrentC is an app-based mobile payment system for both iOS and Android 
devices that permits customers to pay at the point of sale from credit or debit cards, 
gift cards, or bank accounts using their smartphone. During the checkout process, 
merchants can offer coupons, rewards, and loyalty points on the user’s payment 
screen. CurrentC works by allowing users to load value (pre-paid cards or credit 
cards) into the app. It then generates a QR code unique to each customer that is 
displayed on the phone screen. After swiping the QR code, an encrypted token is 
generated and sent to MCX cloud servers, which store the credit card information 
and make the approval decision. An acceptance token is returned to the merchant. 
Older point of sale systems can be modified to read this QR code, reducing the need 
for merchants to upgrade.
Why are these nationwide merchants willing to invest billions in a mobile 
payment system when financial service firms and technology players also are invest-
ing billions in competing systems? The answer is control over the customer during 
the transaction, and the information on customer purchase history that the apps 
will be recording. The merchants do not want this valuable marketing asset to flow 
to financial service firms, or Google, Apple, and Samsung. To some extent, the 
coming mobile payment battle is one between tech companies like Apple, Google, 
and Samsung, and the traditional brick and mortar merchants. The banks and credit 
card companies will benefit no matter who wins.
While NFC-enabled mobile payments may be the future, other types of mobile 
payments are already here. Currently, the most popular mobile payment systems are 
offered by PayPal and Square, which do not use NFC. PayPal was late to the mobile 
payment market, beaten to the punch by Square. Square started in 2009 with Square 
Reader, a square plastic device that plugged into an iPhone or iPad. Using the Square 
app, it allows merchants to easily accept credit card payments from customers on 
the go. Square also developed Square Register (now called Point of Sale), which is a 
software app that turns a tablet into a point-of-sale terminal and cash register. Square 
has been very popular with small businesses like coffee shops, newsstands, small 
retailers, and farmers’ market merchants, as well as piano teachers, baby sitters, and 
taxi drivers, allowing them to accept credit card payments. Square is expected to go 
public in October 2015, and is reportedly on track to take in $1 billion in revenue in 
2015, although it is expected that it will not show a net profit. But a closer analysis 
reveals that most of its losses resulted from a failed partnership with Starbucks as 
its exclusive payment processor, and that it makes money on all of its other transac-
tions. The future may be brighter than the present for Square.
PayPal is currently the most successful and profitable mobile payment system. 
PayPal currently enables mobile payments in three ways. First, PayPal sells to 
merchants a device that allows them to swipe credit cards using a smartphone or 
tablet, just like the Square device. Second, the most common mobile PayPal mobile 
payment occurs when customers use their mobile device browser to make a pur-

chase or payment at a Web site. This is not very helpful for merchants like Starbucks, 
Macys, or local restaurants, who would like customers to be able to purchase goods 
in their stores and outlets on the fly without keying in information to a smartphone. 
A third method is PayPal’s updated app for iOS and Android devices. On entering a 
merchant’s store that accepts PayPal app payments, the app establishes a link using 
Bluetooth with the merchant’s app that is also running on an iOS or Android device. 
This step authenticates the user’s PayPal account. On checkout, the customer tells 
the merchant he or she will pay with PayPal. The merchant device charges the cus-
tomer’s PayPal account. After the payment is authorized, a message is sent to the 
customer’s phone. No credit card information is being transmitted or shared with the 
merchant or the issuing bank. Users do not have to enter a pin code or swipe their 
phone at a special merchant device, so merchants are not required to purchase an 
expensive NFC point-of-sale device. However, in 2015, PayPal announced the release 
of a device that will both read new credit cards equipped with computer chips, as 
well as accept payments from Android Pay and Apple Pay.
PayPal is currently the largest alternative (non-credit card) online payment 
service, processing $228 billion in transactions in 2014. PayPal processed $46 billion 
in mobile payments in 2014, up from $27 billion in 2013. Most of this mobile payment 
volume involved customers using their mobile phones or tablet browsers to make 
payments, just as they use PayPal on their PCs at work or home. PayPal has not 
announced the performance of the PayPal app, but acceptance appears to be very 
limited in 2015, in part because neither merchants nor customers are familiar with 
the product. 
The future for smartphone mobile payments is assured given the size of the 
players involved, the potential rewards for successful players, and the demands of 
consumers for a payment system that does not involve swiping plastic cards and 
dealing with slips of paper. But it is unlikely that all the payment systems described 
above will survive, and also quite likely that consumers will remain confused by all 
their payment options for some time yet to come.

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the scope of e-commerce crime and security problems, the key dimensions of e-commerce security, and the 
tension between security and other values.
•	
While the overall size of cybercrime is unclear, cybercrime against e-commerce sites is growing rapidly, 
the amount of losses is growing, and the management of e-commerce sites must prepare for a variety of 
criminal assaults.
•	
There are six key dimensions to e-commerce security: integrity, nonrepudiation, authenticity, confidenti-
ality, privacy, and availability.
•	
Although computer security is considered necessary to protect e-commerce activities, it is not without a 
downside. Two major areas where there are tensions between security and Web site operations are:
•	
Ease of use—The more security measures that are added to an e-commerce site, the more difficult it 
is to use and the slower the site becomes, hampering ease of use. Security is purchased at the price 
of slowing down processors and adding significantly to data storage demands. Too much security can 
harm profitability, while not enough can potentially put a company out of business.
•	
Public safety—There is a tension between the claims of individuals to act anonymously and the needs 
of public officials to maintain public safety that can be threatened by criminals or terrorists.
Identify the key security threats in the e-commerce environment 
•	
The most common and most damaging forms of security threats to e-commerce sites include:
•	
Malicious code—viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and bot networks are a threat to a sys-
tem’s integrity and continued operation, often changing how a system functions or altering docu-
ments created on the system.
•	
Potentially unwanted programs (adware, spyware, etc.)—a kind of security threat that arises when pro-
grams are surreptitiously installed on your computer or computer network without your consent.
•	
Phishing—any deceptive, online attempt by a third party to obtain confidential information for finan-
cial gain.
•	
Hacking and cybervandalism—intentionally disrupting, defacing, or even destroying a site.
•	
Credit card fraud/theft—one of the most-feared occurrences and one of the main reasons more con-
sumers do not participate in e-commerce. The most common cause of credit card fraud is a lost or 
stolen card that is used by someone else, followed by employee theft of customer numbers and sto-
len identities (criminals applying for credit cards using false identities).
•	
Identity fraud—involves the unauthorized use of another person’s personal data, such as social secu-
rity, driver’s license, and/or credit card numbers, as well as user names and passwords, for illegal 
financial benefit. 
•	
Spoofing—occurs when hackers attempt to hide their true identities or misrepresent themselves by 
using fake e-mail addresses or masquerading as someone else.
•	
Pharming—involves redirecting a Web link to an address different from the intended one, with the 
site masquerading as the intended destination.
•	
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks—hackers flood a Web site with 
useless traffic to inundate and overwhelm the network, frequently causing it to shut down and dam-
aging a site’s reputation and customer relationships.

•	
Sniffing—a type of eavesdropping program that monitors information traveling over a network, 
enabling hackers to steal proprietary information from anywhere on a network, including e-mail 
messages, company files, and confidential reports. The threat of sniffing is that confidential or per-
sonal information will be made public.
•	
Insider jobs—although the bulk of Internet security efforts are focused on keeping outsiders out, the 
biggest threat is from employees who have access to sensitive information and procedures.
•	
Poorly designed server and client software—the increase in complexity and size of software programs 
has contributed to an increase in software flaws or vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.
•	
Social network security issues—malicious code, PUPs, phishing, data breaches, identity fraud, and 
other e-commerce security threats have all infiltrated social networks.
•	
Mobile platform security issues—the mobile platform presents an alluring target for hackers and cyber-
criminals, and faces all the same risks as other Internet devices, as well as new risks associated with 
wireless network security.
•	
Cloud security issues—as devices, identities, and data become more and more intertwined in the 
cloud, safeguarding data in the cloud becomes a major concern.
Describe how technology helps secure Internet communications channels and protect networks, servers, and clients.
•	
Encryption is the process of transforming plain text or data into cipher text that cannot be read by anyone 
other than the sender and the receiver. Encryption can provide four of the six key dimensions of e-com-
merce security: message integrity, nonrepudiation, authentication, and confidentiality.
•	
There are a variety of different forms of encryption technology currently in use. They include:
•	
Symmetric key cryptography—Both the sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt and 
decrypt a message. 
•	
Public key cryptography—Two mathematically related digital keys are used: a public key and a private 
key. The private key is kept secret by the owner, and the public key is widely disseminated. Both 
keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Once the keys are used to encrypt a message, 
the same keys cannot be used to unencrypt the message.
•	
Public key cryptography using digital signatures and hash digests—This method uses a mathematical 
algorithm called a hash function to produce a fixed-length number called a hash digest. The results 
of applying the hash function are sent by the sender to the recipient. Upon receipt, the recipient 
applies the hash function to the received message and checks to verify that the same result is pro-
duced. The sender then encrypts both the hash result and the original message using the recipient’s 
public key, producing a single block of cipher text. To ensure both the authenticity of the message 
and nonrepudiation, the sender encrypts the entire block of cipher text one more time using the 
sender’s private key. This produces a digital signature or “signed” cipher text that can be sent over 
the Internet to ensure the confidentiality of the message and authenticate the sender.
•	
Digital envelope—This method uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt the document, 
but public key cryptography to encrypt and send the symmetric key.
•	
Digital certificates and public key infrastructure—This method relies on certification authorities who 
issue, verify, and guarantee digital certificates (a digital document that contains the name of the 
subject or company, the subject’s public key, a digital certificate serial number, an expiration date, 
an issuance date, the digital signature of the certification authority, and other identifying informa-
tion).
•	
In addition to encryption, there are several other tools that are used to secure Internet channels of com-
munication, including: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), virtual private net-
works (VPNs), and wireless security standards such as WPA2.

•	
After communications channels are secured, tools to protect networks, the servers, and clients should be 
implemented. These include: firewalls, proxies, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IDP), 
operating system controls, and anti-virus software.
Appreciate the importance of policies, procedures, and laws in creating security.
•	
In order to minimize security threats, e-commerce firms must develop a coherent corporate policy that 
takes into account the nature of the risks, the information assets that need protecting, and the procedures 
and technologies required to address the risk, as well as implementation and auditing mechanisms.
•	
Public laws and active enforcement of cybercrime statutes also are required to both raise the costs of 
illegal behavior on the Internet and guard against corporate abuse of information.
•	
The key steps in developing a security plan are:
•	
Perform a risk assessment—an assessment of the risks and points of vulnerability.
•	
Develop a security policy—a set of statements prioritizing the information risks, identifying acceptable 
risk targets, and identifying the mechanisms for achieving these targets.
•	
Create an implementation plan—a plan that determines how you will translate the levels of acceptable 
risk into a set of tools, technologies, policies, and procedures.
•	
Create a security team—the individuals who will be responsible for ongoing maintenance, audits, and 
improvements.
•	
Perform periodic security audits—routine reviews of access logs and any unusual patterns of activity.
Identify the major e-commerce payment systems in use today.
•	
The major types of e-commerce payment systems in use today include:
•	
Online credit card transactions, which are the primary form of online payment system. There are five 
parties involved in an online credit card purchase: consumer, merchant, clearinghouse, merchant 
bank (sometimes called the “acquiring bank”), and the consumer’s card-issuing bank. However, the 
online credit card system has a number of limitations involving security, merchant risk, cost, and 
social equity.
•	
PayPal, which is an example of an online stored value payment system that permits consumers to 
make instant, online payments to merchants and other individuals based on value stored in an 
online account.
•	
Alternative payment services such as Amazon Payments, Visa Checkout, and Bill Me Later, which 
enable consumers to shop online at a wide variety of merchants without having to provide credit 
card information each time they make a purchase. 
•	
Mobile payment systems, using either credit card readers attached to a smartphone (Square, PayPal 
Here) or near field communication (NFC) chips, which enable proximity mobile payment, used by 
Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay.
•	
Digital cash such as Bitcoin, which is based on an algorithm that generates unique authenticated 
tokens representing cash value, and virtual currencies, that typically circulate within an internal 
virtual world or are issued by a corporation, and usually used for the purchase of virtual goods.
Describe the features and functionality of electronic billing presentment and payment systems.
•	
Electronic billing presentment and payment (EBPP) systems are a form of online payment systems for 
monthly bills. EBPP services allow consumers to view bills electronically and pay them through elec-
tronic funds transfers from bank or credit card accounts. Major players in the EBPP marketspace include: 
biller-direct systems, consolidators, and infrastructure providers.

The rise of e-commerce has 
disrupted countless tradi-
tional retail market seg-
ments, but even today there remain areas 
where e-commerce innovation has yet to 
fully take place. Until recently, one of 
those areas was the optical industry. The 
supply chain for selling glasses typically 
includes a host of different players, includ-
ing frame manufacturers, lens manufac-
turers, opticians, franchises, and very few 
individual direct retailers. Several compa-
nies have emerged looking to change that 
paradigm, including Amsterdam-based Ace 
& Tate.
Ace & Tate sells eyewear in the United 
Kingdom, Netherlands, and Germany, and is planning expansion into other areas. Named 
after acetate, the flexible, durable, lightweight material used in all of its glasses, Ace & 
Tate has used the cost savings made possible by disrupting the traditional eyewear supply 
chain to offer quality glasses at a low price point of €98. The company has a full-time 
staff of 25 employees in Amsterdam, including its eyewear designers. Key processes like 
manufacturing and shipping are performed by external vendors. Ace & Tate’s lean business 
model allows it to keep costs low and focus on its core goal: creating a strong, stylish 
product at a fraction of the usual price.
Ace & Tate’s CEO Mark de Lange was motivated by the premise that changing 
eyewear should be as simple as changing a pair of sneakers. To de Lange, the fact that 
many of us have several pairs of sneakers but only one pair of glasses is indicative of 
inefficiency in the marketplace. Opticians are a good option for people with complicated 
prescriptions, extremely bad eyesight, or a need for a multi-focal prescription. For the 
majority of people who wear glasses without such specific requirements, the high prices of 
glasses are difficult to justify, and the middlemen that come between the glasses and the 
customer are simply unnecessary. By selling directly to consumers, Ace & Tate can avoid 
the markups introduced by third-party, bricks-and-mortar retailers, as well as opticians 
and other entities along the supply chain. Ace & Tate represents a cost-effective option 
for simpler prescriptions, as well as for non-prescription eyewear worn purely for style.

C H A P T E R  5     E - c o m m e r c e  B u s i n e s s  S t r a t e g i e s
Ace & Tate sells almost exclusively online, using a flat fee payment system for each 
pair of glasses. Many extra services are bundled into the base price, including free shipping 
and returns, a flexible return policy, and the ability to try on up to four pairs of glasses, 
also delivered for free, over the span of five days. Any more than four glasses per delivery 
would compromise Ace & Tate’s ability to maintain sufficient inventory and increase the 
size of the box beyond normal mailboxes. Ace & Tate relies on a family-owned eyewear 
manufacturer in Northern Italy for most of its glasses, a well-regarded Dutch laboratory 
for its synthetic lenses, and a third-party logistics company based in the Netherlands 
for most of its shipping. The company also selects the correct synthetic glasses and lens 
coatings for users at no extra charge, and includes ultraviolet protection, also at no extra 
charge.
Technologically, as a company that sells its products almost exclusively online, a robust 
e-commerce infrastructure is a must. Ace & Tate uses Bootstrap CSS, an open source 
front-end framework, for its Web site home page. Bootstrap allows Ace & Tate customers 
to shop on mobile devices just as effectively as on desktops, quickly and efficiently scaling 
Web sites and applications in accordance with the device each customer is using to access 
the site. The full site uses responsive Web design with Magento, an e-commerce software 
and platform provider. The Magento Web store and custom Magento extensions further 
enrich the customer experience on the site. For Ace & Tate, using responsive design features 
on its site is critical to allowing consumers to shop on any device of their choosing.
Ace & Tate’s typical demographic are younger, style-conscious consumers who are 
open to the idea of buying glasses in a new way. The cost savings compared to the 
traditional optical industry supply chains are also appealing to the typical Ace & Tate 
consumer. CEO de Lange and other top executives personally oversee every area of the 
business, including design, where their goal is to blend classic frame designs with modern 
Dutch style. Ace & Tate also places great importance on conservation and philanthropy; its 
“Black is the New Green” collection is fully biodegradable and made mostly from natural 
sources, and the company also donates to Sightsavers, a charity with a focus on eliminat-
ing blindness in developing and impoverished countries, with every pair of glasses it sells.
While Ace & Tate is likely to remain an e-commerce retailer first and foremost, 
the company has experimented with various forms of physical presence. The company 
opened a full-time physical store in Amsterdam using a local design studio to create a 
space that complements Ace & Tate’s sleek, fashionable style and modern feel. In 2015, 
it added a second location in Berlin to bolster its presence in Germany, its most recent 
area of expansion. Ace & Tate also has agreements with individual outlets like Hutspot in 
Amsterdam, where customers can view and try on different styles of glasses—but even 
in these individual outlets, ordering is still done online.
In 2015, Ace & Tate only ships to addresses in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, 
and Germany, but the company is likely to offer shipping to other countries in the near 
future. The U.S. equivalent to Ace & Tate is Warby Parker, also an online retailer of 
eyeglasses and sunglasses. Warby Parker was founded in 2010, and provided many 
entrepreneurs, including the founders of Ace & Tate, with inspiration that the business

direct-to-consumer model could work. Billing itself as “the Netflix of eyewear,” Warby 
Parker has had little trouble raising venture capital and growing quickly. Warby Parker 
charges $95 for all of its glasses and sells direct to consumers online, just like Ace & 
Tate. However, Warby Parker has nine stores across the United States, and is taking steps 
to expand beyond just eyewear.
Warby Parker is renowned for its hip, trendy brand, carefully cultivated by its founders, 
Neil Blumenthal and David Gilboa, and for its obsessive attention to customer service. 
With revenue over $100 million and over a million pairs of glasses sold, Warby Parker is 
a thriving business, and has blazed the trail not only for Ace & Tate, but also for a variety 
of other companies, including GlassesDirect in the United Kingdom and Quattrocento in 
Italy, both of whom represent competition for Ace & Tate in Europe. Other industries have 
taken note of the direct-to-consumer e-commerce business model, such as razor blades and 
other shaving implements (Harry’s), mattresses (Casper and Novosbed), and backpacks 
(Just Porter). By bypassing traditional retailers and selling directly to consumers, these 
companies can all offer savings and improvements in quality and customer service. These 
companies are commanding respect from investors and venture capitalists because of 
their profitability and potential for growth. Ace & Tate should be able to ride this wave 
to sustained success.

he story of Ace & Tate illustrates the process of turning a good business 
idea into a successful business model that produces revenues and even 
profits.

capital much faster than they can get customers to pay for their products or services. 
In most instances of failure, the business model of the firm is faulty from the begin-
ning. In contrast, successful e-commerce firms have business models that are able 
to leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the mobile platform, 
provide customers real value, develop highly effective and efficient operations, avoid 
legal and social entanglements that can harm the firm, and produce profitable business 
results. In addition, successful business models must scale. The business must be able 
to achieve efficiencies as it grows in volume. But what is a business model, and how 
can you tell if a firm’s business model is going to produce a profit?
In this chapter, we focus on business models and basic business concepts that you 
must be familiar with in order to understand e-commerce.

E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS 
INTRODUCTION
A business model is a set of planned activities (sometimes referred to as business 
processes) designed to result in a profit in a marketplace. A business model is not 
always the same as a business strategy, although in some cases they are very close 
insofar as the business model explicitly takes into account the competitive environ-
ment (Magretta, 2002). The business model is at the center of the business plan. A 
business plan is a document that describes a firm’s business model. A business plan 
always takes into account the competitive environment. An e-commerce business 
model aims to use and leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the 
mobile platform.
EIGHT KEY ELEMENTS OF A BUSINESS MODEL
If you hope to develop a successful business model in any arena, not just e-com-
merce, you must make sure that the model effectively addresses the eight elements 
listed in Figure 5.1. These elements are value proposition, revenue model, market 
opportunity, competitive environment, competitive advantage, market strategy, 
organizational development, and management team. Many writers focus on a firm’s 
value proposition and revenue model. While these may be the most important and 
most easily identifiable aspects of a company’s business model, the other elements 
are equally important when evaluating business models and plans, or when attempt-
ing to understand why a particular company has succeeded or failed (Kim and 
Mauborgne, 2000). In the following sections, we describe each of the key business 
model elements more fully.

Value Proposition
A company’s value proposition is at the very heart of its business model. A value 
proposition defines how a company’s product or service fulfills the needs of custom-
ers (Kambil, Ginsberg, and Bloch, 1998). To develop and/or analyze a firm’s value 
proposition, you need to understand why customers will choose to do business with 
the firm instead of another company and what the firm provides that other firms do 
not and cannot. From the consumer point of view, successful e-commerce value propo-
sitions include personalization and customization of product offerings, reduction of 
product search costs, reduction of price discovery costs, and facilitation of transactions 
by managing product delivery.

A business model has eight key elements. Each element must be addressed if you hope to be successful.

For instance, before Amazon existed, most customers personally traveled to book 
retailers to place an order. In some cases, the desired book might not be available, 
and the customer would have to wait several days or weeks, and then return to the 
bookstore to pick it up. Amazon makes it possible for book lovers to shop for virtually 
any book in print from the comfort of their home or office, 24 hours a day, and to know 
immediately whether a book is in stock. Amazon’s Kindle takes this one step further 
by making e-books instantly available with no shipping wait. Amazon’s primary value 
propositions are unparalleled selection and convenience.
Revenue Model
A firm’s revenue model describes how the firm will earn revenue, generate profits, 
and produce a superior return on invested capital. We use the terms revenue model and 
financial model interchangeably. The function of business organizations is both to 
generate profits and to produce returns on invested capital that exceed alternative 
investments. Profits alone are not sufficient to make a company “successful” (Porter, 
1985). In order to be considered successful, a firm must produce returns greater than 
alternative investments. Firms that fail this test go out of existence.
Although there are many different e-commerce revenue models that have been 
developed, most companies rely on one, or some combination, of the following major 
revenue models: advertising, subscription, transaction fee, sales, and affiliate.
In the advertising revenue model, a company that offers content, services, 
and/or products also provides a forum for advertisements and receives fees from 
advertisers. Companies that are able to attract the greatest viewership or that have a 
highly specialized, differentiated viewership and are able to retain user attention 
(“stickiness”) are able to charge higher advertising rates. Yahoo, for instance, derives 
a significant amount of revenue from display and video advertising.
In the subscription revenue model, a company that offers content or services 
charges a subscription fee for access to some or all of its offerings. For instance, the 
digital version of Consumer Reports provides online and mobile access to premium 
content, such as detailed ratings, reviews, and recommendations, only to subscribers, 
who have a choice of paying a $6.95 monthly subscription fee or a $30.00 annual fee. 
Experience with the subscription revenue model indicates that to successfully overcome 
the disinclination of users to pay for content, the content offered must be perceived as 
a high-value-added, premium offering that is not readily available elsewhere nor easily 
replicated. Companies successfully offering content or services online on a subscription 
basis include eHarmony (dating services), Ancestry (genealogy research), Microsoft’s 
Xbox Live (video games), Pandora, Spotify, and Rhapsody (music), Scribd, and Amazon’s 
Kindle Unlimited program (e-books), and Netflix and Hulu (television and movies). See 
Table 5.1 for examples of various subscription services.
Recently, a number of companies have been combining a subscription revenue 
model with a freemium strategy. In a freemium strategy, the companies give away 
a certain level of product or services for free, but then charge a subscription fee for 
premium levels of the product or service. See the case study, Freemium Takes Pandora 
Public, at the end of the chapter, for a further look at the freemium strategy.

In the transaction fee revenue model, a company receives a fee for enabling 
or executing a transaction. For example, eBay provides an auction marketplace and 
receives a small transaction fee from a seller if the seller is successful in selling the 
item. E*Trade, a financial services provider, receives transaction fees each time it 
executes a stock transaction on behalf of a customer.
In the sales revenue model, companies derive revenue by selling goods, content, 
or services to customers. Companies such as Amazon (which sells books, music, and 
other products), L.L.Bean, and Gap all have sales revenue models. A number of com-
panies are also using a subscription-based sales revenue model. Birchbox, which offers 
home delivery of beauty products for a $10 monthly or $100 annual subscription price, 
is one example.
In the affiliate revenue model, companies that steer business to an “affiliate” 
receive a referral fee or percentage of the revenue from any resulting sales. For 
example, MyPoints makes money by connecting companies with potential customers 
by offering special deals to its members. When they take advantage of an offer and 
make a purchase, members earn “points” they can redeem for freebies, and MyPoints 
receives a fee. Community feedback companies typically receive some of their revenue 
from steering potential customers to Web sites where they make a purchase.
Table 5.2 on page 328 summarizes these major revenue models. The Insight on 
Society case, Foursquare: Check Your Privacy at the Door, examines some of the issues 
associated with Foursquare's business and revenue model.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY 
FOURSQUARE: CHECK YOUR PRIVACY AT THE DOOR
Foursquare is one of a host of com-
panies that combine a social network 
business model with location-based 
technology. Foursquare offers mobile 
social applications that know where you 
are located and can provide you with informa-
tion about popular spots nearby, as well as reviews 
from other Foursquare users. These apps also allow 
you to check in to a restaurant or other location, 
and automatically let friends on Facebook and 
other social networks learn where you are. 
Founded in 2008 by Dennis Crowley and 
Naveen Selvadurai, Foursquare has over 60 
million registered users and more than 50 million 
monthly active users worldwide, split fairly evenly 
between the United States and the rest of the 
world, who have checked in over 7.5 billion times. 
Foursquare shares many similarities with 
other social networks like Facebook and Twitter 
that began operating without a revenue model in 
place. Like those companies, Foursquare has been 
able to command high valuations from venture 
capital investors, despite unimpressive revenue and 
profits. How is this possible? The answer lies in the 
coupling of its social network business model with 
smartphone-based technology that can identify 
where you are located within a few yards. There’s 
potentially a great deal of money to be made from 
knowing where you are. Location-based data has 
extraordinary commercial value because advertis-
ers can then send you advertisements, coupons, and 
flash bargains, based on where you are located. 
Just as Facebook and Twitter are monetiz-
ing their user bases with advertising and social 
commerce, so too is Foursquare. In one of its 
first efforts, Foursquare partnered with American 
Express to offer discounts to cardholders when they 
check in on their cell phone to certain shops and 
restaurants. Foursquare has continued to develop 
new location-based features, including Local 
Updates, which allow retailers to deliver location-
based updates to customers, Foursquare Ads, which 
are paid advertisements targeted by location and 
by prior behavior, Check-In Retargeting, which uses 
location and behavioral data to retarget ads to users 
on third-party Web sites, and Post Check-In Units, 
which serve advertisements to users after checking 
in with the Foursquare app. In 2015, Foursquare 
launched Pinpoint, an advertising product that 
allows marketers unprecedented ability to target 
users based on its accumulated historical location 
data. Pinpoint has the ability to filter out inaccu-
rate data and can even reach mobile users without 
the Foursquare app. Brands interested in Pinpoint 
include Coors, FedEx, Jaguar Land Rover, Olive 
Garden, and Samsung. 
In 2015, Foursquare’s main focus is to con-
tinue on a path to profitability by expanding and 
monetizing its trove of location data. Analysts 
estimated that Foursquare earned $15 to $20 
million in 2013, a significant increase over the $2 
million it earned in 2012, and in 2014 and 2015, 
Foursquare’s revenue has continued to double on 
a year-to-year basis. In 2014, Foursquare struck 
a multiyear data licensing agreement with Micro-
soft, which may use the data to customize Bing on 
a user-by-user basis with specific search results 
and advertisements based on their location data. 
In 2015, Foursquare has continued these efforts, 
partnering with Twitter to provide location-based 
tagging features on tweets, which enables users to 
tag tweets with their precise location. Foursquare 
has also partnered with Google, Yahoo, and Pin-
terest to provide location-based functions and to 
share location data, increasing the richness and 
accuracy of its own data in the process.
In 2014, Foursquare made a major change to 
its business model, splitting its app into two sep-
arate apps with different focuses. Its redesigned 
Foursquare app became a recommender system 

	
E - c o m m e r c e  B u s i n e s s  M o d e l s  	 
327
using passive location tracking to offer suggestions 
to users for where to eat or visit. A separate app, 
Swarm, absorbed Foursquare’s check-in feature. 
CEO Crowley envisions the new Foursquare app 
as a service that lets you know what places you 
might enjoy when you travel somewhere new. The 
redesigned app asks the user to identify things he 
or she likes, known as “tastes,” from over 10,000 
possibilities (ranging from barbecue to museums to 
board games), and then provides recommendations. 
Rather than earn badges, users are encouraged to 
add tips to work toward becoming an expert. Many 
loyal Foursquare users were driven away by the 
change, particularly Swarm users, who missed many 
of the old app’s lighthearted, collectible elements. 
In 2015, the company added many of those old 
features back to Swarm, such as status levels, may-
orships, and leaderboards, awards offered to users 
with the most check-ins at a particular location. 
As the popularity of location-based services like 
Foursquare has grown, so too have concerns about 
privacy. Privacy advocates point out that many apps 
have no privacy policy, that most of the popular apps 
transmit location data to their developers, after 
which the information is not well controlled, and 
that these services are creating a situation where 
government, marketers, creditors, and telecommuni-
cations firms will end up knowing nearly everything 
about citizens, including their whereabouts. 
As a case in point, in April 2012, Four-
square was hit by a privacy landmine when an app 
called Girls Around Me surfaced that used Four-
square’s application programming interface to 
show Facebook photos of women currently 
checked in around a particular neighborhood. 
Foursquare quickly shut down the app and 
shortly thereafter made changes to its API to elim-
inate the ability of users to see strangers checked 
into a venue without being checked into the same 
place themselves. Illustrating the continuing issues 
Foursquare faces on the privacy front, the version 
of its mobile app introduced in June 2012 allowed 
users to see all of their friends’ check-ins from the 
prior two weeks. Many users may not truly under-
stand how much of their location history is available 
to their friends. One advantage Foursquare does 
have, though, is that many of its users are actually 
interested in having their location tracked and their 
data collected – users are less likely to revolt when 
they find that Foursquare is collecting and sharing 
their data.
The redesigned Foursquare and Swarm apps 
also continue to raise privacy concerns. The Four-
square app tracks a user’s location even when the 
app is closed. Instead, by default, the app auto-
matically provides Foursquare with the phone’s 
GPS coordinates any time the phone is turned on, 
unless the user specifically opts out of such track-
ing. In contrast, Facebook’s Nearby Friends feature 
requires users to opt in. Persistent location track-
ing of this sort further enhances the value of Four-
square’s location data. Foursquare claims that the 
services it provides are a fair trade for the data it 
collects; privacy experts are concerned that tracking 
is always on by default, and that users cannot delete 
archived location data from Foursquare’s servers.

Market Opportunity
The term market opportunity refers to the company’s intended marketspace (i.e., 
an area of actual or potential commercial value) and the overall potential financial 
opportunities available to the firm in that marketspace. The market opportunity is 
usually divided into smaller market niches. The realistic market opportunity is defined 
by the revenue potential in each of the market niches where you hope to compete.
For instance, let’s assume you are analyzing a software training company that 
creates online software-learning systems for sale to businesses. The overall size of 
the software training market for all market segments is approximately €56 billion. 
The overall market can be broken down, however, into two major market segments: 
instructor-led training products, which comprise about 70% of the market (€39.2 billion 
in revenue), and computer-based training, which accounts for 30% (€16.8 billion). 
There are further market niches within each of those major market segments, such 
as the FT 500 computer-based training market and the small business computer-based 
training market. Because the firm is a start-up firm, it cannot compete effectively in 
the large business, computer-based training market (about €12 billion). Large brand-
name training firms dominate this niche. The start-up firm’s real market opportunity 
is to sell to the thousands of small business firms that spend about €4.8 billion on 
computer-based software training. This is the size of the firm’s realistic market oppor-
tunity (see Figure 5.2).
Competitive Environment
A firm’s competitive environment refers to the other companies selling similar 
products and operating in the same marketspace. It also refers to the presence of 
substitute products and potential new entrants to the market, as well as the power 
of customers and suppliers over your business. We discuss the firm’s environment

later in the chapter. The competitive environment for a company is influenced by 
several factors: how many competitors are active, how large their operations are, 
what the market share of each competitor is, how profitable these firms are, and 
how they price their products.
Firms typically have both direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors 
are companies that sell very similar products and services into the same market 
segment. For example, Priceline and Travelocity, both of whom sell discount airline 
tickets online, are direct competitors because both companies sell identical prod-
ucts—cheap tickets. Indirect competitors are companies that may be in different 
industries but still compete indirectly because their products can substitute for one 
another. For instance, automobile manufacturers and airline companies operate in 
different industries, but they still compete indirectly because they offer consumers 
alternative means of transportation. CNN, a news outlet, is an indirect competitor of 
ESPN, not because they sell identical products, but because they both compete for 
consumers’ time online.
The existence of a large number of competitors in any one segment may be a 
sign that the market is saturated and that it may be difficult to become profitable. On 
the other hand, a lack of competitors could signal either an untapped market niche 
ripe for the picking, or a market that has already been tried without success because 
there is no money to be made. Analysis of the competitive environment can help you 
decide which it is.
Competitive Advantage
Firms achieve a competitive advantage when they can produce a superior product 
and/or bring the product to market at a lower price than most, or all, of their 
competitive advantage

C H A P T E R  5     E - c o m m e r c e  B u s i n e s s  S t r a t e g i e s
competitors (Porter, 1985). Firms also compete on scope. Some firms can develop 
global markets, while other firms can develop only a national or regional market. 
Firms that can provide superior products at the lowest cost on a global basis are truly 
advantaged.
Firms achieve competitive advantages because they have somehow been able to 
obtain differential access to the factors of production that are denied to their competi-
tors—at least in the short term (Barney, 1991). Perhaps the firm has been able to obtain 
very favorable terms from suppliers, shippers, or sources of labor. Or perhaps the firm 
has more experienced, knowledgeable, and loyal employees than any competitors. 
Maybe the firm has a patent on a product that others cannot imitate, or access to 
investment capital through a network of former business colleagues or a brand name 
and popular image that other firms cannot duplicate. An asymmetry exists whenever 
one participant in a market has more resources—financial backing, knowledge, infor-
mation, and/or power—than other participants. Asymmetries lead to some firms 
having an edge over others, permitting them to come to market with better products, 
faster than competitors, and sometimes at lower cost.
For instance, when Apple announced iTunes, a service offering legal, download-
able individual song tracks for 99 cents a track that would be playable on any digital 
device with iTunes software, the company had better-than-average odds of success 
simply because of Apple’s prior success with innovative hardware designs, and the 
large stable of music firms that Apple had meticulously lined up to support its online 
music catalog. Few competitors could match the combination of cheap, legal songs 
and powerful hardware to play them on.
One rather unique competitive advantage derives from being a first mover. A 
first-mover advantage is a competitive market advantage for a firm that results from 
being the first into a marketplace with a serviceable product or service. If first movers 
develop a loyal following or a unique interface that is difficult to imitate, they can 
sustain their first-mover advantage for long periods (Arthur, 1996). Amazon provides 
a good example. However, in the history of technology-driven business innovation, 
most first movers often lack the complementary resources needed to sustain their 
advantages, and often follower firms reap the largest rewards (Rigdon, 2000; Teece, 
1986). Indeed, many of the success stories we discuss in this book are those of com-
panies that were slow followers—businesses that gained knowledge from failure of 
pioneering firms and entered into the market late.
Some competitive advantages are called “unfair.” An unfair competitive advan-
tage occurs when one firm develops an advantage based on a factor that other firms 
cannot purchase (Barney, 1991). For instance, a brand name cannot be purchased and 
is in that sense an “unfair” advantage. Brands are built upon loyalty, trust, reliability, 
and quality. Once obtained, they are difficult to copy or imitate, and they permit firms 
to charge premium prices for their products.
In perfect markets, there are no competitive advantages or asymmetries because 
all firms have access to all the factors of production (including information and knowl-
edge) equally. However, real markets are imperfect, and asymmetries leading to 
competitive advantages do exist, at least in the short term. Most competitive 
asymmetry 
exists whenever one 
participant in a market has

advantages are short term, although some can be sustained for very long periods. But 
not forever. In fact, many respected brands fail every year. 
Companies are said to leverage their competitive assets when they use their 
competitive advantages to achieve more advantage in surrounding markets. For 
instance, Amazon’s move into the online grocery business leverages the company’s 
huge customer database and years of e-commerce experience. 
Market Strategy
No matter how tremendous a firm’s qualities, its marketing strategy and execution are 
often just as important. The best business concept, or idea, will fail if it is not properly 
marketed to potential customers.
Everything you do to promote your company’s products and services to potential 
customers is known as marketing. Market strategy is the plan you put together that 
details exactly how you intend to enter a new market and attract new customers.
For instance, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest have a social network marketing 
strategy that encourages users to post their content on the sites for free, build per-
sonal profile pages, contact their friends, and build a community. In these cases, the 
customer becomes part of the marketing staff!
Organizational Development
Although many entrepreneurial ventures are started by one visionary individual, it 
is rare that one person alone can grow an idea into a multi-million dollar company. 
In most cases, fast-growth companies—especially e-commerce businesses—need 
employees and a set of business procedures. In short, all firms—new ones in particu-
lar—need an organization to efficiently implement their business plans and strategies. 
Many e-commerce firms and many traditional firms that attempt an e-commerce 
strategy have failed because they lacked the organizational structures and supportive 
cultural values required to support new forms of commerce (Kanter, 2001).
Companies that hope to grow and thrive need to have a plan for organizational 
development that describes how the company will organize the work that needs to 
be accomplished. Typically, work is divided into functional departments, such as 
production, shipping, marketing, customer support, and finance. Jobs within these 
functional areas are defined, and then recruitment begins for specific job titles and 
responsibilities. Typically, in the beginning, generalists who can perform multiple 
tasks are hired. As the company grows, recruiting becomes more specialized. For 
instance, at the outset, a business may have one marketing manager. But after two or 
three years of steady growth, that one marketing position may be broken down into 
seven separate jobs done by seven individuals.
For instance, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar started an online auction site, accord-
ing to some sources, to help his girlfriend trade Pez dispensers with other collectors, 
but within a few months the volume of business had far exceeded what he alone could 
handle. So he began hiring people with more business experience to help out. Soon 
the company had many employees, departments, and managers who were responsible 
for overseeing the various aspects of the organization.

Management Team
Arguably, the single most important element of a business model is the management 
team responsible for making the model work. A strong management team gives a 
model instant credibility to outside investors, immediate market-specific knowledge, 
and experience in implementing business plans. A strong management team may not 
be able to salvage a weak business model, but the team should be able to change the 
model and redefine the business as it becomes necessary.
Eventually, most companies get to the point of having several senior executives 
or managers. How skilled managers are, however, can be a source of competitive 
advantage or disadvantage. The challenge is to find people who have both the experi-
ence and the ability to apply that experience to new situations.
To be able to identify good managers for a business start-up, first consider the 
kinds of experiences that would be helpful to a manager joining your company. What 
kind of technical background is desirable? What kind of supervisory experience is 
necessary? How many years in a particular function should be required? What job 
functions should be fulfilled first: marketing, production, finance, or operations? Espe-
cially in situations where financing will be needed to get a company off the ground, 
do prospective senior managers have experience and contacts for raising financing 
from outside investors? 
Table 5.3 summarizes the eight key elements of a business model and the key 
questions that must be answered in order to successfully develop each element.
RAISING CAPITAL
Raising capital is one of the most important functions for a founder of a start-up busi-
ness and its management team. Not having enough capital to operate effectively is a 
primary reason why so many start-up businesses fail. Many entrepreneurs initially 
“bootstrap” to get a business off the ground, using personal funds derived from savings,

credit card advances, home equity loans, or from family and friends. Funds of this 
type are often referred to as seed capital. Once such funds are exhausted, if the 
company is not generating enough revenue to cover operating costs, additional capital 
will be needed. Traditional sources of capital include incubators, commercial banks, 
angel investors, venture capital firms, and strategic partners. One of the most impor-
tant aspects of raising capital is the ability to boil down the elements of the company’s 
business plan into an elevator pitch, a short two-to-three minute (about the length 
of an elevator ride, giving rise to its name) presentation aimed at convincing investors 
to invest. Table 5.4 lists the key elements of an elevator pitch.
Incubators (sometimes also referred to as accelerators) such as Rocket Internet 
and Startupbootcamp (profiled in Chapter 1’s Insight on Business case) typically provide 
a small amount of funding, but more importantly, also provide an array of services to 
start-up companies that they select to participate in their programs, such as business, 
technical, and marketing assistance, as well as introductions to other sources of capital. 
Well-known European incubator programs include INiTs (Austria), Accelerace 
(Denmark), Numa (Le Camping) (France), and SeedRocket (Spain). 
Obtaining a loan from a commercial bank is often difficult for a start-up company 
without much revenue, but it may be worthwhile to investigate programs offered by 
microfinance programs provided by the European Union. The advantage of obtain-
ing capital in the form of a loan (debt) is that, although it must be repaid, it does not 
require an entrepreneur to give up any ownership of the company. 
Angel investors are typically wealthy individuals (or a group of individuals) who 
invest their own money in an exchange for an equity share in the stock in the business. 
In general, angel investors make smaller investments (typically €1 million or less) than 
venture capital firms, are interested in helping a company grow and succeed, and invest 
on relatively favorable terms compared to later stage investors. The first round of exter-
nal investment in a company is sometimes referred to as Series A financing.

Venture capital investors typically become more interested in a start-up company 
once it has begun attracting a large audience and generating some revenue, even if 
it is not profitable. Venture capital investors invest funds they manage for other 
investors such as investment banks, pension funds, insurance companies, or other 
businesses, and usually want to obtain a larger stake in the business and exercise 
more control over the operation of the business. Venture capital investors also typi-
cally want a well-defined “exit strategy,” such as a plan for an initial public offering 
or acquisition of the company by a more established business within a relatively short 
period of time (typically 3 to 7 years), that will enable them to obtain an adequate 
return on their investment. Venture capital investment often ultimately means that 
the founder(s) and initial investors will no longer control the company at some point 
in the future. 
Crowdfunding involves using the Internet to enable individuals to collectively 
contribute money to support a project. The concepts behind crowdfunding have 
been popularized by Kickstarter and Indiegogo (see the Insight on Business case, 
Crowdfunding Takes Off), but it was not possible to use them for equity investments 
in for-profit companies due to various laws and regulations. However, this is chang-
ing in the United States with the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012 and issuance of 
regulations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has enabled companies 
to use the Internet to solicit investors who meet certain requirements to invest in 
small and early-stage start-ups in exchange for stock. In Europe, the European Com-
mission has indicated an intention to support crowdfunding and in 2014 issued a 
report aimed at promoting understanding this form of financing at the EU level and 
laying the groundwork for possible future action. In 2015, the European Commission 
published a guide to crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises as part of its 
effort to inform citizens about both its benefits and risks (European Commission, 
2014; 2015).  
CATEGORIZING E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS: SOME DIFFICULTIES
There are many e-commerce business models, and more are being invented every 
day. The number of such models is limited only by the human imagination, and our 
list of different business models is certainly not exhaustive. However, despite the 
abundance of potential models, it is possible to identify the major generic types (and 
subtle variations) of business models that have been developed for the e-commerce 
arena and describe their key features. It is important to realize, however, that there is 
no one correct way to categorize these business models.
Our approach is to categorize business models according to the different major 
e-commerce sectors—B2C and B2B—in which they are utilized. You will note, however, 
that fundamentally similar business models may appear in more than one sector. For 
example, the business models of online retailers (often called e-tailers) and e-distribu-
tors are quite similar. However, they are distinguished by the market focus of the sector 
in which they are used. In the case of e-tailers in the B2C sector, the business model 
focuses on sales to the individual consumer, while in the case of the e-distributor, the 
business model focuses on sales to another business. Many companies use a variety of

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
CROWDFUNDING TAKES OFF
Think you have the next big idea 
but lack the resources to make it 
happen? Crowdfunding sites might 
be your best shot. Sites such as Kick-
starter, Indiegogo, RocketHub, and 
Crowdtilt have led the growth of crowdfund-
ing. A World Bank study predicts that capital 
raised via crowdfunding will exceed around €75 
billion by 2025. The Internet is the ideal medium 
for crowdfunding because it allows individuals 
and organizations in need of funds and potential 
backers to find one another around the globe. For 
instance, Kickstarter is available for projects in 14 
European countries, as well as the United States, 
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In the past 
year, Indiegogo has also focused on international 
growth, with international funding now accounting 
for over 30% of its funding activity.
How do sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo 
work? The idea is simple—an inventor, artist, or 
activist looking to raise money for a project uses 
the site to create a page for that project. People 
can pledge to support the project, but at Kick-
starter, money actually only changes hands once 
the project fully reaches its funding goal (other 
sites, such as Indiegogo and RocketHub, allow 
project creators to keep the money they raise even 
if they do not achieve their goal). The sites take 
a small commission, usually about 5%, on com-
pleted projects. Backers do not receive any own-
ership interest in the project, but typically receive 
some type of reward, often corresponding to the 
size of their contribution to the project.
Crowdfunding projects are diverse, ranging 
from inventions to art installations, movies, video 
games, and political action projects. All you need 
is an idea that captures the attention of the crowd 
and for which people are willing to contribute 
funds. Crowdfunding is quickly becoming a main-
stay in nearly all of these fields. For instance, in 
the United Kingdom, a company raised over £2.34 
million from over 12,000 backers for ZANO, an 
autonomous, intelligent, swarming, nano drone. 
In Australia, one of top projects that has been 
funded thus far is Ninja Sphere, a device that 
maps the locations of objects in the home, which 
has raised over $700,000 Australian dollars. 
In New Zealand, clothing company Opus Fresh 
raised over $165,000 New Zealand dollars for its 
merino clothing line, many times its initial target 
of $16,000.The applications for crowdfunding are 
limited only by the imagination.
Successful crowdfunding projects typically 
share some common elements. One of the most 
important is a clear and concise presentation of 
the idea, especially through the use of video. The 
crowdfunding campaign is in many ways similar 
to presenting a business plan, and should touch 
on the same eight elements of a business model, 
such as the project’s value proposition, its target 
market, and so on. A whole ecosystem of video 
producers, editors, and other services has sprung 
up to support crowdfunding projects. Not every 
crowdfunding project gets off the ground—Kick-
starter reports that only about 40% of its approx-
imately 207,000 projects thus far have reached 
their funding goals. Sometimes projects that do 
get off the ground simply flame out, disappointing 
their backers. Although this is no different than 
investing in stocks, Kickstarter has sought to ease 
concerns by improving communication with respect 
to the risk inherent in the projects posted on its 
site. For instance, it now requires fundraisers to 
disclose the risks associated with their project, and 

336	
	
C H A P T E R  5     E - c o m m e r c e  B u s i n e s s  S t r a t e g i e s
now requires photos of prototype products 
(instead of simply drawings, simulations, or 
renderings) for inventions.
There is also some worry that the lack of 
privacy involved in donating to crowdfunding sites 
has a negative effect on the process. Another 
common criticism is that those who need Kick-
starter the least, such as projects launched by 
established Hollywood actors and producers, are 
the ones benefitting the most. Kickstarter coun-
ters that a high-profile project draws attention to 
the site and helps lesser-known artists in their own 
fundraising efforts.
A new use of crowdfunding is to provide 
seed capital for startup companies. Under the 
JOBS Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2012, 
a company will be able to crowdfund up to $1 
million over a 12-month period. Many expect 
the use of crowdfunding for this purpose to sky-
rocket once regulations allowing it are fully 
implemented. However, some critics worry that 
there will be a steep learning curve and that a 
period of chaos is likely to ensue until all par-
ticipants (entrepreneurs, investors, crowdfund-
ing platforms, and regulators) become familiar 
with all the potential benefits and risks of equity 
crowdfunding. In Europe, the situation is more 
complicated. Although the European Commis-
sion is considering how best to promote equity 
crowdfunding, currently national laws in countries 
throughout Europe vary widely, with the United 
Kingdom, Italy, and France each taking their 
own unique approaches. In the United Kingdom, 
crowdfunding is regulated by the Financial 
Conduct Authority, which issued new rules in 
2014. Italy was one of the first European coun-
tries to regulate equity crowdfunding, and in 
2015 it updated and expanded those regulations 
to enlarge the category of companies that can 
be crowdfunded. In France, companies are able 
to raise up to €1 million via equity crowdfund-
ing without having to notify the French finan-
cial markets authority. In Europe, much of the 
crowdfunding still takes the form of peer-to-peer 
lending rather than equity investment. Some of 
the leading companies in this area include Zopa 
and Ratesetter. Funding Circle is also one of the 
biggest crowdfunding platforms in the United 
Kingdom, and has facilitated loans totalling 
more than £960 million since its launch in 2010. 
In October 2015, Funding Circle expanded into 
Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands in conjunc-
tion with its acquisition of Zencap. In Germany, 
Auxmoney is Germany’s largest credit market-
place and has facilitated more than 60,000 loans, 
worth more than €350 million, since its launch 
in 2013. In October 2015, Aegon Bank expanded 
its investment in Auxmoney, committing €150 
million, which Auxomoney hopes to use to reach 
a larger pool of consumers.

different business models as they attempt to extend into as many areas of e-commerce 
as possible. We look at B2C business models in Section 5.2 and B2B business models 
in Section 5.3.
A business’s technology platform is sometimes confused with its business model. 
For instance, “mobile e-commerce” refers to the use of mobile devices and cellular and 
wide area networks to support a variety of business models. Commentators sometimes 
confuse matters by referring to mobile e-commerce as a distinct business model, which 
it is not. All of the basic business models we discuss below can be implemented on 
both the traditional Internet/Web and mobile platforms. Likewise, although they are 
sometimes referred to as such, social e-commerce and local e-commerce are not busi-
ness models in and of themselves, but rather subsectors of B2C and B2B e-commerce 
in which different business models can operate. 
You will also note that some companies use multiple business models. For 
instance, Amazon has multiple business models: it is an e-retailer, content provider, 
market creator, e-commerce infrastructure provider, and more. eBay is a market 
creator in the B2C and C2C e-commerce sectors, using both the traditional Inter-
net/Web and mobile platforms, as well as an e-commerce infrastructure provider. 
Firms often seek out multiple business models as a way to leverage their brands, 
infrastructure investments, and assets developed with one business model into new 
business models. 
Finally, no discussion of e-commerce business models would be complete without 
mention of a group of companies whose business model is focused on providing the 
infrastructure necessary for e-commerce companies to exist, grow, and prosper. These 
are the e-commerce enablers. They provide the hardware, operating system software, 
networks and communications technology, applications software, Web design, consult-
ing services, and other tools required for e-commerce (see Table 5.5 on page 338). 
While these firms may not be conducting e-commerce per se (although in many 
instances, e-commerce in its traditional sense is in fact one of their sales channels), 
as a group they have perhaps profited the most from the development of e-commerce. 
We discuss many of these players in the following chapters.

Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, in which online businesses seek to reach 
individual consumers, is the most well-known and familiar type of e-commerce. Table

Online retail stores, often called e-tailers, come in all sizes, from giant Amazon to tiny 
local stores that have Web sites. E-tailers are similar to the typical bricks-and-mortar

the need to drive to the mall or store (Bellman, Lohse, and Johnson, 1999). The 
e-tail revenue model is product-based, with customers paying for the purchase of 
a particular item.
This sector, however, is extremely competitive. Because barriers to entry (the 
total cost of entering a new marketplace) into the e-tail market are low, tens of 
thousands of small e-tail shops have sprung up. Becoming profitable and surviving 
is very difficult, however, for e-tailers with no prior brand name or experience. The 
e-tailer’s challenge is differentiating its business from existing competitors. 
Companies that try to reach every online consumer are likely to deplete their 
resources quickly. Those that develop a niche strategy, clearly identifying their 
target market and its needs, are best prepared to make a profit. Keeping expenses 
low, selection broad, and inventory controlled is key to success in e-tailing, with 
inventory being the most difficult to gauge. Online retail is covered in more depth 
in Chapter 11.
COMMUNITY PROVIDER
Although community providers are not a new phenomenon, the Internet has made 
such sites for like-minded individuals to meet and converse much easier, without 
the limitations of geography and time to hinder participation. Community provid-
ers create an online environment where people with similar interests can transact 
(buy and sell goods); share interests, photos, videos; communicate with like-minded 
people; receive interest-related information; and even play out fantasies by adopting 
online personalities called avatars. The social network sites Facebook, LinkedIn, 
Twitter, and Pinterest, and hundreds of other smaller, niche sites all offer users 
community-building tools and services. 
The basic value proposition of community providers is to create a fast, conve-
nient, one-stop site where users can focus on their most important concerns and 
interests, share the experience with friends, and learn more about their own inter-
ests. Community providers typically rely on a hybrid revenue model that includes 
subscription fees, sales revenues, transaction fees, affiliate fees, and advertising fees 
from other firms that are attracted by a tightly focused audience.
Community providers make money from advertising and through affiliate 
relationships with retailers. Some of the oldest online communities are The Well, 
which provides a forum for technology and Internet-related discussions, and The 
Motley Fool, which provides financial advice, news, and opinions. The Well offers 
various membership plans ranging from $10 to $15 a month. Motley Fool supports 
itself through ads and selling products that start out “free” but turn into annual 
subscriptions. 
Consumers’ interest in communities is mushrooming. Community is, arguably, 
the fastest growing online activity. While many community sites have had a difficult 
time becoming profitable, many have succeeded over time, with advertising as their 
main source of revenue. Both the very large social network sites such as Facebook, 
Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as niche sites with smaller dedicated audiences, are

ideal marketing and advertising territories. Traditional online communities such as 
The Motley Fool and WebMD (which provides medical information to members) find 
that breadth and depth of knowledge at a site is an important factor. Community 
members frequently request knowledge, guidance, and advice. Lack of experienced 
personnel can severely hamper the growth of a community, which needs facilitators 
and managers to keep discussions on course and relevant. For the newer community 
social network sites, the most important ingredients of success appear to be ease and 
flexibility of use, and a strong customer value proposition. For instance, Facebook 
leapfrogged over its rival MySpace by encouraging the development of third-party 
revenue-producing applications. 
Online communities benefit significantly from offline word-of-mouth, viral 
marketing. Online communities tend to reflect offline relationships. When your 
friends say they have a profile on Facebook, and ask you to “friend” them, you are 
encouraged to build your own online profile.
CONTENT PROVIDER
Content providers distribute information content, such as digital video, music, 
photos, text, and artwork. Content providers can make money via a variety of different 
revenue models, including advertising, subscription fees, and sales of digital goods. 
For instance, in the case of Rhapsody, a monthly subscription fee provides users with 
access to thousands of music tracks. Other content providers, such as the Wall Street 
Journal online newspaper, Harvard Business Review, and many others, charge custom-
ers for content downloads in addition to, or in place of, a subscription fee.
Of course, not all online content providers charge for their information: just 
look at the Web sites for CBSSports, CIO, CNN, and the online versions of many 
newspapers and magazines. Users can access news and information at these sites 
without paying a cent, although sometimes they may be required to register as a 
member. These popular sites make money in other ways, such as through advertis-
ing and partner promotions on the site. Increasingly, however, “free content” may 
be limited to headlines and text, whereas premium content—in-depth articles or 
videos—is sold for a fee.
Generally, the key to becoming a successful content provider is owning the 
content. Traditional owners of copyrighted content—publishers of books and news-
papers, broadcasters of radio and television content, music publishers, and movie 
studios—have powerful advantages over newcomers who simply offer distribution 
channels and must pay for content, often at very high prices. 
Some content providers, however, do not own content, but syndicate (aggregate) 
and then distribute content produced by others. Syndication is a major variation of 
the standard content provider model. Aggregators, who collect information from a 
wide variety of sources and then add value to that information through post-aggrega-
tion services, are another variation. For instance, Shopzilla collects information on 
the prices of thousands of goods online, analyzes the information, and presents users 
with tables showing the range of prices and links to the sites where the products can

advertisers who advertise on its site.
Any e-commerce start-up that intends to make money by providing content is 
likely to face difficulties unless it has a unique information source that others cannot 
access. For the most part, this business category is dominated by traditional content 
providers. The Insight on Technology case, Online Music: Battle of the Titans and Lillipu-
tians, discusses how changes in Internet technology are driving the development of 
new business models in the online content market by Internet titans Apple, Google, 
and Amazon.
Online content is discussed in further depth in Chapter 9. 
PORTAL
Portals such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL offer users powerful search tools as well as an 
integrated package of content and services, such as news, e-mail, instant messaging, 
calendars, shopping, music downloads, video streaming, and more, all in one place. 
Initially, portals sought to be viewed as “gateways” to the Internet. Today, however, 
the portal business model is to be a destination site. They are marketed as places 
where consumers will hopefully stay a long time to read news, find entertainment, 
and meet other people (think of destination resorts). Portals do not sell anything 
directly—or so it seems—and in that sense they can present themselves as unbiased. 
Portals generate revenue primarily by charging advertisers for ad placement, collecting 
referral fees for steering customers to other sites, and charging for premium 
services. 
Although there are numerous portal/search engine sites, the top five sites (Google, 
Microsoft (Bing), Yahoo, Ask, and AOL) in the United States gather more than 95% 
of U.S. search engine traffic because of their superior brand recognition (comScore, 
2015). Many of the top sites were among the first to appear on the Web and therefore 
had first-mover advantages. Being first confers advantage because customers come to 
trust a reliable provider and experience switching costs if they change to late arrivals 
in the market. By garnering a large chunk of the marketplace, first movers—just like 
a single telephone network—can offer customers access to commonly shared ideas, 
standards, and experiences (something called network externalities that we describe in 
later chapters).
The traditional portals have company: Facebook and other social network sites 
are now the initial start or home page (portal) for millions of Internet users. 
Yahoo, AOL, and others like them are considered to be horizontal portals because 
they define their marketspace to include all users of the Internet. Vertical portals 
(sometimes called vortals) attempt to provide similar services as horizontal portals, but 
are focused around a particular subject matter or market segment. For instance, Sailnet 
focuses on the world’s sailing community, and provides sailing news, articles, discussion 
groups, free e-mail, and a retail store. Although the total number of vortal users may 
be much lower than the number of portal users, if the market segment is attractive 
enough, advertisers are willing to pay a premium in order to reach a targeted audience. 
Also, visitors to specialized niche vortals spend more money than the average Yahoo 
portal 
offers users powerful 
search tools as well as an 
integrated package of 
content and services all in 
one place

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
ONLINE MUSIC: BATTLE OF THE TITANS AND 
LILLIPUTIANS
Business models are closely related 
to the technologies available to 
produce and distribute products and 
services. Nowhere is this more apparent 
than the recorded music business, whose founda-
tions since the early 20th century have been based 
on the technology on hand, from sheet music, to 
vinyl records, tape cassettes, CDs, and now, the 
Internet and mobile platform. The music indus-
try provides an excellent example of how technol-
ogy, along with customer preferences, can, in a 
very short period, radically alter the competitive 
landscape. 
Thus far, there have been three basic busi-
ness models in the online music industry. The first 
model involved making illegal digital copies of 
copyrighted music available to consumers for a 
fee, or for free with advertising. From 1995 to 
2000, many firms, such as Napster, sprang up to 
use this model, but most were eventually shut 
down, with their owners put in jail or heavily 
fined. Still, illegal sharing of music files on peer-
to-peer (P2P) and BitTorrent networks contin-
ued to grow, although at a much slower pace. The 
technologies underlying this business model were 
MP3 files, PC hard drives, portable MP3 players 
that could easily play these files, online databases 
where they could be stored, and the Internet to 
share them. 
In 2003, Apple introduced a legitimate alter-
native to illegal downloading: the iTunes store, 
where consumers could download digital copies 
of individual songs for 99 cents, or entire albums 
for $12, and play them on their PCs and the newly 
introduced iPod portable player. Steve Jobs sold 
this model to the music industry by arguing that 
it was the industry’s only hope to survive the 
onslaught of illegal sharing and selling of stolen 
music. The technologies that enabled this business 
included higher speed Internet services, the iPod 
player, and advances in digital storage that greatly 
reduced the cost of storage. Those technologies 
made it possible and economical for Apple to store 
millions of songs and distribute them over the 
Internet to local hard drives on PCs and iPods that 
could store thousands of songs. The introduction of 
the iPhone in 2007 strengthened the digital down-
load model, allowing customers to purchase from 
mobile devices and to use iTunes apps to access 
their music anytime, using any device. Amazon 
launched Amazon Music in 2007 and Google fol-
lowed with its Google Play Music in 2011. This 
model was strengthened further in 2011 by the 
introduction of cloud storage (Apple’s iCloud), a 
digital online storage locker. 
By 2014, iTunes had 800 million customers, 
43 million songs available, and had sold 35 billion 
tracks! Apple derived an estimated $1.8 billion 
in revenue from music in 2014. Today, iTunes 
dominates the digital download model, with a 
70% market share. The rest of the digital down-
load model market belongs to Amazon Music and 
Google Play Music. In 2015, the digital download 
model accounts for about $2.5 billion (57% of all 
digital music sales and 37% of all recorded music 
sales for the entire industry in the United States). 
By this time, sales of physical CDs had been cut 
in half, and music industry revenue by a similar 
amount. The industry has survived, but is only half 
of its former size. 
However, all is not rosy for the download to 
own/store-in-the-cloud iTunes business model. It 
is being challenged by a very different business 
model: music streaming services like Pandora

(2005), Spotify (2008), Rdio (2010), 
Deezer (2007), and Vevo (2009). These are 
the Lilliputians of the digital music story: start-
ups, with venture money, weak revenue models, no 
profits, but lots of consumer interest. 
With streaming music services, consumers do 
not purchase music, but instead purchase access 
to millions of songs when and where they want, 
on any device. These streaming services typically 
use an ad-supported freemium model to attract 
early adopters, and then entice them to become 
paying subscribers. This model had been tried 
before by firms such as Rhapsody in 1999 without 
much success because, at that time, few custom-
ers wanted to pay for music and few owned MP3 
music players. 
Today, streaming services have proved to be 
very popular although not necessarily profitable 
(as yet). Ad-supported and subscriber stream-
ing revenues in 2014 totaled $1.8 billion, 42% 
of all digital music sales, and 27% of all music 
sales. Sales of digital downloads first began 
falling in 2012, and in 2015, are decreasing 
by 7% annually, while streaming services are 
growing at a 30% rate. The digital music game 
has changed. 
The Internet Titans could not ignore the bal-
looning customer demand for streaming music. 
In 2012, Google launched its Google Play Music 
unlimited streaming service that allows users 
to upload their MP3 files to Google servers for 
$9.99 a month (but not download new MP3s). In 
2014, Amazon launched its Amazon Prime music 
service, free for Amazon Prime subscribers. 
In 2014, Apple purchased Beats Music for $3 
billion, a signal that Apple was getting serious about 
streaming music. Beats had developed its own music 
streaming service. In June 2015, Apple launched 
Apple Music, a streaming-only music service that 
is free for three months and then $9.99 a month 
after that. Apple and music industry executives 
claimed that the new service would restore profit-
ability to the music industry by bringing the support 
of the Apple brand to a music streaming service that 
would provide more value for consumers. Where 
Pandora, Spotify, and many other streaming ser-
vices still struggle, Apple hopes to prosper. 
Many musicians remain skeptical that the 
streaming services will be good for them. In June 
2015, Taylor Swift, one of the most popular 
recording artists in recent memory, wrote an 
open letter to Apple objecting to Apple Music’s 
plan to not pay royalties for the first three months 
of the service. She withdrew her popular album 
“1989” from the service. Taylor Swift argued 
that Apple should not expect musicians to sub-
sidize customer acquisition costs for Apple’s new 
service, and that musicians didn’t ask Apple for 
free iPhones, so therefore Apple should not ask 
musicians for free music. A day later Eddy Cue, 
Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software 
and services, announced that Apple had decided 
to reverse course and agreed to pay artists and 
record labels their full royalty: 70% of the rev-
enues Apple collects. Swift agreed to have her 
music stream on Apple Music. In the end, there is 
no music without musicians. And they have their 
own business models.

visitor. Google and Ask can also be considered portals of a sort, but focus primarily 
on offering search and advertising services. They generate revenues primarily from 
search engine advertising sales and also from affiliate referral fees.
TRANSACTION BROKER
Companies that process transactions for consumers normally handled in person, by 
phone, or by mail are transaction brokers. The largest industries using this model 
are financial services, travel services, and job placement services. The online transac-
tion broker’s primary value propositions are savings of money and time. In addition, 
most transaction brokers provide timely information and opinions. Companies such 
as Monster offer job searchers a national marketplace for their talents and employers 
a national resource for that talent. Both employers and job seekers are attracted by 
the convenience and currency of information. Online stock brokers charge commis-
sions that are considerably less than traditional brokers, with many offering substantial 
deals, such as cash and a certain number of free trades, to lure new customers.
Given rising consumer interest in financial planning and the stock market, the 
market opportunity for online transaction brokers appears to be large. However, while 
millions of customers have shifted to online brokers, some are still wary about switch-
ing from their traditional broker who provides personal advice and a brand name. 
Fears of privacy invasion and the loss of control over personal financial information 
also contribute to market resistance. Consequently, the challenge for online brokers 
is to overcome consumer fears by emphasizing the security and privacy measures 
in place, and, like physical banks and brokerage firms, providing a broad range of 
financial services and not just stock trading. This industry is covered in greater depth 
in Chapter 11.
Transaction brokers make money each time a transaction occurs. Each stock 
trade, for example, nets the company a fee, based on either a flat rate or a sliding scale 
related to the size of the transaction. Attracting new customers and encouraging them 
to trade frequently are the keys to generating more revenue for these companies. 
Travel sites generate commissions from travel books and job sites generate listing fees 
from employers up front, rather than charging a fee when a position is filled.
MARKET CREATOR
Market creators build a digital environment in which buyers and sellers can meet, 
display and search for products and services, and establish prices. Prior to the Internet 
and the Web, market creators relied on physical places to establish a market. Beginning 
with the medieval marketplace and extending to today’s New York Stock Exchange, a 
market has meant a physical space for transacting business. There were few private 
digital network marketplaces prior to the Web. The Web changed this by making it 
possible to separate markets from physical space. Prime examples are Priceline, which 
allows consumers to set the price they are willing to pay for various travel accommoda-
tions and other products (sometimes referred to as a reverse auction), and eBay, the 
online auction site utilized by both businesses and consumers. Market creators make 
money by either charging a percentage of every transaction made, or charging mer-
chants for access to the market.

For example, eBay’s auction business model is to create a digital environment 
for buyers and sellers to meet, agree on a price, and transact. This is different from 
transaction brokers who actually carry out the transaction for their customers, acting 
as agents in larger markets. At eBay, the buyers and sellers are their own agents. Each 
sale on eBay nets the company a commission based on the percentage of the item’s 
sales price, in addition to a listing fee. eBay is one of the few e-commerce companies 
that has been profitable virtually from the beginning. Why? One answer is that eBay 
has no inventory or production costs. It is simply a middleman.
The market opportunity for market creators is potentially vast, but only if the firm 
has the financial resources and marketing plan to attract sufficient sellers and buyers 
to the marketplace. As of June 30, 2015, eBay had more than 157 million active buyers, 
and this makes for an efficient market (eBay Inc., 2015). There are many sellers and 
buyers for each type of product, sometimes for the same product, for example, laptop 
computer models. Many other digital auctions have sprung up in smaller, more special-
ized vertical market segments such as jewelry and automobiles.
Uber, Airbnb, and Lyft are another example of the market creator business model 
(although they could also be categorized as service providers). On-demand service 
companies (also sometimes called sharing economy companies) are market creators 
that have developed online platforms that allow people to sell services, such as trans-
portation or spare rooms, in a marketplace that operates in the cloud and relies on the 
Web or smartphone apps to conduct transactions. It is important to note that, although 
referred to as sharing economy or mesh economy companies, these companies do not 
in fact share resources. Users of these services are either selling something or  buying 
something, and the companies produce revenue by extracting fees for each transac-
tion. However, they do unlock the economic value in spare resources (personal cars 
and rooms) that might otherwise have been lost. In the process they have created huge 
online markets. For instance, Uber (founded in 2009) currently operates in hundreds 
of cities in 60 countries around the world. Airbnb, founded in 2008, operates in more 
than 190 countries and 34,000 cities, lists over 1.5 million rooms available for rent, 
and has had over 40 million people use its services to book a room. Airbnb has raised 
around $2.3 billion in funding thus far and is valued at over $25 billion; Uber has raised 
$8.2 billion and is valued at more than $50 billion! 
SERVICE PROVIDER 
While e-tailers sell products online, service providers offer services online. There’s 
been an explosion in online services that is often unrecognized. Photo sharing, video 
sharing, and user-generated content (in blogs and social network sites) are all services 
provided to customers. Google has led the way in developing online applications such 
as Google Maps, Google Docs, and Gmail. Other personal services such as online 
medical bill management, financial and pension planning, and travel recommendation 
are showing strong growth. 
Service providers use a variety of revenue models. Some charge a fee, or monthly 
subscriptions, while others generate revenue from other sources, such as through 
advertising and by collecting personal information that is useful in direct marketing. 
Many service providers employ a freemium revenue model, in which some basic 
services are free, but others require the payment of additional charges. Much like 
service provider
offers services online

retailers who trade products for cash, service providers trade knowledge, expertise, 
and capabilities for revenue.
Obviously, some services cannot be provided online. For example, dentistry, 
plumbing, and car repair cannot be completed via the Internet. However, online 
arrangements can be made for these services. Online service providers may offer 
computer services, such as data storage (Dropbox and Carbonite), provide legal ser-
vices (RocketLawyer), or accounting or bookkeeping services (Wave, Bench). Grocery 
shopping sites such as FreshDirect and Peapod are also providing services.1 To compli-
cate matters a bit, most financial transaction brokers (described previously) provide 
services such as college tuition and pension planning. Travel brokers also provide 
vacation-planning services, not just transactions with airlines and hotels. Indeed, 
mixing services with your products is a powerful business strategy pursued by many 
hard-goods companies (for example, warranties are services). 
The basic value proposition of service providers is that they offer consumers 
valuable, convenient, time-saving, and low-cost alternatives to traditional service 
providers or provide services that are truly unique. Where else can you search billions 
of Web pages, or share photos with as many people instantly? Research has found, for 
instance, that a major factor in predicting online buying behavior is time starvation. 
Time-starved people tend to be busy professionals who work long hours and simply 
do not have the time to pick up packages, buy groceries, send photos, or visit with 
financial planners (Bellman, Lohse, and Johnson, 1999). The market opportunity 
for service providers is as large as the variety of services that can be provided and 
potentially is much larger than the market opportunity for physical goods. We live 
in a service-based economy and society; witness the growth of fast-food restaurants, 
package delivery services, and wireless cellular phone services. Consumers’ increas-
ing demand for convenience products and services bodes well for current and future 
online service providers.
Marketing of service providers must allay consumer fears about hiring a vendor 
online, as well as build confidence and familiarity among current and potential cus-
tomers. Building confidence and trust is critical for service providers just as it is for 
retail product merchants.

MAJOR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS (B2B) BUSINESS 
MODELS 
In Chapter 1, we noted that business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, in which busi-
nesses sell to other businesses, is more than 10 times the size of B2C e-commerce, 
even though most of the public attention has focused on B2C. For instance, it is 
estimated that revenues for all types of B2B e-commerce worldwide will total around 
€14.2  trillion in 2015, compared to about €1.96 trillion for retail and travel-related 
1	FreshDirect and other e-commerce businesses can also be classified as online retailers insofar as 
they warehouse commonly purchased items and make a profit based on the spread between their buy 
and sell prices.

B2C e-commerce. Clearly, most of the dollar revenues in e-commerce involve B2B 
e-commerce. Much of this activity is unseen and unknown to the average consumer. 
Table 5.7 lists the major business models utilized in the B2B arena.
E-DISTRIBUTOR
Companies that supply products and services directly to individual businesses are 
e-distributors. W.W. Grainger, for example, is the largest distributor of maintenance, 
repair, and operations (MRO) supplies. In the past, Grainger relied on catalog sales 
and physical distribution centers in metropolitan areas. Its catalog of equipment went 
online in 1995. Today, Grainger’s e-commerce platform, which includes Web sites and 
mobile apps, produces about $2.8 billion in sales (about 30% of its total revenue) for 
the company. 
E-distributors are owned by one company seeking to serve many customers. 
However, as with exchanges (described on the next page), critical mass is a factor. With 
e-distributors, the more products and services a company makes available on its site, 
the more attractive that site is to potential customers. One-stop shopping is always 
preferable to having to visit numerous sites to locate a particular part or product.
E-PROCUREMENT
Just as e-distributors provide products to other companies, e-procurement firms 
create and sell access to digital markets. Firms such as Ariba, for instance, have created 
software that helps large firms organize their procurement process by creating mini-
digital markets for a single firm. Ariba creates custom-integrated online catalogs

(where supplier firms can list their offerings) for purchasing firms. On the sell side, 
Ariba helps vendors sell to large purchasers by providing software to handle catalog 
creation, shipping, insurance, and finance. Both the buy and sell side software is 
referred to generically as “value chain management” software.
B2B service providers make money through transaction fees, fees based on the 
number of workstations using the service, or annual licensing fees. They offer purchas-
ing firms a sophisticated set of sourcing and supply chain management tools that 
permit firms to reduce supply chain costs. In the software world, firms such as Ariba 
are sometimes also called Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
providers; they are able to offer firms much lower costs of software by achieving scale 
economies. Scale economies are efficiencies that result from increasing the size of a 
business, for instance, when large, fixed-cost production systems (such as factories or 
software systems) can be operated at full capacity with no idle time. In the case of 
software, the marginal cost of a digital copy of a software program is nearly zero, and 
finding additional buyers for an expensive software program is exceptionally profitable. 
This is much more efficient than having every firm build its own supply chain man-
agement system, and it permits firms such as Ariba to specialize and offer their soft-
ware to firms at a cost far less than the cost of developing it.
EXCHANGES
Exchanges have garnered most of the B2B attention and early funding because of their 
potential market size even though today they are a small part of the overall B2B 
picture. An exchange is an independent digital marketplace where hundreds of sup-
pliers meet a smaller number of very large commercial purchasers (Kaplan and 
Sawhney, 2000). Exchanges are owned by independent, usually entrepreneurial start-
up firms whose business is making a market, and they generate revenue by charging 
a commission or fee based on the size of the transactions conducted among trading 
parties. They usually serve a single vertical industry such as steel, polymers, or alu-
minum, and focus on the exchange of direct inputs to production and short-term 
contracts or spot purchasing. For buyers, B2B exchanges make it possible to gather 
information, check out suppliers, collect prices, and keep up to date on the latest 
happenings all in one place. Sellers, on the other hand, benefit from expanded access 
to buyers. The greater the number of sellers and buyers, the lower the sales cost and 
the higher the chances of making a sale. The ease, speed, and volume of transactions 
are summarily referred to as market liquidity.
In theory, exchanges make it significantly less expensive and time-consuming to 
identify potential suppliers, customers, and partners, and to do business with each 
other. As a result, they can lower transaction costs—the cost of making a sale or 
purchase. Exchanges can also lower product costs and inventory-carrying costs—the 
cost of keeping a product on hand in a warehouse. In reality, as will be discussed in 
Chapter 12, B2B exchanges have had a difficult time convincing thousands of suppliers 
to move into singular digital markets where they face powerful price competition, and 
an equally difficult time convincing businesses to change their purchasing behavior 
away from trusted long-term trading partners. As a result, the number of exchanges 
has fallen significantly.

INDUSTRY CONSORTIA
Industry consortia are industry-owned vertical marketplaces that serve specific indus-
tries, such as the automobile, aerospace, chemical, floral, or logging industries. In 
contrast, horizontal marketplaces sell specific products and services to a wide range of 
companies. Vertical marketplaces supply a smaller number of companies with prod-
ucts and services of specific interest to their industry, while horizontal marketplaces 
supply companies in different industries with a particular type of product and service, 
such as marketing-related, financial, or computing services. For example, SupplyOn, 
founded in 2000 and owned by industrial giants Bosch (one of the world’s largest 
suppliers of automotive components), Continental (a leading automotive manufactur-
ing company), and Schaeffler (a global manufacturer of various types of bearings), 
among others, provides a shared supply chain collaboration platform for companies 
in various manufacturing industries. In 2015, in addition to its shareholders, its custom-
ers include Airbus, BMW, BorgWarner, Siemens, Thales, and many other major global 
manufacturing companies. 
Industry consortia have tended to be more successful than independent exchanges 
in part because they are sponsored by powerful, deep-pocketed industry players, 
and also because they strengthen traditional purchasing behavior rather than seek 
to transform it.
PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS
Private industrial networks constitute about 75% of all B2B expenditures by large 
firms and far exceed the expenditures for all forms of Net marketplaces. A private 
industrial network (sometimes referred to as a private trading exchange or PTX) 
is a digital network designed to coordinate the flow of communications among firms 
engaged in business together. The network is owned by a single large purchasing 
firm. Participation is by invitation only to trusted long-term suppliers of direct 
inputs. These networks typically evolve out of a firm’s own enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system, and are an effort to include key suppliers in the firm’s own 
business decision making. For instance, Walmart operates one of the largest private 
industrial networks in the world for its suppliers, who on a daily basis use Walmart’s 
network to monitor the sales of their goods, the status of shipments, and the actual 
inventory level of their goods. 
We discuss the nuances of B2B e-commerce in more detail in Chapter 12.

HOW E-COMMERCE CHANGES BUSINESS: STRATEGY, 
STRUCTURE, AND PROCESS 
Now that you have a clear grasp of the variety of business models used by e-commerce 
firms, you also need to understand how e-commerce has changed the business envi-
ronment in the last decade, including industry structures, business strategies, and 
industry and firm operations (business processes and value chains). We return to 
these concepts throughout the book as we explore the e-commerce phenomenon. In 
general, the Internet is an open standards system available to all players, and this

fact inherently makes it easy for new competitors to enter the marketplace and offer 
substitute products or channels of delivery. The Internet tends to intensify competi-
tion. Because information becomes available to everyone, the Internet inherently 
shifts power to buyers who can quickly discover the lowest-cost provider. On the other 
hand, the Internet presents many new opportunities for creating value, for branding 
products and charging premium prices, and for enlarging an already powerful offline 
physical business such as Walmart or Sears.
Recall Table 1.2 in Chapter 1 that describes the truly unique features of e-com-
merce technology. Table 5.8 suggests some of the implications of each unique feature 
for the overall business environment—industry structure, business strategies, and 
operations.

HOW E-COMMERCE INFLUENCES INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
E-commerce has many impacts on industry structure and competitive conditions. From the perspective of a 
single firm, these changes can have negative or positive implications depending on the situation. In some 
cases, an entire industry can be disrupted, while at the same time, a new industry is born. Individual firms 
can either prosper or be devastated. 
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
E-commerce changes industry structure, in some industries more than others. Indus-
try structure refers to the nature of the players in an industry and their relative 
bargaining power. An industry’s structure is characterized by five forces: rivalry among 
existing competitors, the threat of substitute products, barriers to entry into the industry, 
the bargaining power of suppliers, and the bargaining power of buyers (Porter, 1985). 
When you describe an industry’s structure, you are describing the general business 
environment in an industry and the overall profitability of doing business in that 
environment. E-commerce has the potential to change the relative strength of these 
competitive forces (see Figure 5.3).

When you consider a business model and its potential long-term profitability, you 
should always perform an industry structural analysis. An industry structural analy-
sis is an effort to understand and describe the nature of competition in an industry, 
the nature of substitute products, the barriers to entry, and the relative strength of 
consumers and suppliers.
E-commerce can affect the structure and dynamics of industries in very different 
ways. Consider the recorded music industry, an industry that has experienced signifi-
cant change because of e-commerce. Historically, the major record companies owned 
the exclusive rights to the recorded music of various artists. With the entrance into the 
marketplace of substitute providers such as Napster and Kazaa, millions of consum-
ers began to use the Internet to bypass traditional music labels and their distributors 
entirely. In the travel industry, entirely new middlemen such as Travelocity entered 
the market to compete with traditional travel agents. After Travelocity, Expedia, 
CheapTickets, and other travel services demonstrated the power of e-commerce mar-
keting for airline tickets, the actual owners of the airline seats—the major airlines—
banded together to form their own Internet outlet for tickets, Orbitz, for direct sales 
to consumers (although ultimately selling the company to a private investor group). 
Clearly, e-commerce creates new industry dynamics that can best be described as the 
give and take of the marketplace, the changing fortunes of competitors.
Yet, in other industries, e-commerce has strengthened existing players. In the chemi-
cal and automobile industries, e-commerce is being used effectively by manufacturers to 
strengthen their traditional distributors. In these industries, e-commerce technology has 
not fundamentally altered the competitive forces—bargaining power of suppliers, barriers 
to entry, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes, or rivalry among competi-
tors—within the industry. Hence, each industry is different and you need to examine 
each one carefully to understand the impacts of e-commerce on competition and strategy.
New forms of distribution created by new market entrants can completely change 
the competitive forces in an industry. For instance, consumers gladly substituted free 
access to Wikipedia for a $699 set of World Book encyclopedias, or a $40 DVD, radi-
cally changing the competitive forces in the encyclopedia industry. As we describe in 
Chapter 9, the content industries of newspapers, books, movies, games, and television 
have been transformed by the emergence of new distribution platforms. 
Inter-firm rivalry (competition) is one area of the business environment where 
e-commerce technologies have had an impact on most industries. In general, 
e-commerce has increased price competition in nearly all markets. It has been relatively 
easy for existing firms to adopt e-commerce technology and attempt to use it to achieve 
competitive advantage vis-à-vis rivals. For instance, e-commerce inherently changes the 
scope of competition from local and regional to national and global. Because consumers 
have access to global price information, e-commerce produces pressures on firms to 
compete by lowering prices (and lowering profits). On the other hand, e-commerce has 
made it possible for some firms to differentiate their products or services from others. 
Amazon patented one-click purchasing, for instance, while eBay created a unique, easy-
to-use interface and a differentiating brand name. Therefore, although e-commerce has 
increased emphasis on price competition, it has also enabled businesses to create new 
strategies for differentiation and branding so that they can retain higher prices.

It is impossible to determine if e-commerce technologies have had an overall posi-
tive or negative impact on firm profitability in general. Each industry is unique, so it is 
necessary to perform a separate analysis for each one. Clearly, e-commerce has shaken 
the foundations of some industries, in particular, content industries (such as the music, 
newspaper, book, and software industries) as well as other information-intense indus-
tries such as financial services. In these industries, the power of consumers has grown 
relative to providers, prices have fallen, and overall profitability has been challenged. 
In other industries, especially manufacturing, e-commerce has not greatly changed 
relationships with buyers, but has changed relationships with suppliers. Increasingly, 
manufacturing firms in entire industries have banded together to aggregate purchases, 
create industry exchanges or marketplaces, and outsource industrial processes in order 
to obtain better prices from suppliers. Throughout this book, we document these changes 
in industry structure and market dynamics introduced by e-commerce.
INDUSTRY VALUE CHAINS
While an industry structural analysis helps you understand the impact of e-commerce 
technology on the overall business environment in an industry, a more detailed indus-
try value chain analysis can help identify more precisely just how e-commerce may 
change business operations at the industry level. One of the basic tools for understand-
ing the impact of information technology on industry and firm operations is the value 
chain. The concept is quite simple. A value chain is the set of activities performed 
in an industry or in a firm that transforms raw inputs into final products and services. 
Each of these activities adds economic value to the final product; hence, the term value 
chain as an interconnected set of value-adding activities. Figure 5.4 illustrates the six 
generic players in an industry value chain: suppliers, manufacturers, transporters, 
distributors, retailers, and customers.

FIGURE 5.4	
E-COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY VALUE CHAINS
Every industry can be characterized by a set of value-adding activities performed by a variety of actors. 
E-commerce potentially affects the capabilities of each player as well as the overall operational efficiency of 
the industry.

By reducing the cost of information, e-commerce offers each of the key players 
in an industry value chain new opportunities to maximize their positions by lower-
ing costs and/or raising prices. For instance, manufacturers can reduce the costs 
they pay for goods by developing Internet-based B2B exchanges with their suppli-
ers. Manufacturers can develop direct relationships with their customers, bypass-
ing the costs of distributors and retailers. Distributors can develop highly efficient 
inventory management systems to reduce their costs, and retailers can develop 
highly efficient customer relationship management systems to strengthen their 
service to customers. Customers in turn can search for the best quality, fastest 
delivery, and lowest prices, thereby lowering their transaction costs and reducing 
prices they pay for final goods. Finally, the operational efficiency of the entire 
industry can increase, lowering prices and adding value for consumers, and helping 
the industry to compete with alternative industries.
FIRM VALUE CHAINS
The concept of value chain can be used to analyze a single firm’s operational efficiency 
as well. The question here is: How does e-commerce technology potentially affect the 
value chains of firms within an industry? A firm value chain is the set of activities 
a firm engages in to create final products from raw inputs. Each step in the process of 
production adds value to the final product. In addition, firms develop support activities 
that coordinate the production process and contribute to overall operational efficiency. 
Figure 5.5 illustrates the key steps and support activities in a firm’s value chain.
E-commerce offers firms many opportunities to increase their operational effi-
ciency and differentiate their products. For instance, firms can use the Internet’s 
communications efficiency to outsource some primary and secondary activities to 
specialized, more efficient providers without such outsourcing being visible to the 
firm value chain

E-COMMERCE AND FIRM VALUE CHAINS
Every firm can be characterized by a set of value-adding primary and secondary activities performed by a 
variety of actors in the firm. A simple firm value chain performs five primary value-adding steps: inbound 
logistics, operations, outbound logistics, sales and marketing, and after sales service.

consumer. In addition, firms can use e-commerce to more precisely coordinate the 
steps in the value chains and reduce their costs. Finally, firms can use e-commerce to 
provide users with more differentiated and high-value products. For instance, Amazon 
provides consumers with a much larger inventory of books to choose from, at a lower 
cost, than traditional book stores. It also provides many services—such as instantly 
available professional and consumer reviews, and information on buying patterns of 
other consumers—that traditional bookstores cannot.
FIRM VALUE WEBS
While firms produce value through their value chains, they also rely on the value 
chains of their partners—their suppliers, distributors, and delivery firms. E-commerce 
creates new opportunities for firms to cooperate and create a value web. A value web 
is a networked business ecosystem that uses e-commerce technology to coordinate 
the value chains of business partners within an industry, or at the first level, to coor-
dinate the value chains of a group of firms. Figure 5.6 illustrates a value web.
A value web coordinates a firm’s suppliers with its own production needs using 
an Internet-based supply chain management system. We discuss these B2B systems

in Chapter 12. Firms also use the Internet to develop close relationships with their 
logistics partners. For instance, Amazon relies on UPS tracking systems to provide its 
customers with online package tracking, and it relies on the U.S. Postal Service systems 
to insert packages directly into the mail stream. Amazon has partnership relations with 
hundreds of firms to generate customers and to manage relationships with customers. 
In fact, when you examine Amazon closely, you realize that the value it delivers to 
customers is in large part the result of coordination with other firms and not simply 
the result of activities internal to Amazon. The value of Amazon is, in large part, the 
value delivered by its value web partners. This is difficult for other firms to imitate 
in the short run.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
A business strategy is a set of plans for achieving superior long-term returns on 
the capital invested in a business firm. A business strategy is therefore a plan for 
making profits in a competitive environment over the long term. Profit is simply 
the difference between the price a firm is able to charge for its products and the 
cost of producing and distributing goods. Profit represents economic value. Economic 
value is created anytime customers are willing to pay more for a product than it 
costs to produce. Why would anyone pay more for a product than it costs to produce? 
There are multiple answers. The product may be unique (there are no other sup-
pliers), it may be the least costly product of its type available, consumers may be 
able to purchase the product anywhere in the world, or it may satisfy some unique 
needs that other products do not. Each of these sources of economic value defines 
a firm’s strategy for positioning its products in the marketplace. There are four 
generic strategies for achieving a profitable business: differentiation, cost, scope, 
and focus. We describe each of these below. The specific strategies that a firm follows 
will depend on the product, the industry, and the marketplace where competition 
is encountered.
Although the Internet is a unique marketplace, the same principles of strategy and 
business apply. As you will see throughout the book, successful e-commerce strategies 
involve using the Internet and mobile platform to leverage and strengthen existing 
business (rather than destroy your business), and to provide products and services 
your competitors cannot copy (in the short term anyway). That means developing 
unique products, proprietary content, distinguishing processes (such as Amazon’s 
one-click shopping), and personalized or customized services and products (Porter, 
2001). There are five generic business strategies: product/service differentiation, cost 
competition, scope, focus, and customer/supplier intimacy. Let’s examine these ideas 
more closely.
Differentiation refers to all the ways producers can make their products or ser-
vices unique and distinguish them from those of competitors. The opposite of differ-
entiation is commoditization—a situation where there are no differences among 
products or services, and the only basis of choosing is price. As economists tell us,

when price alone becomes the basis of competition and there are many suppliers and 
many customers, eventually the price of the good/service falls to the cost to produce 
it (marginal revenues from the nth unit equal marginal costs). And then profits are 
zero! This is an unacceptable situation for any business person. The solution is to 
differentiate your product or service and to create a monopoly-like situation where 
you are the only supplier.
There are many ways businesses differentiate their products or services. A busi-
ness may start with a core generic product or service, but then create expectations 
among users about the “experience” of consuming the product or using the service— 
“Nothing equals the experience of driving a BMW.” Businesses may also augment prod-
ucts and services by adding features to make them different from those of competitors. 
And businesses can differentiate their products and services further by enhancing 
their abilities to solve related consumer problems. For instance, tax programs such as 
TurboTax can import data from spreadsheet programs, as well as be used to file tax 
returns online. These capabilities are enhancements to the product that solve a cus-
tomer’s problems. The purpose of marketing is to create these differentiation features 
and to make the consumer aware of the unique qualities of products and services, 
creating in the process a “brand” that stands for these features. We discuss marketing 
and branding in Chapters 6 and 7.
In their totality, the differentiation features of a product or service constitute 
the customer value proposition we described in earlier sections of this chapter. 
E-commerce offers some unique ways to differentiate products and services, such as 
the ability to personalize the shopping experience and to customize the product or 
service to the particular demands of each consumer. E-commerce businesses can also 
differentiate products and services by making it possible to purchase the product from 
home, work, or on the road (ubiquity); by making it possible to purchase anywhere in 
the world (global reach); by creating unique interactive content, videos, stories about 
users, and reviews by users (richness and interactivity); and by storing and processing 
information for consumers of the product or service, such as warranty information on 
all products purchased through a site or income tax information online (information 
density).
Adopting a strategy of cost competition means a business has discovered some 
unique set of business processes or resources that other firms cannot obtain in the 
marketplace. Business processes are the atomic units of the value chain. For instance, 
the set of value-creating activities called Inbound Logistics in Figure 5.6 is in reality 
composed of many different collections of activities performed by people on the 
loading docks and in the warehouses. These different collections of activities are called 
business processes—the set of steps or procedures required to perform the various 
elements of the value chain.
When a firm discovers a new, more efficient set of business processes, it can 
obtain a cost advantage over competitors. Then it can attract customers by charging a 
lower price, while still making a handsome profit. Eventually, its competitors go out 
of business as the market decisively tilts toward the lowest-cost provider. Or, when 
a business discovers a unique resource, or lower-cost supplier, it can also compete

effectively on cost. For instance, switching production to low-wage-cost areas of the 
world is one way to lower costs.
Competing on cost can be a short-lived affair and very tricky. Competitors can 
also discover the same or different efficiencies in production. And competitors can 
also move production to low-cost areas of the world. Also, competitors may decide to 
lose money for a period as they compete on cost.
E-commerce offers some ways to compete on cost, at least in the short term. 
Firms can leverage ubiquity by lowering the costs of order entry (the customer fills 
out all the forms, so there is no order entry department); leverage global reach and 
universal standards by having a single order entry system worldwide; and leverage 
richness, interactivity, and personalization by creating customer profiles online and 
treating each individual consumer differently—without the use of an expensive sales 
force that performed these functions in the past. Finally, firms can leverage informa-
tion intensity by providing consumers with detailed information on products, without 
maintaining either expensive catalogs or a sales force.
While e-commerce offers powerful capabilities for intensifying cost competition, 
which makes cost competition appear to be a viable strategy, the danger is that com-
petitors have access to the same technology. The factor markets—where producers buy 
supplies—are open to all. Assuming they have the skills and organizational will to use 
the technology, competitors can buy many of the same cost-reducing techniques in 
the marketplace. Even a skilled labor force can be purchased, ultimately. However, 
self-knowledge, proprietary tacit knowledge (knowledge that is not published or codi-
fied), and a loyal, skilled workforce are in the short term difficult to purchase in factor 
markets. Therefore, cost competition remains a viable strategy.
Two other generic business strategies are scope and focus. A scope strategy is a 
strategy to compete in all markets around the globe, rather than merely in local, 
regional, or national markets. The Internet’s global reach, universal standards, and 
ubiquity can certainly be leveraged to assist businesses in becoming global competi-
tors. Yahoo, for instance, along with all of the other top 20 e-commerce companies, 
has readily attained a global presence. A focus/market niche strategy is a strategy 
to compete within a narrow market segment or product segment. This is a specializa-
tion strategy with the goal of becoming the premier provider in a narrow market. For 
instance, L.L.Bean uses e-commerce to continue its historic focus on outdoor sports 
apparel; and W.W. Grainger—the Web’s most frequently visited B2B site—focuses on 
the narrow MRO market segment. E-commerce offers some obvious capabilities that 
enable a focus strategy. Firms can leverage richness and interactivity to create highly 
focused messages to different market segments; information intensity makes it pos-
sible to focus e-mail and other marketing campaigns on small market segments; per-
sonalization—and related customization—means the same product can be customized 
and personalized to fulfill the very focused needs of specific market segments and 
consumers.
Another generic strategy is customer intimacy, which focuses on developing 
strong ties with customers. Strong linkages with customers increase switching costs 
(the costs of switching from one product or service to a competing product or service)

and thereby enhance a firm’s competitive advantage. For example, Amazon’s one-click 
shopping that retains customer details and recommendation services based on previ-
ous purchases makes it more likely that customers will return to make subsequent 
purchases. 
Table 5.9 summarizes the five basic business strategies.
Industry structure, industry and firm value chains, value webs, and business strat-
egy are central business concepts used throughout this book to analyze the viability 
of and prospects for e-commerce sites. In particular, the signature case studies found 
at the end of each chapter are followed by questions that may ask you to identify the 
competitive forces in the case, or analyze how the case illustrates changes in industry 
structure, industry and firm value chains, and business strategy.
E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODEL DISRUPTION 
While e-commerce has changed most industries in terms of their structure, processes, 
and strategies, in some cases e-commerce has radically changed entire industries, 
driving incumbent firms out of business, greatly altering the economics of an industry, 
and spawning entirely new firms and value chains (Schumpeter, 1942). When new 
technologies are at the core of a change in the way business is done, they are referred 
to as disruptive technologies. When the technology involved is digital, the term 
digital disruption is used. Usually it is not the technology per se that is disruptive—in 
fact, it can be rather ordinary and commonplace. Instead, the disruption occurs when 
an innovative firm applies the technology to pursue a different business model and 
strategy than existing firms, perhaps discovering a whole new market that existing 
firms did not even know existed (Bower and Christensen, 1995; Christensen and Leslie, 
2000). For instance, personal computers using off-the-shelf inexpensive processors and 
technologies disrupted the market for mainframe and mini-computers. All the eight 
elements of a business model identified previously can be affected by disruptive

technologies, from the business value proposition to the revenue model, market oppor-
tunity, competitive environment, competitive advantage, market strategy, organiza-
tional development, and management. In short, it’s a whole new world that often 
confuses and surprises successful companies who tend to dismiss and mock the early 
disruptive products. For instance, the entrepreneurs who introduced personal comput-
ers identified an entire new market of customers that had been ignored by the large 
computer firms, along with new price points, competitive factors, and market strategy, 
using new organizational and management teams. Many existing firms could not 
compete, and dissolved. Similar dynamics can be found in communications (disrupted 
by e-mail), data storage, music, photography, publishing, and transportation (Lepore, 
2014). In 2015, firms like Uber and Airbnb are beginning to have an impact on the taxi 
and lodging industries, which may be disrupted in several years if these newer firms 
succeed. 
Not all technologies are disruptive. In fact, most successful companies use technol-
ogy to sustain their current business models, industry structre, processes, and strate-
gies. This use of technology is referred to as sustaining technology because it helps 
companies to cope with competitive pressures and improve their products, and serve 
their customers with less expensive, more powerful, or unique products. But the same 
technology can be used by innovative entrepreneurs (disruptors) to destroy existing 
business models. Here’s how it works. 
Successful companies use whatever technology is available to incrementally 
improve their products, focusing on the customer by improving quality, price, and 
service. The incumbent and dominant firms seek to maintain the status quo in an 
industry, and their firms. In the first disruptive stage, disruptors, often funded by 
new sources of finance, introduce new products that are less expensive, less capable, 
and of poorer quality. The first personal computers used relatively unsophisticated 
technology compared to mainframe computers of the 1970s. These early products 
nevertheless find a niche in a market that incumbents do not serve or are unaware of. 
In the second stage, disruptors improve their products at a rapid pace, taking advantage 
of newer technologies at a faster pace than incumbents, expanding their niche market, 
and eventually attracting a larger customer base from the incumbents’ market. When 
word processors, and eventually Microsoft Office, were married to the more powerful 
PC of the 1980s, they attracted a new market of business managers and professionals 
that was not served by incumbents. The concept was entirely new at the time. The 
successful incumbents never thought business professionals, let alone people working 
at home, would like to have a computer at their desk to create documents, build 
spreadsheets, and make presentation slides. The people and companies that developed 
personal computers were outsiders to the mainframe computer industry. They were 
disruptors. They had the vision. 
In the third stage, the new products and business model become good enough, 
and even superior to products offered by incumbents. In the fourth stage, incumbent 
companies lose market share, and either go out of business or are consolidated into 
other more successful firms that serve a much more limited customer base. Some 
incumbents survive by finding new customers for their existing product, adopting 
some of the newer products and business models in separate divisions of their firms, 
or moving into other often nearby markets. For instance, mainframe computers are

still made by IBM, but they are one of the few survivors. They survived by sustaining 
innovation in their traditional market of large-scale computing for Fortune 500 firms, 
moving into computing services, data centers, enterprise software, and most recently 
cloud computing, business analytics, data mining, and machine learning. As for the PC 
industry, it is currently being disrupted by smartphones and tablet computers, created 
by outsiders who played a small role in the personal computer world, and who have 
identified huge consumer markets that incumbent PC manufacturers did not realize 
even existed. They have the vision, for now, but they face new digital disruptors sure 
to follow. 
Why don’t the existing companies realize the changes that are coming, and take 
steps to compete directly with the disruptors? Successful incumbents usually have 
enormous capital reserves, in-depth technology and intellectual skills, and access 
to prestigious management consulting firms. Why didn’t Kodak see the transition to 
digital photography? Why didn’t Canon see the smartphone camera as a powerful 
competitor to digital cameras? Why don’t firms disrupt their own business models? 
The answers are complex. Incumbent technologists and professionals may be trained 
in an unfit fitness, having the wrong skills for the current environment. Shareholders 
expect returns on investment, not destruction of a firm’s historic and cherished profit-
able products. The existing customer base comes to expect continuous improvement 
in existing products—not a business disruption, but business as usual. These power-
ful practices, all of which make good business sense, prevent incumbent firms from 
meeting the challenges of business model disruption. It is unclear at this time if the 
two most innovative firms in the current e-commerce environment, Apple and Google, 
will prove any different from previous incumbents.

Takes Pandora Public
P
andora is the Internet’s most successful radio service. As of June 2015, 
it had over 250 million registered users (225 million of whom access the 
service via a mobile device) and about 80 million active listeners. Pandora 
accounts for more than 45% of all Internet radio listening hours, more 
than double its closest competitor, Spotify, and a 9% share of total U.S. radio listening 
(both traditional and Internet). In 2014, it streamed over 20 billion hours of music!
At Pandora, users select a genre of music based on a favorite musician, and a com-
puter algorithm puts together a personal radio station that plays not only the music 
of the selected artist but also closely related music by different artists. As of June 
2015, listeners have created over 8 billion different stations. A team of approximately 
25 professional musicians listens to new songs each day and classifies the music 
according to more than 450 musical criteria. These criteria are used in a computer 
algorithm to classify new songs into various genres. Within each of these genres are 
hundreds of subgenres. Altogether, Pandora has a database of over 1 million analyzed 
songs from over 200,000 artists.

Pandora’s founders, Will Glaser and Tim Westergren, launched Pandora in 2005.
Their biggest challenge was making a business out of a totally new kind of online 
radio station when competing online stations were making music available for free, 
many without advertising, and online subscription services were streaming music for 
a monthly fee and finding some advertising support as well. Online music illegally 
downloaded from P2P networks for free was also a significant factor, as was iTunes, 
which by 2005 was a roaring success, charging 99 cents a song. The idea of a “personal” 
radio station playing your kind of music was very new. 
Pandora’s business strategy is referred to as “freemium.” A freemium strategy is 
based on giving away some products or services for free while relying on a certain per-
centage of customers to pay for premium versions of the same product or service. As 
Chris Anderson, author of Free: The Future of a Radical Price, has pointed out, because 
the marginal cost of digital products is typically close to zero, providing free product 
does not cost much, and potentially enables you to reach many more people. If the 
market is very large, even getting just 1% of that market to purchase could be very 
lucrative. Other notable freemium success stories include LinkedIn, a social network 
for career-oriented and job networking that offers some basic services for free, such as 
creating a profile and making connections, but which charges for premium services, 
and Dropbox, a cloud storage and file sharing service that provides 2 gigabytes of cloud 
storage for free, but charges for additional storage. Freemium has been the standard 
business model for most apps, with over 65% of the top 100 apps in Apple’s App Store 
using a freemium strategy.
Pandora’s first strategy was to give away 10 hours of free access, and then ask 
subscribers to pay $36 a month for a year after they used up their free 10 hours. The 
result: 100,000 people listened to their 10 hours for free and then refused to pay for 
the annual service. People loved Pandora but appeared unwilling to pay for it. 
Facing financial collapse, in November 2005 Pandora introduced an ad-supported 
option. Subscribers could listen to a maximum of 40 hours of music in a calendar 
month for free. After the 40 hours were used up, subscribers had three choices: (a) pay 
99 cents for the rest of the month, (b) sign up for a premium service offering unlimited 
usage, or (c) do nothing. If they chose (c), the music would stop, but users could sign 
up again the next month. The ad-supported business model was a risky move because 
Pandora had no ad server or accounting system, but it attracted so many users that in 
a few weeks it had a sufficient number of advertisers (including Apple) to pay for its 
infrastructure. In 2006, Pandora added a “Buy” button to each song being played and 
struck deals with Amazon, iTunes, and other online retail sites. Pandora now gets an 
affiliate fee for directing listeners to Amazon where users can buy the music. In 2008, 
Pandora added an iPhone app to allow users to sign up from their smartphones and 
listen all day if they wanted. By 2009, this “free” ad-supported model had attracted 20 
million users. 
After attracting a sufficiently large user base, Pandora turned its attention back 
to its premium service. In late 2009, the company launched Pandora One, a high-end 
version of its service that offered no advertising, higher-quality streaming music, a 
desktop app, and fewer usage limits. The service cost $36 a year. This time around it 
met with much more success, so much so that Pandora went public in June 2011. By

2015, Pandora had a projected $1.16 billion in revenue with about 80% coming from 
advertising and the remainder from subscriptions and other sources. 
However, Pandora has not yet shown a profit, and its stock price has slowly 
declined. The company is experiencing slowing growth rates in its number of active 
users, registering just a 5% increase in users in 2014, compared to an 8% increase the 
year prior. Music licensing costs are likely to sharply increase in the coming years, 
clouding their path to profitability further. And the company faces increasingly stiff 
competition from services such as Spotify, which also is using the freemium strat-
egy. Fully paid services like Apple-backed Apple Music, as well as much-hyped new 
entrants like Tidal, founded by Jay Z and a slew of other high profile artists, represent 
threats to Pandora as well. But the picture isn’t totally bleak: Pandora has continued 
to show growth in advertising revenue and in listener hours, as its active users are 
listening more and more.
While freemium clearly has worked to grow companies like Pandora, LinkedIn, 
and Dropbox, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of the freemium strategy. 
The crux of the issue is that while freemium can be an efficient way to gather a large 
group of potential customers, companies have found that it’s a challenge to convert 
eyeballs into those willing to pay. Absent subscriber revenue, firms are forced to rely 
on advertising revenues. 
Apple has led a recent push against freemium music streaming services like 
Pandora and Spotify. In 2014, Apple, sensing a shift away from paid downloads towards 
streaming services, acquired Beats, which made trendy headphones and had a stream-
ing music service, for $3 billion. Pandora and Spotify have thrived at the expense 
of iTunes Music Store, whose revenues have declined steeply for several years, and 
Apple’s first attempt at a streaming service, iTunes Radio, was a bust. In 2015, Apple, 
after working with Beats, launched its own paid subscription streaming service app, 
Apple Music. 
Music industry executives remain unsure of the profit potential of the freemium 
model, and many of them have begun to pressure Spotify to remove its free tier of 
service.  Pandora is likely not far behind. The heads of Universal Music Group and 
Sony Music both expressed skepticism of the long-term prospects of the freemium 
model in 2015, and in 2014, Taylor Swift removed her entire catalog of music from 
Spotify in protest of freemium, claiming that it devalued her music. Although Apple’s 
activities have drawn the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust divi-
sion, it clearly has no intention of stopping its assault on its freemium competitors, 
and music labels are optimistic about Apple’s ability to make paid streaming work, 
given Apple’s deep pockets and brand cachet. But other industry analysts believe 
that Pandora and Spotify are headed toward profitability as their subscriber numbers 
continue to expand. Both Universal and Sony registered strong first-quarter results in 
2015, driven by streaming services. It is not clear whether the labels are truly skeptical 
of freemium, or just Apple.
Whether freemium services continue to breathe life back into the music business 
remains to be seen, but other companies like MailChimp show how freemium can 
turn a company’s fortunes around.The company lets anyone send e-mail to customers, 
manage subscriber lists, and track the performance of an e-mail marketing campaign.

Despite the powerful tools it gives marketers, and its open applications programming 
interface, after 10 years in business, the company had only 85,000 paid subscribers. 
In 2009, MailChimp began giving away its basic tools and charging subscription 
fees for special features, expecting that users would be more willing to pay for analyt-
ics and other services as their e-mail lists grew. In just over a year, MailChimp went 
from 85,000 to 450,000 users. E-mail volume went from 200 million a month to around 
700 million. Most importantly, the number of paying customers increased more than 
150%, while profit increased more than 650%! 
For MailChimp, freemium has been worth the price. It currently supports more 
than 8 million subscribers worldwide, sending about 18 billion e-mails a month. 
However, Ning, a company originally founded to enable companies and individual 
users to create their own social networks, tried freemium and came to a different 
conclusion. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape and co-creator 
of the first Web browser, launched Ning in 2004. With his assistance, the company 
raised $119 million in funding. Despite being the market’s leading social network 
infrastructure platform, Ning was having a common problem—converting eyeballs into 
paying customers. While 13% of customers were paying for some premium services, 
the revenue was not enough. The more free users Ning acquired, the more it cost the 
company.
In May 2010, Ning announced the impending end of its freemium strategy. The 
company shed staff, going from 167 to 98, and began using 100% of its resources to 
capture premium users. Since shifting to a three-tier paid subscription model, Ning has 
experienced explosive growth, increasing the number of paying customers from 17,000 
to more than 100,000 and growing revenue by more than 500%. By September 2011, 
Ning had more than 100 million registered user social profiles and its social networks 
reached more than 60 million monthly unique users. After its 2011 acquisition by Glam 
Media for $200 million and 2013 relaunch, Ning continues to charge users a fee after 
a free trial period, rather than returning to its old freemium strategy.
So when does it make sense to include freemium in a business plan? It makes 
sense when the product is easy to use and has a very large potential audience, prefer-
ably in the millions. Using a freemium strategy can be a very successful marketing 
tool, because free features can help attract a user base, and are more attractive to most 
consumers than 30-day free trials that require a cancellation process. A solid customer 
value proposition is critical. It’s helpful if a large user network increases the perceived 
value of the product (i.e., a dating service such as Match). Freemium may work when 
a company has good long-term customer retention rates and the product produces 
more value over time. An extremely important part of the equation is that the variable 
costs of providing the product or service to additional customers for free must be low. 
Companies also face challenges in terms of determining what products and/or 
services to offer for free versus what to charge for (this may change over time), the cost 
of supporting free customers, and how to price premium services. Further, it is difficult 
to predict attrition rates, which are highly variable at companies using freemium. So, 
while freemium can be a great way to get early users and to provide a company with 
a built-in pool for upgrades, it’s tough to determine how many users will be willing to 
pay and willing to stay.

A freemium strategy makes sense for companies such as Pandora, where there is a 
very low marginal cost, approaching zero, to support free users. It also makes sense for 
a company where the value to its potential customers depends on a large network, like 
LinkedIn. Freemium also works when a business can be supported by the percentage 
of customers who are willing to pay, like Pandora, especially when there are other 
revenues like advertising fees that can make up for shortfalls in subscriber revenues. 
The freemium music streaming services don’t have to worry about their business 
model being sound strategy, but they do have to worry about industry goliaths like 
Apple and the record labels taking a stand against them.

Revenue model—how the company plans to make money from its operations. Major e-commerce revenue 
models include the advertising model, subscription model, transaction fee model, sales model, and affili-
ate model.
•	
Market opportunity—the revenue potential within a company’s intended marketspace.
•	
Competitive environment—the direct and indirect competitors doing business in the same marketspace, 
including how many there are and how profitable they are.
•	
Competitive advantage—the factors that differentiate the business from its competition, enabling it to pro-
vide a superior product at a lower cost.
•	
Market strategy—the plan a company develops that outlines how it will enter a market and attract custom-
ers.
•	
Organizational development—the process of defining all the functions within a business and the skills nec-
essary to perform each job, as well as the process of recruiting and hiring strong employees.
•	
Management team—the group of individuals retained to guide the company’s growth and expansion.

atch out tech titans! InMobi, 
an innovative startup based in 
Bangalore, India, is making 
some serious waves in the global mobile adver-
tising network marketplace currently dominated 
by Google, Facebook, and Twitter. InMobi was 
founded in early 2007 by four graduates of the 
Indian Institute of Technology, including Naveen 
Tewari. After unsuccessful attempts at SMS-based 
mobile search and a mobile-based deals company 
specifically for Mumbai, Tewari and his co-founders 
scrambled to come up with a new idea. With the last 
of their personal funds, they honed in on mobile 
advertising. Apple had just introduced the iPhone in 
early 2007, and few companies were focusing yet on the cellphone as a mobile advertising 
platform. This new idea proved to be the company’s golden ticket, and in 2008, Tewari 
convinced venture firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sherpalo Investments to 
make an $8 million investment in the company. They then moved to Bangalore, deeming 
it a better location from which to attract talent, and later changed the name of the 
company to InMobi.
InMobi bills itself as a mobile advertising platform and solutions provider. It acts as 
an intermediary between companies that want to advertise and content owners/publishers 
that offer mobile content, often in the form of apps. For instance, if you’ve seen the adver-
tisements that appear when you play the Angry Birds games on an Android smartphone, 
you’ve seen InMobi’s mobile ad platform at work. InMobi serves almost 138 billion mobile 
ads a month to over 1 billion consumers in over 200 countries. There are over 30,000 
apps and mobile sites on the inMobi network, and the company tracks over two billion app 
downloads on its platform. Although it is a private company, InMobi’s revenues in 2014 
are believed to have been over $250 million, and showed a profit for the first time in the 
last quarter of 2014. It makes money by keeping a percentage of the revenue per ad, typi-
cally 30–40%. Increasingly, InMobi has focused on native advertising as the marketplace 
abandons banner ads and moves towards more creative and interactive formats. Native 
advertising appears seamlessly within an app and often appears as if it were a post from 
a friend. InMobi’s customers include Unilever, Samsung, Microsoft, Adidas, and a rapidly 
growing number of other prominent companies and brands.

From the very beginning, CEO Tewari and his co-founders knew that they wanted 
to have a global presence. It used a “reverse market strategy,” establishing leadership 
positions in Asia and Africa first and then tackling the European Union and U.S. markets. 
Today it employs over 900 people and has offices around the world, including in India, Asia 
(China, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan), Australia, the European 
Union (Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, and Sweden), the Middle East 
(UAE), and the United States (San Francisco). Fueled in part by a $200 million invest-
ment from Japanese media and telecommunications giant Softbank, which valued InMobi 
at over $1 billion, InMobi is currently focusing on growth in the United States and plans 
to focus next on Russia and Latin America, where growth in mobile users is expected to 
rise the fastest. InMobi has also used funds to make some strategic purchases, including 
MMTG Labs, a developer of an application market for Facebook pages, Appstores.com, 
and Overlay Media, which helps to deliver more highly targeted and context-sensitive ads.
Can InMobi truly hope to challenge Google, which is currently the dominant leader 
in market share? Its $250 million in revenues still trails behind Google’s $1.5 billion in 
revenue from mobile display advertising. Nonetheless, Tewari thinks so, claiming that 
InMobi is currently second, with a market share of more than 10%, and that the company 
is on a trajectory to become one of the top 10 Internet companies by 2020. InMobi has 
modeled itself after Google and other tech titans in its hiring and employee policies, 
which allow employees the latitude and support to come up with the next big, disruptive 
idea. InMobi boasts a growing number of partnerships with other tech firms, including 
Amobee, which services a large portfolio of Fortune 500 brands that will now be using 
InMobi’s ad network, as well as payment processing firm Stripe; Chinese tech firm APUS, 
which will broaden InMobi’s reach to over 500 million Chinese users in 2016; and Dell 
Inc., with whom InMobi will team up to build an e-commerce platform for Dell products. 
Tewari also points to InMobi’s primary focus on mobile, compared to Google, which is 
involved in many different areas. InMobi also claims that its technology is superior and 
that its data on customers is richer and more granular. In 2015, InMobi backed up its 
claims when it became one of the first mobile advertising companies to offer a 100% 
viewability guarantee, a rarity in the modern landscape of ad blockers and ad fraud. As 
more advertisers gravitate to the mobile platform, an emphasis on ensuring that ads are 
viewable will help InMobi differentiate itself from the pack.
Tewari also claims that inMobi understands user behavior better than most of the 
other large players in the mobile advertising market. His confidence stems from InMobi’s 
appographic targeting system, which uses algorithms and data on how users interact 
with apps to determine very precise trends and preferences of those users. To develop the 
system, InMobi studied over 100,000 apps and how different types of consumers used 
them. The result is a system so accurate that InMobi has guaranteed 2–3% increases in 
engagement by app developers using InMobi’s services. In 2014, InMobi continued to 
innovate, honing the Geo Context Targeting system used in its Smart Ads, which it says 
generate ten times the interaction compared to traditional ads, and more than three times 
the conversion rate of traditional ads. SmartAds support rich media and are tailored based 
on users’ personal details and geographic conditions in the area, such as location and 
nearby weather. For example, if you’re strolling city streets on a hot summer afternoon,

you’ll be given advertisements for cold beverages from nearby food chains. InMobi’s 
emphasis on data drives its product offerings, prompting Tewari to describe InMobi as 
“a data company,” not an advertising company.
In 2015, InMobi launched its Miip personalized discovery tool, which is a monkey 
character that persists throughout multiple apps and offers users options for different 
types of content, including product feeds and other apps. Over time, Miip improves its 
accuracy, offering only the most relevant and thematically consistent products to users, 
such as workout wear in a fitness app and fashion tips in a dating app, while also provid-
ing direct links to purchase products or download apps. Tewari asserts that Miip is an 
advertising feature that actually includes the user, making it much more engaging and 
persuasive, and InMobi believes Miip will generate $1 billion by 2017. InMobi has also 
partnered with Taboola, the largest global content discovery platform, to provide more 
personalized recommendations and content natively on iOS and Android.
InMobi also launched several new advertising platforms in 2014, including an interac-
tive video ad platform as well as a native ad exchange, to help advertisers boost their sales 
on mobile beyond Facebook and Google. InMobi’s video ad platform focuses on contex-
tualized mobile video ads using its advanced targeting system. Developed in tandem with 
programmatic advertising service provider Rubicon Project, InMobi’s native ad exchange 
is the first that allows buying and selling of mobile native advertising on a global scale.
Tewari realizes that the competition is about to get a lot tougher, but believes his 
company is well-positioned, particularly due to its global scope. Although InMobi is at a 
disadvantage because Google, Facebook, and Twitter have major social media platforms 
and services with which they can provide mobile advertising, the market for independent 
native ad networks that are not affiliated with these companies is estimated to be between 
$8 and $10 billion annually. For many advertisers, advertising with InMobi may be more 
cost effective than developing individual advertisements for Google, Facebook, Twitter, 
and other services of sufficient size. On the other hand, users spend much more time on 
these bigger sites than they do anywhere else, which complicates things for inMobi. The 
mobile advertising marketplace is expected to become so large (it is estimated that over 
$500 billion will be spent by mobile advertisers over the next 10 years) that there is plenty 
of room for more than just one company to benefit. InMobi also claims that its margins 
are a whopping 40% compared to just 5–10% in the TV and print advertising industry, 
and when asked whether users are tired of all the advertising, Tewari counters that users 
are tired of irrelevant ads, not advertising in general. Many analysts believe that InMobi 
is close to launching an IPO as the global mobile advertising market continues to grow 
rapidly and InMobi’s future prospects get brighter. Perhaps sensing an eventual threat, 
rumors swirled in 2015 that Google was preparing an offer to acquire InMobi for over $2 
billion, but InMobi is determined to go its own way and beat the giants at their own game.

erhaps no area of business has been more affected by Internet and mobile 
platform technologies than marketing and marketing communications. 
As a communications tool, the Internet affords marketers new ways of 
contacting millions of potential customers at costs far lower than traditional media. 
The Internet also provides new ways—often instantaneous and spontaneous—to gather 
information from customers, adjust product offerings, and increase customer value. 
The Internet has spawned entirely new ways to identify and communicate with cus-
tomers, including search engine marketing, social marketing, behavioral targeting, 
and targeted e-mail, among others. And the Internet was just the first transformation. 
Today, the mobile platform based on smartphones and tablet computers is transform-
ing online marketing and communications yet again. Table 6.1 summarizes some of 
the significant new developments in online marketing and advertising for 2015–2016.
The subject of online marketing, branding, and market communications is very 
broad and deep. We have created two chapters to cover the material. In this chapter, 
we begin by examining consumer behav­ior on the Web, the major types of online 
marketing and branding, and the technologies that support advances in online mar-
keting. We then focus on understanding the costs and benefits of online marketing 
communications. In Chapter 7, we focus on the social, mobile, and local marketing 
phenomenon in greater depth.
	 6.1	
CONSUMERS ONLINE: THE INTERNET AUDIENCE AND 
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
Before firms can begin to sell their products online, they must first understand 
what kinds of people they will find online and how those people behave in the 
online marketplace. In this section, we focus primarily on individual consumers 
in the business-to-consumer (B2C) arena. However, many of the factors discussed 
apply to the B2B arena as well, insofar as purchasing decisions by firms are made 
by individuals. For readers who have no background in marketing, we have created 
an online Learning Track, Learning Track 6.1, that discusses basic marketing and 
branding concepts.
INTERNET TRAFFIC PATTERNS: THE ONLINE CONSUMER PROFILE
We will start with an analysis of some basic background demographics of Web consum-
ers. The first principle of marketing and sales is “know thy customer.” Who is online, 
who shops online and why, and what do they buy? In 2015, around 3.1 billion people 
of all ages had access to the Internet. About 670 million households worldwide (almost 
32% of all households) have broadband access to the Internet. 
Although the number of new online users increased at a rate of 30% a year or 
higher in the early 2000s, over the last several years, this growth rate has slowed in 
most parts of the world. E-commerce businesses can no longer count on a double-digit

growth rate in the online population to fuel their revenues. The days of extremely 
rapid growth in the Internet population are over.
Intensity and Scope of Usage
The slowing rate of growth in the Internet population is compensated for, in part, by 
an increasing intensity and scope of use. In the United States, 71% of all adults report 
logging on on a typical day (Pew Research Center, 2014). Internet use by U.S. teens 
is even more pervasive, with over 90% saying they go online daily, and about 25% 
reporting that they use the Internet almost constantly (Pew Research Center, 2015a). 
Several studies also show that a greater amount of time is being spent online—over 4.5 
hours a day by U.K. adults, for instance. In 2015, mobile smartphones and tablets are 
major access points to the Internet and online commerce. About 2.25 billion people, 
about 72% of all Internet users worldwide, access the Internet using a mobile phone. 
Owners of mobile devices in the United Kingdom spend about 2.5 hours a day using 
them for nontelephone activities such as playing games, viewing videos, and visiting 
social networks (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). Engaging in such activities is widespread—in 
the U.S. in 2015, for instance, around 165 million mobile users played games, about 
107 million watched videos, 151 million visited a social network, and millions of others 
listened to music or shopped (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b). The more time users spend

•	 Online marketing and advertising spending continues to increase worldwide (by over 15% in 2015), 
compared to only about 6% for traditional media marketing and advertising.
•	 Video advertising continues to be one of the fastest growing formats.
•	 Search engine marketing and advertising continues in importance, but its rate of growth is slowing 
somewhat compared to other formats.
•	 Mobile, social, and local marketing spending all continue to rapidly expand.
•	 Viewability issues and ad fraud raise increasing concerns for marketers.
•	 Native advertising and other forms of content marketing rise.

•	 Ad blocking software usage increases, creating concern for both online publishers and advertisers.

•	 Programmatic advertising (automated, technology-driven method of buying and selling display and 
video ads) takes off.

•	 Targeted advertising based on behavioral tracking leads to growing privacy awareness and fears.

In the United States, the demographic profile of the Internet—and e-commerce—has 
changed greatly since 1995. Up until 2000, single, white, young, college-educated males 
with high incomes dominated the Internet. This inequality in access and usage led to 
concerns about a possible “digital divide.” However, in recent years, there has been a 
marked increase in Internet usage by females, minorities, seniors, and families with 
modest incomes, resulting in a notable decrease—but not elimination—in the earlier 
inequality of access and usage.
A roughly equal percentage of men (85%) and women (84%) use the Internet in 
the U.S. today. Young adults (18–29) form the age group with the highest percentage 
of Internet use, at 96%. Adults in the 30–49 group (93%) are also strongly represented. 
Another fast-growing group online is the 65 and over segment, 58% of whom now use 
the Internet. Teens (12–17) also have a very high percentage of their age group online 
(97%). The percentage of very young children (0–11 years) online has also spurted, 
to 50% of that age group. eMarketer predicts that future Internet user growth in the 
United States will come predominantly from those aged 55 and older and from children 
in the 0–11 age bracket (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b). Variation across ethnic groups is not 
as wide as across age groups. Ten years ago, there were significant differences among 
ethnic groups, but this has receded. In 2015, user participation by whites is 85%, 
Hispanics, 81%, and African-Americans, 78%. 
About 97% of U.S. households with income levels above $75,000 have Internet 
access, compared to only 74% of households earning less than $30,000. Over time, 
income differences have declined but they remain significant with a 23% gap between 
the highest category of household income and the lowest. Amount of education also 
makes a significant difference when it comes to online access. Of those individuals 
with less than a high school education, only 66% were online in 2015, compared to 
95% of individuals with a college degree or more. Even some college education boosted 
Internet usage, with that segment reaching 90% (Pew Research Center, 2015b).
Overall, the so-called “digital divide” has indeed moderated, but it still persists 
along income, education, age, and ethnic dimensions. Gender, income, education, age, 
and ethnicity also impact online behavior. According to the Pew Research Center, U.S. 
adults over the age of 65, those who have not completed high school, those who make 
less than $30,000 a year, and Hispanics are all less likely to purchase products online. 
Women are slightly more likely to purchase online than men, but not significantly so. 
With respect to online banking, the demographics are similar—those 65 and older are 
less likely than any age group to bank online, while those with at least some college 
are more likely than those with a high school diploma or less. Online banking is also 
more popular with men than women. No significant differences were found in terms 
of ethnicity (Pew Research Center, 2012). Other commentators have observed that 
children of poorer and less educated families spend considerably more time using 
their access devices for entertainment (movies, games, Facebook, and texting) than 

	 C o n s u m e r s  O n l i n e :  T h e  I n t e r n e t  A u d i e n c e  a n d  C o n s u m e r  B e h a v i o r

children from wealthier households. For all children and teenagers, the majority of 
time spent on the Internet is often labeled as “wasted time” because the majority of 
online use is for entertainment, and not education or learning (Richtel, 2012).
Type of Internet Connection: Broadband and Mobile Impacts
While a great deal of progress has been made in reducing glaring gaps in access 
to the Internet, there are still inequalities in access to broadband service. In 2015, 
around 91 million U.S. households had broadband service in their homes—75% of all 
households (eMarketer, Inc., 2015c). Research by the Pew Research Center indicates 
that broadband adoption levels are lower for older adults, those with low levels of 
education, and those with low household incomes. Rural residents, African Americans, 
and Latinos are also less likely to have a home broadband connection (Pew Research 
Center, 2013). For marketers, the broadband audience offers unique opportunities 
for the use of multimedia marketing campaigns, and for the positioning of products 
especially suited for this more educated and affluent audience. It is also important to 
note that just because a household does not have broadband access, it does not mean 
that household members do not use the Internet. About 50% of the non-broadband 
adopters do use the Internet, either from another location or via a smartphone. Certain 
groups are particularly reliant on smartphones for online access: younger adults in 
the 18–29 age group, those with low household incomes and levels of education, and 
non-whites (Pew Research Center, 2013a, 2013b, 2015c). The explosive growth of smart-
phones and tablet computers connected to broadband cellular and Wi-Fi networks is 
the foundation for a truly mobile e-commerce and marketing platform, which did not 
exist a few years ago. 
Community Effects: Social Contagion in Social Networks
For a physical retail store, the most important factor in shaping sales is location, loca-
tion, location. If you are located where thousands of people pass by every day, you will 
tend to do well. But for Internet retailers, physical location has almost no consequence 
as long as customers can be served by shipping services such as UPS or the post office 
or their services can be downloaded to anywhere. What does make a difference for 
consumer purchases on the Internet is whether or not the consumer is located in 
“neighborhoods” where others purchase on the Internet. These neighborhoods can 
be either face-to-face and truly personal, or digital. These so-called neighborhood 
effects, and the role of social emulation in consumption decisions, are well known for 
goods such as personal computers. In general, there is a relationship between being 
a member of a social network and purchasing decisions. Yet the relationship between 
“connectedness” (either offline or online) and purchase decisions is not straightforward 
or simple. People who score in the top 10%–15% of connectedness “do their own thing” 
to differentiate themselves and often do not share purchase decisions with friends. In 
fact, highly connected users often stop purchasing what their friends purchase. One 
can think of them as iconoclasts. The middle 50% of connected people very often 
share purchase patterns of their friends. One can think of these people as “keeping up 
with the Joneses” (Iyengar et al., 2009). A recent study of 6,000 social network users 

380	
	
C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g 
found that social networks have a powerful influence on shopping and purchasing 
behavior. An estimated 40% of social media users have purchased an item after sharing 
or favoriting it on Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter. Facebook is the network most likely 
to drive customers to purchase, followed by Pinterest and Twitter. Unexpectedly, social 
networks increase research online, followed by purchase offline (sometimes referred 
to as ROPO), driving purchase traffic into physical stores where the product can be 
seen, tried, and then purchased. This is the opposite of the showrooming effect where 
consumers shop in stores, and then purchase online. The ROPO effect was found to 
be as large as the research offline and purchase online effect (Vision Critical, 2013; 
Schleifer, 2013; Sevitt and Samuel, 2013).
Membership in social networks has a large influence on discovering new indepen-
dent music, but less influence on already well-known products (Garg, 2009). Member-
ship in an online brand community like Ford’s Facebook page and community has a 
direct effect on sales (Adjei et al., 2009). Amazon’s recommender systems (“Consumers 
who bought this item also bought ...”) create co-purchase networks where people do 
not know one another personally, but nevertheless triple the influence of comple-
mentary products (Oestreicher-Singer and Sundararajan, 2008). The value of social 
networks to marketers rests on the proposition that brand strength and purchase 
decisions are closely related to network membership, rank, prominence, and centrality 
(Guo et al., 2011).
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MODELS
Once firms have an understanding of who is online, they need to focus on how con-
sumers behave online. The study of consumer behavior is a social science discipline 
that attempts to model and understand the behavior of humans in a marketplace. 
Several social science disciplines play roles in this study, including sociology, psychol-
ogy, and economics. Models of consumer behavior attempt to predict or “explain” what 
consumers purchase and where, when, how much, and why they buy. The expectation 
is that if the consumer decision-making process can be understood, firms will have a 
much better idea how to market and sell their products. Figure 6.1 illustrates a 
general consumer behavior model that takes into account a wide range of factors that 
influence a consumer’s marketplace decisions. Learning Track 6.2 contains further 
information about the cultural, social, and psychological background factors that influ-
ence consumer behavior.
PROFILES OF ONLINE CONSUMERS
Online consumer behavior parallels that of offline consumer behavior with some 
obvious differences. It is important to first understand why people choose the Internet 
channel to conduct transactions. Table 6.2 lists the main reasons consumers choose 
the online channel.
While price is an important consideration, consumers also shop online because 
of convenience, which in turn is produced largely by saving them time. Overall 
transaction cost reduction appears to be a major motivator for choosing the online 
channel.

THE ONLINE PURCHASING DECISION
Once online, why do consumers actually purchase a product or service at a specific 
site? Among the most important reasons are price and the availability of free shipping. 
That the seller is someone whom the purchaser trusts is also a very important factor.

The ability to make a purchase without paying tax and the availability of an online 
coupon are also significant factors.
You also need to consider the process that buyers follow when making a purchase 
decision, and how the Internet environment affects consumers’ decisions. There are 
five stages in the consumer decision process: awareness of need, search for more infor-
mation, evaluation of alternatives, the actual purchase decision, and post-purchase 
contact with the firm. Figure 6.2 shows the consumer decision process and the types 
of offline and online marketing communications that support this process and seek to 
influence the consumer before, during, and after the purchase decision.
The stages of the consumer decision process are basically the same whether the 
consumer is offline or online. On the other hand, the general model of consumer 
behavior requires modification to take into account new factors, and the unique fea-
tures of e-commerce that allow new opportunities to interact with the customer online 
also need to be accounted for. In Figure 6.3, we have modified the general model of 
consumer behavior to focus on user characteristics, product characteristics, and Web 
site and mobile platform features, along with traditional factors such as brand strength 
and specific market communications (advertising) and the influence of both online 
and offline social networks. 
In the online model, Web site and mobile platform features, along with consumer 
skills, product characteristics, attitudes towards online purchasing, and perceptions

about control over the online environment come to the fore. Web site and mobile 
platform features include latency (delay in downloads), navigability, and confidence 
in online security. There are parallels in the analog world. For instance, it is well 
known that consumer behavior can be influenced by store design, and that under-
standing the precise movements of consumers through a physical store can enhance 
sales if goods and promotions are arranged along the most likely consumer tracks. 
Consumer skills refers to the knowledge that consumers have about how to conduct 
online transactions (which increases with experience). Product characteristics refers 
to the fact that some products can be easily described, packaged, and shipped online, 
whereas others cannot. Combined with traditional factors, such as brand, advertising, 
and firm capabilities, these factors lead to specific attitudes about purchasing from an 
e-commerce firm (trust in the firm and favorable customer experience) and a sense 
that the consumer can control his or her environment online.
Clickstream behavior refers to the transaction log that consumers establish as 
they move about the Web, from search engine to a variety of sites, then to a single site, 
then to a single page, and then, finally, to a decision to purchase. These precious 
moments are similar to “point-of-purchase” moments in traditional retail. A study of 
over 10,000 visits to an online wine store found that detailed and general clickstream

FIGURE 6.3	
A MODEL OF ONLINE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
In this general model of online consumer behavior, the decision to purchase is shaped by background 
demographic factors, several intervening factors, and, finally, influenced greatly by clickstream behavior very 
near to the precise moment of purchase.

behavior were as important as customer demographics and prior purchase behavior 
in predicting a current purchase (Van den Poel and Buckinx, 2005). Clickstream mar-
keting takes maximum advantage of the Internet environment. It presupposes no prior 
“deep” knowledge of the customer (and in that sense is “privacy-regarding”), and can 
be developed dynamically as customers use the Internet. For instance, the success of 
search engine marketing (the display of paid advertisements by search engines) is 
based in large part on what the consumer is looking for at the moment and how they 
go about looking (detailed clickstream data). After examining the detailed data, general 
clickstream data is used (days since last visit, past purchases). If available, demo-
graphic data is used (region, city, and gender).
SHOPPERS: BROWSERS AND BUYERS
The picture of Internet use sketched in the previous section emphasizes the complex-
ity of behavior online. Although the Internet audience still tends to be concentrated 
among the well educated, affluent, and youthful, the audience is increasingly becom-
ing more diverse. Clickstream analysis shows us that people go online for many dif-
ferent reasons. Online shopping is similarly complex. Beneath the surface of the €1.96 
trillion B2C e-commerce market in 2015 are substantial differences in how users shop 
online.
Worldwide, about 1.4 billion people (about  45% of the Internet population) are 
“buyers” who actually purchase something online. In the United Kingdom, 88.2% of 
Internet users, age 14 and older, are buyers, while another 5.3% research products 
online (“browsers”), but purchase them offline (see Figure 6.4). With the teen and 
adult U.K. Internet audience (14 years or older) estimated at about 47 million in 2015, 
online shoppers (the combination of buyers and browsers, totalling almost 93.5%) add 
up to a market size of almost 44 million consumers. 
The significance of online browsing for offline purchasing should not be under-
estimated. Although it is difficult to precisely measure the amount of offline sales 
	
FIGURE 6.4	
ONLINE SHOPPERS AND BUYERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
Over 85% of U.K. Internet users, age 14 and older, shop online on desktop computers and mobile devices, 
either by researching products or by purchasing products online. The percentage of those actually

that occur because of online product research, Forrester Research estimates that U.S. 
Web-influenced retail sales will generate over $1.55 trillion in 2015, growing to around 
$1.8 trillion by 2018 (Forrester Research, 2014a). 
E-commerce is a major conduit and generator of offline commerce. The reverse 
is also true: online traffic is driven by offline brands and shopping. While online 
research influences offline purchases, it is also the case that offline marketing media 
heavily influence online behavior including sales. Traditional print media (magazines 
and newspapers) and television are by far the most powerful media for reaching and 
engaging consumers with information about new products and directing them to the 
Web. Online communities and blogging are also very influential but not yet as power-
ful as traditional media. This may be surprising to many given the attention to social 
networks as marketing vehicles, but it reflects the diversity of influences on consumer 
behavior and the real-world marketing budgets of firms that are still heavily dominated 
by traditional media. Even more surprising in the era of Facebook, face-to-face interac-
tions are a more powerful influence than participation in online social communities.
These considerations strongly suggest that e-commerce and traditional com-
merce are coupled and should be viewed by merchants (and researchers) as part of 
a continuum of consuming behavior and not as radical alternatives to one another. 
Commerce is commerce; the customers are often the same people. Customers use a 
wide variety of media, sometimes multiple media at once. The significance of these 
findings for marketers is very clear. Online merchants should build the information 
content of their sites to attract browsers looking for information, build content to rank 
high in search engines, put less attention on selling per se, and promote services and 
products (especially new products) in offline media settings in order to support their 
online stores.
WHAT CONSUMERS SHOP FOR AND BUY ONLINE
You can look at online sales as divided roughly into two groups: small-ticket and big-
ticket items. Big-ticket items include computer equipment and consumer electronics, 
where orders can easily be more than €1,000. Small-ticket items include apparel, books, 
health and beauty supplies, office supplies, music, software, videos, and toys, where 
the average purchase is typically less than €100. In the early days of e-commerce, 
sales of small-ticket items vastly outnumbered those of large-ticket items. But the 
recent growth of big-ticket items such as computer hardware, consumer electronics, 
furniture, and jewelry has changed the overall sales mix. Consumers are now much 
more confident spending online for big-ticket items. Although furniture and large 
appliances were initially perceived as too bulky to sell online, these categories have 
rapidly expanded in the last few years. Free shipping offered by Amazon and other 
large retailers has also contributed to consumers buying many more expensive and 
large items online such as air conditioners. Refer to Figure 1.10 to see how much 
consumers spent online for various categories of goods in 2014.
INTENTIONAL ACTS: HOW SHOPPERS FIND VENDORS ONLINE
Given the prevalence of “click here” display ads, one might think customers are 
“driven” to online vendors by spur-of-the-moment decisions. In fact, only a tiny 

386	
	
C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g 
percentage of shoppers click on display ads to find vendors. E-commerce shoppers are 
highly intentional. Typically, they are focused browsers looking for specific products, 
companies, and services. Once they are online, a majority of consumers use a search 
engine as their preferred method of research for purchasing a product. Many will go 
directly to a online marketplace, such as Amazon or eBay, and some will go directly 
to a specific retail Web site. Merchants can convert these “goal-oriented,” intentional 
shoppers into buyers if the merchants can target their communications to the shoppers 
and design their sites in such a way as to provide easy-to-access and useful product 
information, full selection, and customer service, and do this at the very moment the 
customer is searching for the product. This is no small task.
WHY SOME PEOPLE DON’T SHOP ONLINE
About 10% of Internet users do not shop or buy online. Why not? One of the most 
important factors cited by those who don’t shop or buy online is the “trust factor,” the 
fear that online merchants will cheat you, lose your credit card information, or use 
personal information you give them to invade your personal privacy, bombarding 
you with unwanted e-mail and pop-up ads. Secondary factors can be summarized 
as “hassle factors,” like shipping costs, returns, and inability to touch and feel the 
product.
TRUST, UTILITY, AND OPPORTUNISM IN ONLINE MARKETS
A long tradition of research shows that the two most important factors shaping the 
decision to purchase online are utility and trust (Brookings Institute, 2011; Kim et 
al., 2009; Ba and Pavlou, 2002). Consumers want good deals, bargains, convenience, 
and speed of delivery. In short, consumers are looking for utility. On the other 
hand, in any seller-buyer relationship, there is an asymmetry of information. The 
seller usually knows a lot more than the consumer about the quality of goods and 
terms of sale. This can lead to opportunistic behavior by sellers (Akerlof, 1970; Wil-
liamson, 1985; Mishra, 1998). Consumers need to trust a merchant before they make 
a purchase. Sellers can develop trust among online consumers by building strong 
reputations of honesty, fairness, and delivery of quality products—the basic elements 
of a brand. Feedback forums such as Epinions.com (now part of Shopping.com), 
Amazon’s book reviews from reviewers, and eBay’s feedback forum are examples of 
trust-building online mechanisms (NielsenWire, 2012; Opinion Research Corpora-
tion, 2009). Online sellers who develop trust among consumers are able to charge a 
premium price for their online products and services (Kim and Benbasat, 2006, 2007; 
Pavlou, 2002). A review of the literature suggests that the most important factors 
leading to a trusting online relationship are perception of Web site credibility, ease 
of use, and perceived risk (Corritore et al., 2006). An important brake on the growth 
of e-commerce is lack of trust. Newspaper and television ads are far more trusted 
than online ads (Nielsen, 2011). Personal friends and family are far more powerful 
determinants of online purchases than membership in social networks (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2010). These attitudes have grown more positive over time, but concerns about 
the use of personal information by online marketers continue to raise trust issues 
among consumers.

	 6.2 	 DIGITAL COMMERCE MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
STRATEGIES AND TOOLS 
Online marketing has many similarities to, and differences from, ordinary marketing. 
(For more information on basic marketing concepts, see Learning Tracks 6.1 and 6.2.) 
The objective of online marketing—as in all marketing—is to build customer relation-
ships so that the firm can achieve above-average returns (both by offering superior 
products or services and by communicating the brand’s features to the consumer). 
These relationships are a foundation for the firm’s brand. But online marketing is 
also very different from ordinary marketing because the nature of the medium and 
its capabilities are so different from anything that has come before. 
There are four features of online marketing that distinguish it from traditional 
marketing channels. Compared to traditional print and television marketing, online 
marketing can be more personalized, participatory, peer-to-peer, and communal. Not 
all types of online marketing have these four features. For instance, there’s not much 
difference between a marketing video splashed on your computer screen without 
your consent and watching a television commercial. However, the same marketing 
video can be targeted to your personal interests, community memberships, and allow 
you to share it with others using a Like or + tag. Marketers are learning that the most 
effective forms of online marketing have all four of these features. 
STRATEGIC ISSUES AND QUESTIONS 
In the past, the first step in building an online brand was to build a Web site, and then 
try to attract an audience. The most common “traditional” marketing techniques for 
establishing a brand and attracting customers were search engine marketing, display 
ads, e-mail campaigns, and affiliate programs. This is still the case: building a Web 
site is still a first step, and the “traditional” online marketing techniques are still the 
main powerhouses of brand creation and online sales revenue in 2015. But today, 
marketers need to take a much broader view of the online marketing challenge, and 
to consider other media channels for attracting an audience such as social media and 
mobile devices, in concert with traditional Web sites. 
The five main elements of a comprehensive multi-channel marketing plan are: 
Web site, traditional online marketing, social marketing, mobile marketing, and offline 
marketing. Table 6.3 illustrates these five main platforms, central elements within 
each type, some examples, and the primary function of marketing in each situation. 
Each of the main types of online marketing is discussed in this section and throughout 
the chapter in greater detail. 
Immediately, by examining Table 6.3, you can understand the management 
complexity of building brands online. There are five major types of marketing, and 
a variety of different platforms that perform different functions. If you’re a manager 
of a start-up, or the Web site manager of an existing commercial Web site, you face a 
number of strategic questions. Where should you focus first? Build a Web site, develop 
a blog, or jump into developing a Facebook presence? If you have a successful Web 
site that already uses search engine marketing and display ads, where should you go 

388	
	
C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g 
next: develop a social network presence or use offline media? Does your firm have 
the resources to maintain a social media marketing campaign? 
A second strategic management issue involves the integration of all these differ-
ent marketing platforms into a single coherent branding message. Often, there are 
different groups with different skill sets involved in Web site design, search engine 
and display marketing, social media marketing, and offline marketing. Getting all 
these different specialties to work together and coordinate their campaigns can be 
very difficult. The danger is that a firm ends up with different teams managing each 
of the four platforms rather than a single team managing the digital online presence, 
or for that matter, marketing for the entire firm including retail outlets. 
A third strategic management question involves resource allocation. There are 
actually two problems here. Each of the different major types of marketing, and each

of the different platforms, has different metrics to measure its effectiveness. In some 
cases, for new social marketing platforms, there is no commonly accepted metric, 
and few that have withstood critical scrutiny or have a deep experience base provid-
ing empirical data. For instance, in Facebook marketing, an important metric is how 
many Likes your Facebook page produces. The connection between Likes and sales 
is still being explored. In search engine marketing, effectiveness is measured by how 
many clicks your ads are receiving; in display advertising, by how many impressions 
of your ads are served. Second, each of these platforms has different costs for Likes, 
impressions, and clicks. In order to choose where your marketing resources should 
be deployed, you will have to link each of these activities to sales revenue. You will 
need to determine how much clicks, Likes, and impressions are worth. We address 
these questions in greater detail in Chapter 7. 
THE WEB SITE AS A MARKETING PLATFORM: ESTABLISHING THE 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP 
A firm’s Web site is a major tool for establishing the initial relationship with the 
customer. The Web site performs four important functions: establishing the brand 
identity and consumer expectations, informing and educating the consumer, shaping 
the customer experience, and anchoring the brand in an ocean of marketing messages 
coming from different sources. The Web site is the one place the consumer can turn 
to find the complete story. This is not true of apps, e-mail, or search engine ads. 
The first function of a Web site is to establish the brand’s identity and to act as an 
anchor for the firm’s other Web marketing activities, thereby driving sales revenue. 
This involves identifying for the consumer the differentiating features of the product 
or service in terms of quality, price, product support, and reliability. Identifying the 
differentiating features of the product on the Web site’s home page is intended to 
create expectations in the user of what it will be like to consume the product. For 
instance, Snapple’s Web site creates the expectation that the product is a delicious, 
refreshing drink made from high quality, natural ingredients. Ford’s Web site focuses 
on automobile technology and high miles per gallon. The expectation created by 
Ford’s Web site is that if you buy a Ford, you’ll be experiencing the latest automotive 
technology and the highest mileage. At the location-based social network Web site 
for Foursquare, the focus is on meeting friends, discovering local places, and saving 
money with coupons and rewards. 
Web sites also function to anchor the brand online, acting as a central point where 
all the branding messages that emanate from the firm’s multiple digital presences, 
such as Facebook, Twitter, mobile apps, or e-mail, come together at a single online 
location. Aside from branding, Web sites also perform the typical functions of any 
commercial establishment by informing customers of the company’s products and 
services. Web sites, with their online catalogs and associated shopping carts, are impor-
tant elements of the online customer experience. Customer experience refers to the 
totality of experiences that a customer has with a firm, including the search, informing, 
purchase, consumption, and after-sales support for the product. The concept “customer 
experience” is broader than the traditional concept of “customer satisfaction” in that 
a much broader range of impacts is considered, including the customer’s cognitive, 
customer experience 
the totality of experiences 
that a customer has with a 
firm, including the search, 
informing, purchase, 
consumption, and after-
sales support for its prod-
ucts, services, and various 
retail channels

affective, emotional, social, and physical relationship to the firm and its products. The 
totality of customer experiences will generally involve multiple retail channels. This 
means that, in the customer’s mind, the Web site, mobile site and apps, Facebook page, 
Twitter feed, physical store, and television advertisements are all connected as part 
of his or her experience with the company.
TRADITIONAL ONLINE MARKETING AND ADVERTISING TOOLS 
Below we describe the basic marketing and advertising tools for attracting e-commerce 
consumers: search engine marketing, display ad marketing (including banner ads, rich 
media ads, video ads, and sponsorships), e-mail and permission marketing, affiliate 
marketing, viral marketing, and lead generation marketing.
Companies will spend an estimated €521 billion on advertising in 2015, and an 
estimated €156 billion of that amount on online advertising, which includes display 
(banners, video, and rich media), search, mobile messaging, sponsorships, classifieds, 
lead generation, and e-mail, on desktop, laptop, and tablet computers, as well as mobile 
phones (see Figure 6.5) (eMarketer, Inc., 2015e).
In the last five years, advertisers have aggressively increased online spending and 
cut outlays on traditional channels. By 2018, the amount spent on online advertising 
is expected to exceed the amount spent on television advertising.

Table 6.4 provides some comparative data on the amount of spending for certain 
advertising formats in the United States. In 2015, the highest amount of spending is 
for paid search, followed by banner ads, but the fastest growing online ad formats are 
rich media and video ads. 
Spending on U.S. online advertising among different industries is somewhat 
skewed. Retail accounts for the highest percentage (21%), followed by financial ser-
vices (13%), automotive (12%), telecommunications (9%), leisure travel (9%), con-
sumer electronics and computers (7%), consumer packaged goods (6%), 
pharmaceuticals and healthcare (5%), media (5%), and entertainment (4%) (Interac-
tive Advertising Bureau/PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2015). Online advertising has both 
advantages and disadvantages when compared to advertising in traditional media, 
such as television, radio, and print (magazines and newspapers). One big advantage 
for online advertising is that the Internet is where the audience has moved, especially 
the very desirable 18–34 age group. A second big advantage for online advertising is 
the ability to target ads to individuals and small groups and to track performance of 
advertisements in almost real time. Ad targeting, the sending of market messages to 
specific subgroups in the population in an effort to increase the likelihood of a pur-
chase, is as old as advertising itself, but prior to the Internet, it could only be done 
with much less precision, certainly not down to the level of individuals. Ad targeting 
is also the foundation of price discrimination: the ability to charge different types of 
consumers different prices for the same product or service. With online advertising, 
it’s theoretically possible to charge every customer a different price. 
Theoretically, online advertising can personalize every ad message to precisely 
fit the needs, interests, and values of each consumer. In practice, as we all know 
from spam and constant exposure to ads that are of little interest, the reality is very

different. Online advertisements also provide greater opportunities for interactivity—
two-way communication between advertisers and potential customers. The primary 
disadvantages of online advertising are concerns about its cost versus its benefits, 
how to adequately measure its results, and the supply of good venues to display ads. 
For instance, the owners of Web sites who sell advertising space (“publishers”) do not 
have agreed-upon standards or routine audits to verify their claimed numbers as do 
traditional media outlets. We examine the costs and benefits of online advertising as 
well as research on its effectiveness in Section 6.4.
Search Engine Marketing and Advertising
In 2015, companies will spend an estimated €75 billion on search engine marketing 
and advertising, about 48% of all spending for digital marketing. Briefly, this is where 
the eyeballs are (at least for a few moments) and this is where advertising can be very 
effective by responding with ads that match the interests and intentions of the user. 
The click-through rate for search engine advertising is generally 1%–4% (with an 
average of around 2%) and has been fairly steady over the years. The top search engine 
throughout Western Europe is Google, with over a 90% market share. Search engine 
marketing (SEM) refers to the use of search engines to build and sustain brands. 
Search engine advertising refers to the use of search engines to support direct sales 
to online consumers. 
Search engines are often thought of as mostly direct sales channels focused 
on making sales in response to advertisements. While this is a major use of search 
engines, they are also used more subtly to strengthen brand awareness, drive traffic to 
other Web sites or blogs to support customer engagement, to gain deeper insight into 
customers’ perceptions of the brand, to support other related advertising (for instance, 
sending consumers to local dealer sites), and to support the brand indirectly. Search 
engines can also provide marketers insight into customer search patterns, opinions 
customers hold about their products, top trending search keywords, and what their 
competitors are using as keywords and the customer response. For example, Pepsico, 
home of mega brands like Pepsi and Doritos, makes no sales on the Web, but has 
several branding Web sites aimed at consumers, investors, and shareholders. The focus 
is on building, sustaining, and updating the Pepsi collection of branded consumer 
goods. A search on Pepsi will generate numerous search results that link to Pepsi 
marketing materials. 
Types of Search Engine Advertising  Search engine sites originally performed unbi-
ased searches of the Web’s huge collection of Web pages and derived most of their 
revenue from banner advertisements. This form of search engine results is often 
called organic search because the inclusion and ranking of Web sites depends on 
a more or less “unbiased” application of a set of rules (an algorithm) imposed by the 
search engine. Since 1998, search engine sites slowly transformed themselves into 
digital yellow pages, where firms pay for inclusion in the search engine index, pay 
for keywords to show up in search results, or pay for keywords to show up in other 
vendors’ ads.

Most search engines offer paid inclusion programs, which, for a fee, guarantee 
a Web site’s inclusion in its list of search results, more frequent visits by its Web 
crawler, and suggestions for improving the results of organic searching. Search engines 
claim that these payments—costing some merchants hundreds of thousands a year—do 
not influence the organic ranking of a Web site in search results, just inclusion in the 
results. However, it is the case that page inclusion ads get more hits, and the rank of 
the page appreciates, causing the organic search algorithm to rank it higher in the 
organic results.
Google claims that it does not permit firms to pay for their rank in the organic 
results, although it does allocate two to three sponsored links at the very top of their 
pages, albeit labeling them as “Sponsored Links.” Merchants who refuse to pay for 
inclusion or for keywords typically fall far down on the list of results, and off the first 
page of results, which is akin to commercial death.
Pay-per-click (PPC) search ads are the primary type of search engine advertis-
ing. In keyword advertising, merchants purchase keywords through a bidding process 
at search sites, and whenever a consumer searches for that word, their advertisement 
shows up somewhere on the page, usually as a small text-based advertisement on the 
right, but also as a listing on the very top of the page. The more merchants pay, the 
higher the rank and greater the visibility of their ads on the page. Generally, the search 
engines do not exercise editorial judgment about quality or content of the ads although 
they do monitor the use of language. In addition, some search engines rank the ads 
in terms of their popularity rather than merely the money paid by the advertiser so 
that the rank of the ad depends on both the amount paid and the number of clicks per 
unit time. Google’s keyword advertising program is called AdWords.
Network keyword advertising (context advertising), introduced by Google as its 
AdSense product in 2002, differs from the ordinary keyword advertising described previ-
ously. Publishers (Web sites that want to show ads) join these networks and allow the 
search engine to place “relevant” ads on their sites. The ads are paid for by advertisers 
who want their messages to appear across the Web. Google-like text messages are the 
most common. The revenue from the resulting clicks is split between the search engine 
and the site publisher, although the publisher gets much more than half in some cases. 
Search engine advertising is nearly an ideal targeted marketing technique: at 
precisely the moment that a consumer is looking for a product, an advertisement for 
that product is presented. Consumers benefit from search engine advertising because 
ads for merchants appear only when consumers are looking for a specific product. 
Thus, search engine advertising saves consumers cognitive energy and reduces search 
costs (including the cost of transportation needed to do physical searches for products). 
Because search engine marketing can be very effective, companies optimize their 
Web sites for search engine recognition. The better optimized the page is, the higher 
a ranking it will achieve in search engine result listings, and the more likely it will 
appear on the top of the page in search engine results. Search engine optimization 
(SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of Web pages with search engines by 
altering the content and design of the Web pages and site. By carefully selecting key 
words used on the Web pages, updating content frequently, and designing the site so

it can be easily read by search engine programs, marketers can improve the impact 
and return on investment in their Web marketing programs.
Google and other search engine firms make frequent changes to their search 
algorithms in order to improve the search results and user experience. Google, for 
instance, reportedly makes over 600 search engine changes in a year. Most are small 
unannounced tweaks. Recent major changes have included Panda, Penguin, Hum-
mingbird, Knowledge Graph, and an unnamed algorithm that has been nicknamed 
Mobilegeddon. Panda was introduced in 2011 in an effort to weed out low quality sites 
from search results. Those sites with thin content, duplicate content, content copied 
from elsewhere on the Web, and content that did not attract high-quality hits from 
other sources were systematically pushed down in the search results. Google intro-
duced Penguin in 2012 in an effort to punish Web sites and their SEO marketing firms 
who were manipulating links to their site in order to improve their rankings. The 
Google search engine rewards sites that have links from many other sites. What some 
marketers discovered is that Google could not tell the quality of these back links, and 
they began to manufacture links by putting their clients onto list sites, creating mul-
tiple blogs to link to their clients’ sites, and paying others to link to their clients’ sites. 
Penguin evaluates the quality of links to a site, and pushes down in the rankings those 
sites that have poor-quality back links. 
Many search engines are attempting to capture more of what the user intended, 
or might like to know about a search subject. This is often referred to as semantic 
search. Google introduced Hummingbird in September 2013. Rather than evaluate 
each word separately in a search, Google’s semantically informed Hummingbird will 
try to evaluate an entire sentence. Semantic search more closely follows conversational 
search, or search as you would ordinarily speak it to another human being. 
Google introduced Knowledge Graph in 2012 as an effort to anticipate what you 
might want to know more about as you search on a topic or answer questions you 
might not thought of asking. Since 2013, results of Knowledge Graph appear on the 
right of the screen and contain more information about the topic or person you are 
searching on. Not all search terms have a Knowledge Graph result. Google displays 
information based on what other users have searched for in the past, as well as its 
database on over 1 billion objects (people, places, and things), and more than 18 billion 
facts. 
In April 2015, Google released a new algorithm update (nicknamed Mobileged-
don) that made the “mobile-friendliness” of Web sites a much stronger ranking factor 
for mobile searches. Web sites that are not optimized for mobile now have a much 
lower ranking in mobile search results. And starting in November 2015, Google has 
announced that it will lower the search rank of mobile Web sites that display an ad 
that obscures the screen and asks users whether they would like to install the site’s 
mobile app, on the grounds that such ads are less mobile-friendly. Companies that 
use such ads, such as Yelp, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and others, have charged that Google’s 
new policy is in part an effort to protect its Web search revenue from mobile apps that 
lure users away from the Web.

social graph) to provide search results. In contrast to search engines that use a

mathematical algorithm to find pages that satisfy your query, social search reviews 
your friends’ (and their friends’) recommendations, past Web visits, and use of Like 
buttons. One problem with traditional search engines is that they are so thorough: 
enter a search for “smartphone” on Google and in .28 seconds you will receive 569 
million results, some of which provide helpful information and others that are 
suspect. Social search is an effort to provide fewer, more relevant, and trustworthy 
results based on the social graph. Facebook’s first effort to create a social search 
engine was Facebook Graph Search, which it launched in 2013. Graph Search pro-
duced information from within a user’s network of friends supplemented with addi-
tional results provided by Bing. In December 2014, Facebook introduced a series of 
changes to Graph Search, dropping its relationship with Bing, rebranding the product 
as Facebook Search, and providing keyword search functionality that enables users 
to find people, photos, posts, videos, and links on Facebook by searching for words 
within a post. Results are ranked using a personalization algorithm based in part on 
the user’s relationship to the poster.
Search Engine Issues  While search engines have provided significant benefits to mer-
chants and customers, they also present risks and costs. For instance, search engines 
have the power to crush a small business by placing its ads on the back pages of search 
results. Merchants are at the mercy of search engines for access to the online market-
place, and this access is dominated by a single firm, Google. How Google decides to 
rank one company over another in search results is not known. No one really knows 
how to improve in its rankings (although there are hundreds of firms who claim oth-
erwise). Google editors intervene in unknown ways to punish certain Web sites and 
reward others. Using paid sponsored listings, as opposed to relying on organic search 
results, eliminates some, but not all, of this uncertainty. 
Other practices that degrade the results and usefulness of search engines include:
•	 Link farms are groups of Web sites that link to one another, thereby boosting their 
ranking in search engines that use a PageRank algorithm to judge the “usefulness” 
of a site. For instance, in the 2010 holiday season, JCPenney was found to be the 
highest ranked merchant for a large number of clothing products. On examination, 
it was discovered that this resulted from Penney’s hiring a search engine optimiza-
tion company to create thousands of Web sites that linked to JCPenney’s Web site. 
As a result, JCPenney’s Web site became the most popular (most linked-to) Web 
site for products like dresses, shirts, and pants. No matter what popular clothing 
item people searched for, JCPenney came out on top. Experts believe this was the 
largest search engine fraud in history. Google’s Panda series of updates to its search 
algorithms were aimed in part at eliminating link farms (Castell, 2014).
•	 Content farms are companies that generate large volumes of textual content for 
multiple Web sites designed to attract viewers and search engines. Content farms 
profit by attracting large numbers of readers to their sites and exposing them to ads. 
The content typically is not original but is artfully copied or summarized from 
legitimate content sites.
•	 Click fraud occurs when a competitor clicks on search engine results and ads, forcing 
the advertiser to pay for the click even though the click is not legitimate. Competitors

can hire offshore firms to perform fraudulent clicks or hire botnets to automate the 
process. Click fraud can quickly run up a large bill for merchants, and not result in 
any growth in sales. A study by the National Association of Advertisers estimated that 
advertisers would lose $6.3 billion in 2015 due to click fraud (Kirk, 2015).
Display Ad Marketing
In 2015, companies will spend around €68 billion on all forms of display ad marketing, 
about 44% of all spending for digital marketing. Around 6 trillion display ads will be 
served on desktop and mobile devices in 2015. The top five display ad companies in 
the United States are Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and AOL, and together they 
account for 51% of U.S. display ad revenue. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), 
an industry organization, has established voluntary industry guidelines for display ads. 
Publishers are not required to use these guidelines, but many do. One objective of IAB 
is to give the consumer a consistent experience across all Web sites. The various types 
of ads are designed to help advertisers break through the “noise” and clutter created by 
the high number of display ad impressions that a typical user is exposed to within a 
given day. Figure 6.6 shows examples of the seven core standard ad units, as specified 
by the IAB. According to Google, the top performing ad formats are the large rectangle, 
the medium rectangle, the leaderboard, and the half-page (Google Inc., 2015). Display 
ads consist of four different kinds of ads: banner ads, rich media ads (animated ads), 
sponsorships, and video ads.
Banner Ads  Banner ads are the oldest and most familiar form of display marketing. 
They are also the least effective and the lowest cost form of online marketing. A 
banner ad displays a promotional message in a rectangular box on the screen of a 
desktop computer or mobile device. A banner ad is similar to a traditional ad in a 
printed publication but has some added advantages. When clicked, it brings potential 
customers directly to the advertiser’s Web site, and the site where the ad appears 
can observe the user’s behavior on the site. The ability to identify and track the user 
is a key feature of online advertising. Banner ads often feature video and other 
animations. It’s important to note that, although the terms banner ad and display ad 
are often used interchangeably, banner ads are just one form of display ad. Despite 
their limited effectiveness, advertisers will still spend about $12.1 billion on banner 
ads in 2015, about 44% of all spending on display ads, and 21% of total online ad 
spending.
Rich Media Ads  Ads that employ animation, sound, and interactivity, using Flash, 
HTML5, Java, and JavaScript are referred to as rich media ads. They are far more 
effective than simple banner ads. For instance, one research report that analyzed 
24,000 different rich media ads with more than 12 billion impressions served in North 
America over a six-month period found that exposure to rich media ads boosted adver-
tiser site visits by nearly 300% compared to standard banner ads. Viewers of rich media 
ads that included video were six times more likely to visit the advertiser’s Web site, 
by either directly clicking on the ad, typing the advertiser’s URL, or searching

(MediaMind, 2012a). Recent research by the IAB indicates that its Rising Star ad units 
that can incorporate rich media elements deliver a 30% stronger brand lift than the 
traditional IAB core display ads with just one full exposure, increasing to over 40% 
when a consumer interacts with the ad. Rising Star ads also topped traditional display 
ads in terms of ad recall and were considered less annoying (IAB, 2015).
The IAB provides guidance for a number of different types of rich media ads, such 
as those that contain in-banner video, those that are expandable/retractable, pop-ups, 
floating versions, and interstitials. An interstitial ad (interstitial means “in between”) 
is a way of placing a full-page message between the current and destination pages of 
a user. Interstitials are usually inserted within a single Web site, and displayed as the

user moves from one page to the next. The interstitial is typically contained in its own 
browser window and moves automatically to the page the user requested after allowing 
enough time for the ad to be read. Interstitials can also be deployed over an advertising 
network and appear as users move among Web sites. 
Because the Web is such a busy place, people have to find ways to cope with over-
stimulation. One means of coping is known as sensory input filtering. This means that 
people learn to filter out the vast majority of the messages coming at them. Internet 
users quickly learn at some level to recognize banner ads or anything that looks 
like a banner ad and to filter out most of the ads that are not exceptionally relevant. 
Interstitial messages, like TV commercials, attempt to make viewers a captive of the 
message. Typical interstitials last 10 seconds or less and force the user to look at the 
ad for that time period. IAB standards for pre-roll ads also limit their length. To avoid 
boring users, ads typically use animated graphics and music to entertain and inform 
them. A good interstitial will also have a “skip through” or “stop” option for users who 
have no interest in the message. 
The IAB also provides mobile rich media ad interface definitions (MRAID) in an 
effort to provide a set of standards designed to work with HTML5 and JavaScript that 
developers can use to create rich media ads to work with apps running on different 
mobile devices. The hope is make it easier to display ads across a wide variety of 
devices without having to rewrite code (Interactive Advertising Bureau, 2012).
Video Ads  Online video ads are TV-like advertisements that appear as in-page video 
commercials or before, during, or after a variety of content. Table 6.5 describes some 
of the IAB standards for video ads. The most widely used format is the “pre-roll” (fol-
lowed by the mid-roll and the post-roll) where users are forced to watch a video ad 
either before, in the middle of, or at the end of the video they originally clicked on. 
In 2014, the IAB released additional standards for five new in-stream and linear interac-
tive video ad formats that enable advertisers to provide additional opportunities for

Although from a total spending standpoint, online video ads are still very small 
when compared to the amount spent on search engine advertising, video ads are 
another fast growing form of online advertisement. The rapid growth in video ads 
is due in part to the fact that video ads are far more effective than other display ad 
formats. For instance, according to research analyzing a variety of ad formats, in-
stream video ads had click-through rates 12 times that of rich media and 27 times that 
of standard banner ads (MediaMind, 2012). Research by the IAB indicates that interac-
tive digital video has even greater impact than typical, non-interactive video formats, 
with interaction rates three to four times higher, and brand awareness heightened by 
more than 50% (Interactive Advertising Bureau, 2014).
There are many specialized video advertising networks that run video advertis-
ing campaigns for national advertisers and place these videos on their respective 
networks of Web sites. Firms can also establish their own video and television sites to 
promote their products. Retail sites are among the largest users of advertising videos. 
For instance, Zappos, the largest online shoe retailer, has a video for every one of its 
over 100,000 products.
Sponsorships  A sponsorship is a paid effort to tie an advertiser’s name to particular 
information, an event, or a venue in a way that reinforces its brand in a positive yet 
not overtly commercial manner. Sponsorships typically are more about branding 
than immediate sales. A common form of sponsorship is targeted content (or adver-
torials), in which editorial content is combined with an ad message to make the 
message more valuable and attractive to its intended audience. For instance, WebMD, 
the leading medical information Web site in the United States, displays sponsored 
pages on the WebMD Web site from companies such as Phillips to describe its home 
defibrillators, and Lilly to describe its pharmaceutical solutions for attention deficit 
disorders among children. Social media sponsorships, in which marketers pay for 
mentions in social media, such as blogs, tweets, or in online video, have also become 
a popular tactic. Sponsorships have also moved onto the mobile platform. For 
instance, Subaru sponsors an app called MapMyDogwalk, a GPS-enabled dog walking 
tool.
Native Advertising  Advertising that looks similar to editorial content is known as 
native advertising. Native advertising is not new. Traditional native advertising 
includes television infomercials, newspaper advertorials, and entire sections of 
newspapers and magazines that are given over to advertisers, where the advertising 
looks similar to the rest of the publication. In the online world, native ads are most 
often found on social media, especially mobile social media, as part of a Facebook 
Newsfeed, Twitter Timeline, or Pinterest Promoted Pin. Mobile social networks do 
not have room for ads on the right side of the screen (the sidebar or right rail), and 
therefore native ads in the form of posts that look like other posts are the favored 
option. 
Typically, native ads mimic the editorial content around them. They appear 
outside  the normal or expected area for ads and are labeled to indicate they are not 
editorial content, although in most cases the word “ad” is not used. On the Web or

mobile screens, native ads are usually distinguished by a “sponsored” tag underneath 
the headline, often in a different color. Online native advertising is growing rapidly, 
especially on social networks. In 2015, native ad spending is expected to reach $4.3 
billion (eMarketer, Inc., 2015f). Federal Trade Commission researchers found that 73% 
of online publishers offer native advertising, including the New York Times, which 
began the practice in 2014. 
Researchers have found that 35% of online consumers cannot distinguish between 
editorial content and sponsored ads that look like editorial content, even if the ads are 
labelled as sponsored or promoted. Most consumers do not know what sponsored or 
promoted means. In a survey of 10,000 consumers, researchers found that consumers 
skip over labels like sponsored, and many do not understand the difference between 
paid and unpaid content (Franklin, 2013). Yet market researchers have found that 
native ads are far more influential with consumers. Consumers look at native ads 
53% more frequently than display ads; native ads raise purchase intent by 18%; and 
consumers are twice as likely to share a native ad with a family member as a regular 
ad. Marketers and advertisers are opposed to labeling native advertising with the word 
“ad” and instead prefer other tags. 
Native advertising is controversial. Critics contend that the purpose of native 
ads is to deceive or fool the consumer into thinking the ad has the same validity as 
the editorial content in media. The Federal Trade Commission held a conference in 
December 2013 to explore the native advertising phenomenon because of the potential 
to deceive consumers. Although the FTC has not as yet issued any specific guidelines 
with respect to native advertising, it has indicated that if publishers are involved 
in creating native advertising content, they can potentially be held liable for that 
content if it is misleading to consumers. Traditionally, the FTC has not held publishers 
responsible for misleading ads placed by advertisers (Lewis, 2015). Supporters argue 
that native ads add value by helping consumers, advertisers, and the media in which 
they are used (Federal Trade Commission, 2013). 
Content Marketing  Native advertising is usually focused on partnering with a specific 
publisher. Content marketing creates a content campaign for a brand and then tries 
to secure placement on a variety of Web site. Examples of content include articles, 
infographics, case studies, interactive graphics, white papers and even traditional press 
releases. The aim of content marketing is to increase visitors to a company’s Web site, 
organic search rankings, and brand engagement via social media (Libert, 2015). 
Advertising Networks  In the early years of e-commerce, firms placed ads on the few 
popular Web sites in existence, but by early 2000, there were hundreds of thousands 
of sites where ads could be displayed, and it became very inefficient for a single firm 
to purchase ads on each individual Web site. Most firms, even very large firms, did not 
have the capability by themselves to place banner ads and marketing messages on 
thousands of Web sites and monitor the results. Specialized marketing firms called 
advertising networks appeared to help firms take advantage of the powerful market-
ing potential of the Internet, and to make the entire process of buying and selling

online ads more efficient and transparent. These ad networks have proliferated and 
have greatly increased the scale and liquidity of online marketing. 
Advertising networks represent the most sophisticated application of Internet 
database capabilities to date, and illustrate just how different Internet marketing 
is from traditional marketing. Advertising networks sell advertising and marketing 
opportunities (slots) to companies who wish to buy exposure to an online audience 
(advertisers). Advertising networks obtain their inventory of ad opportunities from 
a network of participating sites that want to display ads on their sites in return for 
receiving a payment from advertisers everytime a visitor clicks on an ad. These sites 
are usually referred to as Web publishers. Marketers buy audiences and publishers sell 
audiences by attracting an audience and capturing audience information. Ad networks 
are the intermediaries who make this market work efficiently. 
Figure 6.7 illustrates how these systems work. Advertising networks begin with a 
consumer requesting a page from a member of the advertising network (1). A connec-
tion is established with the third-party ad server (2). The ad server identifies the user 
by reading the cookie file on the user’s hard drive and checks its user profile database 
for the user’s profile (3). The ad server selects an appropriate banner ad based on the 
user’s previous purchases, interests, demographics, or other data in the profile (4). 
Whenever the user later goes online and visits any of the network member sites, the

ad server recognizes the user and serves up the same or different ads regardless of 
the site content. The advertising network follows users from site to site through the 
use of Web tracking files (5). 
Advertising Exchanges, Programmatic Advertising, Real-Time Bidding  Today, most 
online display advertising is being delivered by ad exchanges that use programmatic 
advertising and real-time bidding. An ad exchange is a digital marketplace that uses 
an automated auction-based method known as programmatic advertising to match 
supply and demand of online display advertising. Programmatic advertising uses a 
real-time bidding (RTB) process to match advertiser demand for display ads with 
publisher supply of Web page space. Publishers are able to sell their inventory of empty 
Web pages, often excess inventory that could not be sold directly. Want to contact 
males age 18 to 34, recent visitors to a car site, unmarried, high risk-taking profile, 
located in New York or California, urban home, and financial service industry employ-
ment? An ad exchange will allow you to bid in real time on this audience against other 
advertisers, and then manage the placement of ads, accounting, and measurement for 
your firm. Ad exchanges offer tremendous global scale and efficiency. One of the best 
known is Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange, which is based on more than 100 ad 
networks (the supply side), and provides a computer-based market for buyers to 
purchase audiences (the demand side). This exchange sells audiences sliced into 1,600 
interest categories. It displays more than 300 billion ad impressions a month across 2 
million Web sites worldwide, and maintains or distributes more than 500 million user 
profiles of Internet users (Kantrowitz, 2013, 2015). These profiles are based on Web 
tracking files, offline purchase information, and social network data. Marketing firms, 
the buyers from publishers of Web sites, can target their audience and control the 
frequency and timing of ads during the day. The case study at the end of the chapter, 
Programmatic Advertising: Real Time Marketing, provides you with a further look at ad 
exchanges and real-time bidding.
Display Advertising Issues  As with search engine advertising, online display advertis-
ing is not without its issues, which include both ad fraud (similar to click fraud) and 
concerns about viewability (whether display ads are actually being seen).
Ad Fraud.  According to Interactive Advertising Bureau estimates, about 36% 
of all Web traffic is fake, and by extension, about the same percentage of clicks on ads 
are fake as well (Vranica, 2014). A study by the Association of National Advertisers 
and security company White Ops estimated that €5.7 billion will be lost worldwide as 
a result of ad fraud in 2015 (Kantrowitz, 2015). There are four primary sources of ad 
fraud. Botnets can be hired by publishers to click on their Web pages to create phony 
traffic. Second, a browser extension can insert ads into a premium publisher’s Web 
site, and then list the ads as available on a programmatic ad exchange. Third, ad target-
ing firms can create bots that imitate the behavior of real shoppers, and then charge 
advertisers for successfully targeting consumers. Fourth, if you are a publisher looking 
to attract ads to your site, the simplest technique is simply to hire people in low-wage 
countries to click on your ads using a proxy server (Kantrowitz, 2014).

403
Large advertisers have begun to hire online fraud detection firms (a growth indus-
try) to determine the extent of fraud in their campaigns. Verizon Wireless, L’Oreal, 
and Kellogg are among the firms that found millions of dollars of ad fraud in recent 
campaigns, and have demanded advertising networks to either reimburse them or 
generate real Web traffic in the amount of the fraud. 
Viewability.  Recent research by Google revealed that 56% of the impressions 
served across its display advertising platforms, including DoubleClick, are not view-
able. Previous research by comScore showed similar results: 54% of display ads, and 
57% of video ads, were not in fact seen by people, even though advertisers were 
charged for generating ad impressions and serving ads (comScore, 2013). There are 
a number of reasons for this situation. First, there is no mechanism for measuring 
how many people actually see an online ad that has been served. The same is true 
of most offline print and TV advertising, although several methods and certifications 
have been developed over decades to accurately measure audience exposure. There 
are no such mechanisms for online advertising. Second, a large percentage of ads 
served appear lower down on the screen where users are less likely to go, or video 
ads on auto-play are playing in areas the user cannot see. Advertisers are still charged 
for ads that are served but not viewed. Unscrupulous publishers can place multiple 
ads on top of each other and charge multiple times for the same page space (Segal, 
2014). Third, botnets can be programmed to click on ads on fraudulent Web sites, 
generating impressions and ad serves, but no one actually sees the ads. The Media 
Rating Council, an advertising industry group, released a very low standard for “view-
ability” in 2014: an ad is considered viewable if half of the ad can be viewed for at 
least one second. For video ads, half of the video needs to be viewable for two seconds 
(Hof, 2014). A revised version of the guidelines issued in August 2015 addressed some 
additional specific issues, but did not alter the baseline standard. The advertisers 
who pay for online ads are beginning to demand guarantees of viewability. Several 
companies, including comScore, are offering tagging technology that can partially 
measure viewability (Vranica, 2014). Unviewed ads are just as profitable as viewed 
ads for Web publishers and advertising agencies. For advertisers, they represent the 
half of marketing expenditures that is wasted. 
Ad Blocking.  Over the past several years, use of ad-blocking software, which 
can eliminate display ads, pre-roll video ads, retargeted ads, and some types of native 
ads on desktops and laptops, has been growing. Ad blockers operate in a manner very 
similar to a firewall, recognizing and eliminating content based on IP address. Ad 
blockers have become very easy to install, with programs such as Adblock Plus offered 
as extensions for Firefox, Chrome, and other Web browsers. Currently, about 10% to 
15% of Internet users in the United States are estimated to be employing ad blockers, 
with their most prevalent use among the younger, more technically advanced audi-
ence. Gaming, newsgroup/forums, and social network sites are the most frequently 
affected by ad-blocking. Although advertisers are not yet panicked about ad blocking, 
it is a trend that they are watching with increasing concern. Some Web sites, such as 
Wired, The Guardian, and OKCupid have made a direct appeal to their users to turn 
off their ad-blockers or to make a donation instead.

E-mail Marketing 
When e-mail marketing began, unsolicited e-mail was not common. Direct e-mail 
marketing (e-mail marketing messages sent directly to interested users) was one of 
the first and most effective forms of online marketing communications. Direct e-mail 
marketing messages are sent to an opt-in audience of Internet users who, at one time 
or another, have expressed an interest in receiving messages from the advertiser. By 
sending e-mail to an opt-in audience, advertisers are targeting interested consumers. 
By far, in-house e-mail lists are more effective than purchased e-mail lists. Because of 
the comparatively high response rates and low cost, direct e-mail marketing remains 
a common form of online marketing communications. Other benefits of e-mail market-
ing include its mass reach, the ability to track and measure response, the ability to 
personalize content and tailor offers, the ability to drive traffic to Web sites for more 
interaction, the ability to test and optimize content and offers, and the ability to target 
by region, demographic, time of day, or other criteria. In 2015, although companies 
will spend a relatively small amount on e-mail marketing when compared to search 
and display ad marketing, e-mail marketing still packs a punch with solid customer 
response. Click-through rates for legitimate e-mail depend on the promotion (the 
offer), the product, and the amount of targeting, but average around 3%–4%. Despite 
the deluge of spam mail, e-mail remains a highly cost-effective way of communicating 
with existing customers, and to a lesser extent, finding new customers. Mobile devices 
have become the predominant method for accessing e-mail. A survey by Movable Ink 
showed that 67% of all email sent on its platform in the first quarter of 2015 were 
opened on a smartphone or tablet computer, while only 33% were opened on a desktop 
or laptop (Silverpop, 2015; eMarketer, Inc., 2015g).
E-mail marketing and advertising is inexpensive and somewhat invariant to the 
number of mails sent. The cost of sending 1,000 e-mails is about the same as the cost 
to send 1 million. The primary cost of e-mail marketing is for the purchase of the list 
of names to which the e-mail will be sent. This generally costs anywhere from 5 to 20 
cents a name, depending on how targeted the list is. Sending the e-mail is virtually 
cost-free. In contrast, the cost to acquire the name, print, and mail a 5 x 7-inch direct 
mail post card is around 75 to 80 cents a name. 
While e-mail marketing often is sales-oriented, it can also be used as an integral 
feature of a multi-channel marketing campaign designed to strengthen brand recogni-
tion. Personalization and targeting are major themes in e-mail marketing in 2015. For 
instance, Jeep created an e-mail campaign to a targeted audience who had searched on 
SUVs, and visited Chrysler and Jeep Facebook pages. The e-mail campaign announced 
a contest based on a game users could play online that involved tracking an arctic 
beast with a Jeep. Recipients could sign up on Facebook, Twitter, or the Jeep blog.
Although e-mail can still be an effective marketing and advertising tool, it faces 
three main challenges: spam, software tools used to control spam that eliminate much 
e-mail from user inboxes, and poorly targeted purchased e-mail lists. Spam is unso-
licited commercial e-mail (sometimes referred to as “junk” e-mail) and spammers are 
people who send unsolicited e-mail to a mass audience that has not expressed any 
interest in the product. Spammers tend to market pornography, fraudulent deals and 
services, scams, and other products not widely approved in most civilized societies.

Legitimate direct opt-in e-mail marketing is not growing as fast as behaviorally targeted 
display ads and search engine advertising because of the explosion in spam. Consumer 
response to even legitimate e-mail campaigns has become more sophisticated. In 
general, e-mail works well for maintaining customer relationships but poorly for 
acquiring new customers. 
While click fraud may be the Achilles’ heel of search engine advertising, spam is 
the nemesis of effective e-mail marketing and advertising. The percentage of all e-mail 
that is spam averaged around 52.5% in the first 7 months of 2015, down about 10% 
from the comparable period in 2014 (Symantec, 2015). Most spam originates from bot 
networks, which consist of thousands of captured PCs that can initiate and relay spam 
messages (see Chapter 4). Spam volume has declined somewhat since authorities took 
down the Rustock botnet in 2011. Spam is seasonally cyclical, and varies monthly due 
to the impact of new technologies (both supportive and discouraging of spammers), 
new prosecutions, and seasonal demand for products and services. 
Legislative attempts in the United States to control spam have been mostly unsuc-
cessful. Thirty-seven states have laws regulating or prohibiting spam (National Confer-
ence of State Legislatures, 2015). State legislation typically requires that unsolicited 
mail (spam) contain a label in the subject line (“ADV”) indicating the message is an 
advertisement, requires a clear opt-out choice for consumers, and prohibits e-mail that 
contains false routing and domain name information (nearly all spammers hide their 
own domain, ISP, and IP address).
The U.S. Congress passed the first national anti-spam law (“Controlling the 
Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing” or CAN-SPAM Act) in 2003, 
and it went into effect in January 2004. The act does not prohibit unsolicited e-mail 
(spam) but instead requires unsolicited commercial e-mail messages to be labeled 
(though not by a standard method) and to include opt-out instructions and the 
sender’s physical address. It prohibits the use of deceptive subject lines and false 
headers in such messages. The FTC is authorized (but not required) to establish a “Do 
Not E-mail” registry. State laws that require labels on unsolicited commercial e-mail 
or prohibit such messages entirely are pre-empted, although provisions merely 
addressing falsity and deception may remain in place. The act imposes fines of $10 
for each unsolicited pornographic e-mail and authorizes state attorneys general to 
bring lawsuits against spammers. The act obviously makes lawful legitimate bulk 
mailing of unsolicited e-mail messages (what most people call spam), yet seeks to 
prohibit certain deceptive practices and provide a small measure of consumer control 
by requiring opt-out notices. In this sense, critics point out, CAN-SPAM ironically 
legalizes spam as long as spammers follow the rules. For this reason, large spammers 
have been among the bill’s biggest supporters, and consumer groups have been the 
act’s most vociferous critics.
In contrast, Canada’s anti-spam law is one of the toughest in the world. Unlike the 
CAN-SPAM Act, Canada’s law is based on an opt-in model and prohibits the sending of 
commercial e-mail, texts, and social media messaging unless the recipient has given 
his or her consent. Violations of the law can lead to penalties of up to $1 million for 
individuals and $10 million for organizations. The first phase of the law went into effect 
in July 2014. The law applies anytime a computer within Canada is used to send or

access an electronic message, so companies located within the United States that send 
e-mail to Canada must comply with the law (French, 2014).
There have been a number of state and federal prosecutions of spammers, and 
private civil suits by large ISPs such as Microsoft. Volunteer efforts by industry are 
another potential control point. Notably, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), an 
industry trade group that represents companies that use the postal mail system as well 
as e-mail for solicitations, is now strongly supporting legislative controls over spam, 
in addition to its voluntary guidelines. The DMA would like to preserve the legitimate 
use of e-mail as a marketing technique. The DMA has formed a 15-person anti-spam 
group and spends $500,000 a year trying to identify spammers. The DMA is also a 
supporter of the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance (NCFTA), a nonprofit 
organization with close ties to the FBI. NCFTA operates a variety of initiatives aimed 
at combating cybercrime, including digital phishing via spam.
Affiliate Marketing 
Affiliate marketing is a form of marketing where a firm pays a commission, typically 
anywhere between 4% to 20%, to other Web sites (including blogs) for sending customers 
to their Web site. Affiliate marketing generally involves pay-for-performance: the affiliate 
or affiliate network gets paid only if users click on a link or purchase a product (Robin-
son, 2014). Industry experts estimate that around 10% of all retail online sales are gener-
ated through affiliate programs (as compared to search engine ads, which account for 
more than 30% of online sales), and affiliate programs run by the Internet Retailer Top 
500 have a median of 2,000 participating affiliates. 
Visitors to an affiliate Web site typically click on ads and are taken to the adver-
tiser’s Web site. In return, the advertiser pays the affiliate a fee, either on a per-click 
basis or as a percentage of whatever the customer spends on the advertiser’s site. 
Paying commissions for referrals or recommendations long predated the Web. 
For instance, Amazon has a strong affiliate program consisting of more than 1 
million participant sites, called Associates, which receive up to 10% in advertising 
fees on sales their referrals generate. Affiliates attract people to their blogs or Web 
sites where they can click on ads for products at Amazon. Members of eBay’s Affiliates 
Program can earn between 50% and 75% of eBay’s revenue on winning bids and Buy 
It Now transactions as well as between $20 and $35 for each active registered user sent 
to eBay. Amazon, eBay, and other large e-commerce companies with affiliate programs 
typically administer such programs themselves. Smaller e-commerce firms who wish 
to use affiliate marketing often decide to join an affiliate network (sometimes called 
an affiliate broker), such as CJ Affiliate and Rakuten Linkshare, which acts as an 
intermediary. Bloggers often sign up for Google’s AdSense program to attract advertis-
ers to their sites. They are paid for each click on an ad and sometimes for subsequent 
purchases made by visitors. 
Viral Marketing 
Just as affiliate marketing involves using a trusted Web site to encourage users to visit 
other sites, viral marketing is a form of social marketing that involves getting custom-
affiliate marketing 
commissions paid by 
advertisers to affiliate Web 
sites for referring potential 
customers to their Web site
viral marketing
the process of getting 
customers to pass along a 
company’s marketing 
message to friends, family, 
and colleagues

ers to pass along a company’s marketing message to friends, family, and colleagues. 
It’s the online version of word-of-mouth advertising, which spreads even faster and 
further than in the real world. In the offline world, next to television, word of mouth 
is the second most important means by which consumers find out about new products. 
And the most important factor in the decision to purchase is the face-to-face recom-
mendations of parents, friends, and colleagues. Millions of online adults in the United 
States are “influencers” who share their opinions about products in a variety of online 
settings. In addition to increasing the size of a company’s customer base, customer 
referrals also have other advantages: they are less expensive to acquire because exist-
ing customers do all the acquisition work, and they tend to use online support services 
less, preferring to turn back to the person who referred them for advice. Also, because 
they cost so little to acquire and keep, referred customers begin to generate profits for 
a company much earlier than customers acquired through other marketing methods. 
There are a number of online venues where viral marketing appears. E-mail used to 
be the primary online venue for viral marketing (“please forward this e-mail to your 
friends”), but venues such as Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and 
blogs now play a major role. For example, the most viral video ad of 2014 was a video 
featuring the singer Shakira that promoted the FIFA World Cup, with over 7.3 million 
shares and 560 million views as of August 2015 (Koerber, 2014). 
Lead Generation Marketing
Lead generation marketing uses multiple e-commerce presences to generate leads 
for businesses who later can be contacted and converted into customers through sales 
calls, e-mail, or other means. In one sense, all Internet marketing campaigns attempt 
to develop leads. But lead generation marketing is a specialized subset of the Internet 
marketing industry that provides consulting services and software tools to collect and 
manage leads for firms, and to convert these leads to customers. Companies will spend 
an estimated $2.2 billion on lead generation marketing in 2015. Sometimes called 
“inbound marketing,” lead generation marketing firms help other firms build Web sites, 
launch e-mail campaigns, use social network sites and blogs to optimize the generation 
of leads, and then manage those leads by initiating further contacts, tracking interac-
tions, and interfacing with customer relationship management systems to keep track of 
customer-firm interactions. One of the foremost lead generation marketing firms is 
Hubspot, which has developed a software suite for generating and managing leads. 
SOCIAL, MOBILE, AND LOCAL MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
In this section we provide a very brief overview of the social, mobile, and local market-
ing and advertising landscape. Then, in Chapter 7, we provide a much more in-depth 
examination of social, mobile, and local marketing and advertising tools. 
Social Marketing and Advertising
Social marketing/advertising involves the use of online social networks and com-
munities to build brands and drive sales revenues. There are several kinds of social 
networks, from Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, to social apps, social 
lead generation 
marketing
uses multiple e-commerce 
presences to generate 
leads for businesses who 
later can be contacted and 
converted into customers

games, blogs, and forums (Web sites that attract people who share a community of 
interests or skills). In 2015, companies are expected to spend about €23 billion on 
social network marketing and advertising. Next to mobile marketing, it is the fastest 
growing type of online marketing. Nevertheless, in 2015, it represents only about 15% 
of all online marketing and is still dwarfed by the amount spent on search engine 
advertising and display advertising (eMarketer, Inc., 2015h).
Marketers cannot ignore the huge audiences that social networks such as Face-
book, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram are gathering, which rival television and radio 
in size. In 2015, there were about 1.5 billion Facebook members, 320 million active 
Twitter users, around 400 million Instagram users, and around 100 million Pinterest 
members worldwide. It’s little wonder that marketers and advertisers are joyous at 
the prospect of connecting with this large audience. Research has found that social 
network users are more likely to talk about and recommend a company or product 
they follow on Facebook or Twitter.
Social networks offer advertisers all the main advertising formats, including 
banner ads (the most common), short pre-roll and post-roll ads associated with videos, 
and sponsorship of content. Having a corporate Facebook page is in itself a marketing 
tool for brands just like a Web page. Many firms, such as Coca-Cola, have shut down 
product-specific Web pages and instead use Facebook pages. 
Blogs and online games can also be used for social marketing. Blogs have been 
around for a decade and are a part of the mainstream online culture (see Chapter 2 for 
a description of blogs). Around 28 million people write blogs, and around 79 million 
read blogs in the United States. Blogs play a vital role in online marketing. Although 
more firms use Twitter and Facebook, these sites have not replaced blogs, and in fact 
often point to blogs for long-form content. Because blog readers and creators tend 
to be more educated, have higher incomes, and be opinion leaders, blogs are ideal 
platforms for ads for many products and services that cater to this kind of audience. 
Because blogs are based on the personal opinions of the writers, they are also an ideal 
platform to start a viral marketing campaign. Advertising networks that specialize in 
blogs provide some efficiency in placing ads, as do blog networks, which are collections 
of a small number of popular blogs, coordinated by a central management team, and 
which can deliver a larger audience to advertisers. For more information on social 
marketing using blogs, see Learning Track 6.3.
The online gaming marketplace continues to expand rapidly as users increasingly 
play games on smartphones and tablets, as well as PCs and consoles. The story of game 
advertising in 2015 is social, mobile, and local: social games are ascendant, mobile 
devices are the high-growth platform, and location-based advertising is starting to show 
real traction. The objective of game advertising is both branding and driving custom-
ers to purchase moments at restaurants and retail stores. In 2015, around 165 million 
Americans play games on their mobile phones, about 49 million play on consoles, while 
about 116 million play on tablets. Of the online gamers, about 86 million play social 
games, such as Jackbox Games’ You Don’t Know Jack. Advertisers are expected to spend 
about $310 million on in-game social game advertising in 2015 (eMarketer, Inc., 2015i).

Mobile Marketing and Advertising
Marketing on the mobile platform is growing rapidly and becoming a very significant 
part (42%) of the overall €156 billion online marketing spending. In 2015, spend-
ing on all forms of mobile marketing is estimated to be about €96 billion, and it 
is expected to almost double, to €182 billion, by 2019 (eMarketer, Inc., 2015e). A 
number of factors are driving advertisers to the mobile platform, including much 
more powerful devices, faster networks, wireless local networks, rich media and 
video ads, and growing demand for local advertising by small business and consum-
ers. Most important, mobile is where the eyeballs are now and increasingly will be 
in the future: about 2.25 billion people access the Internet at least some of the time 
from mobile devices.
Mobile marketing includes the use of display banner ads, rich media, video, 
games, e-mail, text messaging, in-store messaging, Quick Response (QR) codes, and 
couponing. Mobile is now a required part of the standard marketing budget. In 2015, 
display ads are expected to be the most popular mobile advertising format in the U.S., 
accounting for about 51% of all mobile ad spending. Display ads can be served as a 
part of a mobile Web site or inside apps and games. Facebook is the leader in mobile 
display ad revenues, followed by Google and Twitter. Search advertising is also a 
popular format, and is expected to account for about 44% of U.S. mobile ad spending 
in 2015. Search ads can be further optimized for the mobile platform by showing ads 
based on the physical location of the user. Mobile messaging generally involves SMS 
text messaging to consumers offering coupons or flash marketing messages. Messaging 
is especially effective for local advertising because consumers can be sent messages 
and coupons as they pass by or visit locations. Video advertising currently accounts 
for a small percentage of mobile ad spending, but is one of the fastest growing formats. 
Ad networks such as Google’s AdMob, Apple’s iAd, Twitter’s MoPub, inMobi (see the 
opening case), and Millennial Media are also important players in the mobile advertis-
ing market. 
Apps on mobile devices constitute a marketing platform that did not exist a 
few years ago. Apps are a nonbrowser pathway for users to experience the Web and 
perform a number of tasks from reading the newspaper to shopping, searching, and 
buying. Apps provide users much faster access to content than do multi-purpose 
browsers. Apps are also starting to influence the design and function of traditional 
Web sites as consumers are attracted to the look and feel of apps, and their speed of 
operation. There are over 3 million apps available on Apple’s App Store and Google 
Play and another million apps provided by Internet carriers and third-party storefronts 
like the Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and Appia. An estimated 2 billion people will use 
apps in 2015 worldwide (SocialMediaToday.com, 2013).
Local Marketing: The Social-Mobile-Local Nexus
Along with social marketing and mobile marketing, local marketing is the third major 
trend in e-commerce marketing in 2015–2016. The growth of mobile devices has 

410	
	
C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g 
accelerated the growth of local search and purchasing. New marketing tools like local 
advertisements on social networks and daily deal sites are also contributing to local 
marketing growth. 
Spending on online local ads in the United States is estimated at around $36 
billion in 2015. The mobile portion of local advertising spending is expected to reach 
$6.6 billion in 2015 (BIA/Kelsey, 2015a). In contrast, spending on traditional local 
advertising is expected to be flat during the same time period. The most common local 
marketing tools are geotargeting using Google Maps (local stores appearing on a Google 
map), display ads in hyperlocal publications like those created by Patch Properties, 
daily deals, and coupons. 
The most commonly used venues include Facebook, Google, Amazon Local, 
Linked­In, Yahoo, Bing, and Twitter, as well as more specific location-based offerings 
such as Google My Business, Yahoo Local, Citysearch, YP, SuperPages, and Yelp. The 
“daily deal” coupon sites, Groupon and LivingSocial, and location-based mobile firms 
such as Foursquare are also a significant part of this trend.
We examine social, mobile, and local marketing in much greater depth in 
Chapter 7. 
MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING: INTEGRATING ONLINE AND OFFLINE 
MARKETING 
Without an audience, marketing is not possible. With the rapid growth of the Internet, 
media consumption patterns have changed greatly as consumers are more and more 
likely to engage with online media, from videos and news sites, to blogs, Twitter feeds, 
Facebook friends, and Pinterest posts. Increasingly, marketers are using multiple 
online channels to “touch” customers, from e-mail to Facebook, search ads, display 
ads on mobile devices, and affiliate programs. Forrester Research reports, for instance, 
that most customers purchased online following some Web marketing influence, and 
nearly half of online purchases followed multiple exposures to Web marketing efforts 
(Forrester Research, 2014a). 
In 2013, for the first time ever, the average U.K. adult spent more time with digital 
media per day than the amount viewing TV. In 2015, the average U.K. adult will 
spend about 5 and a half hours a day online and using a mobile device for something 
other than telephone calls, compared to about three hours watching television (see 
Figure 6.8) (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). An increasing percentage of media consumers 
multitask by using several media at once in order to increase the total media exposure. 
In this environment, marketers increasingly are developing multi-channel marketing 
programs that can take advantage of the strengths of various media, and reinforce 
branding messages across media. Online marketing is not the only way, or by itself the 
best way, to engage consumers. Internet campaigns can be significantly strengthened 
by also using e-mail, TV, print, and radio. The marketing communications campaigns 
most successful at driving traffic to a Web site have incorporated both online and 
offline tactics, rather than relying solely on one or the other. Several research studies 
have shown that the most effective online advertisements are those that use consistent 
imagery with campaigns running in other media at the same time.

OTHER ONLINE MARKETING STRATEGIES
In addition to the “traditional” online marketing and advertising tools we have previ-
ously discussed, such as search engine, display, and e-mail marketing, and the newer 
social, mobile, and local marketing and advertising tools, there are also a number of 
other, more focused online marketing strategies. Here we examine tools aimed at 
customer retention, pricing, and a strategy known as the “long tail.” 
Customer Retention Strategies
The Internet offers several extraordinary marketing techniques for building a strong 
relationship with customers and for differentiating products and services.
Personalization, One-to-One Marketing, and Interest-based Advertising (Behavioral 
Targeting)  No Internet-based marketing technique has received more popular and 
academic comment than “one-to-one” or “personalized marketing.” One-to-one mar-
keting (personalization) segments the market on the basis of individuals (not 
one-to-one marketing 
(personalization) 
segmenting the market 
based on a precise and 
timely understanding of an 
individual’s needs, 
targeting specific 
marketing messages to 
these individuals, and then 
positioning the product 
vis-à-vis competitors to be 
truly unique

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
ARE THE VERY RICH DIFFERENT FROM YOU AND 
ME? 
“Let me tell you about the very rich. 
They are different from you and me.” 
So observed F. Scott Fitzgerald in the 
short story, “The Rich Boy.” Palm Beach 
has its Worth Avenue, New York has its 
Fifth Avenue, Los Angeles has its Rodeo Drive, and 
Chicago has the Magnificent Mile. So where do the 
rich go to get that $5,000 cocktail dress or that 
$3,000 Italian suit online? It turns out they may 
not be so different from the rest of us: they look for 
online deals and situations where quality can be had 
at a bargain. At Net-a-Porter, an online luxury brand 
store and content site, for instance, you can find a 
Gucci two-tone silk wrap dress for $1,750 that looks 
smashing with a pair of Gucci patent-leather knee 
boots for $1,595. There’s free shipping too! 
Even experts find it hard to define what it 
means to be affluent. There are about 24 million 
households (20% of all U.S. households) with 
household income of $100,000 or above. These 
are often referred to as HENRYs (High Earnings, 
Not Yet Rich). But the really affluent (sometimes 
called the hyperaffluent) are those 2.4 million (the 
top 2% of U.S. households) that earn more than 
$250,000 a year. And then there are the 9 million 
households (0.7% of households) that earn more 
than $1 million a year. These are the ultra-rich. 
Retail consumption in general is highly skewed: 
the wealthiest top 10% of households account for 
about 50% of all retail spending and over 35% of 
all e-commerce retail spending.  Wealthy Americans 
are opening their wallets to spend on expensive 
clothing, accessories, jewelry, and beauty products. 
In fact, in 2014, the United States replaced China 
as the leader in luxury spending around the world. 
The trend is continuing in 2015, with 42% of the 
hyperaffluent intending to purchase more luxury 
items than in 2014, along with about 33% of the 
HENRYs, with over 80% indicating they plan to 
purchase luxury products online. A 2015 McKin-
sey report notes what consumers hear or see online 
influences almost 50% of luxury product buying 
decisions.
One of the largest fashion destinations is Net-
a-Porter. Luxury goods designers would not even 
consider selling to the site when it initially launched 
in 2000. Affluent women in that period only bought 
clothes they had seen, touched and tried on. That 
all has changed in the last decade, and in 2014, 
Net-a-Porter had revenue of over $800 million. It 
currently sells over 400 of the world’s most fashion-
able high-end brands from Gucci to Tory Burch and 
Burberry and was also recently selected by Chanel 
as the exclusive online vendor for Chanel’s first fine 
jewelry collection. Net-a-Porter’s Web site has 9 
million visitors a month and it has 4 million follow-
ers on social media. The average customer is 39 
years old, travels 11 times a year, has an average 
income of $282,000, and spends $21,000 a year 
on clothing. On balance, these customers are at the 
low end of the truly affluent or at the top end of the 
HENRYs. In 2015, Net-a-Porter launched an app 
called the Net Set in an effort to create a mobile 
social commerce network for luxury consumers. The 
app will provide a live feed of trending luxury items, 
and provide each designer with its own mobile 
brand portal.
Even the rich are not immune to the lure of a 
good deal. The problem is that luxury retailers are 
typically loath to offer sales because they believe 
sales detract from their reputations. To get around 
this problem, luxury retailers often offer “secret” 
discounts via flash e-mail campaigns and private 
online sales in which selected online customers are 
e-mailed alerts. Neiman Marcus calls them Midday 
Dash sales: two-hour online-only sales with 50% 
off on luxury goods that can be purchased only by 
clicking a link in the e-mail.

Luxury retailers have another dilemma: they 
need to attract not just the ultra-affluent, but also 
the aspirational HENRYs who are far more numer-
ous and anxious to display their wealth. They need to 
be both exclusive and accessible. One solution is the 
so-called Mercedes Benz strategy: build luxurious 
but affordable cars for the HENRYs while main-
taining a focus on high-end truly luxury models for 
the ultra-affluent. Mercedes Benz combines a dual 
level product strategy with effective use of social 
and mobile media. Mercedes’ Facebook page is a 
main hub of interaction between the brand and its 
customers, with over 18 million fans entertained 
with sweepstakes, videos, images, news, and links to 
its blog for additional insight into why Mercedes is 
unique and worth all that money. Mercedes also uses 
Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and a dozen 
mobile apps to engage a broader range of customers 
by providing personalized video tours of its cars. 
The explosion of social media and the increas-
ing investments in the online channel by luxury com-
panies has reinforced and enlarged the community 
of those who explore, comment upon, and eventually 
purchase luxury goods. Luxury companies are more 
than doubling their fans on Facebook annually in 
recognition of the link between online and offline 
purchases. Burberry Group, the United Kingdom’s 
largest luxury goods maker, reports that it obtains 
the most reach and most response from digital 
initiatives compared with other media. To promote 
the Burberry Body fragrance, the London-based 
company offered exclusive samples to its Facebook 
fans. It received more than 225,000 requests in 
little more than a week.
Developing an online marketing approach that 
increases a company’s access to consumers while 
retaining an image of exclusivity was the challenge 
faced by Tiffany & Co. The company is in 
the enviable position of being perhaps the most 
famous jewelry company in the United States. 
Tiffany’s offline marketing communications seek 
to engender feelings of beauty, quality, and timeless 
style—all hallmarks of the Tiffany brand. How does 
Tiffany maintain its approach on the Web, a medium 
that often emphasizes speed and flashy graphics 
over grace and elegance, and low-cost bargains 
over high-priced exclusive fashion? The Web, for the 
most part, is all about low prices and great deals—
concepts that are anathema to the high-fashion 
merchants like Tiffany. The answer is apparent in a 
visit to the Tiffany Web site. The site features limited 
inventory, with a focus on high-resolution images 
of its exclusive and original designs in jewelry and 
apparel. There are no sales, coupons, discounts, or 
other offers although visitors can choose jewelry in 
lower price ranges (less than $250 for instance). 
The Web site and Facebook brand page reflect 
custom service and design, calm, and simplicity. 
The prices are equally exclusive: an exquisite Atlas 
Hinged Bangle in 18k rose gold and round brilliant 
diamonds for $9,000, and sunglasses for $500. 
Today, Tiffany has shifted more of its direct 
marketing effort from the offline catalog to the 
online catalog and an increasing social media pres-
ence, including Facebook (over 7 million Likes), 
Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube. 
It has Web sites in 13 different countries, including 
Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Austra-
lia. Tiffany sites carry over 2,100 products in six 
categories of goods: engagement, jewelry, watches, 
designers and collections, gifts, and accessories. In 
2014, Tiffany’s online sales were $256 million, 6% 
of its $4.25 billion worldwide sales, placing it in 
third place in the online jewelry industry.

groups), based on a precise and timely understanding of their needs, targeting specific 
marketing messages to these individuals, and then positioning the product vis-à-vis 
competitors to be truly unique. One-to-one marketing is the ultimate form of market 
segmentation, targeting, and positioning—where the segments are individuals.
The movement toward market segmentation has been ongoing since the develop-
ment of systematic market research and mass media in the 1930s. However, e-com-
merce and the Internet are different in that they enable personalized one-to-one 
marketing to occur on a mass scale. A recent survey found that over 90% of marketers 
either use or intend to use personalization for online customer interactions in 2015. 
Real-time personalization (data-driven personalization that is completed in under one 
second) is becoming an important tool, used by almost 60% of marketers surveyed 
(Evergage, 2015).
The Amazon and Barnes & Noble Web sites are good examples of personalization 
at work. Both sites greet registered visitors (based on cookie files), recommend recent 
books based on user preferences (stored in a user profile in their database) as well as 
what other consumers purchased, and expedite checkout procedures based on prior 
purchases.
Behavioral targeting involves using the online and offline behavior of consumers 
to adjust the advertising messages delivered to them online, often in real time (mil-
liseconds from the consumer’s first URL entry). The intent is to increase the efficiency 
of marketing and advertising, and to increase the revenue streams of firms who are 
in a position to behaviorally target visitors. Because behavioral targeting as a label has 
somewhat unfavorable connotations, the online advertising industry, led by Google, 
has introduced a new name for behavioral targeting. They call it interest-based adver-
tising (IBA).
One of the original promises of the Web has been that it can deliver a marketing 
message tailored to each consumer based on this data, and then measure the results 
in terms of click-throughs and purchases. If you are visiting a jewelry site, you would 
be shown jewelry ads. If you entered a search query like “diamonds,” you would be 
shown text ads for diamonds and other jewelry. This was taken one step further by 
advertising networks composed of several thousand sites. An advertising network could 
follow you across thousands of Web sites and come up with an idea of what you are 
interested in as you browse, and then display ads related to those interests. For instance, 
if you visit a few men’s clothing sites in the course of a few hours, you will be shown 
ads for men’s clothing on most other sites you visit subsequently, regardless of their 
subject content. If you search for a certain pair of shoes at Zappos, and Like them to 
your friends on Facebook, you will be shown ads for the exact same shoes at other sites 
(including Facebook). Behavioral targeting combines nearly all of your online behav-
ioral data into a collection of interest areas, and then shows you ads based on those 
interests, as well as the interests of your friends. What’s new about today’s behavioral 
targeting is the breadth of data collected: your e-mail content, social network page 
content, friends, purchases online, books read or purchased, newspaper sites visited, 
and many other behaviors. And finally, ad exchanges take the marketing of all this 
information one step further. Most popular Web sites have more than 100 tracking 
programs on their home pages that are owned by third-party data collector firms who

then sell this information in real time to the highest bidding advertiser in real-time 
online auctions. Ad exchanges make it possible for advertisers to retarget ads at indi-
viduals as they roam across the Internet. Retargeting involves showing the same or 
similar ads to individuals across multiple Web sites. Retargeting has become a popular 
tactic, used by 88% of marketers surveyed in a recent poll, in large part due to its 
perceived effectiveness. Another recent survey found that over 90% of marketers 
believe retargeting ads performs equal or better than search advertising or e-mail. 
However, as more and more consumers use multiple devices, including mobile devices, 
for online access, the ability to retarget ads across devices is becoming a topic of great 
interest to marketers (Marin Software, 2014; AdRoll, 2015; eMarketer, Inc., 2015j).
There are four methods that online advertisers use to behaviorally target ads: 
search engine queries, the collection of data on individual browsing history online 
(monitoring the clickstream), the collection of data from social network sites, and 
increasingly, the integration of this online data with offline data like income, educa-
tion, address, purchase patterns, credit records, driving records, and hundreds of other 
personal descriptors tied to specific, identifiable persons. This level of integration 
of both “anonymous” as well as identifiable information is routinely engaged in by 
Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and legions of small and medium-sized marketing 
firms that use their data, or collect data from thousands of Web sites using Web beacons 
and cookies. On average, online information bureaus maintain 2,000 data elements on 
each adult person in their database. The currency and accuracy of this data are never 
examined, and the retention periods are not known. Currently, there are no federal 
laws or regulations governing this data.
Earlier in the chapter we described search engine advertising in some detail. 
Search engine advertising has turned out to be the most effective online advertising 
format by several orders of magnitude, and provides more than 95% of the revenue of 
Google, the world’s largest online advertising agency. Why is search engine advertising 
so effective? Most agree that when users enter a query into a search engine, it reveals a 
very specific intention to shop, compare, and possibly purchase. When ads are shown 
at these very moments of customer behavior, they are 4 to 10 times as effective as 
other formats. The author John Battelle coined the phrase and the notion that the 
Web is a database of intentions composed of the results from every search ever made 
and every path that searchers have followed, since the beginning of the Web. In total, 
this database contains the intentions of all mankind. This treasure trove of intentions, 
desires, likes, wants, and needs is owned by Google, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, 
Yahoo (Battelle, 2003). Battelle later extended the concept of a database of intentions 
beyond search to include the social graph (Facebook), status updates (Twitter and 
Facebook), and the “check-in” (Foursquare and Yelp) (Battelle, 2010). The database of 
intentions can be exploited to track and target individuals and groups. Not only is this 
capability unprecedented, but it’s growing exponentially into the foreseeable future. 
The potential for abuse is also growing exponentially. 
The decline in the growth rate of search engine advertising caused the major 
search engine firms to seek out alternative forms of future growth, which include 
display, rich media, and video advertising on millions of Web publisher sites. Web pub-
lishers have responded by producing billions of pages of content. In this environment, 
retargeting
showing the same ad to 
individuals across
multiple Web sites

the effectiveness of display ads has been falling in terms of response rates and prices 
for ads. Behavioral targeting is an effective way to solve this problem and increase 
response rates. Behavioral targeting of both search and display advertising is currently 
driving the expansion in online advertising. 
Behavioral targeting seeks to optimize consumer response by using information 
that Web visitors reveal about themselves online, and if possible, to combine this with 
offline identity and consumption information gathered by companies such as Acxiom. 
Behavioral targeting is based on real-time information about visitors’ use of Web sites, 
including pages visited, content viewed, search queries, ads clicked, videos watched, 
content shared, and products they purchased. Once this information is collected and 
analyzed on the fly, behavioral targeting programs attempt to develop profiles of 
individual users, and then show advertisements most likely to be of interest to the 
user. More than 80% of North American advertisers use some form of targeting in their 
online display ads (Forrester Research, 2014b).
For a variety of technical and other reasons, this vision has, thus far, not been 
widely achieved. The percentage of ads that are actually targeted is unknown. Many 
advertisers use less expensive context ads displayed to a general audience without 
any targeting, or very minimal demographic targeting. The quality of the data, largely 
owned by the online advertising networks, is quite good but hardly perfect. The 
ability to understand and respond—the business intelligence and real-time analyt-
ics—is still weak, preventing companies from being able to respond quickly in mean-
ingful ways when the consumer is online. The firms who sell targeted ads to their 
clients claim the targeted ads are two or three times more effective than general 
ads. There is not very good data to support these claims from independent sources. 
Generally these claims confound the impact of brands on targeted audiences, and 
the impact of the ads placed to this targeted audience. Advertisers target groups that 
are most likely to buy their product even in the absence of targeting ads at them. 
The additional impact of a targeted ad is much smaller than ad platforms claim. A 
research report based on real data from 18 ad campaigns on Yahoo, involving 18.4 
million users, found that brand interest is the largest single factor in determining 
targeted ad effectiveness, and not the targeted ad itself (Farahat and Bailey, 2012). 
And marketing companies are not yet prepared to accept the idea that there needs 
to be several hundred or a thousand variations on the same display ad depending on 
the customer’s profile. Such a move would raise costs. Last, consumer resistance to 
targeting continues. A recent survey found that nearly 70% of Americans are opposed 
to having companies track their online behavior even if they receive a free service 
or product. Over 60% of consumers do not believe that viewing more relevant ads 
is a fair trade-off for being tracked. Almost 90% say people should have the right to 
control what information is collected online and a significant majority would like 
to turn tracking off (Consumer-action.org, 2013). Some consumers find marketing 
messages that are too personalized to be “creepy.” For example, suppose you visited 
the Hanes Web site to look at underclothing. How would you feel about receiving an 
unsolicited e-mail from Hanes thanking you for your visit and asking you to come 
back? How would you feel about getting a similar text message or telephone call, or 
being served a constant array of underclothing ads as you traverse the Web? What if a

company mined your Pinterest pins, Facebook posts, or Twitter feed? Although some 
consumers might not be disturbed by this, many others find it to be “off-putting” at the 
very least. The public and congressional reaction to behavioral targeting is described 
more fully in Chapter 8.
Customization and Customer Co-Production  Customization is an extension of person-
alization. Customization means changing the product—not just the marketing 
message—according to user preferences. Customer co-production means the users 
actually think up the innovation and help create the new product.
Many leading companies now offer “build-to-order” customized products on the 
Internet on a large scale, creating product differentiation and, hopefully, customer 
loyalty. Customers appear to be willing to pay a little more for a unique product. The 
key to making the process affordable is to build a standardized architecture that lets 
consumers combine a variety of options. For example, Nike offers customized sneakers 
through its Nike iD program on its Web site. Consumers can choose the type of shoe, 
colors, material, and even a logo of up to eight characters. Nike transmits the orders 
via computers to specially equipped plants in China and Korea. At the My M&M’s Web 
site, customers can get their own message printed on custom-made M&Ms.
Information goods—goods whose value is based on information content—are also 
ideal for this level of differentiation. For instance, the New York Times—and many 
other content distributors—allows customers to select the news they want to see on 
a daily basis. Many Web sites, particularly portal sites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL, 
allow customers to create their own customized version of the Web site. Such pages 
frequently require security measures such as usernames and passwords to ensure 
privacy and confidentiality.
Customer Service  A Web site’s approach to customer service can significantly help 
or hurt its marketing efforts. Online customer service is more than simply following 
through on order fulfillment; it has to do with users’ ability to communicate with a 
company and obtain desired information in a timely manner. Customer service can 
help reduce consumer frustration, cut the number of abandoned shopping carts, and 
increase sales.
Most consumers want to, and will, serve themselves as long as the information 
they need to do so is relatively easy to find. Online buyers largely do not expect or 
desire “high-touch” service unless they have questions or problems, in which case 
they want relatively speedy answers that are responsive to their individual issue. 
Researchers have found that online consumers strongly attach to brands when they 
have a problem with an order. Customer loyalty increases substantially when online 
buyers learn that customer service representatives are available online or at an 800-
number and were willing and able to resolve the situation quickly. Conversely, online 
buyers who do not receive satisfaction at these critical moments often terminate 
their relationship with the business and switch to merchants that may charge more 
but deliver superior customer service (Ba et al., 2010; Wolfinbarger and Gilly, 2001).

chat systems, intelligent agents, and automated response systems—in addition to the 
customer relationship management systems described in the preceding section.
Frequently asked questions (FAQs), a text-based listing of common questions 
and answers, provide an inexpensive way to anticipate and address customer concerns. 
Adding an FAQ page on a Web site linked to a search engine helps users track down 
needed information more quickly, enabling them to help themselves resolve questions 
and concerns. By directing customers to the FAQs page first, Web sites can give custom-
ers answers to common questions. If a question and answer do not appear, it is impor-
tant for sites to make contact with a live person simple and easy. Offering an e-mail 
link to customer service at the bottom of the FAQs page is one solution.
Real-time customer service chat systems (in which a company’s customer 
service representatives interactively exchange text-based messages with one or more 
customers on a real-time basis) are an increasingly popular way for companies to 
assist online shoppers during a purchase. Chats with online customer service rep-
resentatives can provide direction, answer questions, and troubleshoot technical 
glitches that can kill a sale. Leading vendors of customer service chat systems 
include LivePerson and ClickDesk. Vendors claim that chat is significantly less 
expensive than telephone-based customer service. However, critics point out this 
conclusion may be based on optimistic assumptions that chat representatives can 
assist three or four customers at once, and that chat sessions are shorter than phone 
sessions. Also, chat sessions are text sessions, and not as rich as talking with a human 
being over the phone. On the plus side, chat has been reported to raise per-order 
sales figures, providing sales assistance by allowing companies to “touch” customers 
during the decision-making process. Evidence suggests that chat can lower shopping 
cart abandonment rates, increase the number of items purchased per transaction, 
and increase the dollar value of transactions. “Click to call” or “live call” is another 
version of a real-time online customer service system, in which the customer clicks 
a link or accepts an invitation to have a customer service representative call them 
on the telephone.
Intelligent agent technology is another way customers are providing assistance 
to online shoppers. Intelligent agents are part of an effort to reduce costly contact 
with customer service representatives. Automated response systems send e-mail 
order confirmations and acknowledgments of e-mailed inquiries, in some cases 
letting the customer know that it may take a day or two to actually research an 
answer to their question. Automated shipping confirmations and order status reports 
are also common.
Pricing Strategies
As we noted in Chapter 1, during the early years of e-commerce, many academics 
and business consultants predicted that the Web would lead to a new world of infor-
mation symmetry and “frictionless” commerce. In this world, newly empowered 
customers, using intelligent shopping agents and the nearly infinite product and 
price information available on the Internet, would shop around the world (and 
around the clock) with minimal effort, driving prices down to their marginal cost

and driving intermediaries out of the market as customers began to deal directly 
with producers (Wigand and Benjamin, 1995; Rayport and Sviokla, 1995; Evans and 
Wurster, 1999; Sinha, 2000). The result was supposed to be an instance of the Law of 
One Price: with complete price transparency in a perfect information marketplace, 
one world price for every product would emerge. Frictionless commerce would, of 
course, mean the end of marketing based on brands. 
But it didn’t work out this way. Firms still compete for customers through price 
as well as product features, scope of operations, and focus. Pricing (putting a value 
on goods and services) is an integral part of marketing strategy. Together, price and 
quality determine customer value. Pricing of e-commerce goods has proved very dif-
ficult for both entrepreneurs and investors to understand.
In traditional firms, the prices of traditional goods—such as books, drugs, and 
automobiles—are usually based on their fixed and variable costs as well as the market’s 
demand curve (the quantity of goods that can be sold at various prices). Fixed costs 
are the costs of building the production facility. Variable costs are costs involved in 
running the production facility—mostly labor. In a competitive market, with undif-
ferentiated goods, prices tend toward their marginal costs (the incremental cost of 
producing the next unit) once manufacturers have paid the fixed costs to enter the 
business.
Firms usually “discover” their demand curves by testing various price and volume 
bundles, while closely watching their cost structure. Normally, prices are set to maxi-
mize profits. A profit-maximizing company sets its prices so that the marginal revenue 
(the revenue a company receives from the next unit sold) from a product just equals 
its marginal costs. If a firm’s marginal revenue is higher than its marginal costs, it 
would want to lower prices a bit and sell more product (why leave money on the table 
when you can sell a few more units?). If its marginal revenue for selling a product is 
lower than its marginal costs, then the company would want to reduce volume a bit 
and charge a higher price (why lose money on each additional sale?).
In the early years of e-commerce, something unusual happened. Sellers were 
pricing their products far below their marginal costs. Some sites were losing money 
on every sale. How could this be? New economics? New technology? The Internet 
age? No. Internet merchants could sell below their marginal costs (even giving away 
products for free) simply because a large number of entrepreneurs and their venture 
capitalist backers thought this was a worthwhile activity, at least in the short term. 
The idea was to attract eyeballs with free goods and services, and then later, once the 
consumer was part of a large, committed audience, charge advertisers enough money 
to make a profit, and (maybe) charge customers subscription fees for value-added 
services (the so-called “piggyback” strategy in which a small number of users can be 
convinced to pay for premium services that are piggybacked upon a larger audience 
that receives standard or reduced value services). To a large extent, social network 
sites and user-generated content sites have resurrected this revenue model with a 
focus on the growth in audience size and not short-term profits. To understand the 
behavior of entrepreneurial firms, it is helpful to examine a traditional demand curve 
(see Figure 6.9).

A small number of customers are willing to pay a great deal for the product—far 
above P1. A larger number of customers would happily pay P1, and an even larger number 
of customers would pay less than P1. If the price were zero, the demand might approach 
infinity! Ideally, in order to maximize sales and profits, a firm would like to pick up all 
the money in the market by selling the product at the price each customer is willing to 
pay. This is called price discrimination—selling products to different people and groups 
based on their willingness to pay. If some people really want the product, sell it to them 
at a high price. But sell it to indifferent people at a much lower price; otherwise, they 
will not buy. This only works if the firm can (a) identify the price each individual would 
be willing to pay, and (b) segregate the customers from one another so they cannot find 
out what the others are paying. Therefore, most firms adopt a fixed price for their goods 
(P1), or a small number of prices for different versions of their products.
What if the marginal cost of producing a good is zero? What should the price be for 
these goods? It would be impossible then to set prices based on equalizing marginal 
revenue and marginal cost—because marginal cost is zero. The Internet is primarily 
filled with information goods—from music to research reports, to stock quotes, stories, 
weather reports, articles, pictures, and opinions—whose marginal cost of production is 
zero when distributed over the Internet. Thus, another reason certain goods, such as 
some information goods, may be free on the Internet is that they are “selling” for what 
it costs to produce them—next to nothing. Content that is stolen has zero production 
costs. Content that is contributed by users also has zero production costs for the Web 
sites themselves.

Free and Freemium  Everyone likes a bargain, and the best bargain is something for 
free. Businesses give away free PCs, free data storage, free music, free Web sites, free 
photo storage, and free Internet connections. Free is not new: banks used to give away 
“free” toasters to depositors in the 1950s. Google offers free office apps, free e-mail, 
and free collaboration sites. There can be a sensible economic logic to giving things 
away. Free content can help build market awareness and can lead to sales of other 
follow-on products. Finally, free products and services knock out potential and actual 
competitors (the free browser Internet Explorer from Microsoft spoiled the market for 
Netscape’s browser) (Shapiro and Varian, 1999).
Today, “free” is increasingly being implemented online as “freemium” to borrow a 
phrase from Chris Anderson’s book Free: The Future of a Radical Price. The freemium 
pricing model is a cross-subsidy online marketing strategy where users are offered 
a basic service for free, but must pay for premium or add-on services. The people 
who pay for the premium services hopefully will pay for all the free riders on the 
service. Skype uses a freemium model: millions of users can call other Skype users 
on the Internet for free, but there’s a charge for calling a land line or cell phone. 
Flickr, Google Sites, Yahoo, and a host of others offer premium services at a price 
in order to support free services. Pandora offers free Internet radio, but it includes 
advertisements. Premium service without ads costs about $55 a year. (See the Chapter 
5 case study, Freemium Takes Pandora Public, for more information on Pandora and the 
freemium pricing strategy.)
“Free” and “freemium” as pricing strategies do have limits. In the past, many 
e-commerce businesses found it difficult to convert the eyeballs into paying customers. 
Free sites attract hundreds of millions of price-sensitive “free loaders” who have no 
intention of ever paying for anything, and who switch from one free service to another 
at the very mention of charges. The piggyback strategy has not been a universal 
success. “Free” eliminates a rich price discrimination strategy. Clearly some of the free 
loaders would indeed pay a small amount each month, and this revenue is lost to the 
firms who offer significant services for free. Some argue that everything digital will one 
day be free in part because Internet users expect it to be so. But the history of “free” 
includes broadcast television, which used to be “free” (it was advertising-supported), 
but the public eventually had no problem moving to cable television and DVDs as paid 
services. The exceptions to “free” are really valuable streams of information that are 
exclusive, expensive to produce, not widely distributed, unique, and have immediate 
consumption or investment value. Even in the age of the Internet, these digital streams 
will sell for a price greater than zero. There probably is no free lunch after all, at least 
not one that’s worth eating. 
Versioning  One solution to the problem of free information goods is versioning—cre-
ating multiple versions of the goods and selling essentially the same product to differ-
ent market segments at different prices. In this situation, the price depends on the 
value to the consumer. Consumers will segment themselves into groups that are 
willing to pay different amounts for various versions (Shapiro and Varian, 1998).

Versioning fits well with a modified “free” strategy. A reduced-value version can be 
offered for free, while premium versions can be offered at higher prices. What are 
characteristics of a “reduced-value version?” Low-priced—or in the case of informa-
tion goods, even “free”—versions might be less convenient to use, less comprehen-
sive, slower, less powerful, and offer less support than the high-priced versions. Just 
as there are different General Motors car brands appealing to different market seg-
ments (Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, and GMC), and within these divisions, hundreds 
of models from the most basic to the more powerful and functional, so can informa-
tion goods be “versioned” in order to segment and target the market and position the 
products. In the realm of information goods, online magazines, music companies, 
and book publishers offer sample content for free, but charge for more powerful 
content. The New York Times, for instance, allows you to read 10 articles a month 
online for free, but if you want to read more, you must have a digital subscription. 
Some Web sites offer “free services” with annoying advertising, but turn off the ads 
for a monthly fee.
Bundling  “Ziggy” Ziegfeld, a vaudeville entrepreneur at the turn of the twentieth 
century in New York, noticed that nearly one-third of his theater seats were empty on 
some Friday nights, and during the week, matinee shows were often half empty. He 
came up with an idea for bundling tickets into “twofers”: pay for one full-price ticket 
and get the next ticket free. Twofers are still a Broadway theater tradition in New York. 
They are based on the idea that (a) the marginal cost of seating another patron is zero, 
and (b) a great many people who would not otherwise buy a single ticket would buy 
a “bundle” of tickets for the same or even a slightly higher price.
Bundling of information goods online extends the concept of a twofer. Bundling 
offers consumers two or more goods for a price that is less than the goods would cost 
when purchased individually. The key idea behind the concept of bundling is that 
although consumers typically have very diverse ideas about the value of a single 
product, they tend to agree much more on the value of a bundle of products offered 
at a fixed price. In fact, the per-product price people are willing to pay for the bundle 
is often higher than when the products are sold separately. Bundling reduces the 
variance (dispersion) in market demand for goods. 
Dynamic Pricing and Flash Marketing  The pricing strategies we have discussed so far 
are all fixed-price strategies. Versions and bundles are sold for fixed prices based on 
the firm’s best effort at maximizing its profits. But what if there is product still left on 
the shelf along with the knowledge that someone, somewhere, would be willing to pay 
something for it? It might be better to obtain at least some revenue from the product, 
rather than let it sit on the shelf, or even perish. Imagine also that there are some 
people in every market who would pay a hefty premium for a product if they could 
have it right away. In other situations, such as for an antique, the value of the product 
has to be discovered in the marketplace (usually because there is a belief that the 
marketplace would value the product at a much higher price than its owner paid as a 
cost). In other cases, the value of a good is equal to what the market is willing to pay 
(and has nothing to do with its cost). Or let’s say you want to build frequent visits to 
your site and offer some really great bargains for a few minutes each day, or the whole 
bundling
offers consumers two or 
more goods for a reduced 
price

day with a set time limit. Here is where dynamic pricing mechanisms come to the 
fore, and where the strengths of the Internet can be seen. With dynamic pricing, the 
price of the product varies, depending on the demand characteristics of the customer 
and the supply situation of the seller.
There are a number of different kinds of dynamic pricing mechanisms. For 
instance, auctions have been used for centuries to establish the instant market price 
for goods. Auctions are flexible and efficient market mechanisms for pricing unique 
or unusual goods, as well as commonplace goods such as computers, flower bundles, 
and cameras.
Yield management is quite different from auctions. In auctions, thousands of 
consumers establish a price by bidding against one another. In yield management, man-
agers set prices in different markets, appealing to different segments, in order to sell 
excess capacity. Airlines exemplify yield management techniques. Every few minutes 
during the day, they adjust prices of empty airline seats to ensure at least some of the 
50,000 empty airline seats are sold at some reasonable price—even below marginal 
cost of production. Amazon and other large online retailers frequently use yield man-
agement techniques that involve changing prices hourly to stimulate demand and 
maximize revenues. Amazon can also track shopping behavior of individuals seeking 
a specific product, such as a laser printer. As the consumer searches for the best price, 
Amazon can observe the offering prices on other Web sites, and then adjust its prices 
dynamically so that when the user visits Amazon again, a lower price will be displayed 
than all other sites visited. 
Yield management works under a limited set of conditions. Generally, the product 
is perishable (an empty airline seat perishes when the plane takes off without a full 
load); there are seasonal variations in demand; market segments are clearly defined; 
markets are competitive; and market conditions change rapidly (Cross, 1997). In 
general, only very large firms with extensive monitoring and database systems in 
place have been able to afford yield management techniques.
Surge pricing is a kind of dynamic pricing used by companies such as Uber. Uber 
uses a dynamic pricing algorithm to optimize its revenue, or as the company claims, to 
balance supply and demand. Prices have surged from two to ten times or higher during 
storms and popular holiday periods. Uber was sharply criticized for using this scheme 
in New York City during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Critics claim the practice amounts 
to price gouging, which during an emergency is illegal in some states like New York. 
Uber counters that the higher prices bring more livery cars onto the streets, increasing 
supply just when needed. But surge pricing, like most dynamic pricing schemes, is 
not the same as an open auction, where price movements are transparent to all. Uber 
does not make its data on supply and demand available to the public. Therefore it is 
impossible to know if Uber prices go up during holidays and storms because demand 
exceeds supply or because Uber wants to increase profits. In July 2014, Uber reached 
an agreement with the New York State Attorney General to limit pricing surges during 
emergencies (Isaac, 2014). 
A third dynamic pricing technique is flash marketing, which has proved extraordi-
narily effective for travel services, luxury clothing goods, and other goods. Using e-mail 
or dedicated Web site features to notify loyal customers (repeat purchasers), merchants

the price of the product

demand characteristics of 
the customer and the 
supply situation of the 
seller

offer goods and services for a limited time (usually hours) at very low prices. JetBlue 
has offered $14 flights between New York and Los Angeles. Deluxe hotel rooms are 
flash marketed at $1 a night. Companies like Rue La La, HauteLook, and Gilt Groupe 
are based on flash marketing techniques. Blink and you can easily miss these great 
prices. Gilt purchases overstocked items from major fashion brands and then offers 
them to their subscribers at discounted prices via daily e-mail and SMS flash messages. 
Typically, the sale of an item lasts for two hours or until the inventory is depleted. 
On many occasions, Gilt rises to the top of most frequently visited Web sites when it 
conducts a sale. Critics point out that these sites take advantage of compulsive shop-
pers and lead to overshopping for unneeded goods. In another example of mass retail 
dynamic pricing, in 2011, Amazon used its new cloud music service to offer a flash 
one-day sale of Lady Gaga’s latest album for 99 cents. Response was so great that Ama-
zon’s cloud servers could not meet the demand, and the offer has not been repeated.
The Internet has truly revolutionized the possibilities to engage in dynamic, and 
even misleading, pricing strategies. With millions of consumers using a site every hour, 
and access to powerful databases, merchants can raise prices one minute and drop 
them another minute when a competitor threatens. Bait-and-switch tactics become 
more common: a really low price on one product is used to attract people to a site 
when in fact the product is not available.
Long Tail Marketing
Consider that Amazon sells a larger number of obscure books than it does of “hit” books 
(defined as the top 20% of books sold). Nevertheless, the hit books generate 80% of 
Amazon’s revenues. Consumers distribute themselves in many markets according to 
a power curve where 80% of the demand is for the hit products, and demand for 
nonhits quickly recedes to a small number of units sold. In a traditional market, niche 
products are so obscure no one ever hears about them. One impact of the Internet and 
e-commerce on sales of obscure products with little demand is that obscure products 
become more visible to consumers through search engines, recommendation engines, 
and social networks. Hence, online retailers can earn substantial revenue selling 
products for which demand and price are low. In fact, with near zero inventory costs, 
and a good search engine, the sales of obscure products can become a much larger 
percentage of total revenue. Amazon, for instance, has millions of book titles for sale 
at $2.99 or less, many written by obscure authors. Because of its search and recom-
mendation engines, Amazon is able to generate profits from the sale of this large 
number of obscure titles. This is called the long tail effect. See Insight on Technology: 
The Long Tail: Big Hits and Big Misses.

Internet marketing has many similarities to and differences from ordinary market­

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THE LONG TAIL: BIG HITS AND BIG MISSES
The Long Tail is a name given to 
various statistical distributions char-
acterized by a small group of events 
of high amplitude and a large group 
of events with low amplitude. Coined 
by Wired Magazine writer Chris Anderson 
in 2004, the Web’s Long Tail has since gone on 
to fascinate academics and challenge online mar-
keters. The concept is straightforward. Think Hol-
lywood movies: there are a few big hits and also 
thousands of films that no one ever hears about. 
It’s the legion of misses that make up the Long 
Tail. Anderson claimed to have discovered a new 
rule: no matter how much content you put online, 
someone, somewhere will show up to buy it. Rather 
than 20:80, Anderson suggested that Internet 
search, recommendation engines, and online social 
networks all enable niche products to be discovered 
and purchased. For example, eBay contains millions 
of items drawn from every Aunt Tilly’s closet in the 
world and still seems to find a buyer somewhere for 
just about anything, generating revenue that would 
not be realized without an online marketplace.
On the Internet, where search costs are tiny, 
and storage and distribution costs are near zero, 
online retailers like Amazon and Alibaba are able 
to offer millions of products for sale compared to a 
typical bricks-and-mortar retailer like Walmart or 
Sears. Without physical stores to maintain, online 
merchants can save on overhead and labor costs 
and load up on inventory. Wherever you look on the 
Web, you can find a great many items that only a 
few people are interested in buying. But with over 3 
billion people online, even a one-in-a-million product 
could find over 3,000 buyers. Researchers note that 
most shoppers have a taste for both popular as well 
as niche products. 
One problem with the Long Tail is that people 
sometimes have difficulty finding niche products 
because they are—by definition—largely unknown. 
The revenue value of low-demand products is 
locked up in collective ignorance. Here’s where 
recommender systems come into play: although 
these systems can skew toward the most popular 
selections, they can sometimes guide consumers to 
obscure but wonderful works based on the recom-
mendations of others. Netflix has spent millions in 
recent years on improving its recommender system, 
and Pandora’s recommender system focuses on gen-
erating quality music without regard to popularity. 
Search engine optimization is another area 
where marketers are trying to unlock the power of 
the Long Tail. Long-Tail keywords are phrases that 
a small but significant number of people might use 
to find products. For instance, instead of investing 
in keywords such as “shoes” or “men’s shoes,” a 
marketer focused on the Long Tail might choose a 
keyword like “purple all-weather running shoes.” 
Google has rolled out various updates to its search 
algorithm that improve Long Tail searches. Accord-
ing to Google, Long Tail searches comprise as much 
as 50% of all Web queries, with approximately 20% 
of searches being extremely unique or never seen 
before. Google uses textual analysis to deliver better, 
more focused results for these searches. An increas-
ing number of Internet users are using natural lan-
guage searches (searches that are phrased in the way 
we would speak naturally, like “where is the nearest 
pizza place?”) to find products and services. These 
searches are also a part of the Long Tail, and while 
big businesses tend to control the more frequently 
searched keywords, smaller businesses can focus on 
natural language and other Long Tail searches to 
dramatically improve their conversion rates.
Social networks also make the Long Tail phe-
nomenon even stronger. A recent study found that 
popularity information of the sort produced in a 
social network spurs sales of niche products more 
than mainstream products because of the higher 
perceived quality of the niche product.

Long Tail search is also pivotal for online 
sales of rare books. A 2014 study showed that 
used books sell for higher prices online than in 
physical stores. The study’s authors surmised 
that book buyers are willing to pay a higher price 
because without the Web, they wouldn’t have found 
the book they sought. 
Anderson claimed that the Internet would 
revolutionize digital content by making even niche 
products highly profitable, and that the revenues 
produced by small niche products would ultimately 
outweigh the revenues of hit movies, songs, and 
books. But some newer research casts some doubt 
on the revenue potential in the Long Tail. Solid best 
sellers have expanded and produce the vast part of 
online media revenues. Netflix’s most recent earn-
ings report boasted record highs, which it credited 
to its growing group of original series and recently 
added blockbuster hits like the television series 
Friends, not the thousands of titles in its Long Tail. 
In fact, its DVD business, where most of its Long 
Tail titles are available, has only 5.5 million sub-
scribers, compared to 62 million subscribers of its 
streaming service, which consists primarily of more 
popular movies and shows. Similarly, another study 
found that while the number of ISBNs of e-books 
in the Canadian market expanded rapidly in 2014, 
the number of ISBNs selling at least one copy 
remained unchanged. The situation is similar in the 
music industry. As music services compete to offer 
increasingly large catalogs of songs, the well-known 
artists do better, while each individual member of the 
growing Long Tail finds it harder to stand out amidst 
lesser-known peers. On mobile devices especially, 
“front end display” for music services and e-books 
is smaller than on desktop screens, and only the 
superstars get this valuable marketing real estate. 
On the other hand, up-and-coming artists have 
fewer barriers to entry and more avenues than ever 
to promote themselves without the aid of major 
labels. Artists like violinist Lindsey Stirling started 
out in the Long Tail; she has put up her own videos 
on YouTube, and has since become a major com-
mercial success. Indie music labels’ percentage of 
the top 200 albums by sales grew from just 13% 
in 2001 to 35% in 2010. And would-be authors 
have more options to publish their works and market 
themselves, despite the low odds of penning a smash 
hit.
Both the Long Tail and the winner-take-all 
approaches have implications for marketers and 
product designers. In the Long Tail approach, online 
merchants, especially those selling digital goods 
such as content, should build up huge libraries of 
content because they can make significant revenues 
from niche products that have small audiences. In 
the winner-take-all approach, the niche products 
produce little revenue, and firms should concentrate 
on hugely popular titles and services. Surprisingly, 
contrary to what Anderson originally theorized, the 
evidence for online digital content increasingly sup-
ports a winner-take-all perspective.

consumer). But Internet marketing is also very different from ordinary marketing 
because the nature of the medium and its capabilities are so different from anything 
that has come before. In order to understand just how different Internet marketing 
can be and in what ways, you first need to become familiar with some basic Internet 
marketing technologies.
THE REVOLUTION IN INTERNET MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES
In Chapter 1, we listed eight unique features of e-commerce technology. Table 6.6 
describes how marketing has changed as a result of these new technical capabilities.

TECHNOLOGY ON MARKETING

Ubiquity 
Marketing communications have been extended to the home, work, and 
mobile platforms; geographic limits on marketing have been reduced. The 
marketplace has been replaced by “marketspace” and is removed from a 
temporal and geographic location. Customer convenience has been enhanced, 
and shopping costs have been reduced.
Global reach 
Worldwide customer service and marketing communications have been 
enabled. Potentially hundreds of millions of consumers can be reached with 
marketing messages.
Universal standards 
The cost of delivering marketing messages and receiving feedback from users 
is reduced because of shared, global standards of the Internet.
Richness 
Video, audio, and text marketing messages can be integrated into a single 
marketing message and consuming experience.
Interactivity
Consumers can be engaged in a dialog, dynamically adjusting the experience 
to the consumer, and making the consumer a co-producer of the goods and 
services being sold.
Information density 
Fine-grained, highly detailed information on consumers’ real-time behavior can be 
gathered and analyzed for the first time. “Data mining” Internet technology 
permits the analysis of terabytes of consumer data every day for marketing 
purposes.
Personalization/
Customization
This feature potentially enables product and service differentiation down to the 
level of the individual, thus strengthening the ability of marketers to create 
brands.
Social technology
User-generated content and social network sites, along with blogs, have created 
new, large, online audiences where the content is provided by users. These 
audiences have greatly expanded the opportunity for marketers to reach new 
potential customers in a nontraditional media format. Entirely new kinds of 
marketing techniques are evolving. These same technologies expose marketers 
to the risk of falling afoul of popular opinion by providing more market power to 
users who now can “talk back.”

On balance, the Internet has had four very powerful impacts on marketing. First, 
the Internet, as a communications medium, has broadened the scope of marketing 
communications—in the sense of the number of people who can be easily reached as 
well as the locations where they can be reached, from desktops to mobile smartphones 
(in short, everywhere). Second, the Internet has increased the richness of marketing 
communications by combining text, video, and audio content into rich messages. 
Arguably, the Web is richer as a medium than even television or video because of the 
complexity of messages available, the enormous content accessible on a wide range 
of subjects, and the ability of users to interactively control the experience. Third, the 
Internet has greatly expanded the information intensity of the marketplace by provid-
ing marketers (and customers) with unparalleled fine-grained, detailed, real-time infor-
mation about consumers as they transact in the marketplace. Fourth, the always-on, 
always-attached, environment created by mobile devices results in consumers being 
much more available to receive marketing messages. One result is an extraordinary 
expansion in marketing opportunities for firms.
WEB TRANSACTION LOGS
How can e-commerce sites know more than a department store or the local grocery 
store does about consumer behavior? A primary source of consumer information on 
the Web is the transaction log maintained by all Web servers. A transaction log 
records user activity at a Web site. The transaction log is built into Web server software. 
Transaction log data becomes even more useful when combined with two other visitor-
generated data trails: registration forms and the shopping cart database. Users are 
enticed through various means (such as free gifts or special services) to fill out registra-
tion forms. Registration forms gather personal data on name, address, phone, zip 
code, e-mail address (usually required), and other optional self-confessed information 
on interests and tastes. When users make a purchase, they also enter additional infor-
mation into the shopping cart database. The shopping cart database captures all the 
item selection, purchase, and payment data. Other potential additional sources of data 
are information users submit on product forms, contribute to chat groups, or send via 
e-mail messages using the “Contact Us” option on most sites.
For a Web site that has a million visitors per month, and where, on average, a 
visitor makes 15 page requests per visit, there will be 15 million entries in the log 
each month. These transaction logs, coupled with data from the registration forms 
and shopping cart database, represent a treasure trove of marketing information for 
both individual sites and the online industry as a whole. Nearly all Internet marketing 
capabilities are based on these data-gathering tools. For instance, here are just a few of 
the interesting marketing questions that can be answered by examining a site’s Web 
transaction logs, registration forms, and shopping cart database:
•	 What are the major patterns of interest and purchase for groups and individuals?
•	 After the home page, where do most users go first, and then second and third?
•	 What are the interests of specific individuals (those we can identify)?
•	 How can we make it easier for people to use our site so they can find what they 
want?

•	 How can we change the design of the site to encourage visitors to purchase our 
high-margin products?
•	 Where are visitors coming from (and how can we optimize our presence on these 
referral sites)?
•	 How can we personalize our messages, offerings, and products to individual users?
Businesses can choke on the massive quantity of information found in a typical 
site’s log file. We describe some technologies that help firms more effectively utilize 
this information below.
SUPPLEMENTING THE LOGS: COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING FILES
While transaction logs create the foundation of online data collection at a single Web 
site, marketers use tracking files to follow users across the entire Web as they visit 
other sites. There are three primary kinds of tracking files: cookies, Flash cookies, 
and Web beacons. As described in Chapter 2, a cookie is a small text file that Web sites 
place on the hard disk of visitors’ client computers every time they visit, and during 
the visit, as specific pages are visited. Cookies allow a Web site to store data on a user’s 
computer and then later retrieve it. The cookie typically includes a name, a unique 
ID number for each visitor that is stored on the user’s computer, the domain (which 
specifies the Web server/domain that can access the cookie), a path (if a cookie comes 
from a particular part of a Web site instead of the main page, a path will be given), a 
security setting that provides whether the cookie can only be transmitted by a secure 
server, and an expiration date (not required). First-party cookies come from the same 
domain name as the page the user is visiting, while third-party cookies come from 
another domain, such as ad serving or adware companies, affiliate marketers, or 
spyware servers. On some Web sites, there are literally hundreds of tracking files on 
the main pages. 
A cookie provides Web marketers with a very quick means of identifying the 
customer and understanding his or her prior behavior at the site. Web sites use cookies 
to determine how many people are visiting the site, whether they are new or repeat 
visitors, and how often they have visited, although this data may be somewhat inac-
curate because people share computers, they often use more than one computer, and 
cookies may have been inadvertently or intentionally erased. Cookies make shopping 
carts and “quick checkout” options possible by allowing a site to keep track of a user 
as he or she adds to the shopping cart. Each item added to the shopping cart is stored 
in the site’s database along with the visitor’s unique ID value.
Ordinary cookies are easy to spot using your browser, but Flash cookies, beacons, 
and tracking codes are not easily visible. All common browsers allow users to see the 
cookies placed in their cookies file. Users can delete cookies, or adjust their settings 
so that third-party cookies are blocked, while first-party cookies are allowed.
With growing privacy concerns, over time the percentage of people deleting 
cookies has risen. The more cookies are deleted, the less accurate are Web page 
and ad server metrics, and the less likely marketers will be able to understand who 
is visiting their sites or where they came from. As a result, advertisers have sought 
other methods. One way is using Adobe Flash software, which creates its own cookie 

430	
	
C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g 
files, known as Flash cookies. Flash cookies can be set to never expire, and can store 
about 5 MB of information compared to the 1,024 bytes stored by regular cookies. 
Although cookies are site-specific (a Web site can only receive the data it has 
stored on a client computer and cannot look at any other cookie), when combined 
with Web beacons (also called “bugs”), they can be used to create cross-site profiles. 
Web beacons are tiny (1-pixel) graphic files embedded in e-mail messages and on Web 
sites. Web beacons are used to automatically transmit information about the user and 
the page being viewed to a monitoring server in order to collect personal browsing 
behavior and other personal information. For instance, when a recipient opens an 
e-mail in HTML format or opens a Web page, a message is sent to a server calling for 
graphic information. This tells the marketer that the e-mail was opened, indicating 
that the recipient was at least interested in the subject header. Web beacons are not 
visible to users. They are often clear or colored white so they are not visible to the 
recipient. You may be able to determine if a Web page is using Web beacons by using 
the View Source option of your browser and examining the IMG (image) tags on the 
page. As noted above, Web beacons are typically one pixel in size and contain the 
URL of a server that differs from the one that served the page itself. 
Using cookies on mobile devices has been less effective. Regular cookies on the 
mobile Web are reset every time a user closes his or her mobile browser and in-app 
cookies can’t be shared between apps, making both of limited utility. However, 
with the increasing numbers of people using mobile devices to access the Internet, 
it is not surprising that telecommunications companies have begun to use tracking 
files. In late 2014, it was revealed that Verizon Wireless and AT&T were inserting 
a tracking header called a Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) into HTTP requests 
issued to Web sites from mobile devices, enabling them to track the online activi-
ties of their subscribers. Commentators call these tracking headers zombie cookies, 
perma-cookies, or supercookies because they cannot be deleted the way that regular 
browser cookies can. Following an outcry by privacy advocates and an FCC investiga-
tion, AT&T reportedly stopped using supercookies, but Verizon continues, although 
allowing users to opt out of their use. However, a 2015 study found that 15% of 
mobile users around the world (including the United States) continue to be tracked 
by supercookies, and their use appears to be increasing. 
In an effort to more effectively track consumers across devices, other cross-
device tracking methods have begun to be developed. Deterministic cross-device 
tracking relies on personally identifiable information such as e-mail address used 
to log into an app and Web site on different devices. Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter, 
and other companies that have very large user bases and have both desktop and 
mobile properties that require logins are the most likely to be able to effectively 
exploit deterministic matching. Probabilistic cross-device tracking uses algorithms 
developed by vendors such as Drawbridge, BlueCava, and Tapad to analyze thousands 
of anonymous data points, such as device type, operating system, and IP address, to 
create a possible match. This type of matching is, not surprisingly, less accurate than 
deterministic matching (Schiff, 2015; Whitener, 2015). 
In November 2015, the Federal Trade Commission will host a workshop to 
examine the privacy issues involved with cross-device tracking, while the Network 
Advertising Initiative has indicated that it will issue guidance and standards on the 
deterministic cross-
device tracking

able information such as 
e-mail address used to log

use of such technologies. Insight on Society: Every Move You Take, Every Click You 
Make, We’ll Be Tracking You further examines the use of tracking files.
DATABASES, DATA WAREHOUSES, DATA MINING, AND BIG DATA
Databases, data warehouses, data mining, and the variety of marketing decision-making 
techniques loosely called profiling are at the heart of the revolution in Internet market-
ing. Profiling uses a variety of tools to create a digital image for each consumer. This 
image can be quite inexact, even primitive, but it can also be as detailed as a character 
in a novel. The quality of a consumer profile depends on the amount of data used to 
create it, and the analytical power of the firm’s software and hardware. Together, these 
techniques attempt to identify precisely who the online customer is and what they want, 
and then, to fulfill the customer’s criteria exactly. These techniques are more powerful, 
far more precise, and more fine-grained than the gross levels of demographic and market 
segmentation techniques used in mass marketing media or by telemarketing.
In order to understand the data in transaction logs, registration forms, shopping 
carts, cookies, Web bugs, and other unstructured data sources like e-mails, tweets, and 
Facebook Likes, Internet marketers need massively powerful and capacious databases, 
database management systems, and analytic tools. 
Databases
The first step in interpreting huge transaction streams is to store the information 
systematically. A database is a software application that stores records and attributes. 
A telephone book is a physical database that stores records of individuals and their 
attributes such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. A database management 
system (DBMS) is a software application used by organizations to create, maintain, 
and access databases. The most common DBMS are DB2 from IBM and a variety of 
SQL databases from Oracle, Sybase, and other providers. Structured query language 
(SQL) is an industry-standard database query and manipulation language used in 
relational databases. Relational databases such as DB2 and SQL represent data as 
two-dimensional tables with records organized in rows, and attributes in columns, 
much like a spreadsheet. The tables—and all the data in them—can be flexibly related 
to one another as long as the tables share a common data element.
Relational databases are extraordinarily flexible and allow marketers and other 
managers to view and analyze data from different perspectives very quickly. 
Data Warehouses and Data Mining
A data warehouse is a database that collects a firm’s transactional and customer data 
in a single location for offline analysis by marketers and site managers. The data 
originate in many core operational areas of the firm, such as Web site transaction logs, 
shopping carts, point-of-sale terminals (product scanners) in stores, warehouse inven-
tory levels, field sales reports, external scanner data supplied by third parties, and 
financial payment data. The purpose of a data warehouse is to gather all the firm’s 
transaction and customer data into one logical repository where it can be analyzed 
and modeled by managers without disrupting or taxing the firm’s primary transactional 
systems and databases. Data warehouses grow quickly into storage repositories

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
EVERY MOVE YOU TAKE, EVERY CLICK YOU 
MAKE, WE’LL BE TRACKING YOU 
Advertising-supported Web sites 
depend on knowing as much personal 
information as possible about you. One 
of the main ways ad firms discover your 
personal information is by placing so-called 
“tracking files” on your computer’s browser. There 
are several kinds of third-party tracking files on 
Web pages. Cookies are the best known. These 
simple text files are placed in your browser and 
assign a unique number to your computer, which 
is then used by advertisers to track you across 
the Web as you move from one site to another 
(without telling you). Web beacons (sometimes 
also referred to as Web bugs) are a little more 
pernicious. Beacons are small software files that 
track your clicks, choices, and purchases, and even 
location data from mobile devices, and then send 
that information, often in real time, to advertisers 
tracking you. Beacons can also assign your com-
puter a unique number and track you across the 
Web. Tracking may also occur as you watch Adobe 
Flash-enabled videos, visit Web sites equipped with 
HTML5 local storage, and use apps on smart-
phones. Most Facebook apps, for instance, send 
personal information, including names, to dozens 
of advertising and Internet tracking companies.
So how common is Web tracking? In a recent 
study, researchers found a very widespread sur-
veillance system. Only one site, Wikipedia, had 
no tracking files. Two-thirds of the tracking files 
came from companies whose primary business is 
identifying and tracking Internet users to create 
consumer profiles that can be sold to advertis-
ing firms looking for specific types of customers. 
The other third came from database firms that 
gather and bundle the information and then sell 
it to marketers. Many of the tracking tools gather 
personal information such as age, gender, race, 
income, marital status, health concerns, TV shows 
and movies viewed, magazines and newspapers 
read, and books purchased. While tracking firms 
claim the information they gather is anonymous, 
this is true in name only. Scholars have shown 
that with just a few pieces of information, such as 
age, gender, zip code, and marital status, specific 
individuals can be easily identified. In 2012, a 
Web Privacy Census conducted by the University 
of California Berkeley Center for Law and Technol-
ogy found that the total number of cookies on the 
top 100 Web sites had increased by 80%, from 
3,600 when first measured in 2009 to over 6,400. 
The vast majority of these cookies (about 85%) 
were third-party tracking cookies, from over 450 
different third-party hosts. Google’s DoubleClick 
was the top tracker, and the most frequently 
appearing cookie keys were those associated with 
Google Analytics. Similar results were observed 
when looking at the top 1,000 and top 25,000 
Web sites. One cause: growth of online ad auc-
tions where advertisers buy data about users’ Web 
browsing behavior. When you visit a site, your visit 
is auctioned and the winner gets to show you some 
ads. All this takes place in a few milliseconds so 
you don’t know its happening. Welcome to the 
brave new world of Internet marketing!
The Privacy Foundation has issued guidelines 
for Web beacon usage. The guidelines suggest that 
Web beacons should be visible as an icon on the 
screen, the icon should be labeled to indicate its 
function, and it should identify the name of the 
company that placed the Web beacon on the page. 
In addition, if a user clicks on the Web beacon, it 
should display a disclosure statement indicating 
what data is being collected, how the data is used 
after it is collected, what companies receive the 
data, what other data the Web beacon is combined

with, and whether or not a cookie is associated 
with the Web beacon. Users should be able to opt 
out of any data collection done by the Web beacon, 
and the Web beacon should not be used to collect 
information from Web pages of a sensitive nature, 
such as medical, financial, job-related, or sexual 
matters. Many sites have adopted the Network 
Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) self-regulatory 
guidelines, but these are only voluntary, and these 
guidelines have done little to assuage fears from 
Web users that their privacy is at risk.
One roadblock involves the meaning of Do 
Not Track. Industry wants an opt-in, default Track 
Me feature on all Web sites, while the government 
and privacy groups are pushing for an opt-out 
Do Not Track feature in which the default is Do 
Not Track, and which users can switch off for all 
sites at ones In July 2013, a working group com-
missioned by the W3C proposed that Web users 
should be able to tell advertising networks not to 
show them targeted advertisements. In 2014, the 
W3C announced that it had made major prog-
ress, advancing its work to the “last call” phase 
of review from the outside world.
Nearly all browsers now offer users the option 
of using a Do Not Track feature. But users have to 
remember to turn it on. In addition, not all Web 
sites honor the Do Not Track request, because they 
are not legally obligated to do so. Major Web sites 
and the online advertising industry insist their 
industry can self-regulate and preserve individual 
privacy. However, this solution has not worked in 
the past. In 2014, major companies like 
Yahoo and AOL abandoned the Do Not Track 
standard, citing the lack of traction that Do Not 
Track has encountered across the rest of the Web. 
Although some bigger Web sites like Twitter and 
Pinterest do follow the Do Not Track guidelines, 
these defections are setbacks for the standard. 
The situation in Europe is somewhat differ-
ent. In 2009, Article 5.3 of Directive 2002/58/EC 
(Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communica-
tions) was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, 
also known as the EU Cookie Law, which  provides 
that Web sites must ask visitors for their consent 
before they can install most cookies (although not 
cookies considered necessary for the basic func-
tion of a Web site, such as session cookies that are 
used to track a shopping cart). The directive also 
applies to Flash and HTML5 local storage. The 
Directive was first passed in 2009, and by 2015, all 
of the countries in the EU with the exception of the 
Czech Republic and Estonia had enacted legisla-
tion enabling it. (Germany has not implemented the 
Directive on the grounds that German law already 
covers the topic, although some data protection 
authorities dispute this view.) However, compliance 
with the law remains very spotty, with consultants 
KPMG finding that more than half of the organiza-
tions it analyzed in the U.K were still not compliant. 
The U.K. legal firm Bristows made similar findings 
with respect to countries throughout the EU in its 
survey of the status of the implementation of, and 
compliance with, the EU Cookie Law in 2015.

containing terabytes (trillions of bytes) of data on consumer behavior at a firm’s stores 
and Web sites. With a data warehouse, firms can answer such questions as: What 
products are the most profitable by region and city? What regional marketing cam-
paigns are working? How effective is store promotion of the firm’s Web site? Data 
warehouses can provide business managers with a more complete awareness of cus-
tomers through data that can be accessed quickly.
Data mining is a set of analytical techniques that look for patterns in the data of a 
database or data warehouse, or seek to model the behavior of customers. Web site data 
can be “mined” to develop profiles of visitors and customers. A customer profile is 
simply a set of rules that describe the typical behavior of a customer or a group of 
customers at a Web site. Customer profiles help to identify the patterns in group and 
individual behavior that occur online as millions of visitors use a firm’s Web site. For 
example, almost every financial transaction you engage in is processed by a data mining 
application to detect fraud. Phone companies closely monitor your cell phone use as 
well to detect stolen phones and unusual calling patterns. Financial institutions and cell 
phone firms use data mining to develop fraud profiles. When a user’s behavior conforms 
to a fraud profile, the transaction is not allowed or is terminated (Mobasher, 2007).
There are many different types of data mining. The simplest type is query-driven 
data mining, which is based on specific queries. For instance, based on hunches of 
marketers who suspect a relationship in the database or who need to answer a specific 
question, such as “What is the relationship between time of day and purchases of 
various products at the Web site?”, marketers can easily query the data warehouse and 
produce a database table that rank-orders the top 10 products sold at a Web site by each 
hour of the day. Marketers can then change the content of the Web site to stimulate 
more sales by highlighting different products over time or placing particular products 
on the home page at certain times of day or night.
Another form of data mining is model-driven. Model-driven data mining involves 
the use of a model that analyzes the key variables of interest to decision makers. For 
example, marketers may want to reduce the inventory carried on the Web site by remov-
ing unprofitable items that do not sell well. A financial model can be built showing the 
profitability of each product on the site so that an informed decision can be made.
A more fine-grained behavioral approach that seeks to deal with individuals as 
opposed to market segments derives rules from individual consumer behavior (along 
with some demographic information) (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2001a; Chan, 1999; 
Fawcett and Provost, 1996, 1997). Here, the pages actually visited by specific users 
are stored as a set of conjunctive rules. For example, if an individual visits a site and 
typically (“as a rule”) moves from the home page to the financial news section to the 
Asian report section, and then often purchases articles from the “Recent Developments 
in Banking” section, this person—based on purely past behavioral patterns—might 
be shown an advertisement for a book on Asian money markets. These rules can be 
constructed to follow an individual across many different Web sites.
There are many drawbacks to all these techniques, not least of which is that there 
may be millions of rules, many of them nonsensical, and many others of short-term dura-
tion. Hence, the rules need extensive validation and culling (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 
2001b). Also, there can be millions of affinity groups and other patterns in the data that

are temporal or meaningless. The difficulty is isolating the valid, powerful (profitable) 
patterns in the data and then acting on the observed pattern fast enough to make a sale 
that otherwise would not have been made. As we see later, there are practical difficulties 
and trade-offs involved in achieving these levels of granularity, precision, and speed.
Hadoop and the Challenge of Big Data 
Up until about five years ago, most data collected by organizations consisted of struc-
tured transaction data that could easily fit into rows and columns of relational database 
management systems. Since then, there has been an explosion of data from Web traffic, 
e-mail messages, and social media content (tweets, status messages), even music play­
lists, as well as machine-generated data from sensors. This data may be unstructured 
or semi-structured and thus not suitable for relational database products that organize 
data in the form of columns and rows. The popular term “Big Data” refers to this 
avalanche of digital data flowing into firms around the world largely from Web sites 
and Internet click stream data. The volumes of data are so large that traditional DBMS 
cannot capture, store, and analyze the data in a reasonable time. Some examples of Big 
Data challenges are analyzing 12 terabytes of tweets created each day to improve your 
understanding of consumer sentiment towards your products; 100 million e-mails in 
order to place appropriate ads alongside the e-mail messages; or 500 million call detail 
records to find patterns of fraud and churn. Big Data and the tools needed to deal with 
it really started with Google and other search engines. Google’s problem: it has to deal 
with 3.5 billion searches a day, and within milliseconds, display search results and place 
ads. For fun, do a search on “Big Data” and you’ll see Google respond with more than 
47 million results in .39 seconds. That’s much faster than you can read this sentence! 
Big Data usually refers to data in the petabyte and exabyte range—in other words, 
billions to trillions of records, often from different sources. Big Data is produced in 
much larger quantities and much more rapidly than traditional data collection mecha-
nisms. Even though tweets are limited to 140 characters each, Twitter generates more 
than 8 terabytes of data daily. According to the IDC technology research firm, data is 
more than doubling every two years, so the amount of data available to organizations 
is skyrocketing. The next frontier will be data derived from the Internet of Things 
(IoT). Making sense out of it quickly in order to gain a market advantage is critical. 
Marketers are interested in Big Data because it can be mined for patterns of 
consumer behavior and contain more interesting anomalies than smaller data sets, 
with the potential to provide new insights into customer behavior, weather patterns, 
financial market activity, or other phenomena. For instance, Evrythng, an IoT platform 
company, is partnering with Trueffect, a digital ad firm, to develop ways that marketers 
can use data generated by connected appliances and other devices in order to directly 
communicate with and target advertising with consumers. However, to derive business 
value from this data, organizations need new technologies and analytic tools capable 
of managing and analyzing nontraditional data along with their traditional enterprise 
data. A recent survey found that while marketers say Big Data is their biggest oppor-
tunity, only 14% are confident in their use of Big Data (Tadena, 2015).
To handle unstructured and semi-structured data in vast quantities, as well as struc-
tured data, organizations are using Hadoop. Hadoop is an open source software frame-

work managed by the Apache Software Foundation that enables distributed parallel 
processing of huge amounts of data across inexpensive computers. It breaks a Big Data 
problem down into subproblems, distributes them among up to thousands of inexpensive 
computer processing nodes, and then combines the result into a smaller data set that is 
easier to analyze. You’ve probably used Hadoop to find the best airfare on the Internet, 
get directions to a restaurant, search on Google, or connect with a friend on Facebook. 
Hadoop can process large quantities of any kind of data, including structured 
transactional data, loosely structured data such as Facebook and Twitter feeds, complex 
data such as Web server log files, and unstructured audio and video data. Hadoop 
runs on a cluster of inexpensive servers, and processors can be added or removed as 
needed. Companies use Hadoop to analyze very large volumes of data as well as for a 
staging area for unstructured and semi-structured data before it is loaded into a data 
warehouse. Facebook stores much of its data on its massive Hadoop cluster, which holds 
an estimated 300 petabytes, about 30,000 times more information than the Library of 
Congress. Yahoo uses Hadoop to track user behavior so it can modify its home page to 
fit user interests. Life sciences research firm NextBio uses Hadoop and HBase to process 
data for pharmaceutical companies conducting genomic research. Top database vendors 
such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, and Microsoft have their own Hadoop software 
distributions. Other vendors offer tools for moving data into and out of Hadoop or for 
analyzing data within Hadoop. In addition, there are many new tools being developed 
for Big Data analysis in addition to Hadoop. One example is Spark, an open source 
product being supported by IBM that can deliver results faster than Hadoop.
MARKETING AUTOMATION AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT 
(CRM) SYSTEMS
Marketing automation systems are software tools that marketers use to track all the 
steps in the lead generation part of the marketing process. The marketing process 
begins with making the potential customer aware of the firm and product, and recog-
nizing the need for the product. This is the beginning of a lead—someone who might 
buy. From there, consumers need to find you as they search for products; they will 
compare your products with your competitors’ offerings and at some point, choose to 
purchase. Software can help in each of these stages of the marketing process. A 
number of firms sell software packages that can visualize most of the online marketing 
activities of a firm and then track the progression from exposure to display ads, finding 
your firm on a search engine, directing follow-up e-mail and communications, and 
finally a purchase. Once leads become customers, customer relationship management 
systems take over the maintenance of the relationship. 
Customer relationship management systems are another important Internet mar-
keting technology. A customer relationship management (CRM) system is a 
repository of customer information that records all of the contacts that a customer has 
with a firm (including Web sites) and generates a customer profile available to every-
one in the firm with a need to “know the customer.” CRM systems also supply the 
analytical software required to analyze and use customer information. Customers 
come to firms not just over the Web but also through telephone call centers, customer 
service representatives, sales representatives, automated voice response systems, 
ATMs and kiosks, in-store point-of-sale terminals, and mobile devices (m-commerce).

Collectively, these are referred to as “customer touchpoints.” In the past, firms 
generally did not maintain a single repository of customer information, but instead 
were organized along product lines, with each product line maintaining a customer 
list (and often not sharing it with others in the same firm).
In general, firms did not know who their customers were, how profitable they 
were, or how they responded to marketing campaigns. For instance, a bank customer 
might see a television advertisement for a low-cost auto loan that included an 800-
number to call. However, if the customer came to the bank’s Web site instead, rather 
than calling the 800-number, marketers would have no idea how effective the televi-
sion campaign was because this Web customer contact data was not related to the 
800-number call center data. Figure 6.10 illustrates how a CRM system integrates 
customer contact data into a single system.
CRMs are part of the evolution of firms toward a customer-centric and marketing-
segment–based business, and away from a product-line–centered business. CRMs

customers interact with the 
firm

This is an example of a CRM system. The system captures customer information from all customer touchpoints as well 
as other data sources, merges the data, and aggregates it into a single customer data repository or data warehouse 
where it can be used to provide better service, as well as to construct customer profiles for marketing purposes. Online 
analytical processing (OLAP) allows managers to dynamically analyze customer activities to spot trends or problems 
involving customers. Other analytical software programs analyze aggregate customer behavior to identify profitable 
and unprofitable customers as well as customer activities.

are essentially a database technology with extraordinary capabilities for addressing 
the needs of each customer and differentiating the product or service on the basis of 
treating each customer as a unique person. Customer profiles can contain the follow-
ing information:
•	 A map of the customer’s relationship with the institution
•	 Product and usage summary data
•	 Demographic and psychographic data
•	 Profitability measures
•	 Contact history summarizing the customer’s contacts with the institution across 
most delivery channels
•	 Marketing and sales information containing programs received by the customer 
and the customer’s responses
•	 E-mail campaign responses
•	 Web site visits
•	 Mobile app downloads
With these profiles, CRMs can be used to sell additional products and services, 
develop new products, increase product utilization, reduce marketing costs, identify 
and retain profitable customers, optimize service delivery costs, retain high lifetime 
value customers, enable personal communications, improve customer loyalty, and 
increase product profitability. The goal is what is known as a “360-degree” view that 
enables a company to know what its customers buy, how they browse, what kinds of 
communications and offers will engage them, and more. Leading CRM vendors include 
Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, and SugarCRM, many of which offer cloud-
based versions of their CRM products. One issue facing cloud CRM providers and global 
companies that use those products is impending European Union data regulations that 
will require them to reassess how they use CRM data in order to avoid violating those 
regulations. All the major vendors offer cloud-based SaaS CRM applications.

UNDERSTANDING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF 
ONLINE MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
As we noted earlier, online marketing communications still comprise only a small part 
of the total marketing communications universe. While there are several reasons why 
this is the case, two of the main ones are concerns about how well online advertising 
really works and about how to adequately measure the costs and benefits of online 
advertising. We will address both of these topics in this section. But first, we will define 
some important terms used when examining the effectiveness of online marketing.
ONLINE MARKETING METRICS: LEXICON
In order to understand the process of attracting prospects via marketing communica-
tions and converting them into customers, you will need to be familiar with online 
marketing terminology. Table 6.7 lists some terms commonly used to describe the 

impacts and results of “traditional” online marketing such as display ads and e-mail 
campaigns. Metrics for social, mobile and local marketing are covered in Chapter 7.
The first nine metrics focus primarily on the success of a Web site in achieving 
audience or market share by “driving” shoppers to the site. These measures often 
substitute for solid information on sales revenue as e-commerce entrepreneurs seek 
to have investors and the public focus on the success of the Web site in “attracting 
eyeballs” (viewers).
Impressions are the number of times an ad is served. Click-through rate (CTR) 
measures the percentage of people exposed to an online advertisement who actually 
click on the advertisement. Because not all ads lead to an immediate click, the indus-
try has invented a term for a long-term hit called view-through rate (VTR), which 
measures the 30-day response rate to an ad. Hits are the number of HTTP requests 
received by a firm’s server. Hits can be misleading as a measure of Web site activity 
because a “hit” does not equal a page. A single page may account for several hits if 
the page contains multiple images or graphics. A single Web site visitor can generate 
hundreds of hits. For this reason, hits are not an accurate representation of Web traffic 
or visits, even though they are generally easy to measure; the sheer volume of hits can 
be huge—and sound impressive—but not be a true measure of activity. Page views 
are the number of pages requested by visitors. However, with increased usage of Web 
frames that divide pages into separate sections, a single page that has three frames will 
generate three page views. Hence, page views per se are also not a very useful metric.
Viewability rate is the percentage of ads (either display or video) that are 
actually seen by people online. See page 403 for a further discussion of the issue of 
viewability.
The number of unique visitors is perhaps the most widely used measure of a Web 
site’s popularity. The measurement of unique visitors counts the number of distinct, 
unique visitors to a Web site, regardless of how many pages they view. Loyalty mea-
sures the percentage of visitors who return in a year. This can be a good indicator of a 
site’s Web following, and perhaps the trust shoppers place in a site. Reach is typically 
a percentage of the total number of consumers in a market who visit a Web site; for 
example, 10% of all book purchasers in a year will visit Amazon at least once to shop 
for a book. This provides an idea of the power of a Web site to attract market share. 
Recency—like loyalty—measures the power of a Web site to produce repeat visits and 
is generally measured as the average number of days elapsed between shopper or 
customer visits. For example, a recency value of 25 days means the average customer 
will return once every 25 days.
Stickiness (sometimes called duration) is the average length of time visitors 
remain at a Web site. Stickiness is important to marketers because the longer the 
amount of time a visitor spends at a Web site, the greater the probability of a pur-
chase. However, equally important is what people do when they visit a Web site and 
not just how much time they spend there. 
The metrics described so far do not say much about commercial activity nor help 
you understand the conversion from visitor to customer. Several other measures are 
more helpful in this regard. Acquisition rate measures the percentage of visitors who 
register or visit product pages (indicating interest in the product). Conversion rate 
measures the percentage of visitors who actually purchase something. Conversion

rates can vary widely, depending on the success of the site. The average conver-
sion rate in the United States for e-commerce sites on traditional desktop computers 
was about 3.4% in 2014, compared to about 2.75% for tablet computers and 1.1% for 
smartphones. Clearly, Web sites viewed on desktops still remain the most effective 
vehicle for converting visitors into purchasers (Monetate, 2015). The browse-to-buy 
ratio measures the ratio of items purchased to product views. The view-to-cart ratio 
calculates the ratio of “Add to cart” clicks to product views. Cart conversion rate 
measures the ratio of actual orders to “Add to cart” clicks. Checkout conversion 
rate calculates the ratio of actual orders to checkouts started. Abandonment rate 
measures the percentage of shoppers who begin a shopping cart form but then fail to 
complete the form and leave the Web site. Abandonment rates can signal a number of 
potential problems—poor form design, lack of consumer trust, or consumer purchase 
uncertainty caused by other factors. Recent studies on shopping cart abandonment 
found abandonment rates ranging from 68% to 75% (Baymard, 2015). Among the 
reasons for abandonment were security concerns, customer just checking prices, 
couldn’t find customer support, couldn’t find preferred payment option, and the item 
being unavailable at checkout. Given that more than 80% of online shoppers gener-
ally have a purchase in mind when they visit a Web site, a high abandonment rate 
signals many lost sales. Retention rate indicates the percentage of existing customers 
who continue to buy on a regular basis. Attrition rate measures the percentage of 
customers who purchase once but never return within a year (the opposite of loyalty 
and retention rates).
Specific types of advertising have their own special metrics. For instance, for video 
ads, view time (how long the ad actually stays in view while it plays) and completion 
rate (how many viewers watch the entire video ad) are important factors. Research has 
shown that brand recall is significantly higher when the entire ad is watched, making 
the completion rate metric more meaningful to advertisers than the click-through 
rate (Adler, 2015).
E-mail campaigns also have their own set of metrics. Open rate measures the 
percentage of customers who open the e-mail and are exposed to the message. Gener-
ally, open rates are quite high, in the area of 50% or greater. However, some browsers 
open mail as soon as the mouse cursor moves over the subject line, and therefore 
this measure can be difficult to interpret. Delivery rate measures the percentage of 
e-mail recipients who received the e-mail. Click-through rate (e-mail) measures the 
percentage of e-mail recipients who clicked through to the offer. Finally, bounce-back 
rate measures the percentage of e-mails that could not be delivered.
There is a lengthy path from simple online ad impressions, Web site visits, and 
page views to the purchase of a product and the company making a profit (see Figure 
6.11). You first need to make customers aware of their needs for your product and 
somehow drive them to your Web site. Once there, you need to convince them you 
have the best value—quality and price—when compared to alternative providers. You

HOW WELL DOES ONLINE ADVERTISING WORK?
What is the most effective kind of online advertising? How does online advertising 
compare to offline advertising? The answers depend on the goals of the campaign, the 
nature of the product, and the quality of the Web site you direct customers toward. 
The answers also depend on what you measure. Click-through rates are interesting, 
but ultimately it’s the return on the investment (ROI) in the ad campaign that counts. 
More than 70% of marketing executives said they would spend even more on digital 
ads if ability to measure ROI improved (Tadena, 2015). Complicating matters is the 
difficulty of cross-platform attribution, which involves understanding how to assign 
appropriate credit to different marketing initiatives on a variety of platforms that may 
have influenced a consumer along the way to an ultimate purchase. There is increas-
ing recognition that first-click and last-click models that focus, as their names indicate, 
on either the first or last marketing channel or advertising format that a consumer 
engages with prior to a purchase, are no longer sufficient.

AN ONLINE CONSUMER PURCHASING MODEL
The conversion of visitors into customers, and then loyal customers, is a complex and long-term process that 
may take several months.

Table 6.8 lists the click-through rates for various types of online marketing com-
munications tools. There is a great deal of variability within any of these types, so the 
figures should be viewed as general estimates. Click-through rates on all these formats 
are a function of personalization and other targeting techniques. For instance, several 
studies have found that e-mail response rates can be increased 20% or more by adding 
social sharing links. And while the average Google click-through rate is less than 1%, 
some merchants can hit 10% or more by making their ads more specific and attract-
ing only the most interested people. Permission e-mail click-through rates have been 
fairly consistent over the last five years, in the 3%–5% range. Putting the recipient’s 
name in the subject line can double the click-through rate. (For unsolicited e-mail and 
outright spam, response rates are much lower, even though about 20% of U.S. e-mail 
users report clicking occasionally on an unsolicited e-mail.) The click-through rate for 
video ads may seem low, but it is twice as high as the rate for banner ads. For instance, 
research by PointRoll found that adding video to a rich media campaign increased 
interaction rates by over 17% on average (PointRoll, 2015). “Interaction” means the 
user clicks on the video, plays it, stops it, or takes some other action. 
How effective is online advertising compared to offline advertising? In general, 
the online channels (e-mail, search engine, display ads, video, and social, mobile, and 
local marketing) compare very favorably with traditional channels. This explains in 
large part why online advertising has grown so rapidly in the last five years. Search

engine advertising has grown to be one of the most cost-effective forms of marketing 
communications and accounts for, in large part, the growth of Google. Direct opt-in 
e-mail is also very cost-effective. This is, in part, because e-mail lists are so inexpensive 
and because opt-in e-mail is a form of targeting people who are already interested in 
receiving more information.
A study of the comparative impacts of offline and online marketing concluded that 
the most powerful marketing campaigns used multiple forms of marketing, including 
online, catalog, television, radio, newspapers, and retail store. Traditional media like 
television and print media remain the primary means for consumers to find out about 
new products even though advertisers have reduced their budgets for print media 
ads. Consumers who shop multiple channels are spending more than consumers 
who shop only with a single channel, in part because they have more discretionary 
income but also because of the combined number of “touchpoints” that marketers are 
making with the consumers. The fastest growing channel in consumer marketing is 
the multi-channel shopper.
THE COSTS OF ONLINE ADVERTISING
Effectiveness cannot be considered without an analysis of costs. Initially, most online 
ads were sold on a barter or cost per thousand (CPM) impressions basis, with 
advertisers purchasing impressions in 1,000-unit lots. Today, other pricing models 
have developed, including cost per click (CPC), where the advertiser pays a prene-
gotiated fee for each click an ad receives; cost per action (CPA), where the advertiser 
pays a prenegotiated amount only when a user performs a specific action, such as a 
registration or a purchase; and hybrid arrangements, combining two or more of these 
models (see Table 6.9).

While in the early days of e-commerce, a few online sites spent as much as $400 
on marketing and advertising to acquire one customer, the average cost was never 
that high. While the costs for offline customer acquisition are higher than online, 
the offline items are typically far more expensive. If you advertise in the Wall Street 
Journal, you are tapping into a wealthy demographic that may be interested in buying 
islands, jets, and expensive homes in France. A full-page black and white ad in the 
Wall Street Journal National Edition costs about $270,000, whereas other papers are 
in the $10,000 to $100,000 range. 
One of the advantages of online marketing is that online sales can generally be 
directly correlated with online marketing efforts. If online merchants can obtain 
offline purchase data from a data broker, the merchants can measure precisely just 
how much revenue is generated by specific banners or e-mail messages sent to 
prospective customers. One way to measure the effectiveness of online marketing 
is by looking at the ratio of additional revenue received divided by the cost of the 
campaign (Revenue/Cost). Any positive whole number means the campaign was 
worthwhile.
A more complex situation arises when both online and offline sales revenues 
are affected by an online marketing effort. A large percentage of the online audience 
uses the Web to “shop” but not buy. These shoppers buy at physical stores. Merchants 
such as Sears and Walmart use e-mail to inform their registered customers of special 
offers available for purchase either online or at stores. Unfortunately, purchases at 
physical stores cannot be tied precisely with the online e-mail campaign. In these 
cases, merchants have to rely on less precise measures such as customer surveys at 
store locations to determine the effectiveness of online campaigns.
In either case, measuring the effectiveness of online marketing communica-
tions—and specifying precisely the objective (branding versus sales)—is critical to 
profitability. To measure marketing effectiveness, you need to understand the costs 
of various marketing media and the process of converting online prospects into 
online customers.
In general, online marketing communications are more costly on a CPM basis 
than traditional mass media marketing, but are more efficient in producing sales. 
Table 6.10 shows costs for typical online and offline marketing communications. 
For instance, in 2015, the average cost for 30 seconds of commercial time during a 
prime-time network television broadcast is about $112,000, not including the cost 
to produce the advertisement. According to Nielsen, such an ad has an average CPM 
of $24.76. In contrast, a banner ad costs virtually nothing to produce and can be 
purchased for a cost of from $5–$10 per thousand impressions. Direct postal mail 
can cost 80 cents to $1 per household drop for a post card, while e-mail can be sent 
for virtually nothing and costs only $5–$15 per thousand targeted names. Hence, 
e-mail is far less expensive than postal mail on a CPM basis. Effective cost-per-
thousand (eCPM) is a metric that measures return on investment from an ad by 
dividing the total earnings from the ad by the total number of impressions in 
thousands.

“purchasing funnel.” We have characterized this as a process rather than a funnel that 
is composed of several stages: awareness, engagement, interaction, purchase, and 
post-purchase service and loyalty. Marketing analytics software collects, stores, 
analyzes, and graphically presents data on each of the stages in the conversion of 
shoppers to customers (see Figure 6.12). 
Marketing analytics packages can tell business managers how people become 
aware of their site, and where they come from (e.g., search, self-entered URL, e-mail, 
social campaigns, or off-line traditional print and TV ads), along with demographic, 
behavioral, and geographic information. Are shoppers coming from mobile devices, 
Facebook or Pinterest? This information can help managers decide the best ways to 
drive traffic, the so-called “in-bound” links to a site. Once on the Web site, analytics 
packages can record how engaged visitors are with the site’s content, measured in terms 
of pages viewed and duration on site. This information can allow managers to change 
the design or their sites, or change the content viewers are seeing. For instance, video 
testimonials from product users may be much more engaging than expert reviews 
or user text comments. In a social marketing world, where consumers’ opinions and 
behavior can be harvested and broadcast to their friends, an important intermediate 
step in the consumer conversion process is to encourage visitors to interact with your

MARKETING ANALYTICS AND THE ONLINE PURCHASING PROCESS

content and share their experiences, opinions, preferences, and behaviors with their 
friends, as well as other visitors to the site. Marketing analytics packages can track 
visitor interaction and help managers decide what content leads to higher levels of 
visitor interaction with friends and other visitors. The purchase activity on the shopping 
cart page is a major focus of analytics tools not just because this is where the revenue 
is generated, but also because this is where the customer frequently exits the entire 
site and the firm loses a potential sale. Current shopping cart abandonment is about 
75% in the United States, with little change over the last few years, and higher in other 
countries (eMarketer, Inc., 2015l). This seems like an extraordinary rate but, like most 
of the indicators discussed in this chapter, abandonment is a complex phenomenon 
and often not what it seems. Consumers use carts like a shopping list, and don’t 
complete the transaction immediately; they use it for price comparison and to know 
shipping costs, or taxes; they complete transactions later on a different device, such 
as a mobile phone. Another measure of near-purchase activity is the add-to-cart rate. 
Marketing analytics software can help managers tease out the meaning of behavior 
on a Web site’s shopping cart page. Finally, marketing analytics can help managers 
discover customer loyalty and post-purchase behavior. In an increasingly social market-
ing environment, marketing managers need to know how their products and services 
are being talked about on other sites, Facebook pages, or Twitter tweets, often called 
“buzz” or sentiment analysis. Are the comments positive or negative? What is the 
source of negative comments? Possible candidates are poor quality, high costs, poor 
warranty service, and shipping issues. 
The end objective of marketing analytics packages is to help business managers 
optimize the return on investment on their marketing efforts, and to do this by build-
ing a detailed understanding of how their consumers behave. Marketing analytics also 
allows managers to measure the impact of specific marketing campaigns involving, 
say, discounts, loyalty points, and special offers, as well as regional, or demographic-
based campaigns. Aside from its role in enhancing management decision making, 
and optimizing the effectiveness of building an e-commerce presence, marketing 
analytics packages also enable a near real-time marketing capability where managers 
are able to change the content of a Web site, respond to customer complaints and 
comments, and align campaigns with trending topics or news developments, all in 
a near real-time manner (real-time may be a matter of minutes or at most 24 hours) 
(MarketingLand, 2015).
While there are a great many marketing analytics firms and software packages 
on the market, the leaders are Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, IBM Digital Analyt-
ics, and Webtrends. Marketing analytics software is often part of a comprehensive 
package sold to corporations from hardware, to Web design tools, cloud services, and 
management expertise.

Real-Time Marketing
T
he holy grail of advertising and marketing is to deliver the right message 
to the right person at the right time. If this were possible, no one would 
receive ads they did not want to see, and then no advertising dollars 
would be wasted, reducing the costs to end users and increasing the effi-
ciency of each ad dollar. In the physical world, only a very rough approximation of this 
ideal is possible. Advertisers can buy television and radio spots, newspaper ads, and 
billboards based on broad demographics and interests of likely potential customers. The 
Internet promised to change this. On the Internet, ads supposedly could be targeted 
to individual consumers based on their personal characteristics, interests, and recent 
clickstream behavior. One early vision of e-commerce was a trade-off between privacy 
and efficiency: let us know more about you, and we will show you only the advertising 
and products you are interested in seeing, and even offer free content. E-commerce was 
supposed to end the mass advertising that exploded in the television era. 
But contrary to popular impressions and the fears of privacy advocates, most of the 
display ads shown to site visitors are marvelously irrelevant to visitors’ interests, both 
short-term and long-term. For this reason, the click-through rate for banner advertising 
is a stunningly low 0.03%, and the price of display ads has fallen to a few cents because 
of their poor performance. Check this out: visit Yahoo (the largest display advertiser on 
earth) on a desktop or laptop computer, look at the prominent ads shown on the right,

and ask yourself if you are really interested in the ad content at this moment in time. 
How about ever? Chances are slim you are interested at this moment, even if the ad 
is somewhat appropriate to your demographics. Often, it is an ad for something you 
are totally not interested in and never have been. Researchers have found that only 
20% of Internet users find that display ads on Web sites are relevant to their interests. 
Programmatic advertising promises to improve the targeting of ads, decreasing costs 
for advertisers, and making the Web less annoying to consumers by showing them ads 
that really are of interest to them. 
Programmatic advertising is an automated method that publishers use to sell their 
inventory (empty slots on their Web pages) to advertisers who want to buy ad space 
for their customers (brand and product owners looking to market their products and 
services). There are two kinds of programmatic advertising: auction-based real time 
bidding (RTB), and programmatic direct, where advertisers deal directly with publish-
ers in a semi-automated environment. 
Programmatic advertising platforms use Big Data repositories that contain per-
sonal information on hundreds of millions of online shoppers and consumers; analytic 
software to classify and search the database for shoppers with the desired charac-
teristics; and machine learning techniques to test out combinations of consumer 
characteristics that optimize the chance of a purchase resulting from exposure to an 
ad. All of this technology is designed to lower the cost, increase the speed, and increase 
the efficiency of advertising in an environment where there are hundreds of millions 
of Web pages to fill with ads, and millions of online consumers looking to buy at any 
given moment. Programmatic advertising allows advertisers to potentially show the 
right ad, at the right time, to just the right person, in a matter of milliseconds. To the 
extent this is true, display advertising becomes more effective, and perhaps could 
become as effective as search-based advertising, where it is much more obvious what 
the searcher is looking for, or interested in, at the moment of search. In 2015, RTB 
digital display advertising will total an estimated $11 billion in the United States, about 
42% of all online display advertising. Analysts believe programmatic advertising will 
grow to about $20 billion by 2016 and that by then, almost two-thirds of all U.S. ads 
will be placed programmatically. 
Currently, 45% of online display advertising is still done in a non-automated, 
traditional environment that involves e-mail, fax, phone, and text messaging. This is 
the world of the traditional insertion order: if you want to advertise in a newspaper 
or magazine, call the ad department and fill out an insertion order. In this environ-
ment, firms who want to sell products and services online hire advertising agencies to 
develop a marketing plan. The ad agencies learn from the firms what kinds of people 
they would like to contact online. The ad agencies pay data brokers or advertising 
networks like DoubleClick to help them identify where the online ads should be placed 
given the nature of the product and the specific characteristics the producer firms are 
looking for. For instance, let’s say a firm wants to market a new mountain bike to men 
and women, ages 24–35, who live in zip codes where mountain biking is a popular 
activity. Ad networks traditionally would direct the agency to direct purchases of ad 
space from Web sites that attract the mountain biking audience. 

	
C a s e  S t u d y 	

451
This traditional environment is expensive, imprecise, and slow, in part because 
of the number of people involved in the decision about where to place ads. Also, the 
technology used is slow, and the process of learning which of several ads is optimal 
could take weeks or months. The ads could be targeted to a more precise group of 
potential customers. While context advertising on sites dedicated to a niche product is 
very effective, there are many other Web sites visited by bikers that might be equally 
effective, and cost much less. 
The process is very different in a programmatic environment. Ad agencies have 
access to any of several programmatic ad platforms offered by Google, Yahoo, AOL, 
Facebook, and many smaller firms. Working with their clients, the ad agency more 
precisely defines the target audience to include men and women, ages 24–35, who 
live in zip codes where mountain biking is a popular activity, have mentioned biking 
topics on social network sites, have e-mail where mountain biking is discussed, make 
more than $70,000 a year, and currently do not own a mountain bike. The ad agency 
enters a bid expressed in dollars per thousand impressions for 200,000 impressions 
to people who meet the characteristics being sought. The platform returns a quote 
for access to this population of 200,000 people who meet the characteristics required. 
The quote is based on what other advertisers are willing to pay for that demographic 
and characteristics. The quote is accepted or denied. If accepted, the ads are shown 
to people as they move about the Web, in real-time. As people come on to various 
Web sites they visit, the automated program assesses whether they meet the desired 
characteristics, and displays the mountain bike ad with milliseconds to that person. 
The programmatic platforms also track the responses to the ads in real time, and can 
change to different ads and test for effectiveness based on the platform’s experience. 
Once the system learns from experience, it will focus on showing the most effective 
ads on the most productive Web sites. Programmatic direct (or premium) advertising 
uses the same platform, but publishers sell blocks of inventory to ad agencies rather 
than single impressions. This stabilizes their income, and puts them in closer contact 
with advertisers who can also exercise greater oversight over the publishers. 
The auto industry is a large user of programmatic advertising. Car brands are highly 
focused on specific demographic groups, income levels, and aspirations. A program-
matic campaign begins with the advertiser picking a demographic target, establishing 
a total budget for the campaign, and then choosing an RTB platform and competing 
for the delivery of an ad to that audience against other advertisers who may be other 
auto companies, retailers, or telecommunications providers. The ads are awarded and 
served automatically in millisecond-quick transactions handled by machines.
Despite its clear advantages, there are also several risks involved for all parties. 
Advertisers lose control over where their ads will appear on the Web. This is a threat 
to a brand if its products are shown on inappropriate sites. Advertisers lose some 
accountability for their expenditures because they cannot verify that their ads are 
actually being shown, and they must take the ad platform’s word that indeed the 
ads are being shown to real people. This is a transparency issue. Ghost sites and ad 
fraud complicate the picture as well. There are thousands of ghost sites on the Web 
that do nothing but attract clicks using various ruses. Ad networks record this traffic

and have little capability to determine if it is legitimate, and may show ads on these 
sites, which will generate fraudulent clicks that are paid for by the ad network and 
the advertising firm. 
Given the risks, many of the largest advertisers initially did not use program-
matic advertising, but that is rapidly changing. It was first used by publishers to sell 
inventory that was left over after the major ad campaigns had purchased the premium 
slots on Web pages. Programmatic platforms were inexpensive places to sell excess 
inventory. However, that is beginning to change as advertisers gain confidence and the 
platforms themselves improve their abilities to avoid inappropriate Web sites, purge 
ghost sites, and learn how to detect click fraud. In addition, a number of firms have 
stepped into the market with tools that address these concerns.
For instance, in 2014, Procter & Gamble announced that, going forward, it planned 
to buy 70%–75% of its U.S. digital media using programmatic methods. P&G is the 
largest advertiser in the country, spending $4.6 billion on advertising in the United 
States in 2014. In the past, P&G purchased premium online inventory at the top 100 
comScore sites through several different ad agencies and tracked performance using 
its internal staff. According to P&G’s Chief Marketing Officer Marc Pritchard, program-
matic advertising has allowed P&G to more precisely target its advertising at a good 
price, providing a good return on investment. Other companies are following suit. 
Cleaning supply company Clorox is devoting about 50% of its entire digital budget to 
programmatic advertising in 2015. 
However, some upstart Web publishers aimed at the millennial demographic are 
trying to buck the trend. Vox Media, Refinery29, and Mic have all rejected program-
matic advertising and will only sell advertising space directly to advertisers. These 
publishers object on the ground that programmatic advertising can degrade Web site 
functionality by slowing down how fast Web pages load in browsers while also clut-
tering the site with ads. Whether other Web publishers will follow this lead remains 
to be seen.
Case Study Questions
1.	 Pay a visit to your favorite portal and count the total ads on the opening page. 
Count how many of these ads are (a) immediately of interest and relevant to you, 
(b) sort of interesting or relevant but not now, and (c) not interesting or relevant. 
Do this 10 times and calculate the percentage of the three kinds of situations. 
Describe what you find and explain the results using this case. 
2.	 Advertisers use different kinds of “profiles” in the decision to display ads to 
customers. Identify the different kinds of profiles described in this case, and 
explain why they are relevant to online display advertising. 
3.	 How can display ads achieve search-engine–like results? 
4.	 Do you think instant display ads based on your immediately prior clickstream will 
be as effective as search engine marketing techniques? Why or why not?

K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the key features of the Internet audience, the basic concepts of consumer behavior and purchasing, and 
how consumers behave online.
•	
Key features of the Internet audience include the number of users online, the intensity and scope of use, 
demographics and aspects, the type of Internet connection, and community effects.
•	
Models of consumer behavior attempt to predict or explain what consumers purchase, and where, when, 
how much, and why they buy. Factors that impact buying behavior include cultural, social, and psycho-
logical factors.
•	
There are five stages in the consumer decision process: awareness of need, search for more information, 
evaluation of alternatives, the actual purchase decision, and post-purchase contact with the firm.
•	
The online consumer decision process is basically the same, with the addition of two new factors: Web 
site and mobile platform capabilities and consumer clickstream behavior.
Identify and describe the basic digital commerce marketing and advertising strategies and tools.
•	
A Web site is the major tool for establishing the initial relationship with the customer. 
•	
Search engine marketing and advertising allows firms to pay search engines for inclusion in the search 
engine index (formerly free and based on “objective” criteria), receiving a guarantee that their firm will 
appear in the results of relevant searches.
•	
Display ads are promotional messages that users can respond to by clicking on the banner and following 
the link to a product description or offering. Display ads include banner ads, rich media, video ads, and 
sponsorships.
•	
E-mail marketing sends e-mail directly to interested users, and has proven to be one of the most effective 
forms of marketing communications.
•	
Lead generation marketing uses multiple e-commerce presences to generate leads for businesses who later 
can be contacted and converted into customers.
•	
Affiliate marketing involves a firm putting its logo or banner ad on another firm’s Web site from which 
users of that site can click through to the affiliate’s site.
•	
Viral marketing is a form of social marketing that involves getting customers to pass along a company’s 
marketing message to friends, family, and colleagues.
•	
Social marketing and advertising involves using the social graph to communicate brand images and directly 
promote sales of products and services.
•	
Mobile and local marketing and advertising involves using display ads, search engine advertising, video ads, 
and mobile messaging on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, often using the 
geographic location of the user.
•	
Multi-channel marketing (combining offline and online marketing efforts) is typically the most effective. 
Although many e-commerce ventures want to rely heavily on online communications, marketing commu-
nications campaigns most successful at driving traffic have incorporated both online and offline tactics.
•	
Customer retention techniques for strengthening customer relationships include personalization, one-to-one 
marketing, and interest-based advertising, customization and customer co-production, and customer ser-
vice (such as CRMs, FAQs, live chat, intelligent agents, and automated response systems).
•	
Online pricing strategies include offering products and services for free, versioning, bundling, and dynamic 
pricing.

Identify and describe the main technologies that support online marketing.
•	
Web transaction logs—records that document user activity at a Web site. Coupled with data from the regis-
tration forms and shopping cart database, these represent a treasure trove of marketing information for 
both individual sites and the online industry as a whole.
•	
Tracking files—Various files, like cookies, Web beacons, Flash cookies, and apps, that follow users and 
track their behavior as they visit sites across the entire Web. 
•	
Databases, data warehouses, data mining, and profiling—technologies that allow marketers to identify 
exactly who the online customer is and what they want, and then to present the customer with exactly 
what they want, when they want it, for the right price.
•	
CRM systems—a repository of customer information that records all of the contacts a customer has with a 
firm and generates a customer profile available to everyone in the firm who has a need to “know the 
customer.”
Understand the costs and benefits of online marketing communications.
•	
Key terms that one must know in order to understand evaluations of online marketing communications’ 
effectiveness and its costs and benefits include:
•	
Impressions—the number of times an ad is served.
•	
Click-through rate—the number of times an ad is clicked.
•	
View-through rate—the 30-day response rate to an ad.
•	
Hits—the number of http requests received by a firm’s server.
•	
Page views—the number of pages viewed by visitors.
•	
Stickiness (duration)—the average length of time visitors remain at a site.
•	
Unique visitors—the number of distinct, unique visitors to a site.
•	
Loyalty—the percentage of purchasers who return in a year.
•	
Reach—the percentage of total consumers in a market who will visit a site.
•	
Recency—the average number of days elapsed between visits.
•	
Acquisition rate—the percentage of visitors who indicate an interest in the site’s product by register-
ing or visiting product pages.
•	
Conversion rate—the percentage of visitors who purchase something.
•	
Browse-to-buy ratio—the ratio of items purchased to product views.
•	
View-to-cart ratio—the ratio of “Add to cart” clicks to product views.
•	
Cart conversion rate—the ratio of actual orders to “Add to cart” clicks.
•	
Checkout conversion rate—the ratio of actual orders to checkouts started.
•	
Abandonment rate—the percentage of shoppers who begin a shopping cart form, but then fail to com-
plete the form.
•	
Retention rate—the percentage of existing customers who continue to buy on a regular basis.
•	
Attrition rate—the percentage of customers who purchase once, but do not return within a year.
•	
Open rate—the percentage of customers who open the mail and are exposed to the message.
•	
Delivery rate—the percentage of e-mail recipients who received the e-mail.
•	
Click-through rate (e-mail)—the percentage of e-mail recipients who clicked through to the offer.
•	
Bounce-back rate—the percentage of e-mails that could not be delivered.
•	
Studies have shown that low click-through rates are not indicative of a lack of commercial impact of 
online advertising, and that advertising communication does occur even when users do not directly 
respond by clicking. Online advertising in its various forms has been shown to boost brand awareness 
and brand recall, create positive brand perceptions, and increase intent to purchase.
•	
Effectiveness cannot be considered without analysis of cost. Typical pricing models for online marketing 
communications include barter, cost per thousand (CPM), cost per click (CPC), cost per action (CPA), 
hybrid models, and sponsorships.

•	
Online marketing communications are typically less costly than traditional mass media marketing. Also, 
online sales can generally be directly correlated with online marketing efforts, unlike traditional market-
ing communications tactics.

	 3.	 Use the Online Consumer Purchasing Model (Figure 6.11) to assess the effectiveness of an e-mail 
campaign at a small Web site devoted to the sales of apparel to the ages 18–26 young adult market in the 
United States. Assume a marketing campaign of 100,000 e-mails (at 25 cents per e-mail address). The 
expected click-through rate is 5%, the customer conversion rate is 10%, and the loyal customer retention 
rate is 25%. The average sale is $60, and the profit margin is 50% (the cost of the goods is $30). Does the 
campaign produce a profit? What would you advise doing to increase the number of purchases and loyal 
customers? What Web design factors? What communications messages?
	 4.	 Surf the Web for at least 15 minutes. Visit at least two different e-commerce sites. Make a list describing 
in detail all the different marketing communication tools you see being used. Which do you believe is 
the most effective and why?
	 5.	 Do a search for a product of your choice on at least three search engines. Examine the results page 
carefully. Can you discern which results, if any, are a result of a paid placement? If so, how did you 
determine this? What other marketing communications related to your search appear on the page?
	 6.	 Examine the use of rich media and video in advertising. Find and describe at least two examples of 
advertising using streaming video, sound, or other rich media technologies. (Hint: Check the sites of 
Internet advertising agencies for case studies or examples of their work.) What are the advantages and/
or disadvantages of this kind of advertising? Prepare a 3- to 5-page report on your findings.
	 7.	 Visit Facebook and examine the ads shown in the right margin. What is being advertised and how do you 
believe it is relevant to your interests or online behavior? You could also search on a retail product on 
Google several times, and related products, then visit Yahoo or another popular site to see if your past 
behavior is helping advertisers track you.

hen Reema Shetty and her longtime friend 
from high school, Alia Al Mazrouei, were 
kicking around ideas for a healthy fast 
food outlet in the United Arab Emirates, their mutual friend, 
Mohamad Bitar, suggested promoting Middle Eastern and 
Lebanese delicacies. By the time the trio was ready to open 
their first restaurant in Abu Dhabi in 2007, they were already 
dreaming big. They believed they could take a thousand-year-old 
vegetarian staple, whose main marketplace incarnation had 
been as street vendor food, to mall food courts and compete 
head to head with the likes of McDonald’s, Subway, and Sbarro.
Made from either ground chickpeas or fava beans, they 
reasoned that falafel could be marketed as a wholesome al-
ternative to typical food court fare. It had never been adapted 
for food court distribution, so they would have first mover 
advantage. By using the best ingredients, they would create a 
healthier, tastier product than the competition, and by diversify-
ing condiments and breads, they could appeal to a wide range 
of palates. 
To start, Just Falafel offered the Original, served with 
tahini and pickles in pita bread, a Greek version with Tzatziki 
dressing and olives on tortilla bread, and an Indian version with spicy Indian dressing and 
cucumber pickles, also on tortilla bread. By 2010, the company had five locations and had 
gained acclaim as the caterer for some of the UAE’s biggest sporting events. Mexican, 
Italian, Lebanese, American, and Japanese flavors were added, and Just Falafel began 
soliciting suggestions for an Emirati version on its Facebook page. A YouTube channel was 
launched shortly thereafter. Though not quite sure yet how to leverage their social media 
channels, the founders had a new dream: global expansion. Franchising was the only way 
to achieve their ambitious plans for growth. Just Falafel would need partners on the retail 
front-end so that it could reinvest on the back-end. Fadi Malas was brought on board as 
CEO in March and the official start of Just Falafel’s franchising plan was trumpeted on 
Facebook: “Falafill Your Ambitions. Become a Franchisee.”
Five new franchises were quickly sold through the Just Falafel Web site for 60,000 
dirhams (Dhs) each. Franchisees need approximately an additional 300,000 to 500,000 
Dhs to set up shop, for a total investment of between U.S. $100,000 and U.S. $150,000. 
The Web site was garnering ten to fifteen franchise inquiries a day, and by year end, 25 
had been sold. Success offline was translating to Facebook fans online, supported by more

active management of the page. By communicating how Just Falafel was growing, where 
new stores were opening, what new menu items were being considered, and numerous 
other facets of the business, Just Falafel began building an online community. By the end 
of 2011, Just Falafel celebrated its 100,000th fan just as its first outlet outside the UAE 
opened in Amman, Jordan. 
Just Falafel’s franchising efforts snowballed once the company launched a Facebook 
advertising campaign linking to a franchise application page. Applications began pouring 
in from across the Gulf region and from as far afield as India and Canada. Bitar, now 
the managing director, quickly realized that Facebook could give Just Falafel the highest 
possible exposure and serve as its main communication highway—and an economical one 
at that. The total advertising outlay was between U.S. $300,000 and U.S. $400,000, a 
pittance compared to established fast food operators. CEO Malas believed Facebook was 
Just Falafel’s best chance of reaching both local markets and a global audience. Bitar 
estimated that Just Falafel achieved a nineteen-fold return on investment from the media 
spend (over U.S. $8 million in sales). Using Facebook’s built-in measurement tools, it 
targeted people over the age of 25 with disposable income over U.S. $200,000, mixed with 
less granular general consumer targeting. The over 7 million Facebook impressions Just 
Falafel now records daily would otherwise have been unattainable. Traditional marketing 
and media channels would have cost millions of dollars per month. In 2014, Malas said 
that approximately 90% of its advertising and digital media budgets are focused on 
Facebook, yielding 1.5 billion impressions for Just Falafel over the previous year.
Facebook is also used to prime new markets, educating prospective consumers about 
falafel in general and Just Falafel’s unique spin. Before a single outlet has opened, country 
pages are created to actively seek followers. Location pages follow after a franchise 
has opened. Just Falafel averages 25,000 fans per outlet, ten times more than all other 
quick service restaurants (QSR) globally. To help build its fan base, Just Falafel sponsors 
local sporting, fashion, and film events. Once there is a sufficient following, it shares its 
franchising ambitions and invites interested parties to submit a form. And, of course, 
Facebook is used to launching marketing campaigns and driving customers to its locations. 
Just Falafel is one of very few companies to have had case studies conducted on its use 
of social media by Facebook more than once. 
By March 2013, Just Falafel was averaging 100 franchise information requests per 
day, with the total number of inquiries exceeding 12,000. The menu had been steadily 
broadened to complement Just Falafel’s healthful vegetarian niche. Mexican-style falafel 
burritos and quesadillas and a baked version of the bean patty were joined by three organic 
salads made from locally grown produce. The company began to use Twitter in tandem 
with Facebook as a tactical tool to reach influencers and provide customer service. In its 
own case study of the social network marketing phenomenon, Netizency found that Just 
Falafel used Twitter’s location-based, follower-based, and interest-based targeting tools to 
achieve nearly 9 million impressions, 170,000 engagements, and over 10,000 followers. 
Over 10% of the sales fluctuations at its London location were attributed to changes in 
Just Falafel’s Twitter ad spend, and a targeted franchising campaign in Turkey yielded 
455,000 impressions, 4,000 Web site visits, and 43 applications.

The bulk of its nearly 2 million Facebook fans hail from 45 nations targeted for 
expansion, including Ireland, Australia, Brazil, and the United States. More than a quarter 
of its fans are from India. With vegetarians comprising 60% of its population, India is a 
natural fit for Just Falafel. In 2014, Just Falafel opened stores in India, Egypt, Australia, 
Canada, and the United States.  However, in 2015, Just Falafel’s plans for growth tempo-
rarily stalled, with many of the company’s outlets in newer areas of expansion, such as the 
UAE, Jordan, Lebanon, and the United Kingdom, losing money and closing their doors. 
Admitting that perhaps the company had focused too much on expansion and growth at 
the expense of core elements of its business, and that maintaining and optimizing different 
menus in a wide array of countries was unexpectedly difficult, Just Falafel announced that 
the company would slow its growth slightly going forward, focusing more on profitability 
and running its own higher-quality restaurants as opposed to relying on franchisees.
Just Falafel has taken the opportunity to rededicate itself to its food in 2015, hoping 
to improve its selection beyond falafel and to improve its recipes. After sampling items 
from the menu and detecting a dip in quality, Bitar hired a new chef and led an effort to 
improve its offerings. Just Falafel totally revamped its menu, dropping fava beans and 
using exclusively chickpeas in its falafel recipe, improving its hummus using techniques 
from street vendors, and offering choices of sweet potato wedges, among many other 
changes. After gathering data from its customers, Just Falafel was surprised to discover 
that nearly 90% of its customers are also meat-eaters, so the company added meat and 
chicken items to the menu as well. The new menu is devoid of preservatives and boasts 
reduced calorie counts. To emphasize the changes in both company structure and menu 
offerings, the company has rebranded itself as JF Street Food. The company also plans 
to delay an initial public offering of shares until it matures a bit more as a company. 
Although Just Falafel has pivoted slightly from its ambitious goals of global growth, the 
company still plans to open new franchises in the United States, Canada, and Europe to 
go along with its over 40 restaurants across 11 countries as of 2015, including two new 
locations in the UAE in July 2015.

INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL, MOBILE, AND LOCAL 
MARKETING
Social, mobile, and local marketing have transformed the online marketing landscape. 
Before 2007, Facebook was a fledgling company limited to college students. Apple 
had not yet announced the iPhone. Online marketing consisted largely of creating a 
corporate Web site, buying display ads on Yahoo, purchasing AdWords on Google, and 
sending e-mail. The workhorse of online marketing was the display ad that flashed 
brand messages to millions of users who were not expected to respond immediately, 
ask questions, or make observations. The primary measure of success was how many 
“eyeballs” (unique visitors) a Web site produced, and how many “impressions” a mar-
keting campaign generated. An impression was one ad shown to one person. Both 
of these measures were carryovers from the world of television, which measures 
marketing in terms of audience size and ad views. 
FROM EYEBALLS TO CONVERSATIONS
After 2007, everything began to change, with the rapid growth of Facebook and 
other social network sites, the explosive growth of smartphones beginning with 
Apple iPhone in 2007, and the growing interest in local marketing. What’s different 
about the new world of social-mobile-local marketing and advertising are the related 
concepts of “conversations” and “engagement.” Marketing today is based on busi-
nesses marketing themselves as partners in multiple online conversations with their 
customers, potential customers, and even critics. Your brand is being talked about 
on the Web and social media (that’s the conversation part). Today, marketing your 
firm and brands requires you to locate, identify, and participate in these conversa-
tions. Social marketing means all things social: listening, discussing, interacting, 
empathizing, and engaging. Rather than bombarding your audience with fancier, 
louder ads, instead have a conversation with them and engage them in your brand. 
The emphasis in online marketing has shifted from a focus on eyeballs to a focus on 
participating in customer-oriented conversations. In this sense, social marketing and 
advertising is not simply a “new ad channel,” but a collection of technology-based 
tools for communicating with shoppers.
In the past, businesses could tightly control their brand messaging and lead con-
sumers down a funnel of cues that ended in a purchase. That is not true of social 
marketing. Consumer purchase decisions are increasingly driven by the conversations, 
choices, tastes, and opinions of the consumer’s social network. Social marketing is all 
about businesses participating in and shaping this social process. 
FROM THE DESKTOP TO THE SMARTPHONE AND TABLET
Today, social, mobile, and local marketing are the fastest growing forms of online 
marketing. It’s taken eight years for this new landscape to fully emerge since 
2007, and firms are still learning how to use the new social and mobile marketing 
technologies. 

In 2015, spending on mobile marketing worldwide will be almost triple the amount 
spent on social marketing. By 2017, it is estimated that mobile marketing spending 
will account for around €125 billion annually, while social marketing will be about €37 
billion. While social marketing is expected to grow by around 30% a year for the next 
several years, mobile is growing at over 70% in 2015, but it is also expected to have 
an average of 30% growth over the next few years as the market becomes saturated 
with mobile ads (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). This figure underestimates the total social 
marketing spending because of the high percentage of visits to social networks that 
originate from a mobile device. For instance, Twitter reports that over 75% of their 
monthly active users access Twitter from a mobile device; over 45% of Facebook’s 
active user base are mobile-only members (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b; Twitter, 2015). 
A substantial part of the mobile marketing spending should be counted as “social” 
marketing. Nevertheless, the figure indicates the extraordinary impact that mobile 
devices are having on marketing expenditures. 
Figure 7.2 puts the social-mobile-local forms of advertising into the context of 
the total U.S. online advertising market. Traditional online marketing (browser-based 
search and display ads, and e-mail marketing) still constitutes the majority of all online

marketing, but it is growing much more slowly than social-mobile-local marketing. 
Local online marketing is currently larger than mobile  marketing, but by 2017, it is 
estimated that mobile will surpass it. As with social and mobile, there is significant 
overlap between local and mobile and social marketing, with much of local marketing 
also either social or mobile, or both. By 2017, it is expected that social-mobile-local 
marketing will be more than 50% of all online marketing. The marketing dollars are 
following customers and shoppers from the desktop computer to mobile devices, with 
smartphones having a substantial lead over tablets. 
THE SOCIAL, MOBILE, LOCAL NEXUS
Social, mobile, and local digital marketing are self-reinforcing and connected. ­ 
For instance, as mobile devices become more powerful, they are more useful for 
accessing Facebook and other social sites. As mobile devices become more widely 
adopted, they can be used by customers to find local merchants, and for merchants to 
alert customers in their neighborhood to special offers. Over time, these will become 
more overlapped as the three platforms become more tightly coupled. 
About 78% of Facebook’s ad revenue is generated by its mobile audience. Mobile 
constitutes an even larger share of Twitter’s ad revenues—over 90%! Local marketing 
and mobile are highly related: local advertisers most often target mobile devices. 
And a considerable amount of mobile ad spending comes from local advertisers. The 
strong ties among social, mobile, and local marketing have significant implications for 
managing your own marketing campaign in this new environment. The message is 
Traditional desktop marketing, including most of local marketing to local audiences, remains the largest part 
of all online marketing. Mobile marketing is aimed often at local audiences and is the fastest growing form 
of online marketing, followed closely by social marketing on social networks. Mobile local is in its infancy 
but it is also growing far faster than traditional desktop marketing.

that when you design a social marketing campaign, you must also consider that your 
customers will be accessing the campaign using mobile devices, and often they will 
also be looking for local content. Social-mobile-local must be seen in an integrated 
management framework.
In the sections that follow we will examine social, mobile, and local marketing 
more closely. The focus will be on describing the primary marketing tools of each 
platform and how to envision and manage a marketing campaign on each platform.
	 7.2	
SOCIAL MARKETING
Social marketing differs markedly from traditional online marketing. The objectives 
of traditional online marketing are to put your business’s message in front of as many 
visitors as possible and hopefully encourage them to come to your Web site to buy 
products and services, or to find out more information. The more “impressions” (ad 
views) you get, and the more unique visitors to your site, the better. Traditional online 
marketing never expected to listen to customers, much less have a conversation with 
them, any more than TV advertisers expected to hear from viewers. 
In social marketing, the objective is to encourage your potential customers to 
become fans of your company’s products and services, and engage with your business 
by entering into a conversation with it. Your further objective is to encourage your 
business’s fans to share their enthusiasm with their friends, and in so doing create a 
community of fans online. Ultimately, the point is to strengthen the brand and drive 
sales, and to do this by increasing your “share of online conversation.” There is some 
reason to believe that social marketing is more cost effective than traditional marketing 
although this is still being explored.
SOCIAL MARKETING PLAYERS
There are hundreds of social network sites worldwide, but the most popular sites 
(Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Tumblr) account for over 
90% of all visits. (See Chapter 10, Section 10.1 for a full discussion of social networks.)
While the number of monthly unique visitors is a good measure of market reach, 
it is not helpful in understanding engagement—the amount and intensity of user 
involvement in a site. One measure of engagement is the amount of time users spend 
on a site. Figure 7.3 illustrates engagement at the top social network sites.
On measures of engagement, Facebook once again dominates, accounting for 85% 
of the total monthly visitor minutes, a whopping 230 billion minutes per month in the 
United States. The average U.S. Facebook user spent more than 18 hours a month on 
Facebook. Tumblr takes second place, followed by Pinterest and Twitter. 
For a manager of a social marketing campaign, these findings suggest that in terms 
of reach and engagement, the place to start a social campaign is Facebook. Yet visitors 
to the other leading social sites collectively account for an additional 15% of the social 
market space, and therefore, a social marketing campaign also has to include them at 
some point. It helps that social network users use multiple social sites. Facebook users

Frommer, 2015. 
are likely to be users at Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram. In addition, mar-
keters need to be aware of what has come to be known as dark social. Dark social 
refers to those forms of social sharing that occur off the major social networks, through 
alternative communication tools such as interpersonal conversations, group meetings, 
and friendships, not to mention e-mail, instant messages, texts, and mobile messaging 
apps. While online social network users spend over 30 hours a month on average on 
all networks combined, there are 720 total hours in a month. Therefore, about 4% of 
all social life in a month involves online social networks, while 96% does not. 
THE SOCIAL MARKETING PROCESS
At first glance the large number of different social sites is confusing, each with a 
unique user experience to offer, from Twitter’s micro blogging text messaging service, 
to Tumblr’s blogging capability, and to graphical social sites like Pinterest and Insta-
gram. Yet they can all be approached with a common framework. Figure 7.4 illustrates 
a social marketing framework that can be applied to all social, mobile, and local 
marketing efforts.
There are five steps in the social marketing process: Fan acquisition, engagement, 
amplification, community, and brand strength (sales). Each of these steps in the 
process can be measured. The metrics of social marketing are quite different from 
those of traditional Web marketing or television marketing. This is what makes social 
marketing so different—the objectives and the measures. This will become more 
apparent as we describe marketing on specific social sites.

Social marketing campaigns begin with fan acquisition, which involves using 
any of a variety of means, from display ads to News Feed and page pop-ups, to attract 
people to your Facebook page, Twitter feed, or other platform like a Web page. It’s 
getting your brand “out there” in the stream of social messages. Display ads on social 
sites have a social dimension (sometimes called “display ads with social features” or 
simply “social ads”). Social ads encourage visitors to interact and do something social, 
such as participate in a contest, obtain a coupon, or obtain free services for attracting 
friends.
The next step is to generate engagement, which involves using a variety of tools 
to encourage users to interact with your content and brand located on your Facebook 
or Web pages. You can think of this as “starting the conversation” around your brand. 
You want your fans to talk about your content and products. You can generate engage-
ment through attractive photos, interesting text content, and blogger reports, with 
plenty of opportunities for users to express opinions. You can also provide links to 
Pinterest photos of your products or fan comments on blog sites like Tumblr. 
Once you have engaged visitors, you can begin to use social site features to 
amplify your messages by encouraging users to tell their friends by clicking a Like or 
+1 button, or by sending a message to their followers on Twitter. Amplification 
involves using the inherent strength of social networks. On Facebook, the average 
user has 120 “friends.” This includes all people they have ever friended, including 
people whom they don’t really know (and who don’t really know them). Facebook 
users typically have only three to four close friends with whom they can discuss 
confidential matters, and a larger set of around 20 friends with whom they have 
two-way communications (mutual friends). Let’s use 20 as a reasonable number of 
mutual friends for marketing purposes. For marketers, this means that if they can 
attract one fan and encourage that fan to share his or her approval with his or her 
friends, the message can be amplified twenty times: 20 friends of the one fan can be 
influenced. Best of all: the friends of fans are free. Marketers pay to attract only the 
initial fan and they are not charged by social sites (currently) for the amplification 
that can result. 
Once you have gathered enough engaged fans, you will have created the founda-

communicating with one another over a substantial period of time (say several months 
or more). Marketers have a number of tactics to nurture these communities, including 
inside information on new products, price breaks for loyalty, and free gifts for bringing 
in new members. The ultimate goal is to enlarge your firm’s “share of the online 
conversation.” The process ends with strengthening the brand and, hopefully, addi-
tional sales of products and services. Brand strength can be measured in a variety of 
ways both online and offline, a subject that is beyond the boundaries of this text (Aila-
wadi et al., 2003; Aaker, 1996; Simon and Sullivan, 1993; Keller, 1993).
Ultimately, the point of marketing is to drive sales revenue. Measuring the impact 
of a social marketing campaign on brand strength and sales is still being explored by 
marketers, social site managers, and researchers, but generally the results are posi-
tive: social marketing campaigns drive sales. In 2015, most of the top social network 
sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, have added, or are in the 
processing of adding, social commerce features, such as Buy buttons and other shop-
ping functionality that makes it even easier for the targets of those social marketing 
campaigns to act on them and make a purchase.
FACEBOOK MARKETING 
Nearly everyone reading this book has a Facebook page. There are power users who 
spend hours a day on the site, some with thousands of “friends,” and there are casual 
users who have a small set of perhaps 20 friends and relatives. While most have a basic 
understanding of Facebook, it’s worthwhile to review the major features of Facebook 
before discussing its marketing potential. 
Basic Facebook Features
Facebook describes itself as having three pillars: News Feed, Timeline (Profile), and  
Search. Facebook also has many other features that are equally important to its poten-
tial as a marketing platform. Table 7.1 describes these features.
Reviewing Table 7.1, it is clear that Facebook is built to encourage people to reveal 
as much personal information about themselves as feasible, including activities, behav-
ior, photos, music, movies, purchases, and preferences. One result is that Facebook is 
the world’s largest repository of deeply personal behavioral information on the Inter-
net. Facebook knows a great deal more about its users than Google does about its users. 
Second, Facebook’s features are built to maximize the connections among people in 
the form of notifications, tagging, messaging, posting, and sharing. In many instances, 
the movement of personal information is so widespread that it is beyond the under-
standing of users and outside observers. The effect of these two factors is to greatly 
magnify the social density of the Facebook audience. Social density refers to the 
number of interactions among members of a group and reflects the “connectedness” 
of a group, even if these connections are forced on users. For instance, some natural 
groups of people are not very “social” and few messages flow among members. Other 
natural groups are loquacious and chatty with many messages flowing among 
social density 
refers to the number of 
interactions among 
members of a group and 
reflects the “connected-
ness” of a group, even if 
these connections are 
forced on users

TABLE 7.1	
BASIC FACEBOOK FEATURES
F E A T U R E
D E S C R I P T I O N
Profile 
As part of account creation, you create a profile that includes certain personal information. The profile 
may also include photos and other media. Establishes baseline information that will be shared with 
friends. 
Friend search 
Helps you find friends who are already using Facebook, as well as friends who are not, typically by 
searching your e-mail contact list. Creates your baseline social network based on prior contacts. 
Timeline 
A history of your actions on Facebook, including photos, history of posts, and comments to your News 
Feed, as well as life events that you post and want others to see as a part of your profile. Additions you 
make to your Timeline may appear on your friends’ News Feed. Creates additional links with friends. 
Tagging
Ability to tag photos, status updates, check-ins, or comments with the names of friends. Tagging links to 
that person’s Timeline and News Feed. Your friends are notified they have been tagged, and you are 
linked to their Timeline. Friends of your friends may also be notified. Whenever Facebook detects the 
person in a new image, it notifies all those who have tagged the photo that this friend appears in a new 
photo that you can link to. The tagging tool is designed to create additional connections among users. 
News Feed
The center of the action on Facebook Home pages, News Feed is a continuously updated list of stories 
from friends and Pages that you have liked on Facebook. Ads running in the News Feed are the major ad 
revenue producer for Facebook. News Feed stories include status updates, photos, videos, links, app 
activity, and Likes. Provides a continual stream of messages from friends and advertisers. 
Trending
Facebook’s version of trending topics; appears at top of right-hand column next to News Feed
Status update
A way to post your comments, observations, and location to all your friends. 
Like button
The ubiquitous Like button communicates your support of comments, photos, activities, brands, articles, 
and products to your friends, and also to the Facebook social graph and third-party marketers. The Like 
button lives on virtually all Facebook content including status updates, photos, comments, brands, 
timelines, apps, and even ads. The Like button also appears on external sites, mobile and social apps, and 
ads. These sites are utilizing Facebook's Like social plug-in, and when you Like something outside of 
Facebook, it appears on your Timeline, where friends can comment on the activity. The Like button is one 
way Facebook knows what other sites you visit.
Apps 
Facebook apps are built by third-party developers, and add functionality to Facebook. Apps run the 
gamut from games (Candy Crush Saga; FarmVille) to photos (Instagram, now part of Facebook), music 
(Spotify), and publications (Washington Post Social Reader). Your personal information and that of your 
friends is shared with apps that you install. Most Facebook apps are free, and most rely on revenues 
from advertising that they expose you to. 
Open Graph
A feature used by app developers to integrate their apps into the Facebook pages of users who sign up 
for the app, and in that sense, it opens the Facebook social graph to the developer, who can then use all 
the features of Facebook in the app. For instance, this feature allows your performance on game apps to 
be sent to your Friend’s News Feeds. Supports the development of social apps and increases links among 
users.
Search 
In July 2013, Facebook introduced Graph Search, a “social” search engine that searched your social 
network for answers to queries. It was a “semantic” search engine insofar as it provided a single answer 
rather than a list of links based on an algorithm’s estimate of user intentions. It was also a “hybrid” 
search engine that relied on Bing to supplement results. In 2015, Facebook significantly expanded its 
Search functionality. It now includes everyone’s public posts, Likes, photos, and interests, and makes 
them available to all users of Facebook, friends or not.

members. The scope, intensity, and depth of Facebook’s repository of personal infor-
mation and rich social network present extraordinary marketing opportunities. 
Facebook Marketing Tools
Facebook offers a number of marketing and advertising opportunities and tools for 
branding and developing community on its site. 
Like Button  The Like and Share buttons on Facebook, and similar buttons such as +1 
on other social sites, are perhaps the single most important element in the rise of 
social marketing. “Like” is the engine of social marketing. The Like button was intro-
duced by Facebook on its own Web site in 2009 and rolled out as a plug-in to other 
Web sites in 2010. Unlike traditional Web advertising, the Like button gives users a 
chance to share their feelings about content and other objects they are viewing and 
Web sites they are visiting. It’s a way for users to express their opinions to their friends 
about their Web experience. With Like buttons on millions of Web sites, Facebook can 
track user behavior on other sites and then sell this information to marketers. 
Like gives Big Data real meaning. Analysts estimate that each hour, Facebook 
records 30 million likes and processes 180 million posts and 9 million messages. 
Facebook’s Like and Share buttons are embedded in more than 13 million Web sites 
worldwide (Bullas, 2015; Facebook, 2015; Lecher, 2015).
Brand Pages  Facebook’s early efforts at brand marketing focused on the develop-
ment of brand pages as a means for firms to establish a direct relationship with their 
current and potential customers. Nearly all Fortune 1000 companies, and hundreds 
of thousands of smaller firms, have Facebook brand pages, similar to brand Web sites, 
on Facebook as an adjunct to their main Web site. The purpose of a brand page is 
to develop fans of the brand by providing users opportunities to interact with the 
brand through comments, contests, and offerings. Using social calls to action, such as 
“Like us on Facebook” and “Share,” brand pages can escape their isolation and make 
it more easily into users’ social networks, where friends can hear the message. In 
October 2015, Facebook announced that it would offer a new Shopping/Services tab 
for Facebook brand pages that will feature products and services, taking it further into 
the realm of social e-commerce.
Social brand pages have many more social opportunities for fans to like and 
comment than are typical of traditional Web pages. However, corporate Web sites have, 
over time, adopted many social features and the two are now often indistinguishable. 
Brand pages on Facebook typically attract more visitors than a brand’s Web site. 
Brands can get exposure on Facebook either organically or via paid advertise-
ments. Organic reach is free, and happens when fans see the brand’s updates and 
posts in their News Feed, or when others who are not fans see that content because 
a fan liked, commented, or shared the post (viral reach). In order to ensure that they 
get the exposure that they want for their marketing messages, most companies choose 
one of the paid advertising formats discussed below. 
Facebook enables you to choose from a variety of different marketing objectives, 
including promoting your Page posts/ads (Page Post Engagement); obtaining Likes for

content and other objects 
they are viewing

your Facebook page to grow your company’s audience and brand (Page Likes); getting 
people to click through to your Web site (Clicks to Web sites); getting people to take 
certain actions on your Web site (Web site Conversions); getting people to install an 
app (App Installs); getting people to use an app (App Engagement); creating offers for 
people to redeem (Offer Claims); and getting people to watch a video (Video Views). 
Once you have chosen a marketing objective, the next decision is to whom you 
want to target the advertisement. Facebook ads can be targeted based on location, 
age, interest, gender, education level, relationship status, and political views, as well 
as to custom audiences defined by the marketer. Facebook can also create what it 
calls a “lookalike audience” based on demographics shared with the custom audience 
identified by the marketer. 
Once the marketing objectives and audience have been determined, the next 
decision is where to place the advertisement. Facebook has four basic locations from 
which to choose: the News Feed, the right-hand column or sidebar section of Facebook 
pages, and the mobile News Feed. Ads can also be placed within apps. 
News Feed Page Post Ads  The News Feed is the most prominent place for adver-
tisements. The News Feed is the center of the action for Facebook users and where 
Facebook users spend most of their time because that is where posts from their friends 
appear. Page Post Ads appear in a user’s News Feed along with all of the other posts 
and status updates that normally appear from friends. Page Post Ads have a tiny tag 
that indicates that they are sponsored (i.e., are advertisements) but otherwise look 
very similar to posts from friends. Sometimes the ads have a social context (“John 
Smith and Jane Doe like Pottery Barn”) and can be liked, shared, and commented 
on, just like any other post. Page Post Ads can contain text, photos, video, and links. 
They can be used for many of the marketing objectives mentioned above, such as 
increasing brand engagement, obtaining Likes for the brand’s Facebook page, and 
encouraging app installs and engagement. In 2015, Facebook is also pilot testing a Buy 
button that will appear in News Feed Page Post Ads that will allow people to purchase 
items without leaving Facebook. Companies pay to promote or boost Page Post Ads 
in order to extend their reach. This has become increasingly important as Facebook 
has reduced the organic reach that brands previously enjoyed for free in an effort to 
increase advertising revenues (Vahl, 2014; Ernoult, 2014). 
Right-Hand Column Sidebar Ads  These display ads are located in the right-hand 
column or sidebar of Facebook pages. They are often used to direct users to off-
Facebook content such as Web site landing pages and content offers. Facebook has 
recently reduced the number of ads that appear in the right-hand column sidebar from 
seven to two, increased their size, and made them consistent with the format of News 
Feed Page Post Ads in an effort to enhance their performance. 
Mobile Ads  Facebook introduced Facebook for Mobile in 2006. It now has nearly 1 
billion daily monthly active users as of June 2015. Users can also access Facebook 
using a mobile browser although it is slower. In 2015, over 75% of Facebook ad revenue 
will come from its mobile ad platform, and it is its fastest growing revenue stream

(eMarketer, Inc., 2015c). Mobile app install ads are those paid for by mobile app devel-
opers to persuade users to install their app.
Because the smartphone screen is much smaller than regular computer screens, 
there is no room for sidebar ads on the right-hand column, so all mobile ads need to 
be displayed in the users’ News Feed. Mobile ads can include many of the ad formats 
described above. Critics complain that the number of ads in the mobile News Feed 
becomes distracting and annoying. Mobile ads often take up the entire screen. There 
also is less targeting of mobile ads, which increases the likelihood users will see 
irrelevant ads. So far, despite the annoyance, Facebook mobile users continue to sign 
up and view. 
Facebook Exchange (FBX).  Facebook Exchange (FBX) is a real-time bidding system 
that allows advertisers to target their ads based on personal information provided by 
Facebook. FBX competes with Google’s display ad system DoubleClick and other real-
time exchanges. Visitors to third-party Web sites are marked with a cookie, and can 
then be shown ads related to their Web browsing when they return to Facebook. 
Table 7.2 summarizes the major tools used by marketers to build their brands 
on Facebook.

Starting a Facebook Marketing Campaign 
Prior to starting a Facebook marketing campaign, there are some basic strategy ques-
tions you need to address. While every product presumably could benefit from a 
social marketing campaign, how is this true of your products? Who is your audience? 
How can you reach them? How have real-world social networks been used in the 
past to support sales in your industry? Can you be a “thought leader?” Once you have 
identified your audience, what content will get them excited and interested? Where 
are you going to get the content? What will it cost and what impact do you expect it 
to have on your brand and sales? At this point you do not need a detailed budget, but 
you should be able to develop estimates of the cost of such a campaign, as well as 
anticipated revenues. 
If you’re new to Facebook marketing, start simple and build on your fan base 
based on experience. A typical marketing campaign for Facebook might include the 
following elements:
•	 Establish a Facebook page for your brand. Content is king: have interesting, original 
content that visitors can be enthusiastic about. Acquire fans. 
•	 Use comment and feedback tools to develop fan comments. You want visitors to 
engage with your content. You can also encourage bloggers to develop content for 
your page. 
•	 Develop a community of users. Try to encourage fans to talk with one another, and 
develop new (free) content for your page. 
•	 Encourage brand involvement through videos and rich media showing products 
being used by real customers.
•	 Use contests and competitions to deepen fan involvement.
•	 Develop display ads for use on Facebook.
•	 Develop display ads for use in response to social search queries.
•	 Liberally display the Like button so fans share the experience with their friends.

Measuring Facebook Marketing Results 
There are many ways to measure the success of a Facebook marketing campaign, 
some very sophisticated. This is a very new field that changes daily. Making matters 
more complicated is that industry sources sometimes use different names to refer to 
the same thing! Where this occurs we try to give both the most reasonable name and 
alternative names you might find in trade literature. 
Table 7.4 describes some of the basic metrics to use when evaluating a social 
marketing campaign. It uses the five steps of the social marketing process found in 
Figure 7.4—fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and ultimately 
brand strengthening and sales—as an organizing schema. 
While the ultimate goal of Facebook marketing is to drive sales (which typically 
will take place on your Web site), it is very important to understand what the elements 
of social marketing that produce these sales are, and how they can be improved.

S o c i a l  M a r k e t i n g 	

477
At the most elementary level, the number of fans (or followers) generated is the 
beginning of all social marketing. Visitors become fans when they like your content. 
In the early days of social marketing, firms put a great deal of emphasis on the size 
of the fan base, and collecting Likes. This is less important today, as social marketing 
managers have become more sophisticated. Fan engagement in your content and 
brand is the first step toward developing a truly social experience, and arguably is 
more important than simply the number of impressions or the number of fans. Fans 
that you never hear from are not valuable. Engagement relates to how your fans are 
interacting with your content, how intensely, and how often. Understanding the kinds 
of content (videos, text, photos, or posts from fans) that create the highest levels of 
engagement is also very important (Unmetric, 2015).
The ability to amplify your marketing message by tapping into the social network 
of your fans is also at the core of social marketing. This can be measured very simply 
as the rate at which fans recommend your content to their friends, and how many of 
their friends further recommend your content to their friends. 
Measuring the strength of a Facebook community is not that much different from 
measuring the strength of an offline community. In both cases you attempt to measure 
the collective activities of all in the community. Among your fans, how many actively 
participate? What is the total number of actions taken by fans in a month? How many 
minutes of involvement are generated each month? What is the percentage of favor-
able comments? 
Finally, measuring sales that result from social campaigns is also straightforward. 
First, measure the percentage of sales you receive from the Facebook channel. You can 
easily measure the number of visits to your Web site that originate on Facebook, and 
the sales these visits generate. In addition, you can compare purchase rates (conver-
sion rate) for fans and compare these to conversion rates for non-fans from Facebook. 
More important, you can compare the Facebook conversion rate to other visitors who 
come from different marketing channels, such as e-mail, display ads, and blogs. 
Facebook marketing has entered its second generation even though it’s only four 
years old. The emphasis today in social marketing has gone beyond collecting Likes 
and more toward building engagement with high-quality content that fans want to 
share with their friends; nurturing stable communities of intensely involved fans and 
friends of fans; and ultimately turning these communities of fans into communities 
of purchasers. 
The experience of marketers is tantalizing but still unclear. E-mail, search, and 
affiliate marketing still drive more sales than Facebook or any social marketing today 
(eMarketer, 2015; Smith, 2014). Conversion rates for social marketing are less than 1%, 
while search produces 2.2% and e-mail nearly 4%. Display ads on general Web sites 
are about as effective for producing sales as those on social network sites. Facebook 
ads are much less likely to be clicked on than display ads on the Web, and sell for 
less than half the price of Web display ads. Facebook users join social networks to be 
social, not to buy or even shop. Despite these limitations, in the space of a few years, 
Facebook has been able to create a multi-billion dollar business selling ads. Rather 
than replace other ad venues, Facebook may be creating a whole new venue that it 
dominates and that has unique value, but nevertheless does not diminish the role of 
e-mail or search in the marketing mix.

There are a variety of Facebook analytics tools that provide valuable information 
about your Facebook marketing efforts. Facebook Page Insights, provided by Facebook, 
tracks total Page Likes, People Talking About This (PTAT) (which tracks the number of 
unique people who have clicked on, Liked, commented on, or shared a post), Page Tags 
and Mentions, Page Checkins, and other interactions on a page. It also tracks some-
thing it calls Engagement Rate. People are considered to have engaged with a post if 
they Like it, comment on it, share it, or click it (Simply Measured, 2015; AdRoll, 2015). 
Social media management system HootSuite enables teams to execute marketing 
campaigns across multiple networks from one dashboard, and also provides custom 
reports. Major analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, Webtrends, and IBM Digital 
Analytics, also provide Facebook reporting modules. Read the Insight on Technology case 
study Optimizing Social Marketing with Simply Measured for a further look at how one 
organization is using analytics tools to help them better understand social marketing.
TWITTER MARKETING
Twitter is a micro-blogging social network site that allows users to send and receive 
140-character messages, as well as news articles, photos, and videos. Twitter has an 
estimated 315 million active users worldwide as of September 2015, and its 2014 
revenue was $1.4 billion, more than double its 2013 revenue. But Twitter lost $577 
million in 2014, and has never been profitable since its founding in 2006. Investors 
have pummeled its stock down 30% in 2015. Over 90% of Twitter’s users access the 
service on mobile devices. Almost all of Twitter’s revenue comes from pop-ads that 
appear in users’ timelines (tweet stream), but Twitter also has many other marketing 
tools in its quiver. The real magic of Twitter, like Facebook, is that Twitter does not 
pay for the 500 million tweets sent each day. They are supplied for free by active 
users. Twitter sells ads based on the content of these user messages. Some analysts 
believe Twitter could easily become the next Google. Twitter was designed from the 
start as a real-time text messaging service. Twitter offers advertisers and marketers a 
chance to interact and engage with their customers in real time and in a fairly intimate, 
one-on-one manner. Advertisers can buy ads that look like organic tweets (the kind you 
receive from friends), and these ads can tie into and enhance marketing events like new 
product announcements or pricing changes. Twitter is announcing new marketing tools 
every quarter in an effort to boost its revenues. On the other hand, there may be a limit 
to how many ads Twitter users will tolerate. 
Basic Twitter Features
While most people probably know what a tweet is, Twitter offers marketers many 
other ways of communicating using Twitter. In fact, Twitter has introduced a whole 
new vocabulary that is specific to Twitter’s platform. Table 7.5 on page 441 describes 
the most common Twitter features. 
Twitter Marketing Tools
There are many kinds of Twitter marketing products, and the firm is creating new ones 
every few months. The current major Twitter marketing tools include the following.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
OPTIMIZING SOCIAL MARKETING WITH SIMPLY 
MEASURED
Companies of all shapes and sizes 
are beginning to tap into the power 
of social media for marketing and 
advertising to improve their bottom 
line and enrich their relationships with their 
customers. As social media continues to become 
entrenched in the business and cultural land-
scape, an ecosystem of companies has sprung up 
around it to meet growing demand. One major 
area of growth is in social media analytics – tools 
that allow companies to track and report social 
media account performance and generate rec-
ommendations on how to optimize social media 
marketing efforts. Simply Measured is a market 
leader in this burgeoning field, rating highest in 
overall customer satisfaction as well as market 
share.
Founded in 2010, Simply Measured is based 
in Seattle, Washington, and has quickly grown 
from humble beginnings (the founders built 
the original product over a single weekend) to 
a market-leading company capable of raising 
almost $30 million in venture capital. It cur-
rently has 150 employees and more than 1,000 
customers. Its rapid growth is due in part to the 
similarly rapid growth in social media platforms 
during that time, as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 
and others have all more than doubled over that 
span. Marketers and advertisers eager to tap into 
this emerging channel may not have the tools 
to understand what techniques are working and 
which need refinement. That’s where Simply 
Measured comes in.
Simply Measured offers analytics tools for 
all major platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, 
Instagram, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, and 
Vine. It also offers variations of those products 
for individual market segments, such as retail, 
finance and insurance, consumer packaged goods, 
sports, restaurants, publishing, travel, tech, and 
telecommunications. Simply Measured’s solutions 
allow companies to plan their social strategy, 
execute it, and then find out what’s working 
best. Optimizing social marketing techniques in 
this way leads to better audience engagement 
and better bottom-line results. Simply Measured 
generates reports both in Microsoft Excel and on 
the Web in clear, easily understood formats that 
can be shared across organizations.
Examples of typical basic reports include 
Facebook Competitive Analysis, which measures 
a Facebook page against other competitors in 
usage and engagement; Traffic Source Analysis, 
which determines what sources direct the most 
traffic to your site; and Twitter Follower Analy-
sis, which analyzes an account’s followers for 
demographic information and activity trends. 
Whatever a company’s social marketing needs, 
odds are good that Simply Measured has solu-
tions to help.
For example, the Seattle Seahawks, winners 
of the 2014 Super Bowl, are renowned for their 
passionate fan base, known as “The 12th Man,” 
and for their deafening crowd noise at home 
games, which held the record for loudest ever 
recorded at an outdoor stadium until it was 
surpassed by Kansas City Chiefs fans in 2014. 
The organization hoped to create a similar atmo-
sphere on social media as well, and turned to 
Simply Measured to help it achieve this goal. 
During the team’s playoff run in 2014, Simply 
Measured helped the Seahawks increase social 
engagement across all major platforms by a 
whopping 173%.

For a team with a large, motivated 
fan base, managing and understanding that 
level of social activity is impossible without the 
assistance of analytics. Using Simply Measured’s 
Cross-Channel Social Performance report, the 
Seahawks learned which social networks best 
suited their social media goals and created 
greater fan engagement. To their surprise, Ins-
tagram was extremely effective in this regard, 
so they focused more energy there. The Twitter 
Account Report indicated which content was 
most popular on Twitter and even pointed to 
particular times of day that were most likely to 
generate a strong response. And the Twitter Com-
petitive Analysis Report allowed the Seahawks 
to measure themselves against others, including 
their opponents in the Super Bowl, the Denver 
Broncos, as well as the rest of their peers in the 
NFL, in key metrics like share of overall “voice” 
and fan engagement.
Simply Measured also offers a variety of 
reports and e-books detailing the state of social 
marketing in different market segments. The 
company identifies and analyzes trends in social 
marketing campaigns, such as the Montana 
Department of Tourism’s Montana Moment Ins-
tagram campaign, which quickly went viral as 
users shared images of Montana’s picturesque 
countryside with the hashtag #montanamo-
ment. Simply Measured also took notice of the 
campaign promoting the Breaking Bad spinoff 
television show Better Call Saul, which used an 
aggressive marketing campaign in the weeks 
leading up to the show to acquire 14,000 fol-
lowers, to better engage with the show’s fans 
during its run, and to better understand the types 
of content its followers were most interested in. 
Simply Measured is on a growth tear in 
2015. Like many start-ups, it is using the money 
it has raised from venture capital to buy up other 
firms that can strengthen its main product line, 
and enable it to branch out into related activities. 
In September 2015, Simply Measured acquired 
Inside Social, a small company with 10 employ-
ees that helps marketing firms track the return 
on investment from social marketing campaigns, 
something which has been difficult to determine, 
especially with mobile social marketing. Inside 
Social initially began life as a project at Tech-
stars’ Seattle incubator. With this acquisition, 
Simply Measured can tell its clients not only 
where to concentrate their efforts in terms of 
response, but also where they can make the best 
return on their investment of ad dollars. 
In October 2015, Simply Measured acquired 
Arkansas-based DataRank, a social intelligence 
platform that helps firms organize and sift 
through mountains of online comments, helping 
firms analyze what is being said about them. One 
of DataRank’s offerings is DataRank Sonar, a 
social media dashboard that visually, in real-time, 
illustrates how client brands are faring in online 
social conversations. 
Using social media correctly can be diffi-
cult (see the Chapter 10 Insight on Society case, 
The Dark Side of Social Networks, for examples). 
With Simply Measured and other social media 
analytics providers, avoiding these pitfalls and 
getting the most out of social media become 
much easier.

Promoted Tweets.  Advertisers pay to have their tweets appear in users’ search results. 
Promoted Tweets are Twitter’s version of Google’s AdWords. The tweets appear as “pro-
moted” in the search results. Pricing is on a “cost-per-click” basis of between $.50 to 
$2.00 per click, and based on an auction run by Twitter on the Twitter ad platform. An 
“ad carousel” allows up to 12 ads to be shown in a single space, enabling users to swipe 
through the Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets can be geo-targeted and also offer 
keyword targeting that enables advertisers to send the tweets to specific users based on 
keywords in their recent tweets or tweets with which they have interacted. Buy buttons 
embedded within Promoted Tweets enable users to purchase without leaving Twitter.
Promoted Trends.  Advertisers pay to move their hashtags (# symbol used to mark 
keywords in a tweet) to the top of Twitter’s Trends List. Otherwise, hashtags are found 
by the Twitter search engine, and only those that are organically popular make it to 
the Trends List. Promoted Trends cost about $200,000 a day in the United States in 
2014, and are also available for purchase in 50 different countries.
Promoted Accounts.  Advertisers pay to have their branded account suggested to users 
who are likely to be interested in the account in the “Who to Follow” list, Twitter’s 
account recommendation engine, on the Twitter home page. Promoted Accounts can be 
	
TABLE 7.5	
TWITTER FEATURES 
F E A T U R E 
D E S C R I P T I O N 
Tweet
140-character text message. Messages can be private (to a single person or 
one to one), public (to everyone, one to many), or to a group of followers. 
Followers 
You can follow someone’s tweets and receive them as soon as they are made. 
Others can follow your tweets. 
Message (DM)
A direct private message (DM) is like an e-mail that only you and the recipient 
can read.
Hashtag 
#<word>
Like a Twitter search engine, #<word> organizes the conversations on Twitter 
around a specific topic. Click on a hashtag and you are taken to the search 
results for that term.
Mention
A public Tweet that includes another user’s name “@username.” You can click 
on mentions and link back to that person’s profile. As a public tweet, your 
followers will be alerted as well. 
Moments tab
Curated highlights of what is happening on Twitter at that moment.
Reply
A public response to a tweet using the Reply button. Replies show up on your 
timeline and that of the person you are responding to. 
Timeline
Your timeline is your home page on Twitter listing the tweets you have received 
in chronological order, the most recent first. Click on a tweet in the timeline and 
it expands to reveal videos, and photos. Place your mouse over a tweet to reply, 
retweet, or make it a favorite (which is passed to your followers).
Retweet
Allows you to send along a tweet to all of your followers.
Links
Twitter has a link-shortening feature that allows you to paste in a URL of any 
link and it will be automatically shortened.

targeted by interest, geography, and gender, and are priced on a cost-per-follower basis, 
with advertisers paying only for new followers gained. Prices range from $.50 to $2.50.
Enhanced Profile Pages.  Companies get their own banner and the ability to pin a 
tweet to the top of the company’s timeline. The price reportedly ranges from $15,000 
to $25,000. 
Amplify.  The Twitter Amplify program provides marketers with a real-time digital 
dashboard so they can see the resulting tweet activity about the show or the brand. 
Based on this information, marketers can send Promoted Tweets to users who tweeted 
about a show. They can alter the copy as well based on other information about the 
tweeters. For example, Jim Beam used Amplify in 2013 to promote its new Jim Beam 
Red Stag brand of premium bourbon. The intent was to increase brand awareness, 
purchase intent, and user engagement. The strength of Twitter, according to Jim 
Beam marketers, is that it allows the brand to be a part of a real-time conversation, as 
opposed to Facebook, which is better at reaching a mass audience but not at engaging 
consumers in real time. The power of social media, including Facebook, is finding 
consumer advocates who will speak on behalf of the brand. 
Promoted Video.  In August 2014, building on the Amplify program, Twitter announced 
a beta test of Promoted Video, which allows advertisers to distribute video on the 
Twitter platform. In 2015, Twitter began allowing advertisers to use Promoted Video 
to link directly to app installations and also added an ad purchasing feature for videos 
called “optimized action bidding” that enables marketers to customize ad purchases 
to improve return on investment.
Television Ad Retargeting.  Millions of users tweet with their friends while watching 
television, and Twitter can follow the conversation to identify who is watching a 
particular show. Marketers displaying TV ads can retarget those ads or other messages 
to tweeters in real time to reinforce their marketing message. Advertisers with video 
content, like the National Basketball Association, insert in-tweet video clips, which are 
video replays. Advertisers can precede the video with an ad, or place an ad just below 
the video on screen. Companies can follow up with a Promoted Tweet. 
Lead Generation Cards.  Marketers can embed a “card” into business tweeters’ standard 
Twitter messages. When users click on the message, a promotional offer appears and 
users are asked to sign up. Cards are different from display ads because they are used 
only by businesses who want to develop new leads, and they always include an offer, 
such as 50% off your next cup of coffee. This is a one-click process. The users’ e-mail 
and Twitter account names are automatically obtained by Twitter and sent to market-
ers, who can then follow up with a tweet or an e-mail. 
Table 7.6 summarizes these Twitter marketing tools.
Mobile Ads  Because over 90% of Twitter users access Twitter on a mobile device, most 
of the above referenced marketing tools can be considered mobile ads tools. Mobile 
is also proving to be the primary driver of Twitter’s business and the source of most

of its revenue. In addition to all of the above formats, in April 2014, Twitter added 
mobile app install and app engagement ads, which have been lucrative formats for 
Facebook as well.
Starting a Twitter Marketing Campaign
If you’re new to Twitter marketing, start simple and build on your follower base using 
experience as a guide for what works. A typical marketing campaign for Twitter may 
include the following elements:
•	 Establish a Twitter account. Start following others you are interested in or conversa-
tions that you might want to participate with #<topic>. Don’t expect any followers 
at first. Your visibility rises as you follow others, who will begin to tweet back or 
retweet interesting content. Then start retweeting content you think the group 
would be interested in, and start encouraging ongoing conversations.

DESCRIPTION 
Promoted Tweets 
Advertisers pay to have their tweets appear in users’ search results and 
timelines. The tweets appear as “promoted,” and the pricing is on a 
per-click basis, based on an auction run on the Twitter ad platform. 
Promoted Tweets can be both keyword- and geo-targeted. An “ad 
carousel” allows up to 12 ads to be shown in a single space, enabling 
users to swipe through the Promoted Tweets. Buy buttons embedded 
within Promoted Tweets enable users to purchase without leaving Twitter.
Promoted Trends
Advertisers pay to move their hashtags (# symbol used to mark keywords 
in a tweet) to the top of Twitter’s Trends List. Otherwise, hashtags are 
found by the Twitter search engine, and only those that are organically 
popular make it to the Trends List. 
Promoted Accounts
Advertisers pay to have their branded account suggested to users likely 
to be interested in the account in the“Who to Follow” list, Twitter’s 
account recommendation engine, available on the Twitter home page. 
Promoted Accounts can be specifically targeted and are priced on a 
cost-per-follower basis.
Enhanced Profile Pages
Companies can get their own banner to display images and the ability to 
pin a tweet to the top of the company’s timeline.
Amplify
A real-time digital dashboard connecting television commercials and 
tweet activity. 
Promoted Video
Advertisers can use distribute videos on the Twitter platform and use 
Promoted Videos to link directly to app installlations.
TV Ad Retargeting

•	 Try a simple Promoted Tweet. Twitter has a very good online ad facility that will 
allow you to define an ad, establish the groups you would like to target, and under-
stand the costs. You might start with a regional or metropolitan Promoted Tweet. 
Test various formats. You don’t have to pay for Promoted Tweets unless someone 
clicks on the tweet, so it is up to you to make those clicks count. Direct users to 
your Web site and offer a coupon or discount. 
•	 Promoted Trends can be very expensive—around $200,000. If your budget will 
allow, and your topic is of general interest to a large audience, you can try this tool. 
Geo-targeting is possible. 
•	 TV ad retargeting is obviously a big business tool for media companies that have 
television content and television ads. Retargeting these to the Twitter community 
strengthens the overall brand image, and can direct people to the firm’s Web site.
•	 Lead Generation Cards are something that small and medium-sized businesses can 
use. If you sell anything locally, from pizza to stationery, make up an offer and build 
a Lead Generation Card specifying the geo-location where your business is located. 
As with Facebook, the objective is to establish your brand identity online and seek 
out engagement with users, not immediate sales. Encourage others to retweet your 
content and offers to their friends.

Measuring Twitter Marketing Results
Measuring the results of Twitter marketing is similar to measuring the results of 
Facebook and other social marketing platforms, with some minor changes to account 
for the unique qualities of Twitter. Table 7.8 describes some basic ways to measure 
the results of a Twitter marketing campaign. 
Tools provided by Twitter include a dashboard that provides real-time informa-
tion on impressions, retweets, clicks, replies, and follows for Promoted Tweets and 
Promoted Accounts. Twitter’s Timeline activity dashboard provides data on how every 
tweet performs in terms of mentions, follows, and reach. Twitter’s Followers dashboard 
enables marketers to track the growth of the follower base, as well as information about 
their interests, geography, and engagement.
Third-party tools include TweetDeck, which enables you to track mentions, 
people, and keywords; Twitalyzer, which provides one-click access to Twitter metrics 
that analyze followers, mentions, retweets, influencers, and their locations; and Back-
Tweets, which allows you to search through a tweet archive for URLs sent via Twitter.

PINTEREST MARKETING
Pinterest is the social network site that provides users with an online board to which 
they can “pin” interesting pictures. The success of Pinterest is based in part on a shift 
in consumer behavior enabled by new technologies: people talk about brands using 
pictures rather than words. Large numbers of Web users are pinning and instagram-
ming about their lives using pictures. 
You can think of Pinterest as a highly interactive and social online magazine or 
“zine.” One difference, of course, is that users (including business firms) contribute 
all the photos. The site currently has 36 categories of boards from gifts, animals, art, 
cars, and motorcycles to crafts, food, and men’s and women’s fashion. Users can pin 
to these boards, create their own boards, and follow other pinners and boards as well. 
Users have created millions of boards. Firms can create their own brand boards and 
product pins.
Users who pin photos can alert Facebook and Twitter friends and followers who 
can access their pictures and boards on Pinterest. Pinned photos and photo boards 
are available to all Pinterest users at this time, although many marketers are pushing 
Pinterest to develop private boards that can allow marketers to require registration 
(customer information) as a condition of access to content. But the point of Pinterest, 
according to its cofounder Ben Silberman, is to share beautiful, interesting photos and 
graphics as widely as possible across the Web. Everyone can repin images they like to 
their own boards as well. Pinterest is therefore one of the largest image sharing sites 
on the Internet. 
Pinterest is also one of the fastest growing sites in Web history. In 2010, Pinterest 
had 10,000 users, then 12 million by the end of 2011, and 100 million by 2015. Today, 
about 18% of online adults in the United States use Pinterest. Pinterest’s visitors are 
overwhelmingly female: over 80% are women, but users cover a broad demographic 
range from grandparents to teenagers, with the largest segment (27%) between 25 and 
34. The hope for marketers, and Pinterest, is that its “referral capacity” (the ability 
to direct users to retail Web sites where they can purchase something) will rapidly 
increase as its audience grows and intensity of use grows. 
One way to look at the millions of pictures on Pinterest is as disguised display 
ads—click, and off you go to a brand Web site for a purchase. Pinterest pins are much 
better than display ads because they are unobtrusive, and because they don’t look 
like display ads. Instead, they look like sumptuous catalog or magazine photos. In 
the future, analysts believe, Pinterest could charge an affiliate fee for any subsequent 
purchases. Pinterest could also charge businesses for creating brand sites or boards, 
which currently are free. 
Basic Pinterest Features 
Marketing on Pinterest requires that you understand the basic features and capa-
bilities of Pinterest. While all users of Pinterest understand how to pin photos to an 
online scrapbook, many other capabilities are less well understood or used. Table 7.9 
­provides a list of Pinterest features.

Pinterest Marketing Tools 
Pinterest marketing tools are still in an early stage of development. The company is 
adding new tools every month as Pinterest begins the journey towards monetizing its 
large user audience. In 2014, Pinterest, following in Facebook’s and Twitter’s footsteps, 
took the official leap into paid advertising. It launched Promoted Pins with a select 
group of national brands and also announced a trial of a Do It Yourself version of 
Promoted Pins for small and medium-sized businesses, to be paid for on a cost per 
click basis, similar to the Google AdWords platform. Promoted Pins will appear in

search results and category feeds. In 2015, Pinterest added Buyable Pins and a Shop 
Our Picks feature, allowing users to buy products directly on the Pinterest site, and 
pay with Apple Pay. The Shop our Picks feature highlights hand-picked items for users 
to consider purchasing.
Table 7.10 identifies and describes some of the primary Pinterest marketing tools.
For instance, Lands’ End has several brand pages on Pinterest, one of which is 
Lands’ End Canvas. Search for Lands’ End Canvas and it takes you to the page that 
Lands’ End Canvas created and where Lands’ End has pinned some of its catalog 
photos. On this brand page, only Lands’ End Canvas products are pinned, and the 
company is identified. You can see the number of people who have pinned these 
photos elsewhere, and the total number of others who follow this line of clothing and 
have posted their own photos. When you click on a photo, you get a larger version of 
the photo (sometimes called a photo landing page), and the chance to link to the Web 
site (canvas.landsend.com) where you can purchase the product and find similar ones. 
You will also see on this photo landing page a picture of the person who pinned the 
photo, other boards where it was pinned, and recommendations for related photos and 
products in a section titled “People who pinned this also pinned ....”

Pinterest did not distinguish between a personal page and a corporate brand page. 
URL Link to stores
Makes it easier for consumers to click through links on brand pages and product pins so they 
can reliably purchase what they see. The goal is to integrate photos of inventory with 
Pinterest to make items more easily tracked. What this means is retailers can see a definite 
link between a sale and a photo they pinned. Currently, after thousands of repins, clicking on 
the URL sometimes leads to a broken link.
Retail brand Pins (Product Pin; 
Enhanced Pin)
A new kind of pin for food, retail, and movies. Click on a Retail Pin and you will see the price 
and where to buy it. Food Pins reveal recipes. 
Integration with other social sites

Repin these photos to your brand page on Pinterest. Give a shout-out to your loyal users and 
fans to show potential customers how much current users like using your product. 
Network with users, followers, 
and others 
As with Facebook and Twitter, comment, mention, and communicate with others using 
Pinterest. Participate in the community and you will become better known, and learn more 
about potential customers and what they believe and to what they aspire.

Table 7.11 provides a brief description of Pinterest marketing campaigns of 
selected retailers. 
Starting a Pinterest Marketing Campaign
Before leaping into a Pinterest campaign, ask yourself some questions about your 
products and services, and then identify some strategic objectives for your Pinterest 
presence. First, sketch out a vision of what you hope to accomplish with a Pinterest 
presence. Are you an established brand trying to strengthen your brand? Are you the 
new kid on the block that no one knows and you want to start a marketing campaign? 
Are your products visual and can your brand be expressed in a set of pictures? Most 
products have a visual component, some more compelling than others. Today, most 
Pinterest marketing campaigns involve clothing, jewelry, home furnishings, food, and 
art/crafts. If your product is hip implants, for instance, it might be hard to portray your 
products to likely consumers (but not impossible if you are creative). Is the consumer 
accustomed to seeing the products in your industry expressed through photos? Food 
is increasingly a visual experience with the growth of food magazines and Web sites. 
Next, consider the target demographic for your products and services, and 
compare it to the Pinterest demographic. Currently, Pinterest visitors are over 80% 
women, and while this might change over time, your offerings will have to be attrac-
tive to women. Do your products or services appeal to this demographic?
Think about strategy in your marketspace. What are your competitors doing? Are 
they on Pinterest? Do they have an effective presence? What types of people follow

your competitors and what are the users pinning? How many followers, re-pinners, 
brand pages, and product pins are there? Because photos are central to a Pinterest pres-
ence, where will the photos for your brand pages come from? Are you, or a member 
of your team, a skilled photographer? You can pin photos from all over the Web, and 
from other Pinterest boards, but then you’re just sharing content, not creating unique 
and unusual content. 
Pinterest is an adjunct to a fully developed marketing plan, both online and 
offline. You will want to integrate your social and online marketing efforts with a 
Facebook and Twitter presence. You can share photos from your Web site, and send 
Web photos to your brand pages. The same photos can be used on your Facebook page 
and on Twitter. Your customers will be using all these platforms and you will have to 
follow them to keep up. 
Once you have envisioned your Pinterest campaign and developed a marketing 
plan, you can start implementing your plan. In order to implement your Pinterest 
plan, you should have a traditional Web site where your products are displayed (a 
catalog) and can be purchased. Second, you should also have a Facebook brand page 
to develop followers and a method for informing your followers of new Pins. Once 
these are in place, you can begin your Pinterest campaign:
•	 Create a Pinterest brand page and start pinning photos of your products. Grow, and 
change your pins and board regularly. Be sure your photos are the same quality 
level or higher than those of your competitors. If necessary, hire a skilled pho-
tographer. Brand pages generally do not allow followers to pin photos but only to 
follow and comment. The idea here is to control the content of your brand page, 
and develop other boards where followers can pin pictures. 
•	 Improve the quality of your photos. Computer screens limit the resolution that 
can be displayed to users, but the lighting, composition, and color in your pinned 
photos are under your control.
•	 Use URL links and keywords. Make sure your pins have a URL link to your store, 
or to vendor stores, so followers can easily buy as well as “see.” Be sure to use 
keywords and hashtags to classify each of your photos so they show up in Pinterest 
searches. Remember, Pinterest cannot “see” a photo or understand its content. It 
only “knows” the content based on your tags. 
•	 Create a Pinterest product pin. If you are in the food, retail, or movie distribution 
business, product pins are worth a try if you have a popular product at an attractive 
price, or if you want to use a specific product as a loss-leader to motivate people 
to come to your Web site (where you can expose them to your entire catalog of 
products). 
•	 Use Pin It buttons. Add a Pin It button to your Web site and Facebook page to 
encourage fans and followers to pin your photos to their own boards, and to recom-
mend them to friends. 
•	 Create multiple theme-based life style boards. Develop several theme-based boards 
that emphasize life styles or fashions. Pinterest is not just, or even primarily, a 
selling site. It is also an entertainment and branding site. You want followers to 

	
S o c i a l  M a r k e t i n g 	


adore your photos. On theme-based boards you will want others besides yourself 
to be able to pin. 
•	 Use your Facebook and Twitter networks. Start using your Facebook and Twitter 
networks by adding a Pin It button to Facebook (also called a Pinterest tab), and 
start sharing your pinned photos with your followers.
•	 Integrate with Facebook and Twitter. Create Facebook and Twitter logins so that 
users can go to your pins and boards without leaving the Facebook and Twitter sites. 
•	 Be social. Join the conversation. It’s all about being social. Follow other pinners 
and boards and ask to receive e-mail and Facebook updates.
Measuring Pinterest Marketing Results 
Because Pinterest is just beginning to introduce and test its marketing tools, learning 
how to measure the results of a Pinterest marketing campaign is also in the early 
stages. Nevertheless, like any social marketing platform, the key dimensions to 
measure are fan (follower) acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and 
sales. Table 7.12 describes some basic ways to measure the results of a Pinterest 
marketing campaign.
Pinterest provides a built-in Web Analytics service that offers insights into how 
people are interacting with pins that originate from their Web sites. There are several

firms that will help produce the metrics referred to in Table 7.12. For instance, Curalate 
is an online service to measure the impact of Pinterest and other visual social media. 
It listens and measures visual conversations by seeing what pictures users pin and 
repin, and also analyzes the colors in the picture. Curalate currently has over 450 
brands using its platform.
MARKETING ON OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS
There are a great many social networks where products and services can be marketed, 
the largest of which include Instagram and LinkedIn. Instagram is a visual social 
network: users and advertisers post photos and videos to their friends, potential cus-
tomers, and the public at large. Instagram (owned by Facebook) has 400 million users 
worldwide, 77 million of whom are in the United States. Instagram is one of the fastest 
growing social networks, growing at 20% annually in 2015, compared to only 3% for 
Facebook. However, its growth is predicted to slow down considerably in the next 
four years. Instagram is very popular with Millennials (18- to 34-year-olds). In 2015, 
analysts estimate Instagram will generate almost €540 million in worldwide mobile 
ad revenues, increasing to €2.55 billion by 2017 (eMarketer, Inc., 2015d). 
As with other social networks, users create a profile. There is a Feed that provides 
a listing of photos and videos (up to 15 seconds long) posted by friends or advertisers. 
Using a feature called Direct, users can send photos and videos to specific people. 
Using Explore, users can search for public profiles and photos. Instagram also has a 
powerful photo editing suite called Layout. 
Similar to Facebook, advertisers have brand profiles and run marketing campaigns 
by sending posts to users’ Feeds. Instagram ad campaigns consist of display ads and 
video ads of exceptional quality, similar to a printed magazine. Ads can link to adver-
tiser’s Web sites and now can include a Buy button. For brands that want to drive 
mass awareness around premieres, product launches, and key moments, Instagram 
developed what it calls its Marquee ad product, which reaches millions of people. 
Marquee ads generally last a single day, promise to deliver a guaranteed number of 
impressions, and can be posted several times during the day to catch different audi-
ences (eMarketer, Inc., 2015e).
LinkedIn, while generating far less average engagement, nevertheless attracts a 
highly educated, professional, and managerial audience that is intensively engaged 
in careers and employment. LinkedIn is a social network focused on professional 
networking, where users post their resumes, and potential employers hunt for new 
hires. See the opening case in Chapter 10 for more information on LinkedIn. LinkedIn 
makes money by charging corporations for corporate brand pages, job ads, and access 
to its database of users. Users also pay for premium subscriptions called Talent (for 
employers) and JobSeeker (for individuals). In 2014, LinkedIn generated $2.2 billion 
in revenue, a 46% leap from 2013 (LinkedIn, 2015).
As with other social networks, users build a profile, but in this case, sharing their 
professional background, degrees, employment, and skill set. There is a Feed that 
provides a listing of posts from colleagues and friends, and display ad posts from 
firms. Display ads are on the right. Users can post updates, send News Signals to learn 
about contacts that are currently actively using the site, place tags on connections, 

	
M o b i l e  M a r k e t i n g  	 
493
use the Get Introduced feature to arrange an introduction to a friend of friend, post 
recommendations, and join groups relevant to their interests. 
The primary contribution of LinkedIn is to develop personal brands for profes-
sional managers, and to create a marketplace where employers can contact suitable 
candidates. This is not a site to sell products and services, at least not openly. Adver-
tisers tend to place branding ads in the left margins of the home pages, and are not 
soliciting sales. 
THE DOWNSIDE OF SOCIAL MARKETING
Social marketing is not without its disadvantages. One problem is that brands lose a 
substantial amount of control over where their ads appear in terms of other content 
and what people say about their brands on social sites. Ads placed on Facebook accord-
ing to an algorithm can be placed near content that does not represent the values 
of the brand. This is not peculiar to social marketing, as advertising using Google’s 
advertising platform faces the same problem. This is very different, however, from 
TV ads where brands maintain near complete control. Social sites are unique in that 
disgruntled consumers, or just malicious people, can post material that is inaccurate 
and/or embarrassing (Vega and Kaufman, 2013).
The Insight on Society case, Marketing to Children of the Web in the Age of Social 
Networks, illustrates some additional issues with respect to social marketing.
 	7.3	
MOBILE MARKETING 
Although still in an early stage, mobile marketing involves the use of mobile devices 
such as smartphones and tablet computers to display banner ads, rich media, video, 
games, e-mail, text messaging, in-store messaging, QuickResponse (QR) codes, and 
couponing. Mobile is now a required part of the standard marketing budget. Mobile 
devices represent a radical departure from previous marketing technologies simply 
because the devices integrate so many human and consumer activities from telephon-
ing or texting friends, to listening to music, watching videos, tracking location, and 
shopping. The more mobile devices can do, the more people rely on them in daily 
life. More than 4.4 billion people worldwide are now using mobile phones, while 1.8 
billion of these use smartphones. Around 1 billion people worldwide also use tablet 
computers (eMarketer, Inc., 2015f, 2015g). One report found that people look at their 
mobile devices at least 40 times a day. Most mobile phone users keep their phone 
within arm’s length 24 hours a day. For many, it’s the first thing they check in the 
morning, the last thing they check at night, and the first tool to use when there’s a 
question of where to go, what to do, and where to meet up. 
OVERVIEW: M-COMMERCE TODAY
It’s a short number of steps from owning a smartphone or tablet to searching for products 
and services, browsing, and then purchasing. The rate of growth of retail m-commerce in 
the United Kingdom is growing at 30% annually and is expected to keep increasing that

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
MARKETING TO CHILDREN OF THE WEB IN THE 
AGE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS 
In the United States, children influ-
ence over $1 trillion in overall family 
spending. Not surprisingly, marketers 
are extremely interested in advertising 
aimed at children.
Today, 93% of all 5- to 15-year-olds in the 
United States use the Internet. Social and mobile 
marketing provides advertisers with an entirely 
new arsenal to influence children. Using custom 
banner ads, product characters, videos, games, 
virtual worlds, and surveys, marketers are both 
influencing behaviors and gathering valuable data. 
A children’s digital culture has been created with 
built-in avenues to the psyche of young minds—
in some cases, minds that are so young they are 
unlikely to know when they are being marketed to 
and when they are being given misleading or even 
harmful information.
Marketers have moved aggressively to use 
social networks and viral marketing to get kids 
hooked on brands early in life. For instance, Red 
Bull does little TV advertising and instead uses 
online contests, games, and apps.
While such moves may be savvy marketing, 
are they ethical? Some people say no. Research 
has shown that young children cannot understand 
the potential effects of revealing their personal 
information; neither can they distinguish between 
substantive material on Web sites and the adver-
tisements surrounding it. Experts argue that since 
children don’t understand persuasive intent until 
they are eight or nine years old, it is unethical 
to advertise to them before they can distinguish 
between advertising and the real world. Others 
believe that fair advertising is an important and 
necessary part of the maturation process for 
future adults in today’s society. 
In 1998, the U.S. Congress passed the Chil-
dren’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) dis-
covered that 80% of Web sites were collecting 
personal information from children, but only 1% 
required their parents’ permission. Under COPPA, 
companies must post a privacy policy on their Web 
sites, detailing exactly how they collect informa-
tion from consumers, how they’ll use it, and the 
degrees to which they’ll protect consumer privacy. 
Companies are not permitted to use personal infor-
mation collected from children under 13 years of 
age without the prior, verifiable consent of parents.
Since the law took effect, the FTC has 
obtained a number of settlements and fined a 
number of companies for violations of COPPA. For 
instance, Disney’s Playdom was fined $3 million, 
the largest penalty to date, for collecting and dis-
closing children’s information without parental 
approval. 
In 2011, the FTC announced its first-ever 
COPPA enforcement action involving mobile apps. 
W3 Innovations was fined $50,000 for collecting 
personal information such as e-mail addresses 
from children in connection with numerous apps. 
Shortly thereafter, in response to the increase in 
the use of mobile devices by children, the FTC 
announced revisions to its COPPA regulations in 
an attempt to keep pace with emerging technol-
ogy, which finally took effect in July 2013. The 
revisions expanded the definition of personal 
information to include a child’s location, along 
with any personal data collected through the use 
of cookies for the purpose of targeted advertising, 
and require that Web sites that collect a child’s 
information ensure that they can protect it, hold 
on to it for only as long as reasonably necessary, 

	
M o b i l e  M a r k e t i n g  	 

and thereafter delete the information. If firms 
want to use the personal information of children 
for internal uses only, the FTC requires an e-mail 
from the parent plus one other form of verification 
(such as a credit card or phone number). Firms 
seeking to sell personal information about chil-
dren are also required to use an additional means 
of verification, such as a print-and-send consent 
form, credit card transaction, a toll-free number 
or video conference staffed by trained personnel, 
or verification of a parent’s identity by checking a 
form of government-issued identification. Privacy 
groups applauded the effort, but whether the new 
regulations have affected the way companies do 
business is not yet clear, and enforcement is likely 
to continue to be an issue. For example, in 2014, 
the FTC fined Snapchat for COPPA violations. 
Snapchat had falsely claimed that its messages 
were deleted forever after they were sent and also 
collected users’ contact information without their 
consent, despite the fact that many of its users 
were younger than 12 years old. In addition to the 
fine, Snapchat was required to implement a com-
prehensive privacy program and will be monitored 
for 20 years.
Major technology companies have also 
recently been fined and required to adjust their 
policies with regard to children signing up for 
their services. Google settled with the FTC in 
2014 and agreed to refund $19 million worth 
of in-app purchases that were made unwittingly 
by children. Apple had also agreed to refund 
$32.5 million in similar purchases earlier in the 
year, and Amazon is likely to follow suit 
shortly despite its claim that parents are to 
blame for these purchases. Yelp was hit with 
a $450,000 fine despite not having much vested 
interest in collecting children’s information, and 
even game developers like TinyCo have fallen into 
the FTC crosshairs, incurring a $300,000 fine 
for violating children’s privacy. The question is 
whether these FTC fines will be enough to dis-
courage companies from gathering valuable data 
on future consumers from such a young age. Yelp 
and TinyCo released statements suggesting their 
products were now fully COPPA-compliant, but 
the giants might not budge so easily. In 2015, 
Google released YouTube Kids, a child-friendly 
version of YouTube, but consumer advocates 
found that it still included inappropriate adver-
tising and explicit content.
In 2015, the Senate launched a bipartisan 
effort to enact amendments to COPPA, which 
would include children aged 13 to 15 as well 
as the requirement of an “eraser button” that 
allows parents or children to permanently erase 
personal information online for any site collect-
ing information. However, thus far, the bill has not 
been passed. The FTC has also toughened its poli-
cies toward information gathering, forcing soft-
ware and app makers to reconsider the inclusion 
of features that allow for data transfer between 
devices. App developers will also be required to 
verify parental consent using a credit or debit 
card number whether or not the app offers items 
for purchase.

level of growth through 2019. Analysts estimate that by 2019, retail m-commerce in the 
United Kingdom will account for almost half of all e-commerce in the retail industry. 
Figure 7.5 illustrates the expected growth of mobile and non-mobile commerce in 
the U.K retail industries to 2019. 
Initially, m-commerce was focused primarily on digital goods, such as music, 
videos, games, and e-books. Today, however, traditional retail products and travel 
services are the source of much of the growth in m-commerce. Figure 7.6 lists the 
top U.S. companies in terms of mobile retail sales in 2014. Not surprisingly, the giant 
is Amazon, with an expected $16.8 billion in sales through its mobile Web site and 
Amazon app. Note that the chart does not include eBay, which facilitated $34 billion 
in m-commerce transactions, nor Apple or Google Play, where most purchases are 
for digital content.
Increasingly, consumers are using their mobile devices to search for people, 
places, and things—like restaurants and deals on products they saw in a retail store. 
The rapid switch of consumers from desktop platforms to mobile devices is driving a 
surge in mobile marketing expenditures. Because search is so important for directing 
consumers to purchase situations, the mobile search advertising market is very impor-
tant for search engines like Google and Bing. Desktop search revenues are slowing for 
both. Google’s mobile ad business is growing rapidly, but the prices it can charge for 
mobile ads are far less than for desktop computer ads. The challenge facing Google

and other mobile marketing firms is how to get more consumers to click on mobile 
ads, and how to charge marketers more for each click. And the answer lies with the 
consumer who decides what and when to click. 
How People Actually Use Mobile Devices
If you plan a mobile marketing campaign, it’s important to understand how people 
actually use their mobile devices (which may be different from what you do or think 
others do). For instance, most of us think people use their mobile devices on the 
go, but in fact, according to one of the very few studies of actual mobile behavior, 
almost 70% of all mobile minutes actually occur in the home. We know Americans 
spend 5.5 hours with digital media on average daily, and nearly three of these hours 
is spent using mobile devices—smartphones and tablets (eMarketer, Inc., 2015x) 
What are they doing in these three hours, and on what device? 
Recent data show that entertainment, not shopping or buying, is the primary focus 
(at least in terms of time) for mobile device users. Of the three hours (180 minutes) 
a day that Americans are spending using their mobile devices, 27 minutes (15%) is 
spent on social networks. Smartphones are more popular for this social activity (18 
minutes) versus tablets (9 minutes). Watching video accounts for 26 minutes (14%), of 
which 14 minutes is spent on tablets versus 12 minutes on smartphones. A whopping 
44 minutes (24%) is spent listening to music, primarily streaming music services. We 
have to assume this is mostly on smartphones. Hence, nearly 40% of mobile device 
use is for entertainment (music and video), with social networks consuming another 
15% (eMarketer, Inc., 2015x). Where else does the time go? A recent survey by Pew

Research Center described the broad range of activities that mobile users accomplish 
on their mobile devices when they are not entertaining themselves or socializing. 
People use the mobile devices for pretty much the same activities as they do their 
desktop computers, from getting information, to banking, and looking for places to live. 
Unfortunately, this survey did not include data on shopping and purchasing behavior, 
and did not include information on time spent with the activity. 
However, a recent National Federation of Retailers survey provides insight into 
how consumers intend to use their mobile devices and which ones—tablet or smart-
phone—in the 2015 holiday shopping season (Figure 7.7). Researching products and 
comparing prices tops the list, with tablets (47%) leading smartphones (37%) as a 
vehicle for purchase. However, a very large percentage (35%–40%) do not plan to use 
either a tablet or a smartphone for shopping or buying at all. Only around one-third 
of tablet users and less than 25% of smartphone users plan to purchase anything with 
their tablets or smartphones. 
From this research, we can conclude that, at least in 2015, mobile devices are still 
primarily used for entertainment, socializing, and communicating, and far less time 
is spent using them for shopping or buying. None of these patterns are permanent, 
however, and as mobile payment systems and smartphone screen resolution improves, 
they may become better shopping and buying platforms. The mobile platform has 
changed over the past few years, and now there are almost as many tablet users as

smartphone users in the United Kingdom: 33 million use tablets, over 50% of the entire 
population. Tablets, with their larger screens, are the fastest growing and largest source 
of m-commerce revenues (Figure 7.8).
In-App Experiences and In-App Ads
You may think that using a browser to access the Web on your smartphone is a typical 
mobile activity. In reality, however, mobile users in the U.S. spend over 71% of their 
smartphone time using apps and 44% of their total digital time is spent using apps. On 
average, users use only about 26 apps a month. Over 80% of all app time is spent on a 
user’s top three apps (comScore, 2015c). There may be millions of apps on the iOS and 
Android cloud servers, but just a handful are actually generating sufficient user traffic 
to be of interest to general advertisers. More than 50% of users’ time is spent on social 
networks (29%), radio (15%), and games (11%). Facebook (and its related properties 
like Messenger) is the top app both in audience size and share of time spent. Other top 
25 apps in terms of unique visitors include those from Google (YouTube, Google Play, 
Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, and Google+), Instagram, Apple Music, Pandora 
Radio, Yahoo (Stocks, Weather, and Mail), Twitter, Netflix, Snapchat, and Pinterest. Only 
two retail-oriented apps are in the top 25: Amazon Mobile and eBay (comScore, 2015c). 
The implications for marketers are quite clear: if consumers are primarily using 
apps rather than browsing the Web on their mobile devices, marketers need to place

ads in apps where most of the action is for attracting consumers, and that means social, 
entertainment, and game sites. Second, if mobile consumers only use, on average, 
26 apps, then marketers need to concentrate their marketing in these popular apps, 
let’s say, the top 100. Niche marketers, on the other hand, can concentrate their ads 
in apps that support that niche. A distributor of diving equipment, for instance, could 
place ads in apps devoted to the diving community. There may not be many users of 
the app, but those who do use it are highly motivated on the topic. 
Another implication for marketers is that rather than focus on mobile display 
ads that are difficult to read, the best ad may be an app that directly serves customer 
interest or an ad in an app that is precisely targeted to the consumer’s current activities 
and interests. For instance, ads in newsfeeds, or pre-roll ads prior to music or video, 
will do much better than display ads placed elsewhere.
How the Multi-Screen Environment Changes the Marketing Funnel
Along with the growth of smartphones and tablets comes a multi-screen world: smart-
phones, tablets, desktops, and television. The reality, and the future, of computing 
devices is that consumers will be multi-platform: using desktops and laptops at work 
and home, and smartphones and tablets at home as well as when moving about. 
Television will be available all the time, both at home and on the go via tablets and 
smartphones. Consumer purchasing behavior changes in a multi-screen world. Con-
sumers will often be using two or more screens at once, tweeting when watching a TV 
show, or moving seamlessly from a TV ad, to a mobile search for more information, to 
a later tablet purchase screen. Several research studies have found that 90% of multi-
device users switch among screens to complete tasks, for instance, viewing an ad on 
TV, searching on a smartphone for the product, and then purchasing it with a tablet. 
Consumers move seamlessly among devices, either sequentially or simultaneously. 
Also, the more screens people use, the more shopping and purchasing they do. One 
conclusion is that the more screens consumers have, the more consumer touchpoints 
or marketing opportunities exist (Google, Inc., 2012). 
The implications of the multi-device platform, or screen diversity environment, 
are that marketing needs to be designed for whatever device the consumer is using, 
and consistent branding across platforms will be important. Screen diversity means 
that one ad size, for instance, will not fit all situations, and that branding images will 
need to be adjusted automatically based on the device the consumer is using. From 
a design perspective, graphics and creative elements will appear differently depend-
ing on the screen. This is called responsive design or responsive creative design. 
Responsive design is a Web design process that allows your marketing content to 
resize, reformat, and reorganize itself so that it looks good on any screen. You can see 
responsive design in action if you look at any portal on a desktop, and then compare 
the screen to that same portal viewed on a smartphone or tablet. You are likely to 
find there are three versions of the screen, one for each platform (IAB, 2012). The 
requirement to find customers on multiple screens can add considerably to the cost 
of marketing online. Companies may find that they need to develop a presence and 
market not only on Web sites, but on mobile Web sites, and/or smartphone apps as

well. Perhaps they may not be able to afford all three, and may want to choose only 
one. In that case, which is the best? Much depends on what the point of the marketing 
is. To drive sales, a Web site might be more effective, but to drive brand awareness, 
and engagement, social and entertainment apps might be better (eMarketer, 2015j).
But even beyond screen adaptability, a multi-screen world means merchants need 
to be on all platforms, and to be integrated across platforms, in order to send a coherent 
message and to create a convenient consumer platform. The marketing environment 
today is much more complex than placing banner ads on pages or on search engine 
results pages on the Web. 
BASIC MOBILE MARKETING FEATURES 
As millions of consumers adopt mobile devices, mobile marketing expenditures 
have rapidly grown and in the next five years will equal marketing on desktop PCs. 
Figure 7.9 illustrates how rapidly mobile marketing expenditures are growing in the 
U.K., while marketing on desktops is slowing and will eventually decline somewhat. 
In 2015, mobile marketing will be about 40% of all online marketing in the United 
Kingdom, which is extraordinary given that smartphones appeared only eight years 
ago, in 2007, and tablets not until 2010. Analysts believe that if current mobile market-
ing growth rates continue, by 2019, mobile marketing will be over twice as large as 
desktop advertising in the United Kingdom.

Mobile advertising is dominated by Google, with an expected $10 billion in 
mobile ad revenues, constituting about 33% of the entire market, down from 40% 
the previous year as Facebook and others continue to expand into the mobile market 
(Figure 7.10).On the mobile platform, Google is still the king of search, garnering 
almost $8.5 billion in mobile search ad revenues in 2015. Google is also the largest 
distributor of video ads on the mobile platform because of YouTube, and is expected 
to earn about $2.2 billion in video ad revenues in 2015. Facebook is second in mobile 
ads with $5.9 billion, about 20% of total mobile ad revenues, of which over 95% 
($5.6 billion) is generated by mobile display ads. Facebook is the leading display 
ad site on mobile devices, accounting for more than 40% of all spending on mobile 
display ads. 
Other players in the mobile marketing marketplace are Twitter (with a 4% share), 
Yahoo (3%), and Apple (iAd), with 3% (see Figure 7.10). 
The Technology: Basic Mobile Device Features
Everybody knows the capabilities of smartphones and tablets. But what is it about 
mobile platforms that make them any different from desktops? Are there any features 
that make them especially suitable for marketing? Table 7.13 describes these basic 
features.
Smartphones today play a much more central role in the personal life of consum-
ers than desktops and laptops in large part because smartphones are always physically 
with us, or close by. In this sense, they are more personal, and almost “wearable.” 
The “always on, always with us” nature of smartphones has several implications for 
	 FIGURE 7.10

Mobile advertising is dominated by Google and its search engine, but Facebook has gained market share in

marketers. Because they are perceived as “personal appendages,” consumers are less 
tolerant of commercial intrusion. Have you ever had a telephone conversation inter-
rupted by an advertisement? You probably have not, and if so, you most likely would 
be annoyed at the interference with a personal conversation. These attitudes extend 
to any use of the phone or tablet, from reading e-mail, visiting Facebook, or watching 
a video. Consumers are simply less tolerant of advertising on the small screens of 
smartphones. Second, the around-the-clock physical proximity of smartphones to our 
persons greatly expands the time available for marketing materials and increases the 
supply of screens for marketing materials. This excess supply decreases the price 
of mobile marketing messages. In turn, there is a tension between marketers and 
consumers: marketers want to increase the number of mobile ads, while consumers 
want to see fewer ads, not more, on their mobile devices. Ads inside apps are treated 
differently by consumers: in return for a free game, consumers are more accepting 
of ads. 
But perhaps the most unique feature of smartphones is that they know users’ 
precise location by virtue of their built-in GPS. This allows marketing messages to be 
targeted to consumers on the basis of their location, and supports the introduction of 
location-based marketing and local marketing (described in Section 7.4). While Web 
sites may know a desktop’s general location, it is a very imprecise fix, and the position 
of the desktop does not change as the user moves about. 
MOBILE MARKETING TOOLS: AD FORMATS 
Unlike social marketing, mobile marketing does not require much of a new marketing 
vocabulary. All the marketing formats available on the desktop are also available on 
mobile devices. With few exceptions, mobile marketing is very much like desktop 
marketing—except it is smaller. The major marketing opportunities in mobile market-
ing are search ads, display ads, videos and rich media, messaging (SMS/MMS/PPS),

and some familiar other formats like e-mail, classified, and lead generation. Figure 
7.11 illustrates the relative size of U.S. mobile marketing expenditures by format. 
The marketing formats on mobile devices are search ads, display, video, text/video 
messaging, and other (including e-mail, classifieds, and lead generation). 
In 2015, search engine advertising is estimated to be the most popular mobile mar-
keting format, accounting for over 45% of all mobile ad spending, not surprising given 
that search is the second most common smartphone application (after voice and text 
communication). Search engine ads can be further optimized for the mobile platform 
by showing ads based on the physical location of the user. Display ads (banner ads, 
rich media, and sponsorships) are the second leading ad format, accounting for about 
42% of mobile ad spending. Display ads can be served as a part of a mobile Web site 
or inside apps and games. Ad networks such as Google’s AdMob, Facebook, Apple’s 
iAd, Twitter’s MoPub, and MillennialMedia are some of the largest providers of mobile 
display advertising. Video ads are only about 9% of mobile marketing, but are a fast 
growing segment because of their very high click rates. Most desktop video ads can be 
resized for use on mobile phones and tablets. Mobile messaging generally involves SMS 
text messaging to consumers, with coupons or flash marketing messages. Messaging 
is especially effective for local advertising because consumers can be sent messages 
and coupons as they pass by or visit locations (see Section 7.4). 
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest have generally brought 
their desktop advertising techniques over to the mobile platform, with some alterations 
of the interface for use on small-screen smartphones. In the process, social networks 
have brought real innovation to the mobile marketing experience, including News Feed

posts on Facebook and Promoted Tweets in Twitter. Table 7.14 provides selected exam-
ples of mobile marketing campaigns and techniques used by several well-known firms. 
Mobile marketing is uniquely suited for branding purposes, raising awareness 
through the use of video and rich interactive media such as games. Read the Insight 
on Business case, Mobile Marketing: Ford Goes 3-D, for a further look.
STARTING A MOBILE MARKETING CAMPAIGN
As with all marketing campaigns, start by identifying your objectives and understand-
ing just how a mobile marketing campaign might help your firm. Are you a new 
unknown start-up seeking to develop a brand image, or an already existing brand 
looking to strengthen your presence and sell products? Is there something about your 
products that makes them especially attractive to a mobile audience? For instance, if 
you sell to local customers walking by your shop, then you might want to use the GPS 
capabilities of smartphones to target consumers who are nearby. 
Next, consider the target demographic for your campaign and products. The most 
active purchasers on mobile devices are men, and they are more likely to buy con-
sumer electronics equipment and digital content. Women are more likely to cash in 
coupons and respond to flash sales and deals. Younger consumers are more likely 
to research products and price on mobile devices, and more likely to share experi-
ences using social media. Mobile shoppers and buyers are more affluent than the 
online population in general. These demographics are averages, and mobile marketing 
campaigns do not need to restrict themselves to these averages. Find out where your 
mobile customers are congregating. Are your mobile customers likely to be using apps, 
and if so, what are they? Are your customers likely to be on Facebook or use Twitter? 
Or are your customers most likely to find you on a Google mobile search page? 
Finally, consider the marketspace where you hope to succeed. What are your com-
petitors doing on the mobile platform? Is their presence effective? Where do they place 
their marketing efforts: display ads on Web portals, or display ads in Google search

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
MOBILE MARKETING: FORD GOES 3-D
Why is mobile marketing any dif-
ferent from ordinary online market-
ing? In one sense, it isn’t. The same 
kinds of ad formats you find on Web 
sites are also used on smartphones—in 
order of importance, search, display, video, 
and text messages. In another sense, mobile 
marketing can be very different from other 
types of online marketing because of the unique 
features of the smartphone, which include a 
built-in GPS, a gyroscope, and an accelerometer. 
This means marketers can know the location of 
the user, and they can present rich media and 
video ads where the user can control the action 
in a way not possible with an ordinary desktop 
computer. Smartphones use a touch interface, 
which increases user involvement. Mobile ads 
can therefore be more engaging and interactive 
than traditional desktop computer ads. Location 
information can be used to market local busi-
nesses at the very point of consumer purchase, 
namely, on the street or in the store while brows-
ing. Other unique smartphone features are that 
people almost always carry them and keep them 
turned on while moving about. This means that 
smartphone users can be exposed to marketing 
messages throughout the day (and sometimes the 
night). 
Mobile devices are used by consumers 
throughout the purchase cycle: Nearly half of 
the population uses a mobile device to research 
products online before purchasing. The use of 
mobile devices to actually purchase products or 
services online (as opposed to just shopping and 
browsing online) is growing. For certain goods 
that the consumer is familiar with, for sites that 
have an easy-to-use one-click shopping capabil-
ity, and for purchases of content like books and 
movies, mobile purchasing is particularly con-
venient. Also, for local marketing, mobile is an 
ideal platform for merchants to attract consum-
ers in the neighborhood. Restaurants, museums, 
and entertainment venues are ideal candidates to 
use mobile marketing aimed at local consumers. 
What attracts users to mobile purchasing is the 
ability to access product information now, find 
deals, and buy all with the swipe of a finger. But 
mobile is also good for introducing new products 
and building brand recognition, with sales taking 
place elsewhere and offline.
One increasingly popular method of mobile 
advertising among companies with big advertis-
ing budgets is 3-D advertising, which consists of 
advertisements with video and other interactive 
features that take advantage of the capabilities 
of modern mobile devices. A good example of 
this type of advertising in action is Ford’s “We 
Own Work” campaign for its F-150 pickup truck, 
America’s top selling truck for 36 years. Ford 
used a 3-D mobile advertisement for the 2014 
edition of the truck as the centerpiece and “lead 
creative unit” in the campaign, with the stated 
goals that the ad be innovative, creative, and 
compatible with all major platforms and devices. 
They hoped to simulate a showroom experience 
within the ad, building brand awareness and user 
engagement in the process.
Ford’s advertising team partnered with 
Amobee, a three-dimensional mobile advertis-
ing platform, to create the virtual showroom 
experience. The ad displays as a motion-sensitive 
banner ad that expands across the screen into a 
full 3-D virtual showroom, complete with fully 
customizable options for the displayed F-150, 
embedded videos, and a 360-degree view of the 
vehicle. Users can change the truck to one of 

	
M o b i l e  M a r k e t i n g  	 
507
fourteen colors with a quick tap of the screen, 
and can view the F-150 in different environments 
at any angle by moving their device. The environ-
ments are intended to show the F-150 in action 
performing a wide array of functions, including 
construction, hauling, farming, and transport-
ing hazardous materials. Users can also tap 
the screen to load the bed of the virtual F-150, 
showcasing its payload capacity. By tilting the 
mobile device in any direction, users can generate 
reflections of each environment in the mirrors 
and windows of the truck via the accelerometer 
of the device. 
Unlike traditional rich media ads, 3-D 
mobile ads respond to users’ actions in real time, 
changing colors, lighting, shading, and other fea-
tures. But the 3-D ad format offered by Amobee 
is actually a more light-weight and user-friendly 
package than traditional HTML5 rich media ads. 
Amobee advertisements use WebGL to render 
interactive 3-D graphics, which allow each ad to 
run on traditional Web browsers as well as an 
extensive array of mobile devices.
Amobee also touts that its advertising 
platform can identify and target individual 
demographics at scale. Amobee can keep track 
of engagement with its advertisements in real 
time, keeping consumers anonymous but mea-
suring how much time different demographics 
of users spend with individual elements of each 
ad and how effectively ads engage each type of 
user. Amobee has an in-house data management 
platform with over a million profiles with cus-
tomer information such as gender, age, location, 
and interests. Needless to say, this capability is 
extremely useful when measuring the effective-
ness of an advertising campaign, and when a 
brand like Ford is seeking to target specific types 
of consumers.
Ford rolled out the ad in conjunction 
with the launch of the F-150. Using Amobee 
analytics, Ford determined that the F-150 
3-D ad registered 20 million impressions and 
595,000 expansions. The 2.9% rate of expan-
sions was 4.6 times the industry average, and 
the 13% overall engagement rate was twice as 
high as the industry average. Metrics also indi-
cated that the 3-D mobile campaign generated 
an increase in brand favorability by 19.9%, an 
increase in purchase consideration by 40.4%, 
and an increase in brand awareness of the F-150 
and Ford by 11.4%. The ad generated a 71.1% 
association by consumers of the “We Own Work” 
slogan with Ford.
Amobee requires a minimum investment 
of $250,000 for a month-long 3-D advertising 
campaign, so currently this style of ad is avail-
able mostly to bigger brands. Retail brands with 
physical products are great fits for 3-D ads, but 
companies offering services such as financial 
institutions may never be interested in 3-D ads. 
And while these ads currently offer impressive 
engagement rates, when their novelty wears 
of and they become more commonplace, those 
numbers may come back to earth a bit. Still, 
the trend toward 3-D advertising is undeniable. 
Facebook users could see similar posts from 
brands as a result of its $2 billion purchase of 
VR app developer Oculus Rift, and Ford was so 
encouraged by its F-150 campaign that they ran 
a similar one for the 2015 Mustang. With 3-D 
advertising, consumers can explore products 
in greater detail than ever before, at their own 
pace and with an emphasis on interactivity and 
fun. It could be closer than ever to a marketer’s 
holy grail: advertising that doesn’t feel like 
advertising.

results? Or can they be found as in-app ads? What apps are they advertising in? How 
are they represented on Facebook Mobile? Do they also have a Twitter and/or Pinterest 
brand page? Do your competitors have an app that users can easily download? You’ll 
want to be able to meet your competitors on each of the platforms they have adopted. 
Once you’ve developed an initial vision for your marketing campaign, you can develop 
a timeline and an action plan of how to meet the milestones identified in your timeline. 
Once you have envisioned your marketing campaign and identified your market, 
it is time to start implementing your mobile campaign. Here are some steps to follow:
•	 Develop a mobile Web site so mobile consumers can see and buy your products. 
Make your mobile Web site social by including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and 
other social site links. 
•	 Develop a Facebook brand page so your social and mobile marketing efforts are 
integrated.
•	 Develop a Twitter brand page so customers can follow your posts.
•	 If you already use a display advertising program like Google’s AdWords or a Face-
book display ad account, you can create a new campaign using the same ads 
designed specifically for mobile platforms. 
•	 Consider opening an iAd account and using Apple’s iAd network or Google’s AdMob 
in part because these ad networks can publish and track your ads on multiple 
platforms simultaneously.
•	 Develop marketing content that is aimed specifically at the mobile user, with videos 
and high levels of interactivity designed for the mobile screen. 
•	 Measure and manage your campaign. iAd and AdWords, along with many other 
ad networks, will host and manage your mobile campaigns. In addition, they can 
provide you with a host of campaign measures that will allow you to see which 
mobile ads and techniques are attracting the most followers, comments, and social 
activity concerning your brand. With this basic data you can start to manage the 
mobile marketing campaign by reducing expenditures on ads that do not work and 
increasing the budget of ads that do work. 
MEASURING MOBILE MARKETING RESULTS
There are many different mobile marketing objectives, and therefore different types 
of mobile marketing campaigns. Some campaigns are sales-oriented, based on display 
and search ads, offering coupons or discounts, and taking users directly to a Web site 
where they can buy something. Measuring the results of these mobile campaigns 
follows similar campaigns launched on desktops. Other campaigns focus on branding, 
where the objective is to engage consumers in a conversation, acquire them as fans, 
and spread the word among their friends. You can use the framework from Figure 
7.4 on page 429 to measure the results of these campaigns. The key dimensions to 
measure for mobile social campaigns are fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, 
community, brand strength (center of conversation), and sales. 
Figure 7.12 illustrates how a brand-oriented marketing campaign utilizing the 
mobile platform and social marketing might present its effectiveness measures over 

a six-month period. In a branding campaign, the object is not so much sales as it is 
strengthening consumers’ engagement with the brand. In the example provided in 
Figure 7.12, acquiring fans is measured by the number of unique visitors. Here you 
can see that over six months, visitors have risen over 60%. Engagement is reflected in 
the time on-site (in thousands of minutes); amplification is measured by the number 
of Likes, and this has expanded threefold. Community is measured by the number of 
posts, suggesting fans are actively engaging with one another and the brand. Posts have 
risen eightfold in the period. Brand strength is best summarized in this figure as the 
composite picture of fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, and community mea-
sures. Measuring the impacts of this mobile campaign on ultimate sales requires going 
a step further and measuring which sales can be attributed to this mobile campaign. 
	  7.4 	 LOCAL AND LOCATION-BASED MOBILE MARKETING 
Location-based marketing is one of the fastest growing segments of the digital market-
ing universe. Location-based marketing targets marketing messages to users based 
on their location. Generally, location-based marketing involves marketing of location-
based services. Location-based services involve providing services to users based on

their location. Examples of location-based services are: personal navigation (How do 
I get there?), point-of-interest (What’s that?), reviews (What’s the best restaurant in 
the neighborhood?), friend-finder (Where are you? Where’s the crowd?), and family-
tracker services (Where is my child?). There is a connection, of course: the more 
people use their mobile devices to search for and obtain local services, the more 
opportunities there are for marketers to target consumers with messages at just the 
right moment, at just the right location, and in just the right way—not too pushy and 
annoying, but in a way to improve the consumer experience at the moment of local 
shopping and buying. This is the ideal in any event. Location-based marketing can 
take place on a desktop as well because browsers and marketers know your approxi-
mate location. But in this section we focus primarily on location-based mobile market-
ing, which is where the greatest growth and opportunities lie. 
Experience and market research suggest that consumers want local ads, offers, 
information, and content. Consumers have a high likelihood of acting on local ads and 
purchasing the products and services offered. Because it has evolved so rapidly in the 
last five years, experience and research with respect to location-based marketing is a 
work in progress with many different platforms, providers, and techniques. Measures 
of effectiveness and returns on investment are being developed. 
THE GROWTH OF LOCAL MARKETING
Prior to the release of Google Maps in 2005, nearly all local advertising was nondigital 
and provided by local newspapers, radio and television stations, local yellow pages, 
and billboards. Of course, some was digital, involving the Web sites of local merchants. 
Today, total media ad spending in the United States is $187 billion, and approximately 
$139 billion of this is local media spending by both national and local brands. An 
estimated 40% of this local advertising (about $55 billion) involves truly local firms 
like restaurants, grocery stores, theaters, and shoe stores marketing to their local 
audience. The remaining 60% of local media marketing involves large national firms 
marketing to local audiences, such as an ad for Coca-Cola in a local newspaper or Web 
sites created for local auto dealers by national firms. Of the $139 billion of local media 
spending, about 26% ($36 billion) will be spent on online marketing, and this amount 
is expected to grow to about $51 billion by (BIA/Kelsey, 2015a). 
After the introduction of Google Maps in 2005 and smartphones in 2007, online 
local marketing began to rapidly expand. Google Maps on desktop computers enabled 
the targeting of ads to users based on a general sense of their IP address and enabled 
merchants to display ads to users based on the general location of potential customers, 
usually within a several square-mile radius. IP addresses can be used to identify a city, 
and a neighborhood within the city, but not a zip code, street, or building. Google Maps 
helped users answer the question “Where can I find an Italian restaurant” in a city or 
section of a city from their desktop. The arrival of smartphones in 2007, and Google’s 
mobile maps app, took this one step further. The GPS receivers in second-generation 
smartphones introduced in 2008 (Apple’s 3G iPhone), along with other techniques, 
meant that a user’s location (latitude and longitude) could be fairly well known by 
cell phone manufacturers, marketers, service providers, and carriers like AT&T and 
Verizon. These developments opened an entirely new growth path for local online

advertising that heretofore had been confined to the desktop. In this new world, a 
local food market could shout out to mobile phone users as they walked by the store, 
offering discounts to responders, and users in turn could search for specific retail stores 
nearby, even checking their inventory before walking into the store. 
THE GROWTH OF LOCATION-BASED (LOCAL) MOBILE MARKETING
Location-based (local) mobile marketing is currently a small part of the online market-
ing environment, but it is expected to triple over the next 5 years. Figure 7.13 helps 
put the location-based mobile market in perspective. In 2015, total U.S online market-
ing will be about $59 billion and local online marketing is expected to be a healthy and 
surprisingly large $36 billion. The part of local online that is location-based mobile is 
expected to generate an estimated $6.6 billion.
The ad formats used in local mobile marketing are familiar—search ads, display, 
native/social, videos, and SMS text messages. Search ads displayed as a part of user 
search results comprise the largest location-based mobile ad format, with U.S. mar-
keters expected to spend an estimated $7.2 billion in 2015. The local mobile search 
market is dominated by Google. Display ads are the second largest format, and are 
expected to account for $4.9 billion in spending in 2015. Social/native ads are the 
fastest growing format, generating an estimated $3.6 billion in spending in 2015. Here 
the main players are Facebook and Google. Together, Google and Facebook account 
for 70% of location-based mobile marketing. Local mobile ads are the fastest growing 
format with over $3 billion in ads for 2015. The primary platform for video ads today is 
Google’sYouTube with Facebook and Twitter both developing their video ad platforms. 
Figure 7.14 illustrates the relative shares of location-based mobile ad format spending 
in the United States in 2015 (BIA/Kelsey, 2015a).
Local online marketing in the United States will account for $36 billion in marketing expenditures in 2015, 
with location-based mobile expected to account for $6.6 billion of that amount.

LOCATION-BASED MARKETING PLATFORMS
The key players in location-based mobile marketing are the same giants who dominate 
the mobile marketing environment described in a previous section, namely, Google, 
Facebook, Apple, Twitter, YP (formerly Yellow Pages), Pandora, and Millenial. Google 
is clearly the leading location-based marketer largely because of its widely used Google 
Maps app on smartphones. When a consumer searches for a location on Google Maps, 
it is an ideal marketing moment to pop an ad before the consumer’s eyes. Google 
Places is a simple but effective service that provides short business profiles when 
users search for a specific business. Google’s Android operating system has location 
functionality built into the system, and Google apps, like Google Maps, continuously 
update the user’s location. Google purchased a mobile advertising firm called AdMob 
in 2009 and claims to be the world’s largest mobile advertising firm for both Android 
and Apple’s iOS operating systems. App developers use AdMob to provide their apps 
with consumer and user location information. Google also sells location information 
to independent marketing firms. Marketing firms use AdMob to develop full-screen 
rich media ads. Google’s main revenue stream comes from its AdWords service, where 
marketers bid for keywords on Google’s search engine. AdWords used to be the same 
whether displayed on a desktop computer or a mobile device. Google has upgraded 
its AdWords service to optimize ads for user contexts and devices, and to provide 
management of campaigns across all mobile and desktop devices. The new service 
is called Enhanced AdWords. For instance, if a customer searches for “pizza” on a 
desktop computer from work at 1 PM, he or she would be shown restaurants nearby 
Search is the leading location-based mobile ad format.

and a quick order form. If the customer searched for “pizza” at 8 PM on a smartphone 
within a half-mile of a pizza restaurant, he or she might be shown a click-to-call phone 
number and directions to the restaurant. Pizza restaurants pay Google for the chance 
to show up in these searches. 
Google and Apple have advantages in the location-based market: they both have 
developed extensive maps of Wi-Fi networks throughout the world, allowing them to 
develop much more precise location information than competitors. 
Apple’s mobile platform iAd provides location data to iOS app developers and 
mobile marketing firms. Like AdMob, when users click on an iAd ad, a full-screen ad 
appears within the app they are using. The ad can be targeted to the user’s location. 
LOCATION-BASED MOBILE MARKETING: THE TECHNOLOGIES
Location-based services and marketing require marketers and local service providers 
to have a fairly precise idea of where consumer mobile devices are located. There are 
two general types of location-based marketing techniques: geo-aware and proximity 
marketing. Geo-aware techniques identify the location of a user’s device and then 
target marketing to the device, recommending actions within reach (which, in itself, 
requires the marketer to know where relevant things like stores are located). For 
instance, a marketer may target smartphones within several square city blocks to alert 
them to available offers from participating merchants. Proximity marketing tech-
niques identify a perimeter around a physical location, and then target ads to users 
within that perimeter, recommending actions possible within the fenced-in area. The 
perimeter can be from hundreds of feet (in urban areas) to several miles (in suburban 
locations). For instance, if users walk into the geo-fenced perimeter of a store, restau-
rant, or retail shop, they will receive ads from these businesses. Both of these tech-
niques utilize the same locating technologies.
Ad networks, local-mobile marketing firms, providers of devices and services like 
Google and Apple, as well as phone companies use several methods for locating mobile 
devices, none of which are perfect, and all of which have varying degrees of accuracy. 
Table 7.15 describes the major locating technologies used to enable location-based 
services and marketing. 
GPS (Global Positioning System) location is the most accurate positioning method 
in theory. In practice, the signal can be weak in urban areas, nonexistent inside 
buildings, signals can be deflected, and it can take a long time (30–60 seconds) for the 
device to acquire the signal and calculate a position. When a clear signal is obtained, 
GPS can be accurate to within 3–10 meters under ideal conditions, but more fre-
quently, a cell phone’s GPS is accurate only to within 50 meters—half a football field. 
Also, users have to activate the feature, and many do not for privacy reasons. Assisted 
GPS (A-GPS) supplements GPS information with other information from the phone 
network to speed up acquisition. Nearly all smartphones use A-GPS. In Apple’s iOS, 
users can decide whether to turn Location Services on or off. When turned on, the iOS 
uses GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi networks to determine the user’s approximate location 
to within 10 meters (30 feet) although in many situations acccuracy can be much 
higher, around 15 feet. The user’s iPhone continuously reports its position and reports 
to Apple servers.

Cell tower location is used by wireless telephone carriers to track the location 
of their devices, which is required to complete phone calls as devices pass from the 
range of one tower into the range of another. Cell tower location is also the basis of 
the wireless emergency response system in the United States. The FCC’s wireless 
Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) rules require wireless carriers to track cellphone locations 
whether or not the user has turned on location services in order to assist emergency 
responders in locating users who make 911 calls.
Wi-Fi location is used in conjunction with GPS signals to more accurately locate 
a user based on the known location of Wi-Fi transmitters, which are fairly ubiquitous 
in urban and suburban locations. Apple, Google, and other mobile service providers 
have developed global databases of wireless access points simply by driving cars 
around urban areas in much of the world. Google uses Street View cars to build a global 
database of wireless access points and their geographic location. Android applications 
can use this database to determine the approximate location of individuals based on 
the Wi-Fi networks detected by their mobile devices. All Wi-Fi devices continuously 
monitor the presence of local Wi-Fi networks, and mobile devices report back this 
data to Apple and Microsoft, along with other device manufacturers, who use similar 
methods. The goal of these technologies is to provide consumers and marketers with 
“micro-location data” accurate to within a few feet to support truly real-time, accurate, 
local marketing at the personal level. For instance, if you are looking at a rack of dress 
shirts in a retail store, an accurate positioning system could detect this, and direct you 
to appropriate accessories like socks and ties on surrounding shelves. 
WHY IS LOCAL MOBILE ATTRACTIVE TO MARKETERS?
Consumers who seek information about local businesses using mobile devices are 
much more active and ready to purchase than desktop users. In part this is because 
desktop searchers for local information are not in as close proximity to merchants as 
are mobile searchers. A recent Google survey found that over 80% of U.S. consumers

use smartphones and tablet computers to conduct local searches on search engines 
for a variety of local information such as business hours, local store addresses and 
directions, and availability of products at local stores. The survey found that consumers 
search for local information through the purchase process, and 50% of smartphone 
users visited a store within a day of their local search, and 18% made a purchase within 
a day. The survey also found that over 60% of smartphone users wanted ads custom-
ized both to their city/zip code and to their immediate surroundings (Google, 2014a). 
LOCATION-BASED MARKETING TOOLS
Location-based digital marketing, like social marketing, presents students of digital 
marketing with a confusing array of new services, platforms, and firms that provide 
these services. While some local-based marketing techniques, like placing ads on 
Google’s AdSense platform aimed at mobile customers, are relatively easy to establish 
for the small business owner, others require the help of mobile marketing provider 
firms. 
A New Lexicon: Location-Based Digital Marketing Features 
Location-based services involve providing services to users based on their location. 
Examples include personal navigation, point-of-interest, reviews, friend-finder, and 
family-tracker services. Table 7.16 describes how some of these features can be used 
for marketing.
Proximity Marketing with Beacons 
While all location-based marketing is in some sense proximity marketing, when Apple 
introduced iBeacon in 2013 with its iOS 7, it made it possible for retail store retailers 
to communicate directly and quite precisely with customers as they passed within a 
few feet of in-store beacons. There are many close proximity technologies such as QR 
codes, Wi-Fi, and NFC (Near Field Communication), but each has drawbacks in terms 
of precision, cost, and widespread availability. Now that Apple has adopted NFC in 
its hardware for Apple Pay, NFC will become a good candidate technology for close 
proximity marketing. Apple’s iBeacon uses a different technology called Bluetooth 
Low Energy (BLE). Android phones also have this capability. BLE is inexpensive to 
implement, and uses much less power than traditional Bluetooth. Unlike QR codes, 
BLE has a two-way, push-pull communication capability. Using QR codes, consumers 
need to show the code to a QR scanner, and then they see information on a product. 
With iBeacon, consumers can be contacted as soon as they walk into a store and 
exposed to special offers, and then when browsing the store, contacted as they pass 
specific areas, like the jewelry department. This all takes place automatically on the 
user’s iPhone. Consumers can respond to these messages as well. For retailers, in-store 
beacon marketing is aimed at four objectives. The customer can be engaged imme-
diately on entry to the store, and then accompanied electronically from one area to 
another, somewhat similar to how luxury retail stores assign a salesperson to high-end 
consumers. Second, beacons can be used to stimulate loyalty programs. Consumers 
who buy often can be noticed upon entering the store. Third, retailers can engage 
in flash sales, instant discounts, and other impulse marketing programs inside their

physical stores. Finally, beacons can be used silently, not pushing offers or goods, but 
instead just gathering data directly about in-store consumer behavior. 
Currently, beacon technology, essentially in-store Bluetooth devices that can 
communicate with user smartphones entering the store, are stand-alone apps, each 
following different standards. But several technology firms are trying to build in beacon 
capabilities to their popular platforms. In 2015, Google announced its Eddystone 
open-source standard that can work with iOS or Android. Facebook developed a pilot 
program called Place Tips, offering free Bluetooth devices to merchants. When users 
are recognized as being close to a merchant, Facebook posts to their News Feed sug-
gesting they visit the merchant or buy a product. Twitter recently invested in Swirl, 
a beacon platform, but has not yet announced how it will be integrated with Twitter’s 
newsfeed or ad platform.

Proximity marketing
Send messages to consumers in the area of a store or outlet to 
generate sales using a virtual fence around a retail location (could 
also be an airport, train station, or arena). Generally opt in. Miller 
Coors created a geo-fence around 28 U.S. airports to alert Blue 
Moon beer fans on where it could be purchased.

Messaging consumers while entering or browsing in a store. 
Retailers collect, analyze, and respond to customers’ real-time 
shopping behavior.

American Express My Offers app presents cardholders with 
personalized deals based on their location. 

Reportedly, 20% of mobile marketing firms that use geo-location marketing are 
using beacons. One analyst claims that over 400 million beacons will be in place in 
five years although most will be in the non-retail world from museums to parks and 
tourist sites. 
In 2014, Macy’s started to deploy iBeacon in many of its retail stores after a suc-
cessful test of the system in San Francisco and New York. Using an app from Shopkick 
(a marketing firm) called shopBeacon, Macy’s customers who have downloaded the 
app receive notifications to open the app when they enter a Macy’s store. Customers 
receive promotions, deals, and discounts. The hope is that by using proximity market-
ing, retail stores will be able to attract more consumers to their stores, and increase 
purchases from those who come to their stores. While Macy’s initially planned to 
install 4,000 beacons throughout its retail chain, they have not revealed how many 
are installed, or what the results have been. Target has announced it will be installing 
beacons in 50 of its stores in 2015 (Marks, 2015). 
Despite the claims of proponents of beacon marketing, real-world retailers have 
only developed a few pilot programs. Consumers do not appear to have much interest 
in the technology. Beacons require users to have Bluetooth turned on. But only 20% 
of smartphone users in the United States have Bluetooth turned on, and another 20% 
claimed their smartphones did not have Bluetooth (even though they likely did have 
it). Consumers are also concerned about the privacy implications of being tracked 
through a store or on the streets. Many do not want to be bothered with in-store noti-
fications, and may resent the intrusion. One beacon platform firm found that pushing 
notices to in-store consumers actually led to a decline in the use of the app, and more 
than one push notice caused a 300% drop in app usage (eMarketer, Inc., 2015o). 
STARTING A LOCATION-BASED MARKETING CAMPAIGN
As with all marketing campaigns, start by identifying your objectives and understand 
just how a location-based mobile marketing campaign might help your business. 
Location-based marketing is generally much more action-oriented than other forms 
of online marketing. A person is in a given location only for a short time, measured in 
minutes and hours, rarely days or weeks. If you want the consumer to do something, 
it’s now. Does your product or service have this quality? Is there something related to 
a person’s location that fits with your product? Is there something about your products 
that makes them especially attractive to a mobile audience at a specific location and 
time? There are very few products and services that don’t have a location connection. 
Next, consider the target demographic for your campaign and products. Location-
aware consumers (those with mobile devices and familiar with location-based services) 
tend to be a younger, more educated, and wealthier demographic. They have many of 
the same characteristics as all mobile shoppers.
A strategic analysis of your marketspace is very important. The same questions 
that you would seek to answer if you were doing a nonlocation-aware mobile market-
ing campaign apply to a location-based marketing effort, such as examining what your 
competitors are doing. 
Once you have envisioned your marketing campaign and identified your market, 
it is time to start implementing your mobile campaign. The same steps that you would

follow in implementing a mobile campaign apply to location-based marketing as well. 
Note that you can’t do everything at once—mobile-centric and location-based. Start 
by doing something simple like local search. Then consider more sophisticated local-
based marketing tactics.
MEASURING LOCATION-BASED MARKETING RESULTS
There are a great many ways to measure the success of a mobile location-based cam-
paign, some very sophisticated. The measures of success will vary depending on the 
objective of the campaign, which might be to raise the awareness of your brand among 
consumers, to bring customers to your retail store, or a click-to-call campaign where 
you want people to make reservations for a concert. 
Because mobile local campaigns use the same marketing ad formats as both tradi-
tional and mobile Web marketing, the basic measures of effectiveness are similar. For 
instance, the number of impressions (people who see an ad), click-through rate, and 
unique visitors are basic measures for a mobile local campaign. But mobile location-based 
marketing is much more personal and social than traditional Web marketing or even 
simple mobile marketing: it’s a marketing message directed to a consumer’s personal 
mobile device based on that person’s location. Local mobile marketers hope consumers 
will take follow-on action almost immediately—inquire, reserve, click-to-call, friend, and 
ultimately purchase. Table 7.17 describes some of the basic dimensions and metrics to 
use when evaluating a mobile marketing campaign. The nature of the location-based 
campaign makes a difference for how you measure success. For instance, in a click-to-call 
campaign, you want to measure the volume of calls, duration of call, new versus existing 
customers, and the number of accidental or hostile calls.

E x c h a n g e H u n t e r J u m p e r. c o m : 
Building a Brand with Social Marketing
T
he Internet and Web have enabled thousands of business ideas to become 
online realities. The Internet has reduced the costs of starting a small 
business, and allowed small players to effectively use the same market-
ing and selling tools as major corporations. Small businesses usually 
occupy a market niche not occupied by big players or corporations. One such market 
niche in America, comprising about 10,000 to 30,000 players, is the high-end horse 
show circuit. These are people who are willing to drop $200,000 on a horse that can 
jump a five-foot fence with ease. This may be a very small market, but its members 
are highly motivated to both buy and sell horses, and they are willing to spend in the 
process. ExchangeHunterJumper.com is one example of how a small business focusing 
on a tiny niche market was able to successfully build an online brand.
According to Dagny Amber Aslin, founder and owner of ExchangeHunterJumper.
com (The Exchange), a Web site created to help owners and professional trainers 
sell high-end competition horses, it’s hard to “get rich” or even make money on the 
Internet. She adds, “There are a lot of preconceived notions … I beat down a path

previously unplowed. It cost us a lot of money and we suffered many setbacks from 
our mistakes.” Yet the site is still growing and has succeeded where others failed. How 
did Aslin break through and develop a site that works for professionals buying and 
selling alike? How did she build trust? How did she market her services?
Experience helped. Aslin started with applicable experience—in the horse world 
and in the world of Internet marketing. In addition to riding and competing as a child, 
Aslin spent several years working as a professional trainer. Working six-day weeks, 
including weekends, and spending most of her time outdoors riding, teaching, and 
competing, she saw first-hand the challenges facing professional horsemen, and she 
gained valuable credibility with those who would become her audience.
While working in the horse business, and learning how difficult it was to make 
a living, she took a part-time job as an assistant to a top California real estate agent, 
helping him market and sell high-end real estate in the Santa Barbara area. Among 
other activities, she helped him develop and expand his Web site. Through that 
experience, she realized that “selling six-figure horses and seven-figure houses are 
ridiculously similar—both tend to be overpriced, have emotional strings attached, 
require vettings and exhaustive negotiations, involve agents, and the list goes on.” In 
2005, when she moved from California back to the Midwest, where she had spent her 
childhood, The Exchange was born. Seven years later, the equine marketing model 
she has built is “a customized copy” of the real estate program she assisted with in 
Santa Barbara.
Aslin knew that busy horse professionals needed a high-quality, reliable source 
of suitable mounts for their clients, but their day-to-day business lives left them little 
time to thoroughly search the market, and they often lacked a good grasp of modern 
media technology. The same dilemma applied when it came to selling high-end horses. 
In response, she created an organized, professional process for preparing online horse 
sale advertisements. It included detailed forms for sellers to fill out, and she insisted 
that quality photos and video be provided for each horse advertised, enabling her 
to turn the descriptions into accurate portrayals of each animal and its capabilities. 
She created a fee structure that was reasonable and affordable, and she developed a 
multi-channel marketing program.
Aslin understood that her business plan needed to be a living document, evolving 
over time based on what the market was telling her. This helped her make inroads in 
a traditional industry that is very resistant to change. Most horse professionals spend 
their days outside, and tend to do business only with those they know personally—the 
level of trust is very low. Most existing horse sale Web sites were little more than online 
classifieds cluttered with unreliable information. Although professional horsemen 
have been slow to use computers and the Internet, the rise of smartphones and tablet 
computers has helped increase their comfort level with technology.
The Exchange took all of these things into account, and Aslin went further. In 
order to remain true to her business goal of providing a reliable service to profes-
sionals in the horse industry that would become a source of good horses described 
accurately, Aslin personally reviewed all potential advertisers. In some cases she 
went back to sellers and insisted on higher quality photographs and video, and in 
other cases where she determined the horse was not as represented, she turned

down their business. The initial business plan process involved strict screening, 
and it meant turning away money and valuing quality over quantity in every area—
horses, buyers, traffic, and ads. It was a hard and expensive premise to adhere to 
when building a reputation from scratch, but through persistence and dedication it 
has worked, and today, The Exchange’s reputation and “brand” has become one of 
its most valuable assets.
In discussing some of the obstacles she faced in getting The Exchange up and 
running, Aslin starts with education—her own or lack thereof, specifically in the areas 
of graphic design and Web technology. While she knew what professional horsemen 
needed, she did not know how to translate that into graphic design or onto the Web. 
She says that looking back on the original logo and print designs is “a painful exercise,” 
but she is happy with the current direction.
The budget was also an initial obstacle, as there wasn’t a lot of money to spend 
up front. However, in hindsight, she believes that gave her an advantage because she 
had to learn what her market wanted and was able to do so without breaking the bank. 
Conversely, her main competitor took an opposite track, spent big up front, missed 
the mark with customers, and is now defunct.
In addition, she faced the negative perception among industry professionals and 
prospective buyers that equine Internet advertising was “worthless.” Further, much of 
her target audience barely knew how to use a computer, didn’t have e-mail addresses, 
and had been doing business in the same old-school manner for decades. For a few 
key players this worked very well, but it left a void for those outside that inner circle 
to move horses. Through a combination of knowledge of the marketplace, on-the-job 
training, perseverance, and listening to what the market was telling her, The Exchange 
has successfully begun to fill that void.
Here’s how it works. The Exchange handles advertising for sellers and trainers 
across the country. In 2015, show horses advertised on The Exchange are typically 
priced from $15,000 to $250,000. The recession caused prices to fall significantly, but 
the prices in certain parts of the market have rebounded. The Exchange specializes 
strictly in hunter-jumper show horses, and specifically those suited for high-level 
competition.
Trainers/sellers who sign up for a premium listing pay a flat $250 fee for the initial 
advertisement and a subscription fee of $35/month, which includes a listing on The 
Exchange’s Web site featuring the horse’s details, photos, show record, lineage, and 
videos. The Exchange provides copy-writing services and professionally edits all videos 
supplied by sellers, hosting them on its private server and making them available to 
download, embed, and share. Each listing typically takes 8–10 hours to prepare. In 
2012, The Exchange added a second listing alternative—a Sale Barn listing for $300 
a month or $3,000 a year, that allows for listing of up to 10 horses. A three-month 
commitment is required, but there are no initial or other fees. Aimed at high-volume 
operations with frequent turnover, the Sale Barn page can link to the seller’s Web site, 
YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter feeds, if available, with the goal of increasing overall 
brand awareness for the seller’s business. Aslin designed the Sale Barn as an affordable 
option for professionals who might otherwise be reluctant to spend on marketing. 
International sellers are given a slight additional discount. In 2015, the Sale Program

program has taken off, with 10 different sales barns listed, including one in Germany 
and one in France.
Statistics show that a horse’s first month online is most successful in terms of 
the number of Web page visits. With the addition of monthly campaign management, 
The Exchange helps keep each horse’s marketing fresh and up to date. Updates can 
immediately escalate a horse’s popularity as much as 30% and attract new potential 
buyers. Sellers are encouraged to provide updates as frequently as possible. Online 
videos add to the brand of the horse for sale and are especially important for young 
horses or those “growing into” their price tags. Updates are added to the Web site and 
promoted through various media outlets including Facebook and e-mail campaigns.
Sellers currently fill out two separate forms: a credit card registration form and an 
equine fact sheet. The fact sheet includes a long series of checkboxes from which sellers 
select preworded traits, coupled with space for additional written descriptions. This saves 
some production time, although writing the actual copy is still a major part of the value 
that The Exchange provides. To implement this option, Aslin spent time investigating 
form-building tools. Custom-built form solutions were likely to be too expensive, so she 
played with numerous online form generators and ultimately was able to find some that 
offered great functionality at a relatively low cost. So, for example, a seller can indicate 
that the horse is a “jumper” and questions specific to jumpers will be displayed.
The Exchange develops a specific marketing strategy for each horse listed. This 
includes reviewing information submitted, combing through a horse’s official show 
record, considering impartial impressions, and identifying the most likely buyers. If 
The Exchange thinks that the photos or videos don’t help to sell the horse, they advise 
the seller on how to improve them. This advice stems from experience in marketing 
all types of horses from coast to coast, and an understanding of varied buyer profiles 
and geographic trends that exist in the market.
Social marketing forms the core of the Exchange’s marketing efforts. Starting in 2009, 
The Exchange began experimenting with social media including RSS feeds, YouTube, 
Facebook, Twitter, and now, Instagram. Aslin notes that when she began The Exchange, 
social media was not yet the phenomenon that it is today, but when its significance 
started to became apparent, she had no choice but to jump in and begin using it, learn-
ing as she went. The Exchange has experienced varying success with social media. For 
instance, The Exchange runs multiple RSS feeds through the free service, FeedBurner, 
although thus far, the equestrian set does not appear to be particularly interested in RSS 
feed subscriptions. The company’s YouTube channel has been largely supplanted by a 
professional video management system from Vzaar that hosts all of its videos, serves to 
most smartphones, and provides more control, branding, and flexibility than YouTube 
without any annoying advertisements. Facebook has been the most resounding social 
media success. The Exchange now has over 11,000 fans on Facebook. In addition, Aslin’s 
personal Facebook friends, which number over 1,400, extend her cumulative Facebook 
reach to over 12,000 friends and fans, and make her online marketing efforts even more 
personal. The Exchange’s Twitter account has almost 2,000 followers, and links with 
both The Exchange’s Facebook page and its YouTube channel. The YouTube channel 
has over 300 subscribers, and over 50,000 views. The latest social media platform now 
in The Exchange’s sights is Instagram, which Aslin believes may be very beneficial,

because visuals such as photos and video play such an important role in the marketing 
of show horses. The Exchange’s Instagram feed already has almost 2,000 followers. 
Because every business is different, The Exchange’s experience suggests it’s important 
for e-commerce sites to experiment with social media to determine which outlets are 
most effective in reaching their specific target audiences. The Exchange’s successful use 
of social media in the equestrian industry was recognized when it was named one of 
10 finalists for the 2012 PagePlay Equestrian Social Media Awards for best use of social 
media in North America.
To track the effectiveness of her social marketing efforts, Aslin uses various track-
ing systems. For instance, Google Analytics allows her to track exactly how many 
people are on the ExchangeHunterJumper site in real time and how they got there. 
Aslin has found that focusing solely on Likes is not sufficient. For example, she notes 
that a photo she posted advertising a horse on Facebook generated only 10 Likes, but 
that actually almost 150 people followed the link associated with the photo to the 
ExchangeHunterJumper Web site. She also uses a short URL service, bit.ly, to create 
unique URLs associated with Facebook and other social media posts that have built-
in click trackers. This enables her to quickly see the collective success of her social 
marketing efforts; in a good month, bit.ly stats show around 5,000 click-throughs to 
the ExchangeHunterJumper site. 
Another challenge is developing the actual social media content, which needs 
to be presented in such as way as to attract attention, and determining the optimal 
amount and timing of new content to post each day. Aslin notes that if she posts too 
many times a day, or posts too much content too close together, the reach of her posts 
seems to drop off.
Although Facebook is currently the primary social marketing platform for 
ExchangeHunterJumper, the firm also has loyal followers on Twitter. Although Aslin 
doubts that many of these followers are actual buyers or sellers at this time, she notes 
that in the future they probably will be. Her site has grown up along with her clientele, 
and children who once drooled over ponies on her site are now, 10 years later, soon-
to-be adults and, possibly, young professionals. 
The firm’s Web site is also a key element of its e-commerce presence. Aslin con-
tinually reviews the design of the Web site with an eye to making it the most effective 
marketing tool possible. She built the original site herself in 2005 and updated it almost 
yearly in response to her target market’s needs. In 2012, Aslin relaunched the site for 
a fifth time, and for the first time ever hired a professional Web development team to 
convert the static HTML site into a dynamically driven content management system 
on the Expression Engine platform. While she was able to keep costs low by designing 
and developing the site’s CSS layout, the advanced functionality that was desired, such 
as the sale horse filter that enables shoppers to sort horses based on price, location, 
gender, type, and size, still required a hefty five-figure investment. Aslin believes 
the ability to get to know the market and update the site accordingly has kept The 
Exchange fresh and innovative. Every iteration of the Web site has been focused on 
meeting the target market’s needs. For instance, she has also spent considerable time 
and expense to make sure The Exchange’s Web site, including video, works just as well 
on mobile devices as it does on a traditional laptop or desktop computer. Aslin has

scrapped plans to create a stand-alone mobile site in favor of using responsive design 
techniques for The Exchange’s site. And possibly on the horizon—browser-friendly 
30-inch TV screens! Although potentially representing a whole new environment that 
would need to be designed for, Aslin believes it would actually be a great tool for her 
particular industry, given that it is so video reliant.
In addition to the Web site, The Exchange uses a variety of other marketing strate-
gies, including e-mail campaigns, magazine advertising, and word of mouth. It ceased 
distributing its four-color, printed National Sales List booklet due to its high cost, and 
now relies almost totally on various types of online marketing. Aslin has found it has 
been extremely helpful to have the Web development experience she has honed over 
the years. Here are some of her words of wisdom: She feels that entrepreneurs don’t 
necessarily have to know how to build sites, but do need to be familiar with what is 
and what is not possible in site construction. It is important to understand which 
functions are complicated and which are not, so that overly complicated add-ons that 
don’t really add to the user experience can be eliminated from tight budgets. It’s also 
important to know what technology is popular now and what technology is just around 
the corner. Even if you think you are proficient in all the tasks you will need to launch 
your business, with the rapid pace of technology, you inevitably spend much of your 
time learning something totally new, whether you want to or not. 
By paying attention to these words of wisdom, as well as to detail at every step of 
the marketing process, The Exchange has managed to build a successful brand, one 
the horse community has come to rely upon.

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the difference between traditional online marketing and the new social-mobile-local marketing platforms 
and the relationships between social, mobile, and local marketing. 
•	
Social, mobile, and local marketing have transformed the online marketing landscape. The major trends 
and concepts include:
•	
The emphasis in online marketing has shifted from exposing consumers to messages toward engag-
ing them in conversations about your brand. 
•	
Social marketing means all things social: listening, discussing, interacting, empathizing, and engag-
ing the consumer.
•	
Social marketing and advertising is not simply a “new ad channel,” but a collection of technology-
based tools for communicating with shoppers.
•	
In the past, businesses could tightly control their brand messaging and lead consumers down a fun-
nel of cues that ended in a purchase. This is no longer the case. Instead, consumer purchase deci-
sions are increasingly driven by the conversations, choices, tastes, and opinions of the consumer’s 
social network.
•	
Social, mobile, and local marketing are the fastest growing forms of online marketing.
•	
Social, mobile, and local digital marketing are self-reinforcing and connected.
•	
As mobile devices become more powerful, they are more useful for accessing Facebook and other social 
sites.
•	
Local and mobile marketing are highly related: local advertisers most often target mobile devices.
•	
The strong ties among social, mobile, and local marketing have significant implications for managing a 
marketing campaign in this new environment. When you design a social marketing campaign, you must 
also consider that your customers will be accessing the campaign using mobile devices, and often they 
will also be looking for local content.
Understand the social marketing process from fan acquisition to sales and the marketing capabilities of social 
marketing platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. 
•	
In social marketing, the objective is to encourage your potential customers to become fans of your com-
pany’s products and services and engage with your business by entering into a conversation with it.
•	
There are five steps in the social marketing process model: fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, 
community, and brand strength and sales.
•	
Facebook is a social network with over 1.3 billion members. Facebook is designed to encourage people to 
reveal as much personal information about themselves as feasible, including activities, behavior, photos, 
music, movies, and purchases.
•	
Facebook’s features are built to maximize the connections among people in the form of notifications, 
tagging, messaging, posting, and sharing. In many instances, the movement of personal information is so 
widespread that it is beyond the understanding of users.
•	
Social density refers to the number of interactions among members of a group and reflects the “connect-
edness” of a group, even if these connections are forced on users.
•	
Facebook has many marketing tools, including the Like button, Brand Pages, News Feed ads, Right-hand 
sidebar ads, mobile ads, and Facebook Exchange.
•	
The effectiveness of Facebook ads can be measured using five stages of the social marketing model: fan 
acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and ultimately brand strengthening and sales. 

526	
	
C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
•	
Twitter is a micro-blogging social network site that allows users to send and receive 140-character mes-
sages as well as videos, photos, and article previews. 
•	
Twitter marketing tools include Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends, Promoted Accounts, Enhanced Pro-
file Pages, the Twitter Amplify program, television ad retargeting, Lead Generation Cards, and app install 
and app engagement ads.
•	
Measuring the results of Twitter marketing is similar to measuring the results of Facebook and other 
social marketing platforms, with some minor changes to account for the unique qualities of Twitter. 
•	
Pinterest is the social network site that provides users with an online board to which they can “pin” inter-
esting pictures. The success of Pinterest is based in part on a shift in consumer behavior enabled by new 
technologies: people talk about brands using pictures rather than words. 
•	
Pinterest marketing tools include Promoted Pins; adding a Pin It logo to your Web site; pinning photos to 
Pinterest and direct users to your Web site; creating theme-based Pin It boards; placing URLs to stores 
that you support and receive lead generation fees from; integrating your pins and boards with other social 
sites; networking with users and followers. 
•	
Pinterest campaigns can be measured using the same procedures as for Facebook and Twitter. The key 
dimensions to measure are fan (follower) acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and sales. 
•	
One downside of social marketing is that brands lose a substantial amount of control over where their ads 
appear in terms of other content and what people say about their brands on social sites.
Identify the key elements of a mobile marketing campaign. 
•	
Although still in its infancy, mobile marketing involves the use of mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablet computers to display banner ads, rich media, video, games, e-mail, text messaging, in-store 
messaging, QuickResponse (QR) codes, and couponing. 
•	
Mobile devices represent a radical departure from previous marketing technologies simply because the 
devices integrate so many human and consumer activities from telephoning or texting friends, to listen-
ing to music, watching videos, and using the Web to shop and purchase goods. 
•	
The mobile platform has changed over the past few years, and there are now almost as many tablet users 
as smartphone users in the United States.
•	
Mobile users spend over 85% of their mobile minutes using apps, and only 15% using their browsers. 
Marketers need to place ads in apps where consumers spend most of their time.
•	
Mobile devices create a multi-screen world: smartphones, tablets, desktops, and television. The reality, 
and the future, of computing devices is that consumers will be multi-platform: using desktops and laptops 
at work and home, and smartphones and tablets at home as well as when moving about.
•	
The implications of the multi-device platform, or screen diversity, environment are that marketing needs 
to be designed for whatever device the consumer is using, and consistent branding across platforms will 
be important.
•	
Unlike social marketing, mobile marketing does not require a great deal of new marketing vocabulary. All 
the marketing formats available on the desktop are also available on mobile devices. With few exceptions, 
mobile marketing is very much like desktop marketing—except it is smaller, mobile, and with the user all 
the time.
•	
The major marketing opportunities in mobile marketing are search ads, display ads, videos and rich media, 
messaging (SMS/MMS/PPS), and other familiar formats like e-mail, classified, and lead generation.
•	
The effectiveness of mobile marketing can be measured using the dimensions of the social marketing 
process model: fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, brand strength, and sales. Tradi-
tional Web-browser based metrics also can be used when measuring mobile campaigns. 
Understand the capabilities of location-based local marketing. 
•	
Location-based marketing is the targeting of marketing messages to users based on their location. Gener-
ally, location-based marketing involves marketing of location-based services.

	
R e v i e w 	

527
•	
Examples of location-based services are personal navigation, point-of-interest, reviews, friend-finder, and 
family-tracker services.
•	
Location-based marketing is dependent on two technologies: accurate mapping software and mobile 
device geo-positioning technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi network location data, and Bluetooth low energy 
(BLE) technology.
•	
Location-based mobile marketing is currently a small part of the online marketing environment, but is 
expected to double over the next two years, and is growing far faster than any other form of digital adver-
tising.
•	
The ad formats used in local mobile marketing are familiar—search ads, display, social/native advertis-
ing, video, and SMS text messages. A very large percentage of these local mobile ads will be delivered by 
search engines such as Google, and social sites such as Facebook.
•	
The key players in location-based mobile marketing are the same giants of advertising who dominate the 
mobile marketing environment: Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, YP (formerly Yellow Pages), Pandora, 
and Millenial.
•	
Geo-aware techniques identify the location of a user’s device and then target marketing to the device, 
recommending actions within reach.
•	
Geo-targeting of ads involves sending ads based on the user’s location. 
•	
Proximity marketing techniques identify a perimeter around a physical location, and then target ads to 
users within that perimeter, recommending actions possible within the fenced-in area.
•	
In-store messaging involves messaging consumers while entering and browsing in a retail store. This 
requires a very precise calculation of location.
•	
Consumers who seek information about local businesses using mobile devices are much more active and 
ready to purchase than desktop users.
•	
Measuring the effectiveness of location-based mobile campaigns involves using the same techniques used 
for browser-based search and display ads (impressions), but also should include the dimensions of the 
social marketing process model such as acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and brand 
strength and sales.

n June 2014, Google was forced to 
begin removing certain search engine 
query results in Europe after a ruling 
by the Court of Justice of the European 
Union, Europe’s highest court. The ruling gives 
individuals the right to request that certain 
links to personal information found through a 
search of their names be removed. The court’s 
ruling has come to be known as the “right to 
be forgotten” (sometimes given the acronym 
RTBF, or sometimes referred to as the “right 
to delist”). In an age where it seems there 
are no limits on the ability or willingness of 
private Internet firms to collect and dissemi-
nate personal information, regardless of the user consenting to or knowing of its collection 
and use, the E.U.’s ruling is possibly the beginning of a new era of digital privacy based on 
the simple idea that individuals have a right to manage their online personal information 
and public image. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and many other U.S. Internet-based firms 
whose business models depend on virtually no limitations on the collection and use of 
personal information have lobbied strongly against the idea that individuals have a right 
to manage their personal online information. However, the European Court of Justice’s 
decision is final, and Google, along with Yahoo, Microsoft, and others, have begun to 
implement the ruling. While simple in concept, the right to be forgotten can be devilishly 
difficult and expensive to implement in practice.
The court’s decision was based on a 2010 lawsuit brought by a Spanish citizen, 
Mario Costeja Gonzalez, against a Spanish newspaper, and against Google Spain and 
Google Inc. (the American parent firm), which had linked his name with an auction notice 
that his house had been repossessed and was being sold in order to pay off debts that 
appeared in the newspaper. A Google search on Gonzalez’ name returned a link to the 
newspaper notice as the most prominent link. Gonzalez’ suit said that issues of his debt 
and foreclosure had been resolved years ago, and that the reference to this event was ir-
relevant and an invasion of his privacy as defined in the European Union Data Protection 
Directive—Europe’s digital era privacy legislation that governs personal information in 
the 28 countries that make up the European Union. Gonzalez requested that the news-
paper remove or alter the pages it posted on the Web, and second, that Google Spain and 
Google Inc. be required to remove the link between his name and the auction notice in

the newspaper. Gonzalez said he was not worried about his Web image as much as the 
impact on his work and reputation as a lawyer, and the potential of the notice to injure 
his law business. There had also been thousands of other requests by Europeans asking 
Google to remove links to their names that they claim are inappropriate, inaccurate, no 
longer relevant, and interfere with their privacy. 
Google and the newspaper argued that because the server providing the results for 
Google searches in Spain was located outside Europe, the E.U. rules and privacy legisla-
tion did not apply. Google also argued that it was a search engine that simply provided 
links to information stored by others and therefore it was not a repository of personal 
information. Google also claimed that it was not responsible for the accuracy or relevance 
of information stored by other organizations, and that it was not subject to the E.U. Data 
Protection Directive because it pertained to data repositories. Finally, Google argued 
that under European law, individuals do not have the right to request that their personal 
data be removed from accessibility via a search engine. In public statements, Google also 
said it would be difficult or impossible to respond to thousands or millions of requests to 
eliminate links; granting these rights would allow criminals, fraudsters, sexual predators, 
and corrupt public officials to rewrite history; and that it would be very expensive to 
respond to requests and potentially limit innovation in the future.
In May 2014, the Court of Justice ruled that E.U. data protection policies were not 
limited by territory and apply to search engines no matter where the servers are located. 
Second, the court found that search engines are “controllers” of individual personal 
data within the European Union and therefore must comply with E.U. rules. Prior to 
this ruling, search engines like Google had been considered merely processors of online 
data, and therefore exempt from data protection rules in Europe. Finally the court found 
that Europeans do indeed have a right to ask search engines to remove links to personal 
information about them (the “right to be forgotten”) when that information is inaccurate, 
inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive. The economic interests of the search engine to provide 
unfettered access to personal information did not justify interfering with the individual’s 
right to be forgotten and personal privacy.
The court also clarified that the right to be forgotten is not absolute, but would have 
to be balanced against other rights and obligations such as freedom of expression, freedom 
of the press, and the broader public interest. For instance, the court’s ruling did not require 
the newspaper to change any of the pages in its archives. The original auction notice 
remains. In other cases, the public has an interest in ensuring that convicted criminals not 
be allowed to escape their criminal records, which are public records in most jurisdictions. 
Rather than a blanket right granted to whomever applies to have information removed 
from search engines, instead the court required a case-by-case assessment that examines 
the type of information, its potential for harm to the individual’s private life, and the in-
terest of the public in having access to that information. Also, for “public figures,” those 
who have thrust themselves into public roles, such as politicians, celebrities, or business 
leaders, the public interest in knowing may trump the private interest in being forgotten.
As of October 1, 2015, Google said it had received almost 325,000 requests from 
people who wanted, in aggregate, 1.15 million links to online information about them

removed, and that it had removed about 42% of those links based on internal guidelines 
that they have developed. However, the process has proved to be problematic. Google 
has been criticized by various European privacy regulators for its practice of inform-
ing Web sites that their links are being removed from its search results, noting that this 
may result in even more attention to the links (this is sometimes known as the Streisand 
effect, which refers to a lawsuit by Barbra Streisand that sought to have photos of her 
home removed from an online database, and which ended up publicizing the photos even 
more). In the United Kingdom, the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office has ordered 
Google to remove links to news stories about the removal of links, on the grounds that 
the new links defeat the purpose of the original removal. Other critics complain that the 
decisions should not be left in the hands of a private company. A particularly thorny issue 
has been the extent to which the right to be forgotten must be applied outside of Europe. 
Google initially interpreted the ruling as meaning that it must remove links only from 
its European search results. This interpretation was also adopted by an advisory council 
convened by Google consisting of prominent European academics, members of the press, 
and governmental regulators. However, the French privacy regulator, the Commission 
Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) disagrees and has ordered Google 
to remove search results from all of its sites around the world, or face significant fines. 
Google will likely attempt to further appeal this decision. 
The reactions to the Court of Justice’s rulings and France’s efforts to extend the right 
to forget beyond the boundaries of Europe reflect a deep digital divide between Europe 
and the United States when it comes to privacy and the balance between managing per-
sonal information (privacy) and freedom of expression and the press. U.S newspapers like 
the New York Times fear that the ruling may undermine freedom of the press and free 
speech, leave Europeans less informed in the Internet age, reduce technology innovation, 
and allow some individuals to hide their crimes of the past. The Wikimedia Foundation, 
the not-for-profit organization behind Wikipedia, publishes a list of the links to its Web 
pages that Google has removed from its search engine, so that people will know what 
information is no longer being made available to them. In Europe, in contrast, many 
celebrate the ruling as a victory over arrogant U.S. Internet companies who think they 
can do whatever they want with whatever personal information they can collect and then 
tell the victims it is all necessary for human progress and innovation, when in fact their 
sole purpose is to make money selling the same information to advertisers. The German 
Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel hailed the ruling, saying that Europe stands against 
the totalitarian idea of making every detail of human behavior, human emotion, and human 
thought an object of commercial exploitation. In fact, the right to be forgotten is just the 
tip of the new European General Data Protection Regulation that, when implemented 
in 2016, will establish a number of additional data protection rights. Because Europe is 
the United States’ largest trading partner and a very large source of revenues for U.S. 
Internet firms, there is little doubt that European views on privacy, and the idea that data 
belongs first and foremost to the individual, will have an impact on U.S. privacy claims 
and laws, especially if CNIL’s requirement that Google remove links from all its sites 
around the world, not just in Europe, prevails.

etermining how or whether personal information should be retained or 
deleted on the Internet is just one of many ethical, social, and political 
issues raised by the rapid evolution of the Internet and e-commerce. 
For instance, as discussed in the opening case, whether individuals lose control over 
all personal information once it is placed on the Internet is still up for debate in the 
United States. In Europe, in contrast, individuals do retain rights to their personal 
information. These questions are not just ethical questions that we as individuals have 
to answer; they also involve social institutions such as family, schools, business firms, 
and in some cases, entire nation-states. And these questions have obvious political 
dimensions because they involve collective choices about how we should live and 
what laws we would like to live under.
In this chapter, we discuss the ethical, social, and political issues raised in e-com-
merce, provide a framework for organizing the issues, and make recommendations 
for managers who are given the responsibility of operating e-commerce companies 
within commonly accepted standards of appropriateness.
	 8.1	
UNDERSTANDING ETHICAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL 
ISSUES IN E-COMMERCE
The Internet and its use in e-commerce have raised pervasive ethical, social, and politi-
cal issues on a scale unprecedented for computer technology. Entire sections of daily 
newspapers and weekly magazines are devoted to the social impact of the Internet. But 
why is this so? Why is the Internet at the root of so many contemporary controversies? 
Part of the answer lies in the underlying features of Internet technology itself, and the 
ways in which it has been exploited by business firms. Internet technology and its use 
in e-commerce disrupt existing social and business relationships and understandings.
Consider for instance Table 1.2 (in Chapter 1), which lists the unique features of 
Internet technology. Instead of considering the business consequences of each unique 
feature, Table 8.1 examines the actual or potential ethical, social, and/or political 
consequences of the technology.
We live in an “information society,” where power and wealth increasingly depend 
on information and knowledge as central assets. Controversies over information are 
often disagreements over power, wealth, influence, and other things thought to be valu-
able. Like other technologies, such as steam, electricity, telephones, and television, 
the Internet and e-commerce can be used to achieve social progress, and for the most 
part, this has occurred. However, the same technologies can be used to commit crimes, 
despoil the environment, and threaten cherished social values. Before automobiles, 
there was very little interstate crime and very little federal jurisdiction over crime. 
Likewise with the Internet: before the Internet, there was very little “cybercrime.”
Many business firms and individuals are benefiting from the commercial devel-
opment of the Internet, but this development also exacts a price from individuals, 
organizations, and societies. These costs and benefits must be carefully considered 
by those seeking to make ethical and socially responsible decisions in this new envi-

ronment. The question is: How can you as a manager make reasoned judgments 
about what your firm should do in a number of e-commerce areas—from securing the 
privacy of your customer’s clickstream to ensuring the integrity of your company’s 
domain name?
A MODEL FOR ORGANIZING THE ISSUES
E-commerce—and the Internet—have raised so many ethical, social, and political 
issues that it is difficult to classify them all, and hence, complicated to see their 
relationship to one another. Clearly, ethical, social, and political issues are interre-
lated. One way to organize the ethical, social, and political dimensions surrounding

Ubiquity—Internet/Web technology is 
available everywhere: at work, at home, 
and elsewhere via mobile devices, anytime.
Work and shopping can invade family life; shopping can distract workers at work, 
lowering productivity; use of mobile devices can lead to automobile and industrial 
accidents. Presents confusing issues of “nexus” to taxation authorities.
Global reach—The technology reaches 
across national boundaries, around the 
Earth.
Reduces cultural diversity in products; weakens local small firms while 
strengthening large global firms; moves manufacturing production to low-wage 
areas of the world; weakens the ability of all nations—large and small—to control 
their information destiny.
Universal standards—There is one set 
of technology standards, namely Internet 
standards.
Increases vulnerability to viruses and hacking attacks worldwide, affecting millions 
of people at once. Increases the likelihood of “information” crime, crimes against 
systems, and deception.
Richness—Video, audio, and text 
messages are possible.
A “screen technology” that reduces use of text and potentially the ability to read by 
focusing instead on video and audio messages. Potentially very persuasive 
messages that may reduce reliance on multiple independent sources of information.
Interactivity—The technology works 
through interaction with the user.
The nature of interactivity at commercial sites can be shallow and meaningless. 
Customer e-mails are frequently not read by human beings. Customers do not really 
“co-produce” the product as much as they “co-produce” the sale. The amount of 
“customization” of products that occurs is minimal, occurring within predefined 
platforms and plug-in options.
Information density—The technology 
reduces information costs, and raises 
quality.
While the total amount of information available to all parties increases, so does the 
possibility of false and misleading information, unwanted information, and invasion 
of solitude. Trust, authenticity, accuracy, completeness, and other quality features of 
information can be degraded. The ability of individuals and organizations to make 
sense out of this plethora of information is limited.
Personalization/Customization—The 
technology allows personalized messages 
to be delivered to individuals as well as 
groups.
Opens up the possibility of intensive invasion of privacy for commercial and 
governmental purposes that is unprecedented.
Social technology—The technology 
enables user content generation and social 
networking.
Creates opportunities for cyberbullying, abusive language, and predation; 
challenges concepts of privacy, fair use, and consent to use posted information; 
creates new opportunities for surveillance by authorities and corporations into 
private lives.

e-commerce is shown in Figure 8.1. At the individual level, what appears as an ethical 
issue—”What should I do?”—is reflected at the social and political levels—“What should 
we as a society and government do?” The ethical dilemmas you face as a manager of 
a business using the Web reverberate and are reflected in social and political debates. 
The major ethical, social, and political issues that have developed around e-commerce 
over the past 10 years can be loosely categorized into four major dimensions: informa-
tion rights, property rights, governance, and public safety and welfare.
Some of the ethical, social, and political issues raised in each of these areas include 
the following:
•	 Information rights: What rights to their own personal information do individuals 
have in a public marketplace, or in their private homes, when Internet technologies 
make information collection so pervasive and efficient? What rights do individuals 
have to access information about business firms and other organizations?
•	 Property rights: How can traditional intellectual property rights be enforced in 
an Internet world where perfect copies of protected works can be made and easily 
distributed worldwide in seconds?
•	 Governance: Should the Internet and e-commerce be subject to public laws? And if 
so, what law-making bodies have jurisdiction—state, federal, and/or international?
	
FIGURE 8.1	
THE MORAL DIMENSIONS OF AN INTERNET SOCIETY
The introduction of the Internet and e-commerce impacts individuals, societies, and political institutions. 
These impacts can be classified into four moral dimensions: property rights, information rights, governance, 
and public safety and welfare.

•	 Public safety and welfare: What efforts should be undertaken to ensure equitable 
access to the Internet and e-commerce channels? Should governments be respon-
sible for ensuring that schools and colleges have access to the Internet? Are certain 
online content and activities—such as pornography and gambling—a threat to public 
safety and welfare? Should mobile commerce be allowed from moving vehicles?
To illustrate, imagine that at any given moment, society and individuals are more 
or less in an ethical equilibrium brought about by a delicate balancing of individuals, 
social organizations, and political institutions. Individuals know what is expected of 
them, social organizations such as business firms know their limits, capabilities, and 
roles, and political institutions provide a supportive framework of market regulation, 
banking, and commercial law that provides sanctions against violators.
Now, imagine we drop into the middle of this calm setting a powerful new tech-
nology such as the Internet and e-commerce. Suddenly, individuals, business firms, 
and political institutions are confronted by new possibilities of behavior. For instance, 
individuals discover that they can download perfect digital copies of music tracks from 
Web sites without paying anyone, something that, under the old technology of CDs, 
would have been impossible. This can be done, despite the fact that these music tracks 
still legally belong to the owners of the copyright—musicians and record label compa-
nies. Then, business firms discover that they can make a business out of aggregating 
these digital musical tracks—or creating a mechanism for sharing musical tracks—even 
though they do not “own” them in the traditional sense. The record companies, courts, 
and Congress were not prepared at first to cope with the onslaught of online digital 
copying. Courts and legislative bodies will have to make new laws and reach new judg-
ments about who owns digital copies of copyrighted works and under what conditions 
such works can be “shared.” It may take years to develop new understandings, laws, 
and acceptable behavior in just this one area of social impact. In the meantime, as an 
individual and a manager, you will have to decide what you and your firm should do 
in legal “gray” areas, where there is conflict between ethical principles but no clear-cut 
legal or cultural guidelines. How can you make good decisions in this type of situation?
Before examining the four moral dimensions of e-commerce in greater depth, we 
will briefly review some basic concepts of ethical reasoning that you can use as a guide 
to ethical decision making, and provide general reasoning principles about the social 
and political issues of the Internet that you will face in the future.
BASIC ETHICAL CONCEPTS: RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND 
LIABILITY
Ethics is at the heart of social and political debates about the Internet. Ethics is the 
study of principles that individuals and organizations can use to determine right and 
wrong courses of action. It is assumed in ethics that individuals are free moral agents 
who are in a position to make choices. When faced with alternative courses of action, 
what is the correct moral choice? Extending ethics from individuals to business firms 
and even entire societies can be difficult, but it is not impossible. As long as there is 
a decision-making body or individual (such as a board of directors or CEO in a business 
firm, or a governmental body in a society), their decisions can be judged against a 
variety of ethical principles.

If you understand some basic ethical principles, your ability to reason about larger 
social and political debates will be improved. In western culture, there are four basic 
principles that all ethical schools of thought share: responsibility, accountability, liabil-
ity, and due process. Responsibility means that as free moral agents, individuals, 
organizations, and societies are responsible for the actions they take. Accountability 
means that individuals, organizations, and societies should be held accountable to 
others for the consequences of their actions. The third principle—liability—extends 
the concepts of responsibility and accountability to the area of law. Liability is a 
feature of political systems in which a body of law is in place that permits individuals 
to recover the damages done to them by other actors, systems, or organizations. Due 
process is a feature of law-governed societies and refers to a process in which laws 
are known and understood, and there is an ability to appeal to higher authorities to 
ensure that the laws have been correctly applied.
You can use these concepts immediately to understand some contemporary Inter-
net debates. For instance, consider the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case 
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios v. Grokster, et al. MGM had sued Grokster and other 
P2P networks for copyright infringement. The court decided that because the primary 
and intended use of Internet P2P file-sharing services such as Grokster, StreamCast, 
and Kazaa was the swapping of copyright-protected music and video files, the file-
sharing services should be held accountable and shut down. Although Grokster and 
the other networks acknowledged that the most common use of the software was for 
illegal digital music file-swapping, they argued that there were substantial, nontrivial 
uses of the same networks for legally sharing files. They also argued they should not 
be held accountable for what individuals do with their software, any more than Sony 
could be held accountable for how people use VCRs, or Xerox for how people use 
copying machines. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled that Grokster and other P2P 
networks could be held accountable for the illegal actions of their users if it could be 
shown that they intended their software to be used for illegal downloading and sharing, 
and had marketed the software for that purpose. The court relied on copyright laws to 
arrive at its decisions, but these laws reflect some basic underlying ethical principles 
of responsibility, accountability, and liability.
Underlying the Grokster Supreme Court decision is a fundamental rejection of the 
notion that the Internet is an ungoverned “Wild West” environment that cannot be 
controlled. Under certain defined circumstances, the courts will intervene into the uses 
of the Internet. No organized civilized society has ever accepted the proposition that 
technology can flaunt basic underlying social and cultural values. Through all of the 
industrial and technological developments that have taken place, societies have inter-
vened by means of legal and political decisions to ensure that the technology serves 
socially acceptable ends without stifling the positive consequences of innovation and 
wealth creation. The Internet in this sense is no different, and we can expect societies 
around the world to exercise more regulatory control over the Internet and e-commerce 
in an effort to arrive at a new balance between innovation and wealth creation, on the 
one hand, and other socially desirable objectives on the other. This is a difficult balanc-
ing act, and reasonable people will arrive at different conclusions.

ANALYZING ETHICAL DILEMMAS
Ethical, social, and political controversies usually present themselves as dilemmas. A 
dilemma is a situation in which there are at least two diametrically opposed actions, 
each of which supports a desirable outcome. When confronted with a situation that 
seems to present an ethical dilemma, how can you analyze and reason about the situ-
ation? The following is a five-step process that should help:
	1.	 Identify and clearly describe the facts. Find out who did what to whom, and 
where, when, and how. In many instances, you will be surprised at the errors 
in the initially reported facts, and often you will find that simply getting the 
facts straight helps define the solution. It also helps to get the opposing parties 
involved in an ethical dilemma to agree on the facts.
	2.	 Define the conflict or dilemma and identify the higher-order values 
involved. Ethical, social, and political issues always reference higher values. 
Otherwise, there would be no debate. The parties to a dispute all claim to be pur-
suing higher values (e.g., freedom, privacy, protection of property, and the free 
enterprise system). For example, supporters of the use of advertising networks 
such as DoubleClick argue that the tracking of consumer movements on the Web 
increases market efficiency and the wealth of the entire society. Opponents argue 
this claimed efficiency comes at the expense of individual privacy, and advertis-
ing networks should cease their activities or offer Web users the option of not 
participating in such tracking.
	 3.	 Identify the stakeholders. Every ethical, social, and political issue has stake-
holders: players in the game who have an interest in the outcome, who have 
invested in the situation, and usually who have vocal opinions. Find out the iden-
tity of these groups and what they want. This will be useful later when designing 
a solution.
	4.	 Identify the options that you can reasonably take. You may find that none 
of the options satisfies all the interests involved, but that some options do a 
better job than others. Sometimes, arriving at a “good” or ethical solution may 
not always be a balancing of consequences to stakeholders.
	 5.	 Identify the potential consequences of your options. Some options may 
be ethically correct but disastrous from other points of view. Other options may 
work in this one instance but not in other similar instances. Always ask yourself, 
“What if I choose this option consistently over time?”
Once your analysis is complete, you can refer to the following well-established 
ethical principles to help decide the matter.
CANDIDATE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
Although you are the only one who can decide which ethical principles you will follow 
and how you will prioritize them, it is helpful to consider some ethical principles with 
deep roots in many cultures that have survived throughout recorded history:
dilemma
a situation in which there 
are at least two diametri-
cally opposed actions, each 
of which supports a desir-
able outcome

•	 The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Putting 
yourself into the place of others and thinking of yourself as the object of the deci-
sion can help you think about fairness in decision making.
•	 Universalism: If an action is not right for all situations, then it is not right for any 
specific situation (Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative). Ask yourself, “If we 
adopted this rule in every case, could the organization, or society, survive?”
•	 Slippery Slope: If an action cannot be taken repeatedly, then it is not right to 
take at all. An action may appear to work in one instance to solve a problem, but if 
repeated, would result in a negative outcome. In plain English, this rule might be 
stated as “once started down a slippery path, you may not be able to stop.”
•	 Collective Utilitarian Principle: Take the action that achieves the greater value 
for all of society. This rule assumes you can prioritize values in a rank order and 
understand the consequences of various courses of action.
•	 Risk Aversion: Take the action that produces the least harm, or the least potential 
cost. Some actions have extremely high failure costs of very low probability (e.g., 
building a nuclear generating facility in an urban area) or extremely high failure 
costs of moderate probability (speeding and automobile accidents). Avoid the high-
failure cost actions and choose those actions whose consequences would not be 
catastrophic, even if there were a failure.
•	 No Free Lunch: Assume that virtually all tangible and intangible objects are owned 
by someone else unless there is a specific declaration otherwise. (This is the ethical 
“no free lunch” rule.) If something someone else has created is useful to you, it 
has value and you should assume the creator wants compensation for this work.
•	 The New York Times Test (Perfect Information Rule): Assume that the results 
of your decision on a matter will be the subject of the lead article in the New York 
Times the next day. Will the reaction of readers be positive or negative? Would 
your parents, friends, and children be proud of your decision? Most criminals and 
unethical actors assume imperfect information, and therefore they assume their 
decisions and actions will never be revealed. When making decisions involving 
ethical dilemmas, it is wise to assume perfect information markets.
•	 The Social Contract Rule: Would you like to live in a society where the principle 
you are supporting would become an organizing principle of the entire society? For 
instance, you might think it is wonderful to download illegal copies of Hollywood 
movies, but you might not want to live in a society that does not respect property 
rights, such as your property rights to the car in your driveway, or your rights to a 
term paper or original art.
None of these rules is an absolute guide, and there are exceptions and logical dif-
ficulties with all of them. Nevertheless, actions that do not easily pass these guidelines 
deserve some very close attention and a great deal of caution because the appearance 
of unethical behavior may do as much harm to you and your company as the actual 
behavior.
Now that you have an understanding of some basic ethical reasoning concepts, 
let’s take a closer look at each of the major types of ethical, social, and political debates 
that have arisen in e-commerce.

PRIVACY AND INFORMATION RIGHTS
Privacy is the moral right of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or 
interference from other individuals or organizations, including the state. Privacy is a 
girder supporting freedom: Without the privacy required to think, write, plan, and 
associate independently and without fear, social and political freedom is weakened, 
and perhaps destroyed. Information privacy is a subset of privacy. The right to 
information privacy includes both the claim that certain information should not be 
collected at all by governments or business firms, and the claim of individuals to 
control the use of whatever information is collected about them. Individual control 
over personal information is at the core of the privacy concept. Implicit in the claim 
to control one’s own personal information is the claim to be able to edit and even 
delete personal information from the Web. This is often called the “right to be forgot-
ten,” as discussed in the opening case (Rosen, 2012).
Due process also plays an important role in defining privacy. The best statement 
of due process in record keeping is given by the Fair Information Practices doctrine 
developed in the early 1970s and extended to the online privacy debate in the late 
1990s (described later in this section).
There are two kinds of threats to individual privacy posed by the Internet. One 
threat originates in the private sector and concerns how much personal information is 
collected by commercial Web sites and how it will be used. A second threat originates 
in the public sector and concerns how much personal information federal, state, and 
local government authorities collect, and how they use it. While these threats are 
conceptually distinct, in practice they are related as the federal government increas-
ingly relies on Internet companies to provide intelligence on specific individuals and 
groups, and as Internet records held by search engine companies and others (like 
Amazon) are sought by legal authorities and attornies.
In 2015, the public discussion of privacy has broadened from a concern about 
tracking the behavior of individuals while they use the Internet, especially on social 
networks, to include the impact of mobile devices for tracking the location of people 
via their smartphones, collecting information on their personal behavior including 
the shops, churches, political rallies, bars, and other locations they have visited, and 
collecting a detailed log of their phone calls (Barrett, 2015a; 2015b). There is increasing 
public attention and criticism of the entire ecosystem of data brokerage firms called 
data brokers that collect and re-sell this personal information to advertisers. These 
concerns about tracking and surveilling people throughout their daily lives have been 
heightened by the revelation that the federal government’s National Security Agency 
has been logging virtually all cell phone calls of all residents for many years. Smart-
phone apps that tap user information have also received critical attention. In addition, 
local and state law enforcement agencies have greatly expanded their surveillance 
technology and capabilities to include mass surveillance of large populations in the 
search for criminals and terrorists. The falling costs of personal tracking technology 
like mobile cameras, the ubiquitous use of always-on smartphones fitted out with 
GPS, and the growth of powerful storage and analytic capabilities, have resulted in a 
torrent of data, referred to as Big Data, pouring into marketing and law enforcement 
privacy
the moral right of indi-
viduals to be left alone, 
free from surveillance or 
interference from other 
individuals or organiza-
tions, including the state
information privacy
includes both the claim 
that certain information 
should not be collected at 
all by governments or 
business firms, and the 
claim of individuals to 
control the use of whatever 
information is collected 
about them

databases. Private and government investigations have found both Apple and Google 
are collecting personal location and behavior data, and sharing this information with 
marketers and government agencies. The cell phone carriers receive more than a 
million requests each year from law enforcement agencies for call data (Chen, 2014; 
Maass and Rajagopalen, 2012). Apart from smartphone surveillance, new wireless 
cameras mounted on cars (a kind of remote sensing device) have led to a new industry 
of license plate tracking, resulting in hundreds of millions of license plate photos col-
lected by private firms and police forces, regardless of whether or not the car’s owners 
have done anything wrong (Angwin and Valentino-Devries, 2012). Facial recognition 
technology employed by Facebook and others simply adds to public anxiety over the 
loss of personal privacy.
In general, the Internet and the Web provide an ideal environment for both busi-
ness and government to invade the personal privacy of millions of users on a scale 
unprecedented in history. Perhaps no other recent issue has raised as much wide-
spread social and political concern as protecting the privacy of Internet users.
INFORMATION COLLECTED AT E-COMMERCE SITES
As you have learned in previous chapters, e-commerce sites routinely collect a variety 
of information from or about consumers who visit their site and/or make purchases. 
Some of this data constitutes personally identifiable information (PII), which is 
defined as any data that can be used to identify, locate, or contact an individual 
(Federal Trade Commission, 2000a). Other data is anonymous information, com-
posed of demographic and behavioral information, such as age, occupation, income, 
zip code, ethnicity, and other data that characterizes your life such as Web browsing 
behavior without identifying who you are. Table 8.2 lists just a few of the personal 
identifiers routinely collected by online e-commerce sites including mobile sites and 
apps. This is not an exhaustive list, and in fact many Web sites collect hundreds of 
different data points on visitors. A study of nine data brokers identified twelve broad 
categories of information collected by brokers, and 240 data elements from address 
history, to liens and political leanings, to vehicle and travel data (Federal Trade Com-
mission, 2014).

Advertising networks and search engines also track the behavior of consumers 
across thousands of popular sites, not just at one site, via cookies, Web beacons, track-
ing software, spyware, and other techniques. For instance, simply clicking a Like 
button on a Web site enables Facebook to track your movements across the Web. 
Table 8.3 illustrates some of the major ways online firms gather information 
about consumers.

SOCIAL NETWORKS AND PRIVACY
Social networks pose a unique challenge for the maintenance of personal privacy 
because they encourage people to reveal details about their personal lives (passions, 
loves, favorites, photos, videos, and personal interests), and to share them with their 
friends. Social networks have greatly enlarged the depth, scope, and richness of infor-
mation collected by private corporations. While Google’s search engine is a massive 
database of personal intentions, Facebook has created a massive database of friends, 
preferences, Likes, posts, and activities. An Austrian researcher was able to obtain his 
Facebook file (possible under European laws) and received a 1,222-page document of 
messages, photos, posts, and friends (Sengupta, 2012). Some social networkers share 
these personal details with everyone on the social network. On the face of it, this 
would seem to indicate that people who participate in social networks voluntarily give 
up their rights to personal privacy. How could they claim an expectation of privacy? 
When everything is shared, what’s private?
But the reality is that many adult (18 or over) participants in social networks 
have a very keen sense of their personal privacy. Facebook is a prime example of 
senior management pushing the envelope of privacy, and experiencing a number of 
public relations reversals and growing government concern. For instance, Facebook 
deployed facial recognition technology without any previous notice, which compro-
mised its users’ privacy by allowing them to be tagged in photos without their consent. 
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that it is possible to identify people, even their 
social security numbers, based on a single Facebook photograph and using facial rec-
ognition programs (Angwin, 2011; Acquisti et al., 2011). After consumer uproar and 
challenges from various state attorneys general, Facebook reversed course and made 
it easier for users to opt out of the technology. In 2012, Facebook began pushing ads 
on its users based on their use of apps and offering advertisers the ability to serve 
ads to Facebook users even while not using Facebook. In 2013, Facebook announced 
a new privacy policy that it claimed clarified its use of personal information. In the 
new policy, Facebook claimed it could use any personal information for any purpose 
it wanted to. After howls of protest from users, privacy groups, and congressmen, the 
policy was temporarily withdrawn. In 2014, Facebook changed its default privacy set-
tings to reveal information only to friends, and allowed users to see some of the data 
Facebook collects about them and to edit that data. Actually performing these tasks is 
quite difficult. In early 2015, Facebook implemented new privacy policies that stipulate 
that it may share users’ personal data with partnered sites for the delivery of targeted 
ads. For a review of Facebook’s various positions on online privacy over the years, and 
public and congressional reaction to these issues, refer to the Insight on Society case, 
Facebook and the Age of Privacy, in Chapter 1.
The result of these public conflicts suggests that social network participants do 
indeed have a strong expectation of privacy in the sense that they want to control 
how “their” information is used. People who contribute user-generated content have 
a strong sense of ownership over the content that is not diminished by posting the 
information on a social network for one’s friends. As for members who post informa-
tion to everyone, not just friends, these should be seen as “public performances” where 
the contributors voluntarily publish their performances, just as writers or other artists

do. This does not mean they want the entirety of their personal lives thrown open to 
every Web tracking automaton on the Internet.
MOBILE AND LOCATION-BASED PRIVACY ISSUES
As the mobile platform becomes more and more important, issues about mobile and 
location-based privacy are also becoming a major concern. In 2012, investigators 
discovered that iOS and Android apps were funneling location information to mobile 
advertisers, along with users’ address books and photos (Bilton, 2012). As a result, Con-
gress opened an investigation into the privacy policies of smartphone manufacturers, 
along with Facebook, Pinterest, Yahoo, Google, and 30 others in the app marketplace. 
Twitter announced that anyone using its “Find Friends” feature on smartphones was 
also sending every phone number and e-mail address in their address books to the 
company (Sarno, 2012).
In 2011, a furor erupted over news that Apple iPhones and iPads and Google 
Android smartphones were able to track and store user location information. In 2012, 
Facebook launched a new mobile advertising service that tracks what apps people use 
on their smartphones, and what they do while using the apps. Apple and Google track 
users’ apps also. Apple disclosed that it can target ads based on the apps that a person 
has downloaded, while Google does not currently do this. For instance, Facebook 
can target a frequent player of a game such as Words with Friends with ads using the 
player’s Facebook News Feed, which is a major channel for Facebook ads (the other 
being display ads on the user’s page). In 2012, investigators discovered that some cell 
phone companies had installed tracking devices inside phones to improve customer 
service. This ignited a flurry of criticism. In 2015, investigators discovered that the U.S. 
Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department had developed an airborne 
fake cell tower that fools cell phones into revealing their identity and location. Called 
“Dirtboxes,” the devices are located on planes at five airports around the country and 
can surveil most of the population (Barrett, 2015c). Similar hand-held devices are 
readily available on the Internet.
In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a pathbreaking unanimous decision, 
ruled that police needed a warrant prior to searching a person’s cell phone for informa-
ton. All mobile devices will likely receive this protection against general, warrantless 
police searches (Savage, 2014). An earlier decision in 2012 requires police to obtain a 
warrant prior to attaching GPS tracking devices to a suspect’s car. In both cases, the 
Supreme Court found that cell phones held extensive detailed personal information, 
retained information for many years, and stored many different types of informa-
tion. Much of a person’s intimate and personal life can be stored on cell phones, 
making them the modern equivalent of personal papers, which are protected under 
the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which protects the “right of the people to 
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches 
and seizures.” The U.S. Senate held hearings in June 2014 on the Consumer Location 
Privacy Protection Act, which requires firms to notify cell phone users and obtain 
their consent if they want to gather location data. The FTC signed a 20-year consent 
order with Snapchat after discovering the app was collecting location data contrary to 
Snapchat’s own privacy policy. However, while searching a cell phone for information

may require a warrant, using a person’s cell phone to establish identity or location 
does not require a warrant.
A backlash against the privacy-invading practices of Internet firms and the online 
advertising industry is gaining momentum, as reflected in opinion polls. Both attitudes 
and behavior are changing. Americans have strong feelings about privacy. In a recent 
survey, over 90% said being in control of who can get personal information, and 
controlling what information is collected, is “very important.” Almost 90% said it is 
important that others not watch or listen to them without permission. Around 94% of 
Americans do not believe government agencies, business firms, or other institutions 
can keep their information private and secure (Pew Research, 2015). While 10% or 
fewer have taken advanced steps, such as encrypting their communications or using 
proxy servers to protect their privacy, about 25% or more have used false names, used 
a temporary e-mail address, or decided not to use a website because it asked for their 
real name. An estimated 25% of Internet users have ad blocking software (Sloane, 
2015) (see Table 8.4). Next to hackers, Americans try to avoid advertisers pursuing 
them while online, and 59% block cookies to make tracking more difficult. Refer to 
the Insight on Society case, Foursquare: Check Your Privacy at the Door, in Chapter 5, 
for more discussion of some of the issues associated with mobile and location-based 
privacy. The Insight on Technology case: Apple: Champion of Privacy? discusses the dif-
ferences in Apple’s and Google’s approach to privacy in the context of new assistant 
technology now embedded in their respective smartphones.
PROFILING AND BEHAVIORAL TARGETING
On an average day, billions of people around the world go online. Marketers would 
like to know who these people are, what they are interested in, and what they buy.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
APPLE: CHAMPION OF PRIVACY?
In June 2015, Tim Cook, CEO of 
Apple, the world’s most valuable 
corporation, gave a most unusual 
speech for a Silicon Valley executive. 
Cook attacked other Internet giants 
like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Micro-
soft for invading their customers’ privacy. Apple, 
he said, rejects the idea that customers have to 
make a trade-off between privacy and security. 
Cook believes people have a fundamental right 
to privacy. Some of the most prominent firms in 
Silicon Valley, Cook argued, lull their customers 
into giving up a treasure of personal information 
in order to receive some service, like cloud storage, 
social networking, or photo services for “free.” 
In fact, Cook argued, the trade-off comes at a 
high cost to the consumer in the form of the loss 
of privacy and fear about what might become of 
their personal information. In the end, he said, 
consumers will regret the trade. These companies, 
he noted, are gobbling up everything they can 
learn about consumers and trying to monetize it 
by selling it to advertisers. Cook’s strong state-
ments on the importance of privacy are contrary 
to the views of Mark Zuckerberg, founder and 
CEO of Facebook, most famously summarized in 
his January 2011 interview arguing that the age 
of privacy is over (see the Chapter 1 Insight on 
Society case, Facebook and the Age of Privacy). 
The Internet privacy debate has long cen-
tered on what information advertisers have about 
us, how they track people, build profiles, follow 
us around the Web to retarget ads, and make it 
impossible to figure out what they do with our 
personal information, or to do anything about it. 
The latest polls on consumer attitudes found that 
people don’t want to give up their privacy and 
personal information, but have become resigned 
to the situation. They are sharing data, but aren’t 
happy about it. For ordinary people, the privacy 
issue is not resolved. The Age of Privacy has not 
ended in the minds of consumers. 
But the privacy issue is about to be given a 
new twist: the evolving technology of personal 
assistants, built on the latest technology of speech 
recognition, predictive analytics, and ever faster 
processors and Internet connections, is behind a 
new marketing push for Apple iPhones, Android 
phones, and Microsoft PC and laptop software. 
These personal assistants are not advertising vehi-
cles, but rather seek to extend the functionality 
of mobile devices to a new level in which smart-
phones and tablets play an even greater role in 
consumers’ lives than they do now (if that is imag-
inable!). The objective is to monitor user activity, 
use that information to predict future behavior, 
and then make recommendations and supply infor-
mation even before users ask for it. 
Apple, of course, already has Siri, but with 
iOS9, Apple introduced Proactive assistant tech-
nology. Google has developed Google Now. Micro-
soft has introduced Cortana to all its devices. All 
these new assistants aim to anticipate what users 
want, and when they want it. For Apple, Google, 
and Microsoft, the assistant-space is turning out to 
be a major battleground for market share. What’s 
at stake for Apple is more useful services and a 
better customer experience that will drive sales of 
it iPhones and tablets. For Google, it’s all about 
collecting information for its advertisers by build-
ing attractive, useful services for free. For Micro-
soft, likewise, a really useful Cortana means more 
hardware with Windows OS and more software 
can be sold. A lot is at stake. 
While they share objectives, the way each firm 
goes about collecting the information has impor-
tant implications for privacy, and whether users 
will really want these assistants to know so much. 
The nice thing about human assistants is that you 
can tell them to stay out of certain areas of your

life that are private, just for you, and trusted 
others. Not so with computer-based assistants. 
Apple’s Proactive assistant technology 
aims to collect data on personal behavior from 
the iPhone itself and do most of the processing on 
the user’s phone. It will collect, for instance, data 
on which apps you use, where you are, who you 
talk or text with, and has some limited access to 
e-mails, using them to identify callers and create 
calendar events. Using this information, Siri can 
remind you to call people on their birthday or 
about meetings, inform you about local businesses, 
and even find a gas station close to the car rental 
office at the airport. Listen to music when you 
exercise in the morning? Siri will start playing 
your favorite songs without asking. 
When it needs to connect to Apple Web 
servers to, say, let you know there’s traffic ahead 
that may interfere with your doctor’s appointment, 
Apple assigns a random number to your phone, 
so Apple servers do not know your identity. Your 
phone will know your health information, but 
Apple servers will not. Apple makes a distinction 
between what your phone knows and what the 
company knows. Although the phone may know a 
lot, Apple is trying to minimize how much infor-
mation it itself knows about its users! 
Google’s approach is, well, so like Google. 
Google Now aggregates information from Web 
searches and browsing history, use of other 
Google services like Google Docs, Gmail, calendar, 
YouTube, as well as data from the phone such as 
position, time, app use, and who you communicate 
with using any phone media. In other words, just 
about all the data you generate in the process of 
using the Internet. All this information is stored 
and processed on Google’s cloud servers, which 
could be anywhere in the United States, Europe, or 
elsewhere. Google says it will not sell this informa-
tion to others, but it will use this information to 
target ads to users. A subtle distinction: Google 
is not selling data, it’s selling access to millions 
of individuals’ screens and it knows a great deal 
about all of them, perhaps all there is to know 
about many of its users. 
Some believe that Google’s more comprehen-
sive approach, while more invasive, will produce 
a better assistant than what Apple can provide 
using Proactive assistant technology. Google Now 
just knows so much more about you. Google plans 
to introduce a new feature called Google Now on 
Tap that can understand what users are doing 
inside apps, and possibly make suggestions about 
the next step to take in a game. Google Now can 
display information about local movies and restau-
rants, movies playing nearby, and remind you that 
your boss sent an e-mail asking for a spreadsheet 
by Friday afternoon. Apple’s Proactive assistant 
technology will not be reading your email. Google 
has been reading user email since Gmail was intro-
duced in 2004. 
Apple is making a bet that its privacy regard-
ing assistant technology will be a popular feature 
at a time in history when public concerns about 
privacy, invasion of privacy by business and gov-
ernment, and the lack of Internet security are 
growing, not receding. Google is making a dif-
ferent bet: consumers are primarily interested in 
utility, functionality, and power, for which they will 
exchange their privacy.

The more precise the information, the more complete the information, and the more 
valuable it is as a predictive and marketing tool. Armed with this information, market-
ers can make their ad campaigns more efficient by targeting specific ads at specific 
groups or individuals, and they can even adjust the ads for specific groups.
Many Web sites allow third parties—including online advertising networks such 
as Microsoft Advertising, DoubleClick, and others—to place “third-party” cookies and 
Web tracking software on a visitor’s computer in order to engage in profiling the user’s 
behavior across thousands of Web sites. A third-party cookie is used to track users 
across hundreds or thousands of other Web sites who are members of the advertising 
network. Profiling is the creation of digital images that characterize online individual 
and group behavior. Anonymous profiles identify people as belonging to highly 
specific and targeted groups, for example, 20- to 30-year-old males, with college degrees 
and incomes greater than €40,000 a year, and interested in high-fashion clothing (based 
on recent search engine use). Personal profiles add a personal e-mail address, postal 
address, and/or phone number to behavioral data. Increasingly, online firms are 
linking their online profiles to personal offline consumer data collected by database 
firms tracking credit card purchases, as well as established retail and catalog firms.
The online advertising networks have added several new dimensions to estab-
lished offline marketing techniques. First, they have the ability to precisely track not 
just consumer purchases, but all browsing behavior on the Web at thousands of the 
most popular member sites, including browsing book lists, filling out preference forms, 
and viewing content pages. Second, they can dynamically adjust what the shopper 
sees on screen—including prices. Third, they can build and continually refresh high-
resolution data images or behavioral profiles of consumers. Other advertising firms 
have created spyware software that, when placed on a consumer’s computer, can 
report back to the advertiser’s server on all consumer Internet use, and is also used 
to display advertising on the consumer’s computer. Most personal computers have 
hundreds of these programs installed without user consent or understanding.
A different kind of profiling and a more recent form of behavioral targeting is 
Google’s results-based personalization of advertising. Google has a patent on a program 
that allows advertisers using Google’s AdWords program to target ads to users based 
on their prior search histories and profiles, which Google constructs based on user 
searches, along with any other information the user submits to Google or that Google 
can obtain, such as age, demographics, region, and other Web activities (such as blog-
ging). Google also has a second patent on a program that allows Google to help adver-
tisers select keywords and design ads for various market segments based on search 
histories, such as helping a clothing Web site create and test ads targeted at teenage 
females. Google uses behavioral targeting to help it display more relevant ads based 
on keywords. According to Google, the feature is aimed at capturing a more robust 
understanding of user intent, and thereby delivering a better ad. Google’s Gmail, a 
free e-mail service, offers a powerful interface, and gigabytes of free storage. In return, 
Google computers read all incoming and outgoing e-mail and place “relevant” adver-
tising in the margins of the mail. Profiles are developed on individual users based on 
the content in their e-mail.

Both American and European regulators have objected to Google’s policy of inte-
grating personal information from all of its services into a single personal profile, 
and second, failing to let users know what it is doing with their personal information 
(Charlton, 2013). Google claims that people who send mail to a friend’s Gmail account 
do not have an expectation of privacy, and that anyone who sends information to a 
third party does not have an expectation of privacy. Privacy groups expressed concerns 
when Google announced in 2014 that it was purchasing Nest, the maker of digital home 
thermostats and smoke detection devices that are connected to the Internet. Although 
Nest says it is run separately from Google and that Nest accounts are not cross-linked 
with Google accounts, Nest admits that it does share personal information with Google 
when connected to Google’s “Works with Nest integration” system (Gibbs, 2015). 
Facial recognition tools add a new dimension to profiling and behavioral target-
ing. In 2014, several uses of facial recognition are already commonplace. Facebook 
and Google+ use the software to automatically suggest name tags for members or 
their friends in photographs. The technology is evolving rapidly: Google has applied 
for a patent to identify faces in online videos, and Facebook has developed a highly 
accurate facial recognition system called DeepFace (Singer, 2014a). It is difficult for 
people to detect if they are being stalked or followed by persons using facial recogni-
tion technology, and currently there are no controls over its use.
Deep packet inspection is another technology for recording every keystroke at 
the ISP level of every Internet user (no matter where they ultimately go on the Web), 
and then using that information to make suggestions, and target ads. While advertising 
networks are limited, and even Google does not constitute the universe of search, 
deep packet inspection at the ISP level really does capture the universe of all Internet 
users. In 2014, deep packet inspection is not used in the United States by advertising 
firms because it is likely a violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 
1986. However, it is used as a network management and law enforcement tool (Kuehn 
and Mueller, 2012).
Network advertising firms argue that Web profiling benefits both consumers and 
businesses. Profiling permits targeting of ads, ensuring that consumers see advertise-
ments mostly for products and services in which they are actually interested. Businesses 
benefit by not paying for wasted advertising sent to consumers who have no interest 
in their product or service. The industry argues that by increasing the effectiveness of 
advertising, more advertising revenues go to the Internet, which in turn subsidizes free 
content on the Internet. Last, product designers and entrepreneurs benefit by sensing 
demand for new products and services by examining user searches and profiles.
Critics argue that profiling undermines the expectation of anonymity and privacy 
that most people have when using the Internet, and changes what should be a private 
experience into one where an individual’s every move is recorded. As people become 
aware that their every move is being watched, they will be far less likely to explore 
sensitive topics, browse pages, or read about controversial issues. How can people expe-
rience freedom if they believe their every move on the Internet is being watched? In 
most cases, the profiling is invisible to users, and even hidden. Consumers are not noti-
fied that profiling is occurring. Profiling permits data aggregation on hundreds or even 
thousands of unrelated sites on the Web. Critics debate the economic benefits of profil-

ing because it allows firms to engage in price discrimination, charging more for goods 
based on, for instance, zip code, gender, and ethnicity (Singer, 2015). The cookies placed 
by ad networks are persistent, and they can be set to last days, months, years, or even 
forever. Their tracking occurs over an extended period of time and resumes each time 
the individual logs on to the Internet. This clickstream data is used to create profiles 
that can include hundreds of distinct data fields for each consumer. Associating so-called 
anonymous profiles with personal information is fairly easy, and companies can change 
policies quickly without informing the consumer. Although the information gathered 
by network advertisers is often anonymous (non-PII data), in many cases, the profiles 
derived from tracking consumers’ activities on the Web are linked or merged with per-
sonally identifiable information. Anonymous behavioral data is far more valuable if it 
can be linked with offline consumer behavior, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses.
THE INTERNET AND GOVERNMENT INVASIONS OF PRIVACY: E-COMMERCE 
SURVEILLANCE
Today, the online and mobile behavior, profiles, and transactions of consumers are 
routinely available to a wide range of government agencies and law enforcement 
authorities, contributing to rising fears among online consumers, and in some cases, 
their withdrawal from the online marketplace. The last few years have not been good 
for advocates of privacy, with revelations that U.S. federal government agencies have 
been routinely gathering cell phone call data on Americans and foreigners in the 
United States for a period of several years with scant judicial oversight. In June 2013, 
Edward Snowden, a security contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), began 
releasing NSA documents to The Guardian, a U.K. newspaper, providing a detailed 
description of NSA surveillance programs of both U.S. and foreign citizens. These pro-
grams were unprecedented in scope and involved wholesale collection of cell phone 
metadata around the world, tapping communications lines of Google, Yahoo, and 
other Internet services, and tapping cell phones of foreign leaders. The NSA enlisted 
the support of the major telecommunications carriers to give it information about 
Americans’ phone calls and e-mail in a program called Prism. These programs were 
conceived in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the United States on September 
11, 2001, and were envisaged as necessary to protect the country. The programs were 
authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and subsequent amendments, and were 
reviewed by relevant Congressional committees. Many in the computer science aca-
demic community were aware of these programs, in part because they participated in 
the development of techniques for discovering patterns in large data sets, as well as 
so-called machine learning programs. Nevertheless, the revelations alarmed average 
citizens who previously believed that if they did nothing wrong, surely the govern-
ment would not be collecting information about them. The revelations also heightened 
public awareness and criticism of Internet firms like Google and Facebook, and others 
engaging in extensive tracking and consumer surveillance. Google, Facebook, Micro-
soft, and others have since tried to resist or prevent warrantless government access 
to their consumer data (Apuzzo et al., 2015).
Advances in technology for storing, processing, and analyzing unimaginable quan-
tities of personal data, referred to as Big Data and business analytics (data mining and 

552	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
representation software), have further heightened perceptions that privacy is increas-
ingly difficult to define and protect in the age of e-commerce and social networks 
(Kakutani, 2013; Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier, 2013). 
Striking a balance between security and liberty is at the center of the privacy debate 
(Ford, 2013). While the Internet used to be thought of as impossible for governments to 
control or monitor, nothing could be actually further from the truth. Law enforcement 
authorities have long claimed the right under numerous statutes to monitor any form 
of electronic communication pursuant to a court order and judicial review and based on 
the reasonable belief that a crime is being committed. This includes the surveillance of 
consumers engaged in e-commerce. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforce-
ment Act (CALEA), the USA PATRIOT Act, the Cyber Security Enhancement Act, and 
the Homeland Security Act all strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies to 
monitor Internet users without their knowledge and, under certain circumstances when 
life is purportedly at stake, without judicial oversight. The USA PATRIOT Act, designed 
to combat terrorism inside the borders of the United States, permits nearly unlimited 
government surveillance without court oversight, according to several senators (Savage, 
2012). However, in June 2015, several provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act expired. In 
response, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which imposes some limits on the 
bulk collection by the National Security Agency and other U.S. intelligence agencies of 
U.S. citizens’ telecommunications metadata.
Previously, in May 2014, the Obama administration had released a report, Big 
Data: Seizing Opportunities and Preserving Values, that focused on the role of technol-
ogy, including e-commerce and mobile phones, in expanding the amount and depth of 
information available and collected on citizens. A supporting report of the President’s 
Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) was also released, calling for 
a consumer privacy bill of rights, a data breach law requiring firms to report losses 
of consumer data, extension of these privacy rights to non-citizens, use of technolo-
gies to enhance privacy, restriction of the use of data that might cause discrimination 
against various groups in America, and the amendment of the Electronic Communi-
cations Privacy Act to strengthen protections against government surveillance of the 
sort uncovered by Snowden (Executive Office of the President, 2014; PCAST, 2014). In 
February 2015, the White House issued a draft Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights Act. 
The draft bill lays out a number of privacy and security requirements for companies 
that collect consumer data. Firms would be required to disclose their privacy and data 
use policies in plain language, inform consumers about what data is collected, and 
provide consumers with greater control over the use of their personal data. Privacy 
policies would be reviewed and monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, which 
would have rule-making authority over firms’ policies and behavior (Rosenfeld and 
Hutnick, 2015). The draft has been widely criticized for not going beyond existing laws 
and practices and for relying on vague criteria, such as “reasonableness” and “context” 
in data collection and use. The FTC itself has also objected to the proposal. 
Other initiatives in the 2015 U.S. Congress in this area include the Email Privacy Act, 
which regulates email providers; the Preserving American Privacy Act, which regulates 
the collection of information by drones; and the Online Communications and Geoloca-
tion Protection Act, which regulates the uses of personal geo-location data. However, at 
this time, it is not likely that any of these proposed bills will be enacted by Congress.

Taking matters into its own hands, in September 2014, Apple introduced the 
iPhone 6, which offers the ability for users to encrypt e-mail, photos, and contacts 
stored on the phone using a strong encryption algorithm. The data can only be 
decrypted by using a passcode that only the user possesses, and Apple does not retain 
the key to the code. As a result, the NSA will no longer be able to force Apple and 
Google to reveal such user data. In September 2015, Apple said it could not comply 
with a court order to turn over text messages in real time involving an investigation 
of drug and gun runners. In 2013, Microsoft refused to turn over e-mails from a drug 
trafficking suspect, saying the records were stored in Ireland (Apuzzo et al., 2015). 
Not surprisingly, the NSA and law enforcement officials are not happy with this pros-
pect and fear that it will enable criminals and terrorists to evade surveillance. Apple 
and Google contend that in order for them to compete globally, they must be able to 
convince consumers that their data is secure, a task made more difficult as a result of 
the Snowden revelations (Sanger and Chen, 2014).
Government agencies are among the largest users of private sector commercial 
data brokers, such as Acxiom, Experian, and TransUnion Corporation, that collect a vast 
amount of information about consumers from various offline and online public sources, 
such as public records and the telephone directory, and non-public sources, such as 
“credit header” information from credit bureaus (which typically contains name, aliases, 
birth date, social security number, current and prior addresses, and phone numbers). 
Acxiom is the largest private personal database in the world with records on more 
than 500,000 people and about 1,500 data points per person (Singer, 2012). Information 
contained in individual reference services’ databases ranges from purely identifying 
information (e.g., name and phone number) to much more extensive data (e.g., driving 
records, criminal and civil court records, property records, and licensing records). This 
information can be linked to online behavior information collected from other commer-
cial sources to compile an extensive profile of an individual’s online and offline behavior.
When you use a search engine, the IP address of your computer is typically recorded, 
and cookies are placed on your browser to record the search terms of the current session, 
time of visit, and links you actually chose. This information is stored in a database where 
it can be related to previous searches and other personal identifiers that the search engine 
may have gleaned from those previous searches. Search engine data provides a compre-
hensive picture of a person’s intentions and actions on the Internet. The amount of time 
such data is retained is not governed by U.S. law, but the European Union has indicated 
that it should not be retained for more than six months. The three major search engines 
(Google, Bing, and Yahoo) have varying policies. Recent research has found that the claim 
that retaining search data for longer periods, such as 18 months, improves the accuracy 
of searches is not supported by empirical data (Chiou and Tucker, 2014).
LEGAL PROTECTIONS
In the United States, Canada, and Germany, rights to privacy are explicitly granted in, 
or can be derived from, founding documents such as constitutions, as well as in specific 
statutes. In England and the United States, there is also protection of privacy in the 
common law, a body of court decisions involving torts or personal injuries. For instance, 
in the United States, four privacy-related torts have been defined in court decisions 

554	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
involving claims of injury to individuals caused by other private parties: intrusion on 
solitude, public disclosure of private facts, publicity placing a person in a false light, 
and appropriation of a person’s name or likeness (mostly concerning celebrities) for a 
commercial purpose (Laudon, 1996). In the United States, the claim to privacy against 
government intrusion is protected primarily by the First Amendment guarantees of 
freedom of speech and association, the Fourth Amendment protections against unrea-
sonable search and seizure of one’s personal documents or home, and the Fourteenth 
Amendment’s guarantee of due process. It’s important to remember that these protec-
tions apply to government intrusions of privacy, not private firms’ intrusions.
In addition to common law and the Constitution, there are both federal laws and 
state laws that protect individuals against government intrusion and in some cases 
define privacy rights vis-à-vis private organizations such as financial, educational, and 
media institutions (cable television and video rentals) (see Table 8.5).
Informed Consent and Notice
One conceptual basis of American privacy law is notification and consent. It is assumed 
that consumers can read Terms of Use notices (or privacy policies) concerning how a 
Web site will use their personal information, and then make a rational choice to either 
consent to the terms of use, opt out of the data collection (if that is an option), or stop 
using the site. The concept of informed consent (defined as consent given with knowl-
edge of all material facts needed to make a rational decision) also plays an important role 
in protecting privacy. In the United States, business firms can gather transaction informa-
tion generated in the marketplace and then use that information for other purposes, 
without obtaining the explicit affirmative informed consent of the individual. For instance, 
in the United States, if a shopper purchases books about baseball from an e-commerce 
company that participates in an advertising network such as DoubleClick, a cookie can 
be placed on the consumer’s hard drive and used by other member companies to sell the 
shopper sports clothing without the explicit permission or even knowledge of the user. 
This online preference information may also be linked with personally identifying infor-
mation. In Europe, this would be illegal. A business in Europe cannot use marketplace 
transaction information for any purpose other than supporting the current transaction, 
unless it obtains the individual’s consent in writing or by filling out an on-screen form.
There are traditionally two models for informed consent: opt-in and opt-out. The 
opt-in model requires an affirmative action by the consumer to allow collection and 
use of information. For instance, using opt-in, consumers would first be asked if they 
approved of the collection and use of information, and then directed to check a selection 
box if they agreed. Otherwise, the default is not to approve the collection of data. In the 
opt-out model, the default is to collect information unless the consumer takes an affir-
mative action to prevent the collection of data by checking a box or by filling out a form.
Until recently, many U.S. e-commerce companies rejected the concept of informed 
consent and instead simply published their information use policy on their site. Nearly 
all Web sites have Terms of Use policies that users can find if they look carefully. 
These Terms of Use policies are sometimes called privacy policies, and they describe 
how the firms will use information collected on their sites. These policies are notices, 
and as noted above, it is assumed that anyone who uses the site has implicitly agreed 
informed consent

edge of all material facts

decision

S E L E C T E D  S TAT E  P R I V A C Y  L A W S
Online privacy policies
The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 was the first state law in the United States 
requiring owners of commercial Web sites or online services to post a privacy policy. The policy 
must, among other things, identify the categories of PII collected about site visitors and 
categories of third parties with whom the information may be shared. Failure to comply can 
result in a civil suit for unfair business practices. Nebraska and Pennsylvania prohibit false and 
misleading statements in online privacy policies. At least 16 states require government Web 
sites to establish privacy policies or procedures or incorporate machine-readable privacy 
policies into their Web sites.
Spyware legislation
A number of states, including California, Utah, Arizona, Arkansas, and Virginia, among others, 
have passed laws that outlaw the installation of spyware on a user’s computer without 
consent.
Disclosure of security 
breaches
In 2002, California enacted legislation that requires state agencies or businesses that own or 
license computer data with personal information to notify state residents if they experience a 
security breach involving that information; today, nearly every state has enacted similar 
legislation. 
Privacy of personal 
information
Two states, Nevada and Minnesota, require ISPs to keep their customers’ PII private unless the 
customer consents to disclose the information. Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission 
from subscribers before disclosing information about subscribers’ online surfing habits.
Data encryption
In October 2007, Nevada passed the first law that requires encryption for the transmission of 
customer personal information. The law took effect October 1, 2008.
to the Terms of Use policy. A recent study reviewed 30 popular social network and 
community sites and found that it would take the average reader about eight hours 
to simply read the policy. The longest policy was SoundCloud’s, with 7,961 words. 
Obviously a critical flaw with informed consent as the basis of privacy protections 
is that it assumes the average user can understand what privacy they may be giving 
up by using a site (Singer, 2014b; Fiesler and Bruckman, 2014). For instance, Yahoo’s 
privacy policy begins by stating that Yahoo takes the user’s privacy seriously and 
Yahoo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about users with others or 
non-affiliated companies. However, there are a number of exceptions that significantly 
weaken this statement. For instance, Yahoo may share the information with “trusted 
partners,” which could be anyone that Yahoo does business with, although perhaps 
not a company that the user might choose to do business with. In its privacy policy, 
Yahoo also says it uses cookies, device identifiers, and Web beacons in order to track 
user clickstream behavior across the Web. To opt-out of interest-based advertising, 
a user must sign into his or her Yahoo account and allow cookies from Yahoo. U.S. 
businesses argue that informing consumers about how the information will be used 
is sufficient to obtain the users’ informed consent. Privacy advocates argue that many 
Terms of Use/privacy policy statements on U.S. Web sites are obscure and difficult 
to read, and legitimate just about any use of personal information. For instance, in 
2014, a furor erupted when it was revealed that both Facebook and OKCupid (a dating 
site) had conducted undisclosed social experiments involving user behavior on their

sites. Facebook secretly manipulated the News Feeds of almost 700,000 users to see if 
negative posts on users’ News Feeds made them more likely to make negative posts 
as well. Facebook claimed that such research was covered by its Terms of Use; critics 
argued that conducting such research without explicit informed consent is both unethi-
cal and illegal (Storm, 2014). In the United States, most e-commerce companies that 
offer informed consent use the opt-out model. Unless the consumer checks a box to 
specifically decline, information is collected. Often, the selection box is at the very 
bottom of the Web page, where the consumer is unlikely to see it, or located within 
complex menus.
The Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices Principles
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken the lead in con-
ducting research on online privacy and recommending legislation to Congress. The 
FTC is a cabinet-level agency charged with promoting the efficient functioning of the 
marketplace by protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive practices and increas-
ing consumer choice by promoting competition. In addition to reports and recom-
mendations, the FTC enforces existing legislation by suing corporations it believes 
are in violation of federal fair trade laws.
In 1998, the FTC issued its Fair Information Practice (FIP) principles, on which 
it has based its assessments and recommendations for online privacy. FIP principles 
are still the primary basis for privacy legislation. Table 8.6 describes these principles. 
Two of the five are designated as basic, “core” principles that must be present to protect 
privacy, whereas the other practices are less central. The FTC’s FIP principles restate 
and strengthen in a form suitable to deal with online privacy the Fair Information 
Practices doctrine developed in 1973 by a government study group (U.S. Department 
of Health, Education and Welfare, 1973).
Notice/Awareness 
(core principle)
Sites must disclose their information practices before collecting data. 
Includes identification of collector, uses of data, other recipients of data, 
nature of collection (active/inactive), voluntary or required, consequences of 
refusal, and steps taken to protect confidentiality, integrity, and quality of 
the data.
Choice/Consent 
(core principle)
There must be a choice regime in place allowing consumers to choose how 
their information will be used for secondary purposes other than supporting 
the transaction, including internal use and transfer to third parties. Opt-in/
opt-out must be available.
Access/
Participation
Consumers should be able to review and contest the accuracy and 
completeness of data collected about them in a timely, inexpensive process.
Security
Data collectors must take reasonable steps to assure that consumer 
information is accurate and secure from unauthorized use.
Enforcement
There must be a mechanism to enforce FIP principles in place. This can 
involve self-regulation, legislation giving consumers legal remedies for 
violations, or federal statutes and regulation.

The FTC’s FIP principles set the ground rules for what constitutes due process 
privacy protection procedures at e-commerce and all other Web sites—including gov-
ernment and nonprofit Web sites—in the United States.
The FTC’s FIP principles are guidelines, not laws. They have stimulated private 
firms and industry associations to develop their own private guidelines (discussed 
next). However, the FTC’s FIP guidelines are often used as the basis of legislation. The 
most important online privacy legislation to date that has been directly influenced 
by the FTC’s FIP principles is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
(1998), which requires Web sites to obtain parental permission before collecting infor-
mation on children under 13 years of age.
In 2000, the FTC recommended legislation to Congress to protect online consumer 
privacy from the threat posed by advertising networks. Table 8.7 summarizes the 
commission’s recommendations. The FTC profiling recommendations significantly 
strengthened the FIP principles of notification and choice, while also including restric-
tions on information that may be collected.1 Although the FTC supported industry 
efforts at self-regulation, it nevertheless recommended legislation to ensure that all 
Web sites using network advertising and all network advertisers complied.
In the last decade, the FTC has broadened its approach to privacy beyond notice 
and choice requirements to include a harm-based approach, focusing on practices that 
are likely to cause harm or unwarranted intrusion in consumers’ daily lives. However, 
in recent years, the FTC has recognized the limitations of both the notice-and-choice 
and harm-based models. In 2009, the FTC held a series of three public roundtables 
1	Much general privacy legislation affecting government, e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974, precludes 
the government from collecting information on political and social behavior of citizens. The FTC 
restrictions are significant because they are the FTC’s first effort at limiting the collection of certain 
information.

to explore the effectiveness of these approaches in light of rapidly evolving technol-
ogy and the market for consumer data. The major concepts that emerged from these 
roundtables were:
•	 The increasing collection and use of consumer data
•	 Consumers’ lack of understanding about the collection and use of their personal 
data, and the resulting inability to make informed choices
•	 Consumers’ interest in and concern about their privacy
•	 Benefits of data collection and use to both businesses and consumers
•	 Decreasing relevance of the distinction between PII and non-PII.
As a result of the roundtables, the FTC developed a new framework to address 
consumer privacy. Table 8.8 summarizes the important aspects of this framework. 
	
TABLE 8.8	
THE FTC’S NEW PRIVACY FRAMEWORK
P R I N C I P L E
A P P L I C A T I O N
Scope
Applies to all commercial entities that collect or use consumer data; not 
limited to those that just collect PII.
Privacy by Design
Companies should promote consumer privacy throughout the organization 
and at every stage of development of products and services:
•	 Data security
•	 Reasonable collection limits
•	 Reasonable and appropriate data retention policies
•	 Data accuracy
•	 Comprehensive data management procedures
Simplified Choice
Companies should simplify consumer choice. Need not provide choice 
before collecting and using data for commonly accepted practices:
•	 Product and fulfillment
•	 Internal operations, fraud prevention
•	 Legal compliance
•	 First-party marketing
For all other commercial data collection and use, choice is required, and 
should be clearly and conspicuously offered at a time and in context in 
which consumer is providing data.
Some types of information or practices (children, financial and medical 
information, deep packet inspection) may require additional protection 
through enhanced consent.
Special choice mechanism for online behavioral advertising: “Do Not 
Track.”
Greater 
Transparency
Increase transparency of data practices by:
•	 Making privacy notices clearer, shorter, and more standardized to enable 
better comprehension and comparison
•	 Providing consumers with reasonable access to data about themselves
•	 Providing prominent disclosures and obtaining express affirmative consent 
before using consumer data in a materially different manner than claimed 
when data was collected
•	 Educating consumers about commercial data privacy practices

Among the most noteworthy is the call for a “Do Not Track” mechanism for online 
behavioral advertising. The mechanism would involve placing a persistent cookie on 
a consumer’s browser and conveying its setting to sites that the browser visits to signal 
whether or not the consumer wants to be tracked or receive targeted advertisements. 
A number of bills have been introduced in Congress to implement Do Not Track, but 
as yet none have been passed.
In response to growing public and congressional concern with online and mobile 
privacy violations, the FTC has begun taking a much more aggressive stance based 
on its new privacy policies developed over several years. In 2011, the FTC reached an 
agreement with Google concerning charges it used deceptive tactics and violated its 
own privacy policies when it launched its Google Buzz social network, forcing people 
to join the network even if they selected not to join. Under the settlement, Google 
agreed to start a privacy program, permit independent privacy audits for 20 years, 
and face $16,000 fines for every future privacy misrepresentation. This was the first 
time the FTC had charged a company with such violations and ordered it to start a 
privacy program (Federal Trade Commission, 2011). In 2012, the FTC fined Google 
$22.5 million for violating the agreement and for bypassing privacy settings in Apple’s 
Safari browser in order to track users and show them advertisements. This fine—its 
largest civil penalty to date—followed on the heels of a concerted crackdown on tech 
companies for privacy violations and a separate investigation of Google for antitrust 
violations (Federal Trade Commission, 2012a). In 2012, the FTC also reached a settle-
ment with Facebook resolving charges that Facebook deceived its users by telling 
them they could keep their information on Facebook private, but then repeatedly 
allowing it to be shared and made public. The settlement requires Facebook to live up 
to its promises by giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining their 
express consent before sharing their information beyond the user’s privacy settings. 
It also requires Facebook to develop a comprehensive privacy program, and obtain 
independent biennial privacy audits for a period of 20 years (Federal Trade Commis-
sion, 2012b).
In 2012, the FTC released a final report based on its work in the previous two 
years. The report describes industry best practices for protecting the privacy of Ameri-
cans and focuses on five areas: Do Not Track, mobile privacy, data brokers, large 
platform providers (advertising networks, operating systems, browsers, and social 
media companies), and the development of self-regulatory codes. The report called 
for implementation of an easy to use, persistent, and effective Do Not Track system; 
improved disclosures for use of mobile data; making it easier for people to see the files 
about themselves compiled by data brokers; development of a central Web site where 
data brokers identify themselves; development of a privacy policy by large platform 
providers to regulate comprehensive tracking across the Internet; and enforcement 
of self-regulatory rules to ensure firms adhere to industry codes of conduct (Federal 
Trade Commission, 2012c).
In 2014, the FTC issued a report on the data broker industry, which is at the heart 
of the online and offline privacy debate in the United States. The report found that 
data brokers operate without transparency, and most users have no idea how their 
information is being used. The report found that data brokers collect and store billions 

	
P r i v a c y  a n d  I n f o r m a t i o n  R i g h t s 	

561
of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer. One of the nine data brokers 
studied had information on more than 1.4 billion consumer transactions and 700 
billion data elements. Another broker adds more than 3 billion new data points to its 
database each month. The report called for legislation giving consumers more control 
over their personal information by creating a centralized portal where data brokers 
would identify themselves, describe their information collection and use practices, and 
provide links to access tools and opt-outs; require brokers to give consumers access 
to their data; provide opportunities to opt-out of data collection; describe where they 
get information and what inferences they make from the data; and require retailers 
to notify customers when they share information with data brokers (Federal Trade 
Commission, 2014). The emphasis in recent FTC privacy reports is not on restricting 
the collection of information (as in previous eras of privacy regulation), but instead 
on giving consumers rights with respect to the information collected about them in 
large databases and its use by various businesses and agencies.
Facing fines, congressional investigations, and public embarrassment over their 
privacy invading behaviors, with the potential loss of some business and credibility, 
the major players in the e-commerce industry in the United States are beginning to 
change some of their policies regarding the treatment of consumer data. Large Inter-
net firms that rely on personal information (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many 
others), along with privacy advocates, are calling on Washington to develop compre-
hensive consumer privacy protection legislation that would clarify for consumers and 
business firms the meaning of privacy in the current online commercial environment 
(Singer, 2013). This represents a change in the meaning of privacy from “leave me 
alone” to “I want to know and control how my personal information is being used.” 
Invoking a Bill of Rights perspective is shifting the privacy debate toward a rights-based 
privacy policy, similar to the European model described below.
Measuring Privacy Policies Over Time 
While politicians, privacy advocates, and the Internet industry wrangle over what 
the rules for privacy should be, very little attention has been paid to actually mea-
suring the strength of privacy policies for individual companies, comparing them to 
other companies, and understanding how privacy policies have changed over time 
at a specific company. Is Facebook’s privacy policy worse, better, or about the same 
as Apple’s, or Google’s? Have privacy policies improved after ten years of debate, or 
have they deteriorated? 
A recent research project provides some preliminary answers to these questions. 
The researchers developed a measure of privacy policies by applying 10 privacy policy 
principles when reviewing policies (see Table 8.9) (Shore and Steinmen, 2015). You 
will recognize these principles because they derive in primary part from the FTC and 
Fair Information Practices doctrines previously described. The dimensions themselves 
were measured on a four-point scale from 0 to 4 (0 meaning the privacy policy fails to 
meet the criterion and 4 indicating the criterion was fully achieved). 
You can use the principles in Table 8.9 as a way to measure the privacy policy of 
your own online business, or another firm like Facebook, or Google. You can measure 
a single firm at two points in time to see how its policies changed, or compare two or 

562	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
more firms at a single point in time. Shore and Steinman chose to look at Facebook’s 
privacy policies over a ten-year period from 2005 to 2015. They found that Facebook’s 
privacy policies improved from 2005 to 2009, at one point reaching 90% implementa-
tion of the criterion, and then steadily declined to 25% in 2015. The areas of notable 
decline were the amount of information gathered and monitored, informing users 
about what is shared, clearly identifying data used for profiling, giving users choices 
in privacy settings, providing information on how Facebook uses cookies, beacons, and 
weblogs to gather data, and providing an easily understood privacy policy document. 
The researchers noted that Facebook’s privacy policy started out in 2005 with 1,000 
words, and by 2015 had ballooned to over 12,000 words! 
The European Data Protection Directive
In Europe, privacy protection is much stronger than it is in the United States. In the 
United States, private organizations and businesses are permitted to use PII gathered 
in commercial transactions for other business purposes without the prior consent of 
the consumer (so-called secondary uses of PII). In the United States, there is no federal 
agency charged with enforcing privacy laws. Instead, privacy laws are enforced largely 
through self-regulation by businesses, and by individuals who must sue agencies or 
companies in court to recover damages. This is expensive and rarely done. The Euro-
pean approach to privacy protection is more comprehensive and regulatory in nature. 
European countries do not allow business firms to use PII without the prior consent 
of consumers. They enforce their privacy laws by creating data protection agencies to 
pursue complaints brought by citizens and actively enforce privacy laws.
In 1998, the European Commission’s Data Protection Directive went into effect, 
standardizing and broadening privacy protection in the E.U. nations. The Directive is 
based on the Fair Information Practices doctrine but extends the control individuals can 
exercise over their personal information. The Directive requires companies to inform 
people when they collect information about them and to disclose how it will be stored 
and used. Customers must provide their informed consent before any company can 
legally use data about them, and they have the right to access that information, correct 
it, and request that no further data be collected. Further, the Directive prohibits the

CRITERIA TO USE WHEN EXAMINING PRIVACY POLICIES
•	 Can the privacy policy be easily found, reviewed, and understood by users?
•	 Does the privacy policy fully disclose how personal information will and will not be used by the 
organization? Is information about users ever shared or sold without users’ explicit permission?
•	 Can users decide if they want to participate?
•	 Can users decide and actively indicate that they agree to be profiled, tracked, or targeted?
•	 Can users decide how and if their sensitive information is shared?
•	 Are users able to change any information that they input about themselves?
•	 Can users decide who can access their information?
•	 Are users notified promptly if their information is lost, stolen, or improperly accessed?
•	 Can users easily report concerns and get answers?
•	 Do users receive a copy of all disclosures of their information?

transfer of PII to organizations or countries that do not have similarly strong privacy 
protection policies. This means that data collected in Europe by American business 
firms cannot be transferred or processed in the United States (which has weaker privacy 
protection laws). This would potentially interfere with a $6.9 trillion annual trade flow 
in goods, services, and investment between the United States and Europe.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, working with the European Commission, 
developed a safe harbor framework that permits U.S. firms to move personal data from 
Europe to the United States. A safe harbor is a private self-regulating policy and 
enforcement mechanism that meets the objectives of government regulators and leg-
islation but does not involve government regulation or enforcement. The government 
plays a role in certifying safe harbors, however. Organizations that decide to participate 
in the safe harbor program must develop policies that meet European standards, and 
they must publicly sign on to a Web-based register maintained by the Department of 
Commerce. Enforcement occurs in the United States and relies to a large extent on 
self-policing and regulation, backed up by government enforcement of fair trade stat-
utes. However, in October 2015, Europe’s highest court struck down the safe harbor 
agreement entirely, in large part due to the revelations by Edward Snowden that Face-
book had shared personal information on European citizens with the NSA, and therefore 
violated the terms of the agreement (Scott, 2015). For the 4,000 or so U.S. companies 
that rely on the safe harbor agreement to move personal data from Europe to the United 
States, the court’s ruling potentially interferes with their current operations and places 
them in a legal limbo. Fortunately, other treaties are sufficient to carry on normal 
operations of businesses until a new agreement is worked out. One possible solution: 
keep European personal information on cloud servers located in Europe that conform 
to European data protection laws. However, it is unclear if this solution would meet 
the business requirements of large technology firms like Google and Facebook who 
heavily depend on their U.S. data and analytic platforms to process personal informa-
tion. For more information on the safe harbor, see www.export.gov/safeharbor.
In June 2015, the European Council approved its version of a new proposed E.U. 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to replace the existing Data Protection 
Directive. When it takes effect, the GDPR will apply across all E.U. countries, rather 
than the current situation in which each member-state regulates privacy matters 
within its own borders. Facebook and Google, for instance, currently base their Euro-
pean operations in Ireland where privacy protections are minimal. Originally intro-
duced in 2012, the GDPR will apply to any firm operating in any E.U. country, require 
unambiguous consent to use personal data for purposes like tracking individuals across 
the Web, limit the ability to use data for purposes other than those for which it was 
collected (tertiary uses, such as constructing user profiles), and strengthen the right 
to be forgotten, specifically, by allowing individuals to remove personal data from 
social platforms like Facebook. The next step is for versions of the GDPR approved by 
each of the European Council, European Commission, and European Parliament to 
be reconciled, producing the final version (Evans, 2015; Gibbs, 2015; European Com-
mission, 2014; Pearce and Clarke, 2014; European Commission, 2012).
In 2015, the privacy environment has turned decidedly against American firms 
like Facebook, Google, and others whose business model requires near unfettered use

of personal information to support advertising revenues. Five E.U. nations (Nether-
lands, Germany, France, Spain, and Belgium) have initiated a series of coordinated 
investigations into these firms’ privacy and data policies.
For instance, in 2015 Belgium sued Facebook for collecting and processing data 
without user consent, or explaining how it would use the information (Schechner and 
Drozdiak, 2015). France’s privacy data-protection regulator ordered Google to expand 
the right to be forgotten to the entire world, not just to Europeans (Schechner, 2015). 
Dutch, German, and Belgian authorities are investigating Facebook’s combining of data 
from its services like Instagram and WhatsApp to target advertising, and its use of its 
Like buttons for tracking browsing habits across the entire Web (Schechner, 2015b).
PRIVATE INDUSTRY SELF-REGULATION
The online industry in the United States has historically opposed online privacy legis-
lation, arguing that industry can do a better job of protecting privacy than government. 
However, individual firms such as Facebook, Apple, Yahoo, and Google have adopted 
policies on their own in an effort to address the concerns of the public about personal 
privacy on the Internet. The online industry formed the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA) 
in 1998 to encourage self-regulation in part as a reaction to growing public concerns 
and the threat of legislation being proposed by the FTC and privacy advocacy groups.
The FTC and private industry in the United States has created the idea of safe 
harbors from government regulation. For instance, COPPA includes a provision 
enabling industry groups or others to submit for the FTC’s approval self-regulatory 
guidelines that implement the protections of the FIP principles and FTC rules. In May 
2001, the FTC approved the TRUSTe Internet privacy protection program under the 
terms of COPPA as a safe harbor.
OPA has developed a set of privacy guidelines that members are required to imple-
ment. The primary focus of industry efforts has been the development of online “seals” 
that attest to the privacy policies on a site. The Better Business Bureau (BBB), TRUSTe, 
WebTrust, and major accounting firms—among them Pricewaterhouse­Coopers’ Bet-
terWeb—have established seals for Web sites. To display a seal, Web site operators must 
conform to certain privacy principles, a complaint resolution process, and monitoring 
by the seal originator. Nevertheless, online privacy seal programs have had a limited 
impact on Web privacy practices. Critics argue that seal programs are not particularly 
effective in safeguarding privacy. In March 2015, for instance, the FTC finalized a 
settlement in which it fined TRUSTe for failing to annually recertify privacy programs 
in more than 1,000 instances although claiming that it did so on its Web site (Davis, 
2015). For these reasons, the FTC has not deemed the seal programs as “safe harbors” 
yet (with the exception of TRUSTe’s children’s privacy seal under COPPA), and the 
agency continues to push for legislation to enforce privacy protection principles.
The advertising network industry has also formed an industry association, the 
Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), to develop privacy policies. The NAI policies 
have two objectives: to offer consumers a chance to opt out of advertising network pro-
grams (including e-mail campaigns), and to provide consumers redress from abuses. 
In order to opt out, the NAI has created a Web site—Networkadvertising.org—where 
consumers can use a global opt-out feature to prevent network advertising agencies

The AdChoices program is an industry-sponsored initiative to encourage Web 
sites to be more transparent about how they use personal information and to make it 
more likely that appropriate ads are shown to users by asking users themselves. An 
AdChoices icon appears next to ads, and clicking on this icon provides more informa-
tion and the opportunity to provide feedback to the advertiser. There is no data avail-
able yet to indicate how well this program is working.
In general, industry efforts at self-regulation in online privacy have not succeeded 
in reducing fears of privacy invasion during online transactions, or in reducing the 
level of privacy invasion. At best, self-regulation has offered consumers notice about 
whether a privacy policy exists, but usually says little about the actual use of the 
information, does not offer consumers a chance to see and correct the information 
or control its use in any significant way, offers no promises for the security of that 
information, and offers no enforcement mechanism (Hoofnagle, 2005).
PRIVACY ADVOCACY GROUPS
There are a number of privacy advocacy groups on the Web that monitor developments 
in privacy. Some of these sites are industry-supported, while others rely on private 
foundations and contributions. Some of the better-known sites are listed in Table 8.10.
THE PRIVACY PROTECTION BUSINESS
As Web sites become more invasive and aggressive in their use of personal informa-
tion, and as public concern grows, a small number of firms have sprung up to sell 
products that they claim will help people protect their privacy. Venture capital firms 
have picked up the scent and are investing in small start-up companies based on the 
premise that people will pay to protect their reputations. For instance, Reputation.com 
has received over $67 million in funding as of 2015. For as little as $14.95 a month, 
you can monitor what people are saying about you, or about your children, on social

Web sites. However, these types of firms can succeed only if people are willing to pay 
out of pocket for privacy protection. Economists studying this issue have found that 
people are not willing to pay much to protect their privacy (at most about $30), and 
many are willing to give up their privacy for small discounts (Brustein, 2012; Acquisti 
et al., 2009). For these reasons the privacy protection business at the retail level has 
not been successful. 
TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS
A number of privacy-enhancing technologies have been developed for protecting user 
privacy during interactions with Web sites such as spyware blockers, pop-up blockers, 
cookie managers, and secure e-mail (see Table 8.11). However, the most powerful 
tools for protecting privacy need to be built into browsers. Responding to pressure 
from privacy advocates, browsers now have a number of tools that can help users 
protect their privacy, such as eliminating third-party cookies. One of the most power-

refer to the Insight on Technology case, Every Move You Take, Every Click You Make, We’ll

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Congress shall have the power to “promote the progress of science 
and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and 
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and dis-
coveries.”
—Article I, Section 8, Constitution of the United States, 1788.
Next to privacy, the most controversial ethical, social, and political issue related to 
e-commerce is the fate of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property encom-
passes all the tangible and intangible products of the human mind. As a general rule, in 
the United States, the creator of intellectual property owns it. For instance, if you per-
sonally create an e-commerce site, it belongs entirely to you, and you have exclusive 
rights to use this “property” in any lawful way you see fit. But the Internet potentially 
changes things. Once intellectual works become digital, it becomes difficult to control 
access, use, distribution, and copying. These are precisely the areas that intellectual 
property seeks to control.
Digital media differ from books, periodicals, and other media in terms of ease of 
replication, transmission, and alteration; difficulty in classifying a software work as 
a program, book, or even music; compactness—making theft easy; and difficulty in 
establishing uniqueness. Before widespread use of the Internet, copies of software, 
books, magazine articles, or films had to be stored on physical media, such as paper, 
computer disks, or videotape, creating hurdles to distribution, and raising the costs 
of illegal copies.
The Internet technically permits millions of people to make perfect digital copies 
of various works—from music to plays, poems, and journal articles—and then to dis-
tribute them nearly cost-free to hundreds of millions of Web users. The proliferation 
of innovation has occurred so rapidly that few entrepreneurs have stopped to con-
sider who owns the patent on a business technique or method that they are using on 
their site. The spirit of the Web has been so free-wheeling that many entrepreneurs 
ignored trademark law and registered domain names that could easily be confused 
with another company’s registered trademarks. In short, the Internet has demon-
strated the potential to disrupt traditional conceptions and implementations of intel-
lectual property law developed over the last two centuries.

The major ethical issue related to e-commerce and intellectual property concerns 
how we (both as individuals and as business professionals) should treat property that 
belongs to others. From a social point of view, the main questions are: Is there con-
tinued value in protecting intellectual property in the Internet age? In what ways is 
society better off, or worse off, for having the concept of property apply to intangible 
ideas? Should society make certain technology illegal just because it has an adverse 
impact on some intellectual property owners? From a political perspective, we need 
to ask how the Internet and e-commerce can be regulated or governed to protect the 
institution of intellectual property while at the same time encouraging the growth of 
e-commerce and the Internet.
TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
There are three main types of intellectual property protection: copyright, patent, and 
trademark law. In the United States, the development of intellectual property law 
begins with the U.S. Constitution, which mandated Congress to devise a system of 
laws to promote “the progress of science and the useful arts.” Congress passed the first 
copyright law in 1790 to protect original written works for a period of 14 years, with a 
14-year renewal if the author was still alive. Since then, the idea of copyright has been 
extended to include music, films, translations, photographs, and most recently the 
designs of vessels under 200 feet (Fisher, 1999). The copyright law has been amended 
(mostly extended) 11 times in the last 40 years.
The goal of intellectual property law is to balance two competing interests—the 
public and the private. The public interest is served by the creation and distribution of 
inventions, works of art, music, literature, and other forms of intellectual expression. 
The private interest is served by rewarding people for creating these works through 
the creation of a time-limited monopoly granting exclusive use to the creator.
Maintaining this balance of interests is always challenged by the invention of new 
technologies. In general, the information technologies of the last century—from radio 
and television to CD-ROMs, DVDs, and the Internet—have at first tended to weaken 
the protections afforded by intellectual property law. Owners of intellectual property 
have often, but not always, been successful in pressuring Congress and the courts to 
strengthen the intellectual property laws to compensate for any technological threat, 
and even to extend protection for longer periods of time and to entirely new areas of 
expression. In the case of the Internet and e-commerce technologies, once again, intel-
lectual property rights are severely challenged. In the next few sections, we discuss 
the significant developments in each area: copyright, patent, and trademark.
COPYRIGHT: THE PROBLEM OF PERFECT COPIES AND ENCRYPTION
In the United States, copyright law protects original forms of expression such as 
writings (books, periodicals, lecture notes), art, drawings, photographs, music, motion 
pictures, performances, and computer programs from being copied by others for a 
period of time. Up until 1998, the copyright law protected works of individuals for 
their lifetime plus 50 years beyond their life, and works created for hire and owned 
by corporations, such as Mickey Mouse of the Disney Corporation, for 75 years after 
copyright law
protects original forms of 
expression such as writ-
ings, art, drawings, photo-
graphs, music, motion 
pictures, performances, and 
computer programs from 
being copied by others for 
a minimum of 70 years

initial creation. Copyright does not protect ideas—just their expression in a tangible 
medium such as paper, cassette tape, or handwritten notes.
In 1998, Congress extended the period of copyright protection for an additional 
20 years, for a total of 95 years for corporate-owned works, and life plus 70 years of 
protection for works created by individuals (the Copyright Term Extension Act, also 
known as CTEA). In Eldred v. Ashcroft, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that CTEA was 
constitutional, over the objections of groups arguing that Congress had given copyright 
holders a permanent monopoly over the expression of ideas, which ultimately would 
work to inhibit the flow of ideas and creation of new works by making existing works 
too expensive (Eldred v. Ashcroft, 2003; Greenhouse, 2003a). Librarians, academics, 
and others who depend on inexpensive access to copyrighted material opposed the 
legislation.
In the mid-1960s, the Copyright Office began registering software programs, and 
in 1980, Congress passed the Computer Software Copyright Act, which clearly provides 
protection for source and object code and for copies of the original sold in commerce, 
and sets forth the rights of the purchaser to use the software while the creator retains 
legal title. For instance, the HTML code for a Web page—even though easily available 
to every browser—cannot be lawfully copied and used for a commercial purpose, say, 
to create a new Web site that looks identical.
Copyright protection is clear-cut: it protects against copying of entire programs or 
their parts. Damages and relief are readily obtained for infringement. The drawback 
to copyright protection is that the underlying ideas behind a work are not protected, 
only their expression in a work. A competitor can view the source code on your Web 
site to see how various effects were created and then reuse those techniques to create 
a different Web site without infringing on your copyright.
Look and Feel
“Look and feel” copyright infringement lawsuits are precisely about the distinction 
between an idea and its expression. For instance, in 1988, Apple Computer sued 
Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Inc. for infringing Apple’s copyright on the 
Macintosh interface. Among other claims, Apple claimed that the defendants copied 
the expression of overlapping windows. Apple failed to patent the idea of overlapping 
windows when it invented this method of presenting information on a computer 
screen in the late 1960s. The defendants counterclaimed that the idea of overlapping 
windows could only be expressed in a single way and, therefore, was not protectable 
under the “merger” doctrine of copyright law. When ideas and their expression merge 
(i.e., if there is only one way to express an idea), the expression cannot be copyrighted, 
although the method of producing the expression might be patentable (Apple Computer, 
Inc. v. Microsoft, 1989). In general, courts appear to be following the reasoning of a 
1992 case—Brown Bag Software vs. Symantec Corp.—in which the court dissected the 
elements of software alleged to be infringing. There, the U.S. Federal Circuit Court 
of Appeals found that neither similar concept, function, general functional features 
(e.g., drop-down menus), nor colors were protectable by copyright law (Brown Bag vs. 
Symantec Corp., 1992).

Fair Use Doctrine
Copyrights, like all rights, are not absolute. There are situations where strict copyright 
observance could be harmful to society, potentially inhibiting other rights such as the 
right to freedom of expression and thought. As a result, the doctrine of fair use has 
been created. The doctrine of fair use permits teachers, writers, and others to use 
copyrighted materials without permission under certain circumstances. Table 8.12 
describes the five factors that courts consider when assessing what constitutes fair 
use.
The fair use doctrine draws upon the First Amendment’s protection of freedom 
of speech (and writing). Journalists, writers, and academics must be able to refer to, 
and cite from, copyrighted works in order to criticize, or even discuss them. Professors 
are allowed to clip a contemporary article just before class, copy it, and hand it out to 
students as an example of a topic under discussion. However, they are not permitted 
to add this article to the class syllabus for the next semester without compensating 
the copyright holder.
What constitutes fair use has been at issue in a number of recent cases. In Kelly 
v. Arriba Soft (2003) and Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. et al., (2007), the Federal 
Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the display of thumbnail images 
in response to search requests constituted fair use. A similar result was reached by the 
district court for the District of Nevada with respect to Google’s storage and display of 
Web sites from cache memory, in Field v. Google, Inc. (2006). In all of these cases, the 
courts accepted the argument that caching the material and displaying it in response 
to a search request was not only a public benefit, but also a form of marketing of the 
material on behalf of its copyright owner, thereby enhancing the material’s commercial 
value. In what’s known as the “dancing baby case,” a mother uploaded a 30-second 
video to YouTube of her baby dancing to a song by Prince called Let’s Go Crazy. Univer-
sal Music Group, the owner of the copyright to the song, objected. The mother sued, 
doctrine of fair use
under certain circum-
stances, permits use of 
copyrighted material 
without permission

claiming use of the clip was fair use. A federal court agreed that the fair use doctrine 
permitted the mother to use a 30-second clip of the song (Bergen, 2015). 
Fair use is also at issue in a lawsuit filed by the Authors Guild and five major 
publishing companies against Google. Beginning in 2004, Google announced a project 
with two parts. A Partner Program would scan books with the permission of publishers, 
index the books, post snippets of the books on line, and make bibliographic informa-
tion available on Google’s search engine. In the second project, called the Library 
Project, Google aimed to scan all the books in several university and public libraries, 
and then make snippets and parts of the book available online without receiving per-
mission from the publishers or paying royalties. Google said it would never show a 
full page, just relevant portions of a page in response to searches. In 2005, the Authors 
Guild and the large book publishers filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent Google from 
implementing the Library Project. 
Google argued that the Library Project constituted fair use of publishers’ copy-
righted works because it only published snippets. Moreover, Google claimed that it was 
simply helping libraries do what they are intended to do, namely, lend books. Library 
lending is considered a fair use following an agreement in the late 1930s with publish-
ers, and such lending was codified into the Copyright Act of 1976. Google claimed that 
helping libraries make books more available to the public was in the broader public 
interest, and extended existing rights of libraries to encourage book availability. 
In 2013, eight years later, following several reversals of opinions, a federal court 
finally found in favor of Google without reservation by ruling that Google’s scanning 
and making snippets of text available to the public was “fair use” under U.S. copyright 
law. The judge believed the project had a broad public purpose of making it easier 
for students, researchers, teachers, and the general public to find books, while also 
preserving consideration for author and publisher rights. The Google project was 
“transformative” in the court’s view, giving books a new character and purpose, making 
it easier to discover old books, and leading to increased sales. Two remaining lawsuits 
are still being decided in 2015 but it appears the fair use judgment will hold. In the 
meantime, the project itself has stalled, and efforts to scan so-called orphan books in 
libraries where the copyright holder could not be identified have ended. Google now 
appears less than enthusiastic about pursuing the project. 
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 was the first major effort to 
adjust the copyright laws of the United States to the Internet age, and remains to this 
day, the primary statue that defines the relationship between copyright owners, Internet 
service providers (which in this context also includes Web site publishers as well as firms 
that provide Internet service), and end-users of copyrighted material. The law imple-
ments two international treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), 
a worldwide body formed by the major nations in North America and Europe, as well 
as Japan. This is one case where law preceded or at least was contemporaneous with 
digital technology. Table 8.13 summarizes the major provisions of the DMCA. 
There are a number of different actors and conflicting interests involved in the 
process of delivering content on the Internet. Obviously, copyright owners do not want

their work copied and distributed without their consent (and probably compensation), 
and they do not want their digital rights management software programs broken, 
compromised, or made ineffectual. ISPs want the freedom to use content within the 
provisions of “fair use” and do not want to be held liable for content that users may 
post to their Web sites. ISPs argue that they are similar to telephone transmission lines, 
merely providing a method of communication, and they should not be required to 
monitor their users’ activities to see if they are posting copyrighted material. Such sur-
veillance, ISPs and civil libertarians argue, would constitute a restriction on freedom 
of expression. In addition, the economics of the Internet could be compromised if ISPs 
were unnecessarily restricted. The business model of many Internet firms depends on 
creating large, even huge, audiences, and the more content that can be displayed, the 
larger the audience, and the more ads can be sold. ISPs also generate revenue from 
selling bandwidth, so the greater the bandwidth required to support large audiences, 
the better it is for them. Restricting content is bad for business. Finally, consumers of 
Internet content want as much content as possible, at the lowest cost possible, or even 
free. The more content for users to consume, the more they benefit from the Internet. 
The DMCA tries to balance these different interests. Title I of the DMCA imple-
ments the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, which makes it illegal to make, distribute, 
or use devices that circumvent technology-based protections of copyrighted materials, 
and attaches stiff fines and prison sentences for violations. This makes it illegal, for 
instance, to break the security software typically found on DVDs, Amazon’s Kindle 
books, and similar devices. There are a number of exceptions to the strong prohibitions 
against defeating a copyright protection scheme, however, including exceptions for

libraries to examine works for adoption, for reverse engineering to achieve interopera-
bility with other software, for encryption research, and for privacy protection purposes.
Title II of the DMCA creates two safe harbors for ISPs. The first safe harbor (the 
Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act) provides that ISPs will not 
be held liable for infringing material that users post to blogs, Web pages, or forums, as 
long as the ISP did not have knowledge that the content was infringing, did not receive 
any financial benefit attributable to the infringing activity (assuming they can control 
this activity), and acts expeditiously to remove infringing content when notified by 
a notice of infringement. This means that users of, say, YouTube, can post material 
that infringes a copyright and YouTube cannot be held liable (safe harbor) as long as 
it does not know the material is infringing, and if it demonstrates that it has in place 
procedures to take down infringing content once it becomes aware of the matter or 
receives a proper notice from the copyright owner. Such a notice is called a takedown 
notice, a claim by the copyright owner that the ISP is hosting infringing content. Copy-
right owners can also subpoena the personal identities of any infringers using an ISP. 
The second safe harbor relates to links to infringing material: ISPs will not be 
held liable for referring or linking users to a site that contains infringing material or 
infringing activity. So for example, a search engine that directs users to a Web site that 
contains pirated songs or movies cannot be held liable. This safe harbor is applicable 
as long as ISPs did not have knowledge they were linking users to sites containing 
infringing content, did not receive any financial benefit attributable to the infringing 
activity (assuming they can control this activity), and acts expeditiously to remove or 
disable any such link after receiving a proper notice from the copyright owner. 
There are a number of administrative requirements for ISPs to be protected by 
the safe harbor provisions. ISPs must designate an agent to receive takedown notices; 
adopt and publish a copyright infringement policy (this can be part of a terms of use 
policy); and comply with takedown notices by removing the content, and/or links to 
the content. The penalties for willfully violating the DMCA include restitution to the 
injured parties of any losses due to infringement. Criminal remedies may include fines 
up to $500,000 or five years imprisonment for a first offense, and up to $1 million in 
fines and 10 years in prison for repeat offenders. These are serious penalties, but they 
have rarely been imposed. 
The DMCA relieves ISPs of any liability for posting or linking to copyrighted mate-
rial, if they can meet the safe harbors’ conditions. This means users of YouTube can 
post what they want, and YouTube will not be held liable for infringing content even if 
it violates YouTube’s terms of use policy, which states that users shall not post infring-
ing content. However, it does require YouTube to remove content or links that are 
infringing once it receives a valid takedown notice. With respect to receiving financial 
benefits, ISPs may indeed receive financial benefits from posting infringing content 
if they can show that they can’t control the behavior of their users, or that there is no 
way of knowing prior to the posting that the material is infringing. For instance, how 
can YouTube be held responsible for users who post copyrighted songs or movies? How 
could YouTube know, at the time of posting, that the content is infringing?
ISPs and individuals who post content are also protected from frivolous takedown 
notices. For instance, the ruling in the “dancing baby” case discussed on page 530 put 

574	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
copyright owners on notice that they needed to be careful issuing takedown notices 
if use of the copyrighted material might constitute fair use and that the DMCA does 
not supersede the doctrine of fair use. 
Safe harbor provisions of the DMCA were also at the heart of a $1 billion lawsuit 
originally brought by Viacom in 2007 against Google and YouTube for willful copy-
right infringement. In the Viacom case, Viacom alleged that YouTube and Google 
engaged in massive copyright infringement by deliberately and knowingly building 
up a library of infringing works to draw traffic to the YouTube site and enhance its 
commercial value. Entire episodes of shows like SpongeBob SquarePants and the 
Jon Stewart show were appearing on YouTube without permission or payment. In 
response, Google and YouTube claimed that they are protected by the DMCA’s safe 
harbor provisions and that it is impossible to know whether a video is infringing or not. 
YouTube also does not display ads on pages where consumers can view videos unless 
it has an agreement with the content owner. In 2007, Google announced a filtering 
system (Content ID) aimed at addressing the problem. It requires content owners to 
give Google a copy of their content so Google can load it into an auto-identification 
system. Then after a video is uploaded to YouTube, the system attempts to match it 
with its database of copyrighted material and removes any unauthorized material. 
The copyright owner has several options: it can mute the audio; block a whole video; 
monetize the video by running ads against it; and track the video’s viewer statistics. 
In March 2014, seven years after the billion dollar suit was filed, and multiple court 
room appearances, Google and Viacom settled out of court. Google’s ability to take 
down copyrighted material using Content ID had become very effective, and Google 
agreed to rent hundreds of Viacom shows (Kaufman, 2014). Both parties recognized 
in a joint statement that they could achieve their objectives by collaborating rather 
than continuing the lawsuit. 
The entertainment industry continues to be aggressive in pursuing online copy-
right infringement. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice seized the domain Megaup-
load.com, one of the largest cyberlockers on the Internet dedicated to storing and 
sharing copyrighted movies and music. A cyberlocker is an online file storage service 
dedicated to sharing copyrighted material (often movies) illegally. Megaupload’s 
founder, Kim Dotcom, was arrested in New Zealand at his home, and $17 million in 
assets, and later, $37 million in cash in Hong Kong, was confiscated. Mr. Dotcom is 
currently back in court, and fighting efforts by the United States to extradite him from 
New Zealand to face copyright, racketeering, and money laundering charges (Reuters, 
2015).
Since the Megaupload case, other cyberlockers have restricted their activities to 
avoid a similar fate as Megaupload. In 2013, the Center for Copyright Information 
(CCI), along with 5 of the largest ISPs, major entertainment industry companies, and 
the Consumer Advisory Board launched the Copyright Alert System (CAS)—a tiered 
notice and response system aimed at reducing copyright infringement over P2P net-
works. During its first 10 months of operation, the CAS sent out over 1.3 million alerts 
to 720,000 ISP account holders of alleged copyright infringement. If the account holder 
ignores repeated alerts, their ISP may impose consequences, such as a downgrade of 
cyberlocker
an online file storage 
service dedicated to 
sharing copyrighted mate-
rial illegally

the customer’s Internet service. The CCI believes that the CAS has great promise for 
its ability to move user behavior away from copyright infringement and toward legal 
sources of content (Center for Copyright Information, 2014). Refer to the chapter-
ending case study on The Pirate Bay.
While there has been some progress in limiting infringing content on the Internet, 
new mobile apps such as Periscope and Meerkat make it easy for people to capture 
live video and stream it to these apps on mobile devices, making it extremely difficult 
for content owners to protect the value of their live products. Periscope is owned by 
Twitter and users can post live videos to Twitter. Meerkat can post live video streams 
to most social network sites, including Facebook. In 2015, Periscope and Meerkat 
were used by thousands to watch the pay-per-view broadcast of the welterweight fight 
between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao for free. The pay-per-view price on 
cable networks was $100. Other users have streamed live TV series such as HBO’s 
Game of Thrones. Periscope received 1,400 DMCA takedown requests in the first 
three months of its existence. Twitter says it has complied with 71% of these (Har-
rison, 2015). But the DMCA takedown notices do not help a unique live event such 
as a championship boxing match retain its value. The value of the event is largely in 
attracting viewers willing to pay to see it as it happens, and once a free alternative is 
available, that value is destroyed.
PATENTS: BUSINESS METHODS AND PROCESSES
“Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, 
machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and 
useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore, 
subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”
—Section 101, U.S. Patent Act
A patent grants the owner a 20-year exclusive monopoly on the ideas behind an inven-
tion. The congressional intent behind patent law was to ensure that inventors of new 
machines, devices, or industrial methods would receive the full financial and other 
rewards of their labor and still make widespread use of the invention possible by 
providing detailed diagrams for those wishing to use the idea under license from the 
patent’s owner. Patents are obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO), which was created in 1812. Obtaining a patent is much more difficult 
and time-consuming than obtaining copyright protection (which is automatic with the 
creation of the work). Patents must be formally applied for, and the granting of a patent 
is determined by Patent Office examiners who follow a set of rigorous rules. Ulti-
mately, federal courts decide when patents are valid and when infringement occurs.
Patents are very different from copyrights because patents protect the ideas them-
selves and not merely the expression of ideas. There are four types of inventions for 
which patents are granted under patent law: machines, man-made products, composi-
tions of matter, and processing methods. The Supreme Court has determined that patents 
extend to “anything under the sun that is made by man” (Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 1980) 
patent
grants the owner an exclu-
sive monopoly on the ideas 
behind an invention for 20 
years

as long as the other requirements of the Patent Act are met. There are three things that 
cannot be patented: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. For instance, 
a mathematical algorithm cannot be patented unless it is realized in a tangible machine 
or process that has a “useful” result (the mathematical algorithm exception).
In order to be granted a patent, the applicant must show that the invention is 
new, original, novel, nonobvious, and not evident in prior arts and practice. As with 
copyrights, the granting of patents has moved far beyond the original intent of Con-
gress’s first patent statute, which sought to protect industrial designs and machines. 
Patent protection has been extended to articles of manufacture (1842), plants (1930), 
surgical and medical procedures (1950), and software (1981). The Patent Office did 
not accept applications for software patents until a 1981 Supreme Court decision that 
held that computer programs could be a part of a patentable process. Since that time, 
thousands of software patents have been granted. Virtually any software program can 
be patented as long as it is novel and not obvious.
Essentially, as technology and industrial arts progress, patents have been extended 
to both encourage entrepreneurs to invent useful devices and promote widespread 
dissemination of the new techniques through licensing and artful imitation of the 
published patents (the creation of devices that provide the same functionality as the 
invention but use different methods) (Winston, 1998). Patents encourage inventors 
to come up with unique ways of achieving the same functionality as existing patents. 
For instance, Amazon’s patent on one-click purchasing caused Barnesandnoble.com 
to invent a simplified two-click method of purchasing.
The danger of patents is that they stifle competition by raising barriers to entry 
into an industry. Patents force new entrants to pay licensing fees to incumbents, and 
thus slow down the development of technical applications of new ideas by creating 
lengthy licensing applications and delays. Nowhere is the tradeoff between encour-
aging innovation and yet avoiding raising barriers to market entry (and thereby dis-
couraging innovation) more evident than in the patent battle that has raged between 
Apple and Samsung in the smartphone market.
In April 2011, Apple filed suit in the United States against Samsung alleging that 
Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones violated Apple patents on its iPhone and iPad com-
puter. By 2012, Apple and Samsung were involved in over 50 different patent lawsuits 
throughout the world. See Table 8.14 for a brief history of the Apple/Samsung smart-
phone patent wars. 
The history of the patent battle is quite complex, and lengthy, lasting over five 
years. There are three questions raised in this litigation. First, does Apple have valid 
patents on iPhone and iPad hardware and software? Second, did Samsung’s phones 
and tablets infringe on these Apple patents? And third, if Samsung did infringe, what 
should the penalty be? There are two possibilities: Samsung pays a fine for damages 
and/or Samsung removes its infringing products from the market. A fourth question 
is separate from the lawsuits per se and concerns society, the rest of us: what is the 
best outcome for society? 
After five years and two jury trials, the courts have decided that Apple does have 
valid patents on the physical iPhone, as well as the operating system, including the 
user interface and screen functionality. Second, the courts did find that Samsung 

	
I n t e l l e c t u a l  P r o p e r t y  R i g h t s 	

577
infringed on some of Apple’s patents, and even Samsung admits as much. Third, 
the courts have generally avoided forcing Samsung to remove its infringing devices 
from the market, and instead have focused on damages with some exceptions for 
older phones (Decker, 2015). However, in September 2015, Apple finally won a U.S. 
appeals court judgment that enjoins Samsung from selling smartphones with Apple’s 
patented slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, and quicklinks features. This was a major victory 
in principle that Apple can use in the future against other copycat firms (Chen, 2015; 
Kendall and Wakabayashi, 2015). But Samsung had already designed around these 
features and came up with its own user interface that accomplishes the same tasks. 
Hence, the ruling is not likely to have a notable impact on Samsung’s sales revenues. 
The original jury award of $1 billion has been whittled down over the years. Analysts 
believe the cost to Apple of this litigation is at least equal to the damage award it may 
ultimately be paid. Over the last five years of litigation, Samsung has changed its 
interface and functionality to greatly reduce its infringement. Software features can 
always be designed around. The final chapter may not be written until 2016. 
An answer to the fourth question, what is the best outcome for society, is more 
difficult to determine. Apple’s forceful defense has put copycat firms on notice that if 
they infringe on patents owned by large firms such as Apple, it could be harmful to their

APPLE/SAMSUNG SMARTPHONE PATENT WARS

D E S C R I P T I O N
2011–2012
In April 2011 Apple filed suit in the United States charging Samsung devices 
violated Apple patents, and Samsung claimed similar infringement by Apple. 
The smartphone patent wars begin. 
Apple’s patents had been filed in January 2007 shortly after the introduction 
of the iPhone. The design patents covered the basic shape of the phone, 
software features (slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, bounce-back effect, and 
quicklinks), trade dress features, and user interface—home button, icons with 
rounded and tapered edges). In short, everything that made the iPhone a 
unique product. 
By 2012, Apple and Samsung are involved in 50 different lawsuits around the 
world involving the design of tablets and smartphones. 
August 2012
First jury verdict mostly favorable to Apple. Found Samsung had infringed on 
design and utility patents, and Apple’s trade dress features. Awarded Apple 
$1.049 billion. An injunction preventing Samsung from selling infringing 
products was at first denied, but later granted.
November 2013
A retrial of the first jury trial. Samsung admitted to infringing on Apple 
patents, but argued the penalty was too high. The jury reduced the damages 
to $290 million. 
May 2014
Another jury trial. Apple wins jury verdict of $119.6 million against Samsung, 
finding that Samsung infringed on patents for slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, 
and quicklinks features. Judge declines to force removal of devices from 
market, instead argues for damages as penalty. 
September 2015
Apple and Samsung announced an agreement to participate in court-
supervised mediation of their five-year dispute. This is the third effort at 
mediation (the first two failed). 
March/April 2016 
A second damages re-trial is scheduled should mediation fail.

brands and possibly result in significant damages. Samsung has been pushed into the 
lower end of the market where it competes with less expensive, copycat smartphones 
from China. Samsung has a very large chunk of the smartphone market worldwide, but 
it has been denied pricing power and resulting profits. The litigation may have strength-
ened Apple’s claim that its computers and smartphones are truly unique, and original. 
Apple today is the largest corporation in the United States by market capitalization and 
also the most profitable in the world. Samsung’s copying of Apple designs and features 
may only have strengthened Apple’s claims to be a superior product. 
E-commerce Patents
Much of the Internet’s infrastructure and software was developed under the auspices 
of publicly funded scientific and military programs in the United States and Europe. 
Unlike Samuel F. B. Morse, who patented the idea of Morse code and made the tele-
graph useful, most of the inventions that make the Internet and e-commerce possible 
were not patented by their inventors. The early Internet was characterized by a spirit 
of worldwide community development and sharing of ideas without consideration of 
personal wealth (Winston, 1998). This early Internet spirit changed in the mid-1990s 
with the commercial development of the World Wide Web.
In 1998, a landmark legal decision, State Street Bank & Trust v. Signature Financial 
Group, Inc., paved the way for business firms to begin applying for “business methods” 
patents. In this case, a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the claims of Signature 
Financial to a valid patent for a business method that allows managers to monitor and 
record financial information flows generated by a partner fund. Previously, it was 
thought business methods could not be patented. However, the court ruled there was 
no reason to disallow business methods from patent protection, or any “step by step 
process, be it electronic or chemical or mechanical, [that] involves an algorithm in 
the broad sense of the term” (State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, 
1998). The State Street decision led to an explosion in applications for e-commerce 
“business methods” patents. In June 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a divided 
opinion on business methods patents in the Bilski et al. v. Kappos case (Bilski et al. v. 
Kappos, 2010). The majority argued that business methods patents were allowable even 
though they did not meet the traditional “machine or transformation test,” in which 
patents are granted to devices that are tied to a particular machine, are a machine, 
or transform articles from one state to another. The minority wanted to flatly declare 
that business methods are not patentable in part because any series of steps could be 
considered a business method (Schwartz, 2010). The Supreme Court struck another 
blow against business method patents in 2014, with its decision in Alice Corporation 
vs. CLS Bank International. The Court ruled that basic business methods cannot be 
patented and that while software can be patented, implementing an abstract idea that 
otherwise could not be patented by using software does not transform the idea into 
a patentable innovation (Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, 2014).
Table 8.15 lists some of the better-known e-commerce patents. Some are con-
troversial. Reviewing these, you can understand the concerns of commentators and 
corporations. Some of the patent claims are very broad (for example, “name your 
price” sales methods), have historical precedents in the pre-Internet era (shopping

Amazon attempted to use patent originally granted to it in 1999 to force changes 
to Barnes & Noble’s Web site, but a federal court overturned a previously issued 
injunction. Eventually settled out of court. In 2007, a USPTO panel rejected some of 
the patent because of evidence another patent predated it. Amazon amended the 
patent, and the revised version was confirmed in 2010.
Priceline

Sightsound won a settlement in 2004 against Bertelsmann subsidiaries CDNow and 
N2K music sites for infringing its patent.
Akamai

A broad patent granted in 2000 covering techniques for expediting the flow of 
information over the Internet. Akamai sued Digital Island for violating the patent 
and, in 2001, a jury found in its favor.
DoubleClick
Dynamic delivery

System and method for influencing position on search result list generated by 
computer search engine, granted in 2001. Competitor FindWhat sued Overture, 
charging that patent was obtained illegally; Overture countered by suing both 
FindWhat and Google for violating patent. Google agreed to pay a license fee to 
Overture in 2004 to settle.
Acacia

The so-called “shopping cart” patent for network-based systems, which involves 
any transaction over a network involving a seller, buyer, and payment system. In 
other words, e-commerce! Soverain filed suit against Amazon for patent 
infringement, which Amazon paid $40 million to settle. In 2013 a federal district 
court ruled Soverain’s claims against Newegg in part invalid.

carts), and seem “obvious” (one-click purchasing). Critics of online business methods 
patents argue that the Patent Office has been too lenient in granting such patents, 
and that in most instances, the supposed inventions merely copy pre-Internet busi-
ness methods and thus do not constitute “inventions” (Harmon, 2003; Thurm, 2000; 
Chiappetta, 2001). The Patent Office argues, on the contrary, that its Internet inven-
tions staff is composed of engineers, lawyers, and specialists with many years of 
experience with Internet and network technologies, and that it consults with outside 
technology experts before granting patents. To complicate matters, the European 
Patent Convention and the patent laws of most European countries do not recognize 
business methods per se unless the method is implemented through some technology 
(Takenaka, 2001).
TRADEMARKS: ONLINE INFRINGEMENT AND DILUTION
A trademark is “any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combi-
nation thereof ... used in commerce ... to identify and distinguish 
... goods ... from those manufactured or sold by others and to 
indicate the source of the goods.”
—The Trademark Act, 1946
Trademark law is a form of intellectual property protection for trademarks—a mark 
used to identify and distinguish goods and indicate their source. Trademark protections 
exist at both the federal and state levels in the United States. The purpose of trademark 
law is twofold. First, trademark law protects the public in the marketplace by ensuring 
that it gets what it pays for and wants to receive. Second, trademark law protects the 
owner—who has spent time, money, and energy bringing the product to the market-
place—against piracy and misappropriation. Trademarks have been extended from 
single words to pictures, shapes, packaging, and colors. Some things may not be trade-
marked such as common words that are merely descriptive (“clock”). Federal trade-
marks are obtained, first, by use in interstate commerce, and second, by registration 
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Federal trademarks are granted 
for a period of 10 years and can be renewed indefinitely.
Disputes over federal trademarks involve establishing infringement. The test 
for infringement is twofold: market confusion and bad faith. Use of a trademark that 
creates confusion with existing trademarks, causes consumers to make market mis-
takes, or misrepresents the origins of goods is an infringement. For instance, in July 
2015, Multi Time Machine (MTM) sued Amazon for violation of its trademarks and 
confusing consumers looking to buy MTM watches. MTM makes military style watches 
that are not sold on Amazon. If a user searches on Amazon for an MTM watch, the 
search results shows watches being offered by MTM competitors that are similar in 
style to MTM’s. MTM argued that this could confuse customers and the court agreed, 
allowing the case to proceed to trial (Levine, 2015). In addition, the intentional misuse 
of words and symbols in the marketplace to extort revenue from legitimate trademark 
owners (“bad faith”) is proscribed.

In 1995, Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA), which 
created a federal cause of action for dilution of famous marks. This legislation dispenses 
with the test of market confusion (although that is still required to claim infringement), 
and extends protection to owners of famous trademarks against dilution, which is 
defined as any behavior that would weaken the connection between the trademark and 
the product. In 2006, the FTDA was amended by the Trademark Dilution Revision Act 
(TDRA), which allows a trademark owner to file a claim based on a “likelihood of dilu-
tion” standard, rather than having to provide evidence of actual dilution. The TDRA 
also expressly provides that dilution may occur through blurring (weakening the con-
nection between the trademark and the goods) and tarnishment (using the trademark 
in a way that makes the underlying products appear unsavory or unwholesome). Inter-
nationally, WIPO handles many cybersquatting cases under its Uniform Dispute Reso-
lution Procedures. In 2014, WIPO warned that the expansion of generic top-level 
domains authorized by ICANN is likely to be very disruptive in terms of trademark 
protection (New, 2014). Although the cost of obtaining a new gTLD is not unsubstantial 
(it is estimated to be more than $180,000), by May 2015, 583 new gTLDs had been 
approved. Successful applicants become owners of these gTLDs, and can create and 
sell new domains with the gTLD suffix, such as Avenger.movie. Many of these new 
domains may potentially conflict with the established trademarks of others. 
To deal with these trademark conflicts, ICANN developed a set of procedures 
to rapidly resolve disputes called the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), a 
domain name dispute procedure that allows a trademark owner to seek suspension 
of a domain name in a new generic top-level domain (gTLD). ICANN also established 
a Trademark Clearing house as a repository of data on registered, court-validated, or 
statute-protected trademarks. Trademark owners register their marks for a fee. 
One successful applicant for a new gTLD is Vox Populi Registry Ltd. Based in the 
U.K., Vox purchased the gTLD .sucks, and began selling domains such as Apple.sucks 
and CitiGroup.sucks exclusively to corporations who did not want their brand name 
associated with .sucks. At some point, .sucks domains will be available to the general 
public, at which point anyone would be able to create a new domain that potentially 
embarrasses a major brand name or casts it in a negative light (Bloomberg, 2015). 
ICANN has said it may seek remedies and has alerted the Federal Trade Commis-
sion and asked for an opinion on the legality of Vox Populi’s behavior. ICANN is not 
a regulatory agency with enforcement powers, and its agreements with new domain 
owners does not discuss their business models (Fung, 2015). 
Trademarks and the Internet
The rapid growth and commercialization of the Internet have provided unusual oppor-
tunities for existing firms with distinctive and famous trademarks to extend their 
brands to the Internet. These same developments have provided malicious individu-
als and firms the opportunity to squat on Internet domain names built upon famous 
marks, as well as attempt to confuse consumers and dilute famous or distinctive marks 
(including your personal name or a movie star’s name). The conflict between legiti-
mate trademark owners and malicious firms was allowed to fester and grow because

Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), originally the Internet’s sole agency for domain name 
registration for many years, had a policy of “first come, first served.” This meant 
anyone could register any domain name that had not already been registered, regard-
less of the trademark status of the domain name. NSI was not authorized to decide 
trademark issues (Nash, 1997).
In response to a growing number of complaints from owners of famous trademarks 
who found their trademark names being appropriated by Web entrepreneurs, Congress 
passed the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) in November 
1999. The ACPA creates civil liabilities for anyone who attempts in bad faith to profit 
from an existing famous or distinctive trademark by registering an Internet domain 
name that is identical or confusingly similar to, or “dilutive” of, that trademark. The 
act does not establish criminal sanctions. It proscribes using “bad-faith” domain names 
to extort money from the owners of the existing trademark (cybersquatting), or using 
the bad-faith domain to divert Web traffic to the bad-faith domain that could harm the 
good will represented by the trademark, create market confusion, or tarnish or dispar-
age the mark (cyberpiracy). It is conceivable that domains such as the previously 
described Apple.sucks might be seen as a kind of cybersquatting and a violation of the 
ACPA. The act also proscribes the use of a domain name that consists of the name of 
a living person, or a name confusingly similar to an existing personal name, without 
that person’s consent, if the registrant is registering the name with the intent to profit 
by selling the domain name to that person.
Trademark abuse can take many forms on the Web. Table 8.16 lists the major 
behaviors on the Internet that have run afoul of trademark law and some of the court 
cases that resulted.
Cybersquatting and Brandjacking
In one of the first cases involving the ACPA, E. & J. Gallo Winery, owner of the regis-
tered mark “Ernest and Julio Gallo” for alcoholic beverages, sued Spider Webs Ltd. for 
using the domain name Ernestandjuliogallo.com. Spider Webs Ltd. was a domain name 
speculator that owned numerous domain names consisting of famous company names. 
The Ernestandjuliogallo.com Web site contained information on the risks of alcohol 
use, anti-corporate articles about E. & J. Gallo Winery, and was poorly constructed. 
The court concluded that Spider Webs Ltd. was in violation of the ACPA and that its 
actions constituted dilution by blurring because the Ernestandjuliogallo.com domain 
name appeared on every page printed off the Web site accessed by that name, and 
that Spider Webs Ltd. was not free to use this particular mark as a domain name (E. 
& J. Gallo Winery v. Spider Webs Ltd., 2001). In August 2009, a court upheld the largest 
cybersquatting judgment to date: a $33 million verdict in favor of Verizon against 
OnlineNIC, an Internet domain registration company that had used over 660 names 
that could easily be confused with legitimate Verizon domain names. Although there 
have not been many cases decided under the ACPA, that does not mean the problem 
has gone away. Impersonation of individuals and brands on social network sites adds 
another dimension to the problem. Both Twitter and Facebook make cybersquatting 
and impersonation a violation of their terms of service.

However, it is not always easy for a firm to prevent trademark infringement by 
cybersquatters, or to prevent squatters from profiting from their infringing activities. In 
2015, for instance, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) accused 
domain registrar GoDaddy of cybersquatting (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sci-
ences v. GoDaddy.com Inc et al., 2015). AMPAS claimed GoDaddy acted in bad faith 
by allowing customers to purchase 293 domain names such as Academyawards.net, 
Oscarsredacademyawards.net, Oscarsredcarpet.com, Billycrystal2012oscars.com, and 
Theoscargoestothehangover.com, and then sharing in the advertising revenues those 
pages generated. The court ruled that GoDaddy relied on representations of their users 
that their domain registrations did not infringe any trademarks, and that it took down 
domains after receiving takedown requests. AMPAS failed to prove intent to profit from 
AMPAS marks, according to the court. This suit demonstrates that trademark owners

need to be vigilant in detecting infringement, sending takedown notices immediately, 
and following up to make sure the infringing sites are taken down. The burden is 
clearly on the trademark owner. The suit also demonstrates that cybersquatters have 
little incentive to stop trying to defraud and confuse consumers. If they are caught, 
their sites are taken down, but there is no penalty for trying (Stempel, 2015). 
Cyberpiracy
Cyberpiracy involves the same behavior as cybersquatting, but with the intent of 
diverting traffic from the legitimate site to an infringing site. In Ford Motor Co. v. 
Lapertosa, Lapertosa had registered and used a Web site called Fordrecalls.com as an 
adult entertainment Web site. The court ruled that Fordrecalls.com was in violation 
of the ACPA in that it was a bad-faith attempt to divert traffic to the Lapertosa site and 
diluted Ford’s wholesome trademark (Ford Motor Co. v. Lapertosa, 2001).
The Ford decision reflects two other famous cases of cyberpiracy. In the Paine 
Webber Inc. v. Fortuny case, the court enjoined Fortuny from using the domain name 
www.painewebber.com—a site that specialized in pornographic materials—because it 
diluted and tarnished Paine Webber’s trademark and diverted Web traffic from Paine 
Webber’s legitimate site—Painewebber.com (Paine Webber Inc. v. Fortuny, 1999). In 
the Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Global Site Designs, Inc. case, the court enjoined the 
defendants from using the Playboy and Playmate marks in their domain names Play-
boyonline.net and Playmatesearch.net and from including the Playboy trademark in 
their metatags. In these cases, the defendants’ intention was diversion for financial 
gain (Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Global Site Designs, Inc., 1999).
Typosquatting is a form of cyberpiracy in which a domain name contains a 
common misspelling of another site’s name. These domains are sometimes referred 
to as “doppelganger” domains. Often the user ends up at a site very different from 
one they intended to visit. For instance, John Zuccarini is an infamous typosquatter 
who was jailed in 2002 for setting up pornographic Web sites with URLs based on 
misspellings of popular children’s brands, such as Bob the Builder and Teletubbies. 
The FTC fined him again in October 2007 for engaging in similar practices (McMillan, 
2007). Harvard Business School professor Ben Edelman conducted a study that found 
that there were at least 938,000 domains typosquatting on the top 3,264 “.com” Web 
sites, and that 57% of these domains included Google pay-per click ads. In July 2011, 
Facebook filed a lawsuit against 25 typosquatters who established Web sites with such 
domain names as Faceboook, Facemook, Faceboik, and Facebooki. In 2013, Facebook 
was awarded $2.8 milion in damages.
Metatagging
The legal status of using famous or distinctive marks as metatags is more complex and 
subtle. The use of trademarks in metatags is permitted if the use does not mislead or 
confuse consumers. Usually this depends on the content of the site. A car dealer would 
be permitted to use a famous automobile trademark in its metatags if the dealer sold 
this brand of automobiles, but a pornography site could not use the same trademark, 
nor a dealer for a rival manufacturer. A Ford dealer would most likely be infringing 
if it used “Honda” in its metatags, but would not be infringing if it used “Ford” in its

metatags. (Ford Motor Company would be unlikely to seek an injunction against one 
of its dealers.)
In the Bernina of America, Inc. v. Fashion Fabrics Int’l, Inc. case, the court enjoined 
Fashion Fabrics, an independent dealer of sewing machines, from using the trade-
marks “Bernina” and “Bernette,” which belonged to the manufacturer Bernina, as 
metatags. The court found the defendant’s site contained misleading claims about 
Fashion Fabrics’ knowledge of Bernina products that were likely to confuse customers. 
The use of the Bernina trademarks as metatags per se was not a violation of ACPA, 
according to the court, but in combination with the misleading claims on the site 
would cause confusion and hence infringement (Bernina of America, Inc. v. Fashion 
Fabrics Int’l, Inc., 2001).
In the Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. v. Nissan Computer Corp. case, Uzi Nissan had used his 
surname “Nissan” as a trade name for various businesses since 1980, including Nissan 
Computer Corp. Nissan.com had no relationship with Nissan Motor, but over the years 
began selling auto parts that competed with Nissan Motor. The court ruled that Nissan 
Computer’s behavior did indeed infringe on Nissan Motor’s trademarks, but it refused 
to shut the site down. Instead, the court ruled Nissan Computer could continue to 
use the Nissan name and metatags, but must post notices on its site that it was not 
affiliated with Nissan Motor (Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. v. Nissan Computer Corp., 2000).
Keywording
The permissibility of using trademarks as keywords on search engines is also subtle 
and depends (1) on the extent to which such use is considered to be a “use in com-
merce” and causes “initial customer confusion” and (2) on the content of the search 
results.
In Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications, Inc., Playboy objected to 
the practice of Netscape’s and Excite’s search engines displaying banner ads unre-
lated to Playboy Magazine when users entered search arguments such as “playboy,” 
“playmate,” and “playgirl.” The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the defendant’s 
motion for a summary judgment and held that when an advertiser’s banner ad is not 
labeled so as to identify its source, the practice could result in trademark infringement 
due to consumer confusion (Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications, Inc., 
2004).
Google has also faced lawsuits alleging that its advertising network illegally 
exploits others’ trademarks. For instance, insurance company GEICO challenged 
Google’s practice of allowing competitors’ ads to appear when a searcher types “Geico” 
as the search query. A U.S. district court ruled that this practice did not violate federal 
trademark laws as long as the word “Geico” was not used in the ads’ text (Govern-
ment Employees Insurance Company v. Google, Inc., 2004). Google quickly discontinued 
allowing the latter, and settled the case (Associated Press, 2005). In July 2009, Rosetta 
Stone, the language-learning software firm, filed a lawsuit against Google for trademark 
infringement, alleging its AdWords program allowed other companies to use Rosetta 
Stone’s trademarks for online advertisements without permission. In April 2012, the 
4th Circuit Court of Appeals held that a jury might hold Google liable for trademark 
infringement, pointing to evidence that an internal Google study found that even 

586	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
sophisticated users were sometimes unaware that sponsored links were advertise-
ments. In November 2012, Rosetta Stone and Google settled, which was seen as a 
strategic win for Google because it eliminated one of the last major cases challenging 
the legitimacy of its AdWords program. Currently Google allows anyone to buy anyone 
else’s trademark as a keyword. In 2011, Microsoft decided to follow this practice as 
well with Bing and Yahoo Search.
Linking
Linking refers to building hypertext links from one site to another site. This is obvi-
ously a major design feature and benefit of the Web. Deep linking involves bypassing 
the target site’s home page and going directly to a content page. In Ticketmaster Corp. 
v. Tickets.com, Tickets.com—owned by Microsoft—competed directly against Ticket-
master in the events ticket market. When Tickets.com did not have tickets for an 
event, it would direct users to Ticketmaster’s internal pages, bypassing the Ticketmas-
ter home page. Even though its logo was displayed on the internal pages, Ticketmas-
ter objected on the grounds that such “deep linking” violated the terms and conditions 
of use for its site (stated on a separate page altogether and construed by Ticketmaster 
as equivalent to a shrink-wrap license), and constituted false advertising, as well as 
the violation of copyright. The court found, however, that deep linking per se is not 
illegal, no violation of copyright occurred because no copies were made, the terms 
and conditions of use were not obvious to users, and users were not required to read 
the page on which the terms and conditions of use appeared in any event. The court 
refused to rule in favor of Ticketmaster, but left open further argument on the licens-
ing issue. In an out-of-court settlement, Tickets.com nevertheless agreed to stop the 
practice of deep linking (Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com, 2000).
Framing
Framing involves displaying the content of another Web site inside your own Web 
site within a frame or window. The user never leaves the framer’s site and can be 
exposed to advertising while the target site’s advertising is distorted or eliminated. 
Framers may or may not acknowledge the source of the content. In The Washington 
Post, et al. v. TotalNews, Inc. case, The Washington Post Company, CNN, Reuters, and 
several other news organizations filed suit against TotalNews, Inc., claiming that Total-
News’s use of frames on its Web site, TotalNews.com, infringed upon the respective 
plaintiffs’ copyrights and trademarks, and diluted the content of their individual Web 
sites. The plaintiffs claimed additionally that TotalNews’s framing practice effectively 
deprived the plaintiffs’ Web sites of advertising revenue.
TotalNews’s Web site employed four frames. The TotalNews logo appeared in the 
lower left frame, various links were located in a vertical frame on the left side of the 
screen, TotalNews’s advertising was framed across the screen bottom, and the “news 
frame,” the largest frame, appeared in the center and right. Clicking on a specific 
news organization’s link allowed the reader to view the content of that particular 
organization’s Web site, including any related advertising, within the context of the 
“news frame.” In some instances, the framing distorted or modified the appearance

of the linked Web site, including the advertisements, while the appearance of Total-
News’s advertisements, in a separate frame, remained unchanged. In addition, the URL 
remained fixed on the TotalNews address, even though the content in the largest frame 
on the Web site was from the linked Web site. The “news frame” did not, however, 
eliminate the linked Web site’s identifying features.
The case was settled out of court. The news organizations allowed TotalNews to 
link to their Web sites, but prohibited framing and any attempt to imply affiliation with 
the news organizations (The Washington Post, et al. v. TotalNews, Inc., 1997).
CHALLENGE: BALANCING THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY WITH OTHER 
VALUES
The challenge in intellectual property ethics and law is to ensure that creators of 
intellectual property can receive the benefits of their inventions and works, while 
also making it possible for their works and designs to be disseminated and used by 
the widest possible audience. Protections from rampant theft of intellectual property 
inevitably lead to restrictions on distribution, and the payments to creators for the 
use of their works—which in itself can slow down the distribution process. Without 
these protections, however, and without the benefits that flow to creators of intellec-
tual property, the pace of innovation could decline. In the early years of e-commerce, 
up to 2005, the balance has been struck more toward Internet distributors and their 
claim to be free from restrictions on intellectual content, particularly music. Since the 
development of the iTunes store, smartphones, and tablets, after 2005, the balance has 
swung back toward content owners, largely because Internet distributors depend on 
high-quality content to attract audiences, but also partly due to the effectiveness of 
lawsuits in raising the costs to Internet firms that fail to protect intellectual property.
	 8.4	
GOVERNANCE
Governance has to do with social control: Who will control the Internet? Who will 
control the processes of e-commerce, the content, and the activities? What elements 
will be controlled, and how will the controls be implemented? A natural question 
arises and needs to be answered: Why do we as a society need to “control” e-com-
merce? Because e-commerce and the Internet are so closely intertwined (though not 
identical), controlling e-commerce also involves regulating the Internet.
CAN THE INTERNET BE CONTROLLED?
Early Internet advocates argued that the Internet was different from all previous tech-
nologies. They contended that the Internet could not be controlled, given its inherent 
decentralized design, its ability to cross borders, and its underlying packet-switching 
technology that made monitoring and controlling message content impossible. Many 
still believe this to be true today. The implication is that the content and behavior 
of e-commerce sites—indeed Internet sites of any kind—cannot be “controlled” in 
the same way. Content issues such as pornography, gambling, and offensive written 
governance
has to do with social 
control: who will control 
e-commerce, what 
elements will be controlled, 
and how will the controls 
be implemented

C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
expressions and graphics, along with commercial issue of intellectual property protec-
tion, ushered in the current era of growing governmental regulation of the Internet 
and e-commerce throughout the world. Currently, we are in a mixed-mode policy 
environment where self-regulation through a variety of Internet policy and technical 
bodies co-exists with limited government regulation (Stone, 2010). See Chapter 2 for a 
review of the different governing bodies involved in overseeing the Internet, including 
ICANN and IANA, and proposed changes in the United States’ authority over IANA 
(see pages 136–137).
In fact, as you learned in the Chapter 2 Insight on Society case, Government Regula-
tion and Surveillance of the Internet, the Internet is technically very easily controlled, 
monitored, and regulated from central locations (such as network access points, 
telecommunication firm or agency fiber trunk lines, as well as servers and routers 
throughout the network). For instance, in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, 
Thailand, Singapore, and many other countries, access to the Web is controlled from 
government-owned centralized routers that direct traffic across their borders and 
within the country (such as China’s “Great Firewall of China,” which permits the gov-
ernment to block access to certain U.S. or European Web sites), or via tightly regulated 
ISPs operating within the countries. In China, for instance, all ISPs need a license from 
the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), and are prohibited from disseminating 
any information that may harm the state or permit pornography, gambling, or the 
advocacy of cults. In addition, ISPs and search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and 
Bing typically self-censor their Asian content by using only government-approved 
news sources or, in the case of Google, exit the country altogether. Twitter is not plan-
ning any Chinese presence. China has also instituted regulations that require cafes, 
restaurants, hotels, and bookstores to install Web monitoring software that identifies 
those using wireless services and monitors Web activity. Because of the design of the 
Internet, a substantial part of global Internet traffic flows through U.S. telecommu-
nication facilities.
Following the outbreak of street demonstrations in 2009 protesting a rigged elec-
tion, the Iranian government unleashed one of the world’s most sophisticated mecha-
nisms for controlling and censoring the Web. Built with the assistance of Western 
companies like Siemens and Nokia, the system uses deep packet inspection to open 
every packet, look for keywords, reseal it, and send it on the network. In Great Britain, 
Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that he might temporarily block social 
network sites such as Facebook and Twitter during periods of social unrest such as 
the rioting that hit the country in 2011.
In the United States, as we have seen in our discussion of intellectual property, 
e-commerce sites can be put out of business for violating existing laws, and ISPs can 
be forced to “take down” offending or stolen content. Government security agencies 
such as the NSA and the FBI can obtain court orders to monitor ISP traffic and engage 
in widespread monitoring of millions of e-mail messages. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, 
American intelligence authorities are permitted to tap into whatever Internet traffic 
they believe is relevant to the campaign against terrorism, in some circumstances 
without judicial review. Working with the large ISP firms such as AT&T, Verizon, 
and others, U.S. security agencies have access to nearly all Internet communications

throughout the country. And many American corporations are developing restrictions 
on their employees’ at-work use of the Web to prevent gambling, shopping, and other 
activities not related to a business purpose.
In the United States, efforts to control media content on the Web have run up 
against equally powerful social and political values that protect freedom of expression, 
including several rulings by the Supreme Court that have struck down laws attempting 
to limit Web content in the United States. The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment 
says, “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” 
As it turns out, the 200-year-old Bill of Rights has been a powerful brake on efforts to 
control twenty-first-century online content.
TAXATION
Few questions illustrate the complexity of governance and jurisdiction more potently 
than taxation of e-commerce sales. In both Europe and the United States, governments 
rely on sales taxes based on the type and value of goods sold. In Europe, these taxes 
are collected along the entire value chain, including the final sale to the consumer, 
and are called “value-added taxes” (VAT). See the Insight on Business case, New Rules 
Extend EU Taxation of E-commerce, for a further look at this topic. In the United States,  
in contrast, taxes are collected by states and localities on final sales to consumers and 
are called consumption and use taxes. In the United States, there are 50 states, 3,000 
counties, and 12,000 municipalities, each with unique tax rates and policies. Cheese 
may be taxable in one state as a “snack food” but not taxable in another state (such 
as Wisconsin), where it is considered a basic food. Consumption taxes are generally 
recognized to be regressive because they disproportionately tax poorer people, for 
whom consumption is a larger part of total income.
Sales taxes were first implemented in the United States in the late 1930s as a 
Depression-era method of raising money for localities. Ostensibly, the money was to 
be used to build infrastructure such as roads, schools, and utilities to support business 
development, but over the years the funds have been used for general government 
purposes of the states and localities. In most states, there is a state-based sales tax, 
and a smaller local sales tax. The total sales tax ranges from zero in some states (North 
Dakota) to as much as 13% in New York City.
The development of “remote sales” such as mail order/telephone order (MOTO) 
retail in the United States in the 1970s broke the relationship between physical pres-
ence and commerce, complicating the plans of state and local tax authorities to tax 
all retail commerce. States sought to force MOTO retailers to collect sales taxes for 
them based on the address of the recipient, but Supreme Court decisions in 1967 and 
1992 established that states had no authority to force MOTO retailers to collect state 
taxes unless the businesses had a “nexus” of operations (physical presence) in the 
state. In 2015, the Supreme Court upheld a challenge to a Colorado law that would 
have required firms to report online sales to state residents as one step to ensure the 
residents paid taxes on Internet sales in Colorado, which is required by state law. But 
the court also stated that the premise of allowing Internet sales by out-of-state firms 
like Amazon to go untaxed in order to support Internet sales was no longer appropriate 
when e-commerce has exploded to a $531 billion market place (Liptakmarch, 2015).

The explosive growth of e-commerce, the latest type of “remote sales,” has once 
again raised the issue of how—and if—to tax remote sales. Since its inception, e-com-
merce has benefited from a tax subsidy of up to 13% for goods shipped to high sales-
tax areas. Local retail merchants have complained bitterly about the e-commerce tax 
subsidy. E-commerce merchants have argued that this form of commerce needs to 
be nurtured and encouraged, and that in any event, the crazy quilt of sales and use 
tax regimes would be difficult to administer for Internet merchants. Online giants 
like Amazon claim they should not have to pay taxes in states where they have no 
operations because they do not benefit from local schools, police, fire, and other gov-
ernmental services. State and local governments meanwhile see billions of tax dollars 
slipping from their reach. As Amazon’s business model has changed with its building 
of large distribution centers close to urban areas to enable next-day delivery, so has 
its opposition to paying sales taxes softened. 
In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which placed a morato-
rium on “multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce,” as well as on taxes 
on Internet access, for three years until October 2001. Since that time, the moratorium 
has been extended several times, most currently until December 11, 2015. In 2015, the 
House of Representatives passed a bill to permanently ban taxes on Internet access, 
but the legislation has not yet passed the Senate (Shrum, 2015). 
The taxation situation in Europe, and trade between Europe and the United States, 
is similarly complex. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), the economic policy coordinating body of European, American, and Japanese 
governments, is currently investigating different schemes for applying consumption 
and business profit taxes for digitally downloaded goods. The European Union began 
collecting a VAT on digital goods such as music and software delivered to consumers 
by foreign companies in 2003. Previously, E.U. companies were required to collect 
the VAT on sales to E.U. customers, but U.S. companies were not. This gave American 
companies a huge tax edge. European countries have other tax issues with Internet 
companies like Google, Apple, Yahoo, and others, that sell goods to consumers in one 
country, but book the sales in a low-tax country like Ireland.
NET NEUTRALITY
Net neutrality refers to the idea that Internet service providers (ISPs), including cable 
Internet and wireless carriers, should treat all data on the Internet in the same manner, 
and not discriminate or price differentially by content, protocol, platform, hardware, 
or application. Prior to February 2015, ISPs could discriminate against certain users 
on the basis of protocol or amount of usage. For instance, users of illegal downloading 
sites that utilize the BitTorrent protocol were blocked or throttled back (Internet speeds 
were slowed). Users who watched large volumes of movies on Netflix or other services 
were occasionally throttled back; wireless cellphone carriers choked off data speeds 
for heavy users when their networks became clogged; and large Internet services like 
Netflix and YouTube, that together consume an estimated 50% of the Internet’s band-
width in the United States, were encouraged to strike deals with ISPs and pay a higher 
fee than ordinary business or home users (Gryta, 2015a).

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
NEW RULES EXTEND EU TAXATION OF 
E-COMMERCE
Most people are happy when they 
discover they don’t have to pay any 
sales tax on a purchase they make 
online. However, few stop to consider 
the implications that this may have. Govern-
ments in the last few years have been suffering a 
persistent budget crunch. Many countries that levy 
sales taxes have been eyeing the lost revenue from 
e-commerce sales, estimated to be in the billions 
in 2015. As e-commerce establishes itself as an 
ever-increasing percentage of the retail economy, 
governments worldwide are putting their collective 
feet down and demanding tax revenue from all 
online transactions.
The EU and the United States have a com-
bined population of more than 800 million people. 
In both areas, the tax code is changing to reflect 
the new online landscape, where goods and ser-
vices are sold without a physical presence or 
local representative in the countries where they 
are purchased. In 2013, the EU standardized its 
tax collection practices for e-businesses, bringing 
them more in line with businesses that are not 
situated in the EU. 
In 2014, new EU regulations were imple-
mented that compelled companies providing online 
services to EU customers to collect a value-added 
tax, or VAT, regardless of whether the company 
has a physical presence in that area or not. The 
customer’s location is the determinant of whether 
the new EU rules apply. VAT was formerly due at 
the location of the sellers, but is now due at the 
location of the buyer. This was already the case for 
non-EU companies selling to EU B2C customers, 
but became policy for EU companies selling to EU 
B2C customers starting in 2015.
Having VAT due at the location of customers 
as opposed to the sellers’ location requires that 
EU-based businesses register in every EU country 
where their customers reside and charge VAT at 
local rates. Because non-EU businesses selling to 
EU customers are already subject to these regula-
tions, in 2015, the distinction between the two as 
far as VAT collection in EU countries vanished. 
Another option for these companies will be to 
register, electronically submit quarterly returns, 
and pay the full VAT (based on their customers’ 
residences) to one EU country. The VAT will then 
be distributed by that country as appropriate to 
the rest of the EU. Some analysts predict that 
Ireland will be a popular registration jurisdiction 
for this purpose.
These new rules have created some additional 
requirements to be followed by e-businesses that 
service the EU. These businesses will need to dis-
tinguish between B2C and B2B customers, classify 
customers by country of residence, begin charging 
VAT at variable rates depending upon where they 
are from, report and remit payment of VAT to 
individual countries, and create systems that avoid 
charging EU VAT to B2C customers outside the 
EU. Companies that fail to do all of these things 
would theoretically be tax evaders, and EU tax 
authorities should easily be able to discipline any 
offenders. Recognizing the issue, the European 
Commission announced its intention in 2015 to 
simplify VAT registration requirements and intro-
duce one single set of VAT reporting rules across 
the 28 member states in the EU, but that proposal 
has stalled as of late 2015, likely due to the dif-
fering needs and circumstances of the 28 member 
states of the EU.
The United States is one of the rare coun-
tries around the world that does not levy a VAT. 
State and local taxing jurisdictions are respon-
sible for their own taxes and there is no national 

592	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
sales tax. Also, sales taxes apply mostly to 
end consumers, not intermediaries such as the 
wholesalers and retailers themselves. Only five 
states do not currently levy sales taxes, and within 
those states, there are 7,600 taxing jurisdictions, 
each with its own set of rules. With the adjust-
ments to the EU’s tax collection procedures, it’s 
possible that the United States will follow suit at 
some point, perhaps as the result of pressure from 
retailers forced to navigate the confusing patch-
work of local regulations.
VAT standard percentages in EU countries 
vary from the high teens, such as in Germany, 
Luxembourg, and Malta, to the mid-twenties, such 
as in Sweden, Denmark, and Romania, though 
the reduced percentages are closer to 10% and 
below for certain goods and services. The major-
ity of countries have at least a 20% VAT, and 
the highest rate is Hungary’s 27%. The EU has 
also stipulated that wherever the Internet is used 
solely as a means of communication, this does 
not necessarily create a taxable good. However, 
whereas it was once the case in the United States 
that e-commerce businesses received special pro-
tections against taxation, the EU is considering 
adjusting its rate reductions to reflect the fact 
that digital information services may in some 
cases actually be more valuable than the direct 
equivalent of traditional products. For example, 
e-books have search facilities, hyperlinks, and 
archives, and should perhaps not be sold with a 
steeply reduced VAT rate. The EU has also sim-
plified VAT compliance by creating a “distance 
selling” threshold for companies—if companies 
do not cross the sales threshold, they can use local 
taxation rates as opposed to the rates in places 
where they seldom send goods. This reduces the 
regulatory burden of dealing with VAT compli-
ance and administration in those countries. More 
countries even outside the EU are toying with 
adding VAT, including Mexico, the Bahamas, and 
many more.
For many smaller online businesses, the regu-
latory costs involved in compliance with 28 coun-
tries in the EU with 75 different VAT rates are a 
major concern. There is no minimum threshold of 
sales in place to protect smaller companies from 
burdensome data management costs. Business 
owners have bristled at the changes. For example, 
many of the approximately 34,000 small online 
business owners in England have rallied behind the 
Twitter hashtag #VATMESS in protest, continu-
ing throughout 2015 as businesses have submitted 
their first few returns under the new system.
Other countries outside the EU and the United 
States are also grappling with the issue of e-com-
merce taxes. In China, the Chinese government is 
working to create new VAT laws that balance the 
needs of local and central governments. And some 
academics are even suggesting the possibility of a 
global tax on cross-border e-commerce, with the 
funds used to finance global public goods.

ISPs had long opposed the idea of net neutrality. ISPs claimed they needed to be 
able to manage the loads on their networks to ensure stable service, without blackouts 
or slow downs. Throttling back heavy users was necessary to manage network load. 
They also argued that heavy individual or business users should pay more than the 
average user at home who uses the Web for e-mail, Web surfing, and e-commerce, all 
of which do not require a lot of bandwidth. More to the point, the ISPs claimed the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not have the authority to regulate 
ISPs because ISPs were not defined by the FCC as common carriers like traditional 
telephone companies. ISPs instead were classified in FCC regulations of the 1990s as 
information services in large part because the Internet, at that time, was considered 
to be a innovative provider of information that should be nurtured and not interfered 
with or regulated by the FCC. The Internet then was just not that important to the 
operation of society. 
This view ended on February 15, 2015, when the FCC ruled that Internet broad-
band service providers really should be viewed as public utilities similar to telephone 
companies, and therefore should be regulated by the FCC in order to ensure fair access 
to all, deployment of acceptable broadband service levels, and competition among 
providers. This change reflected the fact that the Internet had evolved by 2015 into 
one of the primary telecommunications services in the country, and world, necessary 
to the everyday life of millions of people, businesses, and governments, and therefore 
a common carrier vital to the operation of society (just like a railroad service). The 
FCC was created by the Communications Act of 1934 to regulate telegraph and radio, 
and then later added regulation of television, satellite, and cable in all states. The FCC 
also overruled state laws that made it difficult for cities to operate their own broadband 
networks. In this way, a decades-long debate over net neutrality moved a step towards 
resolution. The ruling does not provide for regulation of ISP pricing, which remains 
in the hands of the ISPs (Gryta, 2015b). 
However, the debate over net neutrality is not totally yet over. The large telecom-
munications carriers are preparing legal challenges to the FCC ruling. In the past, 
the courts themselves have not agreed on the idea that ISPs should be regulated as 
common carriers, or that the FCC should interfere with the management of provider 
networks. Yet there is strong public support for regulation of ISPs to ensure faster 
broadband deployment, more competition to reduce prices, and service level improve-
ments. Popular services like Netflix publicly supported the FCC decision as a win for 
consumers (Ruiz, 2015)

PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELFARE
Governments everywhere claim to pursue public safety, health, and welfare. This 
effort produces laws governing everything from weights and measures to national 
highways, to the content of radio and television programs. Electronic media of all 
kinds (telegraph, telephone, radio, and television) have historically been regulated by 
governments seeking to develop a rational commercial telecommunications environ-
ment and to control the content of the media—which may be critical of government or

offensive to powerful groups in a society. Historically, in the United States, newspapers 
and print media have been beyond government controls because of constitutional 
guarantees of freedom of speech. Electronic media such as radio and television have, 
on the other hand, always been subject to content regulation because they use the 
publicly owned frequency spectrum. Telephones have also been regulated as public 
utilities and “common carriers,” with special social burdens to provide service and 
access, but with no limitations on content.
In the United States, critical issues in e-commerce center around the protection 
of children, strong sentiments against pornography in any public media, efforts to 
control gambling, and the protection of public health through restricting sales of drugs 
and cigarettes.
PROTECTING CHILDREN
Pornography is an immensely successful Internet business. Statistics with respect to 
revenues generated by online pornography range widely. Reports of Web traffic to 
pornography sites constituting 30% of all Web traffic are likely not true and have no 
solid foundation. A sample of the million most-visited sites in the world found that 4% 
of the Web sites contained pornographic material, and 14% of Web searches involved 
sexual content (Ward, 2013). Online pornography is estimated to generate $10 to $12 
billion annually in the United States, and the global revenue is estimated to be $97 
billion. Traditional DVD porn revenues have fallen off by 80% as so-called tube sites 
(YouTube for porn) have rapidly expanded with free and freemium content online. 
Piracy is rampant as with traditional video content. Revenues are now primarily 
derived from premium subscriptions and advertising. 
To control the Web as a distribution medium for pornography, in 1996, the U.S. 
Congress passed the Communications Decency Act (CDA). This act made it a felony 
criminal offense to use any telecommunications device to transmit “any comment, 
request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communications which is obscene, 
lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent” to anyone, and in particular, to persons under 
18 years of age (Section 502, Communications Decency Act of 1996). In 1997, the 
Supreme Court struck down most of the CDA as an unconstitutional abridgement of 
freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. While the government argued 
the CDA was like a zoning ordinance designed to allow “adult” Web sites for people 18 
years of age or over, the Court found the CDA was a blanket proscription on content 
and rejected the “cyberzoning” argument as impossible to administer. One section 
of the CDA that did survive scrutiny, Section 230, provides immunity for providers 
and users of interactive computer services (such as ISPs and Web sites) from being 
considered a publisher that might be liable for harmful content posted by others. This 
is the law that allows social networks, blogs, and online bulletin boards to operate 
without fear of being held liable for online defamation or libel. In 2002, the Supreme 
Court struck down another law, the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, which 
made it a crime to create, distribute, or possess “virtual” child pornography that uses 
computer-generated images or young adults rather than real children, as overly broad 
(Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition). The Children’s Online Protection Act (COPA) of 
1998 met with a similar fate.

In 2001, Congress passed the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which 
requires schools and libraries in the United States to install “technology protection 
measures” (filtering software) in an effort to shield children from pornography. In June 
2003, the Supreme Court upheld CIPA, overturning a federal district court that found 
the law interfered with the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of expression. 
The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 opinion, held that the law’s limitations on access to the 
Internet posed no more a threat to freedom of expression than limitations on access 
to books that librarians choose for whatever reason not to acquire. The dissenting 
justices found this analogy inappropriate and instead argued the proper analogy was 
if librarians were to purchase encyclopedias and then rip out pages they thought were 
or might be offensive to patrons. All the justices agreed that existing blocking software 
was overly blunt, unable to distinguish child pornography from sexually explicit mate-
rial (which is protected by the First Amendment), and generally unreliable (Green-
house, 2003b). Other legislation such as the 2002 Domain Names Act seeks to prevent 
unscrupulous Web site operators from luring children to pornography using misleading 
domain names or characters known to children. A plan to create an .xxx domain for 
adult Web site content was approved by ICANN in June 2010, and in September 2011, 
limited registration for .xxx domains began. Trademark holders who do not wish their 
brand to be associated with an .xxx domain can block requests by other companies for 
domain names that include their brand name. The 2003 Protect Act is an omnibus law 
intended to prevent child abuse that includes prohibitions against computer-generated 
child pornography. Part of that statute was previously held to be unconstitutional by 
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, but in May 2008, the Supreme Court reversed 
the circuit court and upheld the provision (Greenhouse, 2008).
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (1998) prohibits Web sites 
from collecting information on children under the age of 13. It does permit such data 
collection if parental consent is obtained. Because COPPA does not interfere with 
speech or expression, it has not been challenged in the courts. However, since 1998, 
entirely new technologies like social networks, online tracking, advertising networks, 
online gaming, and mobile apps have appeared that are now being used to gather data 
on children and which were not specifically addressed in COPPA or FTC regulations. 
Responding to these changes in technology and public pressure, the FTC announced 
a new set of rules that are now in effect. The new rules prohibit online tracking of 
children across the Web with cookies or any other technology such as persistent iden-
tifiers; prohibit ad networks from following children across the Web and advertising to 
them without parental consent; make clear that mobile devices are subject to COPPA, 
including games and software apps; and make clear that third-party data collection 
firms that collect data on Web sites are responsible for any unlawful data collection. 
Search engines and ISPs also have a role to play in eliminating child pornography 
from the Web. The Internet Watch Foundation is a private non-profit organization 
based in the United Kingdom whose mission is to eliminate child pornography from 
the Web, and has over 200 corporate members from the Internet technology com-
munity (IWF.org, 2015). In 2015, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter joined 
together and are using the Internet Watch Foundation’s hash list to remove abusive 
child images from their services. Other companies working with the Internet Watch 
Foundation include Cisco, Blackberry, Dropbox, and PayPal (Lien, 2015). See the

Networks, for more information.
CIGARETTES, GAMBLING, AND DRUGS: IS THE WEB REALLY BORDERLESS?
In the United States and the around the world, governments have adopted legislation 
to control certain activities and products in order to protect public health and welfare. 
Cigarettes, gambling, medical drugs, and of course addictive recreational drugs, are 
either banned or tightly regulated (see Insight on Society: The Internet Drug Bazaar Oper-
ates Around the Globe). Yet these products and services are ideal for distribution over 
the Internet through e-commerce sites. Because the sites can be located offshore, they 
can operate beyond the jurisdiction of state and federal prosecutors. Or so it seemed 
until recently. In the case of cigarettes, state and federal authorities have been quite 
successful in shutting down tax-free cigarette Web sites within the United States by 
pressuring PayPal and credit card firms to drop cigarette merchants from their systems. 
The major shipping companies—UPS, FedEx, and DHL—have been pressured into 
refusing shipment of untaxed cigarettes. Philip Morris has also agreed not to ship 
cigarettes to any resellers that have been found to be engaging in illegal Internet and 
mail order sales. However, a few off-shore Web sites continue to operate using checks 
and money orders as payments and the postal system as a logistics partner, but their 
level of business has plummeted as consumers fear state tax authorities will present 
them with huge tax bills if they are discovered using these sites. In 2010, President 
Obama signed the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act. The law restricts the sale of 
untaxed cigarettes and other tobacco products over the Internet and bans the delivery 
of tobacco products through the U.S. mail.
Gambling also provides an interesting example of the clash between traditional 
jurisdictional boundaries and claims to a borderless, uncontrollable Web. The online 
gambling market, based almost entirely offshore—primarily in the United Kingdom 
and various Caribbean Islands—grew by leaps and bounds between 2000 and 2006, 
with much of the action (some estimate up to 50%) coming from customers based 
in the United States. Online gambling is still banned in most of the United States 
even though the global market is now a $25 billion dollar business, almost entirely 
offshore, and roughly one-third the size of the entire U.S. gambling business (about 
$69 billion, including lotteries and public gambling) (O’Keefe, 2014). U.S. casino gam-
bling in 2014 generated an estimated $38 billion. Congress initially outlawed online 
gambling and the payment systems including credit cards used to support it in 2006 
(the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 and the Wire Act) and the 
U.S. Department of Justice enforced the law vigorously, denying offshore operators 
access to American payment systems, crippling their U.S. business, and arresting 
several executives. However, the mood has changed in the last five years. State revenue 
needs have grown, and many in the casino gambling industry have switched sides and 
now support online gambling, seeing it as a revenue growth opportunity. The federal 
government has also changed its position and reversed its stance against Internet 
gambling, removing a major obstacle for states (Wyatt, 2011). The ethical issues sur-
rounding online gambling may have less influence on the public debate than the need 
for new tax revenues, and for firms, the hope for additional revenues.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE INTERNET DRUG BAZAAR OPERATES 
AROUND THE GLOBE
In June 2015, Interpol announced the 
latest round of arrests and seizures as 
part of its Operation Pangea effort to 
combat sales of illegal drugs online. The 
operation seized 20 million illegal medicines, 
worth more than $81 million; shut down 2,414 
fake online pharmacies; removed 550 advertise-
ments from social media; and resulted in 156 
arrests. Despite successes such as this, however, the 
Internet drug bazaar, operated by rogue Internet 
drug outlets, remains a continuing public health 
and safety issue. According to a study done by the 
Treatment Research Institute at the University of 
Pennsylvania, addictive and potentially lethal med-
ications are available without prescription from 
more than 2 million Web sites around the world, 
with many sites based in countries that impose 
little if any regulation on pharmaceuticals. A 
Google search on “drugs no prescription” in 2015 
returns more than 49 million results. 
The International Narcotics Control Board, 
a U.N. narcotics watchdog agency, has provided 
guidelines and a framework for governments 
struggling to contain growing abuse of prescrip-
tion drugs on the Internet. According to the report, 
only two of 365 so-called Internet pharmacies it 
surveyed were legitimate. In many countries, the 
report said, trafficking in illegal prescription drugs 
now equals or exceeds the sale of heroin, cocaine, 
and amphetamines. While properly regulated 
Internet pharmacies offer a valuable service by 
increasing competition and access to treatments 
in underserved regions, Web pharmacies are a long 
way from proper regulation. 
The sale of drugs without a prescription is not 
the only danger posed by the Internet drug bazaar. 
Rogue online pharmacy sites may be selling coun-
terfeit drugs or unapproved drugs. For instance, in 
the past, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has issued warnings that a number of con-
sumers who had purchased Ambien, Xanax, and 
Lexapro online had instead received a product con-
taining haloperial, a powerful anti-psychotic drug. 
Drug pushers on the Internet also include legitimate 
pharmaceutical firms who have discovered search 
engine advertising. Google and other search engines 
have come under fire for its relationships with pur-
veyors of illegal drugs and other unlawful products 
like stolen credit cards and fake IDs. In 2014, 
Google announced a settlement in a shareholder 
lawsuit over accusations that it had allowed adver-
tising from illegal drug sellers outside the United 
States. As part of the settlement, Google agreed to 
allocate $50 million per year to an internal effort to 
sever ties with and disrupt the operations of illegal 
online pharmacies. In 2015, Bing agreed to partner 
with the FDA to display warnings next to links to 
Web sites listed as illegal pharmacies. 
Despite these dangers, online pharmacies 
remain alluring and are one of the fastest growing 
business models with, oddly, senior citizens—usually 
some of the most law-abiding citizens—leading the 
charge for cheaper drugs. In 2015, the most popular 
fake drug is the erectile dysfunction medication 
Viagra.  The main attraction of online drug sites 
is price. Typically, online pharmacies are located in 
countries where prescription drugs are price-con-
trolled, or where the price structure is much lower, 
such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and European 
countries, as well as India and Mexico. Citizens can 
save quite a bit of money by purchasing from online 
pharmacies located in other countries.
Another haven for online purveyors of illegal 
drugs is the “Dark” or “Deep” Web, which con-

sists of sites that are not accessible by search 
engines and often feature security measures 
designed to allow complete anonymity or to 
mask illegal activity. In the past, the most promi-
nent online drug marketplace on the Deep Web was 
the Silk Road, which was estimated to attract as 
much as $45 million a year in illegal drug pur-
chases and $1.2 billion worth of total transactions. 
The Silk Road required users to run the Tor ano-
nymity software and accepted the virtual currency 
Bitcoin (see the Insight on Business case Bitcoin in 
Chapter 4), allowing online drug buyers an unprec-
edented level of protection. The Silk Road was not 
so much a pharmacy as it is a sort of eBay for 
illegal drugs. But in 2013, the Silk Road’s founder 
and chief operator, a shadowy figure formerly 
known as “Dread Pirate Roberts,” was revealed 
to be a former Eagle Scout named Ross Ulbricht 
and was arrested and charged with drug traffick-
ing and money laundering. U.S. federal agents also 
seized $33.6 million in Bitcoins from Ulbricht.
While law enforcement agencies have had 
some successes with sites like the Silk Road, tra-
ditional illegal pharmacies continue to proliferate. 
Although the Silk Road may be gone, its popularity 
proved that there is a demand for a clandestine 
drug marketplace, and its successors only need to 
imitate the Silk Road’s business model, except for 
the part where they grow too large for their own 
good. Many subsequent Silk Road-style market-
places have opened and closed within the past year, 
including Silk Road 2.0, Sheep Marketplace, and 
Agora. In 2013, the EU released a report detailing 
the increase in number and availability of illegal 
drugs in the EU and beyond. Citing globalization, 
technology advances, and the Internet as primary 
causes, the report noted that the illicit drug market 
has become increasingly dynamic and innovative, 
and that Europe has become a major drug produc-
tion hub. Although cocaine comes primarily from 
the Andes and is smuggled into Europe, Europe is 
now one of the world’s biggest methamphetamines 
and cannabis producers. A 2014 follow-up report 
raised continued concerns over the increasingly 
global drug marketplace.
These reports also suggest that drug regula-
tion enforcement needs to adapt with the times. 
As e-commerce brings down global borders, the 
need for a global strategy as opposed to individual 
countries and a patchwork of enforcement strat-
egies has grown. A 2013 report from the Inter-
national Centre for Science in Drug Policy went 
even further, suggesting that the war on drugs 
as we know it has failed. The Centre found that 
the average price of opiates and cocaine have 
decreased by 74% and 51%, respectively, between 
1990 and 2010, and that these drugs had become 
much more potent in that time. Among the alterna-
tive approaches recommended by the report were 
decriminalization and strict legal regulation, and 
emphasizing the problem as a public health issue 
as opposed to a criminal justice issue. Skeptics of 
this strategy insist that drugs are illegal because 
they are dangerous and a threat to society.

In June 2012, Delaware became the first state to legalize online gambling in all its 
forms (Berzo, 2012), and three others have followed: Nevada, New Jersey and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. In 2015, seven states are considering bills that would legalize online 
gambling: California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, 
and Washington (National Conference of State Legislators, 2015). 
In 2013, Station Casinos, a local Las Vegas company, opened the nation’s first legal, 
pay-to-play poker Web site. The site claims it can use geo-location technology to ensure 
that the players are in the State of Nevada and over the age of 21, a condition of its 
operation insofar as the federal government does not yet permit online poker whereas 
it is legal in Nevada and supported by the large casinos as an extension of their brands. 
However, so far, legal online gambling has disappointed expectations: New Jersey 
expected to make $160 million in state revenue from online gambling in 2014, but 
had collected only $9 million by June 2014, in part because of the recession. While 
online gambling sputters along in a slow-growth economy, fantasy sports and betting 
is exploding. Two firms dominate the online fantasy sports market: DraftKings and 
FanDuel. Both firms advertise heavily during college and professional sports games. 
In fantasy sports, players assemble their ideal fantasy teams, drafting real-life athletes 
to their team, and then, based on the performance of those players in real games, they 
can win significant prizes. The most popular sports are college football and basketball, 
and professional football and baseball. Players are given a budget that they can use 
to draft players, and some of the combined fees for each game make up the pool for 
which players compete. Entry fees range widely from less than a dollar, to over $1,000 
(Belson, 2015). DraftKings claims that several winner prizes have exceeded $1 million 
although none of the sites publish a list of winners. 
Fantasy sports games are permitted in 45 states. Fantasy sports were exempted 
from the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) under indus-
try pressure from the then much smaller fantasy sports business. The industry argued 
that fantasy sports are not gambling, but instead games of skill like chess or Scrabble. 
As the industry has grown to billion-dollar venture capital valuations, however, and 
with allegations of cheating customers, deceptive practices, lack of transparency, and 
insider irregularities, state and federal legislators are holding hearings and considering 
regulations (Russo, 2015; Drape, 2015). In November 2015, New York State attorney 
general Eric Schneiderman told both DraftKings and FanDuel to stop taking entries 
from New York State residents because, in the state’s opinion, their operations con-
stitute illegal gambling.

Searching for a Safe Haven
T
he Pirate Bay (TPB), for years, has been one of the world’s best-known 
and most popular pirated music and content sites, offering free access 
to millions of copyrighted songs and thousands of copyrighted Hol-
lywood movies, television shows, and video games. This despite the 
fact that TPB has been subjected to repeated legal efforts to shut it down. In fact, the 
authorities pursuing TPB must feel as if they are engaged in a never-ending game of 
Whack-a-mole, as each time they “whack” TPB, it somehow manages to reappear. But 
the battle is far from over, and for the first time, it appears possible that the “good guys” 
are actually winning. The Internet is becoming a tough place for music and video 
pirates to make a living in part because of enforcement actions, but more importantly 
because of new mobile and wireless technologies that enable high-quality content to 
be streamed for just a small fee.
TPB is part of a European social and political movement that opposes copyrighted 
content and demands that music, videos, TV shows, and other digital content be free 
and unrestricted. TPB does not operate a database of copyrighted content. Neither

does it operate a network of computers owned by “members” who store the content, 
nor does it create, own, or distribute software (like BitTorrent and most other so-called 
P2P networks) that permits such networks to exist in the first place. Instead, TPB 
simply provides a search engine that responds to user queries for music tracks, or 
specific movie titles, and generates a list of search results that include P2P networks 
around the world where the titles can be found. By clicking on a selected link, users 
gain access to the copyrighted content, but only after downloading software and other 
files from that P2P network.
TPB claims it is merely a search engine providing pointers to existing P2P net-
works that it does not itself control. It says that it cannot control what content users 
ultimately find on those P2P networks, and that it is no different from any other search 
engine, such as Google or Bing, which are not held responsible for the content found 
on sites listed in search results. From a broader standpoint, TPB’s founders also claim 
that copyright laws in general unjustly interfere with the free flow of information on 
the Internet, and that in any event, they were not violating Swedish copyright law, 
which they felt should be the only law that applied. And they further claimed they 
did not encourage, incite, or enable illegal downloading. Nevertheless, the defendants 
have never denied that theirs was a commercial enterprise. Despite all the talk calling 
for the free, unfettered spread of culture, TPB was a money-making operation from 
the beginning, designed to produce profits for its founders, with advertising as the 
primary source of revenue.
However, the First Swedish Court in Stockholm declared TPB’s four founders 
guilty of violating Swedish copyright law, and sentenced each to one year in prison 
and payment of $3.5 million in restitution to the plaintiffs, all Swedish divisions of 
the major record firms (Warner Music, Sony, and EMI Group among them). The court 
found that the defendants had incited copyright infringement by providing a Web site 
with search functions, easy uploading and storage possibilities, and a tracker. The 
court also said that the four defendants had been aware of the fact that copyrighted 
material was shared with the help of their site and that the defendants were engaged 
in a commercial enterprise, the basis of which was encouraging visitors to violate the 
copyrights of owners. In fact, the primary purpose of TPB was to violate copyrights 
in order to make money for the owners (commercial intent).
Meanwhile, the U.S. government pressured the Swedish government to strengthen 
its copyright laws to discourage rampant downloading. In Sweden, downloading music 
and videos from illegal sites was very popular, engaged in by 43% of the Swedish Inter-
net population. To strengthen its laws, Sweden adopted the European Union conven-
tion on copyrights, which allows content owners to receive from Internet providers the 
names and addresses of people suspected of sharing pirated files. In France, partici-
pating in these pirate sites will result in banishment from the Internet for up to three 
years. As a result, Internet traffic in Sweden declined by 40%, and has stayed there.
TPB has appealed the court judgment and has not paid any fines. That doesn’t 
mean that TPB has not been affected by the lawsuits, however. In 2011, the firm moved 
its servers into caves in Sweden, and dispersed multiple copies of its program to other 
countries. In response to the lawsuits, police raids, and confiscation of servers, TPB has 
had stints in France, Finland, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, the U.K., and Greece

within the last few years. These countries have in some cases refused to allow Inter-
net service providers in their countries to host or link to TPB, no matter where in the 
world its servers are located. In 2013, authorities shut down TPB’s top-level domains in 
Sweden, Greenland, and Iceland, but TPB has continued to try to operate by hopping 
from country to country, moving to Sint Maarten, to tiny Ascension Island, to Peru, 
and back again to Sweden. In 2014, TPB proved as elusive as ever for law enforcement, 
although co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg began serving a 42-month term in prison 
in Denmark for both copyright infringement and computer crimes unrelated to TPB, 
co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested after years on the run, and served a five-month 
prison term for copyright violation, and Fredrik Neij, another co-founder, was arrested 
in Thailand, then transferred to Swedish custody to serve a 10-month prison sentence. 
In 2014, the company’s financial resources also began to run dry. As interest continued 
to accrue on financial penalties previously levied on TPB, Carl Lundstrom, the site’s 
primary financial backer, declared bankruptcy. 
However, TPB continued to operate in 2014, until December 9th, when Swedish 
police again raided the site and shut it down. The site remained offline for seven 
weeks, until January 2015, the longest period of time it had ever been shut down. 
Members of the hacker group Anonymous claim it is now in fact an FBI honeypot 
designed to trap the unwary, and its number of visitors has dropped precipitously. 
Even if rumors about the FBI are not true, many believe that it is not a good idea to use 
TPB anymore for other reasons: the site is now riddled with ads containing malware 
and it frequently goes offline. Even one of its original co-founders, Peter Sunde, has 
recommended that the site shut down once and for all. Nonetheless, TPB lives on.
TPB has caused a number of countries, including England, France, Malaysia, 
Finland, and the United States, to consider strong intellectual property protection laws 
that will prevent domestic search engines and ISPs from linking to infringing sites, 
or resolving their domain names. In addition, the world’s largest advertising agency, 
GroupM, has put TPB and 2,000 other sites on its blacklist of copyright infringing sites 
on which it will not buy advertising space. 
The record industry’s struggle against TPB is just part of the battle that it has been 
waging for some time. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in the ground-breaking Metro-
Goldwyn Mayer v. Grokster, et al. case that the original peer-to-peer file sharing services, 
such as Grokster, Kazaa, and StreamCast, could be held liable for copyright infringe-
ment, because they had intentionally sought to encourage users to share copyrighted 
material. All of these services have since gone out of business. But these legal victories, 
and stronger government enforcement of copyright laws, have not proven to be the 
magic bullet that miraculously solves all the problems facing the music industry. The 
music industry has had to drastically change its business model and decisively move 
toward digital distribution platforms. They have made striking progress, and sales of 
music in a purely digital format now account for more revenue than sales of music in 
a physical format. To do so, the music industry has employed a number of different 
business models and online delivery platforms, including Apple’s iTunes pay-per-
download model, subscription models, and cloud-based streaming models.
In each of these new media delivery platforms, the copyright owners—record 
companies, artists, and Hollywood studios—have struck licensing deals with the tech-

nology platform owners and distributors (Apple, Amazon, and Google). These new 
platforms offer a win-win solution. Consumers benefit by having near instant access 
to high-quality music tracks and videos without the hassle of P2P software downloads. 
Content owners get a growing revenue stream and protection for their copyrighted 
content. And the pirates? TPB and other pirate sites may not be able to compete with 
new and better ways to listen to music and view videos. Like the real pirates of the 
Caribbean, who are now just a footnote in history books, technology and consumer 
preference for ease of use may leave them behind.
Case Study Questions
1.	 Why did TPB believe it was not violating copyright laws? What did the Swedish 
court rule?
2.	 How has TPB managed to continue operating despite being found in violation of 
copyright laws?
3.	 How has the music industry reacted to the problems created by pirates like TPB?

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand why e-commerce raises ethical, social, and political issues.
•	
Internet technology and its use in e-commerce disrupts existing social and business relationships and 
understandings. Suddenly, individuals, business firms, and political institutions are confronted by new 
possibilities of behavior for which understandings, laws, and rules of acceptable behavior have not yet 
been developed. Many business firms and individuals are benefiting from the commercial development 
of the Internet, but this development also has costs for individuals, organizations, and societies. These 
costs and benefits must be carefully considered by those seeking to make ethical and socially responsible 
decisions in this new environment, particularly where there are as yet no clear-cut legal or cultural 
guidelines.
•	
The major issues raised by e-commerce can be loosely categorized into four major dimensions:
•	
Information rights—What rights do individuals have to control their own personal information when 
Internet technologies make information collection so pervasive and efficient?
•	
Property rights—How can traditional intellectual property rights be enforced when perfect copies of 
protected works can be made and easily distributed worldwide via the Internet?
•	
Governance—Should the Internet and e-commerce be subject to public laws? If so, what law-making 
bodies have jurisdiction—state, federal, and/or international?
•	
Public safety and welfare—What efforts should be undertaken to ensure equitable access to the Inter-
net and e-commerce channels? Do certain online content and activities pose a threat to public safety 
and welfare?
•	
Ethical, social, and political controversies usually present themselves as dilemmas. Ethical dilemmas can 
be analyzed via the following process:
•	
Identify and clearly describe the facts.
•	
Define the conflict or dilemma and identify the higher-order values involved.

604	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c s ,  L a w ,  a n d  E - c o m m e r c e 
•	
Identify the stakeholders.
•	
Identify the options that you can reasonably take.
•	
Identify the potential consequences of your options.
•	
Refer to well-established ethical principles, such as the Golden Rule, Universalism, the Slippery 
Slope, the Collective Utilitarian Principle, Risk Aversion, the No Free Lunch Rule, the New York 
Times Test, and the Social Contract Rule to help you decide the matter.
Understand basic concepts related to privacy and information rights, the practices of e-commerce companies that 
threaten privacy, and the different methods that can be used to protect online privacy.
•	
To understand the issues concerning online privacy, you must first understand some basic concepts:
•	
Privacy is the moral right of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or interference from 
others.
•	
Information privacy includes both the claim that certain information should not be collected at all by 
governments or business firms, and the claim of individuals to control the use of information about 
themselves.
•	
Due process as embodied by the Fair Information Practices doctrine, informed consent, and opt-in/
opt-out policies also plays an important role in privacy.
•	
Almost all e-commerce companies collect some personally identifiable information in addition to anony-
mous information and use cookies to track clickstream behavior of visitors. Advertising networks and 
search engines also track the behavior of consumers across thousands of popular sites, not just at one 
site, via cookies, spyware, search engine behavioral targeting, and other techniques.
•	
There are a number of different methods used to protect online privacy. They include:
•	
Legal protections deriving from constitutions, common law, federal law, state laws, and government 
regulations. In the United States, rights to online privacy may be derived from the U.S. Constitution, 
tort law, federal laws such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Federal 
Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practice principles, and a variety of state laws. In Europe, the 
European Commission’s Data Protection Directive has standardized and broadened privacy protec-
tion in the European Union nations.
•	
Industry self-regulation via industry alliances, such as the Online Privacy Alliance and the Network 
Advertising Initiative, that seek to gain voluntary adherence to industry privacy guidelines and safe 
harbors. Some firms also hire chief privacy officers.
•	
Privacy-enhancing technological solutions include spyware and pop-up blockers, secure e-mail, 
anonymous remailers, anonymous surfing, cookie managers, disk file-erasing programs, policy gen-
erators, and public key encryption programs.
Understand the various forms of intellectual property and the challenges involved in protecting it.
•	
Copyright law protects original forms of expression such as writings, drawings, and computer programs 
from being copied by others for a minimum of 70 years. It does not protect ideas—just their expression in 
a tangible medium. Copyrights, like all rights, are not absolute. The doctrine of fair use permits certain 
parties under certain circumstances to use copyrighted material without permission. The Digital Millen-
nium Copyright Act (DMCA) was the first major effort to adjust copyright law to the Internet age. The 
DMCA implements a World Intellectual Property Organization treaty, which declares it illegal to make, 
distribute, or use devices that circumvent technology-based protections of copyrighted materials, and 
attaches stiff fines and prison sentences for violations.
•	
Patent law grants the owner of a patent an exclusive monopoly to the ideas behind an invention for 20 
years. Patents are very different from copyrights in that they protect the ideas themselves and not merely 
the expression of ideas. There are four types of inventions for which patents are granted under patent 

	
R e v i e w 	

605
law: machines, man-made products, compositions of matter, and processing methods. In order to be 
granted a patent, the applicant must show that the invention is new, original, novel, nonobvious, and not 
evident in prior arts and practice. Most of the inventions that make the Internet and e-commerce possible 
were not patented by their inventors. This changed in the mid-1990s with the commercial development 
of the World Wide Web. Business firms began applying for “business methods” and software patents.
•	
Trademark protections exist at both the federal and state levels in the United States. The purpose of trade-
mark law is twofold. First, trademark law protects the public in the marketplace by ensuring that it gets 
what it pays for and wants to receive. Second, trademark law protects the owner who has spent time, 
money, and energy bringing the product to market against piracy and misappropriation. Federal trade-
marks are obtained, first, by use in interstate commerce, and second, by registration with the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office (USPTO). Trademarks are granted for a period of 10 years and can be renewed 
indefinitely. Use of a trademark that creates confusion with existing trademarks, causes consumers to 
make market mistakes, or misrepresents the origins of goods is an infringement. In addition, the inten-
tional misuse of words and symbols in the marketplace to extort revenue from legitimate trademark own-
ers (“bad faith”) is proscribed. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) creates civil 
liabilities for anyone who attempts in bad faith to profit from an existing famous or distinctive trademark 
by registering an Internet domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to, or “dilutive” of, that 
trademark. The major behaviors on the Internet that have run afoul of trademark law include cybersquat-
ting, cyberpiracy, metatagging, keywording, linking, and framing.
Understand how the Internet is governed and why taxation of e-commerce raises governance and jurisdiction issues.
•	
Governance has to do with social control: who will control e-commerce, what elements will be controlled, 
and how will those controls be implemented. We are currently in a mixed-mode policy environment 
where self-regulation, through a variety of Internet policy and technical bodies, co-exists with limited 
government regulation.
•	
E-commerce raises the issue of how—and if—to tax remote sales. The national and international charac-
ter of Internet sales has wreaked havoc on taxation schemes in the United States that were built in the 
1930s and based on local commerce and local jurisdictions. E-commerce has benefited from a tax subsidy 
since its inception. E-commerce merchants have argued that this new form of commerce needs to be 
nurtured and encouraged, and that in any event, the crazy quilt of sales and use tax regimes would be 
difficult to administer for Internet merchants. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, 
which placed a moratorium on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, and any taxa-
tion of Internet access, and since that time has extended the moratorium several times, most recently 
until December 2015. Federal legislation to implement a uniform set of rules for collecting taxes on 
e-commerce sales is currently pending in Congress.
Identify major public safety and welfare issues raised by e-commerce.
•	
Critical public safety and welfare issues in e-commerce include:
•	
The protection of children and strong sentiments against pornography. Several attempts by Congress 
to legislate in this area have been struck down as unconstitutional. The Children’s Internet Protec-
tion Act (CIPA), which requires schools and libraries in the United States to install “technology pro-
tection measures” (filtering software) in an effort to shield children from pornography, has, however, 
been upheld by the Supreme Court.
•	
Efforts to control gambling and restrict sales of cigarettes and drugs. In the United States, cigarettes, 
gambling, medical drugs, and addictive recreational drugs are either banned or tightly regulated by 
federal and state laws. Many offshore sites for these products and services have been shut down 
following government pressure. Online gambling is growing, but slower than anticipated. Online 
fantasy sports betting is growing rapidly.

oday, streaming music is one of the fastest 
growing types of online media services. 
Spotify and Deezer are two prime examples 
of this type of service. 
Spotify, founded in Sweden by Daniel Ek and Martin 
Lorentzon, is a vibrant music community. Users can choose 
the artists and music they want to hear, create and share 
playlists, and control the music while it plays via a mobile 
device or desktop computer. Spotify launched in Europe 
in 2008 and in the United States in 2011 after reaching 
licensing agreements with the major record companies and 
has risen to become the leading streaming music service 
in Europe. Spotify uses a freemium business model: con-
sumers can listen to up to a certain number of hours of 
advertising-supported free music each month. Unlimited 
service without ads is available on computers and mobile 
phones for an additional cost.  As a private company, 
Spotify does not report financial data, but analysts es-
timate that the company made $1.3 billion in 2014, up from just $97 million in 2010. 
Content costs have also risen over that time frame, however, and Spotify has struggled 
to show a profit, recording a $197 million loss in 2014, almost three times the size of its 
2013 loss. Analysts are skeptical that Spotify’s business model can work over the long 
term, but Spotify believes that as it grows, its margins will improve. To that end, Spotify 
has continued to slash prices for new users, offering three months of streaming for only 
$0.99 to new users in 2015. Spotify is believed to currently have enough to continue 
investing in its service and paying for the rights to music for the time being. In 2015, the 
company raised $350 million in funding at an incredible $8.5 billion valuation. Spotify 
also faces strong competition: Apple, Google, and Amazon have all announced or started 
streaming music services, not to mention smaller but entrenched subscription services 
like Deezer (discussed below), Rhapsody, Pandora, and Rdio. 
Spotify also faces another issue. In 2014, pop superstar Taylor Swift made waves 
when she announced that she was pulling her entire music catalog from Spotify, citing 
inadequate compensation. Other prominent musicians such as Adele and Coldplay, who 
withheld their chart-topping 2015 albums from Spotify, have voiced displeasure with the 
service. Spotify has countered that as its platform continues to grow in size, payouts to 
artists will improve, and that by the end of 2014, the company had paid nearly $2 billion

to the music industry, and 70% of its revenues to musicians. Many record labels report 
satisfaction with the royalties their artists receive, but in 2015, as Spotify negotiated 
new contracts with various labels, disputes have arisen over the percentage of streaming 
revenues Spotify pays. 
Deezer is a French-based firm and the second-largest streaming music service in 
Europe behind Spotify. It is a direct competitor to Spotify around the world and operates 
in over 180 countries. Like Spotify, Deezer offers unlimited access to a catalog of artists 
and songs, a recommendation engine, substantial background information on artists, and 
connections to Facebook and Twitter, along with a lively social community. Deezer was 
founded by Jonathan Benassaya and Daniel Marhely in 2007. In 2008, it received an 
$8.5 million angel investment and rapidly expanded to dominate the French streaming 
music market. Deezer has partnered with telecommunications carrier Orange to include 
its service as part of mobile phone contracts and has partnerships with 25 mobile opera-
tors and ISPs around the world. Deezer has 35 million licensed tracks and approximately 
6.5 million subscribers, the most active of which listen about 60 hours per week. It has 
doubled its number of paying subscribers within the last year, drawing even with Apple 
Music and trailing only behind Spotify. Like other streaming services that have freemium 
business models, Deezer offers free unlimited access for two weeks for registered users, 
who thereafter can continue to listen for free for 10 hours a month. For premium service 
without ads, Deezer charges $4.99 per PC-only use, and $9.99 for full mobile and PC 
access. In 2015, Deezer launched a family plan that allows for six different profiles for 
$16 per month. Deezer has tried to avoid growing its advertiser-supported free music 
option because advertising revenues alone do not cover the cost of musical content. Deezer 
sees its future growth taking place in China, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2014, Deezer 
began its first attempts to gain a foothold in the United States, and in 2015 purchased 
Muve Music, giving it a much stronger presence in the region with 2 million additional 
subscribers. Deezer is trying to differentiate itself from Spotify and others by focusing 
on its social and editorial content, including reviews and user comments. In 2013, Deezer 
incorporated third-party apps into its mobile platforms, and Spotify appears to be planning 
on doing the same. In 2014, Deezer acquired Stitcher, an aggregator of podcasts and radio 
shows, that will also help to differentiate Deezer from Spotify and its other competitors.
In 2015, Deezer announced plans for an IPO that were quickly scrapped after the 
company came under scrutiny from analysts. Although Deezer was valued at a hefty €1 
billion and has shown impressive revenue growth, it has struggled to show a profit, posting 
a loss of €27.2 million in 2014 and similar losses over the previous two years. Additionally, 
over 50% of Deezer’s subscribers do not generate much revenue because they rarely use the 
service, and many of Deezer’s licensing deals emphasize active monthly users as opposed 
to the raw number of subscribers. Several months after its initial announcement, Deezer 
backtracked and canceled the IPO, claiming that the market conditions were not ideal. 
As Spotify and Deezer struggle with profitability, other services have also struggled, 
such as Pandora, which has been sued over unlawful usage of records prior to 1972. 
Similarly, Apple Music has thus far failed to make much of a dent in its competitors’ 
market share. However, Spotify and Deezer still have faith in their long-term prospects.

he opening case illustrates how online content distributors like Spotify 
and Deezer are challenging both traditional and newer digital music 
distribution channels. If consumers can stream any song whenever they 
want to whatever device they want, the demand for physical CDs, as well as iTunes 
downloads, is reduced. On the other hand, it is not clear that Spotify or Deezer have 
viable business models. The case also illustrates how a traditional content business 
like recorded music has survived the initial digital disruption of its business and begun 
to develop new, innovative digital distribution channels that replace revenues from 
earlier products like CDs. As Internet users increasingly change their habits, spurred 
on by the growth of mobile devices, they are challenging existing business models 
that worked for decades to support newspapers, books, magazines, television, and 
Hollywood movies. Clearly, the future of content—news, music, and video—is online. 
Today, the print industry, including newspapers, books, and magazines, is having a 
difficult time coping with the movement of their readership to digital alternatives. 
Broadcast and cable television, along with Hollywood and the music industry, are also 
wrestling with outdated business models based on physical media. Established media 
giants are continuing to make extraordinary investments in unique online content, 
new technology, new digital distribution channels, and entirely new business models. 
Internet giants like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook are competing to dominate 
online content distribution. 
	 9.1	
ONLINE CONTENT
No other sector has been so challenged by the Internet and the Web than the content 
industries. The online content industries are organized into two major categories: the 
print industries (newspapers, magazines, and books), and the entertainment indus-
tries, which includes television, movies, music (including radio), and games. Together, 
the online content industries in the United States are expected to generate revenues 
of about $22 billion in 2015.
In this chapter, we will look closely at publishing (newspapers, magazines, and 
books) and entertainment (television and movies, music and radio, and games) as 
they attempt to transform their traditional media into digitally deliverable forms 
and experiences for consumers, while at the same time earning profits. These 
industries make up the largest share of the commercial content marketplace, both 
offline and online. In each of these industries, there are powerful offline brands, 
significant new pure-play online providers and distributors, consumer constraints 
and opportunities, a variety of legal issues, and new mobile technology platforms 
that offer an entirely new content distribution system in the form of smartphones 
and tablet computers.
Table 9.1 describes the most recent trends in online content and media for 2015–
2016.

B U S I N E S S
•	 Explosive growth of the mobile platform of smartphones and tablets accelerates the transition to 
digital content.
•	 Vertical integration: Amazon, Google (YouTube), Hulu, and Netflix (owners of the distribution channel) 
enter the content production business for video, books, and online TV-like video channels.
•	 The cable industry is disrupted by growth of Internet content distributors.
•	 Apple enters the music streaming business.
•	 The percentage of Internet users who watch digital video continues to increase, to around 200 million 
people, about 87% of Internet users.  
•	 Music: digital music sales top physical sales; streaming surpasses downloading. 
•	 TV: the number of Americans watching TV online continues to grow, to over 153 million (about 73% 
of the U.S. Internet population).
•	 E-book sales growth slows but represents one-third of all book revenues.  
•	 Movies: Americans continue to spend more on online movies than for DVDs. 
•	 Newspapers: online readership exceeds print readership. Online ad revenues grow but not enough to 
offset declining print ad revenues.
•	 Gaming market: console game sales stagnate as mobile gaming soars.
•	 The four Internet Titans compete: Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook vie for ownership of the 
online entertainment and content ecosystem, selling experiences as well as content.
•	 Cable and satellite companies seek to consolidate: Comcast made an unsuccessful $45 bid for Time 
Warner; Charter Communicatons is preparing its own offer. 
T E C H N O L O G Y
•	 Smartphones, tablet computers, and e-readers together create a rich mobile multimedia entertainment 
environment.
•	 Netflix remains the largest consumer of bandwidth, consuming about 37% of Internet traffic.
•	 Apps become the foundation for an app economy as they morph into content-distribution platforms 
that are proprietary, where users can be charged for content.
•	 Cloud storage services grow to serve the huge market for mobile device content. Apple launches 
iCloud video service that allows users to watch purchased videos on multiple Apple devices (iPhones, 
iPads, and Macs). Amazon and Google develop similar cloud services.
S O C I E T Y
•	 Media consumption: Americans spend around 4,200 hours a year consuming various types of media, 
more than twice as many hours as they work.
•	 Time spent using digital media exceeds time spent with television; time spent on mobile devices 
exceeds time spent on desktops.
•	 The Federal Communications Commission issues new net neutrality rules that prohibit broadband 
providers from blocking, slowing down, or speeding up access to specific websites.

CONTENT AUDIENCE AND MARKET: WHERE ARE THE EYEBALLS AND THE 
MONEY?
The average American adult spends around 4,300 hours each year consuming various 
media, twice the amount of time spent at work (2,000 hours/year) (see Figure 9.1). 
U.S. entertainment and media revenues (both online and offline) in 2014 were esti-
mated to be $264 billion, and they are expected to grow at a compound rate of 6% 
annually to 2019. Sales of tablets and smartphones have created new revenue streams 
for entertainment and media firms as consumer behavior changes in response to the 
new technologies. Content is no longer tied to physical products and can be deliv-
ered over the Internet from cloud servers to multiple mobile devices, reducing costs 
for consumers. Currently, online digital entertainment and media revenue is 8% of 
total entertainment and media revenue, or an estimated $21 billion. Millennials, the 
generation of people born between 1980 and 2000 (sometimes referred to as Digital 
Natives), are often thought to consume media very differently from their parents and 
older Baby Boomers. For a discussion of how Millennials differ in media consumption, 
see Insight on Society: Are Millennials Really All That Different?

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
ARE MILLENIALS REALLY ALL THAT 
DIFFERENT?
If you were born between 1981 
and 2000, congratulations! You are 
a Millennial and the subject of Mil-
lennial mania, which is now gripping the 
advertising, retailing, educational, and journal-
istic worlds. Not since the Baby Boomers has so 
much coverage been given to a single generation. 
Some people believe that Millennials are 
so different from previous generations that they 
require new kinds of products, new types of mar-
keting and advertising techniques to persuade 
them to buy, and entirely new educational tech-
niques. For instance, TicTac is coming to market 
with a Millennial product that changes flavors 
as it melts, from cherry, to peach, to lemonade. 
The company believes Millennials are bored 
with its old product. Millennials drink more spe-
cialty coffee, so coffee makers are responding 
with multiple new specialty coffee drinks. How 
about an orange-pineapple latte? Whole Foods 
is opening a line of stores geared to Millennial 
shoppers that has curated selections, innovative 
technology, and streamlined design. And there’s 
a hint of lower prices geared to the fact that 
Millennials are earning less, have higher rates of 
unemployment, and extraordinary student debt. 
There’s a lot of money at stake getting the pulse 
of Millennials and figuring out how to market 
to them. Millennials now make up the largest 
generation in the United States, constituting 
about 80 million consumers, and over 30% of 
the labor force. 
Millennials are just the latest in a long line 
of generalizations about people who grew up in 
specific time periods that are believed to have 
shaped the character of their entire generation. 
The Greatest Generation (1901–1924) came of 
age during the Great Depression and served in 
World War II. The Baby Boomers (1946–1964) 
grew up with the civil rights movement, politi-
cal unrest, and rock and roll. Generation X 
(1965–1980) continued the trends of the Baby 
Boomers except more so. Generation Xers were 
the first to experience a slowdown in living stan-
dards, and a growing sense that they might not 
earn as much as their parents. The Millennials 
are continuing many of the trends of previous 
generations, including an alienation from cultural 
and political institutions, a decline in religious 
belief and marriage rates, higher levels of student 
loan debt, poverty, and unemployment, and the 
reality—not just the fear—that they will earn 
less than their parents at a similar age. The Mil-
lennials are much more ethnically diverse as well: 
nearly half of the Millennial generation were not 
born in the United States. 
But perhaps more important according to 
some is that Millennials are digital natives: they 
are first generation to be born into the digital 
revolution of the 20th century. They grew up 
with the commercial Internet. According to 
Marc Prensky, an author and promoter of edu-
cational games, Millennials’ brains are physi-
cally different because of long-term exposure 
to interactive video games, console controllers 
(the “twitch” effect), graphical interfaces, and 
non-linear hypertext experiences on the Inter-
net. Today’s digital natives, in his view, cannot 
learn from books, newspapers, or linear stories 
even if they are video-based. They are bored by 
these old-school learning tools. The implications 
for education are, according to Prensky, to throw 
out traditional, old-style, linear thinking found 
in books and school curricula, and replace these

(continued)
with video games and link-clicking for nearly all 
subjects. This is called “gamification” of educa-
tion. 
But real-world Millennials don’t seem to fit 
the Prensky mold. In fact, there is no evidence 
that Millennials think differently from other gen-
erations, have physically different brains, or can 
learn only by using games. More Millennials have 
a college degree and more graduate school atten-
dance than other generations. They apparently 
do learn in traditional environments, and they 
didn’t get through all this education by playing 
games! Academic researchers have dismissed 
much of the digital native thesis, finding that 
while digital natives use more technology tools 
to learn in college, they do not use radically dif-
ferent digital tools such as virtual worlds, games, 
or social collaboration tools. The research does 
not find support for claims that Millennials have 
adopted learning styles that are radically differ-
ent from those of their parents. 
But clearly Millennials have had a very dif-
ferent experience growing up with technology 
than their parents, given the incredible advance-
ment of digital technologies in the last three 
decades that have created entirely new platforms 
like smartphones, tablets, digital photography, 
highly interactive console and PC games, all of 
which have changed how content—books, news-
papers, magazines, TV, and Hollywood movies—is 
created, distributed, and consumed. Millennials 
probably think like everyone else (let’s hope so), 
but they do have different patterns of content 
consumption. Let’s look at the data. 
Given their intense use of the Internet, 
and absorption in digital experiences, including 
games, one would think Millennials would read 
few books (too boring and not twitchy or inter-
active enough), and that they would believe the 
Internet contained just about all the content and 
knowledge worth knowing about. Not so, accord-
ing to a large study by Pew Research: Millennials 
are more likely to have read a book in 
the past 12 months than older adults, 88% 
vs. 79%. Almost 40% report having read an 
e-book in the past year, about the same as older 
adults. They are more likely to use a smartphone 
to read e-books than a Kindle. And they are more 
likely to think that there’s a lot of useful infor-
mation that is not on the Internet, more so than 
older adults. They are just as likely to have used 
a library in the past twelve months, and more 
likely to have used a library Web site. Even more 
unexpected: a study of 2,000 American and U.K. 
Millennials found this group overwhelmingly pre-
ferred printed books to e-books, and preferred 
buying them at bookstores rather than online 
stores like Amazon. Apparently, 600 years of 
reading printed books has created a print habit 
that might survive the Internet! 
Millennials are only half as likely to sub-
scribe to a print newspaper (13% vs. 26% for 
elders), but they are more likely to read news on 
digital news sites or get news (or links to news 
stories) from social sites, and to use their cell 
phones to follow news stories. Millennials are 
not news-less: 69% read news stories every day, 
some in print and even more online. 
Given Millennials’ intense exposure to high 
speed, interactive, “twitch”-oriented video and 
video games, surely they are not about to watch 
passive TV series online or offline, like regular 
cable television, or stream feature-length movies 
that require concentration. Surely they would not 
sit for thirty hours to binge watch a TV series 
already ten years old. Here too, the evidence 
does not fit the stereotype, although there are 
some differences. Contrary to the stereotype, 
Millennials watch 100–130 hours of regular 
cable TV per month, about the same as older 
adults. Marketers believe Millennial interest in 
TV is greater than any generation. Over 70% 
watch television live, without digital delays or 
streaming, slightly less than older adults. They 

620

like comedy and sitcoms more than older 
adults, and are more likely to watch TV on a 
smartphone or tablet. They also adore older TV 
series that they may have watched as children. In 
fact, they seem to have transformed the Internet 
from a media that involves reading to one that 
involves viewing. About 55% of binge viewers 
are Millennials. 
Millennials are more involved with online 
video: they watch 200 more videos per month 
than older adults, mostly on YouTube, in large 
part because they are more likely to have and 
use smartphones. Millennials are nearly twice as 
likely to use streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, 
and Amazon, and are less likely to have cable or 
satellite TV service than older adults (60% vs. 
80%). About 13% of Millennials have no pay 
TV service, not that different from 9% of older 
adults. Millennials are not cutting the cord in 
large numbers. They are using their smartphones 
and tablets as TV substitutes, viewing TV shows 
wherever and whenever they want. Almost 20% 
of Millennials use only a mobile device for Inter-
net access, compared to 5% for older adults. 
Millennials are driving a surge in YouTube action 
sports videos (surfing, skateboarding, and snow-
boarding). Red Bull, the energy drink company, 
has over 4.5 million views of its action sports 
YouTube channel. When it comes to finding 
interesting TV shows and videos, Millennials 
rely much more than other adults on their Face-
book friends and newsfeeds. Finally, Millennials 
play a more active role in creating video content 
than older adults by posting photos and videos 
to social sites. 
Millennials really do consume content differ-
ently than older adults of previous generations, 
although the differences appear to be far less and 
more commonsensical than journalists portray. 
For instance, Millennials take more advantage 
of the latest technologies from smartphones to 
access streaming music and TV services than, say, 
Baby Boomers, although Baby Boomers, the gen-
eration that created the digital revolution, have 
adopted the new technologies nearly as much. Mil-
lennials have not lost interest in society or news 
about society, they just access it online somewhat 
more than older adults. Millennials do indeed 
create and share more content than elders, and 
control their TV schedules more often, including 
binge viewing, even though they are watching hun-
dreds of hours of cable TV every month. 
Millennials are different, but not so differ-
ent that we don’t recognize them as our children, 
inheritors of very powerful digital technologies, 
to be sure, but inheritors also of several thousand 
years of literature, history, and culture, which 
they continue to find of enduring value.

Media Utilization: A Converging Digital Stream
The proliferation of mobile devices—tablets and smartphones—has led to an increase 
in the total amount of time spent listening to radio, watching TV and movies, and 
reading books, newspapers, and even magazines. Internet mobile and desktop account 
for over 60% of total media time spent. While the number of hours of TV viewing 
used to be far larger than Internet usage, since the development of mobile devices, 
time spent on desktops plus the mobile Internet is now expected to consume 5.4 
hours compared to 4.15 hours spent watching television on a TV in 2015. On the other 
hand, a great deal of Internet usage is watching time-shifted television shows! In 2015, 
an estimated 153 million Americans will use their computers and mobile devices to 
watch television shows, about 50% of the general population. Therefore, the distinc-
tion between Internet usage and television usage is not easy to make. The method of 
transmission is just different: cable TV versus the Internet. The Internet, television, 
and movies are converging into a single digital stream. This convergence is described 
later in the chapter. Well over 60% of television viewers multitask while watching 
television, usually using a smartphone or tablet computer, texting with friends, reading 
e-mail, searching the Web, or visiting social network sites (eMarketer, Inc., 2014a). 
Internet and Traditional Media: Cannibalization versus Complementarity
Several studies reveal that time spent on the Internet reduces consumer time available 
for other media (Pew Research Center, 2013). This is referred to as cannibalization. The 
alternative argument is that the Internet and traditional media are complementary 
and mutually supportive rather than substitutive. True, there has been a massive shift 
of the general audience to the Web, tablets, and smartphones, and once there, a large 
percentage of time is spent on viewing content. Yet, more recent data finds a more 
complex picture. Despite the availability of the Internet on high-resolution tablet com-
puters, television viewing remains strong, video viewing on all devices has increased, 
and the reading of all kinds of books, including physical books, has increased. New 
television sets are Internet-enabled, allowing consumers to use the Internet to view TV 
shows on their traditional TVs. Total music consumption measured in hours a day lis-
tening to music has increased even as sales of CDs have drastically declined; likewise, 
movie consumption has increased even as DVD sales also decline markedly. Music 
streaming is growing at 30% a year. The impact of the Internet on media appears to 
be increasing the total demand for media, including stimulating demand for products 
like books. The overall pattern is that physical products like CDs and DVDs are being 
replaced by digital versions delivered on computers, tablets, and smartphones either 
as downloaded content or as streaming services. 
Media Revenues
An examination of U.S. entertainment and media industry revenues reveals a some-
what different pattern when compared to media consumption (see Figure 9.2). In 
2014, media of all kinds generated $264 billion in revenue (not including transmis-
	
O n l i n e  C o n t e n t

sion fees for content such as cable TV subscription fees). Television and home video 
accounted for about 34% of media revenues, print media (books, newspapers, and 
magazines) for 34%, Internet media (online music and video), 8.7%, music media 
(radio and recorded music), 8.4%, box office, 6.5%, and video games, 8.5%. Internet 
media, while relatively small now, is growing at 12% annually, far faster than tradi-
tional media revenues.
Three Revenue Models for Digital Content Delivery: Subscription, A La Carte, and 
Advertising-Supported (Free and Freemium)
There are three revenue models for delivering content on the Internet. The two pay 
models are subscriptions (usually “all you can eat”) and a la carte (pay for what you 
use). The third model uses advertising revenue to provide content for free, usually 
with a freemium (higher price) option. There is also completely free, user-generated 
content, which we will discuss later. Contrary to early analysts’ projections that “free” 
would drive “paid” out of business, it turns out that both models are viable now and in 
the near future. Consumers increasingly choose to pay for high-quality, convenient, 
and unique content, and they have gladly accepted free advertiser-supported content 
when that content is deemed not worth paying for but entertaining nevertheless. 
There’s nothing contradictory about all three models working in tandem and coop-
eratively: free content can drive customers to paid content, as streaming services like 
Pandora and Spotify have discovered.

Online Content Consumption
Now let’s look at what kinds of online content U.S. Internet users purchase or view 
online (Figure 9.3). It’s not a surprise that 78% of U.S. Internet users watch online 
videos of many kinds, but it is a surprise that 67% of Internet users read newspapers. 
Listening to online radio and watching TV shows and movies online are the next 
most popular, followed by playing online games and listening to music on mobile 
devices. E-book consumption (32%) has grown at triple-digit rates since the Kindle was 
introduced in 2007 and the iPad in 2010 but has slowed to around 12% annual growth 
in 2015. What this reveals is that Internet users retain their affinity to traditional 
formats—newspapers, radio, TV shows, books, and music tracks and albums—and 
bring these tastes to the Internet and their mobile phones and tablets.
Figure 9.4 shows the estimated revenues from the U.S. online entertainment and 
media industries, projected to 2018. In 2015, total paid online entertainment content is 
estimated to be nearly $18 billion, and is expected to reach $26 billion by 2018. Online 
TV and movies is the largest and fastest growing online entertainment form, growing 
at 16% in 2015. Online music sales are no longer growing at double digits in 2015, but 
music remains the second largest revenue generator of online entertainment content. 
The U.S. online video audience (both television and movies) is huge, estimated 
at around 204 million Americans who watch over 50 billion videos monthly in 2015.

Figure 9.5 shows the top U.S. online video sites in May 2015. The most popular site 
remains Google (YouTube) with around 159 million viewers, followed by Facebook, 
AOL, Yahoo, and VEVO. The monetary value of all these videos is that they attract 
large audiences that can be shown ads. 
The overall size of the online video audience in the United States is about the 
same size as the traditional television audience. There are 116 million U.S. house-
holds with televisions, representing about 200 million individuals who tune in every 
month. However, major TV events tend to draw a much higher one-time viewership. 
For instance, 111 million people watched Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, the most widely 
viewed television program in U.S. history. No Internet video draws such large audi-
ences during a single time period. 
Free or Fee: Attitudes About Paying for Content and the Tolerance for 
Advertising
In the early years of online content, multiple surveys found that large majorities of 
the Internet audience expected to pay nothing for online content although equally 
large majorities were willing to accept advertising as a way to pay for free content. In 
reality, on the early Web, there wasn’t much high-quality content. By 2015, consumer 
behavior and attitudes toward paying for content had greatly changed. Until Internet 
services such as iTunes arrived in 2007, few thought the “fee” model could compete 
with the “free” model, and most Internet aficionados and experts concluded that

information on the Internet wants to be free. Cable TV systems and cable content 
providers like ESPN offer a totally different history: they always charged for service 
and content, and cable executives, investors, and TV experts never thought informa-
tion wanted to be free. Neither did the Hollywood and New York media companies that 
paid for and provided the content to television and movie theaters. In 2015, millions of 
Internet users pay for high-quality content delivered on a convenient device such as 
a smartphone, tablet computer, or e-reader or using Internet TV services like Netflix, 
Apple TV, or Amazon. Like cable TV, Apple iTunes charges for service and content as 
well. In a demonstration of just how much quality online content is worth paying for, 
by 2015, Apple had sold over 35 billion songs, over 700 million TV shows, and more 
than 200 million movies. Worldwide, iTunes has more than 800 million credit cards 
on file. Pandora, the second largest source of Internet music with about 250 million 
subscribers, and the largest streaming service, has 80 million monthly active listen-
ers. While an estimated 21 million Internet users in the United States still download 
songs from illegal P2P sites (down from 33 million in 2005), over 100 million people 
stream music to various devices both from the Internet and satellite services that are 
paid for by advertisers, and about 8 million pay for the stream as subscribers on a 
monthly basis (Sisario, 2015).

The culture of the Internet changed when firms such as YouTube (and its parent 
Google), which started out with a business model based on amateur videos and ille-
gally uploaded music videos, began cooperating closely with Hollywood and New York 
production studios for premium content. As it turns out, free content isn’t worth very 
much and should be free, especially if producers give it away. Premium content is 
worth a great deal, and should be priced accordingly. 
DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT (DRM) AND WALLED GARDENS
Digital rights management (DRM) refers to a combination of technical (both hard-
ware and software) and legal means for protecting digital content from unlimited 
reproduction and distribution without permission. DRM hardware and software 
encrypts content so that it cannot used without some form of authorization typically 
based on a payment. The objective is to control the uses of content after it has been 
sold or rented to consumers. Essentially, DRM can prevent users from purchasing and 
making copies for widespread distribution over the Internet without compensating 
the content owners. While music tracks in the iTunes Store were originally protected 
by DRM, in 2009, Apple abandoned the practice because of user objections, and 
because Amazon had opened an online music store in 2007 without any DRM protec-
tions, with the support of music label firms, who came to realize that DRM prevented 
them from exploiting the opportunities of the Internet and perhaps even encouraged 
an illegal market. Streaming content services are inherently difficult to copy and re-
distribute. Movies streamed from Netflix are technically difficult for the average user 
to capture and share. Likewise, music streamed from Pandora is cumbersome to record 
and share. Streaming services, including both Apple and Amazon, use a kind of DRM 
called a walled garden to restrict the widespread sharing of content. They do this by 
tying the content to the hardware, operating system, or streaming environment. 
E-books purchased from Amazon can only be read on Kindles or Kindle apps and 
Kindle books cannot be converted to other formats. By locking the content to a phys-
ical device, or a digital stream with no local storage, the appliance makers derive 
additional revenues and profits by locking customers into their service or device and 
satisfy the demands of content producers to be fairly compensated for their work. 
MEDIA INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
The U.S. media content industry prior to 1990 was composed of many smaller inde-
pendent corporations specializing in content creation and distribution in the separate 
industries of film, television, book and magazine publishing, and newspaper publish-
ing. During the 1990s and into this century, after an extensive period of consolidation, 
huge entertainment and publishing media conglomerates emerged.
The media industry is still organized largely into three separate vertical stove-
pipes: print, movies, and music. Each segment is dominated by a few key players. 
We do not include the delivery platform firms here, such as Comcast, Time Warner 
Cable, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and Dish Network, because in general they do not create 
content but instead move content across cable, satellite, and telephone lines. The 
digital rights

of technical and legal 
means for protecting

transmission industry is itself highly oligopolistic, with two dominant players in each 
distribution market. In telephony and wireless distribution, AT&T and Verizon domi-
nate. In cable distribution, Comcast and Time Warner dominate. Generally, there is 
very little crossover from one segment to another. Newspapers do not also produce 
Hollywood films, and publishing firms do not own newspapers or film production 
studios. The purchase of the Washington Post in 2013 by Jeff Bezos, the founder of 
Amazon, and an Internet mogul in his own right, was an anomaly. Even within media 
conglomerates that span several different media segments, separate divisions control 
each media segment. The competition between corporate divisions in mega-sized 
corporations is often more severe than with marketplace competitors.
MEDIA CONVERGENCE: TECHNOLOGY, CONTENT, AND INDUSTRY 
STRUCTURE
Media convergence is a much used but poorly defined term. There are at least three 
dimensions of media where the term convergence has been applied: technology, 
content (artistic design, production, and distribution), and the industry’s structure as a 
whole. Ultimately for the consumer, convergence means being able to get any content 
you want, when you want it, on whatever platform you want it—from an iPod to an 
iPad, Android phone, or home PC, or set-top device like Apple TV.
Technological Convergence
Convergence from a technology perspective (technological convergence) has to do 
with the development of hybrid devices that can combine the functionality of two or 
more existing media platforms, such as books, newspapers, television, movies, radio, 
and games, into a single device. Examples of technological convergence include the 
iPad, iPhone, and Android (“smartphones”) that combine print, music, pictures, and 
video in a single device.
Content Convergence
A second dimension of convergence is content convergence. There are three aspects 
to content convergence: design, production, and distribution.
There is a historical pattern in which content created in an older media technol-
ogy migrates to the new technology largely intact, with little artistic change. Slowly, 
the different media are integrated so that consumers can move seamlessly back and 
forth among them, and artists (and producers) learn more about how to deliver content 
in the new media. Later, the content itself is transformed by the new media as artists 
learn how to fully exploit the capabilities in the creation process. At this point, content 
convergence and transformation has occurred—the art is different because of the 
new capabilities inherent to new tools. For instance, European master painters of the 
fifteenth century in Italy, France, and the Netherlands (such as van Eyck, Caravag-
gio, Lotto, and Vermeer) quickly adopted new optical devices such as lenses, mirrors, 
and early projectors called camera obscura that could cast near-photographic quality 
images on canvases, and in the process they developed new theories of perspective

and new techniques of painting landscapes and portraits. Suddenly, paintings took on 
the qualities of precision, detail, and realism found later in photographs (Boxer, 2001). 
A similar process is occurring today as artists and writers assimilate new digital and 
Internet tools into their toolkits. For instance, GarageBand from Apple enables low-
budget independent bands (literally working in garages) to mix and control eight dif-
ferent digital music tracks to produce professional sounding recordings on a shoestring 
budget. Writers of books are beginning to think about video and interactive versions 
of their books. Online newspapers are changing the news cycle to a 24-hour stream, 
producing their own video channels, and expanding user comment opportunities on 
their Web sites. 
On the production side, tools for digital editing and processing (for film and televi-
sion) are driving content convergence. Given that the most significant cost of content 
is its creation, if there is a wide diversity of target delivery platforms, then it is wise 
to develop and produce only once using technology that can deliver to multiple plat-
forms. Generally, this means creating content on digital devices (hardware and soft-
ware) so that it can be delivered on multiple digital platforms. 
Figure 9.6 depicts the process of media convergence and transformation using 
the example of books. For example, consider this book. In 2015, this book was written 
with a view to appearing on iPads and Kindle e-book readers, and is moving closer 
to the media maturity stage, in which the book will be available mostly as a purely

digital product with substantial visual and aural content that can be displayed on many 
different digital devices. By that time, the learning experience will be transformed by 
greater use of interactive graphics, videos, as well as an integrated testing system that 
monitors student performance during the semester. Even the number of pages read by 
students, and the time on page, will be accounted for by this near-future digital learn-
ing system. Traditional bound books will probably still be available (books have many 
advantages), but most likely, print editions will be printed on demand by customers 
using their own print facilities.
Industry Structure Convergence
A third dimension of convergence is the structure of the various media industries. 
Industry convergence refers to the merger of media enterprises into powerful, syn-
ergistic combinations that can cross-market content on many different platforms and 
create new works that use multiple platforms. This can take place either through 
purchases or through strategic alliances. Traditionally, each type of media—film, text, 
music, television—had its own separate industry, typically composed of very large 
players. For instance, the entertainment film industry has been dominated by a few 
large Hollywood-based production studios, book publication is dominated by a few 
large book publishers, and music production is dominated by four global record label 
firms.
However, the Internet has created forces that make mergers and partnerships 
among media and Internet firms a necessary business proposition. Media industry con-
vergence may be necessary to finance the substantial changes in both the technology 
platform and the content. Traditional media firms who create the content generally 
do not possess the core competencies or financial heft to distribute it on the Internet. 
Technology companies that dominate the Internet (Google, Apple, Amazon, and Face-
book) have the competency and wealth to pursue Internet channel strategies, but do 
not currently have the competencies needed to create content. Business combinations 
and partnerships are made to solve these issues.
While traditional media companies have not done well in purchases of Inter-
net platform companies, the technology owners such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, 
Microsoft, and Google have generally avoided merging with media companies, and 
instead rely on contractual arrangements with media companies to protect intellectual 
property rights and to create a business pricing model that both parties can accept. 
However, this pattern may be changing. For instance, CBS Inc., a movie and televi-
sion content producer, produces television shows for Netflix; Netflix and Hulu have 
begun production and distribution of their own original TV shows; Google is producing 
original content designed for Internet distribution on YouTube. Amazon created its 
own book imprint, Amazon Books Publishing, and entered the book publishing busi-
ness. In this sense, the Internet is changing greatly the media industry from what it 
was in the recent past.
In the end, consumers’ demands for content anywhere, anytime, and on any 
device is pushing the technology and content companies toward both strategic alli-
ances and strategic conflicts in their search for advantage.

THE ONLINE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY
Nothing is quite so fundamental to a civilized society as reading text. Text is the way 
we record our history, current events, thoughts, and aspirations, and transmit them to 
all others in the civilization who can read. Even television shows and movies require 
scripts. Today, the U.S. publishing industry (composed of books, newspapers, maga-
zines, and periodicals) is a $103 billion media sector based originally on print, and 
now moving rapidly to the Internet and mobile delivery. The Internet offers the text 
publishing industry an opportunity to move toward a new generation of newspapers, 
magazines, and books that are produced, processed, stored, distributed, and sold over 
the Web, available anytime, anywhere, and on any device. The same Internet offers 
the possibility of destroying many existing print-based businesses that may not be able 
to make this transition and remain profitable.
ONLINE NEWSPAPERS
Newspapers in 2015 are the most troubled segment of the print publishing industry. 
A free fall in revenues that accelerated with the recession of 2008–2010 has stabilized. 
U.S. newspaper industry revenues have shrunk from their high of $60 billion in 2000 to 
about $31 billion in 2014 (see Figure 9.7). The newspaper labor force has roughly been 
cut in half over this period. The newspaper industry has been in an extended period 
of digital disruption since the rise of the Web in 2000 and the emergence of powerful 
search engines like Google, which allow consumers to search for news on any subject 
without having to browse a physical newspaper or an online edition. Social media sites 
have become a major source of unique visitors, who, unfortunately, do not browse for 
news and usually stay on the newspaper’s site for only a few moments to read a single 
article. These fleeting visitors typically do not engage with the newspaper as a whole 
or with its online ads. Even before the Internet and Web, newspaper revenue was 
falling due to the influence of earlier technologies like broadcast and cable television. 
In 2014, three of the largest newspaper organizations (Gannett, Tribune Company, 
and E.W. Scripps) span off their newspaper operations as independent firms so they 
could focus on television and other media assets, including in some cases, successful 
digital properties. Newspapers will now be pure-play print and online enterprises and 
will have to make it on their own without the protection of television or other media 
assets (Carr, 2014). 
The striking growth of alternative pure digital news sources in the last five years, 
from Twitter and Facebook, to BuzzFeed, Reddit, and Huffington Post, poses additional 
challenges in 2015. Online news sources like Yahoo and Google News, and many 
others, are attracting millions of consumers everyday, and steer potential newspaper 
readers—both online and offline—away from the most valuable front page of print and 
digital edition newspapers. The shift of consumers toward the mobile platform and 
social media deepens the potential for disruption in the newspaper industry. Social 
media sites are playing a significant factor in directing traffic directly to specific news-
paper articles, bypassing the newspaper’s valuable front page, and increasingly, are

providing their own original reporting and commentary by hiring professional journal-
ists away from troubled newspapers. In 2015, the New York Times, along with nine 
other news media outlets, agreed as an experiment to embed a few of its articles 
directly into Facebook’s News Feed as a way to attract millions of new readers, and 
hopefully convert them from free readers to paid digital subscribers. Facebook calls 
these news stories Instant Articles. Other news publishers are considering a similar 
move. The downside is that readers might not ever return to the newspaper Web sites, 
which are the most lucrative for digital newspapers. Newspaper survival will depend 
on how fast newspaper organizations can transform themselves from print to digital, 
and how fast they can monetize the expanding audience for news all the time, any-
where, on all devices. 
As can be seen from Figure 9.7, while newspaper circulation revenues (subscrip-
tions plus newsstand sales) have declined 10% since 2000 to around $11 billion, print 
advertising, which includes display ads, classified ads, and legal notices, has fallen 
precipitously from a high of $48 billion in 2000 to $16 billion in 2014. Online advertis-
ing in newspapers in the last year has shown weak growth, accounting for about $3.5 
billion in revenue, and newspapers’ revenues from online ads are still only 15% of 
print ad revenue, and only 10% of total revenue. The gains in online digital ad revenue 
are not large enough to compensate for the loss of print revenue. Only the music

U.S. newspaper ad revenues have declined by 50% since 1980.  As a percentage of total revenues, circulation subscription revenues have 
become more important.  Digital is a small source of revenue but growing up until recently.

industry has suffered a similar devastating decline in revenue. The 15-year decline in 
newspaper revenues has resulted from four factors: 
•	 The growth of the Web and mobile devices as an alternative medium for news and 
advertising. The movement of consumers to an online life style has drained billions 
of ad dollars (including classified ads) from the printed newspaper. The same has 
not been true of television advertising as we will discuss later in the chapter. Even 
radio advertising has stood up well to the digital revolution. 
•	 The rise of alternative digital sources for news, commentary, feature stories, and 
articles. 
•	 The difficulty of traditional newspaper firms and their managers to develop suitable 
business and revenue models that could survive and even prosper on the Internet, 
and the mobile/social platform.
•	 The rise of social media, and its role in directing traffic to newspaper content, has 
challenged newspapers to change their business model to accommodate changes 
in consumer behavior and technology. 
From Print-centric to Digital First: The Evolution of Newspaper Online Business 
Models, 1995–2015
Since 1995, when e-commerce and digital advertising began, through to the present, 
newspapers have developed three distinct business models in an effort to adapt to the 
Internet, and more recently, the mobile and social platform (see Figure 9.8). The 
three models are: Print-centric (1995–2000), Integrated Print/Web (2000–2010), and 
the most current model, Digital First (2010–present). You can compare these models 
on four dimensions: 
•	 Search and discovery: How do readers find the news? 
•	 Awareness: How are potential readers made aware of news? 
•	 Engagement: How are readers engaged with the news and journalists? 
•	 Technology platform: How, when, and where is the news delivered to readers? 
(New York Times, 2014). 
The milestones reflect important dates in the evolution of the Web and the mobile-
social platform. In 1998 to 2000, Google launched its search engine with 60 million 
pages indexed, and introduced search engine paid advertising based on its Page Rank 
algorithm. In 2007, Apple introduced its iPhone, creating a truly mobile and universal 
Web device, and Facebook opened its site to the public, and in 2008 signed up over 100 
million users, creating the first large-scale, online social network. 
Prior to the development of the Web, search engines, mobile devices, and social 
media platforms, readers discovered the news by browsing (a form of searching) the 
printed paper. They became aware of stories by reading the front page, section pages, 
and article titles. Readers did not engage with journalists, editors, or other contribu-
tors, except for the few who wrote letters to the editor (less than 1% of all readers). 
Journalism was considered a profession, and readers were not expected to do much 
more than read and be fascinated, enlightened, and entertained by people who obvi-
632	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  M e d i a 

ously were more informed than they. Journalists worked all day on their articles and 
filed them at 5 PM; professional editors revised the copy, and compositors put it on 
the page for the presses, which ran after midnight. The news stream ended at 5 PM. 
The technology platform was print, sometimes with color (a major innovation and 
expense in this period). 
With the introduction of the Web and its growing popularity, newspapers retained 
their existing print-centric strategy and culture. In the Print-centric period from 1995 
to 2000, newspapers created digital copies of their print editions and posted them 
online. Readers discovered stories as they did before, by reading the front page online, 
following links to stories, and clicking on topic areas or sections (e.g., Sports or Tech-
nology). Stories were promoted by a business department that sought to enlarge the 
print audience and to attract advertisers based on readership and online visitors. 
Digital advertising was very limited, in part because advertisers did not believe it was 
effective. Readers were not engaged with journalists except insofar as they read the 
stories and could identify with the subjects of stories. The business process of creating 
journalism did not change: articles were filed at 5 PM and went to print editors, and 
then were sent to the Web team and the print group. There was little difference, if any, 
between the print and online versions. The technology platform for the digital edition 
was the desktop or laptop, and news was consumed at home and work. 
In the Integrated Print/Web period, from 2000 to 2010, newspapers adopted mul-
timedia elements such as video, added more interactive elements like crossword 
 
Newspapers have gone through three different business models as they adapt to the Internet.

puzzles and contests, and provided more reader feedback opportunities, especially 
on opinion and editorial pages. There were opportunities to personalize the news 
using RSS feeds and push news to the reader. Nevertheless, news was discovered by 
the reader visiting the Web site; promoting content online was limited, primarily to 
RSS feeds. Readers were somewhat more engaged. The technology platform remained 
the desktop or laptop platform. 
In the Digital First period, from 2008 to the present, three developments in the 
technology and popular audience platform occurred: the rapid adoption of smart-
phones and tablets, and the equally astounding growth of social media sites like Face-
book and Twitter, which have come to dominate consumer time on the Web and mobile 
devices. In addition, the rise of start-up news sites specifically focused on using the 
new technology and platforms has spurred newspapers to radically transform their 
business—or go out of business. The new platform is not based on personal computers 
using a browser, but on mobile devices and apps, with desktops and laptops now just 
one pillar of the delivery platform. In this new environment, the news does not stop 
at 5 PM, but goes on 24×7. Stories might start with a tweet, or from a Facebook post, 
followed by thousands of tweets, then millions of shares on multiple social sites and 
finally an article in the online newspaper, and perhaps in the print edition as well. 
Often amateurs on scene know more about the news in the first hours of a story than 
any collection of journalists in their offices. Amateurs provide video feeds, commen-
tary, and opinion. 
The Digital First business model inverts previous models: the top priority is pro-
ducing the most engaging, continually updated digital edition, and then producing a 
print product based on the news developed in the digital edition. In the case of pure 
digital start-ups, there is no print edition, and the news is just a continuous stream of 
updates, blogs, tweets, and posts, rather than a fixed article. News articles are time-
stamped, indicating an update is on the way and the reader should return to follow 
the story. Instead of waiting for readers to discover the news, or search for the news 
on a search engine, the news is pushed to readers on any of a variety of venues where 
they happen to be—social media sites, mobile news feeds, Twitter, or Yahoo or Google 
News. Journalists remain paid professionals, but they follow Twitter feeds and social 
media sites, and promote their stories and personas on social media sites. Their job 
is no longer simply reporting and writing, and getting the facts right, but promoting 
and engaging readers on a personal level through their own efforts. Superior reporting 
and writing is no longer the sole criterion for hiring and advancement. More emphasis 
is put on reporters’ abilities to attract audiences on their own social media pages and 
Twitter feeds. 
The Digital First business model is not yet a reality for traditional newspapers. 
The largest print newspaper organizations, such as the Wall Street Journal, New York 
Times, Washington Post, and others, have begun the journey towards becoming Digital 
First news organizations. In 2014 the Wall Street Journal launched its Real-Time news 
desk, a headquarters group of 60 editors aiming to produce a continuous and lively 
flow of digital news and commentary to social media sites, mobile followers, and its 
online sites (Romenesko, 2014). The New York Times also initiated a Digital First model 
634	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  M e d i a 

in January 2014. In 2015, the Wall Street Journal launched a new digital first Web site, 
with redesigned Web and video pages, iPad and Android apps, and a greater emphasis 
on breaking news stories that are refined in the course of a 24-hour news cycle. In the 
past two years, the Financial Times, New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, 
and Bloomberg News have all made similar changes to succeed in a mobile-tablet-
desktop digital market place. 
Online Newspaper Industry: Strengths and Challenges
The newspaper industry still has some major strengths, which it will need to draw 
upon as it faces the challenges of the future. In the following section, we review those 
strengths and challenges.
Strength: Newspaper Audience Size and Growth.  Online readership of newspapers is 
growing at more than 10% a year. About 67% of U.S. Internet users (about 176 million 
people) read newspaper content online, making it the second most popular online 
activity behind watching video, and is about 10% higher than 2014. See Figure 9.9 
for a list of the top ten online newspapers in the United States. The online newspaper 
is one of the most successful of all online media in terms of audience size. Mobile 
newspaper readership is especially strong among young persons due to their greater 
usage of smartphones and tablet computers. 
Newspapers have responded to the changing audience by providing access to their 
content on all digital platforms (see Figure 9.10). With 59% of Americans having a 
Online newspaper readership is expanding rapidly as consumers shift to mobile devices and participate in social networks.

smartphone, 49% a tablet, and 75% accessing the Internet through mobile devices, in 
a few short years newspapers have become truly multi-platform by developing apps 
and Web sites optimized for mobile devices (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b; Pew Research 
Center, 2014a). Only 56% of newspaper readers are exclusively print readers, 45% use 
a combination of Web, print, or mobile. Mobile and tablet engagement is growing at 
more than 70% annually, especially among 18- to 34-year olds (Newspaper Associa-
tion of America, 2014c). 
Online newspapers also attract a wealthy and consumer-intense demographic, 
reaching 64% of 25- to 34-year-olds and 75% of individuals in households earning 
more than $100,000 a year on average throughout the quarter. Given the large online 
newspaper audience, it is clear that the future of newspapers lies in the online and 
mobile market even as readership and subscriptions to the traditional print newspapers 
continue to decline at a steady pace. 
Challenge: Digital Ad Revenue.  Newspapers hope that the digital ad revolution and 
revenue will hit their shores, and lift total ad revenues. But here’s the problem: while 
unique visitors to newspaper Web sites are expanding, increasingly this traffic is less 
valuable for two reasons. First, the audience is increasingly coming from social media 
sites and search engines in order to find specific articles, rather than coming directly 
to the newspaper’s home page (so-called side-door entry). Second, these visitors from 
social sites are less engaged, and less valuable (see Figure 9.11).
 
Web-only readership of newspapers remains quite small compared to print only and multi-platform reading.

The less engaged visitors are in terms of pages viewed, minutes on site, and return 
visits, the less time there is to show them ads and earn revenue. Direct visitors are there-
fore much more valuable and newspapers are hoping re-designed Web sites and apps will 
increase the number of home page visitors. As a result, growth in digital ad revenues at 
online newspapers has been tepid despite increasing unique visitors. While U.S. print ad 
revenue continued to decline in 2014 by an estimated 10%, newspaper digital ad revenue 
grew only 1.5%. In comparison, total U.S. Internet digital ad revenue (search, social, and 
display ads) grew at a robust 31% (eMarketer, Inc., 2015c). If current trends continue, it 
is unlikely newspapers can rely on growing unique visitors from social sites, or growing 
digital ad revenues, to reverse the revenue declines of the past decade. Instead they will 
need to build on their expanding digital subscription market composed of loyal readers 
who visit the paper everyday for curation and opinion.
Strength: Content Is King.  Why do people continue to buy newspapers and pay for 
newspaper content online? The oft-repeated bon mot that “content is king” appears 
to be true in the case of print as well as online content of all kinds, including news 
and pure digital news sites. As in competitive sports, in general, quality counts. The 
reason why online newspapers attract exceptionally large and loyal audiences who 
are deeply engaged is simple: quality of content. Compared to other media, news-
papers are the most trusted source of news and commentary on local, national, and 
international stories (Nielsen, 2013). Local newspapers produce the highest levels 
of ad engagement: 35% of consumers report making purchases on the basis of local 
Newspaper visitors who come to newspaper Web sites directly in search of news are far more engaged and 
generate more digital ad revenue.

newspaper ads. Online banner ads, e-mail campaigns, and fleeting mobile ads in a 
Facebook Newsfeed do not even come close to these engagement levels. Newspapers 
employ about 40,000 full-time professional editorial staff, down from about 60,000 in 
2000, but still much larger than television, radio, or newer pure digital news sources, 
which obtain most of their content from unpaid bloggers, cellphone photographers, 
and bloggers (Pew Research Center, 2014c). 
Amateur blogs and tweets may be wonderful for expressing opinions, or making 
instant reports on newsworthy events as they occur, but they are no substitute for 
professional reporters and editors, who make sense out of the constant stream of 
reports, and they are not a place for brand-conscious advertisers who do not want 
their products associated with low-quality content. In 2014, Google began offering 
Google Journalism Fellowships to journalism students in the stated belief that quality 
journalism is a key ingredient of a vibrant and functioning society (Wingfield, 2013a). 
While Internet news giants are dependent on newspapers to provide them with 
content to search and index, newspapers are equally dependent on Internet giants 
for visitors. 
Challenge: Finding a Revenue Model.  In 1995, when the first newspaper Web sites 
appeared, newspapers offered their content for free, with registration. The hope was 
that advertising would support the Web site’s operation and provide a new revenue 
stream for the print edition content. In some cases, free content was limited to the 
most popular articles and did not include the classified ads, a lucrative newspaper 
franchise. At that time, print advertising provided over 75% of revenues and subscrip-
tion revenue generated about 25%. 
Charging for general newspaper content was an obvious answer, but publications 
that tried this during the 1995–2005 period were punished by an Internet culture that 
expected online content such as music and news to be free. For instance, in 1998, 
Slate, an online magazine owned by Microsoft, began charging its 140,000 readers a 
$19.95 annual subscription fee (a so-called paywall). There was a free Front Porch 
section with a few articles. In 1999, Slate dropped its subscription fee after only 20,000 
readers signed up. Some specialized content newspapers, like the Wall Street Journal, 
were able to charge an annual subscription fee ($50 annually) and survive. In a year 
the Journal had 200,000 paid subscribers. Similarly, the Financial Times introduced a 
subscription service in 2001, and in 2007 adopted a metered subscription model 
where readers got ten free articles but were asked to pay a $395 subscription fee after 
that. Both the Journal and Financial Times were exceptions to consumer resistance to 
paying for news, and based on a wealthy, focused readership interested in high-value 
information. 
The introduction of the iTunes store in 2003, and the iPhone in 2007 changed 
the public perception of paid content. While plenty of pirated music was available, 
Apple devices (iPods and later iPhones and iPads) and iTunes provided a high-quality, 
convenient, and legal alternative that users were willing to pay for. In 2014, paying a 
subscription fee for content is the foundation of streaming video and music services 
from Netflix to Pandora.

Newspapers and online magazines have benefited from this change in popular 
culture. An estimated 450 of the 1,380 daily newspapers in the United States now 
charge for online access (Edmunds, 2013). These plans have three key elements: a 
paywall for heavy users; considerable free content for casual or link traffic (visitors 
from social media sites, for instance, who stay for a few moments and then move on); 
and a bundled price for both print and digital subscriptions, in some cases offering 
the digital version free with a print subscription, allowing users to read the paper on 
any digital device. 
In 2011, the New York Times introduced a metered subscription model where 
casual readers could read 20 articles for free, and unlimited reading of current archived 
content for $35 annually. Print subscribers received the digital subscription for free. 
The free-to-print subscribers policy put the emphasis on subscription to the Times 
content, and not to any particular platform. This is important because today’s news-
paper readers are multi-platform: they read the content with a variety of devices 
depending on the context. A metered subscription model is identical to a freemium 
model: some content is free but ad-supported, while unlimited content is only through 
a subscription. In 2013, the number of free articles was reduced to 10, given the success 
of the metered model. In 2013, the New York Times subscription revenue exceeded ad 
revenue for the first time. In 2015, the Times has over 900,000 digital subscribers. In 
2014, the Times introduced its NYT Now app for a subscription fee. It failed to attract 
more than 20,000 subscribers, and in 2015 the Times made NYT Now free, in the 
hope that many app users would eventually pay for a full priced digital subscription 
(Alpert, 2015). With 57 million online visitors and 20 million mobile readers, there’s 
plenty of room for the Times to grow its subscriber base. Fortunately, for newspaper 
firms, the public has accepted the notion of paying for high quality content available 
nowhere else. 
Challenge: Growth of Pure Digital Competitors.  The Web has provided an opportu-
nity for newspapers to extend their print brands, but at the same time it has given 
digital entrepreneurs the opportunity to disaggregate newspaper content by creating 
specialized Web sites for popular content such as weather, classified ads (Craigslist), 
restaurant and product reviews (Yelp), as well as topical national and international 
news sites and apps that compete with online newspapers. Despite the declining rev-
enues of the traditional print newspaper industry, entrepreneurs have poured money 
into news sites, and even newspapers. Since 2011, Warren Buffett has purchased 28 
newspapers for an estimated $344 million in a belief that newspapers delivering 
comprehensive and reliable information to small tightly bound communities, and 
that have a reasonable Internet strategy, will be viable for a long time (Berkshire 
Hathaway, 2013). In August 2013, Jeffrey Bezos purchased the iconic Washington Post 
for $250 million in the belief that newspapers are not just papers but news gathering 
and distribution businesses independent of any technology or platform (Hagey and 
Bensinger, 2013). 
While actual print newspapers are attracting wealthy individual investors, venture 
capital investors have poured over $1 billion dollars into purely digital online news

sites. Table 9.2 describes the leading native digital start-up news sites and their invest-
ment profile. Huffington Post and Buzzfeed were growing at over 100% a year although 
this growth is expected to slow in coming years (Fischer, 2014; Isaac, 2014). Within 
the last five years, both sites have surpassed the New York Times in terms of unique 
visitors, and currently BuzzFeed has 78 million unique visitors a month. Other more 
traditional pure online news sites like Yahoo, Google, ESPN, and CNN have also shown 
extraordinary growth (see Figure 9.12).

Not all digital news services succeed, and none are profitable so far. For instance, 
Digg, a news aggregator site, failed in 2011 despite having 230 million unique visitors 
at one point. 
Challenge: Can Newspapers Survive Digital Disruption.  The newspaper industry would 
appear at first glance to be a classic case of a disruptive technology—the Internet, 
mobile devices, and apps—destroying a traditional business model based on physi-
cal products and physical distribution. Incumbents (the existing print newspapers) 
slowly and incrementally improve their products over time. New firms—disruptors—
introduce new products (Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, Vox), which are not as good as 
the incumbents’ products, but are based on newer and more powerful technologies. 
The new products are less expensive, or free, and target underserved or entirely new 
markets. They often are founded and promoted by people new to the industry. Even-
tually the disruptor’s products are improved and become more acceptable, or good 
enough. At this point, the new products and the disruptors start draining significant 
market share from the incumbents who eventually fail. Incumbents fail for a variety 
of reasons, from an expensive legacy production process, large human capital invest-
ments, a contrary culture, and an inability to perceive rapid changes in the business 
and technology environment. For a description of a news industry start-up that may 
have a disruptive impact on traditional newspapers, see the Insight on Business case, 
Vox: Native Digital News. 
Native digital news sites have greatly expanded their unique visitor count and are direct competitors of established newspapers and their 
online editions.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
VOX: NATIVE DIGITAL NEWS 
Despite the unprecedented array of 
entertainment options in the smart-
phone era, people are reading more 
news online than ever before. In fact, 
reading news online is the second most 
popular activity online with over 176 million 
people (67% of the Internet population) doing so 
in 2015. Digital news readers are highly engaged 
with the content and the journalists who put the 
words on the screen. All of this is not lost on 
investors and venture capital firms, which have 
poured over $1 billion dollars into digital native 
news sites (sites without a print edition or televi-
sion franchise) in the last few years. 
Vox Media is a prime example of a start-
up media firm grounded in the digital news 
stream that originated on the Internet and has 
since moved to a mobile social platform as well. 
Founded in 2003, Vox Media is a privately held 
company based in Washington D.C. with 400 
employees. Vox Media does not reveal revenue 
figures although the company claimed it was 
profitable in 2014. The real money comes from 
venture capital, with the latest investment of $200 
million in August 2015 from Comcast’s NBC​
Universal division, valuing the company at a whop-
ping $1 billion. Gaining access to NBCUniversal’s 
content distribution and production capabilities 
will help Vox Media to branch out into other forms 
of multimedia.
Vox Media has pursued a unique strategy from 
the beginning. Rather than creating a single digital 
news site, as, say, traditional newspapers have 
done, and showing tabs for various areas of inter-
est (sports, business, or entertainment), it instead 
has unbundled the general news site into a number 
of focused news sites, populating them with content 
from hundreds of different blogs that it has created 
or purchased. It started with SBNation (SportsB-
logNation), a sports news site that is a collection 
of 308 blogs, each with its own name, URL, brand, 
and writer/bloggers. For instance, when you go to 
the SBNation Web site, you will see a tab for NFL. 
Click that, and you will see a list of teams. Click 
on, say, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and you will be 
taken to a Web site devoted to the Steelers, with 
much more content specific to the Steelers than a 
national newspaper provides.
These niche sites foster much greater intensity 
of reader engagement, and the approach seems 
to be working: Vox Media reached 54 million 
unique monthly visitors in June 2015, and it was 
the fastest growing digital media site in a recent 
report, with the typical visitor being an individual 
under 35 with income over $100,000 a year. Over 
40% of its readership belongs to the coveted age 
18-to-34 demographic.
Vox Media has built on the success of SBNa-
tion and currently owns eight specialty sites, 
which themselves are often collections of blogs 
or Web sites. Vox verticals include Eater (food), 
Curbed (real estate), Verge (culture), Polygon 
(game), Racked (fashion), Re/code (tech), and 
most recently, a general news and commentary 
site, Vox.com. 
Vox.com was created in January 2014 when 
Vox hired respected political reporter Ezra Klein 
from the Washington Post, in large part because 
of Vox Media’s technology for delivering online 
news and its commitment to digital news. Vox.com 
launched in April 2014. At Vox, Klein is aiming to 
create a new kind of digital journalism that will 
keep readers up to date with the news, but also 
provide background understanding and context to 
the news stream. 
Vox Media is often regarded as the future 
of digital news publishing because of its technol-
ogy, culture, and business organization. Traditional 
newspaper firms typically have a melange of tech-
nologies, built at different times, to coordinate the 

	
T h e  O n l i n e  P u b l i s h i n g  I n d u s t r y 	

643
flow of news with both print and Web versions. At 
Vox, millions of dollars were invested in a content 
management system (CMS) called Chorus from 
the very beginning of the firm. A traditional CMS 
allows content creators to create text products 
that seamlessly integrate other types of media. 
Chorus goes beyond content creation and manage-
ment because it provides the publishing environ-
ment as well. When reporters and editors are done, 
they can use Chorus to publish formatted content 
to various Web sites and social media. They can 
also read comments back from readers and elimi-
nate inappropriate comments in real time. Chorus 
also features tools to help police reader comments 
more efficiently, as well as the Story Stream tool, 
which allows journalists to click and drag content 
from other stories and assemble it into a coherent 
document. Chorus is an extraordinary technologi-
cal achievement. 
Vox also has a unique organizational struc-
ture when compared to traditional newspapers. At 
Vox, the organization is flat, with fewer middle and 
senior managers. This gives extraordinary discre-
tion to reporters compared to the lengthy editorial 
review process that can take hours at a traditional 
paper. 
The journalistic process at digital news sites 
is also different from traditional newspapers. The 
discrete stages of a traditional print news site 
move in serial order (research, first draft, copy-
edit, fact check, second draft, proofread, com-
posite, print). In a pure digital environment these 
steps are greatly compressed into a continuous 
process, with some stages running in parallel. For 
instance, research and drafting takes place with 
light editing, using a collaborative software envi-
ronment that allows these steps to occur nearly 
simultaneously. Later, more in-depth editing 
and fact checking, re-drafting, and proofing 
all occur together, with publishing the last step. 
Whether or not Vox will ultimately succeed 
depends on whether it is able to attract a large 
audience and enough advertisers to the site. 
Unbundling news into more focused, vertical 
Web sites and harnessing technology to reduce 
the cost and improve the speed of content cre-
ation has been a good start. But there still is 
one missing ingredient that traditional journal-
ists point to: quality reporting. Critics worry that 
without interviewing newsmakers, doing back-
ground research, and taking the time to write an 
original article, news gains immediacy, but suffers 
in quality. Aggregating existing content adds no 
real economic value to the news stream. Business 
analysts also point out that few of the digital news 
sites, even Huffington Post, have generated profits. 
They are all money losers at the moment. Most of 
the digital news sites are private and do not report 
revenues or profits. Among the few that do, Yahoo 
reported 7% declines in ad revenue for 2014 and 
those losses have continued into 2015, with Yahoo 
losing another 7% in ad revenue. The pure digital 
news sites face the same problems online as tra-
ditional newspapers do, namely, the declining rev-
enues from digital advertising. However, internal 
documents at Buzzfeed, the second most heavily 
trafficked “new media” company behind Huffing-
ton Post, show that the company has been profit-
able since 2013 and that its revenue tripled from 
2012 to 2013 and was on track to grow another 
140 percent in 2014. While the cost of generat-
ing traffic to these sites is substantial, Vox and 
its peers are continuing their push toward profit-
ability.

Pure digital news sites have many advantages over print newspapers. They don’t 
have the cost of printing papers; they can create new work flows and business pro-
cesses that are more efficient and timely; they have a lower cost structure, often 
relying on user generated content and minimal payments to reporters and bloggers, 
with lower pension costs; and they can take advantage of newer technologies for 
producing the news. While the quality of journalism on these pure digital sites is not 
as good as traditional print newspapers, this situation is changing rapidly as the pure 
digital sites hire talented journalists and editors from print newspapers that are expe-
riencing financial difficulties. 
What online news sites often do not have is credibility and trust. For instance, 
Buzzfeed has been the subject of many lawsuits accusing it of copying content from 
competing newspapers and sites without attribution, claiming the content as its own. 
Without trust and quality, online news sites are simply distractions filled with celebrity 
photos, and there is significant competition for this kind of content. 
If the newspaper industry has a future, it will be online and multiplatform. The 
challenge for newspapers is to create value by focusing on differentiated, timely, and 
exclusive content available nowhere else; to transform its culture of journalism to 
provide a continuous news stream just as its pure digital competitors; and to make this 
content available anywhere, anytime, anyplace, on any device. In short, newspapers 
will have to become Digital First publications, while maintaining their historic quality 
edge, and meeting the challenge from their pure digital competitors. 
MAGAZINES REBOUND ON THE TABLET PLATFORM
Magazines in the United States reached their peak circulation in the early 1980s, with 
more than 40 million people reading some kind of weekly or monthly magazine. Most 
Americans at that time got their national and international news from the three weekly 
news magazines, Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report. The “glossies,” as 
general-interest magazines were known, attracted readers with superb writing, short-
form articles, and stunning photography brought to life by very high-resolution color 
printing (Vega, 2012).
Circulation fell after 2000 in part because of the Internet. At first, the Internet 
and the Web did not have much impact on magazine sales, in part because the PC 
was no match for the high-resolution, large-format pictures found in, say, Life or Time. 
Eventually, as screens improved, as video on the Web became common, and the 
economics of color publishing changed, magazine circulation began to plummet and 
advertisers turned their attention to the digital platform on the Web, where readers 
were increasingly getting their news, general-interest journalism, and photographic 
accounts of events (Pew Research Center, 2014c). Overall U.S. magazine circulation 
declined by 2.2% in 2014.
U.S. magazine newsstand sales have declined significantly since 2001. Yet spe-
cial-interest, celebrity, homemaking, and automobile magazines remained stable. 
The largest monthly subscription magazine for several decades has been the AARP 
(American Association of Retired Persons) magazine, with a paid circulation of over 
20 million readers. News magazines like Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World

Report have done less well than picture-oriented magazines in fashion, celebrity, and 
lifestyle (Trachtenberg, 2015).
While U.S. newstand sales are falling at about 10% a year, and subscription sales 
are flat, magazines have responded by developing digital replica magazines—fairly 
close copies of the physical magazine. Currently, there are about 300 digital replica 
magazines, and about 8 million units are sold each year. Total revenues from U.S. 
subscriptions and newstand sales of magazines are expected to be around $25 billion 
in 2015, about the same as 2014, and revenues are expected to remain flat through 
2020. Ad revenues will constitute $15 billion of the total. The good news for magazines 
is that digital revenues are climbing at 22% a year, amounting to nearly $4 billion in 
2015. Unfortunately, print advertising (about $13 billion) is declining at 4% a year 
(Sebastian, 2014). The increasing digital revenue is not quite enough to compensate 
for the decline in print ad revenue (eMarketer, Inc., 2014c). The magazine industry 
parallels closely the newspaper industry: newstand sales are down, circulation and 
subscription revenues are flat, print ads are down, digital ads are up (Magazine Pub-
lishers Association, 2014). One possible solution is to begin charging a subscription 
fee for access to the digital editions, which currently are often free. The New Yorker, 
perhaps the most prestigious magazine in the United States, is also one of the most 
widely read, with 1 million print subscribers and 12 million unique visitors to its Web 
site. In 2014, the magazine introduced a metered paywall. Some articles are free, 
but frequent readers will be charged an annual subscription fee (Somaiya, 2014). 
Like newspapers, magazines are experimenting with different revenue models in an 
effort to monetize the rapidly growing tablet audience. Most magazines participate in 
Apple’s iPad Subscription Service, which allows magazines to offer subscriptions from 
within their app and have the transaction processed by the App Store billing system. 
Publishers set the price, and customers can subscribe with one click. Apple keeps 
30% of the transaction. Publishers can also direct app readers to their Web site for a 
subscription, in which case Apple does not make any fee. Virtual storefronts such as 
Google Play have helped publishers grow their digital subscriber base. In 2015, Apple 
introduced its News app. Magazines such as Time and 75 others will publish articles 
in an effort to capture a younger, mobile audience (Trachtenberg, 2015).
Despite the shrinkage of print subscription and newsstand sales in the past 
few years, the growth of digital magazine sales has been extraordinary. The total 
magazine audience size increased over 10% in 2015, due entirely to growth of digital 
magazines, especially mobile Web editions, and the percentage of online readers of 
magazines tripled in the last three years (Magazine Publishers Association, 2015). 
Almost one-third of the Internet population in the United States (about 65 million 
people) read magazines online. More than 35% of tablet computer owners read 
magazine content once a week, and there are an estimated 1,200 magazine apps for 
mobile readers.
Popular Web sites like Pinterest, an image-collecting site that attracts millions of 
women, and Facebook, Yahoo, and Twitter are among the largest drivers of traffic to 
digital magazines. The widespread adoption of tablet computers has helped create 
the visual Internet, where glossy magazine publishers, who are inherently oriented

to richly detailed color photography, can display their works and advertisements to 
great advantage. 
With hundreds of popular online magazines to choose from, magazine aggregators 
like Zinio, Next Issue Media, Magzter, Flipboard, and Pulse make it possible for cus-
tomers to find their favorite magazines using a single app. A magazine aggregator is 
a Web site or app that offers users online subscriptions and sales of many digital 
magazines. 
E-BOOKS AND ONLINE BOOK PUBLISHING
In April 2000, Stephen King, one of America’s most popular writers, published a 
novella called Riding the Bullet. This novella was only available as an e-book. King 
was the first major fiction writer to create an e-book-only volume of a new work. 
King’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, arranged for sales online through online retailers 
such as Amazon. In the first day, there were 400,000 downloads, so many that Ama-
zon’s servers crashed several times. More than 600,000 downloads occurred in the 
first week. While Amazon gave the book away for free in the first two weeks, when 
it began charging $2.50 for a 66-page novella—about the same price per page as a 
standard King hardcover novel—sales continued to be brisk. This experiment showed 
Simon & Schuster, and Amazon, that there was a mass market for e-book popular 
fiction. Previous efforts to create a popular e-book had all failed. For publishers, it 
meant their entire back list of older books suddenly had monetary value if they could 
be sold as e-book editions. 
Ten years later, on April 15, 2010, Amanda Hocking, an unknown and unpub-
lished writer from Austin, Minnesota, uploaded one of her vampire novels, My Blood 
Approves, to Amazon’s self-publishing site, and later to the Barnes & Noble e-book 
store. Her novels had been rejected by many of the publishing houses in New York. 
By March 2011, she had sold more than 1 million copies of her e-books, which gener-
ally sell for 99 cents to $2.99, and earned more than $2 million. In 2012, Hocking was 
listed as one of the Amazon 99 cent millionaires. In 2013, Hugh Howey’s self-published 
science fiction e-book Wool sold more than 500,000 copies and earned him more than 
$1 million dollars in royalties and film rights. Around 25% of Amazon’s top 100 selling 
books are now self published. Twenty-three so-called Indie (independently published) 
books have sold more than 250,000 copies, and four Indie authors have sold more than 
1 million copies of their books, according to Amazon (Alter, 2013). Admittedly these 
success stories are rare, and the vast majority of Indie authors in 2015 are unable to 
make a living, let alone $1 million. 
The book publishing industry’s experience with the Internet is very different from 
the newspaper and magazine industries. E-book editions of fiction and non-fiction 
books (so-called trade books) have been very successful, yet printed book sales have 
not collapsed and have remained about the same over time. Professional books, which 
includes college textbooks, remain almost entirely printed for a variety of reasons. 
Book publishing revenues have been stable over the last five years. In 2014, the U.S. 
book publishing industry generated $28 billion in revenue and sold 2.7 billion books 
(both e-books and printed books). Trade books (general fiction and non-fiction) gener-

ated $14.6 billion in revenue on sales of 2.3 billion books (AAP, 2015). These numbers 
are 1% higher than 2013. 
In the space of a decade, e-books have gone from an unusual experiment by a 
major author, to an everyday experience for millions of Americans, and an exciting 
new market for authors. Sales of e-books have exploded in a few short years, and the 
process of writing, selling, and distributing books has changed. U.S. e-book sales in 
2015 are expected to be $6.7 billion, 23% of all consumer book sales. By 2018, this 
percentage is expected to grow to 29% (see Figure 9.13). Accounting for e-book sales 
in the mix of total book sales is difficult because 30% of the books sold on Amazon do 
not have ISBNs (International Standard Book Numbers), and therefore, are not counted 
by the publishing industry, whose books always have ISBN identifying numbers. 
Industry-based reports on e-book sales only include those published with ISBNs, and 
Indie books generally do not have ISBNs. (Author Earnings Report, 2015). Analysts 
estimate that 25% of Amazon’s e-book sales result from Indie e-books. The industry 
estimates presented here likely underestimate e-book sales. An entire new channel 
for self-published authors now exists, a channel not controlled by the major New

York publishing companies and their professional editors. In the process, the number 
of independent book sellers­—the local book stores—has dropped significantly, from 
40,000 to only 20,000 in 2015. The book distribution market was disrupted and yet in 
2015 it is apparent that the major publishing firms have maintained their positions as 
the dominant source of book content. 
But traditional book sales have remained stable in 2015. Paperback sales are up 5% 
while hard cover book sales are stable (AAP, 2015). The triple-digit growth of e-books 
five years ago has slowed to less than 10% on a unit basis. While the Kindle platform 
unleashed a torrent of indie manuscripts from thousands of would-be writers, only a 
few well-publicized authors have achieved popular success and a living income. There-
fore, unlike the newspaper business, it’s too soon to declare that the book industry has 
been digitally destroyed or wounded, and some reason to believe that printed books 
will continue to be with us long into the future. The e-book market in the United States 
is dominated by three players: Amazon, Apple, and Barnes & Noble (see Figure 9.14).
Amazon and Apple: The New Digital Media Ecosystems
Although precursors of e-books and e-book readers began to be introduced in the 1990s 
and early 2000s, it was not until 2007 that the future of e-books was firmly established. 
In that year, Apple released the first iPhone and Amazon introduced the Kindle, which 
allowed users to download books from the Kindle store using AT&T’s cell network. 
Amazon’s bookstore is the largest online bookstore on the Internet. 
Amazon dominates e-book sales by a wide margin and uses this margin to influence e-book prices.

E-BOOK MARKET SHARE

C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  M e d i a 

In 2015, Amazon’s e-book and media store contains more than 1 million e-book 
titles and there are about 80 million adults who use e-readers like the Kindle and tablet 
computers like the iPad. One-quarter of all books sold in the United States are Kindle 
e-books, and Amazon in 2015 has about 65% of the total e-book market. Prior to the 
introduction of the iPad tablet computers, Amazon accounted for 90% of the e-book 
market. This did not last long: Apple’s entry into the e-book marketspace temporar-
ily reduced this share to 60% up until recently, when Amazon’s share of the e-book 
market returned to near 65%.
E-books received another large boost in 2010 when Apple introduced its first iPad 
tablet computer. With its large screen and access to the iTunes Store of online music, 
video, TV, and books, the iPad was an ideal media entertainment device. And with 
its high-resolution screen, the iPad was an even better e-book reader than the Kindle, 
albeit not easily slipped into a purse. While Amazon got the jump on Apple in dedi-
cated e-book readers, Apple’s approach from the beginning was a multipurpose device 
that could handle movies, music, magazines, and books, as well having a Wi-Fi con-
nection to the Internet. Apple’s iBooks Store at launch in 2010 had 60,000 titles, and 
is estimated to have about 2 million titles in 2015. Apple has an estimated 20% of the 
e-book market, although it is gaining ground on Amazon’s market share.
The result of the Amazon and Apple ecosystems, combining hardware, software, 
and online mega stores, is an explosion in online book content, readership, author-
ship, marketing, and at least a partial upending of the traditional book publishing 
and marketing channels. Traditional book publishing has similarly been altered. In 
the traditional process, authors worked with agents, who sold book manuscripts to 
editors and publishers, who sold books through bookstores, at prices determined 
largely by the publishers. Because bookstores had a vested interest in selling books 
at a profit, there was only limited discounting during clearance sales. In the new 
publishing model, authors still write books, but then bypass traditional agent and 
publisher channels and instead publish digital books that are sold on Amazon or the 
iTunes Store. Prices are determined by the author, usually much lower than tradi-
tional books depending on the popularity of the author, and the digital distributor 
takes a percentage of the sale (usually 30%). New self-published authors typically 
give away their early works to develop an audience, and then, when an audience 
appears, charge a small amount for their books, typically 99 cents to $2.99. Marketing 
occurs by word of mouth on social networks, author blogs, and public readings. While 
a small percentage of all books are produced this way, it is a growing and popular 
form of publishing and some authors are able to strike it rich. They’re called “99 
cent millionaires,” and there’s enough around to arouse the passions of thousands 
of potential writers of the great American novel, as well as lesser genres from police 
procedurals to paranormal romance writers.
E-Book Business Models
The e-book industry is composed of intermediary retailers (both brick-and-mortar 
stores and online merchants), traditional publishers, technology developers, device 
makers (e-readers), and vanity presses (self-publishing service companies). Together,

these players have pursued a wide variety of business models and developed many 
alliances in an effort to move text onto the computer screen.
There are five large publishers that dominate trade book, education, and religious 
book publishing. These traditional publishers have the largest content libraries for 
conversion to e-books and they produce over 80% of new book titles in a year. In the 
e-book marketplace, the large publishers started out using a wholesale model of 
distribution and pricing, in part because this is the same model they used with hard 
cover books. In this model, the retail store pays a wholesale price for the book and 
then decides at what price to sell it to the consumer. The retailer sets the price with, 
of course, some kind of understanding with the publisher that the book will not be 
given away for free. In the past, the wholesale price was 50% of the retail price. A 
retailer would pay the publisher a $10 wholesale price and mark it up to a $20 retail 
price. However, retailers could also determine to sell the book at a much lower sale 
price, say $5, as a way to attract readers to the store or as a close-out sale. Brick-and-
mortar stores had a vested interest in selling most books above their wholesale cost. 
With e-books, publishers discovered that some online retailers like Amazon and Apple 
might sell books below cost in order to encourage customers to purchase their e-book 
reader devices or to sell them other goods. 
In the case of e-books, publishers sought to keep their prices high enough so as 
not to discourage sales of hard cover books, which typically sell for $26. Generally, 
this meant publishers wanted e-books to sell at a retail price of $12.99 to $14.99, 
depending on the popularity of the book and the stage in the product life cycle 
(months since first publication). E-book distributors like Amazon were charged a 
wholesale price of about $9 and were expected to mark up the product to around 
$12.99 to $14.99 or more. Instead, Amazon chose to sell e-books for $9.99, at or below 
cost, in order to attract buyers to its content store to buy Kindles, and to attract new 
customers to its online retail store. Amazon lost $1 to $3 on every e-book sold, but 
recouped the money by selling Kindles for hundreds of dollars, and from additional 
sales of other products. With Amazon selling e-books at $9.99, the lowest prices on 
the Web, publishers were forced to sell their e-books on all other Web sites at the 
$9.99 Amazon price. Using this strategy, Amazon not only sold millions of Kindles 
but also sold 90% of all e-book titles on the Web in 2010 and 2011. Amazon had a near 
monopoly on e-books.
Publishers opposed Amazon’s policy as debasing the perceived value of both 
physical and digital books, and as a mortal threat to the publishers who could not 
survive if their e-books were priced at $9.99 across the Web. They claimed Amazon 
was engaging in predatory pricing, designed to destroy traditional book publishers. 
In 2010, five of the largest publishers secretly met with Steve Jobs and Apple. They 
agreed to a new pricing model called the agency model. In the agency model, the 
distributor is an agent of the publisher, and can be directed to sell e-books at a price 
determined by the publisher, around $14.99 and higher for certain titles. In return 
for a 30% commission, Apple agreed to support this model, as did Google, neither of 
whom were comfortable watching as Amazon dominated one of the hottest areas of

Web content sales. In these meetings, publishing executives discussed a common 
pricing strategy.
The agency model temporarily turned the tables on Amazon: it now had to charge 
whatever price the publishers wanted or the publishers would not sell Amazon any 
books (they would not choose Amazon as an agent for their products). A result of the 
agency model was that Amazon’s prices on e-books rose to the publisher desired levels, 
and its market share fell to 60% in 2012. Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble, and the five 
major publishers were delighted. The Justice Department was not delighted: it sued 
the five publishers and Apple for price fixing in violation of antitrust laws. All five of 
the publishers settled, but Apple refused to settle and asked for a trial before a judge. In 
2013, the United States District Court found that Apple had engaged in price fixing, not 
because of its agency pricing model, which is quite common throughout retail trade, 
but because of its “most favored seller” clause in its agreements with publishers, which 
had the effect of discouraging other sites (like Amazon) from selling e-books for less 
than Apple’s iBooks Store price. In addition, the publishers and Apple conspired to act 
in concert, rather than as individual publishers. Under the agreements, the publishers, 
not Amazon, would determine prices on Amazon. If publishers sold their books on 
Amazon for $9.95, then publishers would have to sell their e-books at the iBooks Store 
for $9.95. The court found that Apple and the book publishers’ plan would result in less 
price competition, and higher prices, by enforcing a single higher price on all online 
distributors and e-books. In the field of antitrust, less competition and higher prices 
for all is considered a cardinal violation of the law. After the ruling, e-book prices on 
Amazon have fallen to an average of $9.99, with some older titles far less, with limited 
discounting, and its market share rose to 65%. In August 2014, Apple agreed to pay a 
$450 million fine to compensate consumers for its price fixing behavior. While the ruling 
prevents Apple from fixing prices of e-books, it does nothing to solve the issues surround-
ing Amazon’s dominance of the e-book marketplace. Publishers will need to each reach 
independent marketing agreements with Amazon, one by one. Critics of the court case 
believe Amazon’s market power will force publishers to submit to Amazon’s price terms. 
In May 2014, following court rulings against the publishers, Amazon and the 
Hachette group tried to negotiate an agreement on pricing. To demonstrate its market 
power and strengthen its negotiating position, Amazon withdrew all Hachette books 
from its Web site, leading to author-organized protests. In November 2014, Hachette 
and Simon & Schuster (one of the largest publishers in the United States) agreed on 
terms with Amazon that allow the publishers to set the prices of their books (the 
agency model) but allow Amazon to offer incentives to publishers to reduce prices on 
selected books, and provide for publisher payments to Amazon for listing their books 
(Streitfield, 2014a; 2014b). Prices on e-books as a result are highly variable, ranging 
from $9.95 to $16.95. 
The Challenges of the Digital E-Book Platform
Because of the rapid growth in e-books, the book publishing industry is in stable 
condition. Yet the industry faces a number of challenges. The early fear of cannibal-
	
T h e  O n l i n e  P u b l i s h i n g  I n d u s t r y 	

651

ization, namely inexpensive and less profitable e-books replacing more expensive 
and profitable print books, has mostly been put to rest. Unlike the newspaper and 
magazine industries, printed books are surviving in large part because purchasers 
of e-book readers continue to purchase printed books, and switch back and forth 
from digital to print as circumstances merit, and because more than 50% of book 
readers continue to prefer the physical format, while only 6% of book readers use 
e-books exclusively (eMarketer, 2014d). In the professional and educational book 
markets, e-books have not yet made substantial inroads. In an Hewlett-Packard 
sponsored study, 57% of college students preferred physical books and only 21% 
preferred e-books (Tan, 2014). Several other studies have found more than 70% of 
college students prefer physical books because they find it easier to concentrate 
when using a physical book, there are fewer distractions, and comprehension and 
retention is better (Student Monitor, 2014; Marques, 2012). Students find the user 
interface of e-books more difficult to use compared to printed books. E-books may 
be like audio books, a useful alternative but not a substitute. The falling growth rate 
of e-books from double-digit to single-digit growth in the last few years may reflect 
this market reality. 
The biggest challenge facing the book publishing industry is control over pricing 
on the digital e-book platforms of Amazon, Apple, and others. Currently, Amazon 
controls the largest market share, about 65%, which, while not a monopoly, nev-
ertheless gives Amazon extraordinary market power (refer back to Figure 9.14 on 
page 672).
 For critics, Amazon threatens to decimate the traditional book publishing indus-
try, replacing the old print world of a small number of publishers, limited numbers 
of titles, several thousand independent bookstores, elitist editors in New York, and 
newspaper book critics, with a new digital world of publishing where content is shaped 
by algorithms identifying what the consumer wants to read about, writers are their 
own editors, critics are replaced by reader comments, and distribution is controlled 
by one or a few online stores (Packer, 2014). Efforts by Amazon to create its own book 
publishing brand, circumventing the traditional book publishers, have only worsened 
relations between the world’s largest book store and the world’s largest publishers 
(Streitfield, 2014). 
Amazon, as the largest player in the e-book market, offers the biggest challenge. 
This is ironic because Amazon, through its online store and Kindle e-book marketplace 
and reader, has helped the publishing industry to survive the transition to a digital 
marketplace, both by providing the largest book store on earth, and by creating the 
Kindle e-book platform. While the expansion of e-book revenues has offset a small 
decline in print sales, the industry has lost pricing power vis-à-vis its largest distribu-
tion partner, Amazon. Amazon, if not a monopoly, nevertheless exercises extraordinary 
market power over the publishers. 
A second serious challenge is the further evolution of the digital distribution 
platform. In July 2014, Amazon announced Kindle Unlimited, a subscription service 
where for $9.95 a month, customers can read all the books they want. Over 600,000 
titles are available, according to Amazon, but this Netflix for books does not include 
652	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  M e d i a 

any books from the big five publishers—Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, 
Macmillan, and Penguin Random House. How the revenue of e-book subscriptions 
is split up has not been announced, but publishing firms (and authors) would surely 
want a substantial part of that revenue before signing up. Major publishers believe 
subscription e-book services would negatively impact book publisher and author rev-
enues. Control over pricing is again the key issue. 
While the book publishing industry has survived, even prospered, in the first 
era of e-books and the digital distribution platform provided by Amazon, Apple, and 
others, the long-term prospects for book publishing revenues and profits remain an 
open question. 
Interactive Books: Converging Technologies
The future of e-books may depend in part on changes in the concept and design of a 
book. The modern e-book is not really very different from the first two-facing page, 
bound books that began to appear in seventeenth-century Europe and had already 
appeared in the fourth century BCE in ancient China. The traditional Western book 
has a very simple, nondigital operating system: text appears left to right, pages are 
numbered, there is a front and a back cover, and text pages are bound together by 
stitching or glue. In educational and reference books, there is an alphabetical index 
in the back of the book that permits direct access to the book’s content. While these 
traditional books will be with us for many years given their portability, ease of use, 
and flexibility, a parallel new world of interactive e-books is expected to emerge in the 
next five years. Interactive books combine audio, video, and photography with text, 
providing the reader with a multimedia experience thought to be more powerful than 
simply reading a book. In 2012, Apple released iBook Author, an app to help authors 
create interactive books. Hundreds of children’s books are already built as interactive 
books. In 2012, Apple also introduced iBook Textbooks, a line of interactive textbooks 
created by several of the largest textbook publishing firms. Some experts believe that 
traditional print books will be curiosities by 2020. Yet as of 2015 these newer multi-
media textbooks have not yet been successful in the marketplace (Streitfield, 2013b). 
Among the failures are Social Books, Push Pop Press, Copia, Small Demons, and Vook, 
which promised to combine video with traditional print.

THE ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
The entertainment industry is generally considered to be composed of four traditional, 
commercial players and one new arrival: television, radio broadcasting, Hollywood 
films, music, and games (the new arrival). Together, these largely separate entertain-
ment players generate $143 billion in annual U.S. revenue. This includes both digital 
and traditional format revenues. Figure 9.15 illustrates the relative sizes of these com-
mercial entertainment markets as of 2014. By far, the largest entertainment producer 
is television (broadcast, satellite, and cable), and then motion pictures, followed by 
music, radio, and games (both stand-alone and online games). While online, computer,

and console games have grown to be larger than film box office revenues (about $10 
billion), total Hollywood film revenues dwarf the game industry when other sources 
of movie revenue are added such as streaming, DVD rental and sales, and licensing. 
Radio remains a strong revenue producer aided in part by the growth of Internet radio 
services like Spotify and Pandora, but is still largely reliant on FM and AM broadcast 
technologies, especially in automobiles. Recorded music is the smallest of the major 
players at $12 billion, half of its size ten years ago. 
Along with the other content industries, the entertainment segment is undergo-
ing a transformation brought about by the Internet and the extraordinary growth of 
mobile devices. Several forces are at work. Accelerated platform development such 
as the iPhone/iPad video and music platform, other smartphones and tablets, the 
Amazon music and video platform, not to mention the Netflix streaming platform, 
have changed consumer preferences and increased demand for music, video, televi-
sion, and game entertainment delivered over Internet devices, whether in subscrip-
tion or a la carte pay-per-view forms. Social network platforms are also spurring the 
delivery of entertainment content to desktop and mobile devices. Social network sites 
are rapidly adding video to their services, as well as providing a platform for sharing 
TV and movie experiences. The iTunes store and Amazon have demonstrated suc-
cessful download music services where users pay for tracks and albums. Music sub-
scription services like Pandora, Spotify, and Rhapsody have never made a profit and 
bleed cash despite having millions of subscribers. Both kinds of services—download 
and streaming—have demonstrated that millions of consumers are willing to pay rea-

sonable prices for high-quality content, portability, and convenience. The growth in 
broadband has obviously made possible both wired and wireless delivery of all forms 
of entertainment over the Internet, potentially displacing cable and broadcast televi-
sion networks. Closed platforms, like the Kindle and streaming services like Netflix, 
also work to reduce the need for DRM. Streaming music and video are inherently 
copyright-protected because the content is never downloaded to a computer (similar 
to cable TV). All of these forces have combined in 2015 to bring about a transformation 
in the entertainment industries.
In an ideal world, consumers would be able to watch any movie, listen to any 
music, watch any TV show, and play any game, when they want, and where they 
want, using whatever Internet-connected device is convenient. Consumers would be 
billed monthly for these services by a single provider of Internet service. This ideal-
ized version of a convergent media world is many years away, but clearly this is the 
direction of the Internet-enabled entertainment industry, in part because technology 
will enable this outcome, but also because of the emergence of very large-scale, inte-
grated technology media companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, and Netflix. Many 
analysts believe the large entertainment media giants of the future will be technology 
companies that have moved into the production of content. 
When we think of the producers of entertainment in the offline world, we tend to 
think about television networks such as ABC, Fox, NBC, HBO, or CBS; Hollywood film 
studios such as MGM, Disney, Paramount, and Twenty-First Century Fox; and music 
labels such as Sony BMG, Atlantic Records, Columbia Records, and Warner Records. 
Interestingly, none of these international brand names have a significant entertain-
ment presence on the Internet. Although traditional forms of entertainment such as 
television shows and Hollywood movies are now commonplace on the Web, neither 
the television nor film industries have built an industry-wide delivery system. Instead, 
they are building relationships with tech-based Internet distributors like Netflix, Yahoo, 
Google, Amazon, Facebook, MSN, and Apple, all of whom have become significant 
players in media distribution.
ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT AUDIENCE SIZE AND GROWTH
Measuring the size and growth of the Internet content audience is far less precise than 
measuring a television audience. In fact, one of the issues facing television producers 
is an inability to count Internet viewing, or time-delayed viewing. Recognizing the 
difficulties of measuring an Internet audience, let’s first examine the use of traditional 
entertainment content, such as feature-length movies, music, online TV, online radio, 
and games. Figure 9.16 shows the current and projected growth for U.S. commercial 
online entertainment revenues for the major players: music, Internet radio, online 
TV, online games, and online video. Most noticeable is the extraordinary growth of 
online TV and movies, driven in large part by adoption of mobile devices, as well as 
the success of TV and movie streaming sites. Other forms of online entertainment 
will also continue to grow, but at single-digit rates. As the Internet takes on the dis-
tribution of TV shows and movies, the role (and revenue) of cable television delivery 
systems declines.

There will be some interesting changes by 2018. Movies will surpass music as the 
largest form of online entertainment. Online TV will grow very rapidly (by more than 
15% annually), while online games and radio remain relatively smaller generators of 
revenue, declining in significance when compared to movies, music, and TV.
TELEVISION AND PREMIUM VIDEO
In the television industry in 2015, viewers have gone mobile, Internet streaming and 
downloading distributors like Netflix and Apple have gained market power vis-à-vis 
TV and movie production firms, and cable television systems are losing ground to 
Internet and mobile app delivery of content. New streaming services provided by 
firms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon, and convenient downloading of movies and 
entire TV series, have created powerful alternatives to traditional cable television 
delivery systems. Cable distribution systems are challenged as the Internet offers 
alternative, unbundled, a la carte access to TV programs. Linear TV—watching a TV

PROJECTED GROWTH IN U.S. ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT 2013–2018
Among commercial forms of mass entertainment, online TV and movies engage the largest number of people and generate the largest online 
revenues in 2015. By 2017, TV and movies will engage more people and generate more revenue than all other forms of digital media, 
including music.

series over an entire season as installments—is being supplanted by binge watching 
of entire seasons online over a few days . This is not possible with linear TV on cable 
or broadcast platforms. Contrary to expectations, the big TV screen in the home is as 
popular as ever, supported by social networks that buzz with chat about what’s on TV 
right now. In 2015, over 153 million Americans watch TV online, about 60% of the 
Internet population (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b). Increasingly, the TV household is a cross-
platform phenomenon. Every day, Americans watch about 4½ hours of TV on tradi-
tional TV sets, but 5¾ hours online using a computer or mobile device. While teens 
continue to spend more time texting than ever, over 90% of millennials (ages 16–34 
in 2015) report watching streamed television shows and movies (eMarketer, Inc., 
2015c). The largest online TV and movie download distributor is Apple’s iTunes, which 
has 67% of the digital TV download market and 65% of the movie download market. 
No competitor comes close to producing Apple’s combined TV plus movie download 
2014 revenue of $2.1 billion annually. It’s a different story with streaming video: Netflix 
is the market leader in streaming movies and TV shows, producing $3.4 billion in 
revenue in 2014. Streaming has replaced downloading as the leading consumer video 
viewing platform. 
The television industry, the major source of premium video on the Internet, is 
beginning a transition to a new delivery platform—the Internet and mobile smart-
phones and tablet computers. As a result, the cable and satellite TV distribution model 
is challenged by new Internet competitors. Over 107 million Americans use a mobile 
phone to watch movies and television (eMarketer, Inc., 2015d). This transition closely 
follows an earlier but related transition to DVRs and time-shifting by consumers who 
no longer were constrained by television executives’ programming and scheduling 
decisions. The current transition to Internet and especially mobile delivery of televi-
sion is not leading to a decline in traditional television viewing, which has in fact 
increased slightly. The new platform is changing how, when, and where consumers 
can watch TV. Cloud computing, the storage and streaming of content from large 
Internet datacenters rather than on individual personal devices, has created a large 
shift away from ownership of content, and a focus instead on access to content any-
where, anytime, from any device as a streaming service. Streaming of movies from 
subscription services has expanded more rapidly than buying and downloading of 
movies. Social networks have enabled a new kind of social TV, where consumers 
share comments while viewing television shows. The most important activity in 
today’s television household may not be what’s on screen, but instead what’s being 
said about what’s on screen. Television rating agencies today do not have a methodol-
ogy for measuring this kind of engagement. 
Expansion of broadband networks, especially those serving mobile devices such 
as Wi-Fi and high-speed cellular networks, and the growth of cloud servers, has enabled 
the growth of a whole new class of television distributors. Cloud distributors, like 
Apple’s iCloud service and Walmart’s Vudu service, allow users to purchase video and 
movies, store them in iCloud, and view the entertainment from any device, anywhere. 
Whereas the dominant way consumers obtained a TV signal in the past was from over-

such as Apple, Google, Hulu, Vudu, Netflix, and many others, all of whom offer con-
sumers access to television shows and some full-length feature movies using the

entertainment service rides “on top” of other network services like cable TV and tele-
phone service. It’s as if we have a new Internet Broadcasting System with many new 
players. With OTT entertainment, TV does not have to be linear, and consumers do 
not have to purchase a bundle of channels, most of which they never watch. This new 
network is obviously a threat to cable television and the other distributors, who have 
their own on-demand services for television series and movies. If customers switch 
to Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, they have less incentive to continue 
paying for cable TV service. 
The Internet and the mobile platform have also changed the viewing experience. 
The best screen when commuting or traveling is the smartphone and tablet. More 
importantly, Internet-enabled social networks like Facebook and Twitter have made 
TV viewing a social experience shared among neighbors, friends, and colleagues. In 
the past, television was often a social event involving family and friends in the same 
room watching a single TV show. In 2015, the social circle has expanded to include 
Facebook and Twitter friends in different locations, changing television from a “lean 
back and enjoy” experience into a “lean forward and engage” experience. Many viewers 
are multitasking: co-viewing shows while texting, commenting, and chatting online 
while the show unfolds. 
While the Internet so far has had an expansive and positive impact on the 
television industry, challenges lie ahead. The largest providers of television in vir-
tually all countries are cable television systems that charge consumers a monthly 
service fee for providing service, often accompanied by Internet and/or telephone 
service. This service in the United States costs, on average, about $125 per month 
per household. Cable systems also generate advertising revenues from local and 
national advertisers. The revenues generated are used to maintain the physical 
cable network, and pay program producers (often called cable networks) for their 
content. For instance, HBO (Home Box Office network) creates a variety of televi-
sion shows for the nearly 11,000 local cable systems in the United States, and collects 
fees from local and national cable systems like Time Warner and their subscribers. 
ESPN, the largest sports network on TV and the Internet, charges local and national 
cable systems per-viewer fees. But with so much video available online from many 
different distributors, many users are thinking about “cutting the cable cord” and 
just relying on the Internet for their video entertainment. Other viewers are “cord 
shavers,” who have reduced their subscriptions to digital channels. Likewise, the 
improvement in over-the-air digital broadcasting of television signals has resulted 
in a slight increase in over-the-air viewers (about 15% of all television viewers). So 
far, cord cutting and shaving has been very limited and has been exaggerated. There 
are 95 million U.S. pay TV consumers, and an estimated 100,000 have cut the cord. 
Millenials are somewhat less likely to have pay TV cable service, and spend more 
time watching TV online than older consumers. But these differences also reflect 
differences in income. The vast majority of millenials watch TV like their parents 
by watching ordinary cable television (eMarketer, 2015; 2014). Nevertheless, the 
high service fees for cable television service, and expanding Internet capabilities, 
	
T h e  O n l i n e  E n t e r t a i n m e n t  I n d u s t r y 	

659

suggest that cable television growth is over, and subscriptions will fall. In August 2015, 
the U.S. stock price of media firms connected to cable television took a large loss in 
market value because of investor concerns about declining growth in traditional pay 
TV, both cable and satellite (Flint, 2015). 
FEATURE-LENGTH MOVIES
In Hollywood, the transition to a digital delivery platform is well underway, and the 
industry is poised to maintain its revenue stream based on new digital platforms. As 
consumers have become fully connected to broadband networks on mobile, desktop, 
and home TVs, Hollywood has responded with a host of new viewing options. As a 
result, consumer spending on movie entertainment, whether physical or digital, has 
been stable, with significant growth in several digital platforms (Arnold, 2014). 
The key to the success of Hollywood studios in the digital era is their control over 
original, full-length feature production, and control over who will distribute their 
movies, when, and how. Distributors—whether Internet providers or cable systems—
need to meet the terms of Hollywood studios. The dominance of Hollywood studios 
in content creation is being challenged, but for now still seems secure. An estimated 
113 million Americans will watch movies online in 2015, growing to 138 million in 
2019 (see Figure 9.17).

Aside from box office theater revenues, the movie industry derives revenue from 
both physical formats (mostly DVDs) and digital formats like selling movies for down-
load (called Electronic Sell Through or EST), selling access on cable or the Internet to 
specific movies a la carte (called Internet Video On Demand (iVOD)), and subscription 
streaming over the Internet (see Figure 9.18). 
Each of these digital formats has a leading player. The EST download leader is 
Apple’s iTunes store with about 68% of the download market and $2 billion in annual 
sales. Consumers purchase and own the downloaded movie. Apple is also the leader 
in iVOD a la carte rentals, but other major players include Amazon, Hulu, and cable 
systems, which also rent movies on demand (usually referred to as VOD without the 
‘i’ of online video). Netflix is, of course, the leading subscription streaming service, 
with about 60% of the streaming movie audience, generating an estimated $3.5 billion 
in revenue annually. Streaming has grown faster and larger than iVOD, and this is 
reflected in the market share of Netflix and Apple (see Figure 9.19). New entrants of 
significant size include Hulu, premium cable television networks such as HBO and 
Showtime, and Amazon.

Hybrid services such as Walmart’s Vudu service allow consumers to purchase a 
DVD and then also stream it later from any device. Vudu is enabled by a distribution 
channel called UltraViolet. UltraViolet is an industry-sponsored cloud-based storage 
and proof-of-purchase system. Users enter a code into their UltraViolet online account, 
which gives them access to a movie they have purchased from any device, including 
Android and Apple smartphones. There are an estimated 15 million subscribers using 
UltraViolet. 
Revenue from sale and rental of DVDs in the United States has been declining 
since 2006, sometimes at double-digit rates. In 2014, DVD revenue was $13.7 billion, 
down a whopping 15% compared to 2013. Unit sales are one-half of their 2006 levels. 
But also notice that DVD revenues are still a substantial 43% of total movie revenues. 
DVDs remain very profitable. The decline in DVD revenues is partially offset by the 
stunning growth of digital formats, especially subscription streaming, which grew 
16% in 2014 to $7.4 billion. Box office theater display of movies generated about $10.4 
billion, one-third of total movie revenues, essentially the same as the previous year. 
The net result is that Hollywood revenues were flat, at around $31.5 billion in 2014. 
Of all the content industries, the movie industry has been able to maintain its revenue 
stream and not be digitally destroyed by new technologies, at least for now. 
Hollywood faces a number of challenges as it tries to keep up with a rapidly chang-
ing distribution platform, increasingly digital, streaming, and even mobile. The fastest

growing digital streaming format does not produce much revenue on a per unit basis. 
Studios make about $4.50 on each DVD, but only $2.00 for each VOD downloaded 
movie sale, and only 50 cents for each streamed movie. This means the studios are 
under pressure to keep their new movies in the physical format of DVDs, digital 
theater display, or video downloads, and use the streaming channel (Netflix) for older 
movies that might not sell at any price without the Internet, or have already been 
seen by millions of customers. Hollywood achieves this market segmentation by con-
trolling the “release window” of movies, staggering market release. This is a form of 
price discrimination: those who really want to see the movie as soon as possible are 
willing to pay a higher price. The first tier is the theater box office, followed by DVDs, 
cable video-on-demand, then Internet video-on-demand, and finally subscription 
streaming services. Of course, the longer the studios hold a first-rate movie off the 
Internet, the greater the likelihood it will be pirated. The release window is changing 
under pressure from consumers to release films earlier to streaming and VOD services. 
Release windows are shrinking from nine months to four months, especially for poorly 
performing movies where DVD and box office sales are weak. 
A second challenge involves the growing strength of online movie distributors, 
which may become competitors. Prior to the Internet, distributors such as movie 
theater chains and DVD rental and sales stores were never in a position to create 
their own movies and enter the movie production business. But in the digital era, 
it is conceivable that distributors like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and Google have the 
financial strength to attempt to make feature-length movies, and reduce their licens-
ing costs. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have already demonstrated their ability to create 
popular TV series. Firms based on streaming are incentivized to produce their own 
content to avoid steep licensing fees demanded by Hollywood studios. For instance, 
in 2015, Netflix has an estimated $9 billion obligation to pay studios for content, and 
this accounts for 70% of its operating costs. Therefore, Netflix is investing heavily in 
original content production. 
Piracy also remains a threat to the movie and television industry, despite years of 
effort by the industry and government to reduce piracy. Nevertheless, industry studies 
find that 24% of Internet traffic worldwide involves infringing content (illegal copies 
of movies and music), and about half of this involves bit torrent traffic (Envisional, 
2013). In the United Kingdom, 30% of the Internet population has watched a pirated 
movie, either a pirated DVD or Internet download. In the United States, only 17% of 
Internet content is infringing. These numbers have declined in the last five years. 
BitTorrent is the most common illegal file transfer system. Other forms on Internet 
piracy include cyberlockers/file hosting sites (like Megaupload, now shut down), and 
third-party portals like MovieWatch and Movie2k, which link users to illegitimate 
streaming video and movie sites. 
In the past, the movie industry estimated that it lost over $6 billion a year in 
pirated movies distributed over the Internet, copied from DVDs, early production 
copies, and in-theater videoing (Bialik, 2013). More recent academic research now 
estimates the loss is closer to $2 to $3 billion in the United States, roughly 10% of the 
$30 billion movie industry in the United States (Danaher et al., 2013). Critics argue the 
release window

industry has exaggerated the losses. The emergence of multiple legitimate sources for 
streaming and downloading movies in a convenient and safe manner appears to have 
reduced the overall amount of piracy, both for movies and music. A Google research 
paper found that searches for pirated movies peaked in 2008, and have been drop-
ping steadily, while searches for online rentals and streaming are up (Google, 2011). 
As Google has moved into a closer relationship with TV and movie studios, and has 
its own ambitions to create original content, it has strengthened its efforts to reduce 
access to pirate sites. Insofar as searches are an indicator of consumer interest and 
intent, the public interest in pirated movies is declining. Services like Netflix and 
iTunes that permit access to streams of movies for $8 a month, or download rentals 
for a few dollars, have arguably reduced the motivation to pirate movies for many 
potential pirates. However, the extended release window of Hollywood increases the 
incentive and rewards for pirating recent releases.
In countries like France, which has passed strong laws to protect artists and dis-
courage illegal downloading (the HADOPI laws), once the laws were implemented, 
sales of movies on DVDs and legitimate downloading sites increased by 25% in the 
following twelve months (Danaher et al., 2013).
Government actions to close down cyberlockers also can have a powerful impact 
on movie sales. In January 2012, the U.S. government, along with other governments, 
closed down the world’s largest cyberlocker, Megaupload. In a few days, 25 petabytes of 
music and movies disappeared from the Internet. In 12 countries where Megaupload 
was the most widely used, digital revenues for two movie studios in the study were 
6–12% higher in the 18 weeks following the shutdown (Danaher and Smith, 2014; 
Fritz, 2013). With few exceptions, the academic literature produced since 2000 shows 
that piracy causes a significant reduction in sales of legitimate movies (Danaher et 
al., 2013). 
While piracy of movies persists, the industry has reduced efforts to fight it through 
legislation, or prosecution of individuals who purchase pirated movies (large piracy 
operations are still a target for the movie industry). In large part this is due to the 
expansion of digital movie platforms that make paying an $8 monthly fee to Netflix 
for thousands of hours of movies, or subscribing to Amazon Instant Video, a much 
more convenient and less risky activity than downloading virus-laden BitTorrent files. 
In essence, Hollywood and the Internet have begun to put piracy out of business by 
providing superior products and service at a very low price (Tassi, 2014).

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
HOLLYWOOD AND THE INTERNET: LET’S CUT A 
DEAL
In tough times, people go to the 
movies. All things considered, 2014 
was a good year for the movie indus-
try. Despite the continuing effects of 
the recession, or because of them, box office 
receipts were $10.4 billion in North America, 
about the same from the previous year. Global 
box office sales were also up, to $36.4 billion in 
2014, a record, and 3% higher than the previ-
ous year. Admissions were actually down slightly, 
with 1.3 billion tickets sold in the United States, 
but ticket prices were up slightly, making up for 
the decrease in the number of tickets sold. The 
number of films released in 2014 increased by 
7% to 136. And online revenues from down-
loading and streaming exploded to $7.4 billion 
(about 35% of the home movie market). In 
2014, users downloaded over 350,000 movies 
from iTunes every day. By any measure, the Hol-
lywood money machine has been transformed by 
the Internet as DVD physical unit sales declined 
to half of what they were in 2005. But, so far 
the movie business has avoided the kind of dis-
ruption that has occurred in the music business. 
People still crowd into theaters to see the latest 
movies, and while many still rent or purchase 
DVDs, many have learned to live with streamed 
movies even if they are older than what they can 
see in the theater. The reasons why Hollywood 
has survived the disruptive potential of the Inter-
net are complex. 
The Internet has made older movies more 
valuable simply because they can be inexpen-
sively stored on cloud servers, are easily dis-
covered by consumers, and can be streamed 
for nearly zero cost, producing a new revenue 
stream. Continuing sales of DVDs, and revenues 
from online streaming services and download 
sales at the iTunes Store, drive revenues higher 
for even older movies. Avatar, originally released 
in 2009, now has grossed over $760 million; 
Titanic, released in 1997, $658 million. More 
recent blockbusters include The Avengers (2012), 
generating $623 million, and Frozen (2013), 
which hit $1.2 billion in its first year. If only 
all movies could produce results like these, Hol-
lywood would be golden again. The Internet has 
made Hollywood’s backlist much more valuable. 
But all is not totally well in Tinseltown. 
Once movies are shown in theaters, where Hol-
lywood generates 30% of its revenue, they move 
on to less-profitable venues, from DVDs (which 
are very profitable) to cable television video-on-
demand services, and then to Internet distribu-
tors like Netflix and Apple for either purchase, 
rental download, or streaming. Internet stream-
ing services like Netflix are low on the Hollywood 
food chain in part because they don’t have the 
revenues to pay for the latest movies. Hollywood 
prefers to deal with Amazon, which sells and 
rents millions of DVDs, or Apple, which charges 
its customers $5–$12 for recently released 
movies for download, compared to Netflix, which 
charges only $8 a month for access to thousands 
of movies. Next in line are cable network video-
on-demand services, which charge anywhere from 
$5 to $12 a view. Eventually, movies end up with 
cable networks and broadcast television stations 
years after they were released. Even cable net-
works have greatly reduced their distribution of 
feature-length movies and replaced them with 
much less expensive unscripted reality shows. 
This “release window” differs for various films 
based on the studio’s estimate of the revenue 
potential for each film. A very popular film will 
be delayed all along the release window.

Hollywood is facing several prob-
lems moving forward to a world where most 
people will be watching movies on the Inter-
net, either at home, or on the go, using tablet 
computers and smartphones. One problem is that 
the fastest growing segment of its business, the 
Internet, is also the least profitable. A second 
problem is that Hollywood does not control its 
own Internet distribution network, but instead 
is forced to rely on the likes of Netflix, Apple, 
Amazon, and Google, each of which attract large 
online audiences. Likewise, the big Internet dis-
tributors face a content problem: they cannot 
attract large audiences unless they can access 
recently made movies. Old movies and movie 
libraries on Netflix have limited appeal; consum-
ers are looking for the latest releases. But Hol-
lywood charges a very high premium for recent 
movies, reducing profits at Netflix, which are 
already very low. 
Initially, Hollywood was highly dependent 
on Amazon’s sales of DVDs as rental revenue 
from physical stores declined. iTunes is still the 
largest downloading service of movies a la carte 
(so-called electronic sell-through, or EST). In 
the last two years, the market dynamics have 
changed, in large part because of Netflix’s 
success with its streaming video model. Why 
download to own when you can subscribe to a 
steady stream of movies? Hollywood is in the 
enviable position of being pursued by Inter-
net distributors who are short of high-quality 
content. This is very different from what hap-
pened in the music business over the last decade. 
Multiple buyers of movies have appeared, not 
just Amazon or iTunes. Google has developed 
its own home TV device (like Apple TV) that 
is a platform for movie streaming. Hulu is also 
ramping up again as a distribution platform. 
Netflix continues to dominate online movie 
revenues, with a 44% market share compared 
to Apple’s 27%. At one time, Apple had a 70% 
share of Internet movie revenue, and Hollywood 
studios feared Apple would be able to dominate 
Internet distribution and dictate prices. Now with 
Netflix dominating the streaming market, Hol-
lywood fears it will be forced to sell its product 
for a pittance compared to DVD prices. For 
this reason, Hollywood has been restricting the 
release of movies to Netflix, doling out access to 
recent movies very carefully. Hollywood would 
much prefer that fans download movies from 
Apple rather than wait to rent or stream them. 
To encourage this, Hollywood has created a new 
product called Digital HD that allows fans to 
download high definition copies of movies three 
weeks prior to their release on DVD or video-
on-demand services. There are different versions 
of Digital HD. For example, Disney Movies Any-
where allows consumers to pay for recent HD 
movies stored on a cloud server, and play them 
anywhere, anytime. Vudu (owned by Walmart) 
enables downloading of HD movies and digital 
locker storage for play later. Another service, 
UltraViolet, allows consumers to buy a digital 
copy once, store it in the cloud, and view anytime. 
Amazon’s Digital Copy service enables the pur-
chase of a digital-only movie, as well as a DVD 
with digital copy access. In these ways Hollywood 
can afford to release new movies into digital dis-
tribution channels because consumers are willing 
to pay a premium, or buy the DVD for full price 
and receive a digital cloud copy for “free.” 
Digital HD movies are priced so that they 
produce as much revenue as traditional DVDs. 
This is the first time Hollywood has changed 
its release window strategy in order to drive 
digital download sales. The studios can charge a 
premium price for new movie digital downloads, 
making this outlet more valuable than either the 
DVD channel or the video-on-demand channel 
offered by cable networks. In some cases, movie 
producers such as Disney and Sony have opened 
up their own online stores for selling recent 
releases directly to consumers. This opens the 
possibility that Hollywood studios can circumvent

Internet distributors entirely. Who needs Apple 
or Netflix or Amazon? 
More and more, large firms are entering 
the premium video downloading and stream-
ing market, and competing with one another for 
Hollywood movies, driving up prices. Amazon 
is seeking to strike deals with the studios for 
digital a la carte purchases and streaming of 
recent movies. Amazon has struck a deal with 
Viacom to purchase TV episodes and movies to 
stock its streaming service. In 2014, Amazon 
announced it would produce five original TV 
series for streaming to its Amazon Prime sub-
scribers for no additional cost. By 2015, Amazon 
had a total of 31 original series. No one knows 
who watches these series because Amazon does 
not release the figures, just like Netflix refuses 
to do. But Amazon series have received criti-
cal acclaim and an Emmy nomination for its 
comedy Transparent. It has hired Woody Allen 
to write and direct his own series. Hulu has 
begun streaming HBO and Showtime series and 
movies for an additional monthly charge. Netflix 
is clearly not the only game in town for Internet 
movie distribution. 
In the end, Hollywood and the Inter-
net need each other, and the only question 
is how to find the price, define the terms of 
trade, and cut a deal where both parties come 
out winners. The flurry of deals in 2014 and 
2015 bodes well for consumers, and probably 
for both Internet distributors and Hollywood 
studios. Consumers are finding multiple ser-
vices that allow them to watch movies on what-
ever device is convenient, and move from one 
device to another with a lot less effort than in 
the past. Given the shift of eyeballs to online 
entertainment, Hollywood is expanding its audi-
ence, maintaining and even enhancing its prices. 
With lots of Internet distributors competing, 
Hollywood gains in power from the competi-
tion among alternative distributors. Netflix will 
not have a stranglehold over the Hollywood 
studios. And Internet companies are coming up 
with even more reasons why consumers should 
forget about cable TV and watch the Internet, 
which means more ad revenues for Internet dis-
tributors. How all these calculations will work 
out remains to be seen. Tune in next year on the 
same channel.

remained relatively flat. Global sales of music fell less than 1% in 2014, to €14  billion, 
compared to €25 billion in 1999 (IFPI, 2015). 
Digital revenues now make up about 65% of all U.S. music revenues (about $4.5 
billion), and are expected to rise slowly to $5.4 billion by 2016 (see Figure 9.20). 
Revenues from CDs are declining but are still a strong performer, accounting for 
27% of the industry’s revenue (about $1.9 billion). Streaming music sales from ad 

supported streaming and subscription streaming sites now total $1.1 billion, or about 
16% of industry revenue. Digital revenues have obviously not made up for the loss of 
revenue caused by the drastic decline in CD sales. While CD sales declined 13% last 
year, vinyl sales grew around 50% from 6.1 million units sold in 2013 to 9.2 million in 
2014 (RIAA, 2015). Vinyl is escaping the niche market of hobbyists, in part due to its 
superior sound reproduction when compared to digital tracks, and a growing number 
of groups are issuing vinyl editions alongside CD editions although these are only 2% 
of industry revenues. 
For most of its history, the music industry depended on a variety of physical 
media to distribute music—acetate records, vinyl recordings, cassette tapes, and finally 
CD-ROMs. At the core of its revenue was a physical product. Since the 1950s, that 
physical product was an album—a collection of bundled songs that sold for a much 
higher price than singles. The Internet changed all that when, in 2000, a music service 
called Napster begin distributing pirated music tracks over the Internet to consumers 
using their PCs as record players. Despite the collapse of Napster due to legal chal-
lenges, hundreds of other illegal sites showed up, resulting in music industry revenues 
falling from $14 billion in 1999 to an estimated $7 billion in 2014. The appearance 
of powerful mobile media players beginning in 2001 that could be connected to the 
Internet, like Apple’s iPod, and later iPhone and iPad, and then the stunning growth

of music streaming sites, further eroded sales of CD albums. Streaming has funda-
mentally altered the sale of physical music formats because it is no longer necessary 
to “own” a physical unit in order to hear the music consumers want. 
The music industry initially resisted the development of legal digital channels of 
distribution, but ultimately and reluctantly struck deals with Apple’s new iTunes Store 
in 2003, as well as with several small subscription music services, for online distribu-
tion. By the time streaming music services appeared on the scene in 2006, the music 
industry had dropped its opposition to digital formats, and quickly reached agreements 
with Pandora, Spotify, and others to stream music on their subscription and “free” ad-
supported services in return for fees. Today, digital downloads of tracks and albums 
are widely perceived as the savior of the music industry, which was losing sales to 
piracy and file sharing. Nevertheless, revenues from the sales of digital downloads 
of individual songs from iTunes selling for 99 cents pale in comparison to revenues 
produced by CD albums. Figure 9.21 shows consumer spending on digital music in 
four different formats: single songs, albums, streaming, and ringtones. 
While some have argued that Apple’s iTunes music service offering single tracks 
for 99 cents destroyed the sales of albums, this clearly is not the case. Album down-
loads have held up well against single downloads, and actually have grown faster

than single downloads. For instance, in 2014, Adele’s 21 sold a record 11 million CDs 
and 3 million digital albums, becoming one of the most popular albums in history. 
This performance will likely be surpassed by Taylor Swift’s 1989 album, which sold 
over 4 million units (both CDs and downloads) by March 2015, just six months after 
its release. Sales of digital or CD albums appear to be a function more of the music 
quality and popularity than the format. 
There are two kinds of digital music services, each with a different business 
model: digital download and streaming subscription services. Digital download 
services (also known as download to own) are exemplified by iTunes, Amazon, 
and Google Play, where users download tracks and albums a la carte and pay a 
fee for each song. Increasingly, the songs are stored on a cloud server so users 
can listen to the music from any of several personal devices. All revenue derives 
from the sale of music albums or single tracks. Streaming subscription services 
(also known as Internet radio) like Pandora, Last.fm, iHeart, and Spotify have two 
revenue streams: ad-supported and subscription service. Ad-supported streaming 
is a freemium model that allows users access to free streamed music for a limited 
number of hours per month and relies on advertising to generate revenue for the 
free streams. The music is delivered to users from a cloud server and is not stored 
on user devices. Subscription services charge a monthly fee for ad-free music. 
About 5% of Pandora’s listeners pay a fee, similar to Spotify. Apple Music does 
not have free music and requires a monthly fee of $10 for ad-free streaming. In 
the past, most fremium services urged consumers to pay for subscriptions, but in 
fact ad revenues exceed subscription revenues by a substantial margin. Users can 
also subscribe for a monthly fee, but fewer than 10% of stream listeners pay for 
subscriptions, relying instead on the free service with ads. Sites like Pandora are 
curated sites where users select an artist they want to listen to, and then the site 
uses experts and algorithms to build a list of artists similar to the artist selected by 
the user. Users do not control what they hear and cannot repeat a selection. Spotify 
allows users to specify artists and songs. 
Digital download is the biggest part of the digital music industry. The largest 
players are iTunes and Amazon, followed by Google Play. While illegal pirated file 
sharing and downloads of music were the leading edge of a digital tide that deeply dis-
rupted the music industry beginning in the 1990s, legal digital download and stream-
ing services have put a damper on illegal music piracy. Legal digital music sources 
have saved the music label firms by generating solid revenues and profits, albeit not 
as generous as in the heyday of CDs. While music labels might make $7 on a CD sold 
at $16, they only make about 32 cents for a single track downloaded from iTunes for 
99 cents. Digital albums produce about $3 for the music labels, roughly half of a CD 
album sale. Artists are similarly impacted, facing a halving of their incomes in the 
digital environment. 
While digital downloads to own constitute the largest part of digital music rev-
enues, growth in digital downloads from services like iTunes has declined, and the 
fastest growing segment is the streaming music services. It appears that the success 
of music streaming services is cannibalizing the sales of downloads, and in 2014 the

sales of downloads declined by 10%, a trend that started in 2012. The leading players 
in streaming are Pandora, Yahoo Music, Last.fm, and Spotify. With the growth of cloud 
computing and cloud-based music services, the very concept of owning music began 
to shift instead to accessing music from any device, anywhere. Streaming music ser-
vices are adding new listeners at a growth rate of 47.5% in 2014. Unfortunately, while 
streaming services are growing listeners at a torrid pace, they have not managed to 
earn a profit because of infrastructure costs, the costs of acquiring music content from 
the music labels, and freemium revenue models supported by advertising revenues. 
For artists and music label firms, streaming services have little to offer. While music 
labels might receive 32 cents for every iTunes track they sell, they receive only .63 
of a penny on a streamed version of the same song. This revenue is split with the 
artists, who receive .32 of a penny. Rolling Stone calculated that a very popular song 
selling 1 million streams would produce revenue of $3,166 for the artist and a similar 
amount for the music label. For this reason, many artists and groups refuse to allow 
streaming of their music. 
In 2014, Taylor Swift, the world’s most popular singer, pulled her music from 
Spotify’s free service because it pays such a low royalty rate. In 2015, she similarly 
pulled her album 1989 from Apple’s newly announced Apple Music service because 
Apple was planning to not charge for the first three months of the service. Many 
other singers have withdrawn their performances from free streaming services, and 
there is a growing movement among musicians to seeking higher compensation from 
streaming sites. 
None of the streaming subscription services has ever shown a profit. It is unclear 
if streaming music is a viable business model. Pandora and the other streaming ser-
vices demonstrate negative scale: the bigger they become, the more money they lose. 
Nevertheless, investors have nevertheless poured money into Pandora and Spotify 
hoping that their large audiences can be monetized. The reason for investor optimism 
is growth. Pandora’s audience grew by 7% in 2014 to 81 million listeners, and its 
revenue by 47%, almost entirely from advertising on its free service. In 2015, Apple 
also launched its Apple Music streaming service, which competes with Pandora and 
Spotify. The music never stops.
GAMES
No Internet media content form has grown as explosively as online games. In the 
last few years, online gaming has grown faster than console gaming. Today online 
gaming is going through a significant transition, from consoles to PCs, smartphones, 
and to professional gaming as a stadium sport. In August 2015, for instance, 11,000 
fans packed into Madison Square Garden in New York to watch 10 professional players 
play the online game League of Legends (Needleman, 2015). Console gaming used to 
be the heart of the digital gaming industry, and still is from a revenue perspective. But 
this has begun to change with the introduction of smartphones and tablets, as well as 
social and casual gaming, which do not require users to purchase an expensive console 
or packaged software. Smartphones and tablets have ushered in an era of free-to-play 
and $1.99 game apps and much simpler game scenarios that do not require millions

of investment dollars. Well over 200 million Internet users play some kind of game 
online in the United States, and that number swells to over 400 million worldwide. 
In 2015, over 164 million Americans play games on mobile devices (smartphones 
and tablets), over three times as many who play games on game consoles. Casual PC 
gamers are twice as common as console gamers (about 50 million) (eMarketer, Inc., 
2015g; PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2015b). 
In the United States, revenue from digital games in all formats (mobile, PC based, 
massive multiplayer, social, and console) in 2014 was estimated at nearly $12 billion 
(Superdataresearch.com, 2015a). Other consulting firms put the total at $15 billion, 
with 30% growth to $19.5 billion by 2019 (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2015b). To put 
this in perspective, the $12 to $15 billion game sector is about one-half of the total 
Hollywood movie sector, and about twice the size of all digital music revenue in 2014. 
Online gaming alone generates a significant part of all online entertainment revenues, 
and engages nearly 60% of Internet users. 
There are five types of digital gamers. Casual gamers play games on a desktop 
or laptop computer. They are called casual gamers because they play games for a 
few minutes at a time, stop and start games, and are not intensively involved. Social 
gamers are those who play games using a Web browser or app on a social network like 
Facebook, often with friends. Mobile gamers play games using their smartphones or 
tablet computers. Mobile gamers are social gamers as well, with fleeting involvement. 
Massively multiplayer online gamers (MMO) use their computers to play with a large 
number of players around the globe. Console gamers play games online (or offline) 
using a dedicated console like Xbox, PlayStation, or Wii. Often, console gamers are 
connected over the Internet to enable group play (see Figure 9.22). 
While many more people play mobile and desktop games online, more than half of 
online gaming revenue is generated by console gamers, largely through the purchase 
of expensive physical games on DVDs or online digital downloads of the games. In 
2015, however, sales of console software on DVDs, and consoles themselves, hit a soft 
spot, and fell 25% (see Figure 9.22). In 2015, total U.S. online game revenues are 
estimated to be $15.8 billion, and $9.2 billion of that will come from sales of console 
games (not including the cost of the console itself). PC games come in second at 
$3.5 billion, about one-third of total online revenues. Mobile games will generate an 
estimated $2 billion (eMarketer, Inc., 2015h). In terms of the future, overall game rev-
enues are expected to grow by 30% to 2019, led by growth on console and PC game 
revenues (Takahashi, 2015). Mobile game revenues are the slowest growing segment 
in terms of revenue. The possibilities of selling virtual goods or displaying ads on 
mobile games apps are very limited and therefore mobile game companies need to 
rely on in-app advertising and sales of virtual goods to make their revenue targets. 
While casual and social gaming rapidly grows, most online and mobile games are free 
or nearly so, and users do not stay in the games very long. These two features make 
it difficult for gaming firms to monetize their user base by showing advertisements 
and charging for services. What gamer wants the game interrupted by an important 
message from the sponsor? The business model of social and casual gaming is still 
not settled. Marketers have just recently begun to build video marketing campaigns 
that increase a brand’s engagement and interaction with customers who are playing 
at social mobile gaming sites.

U.S. ONLINE GAMING AUDIENCE

The rapid growth of mobile game players based on tablets and smartphones is a 
sea change for the gaming industry that was previously dominated by closed-platform 
console games and hardware firms like Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, and software 
firms like Activision and Electronic Arts. The growth of smartphones, tablets, and 
mobile games has catapulted Apple’s App Store and the Google Play store into the 
leading merchants of digital games, which, of course, use Apple and Google Android 
hardware and software. Apple and Google take 30% of game sales and also benefit 
from the sales of the hardware and software needed to play the games. Mobile games 
appeal to a younger demographic, offer lower prices, and initially are often free. You 
can play mobile games anywhere you can use a phone, which is nearly everywhere. 
Console games take much longer to develop, have very large budgets, and are expen-
sive to purchase. 
The mobile platform is a more open platform that allows thousands of developers 
to create entertaining games on much smaller budgets, as well as new and innovative 
games on a faster schedule. In contrast, the console platform has evolved much more 
slowly than mobile computing. In 2014, a new Sony PlayStation replaced a seven-

year-old model, and a new Microsoft Xbox replaced an eight-year-old model. In a 
fast-moving online world, such long replacement cycles inevitably lead to declines in 
hardware sales, and limit software innovation. 
While console, PC, and online social games will continue to grow their audience 
size slowly, the fastest audience growth in the future will be in mobile games that can 
be played anywhere and anytime (Gaudiosi, 2015). In 2014, half of smartphone owners, 
46% of the population, played games on their phones. The challenge for mobile and 
PC games is to generate more revenue from their very large player base. 
One solution to PC and mobile game revenue growth is likely to be professional 
gaming, otherwise known as e-sports. E-sports, like other professional sports, is based 
on competition among teams of players. The competition at the championship level 
takes place in auditoriums attended by thousands of fans, and is watched by millions 
more on the Internet. In 2015, over 70 million people watch e-sports on the Internet. 
A single championship tournament streamed around the world attracted 8.5 million 
viewers at peak times (Plambeck, 2015; Wingfield, 2014a).
The games are broadcast over cable television channels, but more commonly 
over Internet channels like Twitch.tv. Twitch accounts for over 80% of online e-sports 
viewing in the United States, and was purchased by Amazon in 2015 for $1.1 billion. 
Twitch.tv draws peak-time audiences of nearly 1 million viewers in 2015, as many as 
MTV, TruTV, and MSNBC, to name a few cable networks. Other broadcasters include 
YouTube and Dailymotion. 
The organization of the tournaments, and the prize money for the players, is pro-
vided by the games’ publishers. The leading publisher of PC games played at profes-
sional levels is Riot Games, publisher of League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle 
game. There are twenty League of Legends professional teams that compete with one 
another. The league requires teams to hire professional video game coaches. Other 
multiplayer games suited to arena play include StarCraft II and Call of Duty. In 2015, 
Twitch.tv is the fourth largest consumer of peak-time Internet traffic (Needleman, 
2015). 
E-sports has been growing at over 50% a year in the last few years, and is expected 
to generate over $600 million in global revenue, $140 million of that in the United 
States. The e-sports leagues make money from selling tickets to arena champion-
ship games, merchandise sales, corporate sponsorships, and selling ad space during 
the broadcasts (Superdataresearch.com, 2015b). Advertisers are attracted to e-sports 
because the audience is predominantly composed of young males between the ages 
of 21 and 34, who are hard to reach using traditional media. Coca Cola, Nissan, Ford, 
and Google are among the largest sponsors of e-sports. College teams have sprung up 
across the country, including Harvard and Princeton, and Robert Morris University in 
Chicago now offers several scholarships for students who will play on its video game 
team (Wingfield, 2014b). At current rates of growth, e-sports will approach Hollywood 
in terms of global revenues, and eclipse console game revenue by 2020, transforming 
online gaming into a popular sport.

How Does This Movie End? 
I
n the Netflix online television comedy-drama series, Orange is the New Black, the 
lead character is Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a recently engaged blond 
New Yorker sent to a federal prison for a crime committed years before. Criti-
cally acclaimed, and widely followed, Orange follows in the footsteps of Netflix’s 
earlier successful online TV series House of Cards, a political insider’s tale of Washington 
politics starring Kevin Spacey. House of Cards was the first-ever online television series 
to win an Emmy award (for best director). Orange won three Emmy creative awards 
in 2014. In 2014, Netflix racked up 31 nominations, and in 2015, 34 nominations. By 
producing its own content, Netflix is able to differentiate itself from cable TV shows, as 
well as obtain content for a lower price, and attract new subscribers. 
While Netflix does not release the number of viewers for any of its original TV shows, 
executives do credit these two shows with driving the streaming service to a record 62 
million worldwide subscribers by the second quarter of 2015 (42 million in the United 
States), with growth running at a blistering pace of 2.5 million new subscribers each 
quarter. For Netflix, orange is indeed the new “black,” as in a positive top line revenue. 
Netflix shares doubled in 2015 and soared to over $700 a share (from its $15 offering 
price in 2002). It is currently selling at over 220 times its projected earnings, much more 
expensive than Google, Facebook, or other tech companies.  Revenues in 2014 were $5.5 
billion, up 28% from 2013, but profits were a paltry $226 million.

Netflix got its start as a mail order company renting DVDs of older Hollywood 
movies using the postal system. Founded by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Marc 
Randolph and Reed Hastings, in 1997, the company started by renting individual 
copies of 900 DVD movie titles and delivering them to customers by postal mail. In 
2000, it switched to a subscription model where customers could receive DVDs on a 
regular basis for a monthly fee. By 2006, it had delivered its billionth DVD and became 
the largest subscription provider of DVDs. In 2007, Netflix began a video-on-demand 
streaming service of movies although it still retains a DVD subscription business. In 
2015, Netflix is the largest player in the movie and TV series streaming market, and 
consumes over 37% of the U.S. Internet bandwidth to serve its customers. 
Netflix is one of those Silicon Valley stories that might make a good movie, or 
even a television series, because of its potential for disrupting the American televi-
sion and movie landscape (or what’s called premium video). It’s a dream-come-true 
story of accomplishment, pluck, innovation, and Internet technology. In a few short 
years Netflix created the largest DVD rental business in the country, then created the 
largest streaming video service. Today Netflix accounts for over 90% of digital movie 
streaming, while its chief streaming competitors, Amazon and Hulu, make up the 
remaining market; Netflix has created the largest database on consumer video prefer-
ences and built a recommendation system that encourages consumers to see more 
movies; Netflix discovered that older TV series had strong niche followings and built 
a new model of “binge watching” where consumers could watch all the episodes of a 
series in several sittings. Finally, Netflix has entered the content creation business by 
developing original TV series. 
In the movie and TV business there are only two ways to make money: either 
own the content or own the pipes that deliver the content. All the better if you can do 
both. Netflix has turned itself into a major pipeline to 42 million Internet users in the 
United States and is increasingly recognized as an important pipeline to large audi-
ences. For instance, in 2013, Netflix announced a deal with the Weinstein Company, 
a major American film studio and producer of ten Academy Award films, to become 
the exclusive subscription TV home for the film studio’s content, beginning in 2016. 
This move puts Netflix into the same league of premium channel distributors and in 
direct competition with other cable networks like HBO, Starz, Showtime, and A&E for 
the rights to show movies about eight months after their theater run is complete. In 
2014, Netflix and Warner Brothers agreed to have Netflix become the exclusive Internet 
distributor of the Batman series prequel Gotham.  
In one possible ending scenario for the Netflix movie, the company challenges the 
much larger cable television industry, which is based on an entirely different technol-
ogy and business model, namely, selling expensive bundles of hundreds of TV chan-
nels that few people watch, then raising monthly fees faster than the rate of inflation. 
Given Netflix’s large national audience of streamers, the company makes new friends 
in Hollywood and New York that are looking for ways to distribute their shows to a 
new online, mobile, and social world; Hollywood stretches the distribution window 
so that Internet distributors like Netflix get the same treatment as cable systems by 
allowing them to show the latest movies and shows at about the same time as cable 
systems. And the cable television industry is forced to retreat from its bundling prac-
676

tices and offer customers the ability to select just those channels they actually watch. 
Cable industry revenues plunge as a result. In this dream scenario, Netflix goes on 
to challenge the cable networks by producing its own original TV dramas, and adds 
comedy and documentaries to the mix. A story with a happy ending for Netflix! But 
happy endings happen mostly in Hollywood. 
The outcome of this movie depends on how well Netflix can deal with some con-
siderable challenges. For instance, one source of Netflix’s poor profitability is that the 
costs of content are very high, both purchased older series as well as new content, 
which is far more risky. The owners of older cable TV series and Hollywood movies 
charge Netflix for the privilege of distributing their content as much as they do estab-
lished cable TV networks. In 2014 Netflix reported streaming content obligations to 
content producers of $9.4 billion!  With $5.5 billion in gross revenue, it paid out $5 
billion in expenses, almost entirely payments to content producers (about $4.5 billion), 
and some marketing.  Netflix barely makes any profit on its $5.5 billion in revenue 
(about $266 million, a profit margin of about 5%).  Netflix is, after all, just a delivery 
platform, and the company is in a constant bidding war with both cable and Internet 
giants all looking for the same thing—popular TV series with a built-in audience, on 
the cheap. But content owners have wised up to the value of their backlist TV series 
and have raised their prices accordingly. Series just a year old are very expensive or 
non-existent. For instance, in 2008, Netflix reached a $30 million deal with the Starz 
cable network for several popular TV series and movies. When the deal came up for 
renewal in 2012, Starz wanted $300 million. Netflix is paying hundreds of millions to 
Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, and MGM to license hit shows and movies. As a result 
of content owners charging more, the costs of its large and frequently updated content 
library are rising more quickly than its revenues. In an effort to reduce the cost of 
licensing, Netflix began production of its own content. But this is very expensive as 
well. The critically acclaimed House of Cards cost Netflix $100 million for 26 episodes, 
$4 million an episode. Older content like Madmen runs about $1 million an episode. 
It’s possible that Netflix does not scale, and that the more subscribers it has, the less 
profit it makes because the cost of doing business rises faster than revenue. 
A second challenge Netflix faces is the risk of creating new content. It’s not as 
if wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneurs can fly to Hollywood or New York with lots 
of cash and simply purchase new content. As one pundit noted, this might lead to a 
mugging, but not a successful TV series or movie. Silicon Valley is generally not the 
place to go if you’re looking for story tellers, writers, producers, directors, talent agents, 
and cinematographers. Algorithms don’t come up with new ideas for novels, plays, 
movies, or TV series. Netflix started out as a recycler of old TV and movie content, 
and like HBO in the cable world, is trying to expand into original content production 
both to reduce costs and to build a brand name as a content creator, not just a middle 
man. Content can be sold and re-sold to cable networks, or other Internet distributors. 
But there is considerable risk in original content, long-form TV or Hollywood quality 
video. Older series are proven series, and Netflix can identify which of its customers 
watched the series in previous years, and estimate the audience size, and whether 
new subscribers will be attracted by the re-plays. But when it comes to new TV series, 
Netflix has tried to use its algorithms to predict what new series its customers might

be interested in with mixed results. Netflix has produced some real winners according 
to critics, but it has also produced some real losers that did not get critical acclaim like 
Lillyhammer, Hemlock Grove, and Bad Samaritans. While Netflix’s House of Cards and 
Orange Is the New Black have garnered half a dozen Emmies, HBO (the cable-based 
network in business since 1972) has over 400 Emmies. There has been only one tech 
company in history that was successful with video content production for movies or 
television, and that is Pixar, Steve Job’s firm, which pioneered animated feature length 
movies. It is impossible to know how well Netflix’s original content is performing 
because the company refuses to release this data. In 2015, Nielsen has begun a rating 
service for Netflix shows.  This service is paid for by the content producers who will 
base their charges in part on how many Netflix subscribers stream their shows.   
While Netflix stands out as a powerful Internet brand today, Netflix has many 
powerful competitors. Netflix does not have unique technology. In fact, streaming 
technology is widespread and well understood. The success of Netflix’s streaming 
model has attracted Amazon, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and content producers like Hulu 
and HBO to the fray. In September 2015, Verizon announced a free, ad-supported 
mobile streaming service call Go90, aimed at Millennials who routinely watch video 
on their smartphones. Some of these firms are tech firms with very large Internet 
audiences, strong brand names, and a good understanding of what their millions of 
online customers want. 
Apple is the leader in downloaded movies where customers own or rent movies, 
and of course, it does own iTunes, the world’s largest online media store for the pur-
chase of music, videos, and TV series. HBO, founded in 1972, is the oldest and most 
successful pay television service in the United States with over 35 million cable TV 
subscribers, and the originator of a long list of highly successful original TV series 
and movies such as Sex and the City, The Sopranos, The Wire, Game of Thrones, and 
True Blood. If Netflix has a direct competitor on the creative front, it is HBO, a more 
traditional programmer that does not use computer algorithms to design its content, 
but instead relies on the hunches and gifts of editors, producers, and directors to 
produce its content. 
Netflix’s competitors have very deep pockets. This means Netflix also has competi-
tors for talent and the production of new content, and perhaps price pressure as well. 
For instance, Amazon offers free streaming to Amazon Prime customers, and in 2014 
has taken on HBO TV series to stream to Prime customers without additional fees. 
Google is actively pursuing long-form content creators for its video channel program. 
There is no cost to Google users because the service is ad supported. 
So another possible ending for the Netflix movie is that ultimately it can’t compete 
with Apple, Google, Yahoo, Hulu, and Amazon, or the content producers like CBS and 
HBO Now, which have started their own streaming services. Netflix can be imitated 
by its competitors, and its profitability reduced to less than shareholders can tolerate. 
Apple’s 2014 revenue was a staggering $182 billion, 33 times larger than Netflix, and 
it has a cash reserve of $155 billion. It is entirely within Apple’s capabilities, or Ama-
zon’s or Google’s, and many others’ to develop a competing streaming video service. 
In August 2015 Wall Street finally got the message that Netflix was facing a slew of 
streaming competitors, and its stock fell over 20%. This show is not over until the last 
episode is finished. Stay tuned.

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the major trends in the consumption of media and online content, the major revenue models for digital 
content delivery, digital rights management, and the concept of media convergence.
•	
Major trends in the consumption of media and online content include the following:
•	
The average American adult spends around 4,300 hours per year consuming various media. The 
most hours are spent online, using a desktop or mobile device, followed by watching television and 
listening to the radio.
•	
Although several studies indicate that time spent on the Internet reduces consumer time available 
for other media, recent data reveals a more complex picture, as Internet users multitask and con-
sume more media of all types than do non-Internet users. 
•	
In terms of all media revenue, print media (newspapers, books, and magazines) and television/
home video each account for about the same amount of revenue (about 34%). Internet media (music 
and video) currently accounts for only 8.7% of all media revenue.
•	
The three major revenue models for digital content delivery are the subscription, a la carte, and 
advertising-supported (free and freemium) models.
•	
In terms of paid online content, online TV and movies is the largest and fastest growing form of 
online entertainment.
•	
Digital rights management (DRM) refers to the combination of technical and legal means for protect-
ing digital content from reproduction without permission. Walled gardens are a kind of DRM that 
restrict the widespread sharing of content.
•	
The concept of media convergence has three dimensions:
•	
Technological convergence, which refers to the development of hybrid devices that can combine the 
functionality of two or more media platforms, such as books, newspapers, television, radio, and ste-
reo equipment, into a single device.
•	
Content convergence, with respect to content design, production, and distribution.
•	
Industry convergence, which refers to the merger of media enterprises into powerful, synergistic 
combinations that can cross-market content on many different platforms and create works that use 
multiple platforms.

In the early years of e-commerce, many believed that media convergence would occur quickly. 
However, many early efforts failed, and new efforts are just now appearing.

Understand the key factors affecting the online publishing industry.
•	
Key factors affecting online newspapers include:
•	
Audience size and growth. Although the newspaper industry as a whole is the most troubled part of 
the publishing industry, online readership of newspapers is growing, fueled by smartphones, e-read-
ers, and tablet computers.
•	
Revenue models and results. Online newspapers predominantly rely on both advertising and subscrip-
tion revenues. Digital ad revenues are not sufficient to cover losses in print advertising.
•	
Key factors affecting online magazines include:
•	
Online audience and growth: Digital magazine sales have soared, with almost a third of the Internet 
population now reading magazines online.
•	
Magazine aggregation: Magazine aggregators (Web sites or apps) offer users online subscriptions and 
sales of many digital magazines.
•	
Key factors affecting e-books and online book publishing include:
•	
Audience size and growth. E-book sales growth has leveled off following an explosive growth period. 
Growth today is fueled by the Amazon Kindle, Apple iPad, and smartphones. The mobile platform of 
smartphones and tablets has made millions of books available online at a lower price than print 
books. The future of the book will be digital although printed books will not disappear for many 
years.
•	
Challenges. The two primary challenges facing e-book publishing are control over pricing and the 
continued evolution of the e-book model, including rentals and subscription services. 
•	
Competing business models. E-book business models include the wholesale model and the agency 
model.
•	
Convergence. The publishing industry is making steady progress toward media convergence. Newly 
authored e-books are appearing with interactive rich media, which allow the user to click on icons 
for videos or other material. 
Understand the key factors affecting the online entertainment industry.
•	
There are five main players in the entertainment sector: television, motion pictures, music, games, and 
radio broadcasting. The entertainment segment is currently undergoing great change, brought about by 
the Internet and the mobile platform. Consumers have begun to accept paying for content and also to 
expect to be able to access online entertainment from any device at any time.
•	
Key factors include the following:
•	
Audience size and growth. The audience for online movies and television is growing dramatically.
•	
The emergence of streaming services and the mobile platform. In the movie and television industries, 
two major trends are the move to streaming services, from Amazon, Apple, to Hulu and other chan-
nels, and the continued increase in online purchases and downloads. Although physical sales of 
products (DVDs) are dropping significantly, more and more consumers are purchasing movies and 
television episodes on mobile devices. 
•	
The music industry is experiencing similar trends as the movie industry: the growth of streaming 
services, or Internet radio, the continued expansion of online purchases, and increased downloads 
on mobile devices. However, the unbundling of a traditional music product, the album, into individ-
ual songs, has decimated music industry revenues. 
•	
Of the four types of gamers—casual, social, mobile, and console—the greatest growth is anticipated 
for mobile gamers, as the mobile market is rapidly expanding along all e-commerce fronts.

will be good for the practice of journalism? Develop a reasoned argument on either side of the issue 
and write a 3- to 5-page report on the topic. Include in your discussion the barriers to convergence and 
whether these restrictions should be eased.
	 2.	 Go to Amazon and explore the different digital media products that are available. For each kind of digital 
media product, describe how Amazon’s presence has altered the industry that creates, produces, and 
distributes this content. Prepare a presentation to convey your findings to the class. 
	 3.	 Identify three online sources of content that exemplify one of the three digital content revenue models 
(subscription, a la carte, and advertising-supported) discussed in the chapter. Describe how each site 
works, and how it generates revenue. Describe how each site provides value to the consumer. Which 
type of revenue model do you prefer, and why? 
	 4.	 Identify a popular online magazine that also has an offline subscription or newsstand edition. What 
advantages (and disadvantages) does the online edition have when compared to the offline physical 
edition? Has technology platform, content design, or industry structure convergence occurred in the 
online magazine industry? Prepare a short report discussing this issue.
	 5. 	 In August 2014, Amazon purchased Twitch, which lets users stream their video game sessions, for 
almost $1 billion. Why would Amazon spend so much money on Twitch? Create a short presentation 
either defending the purchase or explaining why you think it was a bad idea.

iadeo is a French professional social 
network site with over 65 million 
members worldwide. It is the leading 
professional network in France and China and the sec-
ond-largest professional social network after LinkedIn, 
which is based in the United States. A recent study 
found that in France, almost 80% of people con-
tacted by recruiters using social media were contacted 
through Viadeo. In 2014, Viadeo launched a highly 
anticipated IPO after several successful rounds of 
venture capital financing in previous years.
Like LinkedIn, Viadeo attracts professionals who want to publish their resumes, estab-
lish relationships with other professionals, and discover new clients, potential employees, 
even business partners. Viadeo offers these services for free to individuals. It generates 
revenue from businesses that pay fees in order to search the professional database created 
by participating individuals. Viadeo claims that each month, it adds more than 1 million 
new members and 10 million new connections are made. Over 100 million profiles are 
also viewed each month. Its business model is based on its ability to monetize its rapidly 
growing user audience by providing human resource and advertising opportunities to busi-
ness firms worldwide. In 2015, Viadeo reached the 10-million-member milestone in France.
Viadeo’s global strategy is twofold. First, it wants to be the top non-English speaking 
network in the world. The company employs over 450 staff members worldwide. In addition 
to its Paris headquarters, Viadeo has offices and teams in the rest of the EU-5, the United 
States, Russia, China, India, Mexico, Senegal, and Morocco. In Africa as a whole, Viadeo 
has over 2 million members, including 1 million in the Maghreb region, and it has stated that 
Africa is a very important continent for the company. In China, it is the leading professional 
social network site, and it is also the dominant site in Europe and Latin America.
A second element in its global strategy is what the company calls a “multi-local” ap-
proach to social networks. In contrast to LinkedIn, Viadeo claims to uniquely adjust to and 
honor the language, business, and popular cultures of the countries in which it operates. It 
goes beyond simple translation and focuses on catering to and understanding the business 
and cultural needs of each market. For example, in China, where its subsidiary Tianji now 
has over 20 million members, Viadeo focuses on upper-level professionals who are gradu-
ates of China’s top universities and business firms and want to meet local professionals and 
do business in China. 
Viadeo has also experienced an uptick in mobile usage that is driving its growth. After 
releasing its iOS app in 2013, the company launched a flagship Android app in early 2014

and a professional networking app called Let’s Meet in 2015. Over half of Viadeo’s users 
logged on using the company’s mobile app in 2015 and in 2014. Viadeo also launched its 
first round of native app advertising, offering sponsored articles and suggested apps that 
are displayed unobtrusively to app users, with other options including companies that are 
hiring and sponsored job offers. The company allows advertisers to offer extremely precise 
and granular advertising, with ads targeted toward very specific careers and skills, to an au-
dience already interested in that type of content. In 2015, Viadeo launched a subscription-
based marketplace for freelancers, where users looking for work pay a flat monthly fee to 
view posted jobs. Users can view projects for free but must pay for the ability to contact cli-
ents. The company also partnered with French startup Algolia to bolster its search function, 
improving speed and accuracy while allowing users to filter results more precisely.
Viadeo’s biggest competitor and potential impediment to its future prospects is 
LinkedIn, currently the world’s leading professional network. LinkedIn is an online network 
with more than 400 million worldwide members in over 200 countries, representing 170 dif-
ferent industries. LinkedIn allows a member to create a profile, including a photo, to summa-
rize his or her professional accomplishments. LinkedIn also has a multi-local strategy: the 
site has versions in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, 
Romanian, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Czech, Polish, Korean, Indonesian, and Malay. In 
2011 LinkedIn went public in what was, at the time, the biggest Internet IPO since Google, 
raising more than $350 million and giving it a company valuation of $8.9 billion. Its stock 
has more than doubled since then, continuing to hover around its all-time high level through-
out 2015. Viadeo’s stock, on the other hand, has plummeted since its 2014 IPO. After open-
ing at approximately €17 per share, the stock price is now down to just €2 in late 2015 as 
it struggles to achieve results in markets outside of France. While analysts have noted the 
company’s profitability to date, they are unsure of its prospects for growth given the strength 
of LinkedIn and more specialized local competitors such as Ushi in China. In 2015, while 
Viadeo posted solid 14% overall revenue growth outside of China, revenues in China plum-
meted in the third quarter compared to the previous year’s levels, and online membership 
figures have plunged both in China and elsewhere.
LinkedIn also has a Chinese presence, and would, of course, also like to be the leading 
professional network in China. But as Viadeo has learned, doing business in China is quite 
different than elsewhere. First there is the question of whether a free-spirited social net-
work can survive government censorship. For instance, both Facebook and Twitter have been 
banned in China. There is a strong popular sentiment in China to support Chinese companies. 
Also, the business culture is different in China: for instance, face-to-face meetings are pre-
ferred, and doing business with strangers is distrusted. In this sense, online social networks 
need to focus on facilitating offline connections, something that a site like MeetUp in the 
United States does quite well. Up until now, both Viadeo and LinkedIn have been allowed 
to operate in China, but gaining a foothold in this difficult market may be more trouble than 
it’s worth for many companies. Going forward, LinkedIn may opt to acquire Viadeo to bol-
ster its presence in China and other world markets.

n this chapter, we discuss social networks, auctions, and portals. What do 
social networks, auctions, and portals have in common? They are all based 
on feelings of shared interest and self-identification—in short, a sense of com-
munity. Social networks and online communities explicitly attract people with shared 
affinities, such as ethnicity, gender, religion, and political views, or shared interests, 
such as hobbies, sports, and vacations. The auction site eBay started as a community 
of people interested in trading unwanted but functional items for which there was 
no ready commercial market. That community turned out to be huge—much larger 
than anyone expected. Portals also contain strong elements of community by provid-
ing access to community-fostering technologies such as e-mail, chat groups, bulletin 
boards, and discussion forums.
	10.1	 SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ONLINE COMMUNITIES
The Internet was designed originally as a communications medium to connect sci-
entists in computer science departments around the continental United States. From 
the beginning, the Internet was intended, in part, as a community-building technol-
ogy that would allow scientists to share data, knowledge, and opinions in a real-time 
online environment (see Chapter 2) (Hiltzik, 1999). The result of this early Internet 
was the first “virtual communities” (Rheingold, 1993). As the Internet grew in the late 
1980s to include scientists from many disciplines and university campuses, thousands 
of virtual communities sprang up among small groups of scientists in very different 
disciplines that communicated regularly using Internet e-mail, listservs, and bulletin 
boards. The first articles and books on the new electronic communities began appearing 
in the mid- to late 1980s (Kiesler et al., 1984; Kiesler, 1986). One of the earliest online 
communities, The Well (Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link), was formed in San Francisco in 
1985 by a small group of people who once shared an 1,800-acre commune in Tennes-
see. The Well continues to have thousands of members devoted to discussion, debate, 
advice, and help (Hafner, 1997; Rheingold, 1998). With the development of the Web in 
the early 1990s, millions of people began obtaining Internet accounts and Web e-mail, 
and the community-building impact of the Internet strengthened. By the late 1990s, 
the commercial value of online communities was recognized as a potential new busi-
ness model (Hagel and Armstrong, 1997).
The early online communities involved a relatively small number of Web aficiona-
dos, and users with intense interests in technology, politics, literature, and ideas. The 
technology was largely limited to posting text messages on bulletin boards sponsored by 
the community, and one-to-one or one-to-many e-mails. In addition to The Well, early 
networks included GeoCities, a Web site hosting service based on neighborhoods. By 
2002, however, the nature of online communities had begun to change. User-created 
Web sites called blogs became inexpensive and easy to set up without any technical 
expertise. Photo sites enabled convenient sharing of photos. Beginning in 2007, the 

688	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o m m u n i t i e s 
growth of mobile devices like smartphones, tablet computers, digital cameras, and 
portable media devices enabled sharing of rich media such as photos, music, and 
videos. Suddenly there was a much wider audience for sharing interests and activities, 
and much more to share. 
A new culture emerged as well. The broad democratization of the technology 
and its spread to the larger population meant that online social networks were no 
longer limited to a small group but instead broadened to include a much wider set 
of people and tastes, especially pre-teens, teens, and college students who were 
the fastest to adopt many of these new technologies. Entire families and friendship 
networks soon joined. The new social network culture is very personal and “me” 
centered, displaying photos and broadcasting personal activities, interests, hobbies, 
and relationships on social network profiles. In an online social network, the “news” 
is not something that happened somewhere else to other people; instead, the news is 
what happened to you today, and what’s going on with your friends and colleagues. 
Today’s social networks are as much a sociological phenomenon as they are a tech-
nology phenomenon. 
Currently, social network participation is one of the most common usages of 
the Internet. Almost two-thirds of all Internet users worldwide use social networks 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). Facebook has over 1.5 billion active users of its Web site and 
a little over 1.3 billion mobile monthly users (Facebook, 2015). There is obviously an 
overlap between these two sets of users. Google+ is included here as a social network, 
but in 2015, Google has been downplaying Google+, and cutting the link between 
Google+ and its other services such as YouTube. In the past, a Google+ account was 
required in order to be able to fully use any of Google’s other services as a subscriber. 
As a result, Google+ subscriber numbers included many people who were using some 
other Google service. Google+ has never achieved the success of other social networks 
such as Facebook or Instagram (Miners, 2015d). Other large social networks include 
LinkedIn (profiled in the opening case), Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr. 
While Facebook is the most popular social network, it is also the slowest growing, up 
just a few percentage points since 2012. Facebook appears to have hit a plateau in the 
United States, and its real hope for growth is offshore, where it is pushing to create 
basic Internet access so more people will join the network. Newer social networks, 
such as Pinterest and Instagram, have doubled in the past three years to 31% and 28% 
of Internet users (Pew Research, 2015). 
Worldwide, the social network phenomena is even stronger with more than 2 
billion users worldwide, 28% of the world’s population, and still growing at 9% annu-
ally. Social networks are a top online destination in every country, accounting for 
the majority of time spent online, and reaching over 60% of active Internet users. 
Asia-Pacific has the largest social network audience (1.1 billion), followed by the 
Middle East and Africa (256 million), and Latin America (238 million), while North 
America has the highest penetration of social network usage among the general 
population (56%) (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). Although Facebook dominates the global 
social network marketspace, in some countries, localized social networks are signfi-
cant, such as Orkut (owned by Google) in Brazil, Mixi and social messaging app

LINE in Japan, Qzone, QQ, Sina Weibo, and RenRen in China, XING in Germany, 
Tuenti in Spain, and VK in Russia. There is an online social network for you to join 
almost anywhere you go! Unfortunately, there’s very little, if any, communication 
across social networks. 
WHAT IS AN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK?
So exactly how do we define an online social network, and how is it any different 
from, say, an offline social network? Sociologists, who frequently criticize modern 
society for having destroyed traditional communities, unfortunately have not given 
us very good definitions of social networks and community. One study examined 94 
different sociological definitions of community and found four areas of agreement. 
Social networks involve (a) a group of people, (b) shared social interaction, (c) 
common ties among members, and (d) people who share an area for some period of 
time (Hillery, 1955). This will be our working definition of a social network. Social 
networks do not necessarily have shared goals, purposes, or intentions. Indeed, 
social networks can be places where people just “hang out,” share space, and com-
municate.
It’s a short step to defining an online social network as an area online where 
people who share common ties can interact with one another. This definition is 
very close to that of Howard Rheingold’s—one of The Well’s early participants—who 
coined the term virtual communities as “cultural aggregations that emerge when 
enough people bump into each other often enough in cyberspace.” It is a group of 
people who may or may not meet one another face to face, and who exchange words 
and ideas through the mediation of an online social meeting space. The Internet 
removes the geographic and time limitations of offline social networks. To be in an 
online network, you don’t need to meet face to face, in a common room, at a common 
time. 
THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ONLINE COMMUNITIES
Figure 10.1 shows the top social networks in the United States, which together account 
for well over 90% of the Internet’s social network activity. 
While those between the ages of 12 and 34 still have the highest rates of Facebook 
usage, ranging from 78% to 88%, two-thirds of those between 35 and 44 use Facebook, as 
do half of 45- to 64-year-olds. Surprisingly, adults over 65 comprise the fastest growing 
group on Facebook. Similar patterns are observed worldwide as older populations use 
social networks to stay in touch with children and relatives (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a). 
Facebook is the most popular social network among teens (71% use Facebook), with 
Instagram and Snapchat not far behind (Miners, 2015a). 
More so than Facebook, Twitter is predominantly used by young adults (18–34). 
Only about 16% of 35- to 44-year-olds report using Twitter. Newer social networks tend 
to follow this same pattern, with young people being the first adopters. 
While Facebook and Twitter still tend to dominate the news, a new kind of 
social network is appearing and growing much faster than Facebook with respect to

shared social interaction, 
common ties among 
members, and people who

unique visitors and subscribers. These new social networks are attracting marketers 
and advertisers as well. For instance, Pinterest is a visually oriented site that allows 
users to curate their tastes and preferences, expressed in visual arts. You can think 
of Pinterest as a visual blog. Users post images to an online “pinboard.” The images 
can come from any source. Users can also “re-pin” images they see on Pinterest. Pin-
terest’s membership has skyrocketed since its launch, accumulating more than 100 
million active members worldwide as of September 2015. Instagram is another social 
network that focuses on video and photo sharing. A mobile app that enables a user 
to easily share images to social networks, Instagram was acquired by Facebook for $1 
billion in 2012 and has over 400 million members in September 2015. Tumblr is an 
easy-to-use blogging site with tools for visual and text curating, sharing with others, 
and reblogging contents. Tumblr started in 2007, was acquired by Yahoo in 2013, and 
has around 20 million users in 2015.
Other social networks are not necessarily competing with Facebook, but adding 
to the social network mix and enlarging the total social network audience. Table 10.1 
describes some other popular social networks. 
Contributing to the continued growth and commercial success of networks is the 
rapid adoption and intense use of mobile devices. About 82% of Facebook’s users are 
mobile users although not exclusively. Several of the largest newer social networks 
like Instagram, Snapchat, and Vine are almost entirely mobile. In 2015, over 76% of 
Facebook is by far and away the dominant social network in the United States in terms of monthly unique 
visitors.

Facebook’s revenue comes from mobile users. See the Insight on Technology case, The 
Appification of Facebook, for more on the way apps are transforming Facebook.
A new crop of social networks launched since 2008 focuses on messaging, either 
sending of text or photos. Snapchat (2009) lets users send photos to friends that self-
extinguish in ten seconds. Slingshot (2014) lets Facebook users instant message photos 
and video to their Facebook friends. WhatsApp (2009; acquired by Facebook in 2014) 
is a messaging service that, for $1, lets users send text, photos, and videos to their 
friends’ cellphones using the Internet and without having to pay telecommunications 
companies for cellphone SMS messaging services. Six of the world’s most-used apps 
are messaging services. At Facebook, users reportedly use WhatsApp and Messen-
ger over 25 times a day but visit their Facebook News Feed only fifteen times a day 
(Seetharaman, 2015). It is unclear if these social networks based on messaging are 
economically viable on their own or if they will only flourish as within more success-
ful social networks like Facebook. 
The number of unique visitors is just one way to measure the influence of a site. 
Time on site is another important metric. The more time people spend on a site, 
called engagement, the more time to display ads and generate revenue. In this sense, 
Facebook is much more addictive and immersive than the other top social networks. 
Over time, Facebook has tweaked its content and algorithms in order to keep users on 
the site longer. In 2014, Facebook added videos (both ads and user-contributed), and in 
2015 is now displaying around 4 billion videos a day. It tries to show videos that reflect 
the user’s interests and friends and also plays them automatically in the News Feed, 
forcing users to turn them off but also ensuring that they are seen for at least a few

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THE APPIFICATION OF FACEBOOK
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg 
first envisioned Facebook as a uni-
tary experience, a place where all your 
social needs could be addressed. This 
approach fit with the branding strategy 
of Facebook connecting people all around the 
world and the Facebook mobile app used a similar 
all-in-one interface for many years. However, in an 
effort to create a more mobile-friendly experience, 
Facebook is moving from a single do-it-all app to 
a collection of apps that stand alone and compete 
with other apps in specific categories. This will allow 
the main Facebook app to focus on what it does 
best—posting updates and displaying the News 
Feed and Timelines of users while other functions 
of Facebook will operate separately. It’s a risky 
strategy that worried investors at first and has met 
with mixed results, including some major successes. 
The first app split off was Messenger, previ-
ously a functionality within Facebook that is used 
by hundreds of millions around the world. The Mes-
senger function within Facebook’s app was turned 
off and replaced by an icon. When users press the 
icon, the Messenger app launches.The Messenger 
app is faster and leaner than its predecessor, and 
can be more easily customized by the user. As 
a result, messages can be delivered 20% faster 
than before. Other new features include the ability 
to set up groups of contacts based on the user’s 
cell phone contacts, create groups of contacts for 
different purposes (such as a party or trip), and 
deliver quick voice messages and photos. Privacy 
advocates have balked at Messenger’s ability to 
automatically attach the user’s location to each 
message, which is very appealing to advertisers 
offering location-based ads.
To further the long-term strategy of develop-
ing Facebook as a collection of stand-alone apps, 
Facebook created a new unit called Creative Labs 
to build apps free of the burden of integration with 
the main Facebook app. The idea is that single func-
tion apps can have a simpler interface, run faster, 
and be more intuitive. Creative Labs programmers 
report greater freedom to develop new products. 
Facebook’s track record with apps is mostly 
disappointing. Skeptical investors and critics point 
out that the most innovative and popular products 
coming out of Facebook are those that it recently 
purchased rather than any developed in-house. Face-
book has launched a number of ho-hum apps that 
few people use. Home was an Android feature that 
locked your smartphone screen to your Facebook. 
Few adopted it, as most found it redundant. Seeing 
the rapid growth of Instagram, the photo-based 
social network, Facebook developed a copycat 
app called Camera. Sensing another flop, it bought 
Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, hoping to 
appeal to younger users. Camera has since been 
discontinued while Instagram has grown from 40 
to over 400 million users; however, it does not yet 
generate any revenue. Paper, the first new app to 
emerge from Creative Labs, allows users to navigate 
the News Feed using touch gestures. It has yet to 
find significant support. 
On the other hand, in 2015, it appears the 
spinoff of Messenger has worked—it’s now the 
second most popular app in the United States, 
ahead of YouTube and behind only the flagship 
Facebook app. New features such as Businesses 
on Messenger and Facebook Video Messenger have 
broadened the appeal to different types of users, 
making it a much more compelling experience than 
the integrated app. By opening Messenger to users 
without Facebook accounts and third-party develop-
ers, Facebook has signaled that it wants Messenger 
to be a fully autonomous platform. Facebook has 

	
S o c i a l  N e t w o r k s  a n d  O n l i n e  C o m m u n i t i e s 	

693
been seeking a platform like this for several years. 
It may now have two. 
In 2012, Facebook was rebuffed when it tried 
to buy SnapChat, the self-deleting messaging app, 
for $3 billion. Snapchat is one of several mobile 
messaging services that have become wildly popular, 
with twice as many messages sent over the mobile 
Internet than via traditional texts, according to 
Deloitte Research. In December 2012, Facebook 
cloned Snapchat with an app called Poke. How-
ever, like Camera and Paper, Poke did not take off. 
Instead, in 2014 Facebook bought the world’s 
largest messaging service, WhatsApp, for a stunning 
$22 billion. Yes, that’s right: $22 billion, possibly 
the largest acquisition in dot-com history! With 
900 million users, and adding 1 million users a day, 
WhatsApp has become the fastest growing app in 
history. WhatsApp charges users $1 a year after 
their second year (the first year is free) to send text 
messages to cell phone numbers using the Internet 
rather than the more expensive mobile cell networks. 
For Facebook, the purchase solidifies its status 
as the unquestioned leader in Internet messaging 
and helps it to attract a younger demographic, 
while eliminating its largest competitor. Facebook 
has also incorporated many of WhatsApp’s most 
useful features into Messenger. Still, like Instagram, 
WhatsApp will function as an autonomous unit 
within Facebook. WhatsApp is lighter-weight and 
simpler than Messenger, works on a wider variety of 
devices, and is free to users in developing markets. 
Optimistic analysts argue that while the 
prices paid by Facebook for Instagram and 
WhatsApp cannot be justified by any current 
measures of revenue and earnings, they 
may be the foundation for a much larger 
social platform that could include retail and 
media sales, payment processing, and additional 
functionality that cannot yet be foreseen. Accord-
ing to Zuckerberg, advertising will be phased in 
gradually to both Messenger and WhatsApp just 
as it was on Facebook and in the Pages API so 
that neither the user experience nor app growth 
will be compromised.
The formation of Creative Labs and acquisi-
tions of Instagram and WhatsApp were designed to 
address looming, and possibly long-term, challenges. 
Facebook’s growth has flatlined in the United States 
and slowed markedly around the world. Engage-
ment is faltering, with an 8% drop in active usage 
in 2014. Facebook demographics are going in the 
wrong direction: young teens and 18–24-year-olds 
appear to be losing interest, spending more time on 
niche social networks. Creative Labs and the strat-
egy of developing stand-alone apps that are linked 
to Facebook, but not integrated into its mobile app, 
may be a solution. In 2014, Facebook also spun 
off its Groups functionality into a stand-alone app, 
and in 2015, Creative Labs released a host of new 
apps, including Mentions, an app for celebrities and 
other public figures with verified profiles or pages; 
Moments, which allows users to organize photos 
from events; and Riff, which allows users to create 
brief videos with friends in the hopes that they’ll 
go viral. However, recent experience suggests that 
if and when its in-house solutions falter,  Facebook 
will likely wield its considerable financial heft in 
the app marketplace.

moments (Miner, 2015). Facebook also made three changes to its News Feed algorithm 
in 2015 to capture more user attention: increasing content from users’ favorite friends; 
decreasing content from friends of users’ friends; and showing multiple posts in a row 
from the same source for users with few friends (Gaudin, 2015). 
 Table 10.2 illustrates the different levels of engagement with the top social 
networks. 
The amount of revenue generated is the ultimate metric for measuring a com-
pany’s business potential. The top three search engine companies (Google, Yahoo, and 
Microsoft) are expected to generate about €54.5 billion in search and display advertis-
ing revenue in 2015 (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b). In contrast, social networks are expected 
to generate about €23 billion in advertising revenue in 2015. Social networks are the 
fastest growing form of Internet usage and advertising revenue, but they are not yet as 
lucrative as traditional search engines/portals in terms of ad dollars generated. A part 
of the problem is that subscribers do not go to social networks to seek ads for relevant 
products, nor pay attention to the ads that are flashed before their eyes (see Chapters 
6 and 7). In addition, the small screen of the smartphone, the dominant social network 
platform, is not ideal for display advertising. 
TURNING SOCIAL NETWORKS INTO BUSINESSES
While the early social networks had a difficult time raising capital and revenues, today’s 
top social networks are now monetizing their huge audiences. Early social networks 
relied on subscriptions, but today, most social networks rely on advertising or the 
investments of venture capitalists. Users of portals and search engines have come to 
accept advertising as the preferred means of supporting Web experiences rather than 
paying for it. One important exception is LinkedIn, which offers basic free memberships 
for individuals but charges for premium services. Figure 10.2 shows the comparative 
amount of ad spending on various social networks. Facebook, with almost €15 billion 
in ad revenue, towers over the other sites.

Social networks do not always succeed as businesses. For instance, Twitter began 
as a social messaging service on which users could communicate with followers. It 
quickly turned into an Internet broadcasting network for millions of on-scene observers 
acting as citizen reporters, political organizers, celebrities, and politicians. In 2015, it 
has just over 300 million users, growing at 20% annually. But Twitter’s meteoric growth 
has slowed from its earlier years, and in 2014, it lost $577 million, disappointing inves-
tors who expect more advertising dollars and real revenue. Twitter has never shown a 
profit. In 2015, Twitter is turning its home page into a portal for streaming news and 
essays, organized by content area, curated topics, and perhaps authored essays. It is 
trying to make Twitter more accessible to non-subscribers by offering free content, 
but, as before, to re-tweet or reply to a tweet, a subscription is necessary (Miner, 2015). 
Executives are hoping these changes will attract more subscribers, more tweets, more 
ads, and hence more revenue. 
The rapid adoption of mobile devices initially posed a challenge to social networks 
like Facebook, as well as Google’s search engine, because they were largely based on 
the desktop platform. Google dominated mobile ad revenues up until 2013 because its 
search engine and Google Maps were among the most popular apps. Facebook quickly 
developed its own mobile app, and purchased others, and within the space of four years 
has been able to capture a significant part of the mobile ad market, using its mobile 
News Feed to provide users a continual stream of ads. The top six apps, and eight of 
the top nine, are owned by either Google or Facebook. For Facebook, that includes the 
main Facebook app, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Today, over 75% of 
Facebook’s revenue ($2.2 billion) comes from mobile advertising. For Google, 20% of its 
ad revenue comes from mobile, a whopping $12 billion in mobile ads. Together, Facebook 
and Google command about one-half of the global mobile ad market (Seetharaman, 2015).

Social networks have had an important impact on how businesses operate, com-
municate, and serve their customers. A 2015 survey of Fortune 500 firms found that 
93% used LinkedIn, 78% used Twitter, and 74% used Facebook (Barnes et al., 2015). 
The most visible business firm use of social networks is as a marketing and branding 
tool. A less visible marketing use of networks is as a powerful listening tool that has 
strengthened the role of customers and customer feedback systems inside a business. 
Public social networks like Facebook have not been used extensively in firms as col-
laboration tools thus far. However, in 2015, Facebook began rolling out its Facebook 
at Work app, designed to spur collaboration and networking inside large firms. The 
new app faces stiff competition from a wide array of collaboration tools provided by 
Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, and along with other technologies like instant messaging and 
teleconferencing (Gaudin, 2015).
Social networks are where corporate brands and reputations are formed, and 
firms today take very seriously the topic of “online reputation,” as evidenced by social 
network posts, commentary, chat sessions, and Likes. In this sense, social networks 
become an extension of corporate customer relationship management systems and 
extend existing market research programs. Beyond branding, social networks are being 
used increasingly as advertising platforms to contact a younger audience than Web 
sites and e-mail, and as customers increasingly shift their eyeballs to social networks. 
Rosetta Stone, for instance, uses its Facebook page to display videos of its learning 
technology, encourage discussions and reviews, and post changes in its learning 
tools. Yet the business use of social networks does not always go well. The Insight on 
Society case, The Dark Side of Social Networks, discusses some of the risks associated 
with social networks.
TYPES OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THEIR BUSINESS MODELS
There are many types and many ways of classifying social networks and online com-
munities. While the most popular general social networks have adopted an advertising 
model, other kinds of networks have different revenue sources. Social networks have 
different types of sponsors and different kinds of members. For instance, some are 
created by firms such as IBM for the exclusive use of their sales force or other employ-
ees (intra-firm communities or B2E [business-to-employee] communities); others are 
built for suppliers and resellers (inter-organizational or B2B communities); and others 
are built by dedicated individuals for other similar persons with shared interests (P2P 
[people-to-people] communities). In this chapter, we will discuss B2C communities for 
the most part, although we also discuss briefly P2P communities of practice.
Table 10.3 on page 724 describes in greater detail the five generic types of social 
networks and online communities: general, practice, interest, affinity, and sponsored. 
Each type of community can have a commercial intent or commercial consequence. 
We use this schema to explore the business models of commercial communities.
General communities offer members opportunities to interact with a general 
audience organized into general topics. Within the topics, members can find hundreds 
of specific discussion groups attended by thousands of like-minded members who 
share an interest in that topic. The purpose of the general community is to attract 
enough members to populate a wide range of topics and discussion groups. The busi-
general communities 
offer members opportunities 
to interact with a general 
audience organized into 
general topics

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE DARK SIDE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS 
ChapStick thought it had a great 
marketing idea when it decided to 
launch a new Facebook ad—a mildly 
provocative picture of a young woman 
on her disheveled sofa—derriere in the 
air—rummaging behind the couch. The ad pro-
claimed: WHERE DO LOST CHAPSTICKS GO? 
The subtitle invited user comment on Facebook’s 
page. ChapStick was completely unprepared for 
what came next. Little did ChapStick realize that 
it was about to endure a social network advertis-
ing fiasco.
First, a blogger cited the ad in a post about 
the pervasiveness of sexist advertising. When she 
posted to ChapStick’s Facebook page, her com-
ment was deleted. Other Facebook posters followed 
suit. Their comments were also deleted. It wasn’t 
long before a stream of comments mocking the 
“Be Heard” subtitle ensued.
ChapStick had an opportunity to begin a 
conversation with its customers that would have 
demonstrated its cognizance of and sensitivity 
to sexist advertising. Rather than a public rela-
tions nightmare, it could have created a public 
relations coup, stamping itself as a company that 
cares about its most loyal fans. Instead, ChapStick 
remained silent and deleted dissenting posts. On 
traditional media platforms that might have been 
sufficient, but social networks are interactive, and 
campaigns don’t always go as planned.
Finally, when it could no longer delete the 
negative posts quickly enough, ChapStick pulled 
the ad and responded. However, ChapStick never 
owned up to the mass deletions it had perpetrated 
in its anemic response, instead offering regret 
if fans “felt” this had happened and essentially 
blaming posters for being uncivil or posting “men-
acing” comments.
When ChapStick finally tried to assure its 
fans that it valued them and was listening, it was 
hardly credible. In short, ChapStick presented us 
with a textbook case in how not to conduct social 
network advertising!
Attempts to control social media response on 
Twitter can be equally misguided. MasterCard’s 
PR firm, House PR, was in charge of organizing a 
social media campaign to promote the 2014 Brit 
Awards event for British music. House demanded 
that journalists agree to very specific terms to 
obtain accreditation for the event, including guar-
antees from the journalists to use both official 
and personal accounts to live tweet the awards, 
to provide links to specific videos determined by 
House, and to use the #PricelessSurprises hashtag 
in these tweets. Journalists chafed at the attempts 
to micromanage their social media participation, 
with many tweeting their outrage at the terms. 
Forcing social media participants to respond in 
a predetermined way might work sometimes, but 
when it doesn’t, as it didn’t for MasterCard, it 
can be embarrassing and damaging to the com-
pany’s brand.
Fast food giant McDonald’s also confronted 
the dark side of social networks when it began a 
public relations campaign on Twitter. Using the 
hashtag #meetthefarmers, it inserted promotional 
tweets into the streams of Twitter users and paid 
for premium search engine results. The Supplier 
Stories campaign encouraged users to share 
stories about the farmers who sold their meat 
and produce to McDonald’s. All was proceeding 
nicely until McDonald’s replaced the hashtag with 
#McDStories. Now encouraging users to share 
their general consumer stories, McDonald’s almost 
immediately lost control of its advertising cam-
paign. The Twittersphere exploded with tweets

comparing McDonald’s fare to dog food, 
sprinkled with barbs about Type II diabetes, 
obesity, and food poisoning. The best that can 
be said for McDonald’s is that it was prepared to 
pull the plug on the campaign should anything go 
awry. Within two hours, the promotion was halted. 
In 2014, McDonald’s continued to struggle with 
social media, misspelling words in an Instagram 
advertising campaign and aggravating users with 
excessive advertising, as well as struggling with 
negative feedback to its #RonaldMcDonald mascot 
relaunch and accompanying hashtag.
The ChapStick, MasterCard, and McDonald’s 
fiascos are instructive. ChapStick had no policies 
in place for how to respond to an ad campaign 
gone wrong. MasterCard attempted to exert cor-
porate control over a medium that users value for 
its ability to provide honest, unfiltered individual 
feedback. McDonald’s failed to fully recognize the 
polarizing nature of its product, making soliciting 
general comments a risky proposition. Compa-
nies with controversial products need to tread 
carefully, and companies need to be prepared to 
handle negative comments appropriately and take 
responsibility for mistakes.
Not all companies are learning from the 
experience of other firms. In 2014, homemade 
pizza maker DiGiorno’s blundered when it used 
a hashtag meant to bring awareness to domes-
tic violence, #WhyIStayed, in a tweet promoting 
its pizza. Outrage came swiftly and DiGiorno’s 
took the tweet down amid a storm of criticism. 
The New England Patriots football team ran a 
campaign that automatically retweeted users’ 
Twitter account names superimposed on team 
jerseys when users tweeted the #1MillionPatriots 
hashtag. Users seized the opportunity to wreak 
havoc, creating offensive Twitter handles that 
embarrassed the Patriots. And US Airways inad-
vertently tweeted a graphic pornographic image 
in response to a customer service complaint. Per-
haps most surprisingly of all, Twitter’s own chief 
financial officer accidentally publicly tweeted a 
message about an acquisition the company was 
still considering.
But in 2014, KFC set a good example when 
the news broke that a 3-year-old girl from Missis-
sippi who had been mauled by her grandfather’s 
dogs had subsequently been asked to leave a local 
KFC because she reportedly was scaring the other 
patrons. The visit to the restaurant had been a 
special treat for the girl from her family after a 
doctor’s visit. When the news hit social media, 
KFC was caught in a firestorm of enraged cus-
tomers. The company took the next several days 
to respond to as many individual comments as 
it could, posted a personal apology to the girl’s 
Facebook page, and pledged $30,000 toward her 
medical bills. 
Marketing is not the only social media hazard. 
For employees, privacy protection for Facebook 
posts is still being determined in the courts. For 
example, Danielle Mailhoit was the manager of a 
Home Depot store in Burbank, California. After 
she was fired, she filed suit claiming gender and 
disability discrimination due to her vertigo. The 
defense attorney filed a broad request for all of 
Mailhoit’s social media activity. In September 
2012, a federal judge ruled this request overly 
broad and limited discovery to only communica-
tions between the plaintiff and current or former 
Home Depot employees. Stating that they were 
unlikely to be relevant unless they were directly 
related to the lawsuit or her former employment, 
she also denied Home Depot’s request for photos.
Employers must be careful with personal infor-
mation gleaned from social networks. If it can be 
proven that membership in a protected group was 
discovered during the hiring process and used to 
reject a candidate or later used to terminate an 
employee, a claim can be filed under one of the 
Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
laws. These include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967 (ADEA), Title I and Title V of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and

Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimina-
tion Act of 2008 (GINA), which prohibits employ-
ment discrimination based on genetic information 
about an applicant, employee, or former employee. 
GINA’s regulations provide a distinction between 
whether genetic information is acquired purposefully 
or inadvertently. Inadvertent acquisition includes 
acquisition through social networks, equating it to 
accidentally overhearing a conversation at work.
However, data on a social media site protected 
by privacy controls should not be able to be “inad-
vertently” acquired. The Stored Communications 
Act (SCA) covers privacy protection for e-mail and 
digital communications. The latest court rulings on 
its application to social network communications 
have held that Facebook wall postings and other 
social media comments are protected as long as 
they have not been made public.
Facebook, to protect its business model, is 
speaking out against recent hiring practices that 
have come to its attention—and threatening legal 
action. According to both Facebook and the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), some compa-
nies have been asking new hires either to friend 
the hiring manager or to submit their password. 
Facebook’s Privacy Page condemns this practice, 
stating that it violates both individual users’ and 
their friends’ expectations of privacy, jeopardizes 
security, and could reveal a user’s membership in 
a protected group. 
Legislators in a growing number of 
states have decided to be proactive. In 2012, 
California banned employers from asking pro-
spective employees for their social media user 
names and passwords. In 2013, New Jersey became 
the 12th state to restrict employer access to 
employee social media accounts, although New 
Jersey–based employers are still granted some 
rights in the cases of companies dealing with public 
safety and workplace investigations. In 2014, 
Rhode Island passed its own legislation making 
it illegal for an employer or school to demand 
login information for social media accounts for 
prospective employees or students, and other states 
are expected to follow suit, including Louisiana, 
Wisconsin, and Virginia, which passed its version 
of the law in 2015.
Carefully crafted policies can help compa-
nies to avoid the dark side of social networking. 
Advertising and hiring are but two of the areas 
that must be monitored. The Human Resources 
department must also develop policies regarding 
employee use of social networks. Employee educa-
tion programs must be implemented to apprise 
employees of infractions that can be grounds for 
disciplinary action. IT departments must develop 
stringent policies to protect proprietary data and 
defend company networks from cyberscams. Social 
networking is an exciting new tool, but one that 
requires safeguards.

ness model of general communities is typically advertising supported by selling ad 
space on pages and videos. 
Practice networks offer members focused discussion groups, help, information, 
and knowledge relating to an area of shared practice. For instance, Linux.org is a non-
profit community for the open source movement, a worldwide global effort involving 
thousands of programmers who develop computer code for the Linux operating system 
and share the results freely with all. Other online communities involve artists, educa-
tors, art dealers, photographers, and nurses. Practice networks can be either profit-based 
or nonprofit, and support themselves by advertising or user donations. 
Interest-based social networks offer members focused discussion groups based 
on a shared interest in some specific subject, such as business careers, boats, horses, 
health, skiing, and thousands of other topics. Because the audience for interest com-
munities is necessarily much smaller and more targeted, these communities have 
usually relied on advertising and tenancy/sponsorship deals. Social networks such as 
Fool.com, Military.com, Sailing Anarchy, and Chronicle Forums all are examples of 
social networks that attract people who share a common pursuit. Job markets and 
forums such as LinkedIn can be considered interest-based social networks as well.
Affinity communities offer members focused discussions and interaction with 
other people who share the same affinity. “Affinity” refers to self- and group identifica-
tion. For instance, people can self-identify themselves on the basis of religion, ethnic-
ity, gender, sexual orientation, political beliefs, geographical location, and hundreds 
of other categories. For instance, Oxygen and NaturallyCurly are affinity communities

sales of products.
Sponsored communities are online communities created by government, non-
profit, or for-profit organizations for the purpose of pursuing organizational goals. 
These goals can be diverse, from increasing the information available to citizens; for 
instance, a local county government site such as Westchestergov.com, the Web site for 
Westchester County (New York) government; to an online auction site such as eBay; 
to a product site such as Tide.com, which is sponsored by an offline branded product 
company (Procter & Gamble). Cisco, IBM, HP, and hundreds of other companies have 
developed their internal corporate social networks as a way of sharing knowledge. 
SOCIAL NETWORK FEATURES AND TECHNOLOGIES
Social networks have developed software applications that allow users to engage in 
a number of activities. Not all social networks have the same features, but there is 
an emerging feature set among the larger communities. Some of these software tools 
are built into the site, while others can be added by users to their profile pages as 
widgets (described in earlier chapters). Table 10.4 describes several social network

	10.2	 ONLINE AUCTIONS
Auctions are used throughout the e-commerce landscape. The most widely known 
auctions are consumer-to-consumer (C2C) auctions, in which the auction house 
is simply an intermediary market maker, providing a forum where consumers—buyers 
and sellers—can discover prices and trade. The market leader in C2C auctions is eBay, 
which, as of June 2015, had around 157 million active users and over 550 million items 
listed on any given day within thousands of different categories. In 2014, eBay had 
about $7 billion in net revenues from its Marketplaces segment, a 6% increase from 
2013, and the total worth of goods sold or auctioned was around $83 billion (Gross 
Merchandise Value) (eBay, 2015). eBay is expanding rapidly in emerging markets, and 
predicts that about 25% of its users will be in developing countries by the end of 2015. 
eBay is further discussed in the case study at the end of this chapter. There are hun-
dreds of auction sites, some specializing in unique collectible products such as stamps 
and coins, others adopting a more generalist approach in which almost any good can 
be found for sale.
Less well known are business-to-consumer (B2C) auctions, where a business 
owns or controls assets and uses dynamic pricing to establish the price. Increasingly, 
online retail sites, such as Sam’s Club, are adding auctions to their sites. Auctions also 
constitute a significant part of B2B e-commerce in 2015, and more than a third of 
procurement officers use auctions to procure goods. 
Some leading online auction sites are listed in Table 10.5. Auctions are not limited 
to goods and services. They can also be used to allocate resources, and bundles of 
resources, among any group of bidders. For instance, if you wanted to establish an optimal 
schedule for assigned tasks in an office among a group of clerical workers, an auction 
in which workers bid for assignments would come close to producing a nearly optimal 
solution in a short amount of time (Parkes and Ungar, 2000). In short, auctions—like 
all markets—are ways of allocating resources among independent agents (bidders).
BENEFITS AND COSTS OF AUCTIONS
The Internet is primarily responsible for the resurgence in auctions. The Internet pro-
vides a global environment and very low fixed and operational costs for the aggregation 
of huge buyer audiences, composed of millions of consumers worldwide, who can use 
a universally available technology (Internet browsers) to shop for goods.
Benefits of Auctions
Aside from the sheer game-like fun of participating in auctions, consumers, merchants, 
and society as a whole derive a number of economic benefits from participating in 
Internet auctions. These benefits include:
•	 Liquidity: Sellers can find willing buyers, and buyers can find sellers. Sellers and 
buyers can be located anywhere around the globe. Just as important, buyers and 
sellers can find a global market for rare items that would not have existed before 
the Internet.

•	 Price discovery: Buyers and sellers can quickly and efficiently develop prices for 
items that are difficult to assess, where the price depends on demand and supply, 
and where the product is rare. 
•	 Price transparency: Public Internet auctions allow everyone in the world to see 
the asking and bidding prices for items. 
•	 Market efficiency: Auctions can, and often do, lead to reduced prices, and hence 
reduced profits for merchants, leading to an increase in consumer welfare—one 
measure of market efficiency. 
•	 Lower transaction costs: Online auctions can lower the cost of selling and pur-
chasing products, benefiting both merchants and consumers. Like other Internet 
markets, such as retail markets, Internet auctions have very low (but not zero) 
transaction costs. 
•	 Consumer aggregation: Sellers benefit from large auction sites’ ability to aggre-
gate a large number of consumers who are motivated to purchase something in 
one marketspace. 
•	 Network effects: The larger an auction site becomes in terms of visitors and products 
for sale, the more valuable it becomes as a marketplace for everyone by providing

liquidity and several other benefits listed previously, such as lower transaction 
costs, higher efficiency, and better price transparency. 
Risks and Costs of Auctions
There are a number of risks and costs involved in participating in auctions. In some cases, 
auction markets can fail—like all markets at times. (We describe auction market failure 
in more detail later.) Some of the more important risks and costs to keep in mind are:
•	 Delayed consumption costs: Internet auctions can go on for days, and shipping 
will take additional time. 
•	 Monitoring costs: Participation in auctions requires your time to monitor bidding.
•	 Equipment costs: Internet auctions require you to purchase a computer system 
and pay for Internet access.
•	 Trust risks: Online auctions are a significant source of Internet fraud. Using auc-
tions increases the risk of experiencing a loss.
•	 Fulfillment costs: Typically, the buyer pays fulfillment costs of packing, shipping, 
and insurance, whereas at a physical store these costs are included in the retail price.
Auction sites such as eBay have taken a number of steps to reduce consumer 
participation costs and trust risk. For instance, auction sites attempt to solve the trust 
problem by providing a rating system in which previous customers rate sellers based 
on their overall experience with the merchant. Although helpful, this solution does not 
always work. Auction fraud is a leading source of e-commerce complaints to federal law 
enforcement officials. Another partial solution to high monitoring costs is, ironically, fixed 
pricing. At eBay, consumers can reduce the cost of monitoring and waiting for auctions 
to end by simply clicking on the Buy It Now! button and paying a premium price. The 
difference between the Buy It Now price and the auction price is the cost of monitoring. 
Nevertheless, given the costs of participating in online auctions, the generally 
lower cost of goods on Internet auctions is in part a compensation for the other addi-
tional costs consumers experience. On the other hand, consumers experience lower 
search costs and transaction costs because there usually are no intermediaries (unless, 
of course, the seller is an online business operating on an auction site, in which case 
there is a middleman cost), and usually there are no local or state taxes.
Merchants face considerable risks and costs as well. At auctions, merchants 
may end up selling goods for prices far below what they might have achieved in 
conventional markets. Merchants also face risks of nonpayment, false bidding, bid 
rigging, monitoring, transaction fees charged by the auction site, credit card trans-
action processing fees, and the administration costs of entering price and product 
information. 
AUCTIONS AS AN E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODEL
Online auctions have been among the most successful business models in retail and B2B 
commerce. eBay, the Internet’s most lucrative auction site, has been profitable nearly 
since its inception. The strategy for eBay has been to make money off every stage in 
the auction cycle. eBay earns revenue from auctions in several ways: transaction fees 
based on the amount of the sale, listing fees for display of goods, financial service fees 

	
O n l i n e  A u c t i o n s

from payment systems such as PayPal, and advertising or placement fees where sellers 
pay extra for special services such as particular display or listing services. PayPal has 
been faster growing and more profitable than eBay’s markets, growing to more than 
half of eBay’s revenue. In 2015 eBay spun off PayPal into a separate company, and 
going forward will have to make its profits from its markets operation. 
However, it is on the cost side that online auctions have extraordinary advan-
tages over ordinary retail or catalog sites. Auction sites carry no inventory and do not 
perform any fulfillment activities—they need no warehouses, shipping, or logistical 
facilities. Sellers and consumers provide these services and bear these costs. In this 
sense, online auctions are an ideal digital business because they involve simply the 
transfer of information.
Even though eBay has been extraordinarily successful, the success of online 
auctions is qualified by the fact that the marketplace for online auctions is highly 
concentrated. eBay dominates the online auction market, followed by eBid and uBid. 
In the last several years eBay’s growth has slowed considerably as consumers shift 
toward Buy It Now purchases rather than auctions. Many of the smaller auction sites 
are not profitable because they lack sufficient sellers and buyers to achieve liquidity. 
In auctions, network effects are highly influential, and the tendency is for one or two 
very large auction sites to dominate, with hundreds of smaller specialty auction sites 
(sites that sell specialized goods such as stamps) being barely profitable.
TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF AUCTIONS
The primary types of auctions found on the Internet are English auctions, Dutch 
Internet auctions, Name Your Own Price auctions, and so-called penny auctions. 
The English auction is the easiest to understand and the most common form of 
auction on eBay. Typically, there is a single item up for sale from a single seller. There 
is a time limit when the auction ends, a reserve price below which the seller will not 
sell (usually secret), and a minimum incremental bid set. Multiple buyers bid against 
one another until the auction time limit is reached. The highest bidder wins the item 
(if the reserve price of the seller has been met or exceeded). English auctions are 
considered to be seller-biased because multiple buyers compete against one another—
usually anonymously.
The Dutch Internet auction format is perfect for sellers that have many identical 
items to sell. Sellers start by listing a minimum price, or a starting bid for one item, and 
the number of items for sale. Bidders specify both a bid price and the quantity they want 
to buy. The uniform price reigns. Winning bidders pay the same price per item, which 
is the lowest successful bid. This market clearing price can be less than some bids. If 
there are more buyers than items, the earliest successful bids get the goods. In general, 
high bidders get the quantity they want at the lowest successful price, whereas low suc-
cessful bidders might not get the quantity they want (but they will get something). 
The Name Your Own Price auction was pioneered by Priceline, and is the 
second most-popular auction format on the Web. Although Priceline also acts as an 
intermediary, buying blocks of airline tickets, hotel rooms, and vacation packages at 
a discount and selling them at a reduced retail price or matching its inventory to 
bidders, it is best known for its Name Your Own Price auctions, in which users specify

what they are willing to pay for goods or services, and multiple providers bid for their 
business. Prices do not descend and are fixed: the initial consumer offer is a commit-
ment to purchase at that price. In 2014, Priceline had more than $8.4 billion in revenues, 
and in 2015, it attracts around 31 million unique visitors a month. It is one of the top-
ranked travel sites in the United States. 
But how can Priceline offer such steep discounts off prices for services provided by 
major brand-name providers? There are several answers. First, Priceline “shields the 
brand” by not publicizing the prices at which major brands sell. This reduces conflict 
with traditional channels, including direct sales. Second, the services being sold are 
perishable: if a Priceline customer did not pay something for the empty airline seat, 
rental car, or hotel room, sellers would not receive any revenue. Hence, sellers are 
highly motivated to at least cover the costs of their services by selling in a spot market 
at very low prices. The strategy for sellers is to sell as much as possible through more 
profitable channels and then unload excess capacity on spot markets such as Price-
line. This works to the advantage of consumers, sellers, and Priceline, which charges 
a transaction fee to sellers.
So-called penny auctions are really anything but. To participate in a penny auction 
(also known as a bidding fee auction), you typically must pay the penny auction 
site for bids ahead of time, typically 50 cents to $1 dollar, usually in packs costing $25-
$50. Once you have purchased the bids, you can use them to bid on items listed by 
the penny auction site (unlike traditional auctions, items are owned by the site, not 
third parties). Items typically start at or near $0 and each bid raises the price by a fixed 
amount, usually just a penny. Auctions are timed, and when the time runs out, the 
last and highest bidder wins the item. Although the price of the item itself may not 
be that high, the successful bidder will typically have spent much more than that. 
Unlike a traditional auction, it costs money to bid and that money is gone even if the 
bidder does not win the auction. The bidder’s cumulative cost of bidding must be added 
to the final price of a successful bid to determine the true cost of the item. The Federal 
Trade Commission has issued an alert about penny auctions, warning that bidders 
may find that they spend far more than they intended (Consumer Reports.org, 2013). 
Examples of penny auction sites include QuiBids, Beezid, and HappyBidDay.
WHEN TO USE AUCTIONS (AND FOR WHAT) IN BUSINESS
There are many different situations in which auctions are an appropriate channel for 
businesses to consider. For much of this chapter, we have looked at auctions from a 
consumer point of view. The objective of consumers is to receive the greatest value 
for the lowest cost. Now, switch your perspective to that of a business. Remember that 
the objective of businesses using auctions is to maximize their revenue (their share of 
consumer surplus) by finding the true market value of products and services, a market 
value that hopefully is higher in the auction channel than in fixed-price channels. 
Table 10.6 provides an overview of factors to consider.
The factors are described as follows:
•	 Type of product: Online auctions are most commonly used for rare and unique 
products for which prices are difficult to discover, and there may have been no 
market for the goods. However, Priceline has succeeded in developing auctions for 
penny (bidding fee)

perishable commodities (such as airline seats) for which retail prices have already 
been established, and some B2B auctions involve commodities such as steel (often 
sold at distress prices). New clothing items, new digital cameras, and new computers 
are generally not sold at auction because their prices are easy to discover, catalog 
prices are high, sustainable, and profitable, they are not perishable, and there exists 
an efficient market channel in the form of retail stores (online and offline).
•	 Product life cycle: For the most part, businesses have traditionally used auctions 
for goods at the end of their product life cycle and for products where auctions yield 
a higher price than fixed-price liquidation sales. However, products at the beginning 
of their life cycle are increasingly being sold at auction. Early releases of music, 
books, videos, games, and digital appliances can be sold to highly motivated early 
adopters who want to be the first in their neighborhood with new products. Online 
sales of event tickets from music concerts to sports events now account for upwards 
of 25% of all event ticket sales in the United States.
•	 Channel management: Established retailers such as JCPenney and Walmart, and 
manufacturers in general, must be careful not to allow their auction activity to 
interfere with their existing profitable channels. For this reason, items found on 
established retail-site auctions tend to be late in their product life cycle or have 
quantity purchase requirements.
•	 Type of auction: Sellers obviously should choose auctions where there are many 
buyers and only a few, or even one, seller. English ascending-price auctions such 
as those at eBay are best for sellers because as the number of bidders increases, 
the price tends to move higher.
•	 Initial pricing: Research suggests that auction items should start out with low initial 
bid prices in order to encourage more bidders to bid (see “Bid increments” below). 
The lower the price, the larger the number of bidders will appear. The larger the 
number of bidders, the higher the prices move.

•	 Bid increments: It is generally safest to keep bid increments low so as to increase 
the number of bidders and the frequency of their bids. If bidders can be convinced 
that, for just a few more dollars, they can win the auction, then they will tend to 
make the higher bid and forget about the total amount they are bidding.
•	 Auction length: In general, the longer auctions are scheduled, the larger the 
number of bidders and the higher the prices can go. However, once the new bid 
arrival rate drops off and approaches zero, bid prices stabilize. Most eBay auctions 
are scheduled for seven days.
•	 Number of items: When a business has a number of items to sell, buyers usually 
expect a “volume discount,” and this expectation can cause lower bids in return. 
Therefore, sellers should consider breaking up very large bundles into smaller 
bundles auctioned at different times.
•	 Price allocation rule: Most buyers believe it is “fair” that everyone pay the same 
price in a multi-unit auction, and a uniform pricing rule is recommended. eBay 
Dutch Internet auctions encourage this expectation. The idea that some buyers 
should pay more based on their differential need for the product is not widely sup-
ported. Therefore, sellers who want to price discriminate should do so by holding 
auctions for the same goods on different auction markets, or at different times, to 
prevent direct price comparison.
•	 Closed vs. open bidding: Closed bidding has many advantages for the seller, and 
sellers should use this approach whenever possible because it permits price dis-
crimination without offending buyers. However, open bidding carries the advantage 
of “herd effects” and “winning effects” (described later in the chapter) in which 
consumers’ competitive instincts to “win” drive prices higher than even secret 
bidding would achieve.
AUCTION PRICES: ARE THEY THE LOWEST?
It is widely assumed that auction prices are lower than prices in other fixed-price 
markets. Empirical evidence is mixed on this assumption. There are many reasons 
why auction prices might be higher than those in fixed-price markets for items of 
identical quality, and why auction prices in one auction market may be higher than 
those in other auction markets. Consumers are not driven solely by value maximiza-
tion but instead are influenced by many situational factors, irrelevant and wrong 
information, and misperceptions when they make market decisions (Simonson and 
Tversky, 1992). Auctions are social events—shared social environments, in which 
bidders adjust to one another (Hanson and Putler, 1996). Briefly, bidders base their 
bids on what others have previously bid, and this can lead to an upward cascading 
effect (Arkes and Hutzel, 2000). In a study of hundreds of eBay auctions for Sony 
PlayStations, CD players, Mexican pottery, and Italian silk ties, Dholakia and Soltysin-
ski (2001) found that bidders exhibited herd behavior (the tendency to gravitate 
toward, and bid for, auction listings with one or more existing bids) by making mul-
tiple bids on some auctions (coveted comparables), and making no bids at auctions 
for comparable items (overlooked comparables). Herd behavior resulted in consumers

listings with one or more 
existing bids

paying higher prices than necessary for reasons having no foundation in economic 
reality (Liu and Sutanto, 2012).
The behavioral reality of participating in auctions can produce many unintended 
results. Winners can suffer winner’s regret, the feeling after winning an auction that 
they paid too much for an item, which indicates that their winning bid does not reflect 
what they thought the item was worth but rather what the second bidder thought the 
item was worth. Sellers can experience seller’s lament, reflecting the fact that they 
sold an item at a price just above the second place bidder, never knowing how much 
the ultimate winner might have paid or the true value to the final winner. Auction 
losers can experience loser’s lament, the feeling of having been too cheap in bidding 
and failing to win. In summary, auctions can lead to both winners paying too much 
and sellers receiving too little. Both of these outcomes can be minimized when sellers 
and buyers have a very clear understanding of the prices for items in a variety of dif-
ferent online and offline markets.
CONSUMER TRUST IN AUCTIONS
Auction sites have the same difficulties creating a sense of consumer trust as all other 
e-commerce Web sites, although in the case of auction sites, the operators of the mar-
ketplace do not directly control the quality of goods being offered and cannot directly 
vouch for the integrity of the buyers or the sellers. This opens the possibility for criminal 
or unreliable actors to appear as either sellers or buyers. Several studies have found 
that trust and credibility increase as users gain more experience, if trusted third-party 
seals are present, and if the site has a wide variety of consumer services for tracking 
purchases (or fraud), thus giving the user a sense of control (Krishnamurthy, 2001; 
Stanford-Makovsky, 2002; Nikander and Karvonen, 2002; Bailey et al., 2002; Kollock, 
1999). Because of the powerful role that trust plays in online consumer behavior, eBay 
and most auction sites make considerable efforts to develop automated trust-enhancing 
mechanisms such as seller and buyer ratings, escrow services, buyer and seller insurance, 
guaranteed money back features, and authenticity guarantees (see the next section).
WHEN AUCTION MARKETS FAIL: FRAUD AND ABUSE IN AUCTIONS
Online and offline auction markets can be prone to fraud, which produces informa-
tion asymmetries between sellers and buyers and among buyers, which in turn causes 
auction markets to fail. Some of the possible abuses and frauds include:
•	 Bid rigging: Agreeing offline to limit bids or using shills to submit false bids that 
drive prices up.
•	 Price matching: Agreeing informally or formally to set floor prices on auction 
items below which sellers will not sell in open markets.
•	 Shill feedback, defensive: Using secondary IDs or other auction members to 
inflate seller ratings.
•	 Shill feedback, offensive: Using secondary IDs or other auction members to 
deflate ratings for another user (feedback bombs).
•	 Feedback extortion: Threatening negative feedback in return for a benefit.

•	 Transaction interference: E-mailing buyers to warn them away from a seller.
•	 Bid manipulation: Using the retraction option to make high bids, discovering the 
maximum bid of the current high bidder, and then retracting the bid.
•	 Non-payment after winning: Blocking legitimate buyers by bidding high, then 
not paying.
•	 Shill bidding: Using secondary user IDs or other auction members to artificially 
raise the price of an item.
•	 Transaction non-performance: Accepting payment and failing to deliver.
•	 Non-selling seller: Refusing payment or failing to deliver after a successful auction.
•	 Bid siphoning: E-mailing another seller’s bidders and offering the same product 
for less.
Auction sites have sought to reduce these risks through various methods including:
•	 Rating systems: Previous customers rate sellers based on their experience with 
them and post them on the site for other buyers to see.
•	 Watch lists: These allow buyers to monitor specific auctions as they proceed over 
a number of days and only pay close attention in the last few minutes of bidding.
•	 Proxy bidding: Buyers can enter a maximum price they are willing to pay, and 
the auction software will automatically place incremental bids as their original bid 
is surpassed.
eBay and many other auction sites have investigation units that receive complaints 
from consumers and investigate reported abuses. Nevertheless, with millions of visitors 
per week and hundreds of thousands of auctions to monitor, eBay is highly dependent 
on the good faith of sellers and consumers to follow the rules.
	10.3	 E-COMMERCE PORTALS 
Port: From the Latin porta, an entrance or gateway to a locality.
Portals are among the most frequently visited sites on the Web if only because 
they often are the first page to which many users point their browser on startup. The 
top portals such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL have hundreds of millions of unique visitors 
worldwide each month. Web portal sites are gateways to the billions of Web pages avail-
able on the Internet. Millions of users have set Facebook as their home page, choosing 
to start their sessions with news from their friends, and many stay on Facebook for 
several hours a day. We have already discussed Facebook in Section 10.1. Perhaps the 
most important service provided by portals is to help people find the information they 
are looking for on the Web and, like newspapers, to expose people to information they 
were not looking for but which they nonetheless find entertaining or interesting. The 
original portals in the early days of e-commerce were search engines. Consumers would 
pass through search engine portals on their way to rich, detailed, in-depth content on 
the Web. But portals evolved into much more complex Web sites that provide news, 
entertainment, maps, images, social networks, in-depth information, and education 

	
E - c o m m e r c e  P o r t a l s  	 
711
on a growing variety of topics all contained at the portal site. Portals today seek to be 
a sticky destination site, not merely a gateway through which visitors pass. In this 
respect, Web portals are very much like television networks: destination sites for 
content supported by advertising revenues. Portals today want visitors to stay a long 
time—the longer the better to expose visitors to ads. For the most part they succeed: 
portals are places where people linger for a long time. 
Portals also serve important functions within a business or organization. Most 
corporations, universities, churches, and other formal organizations have enterprise 
portals that help employees or members navigate to important content, such as human 
resources information, corporate news, or organizational announcements. For instance, 
your university has a portal through which you can register for courses, find classroom 
assignments, and perform a host of other important student activities. Increasingly, 
these enterprise portals also provide general-purpose news and real-time financial 
feeds provided by content providers outside the organization. Corporate portals and 
intranets are the subject of other textbooks focused on the corporate uses of Web 
technology and are beyond the scope of this book (see Laudon and Laudon, 2012). Our 
focus here is on e-commerce portals.
THE GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF PORTALS
Web portals have changed a great deal from their initial function and role. As noted 
above, most of today’s well-known portals, such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL, began as 
search engines. The initial function provided by portals was to index Web page content 
and make this content available to users in a convenient form. Early portals expected 
visitors to stay only a few minutes at the site. As millions of people signed on to the 
Internet in the early 2000s, the number of visitors to basic search engine sites exploded 
commensurately. At first, few people understood how a Web search site could make 
money by passing customers on to other destinations. But search sites attracted huge 
audiences, and therein lay the foundation for their success as vehicles for marketing 
and advertising. Search sites, recognizing the potential for commerce, expanded their 
offerings from simple navigation to include commerce (the sale of items directly 
from the Web site as well as advertising for other retail sites), content (in the form of 
news at first, and later in the form of weather, investments, games, health, and other 
subject matter), and distribution of others’ content. These three characteristics have 
become the basic definition of portal sites, namely, sites that provide three functions: 
navigation of the Web (search), commerce, and content. 
Because the value of portals to advertisers and content owners is largely a function 
of the size of the audience each portal reaches, and the length of time visitors stay on 
site, portals compete with one another on reach and unique visitors. Reach is defined as 
the percentage of the Web audience that visits the site in a month (or some other time 
period), and unique visitors is defined as the number of uniquely identified individuals 
who visit in a month. Portals are inevitably subject to network effects: The value of the 
portal to advertisers and consumers increases geometrically as reach increases, which, 
in turn, attracts still more customers. These effects have resulted in the differentiation 
of the portal marketspace into three tiers: a few general-purpose mega portal sites that 
garner 60%–80% of the Web audience, second-tier general-purpose sites that hover

around 20%–30% reach, and third-tier specialized vertical market portals that attract 
2%–10% of the audience. As described in Chapter 2, the top five portals/search engines 
(Google, Yahoo, MSN/Bing, AOL, and Ask) account for more than 95% of online searches 
in the United States. A similar pattern of concentration is observed when considering 
the audience share of portals/search engines (including both desktop and mobile) as 
illustrated in Figure 10.3. However, this picture is changing as large audiences move 
to social network sites, and millions of users make these sites their opening or home 
pages and the place where they spend most of their digital time. Social network sites 
like Facebook are broadening their content with videos, movies, and news, transforming 
themselves into a hybrid social network and portal. Web sites of companies that provide 
ISP services, such as Verizon, Comcast (Xfinity), Cablevision (Optimum Online), and 
others are also common portal/home pages for millions of users.
For more insight into the nature of the competition and change among the top 
portals, read Insight on Business: The Transformation of AOL.
TYPES OF PORTALS: GENERAL-PURPOSE AND VERTICAL MARKET
There are two primary types of portals: general-purpose portals and vertical market 
portals. General-purpose portals attempt to attract a very large general audience 
and then retain the audience on-site by providing in-depth vertical content channels, 
such as information on news, finance, autos, movies, and weather. General-purpose 
portals typically offer Web search engines, free e-mail, personal home pages, chat 
rooms, community-building software, and bulletin boards. Vertical content channels 
on general-purpose portal sites offer content such as sports scores, stock tickers, health 
tips, instant messaging, automobile information, and auctions.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
THE TRANSFORMATION OF AOL
You have to hand it to AOL; its cor-
porate DNA must include a gene for 
tenacity. From its inauspicious begin-
nings as an online game server for the 
Atari 2600 video game console to its diz-
zying heights as the leading ISP in the United 
States—a time that even spawned a Meg Ryan/
Tom Hanks movie entitled You’ve Got Mail after 
the ubiquitous greeting AOL users heard each time 
they signed on—to its equally staggering decline 
after its failed merger with Time Warner—somehow 
AOL has found a way to survive.
Started in the early 1980s as Control Video 
Corporation, it provided an online service called 
Gameline for the Atari 2600. The company didn’t 
make enough money, and in 1983, it was reorga-
nized as Quantum Computer Services, providing a 
dedicated online service for Commodore 64 and 
128 computers called Quantum Link. In 1988, the 
company added online services called Apple Link 
and PC Link, and in 1989, its name was changed 
to America Online.
In 1991, AOL launched an online program 
for the DOS operating system (the early Microsoft 
operating system that used text commands) and 
one for Windows the following year. AOL posi-
tioned itself as the online service for people who 
weren’t comfortable with technology, a shrewd 
move at the time. Initially, it provided proprietary 
software and charged users hefty hourly fees. In 
1996, it switched to a subscription-based model, 
charging $19.99 per month. Mass distribution of 
AOL CD-ROMs through the mail spurred adop-
tion—AOL was everywhere, giving over 10 million 
people their first exposure to the Web, e-mail, 
instant messaging, and chat rooms. However, the 
company was slow to provide access to the open 
Internet, and complaints erupted, in particular, 
about dropped connections and busy signals. Still, 
it continued to grow. In 1996, in another boon 
to its brand, AOL signed a five-year agreement 
that it would be bundled with Windows on new 
PCs. The first major Web portal for the general 
public was on its way.
In 2000, before the company’s spectacular fall 
began, Time Warner bought AOL for $165 billion. 
Despite the media fanfare, there were problems 
from the start with what is now acknowledged by 
current CEO Tim Armstrong to be the worst merger 
in corporate history. In the first year, the merged 
company already had difficulty reaching growth 
targets, possibly because AOL had improperly 
inflated its pre-merger revenue. In 2002, advertising 
revenue declined sharply. The number of AOL ISP 
subscribers peaked that year at 26.7 million and 
has been declining ever since. AOL underestimated 
the growth of broadband, doing little to develop a 
competitive offering, while Google’s search engine 
gained popularity, siphoning away advertising dol-
lars. Today, there are only around 2.2 million ISP 
subscribers. However, these subscribers still gen-
erated $606 million in 2014, almost 25% of the 
company’s revenue. Incredibly, these core dial-up 
holdouts have kept the company afloat.
Between 2002 and 2007 the company occu-
pied various positions on the continuum between 
misstep and turmoil. Its stock price plummeted, it 
was investigated by the SEC for several unorthodox 
advertising deals, the Justice Department conducted 
a criminal probe, financial reports had to be revised 
downward, and the positions of CEO and VP of 
Marketing became revolving doors. 
In 2007, AOL began pursuing a new strategy, 
creating more than a dozen niche content sites. The 
following year, Time Warner negotiated with both 
Microsoft and Google in an attempt to sell AOL. 
When this was unsuccessful, it decided to spin off 
the company instead. First, it repurchased Google’s 

714	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o m m u n i t i e s 
5% stake for $283 million. Google’s purchase 
price in 2005 had been $1 billion.
When Tim Armstrong came on board in 2009, 
he added senior staff members from Google and 
Yahoo with an eye toward turning the company 
into the biggest creator of premium content on the 
Web and the largest seller of online display ads. 
Positioning AOL to be ready when the line between 
online and broadcast programming permanently 
blurred, he began assembling the infrastructure, 
acquiring a number of companies specializing in 
the delivery of online content.The real blockbuster 
acquisition was the Huffington Post in 2011 for 
$315 million. Armstrong appeared to be betting 
big on its charismatic leader, Arianna Huffington, 
and its 25 million unique monthly visitors. Around 
20% of AOL’s workforce was eliminated following 
the purchase.
It soon became clear that the big bet was actu-
ally on online video, with HuffPost Live as one 
significant part of the wager. Launched in 2012, 
HuffPost Live features live discussions on current 
events 12 hours a day, five days a week. The unique 
twist and perceived draw is user interaction. Viewers 
submit chat comments as programs are airing and 
can also tweet and submit their own videos. Viewers 
will also increasingly be included in programming, 
so that they can engage with the host and his or her 
guest, creating a “social video” experience. Rather 
than scheduling specific programs at specific times 
of the day, or even for a set period of time, topics 
are conversational, not bound by timeframe, and 
not bound by the hot topic of the day—a sort of 
freeform television. To which Armstrong is of course 
hoping to add live advertising. Cadillac and Verizon 
are two of the main investors in the venture. 
AOL also has teams of video producers in both 
New York and Los Angeles that are creating branded 
entertainment video. Sometimes working with celeb-
rities, these teams, as well as video partners from 
around the world, are producing hundreds of videos 
a day of an informational, how-to, or entertainment 
nature. Sources include wholly owned properties 
such as TechCrunch, one of the most popular tech 
blogs on the Internet. These videos will attempt 
to tread the line between branded infomercial and 
useful and sought-after information. AOL has con-
tinued its efforts to develop original programming, 
primarily via its AOL On Channel. AOL is also not 
just relying on developing its own premium content. 
It recently reached a deal with Miramax to stream 
films on AOL On for free, supported by advertising, 
and it hopes to continue acquiring the rights to 
premium content from other studios as well. Some 
of AOL’s video productions have attracted as many 
as 15 million viewers.
AOL has also focused on programmatic adver-
tising, an automated form of ad buying that promises 
to cut out advertising middlemen and allow both 
content providers and advertisers to make more 
money. AOL announced that it had already struck 
deals with major ad agencies to participate in these 
automated ad exchanges, which it believes will begin 
a seismic shift of TV advertising dollars to online 
video. To that end, the company also bought video 
ad company Adap.tv to bolster its position in online 
video. In 2014, AOL unveiled its new automated 
advertising platform, named One, which it hopes 
will become the standard for automated purchases 
of digital media. However, other companies includ-
ing Google and Adobe are challenging One with 
their own offerings. AOL also rolled out a mobile 
native ad product across all of its sites that featured 
six times the conversion rate of traditional mobile 
banner ads and the participation of over 50 major 
brand advertisers. To improve user engagement, 
AOL purchased the advertising company Gravity, 
which personalizes sites based on users’ interests 
across Internet and social site searches, making 
them more engaging.
Many companies are opting to use AOL for 
their advertising services, none more prominent 
than Microsoft, which announced a partnership 
with AOL in 2015. AOL will handle advertising on 
Xbox, Skype, and other Microsoft products in the 
United States and many other significant markets.

In return, AOL Web sites will use Microsoft’s Bing 
search engine. The partnership strengthens AOL’s 
position in the online advertising sphere.
AOL’s burgeoning advertising business had 
made it an increasingly appealing acquisition target 
even before the Microsoft deal. Fifteen years after it 
was first purchased by Time Warner, AOL was once 
again acquired in 2015 as part of a $4.4 billion deal, 
this time by Verizon. For Verizon, the most intriguing 
piece of AOL’s business was its digital advertising 
and video capability. As a mobile carrier, Verizon 
makes money when its customers stream videos on 
their mobile devices, making the two companies a 
good match. Verizon sees a future where 
it uses its mobile network and AOL’s content 
delivery platform to successfully launch a content 
streaming business. However, the future of AOL’s 
current content properties isn’t as clear. Verizon’s 
own attempts to generate content have been mostly 
unsuccessful, so acquiring AOL provides it with 
an established foothold in that area. But regula-
tors are on guard against Internet providers also 
becoming major content providers, given the tools 
for censorship at their disposal. Verizon may elect 
to spin off entities like The Huffington Post, which 
is now valued at over $1 billion.

Vertical market portals (sometimes also referred to as destination sites or vortals) 
attempt to attract highly focused, loyal audiences with a deep interest in either com-
munity or specialized content—from sports to the weather. In addition to their focused 
content, vertical market portals have recently begun adding many of the features 
found in general-purpose portals. For instance, in addition to being a social network, 
you can also think of Facebook as a portal—the home page for millions of users, and 
a gateway to the Internet. Facebook is an affinity group portal because it is based on 
friendships among people. Facebook offers e-mail, search, games, and apps. 
The concentration of audience share in the portal market reflects (in addition 
to network effects) the limited time budget of consumers. This limited time budget 
works to the advantage of general-purpose portals. Consumers have a finite amount of 
time to spend on the Web, and as a result, most consumers visit fewer than 30 unique 
domains each month. Facing limited time, consumers concentrate their visits at sites 
that can satisfy a broad range of interests, from weather and travel information, to 
stocks, sports, and entertainment content.
General-purpose sites such as Yahoo try to be all things to all people and attract 
a broad audience with both generalized navigation services and in-depth content and 
community efforts. For instance, Yahoo has become the Web’s largest source of news: 
vertical market 
portals
attempt to attract highly 
focused, loyal audiences 
with a deep interest in 
either community or 
specialized content

more people visit Yahoo News than any other news site including online newspapers. 
Yet recent changes in consumer behavior on the Web show that consumers are spend-
ing less time “surfing the Web” and on general browsing, and more time doing focused 
searches, research, and participating in social networks. These trends will advantage 
special-purpose, vertical market sites that can provide focused, in-depth community 
and content. 
As a general matter, the general-purpose portals are very well-known brands, 
while the vertical content and affinity group portals tend to have less well-known 
brands. Figure 10.4 lists examples of general-purpose portals and the two main types 
of vertical market portals.
PORTAL BUSINESS MODELS
Portals receive income from a number of different sources. The revenue base of portals 
is changing and dynamic, with some of the largest sources of revenue declining. Table 
10.7 summarizes the major portal revenue sources.
The business strategies of both general-purpose and vertical portals have changed 
greatly because of the rapid growth in search engine advertising and intelligent ad 
placement networks such as Google’s AdSense, which can place ads on thousands of 
Web sites based on content. General portal sites such as AOL and Yahoo did not have 
well-developed search engines, and hence have not grown as fast as Google, which 
has a powerful search engine. Microsoft, for instance, has invested billions of dollars 
in its Bing search engine to catch up with Google. On the other hand, general portals 
have content, which Google did not originally have, although it added to its content by 
purchasing YouTube and adding Google sites devoted to news, financial information, 
images, and maps. Facebook users stay on-site and linger three times as long as visi-
tors to traditional portals like Yahoo. For this reason social network sites, Facebook in 
particular, are direct competitors of Yahoo, Google, and the other portals. Yahoo has

TWO GENERAL TYPES OF PORTALS: GENERAL-PURPOSE 
AND VERTICAL MARKET PORTALS
There are two general types of portals: general-purpose and vertical market. Vertical market portals may be 
based on affinity groups or on focused content.

struggled in the last three years to grow revenues and earnings despite the fact that 
its unique visitor count has held steady with Google’s. One part of the problem is the 
falling price of display ads, which are the mainstay of Yahoo’s ad platform. Another 
key issue is declining user engagement with materials on the site and the amount of 
time spent on the site. To address these issues, Yahoo has made a number of acquisi-
tions including Aviate, Tumblr, and Flickr, and launched digital magazines like Yahoo 
Food and Yahoo Tech that curate content from around the Web. The key to display ad 
revenue is content and engagement: the more you can show users, the longer they 
stay on your site, the more ad revenue can be generated. So far, Yahoo and the other 
general portal sites have not been able to compete with social network sites on these 
dimensions of engagement and time on site.
The survival strategy for general-purpose portals in the future is therefore to develop 
deep, rich vertical content in order to reach and engage customers at the site. This 
involves hiring professional journalists rather than rely on bloggers who write listicle 
articles, and offering more quality entertainment in the forms of movies, TV series, 
and music. The strategy for much smaller vertical market portals is to put together 
a collection of vertical portals to form a vertical portal network, a collection of deep, 
rich content sites. The strategy for search engine sites such as Google is to obtain more 
content to attract users for a long time and expose them to more ad pages (or screens).

hen you hear someone mention online auctions, the first site 
that comes to mind is likely eBay. Founded in 1995 as an offbeat, 
quirky place to buy and sell almost anything via auctions, eBay now 
derives the majority of its revenue from traditional e-commerce. 
As the company continues to model its business after competitors such as Amazon 
and Alibaba, eBay has banned the sales of quirkier services like tarot card readings 
and magic spells, and has instituted a rewards program with prominent retail chains 
like Dick’s Sporting Goods and Toys “R” Us. 
The transformation began in November 2007, when former CEO Meg Whitman 
exited and was replaced by former Bain & Company managing director, John Donahoe. 
The company had already begun to stall, and the trend continued through 2009. For 
many buyers, the novelty of online auctions had worn off, and they were returning to 
easier and simpler methods of buying fixed-price goods from retailers such as Amazon, 
which, by comparison, had steady growth during the same time period. Search engines 
and comparison shopping sites were also taking away some of eBay’s auction business 
by making items easier to find on the Web.
Donahoe quickly found that dramatically altering the business model of an Internet 
company is never easy, particularly one that is one of the most recognizable sites on

the Web. His three-year revival plan moved eBay away from its origins as an online 
flea market, and at first it began to resemble an outlet mall where retailers sold out-
of-season, overstocked, refurbished, or discontinued merchandise. From there it was a 
straightforward progression to partnering with retail chains to simply serve as another 
channel for current merchandise.
Small sellers were encouraged to shift away from the auction format and move 
toward the fixed-price sales model. The fee structure was adjusted, listing fees for 
fixed-price sales were lowered, improvements were made to the search engine, and 
rather than displaying ending auctions first, a formula was devised that took into 
account price and seller reputation so that highly rated merchants appeared first and 
received more exposure.
Unsurprisingly, the growing pains during this period included increasing com-
plaints from sellers about excessive fees and eBay’s favoritism toward big retailers. The 
hundreds of thousands of people who supported themselves by selling on eBay and 
many millions more who used eBay to supplement their income often felt slighted. 
With its stock continuing to drop, analysts’ faith that Donahoe could turn things around 
dwindled. This pessimism discounted eBay’s history of sensible growth marked by a 
number of canny purchases.
Its signature purchase was, of course, PayPal, whose payment services enable the 
exchange of money between individuals over the Internet. This acquisition was the key 
to eBay’s endurance through the lean years, protecting it from weakness in its auction 
business, and the propeller that pushed it towards the future. PayPal has accounted 
for over 40% of eBay’s revenues for some time, and has been a significant factor in 
eBay’s growth. In 2014, PayPal had over 152 million active accounts and continues to 
grow at a steady pace.
PayPal’s success gave eBay’s Marketplaces segment time to rebound. Strong results 
were at last realized between 2012 and 2014. eBay’s investments in mobile technol-
ogy were also an important factor in its resurgence. eBay’s mobile investments began 
in 2010 with RedLaser, a barcode-scanning mobile application. This was followed by 
Critical Path, an industry leading mobile app developer, doubling the size of eBay’s 
mobile team. eBay also purchased WHERE, a location-based media and advertising 
company with a local discovery mobile application, and Zong, a provider of mobile 
payments through mobile carrier billing. PayPal was used to purchase Fig Card, a 
small mobile payment startup. These outlays have borne fruit, supporting $47 billion 
in mobile transactions in 2013. Approximately 45% ($22 billion) of these transactions 
were mobile Marketplaces sales, while the other 55% ($27 billion) represented mobile 
PayPal transactions.
eBay recognized the coming mobile revolution even before the first iPhone or 
the establishment of the App Store, according to Olivier Ropars, senior director of 
Mobile Commerce. This prescience resulted in eBay achieving its 100 millionth app 
download and 100 millionth mobile listing relatively early on, in 2012. In 2013, eBay 
encountered increased competition in mobile commerce, and moved quickly to acquire 
mobile payment gateway Braintree for $800 million. Braintree’s technology allows 
eBay consumers to more easily make payments on smartphones and tablets, and the 
acquisition also eliminates a major competitor in that space for PayPal. In 2015, eBay 
remains on the cutting edge, introducing an app for the Apple Watch that allows users

updates for their iOS and Android apps that improve search results.
While many other acquisitions through the years have also helped to transform 
eBay from an online garage sale to a mainstream competitor with Amazon, its adoption 
of the “social, mobile, local” driving theme has been central to its survival. Positioning 
itself at the center of the online—offline—mobile triangle by offering a wide variety of 
services that enable merchants to more easily integrate their cross-channel retailing 
has been the key to eBay’s resurgence and to its continued success. 
However, eBay’s return to prominence is not without continuing challenges. In 
2014, eBay was the victim of a hacking attack that compromised the information of 
nearly 150 million of its customers. Paypal was unaffected, and the company doesn’t 
believe that any financial information was stolen, but the incident underscored the need 
for eBay to remain vigilant with its security measures. eBay sales decreased steeply 
in the wake of the breach, dropping 5.4% in 10 days. Competitors are also ramping 
up their efforts to battle eBay, with Amazon continuing to focus on third-party sales 
and Alibaba announcing a U.S.-based site to compete with eBay called 11 Main. What’s 
more, Google rolled out an update to its search algorithm, reducing eBay’s search 
traffic by as much as 33%. 
In 2015, eBay elected to spin off PayPal as its own separate company, leaving eBay 
with its Marketplaces segment, its StubHub ticket sales segment, and a handful of 
other business units. Although Donahoe and the rest of eBay’s leadership had resisted 
a spinoff for years, the move was prompted by a desire for PayPal to distinguish itself 
from eBay and become more agile within the rapidly-developing marketplace of online 
payments. As part of the split, eBay has agreed to route 80% of its sales through PayPal, 
but PayPal is free to pursue deals with other merchants, potentially boosting its market 
share even further. However, the move will surely decrease the attractiveness of what’s 
left of eBay from an investment perspective. Many investors believe PayPal has been 
the true driver of eBay’s bottom line. Analysts are already bracing for disappointing 
earnings, with shares falling in 2015 on gloomy 2016 sales projections. Nevertheless, 
eBay remains one of the most trusted online brands and e-commerce leaders, and 
it has worked hard to improve its marketplace design and offerings, including eBay 
Now, its new same-day delivery program. Will eBay be able to respond to these new 
challenges as well as it has to those in the past without PayPal to bolster it?
Case Study Questions
1.	 Contrast eBay’s original business model with its current business model. 
2.	 What are the problems that eBay is currently facing? How is eBay trying to solve 
these problems? 
3.	 Are the solutions eBay is seeking to implement good solutions? Why or why not? 
Are there any other solutions that eBay should consider? 
4.	 Who are eBay’s top three competitors online, and how will eBay’s strategy help it 
compete? Will eBay be providing a differentiated service to customers?

	10.5	 REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Describe the different types of social networks and online communities and their business models.
•	
Social networks involve a group of people, shared social interaction, common times among members, and 
a shared area for some period of time. An online social network is one where people who share common 
ties can interact with one another online.
•	
The different types of social networks and communities and their business models include: 
•	
General communities: Members can interact with a general audience segmented into numerous differ-
ent groups. Most general communities began as non-commercial subscription-based endeavors, but 
many have been purchased by larger community portal sites.
•	
Practice networks: Members can participate in discussion groups and get help or information relating 
to an area of shared practice, such as art, education, or medicine. These generally have a nonprofit 
business model in which they simply attempt to collect enough in subscription fees, sales commis-
sions, and limited advertising to cover the cost of operations.
•	
Interest-based communities: Members can participate in focused discussion groups on a shared inter-
est. The advertising business model has worked because the targeted audience is attractive to mar-
keters. Tenancy and sponsorship deals provide another similar revenue stream.
•	
Affinity communities: Members can participate in focused discussions with others who share the 
same affinity or group identification. The business model is a mixture of subscription revenue 
from premium content and services, advertising, tenancy/sponsorships, and distribution agree-
ments.
•	
Sponsored communities: Members can participate in online communities created by government, 
nonprofit, or for-profit organizations for the purpose of pursuing organizational goals. They use com-
munity technologies and techniques to distribute information or extend brand influence. The goal of 
a branded product site is to increase offline product sales. These sites do not seek to make a profit 
and are often cost centers.
Describe the major types of auctions, their benefits and costs, how they operate, when to use them, and the potential 
for auction abuse and fraud.
•	
Auctions are markets where prices vary (dynamic pricing) depending on the competition among the 
participants who are buying or selling products or services. They can be classified broadly as C2C or B2C, 
although generally the term C2C auction refers to the venue in which the sale takes place, for example, a 
consumer-oriented Web site such as eBay, which also auctions items from established merchants. A B2C 
auction refers to an established online merchant that offers its own auctions. There are also numerous 
B2B online auctions for buyers of industrial parts, raw materials, commodities, and services. Within these 
three broad categories of auctions are several major auction types classified based upon how the bidding 
mechanisms work in each system:
•	
English auctions: A single item is up for sale from a single seller. Multiple buyers bid against one 
another within a specific time frame with the highest bidder winning the object as long as the high 
bid has exceeded the reserve bid set by the seller, below which he or she refuses to sell.
•	
Dutch Internet auctions: Sellers with many identical items for sale list a minimum price or starting 
bid, and buyers indicate both a bid price and a quantity desired. The lowest winning bid that clears 
the available quantity is paid by all winning bidders. Those with the highest bid are assured of 
receiving the quantity they desire but only pay the amount of the lowest successful bid (uniform 
pricing rule).

722	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o m m u n i t i e s 
•	
Name Your Own Price or reverse auctions: Buyers specify the price they are willing to pay for an item, 
and multiple sellers bid for their business. This is one example of discriminatory pricing in which 
winners may pay different amounts for the same product or service depending on how much they 
have bid.
•	
Penny (bidding fee) auctions: Bidder pay a non-refundable fee to purchase bids.
•	
Benefits of auctions include: liquidity, price discovery, price transparency, market efficiency, lower trans-
action costs, consumer aggregation, network effects, and market-maker benefits.
•	
Costs of auctions include: delayed consumption, monitoring costs, equipment costs, trust risks, and ful-
fillment costs.
•	
Auction sites have sought to reduce these risks through various methods including rating systems, watch 
lists, and proxy bidding.
•	
Auctions can be an appropriate channel for businesses to sell items in a variety of situations. The factors 
for businesses to consider include the type of product, the product life cycle, channel management, the 
type of auction, initial pricing, bid increments, auction length, number of items, price allocation, and 
closed versus open bidding.
•	
Auctions are particularly prone to fraud, which produces information asymmetries between buyers and 
sellers. Some of the possible abuses and frauds include bid rigging, price matching, defensive shill feed-
back, offensive shill feedback, feedback extortion, transaction interference, bid manipulation, non-pay-
ment after winning, shill bidding, transaction non-performance, non-selling sellers, and bid siphoning.
Describe the major types of Internet portals and their business models.
•	
Portals are gateways to billions of Web pages available on the Internet. Originally, their primary purpose 
was to help users find information on the Web, but they evolved into destination sites that provided a 
myriad of content from news to entertainment. Today, portals serve three main purposes: navigation of 
the Web (search), content, and commerce. 
•	
Among the major portal types are:
•	
Enterprise portals: Corporations, universities, churches, and other organizations create these sites to 
help employees or members navigate to important content such as corporate news or organizational 
announcements.
•	
General-purpose portals: Examples are AOL, Yahoo, and MSN, which try to attract a very large general 
audience by providing many in-depth vertical content channels. Some also offer ISP services on a 
subscription basis, search engines, e-mail, chat, bulletin boards, and personal home pages.
•	
Vertical market portals: Also called destination sites, they attempt to attract a highly focused, loyal 
audience with an intense interest in either a community they belong to or an interest they hold. 
Vertical market portals can be divided into two main classifications, although hybrids that overlap 
the two classifications also exist.
•	
Affinity groups: Designed to serve aggregates of people who identify themselves by their attitudes, 
values, beliefs, and behavior. 
•	
Focused content portals: These sites contain in-depth information on a particular topic that all mem-
bers are interested in. They can provide content on such broad topics as sports, news, weather, 
entertainment, finance, or business, or they can appeal to a much more focused interest group such 
as boat, horse, or video game enthusiasts.
•	
Portals receive revenue from a number of different sources. The business model is presently changing 
and adapting to declines in certain revenue streams, particularly advertising revenues. Revenue sources 
can include general advertising, tenancy deals, subscription fees, and commissions on sales.
•	
The survival strategy for general-purpose portals is to develop deep, rich vertical content in order to 
attract advertisers to various niche groups that they can target with focused ads. The strategy for the

small vertical market portals is to build a collection of vertical portals, thereby creating a network of 
deep, rich content sites for the same reason.

P R O J E C T S
	 1.	 Find two examples of an affinity portal and two examples of a focused-content portal. Prepare a 
presentation explaining why each of your examples should be categorized as an affinity portal or a 
focused-content portal. For each example, surf the site and describe the services each site provides. Try 
to determine what revenue model each of your examples is using and, if possible, how many members 
or registered visitors the site has attracted.
	 2.	 Examine the use of auctions by businesses. Go to any auction site of your choosing and look for outlet 
auctions or auctions directly from merchants. Research at least three products for sale. What stage in the 
product life cycle do these products fall into? Are there quantity purchasing requirements? What was the 
opening bid price? What are the bid increments? What is the auction duration? Analyze why these firms 
have used the auction channel to sell these goods and prepare a short report on your findings.
	 3.	 Visit one for-profit-sponsored and one nonprofit-sponsored social network. Create a presentation to describe 
and demonstrate the offering at each site. What organizational objectives is each pursuing? How is the for-
profit company using community-building technologies as a customer relations management tool?
	 4.	 Visit one of the social networks listed in Table 10.1 and compare it to Facebook. In what ways is it 
similar to Facebook, and in what ways is it different? Which do you prefer, and why?

hen Souq.com was launched in 2005, 
e-commerce in the Middle East and 
North Africa (MENA) region was in 
its infancy. With no local roadmap to follow, its original 
parent company Maktoob, a 1998 Internet pioneer that 
provided the first free Arabic-supported e-mail service, 
Arabic chat, greeting cards, and content channels, opted 
to follow the successful auction format forged ten years 
earlier in the West by eBay. A souq, or souk, is a traditional 
Arab marketplace at which a wide range of products from 
wood carvings and rugs to spices and food are exchanged 
through a bargaining process between buyer and seller. In 
spite of the apropos name, Souq, based in Dubai (United 
Arab Emirates), struggled to thrive. 
Transactions between Gulf States with different cur-
rencies, laws, and regulations complicated trans-country 
shipping, often necessitating bank accounts in each country 
and requiring local business partners. Inventory management was also a challenge. And 
customers were reluctant to use online payment systems, preferring cash on delivery 
(C.O.D.) to entering credit card details online. These problems have plagued MENA retail 
and service e-commerce.
While Souq initially sought to replicate the C2C business model, it soon began cul-
tivating relationships with small businesses, encouraging them to enter online retailing 
in the cost-effective atmosphere of an online marketplace. Through trial and error, Souq 
discovered that the “Buy-It-Now” model was superior to the auction format in nations 
where auctions were not culturally accepted. Now considered the Amazon of the Middle 
East, Souq has outperformed its peers in both securing investors and encouraging entre-
preneurs to launch their businesses through its site.
In 2011, with auctions tailing off and after careful analysis, Souq fully switched to the 
fixed-price model. Souq launched a revamped Web site in April 2012, prioritizing improve-
ments to usability and search. Souq also added fulfillment centers and warehouses, hired 
delivery and warehouse personnel trained in modernized logistics systems, and updated 
its data storage systems to bolster security.
The Fawry electronic bill payment service launched in Egypt in 2010 has helped to 
overcome consumer reluctance to shop online. Buyers can go to an ATM machine, post 
office, or one of 3,000 authorized retailers including grocery stores and pharmacies to 
pay for online purchases. Amounts owed for purchases are debited from the customer’s

bank account and credited to a Fawry Payment Services account from which the payment 
to the vendor is submitted. If the customer does not have a bank account, as is common 
in the region (only 10% of the Egyptian population has a bank account), cash can be 
deposited into the Fawry network at the local corner store. The Fawry network in Egypt 
can also be used to replenish cashU prepaid online payment cards, another popular method 
of transacting business online in the MENA region.
In a move designed to attract female customers, Souq purchased Sukar.com, a high-
fashion flash sales site, in 2012 to bolster its burgeoning fashion division. Sukar benefitted 
from the use of Souq’s logistics and delivery systems while Souq gained customer service 
and fashion expertise and reinforced its position as the leading e-commerce site in the 
region. While women have lagged behind men as e-commerce consumers in the MENA 
region, increased Internet access at home and increased mobile device usage has led to a 
growth in e-commerce purchases by women.
The integration of Sukar with Souq and the launch of Souq Fashion positioned Souq 
to capitalize on this budding market segment. While in the West around 11% to 15% 
of fashion sales are derived from e-commerce, in the MENA region only a meager 1% 
of the $30 billion in fashion purchases are online. Supported by the new Web site design 
and advised by stylists for prominent stars including Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna, Souq 
Fashion provides the traditional counterpart to the daily flash sale specials offered on 
Sukar. High fashion from over 80 designers, including Arabic luminaries such as Dina JSR, 
Ronald Abdala, and Dima Ayad, are offered at reasonable price points with the additional 
benefit of advice from stylists. 
All of these improving conditions, investments, acquisitions, and upgrades likely 
contributed to Souq’s October 2012 announcement that it had sold a portion of its busi-
ness to Naspers, a South African Web and media group, and received further investment 
capital from a current shareholder, New York hedge fund Tiger Global Management. 
Naspers and Souq did not reveal the selling price, but Arabian Business estimated that 
Souq had netted in the neighborhood of $40 million. In 2014, Souq raised another $75 
million from Naspers, representing the largest round of funding by any Arab startup, and 
in 2015, Souq received additional funding from Tiger at a valuation of approximately $1 
billion. Souq proudly touts its fundraising prowess as a sign that the MENA region is an 
emerging e-commerce force. 
With the influx of cash, Souq continued to expand its operations in the UAE, Saudi 
Arabia, and Egypt. It currently features more than 200,000 products. Souq also plans 
continued support for and expansion of its network of 75,000 entrepreneurial sellers such 
as KAF, a weaving company; NAS, a design-printed T-shirts company; the Joud Store, 
a company that creates home accessories, mugs, coaster-art and trays from tiles; and 
Skinzo, a laptop covers company.
Souq has embraced mobile technology and social media as it attempts to increase 
its worldwide visibility and bolster its branding and marketing efforts. Souq’s Facebook 
page has over 7.5 million likes, and the company began maintaining multiple active 
Twitter accounts focused on different areas of operation, like the UAE and Egypt, with 
flash deals and other useful information. In 2015, Souq launched its app for the Windows

10 operating system, featuring different catalogs for each of Souq’s major markets and 
special deals exclusive to app users. 
In 2013, Souq launched its first regional advertising campaigns across the MENA 
region, displaying colorful characters interrupted by Souq deliveries. Souq established 
Egypt’s first Internet-based youth commerce training academy and has also entered agree-
ments with universities like the Canadian University of Dubai to promote entrepreneurship 
and help a new wave of young people in the MENA region develop tech skills. The company 
also partnered with regional non-profit Manzil, which provides custom-made products for 
individuals with special needs. Souq has focused on technology as well—NDOT Technologies 
developed a mobile app for Souq that allows users to shop on the go. In 2015, mobile 
customers represent half of all traffic on Souq.com and 60 percent of its user base. Souq 
has also hosted the launch of a new tablet computer developed in the UAE, the QTAB, an 
eight-inch Wi-Fi Android tablet aimed at Arabic consumers. CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar 
indicated in 2014 that the demand for the QTAB has been strong in the company’s target 
areas of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In 2015, Souq partnered with OnePlus, a smartphone 
manufacturer, to create an online store for OnePlus phones and accessories.
Given that online purchasing represents a much smaller fraction of total purchases 
in the MENA region than it does in the rest of the world, still checking in at about 1–2% 
compared to the mid- to high teens in England, Souq’s potential for growth in 2015 and 
beyond remains strong—e-commerce is growing approximately 60% every year in the 
Middle East, indicating that the region is destined to catch up quickly. Souq has even 
outpaced those figures, growing ten-fold in the last three years and with expectations of 
doubling in size in 2016. On Black Friday in 2014, Souq reported 100,000 customers, 
sales of more than 250,000 units, and 10 million site visits, and in 2015 Souq has an-
nounced “White Friday” sales, with an estimated 45 million visitors and potentially double 
the sales from the previous year.

he opening case illustrates some of the difficulties that a pure-play startup 
retail company such as Souq.com faces, particularly when starting out in 
a part of the world that has not already embraced e-commerce, such as 
North Africa and the Middle East. Pure-play start-up companies often have razor-thin profit 
margins, lack a physical store network to bolster sales to the non-Internet audience, and 
often are based on unproven business assumptions that, in the long term, may not bear out. 
In contrast, large offline retailers have established brand names, a huge real estate invest-
ment, a loyal customer base, and established inventory control and fulfillment systems. 
In Souq’s case, it originally adopted a business model based on the assumption that C2C 
auctions would find ready acceptance in its marketspace, when in fact they did not. Luckily 
for Souq, it was able to successfully transition to a B2C model and take advantage of some 
of the benefits that this model offers. For instance, a pure-play B2C company can simplify 
the existing industry supply chain and instead develop a Web-based distribution system 
that may be more efficient than traditional retail outlets. As we shall see in this chapter, 
traditional offline catalog merchants are also advantaged. We will also see that, in order to 
leverage their assets and core competencies, established offline retailers need to cultivate 
new competencies and a carefully developed business plan to succeed online. 
As with retail goods, the promise of online service providers is that they can deliver 
superior-quality service and greater convenience to millions of consumers at a lower cost 
than established bricks-and-mortar service providers and still make a respectable return 
on invested capital. The service sector is one of the most natural avenues for e-commerce 
because so much of the value in services is based on collecting, storing, and exchanging 
information—something for which the Web is ideally suited. And, in fact, online ser-
vices have been extraordinarily successful in attracting banking, brokerage, travel, and 
job-hunting customers. The quality and amount of information online to support con-
sumer decisions in finance, travel, and career placement is extraordinary, especially when 
compared to what was available to consumers before e-commerce. The online service 
sector—like online retail—has established a significant beachhead and now plays a large 
role in consumer time on the Internet. In areas such as brokerage, banking, and travel, 
online services are an extraordinary success story and have transformed their industries. 
In Sections 11.5–11.7 of this chapter, we take a close look at three of the most successful 
online services: financial services (including insurance and real estate), travel services, 
and career services. In Section 11.8, we examine the new on-demand services companies, 
such as Uber, Airbnb, and a whole host of others, that have rocketed to prominence in 
the last several years. Using a business model that is both local and mobile, this new type 
of service company provides a platform for consumers to connect with providers who 
can provide on-demand services, such as transportation, short-term room rental, grocery 
shopping, and more. 
	11.1	 THE ONLINE RETAIL SECTOR 
Table 11.1 summarizes some of these leading trends in online retailing for 2015–2016. 
Perhaps the most important theme in online retailing is the effort by retailers—both

offline and online—to integrate their operations so they can serve customers in the 
various ways they want to be served.
By any measure, the size of the global retail market is huge: around €21 trillion 
in 2015. Retail sales in Asia-Pacific account for about 38% of that total, with North 
America accounting for about 23%, and Western Europe 19%.
THE RETAIL INDUSTRY
The retail industry is composed of many different types of firms. Figure 11.1 
illustrates the major segments of the U.S. retail industry: durable goods, general 
merchandise, food and beverage, specialty stores, gasoline and fuel, mail order/
telephone order (MOTO), and online retail firms. Each of these segments offers 
opportunities for online retail, and yet in each segment, the uses of the Internet 
	
TABLE 11.1	
WHAT’S NEW IN ONLINE RETAIL 2015–2016
•	 Retail mobile e-commerce is exploding, increasing in the United Kingdom, for example, from around 
£14.2 billion In 2014 to an expected £18.6 billion in 2015.
•	 Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, together with online retailers, 
continue to try to understand how best to facilitate social e-commerce, with the introduction of Buy 
buttons on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.
•	 Local e-commerce, headlined by new local on-demand service companies such as Uber, skyrockets to 
an estimated $25 billion in the United States.
•	 The number of online buyers continues to increase to over 1.4 billion worldwide in 2015.
•	 Online retailers remain generally profitable by focusing on revenue growth, increasing the size of 
average purchase amounts, and improving efficiency of operations. 
•	 Online retail remains the fastest growing retail channel.
•	 Buying online has become a normal, mainstream, everyday experience. Almost half of all Internet 
users worldwide are now online buyers.
•	 The selection of goods for purchase online continues to increase to include luxury goods, such as 
jewelry, gourmet groceries, furniture, and wine, as customer trust and experience increase. 
•	 Informational shopping for big-ticket items such as cars and appliances continues to expand rapidly 
to include nearly all retail goods (both durables and non-durables).
•	 Specialty retail sites show rapid growth in online retail as they develop customized retail goods and 
customer online configuration of goods.
•	 Online retailers place an increased emphasis on providing an improved “shopping experience,” 
including ease of navigation and use, online inventory updates, interactive tools, customer feedback 
and ratings, and social shopping opportunities. 
•	 Online retailers increase the use of interactive marketing technologies and techniques such as blogs, 
user-generated content, and video that exploit the dominance of broadband connections and offer 
features such as zoom, color switch, product configuration, and virtual simulations of households 
and businesses.
•	 Retailers are increasingly becoming omni-channel retailers, integrating the multiple retail channels 
provided by physical stores, the Web, and the mobile platform.
•	 New virtual merchants such as Birchbox, Naturebox, and others emerge that are using a new 
subscription-based revenue model for retail.
•	 Big Data and powerful analytic programs begin to be used for predictive marketing by both large and 
small retailers.

may differ. Some eating and drinking establishments use the Web and mobile apps 
to inform people of their physical locations and menus, while others offer deliv-
ery via online orders. Retailers of durable goods typically use the online channel 
primarily as an informational tool rather than as a direct purchasing tool, although 
this has begun to change.
The MOTO sector is the most similar to the online retail sales sector. In the 
absence of physical stores, MOTO retailers distribute millions of physical catalogs 
(their largest expense) and operate large telephone call centers to accept orders. 
They have developed extraordinarily efficient order fulfillment centers that gener-
ally ship customer orders within 24 hours of receipt. MOTO was the fastest growing 
retail segment throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It grew as a direct result of improve-
ments in the national toll-free call system, the implementation of digital switching in 
telephone systems, falling long distance telecommunications prices, and of course, 
the expansion of the credit card industry and associated technologies, without which 
neither MOTO nor e-commerce would be possible on a large national scale. MOTO 
was the last “technological” retailing revolution that preceded e-commerce. Because 
of their experience in fulfilling small orders rapidly, the transition to e-commerce was 
not difficult for these firms. 
ONLINE RETAILING
Online retail is perhaps the most high-profile e-commerce sector. Over the past decade, 
this sector has experienced both explosive growth and spectacular failures. Many of 
the early pure-play online-only firms that pioneered the retail marketspace failed. 
Entrepreneurs and their investors seriously misjudged the factors needed to succeed 
in this market. But the survivors of this early period emerged much stronger, and along

COMPOSITION OF THE U.S. RETAIL INDUSTRY 
The retail industry can be grouped into seven major segments.

with traditional offline general and specialty merchants, as well as new start-ups, the 
e-tail space is growing very rapidly and is increasing its reach and size.
E-commerce Retail: The Vision
In the early years of e-commerce, literally thousands of entrepreneurial Web-based 
retailers were drawn to the marketplace for retail goods, simply because it was one of 
the largest market opportunities in the U.S. economy. Many entrepreneurs initially 
believed it was easy to enter the retail market. Early writers predicted that the retail 
industry would be revolutionized, literally “blown to bits”—as prophesized by two 
consultants in a famous Harvard Business School book (Evans and Wurster, 2000). 
The basis of this revolution would be fourfold. First, because the Internet greatly 
reduced both search costs and transaction costs, consumers would use the Web to find 
the lowest-cost products. Several results would follow. Consumers would increasingly 
drift to the Web for shopping and purchasing, and only low-cost, high-service, quality 
online retail merchants would survive. Economists assumed that the Web consumer 
was rational and cost-driven—not driven by perceived value or brand, both of which 
are nonrational factors.
Second, it was assumed that the entry costs to the online retail market were much 
less than those needed to establish physical storefronts, and that online merchants 
were inherently more efficient at marketing and order fulfillment than offline stores. 
The costs of establishing a powerful Web site were thought to be minuscule compared 
to the costs of warehouses, fulfillment centers, and physical stores. There would be no 
difficulty building sophisticated order entry, shopping cart, and fulfillment systems 
because this technology was well known, and the cost of technology was falling by 50% 
each year. Even the cost of acquiring consumers was thought to be much lower because 
of search engines that could almost instantly connect customers to online vendors.
Third, as prices fell, traditional offline physical store merchants would be forced 
out of business. New entrepreneurial companies—such as Amazon—would replace 
the traditional stores. It was thought that if online merchants grew very quickly, they 
would have first-mover advantages and lock out the older traditional firms that were 
too slow to enter the online market.
Fourth, in some industries—such as electronics, apparel, and digital content—the 
market would be disintermediated as manufacturers or their distributors entered to 
build a direct relationship with the consumer, destroying the retail intermediaries or 
middlemen. In this scenario, traditional retail channels—such as physical stores, sales 
clerks, and sales forces—would be replaced by a single dominant channel: the Web.
Many predicted, on the other hand, a kind of hypermediation based on the concept 
of a virtual firm in which online retailers would gain advantage over established offline 
merchants by building an online brand name that attracted millions of customers, and 
outsourcing the expensive warehousing and order fulfillment functions—the original 
concept of Amazon and Drugstore.com.
As it turned out, few of these assumptions and visions were correct, and the 
structure of the retail marketplace, with some notable exceptions, has not been blown 
to bits, disintermediated, or revolutionized in the traditional meaning of the word 
“revolution.” With several notable exceptions, online retail has often not been success-

734	
	
C H A P T E R  1 1     E - c o m m e r c e  R e t a i l i n g  a n d  S e r v i c e s
ful as an independent platform on which to build a successful “pure-play” Web-only 
business. As it turns out, the consumer is not primarily price-driven when shopping 
on the Internet but instead considers brand name, trust, reliability, delivery time, 
convenience, ease of use, and above all “the experience,” as at least as important as 
price (Brynjolfsson, Dick, and Smith, 2004).
However, the Internet has created an entirely new venue for omni-channel firms 
(those that sell products through a variety of channels and integrate their physical 
stores with their Web sites and mobile platform), and in some cases, the Internet has 
supported the development of pure-play online-only merchants, both general mer-
chandisers as well as specialty retailers. As predicted, online retail has indeed become 
the fastest growing and most dynamic retail channel in the sense of channel innova-
tion. The Web has created a new marketplace for millions of consumers to conve-
niently shop. The Internet and Web have continued to provide new opportunities for 
entirely new firms using new business models and new online products—such as Blue 
Nile, as previously described. The online channel can conflict with a merchant’s other 
channels, such as direct sales forces, physical stores, and mail order, but this multi-
channel conflict can be managed and turned into a strength.
The Online Retail Sector Today
Although online retailing is one of the smallest segments of the global retail industry, 
constituting about 7% of the total retail market today, it is growing at a faster rate than 
its offline counterparts, with new functionality and product lines being added every 
day. In the United States, the apparel and accessories category generates the highest 
percentage of revenue, estimated to be at around $63 billion in 2015 (see Figure 11.2). 
Consumers have a wide choice of online shopping options in this category, such as 
omni-channel department store chains like Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target, and Walmart 
and specialty retailers like Gap, Zulily, J.Crew, Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie & Fitch, 
and Ralph Lauren. This is one category where Amazon does not dominate, in part 
because clothing shoppers tend to identify more strongly with a specific brand than 
they do with products that are more of a commodity, such as consumer electronics. 
The computers and consumer electronics category generates the second-highest 
percentage of revenue, estimated at around $58 billion in 2015. Online shopping 
options for this category include Amazon, direct-manufacturers such as Apple, Dell, 
HP, and Lenovo, omni-channel chains such as Best Buy, and catalog merchants such 
as CDW and PC Connection. 
The automobile and automobile parts and accessories category is in third place, 
generating an estimated $36 billion in 2015, primarily from auto parts and accessories. 
Currently, U.S. franchising law prohibits automobile manufacturers from selling cars 
directly to consumers, so automobile retailing is dominated by dealership networks. 
Automobile manufacturers use the Internet to deliver branding advertising, while 
dealers focus on generating leads. Consumers typically focus on product and pricing 
research, which they then use to negotiate with dealers. Direct online automobile sales 
are currently not common due to the complexity of the vehicle purchasing process, 
but they are likely to become more commonplace in the future. For example, start-up 
omni-channel
retailers that sell products 
through a variety of 
channels and integrate 
their physical stores with 
their Web site and mobile

Beepi, has developed a business model based on eliminating dealers and sells used 
cars directly to consumers via a mobile app. 
Books, music, and video are among the original items sold successfully online. 
This still popular online category is expected to generate an estimated $29 billion in 
2015. Leading retailers in this category include Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google Play, 
Barnes & Noble, and Hulu. 
The furniture and home furnishing category is expected to generate an estimated 
$30 billion in 2015. In the past, the expense of shipping large items such as furniture, 
mattresses, and rugs was a deterrent to online sales, but that is beginning to change. 
In addition to Amazon, leading online retailers in this category include other purely 
online companies such as Wayfair and Overstock, as well as omni-channel retailers such 
as William-Sonoma, Restoration Hardware, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Crate and Barrel.

The health and personal care (drugs, health, and beauty supplies) category has also 
enjoyed steady growth, with an estimated $24 billion in revenue in 2015 (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2015y).
Figure 11.3 illustrates the growth of the online retail revenues worldwide. When 
we refer to online retail, we will not be including online services revenues such as 
travel, job-hunting, or the purchase of digital downloads such as software applica-
tions and music. Instead, for the purposes of this chapter, online retail refers solely to 
sales of physical goods over the Internet. The Internet provides a number of unique 
advantages and challenges to online retailers. Table 11.2 summarizes these advantages 
and challenges.
Despite the high failure rate of online retailers in the early years, more consumers 
than ever are shopping online. For most consumers, the advantages of online shop-
ping overcome the disadvantages. In 2015, it is estimated that 50% of all Internet users 
(around 1.4 billion people) will buy at an online retail store, generating about €1.2 
trillion in online retail sales. While the number of new Internet users is not growing 
as rapidly as it was, this slowdown will not necessarily reduce the growth in online 
retail e-commerce because the average shopper is spending more on the Internet 
each year and finding many new categories of items to buy. For instance, in 2003, the 
average annual amount spent online by U.S. consumers was $675, but by 2015, it had 
jumped to almost $2,000 (eMarketer, Inc., 2015a, 2005). Also, as noted in Chapter 6, 
millions of additional consumers research products online and are influenced in their 
purchase decisions at offline stores.
	 FIGURE 11.3	
THE GROWTH OF ONLINE RETAIL WORLDWIDE
Online retail revenues will be an estimated €1.5 trillion worldwide in 2015, and are expected to increase to 
€3.2 trillion by 2019, more than tripling since 2013.

Ability to lower consumers’ overall market 
transaction costs 
The primary beneficiaries of this growing consumer support are not only the pure 
online companies but also the established offline retailers who have the brand-name 
recognition, supportive infrastructure, and financial resources to enter the online 
marketplace successfully. Table 11.3 lists the top U.S. online retail firms ranked by 
online sales. The list contains pure-play online retailers for whom the Internet is the 
only sales channel, such as Amazon (in first place) and Newegg; omni-channel firms 
that have established brand names and for whom e-commerce still plays a relatively 
small role when compared to their offline physical store channels, such as Walmart, 
Sears, Macy’s, Home Depot, Costco, BestBuy, and Target; and manufacturers of com-
puter and electronic equipment, such as Apple and Dell. In 2014, the top 10 retailers 
accounted for about 50% of all online retail, while the top 500 retailers accounted for 
about 85%. The next 500 accounted for an additional 5%, so just 1,000 retailers gener-
ated approximately 90% of all retail e-commerce sales. Many of the fastest growing firms 
are mid-size merchants, particularly newcomers that focus on a particular niche, such 
as Blue Apron, which uses a subscription-based sales model for make-at-home meals, 
and Dollar Shave Club, another company that uses a subscription-based sales model 
for inexpensive razors. Conversely, companies that can’t show consumers that they 
can offer them something of value not available elsewhere are likely to have a difficult 
time surviving. For pure-play firms, the challenge is to turn visitors into customers, 
and to develop efficient operations that permit them to achieve long-term profitability.

Profitability remains a key issue for online-only retailers. Not many of these companies 
are public and therefore required to report their financial results, but of the few that 
are, only a handful were profitable in 2014. Even Amazon reported a net loss. One that 
was profitable was Zulily, a children’s and women’s clothing retailer that uses a flash 
sales model. Zulily’s revenues grew by over 70% in 2014, reaching $1.2 billion, and it 
recorded a profit of about $15 million. For traditional firms that are less dependent 
on e-commerce sales, the challenge is to integrate the offline and online channels so 
customers can move seamlessly from one environment to another.
Clearly one of the most important e-commerce retail themes of 2015–2016, and 
into the future, is the ability of offline traditional firms such as Walmart, Target, Macy’s, 
and others to continue to integrate their Web and mobile operations with their physical 
store operations in order to provide an “integrated shopping customer experience” and 
leverage the value of their physical stores. Table 11.4 illustrates some of the various 
ways in which traditional retailers have integrated the Web, the mobile platform, and 
store operations to develop nearly seamless omni-channel shopping. This list is not 
exclusive, and retailers continue to develop new links between channels.
Rather than demonstrate disintermediation, online retailing provides an example 
of the powerful role that intermediaries continue to play in retail trade. Established 
offline retailers have rapidly gained online market share. Increasingly, consumers are

attracted to stable, well-known, trusted retail brands and retailers. The online audience 
is very sensitive to brand names and is not primarily cost-driven. Other factors such 
as reliability, trust, fulfillment, and customer service are equally important.
The most significant changes in retail e-commerce in 2015 are the explosive growth 
in social e-commerce, the growing ability of firms to market local services and products 
through the use of location-based marketing, and not least, the rapidly growing mobile 
platform composed of smartphones and tablet computers. In retail circles, tablets are 
being called “the ultimate shopping machine,” enabling consumers to browse media-
rich online catalogs just like they used to do with physical catalogs, and then buy 
when they feel the urge. 
Social e-commerce refers to marketing and purchasing on social network sites 
like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, and others. All of these sites have 
developed into major marketing and advertising platforms that help direct consumers 
to external Web sites to purchase products. And, after trials in 2014, Facebook, Twitter, 
Pinterest, and Instagram have all introduced Buy buttons that allow consumers to 
more easily purchase goods on a much wider scale. In 2014, the top 500 retailers in 
Internet Retailer’s Social Media 500 earned about $3.3 billion from social commerce, 
a 26% increase over 2013.

Whereas in the past only large firms could afford to run online marketing and 
ad campaigns, this has changed with the development of local marketing firms like 
Groupon, LivingSocial, and dozens of others, as well as Amazon Local, which make it 
possible for consumers to receive discount deals and coupons from local merchants 
based on their geographic location. Using billions of daily e-mails, these so-called daily 
deal sites have sold millions of coupons to purchase local goods and services at steep 
discounts. For the first time, local merchants can advertise their products and services 
online at a relatively inexpensive cost. 
Social and local e-commerce are enabled by the tremendous growth in mobile Inter-
net devices, both smartphones and tablet computers. In 2015, U.K. retail m-commerce 
is expected to generate around £18.6 billion. Over 40% of U.K. Internet users have used 
a smartphone to shop, and 35% have used a tablet computer.   (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b, 
2015c). 
	11.2	 ANALYZING THE VIABILITY OF ONLINE FIRMS
In this and the following chapters, we analyze the viability of a number of online com-
panies that exemplify specific e-commerce models. We are primarily interested in under-
standing the near-to-medium term (1–3 years) economic viability of these firms and their 
business models. Economic viability refers to the ability of firms to survive as profitable 
business firms during the specified period. To answer the question of economic viability, 
we take two business analysis approaches: strategic analysis and financial analysis.
STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
Strategic approaches to economic viability focus on both the industry in which a firm 
operates and the firm itself (see Chapter 2, Sections 2.2 and 2.5). The key industry 
strategic factors are:
•	 Barriers to entry: Can new entrants be barred from entering the industry through 
high capital costs or intellectual property barriers (such as patents and copyrights)?
•	 Power of suppliers: Can suppliers dictate high prices to the industry or can vendors 
choose from among many suppliers? Have firms achieved sufficient scale to bargain 
effectively for lower prices from suppliers?
•	 Power of customers: Can customers choose from many competing suppliers and 
hence challenge high prices and high margins?
•	 Existence of substitute products: Can the functionality of the product or service be 
obtained from alternative channels or competing products in different industries? 
Are substitute products and services likely to emerge in the near future?
•	 Industry value chain: Is the chain of production and distribution in the industry 
changing in ways that benefit or harm the firm?
•	 Nature of intra-industry competition: Is the basis of competition within the industry based 
on differentiated products and services, price, scope of offerings, or focus of offerings? 
How is the nature of competition changing? Will these changes benefit the firm?
economic viability 
refers to the ability of firms 
to survive as profitable 
business firms during a 
specified period

The strategic factors that pertain specifically to the firm and its related businesses 
include:
•	 Firm value chain: Has the firm adopted business processes and methods of operation 
that allow it to achieve the most efficient operations in its industry? Will changes 
in technology force the firm to realign its business processes?
•	 Core competencies: Does the firm have unique competencies and skills that cannot 
be easily duplicated by other firms? Will changes in technology invalidate the firm’s 
competencies or strengthen them?
•	 Synergies: Does the firm have access to the competencies and assets of related firms 
either owned outright or through strategic partnerships and alliances?
•	 Technology: Has the firm developed proprietary technologies that allow it to scale 
with demand? Has the firm developed the operational technologies (e.g., cus-
tomer relationship management, fulfillment, supply chain management, inventory 
control, and human resource systems) to survive?
•	 Social and legal challenges: Has the firm put in place policies to address consumer 
trust issues (privacy and security of personal information)? Is the firm the subject 
of lawsuits challenging its business model, such as intellectual property owner-
ship issues? Will the firm be affected by changes in Internet taxation laws or other 
foreseeable statutory developments?
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Strategic analysis helps us comprehend the competitive situation of the firm. Financial 
analysis helps us understand how in fact the firm is performing. There are two parts 
to a financial analysis: the statement of operations and the balance sheet. The state-
ment of operations tells us how much money (or loss) the firm is achieving based on 
current sales and costs. The balance sheet tells us how many assets the firm has to 
support its current and future operations.
Here are some of the key factors to look for in a firm’s statement of operations:
•	 Revenues: Are revenues growing and at what rate? Many e-commerce companies 
have experienced impressive, even explosive, revenue growth as an entirely new 
channel is created.
•	 Cost of sales: What is the cost of sales compared to revenues? Cost of sales typically 
includes the cost of the products sold and related costs. The lower the cost of sales 
compared to revenue, the higher the gross profit.
•	 Gross margin: What is the firm’s gross margin, and is it increasing or decreasing? Gross 
margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by net sales revenues. Gross margin can 
tell you if the firm is gaining or losing market power vis-à-vis its key suppliers.
•	 Operating expenses: What are the firm’s operating expenses, and are they increasing 
or decreasing? Operating expenses typically include the cost of marketing, technol-
ogy, and administrative overhead. They also include, in accordance with profes-
sional accounting standards (see below), stock-based compensation to employees 
and executives, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and impairment 
of investments. In e-commerce companies, these turn out to be very important

expenses. Many e-commerce firms compensated their employees with stock shares 
(or options), and many e-commerce firms purchased other e-commerce firms as a 
part of their growth strategy. Many of the companies were purchased at extremely 
high values using company stock rather than cash; in numerous instances, the 
purchased companies fell dramatically in market value. All these items are counted 
as normal operating expenses.
•	 Operating margin: What did the firm earn from its current operations? Operating 
margin is calculated by dividing operating income or loss by net sales revenue. 
Operating margin is an indication of a company’s ability to turn sales into pre-tax 
profit after operating expenses have been deducted. Operating margin tells us if 
the firm’s current operations are covering its operating expenses, not including 
interest expenses and other non-operating expenses.
•	 Net margin: Net margin tells us the percentage of its gross sales revenue the firm 
was able to retain after all expenses are deducted. Net margin is calculated by divid-
ing net income or loss by net sales revenue. Net margin sums up in one number 
how successful a company has been at the business of making a profit on each dollar 
of sales revenues. Net margin also tells us something about the efficiency of the firm 
by measuring the percentage of sales revenue it is able to retain after all expenses 
are deducted from gross revenues, and, within a single industry, it can be used to 
measure the relative efficiency of competing firms. Net margin takes into account 
many non-operating expenses such as interest and stock compensation plans.
When examining the financial announcements of e-commerce companies, it is impor-
tant to realize that online firms often choose not to announce their net income according 
to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles have been promul-
gated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), a board of professional accoun-
tants that establishes accounting rules for the profession, and which has played a vital 
role since the 1934 Securities Act, which sought to improve financial accounting during 
the Great Depression. Many e-commerce firms in the early years instead reported an 
entirely new calculation called pro forma earnings (also called EBITDA—earnings before 
income taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Pro forma earnings generally do not deduct 
stock-based compensation, depreciation, or amortization. The result is that pro forma 
earnings are always better than GAAP earnings. The firms that report in this manner 
typically claim these expenses are non-recurring and special and “unusual.” In 2002 and 
2003, the SEC issued new guidelines (Regulation G) that prohibit firms from reporting 
pro forma earnings in official reports to the SEC, but still allow firms to announce pro 
forma earnings in public statements (Weil, 2003). Throughout this book, we consider a 
firm’s income or loss based on GAAP accounting standards only.
A balance sheet provides a financial snapshot of a company’s assets and liabilities 
(debts) on a given date. Assets refer to stored value. Current assets are those assets 
such as cash, securities, accounts receivable, inventory, or other investments that are 
likely to be able to be converted to cash within one year. Liabilities are outstanding 
obligations of the firm. Current liabilities are debts of the firm that will be due within 
one year. Liabilities that are not due until the passage of a year or more are character-
ized as long-term debt. For a quick check of a firm’s short-term financial health, 
examine its working capital (the firm’s current assets minus current liabilities). If

	11.3	 E-COMMERCE IN ACTION: E-TAILING BUSINESS 
MODELS
So far, we have been discussing online retail as if it were a single entity. In fact, as 
we briefly discussed in Chapter 2, there are four main types of online retail business 
models: virtual merchants, omni-channel merchandisers (sometimes referred to as 
bricks-and-clicks or clicks-and-bricks), catalog merchants, and manufacturer-direct 
firms. Figure 11.4 illustrates the respective shares of 2014 U.S. online retail sales for 
each of these categories of firms. In addition, there are small mom-and-pop retailers 
that use the eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo Stores sales platforms, as well as affiliate mer-
chants whose primary revenue derives from sending traffic to their “mother” sites. 
Each of these different types of online retailers faces a different strategic environment, 
as well as different industry and firm economics.
VIRTUAL MERCHANTS
Virtual merchants are single-channel e-commerce firms that generate almost all 
their revenue from online sales. Virtual merchants face extraordinary strategic chal-

lenges. They must build a business and brand name from scratch, quickly, in an 
entirely new channel and confront many virtual merchant competitors (especially in 
smaller niche areas). Because these firms typically do not have any physical stores, 
they do not have to bear the costs associated with developing and maintaining physi-
cal stores but they face large costs in building and maintaining an e-commerce pres-
ence, building an order fulfillment infrastructure, and developing a brand name. 
Customer acquisition costs are high, and the learning curve is steep. Like all retail 
firms, their gross margins (the difference between the retail price of goods sold and 
the cost of goods to the retailer) are low. Therefore, virtual merchants must achieve 
highly efficient operations in order to preserve a profit, while building a brand name 
as quickly as possible in order to attract sufficient customers to cover their costs of 
operations. Most merchants in this category adopt low-cost and convenience strategies, 
coupled with extremely effective and efficient fulfillment processes to ensure custom-
ers receive what they ordered as fast as possible. In the following E-commerce in Action 
section, we take an in-depth look at the strategic and financial situation of Amazon, 
the leading online virtual merchant. In addition to Amazon, other successful virtual 
merchants include Newegg, Overstock, Rakuten (Buy.com), Gilt Groupe, Zulily, Wayfair, 
Rue La La, Blue Nile, Bluefly, Hayneedle, Net-a-Porter, and Shoebuy. Recently, a new 
group of virtual merchants have emerged that use a subscription revenue model. 
Examples include Birchbox (personalized beauty samples delivered monthly), Stitch 
Fix (clothing selected by a personal stylist) (see the Insight on Technology case, Big Data 
and Predictive Marketing, on pages 594–595 for more on Birchbox and Stitch Fix), Barkbox 
(pet supplies), Naturebox (healthy snacks), Bulu Box (supplements and vitamins), and 
hundreds more. According to Internet Retailer, overall, virtual merchants accounted 
for $125 billion (about 42%) of online U.S. retail sales by the Internet Retailer Top 500 
merchants in 2014 (Internet Retailer, 2015).
AMAZON
Amazon, the Seattle-based virtual merchant, is one of the most well-known names in the 
world. As stated in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, Amazon’s objective is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. Exactly 
what this means, and how it might be possible to achieve it, is a matter of speculation 
for both customers and investors. Yet this has not stopped Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, 
and his team from becoming the world’s most successful and innovative online retailer.
Few business enterprises have experienced the roller-coaster ride from explosive 
early growth, to huge losses, and then on to profitability that Amazon has. No Internet 
business has been both so widely reviled and so hotly praised throughout its develop-
ment. Its stock reflects these changing fortunes, fluctuating over the past 15 years, 
from an early high of $106 in 1999, to a low of $6 a share in 2001, then bouncing back 
and forth between $50–$90 in 2003–2009, and then climbing again to high of over $580 
in 2015. While controversial, Amazon has also been one of the most innovative online

retailing stories in the history of e-commerce. From the earliest days of e-commerce, 
Amazon has continuously adapted its business model based on both its market experi-
ence and its insight into the online consumer.
The Vision
The original vision of founder Jeff Bezos and his friends was that the Internet was a 
revolutionary new form of commerce and that only companies that became really 
big early on (ignoring profitability) would survive. The path to success, according to 
founder Bezos, was to offer consumers three things: the lowest prices, the best selec-
tion, and convenience (which translates into feature-rich content, user-generated 
reviews of books and products, fast and reliable fulfillment, and ease of use). Currently, 
Amazon offers consumers millions of unique new, used, and collectible items in a 
variety of different categories, both physical and digital. Its physical goods include 
books, movies, music, and games; electronics and computers; home, garden, and tools; 
grocery; health and beauty; toys, kids, and baby; clothing, shoes, and jewelry; sports 
and outdoors; and auto and industrial. Its digital products include unlimited instant 
videos, digital games and software, MP3s and Cloud Player, Audible audiobooks, and 
Kindle e-book reader products. And if Amazon does not carry it, it will help you find 
it at online merchants who “rent space” from Amazon, or even at an external online 
vendor. In short, Amazon has become the largest, one-stop online merchant, a kind 
of combined “shopping portal” and “product search portal” that puts it in direct com-
petition with other large online general merchants, eBay, and general portals such as 
Yahoo, MSN, and even Google. As Amazon succeeded in becoming the world’s largest 
online store, it also expanded its original vision to become one of the largest suppliers 
of online merchant and search services. 
Business Model
Amazon’s business is currently organized into two basic segments: North American 
and International. Within those segments, it serves not only retail customers but also 
merchants and developers. The retail component of the business sells physical and 
digital products that Amazon has purchased and then resells to consumers just like 
a traditional retailer. It also manufactures and sells a variety of versions of its Kindle 
e-reader and Kindle Fire series of devices, including tablet computers and smart TVs. 
The Fire smartphone has been less successful, due to a lack of available apps.
Another major component of Amazon’s business is its third-party merchant segment. 
Amazon Services enables third parties to integrate their products into Amazon’s Web 
site, and use Amazon’s customer technologies. In the early years of its business, Amazon 
entered into partnerships with large merchants such as Toys“R”Us, Borders, and Target, 
and created storefronts for these companies within the larger Amazon site. Today, 
Amazon has increasingly left the enterprise-level business to competitors and instead 
focused its efforts on small and medium-sized retail merchants. 
Thousands of these types of merchants have signed on with Amazon, offering 
products that in some instances even compete with those that Amazon itself sells. 
For instance, a single product on the Amazon Web site may be listed for sale simul-
taneously by Amazon, by a large branded merchant participant such as Target, and

C H A P T E R  1 1     E - c o m m e r c e  R e t a i l i n g  a n d  S e r v i c e s
by a business or individual selling a new, used, or collectible version of the product 
through Amazon Marketplace. For these types of merchants, Amazon is not the seller 
of record, does not own these products, and the shipping of products is usually handled 
by the third party (although in some instances, Amazon provides fulfillment services 
as well). Amazon collects a monthly fixed fee, sales commission (generally estimated 
to be between 10% and 20% of the sale), per-unit activity fee, or some combination 
thereof from the third party. In this segment, Amazon acts as an online shopping 
mall, collecting “rents” from other merchants and providing “site” services such as 
order entry and payment. 
In many respects, Amazon’s third-party seller segment is an effort to compete 
directly with eBay, the Web’s most successful third-party merchant sales platform. 
eBay has a registered trading community of over 157 million active buyers and sellers. 
Amazon has even developed its own version of PayPal, Checkout by Amazon, designed 
for use at the point of sale. At the same time, eBay itself has moved closer to Amazon’s 
business model by encouraging merchants to sell rather than auction goods on its site.
Another major part of Amazon’s business is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Through 
this segment, Amazon offers a variety of Web services that provide developers with 
direct access to Amazon’s technology platform and allow them to build their own 
applications based on that platform. In 2014, AWS accounts for $4.6 billion of Amazon’s 
revenues and is on track to generate over $6 billion in 2015. Refer to Chapter 3 for a 
more detailed examination of AWS. 
Despite the success of AWS, Amazon still generates revenue primarily by selling 
products. While Amazon started out as an online merchant of books, CDs, and DVDs, 
since 2002, it has diversified into becoming a general merchandiser of millions of other 
products. Amazon has turned itself into a major online media and content firm and, 
following its success with Kindle e-books, has also made a strong move into the music 
and streaming video business, with Amazon Music and Amazon Instant Video. In 2014, 
25% of its revenue came from media sales while electronics and general merchandise 
accounted for 68%. In addition to Amazon.com in the United States, Amazon also 
operates a number of localized sites in Europe, Asia, and Canada. Although Amazon 
derives 37% of its gross revenue offshore, its international revenue growth decreased 
to only 12% in 2014, while North American revenue grew by 25%. 
Financial Analysis
Amazon’s revenues have increased from about $600 million in 1998 to an astounding 
$89 billion in 2014 (see Table 11.5). From 2011 to 2014, Amazon’s revenues have more 
than doubled. This is very impressive, explosive revenue growth. However, Amazon’s 
growth strategies have made it difficult for the company to maintain consistent profits.
Although it showed a profit of $631 million in 2011, in 2012, Amazon experienced a 
net loss of $39 million. In 2013, it reversed that loss and reported net income of $274 
million but fell short of analysts’ estimates. In 2014, Amazon once again reported a 
net loss of $241 million, due in large part to operating expenses that rose from $19 
billion in 2013 to $26 billion in 2014. Even though investors are generally unhappy with 
Amazon’s poor earnings record, they have driven the price of the stock to as high as

$580 a share in 2015. What this means is that investors are still betting that Amazon 
will keep growing for a long time and that ultimately, it will be able to consistently 
earn significant profits.
At the end of December 2014, Amazon had about $17.4 billion in cash and market-
able securities. These liquid assets were obtained from sales, sales of stock and notes 
to the public, venture capital investors, and institutional investors in return for equity 
(shares) in the company or debt securities. Total assets are about $54 billion. The 
company emphasizes the strength of its “free cash flow” as a sign of financial strength, 
suggesting it has more than enough cash available to cover short-term liabilities (such 
as financing holiday season purchasing). Amazon’s current assets should certainly be 
enough to cover future short-term deficits should they occur.
Strategic Analysis—Business Strategy
Amazon engages in a number of business strategies that seek to maximize growth in 
sales volume, while cutting prices to the bare bones. Its revenue growth strategies 
include driving the growth of e-book sales by offering continuing enhancements of 
its Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire tablet computer, both in the United States and 
internationally, as well as new e-book publishing initiatives; expanding further into 
the device manufacturing business; expanding its music and streaming video busi-
ness, with its Amazon Music and Instant Video services; expanding its Amazon Web 
Services offerings and extending their geographic reach; moving toward a broader 
trading platform by expanding the third-party seller segment; and moving toward 
greater product focus by grouping its offerings into major categories called stores. 
Amazon is still following Walmart’s and eBay’s examples by attempting to be a mass-
market, low-price, high-volume online supermarket where you can get just about 
anything. To achieve profitability in this environment, Amazon has invested heavily 
in supply chain management and fulfillment strategies to reduce its costs to the 
bare minimum while providing excellent customer service and even free shipping.
Specific programs to increase retail revenues are the continuation of free ship-
ping from Amazon Retail (a strategy that has increased order sizes by 25%), Amazon 
Prime (which for $99 a year provides free two-day shipping and one-day delivery 
upgrades for $3.99, as well as free access to Prime Music and Prime Video), greater 
product selection, and shorter order fulfillment times. Amazon offers customers 
same-day shipping in 14 markets in the United States and now offers its Prime Now 
one-hour delivery service in nine cities. A ticking clock can be seen next to some 
Amazon sale items indicating the hours remaining for an order to make it to the 
customer by the next day.
Amazon has moved strongly into the mobile shopping space as well, with shop-
ping apps for the iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Windows Phone, and iPad. It also has 
Deals, Price Check, and Student apps for the iPhone and has opened an Appstore for 
Android applications. In 2015, it rolled out the initial version of its Amazon Prime 
Now mobile app, which is quickly expanding across the United States and offers 
delivery speeds as fast as one hour. In 2014, Amazon earned around $16.8 billion 
from mobile commerce, and analyts expect that amount to increase signficantly 

in 2015. Amazon has not been as successful in developing its own smartphone, 
however. In 2015, it withdrew its resources from the continued development of the 
Amazon Fire phone, which had opened to underwhelming sales in 2014 and never 
developed an audience. 
Amazon has continued to build on the rousing success of its Kindle e-book reader 
platform, which it has touted as the best-selling product in its history. It has continued 
to release iterations of the Kindle e-book reader and Fire. According to Amazon, it now 
sells more Kindle books than all print books combined. 
In 2012, Amazon increased its efforts in the entertainment business, adding 
content to its Instant Video library through an expanded content licensing agree-
ment with NBC Universal and similar arrangements with CBS, Viacom, and nearly 
every major Hollywood studio. Further agreements were inked with Viacom, PBS, 
A+E, Scripps Networks, and FX in 2013. In 2014, it added HBO and developed a 
series of original shows to keep pace with closest competitor NetFlix. In 2015, Amazon 
announced that its content creation arm, Amazon Studios, would begin to develop 
original movies for theatrical release. These films will move to Amazon Prime within 
just a month or two of their debut.
On the cost side, Amazon increasingly uses “postal injection” for shipping, in 
which Amazon trucks deliver pre-posted packages to U.S. Postal System centers. 
In 2012, Amazon began an aggressive strategy to build warehouses all across the 
country to improve its delivery speeds. This has continued through 2015, with new 
fulfillment centers opening in New Jersey, Texas, and North Carolina. Many of 
Amazon’s customers who had previously been exempt must now pay sales tax due 
to legislation in a number of states. With this competitive advantage evaporating, 
Amazon is seeking to trump all competitors on delivery speed. The ultimate goal 
for Bezos and Amazon: same-day delivery in many areas of the country, perhaps 
even via airborne delivery drones, in the near future, as part of a project called 
Amazon Prime Air.
Strategic Analysis—Competition
Amazon has both offline and online competition. Major competitors includes eBay 
(its primary online competitor) and omni-channel retailers such as Walmart, Sears, 
and JCPenney. Amazon also competes in a number of product areas with catalog 
merchants such as L.L.Bean and Lands’ End and with other online bookstores such 
as Barnesandnoble.com. Insofar as portal sites such as MSN and Yahoo operate online 
stores, they are also competitors. Another growing rival is China-based Alibaba, which 
handles more business worldwide than eBay and Amazon combined and which went 
public in 2014. Amazon also competes with Web services firms that provide hosting, 
shopping cart, and fulfillment services. What’s more, it has fully engaged iTunes 
and Netflix in competition by offering video and audio downloads. Amazon Music 
allows users to store and play music online, offers over 35 million DRM-free MP3 
songs from both major music labels and thousands of independent labels, and can 
be played on virtually any hardware device and managed with any music software. 
Amazon Instant Video offers over 100,000 movies and TV shows to rent or buy, and

Amazon Prime Music, launched in 2014, offers over 1 million tracks that users can 
stream for free.
Strategic Analysis—Technology
Anyone who believes that information technology doesn’t make a difference clearly 
does not know much about Amazon. Amazon arguably has the largest and most 
sophisticated collection of online retailing technologies available at any single online 
site. It has implemented numerous Web site management, search, customer interac-
tion, recommendation, transaction processing, and fulfillment services and systems 
using a combination of its own proprietary technologies and commercially avail-
able, licensed technologies. Amazon’s transaction-processing systems handle millions 
of items, numerous status inquiries, gift-wrapping requests, and multiple shipment 
methods. Customers can receive orders in single or multiple shipments, based on 
availability, and track the progress of each order. On the fulfillment side, every ware-
house employee carries a shoehorn-sized device that combines a bar code scanner, a 
display screen, and a two-way data transmitter. It continues to invest heavily in AWS, 
new versions of the Kindle e-reader, and consumer electronics such as the Kindle Fire 
devices. In 2014, Amazon spent over $9.2 billion on technology and new content and 
is on track to spend even more in 2015.
Strategic Analysis—Social and Legal Challenges
Amazon continually faces lawsuits concerning various aspects of its business. Most 
common are patent infringement suits, largely settled out of court. Currently, there 
are a number of pending patent suits, including some involving the Kindle. 
In recent years, Amazon has faced increased challenges from states eager to 
begin collecting sales taxes from online purchases. Until 2011, only customers in five 
states were required to pay sales taxes. Between distribution center expansion and 
state legislation requiring large online sellers to collect sales tax even in the absence 
of a physical presence, that number has ballooned to 26 in 2015. Although Amazon 
lost several legal battles involving the imposition of sales taxes, early on, many states 
had offered it sweet tax break deals  to lure its business, perhaps not expecting that 
untaxed sales would become billions of dollars in lost tax revenue. As many of those 
deals expire, Amazon has already begun, as mentioned previously, an aggressive (and 
costly) expansion of its warehousing infrastructure across the United States to support 
same-day delivery. 
Future Prospects
In 2015, Amazon finally began to show investors and analysts what they had been 
waiting years to see—signs of long-term profitability. The company reported a $92 
million profit in the second quarter of 2015, up from a $126 million loss over the same 
period in 2014. North American sales, particularly in electronics and general merchan-
dise, spurred the strong quarter, and Amazon’s projections indicate that this growth is 
likely to continue throughout the year and beyond. The profitability of its AWS unit is 
also a major positive for Amazon, and that segment showed continued rapid growth.

Amazon Prime is also a key component of the company’s strong performance. Overall, 
over the first six months of 2015, Amazon registered over $45 billion in sales, up over 
17% from the $39 billion logged during the same period the previous year. While the 
company continues to spend heavily on future products and services, Amazon at last 
appears to have turned the corner to profitability (Amazon, 2015a, 2015b; Golden, 
2015; D’Onfro, 2015; Bensinger, 2015; Silbert, 2015; Asay, 2015; Lindner, 2015; Del 
Ray, 2015; Singleton, 2015; Somaiya, 2014; Portillo, 2014; McIntyre, 2014; Ovide, 2014; 
Demos and Jarzemsky, 2014). 
OMNI-CHANNEL MERCHANTS: BRICKS-AND-CLICKS
Also called omni-channel merchants, bricks-and-clicks companies have a network of 
physical stores as their primary retail channel, but also have online offerings. Omni-
channel firms include Walmart, Macy’s, Sears, JCPenney, Staples, OfficeMax, Costco, 
Target, and other brand-name merchants. While bricks-and-clicks merchants face high 
costs of physical buildings and large sales staffs, they also have many advantages such 
as a brand name, a national customer base, warehouses, large scale (giving them lever-
age with suppliers), and a trained staff. Acquiring customers is less expensive because 
of their brand names, but these firms face challenges in coordinating prices across 
channels and handling returns of Web purchases at their retail outlets. However, these 
retail players are used to operating on very thin margins and have invested heavily in 
purchasing and inventory control systems to control costs, and in coordinating returns 
from multiple locations. Bricks-and-clicks companies face the challenge of leveraging 
their strengths and assets to the Web, building a credible Web site, hiring new skilled 
staff, and building rapid-response order entry and fulfillment systems. According to 
Internet Retailer, in 2014, the chain retailers accounted for around $100 billion (around 
34%) of all the Internet Retailer Top 500’s U.S. online retail sales (Internet Retailer, 2015). 
Macy’s is a prime example of a traditional merchant based on physical stores 
moving successfully to become an omni-channel retailer. Rowland H. Macy opened 
the first R.H. Macy & Co. store in New York City in 1858, and moved the flagship store 
(now the site of the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving parade) to Herald Square at 34th 
Street and Broadway in 1902. Today, Macy’s is one of the largest national department 
store chains, with around 775 Macy’s department stores throughout the United States.
Like many traditional retailers, Macy’s has had to change its business model to 
accommodate the Internet. Macy’s (then called Federated Department Stores Inc.) 
jumped into e-commerce in 1995 with the creation of the Macys.com Web site. In 
1999, Federated bought Fingerhut, at that time a leading catalog and direct marketer, 
in part for its expertise in e-commerce fulfillment and database management. Although 
the Fingerhut acquisition did not prove to be a financial success, Macy’s e-commerce 
efforts benefitted from the acquisition.
In 2015, Macy’s ranked 7th on Internet Retailer’s list of the top 500 retail Web sites 
ranked by annual sales, with about $5.4 billion in online sales, representing over 30% 
bricks-and-clicks 
companies that have a 
network of physical stores 
as their primary retail 
channel, but have also 
introduced online offerings

growth over 2013, and more than tripling since 2010. Growth of its physical store sales 
pales by comparison, and in 2015, it announced that it might close as many as 40 of 
its physical stores in 2016 as it focuses more and more on its e-commerce operations. 
The Macy’s Web site receives around 13 million monthly unique visitors. Web site 
features and functions include an interactive catalog, enlarged product views, ability 
to see products in different colors and from alternate views, including via zoom and 
videos. It also offers product comparisons, product ratings, and product recommenda-
tions, as well as a real-time inventory check system. Macy’s ranked 6th in the 2015 
National Retail Federation Favorite Retail Stores survey of companies with respect to 
the best e-commerce sites for convenience, safety, and customer service.
Macy’s has jumped into social media as well, with a Facebook page that has over 
14 million Likes, a Twitter feed with over 870,000 followers, a Pinterest page with 48 
different boards, over 670,000 pins, and 116,000 followers, and a YouTube channel 
with over 6 million views. Macy’s is also an early adopter of Buyable Pins recently 
introduced by Pinterest.
Mobile sales at Macy’s are booming, and reached an estimated $790 million in 
2014, according to Internet Retailer, 13th on their list of the top 500 mobile retailers 
for 2014. It has iPhone and Android apps, new versions of which it launched in 2014, 
and an HMTL5 mobile Web site powered by Usablenet. It currently gets most of its 
mobile sales from tablets (65%) and via its mobile Web site (also 65%). It has also tried 
QR codes, SMS marketing, and augmented reality. In a trial run into mobile game 
advertising, Macy’s ran an ad in the Pandora iPhone application that encouraged users 
to play a game while listening to music. The top of the ad promoted a one-day sale, 
and after playing the game, users could click through to visit the Macy’s mobile site, 
where the sale was promoted. Previously, Macy’s had partnered with Spotify as one 
of Spotify’s first mobile advertisers. Macy’s ran audio ads inside Spotify’s iPhone app 
to promote its MStyleLab, targeted at Millennials. In 2015, Macy’s continues to focus 
on refining its omni-channel approach, encompassing its physical stores, its Web site, 
and the mobile platform. It was among the first retailers to support Apple Pay, Apple’s 
mobile payment system, offering it in addition to Macy’s own mobile wallet that allows 
shoppers to virtually store and access offers and coupons. It is piloting same-day deliv-
ery of products ordered online in 8 major U.S. markets, using Deliv, a crowd-sourced 
delivery provider. Its Buy Online Pickup In Store program, piloted in 2013, also rolled 
out to all Macy’s stores nationwide. It is also piloting new point-of-sale technology that 
will enable shoppers to purchase with mobile devices while in the store, as well as 
iBeacon technology (see Chapter 7) (Macy’s, 2015; Internet Retailer, 2015a; Bloomberg 
News, 2015; Smith, 2015; Kats, 2013; Love, 2013; Johnson, 2012).
CATALOG MERCHANTS
Catalog merchants such as Lands’ End, L.L.Bean, CDW Corp., PC Connection, and 
Cabela’s are established companies that have a national offline catalog operation, but 
who have also developed online capabilities. Catalog merchants face very high costs 
for printing and mailing millions of catalogs each year—many of which have a half-life 
of 30 seconds after the customer receives them. Catalog merchants typically have 
developed centralized fulfillment and call centers, extraordinary service, and excellent 
catalog merchants 
established companies that 
have a national offline 
catalog operation that is 
their largest retail channel, 
but who have recently 
developed online 
capabilities

fulfillment in partnership with package delivery firms such as FedEx and UPS. Catalog 
firms have suffered in recent years as catalog sales growth rates have fallen. As a result, 
catalog merchants have had to diversify their channels either by building stores 
(L.L.Bean), being bought by store-based firms (Sears purchased Lands’ End), or by 
building a strong Web presence.
Catalog firms are uniquely advantaged because they already possess very efficient 
order entry and fulfillment systems. However, they face many of the same challenges 
as bricks-and-mortar stores—they must leverage their existing assets and competen-
cies to a new technology environment, build a credible Web presence, and hire new 
staff. Nevertheless, according to Internet Retailer, in 2014, its Internet Retailer Top 
500 catalog merchants generated combined online sales of about $29.6 billion in the 
United States (Internet Retailer, 2015).
Arguably one of the most successful online catalog merchants is LandsEnd.com. 
Lands’ End started out in 1963 in a basement of Chicago’s tannery district selling 
sailboat equipment and clothing, handling 15 orders on a good day. Since then it 
expanded into a direct catalog merchant, distributing over 200 million catalogs annu-
ally and selling a much expanded line of “traditionally” styled sport clothing, soft 
luggage, and products for the home. Lands’ End was the first apparel retailer to have 
an e-commerce-enabled Web site, launching in 1995 with 100 products and travelogue 
essays. Located in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, it has since grown into one of the Web’s most 
successful apparel sites.
Lands’ End has always been on the leading edge of online retailing technolo-
gies, most of which emphasize personal marketing and customized products. Lands’ 
End was the first e-commerce Web site to allow customers to create a 3-D model of 
themselves to “try on” clothing. Lands’ End “Get Live Help” enables customers to chat 
online with customer service representatives; Lands’ End Custom allows customers to 
create custom-crafted clothing built for their personal measurements. While custom-
ized clothing built online was thought to be a gimmick in the early years of online 
retailing, today, 40% of Lands’ End clothing sold online is customized. In 2003, Lands’ 
End was purchased by Sears (which itself was purchased by Kmart in 2004) and then 
was spun off as an independent company again in 2014, with 2014 online revenues of 
about $1.2 billion. In 2015, Lands’ End was 15th on the National Retail Foundation’s 
Favorite 50 survey (Smith, 2015). Features that garner praise include live video chat, 
product recommendations that reflect a shopper’s preferences, content display based 
on the shopper’s location and referral source, and iPhone and iPad apps that deliver 
Lands’ End catalogs to mobile users. The digital catalogs contain exclusive content, 
including stories written by Lands’ End employees. Shoppers can also visit Lands’ 
End on Facebook, where it has over 1.2 million Likes. Lands’ End also has a Twitter 
presence, where it has about 65,000 followers, and 38 different Pinterest boards with 
12,500 followers (Landsend.com, 2015).
MANUFACTURER-DIRECT
Manufacturer-direct firms are either single- or multi-channel manufacturers that 
sell directly online to consumers without the intervention of retailers. Manufacturer-
direct firms were predicted to play a very large role in e-commerce manufacturers,

but this has generally not happened. The primary exceptions are computer hardware, 
such as Apple, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, and apparel manufacturers, such as Ralph 
Lauren, Nike, Under Armour, Carter’s, Tory Burch, Deckers, Kate Spade, Jones Retail, 
and Vera Bradley. Most consumer products manufacturers do not sell directly online, 
although this has started to change. For instance, Procter & Gamble offers PGeStore, 
which carries over 50 different Procter & Gamble brands. Overall, according to Internet 
Retailer, consumer brand manufacturers account for about $41 billion (14%) of its Inter-
net Retailer Top 500 online retail sales in the United States (Internet Retailer, 2015a).
Manufacturer-direct firms sometimes face channel conflict challenges. Channel 
conflict occurs when retailers of products must compete on price and currency of 
inventory directly against the manufacturer, who does not face the cost of maintaining 
inventory, physical stores, or sales staffs. Firms with no prior direct marketing experi-
ence face the additional challenges of developing a fast-response online order and fulfill-
ment system, acquiring customers, and coordinating their supply chains with market 
demand. Switching from a supply-push model (where products are made prior to 
orders received based on estimated demand and then stored in warehouses awaiting 
sale) to a demand-pull model (where products are not built until an order is received) 
has proved extremely difficult for traditional manufacturers. Yet for many products, 
manufacturer-direct firms have the advantage of an established national brand name, 
an existing large customer base, and a lower cost structure than even catalog merchants 
because they are the manufacturer of the goods and thus do not pay profits to anyone 
else. Therefore, manufacturer-direct firms should have higher margins.
One of the most frequently cited manufacturer-direct retailers is Dell Inc., the 
world’s largest direct computer systems supplier, providing corporations, govern-
ment agencies, small-to-medium businesses, and individuals with computer products 
and services ordered straight from the manufacturer’s headquarters in Austin, Texas. 
Although sales representatives support corporate customers, individuals and smaller 
businesses buy direct from Dell by phone, fax, and via the Internet, with about $3.6 
billion in sales generated online in 2014 (ranking 2nd only to Apple among consumer 
brand manufacturers and 12th on Internet Retailer’s Top 500 list of online retailers) 
(Internet Retailer, 2015).
When Michael Dell started the company in 1984 in his college dorm room, his idea 
was to custom-build computers for customers, to eliminate the middleman, and more 
effectively meet the technology needs of his customers. Today, the company sells much 
more than individual computer systems; it also offers enterprise systems, desktop, and 
laptop computers, as well as installation, financing, repair, and management services. By 
relying on a build-to-order manufacturing process, the company achieves faster inven-
tory turnover (five days), and reduced component and finished goods inventory levels; 
this strategy virtually eliminates the chance of product obsolescence.
The direct model simplifies the company’s operations, eliminating the need to 
support a wholesale and retail sales network, as well as cutting out the costly associ-
ated markup, and gives Dell complete control over its customer database. In addition, 
Dell can build and ship custom computers nearly as fast as a mail-order supplier can 
pull a computer out of inventory and ship it to the customer. 
To extend the benefits of its direct sales model, Dell has aggressively moved sales, 
service, and support online. Each month, the company typically has about 6 million

unique visitors at the Dell Web site, where it maintains an estimated 80 country-specific 
Web sites. Dell’s Premier service enables companies to investigate product offerings, 
complete order forms and purchase orders, track orders in real time, and review order 
histories all online. For its small business customers, it has created an online virtual 
account executive, as well as a spare-parts ordering system and virtual help desk with 
direct access to technical support data. Dell has also continued to broaden its offerings 
beyond pure hardware product sales, adding warranty services, product integration 
and installation services, Internet access, software, and technology consulting, refer-
ring to them as “beyond the box” offerings. These include nearly 30,000 software and 
peripheral products from leading manufacturers that can be bundled with Dell prod-
ucts. Dell has also embraced social media. It has a corporate blog, called Direct2Dell, 
and a presence on Facebook (with over 8.5 million Likes), Pinterest (with 15 boards, 
including boards on entrepreneurship, infographics, and tech tips), and Twitter (with 
almost 525,000 followers). It posts Twitter-exclusive sales for those who follow Dell 
Outlet. It also has a channel on YouTube that it calls the Dell Vlog Channel, with over 
55,000 subscribers. In 2011, it released mobile apps for the iPhone and Android that 
featured in-app purchasing, customer ratings and reviews, product comparison, order 
tracking, a Shopping Advisor, and easy access to various customer support options. 
Dell promoted the release of the app via both a standard e-mail campaign and one 
optimized for mobile viewing, and discovered that the open rate for the mobile e-mail 
was twice that of the standard version, and the clickthrough rate was more than five 
times higher. In 2012, Dell redesigned its two-year-old mobile site, with a new layout, 
updated HTML5 navigation, and a host of new functionalities, including shopping 
assistance, Dell’s full product image gallery, social sharing, mobile live chat, a product 
comparison tool, and simpler, more intuitive purchase process, as well as a more robust 
set of mobile analytics tools. By 2014, it was reaping the benefits, with mobile revenue 
triple what it was in 2012 (Dell, Inc.; Internet Retailer, 2015, 2014; Dusto, 2012). 
COMMON THEMES IN ONLINE RETAILING
We have looked at some very different companies in the preceding section, from entre-
preneurial virtual merchants to established offline giants. Online retail is the fastest 
growing channel in retail commerce, has the fastest growing consumer base, and has 
growing penetration across many categories of goods. On the other hand, profits for 
many start-up ventures have been difficult to achieve, and it took even Amazon eight 
years to show its first profit. 
The reasons for the difficulties experienced by many online retailers in achieving 
profits are also now clear. The path to success in any form of retail involves having a 
central location in order to attract a larger number of shoppers, charging high enough 
prices to cover the costs of goods as well as marketing, and developing highly efficient 
inventory and fulfillment systems so that the company can offer goods at lower costs 
than competitors and still make a profit. Many online merchants failed to follow these 
fundamental ideas, lowering prices below the total costs of goods and operations, failing 
to develop efficient business processes, failing to attract a large enough audience to 
their Web sites, and spending far too much on customer acquisition and marketing. 
By 2015, the lessons of the past have been learned, and far fewer online merchants

C H A P T E R  1 1     E - c o m m e r c e  R e t a i l i n g  a n d  S e r v i c e s
are selling below cost, especially if they are start-up companies. There’s also been a 
change in consumer culture and attitudes. Whereas in the past consumers looked to the 
Web for really cheap prices, in 2015, they look to online purchasing for convenience, 
time savings, and time shifting (buying retail goods at night from the sofa). Consumers 
have been willing to accept higher prices in return for the convenience of shopping 
online and avoiding the inconvenience of shopping at stores and malls. This allows 
online merchants more pricing freedom. 
A second common theme in retail e-commerce is that, for the most part, disinterme-
diation has not occurred and the retail middleman has not disappeared. Indeed, virtual 
merchants, along with powerful offline merchants who moved online, have maintained 
their powerful grip on the retail customer, with some notable exceptions in electronics 
and software. Manufacturers—with the exception of electronic goods—have used the 
Web primarily as an informational resource, driving consumers to the traditional retail 
channels for transactions. Leaving Amazon aside, the most significant online growth has 
been that of offline general merchandiser giant intermediaries such as Walmart, Sears, 
Costco, JCPenney, Macy’s, Target, and Nordstrom. Many of the first-mover, Web pure-
play merchants (online intermediaries) failed to achieve profitability and closed their 
doors en masse as their venture capital funds were depleted. Traditional retailers have 
been the fast followers (although many of them cannot be characterized as particularly 
“fast”) and are most likely to succeed online by extending their traditional brands, com-
petencies, and assets. In this sense, e-commerce technological innovation is following 
the historical pattern of other technology-driven commercial changes, from automobiles 
to radio and television, where an explosion of start-up firms attracts significant invest-
ment, but quickly fail, and are consolidated into larger existing firms. 
A third theme is that in order to succeed online, established merchants need to 
create an integrated shopping environment that combines their catalog, store, and 
online experiences into one. Customers want to shop wherever they want, using any 
device, and at any time. Established retailers have significant fulfillment, inventory 
management, supply chain management, and other competencies that apply directly 
to the online channel. To succeed online, established retailers need to extend their 
brands, provide incentives to consumers to use the online channel (which given the 
same prices for goods is more efficient to operate than a physical store), avoid channel 
conflict, and build advertising campaigns using online search engines such as Google, 
Yahoo, and Bing, and shopping comparison sites. 
A fourth theme is the growth of online specialty merchants selling high-end, fash-
ionable and luxury goods such as diamonds (Blue Nile), jewelry (Tiffany), and high 
fashion (Emporio Armani and Gilt) or selling discounted electronics (BestBuy), apparel 
(Gap), or office products (OfficeDepot). These firms are demonstrating the vitality and 
openness of the Internet for innovation and extending the range of products available 
online. Many virtual merchants have developed large, online customer bases, as well 
as the online tools required to market to their customer base. These online brands 
can be strengthened further through alliances and partnerships that add the required 
competencies in inventory management and fulfillment services. Virtual merchants 
need to build operational strength and efficiency before they can become profitable.

Another theme in 2015 is the continuing extraordinary growth in social com-
merce, local marketing and commerce, and mobile commerce. In the space of eight 
years since the first iPhone appeared, the mobile platform has emerged as a retail 
marketing and shopping tool, which will greatly expand e-commerce, potentially 
driving e-commerce to 20% of all commerce in the next five years. Local merchants 
will be a major benefactor of the growing mobile commerce platform. In an equally 
short time, people have begun to spend an increasing amount of their Internet time 
on social network sites where they share attitudes and experiences about business 
firms, products, and services. In a few years, social sites may turn into large pur-
chasing venues. 
A final theme in 2015 is the increasing use by retailers, large and small, of Big 
Data in their marketing efforts. The Insight on Technology case, Big Data and Predictive 
Marketing, examines this development.
	11.4	 THE SERVICE SECTOR: OFFLINE AND ONLINE
The service sector is typically the largest and most rapidly expanding part of the 
economies in advanced industrial nations such as the United States, and many Euro-
pean and some Asian countries. E-commerce in the service sector offers extraordinary 
opportunities to deliver information, knowledge, and transaction efficiencies.
The major service industry groups are finance, insurance, real estate, travel, pro-
fessional services such as legal and accounting, business services, health services, and 
educational services. Business services include activities such as consulting, advertis-
ing and marketing, and information processing. Within these service industry groups, 
companies can be further categorized into those that involve transaction brokering 
(acting as an intermediary to facilitate a transaction) and those that involve providing 
a “hands-on” service. For instance, one type of financial service involves stockbrokers 
who act as the middle person in a transaction between buyers and sellers. Online 
mortgage companies such as LendingTree refer customers to mortgage companies 
that actually issue the mortgage. Employment agencies put a seller of labor in contact 
with a buyer of labor. The service involved in all these examples is brokering a trans-
action.
In contrast, some industries perform specific hands-on activities for consumers. In 
order to provide their service, these professionals need to interact directly and person-
ally with the “client.” For these service industries, the opportunities for e-commerce 
are somewhat different. Currently, doctors and dentists cannot treat patients over the 
Internet. However, the Internet can assist their services by providing consumers with 
information, knowledge, and communication.
With some exceptions (for example, providers of physical services, such as clean-
ing, gardening, and so on), perhaps the most important feature of service industries 
(and occupations) is that they are knowledge- and information-intense. In order to 
provide value, service industries process a great deal of information and employ a 
transaction brokering 
acting as an intermediary 
to facilitate a transaction

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE MARKETING 
Big Data is a phrase that refers to 
the deluge of digital data that is 
being produced by 3.1 billion people 
using the Internet, 1.8 billion using 
smartphones, over 1.5 billion people on 
social networks, and an explosion of data 
sensors from home thermostats, RFID tags on 
goods in stores, wearable computing devices like 
Apple Watch, to retail store cameras and traffic 
counters. Estimates vary, but an IBM report 
claimed Big Data amounts to 2.5 billion gigabytes 
a day. It is estimated that 80% of the world’s 
digital data has been created in the last two years. 
But Big Data is more than about volume, It is also 
about velocity: data comes in real time torrents, 
loses value quickly, and requires rapid responses; 
variety: the data deluge contains both structured 
numeric data and unstructured text documents, 
e-mail, video, audio, stock ticker data and financial 
transactions; variability: the flow of data is event 
driven and leads to peak loads, followed by relative 
calm; and complexity: the data comes from differ-
ent sources and requires cleansing, matching, and 
reformatting in order to be useful. Storing all this 
data requires new kinds of database technologies, 
and analyzing all this data involves software called 
business analytics. 
Big Data is important for business because 
it can lead to better decisions and competitive 
advantages for firms that get it right. Nowhere is 
this more true than retailing where a great deal 
of consumer information is now being generated, 
new products are continually arriving on the scene, 
and customers have a lot of choices about where 
to buy. Big Data is influencing the design and mar-
keting of retail products and in-store sales efforts. 
Big Data and powerful analytics programs make 
possible predictive marketing, the ability to send 
personalized messages to customers recommend-
ing products before they ask. The hope for retail 
firms is that Big Data will make us all into big 
spenders. 
Predictive marketing is not entirely new. 
Skilled salespeople have always been able to size 
up a customer and predict how much a customer 
is willing to spend, informing what they decide to 
show a customer. It’s called salesmanship. Predic-
tive marketing is different because it is not based 
on traditional sales skills but instead on the col-
lection of data and the use of software programs 
to maximize the likelihood of a sale. Predictive 
marketing can scale to millions of customers and 
make decisions in milliseconds. 
Big Data and predictive marketing are not just 
for huge national retailers, but now can be used by 
much smaller firms as well. One such firm is Stitch 
Fix, a women’s clothing retailer who is using the 
monthly subscription revenue model popularized 
by Birchbox (discussed below). Stitch Fix blends 
expert styling advice, software, and unique prod-
ucts to deliver a personalized shopping experience. 
Customers fill out a Style Profile online, which is 
then analyzed by the firm’s proprietary software 
to identify products that the customer is likely to 
purchase. Personal stylists interpret the output of 
the system and then handpick five clothing items 
and accessories each month that are unique to the 
customer’s taste, budget, and life style. The cus-
tomer is not required to purchase the items until 
they have been received and accepted; they can be 
returned if they do not suit. Over time, the software 
it uses keeps track of what the customer purchased, 
and learns to make better predictions in the future 
based on what customers actually keep (as opposed 
to what they say they want, a key difference). The 
better Stitch Fix can make the right choices about 
what its customers will likely buy, the more revenue 
it generates. The key to the success of this system 
is the data collected in the Style Profile online 
questionnaire that has about 20 questions involv-

ing basic demographic information, plus a photo 
section that depicts seven different styles. Custom-
ers can respond to each style suggestion to anchor 
themselves in the Stitch Fix software. Based on the 
customer’s demographic information and selections 
of preferred styles, the software predicts which of 
several thousand products the customer would like. 
Stitch Fix is growing explosively, with industry 
analysts projecting that it will take in more than 
$200 million in revenue in 2015 without having to 
resort to much paid marketing. Stitch Fix already 
has three distribution centers, with plans to open a 
fourth in November 2015. 
Birchbox is another subscription-based 
retailer using predictive marketing and Big Data. 
Birchbox calls itself a discovery commerce plat-
form and claims to be redefining the retail process 
by offering consumers a unique and personalized 
way to discover, learn about, and shop for the best 
beauty, grooming, and lifestyle products. Head-
quartered in New York City, Birchbox launched in 
2010 and extended into men’s products in 2012 
with Birchbox Man. Customers fill out a survey 
telling the company their skin color, hair type, age, 
and favorite grooming products. The company uses 
software to match that personal information with 
profiles of other customers, observes what these 
other customers have purchased, and makes an 
educated guess about the beauty products new 
customers will purchase. The software program 
analyzes a 15-page profile of each customer, with 
over 66 characteristics tracked. For each product 
in inventory, a predictive heat score is produced 
that is, in essence, the probability that the cus-
tomer will purchase a product. Birchbox then fills 
a box each month with beauty samples that match 
the customer’s profile. Birchbox has raised 
over $70 million in funding over the past five 
years, operates in six countries, and has over 
800 brand partners and more than 1 million sub-
scribers. Its revenue is estimated to be in the $150 
million range. 
At the other end of the spectrum Walmart, 
the world’s largest retailer with over $485 billion 
in revenue, is using Big Data and predictive mar-
keting both online and in its stores. Over 50% of 
Walmart’s Web traffic comes from mobile devices. 
Walmart’s strategy is to turn mobile devices into 
shopping instruments for both online and offline 
shopping. Its mobile app generates shopping lists 
automatically for customers based on what they 
and other customers purchase each week. When 
the customer is in the store, a proximity market-
ing feature prompts the user to switch into store 
mode, and then customers are sent discounts and 
loyalty offers. 
Experience with Big Data and predictive 
marketing in retail is still somewhat limited in 
2015. There are many pilot projects, but little 
information on how well these systems really 
work for online or offline retail firms. The ability 
of Big Data to reverse the reduction in shoppers 
at physical retail stores that has occurred in the 
last few years is not certain. So far, there appears 
to be more data than there is analysis and strat-
egy in predictive marketing. In opinion surveys, 
firms identify getting value from the data they 
have as the most challenging aspect of predic-
tive marketing. A key limitation is the scarcity of 
data scientists who can bring meaning to the data, 
and managers who can translate these results into 
sales tactics and strategies.

highly skilled, educated workforce. For instance, to provide legal services, you need 
lawyers with law degrees. Law firms are required to process enormous amounts of 
textual information. Likewise with medical services. Financial services are not so 
knowledge-intensive, but require much larger investments in information processing 
just to keep track of transactions and investments. In fact, the financial services sector 
is the largest investor in information technology, with over 80% of invested capital 
going to information technology equipment and services.
Services differ in the amount of personalization and customization required, 
although just about all services entail some personalization or customization. Some 
services, such as legal, medical, and accounting services, require extensive personaliza-
tion—the adjustment of a service to the precise needs of a single individual or object. 
Others, such as financial services, benefit from customization by allowing individuals 
to choose from a restricted menu. The ability of Internet and e-commerce technol-
ogy to personalize and customize service, or components of service, is a major factor 
undergirding the extremely rapid growth of e-commerce services. Future expansion 
of e-services will depend in part on the ability of e-commerce firms to transform their 
customized services—choosing from a list—into truly personalized services, such as 
providing unique advice and consultation based on a digital yet intimate understand-
ing of the client (at least as intimate as professional service providers).
	11.5	 ONLINE FINANCIAL SERVICES
The online financial services sector is a shining example of an e-commerce success 
story, but one with many twists and turns. While the innovative online firms such as 
E*Trade have been instrumental in transforming the brokerage industry, the impacts 
of e-commerce on the large, powerful banking, insurance, and real estate firms have 
been delayed by consumer resistance and the lack of industry innovation. For instance, 
online-only banks have not displaced or transformed the large national banks or even 
regional and local banks. But e-commerce has nevertheless transformed the banking 
and financial industries, as the major institutions have deployed their own online 
applications to service an increasingly connected online customer base. Insurance has 
become more standardized and easier to purchase online. Although security is still a 
concern, consumers are much more willing to trust online sites with their financial 
information than in the past. Firms such as Mint (now owned by Quicken), SmartyPig, 
Credit Karma, Moven, and Simple (now owned by Spanish banking giant BBVA) con-
tinue to show growth. Multi-channel, established financial services firms—the slow 
followers—also continue to show modest gains in online transactions.
ONLINE FINANCIAL CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
Surveys show that consumers are attracted to financial sites because of their desire to 
save time and access information rather than save money, although saving money is an 
important goal among the most sophisticated online financial households. Most online 
consumers use financial services sites for mundane financial management, such as check-

	
O n l i n e  F i n a n c i a l  S e r v i c e s 	

761
ing balances of existing accounts, and paying bills, most of which were established offline. 
Once accustomed to performing mundane financial management activities, consumers 
move on to more sophisticated capabilities such as using personal financial management 
tools, making loan payments, and considering offers from online institutions. 
ONLINE BANKING AND BROKERAGE
NetBank and Wingspan Bank pioneered online banking in the United States in 1996 
and 1997, respectively. Although late by a year or two, the established brand-name 
national banks have taken a substantial lead in market share as the percentage of their 
customers who bank online has grown rapidly. The top banks are all large, national 
banks that also offer online banking: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, 
Wells Fargo, and Capital One. The major direct banks (those that operate without a 
network of branches or branded ATMs) include Ally, Discover, Capital One 360, State 
Farm, and USAA. These direct banks have seen customer deposits grow faster than 
regular banks, indicating their growing popularity, particularly with younger custom-
ers. Several start-ups have also moved into the online banking and financial services 
spaces. For instance, Moven offers debit account services linked with online and mobile 
financial management tools. Simple, owned by Spanish bank BBVA, provides checking 
accounts linked to debit cards in addition to financial management tools. 
In 2015, according to a July 2015 European Commission survey, around 65% of 
Internet users in the United Kingdom use online banking at least twice a month. Mobile 
banking has become an important banking channel for all age groups, with almost 40% 
of U.K. Internet users indicating that they use mobile banking. While online banking 
has become a primary banking channel for age groups, Millennials (those in the 18- to 
34-year-old group) are adopting mobile banking at a much higher rate than those who 
are older. Top mobile banking activities include checking balances and bank statements, 
viewing recent transactions, transferring money from one account to another, paying bills, 
making bill payments, and depositing checks using smartphone apps that snap a photo 
of the check. Security issues still deter some. A survey by Javelin Strategy & Research 
found that about 45% of those surveyed cited security concerns as the reason why they 
did not use mobile banking services (eMarketer, 2015d, 2015e; Chaudhuri, 2014). 
From the bank’s perspective, online and mobile banking can provide significant 
cost savings. According to Javelin Strategy & Research, the average in-person transac-
tion at a bank branch costs $4.25, while an online transaction costs 19 cents, and a 
mobile transaction, just 10 cents (Javelin Strategy & Research, 2013). 
The history of online brokerage has been similar to that of online banking. Early 
innovators such as E*Trade have been displaced from their leadership positions in 
terms of numbers of online accounts by discount broker pioneer Charles Schwab and 
financial industry giant Fidelity (which has more mutual fund customers and more 
funds under management than any other U.S. firm).
According to comScore, almost 50 million U.S. Internet users have access to an 
online brokerage account and online trading sites averaged about 10.8 million visi-
tors a month. Over 33% of visitors use a mobile device, or both a mobile device and a 
computer (comScore, 2014a, 2014b). The most frequent activities conducted on mobile 
devices include monitoring one’s portfolio and the market, getting stock quotes, placing 

762	
	
C H A P T E R  1 1     E - c o m m e r c e  R e t a i l i n g  a n d  S e r v i c e s
and checking on orders, and doing general financial research. The top trading Web 
site among U.S. Internet users in 2015 is Fidelity Investments, with around 6.3 million 
monthly unique visitors (see Table 11.6). The major online brokerage firms are invest-
ing significantly in search engine marketing, and are among the biggest spenders in 
the paid search market. They are also increasingly using social media to engage with 
customers, although they must be careful to comply with all regulations and rules as 
they do so. For instance, some brokerage firms use Twitter to deliver commentary, 
company information, marketing, and customer service. As with banking, Millennials 
use mobile devices for investment services with much greater frequency than older 
investors (eMarketer, 2015f).
Multi-Channel vs. Pure Online Financial Services Firms
Online consumers prefer to visit financial services sites that have physical outlets or 
branches. In general, multi-channel financial services firms that have both physical 
branches or offices and solid online offerings are growing faster than pure-online firms 
that have no physical presence, and they are assuming market leadership as well. Tra-
ditional banking firms have literally thousands of branches where customers can open 
accounts, deposit money, take out loans, find home mortgages, and rent a safety deposit 
box. Top online brokerage firms do not have the same physical footprint as the banks do, 
but each has a strong physical presence or telephone presence to strengthen its online 
presence. Fidelity has walk-in service center branches, but it relies primarily on the 
telephone for interacting with investors. Charles Schwab has investment centers around 
the country as an integral part of its online strategy. Pure-online banks and brokerages 
cannot provide customers with some services that still require a face-to-face interaction.
Financial Portals and Account Aggregators
Financial portals are sites that provide consumers with comparison shopping ser-
vices, independent financial advice, and financial planning. Independent portals do 
not themselves offer financial services, but act as steering mechanisms to online 
providers. They generate revenue from advertising, referral fees, and subscription 
financial portals 
sites that provide

services, independent

fees. For example, Yahoo’s financial portal, Yahoo Finance, offers consumers the ability 
to track their stock portfolio, market overviews, real-time stock quotes, news, financial 
advice, and streaming video interviews with financial leaders. Other independent 
financial portals include Intuit’s Quicken, MSN’s MSN Money, and CNNMoney. A host 
of financial portal sites have sprung up to help consumers with financial management 
and planning such as Mint (owned by Quicken), SmartPiggy, and Credit Karma. 
Account aggregation is the process of pulling together all of a customer’s finan-
cial (and even nonfinancial) data at a single personalized Web site, including brokerage, 
banking, insurance, loans, frequent flyer miles, personalized news, and much more. 
For example, a consumer can see his or her TD Ameritrade brokerage account, Fidel-
ity 401(k) account, Travelers Insurance annuity account, and American Airlines fre-
quent flyer miles all displayed on a single site. The idea is to provide consumers with 
a holistic view of their entire portfolio of assets, no matter what financial institution 
actually holds those assets.
The leading provider of account aggregation technology is Yodlee. It uses screen-
scraping and other techniques to pull information from 14,000 different data sources. 
A smart-mapping technology is also used so that if the underlying Web sites change, 
the scraping software can adapt and still find the relevant information. Today, Yodlee is 
used by 800 leading financial institutions and companies, including 9 of the 15 largest 
U.S. banks, and this network reaches more than 100 million end users (Yodlee, 2015).
ONLINE MORTGAGE AND LENDING SERVICES
During the early days of e-commerce, hundreds of firms launched pure-play online 
mortgage sites to capture the U.S. home mortgage market. Early entrants hoped to 
radically simplify and transform the traditional mortgage value chain process, dramati-
cally speed up the loan closing process, and share the economies with consumers by 
offering lower rates.
By 2003, over half of these early-entry, pure-online firms had failed. Early pure-
play online mortgage institutions had difficulties developing a brand name at an 
affordable price and failed to simplify the mortgage generation process. They ended 
up suffering from high start-up and administrative costs, high customer acquisition 
costs, rising interest rates, and poor execution of their strategies.
Despite this rocky start, the online mortgage market is slowly growing; it is domi-
nated by established online banks and other online financial services firms, traditional 
mortgage vendors, and a few successful online mortgage firms.
Many mortgage shoppers research mortgages online, but few actually apply online 
because of the complexity of mortgages. Most mortgages today are written by inter-
mediary mortgage brokers, with banks still playing an important origination role but 
generally not servicing mortgages they originate. 
Although online mortgage originations currently represent a small percentage of 
all mortgages, their number is expected to continue to grow slowly but surely over 
the next several years.
Consumer benefits from online mortgages include reduced application times, 
market interest rate intelligence, and process simplification that occurs when par-
ticipants in the mortgage process (title, insurance, and lending companies) share a 
account aggregation 
the process of pulling 
together all of a customer’s 
financial (and even 
nonfinancial) data at a 
single personalized Web 
site

common information base. Mortgage lenders benefit from the cost reduction involved 
in online processing of applications, while charging rates marginally lower than tra-
ditional bricks-and-mortar institutions.
Nevertheless, the online mortgage industry has not transformed the process of 
obtaining a mortgage. A significant brake on market expansion is the complexity of 
the mortgage process, which requires physical signatures and documents, multiple 
institutions, and complex financing details—such as closing costs and points—that are 
difficult for shoppers to compare across vendors. Nevertheless, as in other areas, the 
ability of shoppers to find low mortgage rates online has helped reduce the fees and 
interest rates charged by traditional mortgage lenders.
ONLINE INSURANCE SERVICES
In 1995, the price of a $500,000 20-year term life policy for a healthy 40-year-old male 
was $995 a year. In 2015, the same policy could be had for around $345—a decline of 
about 65%—while other prices have risen 15% in the same period. In a study of the 
term life insurance business, Brown and Goolsbee discovered that Internet usage led 
to an 8%–15% decline in term life insurance prices industry-wide (both offline and 
online), and increased consumer surplus by about $115 million per year (and hence 
reduced industry profits by the same amount) (Brown and Goolsbee, 2000). Price 
dispersion for term life policies initially increased, but then fell as more and more 
people began using the Internet to obtain insurance quotes.
Unlike books and CDs, where online price dispersion is higher than offline, and 
in many cases online prices are higher than offline, term life insurance stands out as 
one product group supporting the conventional wisdom that the Internet will lower 
search costs, increase price comparison, and lower prices to consumers. Term life 
insurance is a commodity product, however, and in other insurance product lines, 
the Web offers insurance companies new opportunities for product and service dif-
ferentiation and price discrimination.
The insurance industry forms a major part of the financial services sector. It has four 
major segments: automobile, life, health, and property and casualty. Insurance products 
can be very complex. For example, there are many different types of non-automotive 
property and casualty insurance: liability, fire, homeowners, commercial, workers’ 
compensation, marine, accident, and other lines such as vacation insurance. Writing an 
insurance policy in any of these areas is very information-intense, often necessitating 
personal inspection of the properties, and it requires considerable actuarial experience 
and data. The life insurance industry has also developed life insurance policies that defy 
easy comparison and can only be explained and sold by an experienced sales agent. 
Historically, the insurance industry has relied on thousands of local insurance offices 
and agents to sell complex products uniquely suited to the circumstances of the insured 
person and the property. Complicating the insurance marketplace is the fact that the 
insurance industry is not federally regulated, but rather is regulated by 50 different state 
insurance commissions that are strongly influenced by local insurance agents. Before a 
Web site can offer quotations on insurance, it must obtain a license to enter the insur-
ance business in all the states where it provides quotation services or sells insurance.
Like the online mortgage industry, the online insurance industry has been very 
successful in attracting visitors who are looking to obtain prices and terms of insur-

	
O n l i n e  F i n a n c i a l  S e r v i c e s

765
ance policies. While many national insurance underwriting companies initially did 
not offer competitive products directly online because it might injure the business 
operations of their traditional local agents, the Web sites of almost all of the major 
firms now provide the ability to obtain an online quote. Even if consumers do not 
actually purchase insurance policies online, the Internet has proven to have a power-
ful influence on consumer insurance decisions by dramatically reducing search costs 
and changing the price discovery process. According to a 2015 survey, over 70% of 
American consumers looked for life insurance information online, with 30% indicating 
that the Internet was their most valuable source of information. However, consumers 
also continue to rely on financial advisors as well for advice, with over half seeking 
information from both sources (LIMRA, 2015). Another survey found that nearly 2 
in 3 consumers who own a mobile device said they already have or plan to use those 
devices to access services to their life insurance policies, although currently only about 
30% of life insurance services have such capabilities (LIMRA, 2014a). Other forms of 
insurance are more likely to be purchased online. For instance, according to a 2014 
comScore study, the online channel continues to be consumers’ preferred method 
for shopping for auto insurance policies, with over 70% of shoppers getting an online 
quote. Over 35% indicated that they would likely purchase auto insurance online in 
the future, up 5% from 2011 (comScore, 2014c). Insurance companies are also making 
increased use of social media. For instance, a LIMRA survey found that over 90% of 
life insurance companies had social media programs, up from 60% in 2010. Facebook 
and LinkedIn are the most popular platforms, both used by over 90% (LIMRA, 2014b). 
All of the major insurers, such as GEICO, Allstate, State Farm, Progressive, and Travel-
ers, have a significant online presence. Some of the leading online insurance services 
companies include InsWeb, Insure.com, Insurance.com, QuickQuote, and NetQuote.
ONLINE REAL ESTATE SERVICES
During the early days of e-commerce, real estate seemed ripe for an Internet revolution 
that would rationalize this historically local, complex, and local agent-driven industry that 
monopolized the flow of consumer information. Potentially, the Internet and e-commerce 
might have disintermediated this huge marketspace, allowing buyers and sellers, renters 
and owners, to transact directly, lower search costs to near zero, and dramatically reduce 
prices. However, this did not happen. What did happen is extremely beneficial to buyers 
and sellers, as well as to real estate agents. At one point, there were an estimated 100,000 
real estate sites on the Internet worldwide. Many of these sites have disappeared. However, 
the remaining online sites have started to make headway toward transforming the indus-
try. In addition, most local real estate brokers in the United States have their own agency 
Web sites to deal with clients, in addition to participating with thousands of other agencies 
in multiple listing services that list homes online. Some of the major online real estate sites 
are Realtor.com and its parent, Move.com (now owned by global media giant News Corp.), 
Zillow and Trulia (now owned by the same company), HomeGain, ZipRealty, Craigslist, 
and Redfin. Zillow and Trulia together account for about 30% of all desktop and mobile 
visits to real estate sites in 2015, while Realtor.com attracts about 11% of traffic (Hagey, 
2015). 
Real estate differs from other types of online financial services because it is impos-
sible to complete a property transaction online. Clearly, the major impact of Internet 

766	
	
C H A P T E R  1 1     E - c o m m e r c e  R e t a i l i n g  a n d  S e r v i c e s
real estate sites is in influencing offline decisions. The Internet has become a com-
pelling method for real estate professionals, homebuilders, property managers and 
owners, and ancillary service providers to communicate with and provide information 
to consumers. According to the National Association of Realtors, 93% use the Internet 
to search for a home, with 50% using a mobile Website or app as part of the search. 
For many of these (43%), looking online was the first step in the process. At the same 
time, 88% used the services of a real estate agent to complete the purchase (National 
Association of Realtors, 2014). 
The primary service offered by real estate sites is a listing of houses available. In 
August 2015, Realtor.com, the official site of the National Association of Realtors, listed 
over 4 million homes and had over 11 million unique visitors. Listings typically feature 
detailed property descriptions, multiple photographs, and virtual 360-degree tours. Con-
sumers can link to mortgage lenders, credit reporting agencies, house inspectors, and 
surveyors. There are also online loan calculators, appraisal reports, sales price histories 
by neighborhood, school district data, crime reports, and social and historical information 
on neighborhoods. Some online real estate brokers now charge substantially less than 
traditional offline brokers who typically charge 6% of the sale price. They can do this 
because the buyers (and in some cases, the sellers) do much of the work of traditional 
real estate agents, such as prospecting, choosing neighborhoods, and identifying houses 
of interest prior to contacting an online agent. For instance, Move (the parent company 
of Realtor.com) also offers a “Find a Neighborhood” feature that allows users to choose 
the type of neighborhood they want to live in by weighing factors such as the quality (and 
tax costs) of schools, age of the population, number of families with children nearby, 
and available social and recreational services. Move also offers mobile apps for the iPad 
and iPhone, Android, and Windows phones. For instance, the Area Scout function allows 
users to see the list prices of all homes in a neighborhood on the street level. 
Despite the revolution in available information, there has not been a revolution 
in the industry value chain. The listings available on Web sites are provided by local 
multiple listing services supported by local real estate agents. Sometimes, addresses 
of the houses are not available, and online users are directed to the local listing agent 
who is hired by the seller. Traditional hands-on real estate brokers will show the house 
and handle all transactions with the owner to preserve their fees, typically ranging 
from 5% to 6% of the transaction. 
	11.6	 ONLINE TRAVEL SERVICES
Online travel is one of the most successful B2C e-commerce segments. The Internet 
has become the most common channel used by consumers to research travel options, 
seek the best possible prices, and book reservations for airline tickets, hotel rooms, 
rental cars, cruises, and tours. Today, more travel is booked online than offline. Online 
travel services revenues are expected to reach €439 billion in 2015, and continue 
growing to over €609 billion by 2019 (see Figure 11.5) In the United Kingdom, about 
29 million (67% of U.K. Internet users) are expected to research travel in 2015 and 
over 26 million will book travel online (eMarketer, Inc., 2015g).

WHY ARE ONLINE TRAVEL SERVICES SO POPULAR?
Online travel sites offer consumers a one-stop, convenient, leisure and business travel 
experience where travelers can find content (descriptions of vacations and facilities), 
community (chat groups and bulletin boards), commerce (purchase of all travel ele-
ments), and customer service (usually through call centers). Online sites offer much 
more information and many more travel options than traditional travel agents. For suppli-
ers—the owners of hotels, rental cars, and airlines—the online sites aggregate millions of 
consumers into singular, focused customer pools that can be efficiently reached through 
on-site advertising and promotions. Online sites create a much more efficient market-
place, bringing consumers and suppliers together in a low-transaction cost environment.
Travel services are an ideal service for the Internet, and therefore e-commerce 
business models work well for this product. Travel is an information-intensive product 
requiring significant consumer research. It is a digital product in the sense that travel 
requirements—planning, researching, comparison shopping, reserving, and payment—
can be accomplished for the most part online in a digital environment. On the travel 
reservation side, travel does not require any “inventory”: there are no physical assets. 
And the suppliers of the product—owners of hotels, airlines, rental cars, vacation 
rooms, and tour guides—are highly fragmented and often have excess capacity. Always 
looking for customers to fill vacant rooms and rent idle cars, suppliers will be anxious 
to lower prices and willing to advertise on Web sites that can attract millions of con-
sumers. The online intermediaries—such as Travelocity, Expedia, and others—do not 
have to deploy thousands of travel agents in physical offices across the country but 
can instead concentrate on a single interface with a national consumer audience.

Travel services do not require the kind of expensive multi-channel “physical presence” 
strategy required of financial services (although they generally operate centralized 
call centers to provide personal customer service). Therefore, travel services “scale” 
better, permitting earnings to grow faster than costs. But these efficiencies also make 
it hard for reservation sites to make a profit.
THE ONLINE TRAVEL MARKET
There are four major sectors in the travel market: airline tickets, hotel reservations, 
car rentals, and travel packages. Airline tickets are the source of the greatest amount 
of revenue in online travel. Airline reservations are largely a commodity. They can 
be easily described online. The same is true with car rentals; most people can reliably 
rent a car over the phone or online and expect to obtain what they ordered. Although 
hotels are somewhat more difficult to describe, hotel branding, supplemented by 
Web sites that include descriptions, photographs, and virtual tours, typically provides 
enough information to most consumers to allow them to feel as if they know what they 
are purchasing, making them comfortable enough to make hotel reservations online. 
Travel packages purchased online constituted the smallest percentage of travel sales.
Increasingly, corporations are outsourcing their travel offices entirely to vendors who 
can provide Web-based solutions, high-quality service, and lower costs. Online vendors 
to corporations provide corporate online booking solutions (COBS) that provide 
integrated airline, hotel, conference center, and auto rental services at a single site.
ONLINE TRAVEL INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
Because much of what travel agency sites offer is a commodity, and thus they face the 
same costs, competition among online providers is intense. Price competition is difficult 
because shoppers, as well as online site managers, can comparison shop easily. There-
fore, competition among sites tends to focus on scope of offerings, ease of use, payment 
options, and personalization. Some well-known travel sites are listed in Table 11.7.
The online travel services industry has gone through a period of intense consolida-
tion. Expedia now owns Travelocity, Orbitz, CheapTickets, Hotels.com, Hotwire, and 
meta-search engine Trivago, giving it a 75% market share among U.S. online travel 
agencies. Its primary competition consists of Priceline, which owns Booking.com, 
Lowestfare.com, and Kayak. Together, Expedia and Priceline control a whopping 95% 
of the online travel agency booking market. However, Google is also poised to become 
a player in the market, with its Google Flights and Google Hotel Finder that also pro-
vides booking functionality. The U.S. Department of Justice also cited the TripAdvi-
sor’s introduction of an Instant Booking service as a factor in its approval of Expedia’s 
acquisition of Orbitz. 
In addition to industry consolidation, the online travel industry has been roiled 
by meta-search engines that scour the Web for the best prices on travel and lodging, 
and then collect finder or affiliate fees for sending consumers to the lowest-price sites. 
Travel aggregator sites include Trivago, Kayak, Fly.com, and Mobissimo. These sites, 
in the eyes of many industry leaders, commoditize the online travel industry even 
further, cause excessive price competition, and divert revenues from the leading, 
branded firms who have made extensive investments in inventory and systems.

Mobile devices and apps used for pre-trip planning, booking, check-in, and context 
and location-based destination information are also transforming the online travel indus-
try (see also the case study on Orbitz’s mobile strategy in Chapter 4). For instance, in 
the United States in 2015, about 75 million people are expected to use a mobile device to 
research travel, and that number is estimated to increase to 113 million by 2013. Around 
45 million are expected to actually book travel using a mobile device in 2015, and that 
number is expected to increase to over 75 million people by 2019. Smartphones are used 
slightly more than tablets to both research and book travel (eMarketer, Inc., 2015h, 2015i, 
2015j, 2015k). Most of the major airlines now have apps for a variety of mobile platforms 
to enable flight research, booking, and management. Apps from hotels and car rental 
companies are available from most of the major players such as Hertz and Avis for car 
rentals, and Best Western, Choice Hotels, Hilton, and Starwood for hotels. Apps may 
sometimes target specific consumer behavior. For instance, Expedia reports that 25% of 
its mobile hotel sales are made at properties within 10 miles of the user’s current loca-
tion, indicating that they are searching for and booking rooms on-the-go, as they travel. 
Mobile devices are also proving to be quite popular for booking at the last minute. Marriott 
says that 35% of its smartphone bookings are for same-day travel (eMarketer, Inc., 2014). 
Social media is also having a big impact on the online travel industry. User-gener-
ated content and online reviews are having an increasing influence on travel-buying 
decisions. The Insight on Society story, Phony Reviews, examines some of the issues 
this presents for the industry.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
PHONY REVIEWS
People used to rely on travel agents 
for professional recommendations 
about travel destinations, hotels, and 
restaurants to choose while on vaca-
tion. Today, however, sites like TripAdvi-
sor and Yelp have taken over that function. 
Trip­Advisor has been a smashing success, with more 
than 100 million user-generated reviews, $1 billion 
in revenue, and 60 million members. Yelp has 70 
million reviews of restaurants and other services, 
and a market capitalization of $4 billion. The sites 
have become trusted sources for travelers as they 
try to decide where to travel, what hotels to book, 
and where to eat. A good rating can be worth 
thousands of dollars in bookings. But are all those 
reviews for real? Can they be trusted? 
Although the majority of reviews on TripAdvisor, 
Yelp, and related sites are probably trustworthy and 
88% of users trust online reviews, fraudulent reviews 
are commonplace. Hotels pay people to create false 
identities and post favorable reviews on their proper-
ties, a practice known as “astroturfing,” and also to 
slam competing venues. In 2013, astroturfing began 
to draw attention from the legal system, including 
the New York State Attorney General’s office, which 
began cracking down on astroturfing by businesses 
giving themselves or paying for positive reviews, and 
a Virginia court, which ruled in 2014 that anony-
mous reviews aren’t protected by the First Amend-
ment unless the reviewer was a customer.
Astroturfing is just one of several types of 
problems with online reviews. A disgruntled con-
sumer with an axe to grind can do a lot of damage 
on online review sites. For instance, Dancing Deer 
Mountain, a small wedding venue in Junction City, 
Oregon, had steady business until one wedding went 
horribly wrong. The proprietors said that rules about 
bringing in outside alcohol were broken; the situ-
ation with the wedding-goers purportedly became 
combative as a result. Afterwards, scathing online 
reviews were posted. As a result, business dropped 
off precipitously. The owners tried suing the review-
ers but lost under Oregon law that protects free 
speech. 
Businesses can also damage their reputations 
by mishandling bad reviews, phony or otherwise. 
An Arizona bakery went viral in 2013 after an 
unflattering appearance on a reality show drew 
negative social media attention. The bakery’s owners 
used Facebook, Yelp, and Reddit to make personal 
attacks against anyone who had posted a negative 
review and quickly gained unwanted notoriety. In 
2014, a British hotel fined two guests after they 
made a scathing review on TripAdvisor, but after 
local media scrutiny, the hotel refunded the money 
and vowed to improve its services. 
For sites such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, the 
growth in phony reviews presents a considerable 
challenge. The authenticity and accuracy of reviews 
are critically important to their success, but garner-
ing a high review score is equally important to the 
businesses listed on the site. Studies have found that 
if a business can increase its Yelp rating by one star, 
its revenues will increase anywhere from 5% to 
9%, and in March 2014, an industry study found 
that small businesses using Yelp experienced annual 
revenue increases of $8,000. This gives businesses 
ample incentive to post phony reviews praising their 
own business and slamming their competitors. A 
2013 study concluded that approximately 16% 
of Yelp reviews are fraudulent. With this in mind, 
Yelp continues to develop ways to remove suspect 
reviews, including those from rings of businesses 
who work together to fraudulently increase the 
ratings of each business in the group. Yelp has also 
developed its own filtering algorithms, which are 
intended to detect phony reviews. 
To help business battle phony reviews, Yelp 
has also introduced Consumer Alerts, which inform 
readers when a review is likely to be fraudulent. The 

	
O n l i n e  T r a v e l  S e r v i c e s 	

771
alerts are generated via an algorithm that monitors 
the site for suspicious posting patterns. While this 
helps to combat phony reviews, it also increases 
the risk that legitimate positive reviews will be 
flagged and removed, hurting both the reputation 
of the business and the reputation of the review. 
Since then, Yelp has released additional rounds of 
Consumer Alerts for over 150 businesses. Still, this 
is only a fraction of the total number of businesses 
likely committing fraud on Yelp.
TripAdvisor also claims it uses an algorithm 
to help filter out false reviews, although it rejects 
requiring would-be reviewers to supply a reserva-
tion number in order to prove that they have actu-
ally stayed at the property that they are reviewing. 
According to TripAdvisor, it takes the authentic-
ity of its reviews very seriously, and has numer-
ous methods to ensure their legitimacy, including 
automated site tools and a team of review integrity 
experts. It also relies on the review community itself 
to identify suspicious content and trolls the sites 
where businesses advertise for fake reviewers. But 
TripAdvisor has been fined multiple times by regula-
tory agencies for misrepresenting the authenticity 
of its reviews, including $610,000 in Italy in 2014 
and $484,000 in France in 2011.
In 2015, researchers from Harvard Business 
School have mined and analyzed reviews from 
these sites to get a better understanding of what 
makes a review suspicious. Truthful reviewers tend 
to talk about specific details, while the fraudulent 
reviewers, not surprisingly, tended to talk more 
about themselves, reasons for the trip, and travel-
ing companions, lacking actual experience 
with the venue. Positive review fraud is driven 
by sudden dips in reputation, and negative review 
fraud is driven by changing patterns in competition, 
like a new restaurant in the area. Most fraudulent 
reviews are either one or five stars, with very few 
in between, and fraudulent reviews of chain res-
taurants are very rare, since these companies are 
likelier to have sophisticated marketing and brand-
ing efforts that go well beyond online review sites. 
Will this improved understanding of fraudulent 
reviews clean up TripAdvisor and Yelp once and for 
all? Probably not. But review sites and regulators 
are cracking down on phony reviews with increasing 
vigor. In 2013, for instance, 19 companies received 
fines from New York regulators totaling $350,000 
for buying and selling fraudulent reviews, and in 
2015 Yelp sued a company operating multiple 
businesses involved in selling fraudulent reviews to 
restaurants. To complicate matters further, a new 
competitor named TripExpert has also entered 
the fray, using aggregated scores from a variety of 
sources instead of customer reviews. The site claims 
that this will avoid many of the pitfalls of fraudu-
lent user reviews. However, it might be the case that 
TripAdvisor and Yelp are actually improving service 
at hotels and restaurants. In Ireland, for example, 
reviews of hotels improved from 3.6 to 3.8 in 2014, 
but this was attributable to corresponding improve-
ments in service, not fraud. The best approach is 
still to take what you read with a grain of salt, 
discarding both the overwhelmingly positive and 
the unrelentingly negative reviews.

	11.7	 ONLINE CAREER SERVICES
Next to travel services, one of the Internet’s most successful online services has been 
job services (recruitment sites) that provide a free posting of individual resumes, plus 
many other related career services; for a fee, they also list job openings posted by 
companies. Career services sites collect revenue from other sources as well, by provid-
ing value-added services to users and collecting fees from related service providers. 
The U.S. online job market is dominated by two large players: Monster, with 
about 9 million unique monthly visitors, and CareerBuilder, with about 5 million. Job 
listing aggregators, such as Indeed (22 million unique visitors), Glassdoor (12 million), 
and and SimplyHired (4 million) are also very popular. LinkedIn and Viadeo (see the 
opening case in Chapter 10) have also become increasingly important players in this 
market.
Traditionally, companies have relied on five employee recruitment tools: classified 
and print advertising, career expos (or trade shows), on-campus recruiting, private 
employment agencies (now called “staffing firms”), and internal referral programs. 
In comparison to online recruiting, these tools have severe limitations. Print adver-
tising usually includes a per-word charge that limits the amount of detail employers 
provide about a job opening, as well as a limited time period within which the job is 
posted. Career expos do not allow for pre-screening of attendees and are limited by the 
amount of time a recruiter can spend with each candidate. Staffing firms charge high 
fees and have a limited, usually local, selection of job hunters. On-campus recruiting 
also restricts the number of candidates a recruiter can speak with during a normal visit 
and requires that employers visit numerous campuses. And internal referral programs 
may encourage employees to propose unqualified candidates for openings in order to 
qualify for rewards or incentives offered.
Online recruiting overcomes these limitations, providing a more efficient and 
cost-effective means of linking employers and potential employees, while reducing the 
total time to hire. Online recruiting enables job hunters to more easily build, update, 
and distribute their resumes while gathering information about prospective employers 
and conducting job searches.
IT’S JUST INFORMATION: THE IDEAL WEB BUSINESS?
Online recruitment is ideally suited for the Web. The hiring process is an information-
intense business process that involves discovering the skills and salary requirements of 
individuals and matching them with available jobs. In order to accomplish this matchup, 
there does not initially need to be face-to-face interaction, or a great deal of personal-
ization. Prior to the Internet, this information sharing was accomplished locally by 
human networks of friends, acquaintances, former employers, and relatives, in addition 
to employment agencies that developed paper files on job hunters. The Internet can 
clearly automate this flow of information, reducing search time and costs for all parties. 
Table 11.8 lists some of the most popular recruitment sites.
Why are so many job hunters and employers using Internet job sites? Recruitment 
sites are popular largely because they save time and money for both job hunters and 

	
O n l i n e  C a r e e r  S e r v i c e s 	

773
employers seeking recruits. For employers, the job boards expand the geographical 
reach of their searches, lower costs, and result in faster hiring decisions.
For job seekers, online sites are popular not only because their resumes can 
be made widely available to recruiters but also because of a variety of other related 
job-hunting services. The services delivered by online recruitment sites have greatly 
expanded since their emergence in 1996. Originally, online recruitment sites just 
provided a digital version of newspaper classified ads. Today’s sites offer many other 
services, including skills assessment, personality assessment questionnaires, person-
alized account management for job hunters, organizational culture assessments, job 
search tools, employer blocking (prevents your employer from seeing your posting),

employee blocking (prevents your employees from seeing your listings if you are their 
employer), and e-mail notification. Online sites also provide a number of educational 
services such as resume writing advice, software skills preparation, and interview tips.
For the most part, online recruitment sites work, in the sense of linking job 
hunters with jobs, but they are just one of many ways people actually find jobs. A 
survey by The Conference Board found that the majority (70%) of job seekers rely 
equally on both the Internet and newspapers to look for jobs, with about half relying 
on word-of-mouth leads, and about a quarter on employment agencies. Given that the 
cost of posting a resume online is zero, the marginal returns are very high. 
The ease with which resumes can be posted online has also raised new issues for 
both job recruiters and job seekers. If you are an employer, how do you sort through 
the thousands of resumes you may receive when posting an open job? If you are a job 
seeker, how do you stand out among the thousands or even millions of others? Perhaps 
one way is to post a video resume. In a survey by Vault, nearly nine in 10 employers 
said they would watch a video resume if it were submitted to them, in part because it 
would help them better assess a candidate’s professional presentation and demeanor, 
and over half said they believed video would become a common addition to future 
job applications. CareerBuilder became the first major online job site to implement a 
video resume tool for job candidates, following a previous launch for an online video 
brand-building tool for employers.
Perhaps one of the most important functions of online recruitment sites is not so 
much their capacity to actually match employers with job hunters but their ability to 
establish market prices and terms, as well as trends in the labor market. Online recruit-
ment sites identify salary levels for both employers and job hunters and categorize the 
skill sets required to achieve those salary levels. In this sense, online recruitment sites 
are online national marketplaces that establish the terms of trade in labor markets. 
The existence of online national job sites should lead to a rationalization of wages, 
greater labor mobility, and higher efficiency in recruitment and operations because 
employers will be able to quickly find the people they need.
ONLINE RECRUITMENT INDUSTRY TRENDS
Trends for 2015–2016 in the online recruitment services industry include the following:
•	 Social recruiting: According to a recent survey of over 1,400 recruiters and human 
resource professionals, 92% use social recruiting, with LinkedIn being a primary 
resource (Jobvite, 2015). LinkedIn, probably the most well-known business-oriented 
social network, has grown significantly to over 380 million members representing 
over 170 different industries in over 200 countries as of September 2015. LinkedIn’s 
corporate hiring solutions are used by over 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, and 
more than 3 million companies have a LinkedIn page. Consumers are using sites 
such as LinkedIn to establish business contacts and networks. For instance, accord-
ing to LinkedIn, its members do almost 6 billion professionally-oriented searches 
on LinkedIn a year. Employers are also using LinkedIn to conduct searches to find 
potential job candidates that may not be actively job hunting. For instance, LinkedIn 
offers companies a feature called LinkedIn Talent Solutions that includes tools that 

	
O n - d e m a n d  S e r v i c e  C o m p a n i e s 	

775
help corporate recruiters find “passive talent” (people who are not actively looking 
for a new job), as well as custom company profiles that are specifically designed 
for recruitment. According to LinkedIn Talent Solutions, U.S. company reliance on 
social recruiting to find quality employees has increased by over 50% since 2011, 
with 46% of those surveyed indicating that social recruiting was the most important 
source for key positions (LinkedIn Talent Solutions, 2015). Social network sites are 
also being used by employers to “check up” on the background of job candidates. A 
study by Harris Interactive of over 2,000 managers and human resource employees 
found that over 50% are using social networks to screen job candidates, and almost 
50% have rejected candidates because of content on a social site. Employers typi-
cally search Facebook, Twitter, and Linked­In. Provocative or inappropriate photos 
were the biggest negative factor followed by drinking and drug references. However, 
on the flip side, recruiters also noted that not having any online presence at all also 
hurts candidates, with more than a third indicating that they would be less likely to 
interview a job candidate if they cannot find information about that person online 
(Careerbuilder, 2015). 
•	 Mobile: As with other forms of services, career services firms have also moved onto 
the mobile platform. A recent survey found that mobile devices were the primary 
devices used by Millennials and Gen X to search for jobs (eMarketer, Inc., 2015l). 
To reach this audience, CareerBuilder, Monster, LinkedIn, and most of the other 
major sites all have a mobile Web site, as well as apps that allow job seekers to create 
and upload resumes, search jobs by keyword, location, and company, e-mail jobs, 
browse and apply, and more. LinkedIn’s app, for instance, can also recommend 
jobs based on data you provide on your profile page. In 2015, mobile accounts for 
52% of the unique members visiting LinkedIn. 
•	 Job search engines/aggregators: As with travel services, search engines that 
focus specifically on jobs are posing a new threat to established online career sites. 
For instance, Indeed, SimplyHired, and Us.jobs “scrape” listings from thousands of 
online job sites such as Monster, CareerBuilder, specialty recruiting services, and 
the sites of individual employers to provide a free, searchable index of thousands 
of job listings in one spot. Because these firms do not charge employers a listing 
fee, they are currently using a pay-per-click or other advertising revenue model.
•	 Data analytics and algorithms: Companies are increasingly using Big Data tech-
nologies in the hiring process, as well as adaptive algorithms that help them match 
job seekers to job openings. 
•	 Hiring by algorithm: Companies are increasingly using algorithms to sift online 
job applications, focusing on key words to match job seekers with jobs.
	11.8	 ON-DEMAND SERVICE COMPANIES
On-demand service companies provide a platform that enables the on-demand deliv-
ery of various services, by connecting providers (“sellers”) who wish to exploit their 
“spare” resources, such as cars, rooms with beds, and ability to perform various services

via their personal labor, with consumers (“buyers”) who would like to utilize those 
resources and services. Other common phrases sometimes used to describe these 
online businesses are “sharing economy,” “collaborative commerce,” “peer to peer 
consumption,” “mesh economy,” and “we-commerce.” However, unlike traditional 
sharing where there is no fee charged in the transaction, these firms collect a fee 
from both sellers and buyers for using their platforms (Rosenberg, 2013). In the 
last few years, hundreds of startups, funded by over $26 billion in venture capital, 
have created a plethora of such platforms that allow owners of resources that are 
underutilized to sell access to those resources to consumers who would prefer not 
to, or are unable to, buy those resources themselves (Needleman and Loten, 2014; 
Friedman, 2014).
A number of these on-demand service firms have grown exponentially over the 
last five years. Table 11.9 describes just a few of the hundreds of firms whose busi-
ness model is to provide transaction platforms that enable the on-demand delivery of 
various services. See the Insight on Business case, Airbnb Takes Off, for a look at two of 
these companies focused on the delivery of food on demand. 
Collaborative commerce, trading platforms, and peer-to-peer commerce are not 
new. While eBay involves the sale of items at auction or for fixed prices, on-demand 
service firms provide sell access to cars, room, spaces, and even skilled people. What 
is new about these firms is their use of mobile and Internet technology to enable 
transactions on their platforms. This is especially true of the car and lodging services 
where transactions are local and mobile. Second, the growth of these firms is supported 
by the use of online reputation systems based on peer review, to establish a trusted 
environment where sellers and consumers can feel confident transacting with one 
another. Online peer review of both the providers and the consumers helps to ensure 
that both parties have acceptable reputations, and that a high quality of service is pro-
vided. These firms have learned from eBay and Netflix the importance of peer reviews

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
AIRBNB TAKES OFF 
Wouldn’t it be nice if every time you 
went on vacation, you could make 
a little extra money by renting your 
apartment to responsible tenants? 
Or if you had a second property that 
you could use to make a little extra money 
without having to make six-month or year-long 
sublet agreements? And wouldn’t it be even better 
if every time you traveled somewhere, you could 
find one of these types of apartments for yourself 
for a deep discount compared to area hotels? This 
is the inefficiency that short-term C2C real estate 
rental companies such as Airbnb, Wimdu, and a 
host of others have attempted to solve with the aid 
of the new mobile platform. So far, these fledgling 
“private accommodation service” companies are 
still finding their footing with regard to profits and 
losses, but the industry has grown steadily since 
Airbnb’s founding in 2008.
Airbnb is regarded as the biggest player in this 
emerging field, but it does have some competition. 
One such competitor is Wimdu. Funded by Rocket 
Internet and the Samwer brothers (see Rocket 
Internet, the Chapter 1 Insight on Business case), 
Wimdu is very closely modeled after Airbnb, but 
tailors its business tactics from country to country. 
Travelers log onto Wimdu, type in their destination 
and specify their travel dates, and site filters display 
locations that meet those criteria. Currently, trav-
elers can choose from over 300,000 properties in 
over 150 countries worldwide. Its portal is available 
in 15 different languages. Users can add places to 
their “favorites” list and submit reviews of hosts 
and properties. Wimdu also offers insurance against 
damages to properties of up to €500,000 and offers 
travelers free customer service. Wimdu and 9flats, 
another European-based C2C rental company, have 
both struggled to show profits in the early going. 
Wimdu, in particular, has raised almost $100 million 
in an effort to grow its user base rapidly (currently 
totaling over 1 million registered users) and reach 
profitability, but they have not reached that point 
yet. However, Wimdu posted a 34% increase in 
revenue in the first quarter of 2015, approaching 
€100 million in sales for the first time and validating 
the company’s projections of profitability by 2016. 
Potential challenges to the business model include 
preventing guests from damaging apartments and 
challenges from local and national governments, as 
will be subsequently discussed.
With many clone companies like Wimdu, the 
end goal is to sell the business to the established 
leader, which in this case is Airbnb. Although 
Airbnb founder Brian Chesky admitted coming 
close to purchasing Wimdu in 2011, the company 
ultimately decided against it, reportedly due to 
concerns about Wimdu’s business culture and 
operating style. To date, Airbnb has continued 
to spurn Wimdu and has instead opted to enter 
the German market and compete directly against 
Wimdu. Airbnb is valued at an astronomical $25 
billion, operates in 34,000 cities in 190 countries, 
and raised almost $1.5 billion in venture funding 
in 2015. Its eventual initial public offering is highly 
anticipated, but it registered approximately $200 
million in losses in 2015 and is determined to 
improve its bottom line before going public.
Wimdu’s management has focused on increas-
ing Wimdu’s selection of properties rather than 
simply pursuing profitability as fast as possible. 
Wimdu has been recognized by media outlets for 
its superior customer marketing. Also, because 
the private accommodation services are business 
platforms more than a social network, the existing 
power of Airbnb is not an insurmountable obstacle 
for Wimdu, 9flats, and other European-based C2C 
real estate rental companies, such as Homeaway 
and HouseTrip.

C H A P T E R  1 1     E - c o m m e r c e  R e t a i l i n g  a n d  S e r v i c e s
Perhaps the biggest current problem 
for the private accommodation service indus-
try is governmental interference. Both local 
and national governments are cracking down on 
short-term rental services, which enable tenants 
to elude restrictions that would preclude them 
from securing permanent housing. In Singapore, 
law enforcement is imposing stiff penalties on 
any homeowner renting their home via these 
services. The minimum subletting period is six 
months. This only applies if money is exchanged. 
Homeowners can allow friends and relatives to 
stay over. Berlin is another city that has decided 
to regulate short-term holiday rentals, hoping to 
curb the notable increase in the cost of living and 
scarcity of affordable apartments available for 
rent in the city dating back to 2007. Munich and 
Hamburg already have similar laws.
In Amsterdam, where individuals are 
allowed to rent out their property only if they 
follow certain regulations, the city government 
has used Airbnb and its competitors to investi-
gate illegal rental properties by combining its 
own data with listings. An initial government 
scan found that about 700 of the almost 4,000 
listings on Airbnb were illegal hotels. The govern-
ment also believes that Airbnb and similar busi-
nesses fail to comply with local tax legislation. 
Airbnb contends that it is simply a marketplace, 
and that its users are the ones responsible for 
complying with local laws.
New York City and San Francisco are two 
major U.S. battlegrounds for Airbnb. New York 
City regulations curtail hosts’ ability to rent their 
apartments on services like Airbnb. C2C rental 
companies counter that their services don’t con-
tribute to increases in costs of living, and that 
outdated laws need to be changed. A 2014 report 
by the New York City Attorney General indicated 
that three quarters of Airbnb listings in the city 
are illegal, and the city continues to push back 
at Airbnb’s attempts to partner with them over 
reforming housing laws. However, in 2015, Airbnb 
defeated a measure to regulate short-term home 
rentals in San Francisco, which set a precedent 
that may extend to New York City. For its part, 
Airbnb has created a task force to become more 
transparent with its data when dealing with gov-
ernments and regulatory agencies but has still 
resisted giving up information on renters who 
have listed rooms illegally. In the same vein, 
9flats, Wimdu, and HouseTrip, another Swiss-
based rental service, have formed a network to 
lobby European governments with a unified voice 
as these services become a more important part 
of the tourism industry there. Airbnb is not a part 
of that group, which is perhaps an effort by the 
European-based companies to compete together 
against a common enemy. The European network 
hopes to support tenants and landlords with legal 
matters and participate in creating regulations 
and developing solutions to current issues. Still, 
Airbnb, Wimdu, and their counterparts are united 
in their desire to see C2C short-term home rental 
become commonplace, and there are signs that it 
just might happen.

and ratings. A third factor is that successful firms lower the cost of services like urban 
transportation, lodging, office space, and personal errand services. Firms that can do 
this are highly disruptive of existing firms and business models. 
Uber and Airbnb are among the most successful and well-known on-demand 
service companies. See the opening case in Chapter 1 for a description of Uber and 
an in-depth discussion of the issues that this business model raises. 
Airbnb was founded in 2008 as a way to find lodging for attendees at a business 
convention. Since then, Airbnb has expanded to the entire lodging marketplace, and 
has grown exponentially. Airbnb now operates in more than 34,000 cities in 190 
countries, and lists over 1.5 million properties for rent, including 1,400 castles and 
dozens of yurts in Mongolia. In the seven years since its founding, Airbnb has grown 
to be larger than the Intercontinental, the world’s largest private hotel chain, which 
has about 4,900 hotels, and about 725,000 rooms around the world. 
Through October 2015, Airbnb has raised $2.29 billion and has a current valuation 
of over $25 billion. People with spaces to rent, which can range from a single sofa to an 
entire apartment or house, create an account and a profile, and then list their proper-
ties on the site. The amount charged depends on the host and is usually based on the 
host’s assessment of similar listings nearby and market demand. Travelers seeking to 
rent spaces register and create an account, which includes a profile. They then consult 
the Web site listings, read reviews of the host, and contact the host to arrange for the 
rental. After the rental period, hosts rate their renters, and vice versa. Renters pay 
through their Airbnb account, which must be funded by a credit card. Airbnb charges 
guests a sliding fee of 6% to 12%, depending on the price of the booking, and charges 
the host 3%. The hosts are issued a 1099 form at the end of the year to report taxes 
due on the income. 
Uber and Airbnb stand out not only as the most successful of on-demand service 
firms, but also as the most disruptive and controversial. For instance, with Airbnb, 
property renters do not have the regulatory or tax burdens that hotel owners have. It 
is possible that the success of Airbnb could greatly reduce the demand for regulated 
hotels. There is little research on this topic, but an early paper found that Airbnb had 
a small impact on rental income at lower-end tourist hotels, but little empirical impact 
on business traveler hotels (Zervas et al., 2015). The possibility of negative outcomes 
from transactions with these companies (e.g., a driver robs or harms a passenger, or 
an apartment is destroyed by renters) is leading both firms to require liability insur-
ance, or to offer such insurance for free. It is unlikely that on-demand service firms 
will escape regulation altogether, but due to their popularity and success, it is likely 
that regulation will be minimal.

Your Reservation Is Waiting

penTable is the leading supplier of reservation, table management, and 
guest management software for restaurants. In addition, the company 
operates OpenTable.com, the world’s most popular Web site for making 
restaurant reservations online. In just over 15 years, OpenTable has 
gone from a start-up to a successful and growing public company that counts around 
two-thirds of the nation’s reservation-taking restaurants as clients. 
Today, more than 32,000 restaurants in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the 
United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan use the OpenTable hardware and software 
system. This system automates the reservation-taking and table management process, 
while allowing restaurants to build diner databases for improved guest recognition 
and targeted e-mail marketing. The OpenTable Web site, mobile site, and mobile app 
provide a fast, efficient way for diners to find available tables in real time. The Web 
sites and app connect directly to the thousands of computerized reservation systems 
at OpenTable restaurants, and reservations are immediately recorded in a restaurant’s 
electronic reservation book.

Restaurants subscribe to the OpenTable Electronic Reservation Book (ERB), the 
company’s proprietary software, which is installed on a touch-screen computer system 
and supported by asset-protection and security tools. The ERB software provides a 
real-time map of the restaurant floor and enables the restaurant to retain meal pat-
terns of all parties, serving as a customer relationship management (CRM) system for 
restaurants. The software is upgraded periodically, and the latest version is designed 
to provide increased ease of use and a more thorough view of table availability to help 
turn more tables, enhance guest service, personalize responses to diners, coordinate 
the seating process, and maximize guest seating. The ERBs at OpenTable’s customer 
restaurants connect via the Internet to form an online network of restaurant reserva-
tion books. 
OpenTable’s revenue comes from two sources. Restaurants pay a one-time fee for 
on-site installation and training, a monthly subscription fee for software and hardware, 
and a transaction fee for each restaurant guest seated through online reservations. The 
online reservation service is free to diners. The business model encourages diners to 
assist in viral marketing. When an individual makes a reservation, the site “suggests” 
that they send invites to their dinner companions directly from OpenTable that include 
a link back to the OpenTable site.
OpenTable is a service-based (software as service, or SaaS) e-commerce company. 
In other words, customers don’t buy software and install it on their computers, but 
instead go online and get the software functionality through subscriptions. Open­Table 
is also an online service that does not sell goods, but instead enables diners to make 
reservations, like social networking sites provide services.
The restaurant industry was slow to leverage the power of the Internet. This 
was in part because the industry was, and continues to be, highly fragmented and 
local—made up of more than 30,000 small, independent businesses or local restaurant-
owning groups.
The founders of OpenTable knew that dealing with these restaurants as a single 
market would be difficult. They also realized that the Internet was changing things for 
diners by providing them with instant access to reviews, menus, and other information 
about dining options. And there was no method for making reservations online—we 
all know reserving by phone is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. In 
order to make the system work, reach and scale were very important. For diners to use 
an online reservation system, they would need real-time access to a number of local 
restaurants, and the ability to instantly book confirmed reservations around the clock. 
If customers were planning a trip to another city, OpenTable would need participating 
restaurants in those cities.
The company was originally incorporated in San Francisco in 1998 as Easy­
eats.com, morphing into OpenTable.com, Inc. a year later. When the company was 
founded, most restaurants did not have computers, let alone systems that would allow 
online reservations made through a central Web site. OpenTable’s initial strategy was 
to pay online restaurant reviewers for links to its Web site and target national chains 
in order to quickly expand its reach. This got the company into 50 cities, but it was 
spending $1 million a month and bringing in only $100,000 in revenue. Not exactly a

formula for success. The original investors still felt there was a viable business to be 
built, and they made a number of management changes, including installing investor 
and board member Thomas Layton, founder of CitySearch.com, as OpenTable’s CEO. 
Layton cut staff, shut down marketing efforts, and got the company out of all but four 
cities: Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
The company retooled its hardware and software to create the user-friendly ERB 
system and deployed a door-to-door sales force to solicit subscriptions from high-end 
restaurants. The combination of e-commerce, user-friendly technology, and the per-
sonal touch worked. The four markets OpenTable targeted initially developed into 
active, local networks of restaurants and diners that continue to grow. OpenTable has 
implemented the same strategy across the country, and now includes approximately 
32,000 OpenTable restaurant customers. In 17 years, the company has seated approxi-
mately 885 million diners, including 245 million via its mobile solutions, and it is 
currently averaging 17 million diners per month. In the second quarter of 2015, half 
of its seating requests in North America originated from a mobile device.
As the company grew, investors began making plans for it to go public. Layton 
stepped down from his position as CEO in 2007, though he remained a board member. 
He was replaced by Jeffrey Jordan, former president of PayPal. Jordan had some expe-
rience with public companies from working with eBay on its acquisition of PayPal. In 
2009, he chose an aggressive strategy—going ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) 
despite a terrible economy and worse financial markets. The gamble paid off. On its 
first day of trading, OpenTable’s shares climbed 59% and the share price climbed to 
over $100 in 2013, more than five times the $20 IPO price.
Despite the challenging economy, OpenTable’s numbers at the time of the IPO 
were strong, and since then, it has continued to grow. In 2014, Priceline announced 
that it would acquire OpenTable for $2.6 billion. Priceline had long been rumored 
to be interested in OpenTable. OpenTable will benefit from Priceline’s global reach 
as it continues to expand its business beyond the United States, which has thus far 
accounted for about 80% of its revenues. Priceline has a strong track record of suc-
cessful acquisitions, including Booking.com, which propelled Priceline’s revenue from 
the millions to the billions. Clearly, Priceline believes OpenTable can help it grow 
even further, this time into restaurant reservations. They might be right: OpenTable 
is well-positioned for future growth. Its size, track record of growth, and high cus-
tomer satisfaction rates should continue to work in its favor. Priceline plans to allow 
OpenTable to operate autonomously. 
The company has benefited from having e-commerce revenue streams from 
subscription fees and per-transaction charges, rather than depending on advertising. 
Further, more than 50% of OpenTable’s revenue comes from B2B subscriptions, which 
are typically part of long-term contracts. Restaurants that have invested in OpenTable’s 
software package are less likely to want to incur the switching costs associated with 
changing to a different reservation management package.
Another reason for its success is that OpenTable has a large number of satis-
fied customers. Restaurant owners report that they and their staff members find the 
software easy to use, and it helps them manage their business better. Specifically, it 
streamlines operations, helps fill additional seats, and improves quality of service,

providing a concrete return on investment. This has led to both high customer satis-
faction and high retention rates.
OpenTable has also taken advantage of the interconnected needs of restaurants 
and diners. Restaurants want cost-effective ways to attract guests and manage their 
reservations, while diners want convenient ways to find available restaurants, choose 
among them, and make reservations. By creating an online network of restaurants 
and diners that transact with each other through real-time reservations, OpenTable 
has figured out how to successfully address the needs of both.
OpenTable’s market exhibits network effects: the more people use it, the more 
utility the system delivers. More diners discover the benefits of using the online reser-
vation system, which in turn delivers value to restaurant customers, and helps attract 
more restaurants to the network. 
While OpenTable is the biggest, most successful online player in the restaurant 
reservations market, it does have competitors. MenuPages offers access to restau-
rant menus and reviews, but visitors to the site can’t make reservations, and the site 
covers only eight U.S. cities. In 2012, OpenTable partnered with onetime competitor 
Urbanspoon, acquiring its reservation management system, Rezbook, and becoming 
Urbanspoon’s reservation provider. Looming on the horizon is Google, which purchased 
online restaurant guide Zagat in September 2011, raising the specter that it might try 
to compete with OpenTable, although Zagat does not yet possess that functionality. 
Competitors in other countries where OpenTable does not yet operate, such as Restalo 
in Spain and Italy, and in markets like casual dining, such as NoWait, represent chal-
lenges to OpenTable. India-based startup Zomato acquired U.S.-based NexTable in 2015, 
adding another challenger to the mix.
The company is committed to shrewd technological investments to advance its 
position. It has a mobile Web site, mobile applications that work on just about every 
smartphone platform, and an iPad app that fully integrates with its ERB software. 
GPS enables mobile users to locate and make reservations at nearby venues. In 2015, 
OpenTable launched a version of its app for Apple Watch that reminds diners of their 
reservations, provides directions, and shows a countdown. It is also testing a premium 
service that involves paying for an additional fee for last-minute, prime-time reserva-
tions at popular restaurants, using a surge pricing algorithm similar to that used by 
Uber.
OpenTable is attempting to shift its relationship with both diners and restaurants 
from a “transactional” relationship to an “experiential” relationship, which focuses on 
the experience of dining. OpenTable launched a payments feature that allows users 
to pay for meals completely within the OpenTable app on the iPhone, and in 2015 
made this feature available for Android phones as well. Although a small number of 
restaurants currently offer the service, OpenTable is partnering with other mobile 
payment systems like Aloha to widen their mobile payment availability. OpenTable 
also redesigned its flagship Web site in 2014 to improve visual appeal and speed, and 
continued to update its image in 2015 with a complete rebranding, including a new 
logo and tagline and a marketing campaign, 100 Open Tables, featuring giveaways of 
iconic dining experiences around the world.

OpenTable’s growth is projected to continue in the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico despite considerable market penetration. Selective international expansion is 
planned beyond its current operations in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. 
OpenTable supports each of these locations with a direct sales force servicing approxi-
mately 1,000 restaurants.
The company’s international strategy is to replicate the successful U.S. model 
by focusing initially on building a restaurant customer base. OpenTable believes the 
localized versions of its software will compare favorably against competitive software 
offerings, enabling them to expand across a broad selection of local restaurants.

	11.10	 REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the environment in which the online retail sector operates today.
•	
The retail industry can be divided into seven major firm types: general merchandise, durable goods, spe-
cialty stores, food and beverage, gasoline and fuel, MOTO, and online retail firms. Each type offers oppor-
tunities for online retail. The MOTO sector is the most similar to the online retail sales sector.
•	
During the early days of e-commerce, some predicted that the retail industry would be revolutionized, 
based on reduced search costs, lower marketing entry costs, the replacement of physical store merchants 
by online companies, elimination of middlemen (distintermediation), and hypermediation.
•	
Today, it has become clear that few of the initial assumptions about the future of online retail were cor-
rect. Also, the structure of the retail marketplace in the United States has not been revolutionized. The 
reality is that:
•	
Online consumers are not primarily cost-driven—instead, they are as brand-driven and influenced 
by perceived value as their offline counterparts.
•	
Online market entry costs were underestimated, as was the cost of acquiring new customers.
•	
Older traditional firms, such as the general merchandising giants and the established catalog-based 
retailers, are taking over as the top online retail sites.
•	
Disintermediation did not occur. On the contrary, online retailing has become an example of the 
powerful role that intermediaries play in retail trade.

Explain how to analyze the economic viability of an online firm.
•	
The economic viability, or ability of a firm to survive during a specified time period, can be analyzed by 
examining the key industry strategic factors, the strategic factors that pertain specifically to the firm, and 
the financial statements for the firm. 
•	
The key industry strategic factors include barriers to entry, the power of suppliers, the power of custom-
ers, the existence of substitute products, the industry value chain, and the nature of intra-industry com-
petition.
•	
The key firm strategic factors include the firm value chain, core competencies, synergies, the firm’s cur-
rent technology, and the social and legal challenges facing the firm.
•	
The key financial factors include revenues, cost of sales, gross margin, operating expenses, operating 
margin, net margin, and the firm’s balance sheet.
Identify the challenges faced by the different types of online retailers.
•	
Virtual merchants are single-channel Web firms that generate all of their revenues from online sales. Their 
challenges include building a business and a brand name quickly, many competitors in the virtual mar-
ketplace, substantial costs to build and maintain an e-commerce presence, considerable marketing 
expenses, large customer acquisition costs, a steep learning curve, and the need to quickly achieve oper-
ating efficiencies in order to preserve a profit. Amazon is the most well-known example of a virtual mer-
chant.
•	
Omni-channel merchants (bricks-and-clicks) have a network of physical stores as their primary retail chan-
nel, but also have online operations. Their challenges include high cost of physical buildings, high cost of 
large sales staffs, the need to coordinate prices across channels, the need to develop methods of handling 
cross-channel returns from multiple locations, building a credible e-commerce presence, hiring new 
skilled staff, and building rapid-response order entry and fulfillment systems. Macy’s is an example of a 
bricks-and-clicks company.
•	
Catalog merchants are established companies that have a national offline catalog operation as their largest 
retail channel, but who also have online capabilities. Their challenges include high costs for printing and 
mailing, the need to leverage their existing assets and competencies to the new technology environment, 
the need to develop methods of handling cross-channel returns, building a e-commerce presence, and 
hiring new skilled staff. Lands’ End is an example of a catalog merchant.
•	
Manufacturer-direct merchants are either single- or multi-channel manufacturers who sell to consumers 
directly online without the intervention of retailers. Their challenges include channel conflict, quickly 
developing a rapid-response online order and fulfillment system; switching from a supply-push (products 
are made prior to orders being received based on estimated demand) to a demand-pull model (products 
are not built until an order is received); and creating sales, service, and support operations online. Dell is 
an example of a manufacturer-direct merchant.
Describe the major features of the online service sector.
•	
The service sector is the largest and most rapidly expanding part of the economy of advanced industrial 
nations. 
•	
The major service industry groups are financial services, insurance, real estate, business services, and 
health services. 
•	
Within these service industry groups, companies can be further categorized into those that involve trans-
action brokering and those that involve providing a “hands-on” service. 
•	
With some exceptions, the service sector is by and large a knowledge- and information-intense industry. 
For this reason, many services are uniquely suited to e-commerce and the strengths of the Internet.

•	
E-commerce offers extraordinary opportunities to improve transaction efficiencies and thus productivity 
in a sector where productivity has so far not been markedly affected by the explosion in information 
technology.
Discuss the trends taking place in the online financial services industry.
•	
The online financial services sector is a good example of an e-commerce success story, but the success is 
somewhat different than what had been predicted in the early days of e-commerce. Today, the multi-
channel established financial firms are growing the most rapidly and have the best prospects for long-
term viability. 
•	
Multi-channel firms that have both physical branches and solid online offerings have assumed market 
leadership over pure-online firms.
•	
Financial portals provide comparison shopping services and steer consumers to online providers for inde-
pendent financial advice and financial planning.
•	
Account aggregation is another rapidly growing online financial service, which pulls together all of a 
customer’s financial data on a single personalized Web site.
•	
Despite a rocky start, the online mortgage market is slowly growing; it is dominated by established online 
banks and other online financial services firms, traditional mortgage vendors, and a few successful online 
mortgage firms.
•	
Term life insurance stands out as one product group supporting the early visions of lower search costs, 
increased price transparency, and the resulting consumer savings. However, in other insurance product 
lines, the Web offers insurance companies new opportunities for product and service differentiation and 
price discrimination.
•	
The early vision that the historically local, complex, and agent-driven real estate industry would be trans-
formed into a disintermediated marketplace where buyers and sellers could transact directly has not been 
realized. 
•	
The major impact of the online real estate industry is in influencing offline purchases and the primary 
service is a listing of available houses, with secondary links to mortgage lenders, credit reporting agen-
cies, neighborhood information, loan calculators, appraisal reports, sales price histories by neighborhood, 
school district data, and crime reports.
Describe the major trends in the online travel services industry today.
•	
The Internet has become the most common channel used by consumers to research travel options and 
book reservations for airline tickets, rental cars, hotel rooms, and tours. 
•	
The major trends in online travel services include consolidation, the rise of meta-search engines, mobile 
devices, and social media.
Identify current trends in the online career services industry.
•	
Next to travel services, job-hunting services have been one of the Internet’s most successful online ser-
vices because they save money for both job hunters and employers. 
•	
Online recruiting can also serve to establish market prices and terms, thereby identifying both the salary 
levels for specific jobs and the skill sets required to achieve those salary levels. 
•	
The major trends in the online career services industry are social networking, mobile, job search engines, 
consolidation, diversification, and localization.
Understand the business models of on-demand service companies.
•	
On-demand service companies provide a platform that enables the on-demand delivery of various ser-
vices, by connecting providers (“sellers”) who wish to exploit their “spare” resources, such as cars, rooms 
with beds, and ability to perform various services via their personal labor, with consumers (“buyers”) who 

	
R e v i e w 	

787
would like to utilize those resources and services. The companies collect a fee both from sellers and buy-
ers for using the platform. 
•	
Uber, a car rental service, and Airbnb, a room rental service, are the most well-known on-demand ser-
vices companies. They are also among the most disruptive and controversial.

B2B E-commerce

A l i b a b a :
C h i n a ’s  E - c o m m e r c e  K i n g

libaba is China’s undisputed B2C and 
B2B e-commerce king. Founded in 1999 
by Jack Ma, it began as a B2B exchange, 
enabling Chinese manufacturers to sell products such 
as circuit breakers and hydraulic cylinders to interna-
tional traders and retailers. In the next decade, the 
Alibaba Group branched out, first into the C2C sector 
and then into the B2C sector, both of which also proved 
lucrative.
Today, Alibaba has grown to a size that rivals or 
trumps many of the world’s established tech giants. 
In 2014, the company made a splashy initial public 
offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, start-
ing at U.S. $68 per share and finishing its first day of 
trading up 38% at nearly U.S. $94. The IPO raised 
U.S. $21.8 billion for the e-commerce giant, whose market value of U.S. $168 billion 
was approximately as large as the entire American IPO market to that point in the 
year (U.S. $180 billion). Since then, despite a slowdown in the Chinese economy, 
Alibaba announced a 32% increase in revenue year-over-year as of the third quarter 
of 2015 on the heels of even larger growth the previous year. After dipping below its 
IPO price briefly in September 2015, the company is trending upward and trading in 
the U.S. $80 per share range as of November 2015.
Alibaba operates eBay-like and Amazon-like businesses, and records more trade 
volume than those two companies combined! Alibaba does not hold inventory, manage 
warehouses, or perform fulfillment, nor does it charge its users. Instead, Alibaba runs 
platforms that connect sellers and buyers, and earns revenue from commissions and 
advertising. Alibaba is estimated to control somewhere between 45% to 80% of China’s 
rapidly expanding e-commerce market The success of the company’s IPO propelled Ma’s 
net worth to well over U.S. $20 billion. Though some investors worry about Alibaba’s 
lack of fulfillment facilities, most analysts expect the company to continue its strong 
upward trend going forward. Internet penetration in China lags behind that of many 
Western countries, offering more room for domestic growth in addition to any attempts 
the company makes to move into other markets.
The trajectory of Alibaba from its humbler beginnings to its current heights mirrors 
the coming of age and flourishing of Chinese e-commerce, a process that is ongoing.

Chinese e-commerce surpassed the United States in 2014 and is on track to continue 
32% average annual growth for the next two to three years. In all likelihood, by 2020, 
Chinese e-commerce will dwarf the United States, Great Britain, Japan, Germany, and 
France combined. 
Like many early players, Alibaba.com used an aggregation of supply model to 
connect buyers in North America and Europe to many SME suppliers in China. It 
created a platform to which sellers would upload their products, businesses would 
upload their requirements, and supplier–buyer matches would be made. When demand 
for Chinese goods faltered during the global recession of 2009, Alibaba.com transi-
tioned to recruiting sellers interested in marketing their goods to China, to Japan 
through its Japanese-language site (Alibaba.co.jp), and to India, where it had opened 
a branch. 
Today, there are three B2B divisions. Alibaba.com provides global sourcing, with 
business conducted in English between importers and exporters from over 240 countries. 
The Chinese language site, 1688.com, has traditionally focused on domestic B2B transac-
tions but announced plans to go global and strike deals with foreign suppliers in 2015. 
AliExpress.com serves small businesses, offering wholesale pricing without bulk buying 
requirements. By mid-2013, Alibaba.com claimed its 100 millionth customer, making 
it the largest B2B e-commerce provider in the world, and these numbers included a 
doubling over two years’ time of the domestic customers on 1688.com. Alibaba’s efforts 
to expand globally have continued in 2015, as the company announced the creation 
of new B2B platforms in India and Brazil, and continued to reach out to American 
and European retailers, marketing themselves as a more reliable way to access and 
understand the unique Chinese e-commerce market.
Alibaba’s site design emphasizes its robust search function, ease of use, and 
consumer-friendliness. Sellers found to have committed fraud are expelled, and when 
Alibaba intervention is required to resolve a dispute and sellers are found culpable, the 
seller’s page receives a public warning. Seller pages also display recent complaints. 
In the early years of Chinese e-commerce, counterfeit products and resale of branded 
goods were rampant. Alibaba’s policies were formed with this history in mind, aiming 
to protect its customers.
As you’ll learn in this chapter, the first wave of B2B exchanges fell short when the 
dot.com bubble of the early 2000s deflated. This  latest wave, headlined by Alibaba, has 
succeeded where its predecessors failed by focusing on cost savings and affordability to 
meet the needs of SMEs, who aren’t able to build their own marketplaces the way large 
companies can. As the rest of the world hatches new B2B start-ups to serve the Long 
Tail of the SME market, they will have to play catch-up with Alibaba, which has been 
providing procurement and supply chain efficiencies to small and mid-sized companies for 
15 years. Like Alibaba, they must lower transaction costs and identify unique suppliers 
and products for their buyers by providing a robust store of suppliers and using matching 
algorithms, personalization, and Big Data analytics to help buyers find the supplier with 
the best product to meet their needs.

T 
he Alibaba case illustrates the exciting potential for B2B e-commerce to lower 
production costs, increase collaboration among firms, speed up new product 
delivery, and ultimately revolutionize both the manufacturing process inher-
ited from the early twentieth century and the way industrial products are designed 
and manufactured. This case also introduces new themes in B2B commerce: sustain-
ability, environmental impacts, and social justice. Alibaba is an example of just one 
type of B2B e-commerce, but there are many other equally promising efforts to use 
the Internet to change the relationships among manufacturers and their suppliers. 
In the fashion industry, the combination of high-speed value chains coupled with 
equally high-speed trendy design not only clears shelves (and reduces the likelihood 
of clearance sales), but increases profits by increasing value to consumers (Zarroli, 
2013; Cachon and Swinney, 2011). In the automobile industry, for instance, the success 
of Volkswagen’s Group Business Platform and similar networks operated by the major 
automobile firms in the world stands in contrast to an earlier industry-sponsored 
marketplace called Covisint. Founded in 1999 by five of the world’s largest automak-
ers (General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, and Peugeot), Covisint hoped to provide 
a digital marketplace connecting thousands of suppliers to a few huge buyers using 
auctions and procurement services. While initially successful, Covisint was sold in 
June 2004, although it continues as a B2B services firm in a number of industries. 
Its auction business was sold to FreeMarkets, an early B2B auction company, which 
itself was sold to another B2B e-commerce firm called Ariba later in 2004. In 2014, 
Ariba survives as a successful software firm (now owned by SAP AG) focusing on the 
procurement process and the operation of a successful supplier trading platform and 
network.
The failure of Covisint (as well as Ford’s AutoExchange) and the simultaneous 
growth in B2B e-commerce efforts such as Volkswagen’s Group Business Platform 
illustrate the difficulties of achieving the broad visions established during the early 
days of e-commerce. Like B2C commerce, the B2B marketplace has consolidated, 
evolved, and moved on to more attainable visions. Changes in information technology, 
from smartphones to cloud computing, have greatly reduced the cost of B2B trading 
systems. In the process, many B2B efforts have experienced extraordinary success. 
There are many failed efforts to consider as well; these provide important lessons to 
all managers.
In this chapter, we examine three major B2B e-commerce themes: procurement, 
supply chain management, and collaborative commerce. Each of these business pro-
cesses has changed greatly with the evolution of B2B e-commerce systems. In Sections 
12.1 and 12.2, we provide an overview of B2B e-commerce, the procurement process, 
and supply chains. In Section 12.3, we place B2B e-commerce in the context of trends 
in procurement, supply chain management, and collaborative commerce. The final 
two sections describe the two fundamental types of B2B e-commerce: Net marketplaces 
and private industrial networks. 
Table 12.1 summarizes the leading trends in B2B e-commerce in the 2015–2016 
period. Perhaps the most important themes are growing industry concern with supply 
chain risk and environmental impact, along with a growing public concern with the 
accountability of supply chains—in particular, violations of developed-world expectations

TABLE 12.1	
MAJOR TRENDS IN B2B E-COMMERCE, 2015–2016
B U S I N E S S
•	 B2B e-commerce growth continues to accelerate in 2015 to pre-recession levels as the global economy 
continues to recover from recession.
•	 B2B e-distributors adopt the the same marketing and sales techniques as successful consumer 
e-commerce companies such as  Amazon.
•	 Risk management: companies heighten their focus on risks in supply chains after being blindsided in 
recent years by a number of natural and man-made disasters. 
•	 Regional manufacturing: risks of far-flung global networks lead to an increase in regional 
manufacturing and supply chains, moving production closer to market demand. 
•	 Flexibility: growing emphasis on rapid-response and adaptive supply chains rather than lowest cost 
supply chains, which typically carry great risks.
•	 Supply chain visibility: growing calls for more real-time data that would allow managers to see across 
not only their production, but also see into the production and financial condition of their key suppliers. 
•	 Social and mobile commerce and customer intimacy: B2B buyers, like consumers, are tapping into 
tablets, smartphones, and social networks for purchasing, scheduling, exception handling, and 
coordinating with their suppliers in order to manage supply chain risk.
T E C H N O L O G Y
•	 Big Data: global trade and logistics systems are generating huge repositories of B2B data, swamping 
management understanding and controls.
•	 Business analytics: growing emphasis on use of business analytics software (business intelligence) to 
understand very large data sets.
•	 Cloud: migration of B2B hardware and software to cloud computing and cloud apps, away from 
individual corporate data centers, as a means of slowing rising technology costs. B2B systems move to 
cloud computing providers like IBM, Oracle, Amazon, Google, and HP as their core technology. 
•	 Mobile platform: growing use of mobile platform for B2B systems (CRM, SCM, and enterprise), putting 
B2B commerce into managers’ palms.
•	 Social networks: increasing use of social network platforms for feedback from customers, strengthening 
customer and supplier relationships, adjusting prices and orders, and enhancing decision making.
•	 Internet of Things: The number of Internet-connected sensors and other intelligent devices that measure 
and monitor data continues to grow exponentially and begins to impact how supply chains operate.
S O C I E T Y
•	 Accountability: growing demands for supply chain accountability and monitoring in developed 
countries driven by reports of poor working conditions in Asian factories. 
•	 Sustainable supply chains: growing public demand for businesses to mitigate their environmental 
impact leads from local environmental optimization to consideration of the entire supply chain from 
design, production, customer service, and post-use disposal. 
•	 Acceptance and growth of B2B platforms: Ariba, one of the largest Net marketplaces, has over 1.7 
million connected businesses, including two-thirds of the Forbes Global 2000 largest companies, that 
participate in transactions with a value of over $700 billion a year. 
of working conditions in third-world factories that play a key role in the production of 
goods sold in more developed countries. What many firms have learned in the last 
decade is that supply chains can strengthen or weaken a company depending on a 
number of factors related to supply chain efficiency such as community engagement, 
labor relations, environmental protection, and sustainability. Yet many believe that all 

	
A n  O v e r v i e w  o f  B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e 	

795
of these related factors are important to the long profitability of firms (Beard and Hornik, 
2011). At the same time, in part because of the globalization of supply chains, B2B e-com-
merce systems are now used by nearly all of the U.S. S&P 500 firms, where over half of 
all revenues are produced offshore. Thousands of smaller firms are now able to partici-
pate in B2B systems as low-cost cloud-based computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
become widely available. The cost of participating in B2B e-commerce systems has fallen 
significantly, allowing smaller firms to participate along with giant firms. Taking advan-
tage of the exploding mobile platform, more companies are using smartphones and tablet 
computers to run their businesses from any location. There are thousands of iPhone and 
Android apps available from enterprise B2B vendors like SAP, IBM, Oracle, and others 
that link to supply chain management systems (Enright, 2013; Bolukbasi, 2011; Melnyk, 
2010). Social network tools are pushing into the B2B world as well as the consumer world. 
B2B managers are increasingly using public and private social network sites and technolo-
gies to enable long-term conversations with their customers and suppliers. Executives at 
firms large and small are coming to realize that they are competing not just with other 
firms but with those firms’ supply chains as well. Supply chain competition refers to 
the fact that in some industries firms are able to differentiate their product or pricing, 
and achieve a competitive advantage, due to superior supply chain management. Argu-
ably, firms with superior supply chains can produce better products, more quickly, and 
at a lower cost than those with simply adequate supply chains (Antai, 2011).
	12.1	 AN OVERVIEW OF B2B E-COMMERCE
The trade between business firms represents a huge marketplace. The total amount 
of B2B trade in the United States in 2015 is expected to be about $14.6 trillion, with 
B2B e-commerce contributing about $6.3 trillion of that amount (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2015; authors’ estimates). By 2019, B2B e-commerce is expected to grow to about $8.6 
trillion in the United States. Worldwide, B2B e-commerce is estimated to be around 
€14.2 trillion in 2015 (United Nations, 2015).
The process of conducting trade among business firms is complex and requires 
significant human intervention, and therefore, consumes significant resources. Some 
firms estimate that each corporate purchase order for support products costs them, on 
average, at least $100 in administrative overhead. Administrative overhead includes 
processing paper, approving purchase decisions, spending time using the telephone 
and fax machines to search for products and arrange for purchases, arranging for 
shipping, and receiving the goods. Across the economy, this adds up to trillions of 
dollars annually being spent for procurement processes that could potentially be 
automated. If even just a portion of inter-firm trade were automated, and parts of the 
entire procurement process assisted by the Internet, then literally trillions of dollars 
might be released for more productive uses, consumer prices potentially would fall, 
productivity would increase, and the economic wealth of the nation would expand. 
This is the promise of B2B e-commerce. The challenge of B2B e-commerce is changing 
existing patterns and systems of procurement, and designing and implementing new 
digital B2B solutions.

SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS
Before the Internet, business-to-business transactions were referred to simply as trade 
or the procurement process. We use the term B2B commerce to describe all types of 
inter-firm trade to exchange value across organizational boundaries. B2B commerce 
includes the following business processes: customer relationship management, 
demand management, order fulfillment, manufacturing management, procurement, 
product development, returns, logistics/transportation, and inventory management 
(Barlow, 2011). This definition of B2B commerce does not include transactions that 
occur within the boundaries of a single firm—for instance, the transfer of goods and 
value from one subsidiary to another, or the use of corporate intranets to manage the 
firm. We use the term B2B e-commerce (or B2B digital commerce) to describe 
specifically that portion of B2B commerce that is enabled by the Internet (including 
mobile apps) (Fauska, et al., 2013). The links that connect business firms in the produc-
tion of goods and services are referred to as the supply chain. Supply chains are a 
complex system of organizations, people, business processes, technology, and informa-
tion, all of which need to work together to produce products efficiently. Today’s supply 
chains are often global, connecting the smartphones in New York to the shipyards in 
Los Angeles and Quindow, and to the Foxconn factories that produce the phones. They 
are also local and national in scope. 
THE EVOLUTION OF B2B E-COMMERCE
B2B e-commerce has evolved over a 35-year period through several technology-driven 
stages (see Figure 12.1). The first step in the development of B2B e-commerce in the 
mid-1970s was automated order entry systems that involved the use of telephone 
modems to send digital orders to health care products companies such as Baxter 
Healthcare. Baxter, a diversified supplier of hospital supplies, placed telephone 
modems in its customers’ procurement offices to automate reordering from Baxter’s 
computerized inventory database (and to discourage reordering from competitors). 
This early technology was replaced by personal computers using private networks in 
the late 1980s, and by Internet workstations accessing electronic online catalogs in 
the late 1990s. Automated order entry systems are seller-side solutions. They are 
owned by the suppliers and are seller-biased markets—they show only goods from a 
single seller. Customers benefited from these systems because they reduced the costs 
of inventory replenishment and were paid for largely by the suppliers. Automated 
order entry systems continue to play an important role in B2B commerce.
By the late 1970s, a new form of computer-to-computer communication called 
electronic data interchange (EDI) emerged. We describe EDI in greater detail later 
in this chapter, but at this point, it is necessary only to know that EDI is a communica-
tions standard for sharing business documents such as invoices, purchase orders, 
shipping bills, product stocking numbers (SKUs), and settlement information among 
a small number of firms. Virtually all large firms have EDI systems, and most industry 
groups have industry standards for defining documents in that industry. EDI systems 
are owned by the buyers, hence they are buyer-side solutions and buyer-biased 
because they aim to reduce the procurement costs of supplies for the buyer. Of course,

by automating the transaction, EDI systems also benefit the sellers through customer 
cost reduction. The topology of EDI systems is often referred to as a hub-and-spoke 
system, with the buyers in the center and the suppliers connected to the central hub 
via private dedicated networks.
EDI systems generally serve vertical markets. A vertical market is one that 
provides expertise and products for a specific industry, such as automobiles. In con-
trast, horizontal markets serve many different industries.
B2B e-commerce Web sites emerged in the mid-1990s along with the commercial-
ization of the Internet. B2B e-commerce Web sites are perhaps the simplest and 
easiest form of B2B e-commerce to understand, because they are just online catalogs 
of products made available to the public marketplace by a single supplier. In this sense, 
they mimic the functionality of B2C e-commerce Web sites. Owned by the supplier, 
they are seller-side solutions and seller-biased because they show only the products 
offered by a single supplier.
B2B e-commerce Web sites are a natural descendant of automated order entry 
systems, but there are two important differences: (1) the far less expensive and more 
universal Internet becomes the communication media and displaces private net-
works, and (2) B2B e-commerce Web sites tend to serve horizontal markets—they carry 
products that serve a wide variety of industries. Although B2B e-commerce Web sites

THE EVOLUTION OF THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS 
IN B2B E-COMMERCE
B2B e-commerce has gone through many stages of development since the 1970s. Each stage reflects a 
major change in technology platforms from mainframes to private dedicated networks, and finally to the 
Internet, mobile apps and social networks.

emerged prior to Net marketplaces (described next), they are usually considered a 
type of Net marketplace. Today, more and more B2B manufacturers, distributors, and 
suppliers are using B2B e-commerce Web sites to sell directly to business customers, 
who most often are procurement/purchasing agents, as discussed in Section 12.2.
Net marketplaces emerged in the late 1990s as a natural extension and scaling-up 
of B2B e-commerce Web sites. There are many different kinds of Net marketplaces, 
which we describe in detail in Section 12.4, but the essential characteristic of a Net 
marketplace is that it brings hundreds or even thousands of suppliers—each with a 
digital catalog and potentially thousands of purchasing firms—into a single Internet-
based environment to conduct trade.
Net marketplaces can be organized under a variety of ownership models. Some 
are owned by independent third parties backed by venture capital, some are owned 
by established firms who are the main or only market players, and some are a mix 
of both. Net marketplaces establish the prices of the goods they offer in four primary 
ways—fixed catalog prices, or more dynamic pricing, such as negotiation, auction, 
or bid/ask (“exchange” model). Net marketplaces earn revenue in a number of ways, 
including transaction fees, subscription fees, service fees, software licensing fees, 
advertising and marketing, and sales of data and information. In the last few years, 
cloud-based B2B Net marketplaces have emerged, and generate revenue by selling 
access to their storage, software services, and communications facilities. 
Although the primary benefits and biases of Net marketplaces have to be ­determined 
on a case-by-case basis depending on ownership and pricing mechanisms, it is often the 
case that Net marketplaces are biased against suppliers because they can force suppliers 
to reveal their prices and terms to other suppliers in the marketplace. Net marketplaces 
can also significantly extend the benefits of simple electronic storefronts by seeking to 
automate the procurement value chain of both selling and buying firms.
Private industrial networks also emerged in the last decade as natural extensions 
of EDI systems and the existing close relationships that developed between large indus-
trial firms and their trusted suppliers. Described in more detail in Section 12.5, private 
industrial networks (sometimes also referred to as a private trading exchange, or PTX) 
are Internet-based communication environments that extend far beyond procurement 
to encompass supply chain efficiency enhancements and truly collaborative commerce. 
The VWGroupSupply platform is an excellent example of a private industrial network. 
Private industrial networks permit buyer firms and their principal suppliers to share 
product design and development, marketing, inventory, production scheduling, and 
unstructured communications. Like EDI, private industrial networks are owned by the 
buyers and are buyer-side solutions with buyer biases. These systems are directly 
intended to improve the cost position and flexibility of large industrial firms (Yoo et al., 
2011; Kumaran, 2002). These private industrial networks have a much higher survival 
rate than other Net marketplaces (Rosenzweig, 2011).
Naturally, private industrial networks have significant benefits for suppliers as 
well. Inclusion in the direct supply chain for a major industrial purchasing company 
can allow a supplier to increase both revenue and margins because the environment is 
not competitive—only a few suppliers are included in the private industrial network. 
These networks are the most prevalent form of B2B e-commerce, and this will continue 
into the foreseeable future.

THE GROWTH OF B2B E-COMMERCE
Figure 12.2 illustrates the growth of B2B e-commerce, as well that of traditional 
B2B commerce, during the period 2010–2019. However, let’s focus on the growth of 
B2B e-commerce during the period 2015–2019. During this time, B2B e-commerce is 
projected to grow from about $6.3 trillion in 2014 (about 43% of total B2B commerce 
in the United States) to $8.6 trillion (48% of total B2B commerce) in 2019. Several 
observations are important to note with respect to Figure 12.2. First, it shows that 
the initial belief that online marketplaces would become the dominant form of B2B 
e-commerce is not supported. Second, private industrial networks play a dominant 
role in B2B e-commerce, both now and in the future. Third, non-EDI B2B e-commerce 
is the most rapidly growing type of B2B e-commerce. However, EDI remains quite 
common and continues to be a workhorse of B2B commerce. 
Not all industries will be similarly affected by B2B e-commerce, nor will all indus-
tries similarly benefit from B2B. Several factors influence the speed with which indus-
tries migrate to B2B e-commerce and the volume of transactions. Those industries 
in which there is already significant utilization of EDI (indicating concentration of 
buyers and suppliers) and large investments in information technology and Internet 
infrastructure can be expected to move first and fastest to B2B e-commerce utilization. 
The aerospace and defense, computer, and industrial equipment industries meet these

criteria. Where the marketplace is highly concentrated on either the purchasing or 
selling side, or both, conditions are also ripe for rapid B2B e-commerce growth, as in 
the energy and chemical industries. In the case of health care, the federal government, 
health care providers (doctors and hospitals), and major insurance companies are 
moving toward a national medical record system and the use of the Internet for man-
aging medical payments. Coordinating the various players in the health care system 
is an extraordinary B2B challenge. Computer service firms like IBM and Microsoft, 
and B2B service firms like Covisint, are expanding the use of information ecosystems 
where health providers and insurers can share information. 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF B2B E-COMMERCE
Regardless of the specific type, B2B commerce as a whole promises many strategic 
benefits to firms—both buyers and sellers—and impressive gains for the economy. 
B2B e-commerce can:
•	 Lower administrative costs
•	 Lower search costs for buyers
•	 Reduce inventory costs by increasing competition among suppliers (increasing price 
transparency) and reducing inventory to the bare minimum
•	 Lower transaction costs by eliminating paperwork and automating parts of the 
procurement process
•	 Increase production flexibility by ensuring delivery of parts just at the right time 
(known as just-in-time production)
•	 Improve quality of products by increasing cooperation among buyers and sellers 
and reducing quality issues
•	 Decrease product cycle time by sharing designs and production schedules with 
suppliers
•	 Increase opportunities for collaborating with suppliers and distributors
•	 Create greater price transparency—the ability to see the actual buy and sell prices 
in a market
•	 Increase the visibility and real-time information sharing among all participants in 
the supply chain network.
B2B e-commerce offers potential first-mover strategic benefits for individual firms as 
well. Firms that move their procurement processes online first will experience impres-
sive gains in productivity, cost reduction, and potentially much faster introduction of 
new, higher-quality products. While these gains may be imitated by other competing 
firms, it is also clear from the history of B2B e-commerce that firms making sustained 
investments in information technology and B2B e-commerce can adapt much faster to 
new technologies as they emerge, creating a string of first-mover advantages.
While there are many potential benefits to B2B e-commerce, there are also consider-
able risks and challenges. Often real-world supply chains fail to provide visibility into 
the supply chain because they lack real-time demand, production, and logistics data, 
and have inadequate financial data on suppliers. The result is unexpected supplier 
failure and disruption to the supply chain. Builders of B2B supply chains often had 
little concern for the environmental impacts of supply chains, the sensitivity of supply

chains to natural events, fluctuating fuel and labor costs, or the impact of public values 
involving labor and environmental policies. The result in 2015 is that many Fortune 1000 
supply chains are risky, vulnerable, and socially and environmentally unsustainable.

	12.2	 THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND SUPPLY CHAINS
The subject of B2B e-commerce can be complex because there are so many ways the 
Internet can be used to support the exchange of goods and payments among organiza-
tions, efficient supply chains, and collaboration. At the most basic level, B2B e-com-
merce is about changing the procurement process (how business firms purchase 
goods they need to produce goods they will ultimately sell to consumers) of thousands 
of firms across the world. In the procurement process, firms purchase goods from a 
set of suppliers, and they in turn purchase their inputs from a set of suppliers. The 
supply chain includes not just the firms themselves, but also the relationships among 
them and the processes that connect them.
STEPS IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS
There are seven separate steps in the procurement process (see Figure 12.3). The 
first three steps involve the decision of who to buy from and what to pay: searching 
for suppliers of specific products; qualifying both sellers and the products they sell;

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
WHERE’S MY IPAD? GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN 
RISK AND VULNERABILITY 
In 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earth-
quake occurred offshore of northern 
Japan. The Tohoku earthquake was the 
largest in recorded history and immedi-
ately created a number of tsunami waves, 
some of which exceeded 100 feet in height and 
penetrated up to six miles inland. In their path 
were six coastal nuclear reactors in the Fuku-
shima Prefecture near the town of Okuma, the 
largest nuclear power site in the world. Several of 
the nuclear reactors exploded and began leaking 
dangerous levels of radiation as fuel rods melted 
at temperatures exceeding 5,000 degrees. 
The Tohoku earthquake exposed significant 
weaknesses and vulnerabilities in today’s modern 
B2B supply chains. Technology, globalization of 
trade, and high levels of wage disparity between 
the developed and undeveloped worlds have led to 
a massive outsourcing of manufacturing around 
the world. Today, every component of every man-
ufactured product is carefully examined by com-
pany engineers and financial managers with an 
eye to finding the lowest cost and highest qual-
ity manufacturer. Production inevitably tends to 
concentrate at single firms that are given very 
high order volumes if they can meet the price. 
Large orders make lower prices easier to provide 
because of scale economies. However, when you 
concentrate production globally with just a few 
suppliers, you also concentrate risk. 
As a result, the world’s manufacturing base 
has become less redundant, flexible, and adaptive 
than older traditional supply chains. Interdepen-
dencies have grown into a tightly coupled machine 
that is quite fragile. Risk assessment in supply 
chains has been weak or nonexistent. 
Computers, cell phones, tractors, airplanes, 
and automobiles are just a few of the complex man-
ufactured goods that rely on parts and subassem-
blies made thousands of miles away from their final 
assembly plants. Most of these manufacturers know 
who their first-tier suppliers are but may be less 
aware about who supplies their suppliers, and so on 
down the line of the industrial spider’s web that con-
stitutes the real world of supply chains. Few firms 
had considered the impact of an earthquake on 
their supply chains, or a nuclear meltdown, or even 
a financial collapse in the global banking system—
all typical risks found in the real world. 
Take the Apple iPad. In a teardown of an 
iPad after the earthquake, IHS iSuppli, a market 
research firm, identified at least five major com-
ponents sourced from Japanese suppliers, some 
of whom were located in northern Japan. Not all 
of these suppliers were directly impacted by the 
earthquake, but some were, and many had sub-
suppliers of various hard-to-replace small compo-
nents that were directly impacted. For instance, 
the iPad and iPhone’s unusually shaped lithium 
batteries used a crucial polymer made by Kureha, 
a Japanese firm in the nuclear contamination 
zone. Kureha controls 70% of the global produc-
tion of this polymer. Apple was not the only con-
sumer product manufacturer hit hard: computer 
chips are built on silicon wafers, and 25% of the 
world’s supply is made by two Japanese manufac-
turers, both of which had to shut down wafer pro-
duction. A few years later, in 2015, a tear-down 
of the iPhone 6 Plus by IHS iSuppli found that 
Apple had learned its lesson and diversified its 
supply chain by often having two manufacturers 
for the same components sourced from different 
countries, and also having various components 
manufactured in different parts of the globe. For 
instance, the retina display screen is manufac-
tured in both Japan and Korea, while the A8 pro-

	
T h e  P r o c u r e m e n t  P r o c e s s  a n d  S u p p l y  C h a i n s 	

803
cessor is manufactured in both Taiwan and Korea; 
the NFC chips are made in Holland and Austria, 
while the audio chip is from United States and 
the accelerometer chip is from Germany.
Apple was not the only manufacturer that 
learned a lesson in supply chain risk from the Jap-
anese earthquake: Boeing was without carbon 
fiber airframe assemblies made in Japan; Ford and 
GM closed factories for lack of Japanese trans-
missions; and Caterpillar reduced production at 
its factories worldwide as it attempted to secure 
alternative suppliers. 
Supply chain risk involves more than disrup-
tions in production, as Apple and many other com-
panies have discovered. Supply chains can produce 
reputational risks when key suppliers engage in 
labor and environmental policies and practices 
that are unacceptable to developed world audi-
ences. For instance, for much of 2012, Apple was 
under attack in the United States and Europe 
after an audit by the Fair Labor Association found 
that workers at several assembly plants operated 
by Apple contractor Foxconn were exposed to 
toxic chemicals and forced to work over 60 hours 
a week under dangerous work conditions. 
Also in 2012, a fire in a clothing factory in 
Dhaka, Bangladesh, killed 117 workers, mostly 
women and children. Well-known brands from 
Europe and the United States, among them 
Walmart and Spanish giant Inditex, were pro-
ducing clothing in this factory. Walmart claimed 
a subcontractor was using this factory without 
Walmart’s knowledge. The fire created a world-
wide protest, and has led to government and 
industry efforts to certify factory safety 
in Bangladesh and hold firms responsible for 
working conditions. 
It also isn’t just natural disasters and fires 
that can disrupt supply lines. In 2015, supply lines 
from Asia to the United States were shut down for 
nearly a month by a longshoreman’s dock strike 
that resulted in a slowdown of automobile pro-
duction throughout the United States. This in 
turn backed up production in Asia of car parts. 
Thailand, the world’s third largest fish exporter, 
was discovered to be using slave labor to harvest 
fish, and its product was banned by the European 
Union. Many American companies had their sup-
plies disrupted, and needed to find other suppliers. 
Finally a new class of supply chain risk is becom-
ing apparent: cybersecurity risks. With hundreds 
of suppliers, it is very difficult for any single pur-
chasing firm to assess the security of its suppli-
ers’ systems. Reducing the number of suppliers is 
one method. Working only with trusted partners is 
another. Yet there remains a large opportunity for 
cybercriminals and rogue governments to disrupt 
global supply chains.
One might think that in the so-called global 
and Internet economy, computer-based supply 
chains could quickly and effortlessly adjust to find 
new suppliers for just about any component or 
industrial material in a matter of minutes. Think 
again. New supply chains will need to be built 
that optimize not just cost but also survivability 
in the event of disasters, as well as meet the ethi-
cal demands of the major consuming countries in 
Europe and the United States.

and negotiating prices, credit terms, escrow requirements, quality, and scheduling of 
delivery. Once a supplier is identified, purchase orders are issued, the buyer is sent 
an invoice, the goods are shipped, and the buyer sends a payment. Each of these steps 
in the procurement process is composed of many separate business processes and 
subactivities. Each of these activities must be recorded in the information systems of 
the seller, buyer, and shipper. Often, this data entry is not automatic and involves a 
great deal of manual labor, telephone calls, faxes, and e-mails.
TYPES OF PROCUREMENT
Two distinctions are important for understanding how B2B e-commerce can improve 
the procurement process. First, firms make purchases of two kinds of goods from 
suppliers: direct goods and indirect goods. Direct goods are goods integrally involved 
in the production process; for instance, when an automobile manufacturer purchases 
sheet steel for auto body production. Indirect goods are all other goods not directly 
involved in the production process, such as office supplies and maintenance products. 
Often these goods are called MRO goods—products for maintenance, repair, and 
operations.
Second, firms use two different methods for purchasing goods: contract purchas-
ing and spot purchasing. Contract purchasing involves long-term written agreements 
to purchase specified products, with agreed-upon terms and quality, for an extended 
period of time. Generally, firms purchase direct goods using long-term contracts. Spot 
purchasing involves the purchase of goods based on immediate needs in larger 
marketplaces that involve many suppliers. Generally, firms use spot purchasing for 
indirect goods, although in some cases, firms also use spot purchasing for direct goods.
According to some estimates, about 65% of inter-firm trade involves contract 
purchasing of direct goods, and 35% involves spot purchasing of indirect goods (Ariba, 
2014; Kaplan and Sawhney, 2000). There are, of course, differences among industries. 
Purchases of direct goods play a dominant role in the extraction and metal industries, 
for instance. This finding is significant for understanding B2B e-commerce.
Although the procurement process involves the purchasing of goods, it is 
extraordinarily information-intense, involving the movement of information among 
many existing corporate systems. The procurement process today is also very labor-
intensive, directly involving millions of employees around the world, not including 
those engaged in transportation, finance, insurance, or general office administration 
related to the process. The key players in the procurement process are the purchasing 
managers. They ultimately decide who to buy from, what to buy, and on what terms. 
Purchasing managers (“procurement managers” in the business press) are also the 
key decision makers for the adoption of B2B e-commerce solutions. As purchasing 
managers have become more familiar and comfortable with B2C e-commerce in their 
personal lives, they are increasingly coming to expect the same type of purchasing 
experience in the B2B arena. As a result, B2B manufacturers, suppliers, and distribu-
tors are finding that in order to effectively compete, they must pay more attention 
to the online customer experience, just as their B2C counterparts do. Features that 
B2B customers now expect include enhanced search functionality, up-to-date product 
pricing and availability information, product configurators, mobile support, apps along

with Web sites, online support forums, live customer service reps, and a database that 
contains their corporate purchasing history, shipping preferences, and payment data, 
and provides support for repeat orders. 
MULTI-TIER SUPPLY CHAINS
Although Figure 12.3 captures some of the complexity of the procurement process, 
it is important to realize that firms purchase thousands of goods from ­thousands of 
suppliers. The suppliers, in turn, must purchase their inputs from their suppliers. 
Large manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company have over 20,000 ­suppliers of 
parts, packaging, and technology. The number of secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
at least as large. Together, this extended multi-tier supply chain (the chain of 
primary, secondary, and tertiary suppliers) constitutes a crucial aspect of the indus-
trial infrastructure of the economy. Figure 12.4 depicts a firm’s multi-tier supply 
chain.
The supply chain depicted in Figure 12.4 is a three-tier chain simplified for the 
sake of illustration. In fact, large Fortune 1000 firms have thousands of suppliers, 
who in turn have thousands of smaller suppliers. The complexity of the supply chain 
suggests a combinatorial explosion. Assuming a manufacturer has four primary sup-
pliers and each one has three primary suppliers, and each of these has three primary 
suppliers, then the total number of suppliers in the chain (including the buying firm) 
rises to 53. This figure does not include the shippers, insurers, and financiers involved 
in the transactions.

Immediately, you can see from Figure 12.4 that the procurement process involves 
a very large number of suppliers, each of whom must be coordinated with the produc-
tion needs of the ultimate purchaser—the buying firm. You can also understand how 
difficult it is to manage the supply chain, or obtain visibility into the supply chain 
simply because of its size and scope. 
VISIBILITY AND OTHER CONCEPTS IN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
The global, multi-tier nature of supply chains produces a number of challenges for supply 
chain managers. A central concept of supply chains is supply chain visibility, which 
refers to the ability of a firm to monitor the output of its first- and second-tier suppliers, 
track and manage supplier orders, and manage transportation and logistics providers who 
are moving the products. A supply chain is visible when you know exactly what you have 
ordered from your suppliers and what their production schedule is, and when you can 
track the goods through shipping and trucking firms to your in-bound warehouse. With 
this knowledge, the firm’s internal enterprise systems can produce production schedules 
and develop financial forecasts (Long, 2014; Cecere, 2014; Cecere, 2013.)
Other key concepts in supply chain management, and which are also central 
management challenges, are described in Table 12.2.
THE ROLE OF EXISTING LEGACY COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ENTERPRISE 
SYSTEMS IN SUPPLY CHAINS
Complicating any efforts to coordinate the many firms in a supply chain is the fact 
that each firm generally has its own set of legacy computer systems, sometimes home-
grown or customized, that cannot easily pass information to other systems. Legacy 
computer systems generally are older enterprise systems used to manage key busi-
ness processes within a firm in a variety of functional areas from manufacturing, 
logistics, finance, and human resources. Enterprise systems are corporate-wide 
systems that relate to all aspects of production, including finance, human resources, 
and procurement. Many large Fortune 500 global firms have implemented global 
enterprise-wide systems from major vendors such as IBM, SAP, Oracle, and others. 
Generally enterprise systems have an inward focus on the firm’s internal production 
processes, and only tangentially are concerned with suppliers. More contemporary

cloud-based dedicated B2B software that can be integrated with existing enterprise 
systems is growing in importance. Companies such as IBM, Oracle, and SAP have 
developed SaaS (software as a service) or on-demand cloud-based supply chain man-
agement systems that can work seamlessly with their legacy offerings. Cloud-based 
supply chain management revenues are growing at 25% annually, although many 
firms prefer to maintain their own supply chain management systems on their private 
clouds rather than use shared public cloud services (Chao, 2015; Accenture, 2014). 
	12.3	 TRENDS IN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND 
COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE
It is impossible to comprehend the actual and potential contribution of B2B e-commerce, 
or the successes and failures of B2B e-commerce vendors and markets, without under-
standing ongoing efforts to improve the procurement process through a variety of supply 
chain management programs that long preceded the development of e-commerce.
Supply chain management (SCM) refers to a wide variety of activities that firms 
and industries use to coordinate the key players in their procurement process. For the 
most part, today’s procurement managers still work with telephones, e-mail, fax 
machines, face-to-face conversations, and instinct, relying on trusted long-term suppliers 
for their strategic purchases of goods directly involved in the production process.
There have been a number of major developments in supply chain manage-
ment over the last two decades that set the ground rules for understanding how B2B 
e-commerce works (or fails to work). These developments include just-in-time and 
lean production, supply chain simplification, adaptive supply chains, sustainable 
supply chains, electronic data interchange (EDI), supply chain management systems, 
and collaborative commerce (Supply Chain Digest, 2012a).
JUST-IN-TIME AND LEAN PRODUCTION
One of the significant costs in any production process is the cost of in-process inven-
tory: the parts and supplies needed to produce a product or service. Just-in-time 
production is a method of inventory cost management that seeks to reduce excess 
inventory to a bare minimum. In just-in-time production, the parts needed for, say, 
an automobile, arrive at the assembly factory a few hours or even minutes before they 
are attached to a car. Payment for the parts does not occur until the parts are attached 
to a vehicle on the production line. In the past, producers used to order enough parts 
for a week or even a month’s worth of production, creating huge, costly buffers in the 
production process. These buffers assured that parts would almost always be available, 
but at a large cost. Lean production is a set of production methods and tools that 
focuses on the elimination of waste throughout the customer value chain. It is an 
extension of just-in-time beyond inventory management to the full range of activities 
that create customer value. Originally, just-in-time and lean methods were imple-
mented with phones, faxes, and paper documents to coordinate the flow of parts in 
inventory. Supply chain management systems now have largely automated the process 
of acquiring inventory from suppliers, and made possible significant savings on a 
supply chain

global basis. Arguably, contemporary supply chain systems are the foundation of 
today’s global B2B production system.
SUPPLY CHAIN SIMPLIFICATION
Many manufacturing firms have spent the past two decades reducing the size of their 
supply chains and working more closely with a smaller group of strategic supplier 
firms to reduce both product costs and administrative costs, while improving quality, 
a trend known as supply chain simplification. Following the lead of Japanese 
industry, for instance, the automobile industry has systematically reduced the number 
of its suppliers by over 50%. Instead of open bidding for orders, large manufacturers 
have chosen to work with strategic partner supply firms under long-term contracts 
that guarantee the supplier business and also establish quality, cost, and timing goals. 
These strategic partnership programs are essential for just-in-time production models, 
and often involve joint product development and design, integration of computer 
systems, and tight coupling of the production processes of two or more companies. 
Tight coupling is a method for ensuring that suppliers precisely deliver the ordered 
parts at a specific time and to a particular location, ensuring the production process 
is not interrupted for lack of parts.
SUPPLY CHAIN BLACK SWANS: ADAPTIVE SUPPLY CHAINS
While firms have greatly simplified their supply chains in the last decade, they have 
also sought to centralize them by adopting a single, global supply chain system that 
integrates all the firm’s vendor and logistics information into a single enterprise-wide 
system. Large software firms like Oracle, IBM, and SAP encourage firms to adopt a “one 
world, one firm, one database” enterprise-wide view of the world in order to achieve 
scale economies, simplicity, and to optimize global cost and value. 
Beginning in earnest in 2000, managers in developed countries used these new 
technological capabilities to push manufacturing and production to the lowest cost 
labor regions of the world, specifically China and South East Asia. This movement of 
production to Asia was also enabled by the entrance of China into the World Trade 
Organization in September 2001. Suddenly, it was both technologically and politically 
possible to concentrate production wherever possible in the lowest cost region of the 
world. These developments were also supported by low-cost fuel, which made both 
transoceanic shipping and production inexpensive, and relative political stability in the 
region. By 2005, many economists believed a new world economic order had emerged 
based on cheap labor in Asia capable of producing inexpensive products for Western 
consumers, profits for global firms, and the opening of Asian markets to sophisticated 
Western goods and financial products. 
As it turns out, there were many risks and costs to this strategy of concentrating 
production in China and Asia in a world of economic, financial, political, and even 
geological instability. Today, managers need to be more careful in balancing gains in 
efficiency from a highly centralized supply chain, with the risks inherent to such a 
strategy (Long, 2014). For instance, in the global financial crisis of 2007–2009, relying 
on suppliers in parts of Europe where currencies and interest rates fluctuated greatly 
exposed many firms to higher costs than anticipated. Suddenly, key suppliers could

not obtain financing for their production or shipments. In March 2011, following the 
earthquake and tsunami in Japan, key suppliers in Japan were forced to shut down 
or slow production because of nuclear contamination of the entire Fukushima region 
where, as its turns out, major Japanese and American firms had automobile parts 
factories. As a result, General Motors could no longer obtain transmissions for its Volt 
electric car, and had to shut down a truck factory in Louisiana due to a lack of parts 
from Japan. Japanese and other global firms could not obtain batteries, switches, 
and axle assemblies. Production lead times in the automobile industry were very 
short, and inventories of parts were intentionally very lean, with only a few weeks’ 
supply on hand. Texas Instruments shut down several of its Japanese plants, as did 
Toshiba, putting a crimp on the world supply of NAND flash memory chips used 
in smartphones (Jolly, 2011; Bunkley, 2011). Caterpillar, Sony, Boeing, Volvo, and 
hundreds of other firms that are all part of a tightly coupled world supply chain also 
experienced supply chain disruptions. And then, in October of 2011, torrential rains 
in Thailand led to flooding of many of its key industrial regions, and the wiping out 
of a significant share of the world’s electronics components from hard disk drives to 
automobile subsystems, cameras, and notebook PCs (Supply Chain Digest, 2012b). 
In recent years, the source of supply chain disruptions shifted to technology, with 
major disruptions due to failure of cloud-based services and cyberattacks (Rossi, 2015; 
Rowland, 2014; Gusman, 2013; Zurich Insurance, 2012). 
The risks and costs of extended and concentrated supply chains have begun to 
change corporate strategies (Chopra and Sodhi, 2014). To cope with unpredictable 
world events, firms are taking steps to create adaptive supply chains that allow 
them to react to disruptions in the supply chain in a particular region by moving 
production to a different region. Many companies are breaking up single global 
supply chain systems into regional or product-based supply chains and reducing the 
level of centralization. Using adaptive supply chains, firms can decide to locate some 
production of parts in Latin America, for instance, rather than having all their pro-
duction or suppliers in a single country such as Japan. They will be able to move 
production around the world to temporary safe harbors. This may result in higher 
short-term costs, but provide substantial, longer-term risk protection in the event 
any single region is disrupted. Increasingly, supply chains are being built based on 
the assumption that global ­disruptions in supply are inevitable, but not predictable. 
The focus in 2015 is on optimal-cost, not low-cost, supply chains, and more distrib-
uted manufacturing along with more flexible supply chains that can shift reliably 
from high-risk to low-risk areas. Regional manufacturing means shorter supply 
chains that can respond rapidly to changing consumer tastes and demand levels 
(PriceWaterhouseCoopers and the MIT Forum for Supply Chain Innovation, 2015; 
Cachon and Swinney, 2011). 
ACCOUNTABLE SUPPLY CHAINS: LABOR STANDARDS
Accountable supply chains are those where the labor conditions in low-wage, under-
developed producer countries are visible and morally acceptable to ultimate consum-
ers in more developed industrial societies. For much of the last century, American 
and European manufacturers with global supply chains with large offshore production

facilities sought to hide the realities of their offshore factories from Western reporters 
and ordinary citizens. For global firms with long supply chains, visibility did not mean 
their consumers could understand how their products were made. 
Beginning in 2000, and in part because of the growing power of the Internet to 
empower citizen reporters around the world, the realities of global supply chains have 
slowly become more transparent to the public. For instance, for much of the past 
decade, beginning in 1997, Nike, the world’s largest manufacturer of sporting goods, 
has been under intense criticism for exploiting foreign workers, operating sweat shops, 
employing children, and allowing dangerous conditions in its subcontractor factories. 
As a result, Nike has introduced significant changes to its global supply chain. 
With the emergence of truly global supply chains, and political changes at the 
World Trade Organization, which opened up European and American markets to Asian 
goods and services, many—if not most—of the electronics, toys, cosmetics, industrial 
supplies, footwear, apparel, and other goods consumed in the developed world are 
made by workers in factories in the less developed world, primarily in Asia and Latin 
America. Unfortunately, but quite understandably, the labor conditions in these fac-
tories in most cases do not meet the minimal labor standards of Europe or America 
even though these factories pay higher wages and offer better working conditions than 
other local jobs in the host country. In many cases, the cost for a worker of not having 
a job in what—to Western standards—are horrible working conditions is to sink deeper 
into poverty and even worse conditions. Many point out that labor conditions were 
brutal in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth century 
when these countries were building industrial economies, and therefore, whatever 
conditions exist in offshore factories in 2014 are no worse than developed countries 
in their early years of rapid industrialization. 
The argument results in a painful ethical dilemma, a terrible trade-off: cheap 
manufactured goods that increase consumer welfare in developed countries seem to 
require human misery in less developed countries. Indeed, these jobs would never 
have been moved to less developed parts of world without exceptionally low, even 
survival level, wages. 
Notwithstanding the argument that having a job is better than being unemployed 
in low-wage countries, or any country, there are some working conditions that are 
completely unacceptable to consumers and therefore to firms in developed countries. 
Among these unacceptable working conditions are slave or forced labor, child employ-
ment, routine exposure to toxic substances, more than 48 hours of work per week, 
harassment and abuse, sexual exploitation, and compensation beneath the minimal 
standard of living leaving no disposable income. These practices were, and are, in some 
cases typical, and certainly not atypical, in many low-wage countries. 
A number of groups in the last decade have contributed to efforts to make global 
supply chains transparent to reporters and citizens, and to develop minimal standards 
of accountability. Among these groups are the National Consumers League, Human 
Rights First, the Maquilla Solidarity Network, the Global Fairness Initiative, the Clean 
Clothes Campaign, the International Labor Organization (UN), and the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA). The FLA is a coalition of business firms with offshore production 
and global supply chains, universities, and private organizations. For member firms,

811
the FLA conducts interviews with workers, makes unannounced visits to factories to 
track progress, and investigates complaints. They are also one of the major interna-
tional labor standard-setting organizations (Fair Labor Association, 2012).
 In March 2012, the FLA released its investigation of Hon Hai Precision Industry 
Company (a Taiwan-based company known as Foxconn), which is the assembler of 
nearly all iPhones and iPads in the world. Foxconn operates what is alleged to be 
the largest factory in the world in Longhua, Shenzhen, where over 250,000 workers 
assemble electronics goods. The audit of working conditions at Foxconn was authorized 
by Apple, a member of the FLA, and was based on 35,000 surveys of workers at the 
Longhua factory. The report found over 50 legal and code violations (sometimes in 
violation of Chinese laws) including requiring too many hours of work a week (over 
60), failing to pay workers for overtime, and hazardous conditions that injured workers 
(Fair Labor Association, 2012). Similar violations of labor standards continue to be 
found in the Middle East and Asia (Fair Labor Association, 2015).
SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS: LEAN, MEAN, AND GREEN
Sustainable business is a call for business to take social and ecological interests, and 
not just corporate profits, into account in all their decision-making throughout the 
firm. No small request. Since the United Nations World Commission on Environment 
and Development (WCED) published the first comprehensive report on sustainable 
business in 1987, firms around the globe have struggled with these concepts and in 
some cases ignored or resisted them as simply a threat to sustained profitability. The 
commission’s report (Our Common Future) argued for a balance of profits, social 
­community development, and minimal impact on the world environment, including 
of course, the carbon footprint of business. Today, the consensus among major firms 
in Europe, Asia, and the United States has become that in the long term, and through 
careful planning, sustainable business and sustainable supply chains are just good 
business because it means using the most efficient environment-regarding means of 
production, distribution, and logistics. These efficient methods create value for con-
sumers, investors, and communities.
Notions of sustainable business have had a powerful impact on supply chain 
thinking. In part, these efforts are good risk management: all advanced countries have 
substantially strengthened their environmental regulations. It makes good business 
sense for firms to prepare methods and operations suitable to this new environment.
For instance, all the major textiles brands and retailers have announced plans for 
a more sustainable supply chain in textiles. One of the world’s truly ancient industries, 
textiles supports millions of workers while consuming extraordinary resources: it takes 
1,000 gallons of water to make one pound of finished cotton (your jeans, for instance). 
While growing cotton has its issues (fertilizer), the subsequent dying, finishing, and 
cleaning of cotton makes it the number one industrial polluter on Earth. It’s not a 
small matter then that Walmart, Gap, Levi’s, Nike, and other large players in the 
industry are taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of their operations by 
improving the efficiency of the entire supply and distribution chains.
With the help of IBM, SAP, and Oracle, other firms and entire industries are 
working to develop sustainable supply chains. McKesson, North America’s largest

distributor of drugs, uses IBM’s Supply Chain Sustainability Management Solution 
(SCSM) to minimize carbon dioxide emissions throughout its supply chain, while low-
ering its distribution costs. SCSM (a business analytics package that works with IBM’s 
B2B software) can determine low-cost refrigeration alternatives for certain medicines 
(such as insulin and vaccines), identify the environmentally least harmful way to bring 
new products into its distribution network, and determine the best way to transport 
pharmaceuticals to customers.
ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI)
As noted in the previous section, B2B e-commerce did not originate with the Internet, 
but in fact has its roots in technologies such as EDI that were first developed in the 
mid-1970s and 1980s. EDI is a broadly defined communications protocol for exchanging 
documents among computers using technical standards developed by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI X12 standards) and international bodies such as 
the United Nations (EDIFACT standards).
EDI was developed to reduce the cost, delays, and errors inherent in the manual 
exchanges of documents such as purchase orders, shipping documents, price lists, 
payments, and customer data. EDI differs from an unstructured message because 
its messages are organized with distinct fields for each of the important pieces of 
information in a commercial transaction such as transaction date, product purchased, 
amount, sender’s name, address, and recipient’s name.
Each major industry in the United States and throughout much of the industrial 
world has EDI industry committees that define the structure and information fields of 
electronic documents for that industry. Estimates indicate that B2B e-commerce EDI 
transactions will total about $3.1 trillion in 2015, about 49% of all B2B e-commerce 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2015; authors’ estimates). In this sense, EDI remains very impor-
tant in the development of B2B e-commerce (Cecere, 2014). 
EDI has evolved significantly since the 1980s (see Figure 12.5). Initially, EDI 
focused on document automation (Stage 1). Procurement agents created purchase 
orders electronically and sent them to trading partners, who in turn shipped order 
fulfillment and shipping notices electronically back to the purchaser. Invoices, pay-
ments, and other documents followed. These early implementations replaced the 
postal system for document transmission, and resulted in same-day shipping of orders 
(rather than a week’s delay caused by the postal system), reduced errors, and lower 
costs. The second stage of EDI development began in the early 1990s, driven largely 
by the automation of internal industrial processes and movement toward just-in-time 
production and continuous production. New methods of production called for greater 
flexibility in scheduling, shipping, and financing of supplies. EDI evolved to become 
a tool for continuous inventory replenishment. EDI was used to eliminate purchase 
orders and other documents entirely, replacing them with production schedules 
and inventory balances. Supplier firms were sent monthly statements of production 
requirements and precise scheduled delivery times, and the orders would be fulfilled 
continuously, with inventory and payments being adjusted at the end of each month.
In the third stage of EDI, beginning in the mid-1990s, suppliers were given 
online access to selected parts of the purchasing firm’s production and delivery 

	 T r e n d s  i n  S u p p l y  C h a i n  M a n a g e m e n t  a n d  C o l l a b o r a t i v e  C o m m e r c e 	

813
schedules, and, under long-term contracts, were required to meet those schedules 
on their own without intervention by firm purchasing agents. Movement toward 
this continuous real-time access model of EDI was spurred in the 1990s by large 
manufacturing and process firms (such as oil and chemical companies) that were 
implementing enterprise systems. These systems required standardization of busi-
ness processes and resulted in the automation of production, logistics, and many 
financial processes. These new processes required much closer relationships with 
suppliers and logistics partners (shipping and ground transporters), who were 
required to be more precise in delivery scheduling and more flexible in inventory 
management. This level of supplier precision could never be achieved economically 
by human purchasing agents. This third stage of EDI enabled the era of continuous 
replenishment. For instance, Walmart and Toys“R”Us provide their suppliers with 
access to their store inventories, and the suppliers are expected to keep the stock 
of items on the shelf within prespecified targets. Similar developments occurred 
in the grocery industry. 
	 FIGURE 12.5	
THE EVOLUTION OF EDI AS A B2B MEDIUM

tool for continuous inventory replenishment.

Today, EDI must be viewed as a general enabling technology that provides for 
the exchange of critical business information between computer applications sup-
porting a wide variety of business processes. EDI is an important industrial network 
technology, suited to support communications among a small set of strategic partners 
in direct, long-term trading relationships. The technical platform of EDI has changed 
from mainframes to personal computers, from corporate data centers to cloud-based 
software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms (described below). EDI is not well suited for the 
development of Net marketplaces, where thousands of suppliers and purchasers meet 
in a digital arena to negotiate prices. EDI supports direct bilateral communications 
among a small set of firms and does not permit the multilateral, dynamic relationships 
of a true marketplace. EDI does not provide for price transparency among a large 
number of suppliers, does not scale easily to include new participants, and is not a 
real-time communications environment. EDI does not have a rich communications 
environment that can simultaneously support e-mail messaging, video conferencing, 
sharing of graphic documents, network meetings, or user-friendly flexible database 
creation and management. 
MOBILE B2B
Just as with B2C commerce, mobile devices have become increasingly important in 
all aspects of B2B e-commerce, through all steps of the procurement process and 
throughout the supply chain. More and more companies have adopted a Bring Your 
Own Device (BYOD) policy, in which employees use their personal smartphone, 
tablet, or laptop computer on the company’s network, which has helped contribute to 
their growing importance in B2B. Cisco estimates that by 2016, mobile traffic will 
represent over 25% of all business Internet traffic, up from less than 5% in 2011 (Cisco 
Systems, Inc., 2015a).
On the procurement front, B2B buyers are increasingly using mobile devices for all 
phases of the purchase process, from discovery to decision-making, to actual purchase. 
One study found that over 50% of B2B decision-makers surveyed used a mobile device 
to research products, equipment, services, and suppliers. B2B buyers want to be able 
to place orders using mobile devices just as they do in the B2C arena, and increasingly 
expect B2B e-commerce sites to be readily accessible from such devices, to be able to 
start an order from a device and finish it on their desktop and vice versa, and to be 
able to get online customer service on their mobile devices (eMarketer, Inc., 2014; 
Forrester Research, 2013). 
On the supply chain front, many supply chain network and software providers are 
enhancing their offerings by providing support for mobile devices and applications. For 
instance, Elementum provides a variety of mobile apps running on a cloud platform 
to track various aspects of the supply chain and enable supply chain visibility. For 
instance, Elementum’s Exposure App enables companies to identify and respond to 
risks in their supply chain, providing real-time alerts on events that may impact the 
supply, manufacture, or distribution of components of their products. Elementum’s 
Perspective App helps companies monitor the health of their supply chain by provid-
ing a dashboard that provides real-time tracking of key performance indicators (KPIs) 
in the supply chain.

B2B IN THE CLOUD
In the traditional approach to B2B enterprise systems, firms build on their existing 
on-premise, enterprise production systems that keep track of their manufacturing 
and distribution processes to include new functionality connecting them to their sup-
pliers’ systems. This is a very expensive process that involves connecting suppliers 
one at a time, establishing the telecommunications channels, and managing the data 
quality issues, not to mention the cost of building the infrastructure of computers and 
telecommunications to support coordination of suppliers and B2B transactions. Cloud 
computing (described in Chapter 2) is increasingly being used to greatly reduce the 
cost of building and maintaining B2B systems. 
In cloud-based B2B systems, much of the expense of B2B systems is shifted from 
the firm to a B2B network provider, sometimes called a data hub or B2B platform (see 
Figure 12.6). The cloud platform owner provides the computing and 
cloud-based B2B 
system 
shifts much of the expense 
of B2B systems from the 
firm to a B2B network 
provider, sometimes called

telecommunications capability; establishes connections with the firm’s partners; pro-
vides software on-demand (software-as-a-service or SaaS) to connect the firm’s systems 
to its partners’ systems; performs data coordination and cleaning; and manages data 
quality for all members. Network effects apply here: the cost of these tasks and capa-
bilities is spread over all members, reducing costs for all. B2B network providers also 
provide communication environments and file storage services that allow partners to 
work together more closely, and to collaborate on improving the flow of goods and 
transactions. B2B network providers charge customers on a demand basis, rather than 
on a percentage of their transactions’ value, depending on their utilization of the 
network. Suppliers of traditional on-premise B2B and supply chain management 
systems have responded by purchasing cloud-based B2B networks in the last few years. 
For instance, SAP purchased Ariba, one of the first and largest cloud-based B2B transac-
tion networks, in 2012 for $4.6 billion. Ariba’s global network automates more than 
$700 billion in commercial transactions, collaborations, and business intelligence 
among a wide range of suppliers, shipping, and logistics firms. SAP, the largest supplier 
of firm enterprise systems, supplies software that supports internal business processes. 
Other B2B network providers include E2Open and GT Nexus. 
Unlike traditional firm-based B2B systems, cloud-based B2B data networks can 
be implemented in short periods of time to respond to corporate mergers and rapidly 
changing markets, as Insight on Technology: Your Shoes Are in the Cloud illustrates. 
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Supply chain simplification, just in time and lean production, focusing on strategic 
partners in the production process, enterprise systems, and continuous inventory 
replenishment are the foundation for contemporary supply chain management (SCM) 
systems. Supply chain management (SCM) systems continuously link the activities 
of buying, making, and moving products from suppliers to purchasing firms, as well 
as integrating the demand side of the business equation by including the order entry 
system in the process. With an SCM system and continuous replenishment, inventory 
is greatly reduced and production begins only when an order is received (see Figure 
12.7). These systems enable just-in-time and lean-production methods. 
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is one of the largest technology companies in the world, 
with sales of $112 billion in 2014. With operations in over 150 countries, sales in 43 
currencies, and 15 languages, HP is truly a global firm with global supply chain issues 
that became even more complicated as HP expanded by making over 200 acquisi-
tions in the last decade. In 2015, HP has the largest supply chain among information 
technology manufacturers. To cope with one of the most complex supply chains in 
the world, HP developed a Web-based, order-driven supply chain management system 
that begins with either a customer placing an order online or the receipt of an order 
from a dealer. The order is forwarded from the order entry system to HP’s production 
and delivery system. From there, the order is routed to one of several HP contractor 
supplier firms. The supplier’s system then verifies the order with HP and validates 
the ordered configuration to ensure the PC can be manufactured (e.g., will not have 
missing parts or fail a design specification set by HP). The order is then forwarded to 
supply chain 
management (SCM)

activities of buying, 
making, and moving

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
YOUR SHOES ARE IN THE CLOUD 
Have you ever worn Keds, Hush 
Puppies, Merrells, Sebagos, Sperry 
Topsiders, or Sauconys? If so, you’ve 
had a product made by Wolverine 
World Wide Inc. on your feet. Although 
you may not be familiar with its name, Wol-
verine is one of the world’s largest designers, 
manufacturers, and marketers of footwear for 
sports, casual wear, and work. The company’s 
business is divided into three segments: its Life-
style Group includes Sperry Topsider, Stride Rite, 
Hush Puppies and Keds. Its Performance Group 
includes Merrell, Saucony, Chaco, and Patago-
nia. The Heritage Group comprises brands such 
as Wolverine, Cat, Bates, Sebago, Harley-David-
son, and HyTest Safety. Wolverine was founded in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1883, and originally 
made the boots that built America’s railroads, sky-
scrapers, and highways. Since then the company 
has expanded largely by purchasing well-known 
name brand manufacturers. The company sells its 
footwear through national retailers, catalog sales, 
and consumer direct businesses at various e-com-
merce Web sites. 
In 2014, Wolverine generated almost $2.8 
billion in revenue. In 2012, it purchased a total 
of four brands, including Saucony and Keds, that 
increased its revenue by $1 billion in a single year. 
The company has 6,600 employees worldwide. 
Today, Wolverine sources production of more than 
100 million pairs of shoes from 110 factories 
located in 20 countries. The company’s major com-
petitors are Nike (the global giant with $28 billion 
in revenue) and Deckers (with $1.8 billion in rev-
enue). The global footwear market is estimated to 
be $248 billion, with a 4.4% annual growth rate. 
Like many global consumer goods manufac-
turers, Wolverine has faced a number of challenges 
in managing its global supply chain with both the 
supply and retail fronts. In the early 2000s, Wol-
verine’s supply chain management capability was 
based on SAP’s BusinessSuite enterprise software. 
The SAP software centralized and consolidated 
its operations across all its brands and created 
an integrated system platform for managing the 
supply chain, customer relationships, orders, and 
financial reporting. However, the system could not 
recognize multiple currencies, languages, or global 
standards. Signing up new suppliers or retail out-
lets was an expensive and sometimes lengthy pro-
cess. Out-of-stock situations were growing as the 
company could not respond to retailer demands 
for specific styles. Matching inventory to actual 
demand was becoming more difficult as fashions 
changed rapidly. Working with global retailers was 
difficult at times because the existing system could 
not work with different languages and currencies. 
Many of the company’s largest global retailers 
were not comfortable transacting in dollars. In 
response, Wolverine expanded its SAP enterprise 
system by adopting the software firm’s SAP Retail 
solutions. This new system had global capabilities 
that enable different languages and currencies 
to be used for transactions and communications. 
The new system also allowed Wolverine managers 
as well as their retail partners to gain increased, 
real-time visibility into consumer demand, supply 
chain, and store operations. As a result, stock outs 
have declined, and revenues at retail stores have 
increased 15 to 25% in various segments. 
On the supplier side of its operations, Wol-
verine also faced significant challenges. Its 2012 
acquisition of Saucony and Keds brought in an 
additional $1 billion worth of transactions to pro-
cess, and might have quickly overwhelmed its 
domestic supply chain’s systems. Its SAP enter-

818	
	
C H A P T E R  1 2     B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e
prise system was a traditional on-prem-
ise, very large system that was designed to 
enhance Wolverine’s supply chain, and not the 
entire ecosystem of manufacturing, logistics, and 
financial firms that work with Wolverine to man-
ufacture and distribute shoes. Wolverine in fact 
had over 200 suppliers in 120 countries that had 
their own supply chain software, and integrating 
them into a single platform was unimaginable, 
costly, and time consuming. There was no easy (or 
inexpensive) way to scale up its existing supply 
chain system to include all its partners, and their 
millions of transactions. It was difficult for its 
global suppliers to sign up to Wolverine’s domes-
tic system, the payment system was outdated, and 
logistics and finance were not supported in the 
existing system. 
For help Wolverine turned to GT Nexus, a 
provider of a cloud-based supply chain platform. 
GT Nexus is a network of supply chain networks 
that allows firms to tie their own supply chain 
systems into a global platform and communicate 
with their partners, who may be manufacturers, 
shipping companies, finance firms, and retailers. 
Unlike with traditional enterprise software, Wol-
verine does not buy the package, or pay monthly 
rental costs, or host the software on its servers. 
Instead, GT Nexus provides an on-demand, pay-
as-you-go, software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. 
Some of the services provided include supplier 
enablement, purchase-to-payment financial track-
ing, tracking of packing and shipping, financing of 
transactions, freight contracting, auditing, docu-
mentation and customs, and in-transit tracking. GT 
Nexus bills itself as an on-demand, cloud-based, 
global supply chain management platform. Cur-
rently, GT Nexus supports supply chain manage-
ment at 25,000 companies, has over 100,000 
users, and manages an estimated $100 billion in 
trades. It also facilitates more than $20 billion 
in payments between buyers and their suppliers 
in 90 countries and in eight currencies. In addi-
tion to Wolverine, GT Nexus customers include 
Adidas, Nike, Caterpillar, Columbia Sportwear, 
DHL, Home Depot, Levi Strauss, Pfizer, and UPS, 
among many others.
Using GT Nexus, Wolverine can provide its 
suppliers, retailers, logistics, and financial partners 
a single login to the global Wolverine supply chain. 
Wolverine managers and their supply partners can 
see the entire supply chain from suppliers of raw 
materials, to manufacturers, transporters, and ulti-
mately retail store orders.
In August 2015, Infor, one of the world’s 
leading suppliers of enterprise resource plan-
ning software, announced that it would acquire 
GT Nexus for $675 million. Infor’s current busi-
ness focuses on applications within an enterprise, 
and it currently counts among its customers 18 
of the top aerospace companies, all of the top 
10 pharmaceutical companies, and 17 of the top 
20 industrial distributors. Adding GT Nexus will 
enable Infor to expand its reach beyond the walls 
of an organization into its supply chain and allow 
businesses to better integrate merchandising, 
marketing, and demand data into supply chain 
management. Infor currently uses Amazon Web 
Services to deliver its cloud SaaS ERP software, 
and plans to add GT Nexus’s software to that 
platform as well.

a computer-based production control system that issues a bar-coded production ticket 
to factory assemblers. Simultaneously, a parts order is forwarded to the supplier’s 
warehouse and inventory management system. A worker assembles the computer, 
and then the computer is boxed, tagged, and shipped to the customer. The delivery is 
monitored and tracked by HP’s supply chain management system, which links directly 
to one of several overnight delivery systems. The elapsed time from order entry to 
shipping is 48 hours. With this system, HP has eliminated the need to hold PCs in 
inventory, reduced cycle time from one week to 48 hours, and reduced errors. HP has 
extended this system to become a global B2B order tracking, reporting, and support 
system for HP B2B customers (Hewlett-Packard, 2014, 2015). 
It isn’t just huge technology companies that use supply chain software. There’s 
nothing quite so perishable as fashionable underwear given the rate of fashion change. 
Under Armour, which is the world’s No. 1 performance athletic brand, uses software 
from SAP to predict sales, plan inventory, and coordinate suppliers (Gilmore, 2014; 
Booen, 2011). Prior to using these tools, Under Armour often missed sales because it 
did not produce enough of popular items, or overproduced items that were not selling.
	 FIGURE 12.7	
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
SCM systems coordinate the activities of suppliers, shippers, and order entry systems to automate order 
entry through production, payment, and shipping business processes. Increasingly customers, as well as 
employees working throughout the supply chain, are using smartphones, tablets, and mobile apps to place 
and coordinate orders.

COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE
Collaborative commerce is a direct extension of supply chain management systems, 
as well as supply chain simplification. Collaborative commerce is defined as the use 
of digital technologies to permit firms to collaboratively design, develop, build, market, 
and manage products through their life cycles. This is a much broader mission than 
EDI or simply managing the flow of information among organizations. ­Collaborative 
commerce involves a definitive move from a transaction focus to a relationship focus 
among the supply chain participants. Rather than having an arm’s-length adversarial 
relationship with suppliers, collaborative commerce fosters sharing of sensitive 
­internal information with suppliers and purchasers. Managing collaborative commerce 
requires knowing exactly what information to share with whom. Collaborative com-
merce extends beyond supply chain management activities to include the collaborative 
development of new products and services by multiple cooperating firms.
A good example of collaborative commerce is the long-term effort of Procter & 
Gamble (P&G), the world’s largest manufacturer of personal and health care products, 
from Crest toothpaste to Tide soap, to work with suppliers and even customers to 
develop 50% of its product line over time. In the past, for instance, P&G would design 
a bottle or product package in-house, and then turn to over 100 suppliers of packaging 
to find out what it would cost and try to bargain that down. Using Ariba’s procurement 
network, P&G asks its suppliers to come up with innovative ideas for packaging and 
pricing. Taking it a step further, P&G’s Web site, Pgconnectdevelop.com, solicits new 
product ideas from suppliers and customers. About 50% of P&G’s new products origi-
nate with substantial input from its suppliers and customers (Vance, 2010). P&G is also 
collaborating with its biggest online customer, Amazon, by co-locating their operations. 
P&G sets aside warehouse space for P&G products purchased by Amazon customers. 
Amazon ships the products to its customers directly from the P&G warehouses rather 
than shipping them first to Amazon warehouses, and then to the consumer. This col-
laboration results in Amazon reducing its costs of shipping and storing goods, becom-
ing more competitive on price compared to Walmart and Costco, and reducing the 
time it takes to arrive at consumers’ homes. For P&G collaboration means savings on 
transportation costs incurred trucking products to Amazon warehouses, and Amazon’s 
help in boosting online sales of P&G products. Other well-known companies using 
collaboration to develop and deliver products include Lego (DesignByMe), Harley 
Davidson, Starbucks, and GE’s Ecomagination program (Carlozo, 2015; Winston, 2014; 
James, 2012; Esposito, 2012).
Although collaborative commerce can involve customers as well as suppliers in the 
development of products, for the most part, it is concerned with the development of a 
rich communications environment to enable inter-firm sharing of designs, production 
plans, inventory levels, delivery schedules, and the development of shared products 
(see Figure 12.8).
Collaborative commerce is very different from EDI, which is a technology for 
structured communications among firms. Collaborative commerce is more like an 
interactive teleconference among members of the supply chain. EDI and collaborative 
commerce share one characteristic: they are not open, competitive marketplaces, but 
collaborative 
commerce
the use of digital 
technologies to permit 
organizations to 
collaboratively design, 
develop, build, and
manage products through 
their life cycles

instead are, technically, private industrial networks that connect strategic partners 
in a supply chain. 
Collaboration 2.0: Cloud, Web, Social, and Mobile 
The technology of collaborative commerce has changed greatly since its inception 
over thirty years ago with tools like Lotus Notes, which was used almost entirely 
within firms to establish an environment where employees could share ideas, notes, 
and ideas, and work on projects together. What’s new about collaboration tools today 
is that the software and data are stored on cloud servers where it is less expensive, 
and easy to update; social networks like Facebook and Twitter are commonly used 
by employees in many firms, while other firms deploy their own social network 
platform; the Web enables very inexpensive collaborative environments; and the  
mobile platform of smartphones and tablets means that collaboration can take place 
in many more places and times (Computerworld, 2015; Gohring, 2014). Collaboration 
technologies have expanded collaboration from a within-the-firm platform to a primary 
tool of inter-firm B2B collaboration. 
Broadband video networks like Cisco’s TelePresence Studios also play a role in 
enabling frequent, long-distance, collaboration among supply chain partners. TelePres-
ence is one of several high-bandwidth video systems from different vendors that give 
users the impression they are sharing ­physical space with other participants who are 
in fact located remotely, sometimes on the other side of the globe. Cisco’s @Cisco­
LiveDesk’s Twitter feed enhances the TelePresence experience by adding face-to-face 
	 FIGURE 12.8	
ELEMENTS OF A COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE SYSTEM
A collaborative commerce application includes a cloud repository where employees at several different firms 
can store engineering drawings and other documents. Workflow software determines who can see this data 
and what rules will apply for displaying the data on individual workstations.

support, scheduling assistance, and demos (Cisco Systems, Inc., 2015b). Using Skype 
video conferencing, even tiny businesses can take advantage of very inexpensive 
collaborative platforms over the Web, or mobile platforms.
In Section 12.5, we discuss collaborative commerce in greater depth as a technol-
ogy that enables private industrial networks.
SOCIAL NETWORKS AND B2B: THE EXTENDED SOCIAL ENTERPRISE
It’s a short step from collaboration with vendors, suppliers, and customers, to a more 
personal relationship based on conversations with participants in the supply chain 
using social networks—both private and public. Here, the conversations and sharing of 
ideas are more unstructured, situational, and personal. Procurement officers, manag-
ers of supply chains, and logistics managers are people too, and they participate in 
the same social network culture provided by Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, 
and a host of other public social networks as we all do. Being able to respond to fast 
moving developments that affect supply chains requires something more than a Web 
site, e-mail, or telephone calls. Social networks can provide the intimate connections 
among customers, suppliers, and logistics partners that are needed to keep the supply 
chain functioning, and to make decisions based on current conditions (Demery, 2015; 
Red Prairie, 2012). 
Participants in the supply chain network are tapping into their tablet computers, 
smartphones, and social network sites for purchasing, scheduling, exception handling, 
and deciding with their B2B customers and suppliers. In many cases, supply chain 
social networks are private—owned by the largest firm in the supply chain network. 
In other cases, firms develop Facebook pages to organize conversations among supply 
chain network members. 
Some examples of social B2B include TradeSpace, a UK-based business social 
network where business people can share experiences and ideas, and buy and sell 
products. Cisco is using its Web site and Facebook pages to run new product campaigns 
for its business customers using social networks exclusively. Dell, like many busi-
nesses, uses its YouTube channel to engage suppliers and customers in conversations 
about existing products, and ideas for new products. Social networks are beginning to 
be common tools for managers engaged in B2B commerce. Public social network sites 
like Facebook and Twitter can be excellent for coordinating the flow of information 
among business partners through the supply chain. 
	12.4	 NET MARKETPLACES
One of the most compelling visions of B2B e-commerce is that of an online market-
place that would bring thousands of fragmented suppliers into contact with hundreds 
of major purchasers of industrial goods for the purpose of conducting frictionless com-
merce. The hope was that these suppliers would compete with one another on price, 
transactions would be automated and low cost, and as a result, the price of industrial

supplies would fall. By extracting fees from buyers and sellers on each transaction, 
third-party intermediary market makers could earn significant revenues. These Net 
marketplaces could scale easily as volume increased by simply adding more computers 
and communications equipment.
In pursuit of this vision, well over 1,500 Net marketplaces sprang up in the early 
days of e-commerce. Unfortunately, many of them have since disappeared but some 
still survive, and they are joined by other types of Net marketplaces—some private 
and some public—based on different assumptions that are quite successful.
CHARACTERISTICS OF NET MARKETPLACES
There is a confusing variety of Net marketplaces today, and several different ways 
to classify them. For instance, some writers classify Net marketplaces on the basis of 
their pricing mechanisms—auction, bid/ask, negotiated price, and fixed prices—while 
others classify markets based on characteristics of the markets they serve (vertical 
versus horizontal, or sell-side versus buy-side), or ownership (industry-owned consortia 
versus independent third-party intermediaries). Table 12.3 describes some of the 
important characteristics of Net marketplaces.
TYPES OF NET MARKETPLACES
Although each of these distinctions helps describe the phenomenon of Net market-
places, they do not focus on the central business functionality provided, nor are they 
capable by themselves of describing the variety of Net marketplaces.
In Figure 12.9, we present a classification of Net marketplaces that focuses on 
their business functionality; that is, what these Net marketplaces provide for ­businesses 
seeking solutions. We use two dimensions of Net marketplaces to create a four-cell 
classification table. We differentiate Net marketplaces as providing either ­indirect 
goods (goods used to support production) or direct goods (goods used in produc-
tion), and we distinguish markets as providing either contractual purchasing (where 

824	
	
C H A P T E R  1 2     B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e
purchases take place over many years according to a contract between the firm and its 
vendor) or spot purchasing (where purchases are episodic and ­anonymous—vendors 
and buyers do not have an ongoing relationship and may not know one another). The 
intersection of these dimensions produces four main types of Net ­marketplaces that 
are relatively straightforward: e-distributors, e-procurement networks, exchanges, and 
industry consortia. Note, however, that in the real world, some Net marketplaces can 
be found in multiple parts of this figure as business models change and opportunities 
appear and disappear. Nevertheless, the discussion of “pure types” of Net marketplaces 
is a useful starting point.
Each of these Net marketplaces seeks to provide value to customers in different 
ways. We discuss each type of Net marketplace in more detail in the following sections.
E-distributors
E-distributors are the most common and most easily understood type of Net market-
place. An e-distributor provides an online catalog that represents the products of

PURE TYPES OF NET MARKETPLACES
There are four main types of Net marketplaces based on the intersection of two dimensions: how businesses 
buy and what they buy. A third dimension—horizontal versus vertical markets—also distinguishes the 
different types of Net marketplaces.

E-DISTRIBUTORS
E-distributors are firms that bring the products of thousands of suppliers into a single online catalog for sale 
to thousands of buyer firms. E-distributors are sometimes referred to as one-to-many markets, one seller 
serving many firms.
thousands of direct manufacturers (see Figure 12.10). E-distributors are indepen-
dently owned intermediaries that offer industrial customers a single source from 
which to order indirect goods (often referred to as MRO) on a spot, as-needed basis. A 
significant percentage of corporate purchases cannot be satisfied under a company’s 
existing contracts, and must be purchased on a spot basis. E-distributors make money 
by charging a markup on products they distribute.
Organizations and firms in all industries require MRO supplies. The MRO func-
tion maintains, repairs, and operates commercial buildings and maintains all the 
machinery of these buildings from heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems 
to lighting fixtures.
E-distributors operate in horizontal markets because they serve many different 
industries with products from many different suppliers. E-distributors usually operate 
public markets in the sense that any firm can order from the catalog, as opposed to 
private markets, where membership is restricted to selected firms.
E-distributor prices are usually fixed, but large customers receive discounts and 
other incentives to purchase, such as credit, reporting on account activity, and limited 
forms of business purchasing rules (for instance, no purchases greater than $500 for 
a single item without a purchase order). The primary benefits offered to industrial 
customers are lower search costs, lower transaction costs, wide selection, rapid deliv-
ery, and low prices.

826	
	
C H A P T E R  1 2     B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e
W.W. Grainger is one of the most frequently cited examples of an e-distributor. 
Grainger is involved in long-term systematic sourcing as well as spot sourcing, but 
its emphasis is on spot sourcing. Grainger’s business model is to become the world’s 
leading source of MRO suppliers, and its revenue model is that of a typical retailer: it 
owns the products, and takes a markup on the products it sells to customers. Grainger’s 
Web site and mobile apps provide users with a digital version of Grainger’s famous 
seven-pound catalog, plus other parts not available in the catalog (adding up to around 
900,000 parts), as well as a complete ordering and payment system. In 2014, Grainger 
recorded $2.8 billion in e-commerce revenues (28% of its total sales), up 13% from 
2013 (W.W. Grainger Inc., 2015). McMaster-Carr, a New Jersey-based industrial parts 
mecca for machinists and manufacturers around the world, is a similar e-distributor. 
In 2013, Amazon also entered the B2B distributor market with AmazonSupply, aiming 
to leverage its global B2C fulfillment infrastructure into the B2B arena, and in 2015, 
rebranded it as Amazon Business. Other examples of e-distributors include B2Buy and 
NeweggBusiness.
E-procurement
An e-procurement Net marketplace is an independently owned intermediary that 
connects hundreds of online suppliers offering millions of maintenance and repair 
parts to business firms who pay fees to join the market (see Figure 12.11).

­purchasing of indirect goods (MRO); they create online horizontal markets, but they 
also provide for members’ spot sourcing of MRO supplies. E-procurement companies 
make money by ­charging a percentage of each transaction, licensing consulting 
services and software, and ­assessing network use fees (Trkman and McCormack, 
2010).
E-procurement companies expand on the business model of simpler e-distributors 
by including the online catalogs of hundreds of suppliers and offering value chain 
management services to both buyers and sellers. Value chain management (VCM) 
services provided by e-procurement companies include automation of a firm’s entire 
procurement process on the buyer side and automation of the selling business 
­processes on the seller side. For purchasers, e-procurement companies automate 
­purchase orders, requisitions, sourcing, business rules enforcement, invoicing, and 
payment. For ­suppliers, e-procurement companies provide catalog creation and 
content management, order management, fulfillment, invoicing, shipment, and 
settlement.
E-procurement Net marketplaces are sometimes referred to as many-to-many 
markets. They are mediated by an independent third party that purports to represent 
both buyers and sellers, and hence claim to be neutral. On the other hand, because 
they may include the catalogs of both competing suppliers and competing e-distribu-
tors, they likely have a bias in favor of the buyers. Nevertheless, by aggregating huge 
buyer firms into their networks, they provide distinct marketing benefits for suppliers 
and reduce customer acquisition costs.
Ariba stands out as one of the poster children of the B2B age, a firm born before 
its time. Promising to revolutionize inter-firm trade, Ariba started out in 1996 hoping 
to build a global business network linking buyers and sellers—sort of an eBay for busi-
ness. With little revenue, the stock shot past $1,000 a share by March 2000. But sellers 
and buyers did not join the network in large part because they did not understand 
the opportunity, were too wedded to their traditional procurement processes, and did 
not trust outsiders to control their purchasing and vendor relationship. In September 
2001, Ariba’s share price tanked to $2.20. Ariba survived largely by selling software 
that helped large firms understand their procurement processes and costs. Finally, by 
2008, large and small firms had become more sophisticated in their purchasing and 
supply change management practices, and Ariba’s original idea of a global network 
of suppliers and purchasers of a wide variety of industrial goods came back to life. In 
2012, SAP, the largest enterprise software firm, purchased Ariba for $4.3 billion in an 
effort to strengthen its B2B e-commerce suite. Today, Ariba (now owned by SAP AG) 
is a leading provider of collaborative business commerce solutions that includes an 
e-procurement Net marketplace called the Ariba Supplier Network. Other players in 
this market segment include Perfect Commerce, BravoSolution, A.T. Kearney Procure-
ment & Analytic Solutions, and IBM Emptoris Sourcing.

(see Figure 12.12). Although there are exceptions, exchanges generally create vertical 
markets that focus on the spot-purchasing requirements of large firms in a single 
industry, such as computers and telecommunications, electronics, food, and industrial 
equipment. Exchanges were the prototype Internet-based marketplace in the early 
days of e-commerce; as noted previously, over 1,500 were created in this period, but 
most have failed.
Exchanges make money by charging a commission on the transaction. The pricing 
model can be through an online negotiation, auction, RFQ, or fixed buy-and-sell prices. 
The benefits offered to customers of exchanges include reduced search cost for parts 
and spare capacity. Other benefits include lower prices created by a global marketplace 
driven by competition among suppliers who would, presumably, sell goods at very low 
profit margins at one world-market price. The benefits offered suppliers are access to 
a global purchasing environment and the opportunity to unload production overruns 
(although at very competitive prices and low profit margins). Even though they are 
private intermediaries, exchanges are public in the sense of permitting any bona fide 
buyer or seller to participate.
Exchanges tend to be biased toward the buyer even though they are independently 
owned and presumably neutral. Suppliers are disadvantaged by the fact that exchanges 
put them in direct price competition with other similar suppliers around the globe, 
driving profit margins down. Exchanges have failed primarily because suppliers have

EXCHANGES
Independent exchanges bring potentially thousands of suppliers to a vertical (industry-specific) marketplace 
to sell their goods to potentially thousands of buyer firms. Exchanges are sometimes referred to as many-to-
many markets because they have many suppliers serving many buyer firms.

refused to join them, and hence, the existing markets have very low liquidity, defeating 
the very purpose and benefits of an exchange. Liquidity is typically measured by the 
number of buyers and sellers in a market, the volume of transactions, and the size of 
transactions. You know a market is liquid when you can buy or sell just about any size 
order at just about any time you want. On all of these measures, many exchanges 
failed, resulting in a very small number of participants, few trades, and small trade 
value per transaction. The most common reason for not using exchanges is the absence 
of traditional, trusted suppliers.
While most exchanges tend to be vertical marketplaces offering direct supplies, 
some exchanges offer indirect inputs as well, such as electricity and power, transporta-
tion services (usually to the transportation industry), and professional services. Table 
12.4 lists a few examples of some current independent exchanges.
The following capsule descriptions of two exchanges provide insight into their 
origins and current functions.
Global Wine & Spirits (GWS) is unique among independent exchanges, not only as 
a start-up that has managed to survive, but also as a latecomer to the B2B e-commerce 
community. GWS opened in 1999, but did not begin to trade products online until May 
2001. Based in Montreal, Quebec, GWS is operated by Mediagrif Interactive Technolo-
gies Inc., a Canadian company that operates a number of independent exchanges in a 
variety of industries. GWS offers a spot marketplace for wines, where wine and spirit 
producers offer wines for sale; a call for tenders market, where members make offers 
to purchase wines and spirits; a trade database with listings of thousands of industry 
professionals; and a wine and spirits catalog with over 35,000 products and 6,700 
companies (Globalwinespirits.com, 2015).
Inventory Locator Service (ILS) has its roots as an offline intermediary, serving 
as a listing service for aftermarket parts in the aerospace industry. Upon opening in 
1979, ILS initially provided a telephone and fax-based directory of aftermarket parts to 
airplane owners and mechanics, along with government procurement professionals. 
As early as 1984, ILS incorporated e-mail capabilities as part of its RFQ services, and 
by 1998, it had begun to conduct online auctions for hard-to-find parts. In 2015, ILS 
maintains an Internet-accessible database of over 85 million aerospace and marine 
industry parts, and has also developed an eRFQ feature that helps users streamline

their sourcing processes. The network’s 23,000 subscribers in 93 different countries 
access the site over 75,000 times a day (Inventory Locator Service, 2015).
Industry Consortia
An industry consortium is an industry-owned vertical market that enables buyers 
in the industry to purchase direct inputs (both goods and services) (see Figure 12.13). 
Industry consortia emphasize long-term contractual purchasing, the development of 
stable relationships (as opposed to merely an anonymous transaction emphasis), and 
the creation of industry-wide data standards and synchronization efforts. Industry 
consortia are more focused on optimizing long-term supply relationships than inde-
pendent exchanges, which tend to focus more on short-term transactions. The ultimate 
objective of industry consortia is the unification of supply chains within entire indus-
tries, across many tiers, through common data definitions, network standards, and 
computing platforms. 
Industry consortia sprang up in part as a reaction to the development of inde-
pendently owned exchanges, which were viewed by large industries (such as the

	 FIGURE 12.13	
INDUSTRY CONSORTIA
Industry consortia bring thousands of suppliers into direct contact with a smaller number of very large 
buyers. The market makers provide value-added software services for procurement, transaction 
management, shipping, and payment for both buyers and suppliers. Industry consortia are sometimes 
referred to as many-to-few markets, where many suppliers (albeit selected by the buyers) serve a few very 
large buyers, mediated by a variety of value-added services.

automotive and chemical industries) as market interlopers that would not directly 
serve the interests of large buyers, but would instead line their own pockets and 
those of their venture capital investors. Rather than “pay-to-play,” large firms decided 
to “pay-to-own” their markets. Another concern of large firms was that Net market-
places would work only if large suppliers and buyers participated, and only if there 
was liquidity. Independent exchanges were not attracting enough players to achieve 
liquidity. In addition, exchanges often failed to provide additional value-added services 
that would transform the value chain for the entire industry, including linking the 
new marketplaces to firms’ ERP systems. 
Industry consortia make money in a number of ways. Industry members usually 
pay for the creation of the consortia’s capabilities and contribute initial operating 
capital. Then industry consortia charge buyer and seller firms transaction and sub-
scription fees. Industry members—both buyers and sellers—are expected to reap 
benefits far greater than their contributions through the rationalization of the procure-
ment process, competition among vendors, and closer relationships with vendors.
Industry consortia offer many different pricing mechanisms, ranging from 
­auctions to fixed prices to RFQs, depending on the products and the situation. Prices 
can also be negotiated, and the environment, while competitive, is nevertheless 
restricted to a smaller number of buyers—selected, reliable, and long-term suppliers 
who are often viewed as strategic industry partners. The bias of industry consortia is 
clearly toward the large buyers who control access to this lucrative market channel 
and can benefit from competitive pricing offered by alternative suppliers. Benefits to 
suppliers come from access to large buyer firm procurement systems, long-term stable 
relationships, and large order sizes.
Industry consortia can force suppliers to use the consortia’s ­networks and propri-
etary software as a condition of selling to the industry’s members. Although exchanges 
failed for a lack of suppliers and liquidity, the market power of consortia members 
ensures suppliers will participate, so consortia may be able to avoid the fate of vol-
untary exchanges. Clearly, industry consortia are at an advantage when compared to 
independent exchanges because, unlike the venture-capital-backed exchanges, they 
have deep-pocket financial backing from the very start and guaranteed liquidity based 
on a steady flow of large firm orders. Yet industry consortia are a relatively new 
phenomenon, and the long-term profitability of these consortia, especially when 
several consortia exist for a single industry, has yet to be demonstrated. In fact, the 
number of firms that can be defined as purely industry consortia has declined since 
the early 2000s, with many firms broadening their mission to encompass more than 
one industry, or more commonly, being sold by the original industry founders to 
private investors. For example, GHX, originally founded in 2000 by companies in the 
pharmaceutical and medical supply industry, is now owned by a private equity firm. 
E2open, originally founded by IBM, Seagate, and Hitachi as an industry consortium for 
companies in the high technology industries, has since become a public company and 
now provides a cloud-based B2B platform and services for a wide variety of industries. 
However, a number of industry consortia do remain. One example is The Seam, 
which was founded in 2000 by leading global agribusiness companies such as Cargill, 
Louis Dreyfus, and others. The Seam focused initially on creating a cotton trading 

832

exchange, and has since added peanuts, grains, and excess USDA farm commodities. 
The Seam has handled over $4 billion in transactions since inception and more than 
90% of the cotton buyers in the United States are active participants in its Cotton 
Trading system. Table 12.5 lists some additional examples.
	12.5	 PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS
Private industrial networks today form the largest part of B2B e-commerce, both on and 
off the Internet. Industry analysts estimate that in 2015, over 50% of B2B expenditures 
by large firms will be for the development of private industrial networks. Private 
industrial networks can be considered the foundation of the extended enterprise, 
allowing firms to extend their boundaries and their business processes to include 
supply chain and logistics partners.
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, private industrial networks are direct 
descendants of existing EDI networks, and they are closely tied to existing ERP systems 
used by large firms. A private industrial network (sometimes referred to as a private 
trading exchange, or PTX) is a Web-enabled network for the coordination of trans-
organizational business processes (sometimes also called collaborative commerce). A 
trans-organizational business process requires at least two independent firms to 
perform (Laudon and Laudon, 2014). For the most part, these networks originate in 
and closely involve the manufacturing and related support industries, and therefore 
we refer to them as industrial networks, although in the future they could just as easily 
apply to some services. Private industrial networks can be viewed as extended enter-
prises in the sense that they often begin as ERP systems in a single firm, and are then 
expanded to include (often using an extranet) the firm’s major suppliers. Figure 12.14 
illustrates a private industrial network originally built by Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 
the United States to coordinate supply chains among its suppliers, distributors, truck-
ers, and retailers.
In P&G’s private industrial network shown in Figure 12.14, customer sales are 
captured at the cash register, which then initiates a flow of information back to dis-
tributors, P&G, and its suppliers. This tells P&G and its suppliers the exact level of 
demand for thousands of products. This information is then used to initiate production, 
trans-organizational

least two independent 
firms to perform

supply, and transportation to replenish products at the distributors and retailers. This 
process is called an efficient customer response system (a demand-pull production 
model), and it relies on an equally efficient supply chain management system to 
coordinate the supply side (Gartner, Inc., 2015).
GE, Dell, Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, Nike, Coca-Cola, Walmart, Nokia, and Hewlett-
Packard are among the firms operating successful private industrial networks.
OBJECTIVES OF PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS
The specific objectives of a private industrial network include:
•	 Developing efficient purchasing and selling business processes industry-wide
•	 Developing industry-wide resource planning to supplement enterprise-wide 
resource planning
•	 Increasing supply chain visibility—knowing the inventory levels of buyers and suppliers
•	 Achieving closer buyer-supplier relationships, including demand forecasting, com-
munications, and conflict resolution
•	 Operating on a global scale—globalization
•	 Reducing risk by preventing imbalances of supply and demand, including develop-
ing financial derivatives, insurance, and futures markets
Private industrial networks serve different goals from Net marketplaces. Net mar-
ketplaces are primarily transaction-oriented, whereas private industrial networks focus 
on continuous business process coordination between companies. This can include 
much more than just supply chain management, such as product design, sourcing, 
demand forecasting, asset management, sales, and marketing. Private industrial net-
works do support transactions, but that is not their primary focus.

Private industrial networks usually focus on a single sponsoring company that 
“owns” the network, sets the rules, establishes governance (a structure of authority, 
rule enforcement, and control), and invites firms to participate at its sole discretion. 
Therefore, these networks are private. This sets them apart from industry consortia, 
which are usually owned by major firms collectively through equity participation. 
Whereas Net marketplaces have a strong focus on indirect goods and services, private 
industrial networks focus on strategic, direct goods and services.
For instance, True Value is one of the largest retailer-owned hardware coop-
eratives with operations in 54 countries, 4,500 stores, and 12 regional distribution 
centers. The logistics are staggering to consider: they routinely process over 60,000 
domestic inbound loads, and over 600 million pounds of freight. True Value imports 
roughly 3,500 containers through 20 international ports and 10 domestic ports. The 
existing inbound supply chain system was fragmented, did not permit real-time track-
ing of packages, and when shipments were short or damaged, could not alert stores. 
The supply chain was “invisible”: suppliers could not see store inventory levels, and 
stores could not see supplier shipments. Using a Web-based solution from Sterling 
Commerce (an IBM company), True Value created its own private industrial network 
to which all suppliers, shippers, and stores have access. The network focuses on three 
processes: domestic prepaid shipping, domestic collect, and international direct ship-
ping. For each process the network tracks in real time the movement of goods from 
suppliers to shippers, warehouses, and stores. The system has led to a 57% reduction 
in lead time needed for orders, a 10% increase in the fill rate of orders, and an 85% 
reduction in back orders. If goods are delayed, damaged, or unavailable, the system 
alerts all parties automatically (True Value, 2015; IBM, 2011). 
Perhaps no single firm better illustrates the benefits of developing private indus-
trial networks than Walmart, described in Insight on Business: Walmart Develops a 
Private Industrial Network.
PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS AND COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE
Private industrial networks can do much more than just serve a supply chain and effi-
cient customer response system. They can also include other activities of a single large 
manufacturing firm, such as design of products and engineering diagrams, as well as 
marketing plans and demand forecasting. Collaboration among businesses can take 
many forms and involve a wide range of activities—from simple supply chain manage-
ment to coordinating market feedback to designers at supply firms (see Figure 12.15).
One form of collaboration—and perhaps the most profound—is industry-wide 
collaborative resource planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR), which 
involves working with network members to forecast demand, develop production 
plans, and coordinate shipping, warehousing, and stocking activities to ensure that 
retail and wholesale shelf space is replenished with just the right amount of goods. If 
this goal is achieved, hundreds of millions of dollars of excess inventory and capacity 
could be wrung out of an industry. This activity alone is likely to produce the largest 
benefits and justify the cost of developing private industrial networks.
A second area of collaboration is demand chain visibility. In the past, it was ­impossible 
to know where excess capacity or supplies existed in the supply and ­distribution chains.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
WALMART DEVELOPS A PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL 
NETWORK 
Walmart is a leader in the appli-
cation of information technology to 
coordinate its supply chain. Walmart’s 
supply chain is the secret sauce behind 
its claim of offering the lowest every-
day prices. Walmart is able to make this prom-
ise because it has possibly the most efficient B2B 
supply chain in the world. It also doesn’t hurt to 
be the largest purchaser of consumer goods in the 
world. With sales of $482 billion in 2014, Walmart 
has been able to use information technology to 
achieve a decisive cost advantage over competitors. 
As you might imagine, the world’s largest retailer 
also has the world’s largest supply chain, with more 
than 100,000 suppliers worldwide. In the United 
States, Walmart has more than 5,200 retail stores 
(including Sam’s Clubs). The larger stores stock as 
many as 200,000 different items. Internationally, 
Walmart has over 6,200 additional stores in 27 
countries, giving it a total of over 11,500. 
In the late 1980s, Walmart developed the 
beginnings of collaborative commerce using an 
EDI-based SCM system that required its large sup-
pliers to use Walmart’s proprietary EDI network 
to respond to orders from Walmart purchasing 
managers. In 1991, Walmart expanded the capa-
bilities of its EDI-based network by introducing 
Retail Link. This system connected Walmart’s larg-
est suppliers to Walmart’s own inventory manage-
ment system and required large suppliers to track 
actual sales by stores and to replenish supplies as 
dictated by demand and following rules imposed 
by Walmart. 
In 1997, Walmart moved Retail Link to an 
extranet that allowed suppliers to directly link 
over the Internet into Walmart’s inventory man-
agement system. In 2000, Walmart hired an out-
side firm to upgrade Retail Link from being a 
supply chain management tool toward a more col-
laborative forecasting, planning, and replenishment 
(CFPR) system. Using demand aggregation soft-
ware, Walmart purchasing agents were now able 
to aggregate demand from all of Walmart’s sepa-
rate stores in the United States into a single RFQ 
from suppliers. This gave Walmart tremendous 
clout with even the largest suppliers. The software 
helped Walmart ­purchasing agents select a winning 
bid and negotiate final contracts. In addition, the 
software enabled suppliers to immediately access 
information on inventories, purchase orders, invoice 
status, and sales forecasts, based on 104 weeks of 
data, with data available by item, by store, and by 
hour. The system did not require smaller ­supplier 
firms to adopt expensive EDI ­software solutions. 
Instead, they could use standard browsers and PCs 
loaded with free software from Walmart. In 2002, 
Walmart switched to an entirely Internet-based 
version of EDI, and the result was a radical reduc-
tion in communications costs. 
Beginning in 2012, and continuing through 
2015, Walmart began a transition to a new supply 
and inventory management platform called Retail 
Link 2.0 or Global Replenishment System (GRS). 
It has currently been deployed to about 80 vendors, 
with the goal to bring all vendors on board by the 
end of 2015, and close down the existing Retail 
Link by 2018. Retail Link 2.0 has all the func-
tionality of the first Retail Link and builds on that 
foundation with real-time, online data and analyt-
ics that is available over the Web to vendors and 
employees. 
Retail Link 2.0 uses Microsoft SharePoint, 
which is a collaborative Web-based collection of 
software services that can store and share docu-
ments, keep track of changes, and provide corpo-
rate search and enterprise social networking tools 

836	
	
C H A P T E R  1 2     B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e
to connect employees with one another. 
SharePoint is integrated with Office 365. In 
Walmart’s Retail Link 2.0, the SharePoint plat-
form is used to create an online Web-based facil-
ity that enables vendors to respond to orders, track 
shipments, and sales in a near-real time manner. 
Vendors and Walmart managers can use busi-
ness intelligence tools to predict sales rather than 
simply react to empty shelves or low inventory. 
The transition to Retail Link 2.0 requires a 
massive retraining effort for Walmart’s 100,000 
suppliers, and tens of thousands of Walmart man-
agers. Problems have developed in the supply chain 
as the number of new products in stores has mush-
roomed. Without a history of sales that can be used 
to predict future sales, some stores have too much 
inventory, and others not enough. 
Despite its success in building a world-class 
supply chain to support its retail stores, Walmart 
was not well prepared to deal with online sales 
or to compete with the online champion, Amazon. 
From the beginning, Walmart separated out its 
fledgling e-commerce operation as a separate 
company with a much lower priority for invest-
ment than its physical stores. It was late to invest 
in an Internet supply chain because the separate 
companies could never agree on whether it was a 
good investment. As a result, Walmart’s Internet 
supply chain remains a work in progress, relying 
on employees at some of the stores to pick online 
orders and ship from the store, while other orders 
are handled by a few Internet order warehouses. 
Last year, Walmart had $12 billion in online sales 
(compared to Amazon’s $79 billion), representing 
only about 2% of its $482 billion in sales. In 2013, 
Walmart finally began creating a new inventory 
and logistics system that will combine the inven-
tory information from its stores and warehouses 
and then decide the most efficient way to pick and 
ship online orders. 
Like other large global firms, Walmart’s global 
supply chain has been criticized for exploiting labor 
in underdeveloped countries where it buys products 
and in home markets where it sells them, bribing 
officials to look the other way, destroying environ-
ments, and wasting energy. In response to critics, 
Walmart has taken a number of steps. Walmart has 
set a goal of reducing carbon emissions in its supply 
chain by 20 million metric tons by 2015, and a 
goal of 100% renewable energy use in the United 
States. Walmart has made less progress in its labor 
policies: In 2012, the ABP pension fund blacklisted 
Walmart for failing to comply with the United 
Nations’ Global Compact principles that include a 
set of core values relating to human rights, labor 
standards, the environment, and anti-corruption 
efforts. In 2014, the National Labor Relations 
Board issued a complaint against Walmart claim-
ing that it had illegally retaliated against workers 
who took part in protests about working conditions 
and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into 
allegations that Walmart bribed Mexican officials 
to expand its stores and supply chain in Mexico 
remains ongoing. In 2015, to counter critics of its 
labor policies, Walmart launched a billion dollar 
program to raise wages, improve health care poli-
cies, and improve scheduling or work.

For instance, retailers might have significantly overstocked shelves, but suppliers and 
manufacturers—not knowing this—might be building excess capacity or supplies for even 
more production. These excess inventories would raise costs for the entire industry and 
create extraordinary pressures to discount merchandise, reducing profits for everyone.
A third area of collaboration is marketing coordination and product design. Manu-
facturers that use or produce highly engineered parts use private industrial networks 
to coordinate both their internal design and marketing activities, as well as related 
activities of their supply and distribution chain partners. By involving their suppliers 
in product design and marketing initiatives, manufacturing firms can ensure that the 
parts produced actually fulfill the claims of marketers. On the reverse flow, feedback 
from customers can be used by marketers to speak directly to product designers at the 
firm and its suppliers. For the first time, closed loop marketing (customer feedback 
directly impacting design and production) can become a reality.
IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS
Although private industrial networks represent a large part of the future of B2B, there 
are many barriers to its complete implementation. Participating firms are required to 
share sensitive data with their business partners, up and down the supply chain. What in 
	 FIGURE 12.15	
PIECES OF THE COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE PUZZLE
Collaborative commerce involves many cooperative activities among supply and sales firms closely 
interacting with a single large firm through a private industrial network.

the past was considered proprietary and secret must now be shared. In a digital environ-
ment, it can be difficult to control the limits of information sharing. Information a firm 
freely gives to its largest customer may end up being shared with its closest competitor.
Integrating private industrial networks into existing enterprise systems and EDI 
networks poses a significant investment of time and money. The leading providers 
of enterprise systems to Fortune 500 companies (Oracle, IBM, and SAP) do offer 
B2B modules, and supply chain management capabilities, that can be added to their 
­existing software suites. Nevertheless, implementing these modules is a very expen-
sive proposition in part because the procurement side of many Fortune 500 firms is 
so fragmented and out-of-date. For smaller firms, cloud computing and software as a 
service (SaaS) alternatives are appearing on the market, which offer far less-expensive 
supply chain management capabilities.
Adopting private industrial networks also requires a change in mindset and behav-
ior for employees. Essentially, employees must shift their loyalties from the firm to the 
wider trans-organizational enterprise and recognize that their fate is intertwined with 
the fate of their suppliers and distributors. Suppliers in turn are required to change the 
way they manage and allocate their resources because their own production is tightly 
coupled with the demands of their private industrial network partners. All participants 
in the supply and distribution chains, with the exception of the large network owner, 
lose some of their independence, and must initiate large behavioral change programs 
in order to participate (Laudon and Laudon, 2014).

Cooperation, Collaboration, and Community
I
t may seem unusual to refer to an entire industry as a community, a word 
reserved typically for collections of people who more or less know one another. 
Trade associations are one example of an industrial community. Trade associa-
tions form in an effort to pursue the interests of all members in the community 
although usually they do not include customers in the community. Elemica is a B2B 
cloud-based, supply chain platform aiming to revolutionize the entire supply chain 
of the chemical, tire and rubber, energy, and other process industries worldwide. 
Elemica’s purpose is not just to foster cooperation on a one-to-one inter-firm basis, 
or just to foster collaboration on multi-firm projects, but instead to lift all boats on an 
industry tide by providing an inter-firm platform for communicating B2B informa-
tion, and thereby making all firms more efficient. Elemica calls itself a supply chain 
operating network ecosystem. Elemica is one of the few survivors of the early B2B 
e-commerce years. Elemica today processes approximately $350 billion in annual 
transactions across more than 7,500 process industry trading partners.  Clients include 
BASF, BP, Continental, The Dow Chemical Company, DuPont, The Goodyear Tire & 
Rubber Company, LANXESS, Michelin, Shell, Solvay, Sumitomo Chemical, and Wacker.
Elemica was founded by 22 leading corporations in the chemical industry (includ-
ing oil and industrial gases) to provide cloud-based order management and supply 
chain applications and services. A single platform provides one-stop shopping so that 
companies can buy and sell products to one another through their own enterprise 
systems or using a Web alternative. It also helps companies automate all of their busi-
ness processes, creating efficiencies and economies of scale that lead to an improved 
bottom line.
How does Elemica achieve community among a diverse, global collection of firms 
where firms are often both customers and vendors to one another? It unites commu-
nity members by linking together their enterprise systems. This is the “social glue” that 
sets Elemica apart. This “super platform” permits companies to communicate with one 
another and to conduct transactions, handle logistics, and keep the books. The Elemica 
commerce platform has effectively standardized industry business transactions for 
all network members regardless of the type of enterprise system they have, and it’s 
leveled the playing field for trade partners who are less technically sophisticated. This 
neutral platform facilitates millions of transactions for industry suppliers, customers, 
and third-party providers. In this sense, Elemica is one of the most sophisticated 
technology platforms in the B2B space.
One of the largest investments for a company is its enterprise system. Despite 
these investments, intercompany relationships—the backbone of its supply chain—are 
often left to outdated and unreliable processes. These shortcomings cost billions in lost

productivity, revenue, and profit. Elemica’s eCommerce platform changes that. It helps 
its clients leverage their enterprise system investment by incorporating transactions 
to external trade partners. Elemica’s QuickLink ERP connectivity enables companies 
to link their internal IT systems through a neutral platform so that information is 
moved into each company’s database while maintaining confidentiality and security. 
The chemical and oil industries were among the first users of enterprise systems 
(referred to in the early years as manufacturing resource planning systems). These 
large-scale systems were developed by single firms in order to rationalize and control 
the manufacturing process. They achieved this objective by identifying the outputs, 
inputs, and processes involved in manufacturing and automating key elements includ-
ing inventory control and planning, process control, warehousing and storage, and 
shipping/logistics. If a company needed to produce 10 tons of polyethylene plastic, 
its enterprise system could tell it precisely how many tons of petrochemical inputs 
were required, when they should be delivered to manufacturing, the machinery and 
labor force required to manufacture the product, how long it would take, where it 
would be stored, and sometimes how it would be shipped. The systems can estimate 
the cost at any stage.
Elemica facilitates transactions of all types including order processing and 
billing, and logistics management. However, unlike some other companies in the 
field, Elemica does not buy, sell, or own raw material products. Instead it acts as an 
intermediary, or network, linking companies together to automate confidential trans-
actions. Like eBay or a credit card company, Elemica’s revenue comes from charging 
transaction fees on a per-transaction basis. Its network of clients opens the door for 
companies to do business with all other connected buyers and sellers.
Elemica offers a variety of services for suppliers, customers, and logistic partners, 
enabling them to automate both their business processes and internal purchasing. A 
modular, cloud-based solution simplifies sales, procurement, and financial processes; 
integrates supply chain partners to diminish communication barriers; and reduces 
overhead and errors.
Elemica integrates information flow among global trading partners using a cloud-
based business process network called the QuickLink network. This is often referred to 
as platform as a service (PaaS). Each client needs only a single connection to Elemica, 
and Elemica manages the connections to that company’s external trade partners. 
That means a company needs only maintain one connection to Elemica (important 
when it’s time for enterprise system maintenance or upgrade) rather than maintain 
a variable number of connections and infrastructure to all its trade partners. Once 
a company connects to Elemica, it can have access to thousands of other trading 
partners, including suppliers, customers, and logistics firms. Clients are charged for 
the service based on volume of usage. This is much more efficient than older EDI 
solutions to inter-company transactions. Elemica provides the platform for collabora-
tive commerce through a fully automated integrated network of suppliers, customers, 
and third-party providers.
Elemica offers cloud-based solutions for four areas: Logistics Management, Cus-
tomer Management, Supplier Management, and Sourcing Management. Using these 

	
C a s e  S t u d y 	

841
solutions, companies can automate ordering, invoicing, shipment tracking, and day-to-
day business operations. Companies can sign up for one or more solutions depending 
on their needs. The software applications are software as a service (SaaS) applications 
residing on Elemica cloud servers, and therefore do not require participating firms 
to buy any hardware or software.  Firms are charged on the basis of how much of the 
service they use, on a demand basis. 
Here’s an example of how Elemica works. Let’s say you need to order vinyl acetate 
from one of your suppliers. You put the order into your internal enterprise system, 
the order is automatically routed to Elemica’s QuickLink network, Elemica routes the 
order to your supplier’s internal enterprise system, and you get a confirmed receipt 
of the order. Elemica’s QuickLink Network ensures the accuracy of the item number 
and purchase order number and sends an alert if there’s an issue. Once an order is 
confirmed, Elemica’s platform can be leveraged to plan and coordinate delivery and 
automatically send an invoice and submit payment. For small or medium firms that 
may not have an enterprise system, Elemica has a Web portal with online software 
that allows firms to participate in the community with suppliers and customers. The 
platform offers a closed-loop process, end to end, from the purchase order, to acknowl-
edgments, load tenders and responses, carrier status updates, and dock scheduling. 
All of this takes place in a few seconds with little or no human intervention. Elemica 
has even developed a solution that allows a customer to send a purchase order via 
e-mail or a print driver (alleviating fax processes) that is then routed to Elemica. The 
company then routes it to the supplier in its preferred format, integrated with its 
enterprise system as though it were a true electronic order. This holistic approach to 
order management allows suppliers to automate the process with both strategic and 
core customers, without asking its customers to change their processes. It’s a win-win 
situation for suppliers and customers. Elemica’s QuickLink Network is sometimes 
referred to as Come as You Are network because it allows firms to use whatever com-
munication tools they currently use, such as EDI, XML, and even e-mail, or formats 
associated with their enterprise systems. 
Unlike the automobile industry or the airline industry, where a few companies 
dominate, the $5 trillion global chemical industry is made up of many companies of 
all sizes. In addition, unlike many other industries, chemical companies often buy 
the output from other chemical companies to use as raw materials for their products. 
Thus, chemical companies are often customers of one another as well as competitors.
Senior leaders at some of the larger chemical companies were aware of changes 
in technology that made the adoption of information technology and the tools of 
e-commerce more appealing. The questions were how to best use these advances 
to benefit their businesses and how to establish industry standards for electronic 
transactions to make them accessible and attainable for all. Leaders from companies 
such as Dow Chemical and DuPont began discussing this subject and determined 
that a cooperative alliance would be the most efficient way to move forward. They 
were met with initial skepticism by marketing and sales staff, worried that online 
procurement would negatively affect relationships. Further, senior corporate leader-
ship wasn’t sure that e-commerce would have any use in the chemical industry at all.

And companies were cautious about the expense of investing in the infrastructure 
necessary for e-commerce.
However, there were compelling opportunities that were impossible to dismiss, 
including lowering costs, creating closer connections with customers and suppliers, 
and differentiating companies on something other than price. At the same time, new 
start-ups like e-Chemicals and PlasticsNet were making traditional chemical compa-
nies nervous. What would happen if their efforts to use information technology to 
streamline an inefficient supply chain helped them capture market share? In other 
words, if the more traditional companies didn’t move forward, they might end up 
losing the revenue race.
When Dow began looking at start-ups that were using e-commerce and talking to 
their customers, they found that customers were concerned about making an invest-
ment to establish online connections with multiple firms. Dow and DuPont decided 
that the best and most economically efficient option was to offer customers the choice 
of a neutral one-to-one link. This would remove the obstacle of multiple connections. 
A strong, third-party network addressed the community concern about loss of control. 
The two companies decided to create and invest in a neutral e-commerce company, 
partnering with other companies to create the critical mass needed to make it viable.
In 1999, the corporate boards of Dow and DuPont agreed that there were major 
advantages to online transaction processing and additional online connections among 
buyers and sellers. Because time and cost considerations made multiple connections 
unattractive to customers, a hub concept was adopted. It was also decided that a 
neutral community was the best approach.
All participants shared the common goal of creating a neutral platform to facilitate 
inter-company transactions and enhance business processes. Dow and DuPont also 
reviewed the concept with the relevant regulatory agencies and received up-front 
approval. Ultimately, 22 global chemical companies were involved in the launch of 
Elemica.
When Elemica opened its doors in 1999, there were around 50 start-up B2B 
e-commerce companies in the chemical industry. Nearly all of these B2B companies 
were third-party-owned Net marketplaces suitable at best for short-term sourcing of 
some direct inputs. In 2016, only a handful of these Net marketplaces for the chemical 
industry remain. Elemica focuses on building longer-term business relationships by 
creating committed and contractual supply chains. The company acts only as a facili-
tator of business transactions and does not directly buy and sell chemical products.
Elemica’s business model has been successful primarily because it addresses the 
needs of chemical, tire and rubber, energy, and selected process companies of all sizes. 
It does this by offering multiple options for connecting to its hub system, multiple 
products that can be used alone or in combination, and by ensuring that only one 
connection integrated with a client’s enterprise system is needed for all transactions. 
Customers can use Elemica, and take advantage of the technology it offers, without 
purchasing an additional internal system.
With Elemica, companies benefit from improved operational efficiency, reduced 
costs due to elimination of redundant systems and excess inventory, and a much

higher percentage of safe and reliable deliveries. The flexibility of Elemica’s solu-
tions and network combines simplification, standardization, and efficiency. And 
clients have increased their profitability and improved cash flow through faster 
payment.
A number of very large companies use Elemica’s platform. In Europe, Shell 
Oil started using Elemica after recognizing that it had ongoing problems with the 
coordination of paperwork processing and deliveries. Truck drivers would arrive at 
delivery sites and wait up to two hours while paperwork was filled out. These delays 
were costing Shell money. Once Shell began using Elemica, things improved. Today, 
paperwork is processed 24 hours a day, and truck waiting time has been cut from an 
average of two hours to an average of 15 minutes. Given this success, Shell continues 
to expand its relationship with Elemica.
Dow Chemical began to transition to full procurement automation with Elemica 
in 2007. More than 300 of their MRO suppliers are now linked to Elemica’s platform. 
Errors are down 75%, and Dow has achieved economies of scale that have led to 
meaningful financial savings. Elemica helped Dow unify multiple, disparate business 
processes, reduced the cost of getting contracted items from suppliers, and increased 
efficiency in procurement, operations, IT, and accounts payable.
Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. is a global provider of gases and chemicals with 
22,000 employees worldwide, and $10 billion in revenue. A major customer asked them 
for online ordering, but the initial method proposed would have required considerable 
additional work for both parties. Because both companies were connected to Elemica, 
there was a better option—the Elemica Supply Chain Hosted Solution.
Elemica has also developed a sustainability program. In 2015, Elemica received 
the Food Logistics 2015 Top Green Provider Award for its efforts in promoting sus-
tainable supply chains. Elemica automated all inbound and outbound invoices for a 
global chemical company, eliminating over one million paper invoices. Elemica also 
eliminated the costs of archiving and storing paper records, saving additional costs.
Elemica has added social tools to its Supply Chain Operating Network (SCON). 
The idea is to give clients the ability to discover, create, and build social business 
networks—just as Facebook provides its users the ability to build online social net-
works. SCON provides its clients with a cloud-based network for establishing business 
relationships and SaaS (software as a service) applications to carry on trading once the 
relationship is established. Instead of creating hundreds of one-to-one EDI connections 
with partners, and then building their own software applications, firms can now more 
easily just connect to the network and find all the tools they need to trade with many 
partners. And in May 2014, Elemica introduced its Process Control Tower, a graphical 
interface that offers a consolidated view of transactional data across all a customer’s 
business partners. Based on the metaphor of an airport control tower, the idea is to 
give managers a near real-time view of their entire supply and logistics systems. In 
the past, and still in many firms today, this kind of supply chain information comes 
in many different forms, from faxes, to e-mails, spreadsheets, and EDI messages. The 
Control Tower eliminates these difficult-to-interpret messages, and greatly enhances 
supply chain visibility.

	12.7	 REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Discuss the evolution and growth of B2B e-commerce, as well as its potential benefits and challenges.
•	
Before the Internet, business-to-business transactions were referred to simply as trade or the procurement 
process. Today, we use the term B2B commerce to describe all types of inter-firm trade, and the term B2B 
e-commerce to describe specifically that portion of B2B commerce that is enabled by the Internet and 
mobile apps. 
•	
In order to understand the evolution of B2B e-commerce, you must understand several key stages:
•	
Automated order entry systems, developed in the 1970s, involved the use of telephone modems to 
send digital orders. 
•	
EDI or electronic data interchange, developed in the late 1970s, is a communications standard for shar-
ing various procurement documents including invoices, purchase orders, shipping bills, product 
stocking numbers (SKUs), and settlement information for an industry. 
•	
B2B e-commerce Web sites emerged in the 1990s along with the commercialization of the Internet. 
They are online catalogs containing the products that are made available to the general public by a 
single vendor.
•	
Net marketplaces emerged in the late 1990s as a natural extension and scaling-up of the electronic 
storefront. The essential characteristic of all Net marketplaces is that they bring hundreds of suppli-
ers, each with its own online catalog, together with potentially thousands of purchasing firms to 
form a single ­Internet-based marketplace.
•	
Private industrial networks also emerged in the late 1990s with the commercialization of the Internet 
as a natural extension of EDI systems and the existing close relationships that developed between 
large industrial firms and their ­suppliers.
•	
Potential benefits of B2B e-commerce include lower administrative costs; lower search costs for buyers; 
reduced inventory costs; lower transaction costs; improved quality of products; decreased product cycle 
time; increased opportunities for collaborating with suppliers and distributors; greater price transparency; 

	
R e v i e w

845
and increased visibility and real-time information sharing among all participants in the supply chain 
network.
•	
Potential risks and challenges include lack of real-time data, environmental impacts, natural disasters, 
labor concerns, and the impacts of economic, financial, and political instability.
Understand how procurement and supply chains relate to B2B e-commerce.
•	
The procurement process refers to the way business firms purchase the goods they need in order to pro-
duce the goods they will ultimately sell to consumers. Firms purchase goods from a set of suppliers who 
in turn purchase their inputs from a set of suppliers. These firms are linked in a series of connected 
­transactions. The supply chain is the series of transactions that links sets of firms that do ­business with 
each other. It includes not only the firms themselves but also the relationships between them and the 
processes that connect them.
•	
There are two different types of procurements (purchases of direct goods and purchases of indirect 
goods) and two different methods of purchasing goods (contract purchases and spot purchases).
•	
The term multi-tier supply chain is used to describe the complex series of transactions that exists between 
a single firm with multiple primary suppliers, the secondary suppliers who do business with those pri-
mary suppliers, and the tertiary suppliers who do business with the secondary suppliers.
Identify major trends in supply chain management and collaborative commerce. 
•	
Supply chain management (SCM) refers to a wide variety of activities that firms and industries use to coor-
dinate the key players in their procurement process. 
•	
Just-in-time production is a method of inventory cost management that seeks to eliminate excess inventory 
to a bare minimum.
•	
Lean production is a set of production methods and tools that focuses on the elimination of waste through-
out the customer value chain. 
•	
Supply chain simplification involves reducing the size of the supply chain and working more closely with a 
smaller group of strategic supplier firms to reduce both product costs and administrative costs, while 
improving quality
•	
Adaptive supply chains allow companies to react to disruptions in the supply chain in a particular region 
by moving production to a different region.
•	
Accountable supply chains are those where the labor conditions in low-wage, underdeveloped producer 
countries are visible and morally acceptable to ultimate consumers in more developed industrial societ-
ies.
•	
Sustainable supply chains involve using the most efficient environment-regarding means of production, 
distribution, and logistics.
•	
EDI remains very important in the development of B2B e-commerce.
•	
Mobile B2B has become increasingly important in all aspects of B2B e-commerce, through all steps of the 
procurement process and throughout the supply chain.
•	
Cloud-based B2B systems shift much of the expense of B2B systems from the firm to a B2B network pro-
vider, sometimes called a data hub or B2B platform.
•	
Contemporary supply chain management (SCM) systems are based on supply chain simplification, just in 
time and lean production, focusing on strategic partners in the production process, enterprise systems, 
and continuous inventory replenishment.
•	
Collaborative commerce involves the use of digital technologies to permit firms to collaboratively design, 
develop, build, market, and manage products through their life cycles, and is a direct extension of supply 
chain management systems, as well as supply chain simplification. Collaborative commerce today 
involves cloud servers, social business tools, and mobile devices.

•	
Social networks are providing intimate connections among customers, suppliers, and logistics partners.
Understand the different characteristics and types of Net marketplaces.
•	
Characteristics of Net marketplaces include their bias (seller-side vs. buy-side vs. neutral), ownership 
(industry vs. third party), pricing mechanism (fixed priced catalogs, auctions, and RFPs/RFQs), scope/
focus (horizontal vs. vertical), value creation (customers/suppliers), and access to markets (public vs. 
private).
•	
There are four main types of “pure” Net marketplaces:
•	
E-distributors are independently owned intermediaries that offer industrial ­customers a single source 
from which to make spot purchases of indirect or MRO goods. E-distributors operate in a horizontal 
market that serves many different industries with products from many different suppliers.
•	
E-procurement Net marketplaces are independently owned intermediaries ­connecting hundreds of 
online suppliers offering millions of MRO goods to ­business firms who pay a fee to join the market. 
E-procurement Net marketplaces operate in a horizontal market in which long-term contractual 
purchasing agreements are used to buy indirect goods.
•	
Exchanges are independently owned online marketplaces that connect hundreds to thousands of sup-
pliers and buyers in a dynamic real-time environment. They are typically vertical markets in which 
spot purchases can be made for direct inputs (both goods and services). Exchanges make money by 
charging a commission on each transaction.
•	
Industry consortia are industry-owned vertical markets where long-term contractual purchases of 
direct inputs can be made from a limited set of invited participants. Consortia serve to reduce supply 
chain inefficiencies by unifying the supply chain for an industry through a common network and 
computing platform.
Understand the objectives of private industrial networks, and their role in supporting collaborative commerce, and the 
barriers to their implementation.
•	
Objectives of private industrial networks include developing efficient purchasing and selling business 
processes industry-wide; developing industry-wide resource planning to supplement enterprise-wide 
resource planning; increasing supply chain visibility; achieving closer buyer-supplier relationships; oper-
ating on a global scale; and reducing industry risk by preventing imbalances of supply and demand.
•	
Private industrial networks are transforming the supply chain by focusing on continuous business pro-
cess coordination between companies. This coordination includes much more than just transaction sup-
port and supply chain management. Product design, demand forecasting, asset management, and sales 
and marketing plans can all be coordinated among network members. Some of the forms of collaboration 
used by private industrial networks include the following:
•	
CPFR or industry-wide collaborative resource planning, forecasting, and replenishment involves working 
with network members to forecast demand, develop production plans, and coordinate shipping, 
warehousing, and stocking activities. 
•	
Supply chain and distribution chain visibility refers to the fact that, in the past, it was impossible to 
know where excess capacity existed in a supply or distribution chain. Eliminating excess inventories 
by halting the production of overstocked goods can raise the profit margins for all network members 
because products will no longer need to be discounted in order to move them off the shelves.
•	
Marketing and product design collaboration can be used to involve a firm’s suppliers in product design 
and marketing activities as well as in the related activities of their supply and distribution chain 
partners. This can ensure that the parts used to build a product live up to the claims of the market-
ers. Collaborative commerce applications used in a private industrial network can also make pos-
sible closed-loop marketing in which customer feedback will directly impact product design.

promised by the site for both suppliers and purchasers, and the history of the company. You might 
also investigate the bias (buyer versus seller), ownership (suppliers, buyers, independents), pricing 
mechanism(s), scope and focus, and access (public versus private) of the Net marketplace.
	 2.	 Examine the Web site of one of the e-distributors listed in Figure 12.9, and compare and contrast it to 
one of the Web sites listed for e-procurement Net marketplaces. If you were a business manager of a 
medium-sized firm, how would you decide where to purchase your indirect inputs—from an e-distrib-
utor or an e-procurement Net marketplace? Write a short report detailing your analysis.
	 3.	 Assume you are a procurement officer for an office furniture manufacturer of steel office equipment. 
You have a single factory located in the Midwest with 2,000 employees. You sell about 40% of your office 
furniture to retail-oriented catalog outlets such as Quill in response to specific customer orders, and the 
remainder of your output is sold to resellers under long-term contracts. You have a choice of purchasing 
raw steel inputs—mostly cold-rolled sheet steel—from an exchange and/or from an industry consortium. 
Which alternative would you choose and why? Prepare a presentation for management supporting your 
position.

	 4.	 You are involved in logistics management for your company, a national retailer of office furniture. In 
the last year the company has experienced a number of disruptions in its supply chain as vendors failed 
to deliver products on time, and the business has lost customers as a result. Your firm only has a limited 
IT department,  and you would like to propose a cloud-based solution. Go to the web site of GT Nexus. 
Explore the Why GT Nexus tab, and the Solutions By Industry/Retail tab. Read several case studies on 
the site. Write a report to senior management why you believe that a cloud-based B2B solution is best for 
your firm.
