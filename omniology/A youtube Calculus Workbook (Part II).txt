Preface
Preface
With the explosion of resources available on the internet, virtually anything can be learned on your own, 
using free online resources. Or can it, really? If you are looking for instructional videos to learn Calculus, 
you will probably have to sort through thousands of hits, navigate through videos of inconsistent quality 
and format, jump from one instructor to another, all this without written guidance. 
This free e-book is a guide through a play-list of Calculus instructional videos. The play-list and the book 
are divided into 16 thematic learning modules. The format, level of details and rigor, and progression 
of topics are consistent with a semester long college level Calculus II course, the first volume covering 
the equivalent of a Calculus I course. The continuity of style should help you learn the material more 
consistently than jumping around the many options available on the internet. The book further provides 
simple summary of videos, written definitions and statements, worked out examples – even though fully 
step by step solutions are to be found in the videos – and an index. 
The present book is a guide to instructional videos, and as such can be used for self study, or as a textbook 
for a Calculus course following the flipped classroom model.
An essential companion to this book is the exercise manual Exercises for A youtube Calculus Workbook 
Part II: a flipped classroom model, which also outlines and discusses the structure for a flipped classroom 
course based on this material. 
For future reference, the play list of all the videos is available at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist? list=PLm168eGEcBjnS6ecJflh7BTDaUB6jShIL.
If you need to review any part of Calculus I, please refer to the first youtube workbook, whose associated 
play-list is available at:
http://www.youtube.com/playlist? list=PL265CB737C01F8961. 
In particular, undefined notions or Theorems we may refer to that are not stated in the present book 
can be found in the first volume.
I hope that only few errors are left in this book, but some are bound to remain. I welcome feedback and 
comments at calculusvideos@gmail.com.

The natural logarithm function is defined as the antiderivative of 1
x  on (0, ∞) that takes the 
value 0 at 1. Its basic properties are introduced and proved.

Abstract
These two videos go over more properties of the natural logarithm function, in particular its 
graph, and over derivatives and integrals involving the natural logarithm function. 
Since, (ln x)′ = 1
x > 0 and (ln x)′′ = −1
x2 < 0, the function ln is increasing and concave down on its 
domain (0, ∞). Moreover 
lim

Abstract
This video illustrates on examples the technique of logarithmic differentiation. 
The basic idea behind logarithmic differentiation is that to differentiate a function f(x) that involves 
products, quotients and/or powers, we can consider ln f(x) and take advantage of the Laws of Logarithm 
to turn it into a simpler expression to differentiate, and then note that 
(ln f(x))′ = f ′(x)
f(x) =⇒f ′(x) = f(x) · (ln f(x))′ .
Example 1.3.1. differentiate 
f(x) = (x2 + 1)3x ln x
x3√
x4 + 3
.
Solution. 
ln f(x) = 3 ln(x2 + 1) + ln x + ln(ln x) −3 ln x −1
2 ln(x4 + 3),

Abstract
This video defines one-to-one functions and considers criteria, and defines the inverse function 
of a one-to-one function.
Definition 1.4.1. A function f is one-to-one on an interval I if for every x1 and x2 in I 
x1 ̸= x2 =⇒f(x1) ̸= f(x2).
In other words, f  is one-to-one if it never takes on the same value twice.

Proposition 1.4.2 (Horizontal line Test). A function is one-to-one if and only if horizontal lines intersect 
the graph in at most one point. 
 
Example 1.4.3. For instance f(x) = x3 is one-to-one on its domain (−∞, ∞), while g(x) = x2 is not:
 
while the restriction of x2 to the non-negative reals, h(x) = x2 for x ≥0, is one-to-one:

Recall 
Definition 1.4.4. A function f is increasing on an interval I if for every x1 and x2 in I 
x1 < x2 =⇒f(x1) < f(x2),
and decreasing on I if for every x1 and x2 in I 
x1 < x2 =⇒f(x1) > f(x2).
A function is monotone on I if it is either increasing or decreasing on I.
Proposition 1.4.5. If f is monotone on an interval, then it is one-to-one on this interval.
Definition 1.4.6. Let f be a function with domain A. The range of f is the set of values assumed by f, 
that is, the set {f(x) : x ∈A}. 
Definition 1.4.7. If f is a one-to-one function with domain A and range B, then it admits an inverse 
function, denoted f −1, that has domain B and range A and is defined by 
y = f(x) ⇐⇒f −1(y) = x.

Abstract
In this video, examples are provided to check that a function is one-to-one, to evaluate the 
inverse function at a particular point, and to find a formula for the inverse of a given function. 
Additionally, it is shown that the graph of the inverse function of a one-to-one function is 
obtained from the graph of the function by reflection about y = x.
Example 1.5.1. If f is one-to-one and f(2) = 9, what is f −1(9)? 
Solution. 
f(2) = 9
⇐⇒
f
2 = f −1(9).

Natural Logarithm and Exponential
Example 1.5.2. Let f(x) = x + cos x . Is f one-to-one? What is f −1(1)? 
Solution. Since 
f ′(x) = 1 −sin x ≥0,
the function is increasing on its domain, hence one-to-one by Proposition 1.4.5. Thus it has an inverse 
function and f −1(1) = 0 because 
f(0) = 0 + cos 0 = 1.
To find an algebraic expression for f −1 from an algebraic expression defining a one-to-one function f, 
remember that by definition, in this case: 
y = f(x) ⇐⇒f −1(y) = x.
Thus, start from y = f(x), and solve for x! 
Example 1.5.3. Is f(x) = 3 −2x  one-to-one? If yes, find a formula for f −1.
Solution. Since f is decreasing on (−∞, ∞), it is one-to-one by Proposition 1.4.5. Moreover 
y = 3 −2x ⇐⇒x = 3 −y
2
= f −1(y),
so that f −1(x) = 3−x
2 .
Example 1.5.4. Find the inverse function of 
f(x) = 4x −1
2x + 3.
Solution. Note that f has domain (−∞, −3
2) ∪(−3
2, ∞). If we were asked to find the range of f, one way 
to do that would be to find the domain of f −1. Let y = 4x−1
2x+3. Then 
(2x + 3)y = 4x −1 ⇐⇒x(2y −4) = −(1 + 3y) ⇐⇒x = −1 + 3y
2y −4 = f −1(y),
so that f −1(x) = −1+3x
2x−4, whose domain is (−∞, 2) ∪(2, ∞), which is also the range of f.

Abstract
This video examines how differentiability and continuity transfer from a one-to-one function 
to its inverse function, and establishes a formula for the derivative of the inverse function.
Proposition 1.6.1. If f is one-to-one and continuous on an interval I, then f −1 is also continuous on f(I).
Theorem 1.6.2. If f is one-to-one and differentiable at b = f −1(a), and f ′(b) ̸= 0, then f −1 is differentiable 
at a and 

f −1′ (a) =

f ′(f −1(a)).
In Leibniz notations, with

Example 1.6.3. Let f(x) = x5 −x3 + 2x. Is it one-to-one? If yes, find 

f −1′ (2).
Solution. Note that 
f ′(x) = 5x4 −3x2 + 2 = 5u2 −3u + 2
u = x2
and 5u2 −3u + 2 = 0 has no solution because its discriminant (1) is −31 < 0, so that f ′(x) > 0 because 
f ′(0) > 0 and f ′  does not change sign. Thus f is an increasing function, and is thus one-to-one 
(Proposition 1.4.5). According to Theorem 1.6.2, we have 

f −1′ (2) =
1
f ′ (f −1(2)).
Moreover f −1(2) = 1 because f(1) = 2. Thus f ′(f −1(2)) = f ′(1) = 4 and 

f −1′ (2) = 1
4.
Example 1.6.4. Consider f(x) = √x −2.
1)	 Show that f is one-to-one;
Solution. Since f ′(x) =
1
2√x−2 > 0 on (2, ∞), f  is increasing, hence one-to-one, on its domain.
2)	 Use Theorem 1.6.2 to calculate 

f −1′ (2);
Solution. 

f −1′ (2) =
1
f ′ (f −1(2))
and 
f(x) = 2 ⇐⇒
√
x −2 = 2 ⇐⇒x = 6,
so that f −1(2) = 6. Thus 

f −1′ (2) =

2√6−2

3)	 Find a formula for f −1(x);
Solution. Let y = √x −2. Then y2 = x −2 with y ≥0, that is, 
x = y2 + 2
y ≥0,
so that f −1(x) = x2 + 2 for x ≥0.
4)	 Use 3. to recalculate 

f −1′ (2);
Solution. Since f −1(x) = x2 + 2 for x ≥0, 

f −1′ (x) = 2x  and thus 

f −1′ (2) = 4.

Abstract
This video defines the natural exponential function as the inverse function of the natural 
logarithm function and explores its basic properties. 
Recall that the natural logarithm function has domain (0, ∞) and range (−∞, ∞) and is increasing, 
hence one-to-one, on its domain. Thus it admits an inverse function. 
Definition 1.7.1. The natural exponential function, tentatively denoted exp, is the inverse function of the 
natural logarithm function ln. Thus it has domain (−∞, ∞) and range (0, ∞) and 
y = exp x ⇐⇒x = ln y, y > 0.

Natural Logarithm and Exponential
Since ln(ex) = x ln e = x  by (1.1.4) and ln(exp x) = x  because ln and exp are inverse of each other, we 
conclude that ln(ex) = ln(exp x) for all x, which ensures that 
exp x = ex
because ln is one-to-one. We use the notation ex from now on for the natural exponential function. Of 
course, we have 
eln x

x > 0
ln(ex)

The properties of logarithm are rephrased in term of its inverse function:

Abstract
This video goes over examples of equations and inequalities involving exponential and 
logarithm.
Example 1.9.1. Solve:
1)	 e2x+3 −7 = 0;
Solution. By applying ln on both sides of e2x+3 = 7, we obtain 
2x + 3 = ln 7 ⇐⇒x = ln 7 −3
2
.
2)	 ln(5 −2x) = −3;
Solution. By applying the natural exponential on both sides, we obtain 
5 −2x = e−3 ⇐⇒x = 5 −e−3
2
.
3)	 eex = 10;
Solution. By applying ln on both sides, we have 
ex = ln 10 ⇐⇒x = ln(ln 10).
4)	 ln(2x + 1) = 2 −ln x ;
Solution. The domain of this equation is (0, ∞). On this domain, we can rewrite the equation as 
ln(2x + 1) + ln x
=
2
ln (x(2x + 1))
=
2,
so that 2x2 + x = e2. This is a quadratic equation 2x2 + x −e2 = 0, which we can solve with 
the quadratic formula to the effect that 
	
x = −1 ±
√
1 + 8e2
4
,
but only x = −1+
√
1+8e2
4
 is in the domain of the equation, and is thus the only solution.

5)	 7ex −e2x = 12.
Solution. We can rewrite the equation as 
e2x −7ex + 12
=
0
(ex)2 −7ex + 12
=
0
u2 −7u + 12
=
0
u = ex
(u −3)(u −4)
=
0
so that we have ex = 3 or ex = 4, that is, x = ln 3 or x = ln 4.
Example 1.9.2. Solve:
1)	 2 < ln x < 9;
Solution. Since ex  is an increasing function, it preserves the direction of inequalities, so that 
e2 < eln x < e9 ⇐⇒e2 < x < e9
and the solution set is the interval (e2, e9).
2)	 e2−3x > 4.
Solution. Since ln is an increasing function, it preserves the direction of inequalities, so that 
ln(e2−3x) > ln 4 ⇐⇒2 −3x > ln 4 ⇐⇒2 −ln 4
3
> x,
so that the solution set is the interval (−∞, 2−ln 4
3
).

Definition 2.1.1. Let a > 0 with a ̸= 1. The exponential function of base a is the function 
f(x) = ax := ex ln a.
Note that f(x) = ax  has domain (−∞, ∞) and range (0, ∞).
For instance 
2π
=
eπ ln 2
10x2
=
ex2 ln 10
xx
=
ex ln x,
and you should keep in mind that powers are really defined in terms of powers of e, and be comfortable 
rewriting them as such. 
Proposition 2.1.2 (Laws of exponents). Let x, y in (∞, ∞) and a, b > 0. Then 
ax+y
=
ax · ay
ax−y

=
ax · bx.
Proposition 2.1.3. Let a > 0 and a ̸= 1. Then the exponential function of base a is differentiable on 
(−∞, ∞) and 
(ax)′ = ax · ln a.
In other words, 
ˆ
ax dx = ax
ln a + C.
Example 2.1.4. Differentiate:
1)	 g(x) = x4 · 4x;
Solution. Using the product rule 
g′(x) = 4x3 · 4x + x4 · 4x · ln 4.
2)	 f(θ) = 10tan θ ;

Since 
(ax)′ = ax · ln a
and ln a > 0 whenever a > 1, ln a < 0 whenever 0 < a < 1, we conclude that ax is increasing on its 
domain if a > 1 and decreasing on its domain if 0 < a < 1. Moreover 
(ax)′′ = ax · (ln a)2 > 0,
so that ax is concave up in both cases.

Abstract
These two videos define and examine the properties of logarithm functions of base a (a > 0, 
a ̸= 1). 
We have seen that for a > 0, a ̸= 1, the exponential function of base a is one-to-one with domain 
(−∞, ∞) and range (0, ∞). Thus, it admits an inverse function: 
Definition 2.2.1. The logarithm function of base a, denoted loga, is by definition the inverse function of 
the exponential function of base a. Thus, it has domain (0, ∞) and range (−∞, ∞) and is defined by 
y = loga x, x > 0 ⇐⇒ay = x.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

note that 
θ := arcsin 1

is an angle in (0, π
2 ) with sin θ = 1

Remark 2.3.4. The alternative notation sin−1 is often used for arcsin. Yet, this is in direct conflict with 
the standard convention to place the exponent next to the function when taking powers of the value of 
a trig function, as in sin2 x  to mean (sin x)2. To be coherent with this convention, sin−1 x  should mean 
(sin x)−1 =
1
sin x
which has nothing to do with arcsin x! Thus we will not use this alternative notation.

Inverse cosine function: The cosine function is not one-to-one, but its restriction to the interval 
[0, π] is:
 
Definition 2.4.1. The inverse cosine function, denoted arccos, is the inverse function of the restriction 
of the cosine function to [0, π], that is: 
y = arccosx ⇐⇒cos y = x
y ∈[0, π] .
The function arccos has thus domain [−1, 1] and range [0, π]. 
Therefore

Abstract
In this video, we introduce hyperbolic functions, explore some basic properties, differentiate 
a number of functions defined in terms of hyperbolic functions.
Definition 2.6.1. The hyperbolic sine function, denoted sinh, is defined on (−∞, ∞) by 
sinh x := ex −e−x
2
.
Its range is also (−∞, ∞).
The hyperbolic cosine function, denoted cosh, is defined on (−∞, ∞) by 
cosh x := ex + e−x
2
.
Its range is [1, ∞). 
 
Note that sinh is odd, that is, 
sinh(−x) = −sinh x
x
and that cosh is even, that is, 
cosh(−x) = cosh x
x.

This terminology of hyperbolic sine and cosine is justified among other things by the observation that 
the trigonometric identity 
cos2 t + sin2 t = 1
means that a point of the plane of coordinates (cos t, sin t) lies on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1. The 
corresponding identity 
cosh2 t −sinh2 t = 1
means that a point of the plane of coordinates (cosh t, sinh t) lies on the hyperbola x2 −y2 = 1.

The similarities between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions include identities. For instance: 
cos(x + y) = cos x cos y −sin x sin y
cosh(x + y) = cosh x cosh y + sinh x sinh y
sin(x + y) = sin x cos y + cos x sin y
sinh(x + y) = sinh x cosh y + cosh x sinh y
sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x
sinh(2x) = 2 sinh x cosh x
and 
cos(2x) =cos2 x −sin2 x vs. cosh(2x) =cosh2 x + sinh2 x
=
2 cos2 x −1
=
2 cosh2 x −1
=
1 −2 sin2 x
=
1 + 2 sinh2 x.
We define other hyperbolic functions in terms of cosh and sinh in a similar fashion to what is done for 
trigonometric functions, thus defining hyperbolic versions of tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant.

Abstract
In this video, we introduce the inverse hyperbolic sine and cosine functions, study their basic 
properties, and use them to calculate integrals.
Definition 2.7.1. The hyperbolic arcsine function or inverse hyperbolic sine function, denoted arcsinh 
is defined by 
y = arcsinh x ⇐⇒sinh y = x
for all x in (−∞, ∞).
The hyperbolic arccosine function or inverse hyperbolic cosine function, denoted arccosh is the inverse 
function of the restriction of cosh to [0, ∞). Thus, it has domain [1, ∞) and range [0, ∞), and 
y = arccoshx, x ≥1 ⇐⇒cosh y = x, y ≥0.

M3: Rule of De l’Hospital
Theorem 3.1.1 (Rule of De l’Hospital) Let f and g be two functions differentiable on an open interval 
centered at a, except possibly at a. If 
lim
x→a f(x) = lim
x→a g(x) = 0
limx→a f(x) = ±∞
limx→a g(x) = ±∞,
then 
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) = lim
x→a
f ′(x)
g′(x) ,
if limx→a
f ′(x)
g′(x) exists, or is infinite. 
Additionally, the statement remains valid if a is replace by a+, a−, −∞ or +∞. 
Remark 3.1.2. We will use the symbol H=  to indicate that two limits are equal by the Rule of De l’Hospital.
Example 3.1.3.

The proof of the Rule of De l’Hospital makes use of the following generalization of the Mean Value 
Theorem: 
Theorem 3.1.4 (Cauchy Mean Value Theorem). Let f and g be two functions that are continuous on 
[a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) with g′(x) ̸= 0 on (a, b), and g(b) ̸= g(a). Then there exists (at least) a 
c in (a, b) with 
f ′(c)
g′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
g(b) −g(a) .
Remark 3.1.5. The classical Mean Value Theorem corresponds to g(x) = x .

Abstract
This video goes over a number of examples where a limit that is indeterminate of the type 
0 · ∞ is evaluated using the Rule of De l’Hospital. 
Products where one factor has limit 0 and the other has an infinite limit are indeterminate forms of the 
type 
0 · ∞.
While Theorem 3.1.1 formally only applies to indeterminate forms of the type 0
0 or ∞
∞, a product of the 
type 0 · ∞ can easily be transformed into a quotient 0
0 or ∞
∞ because 
lim
x→a f(x) = 0
=⇒
lim
x→a
1
f(x) = ±∞
lim
x→a f(x) = ±∞
=⇒
lim

f(x) = 0
and 
f(x) · g(x) = g(x)

M3: Rule of De l’Hospital
but all 3 types of indeterminate forms stem from the fact that in 
(f(x))g(x) = eg(x) ln(f(x)),
the product g(x) ln (f(x)) is an indeterminate form of the type 0 · ∞, which we have seen how to treat 
with the Rule of De l’Hospital in the previous section. 
Example 3.4.1. Evaluate
1)	 	limx→0+ (tan(2x))x;
Solution. Since 
(tan(2x))x = ex ln(tan(2x)),
we only need to find

Thus

Abstract
This video reviews basic integration formulas and explore examples where completing the 
square can help integrating. 
Basic formulas and substitution
It is a corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that if f is continuous on [a, b] and F is an 
antiderivative of f on [a, b] then 
ˆ b
a
f(x) dx
=
F(b) −F(a)
:=
[F(x)]b
a .
Thus, to calculate the definite integral of a continuous function over an interval, we only need to find 
an antiderivative of this function, that is, its indefinite integral 
´
f(x) dx.

Abstract
This video illustrates on examples how trig formulas or algebra on fractions can change the 
form of an integral into one that can be handled with basic techniques. 
Trigonometric identities
There are many trigonometric identities that can be useful, but one of the most commonly used is the 
double angle formula: 
cos(2x)
=
2 cos2 x −1
=
1 −2 sin2 x
=
cos2 x −sin2 x
sin(2x)
=
2 sin x cos x.

Transforming rational functions
The first observation is that if in a quotient of two polynomials the degree of the numerator is not less 
than that of the denominator, then the fraction can be simplified by long division, which is often useful 
to integrate. If you need to brush up on long division you can start at 1.50 into this video.

Integration by parts: indefinite integrals

and 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H4R2oSvujI&list=PLm168eGEcBjnS6ecJflh7BTDaUB6jShIL 
Abstract
These videos establish the integration by parts formula for indefinite integrals and goes over 
a number of examples. 
Turning around the Product Rule for derivatives yields the integration by parts formula 
ˆ
f(x)g′(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −
ˆ
f ′(x)g(x) dx
which is often more compactly written, with u = f(x) and dv = g′(x) dx : 
ˆ
u dv = uv −
ˆ
v du.		
 
(4.3.1)
Remark 4.3.1. When using integration by parts, you have to pick what part is interpreted as u and what 
part is interpreted as dv. The rule of thumb is that you chose so that 
´
v du  is simpler than the original 
integral. In other words, the derivative of u should not be more complicated than u and the integral of 
dv should not be more complicated than dv. This is, of course, not an absolute rule but rather a rough 
guideline.
Example 4.3.2. Evaluate 
1)	 	
´
x sin x dx
Solution. We pick2 u = x  and dv = sin x dx  so that du = dx  and v = −cosx . Thus, by (4.3.1), 
ˆ
x sin x dx = −x cos x +
ˆ
cos x dx = −x cos x + sin x + C.

´
xe−x dx
Solution. We pick u = x  and dv = e−x dx  so that du = dx  and v = −e−x . Thus, by (4.3.1), 
ˆ
xe−x dx = −xe−x +
ˆ
e−x dx = −e−x(x + 1) + C.
3)	 	
´
cos x ln(sin x) dx
Solution. Let u = ln(sin x) and dv = cos x dx , so that du = cos x
sin x  and v = sin x . Thus, by (4.3.1), 
ˆ
cos x ln(sin x) dx
=
sin x ln(sin x) −
ˆ
sin x · cos x
sin x dx
=
sin x ln(sin x) −
ˆ
cos x dx = sin x (ln(sin x) −1) + C.
4)	 	
´
ln x dx
Solution. Let u = ln x  and dv = dx , so that du = dx
x  and v = x . Thus, by (4.3.1),

Abstract
This video goes over one example of integrals where two successive integrations by parts lead 
to an equation whose unknown is the desired integral.
Example 4.5.1. Evaluate 
´
ex sin x dx .
Solution. Let u = sin x  and dv = ex dx. Then du = cos x dx  and v = ex , so that by integration 
by parts, 
ˆ
ex sin x dx = sin xex −
ˆ
ex cos x dx.
Integrating by parts in the new integral with u = cos x  and dv = ex dx, we have du = −sin x dx  and 
v = ex  so that 
ˆ
ex sin x dx
=
sin xex −

ex cos x +
ˆ
ex sin x dx

=
ex(sin x −cos x) +
ˆ
ex sin x dx.
Solving for the desired integral I :=
´
ex sin x dx, we obtain 
I = 1
2ex (sin x −cos x) + C.

Abstract
 This video goes over the general technique to evaluate integrals of the form 
ˆ
cosm x sinn x dx
distinguishing different cases. 
Case 1: at least one of the powers is odd
Example 5.1.1. To evaluate 
´
cos3 x dx, note that 
ˆ
cos3 x dx =
ˆ
cos2 x cos x dx =
ˆ 
1 −sin2 x

cos x dx,
so that the substitution u = sin x  gives du = cos x dx  and 
ˆ
cos3 x dx =
ˆ
1 −u2 du = u −u3
3 + C = sin x −sin3 x
3
+ C.
This approach can be used for the general case 
ˆ
cosm x sinn x dx,	
 
(5.1.1)

M5:  Trigonometri c integra ls and trigonome tric substitution
as long as at least one exponent is odd, say m = 2k + 1. Then 
ˆ
cosm x sinn x dx
=
ˆ
cos2k x sinn x cos x dx
=
ˆ 
cos2 x
k sinn x (cos x dx)
=
ˆ 
1 −sin2 x
k sinn x (cos x dx)
=
ˆ 
1 −u2k un du for u = sin x, 	
 
(5.1.2)
and the resulting integral is that of a polynomial in u. Note however that to calculate the integral, we 
first need to multiply things through in the integral. Thus, if both m and n are odd in (5.1.1), it is better 
to split the smallest power in order to minimize k in (5.1.2). 
Example 5.1.2. Evaluate 
´
cos5 x sin3 x dx .
Solution. Using the rule of thumb above, we “split” the power of sin: 
ˆ
cos5 x sin3 x dx
=
ˆ
cos5 x sin2 x sin x dx
=
ˆ
cos5 x

u = cos x
=
ˆ
u7 −u5 du
=

8 −u6
6 + C = cos8 x

−cos6 x
6
+ C.
Case 2: both powers are even
In this case, we write powers as powers of 
cos2 x
=
1 + cos(2x)
2
	
 
(5.1.3)
sin2 x
=
1 −cos(2x)

(which follows from the double angle formula (4.2.1)) to reduce the powers, and this process may need 
to be iterated.

M5:  Trigonometri c integra ls and trigonome tric substitution
Trigonometric substitutions allow to transform expressions of the form 
a2 −x2; a2 + x2
x2 −a2
into a single square, which often allows to simplify an integral. The basic idea is to parametrize x as 
x = g(θ),
where g is one-to-one, so that θ = g−1(x) defines a regular substitution. The choice of g that will permit 
us to rewrite the desired expressions as one single square make use of trigonometric identities:
 
The triangle is used to get back to an expression in terms of x instead of θ. 
Example 5.4.1. Evaluate 
´
dx
x2√
x2+4.
Solution. Note that there is no obvious substitution, so we may try trig substitution to get rid of the radical. 
We use the second row in the table above: let x = 2 tan θ  for −π
2 < θ < π
2 , so that dx = 2 sec2 θ dθ  and 
ˆ
dx
x2√
x2 + 4

Abstract
This video discusses the general strategy to integrate rational functions, and reviews long 
division of polynomial, which is the first step to be performed. 
It is easy to integrate 
ˆ
3
x −1 +
2
x + 3 dx = 3 ln |x −1| + 2 ln |x + 3| + C,
but not so clear at first how to integrate 
ˆ
5x + 7
x2 + 2x −3 dx
unless you realize that 
3
x −1 +
2
x + 3 = 3(x + 3) + 2(x −1)
(x −1)(x + 3)
=
5x + 7
x2 + 2x −3.
Thus, to integrate rational functions, i.e., quotients of polynomials, we have to be able to go the other 
way, that is, break down our fraction (like 
5x+7
x2+2x−3) into a sum of simpler ones (like 
3
x−1 +
2
x+3), or 
partial fractions.
To this end, we will: 
1)	 if the degree of the numerator is not less than that of the denominator, simplify by long 
division: 
p(x)
q(x) = f(x) + r(x)
q(x),
where f(x) is the quotient and r(x) the remainder in the division, so that r(x) has degree 
less than that of q(x).3

2)	 factor q(x). The factors may include:
a)	 non-repeated linear factors of the type (ax + b) 
b)	 repeated linear factors of the type (ax + b)n 
c)	 irreducible quadratic factors of the type ax2 + bx + c  (irreducible because b2 −4ac < 0) 
d)	 repeated irreducible quadratic factors of the type (ax2 + bx + c)n. 
The next steps depend on which of these four cases occurs. This will be explored in the next videos. 
Example 6.1.1. To evaluate 
ˆ x3 + x
x −1 dx
we first note by long division
x2 + x + 2
x −1

x3
+ x
−x3 + x2
x2 + x
−x2 + x
2x
−2x + 2
2
that 
x3 + x
x −1 = x2 + x + 2 +
2
x −1,
so that 
ˆ x3 + x
x −1 dx = x3
3 + x2

Abstract
These videos discuss the general methods to find the decomposition into partial fraction over 
a rational functions when the denominator has only non-repeated linear factors, and goes 
over three examples. 
Recall that modulo long division, we can assume that our rational function is in lowest terms, that is, 
r(x)
q(x) where the degree of r is less that the degree of q. If q(x) is of the form 
q(x) = (a1x + b1) · (a2x + b2) . . . (anx + bn) ,

where none of the factors is repeated, then the form of the decomposition into partial fractions is

q(x) =
A1
ax1 + b1
+
A2
a2x + b2
+ . . . +
An
anx + bn
,	  
(6.2.1)
and thus, we only need to find the coefficients A1, A2, . . . An  to integrate 
r(x)
q(x). We discuss how in the 
examples: 
Example 6.2.1. Evaluate 
ˆ x2 + 2x −1
x3 −x
dx.
Solution. The fraction is already in lowest terms, so there is no need for long division. Moreover 
x2 + 2x −1
x3 −x
=
x2 + 2x −1
x(x −1)(x + 1),
so that, in view of (6.2.1), 
x2 + 2x −1
x3 −x
= A
x +
B
x −1 +
C
x + 1.	
 
(6.2.2)
To find these coefficients: 
method 1: handcover method: 
To find A, multiply both sides by x and set x = 0: 
x2 + 2x −1
(x −1)(x + 1) = A +
Bx
x −1 +
Cx
x + 1
x=0
=⇒1 = A.
To find B, multiply both sides by x −1 and set x = 1: 
x2 + 2x −1
x(x + 1)
= A(x −1)
x
+ B + C(x −1)
(x + 1)
x=1
=⇒1 = B
To find C, multiply both sides by x + 1 and set x = −1: 
x2 + 2x −1
x(x −1)
= A(x + 1)
x
+ B(x + 1)
x −1
+ C
x=−1
=⇒−1 = C.
Thus 
ˆ x2 + 2x −1
x3 −x
dx =
ˆ 1
x +
1
x −1 −
1
x + 1 dx = ln |x| + ln |x −1| −ln |x + 1| + C.

M6: Partial Fractions
method 2: system method: 
To find the coefficients, we rewrite the right-hand side in (6.2.2) as one fraction, and identify 
the numerators: 
x2 + 2x −1
x(x −1)(x + 1) = A
x +
B
x −1 +
C
x + 1 = A(x −1)(x + 1) + Bx(x + 1) + Cx(x −1)
x(x −1)(x + 1)
so that 
x2 + 2x −1
=
A(x −1)(x + 1) + Bx(x + 1) + Cx(x −1)
=
x2(A + B + C) + x(B −C) + (−A).
Using the fact that two polynomials are equal if and only if their coefficients of same degree are equal 
we obtain the system 





A + B + C = 1
B −C = 2
−A = −1
⇐⇒





A = 1
B = 1
C = −1.
Remark 6.2.2. While the handcover method is more efficient, it only applies to the case of non-repeated 
linear factors, unlike the system method, which is more universal.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

2x + 3
x2 + 3x −4 dx =

Abstract
This video gives the form of the decomposition into partial fractions when the denominator 
contains repeated linear factors, and explains on examples how to find the corresponding 
coefficients, and how to integrate the resulting terms. 
If the denominator q(x) of a rational function 
r(x)
q(x) in lowest terms contains a repeated linear factor 
(ax + b)n the corresponding terms in the decomposition into partial fractions of 
r(x)
q(x) are 
A1
ax + b +
A2
(ax + b)2 + . . . +
An
(ax + b)n .
Example 6.3.1. The decomposition into partial fractions of 
x
(x−2)3  has the form 
A
x −2 +
B
(x −2)2 +
C
(x −2)3 ,
where A, B and C are constants to be determined, while the decomposition into partial fractions of 
x
(x+1)(x−1)(x−2)3 has the form 
A
x + 1 +
B
x −1 +
C
x −2 +
D
(x −2)2 +
E
(x −2)3 .
Note that each term of the form 
A
(ax+b)n for n > 1 is easily integrated with the power rule: 
ˆ
A
(ax + b)n dx
=
A
a
ˆ du
un
u = ax + b
=
A
a
u1−n
1 −n + C =
A
a(1 −n)(ax + b)n−1 .
Example 6.3.2. Evaluate 
ˆ
x2
(x + 1)3 dx.
Solution. The fraction is already in lowest terms, so there is no need for long division. Moreover 
x2
(x + 1)3 =
A
x + 1 +
B
(x + 1)2 +
C
(x + 1)3 .

M6: Partial Fractions
To f﻿ind A, B and C, we will present two methods: in both, we start by rewriting the right hand side in 
(6.3.1) as one fraction, and identify the numerators: 
x2
(x + 1)3 = A(x + 1)2 + B(x + 1) + C
(x + 1)3
,
so that 
x2 = A(x + 1)2 + B(x + 1) + C.	
 
(6.3.2)
In the system method we rewrite the right hand side of (6.3.2) in standard form and identify the coefficients 
of same degree to form a system of equations of unknowns A, B and C: 
x2 = Ax2 + (B + 2A)x + (A + B + C) =⇒





A = 1
B + 2A = 0
A + B + C = 0
⇐⇒





A = 1
B = −2
C = 1
.
Thus, 
ˆ
x2
(x + 1)3 dx
=
ˆ
1
x + 1 −
2
(x + 1)2 +
1
(x + 1)3 dx
=
ln |x + 1| −
2
x + 1 −
1
2(x + 1)2 + C.
Alternatively, we can use the same idea as the handcover method, combined with differentiation, to find 
A, B and C from (6.3.2): Plugging in x = −1 yields 1 = C . If we differentiate (6.3.2), we obtain 
2x = 2A(x + 1) + B,
so that plugging in x = −1 yields −2 = B . If we differentiate again, we get 2 = 2A , that is, A = 1.
Example 6.3.3. Evaluate 
ˆ x4 −2x2 + 4x + 1
x3 −x2 −x + 1 dx.

−2x2 + 4x + 1
−x4 + x3 + x2 −x
x3 −x2 + 3x + 1

we see that 
x4 −2x2 + 4x + 1
x3 −x2 −x + 1

4x
x3 −x2 −x + 1.
Moreover,

(x −1)2(x + 1) =
A
x −1 +
B
(x −1)2 +
C
(x + 1).
	
 
(6.3.3)
To f﻿ind C, we can use handcover (multiply by x + 1 and set x = −1) to find C = −1. On the other hand, 
rewriting the right hand side of (6.3.3) as one fraction and identifying the numerators yields 
4x = A(x −1)(x + 1) + B(x + 1) + C(x −1)2,
in which x = 1 yields 4 = 2B , so that B = 2. Differentiating gives 
4 = A(x −1 + x + 1) + B + 2C(x −1)
in which x = 1 yields 4 = 2A + B , so that A = 1. Thus 
ˆ x4 −2x2 + 4x + 1

Abstract
This videos presents the form of the decomposition into partial fractions for a rational function 
whose denominator contains a (non-repeated) irreducible quadratic factor, goes over the 
method to integrate the corresponding term, and presents examples. 
If the denominator q(x) of a rational function 
r(x)
q(x) in lowest terms contains an irreducible quadratic term 
ax2 + bx + c  with b2 −4ac < 0, then the decomposition into partial fractions of 
r(x)
q(x) contains the term 
Ax + B
ax2 + bx + c,
where A and B are constants to be determined.

Example 6.4.1. For instance, the decomposition into partial fractions of 2x+3
x4+9x2  has the form 
2x + 3
x4 + 9x2 =
2x + 3
x2(x2 + 9) = A
x + B
x2 + Cx + D
x2 + 9 ,
where A, B, C and D are constants to be determined. On the other hand 
5x + 4
x2 + x + 1
is already a partial fraction and cannot be decomposed any further, since x2 + x + 1 is irreducible. 
Example 6.4.2. Evaluate 
ˆ 2x2 −x + 4
x3 + 4x
dx.
Solution. The form of the decomposition into partial fractions is 
2x2 −x + 4
x3 + 4x
= 2x2 −x + 4
x(x2 + 4)
= A
x + Bx + C
x2 + 4 .
To find A, B and C, we use the system method: 
2x2 −x + 4
=
A(x2 + 4) + Bx2 + Cx
=
(A + B)x2 + Cx + 4A
so that 





A + B = 2
C = −1
4A = 4
⇐⇒




C = −1
.

Abstract
These videos discuss the form of the decomposition into partial fraction for a rational function 
whose denominator contains a repeated irreducible quadratic factor, and how to integrate the 
corresponding terms in the decomposition. This is illustrated on examples. 
If the denominator q(x) of a rational function 
r(x)
q(x) in lowest terms contains a repeated irreducible 
quadratic term (ax2 + bx + c)n  with b2 −4ac < 0, then the decomposition into partial fractions of 
r(x)
q(x) 
contains the terms 
A1x + B1
ax2 + bx + c +
A2x + B2
(ax2 + bx + c)2 + . . . +
Anx + Bn
(ax2 + bx + c)n ,
where A1, . . . , An  and B1, . . . , Bn  are constants to be determined. 
Example 6.5.1. For instance, the form of the decomposition of 
4x + 5
(x + 1)(x −2)2(x2 + 4)(x2 + x + 1)2
is 
4x + 5
(x + 1)(x −2)2(x2 + 4)(x2 + x + 1)2 =

2)	 The substitution u := x +
b
2a yields an integral of the form 
ˆ
Cu + D
(u2 + α2)n du
3)	 Split the integral: 
ˆ
Cu + D
(u2 + α2)n du = C
ˆ
u
(u2 + α2)n du + D
ˆ
du
(u2 + α2)n .
4)	 The first integral can be calculated with the substitution v = u2 + α2: 
ˆ
u
(u2 + α2)n du = 1
2
ˆ dv
vn =
v1−n
2(1 −n).
5)	 The second integral can be calculated using trigonometric substitution as in Example 5.4.8: 
we use u = α tan θ  for −π
2 < θ < π
2  so that du = α sec2 θ dθ  and 
ˆ

α2n−1
ˆ
cos2(n−1) θ dθ,
and this can be evaluated as explained in Case 2 of Section 5.1. 
6)	 Rewrite your answer in terms of x.
Example 6.5.2. Evaluate 
ˆ 1 −x + 2x2 −x3
x(x2 + 1)2
dx.
Solution. The numerator has degree less than the denominator, so the form of the decomposition into 
partial fractions is 
1 −x + 2x2 −x3
x(x2 + 1)2
=
A
x + Bx + C
x2 + 1 + Dx + E
(x2 + 1)2
=
A(x2 + 1)2 + (Bx + C)x(x2 + 1) + (Dx + E)x
x(x2 + 1)2
,
so that, identifying numerators and reordering the terms on the right hand side, we have 
−x3 + 2x2 −x + 1 = x4(A + B) + x3(C) + x2(2A + B + D) + x(C + E) + A.

Solution. This is already a partial fraction of the type

M7: Improper Integrals
Theorem 7.3.1 (Comparison for improper integrals (type I)) If f and g are continuous on [a, ∞) with 
f(x) ≥g(x) ≥0
x ≥a
then 
1)	 If 
´ ∞
a f(x) dx  is convergent, so is 
´ ∞
a g(x) dx . 
2)	 If 
´ ∞
a g(x) dx  is divergent, so is 
´ ∞
a f(x) dx . 
Theorem 7.3.2 (Comparison for improper integrals (type II)) If f and g are continuous on [a, b) and 
discontinuous at b with 
f(x) ≥g(x) ≥0
a ≤x < b
then 
1)	 If ´ b
a f(x) dx  is convergent, so is ´ b
a g(x) dx . 
2)	 If ´ b
a g(x) dx  is divergent, so is ´ b
a f(x) dx . 
Remark 7.3.3. We leave it to you to write out the obvious analogues of Theorem 7.3.1 for integrals of the 
type 
´ b
−∞f(x) dx  and of  Theorem 7.3.2  for integrals of the type ´ b

Example 7.3.4. Is

Solution. For x ≥1, we have x2 ≥x  and thus 
e−x ≥e−x2 ≥0.

Solution. Since

Introduction to parametric curves

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yaxDE-NOI0&list=PLm168eGEcBjnS6ecJflh7BTDaUB6jShIL&in
dex=51 
Abstract
These two videos introduce the notion of a parametric curve and of parametric equations for 
such a curve. They show on examples that there are many ways to parametrize a curve. An 
example of parametric curve is sketched, and a parametrization is found for a curve described 
by mechanical motion. 
A parametric curve in the plane is the image of parametric equations 

x = f(t)
y = g(t)
, t ∈I
where t is the parameter, ranging in an interval I. A given (parametric) curve in the plane may have a 
number of parametrizations, that is, sets of parametric equations that represent the curve. One might think 
of a parametric curve as the trajectory of a moving object (in the plane), and of parametric equations as 
describing the position at a given time, hence encoding how the curve is traced out (in what direction, 
at what speed, etc).
For instance, the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 can be parametrized by 

x = cos t
y = sin t
∈
π

x = cos(2t)
y = sin(2t)
∈
π

x = cos(2t)
y = sin(2t)
t∈[0,2π)(the circle is then described twice counterclockwise)

x = sin t
y = cos t
∈
π

M8: Parametric Curves
To sketch a parametric curve (from parametric equations), we study the variations of x and y as functions 
of the parameter t, and trace out the corresponding curve in the xy-plane. 
Example 8.1.1. Sketch the curve given by 

x = cos t
y = sin(2t)
t ∈[0, 2π].
Solution. We draw x(t) and y(t) and then follow for various values of the parameter t the corresponding 
pair of coordinates (x, y). On the picture below, we have represented in particular the point on the curve 
corresponding to t = π
4 .
 
Example 8.1.2. The cycloid is the trajectory of a point on a circle rolling without sliding on a straight line.

M8: Parametric Curves
We establish that, calling r the radius of the circle, and θ the angle between the radius joining the center 
of the circle with the point of contact of the circle with the straight line, and the radius joining the center 
to the point whose trajectory we study, as below,
 
the equations 

x = r (θ −sin θ)
y = r (1 −cos θ)
θ ∈(−∞, ∞)
form parametric equations describing the cycloid.

Abstract
In these videos, we study how to obtain the slope of the tangent line to a parametric curve at 
a point of given parameter, and how to find the points of a curve where the tangents have a 
given slope, are horizontal, or vertical. This is used to sketch a parametric curve.
Proposition 8.2.1. If f and g are differentiable functions and 

x = f(t)
y = g(t)
t ∈I
are parametric equations of a curve, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at (f(a), g(a)) for a ∈I  is 
given by 
dy
dx |t=a =
dy
dt |t=a
dx
dt |t=a
= y′(a)
x′(a),
provided that x′(a) ̸= 0. 
Note that if x′(a) = 0 and y′(a) ̸= 0 then the curve has a vertical tangent at the point of parameter a, 
while the tangent is horizontal if x′(a) ̸= 0 and y′(a) = 0. 
Example 8.2.2. Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve 

x = t2 + t
y = t2 −t
at the point of parameter t = 0.

M8: Parametric Curves
Solution. The point of parameter 0 is (x(0), y(0)) = (0, 0). The slope of the tangent line is 
y′(0)
x′(0) = 2t + 1
2t −1 |t=0
= 1
−1 = −1,
so that the tangent line is y = −x .
Example 8.2.3. Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve 

x = e
√
t
y = t −ln(t2)
at the point of parameter t = 1.
Solution. The point of parameter 1 is (x(1), y(1)) = (e, 1). The slope of the tangent line is 
y′(1)
x′(1) = 1 −2
t

√

|t=1

Thus, an equation of the tangent line is 
y −1 = −2
e (x −e) .
Example 8.2.4. Find the points on the curve 
	

x = t(t2 −3)
y = 3(t2 −3)
where the tangent line is horizontal or vertical. Sketch the curve.
Solution. Since 
dy
dx = y′(t)
x′(t) =
6t
3t2 −3 =
2t
(t −1)(t + 1),
we see that the curve has an horizontal tangent when t = 0, that is, at (x(0), y(0)) = (0, −9), and a vertical 
tangent when t = −1 and when t = 1, that is, at 
(x(1), y(1)) = (−2, −6)
(x(−1), y(−1)) = (2, −6).

To sketch the curve, we can start with this information, combined with the variations of x(t) and y(t):
 
Following the variations of x(t) and y(t), a rough sketch indicates a self-intersection:
 
We can calculate explicitly the coordinates of this self-intersection point: two values t1 and t2 of the 
parameter correspond to the same point if 

t1(t2
1 −3) = t2(t2

Symmetry; concavity

ex=54 
Abstract
This video illustrates on the example of the astroid how to use symmetry to reduce the study of 
the curve to a smaller interval of the parameter, and how to study the concavity of the curve. 
Symmetry
A parametric curve can admit one or more axis of symmetry, as well as center of symmetry. There are 
different ways this can be reflected by the parametric equations. In the example treated here the curve 
has parametric equations 

x(θ) = 4 cos3 θ
y(θ) = 4 sin3 θ 	
 
(8.3.1)
and the interval for θ is not specified, but we want to study the curve on an interval large enough for us 
to be able to draw out the whole curve.
The first observation is that both x and y are 2π -periodic, so that we can restrict the study to interval 
of length 2π , for instance [−π, π]. 
The second observation is that 

x(−θ) = x(θ)
y(−θ) = −y(θ)
so that when a point of coordinates (x, y) is on the curve, so is the point of coordinates (x, −y). In other 
words, the x-axis is an axis of symmetry for the curve and the transformation of the parameter θ →−θ  
corresponds to this reflection about y = 0. Thus, we can study the curve on [0, π] and obtain the second 
half of the curve by symmetry with respect to the x-axis.
Third, we observe that 

x (π −θ) = −x(θ)
y(π −θ) = y(θ)

A youtube Calculus Workbook (Part II)
134 
M8: Parametric Curves
so that (−x, y) is on the curve whenever (x, y) is. In other words, the y-axis is also an axis of symmetry 
for the curve, and θ →π −θ  corresponds to the reflection about x = 0. Thus we can study the curve 
on [0, π
2 ] and obtain the other half of the part of the curve corresponding to [0, π] by symmetry with 
respect to the y-axis.
Concavity
Just like for graphs of functions, the concavity of the curve depends on the sign of d2y
dx2  along the curve. 
Specifically, the curve is concave up when d2y
dx2 > 0 and concave down when d2y
dx2 < 0. To find d2y
dx2  in terms 
of the parameter, say t, note that 
d2y
dx2 = d

Sketching the graph
Returning to the example (8.3.1), we have seen that we only need to study the variations of x and y over 
[0, π
2 ] and then use symmetries with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis to complete the curve: 
x′(θ)

Abstract
This video extrapolates from the case of the graph of a continuous positive function to obtain 
a formula for the area between a parametric curve and the x-axis. This is illustrated on the 
case of the astroid. 
For the graph y = f(x) of a non-negative continuous function f, 
 
the area under the graph over [a, b] is 
ˆ b
a
f(x) dx =
ˆ b
a
y dx.
If we re-parametrize y = f(x) in terms of a parameter t ∈[α, β], where x(α) = a , x(β) = b  and the 
curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from α to β, we can then rewrite the integral as 
ˆ b

y dx =
ˆ β

A formula for the length of a piece of parametric curve is established and applied to a pair of 
examples.
Theorem 8.5.2 (Arc Length) Let C be a curve of parametric equations 

x = f(t)
y = g(t)

Solution. x(t) and y(t) are continuous with continuous derivatives, and the curve is traversed once as t 
in increases from 0 to 4 because x(t) and y(t) are one-to-one on [0, 4]. Thus the length of the curve is

M9: Polar Curves
To define a system of polar coordinates in the plane, we need to fix a point O, called pole, and a half-ray 
with O as origin called polar axis, and a unit of length. A point in the plane is then given by its distance 
to the pole r and the angle θ between the (positive) polar axis and the half-ray joining the pole to the 
point. The point is then given by the polar coordinates (r, θ) as shown below:
 
Of course, in this system the pole has an infinite number of pairs of polar coordinates, because (0, θ) 
represents the pole, regardless of the value of θ. On the other hand, all other points of the plane are 
represented by unique polar coordinates only if we restrict ourselves to r ≥0 and θ ∈[0, 2π). We will 
not always make this assumption, in which case each point has many pairs of polar coordinates:

Polar system and Cartesian system
By convention, when a Cartesian system of coordinates is available, the associated polar system has the 
origin of the Cartesian system as pole, the positive x-axis as polar axis, and the same unit of length as 
the Cartesian system.

Abstract
These two videos give (sometimes rough) sketches of simple polar curves and polar regions 
of the plane.
Example 9.2.1. Find an equation in Cartesian coordinates of the curves given by the following equations 
in polar coordinates: 
1)	 	r = 2.
Solution. As r2 = x2 + y2, this is the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, of Cartesian 
equation 
x2 + y2 = 4.

2)	 	θ = 3π

Solution. This is the set of points of the plane on the line making an angle of 3π
4  with the positive 
x-axis, that is, y = −x . Indeed, the pole is on the curve, and for x ̸= 0, we have tan θ = y
x, that is, 
y = tan 3π
4 x = −x.
 
3)	 	r = 3 sin θ .
Solution. Since sin θ = y
r , we can rewrite this curve as r2 = 3y , that is, in Cartesian coordinates 
x2 + y2 = 3y

Example 9.2.3. Sketch the polar curve r = sin(2θ).
Solution. To sketch the curve, we first draw r = sin(2θ) in the Cartesian coordinates θ and r in 
order to visualize the variations of r in terms of θ. Then we follow these variations in the polar 
coordinates (r, θ): to this end, for each half ray through the origin defined by a value of θ, we 
plot the point at (signed) distance r(θ) on this half-ray. Parts of the resulting curve traced out 
that way are sketched below for θ gradually increasing from 0 to 3π

Abstract
In these two videos, a formula is established for the slope of the tangent line to a polar curve 
at a given point of the curve, tangent lines at the pole are examined, and several examples of 
polar curves are sketched. 
Polar curves r = f(θ) can be seen, via (9.1.1), as parametric curves of the parameter θ: 

x = r cos θ = f(θ) cos θ
y = r sin θ = f(θ) sin θ
, 0 ≤θ ≤2π.
Thus Proposition 8.2.1 regarding the slope of the tangent line to a parametric curve applies here to the 
effect that the slope of the tangent line to the point of r = f(θ) corresponding to θ = θ0 is 
dy
dx |θ=θ0
= y′(θ0)
x′(θ0) = f ′(θ0) sin θ0 + f(θ0) cos θ0
f ′(θ0) cos θ0 −f(θ0) sin θ0
. 	 
(9.3.1)
Note also that when the curve goes through the pole for θ = θ0, that is, when f(θ0) = 0, then 
dy
dx |θ=θ0
= tan θ0
is the slope of the line θ = θ0, which is the corresponding tangent line! 
Example 9.3.1. Find the slope of the tangent lines to the polar curve r = sin(2θ) (see Example 
9.2.3) for θ = π
4 and θ = π
2. 
Solution. Since r′(θ) = 2 cos(2θ), (9.3.1) gives 
dy
dx |θ= π

On the other hand, for θ = π
2, r = 0, so that the corresponding tangent line at the pole is the vertical 
line θ = π
2 (or x = 0).
Example 9.3.2 (Cardioid) Sketch the polar curve r = 1 −cos θ .
Solution. First we look at the variations of r as a function of θ. Since r′(θ) = sin θ , we have:
 
Moreover, r = 0 for θ = 0 and θ = 2π , so that the tangent at the pole is horizontal. The tangent line at 
θ has slope 
dy
dx = r′ sin θ + r cos θ
r′ cos θ −r sin θ = sin2 θ −cos2 θ + cos θ
2 sin θ cos θ −sin θ
,
so that the slope for θ = π
2 is −1, the slope at π  is infinite and the tangent is therefore vertical, and the 
slope for θ = 3π
2  is 1. Taking all this into account, we obtain the following sketch:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Abstract
 In this video, various ways of defining a sequence are examined. 
Formally, a sequence of real numbers is a real valued function defined on the set N  of natural numbers: 
s : N →R . Thus a sequence is determined by the ordered list of its values 
{s(1), s(2), . . . , s(n), . . .}
which we denote {s(n)}∞
n=1, where the index n is an integer ranging from 1 to ∞, that is, ranging over 
N . To avoid to have too many parenthesis, we write 
sn := s(n)
for the nth value in the ordered list, and accordingly, the sequence is denoted 
{sn}∞
n=1 .
A sequence can be defined in various ways: 
•	 By an explicit formula giving the nth term. For instance 
	
 n + 1
n2 + 2
∞
n=1
=
2
3, 1
2, 4
11, . . .

.
When a sequence is given under this form, it is easy to calculate any term in the sequence, by 
simply plugging in the corresponding value of n. For example, the 1000nd  term in the above 
sequence is 1000
106+2.

•	 By the first few terms, thus implying a specific pattern. For instance, if a sequence is given 
by its first 5 terms {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, . . .} , it is implicitly understood that we are considering the 
sequence of odd integers, which could also be given explicitly as {2n −1}∞
n=1. 
•	 The ordered list may start at a number different from 1. For instance 

n2 −9
∞
n=3 =

n2 −9

n≥3 =

0,

7,4, . . .

is a well-defined sequence. 
•	 By a non-numeric definition of the nth term. For instance, {pn}∞
n=1, where pn is the world 
population n years from today 
•	 By induction, that is, by giving the first term or first few terms, and a rule to calculate the 
next term from the preceding one(s). For instance, a sequence {an}∞
n=1 can by defined 
inductively by 

a1 = 1
an+1 =
1
1+an
n.
Then 
a1
=
1
a2 = a1+1
=
1
1 + a1
= 1
2
a3 = a2+1
=
1
1 + a2
=
1
1 + 1
2
= 2
3
a4 = a3+1
=
1
1 + a3
=
1
1 + 2
3
= 3
5
When a sequence is defined this way, it is computationally much more costly to calculate a 
given term, as you first need to calculate all the preceding terms. 
•	 A sequence can be defined by induction by giving more than one initial term, and a relation 
of induction that depends on more than one preceding terms. For instance, the Fibonacci 
sequence {fn}∞
n=1 is defined by 

f1 = f2 = 1
fn+2 = fn+1 + fn
n.
Thus, to obtain one term, you add the two preceding ones. Thus the sequence’s first few terms are 
{1, 1, 1 + 1, 2 + 1, 3 + 2, 5 + 3, . . .} = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . .}.

if the values an can be made as close to L as we want by taking n sufficiently large, that is, if for every 
ϵ > 0, there is N ∈N  such that 
n ≥N =⇒|an −L| < ϵ.
If a sequence has a finite limit, we say that it is convergent. Otherwise, we say that it is divergent. 
As a direct result of the definition, we have: 
Proposition 10.2.2. If f : R →R  and f(n) = an  for all n then 
lim
x→∞f(x) = L =⇒lim
n→∞an = L.
Example 10.2.3.

Abstract
This video introduces the notions of (eventually) non-decreasing and (eventually) non-
increasing sequence, of monotonic sequence, of lower and upper bounds for a sequence, as well 
as greatest lower bound and least upper bound. It is shown that an eventually non-decreasing 
sequences that is bounded above is convergent and that an eventually non-increasing sequence 
that is bounded below is convergent.
Definition 10.3.1. A sequence {an}∞
n=1 is 
•	 increasing if an+1 > an  for all n; 
•	 eventually increasing if there is n0 with an+1 > an  for all n ≥n0; 
•	 (eventually) non-decreasing if an+1 ≥an  for all n  (for all n ≥n0, for some n0) 
•	 (eventually) decreasing if an+1 < an  for all n  (for all n ≥n0, for some n0) 
•	 (eventually) non-increasing if an+1 ≤an  for all n  (for all n ≥n0, for some n0) 
•	 (eventually) monotonic if it is either (eventually) non-decreasing or (eventually) non-
increasing. 
Example 10.3.2. {n}∞
n=1 is increasing, thus non-decreasing, thus monotonic.
 1
n
∞
n=1 is decreasing, thus non-increasing, thus monotonic.
The constant sequence {1}∞
n=1 is both non-decreasing and non-increasing. 
The sequence {(−1)n}∞
n=1 is not monotonic.
Definition 10.3.3. A sequence {an}∞
n=1 is 
•	 bounded above if there is a number M (called an upper bound) such that an ≤M  for all n; 
•	 bounded below if there is a number B (called a lower bound) such that an ≥B  for all n; 
•	 bounded if it is bounded above and below. 
Example 10.3.4. The sequence {n}∞
n=1 is monotonic but not bounded (above).

The sequence

n=1 is bounded but not monotonic.
Proposition 10.3.5. If a sequence is bounded above it has a least upper bound. If it is bounded below it 
has a greatest lower bound. 
The least upper bound sup{an}∞
n=1 of the sequence {an}∞
n=1 satisfies 
ϵ > 0
nϵ
anϵ > sup{an}∞
n=1 −ϵ 	
 
(10.3.1)
Similarly, the greatest lower bound inf{an}∞
n=1 of the sequence {an}∞
n=1 satisfies 
ϵ > 0
nϵ
anϵ < inf{an}∞
n=1 + ϵ.	
 
(10.3.2)
Theorem 10.3.6. If a sequence is eventually non-decreasing and bounded above, it is convergent. If a 
sequence is eventually non-increasing and bounded below, it is convergent. 
Note also: 
Proposition 10.3.7. A convergent sequence is bounded.

M10: Sequences and Series
Note that if {an}∞
n=1 is convergent and f is continuous, then, in view of Proposition 10.2.5, 
L = lim
n→∞an = lim
n→∞an+1 = lim
n→∞f(an) = f(L).
Thus: 
Proposition 10.4.1 If {an}∞
n=1 is defined by (10.4.1) where f is continuous, then the only possible limits 
for {an}∞
n=1 are the fixed points of f, that is, values L such that 
f(L) = L.
Therefore, to find the limit (if any) of a sequence defined recursively as in (10.4.1), we first need to 
establish convergence, usually via Proposition 10.3.5, and then find the limit among the fixed points of f.
In order to apply Proposition 10.3.5, we will sometimes have to show that a sequence defined by (10.4.1) 
is increasing (decreasing), and bounded above (below), and a convenient way to do that is by induction:
To prove that a property P(n) is true for all natural numbers n, it is enough to show that P(1) is true 
and that for all n, 
P(n) =⇒P(n + 1). 	
 
(10.4.2)
Indeed, if P(1) is true, then by (10.4.2) with n = 1, P(2) is true, so that by (10.4.2) with n = 2, P(3) is 
true, and so on. We conclude by induction that P(n) is true for all natural number n. 
Example 10.4.2. Is the sequence defined recursively by 

a1 = 1
an+1 = 3 −
1
an
n 	
 
(10.4.3)
convergent? If yes, find its limit.
Solution. We will first show that the sequence is increasing, then that it is bounded, so that we 
will conclude by Proposition 10.3.5 that the sequence is convergent. 
To show that it is increasing, we proceed by induction to show an+1 > an  for all n. This is true for 
n = 1 for a1 = 1 < a2 = 3 −1
1 = 2. Assume that this is true for a given n. We want to show that it is 
then necessarily also true for n + 1, that is, that an+2 > an+1. To this end, note that

We conclude by induction that {an}∞

Note that 0 < 1 ≤an  for all n for {an}∞
n=1 is increasing and a1 = 1. We show, by induction as well, that 
an ≤3 for all n. It is true if n = 1, as a1 = 1 ≤3. Assume now that an ≤3. Then

Abstract
In these videos, we examine the different possibilities for the convergence of a sequence defined 
by (10.4.1) where f has fixed points, depending on the function and the initial condition. It is 
also shown that a sequence converges to L if and only if the subsequences of odd index and 
of even index both converge to L. This is illustrated on an example. 
When a sequence is defined by (10.4.1), we can track the terms of the sequence geometrically on the 
graph of f, using also the line y = x . Note that the fixed points of f, that is, the potential limits of the 
sequence, are obtained as intersection points of the graph y = f(x) with y = x . Whether the sequence 
converges or not often depends on the initial term a1.

As we can see on the right hand side of the picture above, the sequence may converge “spiraling” around 
the limit, that is, without being (eventually) monotonic, which prevents a direct application of Proposition 
10.3.5. However, we see that the terms of the sequence are successively above and below the limit. Hence 
the subsequences indexed by odd and by even numbers are monotonic, so that Proposition 10.3.5 can 
be applied to these subsequences. Moreover, we establish: 
Proposition 10.5.1. Let {an}∞
n=1 be a sequence and L a real number. Then 
lim
n→∞an = L ⇐⇒
lim
n→∞a2n = lim
n→∞a2n+1 = L.
Example 10.5.2. Is the sequence {an}∞
n=1 defined by 

a1 = 1
an+1 =
1
1+an
n
convergent? If yes, find its limit.
Solution. Examining the first few terms: 
a1 = 1; a2 =
1
1 + 1 = 1
2; a3 =
1
1 + 1
2
= 2
3; a4 =
1
1 + 2
3
= 3
5; a5 =
1
1 + 3
5
= 5
8; a6 =
1
1 + 5
8
= 8
13 . . .
we see that a2 ≤a4 ≤a6 . . . and that a1 ≥a3 ≥a5 . . ., and thus we set out to show, by induction, that 
{a2n}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing and that {a2n+1}∞
n=1 is non-increasing. 
Thus, we want to show that a2(n+1) = a2n+2 ≥a2n  for all n. It is true for n = 1 because a4 ≥a2. 
Assume that it is true for n. To show that it is then necessarily true for n + 1, note that 
a2n+2 ≥a2n
=⇒
1 + a2n+2 ≥1 + a2n
=⇒
1
1 + a2n
≥
1
1 + a2n+2
=⇒
a2n+1 ≥a2n+3
=⇒
1
1 + a2n+3
≥
1
1 + a2n+1
=⇒
a2n+4 = a2(n+2) ≥a2n+2 = a2(n+1)
and we conclude by induction that {a2n}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing, and a similar argument would show 
that {a2n+1}∞
n=1 is non-increasing. Note that we have showed that f(x) =
1
1+x  is decreasing, and thus 
f ◦f  is increasing.

We then show (by induction) that {a2n}∞

2 ≤1 and a3 = 2
3 ≥1
2. Assume that it is true for n, that is, 
a2n ≤1
a2n+1 ≥1
2.
Since a2n+2 = f ◦f(a2n) and a2n+3 = f ◦f(a2n+1), we conclude from the fact that f ◦f  is increasing that

a2n+3 ≥f ◦f

so that the property is true for n + 1 and we conclude by induction. 
Therefore, {a2n}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing and bounded above, hence convergent by Proposition 10.3.5, and 
{a2n+1}∞
n=1 is non-increasing and bounded below, hence convergent. In view of Proposition 10.4.1 and 
the fact that 
a2(n+1) = f ◦f(a2n)
a2(n+1)+1 = f ◦f(a2n+1)
their respective limits are among the fixed points of 
f ◦f(x) =

to see whether we can make sense of an infinite sum. The geometric interpretation

Abstract
In this video, we establish a criterion for divergence of a series, often referred to as the nth term 
Test, stating that if the sequence of terms does not converge to 0, then the series is divergent.
Theorem 10.7.1. If ∞
n=1 an is convergent then limn→∞an = 0. 
Equivalently: 
Theorem 10.7.2 (nth term Test). If limn→∞an ̸= 0 then ∞
n=1 an is divergent.
Example 10.7.3. Are the following series convergent or divergent: 
1)	 	∞
n=1
2n
3n+1
Solution. limn→∞
2n
3n+1 = 2
3 ̸= 0, so that, by the nth term Test, the series ∞
n=1
2n
3n+1 is divergent.
2)	 	∞
n=1 arctann
Solution. limn→∞arctann = π
2 ̸= 0 so that, by the nth term Test, the series ∞
n=1 arctann  is 
divergent.
3)	 	
∞
n=1
(n+1)2
n(n+2)
Solution. limn→∞
(n+1)2
n(n+2) = 1 ̸= 0 so that, by the nth term Test, the series

n(n+2) is 
divergent.

The converse of Theorem 10.7.2 is false! That is, there are sequences {an}∞

the sequence {sn}∞

Abstract
In these videos, we define geometric sequences and geometric series, examine when they 
converge, and obtain a formula for the sum of a convergent geometric series.
Definition 10.8.1. A geometric sequence of common ratio r is a sequence whose terms are of the form 
a1, a2 = a1r, a3 = a2r = a1r2, . . . , an = an−1r = a1rn−1, . . .
A geometric sequence is determined by its first term a and its common ratio r and can then be written 
in standard form as 

a · rn−1∞
n=1 .
Example 10.8.2. The sequence with first terms 
1)	 	5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, . . . is geometric with common ratio 2 and first term 5, that is, the 
sequence can be written 

5 · 2n−1∞
n=1 =

2 · 2n
∞
n=1
= {5 · 2n}∞

where the last two forms are easily seen to be equal to the standard form. It is sometimes 
convenient to change index this way to obtain powers under a certain form.

Proposition 10.8.3. The geometric sequence {a · rn−1}∞
n=1 is 
1)	 	convergent to 0 if |r| < 1; 
2)	 	divergent if |r| > 1; 
3)	 	constant (and thus convergent) if r = 1; 
4)	 	divergent if r = −1. 
Definition 10.8.4. A geometric series is a series whose sequence of terms is geometric. Thus it can be 
written in standard form as 
∞

n=1
arn−1.
In view of Proposition 10.8.3 and Theorem 10.7.2, a geometric series of common ratio r with |r| ≥1 is 
divergent. Moreover,

Example 10.8.7 (Decimal expansion of rational numbers and geometric series) You may know that 
decimal numbers with expansions that are either finite or periodic are the rationals, that is, numbers 
that can be written as the quotient of two integers. For a finite expansion, it is easy to see. For instance 
3.456 = 3456
1000.
What about periodic expansions? For instance, can we write 
0.73 := 0.737373 . . .
as a fraction of two integers? The pattern that repeats corresponds to 73
100 for the first two digits after 0, 
73
10000 for the next two, 
73
1000000 for the next two, and so on. Thus

Abstract
In this video, we obtain the exact sum for some series with telescoping sums. A result on the 
constant multiple and sum of convergent series is stated and applied on examples. 
In general, it is difficult to find the exact sum of a convergent series. We just saw that geometric series are 
an exception. Another case where we can obtain exact sums is that of a series with so called telescoping 
sums, for which most terms in the partial sums cancel out. 
Example 10.9.1. Is the series 
∞

n=1
1
n2 + n
convergent? If yes, find its sum.
Solution. Note that 
1
n2+n can be decomposed into partial fractions as 
1
n2 + n =
1
n(n + 1) = 1
n −

In this case, we can represent the terms f(1), f(2), . . . , f(n), . . . of the series as areas of rectangles, in 
order to compare the partial sum with integrals of f, as shown below:

Solution. The series is of the form 
∞
n=1 f(n) for f(x) = xe−x2. This function is continuous 
and positive on [1, ∞). Moreover, it is decreasing on this interval, for

Abstract
In this video, we present the Comparison Test for series and apply it to conclude on the 
convergence of various examples of series. 
If 
0 ≤an ≤bn
and 
sn =
n

i=1
ai and tn =
n

i=1
bn
then sn ≤tn for all n, and both sequences of partial sums {sn}∞
n=1 and {tn}∞
n=1 are non-decreasing. 
Thus, if {tn}∞
n=1 is convergent, then {sn}∞
n=1 is non-decreasing and bounded above, hence convergent. 
On the other hand, if {sn}∞
n=1 is divergent, then limn→∞sn = ∞ and as tn ≥sn, limn→∞tn = ∞. In 
other words:

ex=83
Abstract
In this video, we examine how to control the error made when approximating the sum of a 
series by a partial sum, when we used the Comparison Test to conclude on convergence. 
If we established the convergence of a series ∞
n=1 an using the Comparison Test, then we had 
0 ≤an ≤bn
n 
(11.6.1)
and ∞
n=1 bn convergent. Note that if 
Rn =
∞

i=n+1
ai and Tn =
∞

i=n+1
bi,
then 
Rn ≤Tn
because of (11.6.1). In many cases, ∞
n=1 bn is a p-series or a geometric series, and we can estimate  
Tn, thus Rn. 
Example 11.6.1. Find n such that the nth partial sum of 
∞

n=1
1
n4 + 5
has at least four exact decimal places.
Solution. Since 
0 ≤
1
n4 + 5 ≤1
n4
and ∞
n=1
1
n4 is a convergent p-series ( p = 4 > 1), we conclude by the Comparison Test that ∞
n=1
1
n4+5 
is convergent. Moreover 
Rn =

Thus, Rn ≤

3n3 ≤10−5 which amounts to 
n ≥

Thus

i=1

i4 + 5 ≈

n=1

n4 + 5
with an error of at most 10−5, and thus at least 4 exact decimal places.
Example 11.6.2. Find n such that the nth partial sum of 
∞

n=1
2
3n + 5
has at least three exact decimal places.
Solution. Since 
0 ≤

3n + 5 ≤2
3n
and ∞
n=1
2
3n = ∞
n=1 2
 1

n is a geometric series of common ratio 1

conclude by the Comparison Test that ∞
n=1

3n+5 is convergent. Moreover 
Rn =

3i + 5 ≤Tn =

i=n+1

3i =

3n+1

3n .
Thus, we can ensure that Rn ≤10−4 by requiring 
1
3n ≤10−4 ⇐⇒log3(104) ≤n.
Since log3(104) ≈8.3, we conclude that 
s9 =
9

i=1
2
3i + 5 ≈

n=1
2
3n + 5
with an error of at most 10_4 and thus at lest 3 exact decimal places.

Note that an alternating series ∞
n=1 an can be written under the form 
∞

n=1
(−1)n bn or
∞

n=1
(−1)n−1bn where bn = |an| ≥0.
Theorem 12.1.3 (Alternating Series Test)  An alternating series 
∞
n=1(−1)n−1bn  or 
∞
n=1(−1)nbn, where 
bn ≥0 for all n, {bn}∞
n=1 is eventually non-increasing, and 
lim
n→∞bn = 0
is convergent.
Example 12.1.4. Are the following series convergent?  
1.	
∞
n=1(−1)n−1 1
n
Solution. Since 
 1
n
∞
n=1 is decreasing with limit 0 and the series is alternating, the Alternating 
Series Test applies to the effect that ∞
n=1(−1)n−1 1
n  is convergent.
2.	
∞
n=1(−1)n 1
√n
Solution. Since 

1
√n
∞
n=1 is decreasing with limit 0 (because √x  is increasing with 
limx→∞
√x = ∞) and the series is alternating, the Alternating Series Test applies to the effect 
that 
∞
n=1(−1)n 1
√n  is convergent.

ln(n+1)
Solution. Since 

1
ln(n+1)

n=1 is decreasing with limit 0 (because ln x is increasing with 
limx→∞ln x = ∞) and the series is alternating, the Alternating Series Test applies to the

Abstract
In this video, the notions of absolute convergence and of conditional convergence are introduced. 
It is shown that an absolutely convergent series is also convergent. Examples are examined to 
determined if a series is absolutely convergent, conditionally convergent, or divergent.
Definition 12.2.1. A series 
∞
n=1 an is absolutely convergent if ∞
n=1 |an|  is convergent, and conditionally 
convergent  if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent.

Abstract
In this video, we examine upper bounds for the error made in approximating the sum of a 
series that converges by the Alternating Series Test by a partial sum.
Proposition 12.3.1. If an alternating series ∞
n=1(−1)n−1bn  converges by the Alternating Series Test (that 
is, bn ≥0, {bn}∞
n=1 is eventually non-increasing and limn→∞bn = 0) then the error Rn = ∞
i=n+1(−1)i−1bi  
made in approximating ∞
n=1(−1)n−1bn  by the nth partial sum sn = n
i=1(−1)i−1bi  satisfies 
|Rn| ≤bn+1.
In other words, the first neglected term is an upper bound for the error.

Solution. The sequence

n=1 is decreasing with limit 0, so that Proposition 12.3.1

Examining the values of (2n + 1)! as n grows we have 3! = 6, 5! =120, 7! = 5040, and

Abstract
In this video, we state and prove the Ratio Test.
Theorem 13.1.1 (Ratio Test)   
1.	 If 
lim
n→∞

an+1
an
 = L < 1
then ∞
n=1 an is absolutely convergent, hence convergent. 
2.	 If 
lim
n→∞

an+1
an
 = L > 1
limn→∞
 an+1
an
 = ∞
then ∞
n=1 an is divergent. 
3.	 If 
lim
n→∞

an+1
an
 = 1
the test is inconclusive. 
Example 13.1.2. The Ratio Test is indeed inconclusive if limn→∞
 an+1
an
 = 1, as we can see from the fact 
that limn→∞
 an+1
an
 = 1 if an = 1
n and if an =
1
n2 , but ∞
n=1
1
n is divergent and ∞
n=1
1
n2 is convergent. 
Thus limn→∞
 an+1
an
 = 1 doesn’t give any indication regarding the convergence of the series.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

depending on whether n is even or odd. Thus, 
 an+1

with limit ∞ and a subsequence with limit 0. Yet, we ought to be able to conclude by “comparison” to 
the geometric series ∞

The alternative is: 
Theorem 13.3.2 (Root Test)   
1.	 If

n
|an| = L < 1
then ∞
n=1 an is absolutely convergent, hence convergent. 
2.	 If 
lim

n

n
|an| = ∞
then ∞
n=1 an is divergent. 
3.	 If

n
|an| = 1
then the Test is inconclusive. 
Example 13.3.3. We see that the Root Test is inconclusive when limn→∞

Strategies to test series for convergence (M14)

&index=92 
Abstract
In this video, we discuss strategies to decide which of the various Tests we have seen should 
be applied to decide on the convergence of a series. 
When we want to decide if a series 
∞
n=1 an is convergent, you may want to approach it following these 
guidelines: 
1.	 What is limn→∞an?  
lim
n→∞an ̸= 0 =⇒
∞

n=1
an
nth
lim
n→∞an = 0 =⇒
2.	 Is the series a p-series ∞
n=1
k
np  or a geometric series ∞
n=1 arn−1? 
•	
p-series is convergent if and only if p > 1 
•	 geometric series of common ratio r is convergent if and only if |r| < 1, in which case 
∞

n=1
a · rn−1 =
a
1 −r .
3.	 Is the series “similar” to a p-series or a geometric series? Then use Direct (Theorem 11.4.1) 
or Limit Comparison (Theorem 11.5.1) with the appropriate p-series or geometric series. 
Note that Comparison only applies to series with positive terms, but if a series does not 
have only positive terms, these theorems can be applied to ∞
n=1 |an|  to obtain absolute 
convergence, hence convergence.
Example 13.4.1. To conclude about the convergence of 
∞
n=1
2n
3n−1+2, note that 
0 ≤
2n
3n−1 + 2 ≤
2n
3n−1 = 2
2
3
n−1
and that 
∞
n=1 2
 2
3
n−1 is a convergent geometric series for its common ratio 2
3 is in (−1, 1). By 
Comparison Test, 
∞
n=1
2n
3n−1+2 is also convergent.

n3 + 3n + 3

∞
n=1 bn = ∞

divergent p-series ( p = 1
2 ≤1). 
4.	 Is the series alternating, that is, of the form ∞
n=1(−1)nbn or ∞
n=1(−1)n−1bn  where 
bn ≥0 for all n?  If yes, the Alternating Series Test (Theorem 12.1.3) applies to the effect 
that the series is convergent provided that {bn}∞
n=1 is eventually non-increasing and that 
limn→∞bn = 0. 
5.	 Series with general terms defined in terms of products, quotients, powers, and particularly 
factorials, are usually handled by the Ratio Test (Theorem 13.1.1)

 simplify it, and find the limit 
as n goes to ∞. To this end, keep in mind that. 
ax
ay = ax−y and n! = 1 · 2 · 3 . . . · (n −1) · n,
so that for instance
n!
(n + 2)! =

Abstract
In this video, power series are defined and conditions for their convergence examined, leading 
to the definition of radius of convergence and interval of convergence. 
In the sequel, we use the convention that 
0! := 1.
Example 14.1.1. The series 
∞

n=1
xn
n!
is absolutely convergent for all x, by the Ratio Test, because 

an+1
an
 = |x|n+1
(n + 1)! · n!
|x|n =
|x|
n + 1
so that limn→∞
 an+1
an
 = 0 < 1 for all x. Thus 
f : x →
∞

n=1
xn
n!
is a well-defined function with domain (−∞, ∞). 
In this module, we will be interested in functions defined that way, and when a given function can be 
represented that way.

M15: Power Series and Taylor Series
Definition 14.1.2. A power series (centered at 0) is a series of the form 
∞

n=0
cnxn = c0 + c1x + c2x2 + . . . + cnxn + . . . ,
where x is a variable and all of the cn’s are constants, called coefficients of the power series. 
Of course 
f(x) :=
∞

n=0
cnxn
is only defined for values of x making the series converge. Thus we will want to determine the set of x’s 
making power series converge. 
Note that for x = 0, ∞
n=0 cnxn = c0 is always convergent. 
Example 14.1.3. If cn = 1 for all n, we obtain 
∞
n=0 xn  which is a geometric series of common ratio x. 
Thus 
∞
n=0 xn  converges if and only if |x| < 1 and then

so that 
∞
n=0 xn  is a function with domain (−1, 1). We will say that f(x) =
1
1−x  has a power series 
representation on (−1, 1). 
Example 14.1.4. For what values of x is the series ∞
n=0 n!xn convergent? 
Solution. If an := n!xn then

an
 = (n + 1)!|x|n+1

 an+1
an
 = 0 for x = 0. By the Ratio Test, we conclude 
that ∞
n=0 n!xn is divergent for all x ̸= 0 and convergent for x = 0.
Example 14.1.5. For what values of x is the series ∞

By the Ratio Test, we conclude that ∞

n  is absolutely convergent for |x| < 1 and divergent for 
|x| > 1. For |x| = 1, that is, x = ±1, we have to analyze the series separately:

M15: Power Series and Taylor Series
Examples 14.1.1, 14.1.3, 14.1.4 and 14.1.5 suggest that a series centered at 0 converges on an interval 
centered at 0 that may or may not contain the endpoints.
More generally, we will consider: 
Definition 14.1.6. A power series centered at a is a series of the form 
∞

n=0
cn(x −a)n = c0 + c1(x −a) + c2(x −a)2 + . . . + cn(x −a)n + . . .
where x is a variable and all of the cn’s are constants, called coefficients of the power series.
Theorem 14.1.7. Given a power series 
∞
n=0 cn(x −a)n , there are 3 possibilities: 
1.	
∞
n=0 cn(x −a)n  converges only for x = a; 
2.	
∞
n=0 cn(x −a)n  converges for all x; 
3.	 There is R > 0 such that ∞
n=0 cn(x −a)n  converges absolutely if |x −a| < R  and diverges if 
|x −a| > R . 
We call the value R in the third case the radius of convergence of the series . 
We include Case 1. in Theorem 14.1.7 by identifying that case with a radius of convergence R = 0. 
Similarly, allowing the radius of convergence R to be infinite recovers Case 2. in Theorem 14.1.7. 
Thus the series converges absolutely inside an interval centered at a of radius R (where R may also be 0 
or ∞) and diverges outside. As we have seen on the examples above, the series may or may not converge 
at the end points where |x −a| = R  and the two numerical series corresponding to x = a + R  and to 
x=a-R need to be tested for convergence separately. 
Including endpoints whenever applicable, we then obtain the interval of convergence, that is, the set of 
values of x for which the power series converge.

n

so that limn→∞
n
|an| = 0 for all x. By the Root Test, the series is convergent for all x and the interval

Example 14.2.7. Suppose that 
∞
n=0 cnxn converges when x = −4 and diverges when x = 6. Can we 
conclude about the convergence of: 
1.	
∞
n=0 cn
Solution. Since this is a power series centered at 0, its interval of convergence is centered at  
0. Because it converges for x = −4, it s radius of convergence R is at least 4. Because it diverges 
for x = 6, R is at most 6: 
4 ≤R ≤6.
Now

Abstract
In this video, we use the sum of a geometric series formula to find power series representations 
for various functions. 
Recall that a geometric series of common ratio x and first term 1 converges if and only if |x| < 1, and then 
∞

n=0
xn =
1
1 −x for all x with |x| < 1. 
(14.3.1)
We can see this formula as providing a power series representation of the function f(x) =
1
1−x  on the 
interval (−1, 1).
This basic observation can be used to find power series representation for more functions. 
Example 14.3.1. Find power series representations (on some interval to be specified) for the functions 
1.	 f(x) =
1
1+x
Solution. Note that 
f(x) =

Abstract
In this video, we state a theorem for term-by-term differentiation and integration of power 
series and apply it to find more power series representations, and estimate numerical integrals. 
If a power series 
∞

n=0
cn(x −a)n
has radius of convergence R, then it is absolutely convergent for |x −a| < R , and defines on this interval 
a function 
f(x) =
∞

n=0
cn(x −a)n.
It is natural to ask whether the function f is differentiable, and whether it can be differentiated “like a 
polynomial”, yielding a power series representation for f ′ . Dually, we ask whether f is integrable on this 
interval, and whether f can be integrated “like a polynomial”, yielding a power series representation for 
an antiderivative of f. The answers are all positive: 
Theorem 14.4.1. If the power series 
∞
n=0 cn(x −a)n  has radius of convergence R > 0, then 
f(x) = ∞
n=0 cn(x −a)n  is deifined on (a −R, a + R) and
1.	 f is differentiable on (a −R, a + R) and 
f ′(x) =
∞

n=1
n · cn(x −a)n−1 = c1 + 2c2(x −a) + 3c3(x −a)2 + . . .
and the series representing f ′  has radius of convergence R. 
2.	 f admits antiderivatives on (a −R, a + R) and on this interval 
ˆ
f(x) dx = C +
∞

n=0
cn
(x −a)n+1

and the series on the right hand side has radius of convergence R.

In this video, we use power series representations of functions to find the exact sums of various 
numerical series.
Example 14.6.1. Find:

Theorem 14.7.1. If a function f has a representation as a power series centered at a, it is necessarily 
represented by the series 
∞

n=0
f (n)(a)
n!
(x −a)n,
where f (n) denotes the nth  derivative of f and we use the convention that 0! = 1.
Definition 14.7.2. The series 
∞

n=0
f (n)(a)
n!
(x −a)n
is called Taylor series of f at a. When a = 0, we obtain the series 
∞

n=0
f (n)(0)
n!
xn,
called MacLaurin series of f.
Example 14.7.3. Find the MacLaurin series of f(x) = ex.
Solution. Since f ′(x) = f(x), we have by an immediate induction that f (n)(x) = f(x) = ex  
for all n. Thus 
f (n)(0)
n!
= e0
n! = 1
n!,
and the MacLaurin series of ex is 
∞

n=0
xn
n! ,
which has interval of convergence (−∞, ∞) as easily seen from the Ratio Test (see e.g., Example 13.2.4). 
Note that even though the series converges, we have not yet established that it converges to ex. We will 
consider this question in Section 14.9.

Abstract
 In this video, we find Taylor series explicitly for a number of examples. 
Example 14.8.1. Find the Taylor series of f(x) = 1 + x + x2 at a = 2.
Solution. Since f ′(x) = 1 + 2x , f ′′(x) = 2 and f (n)(x) ≡0 for all n ≥3, there Taylor series 
of f at 2 is 
f(0) + f ′(0)(x −2) + f ′′(0)
2
(x −2)2 = 7 + 5(x −2) + (x −2)2,
and is in fact a polynomial.

M15: Power Series and Taylor Series
Of course, the Taylor series of a polynomial of degree n is a polynomial of degree n: the same polynomial 
but written in terms of powers of (x −a) rather than in standard form.
Example 14.8.2. Find the Taylor series of f(x) = 1
x  at a = 1.
Solution. Note that f(x) = x−1 so that 
f (0)(x)
=
x−1
f (1)(x)
=
−x−2
f (2)(x)
=
(−1)(−2)x−3
f (3)(x)
=
(−1)(−2)(−3)x−4
f (n)(x)
=
(−1)(−2) . . . (−n)x−(n+1)
=
(−1)nn! x−(n+1).
Thus 
f (n)(1)
n!
= (−1)nn!
n!
= (−1)n

so that this pattern then repeats: f (5)(x) = f (1)(x), f (6)(x) = f (2)(x), and so on. In particular, derivatives 
of even order are of the form ± sin x  and those of odd order are of the form ± cosx . More specifically, 
we have

Example 14.8.4. Find the MacLaurin series of f(x) = sin x .
Solution. We have already established in the previous example that 
f (2n)(x) = (−1)n sin x
f (2n+1)(x) = (−1)n cos x.
Thus f (2n)(0) = 0 for all n, and the MacLaurin series reduces to

Abstract
In this video, we state and establish the Theorem of Taylor-Lagrange giving an explicit formula 
for the remainder in a Taylor series. We deduce Taylor’s inequality and apply it to prove equality 
of ex and sin x with their MacLaurin series.
Definition 14.9.1. The nth Taylor polynomial of f at a is 
Tn(x) :=

i=0
f (i)(a)

(x −a)i.
We denote by Rn(x) the error made in approximating f by Tn(x), that is, 
Rn(x) := f(x) −Tn(x).
Obviously limn→∞Tn(x) = f(x) if and only if limn→∞|Rn(x)| = 0.

Theorem 14.9.2 (Taylor-Lagrange) If f and its first n derivatives are continuous on [a, b] and f (n) is 
differentiable on (a, b), then there exists c in (a, b) such that 
f(b) = Tn(b) + f (n+1)(c)
(n + 1)! (b −a)n+1 ,
so that 
Rn(b) = f (n+1)(c)
(n + 1)! (b −a)n+1 .
Corollary 14.9.3 (Taylor’s Inequality)  If there is M such that for every x with |x −a| ≤d , 
|f (n+1)(x)| ≤M,
then 
|Rn(x)| ≤
M
(n + 1)! · |x −a|n+1
for all x with |x −a| ≤d .
Example 14.9.4. Let f(x) = ex and consider its MacLaurin series ∞

n! , as obtained in Example 
14.7.3. Since f is increasing and f    (n) = f for all n , 
|x| ≤d =⇒|f (n+1)(x)| = ex ≤ed,
so that, in view of Taylor’s Inequality, if |x| ≤d  then 
|Rn(x)| ≤ed|x|n+1
(n + 1)! .
Since limn→∞
ed|x|n+1
(n+1)! = 0, we conclude by the Squeeze Theorem that limn→∞|Rn(x)| = 0 if |x| ≤d , 
that is, limn→∞Tn(x) = ex. Since this is true for every d, we conclude that

In this video, we use power series representations for antiderivatives to estimate definite

Example 15.2.1. Estimate ´ 1

Solution. We cannot obtain an antiderivative of e−x2 in closed form, even though antiderivatives 
exist since the function is continuous. However, we can find a power series representation for 
the antiderivative in order to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Indeed, plugging in 
−x2 in (14.10.2), we obtain 
e−x2 =

Solution. This limit is an indeterminate form of the type 0

Abstract
In this video, we state a theorem on the power series representation of the product of two 
absolutely convergent power series and apply it to obtain the first few terms of the power series 
representation for more functions.
Theorem 15.4.1. If ∞
n=0 anxn and 
∞
n=0 bnxn both converge absolutely for |x| < R , then for every x 
in (−R, R), we have 
∞

n=0

n=0
bnxn =
∞

n=0
cnxn
where 
cn =
n

k=0
ak · bn−k = a0bn + a1bn−1 + . . . + an−1b1 + anb0,
and the series ∞
n=0 cnxn is absolutely convergent for |x| < R .
Example 15.4.2. Find the first 3 terms of a power series representation of 
ln(1 + x)
1 −x
=
1
1 −x · ln x.
Solution. Since 
1
1−x = ∞
n=0 xn  for |x| < 1 by (14.10.1) and ln(1 + x) = ∞
n=1
(−1)n−1
n
xn 
by (14.10.5) for |x| < 1, we conclude from Theorem 15.4.1 that ln(1+x)
1−x  has a power series 
representation for |x| < 1, which has the form 

1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + . . .

The discriminant of a quadratic equation  ax2 + bx + c = 0 is ∆:= b2 −4ac . If ∆> 0, then the 
equation has two real solutions −b±

Trying to apply the rule of thumb, you see that x is simplified by differentiation but would be made more 
complicated by integration, whereas sin x gives ± cos x depending on integration or differentiation, that 
is, it leads to the same complexity. Thus we prefer to take u = x and dv = sin x dx.
