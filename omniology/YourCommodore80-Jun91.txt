All that NinJa bashing has made
System 3 go a bit soft in the
head! Silly Putty is the latest
original game to come from
those masters of the C64. It's so
original that David Lynch could
have written it! You play a big
and bouncy, ball of putty and
have to stretch your gooey self
through a weird and wonderful
world keeping yourself soft and
pliable and caring for a bunch of
friendly robots who are building
a skyscraper to take you back
home to 'Putty Moon', before
the rest of your putty people are
shipped to earth as bubblegurn.
It's sure to stretch the
imagination and once you've
picked it up you're not gonna be
able to put it down!

EXCELLENT NEWS FOR

Capstone products, which
means that multi-million
blockbusters such as Home
Alone and Bill and Ted's
Excellent adventure will now
be able to appear on your

Bill and Ted were those

suddenly found history
interesting when they adopted
a telephone box to jet them
back and forth through time
thus passing their history
assignment and increasing
their vocabulary to 'hey
Nelson man' and 'how's it

computer game promises to
be a cool cookie.
Home Alone starred the
equably cute Macaulay Culkin

Accolade won't be paying the

p
io n e e r 10 was a deep
space probe (co-er)
launched in 1973. It
was sent a very long way
away. Past Jupiter. past
Pluto, past the Orkney
Islands, even. And now (now
being the operative word if
you happen to live in
3021, anyway) it's
back - like a
rather
unpleasant
spot or an
unwanted relative.
Not only that but it's been
particularly rude and has
come back with an alien
spaceship which didn't wipe
it's feet on the way down and
which crashed. Isk. What a
mess. As if to nail the
unfriendliness home (bit
Biblical that, eh?), the alien
Ship is about to explode.
Remarkably, the only
person who can save the
Earth from exploding into so
many parts it'll resemble a
series of Twin Peaks is you.
And you just happen to be a
rather ﬁerce humanoid. A
humanoid made from upper-
part human (and very
muscular at that) and lower
part robot, with lots of
gleaming metal, insect-
inspired legs and a massive
rocket pack on his back. With
a very suspect-looking gun,
too.
diminish rather pronto.
At the other end is this
little crystal that pops up and
has to be half encouraged
and half followed (you have
to be one the screen
for it to move) to a
sort of crystal
plug point, at
which point
it's billetty
baft and
onto the
next level.
Natch,
the aliens
aren't
happy about
So
oft you storm into three levels
set deep inside the alien
craft.
Numero uno is aliens and
acid bath Central. From your
regeneration platform you
have to trundle (you get your
legs back later, for this level
it's tank tracks, Oh?) and ﬂy
from one side of the teeming
level to t'other before taking a
well-controlled trip through a
window in an acid bath - it
moves along like a lift - in
which you have to avoid
munching into the sides, or
your energy level will begin to
this and they bump into you
like old people in the Post
Ofﬁce. Except in Extreme you
get points for shooting the
aliens. If you shot old people
in the post
ofﬁce you'd
probably be put away for
a rather long time - without
your C64, probably. You'd
also be hard-pushed to ﬁnd a
laser-death-emitting future-
weapon to use in the post
ofﬁce. Although I know some
nice men from Switzerland
who may have something, if
you have the cash - strictly
cash.
But I digress. Level two is
an underwatery-bit.
Surprisingly, you don't go
rusty. Maybe you're made out
of the same stuff as Non-
stick frying pans. You get to
'swim' about and ﬁnd the
next object to get you to the
following level. This one is a
bit of trouble. That's not to

say the ﬁrst wasn't
a bit of trouble,
but this
one's
quite
duff,
glrasuarpbroiseun.d. What
right?
Lots
more aliens
The legs return, like a
badly-prepared frog order at a
French restaurant, for the third
and ﬁnal level. What do you
mean: "Only three levels?" It's
hard enough to complete
them without more of 'ern.
For this excursion the
humanoid stomps over the
landscape smegging things
with plasma beams and arcs
of laser-light destruction. This
is really mean, and there are
more beasties to kill. But your
weapons should be able to
handle it. Let 'em have it!
Someone's beavered for a
while at Enigma Variations
here. Extreme (preview
version) is generally a really
good game. Sort of half-
puzzle-half-blast. And
sometimes ALL blast!
The graphics are round
and sweet at times, aswell as
appearing futuristic at others
although the sound doesn't
quite excel. No thumping
space tune, anyway.
Extreme looks to be Digital
Integration's strongest release
yet. If they stick to arcade
action as intriguing as this,
they may never need
to release another
ﬂight sim again!

during the 'Amazing Dissolving Women' mystery!

HOW EXTREME IS LINKED TO
THE FAMOUS FIVE (PERHAPS):
('Cos Enigma Variations programmed the C64 version of
both, doncherknow)
1. 'Extreme' sounds rather like 'Ice Cream', which the
Famous Five love.
2. A cid  baths, like the one in Extreme, are ﬁzzy - just like
ginger beer.
3. B o t h  games take place on Earth (Uncanny, huh?).
4. Th e  word 'Enigma' is rather like 'Enid', as in Enid Blyton
who wrote the Famous Five books.
5. Th e  power crystal in the ﬁrst level "follows you like a
dog". Like Timmy, the Famous Five's dog, perhaps?
6. B o t h  games are ripping good yarns.
7. I f  you buy both games. Enigma Variations will be
celebrating with 'tea and scones and lashings of ginger
beer.'
8. Hurrah!
0  Help! Somebody's trapped me in this rather fetching, but
exceedingly small, gloop, gloop machine.

Possibly the most ﬁendishly
addictive puzzle game of
1990, this one. Little blocks
come down ﬁve lanes and
must be caught on a platform
at the end which you control.
You then dump the blocks
into piles at the bottom and,
if you get them in a particular
pattern (row, block, etc.), you
get points and it's onto the
next level.
Sounds simple? Ha, ha!

in this rather poor conversion
of a classically funny and
playable arcade game,
anyway.
Ofﬁcer Bob is a man with
a quota. He has to catch a
certain amount of criminals
each day and get back to the
Police Station before the time
runs out. This he does by
speeding about town in his
rather swanky police car,
pulling over drug pushers and
litter louts.
The shame is that what
was very amusing in the
arcade is tired and
uninteresting on the 64 - little
music, bad control, very sad.

The C64 version of Cyberball
never found its way to full
release so this is its ﬁrst
public airingits basic premise
is American Football.., with
robots. The robots can be
guided by the player and set
in pre-set American Football-
style 'plays'.
Compared to other
versions, it's a bit slow but
apart from that, quite fun.
I like nothing more than to get
tanked up, er, up and at lem
in a tank. And these are some
pretty sweet and not to
mention rather nifty tanks
indeed. They've got dinky
little tank tracks (er,
astounding!) and little turrets
and a whole heap of
opponents ranged against
them.
Two players can go
tanking at the same time in
their arcade-style dinky-toy
seen-from-above-but-quite-
3D hardware and the point is
to ﬁnd a key and ﬁnish the
level, pulverising all the other
tanks and picking up gold
stars and making sure not to
carelessly explode.

ESCAPE FROM
THE PLANET
OF THE ROBOT
MONSTERS
The game that I thought was
about to be one of the
strongest turns out to be, um,
one of the weakest.
The scenario is a hilarious
B-movie spesh. A tale of
human prisoners forced to
slave for evil robot overlords.
You play 'a hero' and have to
run around 3D-displayed
rescuing chained and hapless
humans and running from
robot lackeys which plough
inexorably towards you - in
droves.
Later you journey through
maze-like bonus sections and
impossible monster-
confrontation.
Of this lot, my only real gripe
falls on Escape from the
Planet of the Robot Monsters
which is by no means very
poo-er but is certainly not as
corking as it should have
been.
On other versions (stop
moaning, other computers
exist - and the arcade
machine is meant to be what
the game is imitating) the
graphics are sweet and
cartoon-like. On the C64

they're just under-developed.
Obviously the C64 is no
rip-roaring arcade beast but...
Oh, I digress. At least the
gameplay is quite fast and
furious. Harumph.
So basically Domark have
•
come up
trumps.
They've
packaged ﬁve
of their classic
arcade
conversions
together and
made them
available to a
waiting crowd
(who are all
smarting 'cos
they bought
them at full
price last
year!).
I can't help believing that
Domark add that little bit of
class to the things they
convert. And here they prove
it again (and at quite
signiﬁcantly better
value than last year!).
C >  W I E 3 E
I'll bet all you people out there in Readerland
understand phrases like "Gridiron" and "Play" and
"Large Men in Much Padding Smashing Into Each
Other over a small Ball". Well I don't. Ha! But I do
like the sound of an inﬂatable American Football (a
sort of squeaky sound when you slide it up the wall
and an exploding sound when it hits a nail, that sort
of thing).
Either way, Domark are giving away FIVE of these
inﬂatable jobbies to link up with Cyberball being on
the Winning Team pack in' that and all you have to
do is answer the following easy question:
1. What is the name of London's most successful
American Footle team?
a) The London Queens
b) The London Monarchs
c) Charlton Athletic
Write your answer on the back of a postcard and
send it to the: "I've got inﬂatable balls Compo",
VC, 20 Potters Lane, Kiln Farm, Milton Keynes,
MK11 3HF by June 30th.

Domark have come up with, as they would
say, a "completely brilliant" compilation!
0  With this many tin cans around things are starting to Pool
like a Tesco's recycling plant. And who's the human ﬂeshy
one over in the corner, all tied up? I think it's disgusting,
and shouldn't be allowed!!!

Are you ready to take on Kiki and her
friends in this unique game of strategy and
skill?
OFFICIAL
, H O M E
VERSION,
Matc u p  t e 2 patterns o stones on
screen - special combinations give bonuses
and secret levels. Succeed within the time limit and gorgeous girls
will lead you to the next tantalising level.
If Kiki isn't temptation enough, then 400 levels of stunning
graphics, sound and speech, and gameplay so addictive that you -
will have to be dragged screaming from the screen, surely is.

WABBIT tYC
TAPE GAME]
Stefan (my main) Callear has
a few tips for Wabbit, our YC
tape game: Whilst playing the
game press the RUN/STOP
key to advance to any level.
Ian Gretton of Hucknall, Notts has a few tips for Cabal and
New Zealand Story.
CABAL
From Ian Gretton
"On Cabal when you get to the second level after you've
lost all of your lives don't rewind the tape just press play
and press and key to load the next level.
NEW ZEALAND STORY
It's Ian Grefton again,
"On New Zealand Story when you get to level 2-2 grab a
balloon and go up as far as possible then get off and go
left and get on another balloon and go to the left- hand
corner. Get off on the() little ledge and keep jumping up.
You should jump into the water above and then all you
have to do is swim right and down then you have to
rescue you little birdy friend."
THUNDER
BLADE
Mucho thanks to Alex Milann
(if I can decipher the writing)
for the Thunder Blade hints:
Level One
"On the overhead bit go as
high as you can go.You can
just go over the buildings on
the right. On the straight
ahead building stay just over
the bottom half of the screen
then you can hit the tanks and
planes. When there is a
building in front of you go
diagonally upwards. On the
ship bits go from left to right."
RICK
DANGEROUS I
Stephen Ley has help for
Commies owners with no reset
switch: "On high score table
type: FLUFOMATIC
BBOOIINNGG. Then press
down the left hand keys to
load any level, then press No.2
at any time during the game
for lives and ammo, use this as
many times as you like."

DIP DIVER
Programmer: Richard Taylor
Type: Complete game -
Arcade Action
Controls: Joystick
YC's very own
programmer-on-a-
string Richard
Taylor has come
up with an
excellent
undersea wobbler
of a game this
month. It goes
under the proud
name of Dip Diver
and is set deep
beneath the sea,
which is better
than a game set
on the sea
because you do
tend to bob up
and down in a
very sick-inducing manner
ON the sea, whereas you
don't when you're UNDER
the sea. So there you go.
Anyway, you play a diver
who has stumbled across a
whole load of sparkly
treasure and who would like
nothing more than to make
off with it pretty quick before
anyone else comes along, •
like the person who left it
there in the ﬁrst place. So
you have to negotiate the
tortuous rock passageways
and collect all the ﬂashing
treasurey objects.
Unfortunately, there are
lots of creatures trundling
around these caverns and
they're not too nice to touch.
They won't go for your throat
but you'll die if you touch
them. And you can't shoot in
this game, you have to use
your skill and wits to avoid
them.
You also have to avoid
the rock walls which are
rather sharp and will kill you
off and take heed of your air
bar which is constantly
heading downwards. If you
run out of air - you die.
Simple, huh? But you can
save yourself by topping your
cannisters up in the special
Air Rooms dotted about the
place.
The controls are the ever-
so-standard normal
directions (including
diagonals) and 'Runstop'
pauses the game.
So dive in and let rip!
N E S
DOUBLE DARE
Programmer: Bizarre
Development
Type:
Playable
demo -
Quiz/Action
Game
Controls:
Joystick in
port 1 (for
assault
course)
Come on,
you've all
watched
Double Dare
on TV, haven't
you. You might think it good
or bad but you all watch just
to see people get covered in
gunge. Go on, admit it!
But seriously, whether
you do or not you can now
play the C64 version of this
exciting quiz game. It's a
panel quiz - that doesn't
mean lots of corrugated iron
gets asked questions, that
means a group of people play
and answer i n  which you
can play against either a
friend or a computer. It's got
several puzzles of skill and
dexterity, which are called
*Challenges', and they help
you increase your score and
keep control of the board.
You will be asked questions
until you answer wrongly or
fail a challenge, then the
questions will be given to the
other team until they fail to
answer or fail a challenge.
If you win the quiz game,
you will take on the Double
Drae assault course but
watch out for the gunge tank
and hurry up! There's a strict
time limit.
HOW TO PLAY
The gamne begins with an
on-screen representation of
two opposing teams (red and
yellow) and the quizmaster.
You are then asked by the
quizmaster if you wise to load

the extra set of questions
supplied with the tape. After
this, you are asked to select
either joystick or keyboard
control and for player two
you will be given the option
to play against a friend or a
computer opponent. The
computer opponent has a fair
degree of intelligence in
certain ﬁelds of knowledge,
so it is important to try to
keep control of the board.
When play commences,
the red team always starts.
The quizmaster will ask a
question and you must
choose an answer from one
of the three given. If you are
unable to answer, you may
'Dare the other team to
answer. If the opposing team
are unable to answer, they
will 'Double Dare' the
question back to you. You
may then answer the
question or undertake a
'Challenge'.
The 'Challenges' take the
form of puzzles played
against the clock. They are:
1. Rearrange the squares to
form a picture of a well-
known person (Jason
Donovan, Madonna, David
Bowie).
2. Copy an ever-
increasing sequence of
ﬂashing lights.
FAMOUS FIVE
Programmer: Enigma
Variations
Type: Playable demo -
Adventure
Controls: Er... keyboard!
It's the HoIs and time for fun
and jolly japes with the
Famous Five. The Five
(Julian, Dick, Anne, cousin
George and Timmy the dog)
are knockabout mystery-
solving funsters and have
been invited to stay with Aunt
Fanny (George's Mum) on an
island and what a strange
vicl i r e  i t  ar l i f  c r

t i r r  i r  s t a t i c r .  I l i r r  I  r  v i t t 3 l e  t i e s
t r e  E i s t
and suspicious island it is
too.
Enigma Variations don't
give too much away but in
the whole adventure you
have to solve all manner of
puzzles and ﬁnd treasure
(probably).
In this special version,
which has a pile of locations
you can visit, just to get a
taster of the full game, you
play ALL of the Famous Five.
No, not all at the same time,
you swap between them
during the game. Apparently
one may see
things
different from
another so it
pays to swap
about. The
characters are
as follows:
Julian - Is
the oldest and
the most
intelligent. He
is also quite
strong.
Dick - Is
the greediest

and thinnest. He is also quite
strong, but perhaps not as
strong as Julian.
Anne - Is the youngest.
She is also the weakest and
most easily scared. Anne
tends to look up to Julian.
George - Is the bravest
and has a quick temper. She
likes to be treated as if she
were a boy and is the best
swimmer. George can be a
bit difﬁcult at times.
Timmy - Timmy is very
licky but unfortunately you
don't get to play him.
It plays like a normal
adventure, and if you don't
know about them by now, er,

Virgin have really
excelled themselves
here, they're offering
a life-size cardboard
cut-out Biffa Bacon,
straight from the
pages of Viz. It is
modelled here by
Andrew Wright from
Virgin who is a very
silly man indeed. If the
Biffa in the pic was
real, Andrew would
probably have no
teeth by now, for
being such a soft
Southern Jessie.

SHORT TAKES
A BROS FOR THE
90'S?
He's short, plump and bleeps
a lot, and I'm not talking
about Metal Mickey. He's
also an Italian plumber from
Brooklyn and, like all the
stars of our time - Madonna,
Gazza, Sting - goes by one
name alone. I refer, of course,
to Mario, Nintendo's
extraordinary console game
character who was revealed
in a recent US survey to be
the most popular animated
character of all time; bigger
even than Mickey Mouse!
Now, as if to justify the
very existence of a ﬁlm
column in a computer
magazine (now there's an
idea!) there's talk of a SUPER
MARIO BROTHERS movie
starring Danny TWINS DeVito
and Dustin RAIN MAN
Hoffman. Remember where
you heard it, er... last.
JACK'S BACK
AND THIS TIME
HE'S DRAC!
Here's an exclusive, though:
'Joker' Jack Nicholson -
missing from the recently-
conﬁrmed cast of BATMAN II
- is poised to play Count
Dracula in Francis Ford
Copious (sorry, Coppola)'s
new epic based on Bram
Stoker's classic vampire novel.
Nicholson, whose latest
movie THE TWO JAKES
(which he also directed), was
an undeserved ﬂop in the US,
beat British Oscar-winner
Jeremy Irons to the role, in
which he will be ably
supported by Winona
HEATHERS Ryder (who, you
may remember, was also cast
in Coppola's GODFATHER
PART III but had to retire due
to post-MERMAIDS
exhaustion), John Hurt and
Joss LETHAL WEAPON II
Ackland.
The romantic tale is still
without a title (the rights to
p A T R  1 CIC
JACif NICH0L5014
the title
DRACULA are held by
Universal Pictures) but this
punter's money is on COUNT
DRACULA. "Nicholson may
have been born to play the
Joker," says one insider, but
he's dying to play Dracula!"
For the record, BATMAN II
now stars Michael Keaton
(Batman), Danny DeVito
(Penguin), Annette GRIFTERS
Bening (Catwoman - perfect
casting) and LOOK WHO'S
TALKING TOO's Damon
Wayons (playing a young,
black, male Robin!). Tim
Burton will direct before he
helms BEETLEJUICE IN LOVE
but neither Nicholson nor Kim
Basinger will be back...
HOOD
ATTACKS
THIEVES!
20th Century
Fox, who got
the unpleasant
end of the stick
by signing
Patrick
SLEEPING
WITH THE
ENEMY
Bergin to their
ROBIN HOOD
movie while
Morgan
Creek landed
Kevin
DANCES
WITH WOLVES
Costner for
PRINCE OF
THIEVES, have
tried to get their
own back with a
sneaky piece of
marketing.
Not only have
Fox rush-released
ROBIN HOOD so
that it arrives a
couple of months
before Costner's
blockbuster, but
they've also left
Bergin
conspicuously off
their advertising
campaign, which
simply offers a view
of some arrows,
some trees and the line
"ROBIN HOOD: The Real
Adventure Begins". Don't be
fooled - wait for July's real
adventure with Costner,
Morgan Freeman, Mary
Elizabeth Mastantonio,
Christian Slater, Mike
McShane, Brian Blessed and
Sean Connery. Now that's a
cast!
Meanwhile, Patrick Bergin
is due to replace Kenneth
HENRY V Branagh in the
forthcoming movie of Leslie
Charteris' THE SAINT...
IF IT MOVES,
REMAKE IT!
Disturbing Belgian psycho-
thriller THE VANISHING has
joined the equally-disturbing
list of successful list of
foreign ﬁlms scheduled to be
remade in Hollywood this
year. Already slated to suffer
the same fate as TROIS
HOMMES AT UN COUFFIN
(remade as THREE MEN AND
A LITTLE LADY, starring Ted
Danson) and COUSIN,
COUSINE (remade as
COUSINS, also, strangely,
starring Ted Danson) are the
exquisite CINEMA PARADISO
and Pedro Almodovar's
outrageous TIE ME UP! TIE
ME DOWN!, the Hollywood
version of which is set to star

1:111E REVENGE
Kimmy Basinger and Ray
GOODFELLA's Liotta.
I'm still uncertain whether
Luc Besson's insistence that
NIKITA is on the remake
schedules is merely a ploy to
get Americans to take the
French version seriously...
STONED AGAIN
Oliver Stone, Sixties-
obsessed writer/director of
SALVADOR, BORN ON THE
FOURTH OF JULY and, most
recently (and least
effectively), THE DOORS, has
ﬁnally abandoned the EVITA
movie (set to star Madonna
and Jeremy Irons) in favour
of JFK, which reconstructs
the events following the 1963
assassination of President
John F. Kennedy in Dallas,
Texas.
Already signed to the
project are Kevin Costner
(who chose JP( over
CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS), John UNCLE
BUCK Candy and Gary
Oldman, Oldman will play
alleged assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald, adding to his
impressive back catalogue of
psychotic roles, which
include
playwright Joe Orton,
guitarist Sid Vicious, poet
Dylan Thomas and, soon,
child-murderer Ian Brady
(opposite Francis Barber or
Eastenders' Susan Tulley as
accomplice Myra Hindley).
Meanwhile, that other
well-known Stone, Fred
Flintstone, will ﬁnd live-
action ﬁlm fame in 1992
when THE FLINTSTONES,
starring John KING RALPH
Goodman and Danny DeVito,
directed by Bob BACK TO
THE FUTURE Zemeckis or
Ivan TWINS Reitman, hits the
big screen...

NUMBER OF
THE BEAST
Dear Pasty,
Yo dude! How's it hangin'?
But enough of this trendy
jive, what I'm writing for is to
ask you a teeny weeny
amount of questions:
1) Will some of the fab
games like Shadow of the
Beast be converted to
C64 tape from C64
console originals?
2) Will you be
making all of
your reviews
colour in the
future?
3) Is it possible to get an
add-on Disc Drive for the
C64, or do you need a
memory expansion?
Matthew Smith, Mansﬁeld
P.S. Print this or die!
PE: I noticed your mention of
The Beast', this computer game
must be one of the limbs of
Satan himself! As for your
questions, 1) If the Lord had
meant this game to be released
on tape he would have done it
N
by now, 2) God
gives us colour for many things
and we must make the best use
of it we can in VC, 3)
Commodore do a disk drive for
the 64 and you don't need a
scrap of extra memory, praise
the Lord.

I L E V U E  R S
ALL
CREATURES
GREAT AND
SMALL
Yo Ladz,
I just wanna say a fe w
words while I've got the
chance:
1) The  magazine is
really good and certainly
worth the  $7 I have to
pay for it.
2) Rik  Henderson mus t
be the  ugliest person
ever to have worked with
a C6 4 .
3) Post Apocalypse is
a miserable V s t* r d  and
should be  bludgeoned to
death with his own
ganglies (? P E ) .
4) My  compliments to
the artists. The ir work is
excellent. Shame a bout
the print quality.
Kristopher Roebuck,
Emusoft Designs,
Address not given
P.S. Ca n someone send
me an autographed
picture of Beverly
Gardner?
PE: God's creatures (like
Rik) come in many different
guises and we should
appreciate all that He
sends, even if some have
been sent to try our Faith
(just like Rik). I am still
trying to make Post
Apocalypse see the error of
his ways, not by
bludgeoning but by
preaching sections of the
Bible to him. Lastly, there is
no place for lust on God's
Earth, so no more thoughts
about Beverly or the Lord
will strike you down where
you stand.
DON'T
ALTAR
ANYTHING

I used to be an avid
reader of a  certain othe r
DIVINE GUIDANCE
I would like to thank Budgie, otherwise I would not
have bought Silkworm. Budgie reported in the
March issue that Silkworm was brill and gave it 5
stars.
I was going up to the counter with another game, saw
Silkworm and remembered what Budgie said, so I bought it and it
is extra brill.
P.S. You're cool and so is YC!
Michael John Cremin,
County Cork, Eire
PE: It is not only the Good Book, The Bible, that offers advice on the way
to live. The Budgie column and YC are but another of The Lord's
mouthpieces. Probably.
C64 magazine T h a t  was
until I saw VC. So fa r I
have two issues and I
have now placed an orde r
at the  newsagent for your
fab mag.
I particularly enjoy
your cover tapes,
especially Knightmare
(although I c a n't solve it)
and Frosty. And I really
enjoyed your Post
Apocalypse game (it was
this game tha t made two
of my C6 4 -owning friends
buy VC!).
Keep up the  good
work!
Lehane Richards,
Barooga, Australia
PE: Truly The Lord moves in
mysterious ways and this
must be one; showing you
the path towards VC.
Hallelujah! And thank you
for spreading the word, I
should make you an
honorary disciple for your
good works. My Church
(The "Post Enlightenment
Evangelical Way of the
Concrete Cow Church" in
Milton Keynes) needs more
like you.
PULPIT UP!
Vo, Posty Du d &
Not being rude  but where
did you ﬁnd those kinky
leathers? Any chance of
giving me some?
I got the  mag last
month and think  it's RAD.
The t a p e 's g re a t and th e
Swiv de mo was really
fab, it ma de  me forge t
about those othe r three
g a me s wh ich ,  e rm,
we re n't so fab. Anyhow,
it's worth the  4
spondulicks (That's wha t
it costs over here).
The reviews are good
but the re 's  not enough of
th e m, t h e  ch e a ts se ctio n
should b e  e n la rg e d  a n d
wh y a re n 't  th e re  mo re
co mp e t it io n s?  Wh o  wa n t s
p o ste rs (n o t me!).
Th o ma s Mc  De a mo tt,
Co u n ty Tip p e ra ry, Ire la n d
P.S. Rick's a spaddle (? -
PE), don't you agree?
P.P.S. Why  doe s n't
someone help Oozin'
Eugene, I fe e l so re -y f o r
h im!
PE: Kinky leathers? These
are the leathers of the Lord.
Too many preachers
restrict themselves to dark-
coloured suits or white
robes. VC truly is very
good, I agree, even if it
does need the teachings of
the Lord brought to it
sometimes. As far as the
reviews go, although Jesus
could feed 5000 with only a
few loaves and ﬁshes, YC
has to rely on the number
of games released every
month - more games =
more reviews. And posters?
I don't hold with them
either - my Church just has
bare concrete walls, if bare
walls were good enough for
Jesus, they're good enough
for me.

W e  don't think so.
ritish TV is truly the
best in the world. So
how did we end up
with Blockbusters, played by
smug students with their
cuddly toys, Bullseye, which
occupies that boring Sunday
afternoon slot when there's
nothing on the other
channels, Every Second
Counts, with the unspeakable
Paul Daniels (only marginally
less irritating than Emlyn
Hughes), The Krypton Factor,
with unnaturally clever
accountants and teachers
who have nothing better to
do with their lives than
memorise objects and solve
jigsaws and, ﬁnally, Bob's
Full House which is just, well,
unspeakable?
There is probably no
understandable answer to
that question but that's no
excuse for Domark to
compile a whole lotta C64
games based on the sad
shows mentioned above. But
they have!
r3gis
Call me juvenile if you will
but I the sides of my mouth
never fail to curl upwards
when Blockbusters
contestants say "I'd like a
'P' please, Bob". ANd you
DO get to ask for this in the
C64 adaptation.
For those who were too
busy skateboarding to
watch TV, Blockbusters is
based around a rather large
Lookee here viewers!

electric board with a grid of
letters and a man called
Bob. Bob (or "His Holness"
as some have called him)
asks contestants which
letter they'd like on the
board and asks them to
guess a word beginning with
that letter from a clue. For
example, What 'P is  pink
and lives in a farmyard, to
which the answer would be
'Pig'.
•••
If the
contestant
gets it
right, the
letter/square is
turned that
contestant's colour
(red or blue) until one
contestant has made a
line from top to bottom/left
to right of their colour.
Simple. eh?
After three bouts, the
winner gets a Gold Run
which has the same grid but
with three-letter clues, like
'HRH' or 'TNT', and has a
time limit to get across the
board.
Are you a fat, beer-sodden
drunkard who likes throwing
little spears at an
unsuspecting circular
wooden board? You are?
Well Bullseye is right up
your street because that's
almost exactly what you
have to do.
You throw darts to get
the opportunity to answer a
question and the highest
score gets the chance. If you
get the question wrong, it's
passed to the other
contestant.
Bully, the Jocky Wilson-
like bull mascot of the TV
programme pops upto tell
you whether the question is
right or wrong with a turn of
his thumb. What an idol he
is, truly.
Do you like quiz
show with
talentless giggling
couples? Say "Yes
Paul" and this
could
be
your
bag. Most of the answering
is done by selecting true or
false when you get asked a
question.
The questions are in
categories like drinks or TV
programmes which you have
the opportunity to select.
The ﬁnal round is a race-
against-time round where
you have three answer
options. Wow!
Thankfully, Paul Daniels
doesn't make an
appearance.

SUPPLIER: Domark/TV Games.
PRICE: E9.99 tape, E14.99 Disk.
RELEASE DATE: Out now.
This is a test of reﬂex and
skill. That and how long
anyone can stand Bob
Monkhouse. It is the
contestant who gets to the
buzzer ﬁrst that gets to
answer the questions and if
they get it wrong, they're
nwallied" for the next
question, which means they
can't answer.
11.1.1 80%
An interesting selection of trivia games, so
varied that it will take quite a time to tire of
them.
As the rounds progress,
more and more 'bingo--
board' lights must be lit to
get to the next stage until
the ﬁnal, where loads and
loads of questions have to
be answered within the
ever-present time limit.
If you'd been sitting around
thinking "I don't have any
games which will test my
knowledge and skill" then
this is the package for you.
If you're more keen on
blasting the smeg out of
huge swarms of alien
deathraiders then you really
won't like this at all.
Me? I laughed.
Especially at the furiously
nodding or shaking head of
Bob Holness in
Blockbusters, the laughable
idea behind Bullseye and
the sheer feebleness of The
Krypton Factor. Every
Second Counts is my
personal favourite i t ' s
actually quite good and
Bob's Full House?
Well, my hatred of
Bob Monkhouse
overcomes me!

pregnated wife in tow, and he
seemed most intolerant when
we (Jeff, Rik, and myself)
jumped upon him and asked
him to pose for a piccy (who
wouldn't?)!. And all this
excitement was just the
Sunday, for celeb factor we
also found Jeremy Beadle
hiding on the Virgin stand,
ready to jump out on
unsuspecting magazine
journos no doubt.
I didn't spend most of the
show just walking about
bumping into TeeVee twonks,
some of it was spent in the
bar (drinking pop, drinking
pop), and the rest was
conning some poor Public
Relations executive into
buying me a drink in the bar - I
occasionally stopped to have
a look at their latest games
too, actually. Below I've listed
all the stands that had some
interesting commie product
that we haven't already
previewed/reviewed (or
moreover, companies that
wanted to talk to YC)l.
VIRGIN
MASTERTROMC
The Virgin stand had a bunch
of reprobates playing silly
buggers with some cardboard
cutouts of Viz characters -
sometimes it was hard to
decide who was who.
PRODUCT LIST FOR '91
Sarakon - A Mah-Jongg
derivative that is sure to bore
the pants off any Simpsons
fan.

Spot - Not
just another puzzle game,
it's got a cutesy character at
the helm, aaaarrrrgggghhhh!!!
Rolling Ronny - The game of
the comic strip? You all know
who we mean!!!
KRISALIS
A small stand tucked away at
the back of the world. Doesn't
mean that I wasn't interested
in the few games that are
promised before the end of
the year, it just means that
they didn't spend much cash
on the stand, skinﬂints.
PRODUCT LIST FOR '91
Jahangir Khan World
Championship Squash -
Yep, that world famous
sportsman that everybody
knows (?) is the sponsor for
this ball-bashing sim.
Manchester United Europe
- A completely new game to
the superb Man Utd last year,
with loads more presentation
and a new European
tournament structure.
ELITE
A big video screen played the
arcade conversions that
Elite's just signed up and that
was the closest thing I got to
entertainment all day. And
they wouldn't even switch it
over to Neighbours at
lunchtime.
PRODUCT LIST FOR '91
World Championship
Soccer - It's still to come, and
it's still a soccer game!
European Championship
1992 -
Based on the
Tecmo arcade
machine that
wowed everybody at the ATEI
Caveman Ninja Ahem! A
cutesy beat-em-up thang.
PRODUCT LIST FOR '92
Suzuka GP/Winning Run II - A
driving game, and another
coin-op licence (what do'ya
want? Blood?)
Edward Randy - Oh come on!
DOMARK
A well swanky "horse
brutality" (Er, I think you mean
"Hospitality"! Ed) suite
stocked to the brim with soft
drinks and coffee cups. And a
few games, probably!
PRODUCT LIST FOR '91
Pitﬁghter - No-holds barred
beat-em-up with karate,
kickboxing or wrestling.
Race Drivin
the Christmas No 1 slot
Ramparts - Spiffy and
addictive medieval shoot-em-
up/Tetris brick building
strategy which is a YC's fave
arcade game.
Thu nderjaws - Half aquatic
and half land shoot-em-up
(nothing to do with thighs)
RBI2 Baseball - Realism is the
name of the game here and
even a free hat to be thrown in
(don't go mad, eh guys).
STORM
Everybody seemed to be
crowded
around Battletoads (THAT
game), and it was very hard to
try a do business with a
thousand staff writers all
clambering for position on the
madly addictive game.
PRODUCT LIST FOR 1
Rod-land - Another cute-em-
up with two small jap geeks
and magic \wands.
Double Dragon M o r e  like
triple dragon.
Asylum - Heavy Metal ain't got
nothing on this action
adventure.
Solar Jetman: Hunt for the
Golden Warpship - The
ofﬁcial sequel to ages old
games Jetpac and Lunar
Jelman.
Big Run - 'Nother coin-op
conversion, and another
driving game natch!
PRODUCT LIST FOR '92
Battletoads - Hurrah!
Indy Heat - Not about a certain
adventurer's underpants being
on ﬁre.
Brute Force - Not about
Gazza's favourite after shave.
MIRRORSOFT
Who can walk past the
Mirrorsoft stand and refrain
from asking for pizza
nowadays. I did and had to go
off to Burger King instead.
PRODUCT LIST FOR '91
Turtles 2 - Based on the
incredible arcade machine by
Konami (see my Data column
for more details).
Robozone - Scrolly shoot-em-
up with the latest fad, robots!
'Cisco Heat - A racing game,
ho hum! But an arcade
conversion, hurrah!
Devious Designs - Puzzle
game with a seriously
surrealist tint, as a loony
changes all the famous
landmarks into cubes.
I'm sorry if I missed
anybody out, but you
probably didn't have
any new C64 product
that we haven't
mentioned elsewhere.
Also, you should've
seen the state of Jeff
and Rik the day after
they went to the
Hippodrome - the
industry party to give
out some sort of awards

 his
round is
hosted by
a celebrity compere - Mike
Clark, PR Supremo from
Code Masters (Macsive applause
as Mike Clark, in a spangly suit,
bounds down a ﬂashing neon
staircilse, gets thrown a
microphone and is bathed in a
spotlight). Let the contest begin!
THE CONTESTANTS:
Jeff Davy (Ed):
Jeff is a recent convert to the C64
but has owned many other
computers and has been jotting
about games for years. "I expect
I'll get completely thrashed'', he
says. Never a truer word was
spoken...
Rik Henderson (Contributing Ed):
Rik is a guy you all know and, er,
love. He's hoping to win the
His'n'Heis exercise bicycles in this
contest and is convinced that
points make prizes. He's been
swotting for weeks by reading old
issues of YC and watching "Family
Fortunes".
Paul Rigby (Writer and
Professional Scouser):
Exciting Paul has just come back
from an extended stay with a
bunch of Orcs and Pixies and is
conﬁdent that he'll make a mark
on the quiz. "Oh-Ay, Eetm, I'll have
that prize. Alright-la?".
Beverly Gardner (News Ed):
Bevvy-Babes is immensely
knowledgable about computer
games, so it says on this piece of
paper with her writing on, anyway.
She'd like a Blankey-Blank cheque
book and pen. Er... Thanks Bev.
Paul Eves (Group Editor):
As well as being the very kind man
who does all the technical bits for
The Scores on the doors:
YC's cover tape and oversees YC,
Paul has done some very
interesting things: "Did I tell you I
taught Radio Communication to
Prince Charles?"
Post Apocalypse (Psycho Post
Ed):
Postie doesn't care much about
computer games. In fact, Poste
doesn't care much about
anything. Except killing.
"Questions?' he bellows, ''When

VIGILANTE
Oh no! The skinheads have

the Vigilante, must give them a
good spanking. If you're lucky
and you rescue Madonna you
might get to give her a
spanking too (00-er1), but
according to the instruction
manual it is 1994, so perhaps
it's not worth rescuing her -

she's looking a bit ropey now
and its only 1991!
The basic idea is to keep
moving to the right and stop
the baddies from draining your
much-needed energy.
DYNASTY
WARS
No this game isn't about a
tacky American soap which
was ended due to public
opinion, this game is much,
much better (although
anything would be, apart from
tacky Australian soaps).
Dynasty Wars is a combat
game which takes place on
horseback, with a quest to
topple the evil dictator Thung
Choc, who, it has to be said,
sounds rather like a ﬂavour of
ice cream. And, basically, you
go from level to level hitting
things.
GHOULS AND
GHOSTS
As everybody knows, this one
is the sequel to Ghosts and
Goblins which involved a man
in a suit of armour trying to
avoid ghosts, killing ghoulies
and nasties and climbing up
ladders. Ghouls and Ghosts
on the other hand is, er,

Resplendent in your tin can
suit you scamper from the left
to the right of the screen fro
ﬁve levels, up hill and over
dale (ho ho!), trying to avoid
the undead with the eventual
aim of rescuing one Princess
Hus. What I wonder is, does
she want to be rescued? And,
more the point, does she want
to be rescued by a short,
grubby knight who's all sweaty
and nasty after running
through ﬁve levels of undead?
HAMMERFIST
There doesn't seem to be
much future in being an
artiﬁcial, computer-controlled
hologram. I mean, someone
trips over the power-pack of
the computer and you're
history, eh?
Still, you play one in

does a load of gymnastic-type
things. You get to, rather
schizofrenically, swap
between the two whenever
you like as conditions dictate.
Basically, this one's a ﬂick-
screen kill-fest, full of aliens,
techniciand and things to
trash. Good, eh?
NINJA SPIRIT
Not, in fact, a lethal Japanese
drink but a game about a
Ninja. Actually, not a REAL
Ninja but the spirit of a white
wolf who has taken the form of
a Ninja. Um, right.
This is another excuse for
thwacking enemies with vivid
Ninja powers and getting the
chance to work your way up in
weapon-terms by collecting
dead Ninjas“spirit balls'.
To tell the truth, 'spirit
balls' describes this game very
well.
At least two of these games
are rather good - Hammerﬁst
and Ghouls and Ghosts - even
if the latter is a bit hard but
generally the standard is not
very high. They try hard to
capture the spirit of the arcade
games they're based
on but mostly fall
short of the mark.

W
fellows know about
football? I mean,
who won the world cup in '66,
eh? Not them pizza-scoffers,
that's for sure! Mind you, they
may not play the game the
same as us but the average
crowd at Inter Milan
outnumbers our top clubs'
attendances by two to one.
Oh well, we only invented the
sport.
"But what relevance is all
this?" you scream at this
confusing hack, "What on
earth are you talking about,
you buffoon!" There is
method to my madness,
since i Play 3D Soccer is an
import from the land that also
brought us Roman noses and
Cruciﬁxion (Italy, of course).
It's rather different to your
run-of-the-mill excursion into
the wild and extremely
wonderful world of football
arcade-action games of the
simulation kind (that was my
idea), in the respect that it's
all in gorgeous, splendid 3D-
0-vision (and who'd have
guessed it).
But lo, you need not don a
pair of milk bottle tops and
rose-tinted glasses to
experience this almost virtual
and take pot-shots at gun-
toting foes. This is where the
main failing of the game
comes to the fore.
IT'S TOO HARD!!!
One shot from an enemy
and you're a goner. The worst
reality, all you have to do is
plug your joystick into the
thingummy at the side and
away you go. It's also almost
unique 'cause you get to play
one player throughout the
whole match (ie. you can be a
striker, defender, or
midﬁelder), and there can be
moments in the game where
you'll be standing around
doing very little indeed.
The competition structure
revolves around the UEFA
cup (or any knock-out
tournament, really), and you
can even get a friend to
participate (by taking on
another player on the same
team).
During the game you can
show the opposition the
metal of your studs -
something I happen to do
quite often - and up-end
them, but you don't seem to
be sent off or anything like
that (a bit like Italian football
really). It doesn't have the
offside rule either, like every
other game on the market,
and if you do manage to draw
('cause even on easy peasy
mode it's hard to win) there's
extra time and then a penalty
shoot-out.
The whole thang is very
part is that as
soon as they
see you, they
ﬁre and, boy,
do those
bullets move
fast! Once
you snuff it,
you ﬂip right
back to the
start of the
level - So you
get back to
where you
died, ﬁnd
another
terrorist, and get shot again.
Do you see a pattern forming,
readers?
Much as I like the
graphics, the sound and the
smoothness of the
gameplay, an impossible
smooth, moves incredibly
quickly, and although the
graphics are particularly sad
you can rest assured that any
footy fan'll be playing this till
the cows come home, or at
and irritating game is no
good at all. And this is,
sadly, what Navy Seals has
turned out to be.
In Seal terms, it
just doesn't balance
the ball on its nose
well enough.

Just as Jeff Davy thought he'd relegated
all the "Orc and Pixie" stories to
Misadventures, there came Moonshadow -
with a truly unfeasible plot...
G
folks: "You are alone
and you have a
mission to complete.You
must ﬁnd and destroy the
terrible creature that has
been sent to plague the Earth
by the gods of darkness. But
time is running out and you
must accomplish your
mission before Septerios, the
black moon, darkens Fulax
the magic moon, which
protects the world with its
life-giving rays."

The upshot of all this airy-
fairy nonsense is that there's
a whole fantasy world out
there full of trees, platforms,
monsters and... objects.
And this is the important
bit, for Moonshadow is like
one of the arcade adventures
of the early '80's. You can
carry six objects at a time
and each object has an
important use.
If you've played some of
the Dizzy series, you'll get the
idea.
But, unlike Dizzy and its
ilk, there's killing in
Moonshadow. You get to
knife things aswell as solving
ﬁendish puzzles. And the
further you get into the game,
the better weapons you can
ﬁnd lying around. This means
you can kill all the ﬁendish
beasties that wander and ﬂy
about, trying to wipe out your
energy. When it all runs out,
it's game over, no more
adventuring, matey. Yup, only
one life.
You're running all the time
against a strict time limit. The
bad moon,
Septerios, slowly
obscures Fulax,
the good moon
and if the latter
becomes
completely
covered, it's the
end of the game.
There's no
question that
this game is
quite, quite,
hard.
Unfortunately the control
method doesn't help. It can
be difﬁcult to jump from
platform to platform which
can lead to your hero dying
very fast when caught in a
tight corner.
Further, the game concept
is rather dated, full price
arcade adventures went out
with the Oric Atmos.
That said, it was quite
interesting for at least 15
minutes. Until I turned it off
and found something better
to do. Like watching
grass grow.

NAME: Moonshadow.
SUPPLIER: Idea.
PRICE: E9.99 Tape, E14•99 Disk.
RELEASE DATE: Out now.
Awkward, out-dated and tired. About as
interesting as watching leaves drop off
trees.
Zator, which
Azazael - an evil
wizard who
could easily be
a washing
powder:
'Azazael
Automatic'? -
wants to get his
hands upon.
You have to
stop him by being
downright hard and
them ﬁrst.
The well-laid-out screen
has smooth 3D graphics on
it and up/down icons & a
compass guide you through
the game - which begins in
a castle.
I am tempted to say that
what it lacks is a map
because at the start, the
stark black and white
identical parallel corridors
of the castle can be very
confusing. But, the effect of
this is increased
compulsion and a greater
determination to sort
everything out.
Although you play a
barbarian (not noted for
their high Qs), this is a
game that teases your wits
with its complexity and is
packed full of loads of cool
places.
Some of the
manipulations (oo-er!) are a
bit difﬁcult at ﬁrst but the
whole game is logical and
the more you play it, the
more compulsive it
becomes.
This is one that will stand
the test of time.

realm of sprites but Spitting
Image, for all its 'Save the
World pretensions is a thinly
disguised, non-progressive,
martial arts game, the like of
which has been seen zillions
of times before,
First you choose an
opponent and champion
from the motley crew of
world leaders, including
Mags and Ronnie (It's a bit
dated, y'see). The you beat
each others' heads in, the
essence of this bit being
how fast you shift the
joystick tound).
The only variatiuon
comes from whether you 'do
it in the Vatican' (oo-ER!) or
on the England vs. South
Africa rugby ﬁeld.
The idea of beating the
crap out of P.W. Botha (Even
if he's since resigned as the
president of S. Africa) is a
deﬁnite plus and this is the
only strength of the game -
perceived revenge on people
with Power who cock up
badly. This is realised in the
two-player game where the
idea of saving the world is
abandoned in favour of pure,
mindless violence.
Even though righting the
Worlds wrongs with a bit of
violence could make a great
game, Spitting Image
doesn't work. The need for
loading and reloading side B
after every bout is an
irritating feature that lowers
the addictivity to about half
what it could be and its
longevity to about 5 seconds
- maybe 10 for Ron and his
B movie ape co-star!

to anyone unless they really
did like the arcade one and
feel you must have a version

If you want a shoot 'em

I thought the arcade version
was boring and it's not the
kind of game that converts
very well onto the C64.

If you were into Soccer
Manager when it came out
then maybe you'll enjoy this.
If you weren't then forget it.
Very repetitive gameplay and
a very old/tried and tested
idea don't really entertain any
more.
I have to admit that the
graphics on the whole are not
too bad, the icons are nice,
with overlaid sprites creating
ﬁne multicolour.
It all runs very smoothly
but with its ancient idea and
zero sound I just wouldn't
shell out even a few quid for
it.

There is something so
appealing about shoot 'em

Multi-directional, upgradable
weapons systems,
simultaneous two player

to shoot, it really satisﬁes the

The format is a full screen

you get to the two-player

your ship and helps to wipe
out oncoming aliens. A
longer burst of concentrated
zap-o-kill is achieved by
holding the ﬁre button down,
without auto-ﬁre!
This helps to remove the
particularly large and scary
end of level baddies.
The graphics are really

Step 1: Go to the Pub and
buy 14 pints of Stella Artois

home and load this game. 4:
Vomit all over you 64, TV,

that this game was a bad
move and go back to the

Yes, this game is boring.
It's been done too many
times under different names.
Admittedly Zeppelin have
tried to vary the theme by
adding a few games, e.g.
-Scram, Dart Bowls, Ten
Dart Century and Shanghai
Football. But then, when it
comes to it, darts is darts,

If you already own a darts
game then I couldn't really
recommend this. If you don't
and the idea of large men
with beer guts throwing
pointy sticks appeals then

ARKANOID II
- REVENGE
OF DOH
KIXX £2.99
When I ﬁrst played
Arkanoid, all those yearts
ago, I d id n 't think too
much of it. But after
playing this version a few
times, I found myself
really quite hooked,
Although it is really just a
gloriﬁed Ark 1, I thought
that any improvements
that had been made make
it well worth a look even
for old ex-Arkanoid fans.
The idea is simple,
bounce the ball of your
bat, or lia u s', to knock
away a variety of bricks.
Sounds easy but b ricks
just don't seem to be
bricks any more. Some
disappear when hit, some
regenerate, some start
moving and some just
refuse to die.
There are plenty of
bonus objects to pick up,
including lasers, mu lti-
balls (more than
average!), regenerating
balls, level warp, glue,
ghost bat, indestruct-a-
balls and others.
If you have a Neos or
1531 mo u se  then I
strongly recommend
using it. If not then I
strongly recommend
borrowing one off your
Amiga chums!
A fun, playable,
though at times very
frustrating, game.

"Can  you g e t  into t h e Lotus
position?" a s k e d  S i m o n  D a l e ' s
Yo g a  teacher. "Yes!" replied Si mo n ,
before donning  his leat h er gloves
and getting into t h e driving s e a t  of a
rath er nice red mo to r.
C
Lotus and prepare to
bum rubber through 32
action-packed tracks on three
exciting levels.
There are twenty cars in a
race and you must weave your
way through eleven of them in
order to get into the top eight to
qualify for the next race. In your
travels you encounter many
different experiences, such as
screaming around tight bends,
burning over steep hills, guiding
your Lotus through road works
which block one lane of the
track (Sounds much like the
M25 to me - Ed), refuelling at a
pit stop in a hectic race-
deciding situation, Speeding
from 0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds and
racing a friend in a brilliant split
screen game_
The levels are put into order
of difﬁculty, easy, medium,
difﬁcult and practice. On the
easy level there are seven races
to complete, on the medium
there are ten, on the difﬁcult
there are ﬁfteen and on the
practice you can drive your
Lotus on a specially designed
practice track to help you to get
into the swing of Lotus racing.
On harder levels you have
obstacles such as dead
creatures in the road and water
at the bottom of hills, these
levels are invariably the ones
which you must refuel on. The
hard level was also the one that
I found you could be overtaken
the most.
In putting a game of this
standard onto the 064 a few
minor graphical problems have
arisen, you can appear to go
through the the side of a
competitors car when you
overtake it very tightly and
when you go down a hill at a
great speed the foreground
scenery has to rise and this
tends to do so rather jerkily.
And Gremlin, you can't fool
me. You can't make people
believe that the opponents' cars
are different graphics when
they are really a different
coloured version of your own
Lotus!
One thing that did
disappoint me about LET.0 is
that it you happen to crash you
don't explode into a giant
ﬁreball, you just bounce off and
your speed decreases quite
considerably. No fun!
But think yourselves lucky
because the Spectrum and the
Amstrad can only cope with
sixteen cars on the one player
game and in the two player
game there are only ten cars,
although the faithful 64 can
cope with twenty cars
on both one and two
player games. Hurrah.

Vroorn. Vrooml Rev your
engine and.., stall the bike.
Unfortunately, little
accidents like this happen
too often in this potentially
good game.
It is quite well set out,
with a top view map
displayed under the main
play area, which also
doubles as an information
panel. The graphics are OK
and the main sprite, or
collection of
sprites, is really
quite good.
There are
plenty of tracks
to test your off-
road skills,
varying from
easy-peasy to
damn hard! The
problem is, the
hard ones come
too soon. It is really quite
annoying trying to
delicately bounce over a
character-sized hole and
move at 2mph over rocks.
You'll have to work out
how to get over the
different obstacles which
range from from rocks,
crevices and very steep
hills to cars and trucks.
This may be a little hard
for the average gamer,
maybe younger players
should check out Kick
Start and K82.
Really too frustrating to
play for very long!

sitting in an obscure
Milton Keynes suburban
hostelry. The formica drips
with dull 1970's lack of
atmosphere. The PVC-
upholstered sofas exude
dullness and the drink sits
in its cloudy glass, ﬁzzing a
triﬂe ﬂatly.
It occurs that its  time to
draw your attention to an
important social mesage -
"Don't drink and drive". I
certainly wouldn't drink and
drive. One of the major
factors (apart from it being
dangerous) is that I don't
have a car.
If I did (We can see your
predictable link to the game
thundering over the horizon,
right now - Clued-up
Readers) it would possibly
be a large sports car like
the one in Turbocharge,

which is rather angular and
Lamborghini-like and
mighty fast.
It also has a rather
convenient grenade
launcher on the front (how
many times have you
wanted one of them
attached to the front of the
bus you're in - stuck in dry,
hot, honking trafﬁc) and a
readily-available handgun
for the driver.
That and a moral
scenario. The Mr/Ms Bigs of
the drug world are running
convoys along the highways
of Basildon, er, the US (that
was it) and you're the bod
for the job in the swanky
motor.
The convoys are
speeding their way across
State boundaries which
normal Police cannot cross.
Says Mr Big: "This State
imormom
Police business is rather
funny, they can't follow us
over the borders. We can
just ship our drugs around
as much as we like and
make tons of lovely, lovely
cash!"

But into
the rear view
mirror of the

comes a
large red car.
The chase is

And what
a chase.
Turbocharge
trashes other
driving
games into the
ground. There
are no tight
bends to slide
off at and
crash because
by controlling
the car (so it
seems) you
control the
road. No,
settle down at
the back there,
it's true.
This means
that you need
spend less
frustrating
time crashing
and more time
shooting; cars,
lorries and all
manner of opponents.
The pace is fast and
frenetic. The enemy spares
little in its quest to blow you
off the road. Planes strafe
the road, Choppers (with
moving rotors!) drop things
on you and armoured cars
draw alongside to 'take you

out'. And that's not a night
at the cinema and a rather
nice Biryani, that's the
business end of a large
machine gun poked
perilously close to your
nose with your ofﬁng
coming very close, very
fast.
And don't forget the
mines (the Seven Dwarves
certainly didn't) and more,
over many
separate and
changing levels,
chock-full of
roadside graphics
and mean hills.
As the roads
fork, the car
swishes into
tunnels (turning
darker
appropriately and
fast at that) and
you die, turning
over in a cloud of
dust and
explosion, you
begin to
appreciate what
appears to be a
great technical
achievement on
the 64. It's fast,
fantastic and
packed with
little technical
achievements
that you don't
immediately
spot but which
really add to
the game.
It's
unquestionably
what
Roadblasters,

been on the 64.

at the ﬁnal

as possible.

aptly sums up his

He's programmed

cry, "We've
already read a
review of a System 3
compilation!" And you have.
But lo, here's another juicy
morsel to treat your commie
with, cause it's got four of the
best recent System 3 games
on an all for the price of 50
bags of crisps (my average
dinner).
MYTH
This is the only game that's
on this pack and The Premier
Collection, but is well worth
it.
When it came out it
redeﬁned the meaning of
arcade adventure with it's
marriage of incredible
platform style gameplay and
ﬁendish puzzles and traps, as
you (as a Michael J. Fox look-
a-like in your Calvin Klein
jockeys and Levis 501s) get
to traverse several different
timezones and confront
several different mythological
gods in order to give 'em the
severest twatting of their
immortality.
There was a gripe that
went around a short while
ago that Myth was a little too
hard but with the superb
quality of the graphics and
the addictive gameplay you'll
WANT to persevere.
VENDETTA
The Last Ninja games were
popular enough to be verily
ripped off and their style
happened to pop up all over
the gaff. Vendetta has many
similarities but this is the
ofﬁcial style copier of the
century, and anyway it's got

tonnes more besides.
For a start, apart from
having superb arcade
adventure gameplay with
excellent puzzles to solve,
there's possibly the
smoothest driving game
hidden under the meat that is
Vendetta. At the end of each
3D section youy have to drive
to the next, and it has been
said that Chase HQ has 
-
nothing on it (by me actually).
If you're after the most
complete of games you could
do worse than Vendetta, and
it doesrft even show its age.
111+
This is unashamedly a typical
karate beat-em-up, but with
so many extra funky bits that
certain other jealous
companies tried to copy it
exactly (and failed miserably,
I hasten to add).
For a start, instead of the
usual two karate geezers
facing each other in a bloody
battle of ﬁst vs. ﬁst, it's time
to wear clean underwear
'cause there's three of the
buggers on screen at one
time and you only control one
of them,

to beat the proverbial poo-

there is the occasional
bonus level (after every
two normal levels)

but the
action is furious, and he
who does not like these sort of
games deserves a dam good
kicking in the lower abdomen.
TUSKER
Here's the dog, a particularly
nice dog, but a dog none-the-
less. It's an arcade adventure,
but without the usual System 3
stamp of originality. You're an
Indy Jones type adventurer (with
a hat, musn't forget the hat) and
you must sort-of-like...
adventure, in order to ﬁnd the
fabled elephant's graveyard
(although it doesn't say why -
perhaps you need a new set of
teeth, and ivory would be ideal).
And when you've
discovered actually what
illf 'art
you're meant
to do it's time to trot off
kill a few arabs (hmmm!), and
erm... that's all I seemed to
do actually because I'm really
crap at these sort of things,
but ho well that's life!
Tusker looks reasonable,
sounds reasonable, and (I've
been told) plays very well, if
you really want a serious bit
of Time Machine style arcade
adventuring you've got it
made 'ere mate!
Well, like the man who
couldn't pronounce the word
'four' would say, "The System
3 pack is a rather splendid
pack of Mt_ fff0000„.

REVIEW
DEATH KNIGHTS OF
KRYNN
SUPPLIER: SSI/US GOLD
PRICE:?
FORMAT: DISK
Death Knights of Krynn is the
sequel to the successful
Champions of Krynn, the
AD&D RPG from SSI,
distributed over here by
cuddly US Gold.
A year has passed - no,
really, trust me. A year since
Takhisis' (waddya mean
''Who?', play the original
game buddy!) followers were
pretty badly beaten by you
and the other good guys.
However, now its time to
partyyyyyl Over at Gargath,
the outpost commander has
laid on a spread (lots of
sandwich triangles, lashings
of ginger beer, you know the
sort of thing). It's the
anniversary of the victory
y'see. So, always a sucker
for a knees-up, off you trot.
As the party grooves and
someone gets beaten up for
playing a Dross album, Lady
Maya, who's Obviously had a
few, get's a bit melancholy.
Our good Lady is a silver
dragon in human form by the
way - and you know how
they can't take their drink.
Anyway she rambles on
about Sir Karl who died
during the war.
Just as the yawns begin
to appear from the listening
crowds there is a cry!! But
the beer is caught before it
hits the ﬂoor. Then there is
another cry! While everyone
scans the ﬂoor looking for
the broken beer barrel and
wondering if they can
salvage a small glassful out
from the sky comes - Sir
Karl! Well, it used to be him -
he's literally just skin and
bone now. Seems like he's
defected to the evil side.
Down he comes with a death
dragon and a bunch of
nightmares.
Karl shouts a few
obscenities and leaves the
nightmares to gate-crash the
party. However Lady Maya
ﬂies (yep she's been hitting
the punch again) off after
him. Meanwhile you've got a
bunch of ravaging hosses to
contend with.
Arriving on three disks,
plus a 12-page rule book and
a 60-page adventurer's
journal and a C64-speciﬁc
reference leaﬂet, Death
Knights of Krynn continues
the improved Krynn system
(improved over the Forgotten
Realms effort, that is).
I do like the Krynn magic
system which is controlled
by three moons - each moon
bringing its own magical
beneﬁts according to how
each moon waxes and
wanes. Mages can't really
dominate the game because
they must study and
memorise their spells which
is a good thing as it retains
play balance.
Death Knights sees the

to seventh level spells while
mages can reach eighth
level. Druids also make an
appearance (via high level
Rangers). Combat is more
balanced in the Krynn
system. The enemies are
easier to kill and the enemy
parties are scaled down.
In addition Dragonfear,
the morale sapper that
featured heavily in the TSR
books, makes an
appearance. Drangonfear is
only troublesome from

mature dragons but is only
really worrying to low level
characters.
There are many new
creatures including a variety
of new dragons (eg: spectral
and undead dragons).
Another new addition is the
Paladin who can cast clerical
spells upon reaching level 9.
Also, Paladins are immune to
disease.
Death Knights of Krynn is
recommended for the role-
player who enjoys a RPG
with handfuls of tactical
combat. It is not really aimed
at the puzzle-orientated
RECORDED DELIVERY
There's just enough room in this month's column to include a letter. Hang on I'll just get
into the "creeping position". Right there we are. Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou for writing
in with your comments and help. But please, please, please keep them coming. There's
nothing I like better than to read the ﬂowing prose of my faithful followers. Makes ya
proud, it does. Right, bit of 'ush - J.Sykes wants a word;
Dear Paul,

Could you please answer these questions before I throw the game out the window

tape 9)!
Mr J.Sykes, Leytonstone, London.
P.S. Why are adventure games so damn hard? Are there any easier ones out there
(except Danger Mouse)?
Well, Mr Sykes - or can I call you J? In answer to your second question, sure there are
easier adventures. You have just been a little unlucky. Watch out for next month's
column. I'll be looking at a couple of adventures that are right up your street.
Now onto your Circus queries:
1: It's your only means of escape.
2: To siphon some petrol.
3: To open the wagon and the locker inside the wagon.
4: In the generator.
5: Use the metal bar.

the later Ultimas are. That is
not to say that Death Knights
contains no puzzles or

the combat. As such Death

around.

Botch, no that isn't a
typing error. Gremlins 2
is not a funpacked action-ﬁlled
game, in fact it's a load of
complete rubbish. But I digress,
on with the plot...
Old Mr Wing, the Chinese
store-keeper, who took Gizmo
(the original Gremlin) back from
Billy (the ﬁrst ﬁlm's 'hero') after
the mean gremlin Spike had
been had been sunlighted to
death, has sadly kicked the
bucket. Now you lead that
illustrious hero Billy to certain
death by trying to get Gizmo
back from Clamp Pizzas
genetic research lab.
The general idea of the
game is to run along to the end
of the game through the
Gremlin-ridden pizza factory,
the Gremlins pop onto the
screen with pre-programmed
movement patterns which you
must remember; in order not to
shoot up in the air and
disintegrate, to help you in
wiping Out the gremlin ﬁends.
You have been provided with a
torch which is supposed to ﬁre
a beam (although it looks more
like an egg to me).
Many weapons can be
found and used against the
green ghastlies, such as
torches, tomatoes, telephones,
frisbies and boomerangs. The
frisbies look like giant polos and

gremlin with a telephone, a

boomerang or tomato. The only
weapon that looks like what it is
supposed to be is the tomato,
apart from the fact it is white.
Bonus icons can be picked
up if required, these have the
following uses extra lives,
points, extra time, Rambo
Gizmo and mystery, each of
these are represented as a
white circle with the ﬁrst letter
of the use in it.
Many different Gremlins will
hassle you along the way and
invariably end up wiping you off
the face of the game. These
gremlins are as follows, Daffy,
who curls up in a ball and rolls
at you, Mohawk, who pops up
all over the place and is
generally mean, Electric, his
name speaks for itself, George,
who gets careless with cigar
ash, Lenny,
throws things
at you,
Sexygiri, blows
killer kisses at
you, Pogo
hops about
on his pogo
stick and will
not hesitate
to hop on
you and
ﬁnally skate
board who is
very fast
and best
avoided.
All of these gremlins are
badly drawn with very cramped
sprites which makes Gremlins 2
an unremarkable game with
bad graphics, tediously hard
game play, annoying sound and
boring platforms.
As with most games-of-
ﬁlms Gremlins 2 is not playable
at all, it is much too hard, you
have no energy to enable
survival from more
than one hit from the
evil Gremlins.

easily entered block perms ranging from 9 to 73960 lines and
from 12 to 56 selections. All are accepted by the pools ﬁrms
and are checked in seconds by your computer.
RACING BOXFORM Course characteristics (built in to the program)
as well as the form of the horses are considered to speedily produce an
order of merit for each race. Designed for ﬂexibility allowing users to
amend the program if they wish. Price still includes the highly
acclaimed NANDI CAP WINNER • more than 1000 winners every year -
over 259/0 of them at 5/1 or better. Order two or more and recieve FREE
