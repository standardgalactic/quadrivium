Introduction 
After reading this introduction, you will know 
how to: 
A Use ILT Series manuals in general. 
B Use prerequisites, a target student 
description, course objectives, and a skills 
inventory to properly set your expectations 
for the course. 
C Re-key this course after class.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: About the manual 
ILT Series philosophy 
Our manuals facilitate your learning by providing structured interaction with the 
software itself. While we provide text to explain difficult concepts, the hands-on 
activities are the focus of our courses. By paying close attention as your instructor leads 
you through these activities, you will learn the skills and concepts effectively. 
We believe strongly in the instructor-led class. During class, focus on your instructor. 
Our manuals are designed and written to facilitate your interaction with your instructor, 
and not to call attention to manuals themselves. 
We believe in the basic approach of setting expectations, delivering instruction, and 
providing summary and review afterwards. For this reason, lessons begin with 
objectives and end with summaries. We also provide overall course objectives and a 
course summary to provide both an introduction to and closure on the entire course. 
Manual components 
The manuals contain these major components: 
 Table of contents 
 Introduction 
 Units 
 Appendix 
 Course summary 
 Glossary 
 Index 
Each element is described below. 
Table of contents 
The table of contents acts as a learning roadmap. 
Introduction 
The introduction contains information about our training philosophy and our manual 
components, features, and conventions. It contains target student, prerequisite, 
objective, and setup information for the specific course. 
Units 
Units are the largest structural component of the course content. A unit begins with a 
title page that lists objectives for each major subdivision, or topic, within the unit. 
Within each topic, conceptual and explanatory information alternates with hands-on 
activities. Units conclude with a summary comprising one paragraph for each topic, and 
an independent practice activity that gives you an opportunity to practice the skills 
you’ve learned. 
The conceptual information takes the form of text paragraphs, exhibits, lists, and tables. 
The activities are structured in two columns, one telling you what to do, the other 
providing explanations, descriptions, and graphics. 

 
Introduction 
v 
 
Appendices 
An appendix is similar to a unit in that it contains objectives and conceptual 
explanations. However, an appendix does not include hands-on activities, a summary, or 
an independent practice activity. 
Course summary 
This section provides a text summary of the entire course. It is useful for providing 
closure at the end of the course. The course summary also indicates the next course in 
this series, if there is one, and lists additional resources you might find useful as you 
continue to learn about the software. 
Glossary 
The glossary provides definitions for all of the key terms used in this course. 
Index 
The index at the end of this manual makes it easy for you to find information about a 
particular software component, feature, or concept. 
Manual conventions 
We’ve tried to keep the number of elements and the types of formatting to a minimum 
in the manuals. This aids in clarity and makes the manuals more classically elegant 
looking. But there are some conventions and icons you should know about. 
 
 
Item 
Description 
 
Italic text 
In conceptual text, indicates a new term or feature. 
 
Bold text 
In unit summaries, indicates a key term or concept. In 
an independent practice activity, indicates an explicit 
item that you select, choose, or type. 
 
Code font 
Indicates code or syntax. 
 
Longer strings of ►  
  code will look ►  
  like this. 
In the hands-on activities, any code that’s too long to fit 
on a single line is divided into segments by one or more 
continuation characters (►). This code should be 
entered as a continuous string of text. 
 
Select bold item 
In the left column of hands-on activities, bold sans-serif 
text indicates an explicit item that you select, choose, 
or type. 
 
Keycaps like e 
Indicate a key on the keyboard you must press. 
 

vi 
Project 2010: Basic  
 
Hands-on activities 
The hands-on activities are the most important parts of our manuals. They are divided 
into two primary columns. The “Here’s how” column gives short instructions to you 
about what to do. The “Here’s why” column provides explanations, graphics, and 
clarifications. Here’s a sample: 
Do it! 
A-1: Creating a commission formula 
 
Here’s how 
Here’s why 
 
 1 Open Sales 
This is an oversimplified sales compensation 
worksheet. It shows sales totals, commissions, 
and incentives for five sales reps. 
 
 2 Observe the contents of cell F4 
 
The commission rate formulas use the name 
“C_Rate” instead of a value for the commission 
rate. 
 
For these activities, we have provided a collection of data files designed to help you 
learn each skill in a real-world business context. As you work through the activities, you 
will modify and update these files. Of course, you might make a mistake and therefore 
want to re-key the activity starting from scratch. To make it easy to start over, you will 
rename each data file at the end of the first activity in which the file is modified. Our 
convention for renaming files is to add the word “My” to the beginning of the file name. 
In the above activity, for example, a file called “Sales” is being used for the first time. 
At the end of this activity, you would save the file as “My sales,” thus leaving the 
“Sales” file unchanged. If you make a mistake, you can start over using the original 
“Sales” file. 
In some activities, however, it might not be practical to rename the data file. If you want 
to retry one of these activities, ask your instructor for a fresh copy of the original data 
file.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Course objectives 
These overall course objectives will give you an idea about what to expect from the 
course. It is also possible that they will help you see that this course is not the right one 
for you. If you think you either lack the prerequisite knowledge or already know most of 
the subject matter to be covered, you should let your instructor know that you think you 
are misplaced in the class. 
After completing this course, you will know how to: 
 Discuss basic project management concepts and principles; identify project view 
options, interface components, and Gantt chart elements; create and save a 
project file; and get help on using Microsoft Project. 
 Create a task list, using both manual and automatic scheduling modes; set 
durations; modify a task list; establish a Work Breakdown Structure; hide 
columns; set milestones; and format the Sheet pane and the Gantt chart. 
 Link tasks to establish a project schedule; modify task predecessors; set lag time 
and lead time; add recurring tasks; work in Network Diagram view; modify task 
relationships; apply different task types; and set task constraints. 
 Create a base calendar and edit the working time; create a resource pool and a 
resource calendar; assign resources to tasks; create and apply a task calendar; 
enter resource costs; and use the Cost table. 
 Work in Calendar view and Resource Form view; add tasks to the Timeline, 
format the Timeline, and copy the Timeline to other Office applications; work 
with tables and create tables; and display WBS outline numbers. 
 Apply filters, highlighting, AutoFilters, and custom filters; group tasks and 
resources; create custom groups; sort tasks and resources; and renumber a sorted 
task list or resource list. 
 Display the critical path and slack; edit effort-driven schedules to fine-tune a 
project; and resolve resource conflicts by applying both automatic and manual 
resource leveling.

Skills inventory 
Use the following form to gauge your skill level entering the class. For each skill listed, 
rate your familiarity from 1 to 5, with five being the most familiar. This is not a test. 
Rather, it is intended to provide you with an idea of where you’re starting from at the 
beginning of class. If you’re wholly unfamiliar with all the skills, you might not be 
ready for the class. If you think you already understand all of the skills, you might need 
to move on to the next course in the series. In either case, you should let your instructor 
know as soon as possible.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: Project management concepts 
Explanation 
As a project manager, you have to manage and control your project to make it a success. 
You’ll need to understand project management concepts and apply them. You can use 
Microsoft Project 2010 to help you to organize, track, and manage your project 
effectively. 
Keys to successful project management 
A project is a series of steps that are performed to reach a specific goal. Projects have a 
definite start and end, and they result in a product or service. Projects are often the 
critical components of the performing organization’s business strategy. A project has 
three general constraints: 
 Scope — Customer requirements, quality specifications, and deliverables 
 Cost — Budget and resources 
 Time — Timelines for tasks and specific start and end dates 
 
 
Exhibit 1-1: The constraints of a project 
A project is considered successful when it’s delivered on time, stays within budget, and 
meets customer requirements. To manage your project effectively, it can be helpful to 
break it into phases so that it’s easier to control. The five phases of a project are: 
 The initial phase 
 The planning phase 
 The implementation phase 
 The monitoring phase 
 The close-out phase 
Collectively, these phases make up the project life cycle. Each phase is marked by the 
completion of one or more deliverables, called milestones. 
Project management  
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to 
accomplish activities or tasks to meet the objectives set for a project. To manage a 
project, you need to understand the phases involved in project management; these 
phases are the defining of priorities, limitations, and constraints for the project. They 
describe and organize the work of the project. Exhibit 1-2 illustrates the links between 
the phases in a project’s life cycle.

Exhibit 1-2: The links between project phases   
The project management phases are described in the following table. 
 
 
Phase 
Description 
 
Initial 
Establish the beginning of the project and define the project’s 
objectives and scope. 
 
Planning 
Devise and maintain a workable scheme to meet the objectives and 
business needs of the project. Also, identify the tasks and their resource 
requirements. 
 
Implementation 
Execute tasks and coordinate people and other resources to carry out 
the plan. 
 
Monitoring 
Track and report on the project’s progress. Monitoring involves 
reviewing the progress of the project, compared to the plan, and leads 
to control measures being taken. Control means taking corrective 
measures to ensure the success of the project. 
 
Close-out 
Formalize the acceptance of the project, ensure an orderly end, and 
evaluate personnel and the project itself for lessons learned. 
 
Constraints 
As you track and control the project to ensure that it progresses smoothly, you need to 
consider the constraints that the project might face. Constraints are the limitations 
imposed on a project. You can manage constraints by minimizing risks, costs, and 
resources. However, time is the main constraint that affects the performance of a 
project. You can manage your project effectively if you allocate proper time frames for 
each project phase. 

1–4 
Project 2010: Basic  
 
Project roles 
Projects often require a team of people with different roles and responsibilities to 
communicate with each other and work together. The cohesiveness of this group can 
affect the project’s successful completion. 
The project manager has the primary role of directing the project’s flow and the 
communication between project participants. The project manager leads the planning of 
the project, watches for cost overruns, and manages disputes. He or she is responsible 
for risk management, preparing for uncertainties that can and often will occur during a 
project. This person must also manage scope changes to prevent scope creep, the 
gradual addition of work which eventually makes the original cost and schedule 
estimates unachievable. The project manager’s process for dealing with scope changes 
will include revising the budget and schedule to accommodate project changes. 
Stakeholders are the people and organizations that have a vested interest in the project. 
These people include the project manager, decision makers, customers, vendors, and 
employees who will contribute to the project. These roles can be filled by one or more 
people, and an individual can play one or more roles.

Introduction to Microsoft Project 2010 
Explanation 
Managing a project can become difficult if it’s not planned well. A project can fail if the 
time required to complete it exceeds the planned duration, if the total cost exceeds the 
planned budget, or if the end deliverable or product does not meet planned expectations. 
By using Microsoft Project, you can more effectively organize, schedule, and manage 
your project. 
Project management tasks 
There are several things you’ll need to do to manage your project effectively and meet 
your project’s objectives. Exhibit 1-3 shows a sample breakdown of typical project 
management tasks.  
 
 
Project management tasks

Exhibit 1-3: Typical project management tasks  
Resources 
Resources are the people, materials, and equipment that enable you to complete project 
tasks. Microsoft Project helps you keep track of the resources assigned to accomplish 
each task. 
Overview of Project 2010 views 
You can use a variety of views to focus on specific aspects of your project. These 
include Gantt Chart view, Network Diagram view, Calendar view, Resource Sheet 
view, and Resource Usage view. In all views, the Timeline is displayed by default. It 
appears just below the Ribbon. If you prefer not to use the Timeline, click the View tab 
and clear the Timeline box. 

1–6 
Project 2010: Basic  
 
Gantt Chart view 
 
Gantt Chart view is Project’s default view. It’s separated into two panes—with the Sheet 
pane on the left, and the Chart pane on the right—as shown in Exhibit 1-4. The Timeline 
is displayed across the top of the two panes.  
You use Gantt Chart view to enter and view task-related information. The Sheet pane 
shows your task list. The Chart pane displays tasks and task relationships graphically.  
 
 
Exhibit 1-4: Gantt Chart view, with the Timeline active 
You will likely spend much of your time working in Gantt Chart view, and one of the 
first things you’ll need to do is establish your task list, also known as the Work 
Breakdown Structure (WBS). The WBS is a hierarchical arrangement of tasks, as shown 
in Exhibit 1-5.  
 
 
Exhibit 1-5: A task list in Gantt Chart view  
Network Diagram view 
Network Diagram view displays project details as a flowchart that shows how tasks are 
arranged. This view can help you visualize and analyze task relationships.

repeating the last action. You can personalize the Quick Access toolbar by adding 
buttons for commands you use frequently. You can also move the Quick Access 
toolbar below the Ribbon.  
 
Ribbon 
The main location for menus and commands. The Ribbon has several tabs that 
contain groups of related commands.  
 
Timeline 
Provides a “big picture” view of your project. You can copy your project Timeline 
and share it with other Office applications. By default, Gantt Chart view is active 
with the Timeline at the top. You can switch to Timeline view to maximize the 
display of the Timeline.  
 
Status bar 
Displays the current status of the project file, and information about a selected 
command or an operation in progress.  
 

1–10 
Project 2010: Basic  
 
The Ribbon interface 
The Ribbon interface was introduced in Office 2007 applications and is new to Project 
2010. The Ribbon is the main location for menus and tools. When you click a Ribbon 
tab (such as Task, Resource, or Project), it displays various groups of related tools. 
Some tools are buttons you click to take an immediate action, and other tools display 
menus, lists, or galleries with more options. (A gallery is a collection of style options 
that are represented graphically to provide a preview.) 
Some of the commands and options that are available on the Ribbon are contextual, 
meaning that they change based on the current view. For example, when you’re working 
in Gantt Chart view, the Ribbon displays the Gantt Chart Tools | Format tab. If you 
switch to Resource Sheet view, the Ribbon will display the Resource Sheet Tools | 
Format tab. The commands and options on the Format tab change the most from view to 
view, while the other tabs show dimmed (unavailable) commands if they cannot be used 
in the current view.  
Backstage view  
When you click the File tab, “Backstage view” is displayed. This feature is new to all 
Microsoft Office 2010 applications. Backstage view provides a central location for 
commands used to take action on a project as a whole, such as creating a file, saving a 
file, and preparing to print. Exhibit 1-8 shows Backstage view with the New command 
selected. From here, you can create a new blank project, start a new project file based 
on another file, or use free templates available at Office.com.

Gantt Chart elements 
Explanation 
Gantt Chart view is divided into two panes, as shown in Exhibit 1-9. The Sheet pane, on 
the left, resembles a spreadsheet, with rows, columns, and cells. You insert task names 
in the cells under the column headings. Each column displays information that is stored 
in the Project file. The row numbers are the IDs for the tasks. 
The Chart pane, on the right, displays the information in the Sheet pane graphically. A 
bar represents a task, and the length of a bar shows the duration of that task. You can 
easily compare the start and finish dates of tasks by comparing the length of their task 
bars. Gantt Chart view also displays a default timescale, which shows the month and 
days on a weekly basis. 
You can use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars in each pane to display the columns 
that are outside the current viewing area.

2–2 
Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: Creating a task list  
Explanation 
Every activity in a project is a task. There are many ways to get started with a task list, 
depending on the nature of the project and your own project management style. You can 
begin your project planning by listing the major phases as summary tasks and then 
identifying the subtasks for each of those phases. As you identify the tasks for your 
project, you can estimate the time needed to accomplish each task. 
The task list  
The task list is a complete list of project tasks and subtasks. To create a task list, you 
enter all of the tasks that must be accomplished to complete the project. This list helps 
you decide what resources and time you’ll need to complete the project. For example, if 
your project is to build a new office building, one major phase is to lay the foundation. 
Subtasks that would fall under the broad task of “Foundation” might include “survey 
and stake,” “excavation,” “footings,” “drainage,” and so on. 
You enter task information as rows in the Sheet pane of Gantt Chart view and list them 
in their order of occurrence. 
User-controlled scheduling 
 
Project 2010 introduces a new feature called user-controlled scheduling. In previous 
versions of Project, the built-in scheduling engine was always on. In Project 2010, the 
default task scheduling mode is manual, meaning that Project will not automatically 
calculate the schedule as you enter tasks and task relationships. This way, if you’re just 
getting started on a project but you don’t have any details just yet, you can plug in some 
general information in lieu of those details. Then, as you get further into the project and 
more details emerge, you can switch to automatic scheduling to take advantage of 
Project’s scheduling engine.  
Manual scheduling mode 
In manual scheduling mode, you determine the start date and duration of each task, and 
Project does not alter that task schedule. No default values are applied when you enter 
tasks, because at the outset of a typical project you might not have exact dates or a 
precise understanding of task durations.  
Depending on the nature of your project, you might want to control how each task is 
scheduled. You can use the Task Mode column to indicate whether a task is manually or 
automatically scheduled. For example, you can manually schedule specific tasks while 
using automatic scheduling for all other tasks, or you can change the task mode for all 
tasks. You might want to use manual scheduling during the planning or proposal phase 
of a project, entering estimates to provide a general idea of the project schedule, and 
then switch to automatic scheduling once the project is approved and tasks are better 
defined.  
Copying information between Project and other applications  
 
You can paste content from other Office applications directly into your Project 2010 
file. This can save you time entering general task information. For example, if your 
manager or colleague sends you an Outlook e-mail message with a bulleted list of initial 
tasks to consider for the project, you can copy the list, paste it directly into the Sheet 
pane, and then add further details as needed.  
 

 
Tasks 
2–3 
 
You can also share project information with stakeholders by pasting content from your 
Project file into other Office applications. For example, if you’re in the initial stages of 
your project planning and you want to share your preliminary task list, you can copy it 
and paste it into an Outlook e-mail message, and it will retain all formatting. 
Do it! 
A-1: Exploring user-controlled scheduling 
 
Here’s how 
Here’s why 
 1 Start Microsoft Project 2010 
A new blank project file opens by default. 
You’ll enter preliminary information about the 
project.  
 2 Click under Task Name 
 
Type New office building 
 
 
Press e 
The task is entered with an ID of 1. Project does 
not enter any default duration or schedule value.  
 
 3 Type Plan and design 
 
 
Press e  
Notice that without a duration value, nothing is 
displayed in the Chart pane.  
 
 4 Enter a task named Foundation 
 
 
 5 In the Duration field for task 1, 
enter 10 months 
To enter an approximate duration value.  
 
Observe the Duration value 
It is automatically abbreviated as “10 mons.”  
 
Observe the task bar 
A faded blue bar indicates that no start or finish 
date is set.  
 
 6 Click in the Start field for task 1 
An arrow appears in the cell.  
 
Click the arrow and click Today 
To enter today’s date as the project start date. 
You can always move the project later.  
 
Observe the task bar 
Now that the task has a start date, the task bar 
does not look faded.  
 
 7 In the Duration field for task 2, 
enter 5 
The default unit of time is days; Project 
automatically adds “days” to the numeric value.  
Set the start date to a few days 
from today 
 
 
 8 In the Duration field for task 3, 
enter Ask Kathy 
Manual scheduling mode allows you to enter 
informal values such as this, which you can 
replace when project details are clarified.

Tasks

Automatic scheduling 
Explanation 
 
To take advantage of Project’s scheduling engine, you need to work in automatic 
scheduling mode. If you’re working with a project file built in manual scheduling mode, 
you can switch to automatic scheduling by clicking the Task Mode column header to 
select all tasks and then clicking Auto Schedule on the Task tab. You can convert 
individual tasks to automatic scheduling by clicking in the Task Mode field for a task 
and selecting Auto Scheduled. If you make a task auto-scheduled, Project determines its 
schedule based on factors such as constraints and dependencies.  
 
If you’re just getting started and you prefer to use Project’s scheduling engine, you can 
set all new tasks to use automatic scheduling. In the status bar, click “New Tasks: 
Manually Scheduled” and select Auto Scheduled. This changes the scheduling mode 
only for new tasks entered in the current project file, and does not affect other project 
files.  
Task durations 
After you identify and list your tasks, you need to plan the duration of each task. You 
specify the duration of a task by entering a value in the Duration column. The default 
time period is days—if you enter a numeric value in a Duration field, “days” is 
automatically appended to the value. To specify a task duration in hours, you can enter a 
value followed by “h,” as in 8h. To specify a value in weeks, you can type a value 
followed by “w,” as in 2w.  
A question mark after a duration value indicates an automatic estimate. You can change 
estimated durations to actual ones as needed or when more details emerge. When a 
Duration field is selected, it changes to a spinner box. Click the up arrow to increase a 
duration value, and click the down arrow to decrease it.  
The task bars (the horizontal blue bars) in the Chart pane graphically represent the

Topic C: The Work Breakdown Structure 
Explanation 
The task list is called a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The task ID numbers 
represent the WBS. The project summary task is the highest level of the WBS, and the 
other tasks are broken down to their lowest manageable levels. The WBS helps you to 
visualize the entire project in terms of scope, cost, time, and resources.  
Summary tasks and subtasks  
 
A summary task can be the overall objective of your project, or it can represent one of 
many major phases in a project. For example, a project summary task, the highest level 
of the work breakdown structure, might be “Build a house.” Summary tasks 
representing major phases within this work breakdown structure might be “Install 
utilities” or “Lay foundation.” A project can have as many summary tasks as needed to 
define a work breakdown structure.  
Tasks that fall under a summary task are called subtasks. A summary task must contain 
subtasks that represent the activities needed to complete the summary task. If you delete 
or move a summary task, all of its subtasks are deleted or moved along with it.  
 
Creating project summary tasks 
To create a project summary task, click the Format tab and check Project Summary 
Task. This adds a summary task, with a default name taken from the project’s file 
name, and gives it a task ID of 0. To rename the project summary task, select the name 
and type a new name.  
Here’s another way to create a project summary task: At the top of the task list, include 
the task that you want to be the project summary. Click the Task Name column heading 
to select all tasks in the list. Then, on the Task tab, click the Indent button. This indents 
all tasks except the first task in the list, thus establishing the highest-level task, the 
project summary task. This method does not set the project summary task ID to 0.  
By default, all summary tasks are formatted with bold text in the Sheet pane. In the 
Chart pane, a summary task is represented by a gray bar that spans the duration of its 
subtasks, as shown in Exhibit 2-1.

Adding summary tasks 
Explanation 
There are two ways to create summary tasks for your major project phases. You can 
click the Summary button in the Insert group on the Task tab. This inserts a summary 
task, with default text, above the task that’s selected in the Sheet pane. You can also 
create a full list of tasks and then use indenting and outdenting to establish the structure.  
Indenting and outdenting tasks 
Indenting and outdenting tasks is a critical part of establishing the WBS. When you 
indent a task, you move it one level down in the task hierarchy, and the task that 
precedes it becomes its summary task. To indent a task, select it and click the Indent 
button on the Task tab.   
 
Moving a task up a level in the hierarchy is called outdenting. To outdent a task, select it 
and click the Outdent button on the Task tab. When you outdent a task, subsequent tasks 
become its subtasks.  
Hiding and showing subtasks 
 
You can collapse subtasks under their summary tasks to focus the task list on your main 
project phases. When you create a summary task, a small box with either a plus sign or a 
minus sign is displayed to the left of the summary task name, as shown in Exhibit 2-2. A 
minus sign indicates that the summary task is expanded; all of its subtasks are visible. A 
plus sign indicates that the subtasks are hidden. Clicking a plus sign expands the 
summary task to reveal its subtasks, while clicking a minus sign hides its subtasks.  
You can also hide or show all subtasks simultaneously. On the View tab, click Outline. 
Then choose either Hide Subtasks or Show Subtasks.  
If your task outline is complex and contains several levels of summary tasks, you can 
choose to hide only certain levels in the outline. On the View tab, click Outline and then 
choose Outline Level 2, Outline Level 3, and so on. If you choose Outline Level 1, only 
the project summary task is displayed. At Outline Level 2, the project summary task and 
all tasks directly beneath it are displayed, while subtasks deeper in the hierarchy are 
hidden, as shown in Exhibit 2-2.  
 
 
Exhibit 2-2: A WBS, with some hidden subtasks

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Hiding columns in the Sheet pane 
 
Another way you can customize your view of a project is to hide columns that you don’t 
need to use regularly. Doing so can make room for other columns and optimize your 
workspace for your specific project needs and your personal preferences. Hiding a 
column does not delete the information from the Project file; it merely conceals the 
information. 
To hide a column, do either of the following:  
 Right-click the column heading and choose Hide Column.  
 Click a column heading (to select the column) and press Delete. 
If you want to add a column, right-click any column and choose Insert Column. Then 
select the desired column from the column heading list.

Milestone tasks 
Explanation 
 
In a typical project, you’ll want to identify tasks that represent the completion of a major 
project phase or activity. These tasks are called milestones; each milestone is checkpoint 
in the life cycle of a project. Milestones have a duration of zero, and they are 
represented by black diamonds in the Gantt chart.  
To insert a milestone task, click the Milestone button in the Insert group on the Task tab 
and then enter the milestone details. If a blank row is selected in the Sheet pane when 
you click Milestone, the milestone task is inserted at that location. If an existing task is 
selected, the milestone is inserted above that task.   
You can also convert an existing task to a milestone. To do so:   
 
1 In the Sheet pane, double-click the task to open the Task Information dialog box.  
2 Click the Advanced tab.  
3 Enter zero as the task duration, and check “Mark task as milestone.” 
4 Click OK.

Explanation 
 
Using the Format tab, you can quickly change Gantt Chart styles. When you’re in Gantt 
Chart view, the Format tab displays several color schemes. Simply click an icon to 
apply the corresponding Gantt Chart style.  
Custom bar styles 
You can use the Bar Styles dialog box to further customize task bars. On the Format tab, 
click Format and choose Bar Styles. Select the chart element you want to format, such 
as Summary or Milestone. Select the desired shape, color, and pattern, and click OK.  
Gridlines 
Sometimes it can be hard to see which task bar corresponds to its task in the Sheet pane. 
Gridlines make it easier to associate tasks in the Sheet pane with their task bars in the 
Chart pane. When you select a task in the Sheet pane, its cell borders extend through the 
Chart pane, making it easier to see which task bar corresponds to that task.  
 
To apply gridlines, click the Format tab, click Gridlines, and choose Gridlines. In the 
Gridlines dialog box, select an option from the “Line to change” list, select a line style 
from the Type list, select an interval if necessary, and click OK. You can also apply

Review questions  
 1 In what circumstances might user-controlled scheduling be helpful to you? 
Answers may vary. You might want to manually schedule tasks during the planning or proposal 
phase of your project, using estimates and informal entries to get a general idea of the project 
schedule, and then switch to automatic scheduling once the project is approved and tasks are 
better defined.   
 2 True or false? If you want to specify that a task’s duration is two weeks, simply 
enter 2 in the Duration column for that task. 
False. The default time period is days. To specify weeks, type 2w. 
 3 True or false? When you rearrange tasks, Project automatically reschedules the task 
list. 
True 
 4 The task hierarchy or outline is called which of the following? 
A The list 
B The Work Breakdown Structure 
C The project pyramid 
D The project summary task 
 5 True or false? You can establish the WBS by entering all of your tasks and then 
indenting and outdenting them to establish the structure.  
True.  
 6 What is a milestone? 
A task that represents the completion of a major project phase or activity. Each milestone is a 
checkpoint in the life cycle of a project. Milestones are represented by black diamonds in the 
Gantt chart.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: Task links 
Explanation 
Scheduling refers to the timing and sequencing of tasks. As a project manager, you’ll 
need to schedule tasks to complete your project on time. As you enter tasks and other 
related information in the task list, Project automatically schedules each task on the 
basis of the project start date (with the exception of any tasks that are set to manual 
scheduling).  
Tasks in a project are often related, so it’s important to sequence them according to their 
relationships. To do this, you link the tasks. After you link tasks, you might need to 
make adjustments, such as modifying dependencies or unlinking some tasks.  
Dependencies 
Tasks are scheduled based on the project’s start date (specified in the Project 
Information dialog box) and the task’s duration. In real life, however, not all tasks start 
on the same date. For example, if you’re building a house, you can’t install a roof on the 
same day that you lay the foundation. There are dependencies between tasks that define 
the way in which tasks are related or linked.  
 
When you link tasks, Project automatically applies a Finish-to-Start task dependency so 
that the start of the second task is dependent on the completion of the first task. For 
example, the task “Plan office layout” must be completed before the task “Begin 
construction” can start.  
The predecessor-successor link  
 
When you link tasks, the task that starts or finishes before the other task can begin is 
called a predecessor task. A task that cannot start or finish until the start or completion 
of a previous task is called a successor task. 
 
To link tasks, select them and click the Link Tasks button on the Task tab. (You can 
also select the tasks and press Ctrl+F2.) When you link tasks, blue arrows link the task 
bars in the Chart pane, helping you to visualize the scheduling relationship between the 
tasks.  
Unlinking tasks  
When you unlink tasks, Project schedules them to start on the same day by default. 
Sometimes you can do this to shorten the duration of your project. Suppose, for 
example, that after linking all tasks, you determine that the tasks “Get approvals” and 
“Select architects” can be done independently and can run in parallel. Therefore, you 
can unlink them. 
 
To unlink tasks, select them and click the Unlink Tasks button on the Task tab. 
Temporary highlighting of changes   
When you make changes that affect the schedule, Project highlights all of the fields in 
the Sheet pane that are affected by the change. The highlighting allows you to verify 
your changes and see how your actions affect task schedules. This highlighting goes 
away when you save your changes or when you make further changes in the project file.

Changing predecessors  
Explanation 
You might need to change the predecessor of a task to make better use of time and 
resources. For example, consider the following short series of tasks: erect external 
walls; install siding; and install roof. The task “Install roof” can start as soon as the task 
“Erect external walls” is completed, and it does not depend on its immediate 
predecessor task, “Install siding.”  
Thus, you can change the predecessor of the task “Install roof” to “Erect external 
walls.” To do so, simply change the value in the Predecessors field to the task ID that 
you want to set as the predecessor.  
You can also use the Task Information dialog box. Here’s how:  
 
1 In the Sheet pane, double-click the task whose predecessor you want to change. 
This opens the Task Information dialog box. 
2 Click the Predecessors tab. 
3 In the ID column, enter the task ID of the task that you want to set as the 
predecessor.  
4 Click OK.

 3 Observe task 22 
(Install roof.) The roof is scheduled to be 
installed after the siding is installed (task 21). 
However, the roof installation does not depend 
on the siding. It depends only on erecting the 
external walls. 
 
 4 Click the Predecessors field for 
task 22 
 
 
Type 19 and press e 
To specify task 19 (Erect external walls) as the 
only predecessor for this task. Now, after the 
external walls are erected, the task of installing 
the roof can begin. 
 
 5 Observe the Predecessor field for 
task 24 
Task 22 (Install roof) is listed as the only 
predecessor for task 24 (Frame internal walls). 
However, the project team decides that the 
windows and external doors should be installed 
before the framing of internal walls begins.  
 
In the Predecessor field, click to 
the right of 22 
 
Task 20 (Install windows, external doors) must 
be completed before task 24 can begin. 
 
Type ,20 and press e 
(A comma, followed by 20.) To make tasks 22 
and 20 predecessors of task 24.

Lag time and lead time 
Explanation 
In your task list, you might have a task that can start before the completion of its 
predecessor. In such cases, you can reschedule your tasks and thereby complete them 
earlier. You can apply lag time or lead time to a task’s predecessor. Lag time is a delay 
that adds time after the completion of a task. For example, consider the task “Install 
trim.” If you add lag time to its predecessor, “Paint,” you can be sure the paint will have 
time to dry before the installation of the trim begins. 

 
Task scheduling 
3–7 
 
 
 
Lead time is overlap between dependent tasks. Sometimes a task can start before its 
predecessor finishes. For example, when a task such as “Install trim” is 75% complete, 
you might determine that the next task, “Install built-in amenities,” can begin. 
Therefore, you can set 25% lead time to the task “Install built-in amenities.”  
 
Applying lag time or lead time 
To apply lag time or lead time, double-click a task in the Sheet pane to open the Task 
Information dialog box. Click the Predecessors tab to view the task’s predecessor(s). To 
apply lag time, enter a positive value in the Lag field for the predecessor and click OK. 
To set lead time, enter a negative value. Using the previous example, you would enter 
-25% in the Lag field.  
You can also double-click the link line between task bars in the Chart pane. This opens 
the Task Dependency dialog box. Enter a value in the Lag box and click OK. 
Do it! 
A-3: Adding lead time and lag time to tasks 
 
Here’s how 
Here’s why 
 
 1 Scroll down and select task 32  
The “Install trim” task. 
 
Click 
 
(In the Editing group.) So that Gantt Chart view 
scrolls to the selected task.  
 
Observe the start date 
Task 32 begins after task 31 is finished. 
 
 2 Double-click task 32 
To open the Task Information dialog box.  
 
Click the Predecessors tab 
“Paint” is listed as the only predecessor of task 
32. 
 
In the Lag box, enter 1 
To add one day of lag time. 
 
Click OK 
There is now one day of lag between the end of 
task 31 and the start of task 32. This will give 
the paint a chance to dry before the trim is 
installed. 
 
 3 Observe the Predecessors field for 
task 32 
The predecessor is task 31, its type is Finish-to-
Start (FS), and there is now one day of lag time.  
 
 4 Double-click Install 
furnishings 
(Task 34.) You’ll add lead time to this task 
because it can begin before its predecessor task 
is finished.  
 
On the Predecessors tab, in the 
Lag field, enter -50% 
Lead time is negative lag time. This change 
ensures that task 34 can begin before task 33 is 
completed. Be sure to include the percent sign, 
or Project will schedule this as -50 days. 
 
Click OK 
To close the dialog box. 

3–8 
Project 2010: Basic  
 
 
 
 5 Observe the link line 
 
This overlapping indicates lead time—the task 
“Install furnishings” starts when its predecessor 
is 50% complete.

task 34 
It shows task 33 as the predecessor, with a 
Finish-to-Start relationship and 50% lead time.

Recurring tasks 
Explanation 
Tasks that occur at regular intervals during the course of a project are called recurring 
tasks. For example, to monitor the progress of your project, you might want to conduct 
review meetings at regular intervals.  
The Sheet pane displays a recurring task as a summary task consisting of subtasks. A 
Recurring Task icon appears in the Indicators field, next to the summary task. For each 
recurring task, task bars appear at regular intervals in the Chart pane. 
To insert a recurring task: 
 
1 In the Task Name field, select the cell below where you want to insert a recurring 
task. 
2 In the Insert group on the Task tab, click the Task button’s arrow and choose 
Recurring Task to open the Recurring Task Information dialog box.  
3 In the Task Name box, enter a name for the recurring task. 
4 In the Duration box, enter the duration. 
5 Under Recurrence pattern, select the time interval. 
6 Under Range of recurrence, in the Start and End by lists, enter the dates across 
which the recurring task will occur. 
7 From the Calendar list, select the calendar you want to use for scheduling the 
recurring task.

Topic B: Task relationships 
Explanation 
As you become familiar with using Microsoft Project, you’ll probably develop your 
own viewing preferences. For example, you might prefer to view task information in 
Network Diagram view.  
Network Diagram view  
Network Diagram view displays the project as a flowchart to help you visualize and 
analyze task details and the links between them. Boxes called nodes represent tasks. 
Lines connect the nodes to indicate task links. Summary tasks are represented by 
parallelograms, and subtasks are represented by rectangles. Each node displays task 
information, such as the task name, task ID, duration, and start and finish dates. 
By default, Network Diagram view displays each node at 100% zoom. However, you 
cannot see the complete flowchart at this level, so you’ll need to scroll horizontally and 
vertically.

Modifying task relationships  
Explanation 
Network Diagram view provides an alternate way to view the links and dependencies 
between tasks. As you review task relationships, you might find that some tasks do not 
actually depend on each other as indicated in the schedule. You can reschedule tasks by 
modifying the task links. (You can do this in Gantt Chart view and Network Diagram 
view.) When you modify a task relationship, Project automatically recalculates the 
project schedule. 
Task relationships 
When you link tasks, you can establish different task relationships, depending on the 
circumstances. The dependencies you use will affect the project schedule. By default, 
Project assigns a Finish-to-Start link. If two tasks can run concurrently, you can apply a 
Start-to-Start dependency. 
The following table describes the available task dependencies and shows how each 
dependency is displayed in a Gantt chart. 
 
Dependency 
Gantt bar example 
Description 
 
Finish-to-Start (FS) 
 
Task B cannot start unless Task A 
is finished. 
 
Start-to-Start (SS) 
 
Task B cannot start unless Task A 
starts. 
 
Finish-to-Finish (FF) 
 
Task B cannot finish unless Task 
A is finished. 
 
Start-to-Finish (SF) 
 
Task B cannot finish unless Task 
A starts. 
 
 
To modify a task dependency, double-click the link line to open the Task Dependency 
dialog box, shown in Exhibit 3-2. From the Type list, select the type of task relationship 
you want to use. Then click OK.

Scrolling the Chart pane 
Perhaps the easiest way to navigate the Chart pane is to use the new Timeline. If you 
want to see more of the Chart pane, you can drag the edge of the Timeline to the right so 
that more calendar days are visible. This compresses the Gantt bars, but they retain their 
relative sizes. 
You can also use the Timeline to scroll to view specific tasks. When you point to the 
horizontal bar above the Timeline, it turns dark blue. Drag it to the left or right to scroll 
the Chart pane.   
The Go To dialog box 
When you have a long task list, it can sometimes be difficult to find a particular task, 
especially if you’re working in Network Diagram view. You can use the Go To dialog 
box to quickly jump to a task. To do so, press F5 or Ctrl+G, enter the task ID or date 
you want to see, and click OK.  
Critical tasks 
Critical tasks are tasks that must be completed on schedule for a project to be finished 
on time. By monitoring the critical tasks in your project and the resources assigned to 
those tasks, you can determine which tasks are affecting your project’s finish date and 
thereby devise a contingency plan if necessary. In Network Diagram view, critical tasks 
are shown in red. Tasks that are not critical remain blue by default. 
The sequence of critical tasks is called the critical path, and it’s dynamic. It changes as 
tasks are completed or delayed or when dependencies between tasks are changed.

(Get approvals.) This task is not currently a 
critical task. You’ll link task 9 to task 10.  
 
 3 Drag from the middle of task 9 to 
task 10 
To create a link between these tasks in Network 
Diagram view. Task 9 is now red, indicating that 
it’s a critical task—any delay in the completion 
of this task can affect the project finish date.

Topic C: Task options  
Explanation 
So far, you’ve learned how to plan a project by creating a task list, linking tasks, and 
defining task dependencies. To manage your project efficiently and effectively, you also 
need to set task types and constraints.  
Task types 
There are three general task types: Fixed Duration, Fixed Work, and Fixed Unit.  
 
Task type 
Description 
 
Fixed Duration 
A Fixed Duration task has a constant time value. Even if you increase the 
resources allocated to the task, the duration will remain the same. For 
example, say that a task has a fixed duration of two days, and two resources 
are assigned to it. Even if another resource is added to the task, Project will 
not change the duration. 
 
Fixed Work 
In a Fixed Work task, the total work to be performed has a constant value. 
The total amount of work performed on a task is the sum of resources used 
on that task. For example, if three resources work an eight-hour schedule for 
two days, the total work performed on the task is 48 hours (3 resources 
multiplied by 8 hours multiplied by 2 days). Therefore, the task has a fixed 
work value of 48 hours. 
 
Fixed Unit 
A Fixed Unit task has a constant quantity or units-of-resource value. For 
example, tasks that require wood or paint are fixed-unit tasks because such 
resources remain constant, regardless of any change in task duration.

Task constraints 
Explanation 
Constraints are limitations imposed on tasks. When planning a project, you need to be 
aware of external factors such as deadlines and the availability of resources. You can set 
task constraints to control the start and finish dates of a task. Task constraints affect a 
project’s schedule, duration, and flexibility.  
The following table describes the task constraints you can apply.  
 
Constraint 
Description 
 
As Late As Possible 
Schedules a task to start as late as possible. Project schedules a task 
with this constraint from the finish date of the project. 
 
As Soon As Possible 
Schedules a task to begin as early as possible. This is the default task 
constraint when you schedule a task from the start date of the 
project. 
 
Finish No Earlier Than 
Schedules a task to finish on or after a specified date. A task with 
this constraint cannot finish before the specified date. 
 
Finish No Later Than 
Schedules a task to finish on or before a specified date. A task with 
this constraint cannot finish after the specified date. 
 
Must Finish On 
Schedules a task to finish on the specified date. 
 
Must Start On 
Schedules a task to start on a specified date. 
 
Start No Earlier Than 
Schedules a task to start on or after a specified date. 
 
Start No Later Than 
Schedules a task to start on or before a specified date.

Unit summary: Task scheduling 
Topic A 
In this topic, you learned how to establish a schedule by linking tasks. You learned 
about task dependencies, and you learned how to link and unlink tasks. You learned 
how to change task predecessors to fine-tune a schedule, and how to set lag time and 
lead time. Finally, you learned how to insert recurring tasks. 
Topic B 
In this topic, you learned how to work in Network Diagram view. You learned how to 
link tasks in this view and modify task relationships. You also learned how to use the 
Go To dialog box to go directly to a task, and how to navigate a Gantt chart by using the 
Timeline.  
Topic C 
In this topic, you learned about the three task types: Fixed Duration, Fixed Work, and 
Fixed Unit. You also learned about various task constraints and how to apply them. 
Independent practice activity 
In this activity, you’ll link and unlink tasks, change the predecessor of a task, and add 
lag time to a task. You’ll also create a recurring task, change the relationship type 
between tasks, and assign a constraint to a task.

 1 True or false? Tasks in a project are often related, so it’s important to sequence 
them according to their relationships.  
True. To do this, you link tasks. You might need to make adjustments afterward, such as 
modifying dependencies or unlinking some tasks.  
 2 True or false? Dependencies between tasks define the way in which tasks are related 
or linked.  
True 
 3 What is lag time? 
Lag time adds extra time after the completion of a task. 
 4 How do you link tasks?  
Select the tasks and click the Link Tasks button on the Task tab. Or select the tasks and press

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: The base calendar 
Explanation 
Project schedules tasks according to a base calendar. A base calendar defines the 
working days and working hours for a project. After you create a base calendar, you 
apply it to a project to establish the project’s calendar. 
Creating a base calendar 
Every project is linked to a base calendar. Project provides three calendars: Standard, 24 
Hour, and Night Shift. The Standard calendar is the default base calendar. It uses a 
Monday-through-Friday work week, working hours from 8 AM to 5 PM (with an hour 
off at noon), and no holidays. You can use any built-in calendar or create a base 
calendar of your own. 
 
Every organization has its own working hours. If your organization’s working and 
nonworking hours differ from the default hours of the base calendar, you can create a 
base calendar and apply it to the project. To plan your project accurately, you’ll also 
need to specify any holidays that your company observes—the default base calendar 
does not include holidays. 
When you designate a day as a working day, it applies to all months. When you 
designate a day as a nonworking day, it applies to only that month. Project then 
schedules all tasks, taking into account designated holidays and nonworking time. 
To create a base calendar and apply it to a project: 
 
1 On the Project tab, click Change Working Time to open the Change Working 
Time Dialog box, shown in Exhibit 4-1.  
2 Click Create New Calendar to open the Create New Base Calendar dialog box. 
3 In the Name box, type a name for the calendar.  
4 Select “Create new base calendar” and click OK. 
5 Make the necessary changes in the calendar in the Change Working Time dialog 
box.  
6 Specify the calendar exceptions and working times for the work weeks. 
7 Click OK to close the Change Working Time dialog box. 
8 On the Ribbon, click Project Information. 
9 From the Calendar list, select the base calendar you just created. Click OK.  
When you save your project file, changes in the base calendar are also saved in the 
project file.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic B: Resources and calendars 
Explanation 
When you’re a project manager, one of the main areas you need to focus on during the 
planning phase of a project is resource availability. You have to determine the resources 
(people, tools, equipment, and materials) and the quantity of each resource that will be 
required for the project. Based on availability, you assign resources to individual tasks 
to meet the goals and objectives of the project. 
The resource pool 
The list of resources needed to complete a project is called the resource pool. It is 
critical that you refer to the Work Breakdown Structure, project objectives, and 
organizational policies when you plan your resources. This helps you to effectively 
assign resources based on their skills, the project requirements, and project costs.  
 
You can add work resources, cost resources, and material resources to your project plan. 
A work resource performs work on a task. Common examples of work resources are 
people and equipment. A cost resource is a fixed amount of money applied to a task 
without making the cost dependent on work performed. For example, storage facility 
costs and airfare are cost resources. A material resource is an item that’s used to 
perform work on a task. Paint, wood, steel, and fuel are examples of material resources. 
The Resource Sheet  
 
You create a resource pool in Resource Sheet view, which resembles a spreadsheet with 
columns and rows. You can enter such information as resource name and type, material 
label, group, standard and overtime rates, cost, and the calendar the resource uses. You 
can review and edit information about any resource in Resource Sheet view.  
The column headings indicate where to enter resource information. For example, enter a 
name in the Resource Name field. Enter the type of resource, such as work, material, or 
cost, in the Type field. Enter a unit of measurement—such as gallons, if the material is 
paint—in the Material Label field. (This field applies only to material resources, not to 
work or cost resources.) Use the Group field to specify a group, such as the department 
or category to which the resource belongs. 
 
By default, the MaxUnits field displays 100%, which indicates the availability of a 
single resource and its working time. For example, if you have two excavators for your 
project, you specify 200% in the MaxUnits field. (This field applies only to work 
resources, not to material or cost resources.) 
Resources and the base calendar 
You assign a calendar to a work resource in the Base Calendar field. Project applies the 
Standard calendar to all work resources unless you first apply a new base calendar to the 
project by using the Project Information dialog box. (Base calendars do not apply to 
material or cost resources.)

Resource calendars 
Explanation 
If you have created and applied a base calendar for your project before you start 
building your resource list, that calendar will automatically appear in the Base Calendar 
column for each work resource. However, if the working and nonworking times of your 
project calendar do not coincide with the availability of a resource, you can create a 
resource calendar. A resource calendar is specific to a particular resource. For example, 
a resource calendar might reflect a resource’s personal vacation schedule. 
To create a resource calendar: 
 
1 In Resource Sheet view, in the Name field, select the resource to which you want 
to assign a calendar. 
2 On the Resource tab, click Information to open the Resource Information dialog 
box.

Task calendars 
Explanation 
You might want to specify a working time that differs from the project calendar or the 
calendars of assigned resources. For example, resources might be available eight hours a 
day from Monday through Friday. However, the tools for the tasks might require 
maintenance every Friday. You can use the task calendar to define an exception for 
scheduling individual tasks that require equipment that runs during nonworking time or 
requires maintenance during working time. 
 
By default, a calendar is not assigned to a task. Project schedules the task according to 
the working and nonworking times in the project calendar. However, when a task 
calendar or a resource calendar is assigned to a task, it takes precedence over the project 
calendar. If you have a task calendar and a calendar for the resource assigned to the task, 
you are prompted to specify which calendar will have precedence over the other.

Topic C: Project costs 
Explanation 
During the planning phase of your project, you can estimate resource costs. However, 
you need to estimate costs carefully to determine your project budget. Project helps you 
calculate resource costs at both the individual and overall levels of a project. You can 
enter resource costs in either Resource Sheet view or the Cost table. 
Resource and task costs 
 
You’ll need to assign costs to each resource and task to determine the project budget. 
When you assign costs, Project calculates the overall cost of the project and the cost of 
individual tasks and resources. You might have different types of costs for different 
types of resources. 
Cost types 
 
Resource and task costs can be categorized as being fixed or variable. A fixed cost 
remains the same even if resources are added or taken away. For example, legal fees and 
permit fees are fixed costs. 
A variable cost varies with the frequency and amount of time a resource is used. For 
example, a construction service company hires an excavator on an hourly basis. This 
cost varies depending on the number of hours the company needs the excavator. 
There are three types of variable costs: standard costs, overtime costs, and per-use costs. 
They are described in the following table. 
 
 
Variable cost 
Description 
 
Standard cost 
The cost incurred to pay a resource for the hours the resource has worked 
on a task during the standard working hours as defined in a project. 
 
Overtime cost 
The cost incurred to pay a resource for the hours the resource has worked 
during overtime working hours as defined in a project. 
 
Per-use cost 
The cost incurred for the use of every unit of a resource in a task. Per-use 
cost is commonly used for resource materials, such as gravel, wood, and 
paint. Project multiplies the per-use cost by the number of units of the 
material used for the task to determine the total cost for the task and the 
resource.

The Cost table 
Explanation 
Project provides predefined tables that you can apply to both tasks and resource views. 
The Cost table is one of them. The Cost table displays cost-related information about 
project tasks; this information includes fixed costs, baseline costs, variances, actual 
costs, and remaining costs. Exhibit 4-2 shows a Cost table in Task Sheet view. 
 
To display the Cost table, click the View tab, click Tables, and choose Cost. The Total 
Cost field displays the cost for the task based on the standard rate of the resource. 
Project multiplies the value in the Std. Rate field for a resource by the number of days 
the resource is working on the task. For example, assume that the standard cost of a 
resource is $43.75 per hour. This resource is assigned to a task with a duration of four 
days. The total cost for this task is $1,400 ($43.75 multiplied by 8 hours, multiplied by 4 
days).

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: Working with views 
Explanation 
Using different views allows you to focus on specific information. Project’s many views 
enable you to enter, organize, and examine project information in a variety of ways. For 
example, to effectively monitor your project, you might want to look at all tasks ending 
in a specific week. You can do this in Calendar view. If you want to get information 
about a resource or a task, in isolation, you can use a form view. Generally, the views 
you use most often will be determined by personal preference, the nature of your 
project, and the specific information you want to focus on.  
Calendar view 
You can use Calendar view when you want to see project tasks that are scheduled for a 
specific day, week, or month in a calendar format. By default, Calendar view displays 
seven days and four weeks of the current month. (You can also display five days instead 
of all seven days in a week.) To navigate to other months, click the Previous and Next 
buttons or use the vertical scroll bar.  
In Calendar view, each task is represented by a blue bar that spans days and weeks 
according to the task’s schedule, as shown in Exhibit 5-1. Nonworking days are shaded 
in gray. The project summary task is displayed as a hollow task bar that acts as a header 
at the top of each week. Summary tasks for project phases are not displayed by default.

Form views  
Explanation 
Form views provide detailed information about an individual task or resource. For 
example, if you want to view schedule or cost-related information for Kathy Sinclair, 
you can use Resource Form view, which shows complete information pertaining only to 
Kathy Sinclair.  
The following table describes the form views. 
 
 
Form view 
Description 
 
Resource Form 
Provides detailed information for a single resource. Click the Previous 
and Next buttons to view information on previous or subsequent 
resources. 
 
Resource Name 
Form 
A simplified version of Resource Form view. You can use this view to 
see all tasks assigned to a resource. 
 
Task Details Form 
Provides details on a single task. Click the Previous and Next buttons to 
view information on previous or subsequent tasks.  
 
Task Form 
Similar to the Task Details Form, but excludes some information, such as 
constraints, priority, and the task’s WBS code.  
 
Task Name Form 
Another simplified version of the Task Details Form. Use this view for 
assigned resource and predecessor information only. 
 
 
To switch to a form view, right-click the gray bar on the left side of the window and 
choose the desired view. If the form you’re looking for is not in the menu, choose More 
Views. Then scroll to locate and select the desired form, and click Apply.  
Each form provides buttons on the Format tab that allow you to quickly switch between 
the different versions of the form. For example, in Task Form view, you can click the 
Task Details Form button or the Task Name Form button to toggle between form 
variations.  
Split views 
With a split view, you can work in a task view, such as Gantt Chart view, while viewing 
related resource information in an easy-to-read form. For example, if you want to 
review your task list and see information such as a task’s assigned resources and their 
total hours assigned to the task, switch to Gantt Chart view and click the View tab. 
Then, in the Split View group, check Details. This action splits the window into two 
panes, with the Gantt Chart at the top and the Task Form at the bottom. You can then 
switch the bottom pane to any other view by selecting an option from the Details list.  
You can’t show the Timeline in a split view. If the Details option is checked, checking 
Timeline will clear the Details option, and vice versa.  
You can also split a view by clicking the Resource tab and then clicking Details. This 
shows the Resource Form below the current view.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Working with the Timeline 
Explanation 
Timeline view provides a graphical, high-level view of your project, which you can 
customize in several ways and share with other Office applications such as Outlook. 
Gantt with Timeline view, the default view in Project 2010, shows the Timeline above 
the Sheet and Chart panes. Timeline view displays only the project timeline.  
The Timeline at the top of Gantt with Timeline view provides an easy way to navigate 
project tasks and focus on specific dates. You can also add tasks to the Timeline to 
create a “big picture” view of your project, which you can format and use for project 
presentations and reviews with stakeholders.   
 
To add tasks to the Timeline, first select a range of tasks. Then right-click the selection 
and choose Add to Timeline. By default, the tasks appear as blue rectangles, sized 
according to their duration. 
Timeline formatting 
 
After you have added tasks to the Timeline, you can format the Timeline in many ways. 
For example, you can apply different colors and fonts, use callouts for task names, and 
change the date format, as shown in Exhibit 5-2.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic B: Working with tables  
Explanation 
Tables are variations of the default Sheet pane layout. You can use tables to focus your 
project data to show specific information about tasks and resources. Many tables share 
common information, such as the Task Name and Duration columns. The default Sheet 
pane layout is called the Entry table. Other built-in tables include the Cost table, the 
Work table, and the Usage table.  
You can customize tables to meet your needs. For example, you can modify the Cost 
table to show only the columns of information that you want, or adjust column widths 
and alignment to suit your preferences.  
Custom tables 
 
To create a custom table, click the View tab, click Tables, and choose More Tables. 
This opens the More Tables dialog box. You can then create a table by clicking the New 
button, naming the table, and selecting the desired columns. Or, to save time selecting 
columns, you can create a table based on an existing table and then change it to suit your 
needs.  
 
To create a table based on an existing table: 
1 On the View tab, click Tables and choose More Tables. 
2 Select the table that you want to base the new table on. 
3 Click Copy to open the Table Definition dialog box. 
4 In the Name box, type a name for the table. 
5 In the list of fields, modify the field name, alignment, width, title, or title 
alignment as needed 
6 Click OK, and then click Apply to apply the new table to the Sheet pane.  
 
You can insert, delete, cut, or copy rows to modify your table fields. To insert a new 
field into a table: 
1 In the Table Definition dialog box, select the field above which you want to 
insert a row. 
2 Click Insert Row. 
3 From the field name list, select the desired field name. 
4 Click OK. 
5 Click Apply. 
Displaying WBS outline numbers 
 
The WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) depicts the hierarchy of tasks in your project as 
an outline. Each task has a unique outline number that indicates its level in the task 
hierarchy. For example, in Exhibit 5-3, “Review meeting” and “Pre-construction” are 
the main tasks under the project summary task. Therefore, they have the WBS codes 1 
and 2, respectively. “Get approvals” and “Select architect” are subtasks of the summary 
task “Pre-construction.” Therefore, they have the WBS codes 2.1 and 2.2, respectively.  
By default, the Sheet pane does not include a WBS column. To show the WBS column, 
you need to add it to the Sheet pane or include it in a table you create. 

 
Views and tables

outline numbers, you can display the numbers directly in the Task Name field, right 
before each task name. To do so, click the Format tab and check Outline Number.  
Replacing columns 
You can replace any column with a new column. To do so, double-click the column 
heading to display a list of available columns. Select the column name from the list to 
replace the previous column.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: Filters 
Explanation 
At times, you’ll likely need to concentrate on a specific set of tasks or resources. For 
example, you might need to see the costs for only certain resources or review only 
critical tasks. You can do this by filtering a view. 
Applying filters 
Project provides several built-in filters, which you can apply by using the Filter list on 
the View tab. If you’re using a task-related view, the options in the Filter list pertain to 
tasks. If you’re using a resource-related view, the options pertain to resources and costs. 
When you filter a view, no information is deleted; it’s simply hidden to allow you to 
focus on the selected information.  
To filter a view: 
 
1 Click the View tab. 
2 From the Filter list, select a filter. 
3 To return to an unfiltered view, select [No Filter] from the Filter list.  
Highlighting information 
 
Like filters, highlighting helps you to focus on a subset of information in a view. Unlike 
filters, highlighting does not hide any information; it just changes the text color of the 
information you want to highlight. To highlight information in a view, select an option 
from the Highlight list on the View tab.  
Do it!

AutoFilters 
Explanation 
AutoFilters are another tool you can use to focus on specific information. You apply an 
AutoFilter to a view by clicking the arrow on the right edge of any column. This opens a 
list of commands, including a list of all items in that column. You can uncheck the items 
that you don’t want to view and click OK, or you can click Filters and select a built-in 
AutoFilter.  
You might want to first apply a standard filter and then use a column’s AutoFilter to 
fine-tune that filtered view. For example, after applying the Date Range filter to display 
only tasks in a specified date range, you might want to then show only those tasks in 
that subset that will take one week or longer to complete. To do this, you would apply 
an AutoFilter to the Duration field.  
To apply an AutoFilter: 
 
1 In the Sheet pane, click the arrow on the right edge of the column you want to 
filter by.  
2 Do either of the following:  
 Click Filters and select a built-in filter. 
 Clear Select All, and then check only those items that you want to show. 
When a filter is applied to a column, the arrow in the column heading is replaced by a 
funnel icon. To turn off that filter, click the funnel icon and select “Clear Filter from 
(Column Name).”  
Do it!

Custom filters  
Explanation 
You can create your own custom filters to selectively show a task or resource list. When 
you apply a custom filter, a dialog box opens in which you can enter your filter criteria. 
For example, to filter tasks or resources for a specific cost value, switch to the Cost table 
within the respective view. Then create your filter. 
To create a custom filter:  
1 On the View tab, from the Filter list, select More Filters to open the More Filters 
dialog box. 
2 Click New to open the Filter Definition dialog box. 
 
3 In the Name box, type a name for the filter. 
4 Verify that “Show in menu” is checked so that the new filter will appear in the 
full list of filters. 
5 Under Field Name, select the first cell to display its drop-down arrow. Click the 
arrow to open the list and select a field name. 
6 Under Test, select a test from the list. 
7 In the Value(s) field, type a message in quotation marks, followed by a question 
mark.  
8 Click OK to close the Filter Definition dialog box. 
9 Click Apply to use the filter now, or click Cancel to use the filter later. 
Custom filters don’t carry over to a different view. After you apply a filter to a view and 
switch to another view, the unfiltered list is displayed. 
Do it!

Topic B: Groups  
Explanation 
You can group tasks or resources in a view to organize project information without 
changing the actual structure of the project. Grouping items can help you to refine your 
project or work out a scheduling problem. For example, you might want to group tasks 
based on their duration to identify the longest and shortest tasks.  
Grouping tasks and resources 
The grouping options that are available depend on the view you’re working in. You can 
apply task-related groups to task-related views, such as the Gantt Chart, Task Usage, 
and Tracking Gantt views. You can apply resource-related groups to resource views, 
such as the Resource Sheet, Resource Usage, and Resource Allocation views. You 
cannot group information in the Calendar, Network Diagram, or Resources Graph 
views.  
 
To group items in a task list or resource list, click the View tab and select an option 
from the Group by list. The results appear in the Sheet pane, with information grouped 
by the specified criterion. As shown in Exhibit 6-1, highlighting helps to visually 
separate each group, and headings for each group are automatically created based on the 
group’s criterion.

Topic C: Sorting tasks and resources  
Explanation 
Sorting displays tasks or resources in a specified sequence. You can sort tasks by 
criteria including cost, start date, and finish date.  
 
Sorting tasks 
When you sort tasks, the task ID numbers do not change, so the task IDs will often 
appear out of sequence. You can restore the task list to its default order by sorting the 
tasks by ID. To sort a task list, click the View tab, click Sort, and select a sort option.

Sorting resources 
Explanation 
You can sort resources to view them in a desired sequence. For example, you might 
want to view all resources in alphabetical order. To sort a resource list, switch to 
Resource Sheet view. On the View tab, click Sort to open a list of options. You can sort 
resources based on criteria including group, name, and cost. 
You can apply more than one sort criterion. For example, you can sort resources 
alphabetically by group, and then sort the grouped resources by their names.  
As with tasks, when you sort a resource list, the resource ID numbers do not change, so 
the IDs might appear out of sequence, as shown in Exhibit 6-2. To restore the resource 
list to its default order, sort the resources by ID.

Renumbering a sorted list  
Explanation 
Sorting does not change the ID numbers of tasks or resources, and the resulting non-
sequential ID numbers might not suit your needs or preferences. You can renumber 
sorted tasks and resources in their respective sheets. When you do, the original order of 
each sheet is changed. Exhibit 6-3 shows the same resource list as Exhibit 6-2, but with 
new resource ID numbers. 
To renumber resources or tasks: 
 
1 On the View tab, click Sort and choose Sort by.  
2 Check “Permanently renumber resources” (or “Permanently renumber tasks,” 
depending on the view). 
3 Click Sort.

Unit summary: Filters, groups, and sorting  
Topic A 
In this topic, you learned how to apply filters so that you can focus on a specific set of 
tasks or resources and hide information you don’t need to see. You learned how to 
highlight certain information, use AutoFilters, and create your own custom filters to 
selectively view a task or resource list.  
Topic B 
In this topic, you learned how to group tasks and resources to organize project 
information without changing the structure of the project. You also learned how to 
create custom groups to selectively arrange tasks and resources. 
Topic C 
In this topic, you learned how to sort tasks and resources to display project 
information in a desired sequence. Finally, you learned how to permanently renumber a 
sorted task or resource list. 
Independent practice activity  
In this activity, you’ll apply filters to view specific information. Then you’ll filter a 
view by group and sort resources by multiple criteria. 
The files for this activity are in Student Data folder Unit 6\Unit summary. 
 1 Open Construction. 
 2 Save the file as My Construction.  
 3 Filter the task list to show only those tasks to which Tim Walson is assigned. 
(Hint: Apply the Using Resource filter.) 
 4 Apply an AutoFilter to show only those tasks with a duration of 1 week or more. 
 5 Unfilter the task list. (Hint: Use the Filter list.) 
 6 Switch to Resource Sheet view. Use the Group column’s AutoFilter to show only 
those resources that belong to the group Skilled labor. (Hint: First, clear Select All.) 
 7 Show all resources.  
 8 Without permanently renumbering them, sort the resources first by Group and then 
by Name. (Hint: Clear “Permanently renumber resources.”)

True. You can apply task-related groups to task-related views, and apply resource-related groups 
to resource views. 
 5 True or false? You can apply an AutoFilter to an already filtered task or resource 
list. 
True. For example, after applying the Date Range filter to display only tasks in a specified date 
range, you might want to then view only those tasks in that subset that will take one week or 
longer to complete.  
 6 After sorting a task or resource list several times, how do you return it to its original 
order?  
By default, sorting does not alter the ID numbers. Therefore, you can restore a list to its original 
order by sorting by ID numbers.

Project 2010: Basic  
 
Topic A: Finalizing schedules 
Explanation 
To manage a project effectively, you’ll need to review your tasks to ensure that they 
meet the project objectives. You’ll need to review the schedule and modify it as needed 
early in the planning process so that the project runs smoothly in the implementation 
phase. After making revisions, you can adjust the schedule to meet the project deadline. 
The critical path 
When you analyze a project schedule, you need to be aware of the project’s critical 
tasks. Critical tasks are those tasks that must be completed on time for the project to 
finish on schedule. Changes made in critical tasks directly affect the finish date of the 
project. For example, if you increase the duration of a critical task, the project 
completion date will be delayed. If you reduce the time it takes to complete a critical 
task, the project completion date will move up. The critical path is the sequence of all 
critical tasks in a project.  
It’s important to note that in terms of work performed, critical tasks might be no more 
or less important than any other project tasks. They are considered critical only because 
their duration directly affects the project’s completion date.  
Viewing critical tasks 
 
To show critical tasks in Gantt Chart view, click the Format tab and check Critical 
Tasks. By default, Project displays critical tasks as red task bars. You can also switch to 
Detail Gantt view, which automatically displays critical tasks as red task bars.  
Slack 
 
Slack is the amount of time you can delay tasks without affecting the project schedule. 
More specifically, free slack is the amount of time a task can be delayed before it delays 
another task, and total slack is the amount of time a task can slip without delaying the 
project completion date.  
Viewing slack in a schedule 
To show available slack in Gantt Chart view, click the Format tab and check Slack. In 
the Chart pane, slack is indicated by thin bars extending to the right of task bars. You 
can also switch to Detail Gantt view, which automatically displays slack in your project.  
Detail Gantt view also includes the Free Slack and Total Slack columns in the Sheet 
pane. You can always manually add those columns to a task list.

Effort-driven schedules  
Explanation 
Project uses the following scheduling formula:  
Duration = Work (Effort) / Resource Units 
 
When you add resources to or remove resources from an effort-driven task, the duration 
of the task is modified to reflect the impact of more or fewer resources, but the work 
needed to complete the task remains unchanged. This method is called effort-driven 
scheduling, and it’s Project’s default scheduling mode.  
Consider a task in which the duration of work is four days, and two resources are 
assigned to it for eight hours per day. Total effort is calculated by multiplying the 
duration by the number of resources. The total effort on this task is 64 hours (8 hours 
multiplied by 4 days multiplied by 2 resources). If you add two more resources to this 
task, Project will decrease the task duration to two days, keeping the total effort 
constant. 
Non-effort-driven tasks 
If a task is not effort-driven, then either the duration or the resource units must remain 
constant. Disabling effort-driven scheduling for a fixed-duration task can help you 
determine the effect that adding or removing a resource will have on the total amount of 
work involved in a task.  
To make a task non-effort-driven:  
 
1 Double-click the task name to open the Task Information dialog box. 
2 Click the Advanced tab.

Here’s how 
Here’s why 
 
 1 Observe the task bars for tasks 32 
and 33 
Task 32 (“Distribute heating, cooling”) is blue, 
indicating that it’s not a critical task. Task 33 
(“Distribute electricity, phone, cabling”) is red, 
indicating that it’s a critical task. 
 
 2 Point to the task bar for task 33 
The ScreenTip shows that this task has a 
scheduled duration of eight days. 
 
In the Timeline, observe the 
project finish date 
The project is scheduled to finish on June 26. 
The project is taking longer than desired, so 
you’ll shorten the critical path to shorten the 
overall project. 
 3 Double-click Distribute 
electricity, phone, cabling 
(Task 33.) To open the Task Information dialog 
box. You’ll assign a new resource but will keep 
the Effort driven setting. 
Click the Advanced tab 
 
 
Verify that Effort driven 
is checked 
You’ll observe the changes that Project makes in 
the task duration when Effort driven is checked. 
 
 4 Click the Resources tab 
Notice that David, Jerry, Ann, and Susan are 
assigned to this task. You’ll add another 
resource to decrease the task duration.

 8 Observe the task bars for tasks 32 
and 33 
Task 33 has changed from red to blue, indicating 
that it’s no longer a critical task. Task 32 has 
changed from blue to red because it’s now a 
critical task; any delay in completing task 32 
will delay the project finish date.  
 
Observe the change in free slack 
Now, task 33 and 34 have two days and three 
days of free slack, respectively.  
 
In the Timeline, observe the 
project finish date 
The project finish date has been moved up four 
days, to June 22.

Topic B: Handling resource conflicts 
Explanation 
If a single resource is assigned to different tasks, that resource might exceed his or her 
work hours. Resources are over-allocated when they are scheduled to do more work 
than can be accomplished in the specified time. 
Identifying resource over-allocation 
In a resource view, it’s easy to identify resources that are over-allocated—their 
information appears in bold red text, and the Indicators field displays a yellow warning 
icon. In Gantt Chart view, a task with an over-allocated resource assigned to it shows a 
red figure icon in the Indicators field.  
Project also provides views that display the nature of resource allocation in your project. 
For example, Resource Sheet view displays several columns of information relevant to 
over-allocation, including Max Units and Cost/Use. Resource Graph view shows a 
graphical representation of the workload of a single resource. Resource Usage view 
shows a resource’s total work and details of where the work is distributed on a calendar, 
as shown in Exhibit 7-2.

It provides a Work row to show how many 
hours of work a resource is assigned on 
individual days.  
 
On the Format tab, check 
Overallocation 
Now the Details column has rows for Work and 
Overallocation, so you can see the number of 
hours by which a resource is over-allocated.

Resolving resource over-allocation 
Explanation 
When you identify a resource that is over-allocated, you should act to resolve the over-
allocation. How you resolve resource over-allocation will depend on the limitations of 
the project. Limitations might include the project budget, resource availability, and 
flexibility within the tasks that make up the schedule. 
Resource leveling is the process of resolving resource over-allocation by adjusting 
resource assignments. You can level resources manually or let Project do it 
automatically. When you use Project’s automatic leveling, tasks are delayed or split, 
which might not be the desired solution—especially because this can delay the project 
finish date. Also, if you want to reduce the workload of an over-allocated resource by 
assigning some of his or her tasks to an under-allocated resource, you can’t use 
automatic leveling because it does not change who is assigned to tasks.  
You can level resources manually in any of the following ways: 
 
 Replace the over-allocated resource with an under-allocated resource. 
 Assign an additional resource to the task. 
 Reduce the work assignments of a task and increase the duration for its 
completion. 
 Increase the working time of the resource. 
Do it! 
B-2: Discussing resource over-allocation 
 
Questions and answers 
 
 1 If a resource is assigned to more than one task in the same time period, how would 
you resolve the over-allocation? 
 
 
 2 If a group of four contract laborers is allocated at 500%, how would you resolve 
this over-allocation? 
 
 
 3 If a part-time resource is assigned full-time to a task, how might you resolve this 
resource over-allocation? 
 
 
 4 Why is it important to use Project’s automatic leveling feature carefully?

Filtering resources 
Explanation 
When you need to resolve resource issues such as over-allocation, it can be helpful to 
narrow down your resource list by filtering for a particular group, cost, or some other 
category. For example, if you want to use Resource Usage view to look for resources 
that might be available to fill in for an over-allocated resource, you can use the Filter list 
on the View tab to focus on only those resources that meet a certain criterion.   
Do it! 
B-3: Filtering for specific resources 
 
Here’s how 
Here’s why 
 1 Click the View tab 
You’ll look for resources in the Labor group that 
can reduce David James’s workload for the 
week of May 7.  
 
 2 From the Filter list, select 
Group… 
To open the Group dialog box. 
 
Type labor and click OK 
To show only resources in the Labor group. 
 
 3 Look for resources that might be 
available the week of May 7 
(Scroll down the list.) All resources in this group 
are already busy during most of the days that 
David is over-allocated. Laurie Macurthy and 
Tim Walson have some time available on 
Friday, but it won’t be enough to resolve 
David’s over-allocation.

Leveling resources  
Explanation 
You can use the Level Resource command on the Resource tab to automatically level an 
over-allocated resource. When you use this command, Project applies the settings in the 
Leveling Options dialog box. To open this dialog box and change the leveling options, 
click Leveling Options on the Resource tab.  
 
As mentioned earlier, when you use automatic resource leveling (using the Level 
Resources command), you might not always like the results. For example, Project might 
delay or split a task, and this could affect the project finish date.  
Manual resource leveling 
 
By manually leveling a resource, you have more control over how you resolve resource 
over-allocation. For example, if a resource is allocated to work on two tasks that are 
scheduled at the same time, you can manually change the units so that the resource 
works on both tasks at 50%.  
To level a resource manually, double-click the task name that has an over-allocation. In 
the Task Information dialog box, click the Resources tab and edit the resource 
assignment as needed.

assignments 
On Tuesday, David’s work has been split 
between “Frame internal walls” and “Distribute 
heating, cooling.” Also, he has been taken off 
the task “Distribute electricity, phone, and 
cabling.” This may or may not be the desired 
solution.
