Preface
Generalized fading channels are rather recent channel models. The beauty of
the generalized fading distributions, viz. η −µ, κ−µ and α−µ, is that all the
previous fading distributions like Rayleigh, Rician, Weibull, etc. are partic-
ular cases of them. Muliple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless commu-
nications is one of the biggest advancements in the wireless communications.
MIMO systems can achieve rate and diversity gains over single-input single-
output (SISO) systems without penalty in bandwidth and signal power. There
has been a sizable number of research papers in MIMO wireless communica-
tions over generalized fading channels. This is the ﬁrst book which discusses
in depth about the MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading
channels.
Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to MIMO wireless communications.
In this, we will discuss about the evolution of MIMO systems from receiver
diversity combining schemes. After a short introduction to MIMO system and
channel models, a detailed discussion on open and closed loop MIMO systems
will be presented.
Chapter 2 describes about the generalized fading channels. After a brief
discussion on fading channels and classical fading channels, thorough analyses
on the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function
(CDF) and moment generating function (MGF) of generalized fading distri-
butions like Nakagami-m, η−µ, κ−µ and α−µ fading channels are presented.
MIMO gives spatial multiplexing gain over SISO systems. It is the sub-
ject of focus in the third chapter. We will introduce the reader to diversity-
multiplexing trade-oﬀfor MIMO system design and analyze the spatially mul-
tiplexed MIMO systems over Nakagami-m, η −µ, κ −µ and α −µ fading
channels.
Spatial modulation, as the name suggests, does modulation over space.
It is a relatively new MIMO technique with multiple advantages. Chapter
4 provides performance analysis of spatial modulated MIMO systems over
Nakagami-m, η −µ, κ −µ and α −µ fading channels. A brief introduction to
generalized spatial modulation will also be given at the end of this chapter.
Antenna selection is widely explored in the MIMO literature. In Chapter 5,
after a brief discussion on antenna selection criteria, a thorough performance
analysis of transmit antenna selection (TAS) over Nakagami-m, η−µ, κ−µ and
α −µ fading channels will be provided. The performance metrics considered
are probability of error, channel capacity and outage probability.

Preface
Chapter 6 will present about the space time block codes (STBC), which
give diversity gain over SISO systems. We will ﬁrst discuss about the STBC
design criteria, generation and detection. Then we will provide the perfor-
mance of STBC over Nakagami-m, η −µ, κ −µ and α −µ fading channels.
MIMO is already employed in fourth generation (4G) mobile and it will
be fully utilized in ﬁfth generation (5G) mobile. Chapter 7 will start with
the introduction of multiuser MIMO. Three big pillars of 5G, viz. massive
MIMO, millimeter wave (mmWave) and small cell networks, will be brieﬂy
discussed. Next, device-to-device (D2D) communications for internet of things
(IoT) will be presented. Finally we will touch upon the basics of large scale
MIMO systems.
We hope that this book will be useful as a reference for MIMO wireless
researchers.

Marconi is regarded as the father of wireless communications. But there are
some articles that regard J. C. Bose to be the inventor of the solid-state wire-
less receiver that was used by Marconi in his experiments [1, 10, 98]. Since
then, wireless communication technology has been advancing with the ad-
vancements of semiconductor devices and highly capable computers. The de-
mand is also increasing at an exponential rate. With commercialization of
third generation (3G) wireless technology, the communication systems are no
longer limited to mobile phone calls. Wireless systems have expanded their
horizons to internet data which generate many folds of data traﬃc than the
voice traﬃc alone. This led the researchers to ﬁnd solutions and techniques
that enable wireless systems to carry more data per unit bandwidth, i.e.,
better spectral eﬃciency. It can be achieved by using higher order modula-
tion schemes but higher order modulation schemes are found to degrade the
bit error rate (BER) performance of the communication systems because of
the reduced separation of constellation points. Multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) wireless systems come as a rescue. In wireless communication sys-

tems, we deﬁne MIMO systems as those systems in which the transmitter and
the receiver terminals contain multiple antennas. In this chapter, we describe
the need to go for MIMO systems. The following sections will summarize how
the communication paradigm shifted from single antenna systems to MIMO
systems. It is aimed to make the readers familiar with diﬀerent channel models
being used for the analysis of MIMO systems. And ﬁnally, various variants of
MIMO systems will be discussed in two broad categories, as open loop MIMO
systems and closed loop MIMO systems.
1.1
Evolution of MIMO systems
In this section, we will discuss the paradigm shift from analog communication
systems to digital communication systems and from single-input single-output
(SISO) systems to MIMO systems. The concept of wireless communication is
not modern. There are evidences of passing messages through various sounds
and ﬁre alarms even in the era before the sapiens. It may be considered as
the beginning of wireless communication (it was not electronic though). It
was the carrier less wireless communication. The sequence of diﬀerent sounds
carried diﬀerent messages. However, it did not make a possibility for people
at distance to talk. This was given an electrical form by Morse in the name
of Morse code in which each English character was coded using a sequence of
dots and dashes. This was a transmission of messages in digital form but with-
out any need to use a career (pulsed communication over wire line). However,
the beginning of wireless communications in the form of electromagnetic sig-
nals started with analog communication systems using amplitude modulation
(AM) and frequency modulation (FM). In fact, FM was the globally accepted
modulation scheme for ﬁrst generation (1G) wireless technology [107]. The
second generation (2G) wireless technology was the result of germinating dig-
ital era. In 2G, the service providers used digital modulation schemes such as
binary phase shift keying (BPSK), Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK)
and diﬀerential phase shift keying (DPSK), and multiple access technologies
like time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access
(CDMA) which were not possible to use with the analog modulation schemes.
Up to 2G, the voice traﬃc over wireless channels had been the main focus.
It introduced the short message service (SMS) service though. Internet over
wireless links begins with further advancement of 2G wireless technology. With
updated softwares of 2G wireless systems, it introduced data services using
technologies like general packet radio service (GPRS) and enhanced data rates
for global evolution (EDGE). Further, to fulﬁll the increasing demands (mainly
of internet data speed) from the exponentially growing consumers, researchers
standardized wideband CDMA with wider bands and higher data rates which
we commonly call 3G. By the time of the beginning of 3G, it was clear that

further improvements in the data rates and performance were no more pos-
sible with single antenna systems. Use of multiple antennas at the receivers
and diﬀerent diversity combining schemes improved the BER performance.
MIMO systems have already been used in fourth generation (4G) technolo-
gies and WiMAX. In long term evolution (LTE), up to eight antennas have
been allowed at the transmitter and receiver. Researchers have moved into
large MIMO systems where transmitter and receivers are considered to have
100s and 1000s of antennas [19]. A brief insight to the beneﬁts and shortcom-
ings of various modulation schemes and diversity techniques that motivated
to shift the paradigm toward MIMO systems is given further.
At this point of discussion about the evolution of MIMO systems, we
focused on the following requirements for better quality of service.
• Higher spectral eﬃciency, i.e., transmission of more number of bits
per channel use per unit channel bandwidth
• Minimum possible BER
1.1.1
Higher order modulation schemes
Of the requirements mentioned above, again coming to SISO systems, higher
spectral eﬃciency may be achieved with the help of M-ary modulation
schemes. In M-ary modulation schemes, multiple bits are transmitted in ev-
ery symbol. So, M-ary modulation schemes can eﬀectively improve the spec-
tral eﬃciency. But, to achieve gain in spectral eﬃciency of M-ary modulation
schemes, we need to pay in terms of power eﬃciency to achieve the required
BER. The power eﬃciency and BER are dependent on each other. It can be
observed in the constellation diagram in Figure 1.1. It shows the constellation
diagram for 4-(Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)QAM and 16-QAM keep-
ing energy per bit the same for both cases. It can be observed that moving
from 4-QAM to 16-QAM (from lower order modulation scheme to higher order
modulation scheme) the constellation points come closer to each other. Nearer
constellation points result in higher probability of error as observed in Figure
1.2. The higher probability of error can be explained as follows. The constella-
tion points get dislocated from their original position due to any added noise
in the signal while propagating and processing. It is possible that the point
received has smaller distance from the other point than the actual transmit-
ted constellation point. If the distances between constellation points are less,
the probability of the received point becoming nearer to the point other than
the actual transmitted point increases. So, to keep the BER of higher order
modulation scheme that same as of the lower order modulation scheme, the

distance between constellation points must be made equal to that of the lower
order modulation scheme. It can be achieved by transmitting more energy per
symbol which results in degraded power eﬃciency of higher order modulation
scheme if the bit rate is kept the same.
[It is important to note here that many authors consider equal symbol en-
ergy for the comparison of distances among constellation points/power eﬃ-
ciency and BER of various modulation schemes. However, considering equal
energy per transmitted bit is a more generic way to compare these metrics, as
bit is the basic unit of digital information and it remains the same for any
modulation scheme.]
From constellation diagrams for 4-QAM and 16-QAM, it can be observed
that the nearest constellation points are 2Eb apart for 4-QAM, while for 16-
QAM they are approximately 0.8Eb apart. This results in almost 4dB loss in
terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 16-QAM as compared to 4-QAM as
observed in Figure 1.2.
By this time, it is clear that M-ary modulation schemes can
achieve better spectral eﬃciencies as the larger constellations are
selected. But it degrades BER performance. Thus, M-ary modula-
tion schemes introduce a trade-oﬀbetween spectral eﬃciency and
BER performance of the system.
Degradation in BER with higher order modulation schemes is already ex-
plained. The other factor that is responsible for degradation in BER perfor-
mance is the environment. Multiple mobile and immobile obstacles in the path
between transmitter and receiver are responsible for multiple copies reaching

at the receiver with random strength and diﬀerent phases. This results in
variation of received power in temporal as well as spatial domain. This phe-
nomenon is known as fading and the environment is referred to as scattering
environment.
Now, the problem of improvement in BER performance of wireless com-
munication systems opened up when the M-ary modulation schemes had been
implemented in the scattering environment. To deal with the problem without
increasing the transmitted power, various diversity techniques may be used.
Diversity techniques use the fact that the signals received from diﬀerent paths
in the scattering environment may be of diﬀerent strengths at diﬀerent points
in space and/or time, i.e., receiving multiple copies of the same signal and
extracting the transmitted data stream from the strongest signal can help to
improve the BER performance without demanding extra power/energy at the
transmitter.
1.1.2
Diversity techniques
Fading causes severe degradation in the performances of wireless communica-
tion systems, the most important being erroneously received data (compare
BER curves of Figure 1.2 without fading and Figure 1.3 with fading). The
most commonly studied methods to overcome the eﬀect of fading are the
diversity combining schemes such as spatial diversity scheme, temporal diver-
sity scheme, spectral diversity scheme, polarization diversity scheme, etc. of

which spatial diversity techniques are the most commonly used and highly
studied diversity techniques. Spatial diversity techniques take advantage of
spatial variation in the signal strength due to multipath components and com-
bine them accordingly using multiple antennas at the receiver. Thus, diversity
systems can be categorized as single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems.
Implementing a diversity system requires no extra frequency band (except
in frequency diversity), no added latency (except in time diversity), etc. The
commonly used spatial diversity combining schemes are: selection combin-
ing (SC), equal gain combining (EGC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC).
Each of these combining techniques is discussed in brief as follows.
1.1.2.1
Selection diversity
It is the simplest of all spatial diversity schemes. It takes advantage of the
spatial variation in received power due to which the signal may have diﬀerent
strengths at diﬀerent points in space. So, it is highly likely that the signal has
suﬃcient strength at one of the antennas at the receiver. Keeping this fact
into consideration, signal received at the antenna having the highest strength
is passed to the detector and decoded to recover the transmitted signal.
1.1.2.2
Equal gain combining
EGC also takes advantage of diﬀerent strengths at diﬀerent locations. But
unlike selection diversity scheme, it uses all the received signals including the
weaker signals. Before passing the signal to the detector, received signals from

branches at receiver
all the receiver antennas are co-phased and added. The resultant signals are
then used to recover the transmitted message. EGC gives better performance
compared to SC because it uses less strong signals also in addition to the
strongest signal.
1.1.2.3
Maximal ratio combining
This is a more complex diversity combining scheme to implement as com-
pared to EGC and SC. It has been inspired from EGC to further improve
the system performance. In addition to co-phasing the received signals, each
signal is ampliﬁed such that after combining the SNR gets maximized. With
this added complexity, MRC gives the best error performance among all the
spatial diversity combining schemes. So, sometimes, it is also referred to as
optimal combining scheme, i.e., the combining scheme that gives optimum
error performance. MRC has been a popular and widely explored technique
for its optimality. However, this optimality is achieved at the cost of added
implementation complexity.
Overall, all the diversity techniques take advantage of the fact that if
multiple copies of signals are available at the receiver, the best one can be
identiﬁed and processed. This not only improves the BER performance but
also improves the rate at which BER reduces with increase in the SNR. The
eﬀect of number of branches on BER performance and the improved BER
with more number of branches at the receiver can be observed in Figure 1.4.

8
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
At this point, readers may feel that BER performance can be improved us-
ing more and more number of branches at the receiver and this takes care
of the degradation in the BER due to higher order modulation techniques.
However, if we observe Figure 1.4 carefully, the improvement in the BER for
each additional branch keeps on reducing as we go on increasing the number
of branches at the receiver. Again, number of branches at receiver cannot be
increased indeﬁnitely. So, even after using diversity techniques, it is not pos-
sible to deal with the requirement of the spectral eﬃciency. This opened the
doors for using multiple antennas at the transmitter so that information can
be transmitted simultaneously. Multiple antennas at the transmitter trans-
mitting parallel data streams using the same channel. This enhances the data
transmission rate of the channel and hence improves the spectral eﬃciency.
Such communication systems using multiple antennas both at transmitter
and receiver are known as MIMO systems [43, 93, 131]. MIMO systems get
beneﬁt from the scattering environment. In fact, scattering environment is
the requirement for MIMO systems to function well. The requirement of rich
scattering is explained in detail in the next section. Further in this chapter,
we will discuss various aspects of MIMO systems and their variants.
Note: Scattering environment actually degrades performance of wire-
less communication systems. But, MIMO systems use the same scatter-
ing phenomena to enhance the data rates and hence the spectral eﬃ-
ciency.
1.2
MIMO system and channel models
For the sake of introduction to MIMO channel models, let’s begin with the
process of signal transmission from a transmitter to a receiver (SISO case). A
signal transmitted through wireless media from transmitter undergoes phys-
ical processes like reﬂection, refraction, diﬀraction and scattering on its way
to the receiver in channel [107]. In process, the received signal is a group of
multiple copies of the same signal received through multiple paths after ex-
periencing multiple physical processes. Most of the time, the delays of all the
received multipath components are negligible as compared to the bit/symbol
duration. All the multipath components have undergone some physical pro-
cess. So, they arrive at the receiver with diﬀerent magnitude and diﬀerent
phase. In general, all the received multipath components can be decomposed
into in-phase (real) and quadrature phase (imaginary) components. Thus, the
received signal is a sum of in-phase components and quadrature phase com-

ponents of the multipath copies received. All these components have random
magnitude and phase. So, real and imaginary components may be assumed
as random variables with either a positive or a negative sign. In practice,
when the number of multipath components is suﬃciently large with no domi-
nant component, both the resultant components (real and imaginary) may be
assumed to follow Gaussian distribution by applying the central limit theo-
rem [91]. The envelopes of such channels are known to be Rayleigh distributed,
which will be discussed in the next chapter. In such a case, the received signal
is given as
r = hx + n
(1.1)
where h = hr + jhi is the channel coeﬃcient which is the impulse response
of the link between transmitter and receiver, x is the transmitted bit/symbol,
n is additive noise and hr and hi are real and imaginary components of the
channel coeﬃcient. Consider the MIMO system model shown in Figure 1.5. It
contains Nt antennas at transmitter and Nr antennas at receiver. Throughout
the text, we refer to such MIMO systems as Nt × Nr MIMO systems. For an
Nt × Nr MIMO system, there will be a total of NtNr links from transmitter
to the receiver. Hence, the channel coeﬃcient would no longer be a single
element as in the SISO case. Now, the channel can be represented as a matrix
of dimension Nr ×Nt. And the received signal would be a vector of dimension
Nr × 1. It can be given as
r = Hx + n
(1.2)
where H is the channel matrix containing NrNt complex elements, x is the
transmitted vector of dimension Nt × 1 and n is the additive noise vector of
dimension Nr × 1, i.e.

where ri is the signal received at the ith receiving antenna, xi is the sym-
bol transmitted through the ith transmitting antenna and hij is the complex
channel coeﬃcient of the wireless link between ith receive antenna and jth
transmit antenna. Channel modeling is an essential requirement to analyze
various performance metrics of wireless communication systems. In most of
the cases, it is assumed that the received signal is a collection of many mul-
tipath components generated as a result of reﬂections/diﬀraction/scattering
from various obstacles in the path between transmitter and receiver. As a re-
sult, the real and imaginary part of the channel can be modeled as Gaussian
distributed. The magnitude of gain of such channels follows Rayleigh distribu-
tion. Therefore, such channels are known as Rayleigh fading channels. Various
generalized channel models are discussed in the next chapter.

MIMO systems can be classiﬁed as open loop MIMO systems or closed
loop MIMO systems based on the scheme used for transmission of information.
Some transmission schemes need a feedback link from receiver to transmitter
to provide information about channel states or some parameter of channel
matrix. Such MIMO systems requiring feedback link are known as closed loop
MIMO systems, while those MIMO systems which do not require any infor-
mation at the transmitter back from receiver are known as open loop MIMO
systems.
1.3
Open loop MIMO systems
Transmitter transmits a pilot sequence of binary data which is already known
at the receiver. With the help of pilot transmission, the channel matrix is
estimated at the receiver. In open loop MIMO systems, this information about
channel matrix is used and required only at the receiver to decode the signal
which is received after the pilot sequence is over. Various MIMO systems
that use open loop conﬁguration are spatial multiplexing, spatial modulation,
space time block codes, space time block coded spatial modulation, etc. In
the subsequent part of this section, we will familiarize with these variants of
MIMO systems.

Introduction to MIMO Systems

1.3.1
Spatial multiplexing
In spatial multiplexing, the incoming data stream is converted from serial to
parallel for transmission. The parallel streams of information obtained after
this conversion are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas avail-
able at the transmitter [43,93,131]. This has two main impacts on the practical
aspects of wireless communication systems.
• Bandwidth requirement would reduce if the data are transmitted simulta-
neously using the same rate at which it is generated. This is more useful
for real time data transmission.
• The eﬀective data rate becomes proportional to the number of transmit-
ting antenna. This makes overall communication faster. This becomes use-
ful when already stored data are to be transmitted (more towards the
applications of internet or for multimedia transmission).
When compared to systems with single antenna at the transmitter, this
makes the transmission rate as many times as the number of antennas available
at the transmitter [128].
Multipath/scattering and fading had been considered to be impairment
until invention of MIMO systems. The following example demonstrates the
positive aspects of rich scattering environment for MIMO systems. Consider
a 2 × 2 MIMO system. It is used to transmit information using the BPSK
modulation scheme. Assume that there is no multipath fading. In conditions
without fading, all the channel coeﬃcients are unity. Thus, the channel matrix
is of size 2×2 with all entries equal to ‘1’, i.e., H =

. Let, the groups
of two incoming bits at a time be ‘0, 0’, ‘0, 1’, ‘1, 0’ or ‘1, 1’. Using BPSK they
will be respectively mapped as x1 =

, which will now onward be called “transmitted codewords”. Both
of the BPSK modulated bits will be transmitted simultaneously from the two
antennas at the transmitter. Received signal at both the receive antennas
in absence of noise for each of the cases may be given by ri = Hxi, which
can respectively be represented as r1 =

It is clear from the above example that the receiver can decode the symbols
correctly only in the case when the transmitted bits/symbols from each of the
transmitter antennas are same. In the other two cases, the received vectors
are the same for the two cases. So, a correct decision is not possible even in
the absence of noise. However, in noisy conditions there is possibility of error
in all the cases.

Now, consider wireless transmission through a rich scattering environment.
This introduces randomness in the channel coeﬃcients. Now, the channel ma-
trix can be represented as H =

For detection at the receiver using the maximum likelihood (ML) rule
which gives optimum performance in terms of BER/symbol error rate (SER),
the detected symbol is obtained as
id = arg min
j
|r −Hxj|2
(1.4)
where id is the index of the detected vector when received vector is r. So, the
detected vector at the receiver becomes xid.
The complete process for detection denoted mathematically in (1.4) can
be described as follows.
1.
For each received vector, evaluate dj = |r −Hxj|2, i.e., the squared
Euclidean distance of the received vector as if xj were transmitted.
2.
Among each dj for a received vector, ﬁnd j for which dj is minimum.
3.
Using j obtained in the previous step, identify the corresponding
symbol, xj, as the detected symbol.
From (1.4), it is clear that if xj happens to be the same as the transmitted
symbol, dj is zero under noiseless conditions and dj = |n|2 when the system
is noisy.
By this time, we know the following facts about spatial multiplexing
• All the antennas at transmitter are used to transmit the data streams
in parallel.
• Transmission rate enhances linearly with number of transmitter anten-
nas.
• The diversity order depends only on the number of antennas at the
receiver and independent of antennas at the transmitter (Explanation
to this will be provided in later chapters).

1.3.2
Space time block codes
Spatial multiplexing is known for improving the capacity and the spectral
eﬃciency in the rich scattering environment. However, it does not provide any
diversity gain at the transmitter. The diversity gain of spatial multiplexing
systems depends only on the number of antennas available at the receiver.
In 1998, Alamouti proposed a transmission scheme for MIMO systems to
obtain transmit diversity at the same time as a simple decoding scheme for
MIMO wireless systems [2]. However, it explores spatial and temporal aspects
of diversity schemes and achieves full diversity order. The scheme is known
as space time block coding (STBC). As the name suggests, an appropriate
coding scheme is used at the transmitter to encode the information before
it is transmitted. The coding scheme uses a block of incoming data bits and
transmits it across the transmitting antennas which are separated in space.
Hence, it is named the space time block code (STBC). In STBC systems,
information is transmitted in blocks (say blocks of ‘r′ symbols each, r = Nt)
over time slots (say ‘n′ time slots for one block, n ≥r). An STBC symbol can
be mathematically expressed as
X =

where sij is one of the symbols or its transformed version. The transformation
here may be negation, complex conjugate or negation of complex conjugate
according to the designed code.
Based on the number of symbols per block and time slots over which the
block is transmitted, the code rate is deﬁned as the ratio, Rc = r/n. The
maximum code rate that can be achieved in STBC systems is 1, i.e., it does
not achieve a gain in spectral eﬃciency. An STBC system that can achieve
maximum code rate is known as full rate STBC system. However, this scheme
is more interesting as far as diversity order and the receiver complexity are
taken into consideration.
To understand the STBC transmission scheme, let’s start with Alamouti
STBC scheme for 2 × 1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. In this
case, the channel matrix becomes a row vector and may be considered as h =
 h11

. Two transmit antennas are available. They transmit digitally
modulated symbols simultaneously. Two symbols are transmitted in two time
slots that makes the Alamouti scheme a full rate STBC system. Let two
consecutive digitally modulated symbols from the incoming data bits at any
time be s1 and s2. These symbols are transmitted as x1 =

in ﬁrst and second time slots respectively. So, in general, when s1 and

The signal received in respective time slots of the transmission, r1 and r2,
may be represented as
r1 = h11s1 + h12s2 + n1
(1.6)
r2 = −h11s∗
2 + h12s∗
1 + n2
(1.7)
To recover the transmitted symbols, it is assumed that the channel state
information is available at the receiver. For detection of s1 and s2, the following
computations are done.
bs1 = h∗

(1.8)
bs2 = −h11r∗

(1.11)
The above expressions draw a very nice observation. The observations can
be summarized as follows.
• After two time slots of transmission, s1 and s2 can be detected sepa-
rately.
• s1 and s2 can be detected using the operations that involve only scalar
multiplications and additions of complex numbers. This simpliﬁes the
detection process.
• The existence of the term
 ∥h11 ∥2 + ∥h12 ∥2
indicate that there
is advantage of transmit diversity, i.e., the higher value of either of
∥h11 ∥2 or ∥h12 ∥2 would result in lower probability of erroneous
detection of s1 and s2.
Two receiving antennas
Again, we consider the Alamouti STBC scheme for 2 × 2 MIMO system.
In this case, the channel matrix becomes H =

row corresponds to the links from transmitter antennas to the ﬁrst receiving
antenna and second row corresponds to the links from transmitter antennas
to the second receiving antenna. The signals received by the ﬁrst antenna in
respective time slots of the transmission, r11 and r12, may be represented as
r11 = h11s1 + h12s2 + n11
(1.12)
r12 = −h11s∗
2 + h12s∗

(1.13)
and the signals received by the second antenna in respective time slots of the

r21 = h21s1 + h22s2 + n21
(1.14)
r22 = −h21s∗
2 + h22s∗

(1.15)
For detection of s1 and s2, after applying the method discussed for the
single receiver antenna separately on the signals received on the ﬁrst and
second receiver antenna, we have
bs11 =

From the above expressions, s1 and s2 can be detected as follows.

. This means among four channels
any single link being strong reduces the probability of error in the detection at
the receiver. Thus, the system is observed to oﬀer full diversity order of NtNr
which is 4 in the present system under consideration. In the examples pre-
sented here, we considered two transmit antennas, which is the requirement
for Alamouti STBC. However, many other space time codes use a diﬀerent
number of antennas at the transmitter.

16
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
So, the key points about STBC can be summarized as follows.
• STBC scheme achieves full diversity order.
• STBC does not achieve gain in terms of spectral eﬃciency.
• The detection process for STBC symbols is computationally simple as
it involves only scalar operations on complex numbers.
1.3.3
Spatial modulation
Unlike spatial multiplexing and STBC, in spatial modulation (SM), the in-
formation is not transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas at the
transmitter. This simpliﬁes the hardware and also rectiﬁes the problems like
inter antenna interference and transmit antenna synchronization.
Moreover, in SM, all the information bits are not transmitted physically. A
part of information bit sequence is mapped to transmit antenna indices (spa-
tial constellation) and the antenna corresponding to mapped index is used to
transmit information bits mapped to signal constellation. A system model for
SM MIMO is given in Figure 1.6. This SM MIMO system model considers
an Nt × Nr MIMO system having Nt antennas at transmitter side and Nr
antennas at the receiver side. For M-ary modulation scheme, each block of
log2(Nt)+log2(M) bits of information is mapped by the SM mapper to signal
constellation and spatial constellations. log2(Nt) bits of each block are mapped
to points in spatial constellations which select the antenna and log2(M) bits
are mapped in the signal constellation and modulated by symbol modulator
using a suitable digital modulation scheme. The digitally modulated signal
constellation point is then transmitted from the antenna to which the spa-
tial constellation point is mapped. Thus, using SM, we eﬀectively get spectral
eﬃciency gain of log2(Nt) bits/s/Hz without costing any extra bandwidth
or power. Only one antenna depending on the incoming data bits is active
at a time overcoming the problems of inter channel interference and the re-
quirement of inter antenna synchronization. These are advantages of SM over
(Vertical-Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) V-BLAST and MIMO or-
thogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. At the receiver,
transmit antenna index and transmitted symbol are estimated separately in
suboptimal scheme [76, 77]. SM de-mapper appends the estimated transmit
antenna and detected symbol accordingly to regenerate the transmitted in-
formation bits. Table 1.1 shows how the bits are mapped in spatial domain
and the signal domain for spectral eﬃciency of 3 bits/s/Hz using BPSK and
4QAM schemes with 4 and 2 transmitter antennas respectively. The transmit-
ted vector will have all zero elements except the one which will transmit the
digitally modulated data bits as shown below.

Sub-optimal detection
At receiver, overall detection needs two processes: one for transmit antenna
index estimation and the other for estimation of transmitted symbol. Using
ML criteria, antenna index can be estimated as [53]
ˆj = arg max
j
|hH
j y|
(1.23)
where ˆj is the estimated transmit antenna index, hj is the jth column of chan-
nel matrix H and y is the received signal vector. In the above equation, (·)H
denotes complex conjugate transpose. Detection of the transmitted symbol is
the same as the detection process for the MRC diversity technique. It can be
done using the ML rule given by
xˆq = arg min
q
∥hbj xq ∥2 −2Re{hH
j yx∗
q}
(1.24)
where xˆq is the detected symbol from signal constellation space and xq is the
transmitted symbol. The error in any of the detection processes aﬀects SER
performance of the SM system.
Optimal detection
In optimal detection, the antenna index and digitally modulated symbol are
detected jointly. It is also known as joint detection. This technique is opti-
mal in terms of BER performance. It is joint ML detection scheme [53]. The
optimality is achieved at the cost of computational complexity. The optimal
detection rule using ML detection may be given by [53]

There have been other detection methods proposed by researchers across
the globe. However, in this book we emphasize mainly the suboptimal and
optimal methods of detection for their simplicity. Readers interested to know
about other methods of detection may follow [65, 144, 145] and references
therein.
So, to compare the systems we discussed until now (spatial multi-
plexing, STBC and SM), we consider spectral eﬃciency and diversity
order of each system.
Spatial multiplexing: It transmits parallel data streams from all
available antennas at the transmitter. So, gain in the spectral eﬃciency
is linearly related to number of transmit antennas, Nt, and the diversity
order is the same as number of receiver antennas, Nr.
STBC: Recalling the discussions on STBC transmission, a symbol
is transmitted over multiple time slots and hence there is no gain in
spectral eﬃciency while these systems achieve full diversity order, i.e.,
NtNr.
SM: SM systems achieve gain of log2(Nt) in the spectral eﬃciency
while the diversity order remains the same as that in spatial multiplex-
ing Nr.
This comparison is summarized in Table 1.2.
In the above comparison, we did not discuss about the hardware com-
plexity and the computational complexity. Let’s take the case of spatial mul-
tiplexing and STBC. In both these schemes, all available antennas at the
transmitter are used to transmit a symbol all the time. So, each antenna re-
quires separate radio frequency (RF) chain. This makes the system bulky.
While in SM, single antenna is transmitting a symbol at a time. This requires
single RF chain. Thus, SM hardware is simple and less bulky. This is desir-
able for mobile devices. Coming to computational complexity, we have already
shown that STBC detection is simpler because of the separation of symbols

20
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
transmitted during multiple time slots. If we look at the detection process of
spatial multiplexing, the required computations increase exponentially with
increasing number of antennas and/or the order of modulation scheme. The
computational complexity of SM also has an exponential relation to the num-
ber of antennas and/or the order of modulation scheme. But the advantage
of SM is that it requires vector operations while spatial multiplexing involves
matrix operations. Thus, SM has less computational complexity in detection
of symbols at the receiver.
1.4
Closed loop MIMO systems
The kinds of MIMO systems we already discussed use diﬀerent strategies at
the transmitter but they do not require the information about channel condi-
tions at the transmitter. The closed loop MIMO systems, on the other hand,
use diﬀerent transmission strategies at the transmitter using the information
about channel conditions, i.e., channel state information (CSI) is required
at the transmitter. In general, the information about channel state is esti-
mated at the receiver using a pilot sequence. Pilot sequence is a sequence of
data bits which is already known at the receiver. Transmitter transmits this
data sequence and the CSI is estimated at the receiver based on the already
known sequence. This is known as pilot based channel estimation. But this
makes CSI available only at the receiver. In closed loop MIMO systems, CSI
is also required at the transmitter. This needs a feedback link from receiver
to transmitter so that the information regarding channel conditions estimated
at the receiver may be conveyed to the transmitter. Once CSI is available at
the transmitter, it is used to choose suitable transmission strategy. Diﬀerent
transmission strategies are discussed as we proceed further in this section.
1.4.1
Power allocation
Now, we are considering closed loop MIMO systems. So, now onward, it is
assumed that the transmitter knows CSI completely. Power allocation strat-
egy extracts the information that which channels are good and which are not,
and accordingly, power is allocated to the channels. Transmission through
good channels is done with high power to get the most beneﬁts from them.
No transmission or very less power is allocated to the channels in bad con-
dition. In this way, the overall capacity of the system is maximized so that
the spectral eﬃciency is improved. This strategy is also referred to as water
ﬁlling algorithm in MIMO communications. This method uses the concept of
singular value decomposition (SVD) to convert the MIMO channels into par-
allel SISO channels, the number of parallel SISO channels being equal to the
rank (RH) of channel matrix, H. As we have discussed in the earlier sections,
when a set of symbols is transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas

Introduction to MIMO Systems
21
FIGURE 1.7
MIMO systems before and after power allocation.
at the transmitter, these symbols being transmitted at the same frequency
interfere with each other. As a result, the signal received at each receiver
antenna is a linear combination of these transmitted symbols. Thus, detect-
ing the actual symbols transmitted from these interfered signals is a complex
process. It demands high computational complexity. In this section, we will
see that SVD can be helpful in actually getting rid of the interference among
the symbols that are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas at
the transmitter. After applying SVD and further processing, the conventional
MIMO system becomes similar to collection of non-interfering SISO systems
as shown in Figure 1.7. SVD is helpful not only in decomposing the interfering
paths into parallel non-interfering channels but also it helps to identify the
quality of those parallel channels. Based on the quality of channels, the power
is allocated such that maximum data rate can be achieved.
The analysis that follows is available with diﬀerent ﬂavors in [94] and [52].
According to SVD, any matrix can be decomposed as a product of a unitary
matrix, a diagonal matrix and another unitary matrix. In the case of MIMO
systems, the channel matrix, H, of dimensions Nr × Nt is factorized using
SVD as follows.
H = UΣVH
(1.26)
where U is a unitary matrix of dimension Nr × Nr, Σ is a diagonal matrix of
dimension Nr × Nt and V is another unitary matrix of dimension Nt × Nt. It
should be noted here that the diagonal elements of Σ are the singular values
of the channel matrix H which are square roots of the eigenvalues. So, the
number of non-zero diagonal elements cannot exceed the rank of the channel
matrix, H, as the number of non-zero eigenvalues is the rank of the matrix.

22
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
At transmitter, instead of transmitting the symbol vector x directly it is
ﬁrst multiplied with the unitary matrix V that is obtained as a result of fac-
torization of H using SVD. So, using (1.2) the received vector can be given by
r = HVx + n
(1.27)
Now, in the above expression, representing the channel matrix as the SVD
form as in equation (1.26), the received vector can be given by
r = UΣVHVx + n
(1.28)
Using the property of unitary matrices that VHV = I, the above expression
can be further simpliﬁed as
r = UΣx + n
(1.29)
Then, some transformation is done at the receiver. It is the multiplication
of the received vector given in the above expression by UH. This results in
the following simpliﬁed expressions.
y = UHr
(1.30)
y = UHUΣx + UHn
(1.31)
y = Σx + UHn
(1.32)
where y is the vector obtained after transformation of received vector. Now,
from equation (1.32), it is clear that all the transformations at the transmitter
and receiver remove all the interferences that may happen in MIMO channels
even if the antennas available at transmitter are simultaneously involved in
transmission. This is because of the fact that the signal part in the ﬁnal
expression of y contains the product of symbol vector that is transmitted and
the diagonal matrix obtained after SVD of H. So, each element of the vector
y can be represented as follows.
yi =
p
λixi +
h
UHn
i
i
(1.33)
where yi is the ith element of vector y, √λi is the ith largest singular value of
H, xi is the ith element of x and
h
UHn
i
i is the ith element of vector UHn.
So, signal part in each element, yi, is the product of a singular value of H and
one symbol from the vector x. And the noise part is
h
UHn
i
i.
Now, since the MIMO channels have been virtually decomposed as paral-
lel SISO channels through the process of transformations at transmitter and
receiver, the total channel capacity can be given as the sum of the individual
channel capacity of the decomposed SISO channels. The channel capacity for
Nt = Nr full rank MIMO channels can be given by the following expression.

Introduction to MIMO Systems
23
C =
Nr
X
i=0
log2 (1 + γi)
(1.34)
where C is the channel capacity and γi =
λiExi
N0
is the SNR of the ith branch
in the decomposed SISO channels, with Exi being the energy of the symbol
transmitted through ith branch/subchannel and N0 as the noise power spectral
density for the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN).
In such conditions, the channel capacity can be maximized by allocat-
ing unequal power to diﬀerent branches/subchannels with a constraint that
PNr
i=0 Exi = Et. This constraint is to ensure that the same energy is used on
every instant of transmission. This maximization problem can be mathemat-
ically represented using the expression that follows:
Cmax =
max
PNr
i=0 Exi=Et
Nr
X
i=0
log2 (1 + γi)
(1.35)
Solving the above maximization problem gives the power allocation strat-
egy that must be followed to achieve the maximum capacity when the channel
is known at the transmitter.
So, to summarize the power allocation strategy:
• Using SVD of the channel matrix both at the transmitter and the re-
ceiver, it is made possible to decompose the interfering MIMO channels
into parallel and non-interfering SISO channels.
• The overall capacity of MIMO channel for such systems can be given
as the sum of capacity of individual SISO channels obtained after de-
composing the MIMO channels.
• Solving the optimization problem for power allocation as given by the
expression of equation (1.35), the capacity can be maximized.
1.4.2
Transmit antenna selection
Transmit antenna selection (TAS) is another strategy that can be followed at
the transmitter. In TAS, only one antenna is selected at the transmitter to
transmit the information. So, the advantage of MIMO systems that there is
parallel transmission of information no longer holds in TAS systems. But TAS
systems have other advantages as compared to MIMO systems which will be
clear after discussions of this section. In these systems, one antenna is selected
at the transmitter based on the channel conditions such that the power of the

useful signal component in the received signal gets maximized. This maximizes
the SNR and hence improves the error performance of the system. Not only the
performance but since the instantaneous SNR is improved, this also improves
the capacity of the system. This allows higher order modulation schemes to be
used with suﬃciently low error rates in the received symbols. Moreover, TAS
systems use a single antenna at a time among all available antennas at the
transmitter. So, it simpliﬁes the hardware at transmitter requiring a single RF
chain for single operating antenna as in the case of SM for open loop MIMO
systems. Again, there are TAS systems that select more than one antenna and
transmit information simultaneously on those selected antennas. But, we are
limiting our discussion to single antenna selection at the transmitter.
Diﬀerent criteria for TAS explored in the literature are received SNR, chan-
nel capacity and Euclidian distance [29,105]. However, channel capacity and
Euclidean distance based antenna selection algorithms are more suitable when
more than one antenna are to be selected. As we have limited our discussion
to single antenna selection, the antenna is selected at the transmitter which
maximizes the received instantaneous SNR at the receiver. However, it does
not require the estimation or complete knowledge of channel state information
at the transmitter. The transmit antenna which maximizes the received SNR
is estimated at the receiver and the information is made available to trans-
mitter through a very low rate feedback link. Diﬀerent diversity combining
techniques can be used at the receiver with TAS of which MRC and SC are

most commonly explored in the literature because of optimality of MRC and
simplicity of SC. The block diagram of the TAS system with spatial diversity
combining at the receiver is shown in Figure 1.8. It consists of a feedback link
from receiver to transmitter so that receiver can send information about the
antenna that maximizes the received instantaneous SNR. According to this
feedback information, the antenna selector connects to corresponding antenna
and sends appropriately modulated data. Note that the antenna selector block
is an RF switch and hence it does not require the complete set of RF chain for
each antenna at the transmitter. To select an antenna at the transmitter, a
set of pilot sequences is transmitted from each transmitter antenna one by one
and for each transmission receiver compares the antenna selection criteria as
per diversity scheme to be implemented and intimates the transmitter about
the antenna maximizing SNR as in Figure 1.9. The size of data in this frame
depends upon the coherence time of the channel. The pilot signals need to be
transmitted for every instant of the channel change so as to guarantee that the
best antenna remains selected all the time. These pilot data are not an over-
head to the actual data to be transmitted. Pilot transmission is required in
any way for channel estimation. The selection of the antenna that maximizes
the instantaneous received SNR can be explained in the following manner.
We already know that the MIMO channel matrix can be given as
H =



· · ·


(1.36)
In this channel matrix, an element of each row of H, say ith row (a row vector),
corresponds to the channel coeﬃcients of the links between ith receiver antenna
and a transmitter antenna. Similarly, an element of jth column of H represents
the channel coeﬃcients of the links between jth transmitter antenna and a
receiver antenna. So, if an antenna is to be selected at the transmitter, the
information of each column vector of the channel matrix H needs to be used.
The antenna selection criterion for both (MRC and SC) combining schemes
are discussed in the following sections.

26
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
1.4.2.1
Selection combining at the receiver
SC is the simplest diversity combining scheme. In SC, only the strongest
received signal among all the received copies is processed further to detect the
information. When SC is used with TAS, only the antennas corresponding to
the link which gives maximum received SNR are activated. The link which
gives the highest received SNR is determined by
ISC = arg max
1≤i≤Nt
1≤j≤Nr
{γj,i}
(1.37)
where ISC denotes the link which gives maximum instantaneous SNR at the
receiver and γj,i is the instantaneous SNR of the link between ith transmitting
antenna and jth receiver antenna. Only the antennas that correspond to the
best link are made active at a time in this case. We refer to such systems
as (Nt,1;Nr,1) joint transmit and receive antenna selection systems. The ad-
vantage of SC at the receiver is that it requires only one RF chain at the
receiver and hence it is easy to implement. The systems with SC at the re-
ceiver and TAS at the transmitter are further referred to as TAS/SC systems
in this book. In TAS/SC systems, originally there are multiple antennas at
both the transmitter and the receiver which makes it a MIMO system. But,
an eﬀectively single antenna is active at both the transmitter and receiver at
an instant. So, TAS/SC systems are a special kind of MIMO system that is
converted into an SISO system while in operation.
1.4.2.2
MRC at the receiver
In this case, it is assumed that the number of RF chains at receiver is same as
the number of receiver antennas. MRC is used at the receiver. The resulting
received SNR for MRC combining scheme is given by γt = PNr
n=1 γn, where γn
is the instantaneous SNR of the nth branch. The transmitting antenna that
maximizes SNR at the receiver can be determined by
IMRC = arg max
1≤i≤Nt


γt,i =
Nr
X
j=1
γj,i



(1.38)
where γt,i denote total received instantaneous SNR when ith transmitting an-
tenna is selected and IMRC denotes antenna index which corresponds to the
transmitting antenna that maximizes the received SNR. We refer to such sys-
tems as (Nt,1;Nr) TAS/MRC systems. MRC requires as many RF chains at
the receiver as the number of receiving antennas. With this hardware complex-
ity, it promises optimum performance in terms of probability of error among all
the diversity combining schemes. As TAS/SC systems are the form of MIMO
systems that are converted into SISO systems while in operation, similarly,
TAS/MRC systems are the form of MIMO systems that are converted into
SIMO systems while in operation. In both the cases, TAS/SC and TAS/MRC,

Introduction to MIMO Systems
27
a single antenna is engaged in transmission at a time. This has inherent ad-
vantage that the system does not have any self-interference, unlike the case
of systems which use multiple antennas simultaneously for transmission of
information.
The features of TAS can be summarized as follows.
• For single antenna selection systems, transmitter needs to have a single
RF chain which makes the hardware simple.
• TAS does not involve any inter antenna interference as single antenna
is transmitting at an instant. So, detection at the receiver is computa-
tionally simple.
• TAS with SC at the receiver can further simplify the hardware, as in
SC receiver also requires single RF chain.
• TAS systems do not require complete CSI to be conveyed to the trans-
mitter. It only requires the information about the best antenna. This
can be fulﬁlled by a very low rate feedback link which is not very dif-
ﬁcult to implement.
• TAS systems can achieve full diversity order as in STBC. This will be
discussed in detail in coming chapters.
1.4.3
Transmit antenna selection based spatial modulation
We already discussed the techniques of TAS and SM separately in Section
1.4.2 and in Section 1.3.3 respectively. Basically, TAS is a kind of closed loop
MIMO system and SM is a kind of open loop MIMO system. In this section,
we are deﬁning a new kind of MIMO system which is a combination of both
the TAS and SM. These are named as transmit antenna selection based spatial
modulation (TAS-SM) [139]. This gets advantage of both the TAS in terms
of diversity order and SM in terms of spectral eﬃciency. Again, at times it
happens that one particular channel is highly faded and if SM is used for
transmission, a large amount of data gets lost or erroneously detected at the
receiver. In such situations, TAS-SM can be better option in which only the
best/usable channels are in use after antenna selection [60,99,105]. Now, unlike
in SM where we select an antenna for transmission based on the sequence of
incoming bits, in TAS-SM, ﬁrst some antennas are selected, say Ns based
on some antenna selection algorithms and then use SM on the selected Ns
antennas. Again, unlike in TAS, that we have considered in Section 1.4.2,
more than one antenna is required to be selected at the transmitter in TAS-
SM MIMO systems.

Introduction
A signal passing through wireless media undergoes various physical phenom-
ena due to presence of diﬀerent kinds of objects in the vicinity. These objects
in the outdoor mainly consist of mobile and immobile obstacles of diﬀerent
physical properties. Various signal parameters like phase and amplitude get
modiﬁed after incidence on such obstacles depending on the nature and size
of the obstacle and the frequency of the signal. As a result the received signal
is a collection of multiple components generated due to various processes like
reﬂection, diﬀraction, scattering, etc. This results in momentary change in
the received signal amplitude and power levels. These changes in the received
power level become more severe for the situation in which transmitter and/or
receiver and/or the surrounding objects are moving. Moreover, the nature of
surrounding objects also aﬀects the ﬂuctuation in the received power level sig-
niﬁcantly. This variation is random in nature and can be modeled via various
probabilistic distributions that may vary depending on the situation. Such
variation in the received power over time and position is known as fading.
The exact analysis of such variations is very diﬃcult and even impossible in
many cases. However, statistical modeling of received power or amplitude via
various distributions can be used to simplify the analysis. The statistical mod-
eling may vary depending on the nature of fading. Fading can be classiﬁed as
frequency ﬂat fading and frequency selective fading in the frequency domain.
The statistical modeling for both kinds of fading is diﬀerent. In this book, we
would limit the discussion only to frequency ﬂat fading.
Further, in this chapter, we will introduce diﬀerent types of fading in brief.
The types of fading and their relation with the rate of change of channel char-
acteristics will be discussed concisely. It will be followed by discussion on
some commonly known statistical models for fading distributions with their
applicability over various wireless environments. Finally, we will discuss about
generalized fading distributions. It includes details of the physical models that
may be considered and modeled, and various statistical properties that may
be useful in the analysis of wireless communication systems. Special cases of
the generalized fading distributions will also be provided. This chapter also
deals with the methods to generate fading channel coeﬃcients that follow gen-
eralized fading distributions. These channel coeﬃcients are especially useful
while simulating wireless communication systems.

Generalized Fading Channels
31
2.2
Introduction to fading channels
The fading characteristics depend mainly on the channel conditions. The two
parameters that are used to classify the fading channels are coherence band-
width and coherence time of the channel. Coherence time and coherence band-
width are dependent on the Doppler shift and the delay spread respectively
of the multipath components. It is well known that Doppler shift occurs when
there is relative motion between transmitter and receiver while communicat-
ing. While moving, the transmitter and the receiver might be coming closer
or going farther apart from each other. Accordingly, the Doppler shift might
be positive or negative. This virtually increases or decreases the frequency of
the signal. The relation between Doppler spread and coherence time can be
given as
Tc ≈1
fd
(2.1)
where Tc is the coherence time of the channel and fd is the maximum Doppler
spread. In general, coherence time is deﬁned as the period of time for which
the impulse response of the channel remains unchanged.
Coherence bandwidth is the other characteristic of fading channels. It can
be deﬁned as the band of frequencies over which the frequency response of the
channel is constant or ﬂat. Coherence bandwidth of the channel is related to
the maximum delay spread of the multipath components. The relation can be
given as follows.
fc ≈1
τd
(2.2)
where fc is the coherence bandwidth and τd is the maximum delay spread.
2.2.1
Fast and slow fading
The channels are classiﬁed as fast fading channels or slow fading channels
depending on the coherence time of the channel and the symbol duration of
the signal. If the symbol duration is smaller than the coherence time, the
channel is classiﬁed as slow fading channel. Otherwise, it falls in the category
of fast fading channel. If the rate of change of impulse response of the channel
is faster than the symbol duration then the channel is fast fading channel.
2.2.2
Frequency ﬂat and frequency selective fading
The channel is classiﬁed as ﬂat fading channel if the coherence bandwidth of
the channel is greater than the signal bandwidth. In such types of channels, all
the frequency components of the signal are aﬀected equally. The eﬀect may

32
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
be of attenuation or phase variation. In case the signal bandwidth exceeds
the coherence bandwidth, diﬀerent frequency components of the signal would
be aﬀected diﬀerently while passing through the channel. Such channels are
known as frequency selective fading channels.
2.3
Commonly used fading distributions
Considering a single-input single-output (SISO) system, the received symbol
under the slow and frequency ﬂat fading conditions can be given by
r = hs + n
(2.3)
where r is the received signal, h is the channel coeﬃcient due to fading, s is
the transmitted symbol and n is the noise. In this book we consider the noise
to be additive white gaussian noise (AWGN). The noise is assumed to have
one sided power spectral density of N0 and independent of both the symbols
and the fading amplitudes. In the above expression, the eﬀect of fading is
ascertained by h. h is a complex coeﬃcient representing the phase and am-
plitude alterations in the signal due to fading. The amplitude represents the
attenuation in the signal while it traverses from transmitter to receiver. While
modeling fading by statistical distributions, distribution of phase and ampli-
tude of the received signal needs to be considered. In most of the processes,
phase can be assumed to be uniformly distributed and it is assumed that there
is perfect phase estimation at the receiver. However, when the communication
systems perform maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver, phase shifts
of diﬀerent components of the received signal actually vanish as MRC itself
involves the step of phase cancelation or co-phasing of all the received signals
at diﬀerent antennas. Eventually, the phase shift is canceled assuming per-
fect phase estimation. Similarly, in selection combining (SC) the phase shift
of diﬀerent components is canceled at the receiver while detection. But, there
are cases where the phase shifts of diﬀerent components need to be consid-
ered separately in addition to amplitude of the received signal. Apart from
phase and amplitude of the received signal, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an
important parameter which also needs the statistical modeling. Average SNR
is the independent variable in most of the performance metrics for wireless
communication systems. Once the distribution of amplitude is modeled, it is
easy to obtain the statistical properties of the SNR. SNR and amplitude are
related in a similar manner as the relation of amplitude and power. So, the
methods of random variable transformation can be applied to ﬁnd the distri-
bution of SNR from the distribution of amplitude. Now, we will brieﬂy discuss
some commonly used fading distributions. The detailed description of these
descriptions can also be found in [45,101,107,116,118].

Generalized Fading Channels
33
2.3.1
Rayleigh fading
The fading can be modeled as Rayleigh distributed when there is no line of
sight (LOS) component present in the received signal. LOS signal may also be
characterized by a component that contains considerably higher power than
collective power of all the remaining components. The probability density
function (PDF) of the fading amplitude can be given by [44,116,118]
pX(x) = 2x
Ωe−x2
Ω,
x ≥0
(2.4)
where Ω= E(X2) is known as fading power.
When the amplitude is Rayleigh distributed, instantaneous SNR follows
exponential distribution. It can be given by
pγ(γ) = 1
γ e−γ
γ ,
γ ≥0
(2.5)
where γ is the instantaneous SNR and γ is the average SNR.
2.3.2
Hoyt fading
Hoyt distribution is used to model the fading channels when it is more severe
than the Rayleigh fading conditions. It is also known as Nakagami-q fading.
The PDF of Hoyt/Nakagami-q faded amplitude can be given by [83,92,116]
pX(x) = 1 + q2
Ω
xe−(1+q2)2x2
4q2Ω
I0
1 −q4
4q2Ωx2

,
x ≥0
(2.6)
where q is the fading parameter for Hoyt distribution and Iν is the Bessel
function of ﬁrst kind and νth order. In the present case, ν = 0, i.e., Hoyt
distribution involves Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and order 0. The value
of q ranges from 0 to 1.
Using the distribution of Hoyt faded amplitude and methods of transfor-
mation of random variables, the PDF of Hoyt faded instantaneous SNR can
be obtained as
pγ(γ) = 1 + q2
2qγ e−(1+q2)2γ
4q2γ
I0
1 −q4
4q2γ γ

,
γ ≥0
(2.7)
The value of fading parameter, q shows the severity level of fading. q = 0
represents the highest severity that can be modeled by Hoyt distribution and
q = 1 represents the lowest. It shall be noted that q = 1 is the special case
of Hoyt fading which is equivalent to Rayleigh fading and q = 0 is the special
case which is equivalent to one sided Gaussian fading.

34

2.3.3
Rician fading
Earlier two models were suitable for modeling the fading distributions in a
non-LOS environment. Rician fading is more suitable for the LOS scenario
where the collection of multipath components contains a dominant component
that has high strength as compared to other components. Rice distribution
is also known as Nakagami-n distribution [109]. The PDF of Rice-distributed
amplitude can be given by
pX(x) = 2 (1 + K)
Ω
xe−K−(1+K)x2
Ω
I0
 
2x
r
K(1 + K)
Ω
!
,
x ≥0 (2.8)
where K is the Rice K factor. It is the fading parameter of Rice distribution.
Rice distribution and Nakagami-n distributed diﬀer only in the deﬁnition of
distribution parameters, K and n. They are related as K = n2. K is de-
ﬁned as the ratio of power of the dominant component to the total power
of the scattered components. Its value ranges from 0 to ∞depending on the
environmental conditions.
The PDF of the SNR for which the amplitude is modeled as Rician dis-
tributed can be given by
pγ(γ) = (1 + K)
γ
e−K−(1+K)γ
γ
I0
 
2
s
K(1 + K)γ
γ
!
,
γ ≥0
(2.9)
The range of values of Rician fading parameter K which can model the channel
conditions varies from no fading (K = ∞) to Rayleigh fading (K = 0). So,
Rician distribution can be used to model the fading scenarios when there is
LOS and less severity level of fading.
2.4
Generalized fading distributions
In the previous section, we discussed about some commonly used distributions
to model fading statistics of the received signal. As indicated by the title of
this book, our focus is to discuss generalized fading distributions in detail. In
this section, we will make the readers familiar with various distributions that
can be used to model fading in a generalized scenario. These distributions are
categorized as generalized fading distributions because these are parametric
distributions and varying the values of parameters can model a large range of
fading environments. However, many commonly used fading distributions are
also parametric and can model a range of fading environments but generalized
fading distributions are capable of modeling a much wider range of scenar-
ios. This also includes the non-homogeneous fading environment in which the
reﬂecting surfaces and scatterers posses diﬀerent properties. As a result, the

Generalized Fading Channels
35
delay spread may be very large and the received signal needs to be assumed
as a collection of clusters of multipath components. Next, we discuss various
generalized fading distributions.
2.4.1
Nakagami-m fading
Nakagami-m distribution is used to model fading scenario in various conditions
(mostly in a non-LOS environment). It is widely explored by the researchers
because of the simplicity of analysis. Nakagami-m distribution is also com-
monly used to model the fading statistics of the received signal but it can
model fading under generalized conditions up to a certain level. So, in this
book, we classiﬁed Nakagami-m fading also as a generalized fading model.
2.4.1.1
Physical model
In this part of the discussion, we aim to describe the physical realization
of Nakagami-m distribution. It is essential to understand the actual physi-
cal modeling of wireless channels and to get an idea about the applicabil-
ity of Nakagami-m distribution in statistical modeling of fading channels. In
Nakagami-m fading model the received signal is modeled as a collection of
clusters. Each cluster has a number of scattered multipath components. The
delay spread of diﬀerent clusters is relatively larger than the delay spread of
multipath components within a cluster. Every cluster is assumed to have the
same power. In such a model, the envelope X of the fading signal can be
represented as
X2 =
n
X
i=0
 I2
i + Q2
i

(2.10)
where n is the number of clusters in the received signal, and Ii and Qi are
respectively the in-phase and quadrature phase component of the resultant sig-
nal of the ith cluster. Note that Ii and Qi are mutually independent random
processes with zero mean and equal variance. Both Ii and Qi, being resul-
tant of multipath components of a cluster, may be assumed to be Gaussian
distributed with E(Ii) = E(Qi) = 0 and E(I2
i ) = E(Q2
i ) = σ2.
So, the fading amplitude can be expressed as X2 = Pn
i=0
 R2
i

with R2
i =
I2
i + Q2
i . From the fact that Ii and Qi are Gaussian distributed, it is to be
noted here that each R2
i is exponentially distributed. As far as distributions
of SNR are concerned, it is the same as the square of amplitude distribution.
So, it is valid to say that the PDF of X2 is the same as that of SNR. The SNR
in this case is the sum of mutually independent Gamma distributed random
variables. The PDF of SNR follows Gamma distribution and can be given as
pγ(γ) = mmγm−1

Next, we will see diﬀerent functions that are useful in performance evaluation
of wireless communication systems.
2.4.1.2
CDF and MGF of Nakagami-m fading
Cumulative distribution function (CDF) and moment generating function
(MGF) are two properties of random variables which are most essential in
evaluating the performance metrics of a wireless communication system. In
the following sections of this chapter, we will discuss the metrics and methods
for evaluation of the metrics which are used as performance analysis tools for
wireless communication systems.

2.4.1.3
Special cases
If we observe equation (2.10), it is clear that a Nakagami-m faded signal is
composed of various Gaussian distributed random variables. The parameter
m is deﬁned such that its diﬀerent values can model diﬀerent fading environ-
ments. If we consider one cluster, the situation corresponds to m = 1 and the
signal described by equation (2.10) can be represented as
X =
p
I2 + Q2
(2.19)
with I and Q being Gaussian distributed with zero mean and equal variance.
This is by deﬁnition a Rayleigh distributed random variable. Thus, m = 1 in
Nakagami-m fading model represents the special case which is equivalent to
Rayleigh fading.
Another case is m =
1
2. This means half a cluster which is physically
not possible. But it can be described taking into consideration the previous
case in which m = 1 represents the square root sum of two squared Gaussian
distributed random variables. So, in the case of m = 1
2, it can be thought of as
the single Gaussian distributed random variable. Since the PDF of Nakagami-
m distribution is restricted only to positive values, this case represents one
sided Gaussian fading.
As a generalized fading model, Nakagami-m distribution can also model
Hoyt (Nakagami-q) and Rice (Nakagami-n) distributions as explained in
[89, 116]. If we revisit the discussion about Hoyt fading in Section 2.3.2, it
can model the fading environments ranging between severe fading as high as
one sided Gaussian to moderately severe as Rayleigh fading. Nakagami-m dis-
tribution includes these two cases in the range m = 1
2 to m = 1; thus, the
range of values q = 0 to q = 1 of fading parameter, q, in the case of Hoyt
fading maps to the range of values m = 1
2 to m = 1 of the fading parameter,
m, in the case of Nakagami-m fading model. The relation for approximation
between these parameters for representation of Hoyt fading as a special case
of Nakagami-m fading can be given by
m =
 1 + q22
2 (1 + 2q4).
(2.20)
Proceeding in the same manner, revisiting the discussion about Rician
fading in Section 2.3.3, the cases of severity that can be modeled by Rician
distribution range from Rayleigh fading (K = 0) at one extreme to less severe
fading like static channels with no fading (K = ∞). Nakagami-m distribution
includes these two cases in the range m = 1 to m = ∞; thus, the range
of values K = 0 to K = ∞of fading parameter, K, in the case of Rician
fading maps to the range of values m = 1 to m = ∞of the fading parameter,
m, in the case of Nakagami-m fading model. The relation for approximation
between these parameters for representation of Rician fading as a special case

η −µ fading
The proposal of η −µ fading was laid down by M. D. Yacoub in [132] as a
generalized distribution to model diﬀerent fading environments. η −µ distri-
bution is also suitable to model non-LOS environments. After the proposal
as a generalized fading distribution, η −µ fading distribution is popularly be-
ing used by many researchers for analysis of wireless communication systems.
Like Nakagami-m fading, η −µ distribution also models a generalized fading

2.4.2.1
Physical model
Similar to Nakagami-m fading model, it is assumed that the multi-path com-
ponents in the received signal are in the form of clusters and the clusters
do not have any dominating or LOS component in η −µ distribution. Each
cluster has a number of scattered multipath components. The delay spread of
diﬀerent clusters is relatively larger than the delay spread of multipath com-
ponents within a cluster. Every cluster is assumed to have the same average
power. However, the parameter η makes it diﬀerent from Nakagami-m fading.
η is deﬁned as the ratio of power of the in-phase component to power of the
quadrature phase component of the received signals. In such a model, the
envelope X of the fading signal can be represented in the same way as that
in Nakagami-m fading with diﬀerent statistical parameters as described later,
i.e.,
X2 =
n
X
i=0
 I2
i + Q2
i

(2.22)
where n is the number of clusters in the received signal, Ii and Qi are respec-
tively the in-phase and quadrature phase component of the resultant signal
of the ith cluster. Both Ii and Qi, being resultant of multipath components
of a cluster, may be assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean, i.e.,
E(Ii) = E(Qi) = 0. In η −µ fading, the variation from Nakagami-m fading
is that the variance which is the same as the power content of Ii and Qi is
diﬀerent. E(I2
i ) = σ2
Ii and E(Q2
i ) = σ2

Again, as in the case of Nakagami-m fading model, the fading amplitude
can be expressed as X2 = Pn

with R2

and Qi are Gaussian distributed but with diﬀerent variance, it is to be noted
here that R2

account of discrete values of n. To make the parameter, µ, to take continuous
values, it is alternatively deﬁned as µ =

, V (·) denotes the
variance operator, and H and h are the functions of fading parameter η which
is the fading parameter deﬁned in two ways and thus there are two formats
for η −µ fading channels.
η −µ fading: Format 1
In this format, the in-phase component and quadrature phase component of
the resultant signal in each cluster are assumed to be independent and with
diﬀerent powers. η is deﬁned as the ratio of power of the in-phase component
to the power of quadrature component, i.e., η =
σ2
Ii
σ2
Qi . It is also assumed that
this ratio is constant for all the clusters in the received signal. In this case,
the values of η range between 0 and ∞, and H and h, the functions of η, are
deﬁned as H = η−1−η
4
and h = 2+η−1+η
4
respectively. It can be shown that
the values of h and H are symmetrical around η = 1, i.e., the values of H
and h for 0 < η ≤1 are the same for the range 1 ≤η < ∞. This means the
statistical property of amplitude of the received signal remains unchanged for
both these ranges of η. Therefore, it suﬃces to consider either 0 < η ≤1 or
1 ≤η < ∞. In this format, the ratio H
h simpliﬁes to 1−η
1+η .
η −µ fading: Format 2
In this format, the in-phase component and quadrature phase component of
the envelope of the resultant signal in each cluster are assumed to be correlated
and with equal powers. In this case, η is deﬁned as the correlation coeﬃcient
between the in-phase component and the quadrature component, i.e., η =
E(Ii,Qi)
E(I2
i )
or η =
E(Ii,Qi)
E(Q2
i) . It is also assumed that the correlation coeﬃcient
between the in-phase component and the quadrature component is the same
for all the clusters in the received signal. In this case, the values of η range
between −1 and <1; and H and h, the functions of η are deﬁned as H =
η
1−η2
and h =
1
1−η2 . It can be shown that the values of h and H are symmetrical
around η = 0. Therefore, it suﬃces to consider either 0 ≤η < 1 or −1 < η ≤0.
In this format, the ratio H
h simpliﬁes to η.

Relation between format 1 and format 2
Physically, both the formats are diﬀerent but the distributions of format 1
and format 2 match with each other for certain values of fading parameters.
The parameter µ is deﬁned in the same way for both the formats. So, to
relate format 1 and format 2, the relation between η of format 1 and format 2
(though deﬁned diﬀerently) needs to be established. This relation can be given
as follows [30] by equating the ratio H
h of both formats discussed earlier.

η −µ fading: PDF of SNR
As far as distributions are concerned, SNR is the same as the square of am-
plitude distribution. So, it is valid to say that the PDF of X2 is the same as
that of SNR. The PDF of η −µ distributed instantaneous SNR can be given
as [34,132,136]

Next, we will see diﬀerent functions that are useful in performance evalu-

CDF and MGF of η −µ fading
CDF and MGF are two statistical functions of random variables (instanta-
neous SNR in our case) which are most essential in evaluating the performance
metrics of a wireless communication system. In the following sections of this
chapter, we will discuss the metrics and methods for evaluation of the met-
rics which are used as performance analysis tools for wireless communication
systems.

SNR, the readers may refer to Appendices A.8 and A.9.
2.4.2.4
Special cases
Diﬀerent values of fading parameters, η and µ, can represent diﬀerent fading
distributions. But, certain values of η and µ can model speciﬁc distributions
which are well known and useful in modeling wireless fading channels. Though
the parameter η is deﬁned in two ways for format 1 and format 2, we already
discussed that its value for one format can be transformed to another format
using equation (2.24). So, special cases pertaining to one format can also be
interpreted to another format. However, most special cases can be explained
with format 1 as far as physical models are concerned. To discuss the special
cases, we again refer the reader to the physical model and format 1. Limit the
number of clusters in the received signal to 1 which represents µ = 0.5. Then,
the expression of equation (2.22) reduces to
X =
p
I2 + Q2
(2.32)
where I and Q are Gaussian distributed with zero mean. But, in this case the
variances of I and Q are diﬀerent and the diﬀerence is related by η =
σ2
Ii
σ2
Qi .
With a slight restriction on the value of η, this can match to the deﬁnition
of Rayleigh fading distribution. For the values η = 1 and µ = 0.5, Rayleigh
fading is represented as a special of η −µ fading distribution.
Again, restricting η = 1, another case is µ = 1
4. This means half a cluster
which is physically not possible. But it can be described taking into consid-
eration the previous case in which µ = 0.5 represents square root sum of two
squared Gaussian distributed random variables. So, in the case of µ = 1
4, it
can be thought of as the single Gaussian distributed random variable. Since

the PDF of η −µ distributed random variable is restricted only to positive
values, this case represents one sided Gaussian fading.
Again, we restrict number of clusters to 1, i.e., µ = 0.5. η can take arbitrary
value. In this case, the expression of equation (2.22) reduces to
X =
q
X2
1 + ηX2
2
(2.33)
with X1 and X2 both being Gaussian distributed with zero mean and equal
variance. However, the factor √η as coeﬃcient of X2 manipulates the variance
of the second term, i.e., the variance of √ηX2 as a whole would be diﬀerent
from that of X2. This represents Hoyt fading. So, Hoyt fading can be repre-
sented as a special case of η −µ fading for the values η = q2 and µ = 0.5.
As was already mentioned while discussing the physical model of η −µ
distribution, it diﬀers from Nakagami-m fading model in only one parameter
and that parameter is the variance of in-phase components and quadrature
phase components of resultant of each cluster in the received signal. Otherwise,
the expressions that model the amplitude of received signal in Nakagami-m
fading, expression of equation (2.10), and η −µ fading, expression of equation

(2.22), are exactly the same. So, restricting the value of η to 1, Nakagami-m
fading model can be realized as a special case of η −µ fading distribution with
the parameter, m = 2µ. So, η −µ fading can model Nakagami-m distribution
as a special case. This means that all the special cases of Nakagami-m fading
discussed in Section 2.4.13 can also be modeled using η −µ distribution. This
makes η−µ distribution more widely accepted as generalized distribution than
Nakagami-m fading distribution.
The special cases of Nakagami-m fading distribution discussed above have
been summarized in Table 2.2. The PDFs for some special cases of η −µ
distributed normalized envelope corresponding to values of fading parameters
are plotted and can be observed in Figure 2.2.
2.4.3
κ −µ fading
The proposal of κ −µ fading was laid down by M. D. Yacoub in [133] as
a generalized distribution to model fading environment. Unlike Nakagami-
m and η −µ fading models, κ −µ distribution is suitable to model LOS
environments. After the proposal as a generalized fading distribution, κ −µ
fading distribution is popularly used by the researchers for analysis of wireless
communication systems. Like Nakagami-m fading and η−µ distributions, κ−µ
distribution also can model a generalized fading scenario which includes the
non-homogeneous environment which is composed of the reﬂecting obstacles,
scattering elements, etc. of diﬀerent physical properties.
2.4.3.1
Physical model
Similar to Nakagami-m and η −µ fading models, it is assumed that the multi-
path components in received signal are the form of clusters in κ −µ distri-
bution. Each cluster has a number of scattered multipath components. The
delay spread of diﬀerent clusters is relatively larger than the delay spread of
multipath components within a cluster. Every cluster is assumed to have the

45
same average power. Unlike in η −µ fading and like Nakagami-m fading, it
is assumed that the in-phase and quadrature phase components are indepen-
dent and have equal powers in κ −µ fading. However, each cluster is assumed
to have some dominant components considered to be LOS components. In
such a model, the representation of envelope X of the fading signal is slightly
diﬀerent from that of Nakagami-m and/or η −µ fading. It can be given as
X2 =
n
X
i=0

(Ii + pi)2 + (Qi + qi)2
(2.34)
where n is the number of clusters in the received signal, and (Ii + pi) and
(Qi + qi) are respectively the in-phase and quadrature phase component of
the resultant signal of the ith cluster. Both Ii and Qi are mutually independent
and Gaussian distributed with zero mean, i.e., E(Ii) = E(Qi) = 0 and equal
variance, i.e., E(I2
i ) = E(Q2
i ) = σ2. pi and qi are the respective means of
in-phase and quadrature components of the ith cluster in the received signal.
The non-zero mean of in-phase and quadrature phase components reveals the
presence of a dominant component in the clusters of the received signal.
Again, as in the case of Nakagami-m and η −µ fading model, the fading
amplitude can be expressed as X2 = Pn
i=0
 R2

with R2
i = (Ii + pi)2 + (Qi +

here that R2
i follows non-central Chi-squared distribution. In this case, the

where κ is the ratio of total power in the dominant (LOS) components to

to number of clusters, n, in the received signal as µ = n with the constraint
that values of µ must be discrete on the account of discrete values of n. To
make the parameter µ to take continuous values, it is alternatively deﬁned as
µ =

SNR in the case of fading channels varies as the square of amplitude of the
received signal. So, as far as distributions are concerned, PDF of SNR is the
same as the square of amplitude distribution. PDF of SNR may be obtained
from the PDF of amplitude in equation (2.35) using the techniques of trans-
formation of random variables. The PDF of κ −µ distributed instantaneous

ful in analyzing the outage probability and MGF is useful for bit error rate

tems. In the following sections of this chapter, we will discuss the metrics and
methods for evaluation of the metrics which are used as performance analysis
tools for wireless communication systems.

that alternative expressions for MGF of κ −µ and η −µ distributions in the
form of Meijer’s G function are also reported [26]. But the expressions given
in this book (originally derived in [38] by N. Y. Ermolova) are in the form of
basic mathematical functions which are easy to evaluate, while one needs to
use numerical techniques to evaluate Meijer’s G functions.
2.4.3.3
Special cases
It was already discussed that κ −µ distribution can model generalized fad-
ing environments. This enables us to represent diﬀerent fading channels by
selecting diﬀerent values of fading parameters, κ and µ. But, certain values of
κ and µ can model speciﬁc distributions which are well known and useful in
modeling wireless fading channels.

Generalized Fading Channels
47
To discuss a special case, we again refer to the physical model. Limit the
number of clusters in the received signal to 1 which represents µ = 1. Then,
the expression of equation (2.34) reduces to
X =
q
(I + p)2 + (Q + q)2
(2.42)
where I and Q are Gaussian distributed with zero mean and equal variance.
But, in this case, the in-phase and quadrature phase components contain some
dominant component, which the means of in-phase component and quadrature
component are respectively p and q. This matches the deﬁnition of Rician
fading distribution which is commonly used to model fading channel with
LOS conditions, i.e., the value µ = 1 represents Rician fading as a special of
κ −µ fading distribution. In this case, κ represents the Rician K factor which
is also deﬁned as the ratio of total power in the dominant component to that
of the scattered components.
We have already discussed that Rician fading distribution can model the
fading scenarios ranging from as severe as Rayleigh fading to less severe fading
including no fading at all. Similarly, in the expression of equation (2.42), if we
consider that there is no dominant component, i.e., p = q = 0, it reduces to
X =
p
I2 + Q2
(2.43)
which is exactly the same as the amplitude of the Rayleigh fading model which
is the square root of sum of two squared independent Gaussian distributed
random variables. This case is obtained for no dominant component, i.e., K =
κ = 0. So, Rayleigh fading can be represented as a special case of κ−µ fading
with the values κ = 0 and µ = 1.
Again, restricting the value of κ to 0, another case which may be considered
is µ = 1
2. This means half a cluster with no dominant component, which is not
possible to explain with the help of a physical model. But it can be described
taking into consideration the previous case in which µ = 1 represents square
root sum of two squared Gaussian distributed random variables. So, in the
case of µ = 1
2, it can be thought of as a single Gaussian distributed random
variable. Since the PDF of κ−µ distributed random variable is restricted only
to positive values, this case represents one sided Gaussian fading.
Again, consider that the received signal arrives in clusters but the clusters
do not have any dominant component, i.e., put pi = qi = 0 in the physi-
cal model of κ −µ fading represented in equation (2.34). This reduces the
expression to the following form:
X2 =
n
X
i=0
 I2

(2.44)
with each Ii and Qi being mutually independent and Gaussian distributed
with zero mean and equal variance. This represents the physical model which
is exactly the same as that of Nakagami-m fading. So, Nakagami-m fading

and µ = m. As described in the special cases of Nakagami-m fading, similar
manipulations in the fading parameters of κ −µ distribution can represent all
the special cases of Nakagami-m fading too.
So, κ −µ distribution includes one-sided Gaussian, Rayleigh, Rician and
Nakagami-m fading distributions as its special cases. The values of κ−µ fading
parameters for these special cases are listed in Table 2.3. The PDFs for special
cases of κ −µ distributed normalized envelope are plotted as shown in Figure
2.3. It can be observed that the PDF curves shift toward right for non-zero
values of κ when compared with the same value of µ (see Rayleigh and Rician
case in Figure 2.3). This is because of a stronger LOS component for a larger
value of κ.
2.4.4
α −µ fading
The proposal of α −µ distribution had been made with the name of Stacy
distribution as a generalization to Gamma distribution [117,135]. The initial
proposal of Stacy distribution was to deal with the statistical problems, which
was renamed later by M. D. Yacoub as α −µ distribution [134,135]. α −µ
distribution can be used to model fading channels in the environment charac-
terized by non-homogeneous obstacles that may be nonlinear in nature. Like
the other generalized fading models discussed earlier in this section, α −µ
fading can also model various fading distributions as a special case.
2.4.4.1
Physical model
As discussed in Nakagami-m, η −µ and κ −µ fading models, α −µ fading
also considers the received signal to be collection of clusters of multipath
components. The clusters are assumed to have no dominant component. The
delay spread of diﬀerent clusters is relatively larger than the delay spread of
multipath components within a cluster. Every cluster is assumed to have the
same average power. This model diﬀers from other models in the deﬁnition

of power. In α −µ distribution, fading amplitude is deﬁned as the αth root
of the received power in the faded signal. In all other fading models, fading
amplitude is deﬁned as the square root of the received power in the faded
signal. The physical relation between resultants of received multipath clusters

where n is the number of clusters, Ii and Qi are the resultant in-phase and
quadrature phase components of ith cluster in the received signal, α is the
fading parameter that deﬁnes the relation that arises due to the non-linear
nature of the objects in-between the power of the received signal and am-
plitude of the fading signal envelope. Ii and Qi are mutually independent
Gaussian distributed random variables with zero mean and equal variance,
i.e., E(Ii) = E(Qi) = 0 and E(I2
i ) = E(Q2
i ) = σ2. Physically, α −µ distri-
bution is the same as Nakagami-m distribution with an extra parameter, α,
which is introduced to take care of non-linearity in certain fading conditions.

In such a case, Xα follows Gamma distribution as it is represented as the
sum of squared Gaussian random variables. The PDF of amplitude of the
received faded signal, X, can be obtained using transformation of random
variables. It can be given as

alternatively, it is deﬁned as [68]
µ =

Various other functions related to the SNR that describe the statistical

section.
2.4.4.2
CDF and MGF of α −µ fading
CDF and MGF are two statistical functions of random variables (instanta-
neous SNR in our case) which are most essential in evaluating the performance
metrics of a wireless communication system. In general, CDF is useful in an-
alyzing the outage probability and MGF is useful for BER/SER analysis of
the wireless communication systems. In the following sections of this chapter,
we will discuss the metrics and methods for evaluation of the metrics which
are used as performance analysis tools for wireless communication systems.
For α −µ distributed instantaneous SNR, CDF can be given in the form
of lower incomplete Gamma function as

MGF is useful in evaluating BER/SER performance of the wireless com-
munication systems, which is the most important parameter. As far as the
closed form MGF of α −µ fading distributions is concerned, a form which is
easy to evaluate like that in the case of Nakagami-m, η −µ and κ −µ fading
distributions are not available for the general case. But an MGF in the form

2.4.4.3
Special cases
All the distributions under the umbrella of generalized fading distributions
can model diﬀerent fading conditions for diﬀerent sets of values for fading pa-
rameters. These diﬀerent values represent various physical conditions. Some of
those conditions can be explained with the physical model of the distributions.
We have already discussed such specialized physical models for Nakagami-m,
η−µ and κ−µ fading distributions. However, generalized fading distributions
can model many more fading conditions as complex as such that cannot even
be explained with physical model description. In the following discussion, we
will discuss about special cases of α−µ fading distribution which can be used
to model certain fading environments.
To begin with the special cases of α −µ fading distribution, let us restrict
the number of clusters in the received signal to one, i.e., µ = 1. In this case,
the fading amplitude of the received signal described by equation (2.45) can
be given by
X =
αp
I2 + Q2
(2.53)
with I and Q being the in-phase and quadrature phase components of the re-
ceived signal. Here, I and Q are Gaussian distributed with equal variances, i.e.,
the power contained in in-phase and quadrature phase components is equal.
The relation described by equation (2.53) can be characterized by Weibull
distribution [89,91]. The PDF of Weibull distributed fading amplitude can be
given by
pX(x) = αxα−1
Ω
e−xα
Ω
(2.54)
where Ω= E(xα). Note that α also indicates severity of fading in addition
to the nonlinearity in the fading environment. Higher values of parameter α
indicate less severe fading. So, µ = 1 represents Weibull distribution as a

52
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
special case of α −µ fading distribution with α being the fading parameter of
Weibull distribution.
Now, considering α = 1 in the expression of the physical model described
by the expression of equation (2.53), the amplitude of received signal can be
modeled as
X = I2 + Q2
(2.55)
with I and Q being Gaussian distributed with zero mean and equal variance.
This represents exponential distribution. In such a case, the PDF of fading
envelope can be given by
pX(x) = 1
Ωe−x
Ω
(2.56)
So, considering α = 1 and µ = 1 as fading parameters of α −µ distribution,
exponential distribution can be represented as a special case of α −µ fading
distribution.
Again, considering the physical model described by the expression of equa-
tion (2.53) and α = 2, the amplitude of received signal can be represented as
X =
p
I2 + Q2
(2.57)
with I and Q being Gaussian distributed with zero mean and equal variance.
This represents Rayleigh distribution which is already explained in Section
2.3.1, i.e., considering µ = 1 and α = 2, Rayleigh fading can be represented
as a special case of α −µ fading distribution.
Similar to explanations given for the case of µ =
1
2 and µ =
1
4 in the
respective cases of κ−µ and η −µ fading distributions, considering α = 2 and
µ = 1
2, one sided Gaussian distribution can be represented as a special case of
α −µ distribution.
We now go back to equation (2.45) and assume the value of α = 2. For
this case, the received envelope of the faded signal can be represented as
X =
v
u
u
t
n
X
i=1
(I2
i + Q2
i )
(2.58)
with each Ii and Qi being mutually independent and Gaussian distributed
with zero mean and equal variance. This represents the physical model which
is exactly the same as that of Nakagami-m fading. So, Nakagami-m fading
can be represented as a special case of α −µ fading for the values α = 2
and µ = m. As described in the special cases of Nakagami-m fading, similar
manipulations in the fading parameters of α−µ distribution can represent all
the special cases of Nakagami-m fading too.
So, α −µ distribution includes Weibull, exponential, one-sided Gaussian,
Rayleigh and Nakagami-m distributions as its special cases. The values of α−µ
fading parameters for these special cases are listed in Table 2.4. The PDFs for
special cases of α−µ distributed normalized envelope corresponding to values
of fading parameters are plotted and can be observed in Figure 2.4.

Generation of channel coeﬃcients
Simulation of wireless communication systems involves realization of various
processes at transmitter, receiver and channel using suitable software tools.
The processes at transmitter include generation of bits, grouping the bits into
symbols, coding and/or modulation. At receiver, the involved processes are
demodulation, detection of symbols and getting the bitstream. Random noise
and channel coeﬃcients are to be generated to realize the wireless channel. The
channel coeﬃcients are assumed to be collective response of all the multipath
components and hence they may be assumed to be a distributed according to
any of the fading models we discussed earlier depending on the environment.
In the following subsections, we will discuss methods to generate the channel
coeﬃcients in MATLAB® for various fading distribution models. MATLAB
is the commonly used software tool for simulation of wireless communication
systems.
2.5.1
Channel coeﬃcients for commonly used fading distri-
butions
The methods to generate channel coeﬃcients for commonly used fading dis-
tributions are well known to the researchers and the academicians. However,
to maintain the continuity, we are discussing them in brief. Here, we will show
the ways to generate channel coeﬃcients in MATLAB. In all the generated
channel coeﬃcients, we will assume that the phase of the received envelope is
uniformly distributed in the range from 0 to 2π. The most frequently consid-
ered and the simplest fading model is Rayleigh fading. It has gained popularity
for its simplicity in determining statistical parameters. Physically, Rayleigh
distributed variable can be represented as the square root of sum of two inde-
pendent squared Gaussian distributed random variables with zero mean and
equal variance. So, a single sample of Rayleigh distributed channel coeﬃcient,
h, can be generated using the instruction that follows:
1 h=(1/sqrt(2))∗(randn+j∗randn);
where the factor
1
√
2 is to normalize the variance of the generated fading co-
eﬃcients. Similarly, a matrix of channel coeﬃcients can be generated using
the following instruction in case the system under consideration has multi-
ple antennas at transmitter and the receiver (multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system).
1 H=(1/sqrt(2))∗(randn(Nr,Nt) +j∗randn(Nr,Nt));
The above instruction generates channel matrix of dimension Nr × Nt which

Generalized Fading Channels
55
corresponds to the channel matrix of a MIMO system with Nt antennas at
the transmitter and Nr antennas at the receiver.
Rayleigh distribution can model a non-LOS fading environment. But that
is not always the case. To model the fading distribution when there exist LOS
or dominant components in the received signal, Rician distribution comes to
the rescue. Generation of Rician distributed fading channel coeﬃcients is sim-
ilar to that of Rayleigh fading. In Rician fading coeﬃcient generation, the
LOS component is characterized by a constant term in the in-phase compo-
nent. The value of this constant term depends on the K factor which is a
parameter of Rician distribution. So, a single sample of Rician distributed
channel coeﬃcient, h, can be generated using the MATLAB instruction that
follows:
1 hi=sqrt(K/(K+1))+sqrt(1/(2∗(K+1)))∗randn;
2 hq=sqrt(1/(2∗(K+1)))∗randn;
3 h=hi+j∗hq;
where the factors
q
K
K+1 and
q
1
2(K+1) are used to indicate the strength of
LOS/dominant component and to normalize the fading signal power. Simi-
larly, the same set of MATLAB instructions can be considered to generate
channel matrix for MIMO systems.
1 Hi=sqrt(K/(K+1))+sqrt(1/(2∗(K+1)))∗randn(Nr,Nt);
2 Hq=sqrt(1/(2∗(K+1)))∗randn(Nr,Nt);
3 H=Hi+j∗Hq;
The coeﬃcients that are generated in the channel matrix are identically dis-
tributed and mutually independent. In the above set of instructions for h and
H, it can be observed that for the limiting case of K →∞, all the coeﬃcient
values become 1, i.e., there is no fading, and for the case of K = 0, it becomes
equivalent to Rayleigh fading coeﬃcients. Thus, referring to the discussion
about Rician fading channels in Section 2.3.3, it is veriﬁed that Rician dis-
tribution can model fading environments ranging from no fading to Rayleigh
fading.
Rician distribution for modeling the fading environments is suitable for
the fading conditions that are less severe than Rayleigh fading. Next, we dis-
cuss the distribution that can model fading conditions that are more severe
than Rayleigh fading. Such conditions can be modeled by Hoyt (Nakagami-q)
distribution. Hoyt fading channel is characterized by absence of the dominan-
t/LOS component unlike in Rician fading. The diﬀerence of Hoyt fading from
Rayleigh fading is that it considers unequal powers in in-phase and quadra-
ture phase components of the received signal. So, a single sample of Hoyt
distributed channel coeﬃcient, h, can be generated using the MATLAB in-
struction that follows:

56
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
1 h=(1/sqrt(1+qˆ2))∗(randn+j∗q∗randn);
where q, the fading parameter, indicates the severity of fading. Similarly, a
matrix of channel coeﬃcients can be generated using the following instruction
in case the system under consideration has multiple antennas at transmitter
and the receiver (MIMO system).
1 H=(1/sqrt(1+qˆ2))∗(randn(Nr,Nt) +j∗q∗randn(Nr,Nt));
In the next section we will discuss the methods of generating channel
coeﬃcients for generalized fading channels.
2.5.2
Channel coeﬃcients for generalized fading distribu-
tions
Simulation of wireless communication systems over generalized fading chan-
nels is important because simulating them over generalized fading can produce
results for any well-known fading scenario just by selecting suitable values of
fading parameters. This eliminates the need of producing multiple software
programs for diﬀerent fading conditions. In this section, we will discuss the
methods for obtaining channel coeﬃcients of various generalized fading dis-
tributions that are discussed earlier. In most cases, we will use the relation of
physical models that were deﬁned to explain generalized fading distributions
while generating the channel coeﬃcient on MATLAB. The same methods will
be used to generate the channel coeﬃcients in the simulations of diﬀerent
variants of MIMO communication systems in the chapters to follow. We will
now discuss the procedure to obtain channel coeﬃcients one by one for various
generalized fading distributions.
2.5.2.1
Generating Nakagami-m faded channel coeﬃcients
Note that the received signal following Nakagami-m fading distribution is as-
sumed to be a collection of multipath components that reach the receiver in
form of clusters. The number of clusters is related to the fading parameter,
m, as per the physical model discussed in Section 2.4.1. Primarily, Nakagami-
m fading distribution is already shown to be suitable for medeling non-LOS
fading conditions as per the physical model. However, there are some indirect
manipulations of fading parameters that can model Rician fading as a special
case of Nakagami-m distribution (already discussed in Section 2.4.1). Follow-
ing the expression of physical model of equation (2.10), channel coeﬃcients
following Nakagami-m distribution can be generated by the following set of
MATLAB instructions.

6 n=n/(2∗m);
7 phi=2∗pi∗rand;
8 h=sqrt(n)∗cos(phi)+j∗sqrt(n)∗sin(phi);
This generates a single sample of channel coeﬃcient (useful for SISO systems).
We ﬁrst generated the square variate of the Nakagami-m fading signal and then
converted it to the complex envelope form using the uniformly distributed
phase component. The same function can be modiﬁed to obtain independent
and identically distributed channel coeﬃcients with slight modiﬁcations as
shown below.
1 function H=nak m(m,Nr,Nt)
2 n=zeros(Nr,Nt);
3 for i=1:2∗m
4 n=n+randn(Nr,Nt).ˆ2;
5 end
6 n=n/(2∗m);
7 phi=2∗pi∗rand(Nr,Nt);
8 H=(n.ˆ0.5).∗cos(phi)+j∗(n.ˆ0.5).∗sin(phi);
The method to generate Nakagami-m distributed channel coeﬃcients used
the physical model. In the physical model, the fading parameter, m, is deﬁned
as the number of clusters of multipath components in the received signal.
Alternatively, it is observed that the instantaneous SNR follows Gamma dis-
tribution. Hence, the coeﬃcients of Nakagami-m distributed fading channels
can also be derived from Gamma distributed random variable. To do that we
need to relate the fading parameter, m, of Nakagami-m fading distribution
model with the parameters of Gamma distribution. In MATLAB, Gamma
distributed random variables can be generated using the function gamrnd. It
has two parameters, shape parameter, A, and rate parameter, B, as input ar-
guments. A and B are related to the Nakagami-m fading parameter m as A=m
and B=γ/m respectively. Thus, a sample of Nakagami-m distributed fading
channel coeﬃcients can be generated using the following set of instructions.
1 n=gamrnd(m,a SNR/m);
2 phi=2∗pi∗rand;
3 h=(nˆ0.5)∗cos(phi)+j∗(nˆ0.5)∗sin(phi);
where a SNR is the average SNR or variance of the generated samples of
Gamma/Nakagami-m distributed random variable.
Similar to the other cases, channel coeﬃcient matrix for MIMO systems
can be generated using the following set of MATLAB instructions for inde-
pendent and identically distributed fading links.

2 phi=2∗pi∗rand(Nr,Nt);
3 H=(n.ˆ0.5).∗cos(phi)+j∗(n.ˆ0.5).∗sin(phi);
2.5.2.2
Generating η −µ faded channel coeﬃcients
In η −µ fading distribution, the received signal is assumed to be a collec-
tion of clusters of multipath components. The resultant of each cluster is in
the form of Gaussian distributed in-phase and quadrature phase components.
The diﬀerence from Nakagami-m distribution and η −µ distribution is that
the variance of in-phase and quadrature phase component is diﬀerent in η −µ
distribution. Again, η −µ fading is found suitable to model a non-LOS envi-
ronment and the fading scenarios ranging from as severe as one sided Gaussian
to the case where there is no fading at all. To generate the fading channel coef-
ﬁcients that follow η −µ distribution, we refer to the physical model discussed
in Section 2.4.2. A sample of η −µ distributed fading channel coeﬃcient may
be obtained using the following set of MATLAB instructions.

2 coeff=sqrt(eta);

For MIMO systems, the MATLAB function can be modiﬁed as follows to
generate the required channel coeﬃcient matrix.

It shall be noted here that the procedure for generation of η−µ distributed
channel coeﬃcients in this book is using physical a model. The physical model
relates number of clusters to the fading parameter, µ. Thus, this technique
is valid for generation of fading coeﬃcients with discrete values of µ. The
restriction is that the values of µ have to be half integer, i.e., integer values
of 2µ. For other values of µ, it is not possible to generate the channel coef-
ﬁcients using such a simple set of instructions. One needs to use statistical
methods of transformation of a uniformly distributed random variable to the
random variable that follows required distribution. Various methods of such
transformation of uniformly distributed random variables have been discussed
in detail in Section 7.3 of [127]. Among the methods that can transform a uni-
formly distributed random variable to the required distribution, the rejection
method has been popularly used. In general, the samples of a random variable
may be generated using the rejection method in the case that the PDF of the
distribution is available in closed form. This method gives accurate results as
reported in [23].
2.5.2.3
Generating κ −µ faded channel coeﬃcients
Most of the characteristics of κ −µ fading distribution have been discussed in
Section 2.4.3. To simulate a wireless communication system over κ −µ fading
channels, it is necessary to generate channel coeﬃcients that follow κ−µ distri-
bution. To generate κ−µ distributed fading channel coeﬃcients, we note that
κ−µ fading model is well suited for LOS conditions. That means each cluster
of the received signal contains some dominant component. So, we will again
refer to the physical model of κ −µ represented by the expression of equation
(2.34) in Section 2.4.3. It was shown that a κ −µ distributed random variable
can be obtained from mutually independent Gaussian random variables with
non-zero mean that represents the LOS component. The MATLAB function
that follows can be used to generate a single sample that comes from κ −µ
distributed random variables. The same can be used as a channel coeﬃcient
the of κ −µ fading model.

For MIMO systems, the MATLAB function can be modiﬁed as follows
to generate the required channel coeﬃcient matrix. The only diﬀerence for
MIMO systems from the previous case is that now multiple samples need to
be generated in the form of a matrix of size Nr × Nt which is accomplished in
the following MATLAB function.
1 function x=kappa mu channel(kappa,mu,Nr,Nt);
2 m = sqrt( kappa/((kappa+1))) ;
3 s = sqrt( 1/(2∗(kappa+1)) );

It shall be noted here that the procedure for generation of κ−µ distributed
channel coeﬃcients in this book is using a physical model. The physical model
relates number of clusters to the fading parameter, µ. Thus, this technique
is valid for generation of fading coeﬃcients with discrete values of µ. The
restriction is that the values of µ have to be integers. For other values of µ,
it is not possible to generate the channel coeﬃcients using such a simple set
of instructions. One needs to use statistical methods of transformation of a
uniformly distributed random variable to the random variable that follows
required distribution. Various methods of such transformation of uniformly
distributed random variables have been discussed in detail in Section 7.3 of
[127]. In general, κ−µ distributed fading channel coeﬃcients may be generated
using the rejection method as reported in [23].
2.5.2.4
Generating α −µ faded channel coeﬃcients
It has already been discussed that α −µ distribution has been a generalized
version of Stacy distribution which was again proposed as a generalized form
of Gamma distribution [135]. In addition, it was discussed that the square
variate of Nakagami-m distributed variable is related to Gamma distribution
in Section 2.4.1. Also, comparing the physical models of Nakagami-m fading
distribution and α −µ fading distribution respectively given by expression
of equation (2.10) and expression of equation (2.45), the relation between

Generalized Fading Channels
61
Nakagami-m distributed random variable and α −µ distributed random vari-
able can be given by
X2
Nak = Xα
α−µ
(2.59)
where XNak is a Nakagami-m distributed random variable and Xα−µ is an
α −µ distributed random variable.
Using the relation above between Nakagami-m distributed random variable
and α −µ distributed random variable, we can generate the channel coeﬃ-
cients that follow α −µ distribution using the set of MATLAB instructions
that generated Nakagami-m fading coeﬃcients and manipulating them as re-
quired to obtain α −µ distributed fading channel coeﬃcients. The exact set
of MATLAB instructions to generate α −µ fading channel matrix coeﬃcients
for MIMO systems is given below.
1 function H=alpha mu channel(alpha,mu,Nr,Nt)
2 a inv=1/alpha;
3 n=zeros(Nr,Nt);
4 for i=1:2∗mu
5 n=n+randn(Nr,Nt)ˆ2;
6 end
7 n=n/(2∗mu);
8 phi=2∗pi∗rand(Nr,Nt);
9 H=(n.ˆa inv).exp(j∗phi);
Similarly, as discussed in Section 2.4.1 and Section 2.5.2.1, Nakagami-m dis-
tributed random variables are directly related to Gamma distributed random
variables. We can use this fact and generate α −µ distributed fading channel
coeﬃcient using the MATLAB instructions that follow.
1 n=gamrnd(mu,a SNR/mu,Nr,Nt);
2 a inv=1/alpha;
3 phi=2∗pi∗rand(Nr,Nt);
4 H=(n.ˆa inv).∗exp(j∗phi);
The samples and matrices of fading channel coeﬃcients generated in this
chapter would be frequently used in the subsequent chapters of this book.
The following chapters are going to consider performance analysis of various
variants of MIMO systems discussed in Chapter 1 over generalized fading
channels discussed in this chapter. In all the cases, we are going to consider
that the channel envelopes follow particular distribution and the phase of
received signal follows uniform distribution over the range 0 to 2π radians.

Introduction
In Chapter 1, we introduced spatial multiplexing. It has been mentioned that
it can achieve spectral eﬃciencies which vary linearly with the number of
antennas available at the transmitter. This is made possible by transmitting
parallel streams of information from multiple transmit antennas. The improve-
ment in the spectral eﬃciency and hence the transmission rate comes at the
cost of other complexities like hardware requirement, computational complex-
ity at the receiver, requirement of inter antenna synchronization, high levels
of inter antenna interference, etc. It is a well established fact that due to inter
antenna interference, the symbols transmitted by multiple antennas cannot
be detected correctly at the receiver in the absence of scattering. Unlike other
wireless communication systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sys-
tems take advantage of the randomness introduced by scattering and multi-
path components to improve the spectral eﬃciency.
MIMO systems basically serve two purposes: providing multiplexing gain
by parallel transmission of independent streams of data and providing diver-
sity gain by receiving multiple copies of independently faded data streams. So,
MIMO systems are capable of achieving multiplexing gains as well as diversity
gains. But both these gains cannot increase to inﬁnity. For an Nt ×Nr MIMO
system the maximum diversity gain that can be achieved is NtNr and the
63

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
maximum multiplexing gain that can be achieved is min(Nt, Nr). Both the
gains cannot be maximum at an instant. So, there exists a trade-oﬀbetween
diversity gain and multiplexing gain.
In this chapter, we will discuss various performance metrics of MIMO
systems with spatial multiplexing over various generalized fading channels.
Basically, the metrics under consideration are error probability and channel
capacity. We will see some insights to analytical expressions of these metrics
and simulation results using MATLAB®.
3.2
Diversity multiplexing trade-oﬀand the capacity of
MIMO systems
MIMO systems are known for improving the data rates by parallel transmis-
sion of an independent stream of digitally modulated symbols. Obviously, this
augments to the total transmission rate. At the same time, MIMO systems
oﬀer diversity gain. The diversity gain is achieved as a result of multiple anten-
nas at the receiver when multiplexing is used for transmission. In many cases,
diversity is achieved at the cost of multiplexing. Diversity gain and multi-
plexing gain both cannot increase simultaneously. To achieve one, we need to
compromise the other. So, there is a trade-oﬀbetween diversity gain and mul-
tiplexing gain [146]. MIMO systems can be used only for achieving diversity.
In that case, all the antennas at the transmitter are used to transmit the same
symbol from the incoming bit/symbol sequence. In the case of MIMO systems
used only for multiplexing, incoming stream of information is converted into
parallel bit/symbol sequences and each of these parallel sequences are trans-
mitted simultaneously from multiple antennas available at the transmitter. For
multiplexing, it can be shown that 8 × 8 MIMO systems can achieve capacity
as high as 40 times than that of single-input single-output (SISO) systems un-
der certain conditions [41]. For the case of multiplexing, the channel capacity
per unit channel bandwidth for MIMO systems at high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) conditions can be given as [41,146]
C ≈min(Nt, Nr) log2 (SNR)
(3.1)
The multiplexing gain is limited by the minimum of the number of antennas
at transmitter and the number of antennas at the receiver. This is because it
is considered that there are non-interfering parallel links in multiplexing. This
establishes that number of parallel links cannot be more than the minimum
number of antennas on either side. The spatial multiplexing gain [146] can be
deﬁned as
r =
lim
SNR→∞
C
log2(SNR)
(3.2)

Spatial Multiplexing
65
where r is the spatial multiplexing gain. This shows that for any MIMO sys-
tem, the maximum spatial multiplexing gain is min(Nt, Nr).
In the same way, [146] deﬁnes the diversity gain in the following way:
d =
lim
SNR→∞−log(BER)
log(SNR)
(3.3)
where d is the diversity gain. In other words, the diversity order of a commu-
nication system is said to be d if the bit error rate (BER) of the system varies
as inverse of SNRd in the high SNR regime. Here, we also recall that diversity
order is alternatively deﬁned as the number of independent paths from trans-
mitter to receiver. In the case of receiver diversity systems such as selection
combining or maximal ratio combining, we get the same diversity order as the
number of antennas available at the receiver. In the case of MIMO systems,
the maximum number of independent paths from transmitter to receiver is
the same as the product of number of antennas at transmitter and at receiver.
So, the maximum diversity order that can be achieved by any MIMO system
is NtNr.
So, the diversity multiplexing trade-oﬀcan be given as [146]
dopt = (Nt −r) (Nr −r)
(3.4)
where dopt is the optimum diversity gain when the system is used to achieve
multiplexing gain of r. As stated earlier, the trade-oﬀgiven in the above
expression is considering the case that multiplexing gain is obtained assuming
that the parallel links are non-interfering links, i.e., an antenna at transmitter
side is connected to single antenna of receiver side or there is one-to-one link
among the antennas at transmitter and receiver. At the same time, while
calculating the diversity gain, it considers that a link is available from an
antenna at the transmitter to every antenna of the receiver. However, with
fully interfering MIMO channels, the channel capacity per unit bandwidth can
be given by [43,80]
CMIMO = log2

det

INr + γ
Nt
HHH

(3.5)
where INr is an identity matrix of dimension Nr × Nr, and γ is the average
SNR per receiver antenna. Again, for optimum use of resources in this case,
a subset of receiver antennas can be selected for maximum channel capacity
without compromising on the number of parallel data streams that can be
transmitted simultaneously. This virtually means that the channel capacity of
MIMO systems can scale linearly with the number of transmitting antennas
and we will also see in the next section that the diversity order depends on
the number of antennas at the receiver. Note that the expression of MIMO
channel capacity, equation (3.5), is valid only when spatial multiplexing is
employed at the transmitter and the channels are fully interfering.

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
Spatial multiplexing is seen as a potential technology for improving trans-
mission rates. But for the improved transmission rates, cost has to be paid in
terms of hardware and computational complexity. Parallel transmission from
multiple antennas requires separate radio frequency (RF) chain for each an-
tenna at transmitter. These RF chains consist of complex hardware comprised
of A/D converters, modulators, RF ampliﬁers, etc. This makes the system
bulky (at least for the user handset). Although, receiver diversity techniques
also demand such RF chains in multiple number, mainly receiver diversity
techniques are implemented at the base stations which are not mobile in na-
ture. So, bulky hardware can be aﬀorded at the receiver. In addition to this,
spatial multiplexing systems need inter antenna synchronization.
3.3
Spatial multiplexing
In the previous section, we discussed about two main parameters which can
be improved using MIMO systems. It is also discussed that if the multiplex-
ing in MIMO systems consider non-interfering channels, the multiplexing gain
that can be achieved limits to min(Nt, Nr) and no gain can be achieved in the
diversity order as compared to SISO systems. But, in practice, the existence
of non-interfering MIMO channels is an idealistic scenario. All the practical
MIMO channels are interfering in nature, i.e., a symbol/signal transmitted
from an antenna at the transmitter is surely going to suﬀer interference from
the symbols/signals being transmitted by all other antennas at the trans-
mitter. This fact that the practical MIMO channels are interfering in nature
is helpful and can be used in a way to achieve diversity even while using
multiple antennas of transmitter for parallel transmission of information, i.e.,
multiplexing. Interfering channels or, in fact, the channel model that is under
consideration to achieve the diversity order of NtNr is helpful in explaining
how MIMO systems can be useful in achieving diversity and multiplexing si-
multaneously, provided there exists a rich scattering environment. In such a
channel model, each transmitter antenna has a link to all the receiver anten-
nas. So, the system as a whole may be considered as a parallel combination of
an Nt number of 1 × Nr receiver diversity systems, i.e., each such system can
achieve diversity order of Nr separately. Now, these 1 × Nr systems are com-
bined such that the set of receiver antennas remain the same. Each receiver
antenna receives signals from all the transmitter antennas. So, received signal
at each antenna is a combination of the signals being transmitted by all the
transmitter antennas. Thus, each receiver antenna receives a signal that is in-
terfered by all the transmitted symbols from each transmitter antenna at the
corresponding time instant. But also, each receiver antenna receives one copy
of each symbol from every transmitter antenna. Thus at the receiver, number
of copies of the same signal/symbol is the same as that of the antennas at the

Spatial Multiplexing
67
receiver. This means that the diversity order oﬀered by such a system is Nr.
We have already discussed that each antenna at the transmitter is transmit-
ting an independent sequence of symbols. This means the multiplexing gain
is of the order of the number of antennas at the transmitter. Again, revisiting
the expression of equation (1.2), the relation between transmitted symbols
and received vector can be expressed as follows.

From the above expression, it is observed that the useful signal content
in the receiver antennas is a linear combination of transmitted symbols at
one particular instant. This gives rise to the need of antenna synchroniza-
tion at transmitter side. If the antennas are not transmitting the symbols
simultaneously, an overlap of multiple symbols need to be considered at every
receiver antenna which would make the system highly complex and introduce
large numbers of detection errors. So, in general when there is simultaneous
transmission from multiple antennas, the transmitter antennas have to be
synchronous in transmission.
The following set of MATLAB instructions can be used for the generation
of a spatially multiplexed symbol and obtaining the vector received at the
receiver after passing through the noisy fading channel (the fading coeﬃcients
can be generated using the MATLAB instructions discussed in Chapter 2 for
various fading models):
1
x=round((M−1)∗rand(Nt,1));
2
x q = pskmod(x,M)/sqrt(Nt∗Eavg);
% digital modulation
3
y =
H∗x q;
% faded signal
4
r = y+10ˆ(−EbNo(c)/20)∗n; % Received noisy signal
The above MATLAB instructions are for M-ary phase shift keying (PSK)
modulation scheme where M is the modulation order, Eavg is the average
energy per symbol of the constellation points in the modulation scheme, Nt is
the number of transmitter antennas, EbNo is the SNR in dB, r is the vector
of signals received at each receiving antenna and H is the channel matrix.
For detection of symbol vector at the receiver, maximum likelihood (ML)
detection is found to be optimum and we will follow the same for detection
in spatial multiplexing systems. ML detection for MIMO systems is based
on the exhaustive search algorithm [6]. The ML detection rule for spatially
multiplexed systems can be given by
ˆx = arg min
x∈X ∥r −Hx∥2
(3.8)

68
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
where ˆx is the detected symbol vector, X is the set of all possible symbol
vectors that may be transmitted, r is the received vector and H is the Nr ×Nt
channel matrix.
Note that the ML detection of a spatially multiplexed symbol represented
by the rule in expression of equation (3.8) needs the set of all possible spatially
multiplexed symbols. This set can be obtained using the MATLAB instruc-
tions that follow:
1 lut = pskmod([0:M−1],M); % Look up table
2 Eavg = sum(abs(lut).ˆ2)/M; % Average energy of constellation
3 N lut = lut/sqrt(Eavg); % Normalized look up table

10
TA2(p,m)= N lut(mod(floor((m−1)/(Mˆ(Nt−p))),M)+1)..
11
../sqrt(Nt);
12
end
13
end
14 end
Again, the above instructions are used for M-ary PSK modulation schemes.
For other modulation schemes, the ﬁrst instruction requires appropriate
change. However, other instructions would remain the same. In the above
instructions, TA2 is the variable which is a matrix that contains all possible
spatial multiplexing codes at the transmitter as column vectors. The set of
all possible vectors of spatial multiplexing symbols is used for the detection
of symbols at the receiver. Note that the look-up table having entries of all
possible spatial multiplexed symbols is kept ready at the receiver as a part
of the system design. The entries of the same table may be used once the
receiver senses some reception. Detection of the received symbol can be done
using the following set of MATLAB instructions.

The MATLAB instructions above can be combinely used for simulations
of spatial multiplexing systems. The complete MATLAB script ﬁle for symbol
error rate (SER) performance of spatial multiplexing systems is available at
the end of this book in Appendix B. Simulation of a spatial multiplexing
system on MATLAB was performed to study the eﬀect of diﬀerent numbers
of antennas at transmitter and receiver. The results of the simulations can
be observed in Figure 3.1. More number of transmitter antennas (Nt = 4 in

eﬃciency by a factor of 2 as compared to the case that Nt = 2, which has better
SER performance for the spatial multiplexing system under consideration.
3.3.1
Detection complexity of spatially multiplexed systems
Apart from performance metrics of wireless communication systems, detection
complexity is an important parameter. Detection complexity is directly related
to the computational power required at the receiver and battery life of mobile
equipment. More computation implies more power requirement. In mobile
devices, battery is the only source of this required power. So, it is always
preferred to have minimum detection complexity for mobile devices used in
wireless communication systems. In the following discussions, we will study the
complexity of the detection process of spatially multiplexed MIMO systems.
The relation of decoding complexity with the order of modulation scheme,
and number of antennas at transmitter and receiver will also be discussed. In
this book, detection complexity is assumed to be of the order of the number
of complex operations required to detect a symbol vector from the received
signal vector.
MIMO systems involve matrix operations. So, it is obvious that the com-
putational complexity is going to be more than that of SISO systems and

70
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
diversity systems. From the expression of equation (3.8), it is clear that the
detection complexity is directly related to the channel matrix size, i.e., the
number of transmitter antennas and the number of receiver antennas. It is
also related to the total number of all possible symbol vectors which is related
to the order of modulation scheme. We ﬁrst establish the number of complex
operations required to calculate the squared norm ∥r −Hx∥2 for single value
of x. This involves multiplication of matrix H with vector x. This step con-
sumes NtNr number of complex multiplications and Nr(Nt −1) number of
complex additions.
The calculation of norm is required to be done for the same number of
times as the number of all possible symbol vectors that may be transmitted.
For an Nt × Nr MIMO system, the transmitted symbol vector is of dimension
Nt. For a vector of dimension Nt with the possibility that each element can
come only from any of the M possible entries, the number of all possible signal
vectors Nsv for M-ary modulation scheme is given as
Nsv = 2Nt log2(M) = M Nt
(3.9)
From the order of modulation, M, number of bits per symbol can be given as
log2(M). Overall detection complexity is mainly governed by the number of
complex multiplications. So, the complexity can be given by
Nmult = NtNrM Nt
(3.10)
The detection complexity varies linearly with the number of receiver antennas.
It varies exponentially with the number of transmitter antennas and modula-
tion order. Mainly, MIMO systems are found to improve the spectral eﬃciency
by parallel transmission of independent sequence of information symbols. But,
the number of parallel data sequence (which is the same as number of trans-
mitting antennas) is responsible for exponential increase in the detection com-
plexity. So, for example, the detection complexity of an 8 × 8 MIMO system
with 8-QAM modulation scheme is of the order 88 and it increases to 168
(by a factor of 28) for 16-QAM modulation scheme with an improvement of 8
bits/s/Hz in spectral eﬃciency.
Next, we will discuss the statistics of generalized fading channel models for
spatial multiplexing systems. It would involve discussions on the methodology
to analyze diﬀerent performance metrics of wireless communication systems.
3.4
Nakagami-m fading channel model for spatially mul-
tiplexed systems
It is already discussed that MIMO systems perform well in rich scattering
environments. The Nakagami-m fading can model a wide range of fading sce-
narios. We will use this characteristic of Nakagami-m fading model to study

Spatial Multiplexing
71
performance of spatial multiplexing MIMO systems over a wide range of fading
environments. In Nakagami-m fading MIMO channels considered in this sec-
tion, the channel matrix is the set of independent and identically distributed
channel coeﬃcients. Each channel coeﬃcient has a resultant in-phase com-
ponent and a resultant quadrature phase component. All these components
and coeﬃcients are assumed to be mutually independent of each other. From
equation (3.7), the received signal at kth receiver antenna can be given as
ri = [hi1x1 + hi2x2 + · · · + hiNtxNt] + ni
(3.11)
So, each ri is a linear combination of Nt number of Nakagami-m faded channel
coeﬃcients. Again considering the physical model of Nakagami-m fading in ex-
pression of equation (2.10) of Section 2.4.1, it can be shown that each complex
element of channel coeﬃcient matrix, H, can be represented as follows.
hpq|m = hIpq|m/2 + jhQpq|m/2
(3.12)
The above expression says that a Nakagami-m distributed complex envelope
can be decomposed into its real part (in-phase component) and imaginary
part (quadrature phase component). Each in-phase component and quadra-
ture phase component is Nakagami-m distributed envelope but the fading
parameter for both these components is m/2, i.e., half the fading parameter
value of the complex envelope. Though physical model restricts the values of
fading parameter, m, to be discrete and half integer, a relation of Nakagami-m
distributed random variables has been established with Gamma distributed
random variables so that generation of Nakagami-m distributed channel co-
eﬃcients can be easily done on suitable software platforms for any positive
real value of m. The relation of Gamma distributed random variables and
Nakagami-m distributed random variables not only makes the simulation of
communication systems simpler but it also simpliﬁes the analysis of wireless
communication systems while modeling them for various performance metrics.
From the expressions of equation (3.11) and equation (3.12), signal received
at ith antenna, ri for i ∈[1, 2, · · · , Nr] can be represented as the weighted sum
of the fading envelopes with the fading parameter, which is half the Nakagami-
m fading parameter for the fading channel model. Again, the weights depend
on the type and order of the modulation scheme. For spatially multiplexed
systems, if the symbols are coming from a complex constellation, the symbol
transmitted from jth antenna for j ∈[1, 2, · · · , Nt] will have real and imagi-
nary components given by xj = xjI + jxjQ. Thus, the jth term in ri can be
represented as
hijxj = (hijI + jhijQ) (xjI + jxjQ)
(3.13)
= (hijIxjI −hijQxjQ) + j (hijQxjI + hijIxjQ)
(3.14)
This can be further helpful in the analysis of error performance of spa-
tially multiplexed MIMO systems. In spatially multiplexed MIMO systems,

72
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
the transmitted symbol is a vector of signals coming from constellation of dig-
itally modulated signals. It consists of Nt elements. Let a transmitted symbol
be denoted by x. In case any other symbol x′ is received on the transmission
of x, it is said that the symbol is received in error. Here, let us deﬁne pair-
wise error probability as the probability that a symbol x is transmitted and
another symbol x′ is detected. It is given by
P (x →x′) = Q


s
∥H∆x∥2
F
2N0


(3.15)
where ∆x = x −x′ is the diﬀerence vector of the transmitted symbol and
the detected symbol. Note that the pairwise error probability is for a given
channel matrix, H. To ﬁnd average pairwise error probability, we need to
average the conditional pairwise error probability over the probability density
function (PDF) of ∥H∆x∥F . Note that H∆x is a column vector having Nr
elements. The ith element of H∆x can be given as
∆ri = [hi1∆x1 + hi2∆x2 + · · · + hiNt∆xNt]
(3.16)
Thus, the Frobenius norm in the expression of pairwise error probability can
be given by
∥H∆x∥2
F =
Nr
X
i=1
|∆ri|2
(3.17)
Now, to average the pairwise error probability conditioned on given channel
matrix, the PDF of ∥H∆x∥2
F is required. From the above expression, for in-
dependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel matrix, it is clear that
every ∆ri is independent for all values of i. Thus, PDF of ∥H∆x∥2
F can be
obtained by convolving the individual PDFs of |∆ri|2 or moment generating
function (MGF) of ∥H∆x∥2
F can be obtained by multiplying the individual
MGFs of |∆ri|2 for all the values of i ∈[1, 2, · · · , Nr]. Again, the PDF of each
|∆ri|2 need to be obtained. It can be obtained using the principle of random
variable transformations and using the methods to obtain PDFs for functions
of random variables. The PDF of each |∆ri|2 can be further obtained by using
equation (3.16). So, each ∆ri is a summation of Nt complex random variables
each of which will be a channel coeﬃcient scaled by a factor dependent on
∆xj. Thus, each |∆ri|2 is a summation of 2Nt random variables including in-
phase and quadrature phase components. This process of obtaining PDF for
evaluating average pairwise error probability of spatially multiplexed MIMO
systems is straightforward for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels in which the
in-phase and quadrature phase components follow Gaussian distribution. Fur-
ther, without going into the detailed derivation of an expression for the PDF of
∥H∆x∥2
F , we will discuss the behavior of spatial multiplexing MIMO systems
for diﬀerent values of fading parameters.

modulation over Nakagami-m fading channels for diﬀerent values of m.
The results of MATLAB simulation of 2 × 2 MIMO systems with spatial
multiplexing over Nakagami-m fading channels are shown in Figure 3.2. The
results are shown for diﬀerent values of fading parameter m. An improvement
is observed in both the SER performance and the rate at which SER reduces
with increasing SNR as m increases. Note that as per discussion in Chapter 2,
the increasing values of fading parameter, m, indicates reduced fading severity.
This results in the improved performance with higher values of m. The results
are shown for m < 2. For this case, the improvement in fading conditions is the
reason behind the improvement of SER. We will see that similar improvements
are not observed by further increasing the value of fading parameter, m.
The cases of higher fading parameter values m > 2 are also discussed for
spatial multiplexing systems. To discuss the performance of spatial multiplex-
ing systems over Nakagami-m fading channels for the fading parameter values
such that m > 2, we do it in two parts to reach to some fruitful observation.
Part one is the performance for lower SNR regions (SNR <10 dB) and the
second part is the performance for higher SNR regions (SNR >10 dB). The
results for both cases are plotted and shown in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 re-
spectively. First, let’s observe the results for the low SNR case in Figure 3.3.

It is observed that the SER performance is improved on increasing the value
of fading parameter, m. The interesting thing to observe in this case is the
region of SNR between 8 dB and 10 dB. In this region it is observed that the
SER curves for diﬀerent values of m start crossing each other. Finally, after
this crossing happens, the performance is observed as shown in Figure 3.4 for
the same case for SNR values greater than 10 dB. In this case, it is observed
that the SER performance shows degradation with increased values of m. This
degradation is observed because of the fact that reduced fading severity is de-
scribed by greater values of m in Nakagami-m fading channel models, i.e.,
higher values of m indicate the fading channels are more like additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels (m →∞models no fading case). Note that
rich scattering environment is a primary requirement for MIMO systems to
perform better. In the case of low SNR region, noise is the dominating factor
and this is the reason for better performance observed for higher values of m
for SNR <10 dB.

Spatial multiplexing over η −µ fading channels
In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of η −µ fading dis-
tribution model. It is more general than Nakagami-m fading model. In fact,
Nakagami-m fading is a special case of η −µ fading distribution. Again, as
discussed in the previous section, the received signal at each antenna would
be a linear combination of Nt number of mutually independent η −µ faded
channel coeﬃcients. For analysis of wireless communication systems, we may
need PDF of the resultant signal that is received at each antenna from which
the statistics of total SNR may be easily obtained. So, in the case of η −µ
distributed channel coeﬃcients with uniformly distributed phase, the real and
imaginary parts can be related to the complex envelope as follows.
hpq|η−µ = hI|η−µ/2 + jhQ|η−µ/2
(3.18)
For further analysis, a relation of η −µ distributed random variable may
be established with Gamma distributed random variables. From the above
expression and the physical model of η −µ distributed fading channels, it
is clear that the in-phase and quadrature phase components of the fading
coeﬃcients can be separately approximated by Gamma distributed random

variables [97]. This can be done by matching the ﬁrst two moments of random
variables to obtain the shape parameter and the scale parameter [59]. This
relation can make all the analyses very simple. However, this relation may not
be true for all values of η and µ.
In a similar way to the case of Nakagami-m fading channels, the spatially
multiplexed MIMO system has been modeled and simulated in MATLAB for
various fading parameter values. In the case of η−µ fading channels, there are
two fading parameters which are used to characterize a fading environment.
The results for various fading conditions have been obtained from the simu-
lations. Figure 3.5 shows SER results of spatially multiplexed MIMO systems
over η −µ fading channels. For generating these results, quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme is considered and the values of fad-
ing parameter η are varied from 1 to 1000. For this case, the value of µ = 1 is
kept unchanged. It can be observed that for a ﬁxed value of µ, the error per-
formance of a spatially multiplexed MIMO system improves when the value
of η is increased from 1. Similar trend of improvement can be observed on
decreasing the values of η from 1. This is because η = 1 represents the point
of symmetry for η −µ distribution. It comes from the deﬁnition of η, i.e., η
is the ratio of powers contained in the in-phase components of the received
multipath clusters to that of the quadrature phase components. Thus, the
cases η > 1 and η < 1 can be alternatively considered by the values η and 1
η .

The improvement of the SER results is on the account of the fact that higher
values of η for η > 1 indicate more severe fading conditions. However, the com-
plete range of values of η from η = 1 to η = 0 is equivalent to modeling the
range of fading channel conditions that vary from µ to µ/2 (for uniform phase
coeﬃcients). From the physical model, η = 0 means no power in quadrature
phase component and the number of clusters gets automatically reduced to
half the number that exists for η = 1. The distribution of phase in both cases
no longer remains the same. However, this explanation is good for presenting
an analogy.
The error performance is also studied for diﬀerent values of µ and keeping
η = 0.25 ﬁxed. The results of SER of spatial multiplexing systems over η-µ
fading channels with QPSK modulation scheme and 2 × 2 MIMO systems are
shown in Figure 3.6. To study the eﬀect of variation in the values of µ on
the SER performance, in this case, the SER results are obtained for various
values of µ ranging from 2 to 10. It is observed that the SER performance
shows slight degradation when the values of µ are increased. Again, to explain
this behavior of SER performance, note that rich scattering (severe fading)
environment for MIMO systems for better performance is required. As the
value of µ increases, the fading severity decreases as µ →∞is the special case
which models non-fading environments. Thus, higher values of µ means less
severe fading and degraded SER performance. Looking at Figure 3.6 closely, it

78
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
can be observed that in the lower SNR conditions, the SER performance trend
is diﬀerent than that in the higher SNR conditions. It seems that the SER
performance is the same for all µ values for SNR <10 dB. But, in actuality, this
performance shows a similar trend as was discussed in the case of Nakagami-m
fading channels. The SER performance in low SNR regions is dominated by
the noise rather than the severity of fading. There is slight variation in the
SER performance for diﬀerent values of µ in a low SNR case. This observation
is the same as in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 for Nakagami-m fading channels.
For the same reason, a region is marked by a circle to indicate the crossing
points in SER curves in Figure 3.6.
3.6
Spatial multiplexing over κ −µ fading channels
So far, it is clear that a straightforward approach for obtaining analytical
expressions for various performance metrics for spatially multiplexed MIMO
systems over generalized fading channels does not exist. This is mainly because
of the interference among the signals transmitted from multiple antennas.
Analytical approaches to obtain expressions for the performance metrics for
spatially multiplexed MIMO systems involve a complex process of ﬁnding
PDF of the received eﬀective SNR. This is because of multiple scaling and
summation operations involved collectively at the transmitter, receiver and in
the channel. However, if a reader is interested in obtaining an expression, it
can be done in the ways discussed for Nakagami-m and η −µ fading channels
in the previous sections of this chapter. Again, to get an idea of the PDF of
in-phase and quadrature phase envelopes of κ−µ distributed fading envelope,
let us refer to the physical model given by equation (2.34),
X2 =
n
X
i=0

(Ii + pi)2 + (Qi + qi)2
(3.19)
From the above expression, it can be observed that the square of in-phase
and quadrature phase envelopes is a summation of squared Gaussian random
variables with non-zero mean. So, square of both these envelopes can be as-
sumed to follow non-central chi-squared distribution, each with µ/2 degrees
of freedom. Further, this can be used to obtain the PDF of the received signal
at each antenna without noise which is required to average the conditional
probability of error given by the following expression:

Averaging the above expression gives average pairwise error probability. Fur-
ther, using union bound on the pairwise error probability of all possible com-
binations, SER can be obtained.
Now, we will discuss some of the simulation results for error performance of
spatially multiplexed MIMO systems over κ−µ fading channels. The eﬀect of
fading parameter values on the SER performance will be discussed by studying
the variation in SER performance with the variation of fading parameters.
The SER results from simulation of spatial multiplexing MIMO systems
over κ −µ fading channels are plotted for various values of κ in Figure 3.7
with µ = 6 and Figure 3.8 with µ = 2. For these simulations 2 × 2 MIMO
systems and the QPSK modulation scheme are considered. So, the achieved
spectral eﬃciency is 4 bits/s/Hz by transmitting two symbols of two bits
simultaneously from two antennas at the transmitter. In both ﬁgures, it is
observed that the SER performance degrades with increasing values of κ.
Increasing values of κ indicates stronger LOS components in the received
signal clusters. This reduces the amount of scattering. Hence, the performance
degradation is justiﬁed by reduced scattering with stronger LOS component
for higher values of κ.
Note that in Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8, the value of κ is varying from 0
to 20. There is an interesting observation while moving from low SNR regime
to high SNR regime. For µ = 6, the SER curves for low SNR conditions are

almost overlapping with very small variation, while we can observe a diﬀerent
trend for the case of µ = 2. For the case of µ = 2, the SER performance is
better for higher values of κ for low SNR cases. In this case, the eﬀect of noise
dominates the degradation in performance because of reduction in the fading
severity due to stronger LOS components with increasing values of κ. While
in the case of µ = 6, the reduction in severity of fading is not only because
of stronger LOS component but also due to higher number of clusters in the
received signal (larger value of µ accounts for less severe fading). Similarly,
crossing of SER corves while moving from low SNR conditions to high SNR
conditions is observed in the case of η −µ and Nakagami-m fading channels
too. But, in the case of Nakagami-m and η −µ fading case, the observations
were taken by varying the values of m and µ respectively.
To observe the variation of SER with diﬀerent values of κ and µ in high
SNR and low SNR regimes, the results are obtained and plotted in Figure 3.9
and Figure 3.10 for high SNR conditions (SNR = 16 dB and 20 dB) and for
low SNR conditions (SNR = 4 dB and 8 dB) respectively. To obtain these
SER results, we considered a 2 × 2 spatial multiplexing MIMO system with
QPSK modulation scheme. The SER values are plotted by varying κ from 0
to 20 for two values of µ, µ = 2 and µ = 6 for both, the low SNR case and
the high SNR case. In these ﬁgures, a degradation in the SER performance
can be observed for higher values of µ and κ in general. However, in low

SNR conditions, the SER performance shows an improvement with increasing
strength of LOS component. But, at high SNR conditions, an increase in SER
is observed while moving from µ = 2 to µ = 6 for all values of κ from 0 to
20. And for a given value of µ and SNR, the SER is increasing with higher
values of κ. For low SNR conditions, an improvement in SER is observed for
initial increase in the values of κ for µ = 2. Then, it becomes constant. In low
SNR conditions, even an improvement in the SER performance is observed
with stronger LOS component, although only for lower values of κ.

Spatial multiplexing over α −µ fading channels
Our discussions in the previous sections of this chapter consider homogeneous
and non-homogeneous fading environments. None of these fading distribution
models including Nakagami-m, κ −µ and η −µ distributions consider non-
linearities in the fading environments. α −µ fading channel models take care
of non-linearities in fading environments. The physical model of α −µ fading
channels relates the fading signal amplitude, X, by equation (2.45) discussed

The diﬀerence of powers on the right-hand side and the left-hand side of the
above expression adds complexities in obtaining expressions for the PDFs of
in-phase components and the quadrature components of the fading envelope.
This had been less complex for the cases of Nakagami-m, κ −µ and η −µ
fading channel models. Now, we will discuss the eﬀect of non-linearities in the
fading environment on the SER performance of spatial multiplexing MIMO
systems.
To discuss the eﬀects of fading parameter values on SER performance, a
2×2 MIMO system is considered with BPSK and QPSK modulation schemes.
Simulations are performed for various cases which are discussed as follows.
The ﬁrst case considers a 2 × 2 spatially multiplexed MIMO system with
BPSK modulation over α −µ fading channels. We begin the discussion with
increasing values of α for a constant value of µ (µ = 2 in this case). It is already
discussed that the parameter α is introduced to model the non-linearities in
the fading environment. The SER results are shown in Figure 3.11. In this case,
we considered the variation of α in-between 0.5 and 1.7. An improvement in

the SER performance is observed with increasing values of α. As α approaches
2, the scattering environment approaches homogeneous [90].
Further, we consider variation of the parameter µ to observe its eﬀect
on the SER performance. In Figure 3.12, the SER results can be observed for
diﬀerent values of µ ranging from 2 to 20. Note that for this case, we considered
a 2 × 2 spatially multiplexed MIMO system with QPSK modulation scheme.
Figure 3.12 shows results for α = 2. The observations in this case can be
explained in the same manner as in the case of Nakagami-m fading channels.
The case that α = 2 is a special case of α −µ fading scenario that models the
fading environment as Nakagami-m fading distribution. Thus, for this case, the
observations are the same as those in the Nakagami-m fading case for diﬀerent
values of m. A degradation in the SER is observed with higher values of µ.
Again, a crossover in the SER curves is observed while moving from low SNR
regions to high SNR regions, indicating dominance of noise over the fading
environment for low SNR conditions.
Performance of spatially multiplexed MIMO systems over a non-linear fad-
ing environment is also studied for α = 3. For this case also, we consider a
2 × 2 spatially multiplexed MIMO system with QPSK modulation scheme.
The SER performance is plotted for diﬀerent values of µ and α = 3 in Figure
3.13. In this case also a crossover in SER curves is observed while moving from
low SNR regions to high SNR regions. But, comparing the two ﬁgures (Figure

3.13 and Figure 3.12) minutely, it can be observed that the variation of SER
for diﬀerent values of µ is less for α = 3 in low SNR conditions as compared
to that for α = 2.
Finally, the eﬀect of variation in non-linearity of fading environment on
SER performance is shown in Figure 3.14. Again, a 2 × 2 MIMO system
with spatial multiplexing is considered. The SER curves are plotted for BPSK
modulation with µ = 2 and diﬀerent values of α ranging from 0.5 to 8. From
the ﬁgure, it is observed that SER performance shows an improvement with
increasing values of α initially. Then, after reaching a minimum value, SER
starts increasing with increased values of α. It is interesting to observe that the
minima of SER with respect to α for diﬀerent SNR values occur at diﬀerent
values of α. This is mainly due to diﬀerent dominance levels of noise at diﬀerent
levels of non-linearities in the fading environments. To explain the behavior of
SER with increasing values of α, consider the expression for envelope of the
received signal over α −µ fading channels. It is given by

Note that both of them are hypothetical cases. But, it is helpful to consider
them to explain the SER behavior with the non-linearity parameter, α.
• For α = 0, the envelope can be described by the form X =
0√
R or X = R∞.
In this case, the envelope can have two values.
– For R > 1, the envelope values will be ∞.
– For R < 1, the envelope values will be 0.
The eﬀect of this on signal transmission is as follows. When R > 1, signal
strength will be very high (equivalent to no fading and inﬁnite channel gain),
while no signal will reach the receiver if R < 1, i.e., only noise is received
because the channel coeﬃcient is 0.
• For α = ∞, the envelope can be described by the form X =
∞√
R or X = R0.
This means for any value of R, the fading signal envelope will be unity. This
case represents the condition equivalent to no fading. This means all the
transmitted signals reach the receiver with equal strength.
So, in the case of α = 0, the signals are received either with very high
strength or no signal is received. In this case, it is obvious that the detection
will be erroneous. In fact, both the cases, no signal and signals with high
strength, are undesirable in MIMO systems with spatial multiplexing. This is

because of the fact that detection of spatially multiplexed systems is eﬀective
in a rich scattering environment. This accounts for higher SER values for lower
values of alpha as observed in Figure 3.14.
In the case of α = ∞, the signals from all the transmitter antennas reach
the receiver with equal amplitudes. In fact, all the channel coeﬃcients become
unity in this case representing a situation that there is no fading in the channel.
This case is already discussed in Section 1.3 of Chapter 1. It has been already
discussed that if all the channel coeﬃcients are unity, there are chances of
erroneous detection even in the case of noiseless systems. Thus, an increase in
the SER values for higher values of α as observed in Figure 3.14 is justiﬁed.

Introduction
Spatial modulation (SM) systems have become popular mainly because of
their reduced hardware and detection complexity. We have already discussed
in Chapter 1 that, in SM systems, a single antenna is made active for trans-
mission. This has advantages like requirement of single radio frequency (RF)
chain, no need of inter-antenna synchronization, inherent avoidance of inter-
antenna interference, etc. The hardware at the transmitter is simpliﬁed to a
great extent due to employment of a single RF chain. RF chains are very bulky
hardware which are comprised of ampliﬁers, (analog to digital converter/digi-
tal to analog converter)ADC/DACs, ﬁlters, modulators, etc. This reduction in
hardware complexity is important specially for mobile devices. Even though
(very large scale integration)VLSI technologies have been so advanced that
most hardware is in the form of integrated circuits with considerably smaller
sizes and weights but at the RF level, multiple RF chains make the hardware
very bulky for mobile devices.
SM systems have been widely studied by several researchers across the
globe. Especially with the advancement of multiple-input multiple-output
87

88
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
(MIMO) systems and the proposal of large MIMO systems [19], SM has been
viewed as one of the promising technologies for implementing large MIMO
systems with reduced hardware and computational complexity [64]. The com-
putational complexity of SM systems is already compared with various existing
technologies. It is claimed that SM systems are computationally eﬃcient as
far as detection is concerned and they perform better than other competitive
techniques [77]. Performance of SM systems has already been studied over
various fading channels including Nakagami-m fading channels and η −µ fad-
ing channels [5, 32, 33, 57, 75]. Further, various detection methods have also
been proposed with reduced computational complexity in detection at the
receiver [65,100,130,144,145].
In this chapter, we will discuss SM systems in detail. We will discuss about
its spectral eﬃciency, diversity order and detection complexity. Further, per-
formance of SM systems over various generalized fading channels will be dis-
cussed. In this book, we will mainly focus on the bit error rate/symbol error
rate (BER/SER) of SM systems.
4.2
SM transmission reception schemes
Chapter 1 briefed about the transmission and reception schemes being used
in SM. SM is a transmission scheme for MIMO systems that uses single an-
tenna at a time at the transmitter. As a result, SM MIMO systems may
be thought of as MIMO systems that are converted to single-input multiple-
output (SIMO) systems. It is made clear that a part of the incoming sequence
of bits is mapped to a transmit antenna index and the antenna corresponding
to that index is used for transmission. For an Nt × Nr MIMO system with
SM transmission, the number of bits that can be mapped to an antenna index
is given as na = ⌊log2 Nt⌋. Each group of na number of bits mapped to an
antenna index is thought of as if coming from a set of constellation points
known as spatial constellation. This adds to the spectral eﬃciency of digitally
modulated symbols. In general, a digitally modulated symbol can transmit
ns = log2 M number of bits per channel use per unit bandwidth. Each group
of ns number of digitally modulated symbols are coming from signal constel-
lation and are physically transmitted. Eﬀectively in an SM MIMO system, by
physical transmission of a symbol from signal constellation, na + ns number
of bits are transmitted per channel use per unit bandwidth. It is important to
note here that the number of spatially modulated bits, na = ⌊log2 Nt⌋, actu-
ally puts a restriction on SM MIMO systems that the number of antennas at
the transmitter has to be integer power of 2. Otherwise, it may happen that
the system never uses Nt −2⌊log2 Nt⌋antennas for transmission and the extra
antennas at transmitter become redundant. This restriction on the number of
antennas at transmitter is actually taken care of by the proposal of general-

ized spatial modulation (GSM) which we will discuss in brief at the end of
this chapter [143].
We refer to equation (1.22) for transmitted vector for SM MIMO systems.
It can be given as follows when the spatial constellation point is mapped with
the kth transmit antenna and the digitally modulated symbol, xq, is to be

where x is the transmitted vector and xq is the digitally modulated symbol

symbol vector has all zeros except at the kth position. In other words, the kth
position contains digitally modulated symbol xq. Thus, the received signal
vector for such SM MIMO systems can be given as

Given that the transmitted symbol vector, x contains all zeros except at
the kth position, the expression for received vector can be simpliﬁed as follows.

(4.3)
where hk is the kth column of the channel matrix H. So, the processes of
transmission and reception are based on vector operations instead of matrix
operations as in spatial multiplexing systems. This has an important role
in computational complexity of the detection process which we are going to

For SM reception, we consider here optimal detection which is the maxi-
mum likelihood (ML) detection rule for joint detection of antenna index (spa-
tially modulated bits) and digitally modulated symbol. The optimal detection

In the above expression, analyzing the number of complex multiplica-
tions required to detect a symbol, the detection complexity may be given
as 2NrNt + NtM + M [53]. This detection complexity is considerably less
than the detection complexity of equation (3.10). The detection complexity
of SM MIMO systems with optimal detection is discussed and compared with
sub-optimal detection in [53,77]. It is claimed that the detection complexity
of optimal detection is comparable to that of sub-optimal detection. However,
the performance of the optimal detection scheme is much better than that of
sub-optimal detection in unconstrained channels.

Performance analysis of SM MIMO systems
In this section, we will discuss various performance parameters of SM MIMO
systems over fading channels. Further, we will analyze various performance
metrics over generalized fading channels. The main performance metrics of
any wireless communication systems are: outage probability, BER/SER and
channel capacity. The performance metrics can be evaluated analytically and
through simulations as well. Simulations and analytical evaluations have their
own limitations. We will discuss the procedure to evaluate these metrics an-
alytically in the following subsections. In some cases, it may be diﬃcult to
arrive at a closed form expression for these performance metrics.

4.3.1
Outage probability
We already discussed in the previous section that the index of antenna trans-
mitting information is also estimated at the receiver. However, this part con-
tributes a little to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level of the received signal
for a system in which all the symbols are equally likely. The contribution to
SNR due to antenna index is only in the form of the channel coeﬃcients corre-
sponding to that antenna, which are anyway not aﬀecting much because they
are independent and follow the same distribution for independent and iden-
tically distributed (i.i.d.) channels. A communication system is said to be in
outage when the SNR level at the receiver falls below a certain threshold value
and correct detection of signal may not be possible at these low SNR levels.
This results in a large number of bits/symbols received in error making the
system unreliable. In general, outage probability of a wireless communication
systems is deﬁned as the probability that the instantaneous SNR is less than a
certain value, say, threshold SNR, γth. Mathematically, it can be represented
as
Pout(γth, γ) = P(γ < γth)
(4.5)
where Pout is the outage probability, γ is the instantaneous SNR at the receiver
and γ is the average received SNR.
In the case of SM MIMO systems, the received signal can be given as
r = hkx + n
(4.6)
This is similar to the received signal for diversity combining schemes. In the
above expression, signal part is characterized by hkx and the noise part is
n. So, instantaneous ratio of the overall received signal power and the total
noise power can be considered. However, this can be further simpliﬁed for
independent channels in terms of SNR per branch at the receiver. For mutu-
ally independent channel coeﬃcients, the total received signal power can be
obtained as the sum of powers of received signals at the individual receiver
antennas. Thus, it is valid to consider SNR per receiver antenna. Once we ob-
tain the instantaneous SNR at the receiver and its probability density function
(PDF), the outage probability can be given as
Pout(γth, γ) =
Z γth
0
pγ(x)dx
(4.7)
where pγ(·) is the PDF of the received instantaneous SNR. So, outage proba-
bility is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of instantaneous received
SNR.
4.3.2
Symbol error rate
When the signal travels through channel, in addition to fading, it also gets
aﬀected by the noise. Usually, the noise is considered as a collective eﬀect of

92
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
the thermal noise generated at various levels in the system. This noise, in most
cases, can be modeled as random noise with Gaussian distribution with zero
mean, also known as additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) because of its
additive nature and equal power spectral density at all the frequencies. Now
onward, such channels are referred to as noisy channels. In noisy channels,
not all the transmitted symbols can be detected correctly at the receiver. In
communications with only signal constellation, i.e., with transmission schemes
having only digitally modulated symbols, any amount of added noise shifts the
position of constellation point from its original location. This shift depends
on the amount of noise that is being added. Because of this, many times it
happens that the noise is so large that the constellation point moves into the
decision boundary of a neighboring constellation point other than the actually
transmitted symbol. In such systems, the received symbol is detected based
on the minimum distance of the received noisy constellation point from the
actual set of constellation points. It is equivalent to the condition that the
constellation plane is divided into regions and each region corresponds to a
constellation point. The received noisy symbol is then marked on this constel-
lation plane with regions and the decision is taken in favor of a constellation
point if the received symbol falls in its region.
In SM MIMO systems, the detection process is slightly diﬀerent from other
communication systems described earlier. In SM MIMO systems, in addition
to the signal constellation, we also have constellation points in the spatial
domain which are mapped with the indices of transmitting antennas. So, the
distance of received noisy symbol is required to be minimized jointly with
respect to the signal constellation and the spatial constellation. The rule for
this minimization has been the decision criteria for a received symbol that is
spatially modulated in SM MIMO systems. The rule is given as
{ˆj, xˆq} = arg min
j,q
∥r −hjxq ∥2
= arg min
j,q
∥hjxq ∥2 −2Re{hH
j rx∗
q}
(4.8)
Now, occurrence of error in this case is deﬁned as the event that any
of the two, digitally modulated symbol or the spatially modulated data, is
detected incorrectly. However, the above expression is for joint detection of
antenna index and the digitally modulated symbol. So, in our discussion an
SM symbol would be collectively the antenna index (spatial constellation) and
the digitally modulated symbol (signal constellation). In this case, probability
of error can be obtained by ﬁrst evaluating pairwise error probability and
then averaging the set of pairwise error probabilities for all possible pairs of
symbols. To deﬁne pairwise error probability, we ﬁrst deﬁne an SM symbol as
xSM(i) = {xa(i), xs(i)}, where xa(i) is the group of bits that are mapped to
antenna index of a transmitter antenna and xs(i) is the group of bits that are
transmitted using digital modulation techniques. Now, an SM symbol is said
to be received in error if any of xa(i) or xs(i) is detected incorrectly at the
receiver.

Spatial Modulation
93
Let us deﬁne an event that symbol xSM(i) is transmitted and symbol
xSM(j) is detected. The probability of occurrence of such an event is known
as pairwise error probability and denoted as P(xSM(i) →xSM(j)). In other
terms, occurrence of error is denoted by
P(xSM(j, xq) →xSM(ˆj, xˆq)) = P

∥r −hˆjxˆq ∥2≤∥r −hjxq ∥2
P(xSM(j, xq) →xSM(ˆj, xˆq)) = P(∥hˆjxˆq ∥2 −2Re{hH
ˆj rx∗
ˆq}
≤∥hjxq ∥2 −2Re{hH
j rx∗
q})
(4.9)
where ˆj and xˆq are respectively the estimated antenna index and the detected
symbol at receiver when antenna index j was used at transmitter and the
symbol xq was transmitted actually. According to the above expressions, the
correct decision is taken at the receiver only in the case that the received vector
has the minimum Euclidean distance from the actual transmitted symbols
(both spatial and signal constellations) compared to all other possible symbols.
Otherwise, the symbols are received in error. For an SM MIMO system with
Nt number of transmitter antennas and M-ary modulation scheme, the total
number of pairs formed is (MNt −1)!.
Overall, probability of a symbol received in error can be obtained by ap-
plying union bound on the individual pairwise error probability [28, 101]. It
can be given as
Pe ≤
X
j,q
P(xSM(j, xq) →xSM(ˆj, xˆq))
(4.10)
Again, this probability of symbol error is a function of fading channel coeﬃ-
cients. Thus, to ﬁnd average probability of symbol error or often referred to
as SER, it is required to be averaged over the PDF of channel coeﬃcients.
4.3.3
Channel capacity
Channel capacity is another metric that can help to determine the quality
of a wireless communication link. Channel capacity gives the maximum rate
at which transmission can be done with reliable performance, i.e., suﬃciently
low probabilities of error. Any rates of transmission higher than the channel
capacity results in higher probability of error and the communication link
becomes unreliable. The channel capacity is usually deﬁned as follows.
C = B log2(1 + SNR)
(4.11)
Lower capacity indirectly means either of two possibilities. 1) The coherence
bandwidth of the channel has been reduced or 2) the SNR at receiver has been
reduced to a very low value because of fading. Now, in the case of fading chan-
nels, the SNR is not constant. SNR in case of fading channels is deﬁned as the
instantaneous SNR following some kind of fading statistics. Correspondingly,

94
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
instantaneous channel capacity is deﬁned for the instantaneous SNR. So, the
average channel capacity has to be evaluated by averaging the instantaneous
capacity over the PDF of instantaneous SNR.
In case of SM MIMO systems, not all information is transmitted physi-
cally. So, the capacity evaluated using the expression above only relates to
the bits/information that is physically transmitted. The information of trans-
mit antenna index is carried along with the transmitted symbol without de-
manding extra channel capacity. Thus, in SM MIMO at some instances, the
information is actually transmitted at rates beyond the channel capacity. This
gives advantages in overall spectral eﬃciency of the system. So, SM MIMO
systems employ a transmission strategy which enables transmissions at rates
beyond the channel capacity.
4.4
Performance of SM systems over Nakagami-m fading
channels
In this section, we consider performance of SM MIMO systems over Nakagami-
m fading channels. We will discuss the results of simulations for various perfor-
mance metrics of SM MIMO wireless communication systems. We will begin
the discussion with some insights to analytical methods for evaluation of dif-
ferent performance metrics of SM MIMO systems. We begin with the outage
probability analysis of SM MIMO systems over Nakagami-m fading channels.
As we proceed, we will discuss about SER and channel capacity of SM MIMO
systems over Nakagami-m fading channels.
4.4.1
Outage probability
In Section 4.3.1, we discussed that outage probability is the CDF of received
instantaneous SNR. To evaluate outage probability, we ﬁrst need to have sta-
tistical information about the received signal and the instantaneous SNR. In
SM MIMO systems, the instantaneous SNR depends on the channel coeﬃ-
cients of the channel matrix corresponding to the transmit antenna which
is selected for transmission of information. The instantaneous SNR can be
obtained from the received signal. The received signal is random in nature
mainly because of the noise that is added at various stages of signal process-
ing and the fading that resulted due to mobile environment. The system under
consideration has AWGN and Nakagami-m fading. So, the noise is Gaussian
distributed. To get instantaneous SNR and its statistics, we need to have
statistics of signal part in the received signal vector. The statistics of received
signal in SM systems is similar to that of received signals in maximal ratio
combining (MRC) techniques.

4.4.2
Symbol error rate
Symbol error rate gives the fraction of information received in error. It is an
important metric that deﬁnes the quality of wireless communication link. The
information about SER can be helpful in deciding the modulation order in
the adaptive modulation systems [21,104]. There are adaptive systems for SM
MIMO too that use the information about channel conditions and the SER to
decide the modulation orders [140]. In fact the SER is mainly dependent upon
the channel conditions. If the channels are highly faded, very less signal power
is received. This results in increased SER. This SER also depends on the mini-
mum separation between two points on the constellation diagram. We already
discussed in Chapter 1 that higher order modulation schemes can improve
the transmission rates but as we move to higher order modulation schemes,
the minimum distance between two constellation points reduces. This reduced
distance between constellation points increases the probability of making er-
ror at the receiver while detecting symbols in the noisy environment. In SM
MIMO systems, the error in detection at the receiver can be either in the an-
tenna index or in the digitally modulated symbol. However, we have discussed
joint detection of antenna index and digitally modulated symbols. So, joint
probability of error would be evaluated in this case.
To evaluate probability of error analytically, let us assume that an SM
symbol consisting of the antenna index j and the digitally modulated symbol
xq is transmitted. Due to noise and fading, it is detected in error as the
transmit antenna index ˆj and digitally modulated symbol xˆq. In this case, the
complete SM symbol is said to have received in error even if either the antenna
index or the digitally modulated symbol is received in error. The reason is that
at the receiver the information is processed in the form of SM symbols and
not the individual units like antenna index and digitally modulated symbols
or the individual bits. Again, we considered joint detection of antenna index
and digitally modulated symbol while discussing the detection of SM symbols
at the receiver. So, we will discuss pairwise error probability for joint detection
of SM MIMO symbols over Nakagami-m fading channels. It can be given by
P(xSM(j, xq) →xSM(ˆj, xˆq)) = P

∥r −hˆjxˆq ∥2≤∥r −hjxq ∥2
(4.12)
The above expression can be represented in the form of Frobenius norm. From
the fact that norm is a positive real number, the above condition on the
squared norms holds true even for the Frobenius norms. So, the pairwise error
probability can be given as
P(xSM(j, xq) →xSM(ˆj, xˆq)) = P

∥r −hˆjxˆq ∥F ≤∥r −hjxq ∥F

(4.13)
where ∥· ∥F represents Frobenius norm of a vector.

96

Now, substituting the values of received vector from expression of equation
(4.3), the expression for pairwise error probability can be simpliﬁed to

∥hjxq+n−hˆjxˆq∥F ≤∥hjxq+n−hjxq∥F

and it is conditioned on the channel matrix, H. This conditional pairwise er-
ror probability needs to be averaged over the PDF of the random variable
which is a function of channel coeﬃcients of jth column and ˆjth column of
channel matrix. The function may be represented as k =
hjxq−hˆjxˆq

. To
evaluate the average pairwise error probability, we need to derive PDF of k
using the information that each element of hj and hˆj is independent and iden-
tically distributed Nakagami-m random variable. For a particular pair of SM
symbols, xq and xˆq may be considered as complex constants (having real and
imaginary parts) that do scaling of the corresponding channel coeﬃcients. For
the statistical analysis of k, we represent the diﬀerence vector in a simpliﬁed
way as follows.

where aR and aI are respectively the vectors of real and imaginary components

The above expression can be further simpliﬁed as

norm of the diﬀerence vector. Let us proceed with the consideration of the real
part of the diﬀerence vector,


R, to begin with. It is a diﬀerence
of two random variable terms. The ﬁrst term consists of the column of channel
matrix corresponding to the transmit antenna used for spatial constellation
and the part of actual symbol transmitted, while the later consists of a col-
umn of channel matrix corresponding to the transmit antenna erroneously
estimated at receiver from spatial constellation and the part of the symbol
detected at the receiver.

98
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
To describe the method for obtaining the PDF of the diﬀerence vector, let
us assume that the system uses one dimensional constellation, i.e., only real
valued digitally modulated symbols. Despite the real valued signal constella-
tions, the diﬀerence vector still would have the non-zero imaginary components
on account of reﬂected multipaths having diﬀerent phases, i.e., the complex
channel coeﬃcients. But, for real valued signal constellations, the real part
of the diﬀerence vector would reduce to

hjxq−hˆjxˆq

R = hjRxq −hˆjRxˆq.
Each element of this diﬀerence vector is a combination of two scaled random
variables with the scaling factors xq and xˆq respectively. Each element of the
diﬀerence vector can therefore be considered of the form aX1 −bX2 with a
and b as the scaling factors of variables X1 and X2 respectively. The PDF of
a scaled random variable sX in general can be given as

F , is a random variable
that is the sum of random variables which are obtained as a result of scaling,
diﬀerence and square operations. The PDF of the resulting squared norm can
be obtained using the relations of transformation of random variables and
the concepts of functions of random variables. Note that once PDF of either
(hiRxq −hˆiRxˆq)2 or (hiIxq −hˆiIxˆq)2 is obtained, the method of moment
generating function (MGF) can also be used to obtain the MGF of resultant
squared norm. The ﬁnal MGF can be used to evaluate average pairwise error
probability.
Further, we discuss the results obtained from MATLAB® simulation of SM
systems over Nakagami-m fading channels. For the simulation, we considered
a 4×2 SM MIMO system with quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modula-
tion. This results in the transmission of 4 bits/s/Hz, 2 bits/s/Hz using digital
modulation and 2 bits/s/Hz using spatial modulation for four transmitter an-
tennas. Results are shown in Figure 4.1 for diﬀerent values of fading parameter,
m. It can be observed that the SER performance degrades for higher values of
fading parameter, m. This degradation is on account of reduced variability of
the fading coeﬃcients for higher values of m which results in lower values of
the squared norm of diﬀerence vector

hjxq−hˆjxˆq

. Also, the higher values
of m move the channel environment toward non-fading conditions (m →∞
models non-fading case). Thus, detection becomes more erroneous for higher
values of fading parameter, m, of Nakagami-m fading channels.

Error performance of SM systems over κ −µ fading
channels
Nakagami-m fading channels consider the received signal to be coming in the
form of clusters of multipath components with equal strengths. In κ−µ fading
channel model, a dominant component is assumed to be a part of every cluster
of multipath components. Thus, κ−µ fading model is more suitable to model
the fading environments with possibility of direct line of sight (LOS) path
from transmitter to receiver. The analytical evaluation of error performance
can be done exactly by following the steps that are discussed in the case of
error performance of SM MIMO systems over Nakagami-m fading channel that
is discussed in the previous section. It involves transformation of the in-phase
and quadrature phase components of the received signal by scaling followed
by other basic operations (like diﬀerence, squaring and adding) on them. This
gives us a new random variable which is the squared norm of the diﬀerence
vector. It is given as

In the following discussions of this section, we will discuss the eﬀect of
fading parameters, κ and µ, on the SER performance of SM MIMO systems.
Eventually the eﬀect of stronger LOS components on SER will also be dis-
cussed. MATLAB script ﬁle for simulation of SM MIMO systems and MAT-
LAB function to generate κ −µ distributed channel coeﬃcients are given at
the end of this book in Appendix B. They can be used to obtain SER re-
sults of SM MIMO systems over various fading channels using appropriate
values of fading coeﬃcients and suitable modulation schemes for any number
of transmitter and receiver antennas.
A 4 × 2 SM MIMO system with QPSK modulation is simulated for its
SER performance over κ −µ fading channels. The SER results are obtained
for various values of fading parameter µ and two values of κ, κ = 0 (no LOS
component) and κ = 20 (strong LOS component). For both these cases, results
are shown in Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 respectively. SER for diﬀerent values

of µ ranging from 1 to 25 are shown for both the cases. It is observed that the
SER performance degrades as the value of µ increases in both the cases (strong
LOS and non-LOS). However, an interesting observation is that for κ = 0, the
degradation in SER is low for initial increment in the values of µ while it is
opposite for the case of κ = 20. For example, in Figure 4.2, it is observed
that the SER curves for µ = 1 and µ = 3 are almost overlapped and for
further increment in the values of µ increase the gap between successive SER
curves, while in Figure 4.3, the observation is just opposite. The gap between
successive SER curves decreases for higher values of µ. It is maximum between
the SER curves for µ = 1 and µ = 3 for κ = 20. This is because the variability
of the power of channel coeﬃcients reduces for higher values of κ and µ. In the
strong LOS case, the reduction in variability is already introduced by a large
LOS factor, κ; further reduction in variability because of µ reduces for higher
values of µ and this is reﬂected in the SER curves in Figure 4.3. Further, when
κ →∞and/or µ →∞, the channel becomes a non-fading AWGN channel
for which all the fading coeﬃcients are unity (no variation). The reduced
variability of fading coeﬃcients with increasing values of κ and/or µ is shown
in Figure 4.4.
Further, the results are plotted to see the degradation in SER performance
with increasing values of both µ and κ. In Figure 4.5, the SER results are
plotted by varying µ for diﬀerent values of κ and SNR. The values of µ are

considered in the range from 0.5 to 25. The results are plotted for three values
of SNR, 8 dB, 20 dB and 24 dB. The only exceptional case observed is for
8 dB SNR and κ = 0. In this case, SER shows a small improvement for the
initial increase in the value of µ and then degrades slightly. This is because
of dominance of noise over fading conditions for low SNR regime. Similar
behavior has been observed in the case of Nakagami-m fading channels and
spatially multiplexed MIMO channels too, while for other cases, a degradation
is observed with increasing values of µ. The degradation is more for initial
increase in the values of µ and then SER becomes almost constant specially
for strong LOS cases (say for µ > 15 for SNR = 20 dB).

Error performance of SM systems over η −µ fading

In the case of Nakagami-m fading channels, we have discussed the method
to obtain required PDF for evaluation of average pairwise error probability
and the overall error performance of SM MIMO systems. Following the same
steps, an analytical expression for error performance of SM MIMO systems

over η −µ fading channels can be derived. In this section, we will discuss the
eﬀect of fading parameters, η and µ, on the SER performance of SM MIMO
systems. MATLAB script ﬁle for simulation of SM MIMO systems is given at
the end of this book in Appendix B. It can be used to obtain SER results of
SM MIMO systems over various fading channels using appropriate function
to generate fading channel coeﬃcients.
In this section, we will consider 2×2 SM MIMO systems with QPSK mod-
ulation scheme for diﬀerent values of fading parameters, η and µ. We consider
diﬀerent values of η in the range from 0.01 to 1 and three values of µ, µ = 0.5,
µ = 2.5 and µ = 5. The results for three cases are shown respectively in
Figure 4.6, Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8. The variation in SER performance for
decreasing values of η is found diﬀerent for µ = 0.5 than that in the cases of
µ = 2.5 and µ = 5. µ = 0.5 represents the Hoyt fading channels as a special
case of η −µ fading. In this case (Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8), it is observed
that the SER performance degrades with increasing values of fading param-
eter η. Actually, increasing values of η for η < 1 represent less severe fading
and in general, the SER performance shall be better for less severe fading.
But, in SM MIMO systems, the antenna index corresponding to the trans-
mitter antenna is also a part of the information. Estimation of these spatially
modulated information bits requires severe fading to detect the information
more accurately. Thus, as in the case of spatial multiplexing MIMO systems,

dominance of noise over fading environment plays a role that deﬁnes variation
of SER with respect to changing values of fading parameters. In the case of
µ = 0.5, the fading is severe and detection of a digitally modulated symbol is
dominant over the detection of antenna index. Thus, SER performance of SM
MIMO systems degrades for lower values of η, while in the case of µ = 2.5 and
µ = 5, the situation is just opposite and hence the SER performance improves
with lower values of η. In addition to that, if we observe the SER for η = 1 at
some SNR (say 20 dB) in all three ﬁgures, it can be observed that the SER
performance degrades for increasing values of µ. This is again because of lower
variation in the fading coeﬃcients for higher values of µ.

Error performance of SM systems over α −µ fading

Non-linear fading environments are modeled well by α −µ distribution. So
far in this chapter, we have discussed the performance of SM MIMO systems
over fading channels including LOS and non-LOS fading environments. In this
section, we will discuss the SER performance of SM MIMO systems over α−µ

fading channels in which the fading parameter, α-accounts for non-linearity
of fading environment. So, this section will deal with the discussion on eﬀects
of non-linearity in the fading environment on the SER performance of SM
MIMO systems.
To discuss SER performance of SM MIMO systems and observe the eﬀect
of non-linearities in the fading environment, a 4 × 2 SM MIMO system is
simulated with 8-PSK modulation scheme. The SER results are shown for
µ = 2.5 in Figure 4.9 for 12 dB, 18 dB and 22 dB SNRs. An initial improvement
is observed in the SER performance with increasing values of α followed by
degradation in the SER for a given value of SNR. This indicates that there is
an optimum non-linearity for which SER is the minimum. Unlike in the case
of spatially multiplexed MIMO systems, the optimum value of α for minimum
SER value is almost constant and lies somewhere around α ≃1.5. This is
because both the extreme cases, α →0 and α →∞, approach the cases such
that the channel is deterministic or a non-fading case.
The eﬀect of µ on the SER performance of SM MIMO systems has been
discussed for the case of η −µ and κ −µ fading channels. And the way µ
is deﬁned is the same even for α −µ fading distribution. Thus, a similar
observation is seen in Figure 4.10. However, in this case, we have explicitly
marked the points of minimum SER for diﬀerent SNR values. It is observed
that the optimum value of µ for minimum SER is ≃1.5. Again, the variation

in SER with the values of µ is as expected. Initially, with increasing values of
µ, the SER performance improves and it degrades on further increase in the
values of µ. Note that for our observations in Figure 4.10, we kept α = 2 so
that the same results and observations are valid for κ−µ, η−µ and Nakagami-
m fading channels but with appropriate multiplying factor on the X-axis, i.e.,
the scaling of µ on account of diﬀerences in their physical model.
Further, we will discuss some aspects of generalized spatial modulation
which is an advanced form of spatial modulation.
4.8
Generalized spatial modulation
GSM is proposed to overcome the condition that the number of transmit-
ter antennas has to be an integer exponent of 2. In GSM, multiple antennas
are used to transmit a digitally modulated symbol. Diﬀerent combinations of
antennas at the transmitter side are mapped to spatial constellation points.
So, in GSM, with added complexity of hardware and computations at re-
ceiver, more gain in spectral eﬃciency is obtained. The transmission scheme
in GSM is similar to the transmission methodology of SM MIMO systems.

The diﬀerence is about mapping of spatial constellation points. In GSM, each
spatial constellation point is mapped to a combination of antennas available
at transmitter instead of single antenna in SM. Since multiple antennas are
transmitting simultaneously, the number of RF chains required in GSM is
more than that required in SM. SM required a single RF chain.
In general, for MIMO systems with Nt antennas at the transmitter and
Nrf number of RF chains, the total number of possible ways in which anten-
nas can be selected for transmission becomes NtCNrf . Let’s take an example
of the transmission strategy for GSM. Consider a MIMO system with ﬁve an-
tennas at the transmitter and assume that the transmitter has two RF chains,
i.e., the transmission can be done from two transmitting antennas simultane-
ously. In this case, the total number of possible combinations of two antennas
can be 5C2 = 10. But, not all 10 combinations of antennas can be used for
transmission. A particular combination of antennas is selected based on the
incoming sequence. So, as the required number of antennas at transmitter has
to be an integer exponent of 2 in SM, in GSM it is the number of combi-
nations of antennas that has to be an integer exponent of 2. Otherwise, all
possible combinations may not be used for transmission. In the case under
consideration, we have 10 possible ways of selecting two antennas out of ﬁve
total antennas. So, only eight of the combinations can be used for transmis-
sion. Again, there are algorithms to decide which combinations to use and

Spatial Modulation

which to omit. Once the antenna combinations are selected for transmission,
there can be two transmission strategies. One is to achieve better diversity
and the other is for better spectral eﬃciency. In the technique with better
diversity order, the same symbol from signal constellation is transmitted from
all the selected antennas while diﬀerent symbols from signal constellation are
transmitted from diﬀerent antennas to improve the spectral eﬃciency.

Introduction
Transmit antenna selection (TAS) systems have become popular mainly for
their reduced complexity of the system hardware and detection complexity.
We already discussed in Chapter 1 that in TAS systems, a single antenna
is made active for transmission at a given instant. This has advantages like
requirement of a single radio frequency (RF) chain, no need of inter antenna
synchronization, inherent avoidance of inter antenna interference, etc. The
hardware at the transmitter is simpliﬁed to a great extent due to the need
of a single RF chain which is very bulky hardware consisting of the setup of
ampliﬁers, ADC/DACs, ﬁlters, modulators, etc. This reduction in hardware
complexity is especially important as far as mobile devices are concerned.
Though VLSI technologies have been so advanced that most hardware is in
the form of integrated circuits with considerably small sizes and low weights,
even then at the RF level the number of RF chains makes the hardware very
bulky for the mobile devices. However, the bulky hardware may not be the
problem of that big concern at the base stations or the immobile control units
and the devices which do not belong to the family of hand-held devices.
TAS with maximal ratio combining at the receiver (TAS/MRC) has been
widely studied by the researchers across the globe. Especially, with advance-
ment of full duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and pro-
posal of large MIMO systems [19], TAS has been accepted as the promising
technology for implementation in large MIMO systems to achieve reduced
hardware and computational complexity [64]. The computational complex-
ity of TAS systems for detection at the receiver is the same as that for
the receiver diversity combining schemes. Apart from the detection com-
plexity, TAS systems have slightly more computational complexity which ac-
counts for the identiﬁcation of the antenna which is to be selected at the
transmitter. However, this added complexity pays in terms of diversity gain.
TAS systems are capable of achieving full diversity order. Performance of
TAS systems has already been studied over various fading channels including
Nakagami-m fading channels, κ −µ fading channels and η −µ fading chan-
nels, also taking the cases of multiuser environment and correlated fading
channels [14,15,24,25,49,56,74,79,95,96,126,129,138].
In this chapter, we will discuss TAS systems in detail with the explanations
on spectral eﬃciency, diversity order and detection complexity. Further, per-
formance of TAS systems with selection combining (SC) and MRC at receiver
over various generalized fading channels will be discussed. In this book, we
will mainly present the results and discussion on bit error rate/symbol error
rate (BER/SER) of TAS systems. Outage probability and ergodic capacity of
TAS systems over generalized fading channels will also be discussed.

Transmit Antenna Selection
113
5.2
Antenna selection criteria
The motivation behind transmit antenna selection in MIMO systems is to
achieve reduction in the hardware complexity of the system and computa-
tional complexity of the detector/receiver. We already discussed that this can
be achieved by selecting a reduced number of antennas at the transmitter
for parallel transmission of bitstreams. This will reduce the hardware require-
ment. This also simpliﬁes the detection process. Two commonly used metrics
for antenna selection at the transmitter are channel capacity and received sig-
nal power. Basically, the selection is based on maximization of the selected
metric. Maximization of received signal power is directly related to the instan-
taneous signal-to-noise (SNR). Selection of a subset of total available antennas
can be done at both the ends, the transmitter and the receiver or on either
side. But, in this chapter, the emphasis is on antenna selection at the transmit-
ter. The concern raised by researchers for antenna selection at the transmitter
is the requirement of feedback link either to transmit back the information
about the channel coeﬃcients or to transmit back the information about the
best antenna/the best set of antennas as per the chosen metric to be maxi-
mized. However, to our belief, feedback link is of less concern for full duplex
systems where both-way communication happens simultaneously. So, sending
the required information for antenna selection is not that diﬃcult.
5.2.1
Received power based antenna selection
For all our discussions, it is assumed that the energy per transmitted symbol
remains the same as long as the transmission continues. Also, it is assumed
that even if multiple antennas are selected at a time, all the selected trans-
mitter antennas are assigned equal power. Let’s assume that N antennas are
to be selected at the transmitter in an Nt × Nr MIMO system. This reduces
the original channel matrix of dimension Nr × Nt to Nr × N. In this case,
the antenna selection is done based on the combination that gives maximum
received energy per transmitted symbol. Pilot based single antenna selection
has been discussed in Chapter 1 (see Section 1.4.2). Here, we will discuss the
criteria for general antenna selection including multiple antenna selections. In
this case, the received signal becomes
r = Hrx + n
(5.1)
where Hr is the channel matrix with reduced dimensions and x is the pilot
signal vector transmitted for antenna selection. For each of the transmissions,
received energy is calculated and the combination of transmitter antennas for
which the maximum energy is received is selected for communication. In this
case, the number of combinations of transmitter antennas would be NtCN, as
the TAS system is assumed to select only N antennas out of Nt antennas at

114
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
the transmitter. Energy received per transmission can be given by Er = rHr.
This received energy is primarily dependent on HH
r Hr. This can be shown by
considering the case of a noise-free condition. In a noise-free case, the received
signal energy per transmission can be given by
Er = (Hrx)H Hrx
= xHHr
HHrx
(5.2)
where the pilot signal vector x is known at the receiver. This process facili-
tates the channel matrix estimation in addition to identiﬁcation of the best
combination of transmitter antennas.
Let C be the set of all possible reduced channel matrices. The antenna
selection criteria can be represented as
I = arg max
Hr,i∈C
n
Er,i = xHHr,i
HHr,ix
o
(5.3)
where I represents the combination of transmitter antennas for which the re-
ceived energy per transmission is the highest among all possible combinations
of N antennas out of a total Nt antennas. This antenna selection criteria can
be further simpliﬁed for single antenna selection at the transmitter. In this
case, the number of combinations of transmitter antennas would be NtC1 = Nt
as the TAS system is now assumed to select single antenna out of Nt antennas
at the transmitter. The pilot vector x would be reduced to a scaler pilot to
be transmitted from a single antenna at a time. Thus, the antenna selection
criteria on expression in equation (5.3) can be given as
I = arg max
Hr,i∈C
n
Er,i = x∗Hr,i
HHr,ix
o
(5.4)
Also, the reduced channel matrix Hr becomes a vector which is a column of
the channel matrix corresponding to the selected transmitting antenna. So,
the antenna selection criteria get further simpliﬁed. Now, it can be given as
follows.
I = arg max

where hi is the ith column of channel matrix. The above expression is the
same as what we discussed in Chapter 1 for antenna selection criteria with
MRC at receiver (see expression of equation (1.38)).
5.2.1.1
Norm based transmit antenna selection
The pilot based antenna selection needs to transmit pilot sequence for each
instant of antenna selection. In addition, pilot transmission is also required for

Transmit Antenna Selection
115
channel matrix estimation. The information of channel coeﬃcients is nonethe-
less required at the receiver while detecting the received symbol. So, to reduce
the transmission overhead and computations, antenna selection is done using
the channel matrix. This method is referred to as a norm based method for
TAS [22,139]. It uses the norm of columns of channel matrix as a parameter
for antenna selection. This involves calculation of norms of each column of
the channel matrix, then these norms are arranged in ascending order and
the antennas that correspond to the highest values of norms are selected for
transmission. The technique of norm based antenna selection too maximizes
the received signal power. But in this case, the power received from trans-
mission by a single antenna at a time is considered separately while the pilot
based selection discussed earlier maximizes the power received when all the
antennas to be selected are active. It shall be noted that for noiseless systems,
the pilot based antenna selection criteria for single TAS systems are exactly
the same as the norm based antenna selection. In general, selecting a single
antenna gives maximum beneﬁt in terms of reduction in hardware complexity
and reduction in computational complexity. So, norm based antenna selection
has become popular among the researchers. But with various transmission
strategies in MIMO systems, diﬀerent algorithms may be used for antenna
selections.
5.2.2
Capacity based antenna selection
Apart from received signal energy, the other criterion for antenna selection
is the channel capacity. Selecting antennas using maximum received energy
does not necessarily guarantee the highest channel capacity. As far as quality
of service (QoS) of communication systems is concerned, channel capacity is
an important parameter. The MIMO channel capacity when all transmit and
receive antennas are in operation is given by
CMIMO = log2 det
 INt + γHHH

(5.6)
where INt is the Nt × Nt identity matrix and γ is the instantaneous SNR.
But when antenna selection is done either at transmitter or receiver, the
matrix size gets reduced accordingly. In this case, we consider antenna se-
lection at the transmitter. While doing transmit antenna selection, we get
reduction in the number of columns of the channel matrix. As in the case of
received power based antenna selection (Section 5.2.1), we consider N anten-
nas to be selected at the transmitter out of a total of Nt transmitter antennas.
So, the number of possible ways in which antennas can be selected is given
as NtCN and the set of all possible combinations of antennas that may be se-
lected is represented as C. So, for the MIMO system under consideration, the
antenna selection criteria that maximize the channel capacity after antenna
selection can be given as follows.
I = arg max
Hr,i∈C

(5.7)

116
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
where IN, the N × N identity matrix for N antennas, are selected at the
transmitter. The above expression represents generalized criteria for antenna
selection to select any number of antennas at the transmitter, N < Nt. How-
ever, as discussed in earlier sections/chapters of this book, there are practical
challenges with MIMO systems when more than one antenna are selected
and transmitting simultaneously. This includes inter antenna interference, re-
quirements of transmit antenna synchronization and complexity of detection
process. All these problems mainly arise due to simultaneous transmission and
can be avoided if simultaneous transmission is avoided. Thus, it is a better
idea to select a single antenna at the transmitter. So, we take a special case
that single antenna is to be selected at the transmitter in the antenna selection
criteria given by the expression of equation (5.7). Again, in this case, C would
contain only Nt elements and the antenna selection criteria can be simpliﬁed
to
I = arg max
1≤i≤Nt

Ci = log2
 1 + γhH
i hi
	
(5.8)
where hi is the ith column of the channel matrix. Further, in the above expres-
sion, it can be noted that the capacity, Ci, contains logarithmic function and
1 + γhH
i hi as the argument of that logarithmic function. It can be maximized
by only maximizing the value of hH
i hi which is the same as maximizing the
squared Frobenius norm of ith column of the channel matrix, PNr
j=1 |hj,i|2,
i.e., the antenna selection criteria reduce to that given in expression of equa-
tion (5.5). This leads to an interesting fact that if a single transmit antenna
is selected at the transmitter using maximum received signal power, it auto-
matically maximizes the channel capacity. This may not be always true when
multiple antennas are selected at the transmitter.
5.3
TAS system model
A brief description of the TAS system model and the transmission scheme
is presented in Section 1.4.2 of Chapter 1. The antenna selection criteria for
maximum received useful power based TAS are explained by the expressions
of equation (1.37) and equation (1.38) for selection combining and MRC at
the receiver respectively. The frame structure for the channel estimation and
identiﬁcation of the antenna for maximum useful power based antenna selec-
tion at transmitter is given in Figure 1.9. The frame based pilot transmission
for TAS systems explained in Chapter 1 does not involve any role of chan-
nel matrix in selection of a transmit antenna. However, the antenna selection
criteria for selecting a single antenna eventually depends only on the channel
coeﬃcients and not on the symbols or sequence of symbols to be transmitted
if the system noise is ignored as shown in equation (5.5). In actuality, trans-
mitting a predeﬁned sequence from each antenna one by one and selecting a

transmit antenna selects the antenna including the eﬀect of noise (additive
white Gaussian noise [AWGN] in our case) which necessarily does not maxi-
mize the useful signal power all the time. So, most of the times, the decision
about the antenna that gives the maximum useful power is based on the norm
of the columns of channel matrix, H. This method of antenna selection is also
referred to as norm based transmit antenna selection by researchers [22,139].
This method is in no way diﬀerent from pilot based TAS. A system model
for norm based single transmit antenna selection is shown in Figure 5.1. This
process begins with the estimation of the channel matrix. The channel matrix
is estimated based on pilot signal transmissions. Once the channel matrix is
estimated, the norm or squared norm is evaluated for each column. Note that
the columnwise norm is calculated because each column of the channel matrix
corresponds to a transmitter antenna. All the norms are analyzed and the
column corresponding to maximum norm is identiﬁed. The information about
the antenna corresponding to the column with maximum norm is conveyed
to the transmitter via a low rate feedback link from receiver to transmitter.
Calculation of the norm of a column of the channel matrix indicates that
the diversity combining scheme used at the receiver is MRC. It is because,
in MRC, the optimal weights are such that the received signal is the norm
times the transmitted symbol after combining. TAS systems with MRC at
the receiver are referred to as TAS/MRC systems. In fact, such systems fall
under the category of hybrid diversity systems using selection combining at

118
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
the transmitter and maximal ratio combining at the receiver. If the receiver
is designed to use SC, the antennas corresponding to the channel coeﬃcient
with the highest magnitude are selected instead of the maximum norm. The
column to which the channel coeﬃcient with the highest magnitude belongs
gives the transmitter antenna to be selected and the row to which the channel
coeﬃcient with the highest magnitude belongs gives the receiver antenna to
be selected. TAS systems with SC at the receiver are referred to as TAS/SC
systems or joint transmitter and receiver antenna selection systems. Using
the information received about the antenna that gives maximum power at the
receiver is used at the transmitter and information is transmitted using that
particular antenna. Single antenna is used for data transmission at a time.
So, the eﬀective channel matrix contains single column and Nr rows, i.e., an
Nr × 1 vector.
MRC at the receiver
For the time being, let us assume that MRC is performed at the receiver.
The received signal may be given as
r = hIxq + n
(5.9)
where r is the received signal vector of dimension Nr × 1, hI is the channel
vector corresponding to the antenna selected at the transmitter, xq is the
transmitted symbol which is digitally modulated using suitable M-ary digital
modulation scheme and n is the noise vector of dimension Nr × 1.
The received signal vector is combined using the MRC diversity scheme
to get optimum BER/SER performance. The symbol detection rule for MRC
with maximum likelihood (ML) detection may be obtained by minimum Eu-
clidean distance between the received symbol and an element in the set of all
possible symbols in the M-ary modulation scheme. It can be given by
xˆq = arg min
xˆ
q∈S

∥r −hIxˆq ∥2	
(5.10)
where S is the set of all possible symbols at the transmitter. Note that this
detection process is the same as the detection in the MRC diversity scheme.
Hence, the detection complexity of TAS/MRC MIMO systems is the same
as that of the receiver diversity systems, i.e., single-input multiple-output
(SIMO) systems. So, by using single TAS, apart from the arrangement of
multiple antennas and an RF switch, the hardware complexity at the trans-
mitter is almost equivalent to that of a single antenna system. Moreover, the
other challenges of MIMO systems (inter antenna interference, requirement of
transmit antenna synchronization, etc.) are also avoided.
Selection combining at the receiver
In SC, a single antenna is selected at the receiver. The receiver selects the
antenna that receives the maximum instantaneous power. Again, the selec-
tion is done by connecting an antenna to the receiver using an RF switch.
This has the advantage of hardware compactness at the receiver. Single TAS
and single receiver antenna selection (RAS) convert the MIMO system into a

Transmit Antenna Selection
119
single-input single-output (SISO) system while in operation. In this case, the
link corresponding to the transmitter antenna and receiver antenna with the
highest magnitude of channel coeﬃcient is selected.
Now, in the next sections of this chapter, we will discuss performance
analysis of TAS/MRC systems over various generalized fading channels.
5.4
TAS over Nakagami-m fading channels
The discussion of Nakagami-m distribution and the fading channel models
is already presented in Section 2.4.1 of Chapter 2. We will use those discus-
sions and related expressions to evaluate various performance parameters of
TAS/MRC MIMO systems in this section. We will mainly focus on the out-
age probability and bit/symbol error rate. In this section, the fading envelope
(|hj,i|) of the channel coeﬃcients is assumed to be Nakagami-m distributed
and all the links from transmitter to receiver are assumed to be independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In all the discussions related to performance
analysis of TAS/MRC MIMO systems, we will assume (Nt, 1; Nr) systems, i.e.,
single transmit antenna selection. Since we consider single transmit antenna
selection, the antenna selection criteria are based on maximum instantaneous
SNR which is the same as that for maximum channel capacity as discussed in
Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2. After MRC diversity combining, the resulting instan-
taneous received SNR is given by PNr
n=1 γn = γ PNr
j=1 |hj,i|2, where γn is the
instantaneous SNR of the nth branch. The transmitting antenna that maxi-
mizes SNR at the receiver can be determined by using equation (5.5). This
involves calculation of squared norms for each column of the channel matrix,
i.e., γt,i =
Nr
P
j=1
|hj,i|2 for 1 ≤i ≤Nt, where γt,i is squared norm of ith column
of the channel matrix which is proportional to the instantaneous received SNR
after MRC when the ith antenna is selected at the transmitter.
5.4.1
PDF of received SNR after antenna selection
Probability density function (PDF) of received SNR is required to analyti-
cally evaluate the performance of wireless communication systems. We will
now discuss the steps involved in obtaining the PDF of received SNR after
antenna selection. Each γt,i for i ∈[1, 2, ..., Nt] obtained from equation (5.5) is
arranged in ascending order such that γt,(1) ≤γt,(2), . . . ≤γt,(N), where γt,(l)
is the random variable obtained after the arrangement in ascending order and
N = Nt for TAS/MRC systems. In the TAS/MRC system, we select the trans-
mitting antenna corresponding to the highest received SNR, i.e.,
 γt,(Nt)

. The
PDF of received SNR in such a system, assuming all (|hj,i|)’s to be i.i.d., can

120
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
be given by [31]
pγt(N) (γ) = N{Pγt (γ)}N−1pγt (γ)
(5.11)
where Pγt (·) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of instantaneous
SNR after MRC, γt,i, and pγt (·) is the PDF of instantaneous SNR after MRC,
γt,i.
We have already discussed that the PDF of SNR is the same as the PDF of
the square variate of the envelope. In this case, γt,i =
j=Nr
P
j=1
|hj,i|2 is the sum of
Nr square variates of Nakagami-m distributed random variables. So, referring
to the physical model of Nakagami-m fading channels in Section 2.4.1, it can
be established that the sum of Nr square variates of i.i.d. Nakagami-m random
variables is also Nakagami-m distributed but with parameter m replaced by
mNr. So, the PDF of γt,i can be given by
pγt,i (γ) = mmγm−1e−m γ
γ
γmΓ(m)
(5.12)
where Γ(·) is the Gamma function deﬁned by Γ(n + 1) =

R

xne−xdx and γ
is the average SNR after MRC. Note that γ is the sum of average SNR of
individual links when MRC diversity is used.
The CDF of γt,i can be obtained by integrating the above expression. It
can be given by
Pγt,i (γ) =

Substituting equation (5.12) and equation (5.13) in equation (5.11), the
PDF of received instantaneous SNR, pγt(Nt) (·), for real valued fading param-
eter, m, can be obtained as

The above expression looks more complex than equation (5.14) but it is sim-
pler computationally. Moreover, analytical evaluation of the performance pa-
rameters of communication systems involves averaging with respect to PDF of
instantaneous SNR which encounters integration of complex functions. Using
the later expression for the same makes it diﬃcult to evaluate the integrals
of the functions containing powers of incomplete Gamma functions. Hence,
equation (5.16) can be helpful in some cases. However, it can only be used
for integer values of m. In the next few subsections, we will present analyti-
cal expressions for performance parameters of wireless MIMO communication
systems with TAS over Nakagami-m fading channels.
5.4.2
Outage probability
Wireless mobile communication is highly dependent on the surroundings. Fad-
ing is the most common phenomenon that aﬀects the overall communication
process. Due to fading, the received power momentarily degrades to levels that
the quality of signal is very poor to get detected correctly. Outage probabil-
ity is the probability that the received signal strength falls below a certain
threshold required for reliable communication. It is also deﬁned in terms of
instantaneous channel capacity and the rate of transmission. The probability
that the instantaneous channel capacity is below the rate of transmission is
known as outage probability [14]. For the analysis of outage probability, we
use the deﬁnition that outage probability is the probability that the instan-
taneous SNR at the receiver is less than a certain threshold SNR, γth [118].
Thus, outage probability can be given by
Pout (γ, γth) = P

γ ∥h∥2
F < γth

(5.17)
where h is the column of channel matrix corresponding to the antenna selected
at the transmitter. So, the outage probability is the CDF of instantaneous
received SNR and can be obtained by integrating the PDF represented by
equation (5.14).

The integral in the above expression is of the form I =

as it contains the terms of CDF and PDF of the received SNR before antenna

(5.20)
where Γ(·, ·) is the upper incomplete Gamma function deﬁned by Γ(m, y) =

For integer values of m, the expression for outage probability can be alter-
natively represented in the form of ﬁnite sum series as

(5.21)
In equation (5.20) and equation (5.21), the fading parameter m is to be
interpreted as mNr for TAS/MRC systems as the SNR is the sum of square
variates of Nr Nakagami-m distributed random variables. Using m = 1 in
equation (5.21), it gives the outage probability of TAS/MRC systems over
Rayleigh fading channels which is a special case of Nakagami-m fading model.
It can be given as
Pout (γ, γth) =

The above expression is computationally eﬃcient. It involves Nr addition and
two power operations. It is computationally more eﬃcient than equation (9)
of [15], which involves a number of addition and power operations of the
order NtNr. This diﬀerence will become more signiﬁcant when we consider
large MIMO systems [19] with hundreds of antennas at the transmitter and
receiver.
Alternatively, the integral of equation (5.18) can be evaluated by using
inﬁnite series expansion of incomplete Gamma function as in [14]. But, it
gives an expression in terms of sum of inﬁnite series. However, it becomes

easy to obtain asymptotic outage probability (outage probability for γ →∞)
from the inﬁnite series solution. To obtain asymptotic outage probability, we
rearrange equation (5.20) and represent in terms of lower incomplete Gamma
function as
Pout (γ, γth) =


γinc

m, mγth
γ

Γ (m)


(5.23)
Further, the following set of expressions can be used to bring the lower incom-
plete Gamma function in the form of sum of inﬁnite series.
γinc (s, x) = xs
s Φ (s, s + 1, −x)
(5.24)
Φ (a, b, −x) = e−xΦ (b −a, b, x)
(5.25)
Φ (a, b, x) =

X
k=0
(a)kxk

(5.26)
The above expressions are (9.236.4), (9.212.1) and (9.210.1) of [46]. Now,
lower incomplete Gamma function can be represented in the series form as
γinc (s, x) = e−x

(5.27)
where (a)n is Pochhammer symbol deﬁned as (a)n = Γ(a+n)

For high values of average SNR, it is valid to truncate the series only to
the ﬁrst term. Thus, asymptotic outage probability can be given by

where C is the constant factor containing all the terms independent of the
average SNR. Note that while going from equation (5.28) to equation (5.29),
we used the fact that the resulting SNR before antenna selection is Nakagami-
m distributed with fading parameter mNr. It can be observed that the outage
probability varies as (γ)−mNrNt. This shows that the diversity order of the
system is mNrNt.
In Figure 5.2, the analytical and simulation results of outage probability
are shown for a (3,1;2) TAS/MRC system for a Nakagami-m fading case. The
analytical and simulation results are plotted for m = 0.5, 1 and 1.5 for R = 2
bits/s/Hz. It can be found that the results are the same as shown in [14, Figure
1]. It includes the results of outage probability over Rayleigh fading channels
which is a special case of Nakagami-m fading channels for m = 1.

Error performance analysis
Error performance is the most important parameter for QoS of wireless com-
munication systems. In this section, we will discuss the method to ﬁnd ex-
pressions for exact SER of TAS/MRC systems for binary phase shift keying
(BPSK), binary frequency shift keying (BFSK) and M-ary pulse amplitude
modulation (MPAM) schemes and approximate SER of TAS/MRC systems
for M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM), M-ary phase shift key-
ing (MPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) schemes. BER of a
wireless communication system can be calculated by averaging the conditional
probability of error (CPE) over the PDF of output SNR. CPE is the error
probability in AWGN channels without fading, i.e., when all the channel co-
eﬃcients are unity. But the random nature of fading coeﬃcients makes CPE
too a random variable. So, averaging of CPE is required to get the SER of a
wireless communication system. We are not aiming to discuss the ways to get
the expression for CPE in this book. The curious readers may follow refer-
ences [116], [101] or [45] for the same. The exact CPE for various modulation
schemes and approximate CPE for MPSK modulation scheme can be given
by

The SER can be given by

(5.31)

where P

SNR. When the ﬁrst term of the above expression is evaluated at 0 and ∞,
the result is zero because Pe (γ) = 0 at γ →∞and Pγt(N) (γ) = 0 at γ = 0.
So, eventually, the SER can be obtained as

So, the same result is obtained either by averaging the conditional probabil-
ity of error over the PDF of received SNR or by averaging the derivative of
conditional probability of error over the CDF of received SNR. By now, we
already have the expressions for the PDF of received SNR, equation (5.14)
and the CDF of received SNR, equation (5.20).
5.4.3.1
BPSK and MPSK modulation schemes
From equation (5.30) and Table A.1, the CPE for BPSK, MPSK and MPAM
can be given in the form Pe (γ) = aQ

as c = 0 and the values of other
modulation parameters are a = 1, and b = 2 for BPSK, a = 2, and b =
sin(π/M) for MPSK and appropriate values for MPAM modulation schemes,
respectively. So, using equation (5.30) and equation (5.23) in (5.33), SER can
be evaluated from the following two expressions.

Note that Equation (5.34) is used to evaluate the average probability of error
using derivative (diﬀerentiation) of conditional probability and the CDF of re-
ceived SNR. The integrand is the product of power of lower incomplete Gamma
function and exponential function. Also, equation (5.35) averages CPE with
respect to the PDF of received SNR. The integrand contains product of expo-
nential, power of incomplete Gamma function and algebraic functions. So, the
case of high SNR or asymptotic SER is considered in this case to simplify the
analysis. If one intends to ﬁnd exact SER, numerical methods for integration
or obtaining result in the form of sum of inﬁnite series may be used.
To solve the integrals of equation (5.34) and/or equation (5.35), we need
to represent the incomplete gamma function as a sum of inﬁnite series as in
equation (5.27). So, the PDF and CDF of received SNR can respectively be

we consider only a single signiﬁcant term. The signiﬁcant term for γ →∞

The above asymptotic expression is a lower bound to the exact BER/SER
and it approaches the exact value at high SNR conditions. The expression of
equation (5.42) is valid for any value of fading parameter, number of transmit-
ter antennas and number of receiver antennas. Equation (5.42) gives asymp-
totic BER of TAS/MRC systems over Nakagami-m fading channels for BPSK
and asymptotic SER for MPSK and MPAM modulation schemes applied to
TAS/MRC MIMO systems. One may use the appropriate values of a and b as
listed in Table A.1 for a speciﬁc modulation scheme like BPSK, MPAM and
MPSK.
5.4.3.2
MQAM and QPSK modulation schemes
In this subsection, we derive expressions to analyze approximate error per-
formance of TAS/MRC MIMO systems with MQAM and QPSK modula-
tion schemes. We use an approach similar to the moment generating function
(MGF) based approach to obtain the expressions for SER. Note that in the
case of MQAM and QPSK modulations, the CPE contains two terms as the
modulation parameter c bears non-zero value. The ﬁrst term is in the form of
Gaussian Q function and the second term is in the form of squared Gaussian
Q function. The CPE as given by equation (5.30) can be approximated by rep-
resenting the Gaussian Q function as a sum of two exponential functions [16]
as

From (5.48) and (5.49), the asymptotic error performance can be eval-
uated by truncating the values of all summation variables to be zero, i.e.,
(n1, n2, ..., nNt = 0).
The simulations were performed for (3, 1; Nr) and (2, 1; 1) TAS/MRC sys-
tems over Nakagami-m fading channels with BPSK modulation scheme. The
exact, asymptotic and simulation results of BER for diﬀerent values of SNR
are given in Figure 5.3 for various values of fading parameter, m. It is observed
that with increase in the value of fading parameter (m), BER performance
of TAS/MRC systems shows improvement on account of reduced severity of
fading. Moreover, increasing the value of m also increases the diversity order.
This can be observed from the higher rate of fall in the BER with SNR for
larger value of m, which is directly related to the slope of the BER curve.
Also, each added antenna on either transmitter or receiver improves perfor-
mance and diversity order. It is also important to note that the asymptotic

ﬁnite series expression only to single term, i.e., considering only the term with
the values of all summation variables 0. The MATLAB script ﬁles for simu-
lation of TAS systems over generalized fading channels are available at the
end of this book in Appendix B. A generic script ﬁle is given at the end. Just
by making required changes in the channel coeﬃcient part and modulation
scheme, simulations of TAS systems can be performed over any generalized
fading scenario and various modulation schemes.

TAS over κ −µ fading channels
The discussion of κ −µ distribution and the fading channel models is already
presented in Section 2.4.3 of Chapter 2. We will use those discussions and
related expressions to evaluate various performance parameters of TAS/MRC
MIMO systems over κ−µ fading channels in this section. The fading envelopes
(|hj,i|) of the channel coeﬃcients are assumed to be κ −µ distributed and all
the links from transmitter to receiver are assumed to be i.i.d. In all the dis-
cussions related to performance analysis of TAS/MRC MIMO systems over
κ −µ fading channels, we will assume (Nt, 1; Nr) systems. Since we consider

130
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
single transmit antenna selection, the antenna selection criteria are based on
maximum instantaneous SNR which is the same as that for maximum channel
capacity based TAS as discussed in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2. Further discus-
sions on performance analysis of TAS based MIMO systems over κ −µ fading
channels are followed from [62]. After MRC diversity combining, the resulting
instantaneous received SNR is given by PNr
n=1 γn = γ PNr
j=1 |hj,i|2, where γn
is the instantaneous SNR of the nth branch. The transmitting antenna that
maximizes SNR at the receiver can be determined by using equation (5.5).
This involves calculation of squared norms for each column of the channel
matrix, i.e., γt,i =
Nr
P
j=1
|hj,i|2 for 1 ≤i ≤Nt where γt,i is the squared norm
of ith column of channel matrix which is proportional to the instantaneous
received SNR after MRC when ith antenna is selected at the transmitter.
5.5.1
PDF of received SNR after antenna selection
PDF of received SNR is required to analytically analyze the performance of
wireless communication systems. We will now discuss the steps involved in
obtaining the PDF of received SNR after antenna selection. Each γt,i for i ∈
[1, 2, ..., Nt] obtained from equation (5.5) is arranged in ascending order such
that γt,(1) ≤γt,(2), . . . ≤γt,(N), where γt,(l) is the random variable obtained
after the arrangement in ascending order and N = Nt for TAS/MRC systems.
In a TAS/MRC system, we select the transmitting antenna corresponding to
the highest received SNR, i.e.,
 γt,(Nt)

. The PDF of received SNR in such a
system assuming all (|hj,i|)’s are to be i.i.d. can be given by equation (5.11).
In our case, γt,i =
j=Nr
P
j=1
|hj,i|2 is the sum of Nr square variates of i.i.d.
κ −µ distributed random variables. So, referring to the physical model of
κ −µ fading channels in Section 2.4.3, it can be established that the sum of
Nr square variates of i.i.d. κ −µ random variables is also κ −µ distributed
but with parameters κ and µ replaced by µNr. So, the PDF of γt,(Nt) can be
given by

For TAS/MRC γt is κ −Nrµ distributed as it is the sum of Nr i.i.d. κ −µ

tems over κ −µ fading channels, µ shall be interpreted as Nrµ for TAS/MRC
systems and it remains as it is for joint transmit and receive antenna selection
systems.
5.5.2
Outage probability
In this section, a closed form expression for outage probability of MIMO sys-
tems with antenna selection is derived for κ −µ fading channels. The closed
form expression is evaluated for diﬀerent fading scenarios as special cases of
κ−µ fading. Outage probability is the probability that the instantaneous SNR
at the receiver is less than a certain threshold SNR, γth [118]. Thus, outage
probability can be given by
Pout (γ, γth) = P


The above expression of outage probability is in the form of Marcum Q func-

and MATHEMATICA. Using [116, (4.71)] and κ →0 and the fading pa-
rameter values µ = m, the outage probability of TAS/MRC systems over
Nakagami-m fading channels can be given by

where Γ (a, b) is the upper incomplete Gamma function. The above expression

is exactly the same as equation (5.20) obtained in the previous section for
Nakagami-m fading channels. The above expression for outage probability is
computationally simpler than equation (8) of [14] which is a summation of
inﬁnite series. The expression of equation (5.54) is valid for integer and non-
integer values of Nakagami fading parameter, m. For integer values of m, it
can be alternatively represented in the form of ﬁnite sum series as

In equation (5.54) and equation (5.55), the fading parameter m is to be
interpreted as mNr and m for TAS/MRC systems and joint transmit and
receive antenna selection systems respectively. Using m = 1 in equation (5.55),
the outage probability of TAS/MRC systems over Rayleigh fading channels
can be given as

The above expression is computationally more eﬃcient than equation (9)
of [15] which involves a number of addition and power operations of the order
NtNr. This diﬀerence will become more signiﬁcant when we consider large
MIMO systems [19] with hundreds of antennas at the transmitter and receiver.
To bring completeness to the discussion, the comparison of results for outage
probability of TAS systems with MRC and SC at the receiver is presented. The
simulation results for outage probability of TAS/MRC and joint transmit and
receive antenna selection can be observed in Figure 5.4. For this comparison,
2×2 MIMO systems are under consideration. It is observed from the slopes of
curves that both TAS/MRC and joint transmit and receive antenna systems
give full diversity order but TAS/MRC systems are superior than the joint
transmit and receive antenna selection systems. TAS/MRC systems in the
presented case give 1.5-2 dB SNR gain over joint transmit and receive antenna
selection systems.

In this section, we discuss a method to obtain expressions for exact SER of
TAS/MRC systems for BPSK, BFSK and MPAM schemes and approximate
SER of TAS/MRC systems for MQAM, MPSK and QPSK schemes. BER of a
wireless communication system can be calculated by averaging the CPE over
the PDF of output SNR. The exact CPE for various modulation schemes and

used to obtain exact values of SER. To obtain series solution, Q ¨m (·, ·) can

that the BER values converge very fast and P ≥10 gives suﬃcient accuracy
in the numerical values.
The expression of equation (5.63) can be simpliﬁed by truncating P to

rameters, number of transmitter antennas and number of receiver antennas.

Equation (5.63) gives exact BER for BPSK modulation scheme, exact SER
for MPAM modulation scheme and approximate SER for MPSK modulation
scheme. Equation (5.64) gives asymptotic BER for BPSK and asymptotic SER
for MPSK and MPAM modulation schemes applied to TAS/MRC MIMO sys-
tems. One may use the appropriate values of a and b as listed in Table A.1
for speciﬁc modulation schemes like BPSK and MPSK.

In this subsection, we discuss a method to obtain expressions to analyze ap-
proximate error performance of TAS/MRC MIMO systems with MQAM and
QPSK modulation schemes. We use an approach similar to the MGF based
approach as used in a previous section for Nakagami-m fading channels to
obtain the expressions for SER. The CPE of equation (5.57) can be approxi-
mated as a sum of two exponential functions [16]. The derivative of CPE after
representing Q function as a sum of exponential functions can be given as

where B is the channel bandwidth and γ is the instantaneous SNR at the

and TAS/MRC systems. A (2,1;3) TAS/MRC system was simulated to inves-
tigate the variation in ergodic capacity for diﬀerent values of fading parameter
µ. The results are plotted in Figure 5.7. The results are obtained for the case,
κ = 0 and µ varying from 1 to 10. It is observed that the ergodic capacity

of TAS/MRC systems degrades when the value of µ increases. From these re-
sults, it can be concluded that the capacity degrades when the fading severity
decreases. This can be explained by the fact that when µ →∞, the channel
becomes an AWGN channel and hence the variability of fading coeﬃcients
reduces with increasing values of µ. Thus, TAS is no longer useful in AWGN
channels (this is common to spatial multiplexing and SM MIMO systems). A
similar observation can be made for the capacity with increasing values of the
parameter κ, as a non-fading AWGN channel can be modeled as a special case
of κ−µ fading model for κ →∞. The results for variation in capacity of TAS
systems with κ and µ are given in [62]. Here, we have reproduced them only
for increasing values of µ.
Next, we will discuss performance of TAS systems over η −µ fading chan-
nels.

TAS over η −µ fading channels
The discussions on performance analysis of TAS based MIMO systems over
η −µ fading channels in this section are followed from [61]. In this section,
we assume the fading envelope (|hj,i|) to be η −µ distributed. We already
discussed about the PDFs of η −µ distributed envelope and square variate in

140
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
Section 2.4.2 of Chapter 2. The PDF of η −µ distributed instantaneous SNR
can be obtained by scaling of η −µ distributed random variable as in equation
(2.25) by a factor of average SNR, ¯γ [132]. After suitable scaling, the PDF of
received instantaneous SNR at each antenna can be given as

The integral in the above expression of CDF for η−µ faded SNR is represented
in the form of Yacoub’s integral as deﬁned in Chapter 2 by equation (2.28).
Also, a closed form expression for Yacoub’s integral is reported in [81] but it
is not in easily computable form. So, the integral in the above expression can
be solved by using series expansion of modiﬁed Bessel function and deﬁnition
of incomplete Gamma function [46, 8.445, 3.351.1], i.e.

It should be noted that equation (5.83) applies to TAS/MRC as well as
TAS/SC systems. For TAS/MRC γt is η −Nrµ distributed as it is the sum
of Nr i.i.d. η −µ square variates [136]. So, in equation (5.83), equation (5.84)
and all subsequent expressions for performance analysis of TAS systems over
η −µ fading channels, µ shall be interpreted as Nrµ for TAS/MRC systems
and Nr becomes the number of antennas selected at the receiver, i.e., Nr = 1
for (Nt, 1; Nr, 1) TAS/SC system.
5.6.2
Probability of error
In this section, we derive expression for approximate and exact SER of
TAS/MRC systems over η −µ fading channels for various modulation tech-
niques. SER for a wireless communication system can be calculated by aver-
aging the CPE over the PDF of received SNR. CPE for various modulation
schemes can be given by

the averaging of the derivative of CPE with respect to CDF of the received
SNR was done to obtain expressions for SER for various modulation schemes.
Further, to obtain SER, the MGF based approach would be used. The SER

5.6.2.3
Asymptotic probability of error
The asymptotic probability of error is a measure of performance analysis at
high SNR conditions. In general, it is used to distinguish the system behav-
ior at high SNR regime with a very easy evaluation method. From equation
(5.96) and equation (5.98), it is clear that I2 corresponds to the term con-
taining squared Gaussian Q-function and it can be neglected at high SNR.
The asymptotic error performance can be evaluated by assuming the val-
ues of all summation variables to be zero, i.e., (i1, i2, ..., iN = 0) and
(j1, j2, ..., jN−1 = 0) in equation (5.96). The asymptotic probability of

Note that the above expression of asymptotic probability of error is in the
form of elementary functions and can be easily evaluated using any of the
commonly available computational tools.
In Figure 5.8, the results are shown for a (2,1;1) TAS/MRC system for
Nakagami-m fading case with η = 1 and µ = m/2 (a special case of η −µ
fading). The analytical (exact, approximate and asymptotic) and simulation
results of error performance are plotted for m = 1, 2 and 3 for BPSK modu-
lation scheme. As the value of fading parameter m increases, the severity of
fading decreases and the BER performance of the system improves. It can be
seen from the ﬁgure that the asymptotic BER performance is a lower bound
and approximate BER is an upper bound to the exact BER performance. The
analytical and simulation results can be observed to be in close agreement.
In Figure 5.9, the results are shown for an (Nt,1;1) TAS/MRC system for
Rayleigh fading case with η = 1 and µ = 0.5 (a special case of η −µ fading).
The analytical (exact, approximate and asymptotic) and simulation results of

The variation of ergodic capacity with fading parameters η and µ is also
shown to investigate the eﬀect of fading severity on the ergodic capacity.
Figure 5.10 shows the variation of ergodic capacity for 0 ≤η ≤1 with µ = 0.5
for SNR values of 0 dB, 5 dB and 10 dB with Nt = 2, 3 and 4. It is observed
that the ergodic capacity degrades with increasing value of η for Nt > 2. This
observation is similar to the ﬁndings of [96] for Hoyt fading channels. In fact,
µ = 0.5 and various values of η models Hoyt fading channels as special case
of η −µ fading channel model with the Hoyt fading parameter, q2 = η.

The variation of ergodic capacity for η = 1 with diﬀerent values of µ shows
a degradation in capacity with increasing values of µ. The simulation results
of ergodic capacity are plotted in Figure 5.11 for (Nt,1;2) TAS/MRC system
with a diﬀerent number of transmitting antennas for SNR values of 0 dB and
5 dB. It is observed that the capacity degrades with increasing values of µ
irrespective of the number of transmitting antennas.
The observed degradations in ergodic capacity with fading parameters can
be explained by the fact that with decreasing severity in fading it is highly
likely that the instantaneous SNR will be less varying. In such a case, the
PDF of the received SNR after TAS/MRC shifts toward the left indicating a
decrease in the average SNR at the receiver. However, this will not degrade
the SER performance because this also narrows the PDF of the received SNR
which improves the diversity order. The improved diversity order compensates
the decrease in the average SNR at the receiver. Hence, an improvement in
the SER is observed while the ergodic capacity degrades with decrease in the
fading severity.

TAS over α −µ fading channels
The analysis of TAS systems over α −µ fading channels is very much similar
to that of Nakagami-m fading channels. Despite the fundamental diﬀerence
in both these fading models, expressions of PDF and CDF of Nakagami-m

comparing the following expressions.

considering the similarity of PDF and CDF of α −µ and Nakagami-m fading,
the analysis will not be very diﬀerent. We will use the inﬁnite series expansion
of incomplete Gamma function as in the Nakagami-m fading case.

Outage probability
The analysis of outage probability and SER performance of TAS systems over
α −µ fading channels can be easily evaluated in the same way as discussed in
Section 5.4. As discussed in earlier sections of this chapter, outage probability
is deﬁned as the probability that the received SNR falls below certain threshold
SNR and it is the CDF of received SNR. The outage probability of TAS/MRC
systems over α −µ fading channels can be given as

The incomplete gamma function can be expanded as the sum of inﬁnite
series to obtain the outage probability for high SNR conditions. For this rep-
resentation, we use the following set of expressions.
γinc (s, x) = xs
s Φ (s, s + 1, −x)
(5.112)
Φ (a, b, −x) = e−xΦ (b −a, b, x)

The above expressions are (9.236.4), (9.212.1) and (9.210.1) of [46]. Now,

where (a)n is the Pochhammer symbol deﬁned as (a)n = Γ(a+n)

Thus, an inﬁnite series expression for outage probability can be given as
follows.

The asymptotic outage probability is deﬁned by the high SNR condition,
i.e., γ →∞. In such a case, the summation of the above expression can be
truncated to a single term corresponding to n = 0. So, the asymptotic outage

Error performance
Error performance of any wireless communication systems is important to
know the amount/fraction of the received symbols being detected in error.
For various modulation schemes, probability of error in unfaded channels can
be represented in the form of Gaussian Q function when the noise is AWGN
in nature. It is also called conditional probability of error because its value
is conditioned on the channel coeﬃcients. For various modulation schemes, it
can be given as in equation (5.30). It can be averaged over the PDF of received
SNR after antenna selection to get the SER.
The PDF of received SNR as in equation (5.118) contains incomplete
Gamma function with complicated arguments like µ


2 . A closed form
solution to the integral involving such complex arguments of the power of
incomplete Gamma function does not exist to the best of our knowledge. So,
PDF of received SNR needs to be represented in the form of inﬁnite series
summation as in the case of asymptotic outage probability in the previous
section (refer equation (5.116)).

can be used to evaluate BER/SER of various digital modulation schemes.
Further, simulation of TAS systems over α −µ fading channels can be
performed for probability of error analysis using the MATLAB script ﬁles
provided at the end of this book in Appendix B. The only change the users
may need to do is in the channel coeﬃcients part. The programs are made
generic. Using proper method or function for channel coeﬃcient generation
and suitable values of modulation parameters, TAS systems can be simulated
for various modulation schemes over generalized fading channels.

Introduction
Space time block coded (STBC) systems began with a purpose of providing
transmit diversity for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The
foundations of STBC codes were laid down by Alamouti and hence the scheme
153

154
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
with two transmit antennas is known as Alamouti STBC scheme [2]. We had
brief discussions on basics of transmission and detection of STBC symbols
using multiple antennas in Chapter 1. There we considered only the Alam-
outi transmission scheme which is a special case of STBC codes. Unlike in
spatial modulation (SM) and transmit antenna selection (TAS), symbols are
transmitted simultaneously in STBC from all antennas at the transmitter.
This increases the hardware complexity as simultaneous transmission needs
an radio frequency (RF) chain for each transmitting antenna. However, STBC
schemes are capable of achieving full diversity orders unlike the SM systems.
Though TAS systems can achieve full diversity order, they need feedback from
the receiver to the transmitter in order to make the decision of the antenna to
be selected for transmission. Thus, each STBC, TAS and SM system has its
own merits and may be a good candidate for commercial use. But a system
may be chosen as per the requirements for implementation.
STBC codes have been explored widely because of their capability of
achieving full diversity order and simplicity of the detection process when
they are orthogonal. The Alamouti code for two transmit antennas was gen-
eralized for any number of transmit antennas by Tarokh et al. in their publi-
cations [122, 123]. However, the main drawback of these designs is that they
do not guarantee capacity preservation. In many of the cases, code rate of the
design is less than 1, which means such codes will have less spectral eﬃciency
than that of single-input single-output (SISO) systems (serial transmission
without coding). To overcome this, it was proposed to use error correcting
codes on the incoming bit sequence to combat fading to a certain level and
then use STBC for parallel transmission to achieve full diversity order and
unity coding gain [125]. These codes are known as space time trellis codes. In
addition, SM can be employed for STBC transmission to improve the spec-
tral eﬃciency of STBC schemes [7]. STBC systems, when used with an SM
transmission scheme, is popularly known as space time block coded spatial
modulation (STBC SM) systems. However, STBC SM systems introduce com-
plexity in the detection process to achieve the advantage in spectral eﬃciency.
Performance analysis of STBC codes and their integration with SM and TAS
systems has also been widely studied by the researchers recently. A compara-
tive study of STBC systems with orthogonal code designs with TAS systems
for cognitive radio applications has been reported in [58]. The study has shown
that STBC is a promising technique for cognitive radio applications.
Further, this chapter is organized as follows. In the next section, some
design criteria for STBC codes will be discussed. This deals with the design of
orthogonal STBC for both real and complex constellations. It will be followed
by the STBC system model and introduction to performance parameters.
Further, the performance of STBC systems over various generalized fading
channels will be discussed.

6.2
STBC design criteria
While discussing STBC systems in Chapter 1, it was established that for the
STBC codes to perform well, the fading has to be quasi static in nature, i.e.,
the fading condition of the channel must remain unchanged for the duration
of transmission of a complete STBC symbol which comprises multiple time
slots. This is required because the detection process involves the set of signals
received at diﬀerent times. The design criteria are nothing but the guidelines
to obtain a code that gives optimum diversity gain and coding gain. A good
STBC code should ideally give full diversity order and high coding gain. At
the beginning, STBC codes were designed to give full diversity. Usually they
do not provide any coding gain. In recent years, researchers have come up
with STBC code designs for full rate and full diversity [88] for any number of
antennas [35,36].
6.2.1
Rank determinant criteria
Rank determinant criteria help to design an STBC code that gives optimum
error performance. In Chapter 1, we considered the Alamouti scheme. The
transmission was done using two antennas. The transmission was done in
two time slots. In the ﬁrst time slot, the incoming symbols were transmitted
from the transmitter antennas. In the second time slot, these symbols were
transmitted with some transformations. The STBC codeword for Alamouti
transmission is given by
X =
 x1
x2

=

s1
s2
−s∗
2
s∗
1

(6.1)
The detection process was simpliﬁed by some sort of combining of received
signals in the two time slots. The two symbols were separated by this process
and the detection of both the symbols was made possible separately.
To study the relation of rank determinant criteria with error performance,
consider an STBC codeword designed for Nt × Nr MIMO system. Let the
codeword be transmitted over T time slots. So, the STBC codeword is a
matrix of dimensions Nt × T where number of rows gives number of transmit
antennas and the number of columns gives the number of time slots over which
the STBC codeword is transmitted. An STBC codeword can be given by
X1 =

where each element of the codeword matrix, s1
ij, is a digitally modulated sym-
bol for the incoming bit sequence or a transformed version of it as discussed in

156

Chapter 1. An error is said to have occurred if the codeword X1 is transmitted
and another codeword X2 is detected at the receiver such that
X2 =


(6.3)
Note that there are some diﬀerences in the detection process from what we
are discussed in Chapter 1.
In this case not necessarily each element of X1 and X2 are diﬀerent. Diﬀer-
ence of only some or at least one element is suﬃcient to consider the detection
to be erroneous. And the probability of the event that the transmitted STBC
symbol is X1 and the detected STBC symbol for that transmission is X2 is
called the probability of error for the pair of X1 and X2. In general it is known
as pairwise error probability (PEP). For the case that an STBC code contains
a total of N distinct orthogonal codes, there will be NC2 total possible pairs
of the codewords. But given that the codeword Xi is transmitted, we can have
N −1 set of probable pairs if the detection is erroneous. Again for the case
that X1 is transmitted, detection of any Xj other than X1 results in error.
In total, there are N −1 such cases, X1 →X2, X1 →X3, · · · , X1 →XN.
Using the pairwise error probabilities for each of the pairs, upper bound on
the probability of error can be given by union bound as
Pe(X1) ≤
N
X
i=2
P(X1 →Xi)
(6.4)
Note that the above expression gives probability that codeword X1 is received
in error. To obtain probability of error for any other codeword, the above
expression can be modiﬁed accordingly and the overall probability of error
can be obtained by averaging the probability of error for each codeword. The
maximum likelihood (ML) detection rule used in this case can be given by
ˆX = arg min

(6.5)
where ∥·∥F is the Frobenius norm of a matrix deﬁned as ∥A∥F =

Xall is the set of all possible STBC codewords of the dimension Nt × T , H is
the channel matrix of dimension Nr × Nt and R = HX1 + N is the received
signal matrix of dimension Nr × T for the case that X1 is transmitted.
In this case, pairwise error probability can be given by the following rela-
tion.

Note that the eigenvalues of Z(m,n) =
 D(m,n)  D(m,n)H will all be real and
positive. So, using eigenvalue decomposition (spectral theorem), Z(m,n) can
be given as
Z(m,n) = VΛVH
(6.11)
where V is a unitary matrix and Λ is the eigenvalue matrix of Z(m,n) which
is a diagonal matrix with Z(m,n) = diag(λ1, λ2, · · · ). So,
∥(X2 −X1) H∥2
F = tr
 HVΛVHHH
(6.12)
Note that all the channel coeﬃcients are mutually independent complex Gaus-
sian random variables and hence if we denote the (p, q)th element of HV as
ψp,q, the (q, p)th element of VHHH will be the complex conjugate of ψp,q, i.e.,
ψ∗
p,q. So, jth diagonal element of (X2 −X1) HHH (X2 −X1)H can thus be
given as
rP

given as

non-zero eigenvalues, i.e., there exist only λ1, λ2, · · · , λr non-zero eigenvalues
and λr+1 = λr+2 = · · · = λNt = 0. So, PEP can now be given as

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
Looking at the above expression of PEP, one can comment that the larger
the number of non-zero eigenvalues, the lesser will be the PEP because of the
larger value of the argument of Gaussian Q function. This larger argument of
Q function is on account of the fact that the eigenvalues are non-negative. So,
one statement that can be made about STBC codes is that the codes having
the codeword diﬀerence matrix such that
 D(m,n)  D(m,n)H is a full rank
matrix for all values of m and n will perform better compared to those not
having full rank.
Moreover, in the above expression, we still have random values |ψj,i|2 de-
pendent on the channel. Note that the values are coming from the product
HV. The channel coeﬃcients are assumed to be mutually independent and
Rayleigh distributed. Therefore, the independent Gaussian nature of elements
of H makes each of |ψj,i| to be Rayleigh distributed. So, we take high signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) regime under consideration to approximate Q function
as Q(x) ≤
1
2e−x2

expression, we obtain
P (X1 →X2) ≤

For asymptotic high SNR conditions, one can also be neglected to obtain an

(6.16)
When we consider the overall performance of an STBC system, error probabil-
ity is dominated by the STBC codeword pair for which the matrix Z(m,n) has
the lowest rank. For a while, it can be assumed that Z(1,2) has the lowest rank.
So, the PEP P (X1 →X2) becomes the worst case for error performance of
the STBC MIMO system. The expression of equation (6.16) can be compared
with a standard expression on probability of error, (Gcγ)−Gd, for a system
with Gc as coding gain and Gd as diversity gain. It can be observed that the
diversity gain achieved by STBC systems is Gd = rNr. The full rank of matrix
Z(m,n) can be Nt. So, when an STBC code is designed such that the matrix
Z(m,n) is a full rank matrix for all values of m and n, the system will achieve
full diversity. Again, from equation (6.16), it is observed that the coding gain
is proportional to the product of non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix Z(m,n),
i.e.,
rQ
i=1
λi which can be given as G(m,n)
c

 Z(m,n)
.
From the above discussion, the rank determinant criteria for STBC code
design can be stated that a well-designed STBC code shall have codeword
diﬀerence matrix such that Z(m,n) is a full rank matrix for all values of m
and n. This makes an STBC code achieve full diversity order. In addition, for

Space Time Block Coded MIMO Systems
159
full rank matrices, the code shall have maximum value of det
 Z(m,n)
. The
full rank criteria maximize the diversity order and the determinant criteria
maximize the coding gain of STBC systems.
6.2.2
Trace criteria
It has already been discussed that the calculation of PEP for the case that
an STBC codeword X1 is transmitted and the codeword X2 is received in
equation (6.8) contains the term ∥(X2 −X1) H∥F . This Frobenius norm was
evaluated in the previous section using the relation between trace of a matrix
and its Frobenius norm. Now, we will follow an alternate way to obtain the
required Frobenius norm. It still uses the relation between trace of a matrix
and its Frobenius norm. But, now we use the fact that ∥A∥2
F = tr(AAH) =
tr(AHA). It can be given as
∥(X2 −X1) H∥2
F = tr

D(1,2)H


D(1,2)
(6.17)
Note that the only diﬀerence between equation (6.9) and equation (6.17) is
of the order of hermitian in the trace. For Rayleigh fading coeﬃcients, the
expectation of the matrix HHH in the above expression can be given as
E
 HHH

= NrINt
(6.18)
where INt is the identity matrix of dimensions Nt ×Nt. So, the expected value
of ∥(X2 −X1) H∥2
F can be obtained as

D(1,2)H 
D(1,2)
(6.19)

F
(6.20)
Note that the term ∥D(1,2)∥F can be interpreted as the distance between
the codeword matrices X1 and X2. In general, the distance between STBC
codeword matrices Xm and Xn can be obtained in the form of ∥D(m,n)∥F .
In the case of SISO systems, the distances between codewords or symbols is
deﬁned in terms of Euclidean distance.
Alternatively, for Nr →∞
 HHH

Nr
= INt
(6.21)
So, now let us consider the case that there are a large number of antennas
available at the receiver. For increasing number of antennas at the receiver,
HHH tend to become a diagonal matrix with all the diagonal elements having
the same values. And this is the reason massive MIMO systems are not very
far from reality. Having a large number of receiver antennas is no longer an

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
unrealistic scenario with developments in large MIMO systems and Terahertz
technology [19]. So, for a large number of receiver antennas, the norm relations
can be given as

Thus, PEP can virtually be represented independent of the channel conditions
as

(6.24)
This shows that the pairwise error probability is related to the distances be-
tween STBC codewords and it is dominated by the pair of STBC codewords
having minimum distance between them. The distance metric for STBC code-
words is deﬁned as ∥D(1,2)∥2
F . It can be observed that an STBC code can be
made better in terms of error performance if the minimum distance between
two codewords can be maximized. This criterion related to distance is known
as trace criteria for STBC design because tr (Zm,n) = ∥D(m,n)∥2
F .

Rank determinant criteria veriﬁcation for Alamouti
space time code
We have discussed the Alamouti space time code in Chapter 1. It is mainly
designed for two transmit antennas and an STBC codeword transmission in
two time slots. So, an Alamouti STBC codeword X can be given by
X =

(6.25)
where x1 represents the transmitted symbol vector in ﬁrst time slot, x2 is the
symbol vector transmitted in the second time slot and si is a symbol from a
constellation for M-ary digital modulation scheme being used.
The rank criteria and the determinant criteria for an STBC code is based
on the STBC codeword diﬀerence matrix. So, let us deﬁne another codeword
eX ̸= X as

Rank of all possible codeword diﬀerence matrices is to be evaluated to verify
the rank criteria. But, since the two codeword matrices are diﬀerent, at least
one of the elements in the ﬁrst column of D(X, e
X) is non-zero. Correspondingly,
one element in the second column of D(X, e
X) will also be non-zero and the
non-zero element in the second column will belong to a diﬀerent row. Thus,
in Alamouti STBC transmission scheme, all the codeword diﬀerence matrices
are full rank and the rank is 2 which is equal to number of transmit antennas.
Moreover, the codeword diﬀerence matrix is such that at least diagonal
elements will have non-zero values. This means that determinant of D(X, e
X)
will be zero if and only if the codewords are the same, i.e., X = eX and the
diﬀerence matrix has all zero elements. det

) ̸= 0 also shows that
the diﬀerence matrix D(X, e
X) is a full rank matrix. Also, in Chapter 1, it is
discussed that Alamouti STBC schemes oﬀer unity code rates, i.e., a symbol
is transmitted on every time slot of transmission on average. From the above
discussions, it is clear that the Alamouti STBC code is perfectly designed as
far as the rank determinant criteria are concerned.
The full rank characteristics and the simple detection process can also
be explained by alternate representation of channel matrix. For this purpose,
let us refer to the symbols received in the two time slots of Alamouti STBC
transmission. Repeating the expressions for the signal received in respective
time slots of the transmission as in equation (1.6) and equation (1.7), r1 and
r2 may be represented as
r1 = h11s1 + h12s2 + n1
(6.28)
r2 = −h11s∗
2 + h12s∗
1 + n2
(6.29)
Taking complex conjugate of the signal received in the second time slot,
r1 = h11s1 + h12s2 + n1
(6.30)
r∗
2 = −s2h∗
11 + s1h∗

It leads to an observation that the signals received in both time slots can be
represented in matrix form as

Alamouti STBC codes to hold the property of separation of the transmitted
symbols and the full diversity criterion.

general. Multiplying er with Heq separates the transmitted symbols as follows.

In the above expression, we can observe that the transmitted symbols s1 and
s2 are separated as a part of the ﬁrst row and second row respectively. Also,
the multiplying factor that has come into existence due to fading channel co-
eﬃcients is the same for both symbols and it is |h11|2 + |h12|2. This means
that the signal gets deteriorated due to h11 and h12 while passing through
the channel from transmitter to receiver. But, after doing the operation HH
eqer
for detection, a higher value of magnitude of either h11 or h21 helps in cor-
rect detection. This leads to the system oﬀering full diversity order. Also, the
same operation leads to separation of the transmitted symbols in an Alam-
outi STBC codeword. This makes the detection process simple. Now, the
separated symbols can be detected using the ML technique for SISO systems,
i.e., apart from some initial matrix operations, detection complexity of such
STBC MIMO systems is equivalent to that of SISO systems.
In the case of Alamouti STBC, we have just shown that it achieves full
diversity. According to rank criteria, only the STBC systems with full rank
diﬀerence matrix achieve full diversity. Thus, Alamouti STBC design has a
full rank codeword diﬀerence matrix.
6.3
Generator matrix for STBC design
As in the case of error correcting codes, generator matrix is designed to intro-
duce redundancy such that the resulting codeword system becomes capable of
correcting errors as per the design. In the same way, STBC generator matrix
introduces redundancy to achieve diversity gain in turn that reduces the error
probabilities at greater rates with increasing SNR. Here, let us compare the
matrices obtained for equivalent channel coeﬃcients in equation (6.34) and
the actual Alamouti STBC codeword.

Note that both Heq and X follow the property that MHM would be a diagonal
matrix, i.e., they are orthogonal matrices. This allows the symbols transmitted
in an STBC codeword to be separately decoded making the detection process
computationally eﬃcient. So, any orthogonal matrix of dimension K × K
can be a candidate for STBC design given that it can only have K distinct
elements. However, transformed values of these K elements are allowed to be
valid entries of the matrix. The transformation may be any operation among
negation, complex conjugate or negation of complex conjugate.
6.3.1
Generator matrix for real constellations
The generator matrix of an orthogonal STBC code for real constellation of
size Nt × Nt can have entries only among the elements x1, x2, · · · , xNt and

ing property.

where G4 and G8 are the generator matrices for orthogonal STBC design with
four and eight transmitter antennas respectively. The code rate in the above
STBC designs is 1. In the discussion of generator matrix until this point, we
considered that the number of time slots for an STBC codeword transmission
is the same as the number of transmit antennas. But in general this is not
a required condition. In general, we can have generalized STBC design such
that the generator matrix satisﬁes the following condition.

have a code rate of k

giving information about number of antennas and code rate of the STBC

Note that the generator matrices to achieve unity code rate G3,4,4 and G7,8,8
can be obtained by removing a row respectively from the generator matrices
G4 and G8 discussed earlier for the case that the STBC codeword was trans-
mitted for the number of time slots exactly the same as that of the transmitter
antennas. Similarly, by just keeping on reducing the number of rows for each
reduced number of transmitter antennas, an orthogonal STBC code design
with generator matrix GNt,T,T of dimension Nt × T can be obtained accord-
ingly. Next, we will discuss some of the requirements and some properties of
generator matrix for complex constellations.

Generator matrix for complex constellations
So far, we discussed generator matrix for orthogonal STBC designs with real
constellations. But in practice, complex constellations have been popular for

It has already been shown that full rate orthogonal STBC design with complex
constellations exists only for Nt = 2 [124] and it is Alamouti STBC code. As
already mentioned before, nowadays, full rate and full diversity STBC for
any number of antennas have been reported in [36]. The generator matrix
for Alamouti STBC designs with complex constellations has already been
discussed and used in Chapter 1 and Section 6.2.1. It is repeated below to

Note that the above expression has a close relation between the ﬁrst four
columns and the last four columns. The elements of the ﬁrst four columns
are repeated as the last four columns and the only diﬀerence is of conjugate
operation. In the other half of the columns all the elements are in complex
conjugate form. Also, it can be easily observed that the generator matrix of or-
thogonal STBC design for real constellations can be easily extended to obtain
a generator matrix for orthogonal STBC design with complex constellation.
Comparing the above generator matrix of orthogonal STBC design with com-
plex constellation, equation (6.49), with the generator matrix of orthogonal
STBC design for real constellations, equation (6.42), it can be observed that
the generator matrix for real constellation orthogonal STBC design is the
same as the ﬁrst four columns of the generator matrix for complex constella-
tion orthogonal STBC design.
In the generator matrix given by equation (6.49) and others for real con-
stellation orthogonal STBC designs, all the elements of generator matrix are
non-zero and each element is either a symbol being transmitted or has a close
relation with some of the symbols to be transmitted. However, it is not always
required to have non-zero symbol entry as an element of the generator matrix
for STBC designs. Some examples of such a generator matrix with zeros as

Here, using the element 0 as an entry in the generator matrix indicates that
the corresponding antenna is sitting idle in the corresponding time slot of the
STBC codeword transmission. This actually saves power at the transmitter.
For each non-zero entry in the generator matrix, transmitter has to transmit
some symbol and the transmit power in addition to the power required for
complete processing is needed and for the antennas remaining idle for certain
time slots saves power. Instead of proceeding like equation (6.51) for genera-
tor matrix with zero elements, if the generator matrix for 8 transmit antennas
is designed like in equation (6.49) without any non-zero entries, both would
result in code rate of 1
2. But, in the later case, it would require a block of 16
time slots for transmission of a full STBC codeword while in the case of equa-
tion (6.51), 8 time slots are required for transmission of an STBC codeword.
However, in the ﬁrst case 8 symbols are transmitted in 16 time slots and 4
symbols are transmitted in 8 time slots. Thus, code rate is the same in both
cases. But, processing the received signals in 8 time slots is always easier than
processing the received signals in 16 time slots mainly for the buﬀer memory
and computational demands. So, in the case that 4 symbols are transmitted
over 8 time slots, the delay between ﬁrst symbol arrival at the transmitter and
the fourth symbol received at the receiver is small compared to the case that
8 symbols are transmitted over 16 time slots. So, it is better to choose the
orthogonal STBC designs with complex constellation having generator matrix
with some zero elements than those generator matrices having all the non-zero
elements.
We have discussed about orthogonal STBC designs with real and complex
constellation signal points. Apart from this, there are other designs for STBC
codes which includes quasi orthogonal STBC, diagonally orthogonal STBC,
pseudo orthogonal STBC, etc. But in this book our main focus is on perfor-
mance analysis of orthogonal STBC MIMO systems over generalized fading
channels and hence detailed discussion only on orthogonal STBC designs is

presented. In the next few sections, beginning with STBC detection, we will
discuss performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems over various general-
ized fading channels. The methods to derive expressions for error probability
will be discussed.
6.4
STBC detection
Consider an STBC MIMO system that has Nt antennas at the transmitter and
Nr antennas at the receiver. An orthogonal STBC design is used to transmit
a codeword in T time slots. In this section, we consider complex constella-
tion signal points so that the discussion remains more generalized. The same
detection schemes can be used for STBC systems with real constellation sig-
nal points too. In general the relation between transmitted signals and the
received signals can be given as
R = HX + N
(6.52)
where R is the matrix with dimension Nr × T representing received signals at
Nr receiving antennas in T time slots, H is the channel matrix of dimension
Nr × Nt, X is the STBC codeword matrix of dimension Nt × T and N is the
noise matrix with noise sample elements at each receiver antenna in all the
time slots.
Note that the structure of STBC codewords is such that there are a total
of NtT instances of transmission but there can be maximum T symbols and
others are added for redundancy because code rate is lesser than 1 and the
aim of using STBC is to achieve full diversity order. The transmitted STBC
codeword symbol can be detected at the receiver using the ML detection algo-
rithm. It does extensive search over all possible transmitted STBC codeword
matrices and detects the STBC codeword matrix which is most likely to have
been transmitted using the following minimization criteria.
ˆX =
arg
min
X ∈χ
∥R −HX∥2
(6.53)
where χ is the set of all possible STBC codeword matrix alphabets. These cri-
teria do extensive search over all possible STBC codewords. The complexity
grows exponentially with the number of codewords in this case. Also, by ML
detection this way, the symbols are not detected separately which is a special-
ity of orthogonal STBC MIMO systems. The methods are available for each
design so that the symbols can be separated from the received signals. In the
next subsections, we will discuss these methods for single receiver antennas
and multiple receiver antennas.

STBC designs using G4,8,4 in equation (6.49) for real designs. To explain the
detection process, initially we discuss it for the case that the receiver has a
single antenna. For a while, it is assumed that the system is noiseless. In this
case, the received signal matrix can be given by

In any communication system, estimation of channel coeﬃcients is necessary
for coherent detection. So, without loss of generality, it is assumed that the
channel coeﬃcients are available at the receiver. This makes it easier to obtain
Heq from the coeﬃcients h11, h12, h13 and h14. In noisy environments, the
matrix form representation can be given as
er = Heqx + en
(6.73)
where each element of er represents ri or r∗
i depending on the value of i and
each element of en represents eﬀective additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
in the received signal of the ith time slot.
To detect the symbols, er is pre-multiplied by the Hermitian of eﬀective
channel matrix, HH
eq. This results in the following relation in which the symbols
are separated by virtue of the orthogonal nature of the STBC code design. It

To summarize the detection process for orthogonal STBC designs,
• The signals received in diﬀerent time slots are collected and stored in
the memory.
• The vector is generated by taking complex conjugate of the signals
received in the later half of the time slots.
• The vector obtained is pre-multiplied by the Hermitian of equivalent
channel matrix, Heq.
• The result obtained is used in the ML rule of equation (6.77) to detect
each of the symbols one by one.
Next, we will consider the same case to discuss STBC detection for multiple
receiver antennas.

Detection for multiple receiver antenna
The detection process for orthogonal designs for STBC MIMO systems with
multiple receiver antennas is just a simple extension of the process discussed
for STBC MIMO systems with single receiver antennas. We consider the same
system and the same generator matrix in the discussions of this section. For
an Nt × Nr MIMO system, the channel matrix is of the dimension Nr × Nt.
For such a system, the channel matrix can be given as

where hj represents the jth row of channel matrix, H. Each row corresponds to
a receiver antenna and the elements of a row represent the channel coeﬃcients
between each transmitter antenna to that receiver antenna. We can take a
generalized case of Nr antennas at the receiver, but to make it understood
better we will discuss the detection process for Nr = 2 and an easy extension
of generalizing it for Nr receiver antennas is left as an exercise to the readers.
For the case of orthogonal STBC design given by G4,8,4 as in equation
(6.49), Nt = 4 and we are discussing the case that Nr = 2. Thus, the channel

In general, R is the received signal matrix of dimensions Nr × T . In this case
the received signal matrix, R, will have the dimensions 2 × 8. Let the received
signals at antenna 1 be denoted by r1i in the ith time slot and the received
signals at antenna 2 be denoted by r2i in the ith time slot. Note that the signals
received at antenna 1, r11 to r18 in respective time slots, can be exactly given
by r1 to r8 in the expressions of equation (6.55) to equation (6.62) for the case
of single receiver antennas. Similarly, the signals received at antenna 2, r21 to
r28 in respective time slots, can be easily obtained by the same approach.
Further, the set of signals received at the receiver antenna 1 and the set
of signals received at the receiver antenna 2 are separately processed as in

the case of single receiver STBC MIMO systems. To begin with, the set of

and second row of H corresponding to the receiver antennas.
The next step is pre-multiplication of er1 and er2 respectively with Heq1
and Heq2. This does separation of the transmitted symbols during 8 time slots
of a corresponding STBC codeword. Thus, after this processing, the signals
received at antenna 1 with separated symbols can be given by

cessing for detection of symbols can be done by adding the two expressions,
equation (6.84) and equation (6.86), and then using the ML detection rule.

So far our discussion was about the STBC detection for two receiver an-

of Nr receiver antennas. The only thing one needs to keep in mind for Nr
antennas is that there will be Nr received signals in every time slot. These
signals have to be processed in the same way as that discussed for Nr = 2 in
this section previously. Finally, in a generalized scenario for an Nt ×Nr STBC
MIMO system transmitting k symbols with M-ary digital modulation scheme
in T time slots, the eﬀective received signal can be given as

where Φ is the set of all possible constellation signal points from an M-ary dig-

with multiple antennas at the receiver is summarized below.
• The signals received in diﬀerent time slots at diﬀerent receiver antennas
are collected and stored in the memory.
• The vectors are generated by taking complex conjugate of the signals
received in the later half of the time slots at all the receiver antennas.
• The vector obtained for each receiver antenna is pre-multiplied by the
Hermitian of equivalent channel matrix corresponding with that re-
ceiver antenna, Heqi.
• The result obtained is used in the ML rule of equation (6.91) to detect
each of the symbols one by one.

STBC systems over Nakagami-m fading channels
The discussion of Nakagami-m distribution and the fading channel models is
already presented in Section 2.4.1 of Chapter 2. We will use those discussions
and related expressions to evaluate various performance parameters of STBC
MIMO systems in this section. We will mainly focus on the outage proba-
bility and bit/symbol error rate. In this section, the fading envelope (|hj,i|)
of the channel coeﬃcients is assumed to be Nakagami-m distributed and all
the links from transmitter to receiver are assumed to be independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.). In all the discussions related to performance
analysis of STBC MIMO systems, we will assume Nt × Nr MIMO systems,
i.e., Nt antennas at the transmitter side and Nr antennas at the receiver side.
It is assumed that an STBC codeword is transmitted over T time slots. So,
a codeword for complete STBC transmission can be given by a matrix with
dimensions Nt × T . It is already discussed that the STBC codewords can be
separately processed at diﬀerent antennas and then the processed signals can
be added together to have an expression similar to maximal ratio combining

(MRC). After MRC, various detection techniques may be used to detect the
received symbols in the STBC codeword. In general, ML is the optimum de-
tection technique for receivers in communication systems. The symbols can be
detected based on the minimum Euclidean distance. Also, from discussions in
the previous section and Chapter 1 (Section 1.3.2 and expression of equation
(1.21)), the received signal can be given by
eri = ∥H∥2
Fxi + eni
(6.92)
where eri is the received signal after performing the required steps of STBC
detection processing and performing MRC corresponding to the ith trans-
mitted symbol. Note that the steps discussed in the previous section involve
pre-multiplication of the processed received signals with Heff. This step in-
herently involves the operation that is the same as performing MRC. So, a
separate step of MRC is not required in STBC detection. In fact, this property
of STBC designs makes them able to achieve full diversity orders.
6.5.1
PDF of SNR at receiver
Note that the eﬀective received signal in equation (6.92) is in the same form
of the received signal after MRC in the receiver diversity techniques. In other
words, it has the signal part given by ∥H∥2
Fxi which is the sum of squared
magnitudes of the channel coeﬃcients multiplied by the transmitted sym-
bol. ∥H∥2
Fxi represents sum of NtNr square variants of Nakagami-m dis-
tributed random variables. Referring to the physical model of Nakagami-m
fading channels, the sum of NtNr square variate of Nakagami-m distributed
random variables is also a square variate of Nakagami-m distributed random
variable with the fading parameter value mNtNr. Thus, from equation (2.11),
the probability density function (PDF) of SNR for an STBC MIMO system
over Nakagami-m fading channels can be given by
pγ(γ) = (mNtNr)mNtNr γmNtNr−1
γmNtNrΓ (mNtNr)
e
−mNtNrγ
γ
,
γ ≥0
(6.93)
Note that γ is the average SNR and is used as scaling factor of ∥H∥2
F in many
books to indicate average SNR at the receiver. The PDF of SNR is further
useful in evaluation of various performance parameters of STBC MIMO sys-
tems. Using the fact that received instantaneous SNR follows Nakagami-m
distribution with the m replaced by mNtNr, the further analysis follows from
the analysis of SISO systems or receiver MRC diversity techniques which are
thoroughly investigated by the researchers. In the next part of this section,
we will evaluate outage probability and symbol error rate (SER) (exact and
approximate) of STBC MIMO systems.

6.5.2
Outage probability
Outage probability is already deﬁned in the earlier chapters of this book.
Here, we will use the same deﬁnition to evaluate the outage probability of
STBC MIMO systems. Given the average SNR at the receiver is γ, the outage
probability is deﬁned as the probability that the instantaneous receiver SNR
is below a predeﬁned threshold, γth. Thus, outage probability can be given by
Pout (γ, γth) = P

is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received instantaneous
SNR. Thus, from the relation of CDF of Nakagami-m distributed SNR in
(2.15), the outage probability of STBC MIMO systems over Nakagami-m fad-
ing channels can be given as

Error performance analysis
In this section, we will discuss a method to obtain an expression for error per-
formance analysis of STBC MIMO systems over Nakagami-m fading channels.
Error performance analysis is primarily about the probability of error in the
detected symbols at the receiver. In this book, we consider orthogonal STBC
designs. In this case, the instantaneous SNR at the receiver can be given as
γ = γ∥H∥2
F
(6.97)
It has already been discussed that γ is a Nakagami-m distributed random vari-
able with m replaced by mNtNr and its PDF can be given as in expression of
equation (6.93). In general, to evaluate error performance of any wireless com-
munication system, the channel is assumed to be constant for a while and the
error performance is evaluated for those channel conditions. This probability
of error is known as conditional error probability. Conditional probability of
error depends on the instantaneous received SNR which is a random variable
on account of the randomly varying channel coeﬃcients. Conditional proba-
bility of error for various modulation schemes can be given by

Note that using I1 and I2, the error probability of STBC MIMO systems can
be evaluated analytically via the closed form expressions of equations (6.110)
and (6.117). But these solutions are in the form of Gauss hypergeometric func-
tion and Appell hypergeometric function. These functions need to be evalu-
ated numerically in the software computing tools. Some of the hypergeometric
functions are readily implemented in tools such as MATLAB, Mathematica,
Maple, etc. However, the internal evaluations of these functions involve nu-
merical methods of ﬁnite integrals. Thus, even though these expressions are
closed form expressions, the computation involves evaluation using suitable
numerical methods. Instead, with some approximations, a closed form expres-
sion for approximate evaluation of error probability can be a good option to
use. We look into the approximations that may be considered.

Approximate error performance
In the previous chapter, we introduced the following two approximations for
Gaussian Q function for positive values of argument.

Q(ℏ) ≈1

The bound given by equation (6.118) is known as Chernoﬀbound, named
after the proposer of this bound, and the approximation given by equation
(6.119) is known as Chiani approximation, named after the researcher who
proposed this approximation. Note that these approximations are popularly
used in the analysis of communication systems because of the positive values
of SNR in all cases. Both these approximations give upper bound on the
exact values of Gaussian Q function. The later expression gives an accurate
approximation for Gaussian Q function as discussed in Appendix A.2. Note
that both these approximations represent Gaussian Q function in terms of
exponential functions. This enables the representation of average SER as a
sum of MGF terms of the SNR. In addition to Gaussian Q function, the
expression of conditional error probability involves the squared Gaussian Q
function. Using the above approximations, the squared Gaussian Q functions
may be approximated as
Q2(ℏ) ≤1

Q2(ℏ) ≤

(6.121)
These approximations can be used in ﬁnding the average error probability
of any communication system by averaging the approximated Gaussian Q
function over the PDF of received SNR. Now, using equation (6.118) and
equation (6.120), the approximated Gaussian Q function is in the form of
exponential functions. Hence,

where Mγ(·) is the MGF of received SNR, γ. Note that the MGF of Nakagami-

simple form involving elementary mathematical operations. Thus, looking at
the simplicity of evaluations, one can choose approximate value or exact value
of error probability depending on the required accuracy level.
A 2×2 Alamouti STBC MIMO system was simulated using the MATLAB
script given in Appendix B at the last of this book for SER performance.

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
For this simulation, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation was
considered. In this simulation, we used Es as the average energy of a digitally
modulated symbol per transmitter antenna per time slot. N0 is one sided
noise power spectral density. In this chapter, the ratio Es/N0 is used as a
parameter to indicate signal strength with respect to that of the noise. SER of
STBC MIMO systems over Nakagami-m fading channels with diﬀerent values
of fading parameter is shown in Figure 6.1. An improvement in the diversity
order is observed with the increasing values of m. Note that in this case, the
SNR at the receiver is not the same as the ratio, Es/N0. This is because of
the steps involved in the detection after reception of the signal.
6.6
STBC systems over κ −µ fading channels
The discussion of κ −µ distribution and the fading channel models was pre-
sented in Section 2.4.3 of Chapter 2. There we discussed about the physical
model, PDF and CDF of κ −µ distributed envelope and SNR and the tech-
niques to generate samples that follow κ −µ distribution. We will use those
discussions and related expressions to evaluate various performance parame-
ters of STBC MIMO systems in this section. In this section, the fading en-
velope (|hj,i|) of the channel coeﬃcients is assumed to be κ −µ distributed
and all the links from transmitter to receiver are assumed to be i.i.d. In all
the discussions related to performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems, we
will assume Nt × Nr MIMO systems. It is assumed that an STBC codeword
is transmitted over T time slots. So, a codeword for complete STBC trans-
mission can be given by a matrix with dimensions Nt × T . It was already
discussed that the STBC codewords can be separately processed at diﬀerent
antennas and then the processed signals can be added together to obtain an
eﬀect which is similar to MRC. From discussions in previous sections of this
chapter and Chapter 1 (Section 1.3.2 and expression of equation (1.21)), the
instantaneous SNR of the received signal can be given by
γ = γ∥H∥2
F
(6.126)
where each element of H is κ −µ distributed.
6.6.1
PDF of SNR at receiver
Note that the eﬀective received signal in (6.92) is in the same form of the
received signal after MRC in the receiver diversity techniques. In other words,
it has the signal part given by ∥H∥2
Fxi which is proportional to the sum
of squared magnitudes of the channel coeﬃcients. ∥H∥2
Fxi represents sum
of NtNr square variants of κ −µ distributed random variables. Referring
to the physical model of κ −µ fading channels, the sum of NtNr square

variate of κ −µ distributed random variables is also a square variate of κ −µ
distributed random variable with the fading parameters κ and µNtNr. Thus,
from equation (2.36), the PDF of SNR for an STBC MIMO system over κ−µ
fading channels can be given by
pγ (γ) = µ(1 + κ)

where µ =

(1+κ)2 = µNtNr. Note that in the above expression, we do
not replace µ by µNtNr to keep the representation simpler. Actually, in all
future discussions related to STBC MIMO systems over κ−µ fading channels
µ shall be interpreted as µNtNr.
Note that γ is the average SNR and is used as a scaling factor of ∥H∥2
F
in many books to indicate average SNR at the receiver. The PDF of SNR is
further used in evaluation of various performance parameters of any wireless
communication system, STBC MIMO systems in this chapter. Using the fact
that received instantaneous SNR follows κ −µ distribution, further analysis
follows from the analysis of SISO systems or receiver MRC diversity techniques
which are thoroughly investigated by the researchers over various fading chan-
nels including κ −µ fading channels. In the next part of this section, we will
evaluate outage probability and SER of STBC MIMO systems over κ −µ
fading channels.
6.6.2
Outage probability
Outage probability is already deﬁned in the earlier chapters of this book. Here,
we will use the same deﬁnition to evaluate the outage probability of STBC
MIMO systems. Outage probability gives the proportion of time for which a
communication link is out of order. Given the average SNR at the receiver is
γ, the outage probability is deﬁned as the probability that the instantaneous
receiver SNR is below a predeﬁned threshold, γth. Thus, outage probability
can be given by
Pout (γ, γth) = P

γ ∥H∥2

is the CDF of the received instantaneous SNR. Thus, from the relation of CDF

Error performance analysis
In this section, we will discuss a method to obtain an expression for error
performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems over κ −µ fading channels.
Error performance analysis is primarily about the probability of error in the
detected symbols at the receiver. Outage probability is directly related to
error performance of the system but there is no exact relation between these
two performance parameters. For orthogonal STBC designs the instantaneous
SNR at the receiver can be given as Frobenius norm of the channel times
average SNR as in equation (6.126).
It was already discussed that γ is a κ −µ distributed random variable
with fading parameters κ and µ replaced by µNtNr and its PDF can be
given as in the expression of equation (6.127). In general, to evaluate error
performance of any wireless communication system, the channel is assumed
to be constant for a while and the error performance is evaluated for those
channel conditions. This probability of error is known as conditional error
probability. Conditional probability of error depends on the instantaneous
received SNR which is a random variable on account of the randomly varying
channel coeﬃcients. Conditional probability of error for various modulation
schemes can be given by

du, γ is the instanta-

For averaging the conditional error probability, we will use the MGF-based

For the case of Nt×Nr STBC MIMO systems, the fading parameter values are
κ and µNtNr. However, as discussed earlier, to keep the expressions simpler,
the parameters are κ and µ and interpreted as µNtNr in the above expression
and all expressions henceforth.
The probability of error can be obtained by evaluating I1 and I2. First,
we evaluate I1 which may be obtained by substituting equation (6.135) in

Integrals I1 and I2 are deﬁnite integrals with ﬁnite limits. It is possible to
obtain a numerical solution for them. Alternatively, closed form solutions in
terms of hypergeometric functions can be obtained by various substitutions
as we did in the case of analysis of STBC MIMO systems over Nakagami-m
fading channels.
Solution for I1
To solve I1, let us change the variable of integration by taking substitution
as
t =
µ (1 + κ)
µ (1 + κ) +
b¯γ
2sin2θ
(6.138)
The aim of this substitution is to make the exponent term simple and in the

form of ept. Thus, after mathematical simpliﬁcations, various terms required
in the integral can be represented as
sin2θ =

cos θ =

(6.142)
Further, the substitution converts the lower and upper limits of the integral
from 0 to 0 and from π

respectively. Now, using all the above
terms for the substitution, the integral can be given as

conﬂuent hypergeometric function with the substitution
y = 2µ (1 + κ) + b¯γ
2µ (1 + κ)
t
(6.144)
The above substitution converts the upper limit of the integral to unity
without changing the lower limit of the integration. This makes it easy to
represent this integral into standard form of conﬂuent hypergeometric function
of two variables. Conﬂuent hypergeometric function is deﬁned as

Next, we will discuss the solution of I2.
Solution for I2
One can proceed for solution of I2 following the steps used for solution of I1
earlier. We take the same substitution as that for I1 in equation (6.138). Thus,
the same expressions will be used in the integral as discussed in equations
(6.139)-(6.142). However, the upper limit of the integral will now be

Note that I1 and I2 are respectively in the form of conﬂuent hypergeo-

Instead, with some approximations, a closed form expression for approximate
evaluation of error probability can be a good option to use. We look into the
approximations that may be considered.
The approximations of Gaussian Q functions have been discussed in the
previous section for the case of error performance of STBC MIMO systems
over Nakagami-m fading channels. The analysis can be simpliﬁed by repre-
senting the Gaussian Q functions as a sum of exponential functions. Thus,
the expression of average error probability can be obtained in the form of sum
of MGF.
Using the similar simulation set-up discussed for SER performance over
Nakagami-m fading channels in the previous section, we simulated 2×2 Alam-
outi STBC MIMO system over κ −µ fading channels. Note that the eﬀect of
number of clusters in the received signal has already been discussed by vary-
ing the value of m in the case of Nakagami-m fading channels. Now, in this
section, we have shown SER results for various strengths of the line of sight
(LOS) component in the received signal by simulating the system with dif-
ferent values of κ. The results are shown in Figure 6.2. As it is clear from
the earlier discussions, the improvement in SER with a stronger LOS com-
ponent is observed as expected. This is not the case for SM MIMO systems
and spatially multiplexed MIMO systems. This shows that STBC systems can
perform well even in the non-fading or LOS conditions.

STBC systems over η −µ fading channels
The discussion of η −µ distribution and the fading channel models is already
presented in Section 2.4.2 of Chapter 2. There we discussed about the phys-
ical model, PDF and CDF of η −µ distributed envelope and SNR and the
techniques to generate samples that follow η −µ distribution. We will use
those discussions and related expressions to evaluate various performance pa-
rameters of STBC MIMO systems in this section. In this section, the fading
envelope (|hj,i|) of the channel coeﬃcients is assumed to be η −µ distributed
and all the links from transmitter to receiver are assumed to be i.i.d. In all
the discussions related to performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems, we
will assume Nt ×Nr MIMO systems. It is assumed that an STBC codeword is
transmitted over T time slots. So, a codeword for complete STBC transmis-
sion can be given by a matrix with dimensions Nt × T . It is already discussed
that the STBC codewords can be separately processed at diﬀerent antennas
and then the processed signals can be added together to achieve a similar ef-
fect as that of MRC. From discussions in previous sections of this chapter and
Chapter 1 (Section 1.3.2 and expression of equation (1.21)), the instantaneous

SNR of the received signal can be given by

(6.168)
where each element of H is η −µ distributed.
6.7.1
PDF of SNR at receiver
Note that the eﬀective received signal in equation (6.92) is in the same form
of the received signal after MRC in the receiver diversity techniques. In other
words, it has the signal part given by ∥H∥2
Fxi which is proportional to the
sum of squared magnitudes of the channel coeﬃcients. ∥H∥2
Fxi represents
sum of NtNr square variants of η −µ distributed random variables. Referring
to the physical model of η −µ fading channels, the sum of NtNr square
variate of η −µ distributed random variables is also a square variate of η −µ
distributed random variable with the fading parameters η and µNtNr. Thus,
from equation (2.25), the PDF of SNR for an STBC MIMO system over η −µ
fading channels can be given by

µNtNr. Note that in the above expression, we do not substitute µNtNr in
place of µ to keep the representation simpler. Actually, in all future discus-
sions related to STBC MIMO systems over η −µ fading channels µ shall be
interpreted as µNtNr.
Note that γ is the average SNR and is used as a scaling factor of ∥H∥2
F
in many books to indicate average SNR at the receiver. The PDF of SNR is
further used in evaluation of various performance parameters of STBC MIMO
systems. Using the fact that received instantaneous SNR follows η −µ dis-
tribution, the further analysis follows from the analysis of SISO systems or
receiver MRC diversity techniques which are thoroughly investigated by the
researchers over various fading channels including η −µ fading channels. In
the next part of this section, we will evaluate outage probability and SER of
STBC MIMO systems over η −µ fading channels.
6.7.2
Outage probability
Outage probability is already deﬁned in the earlier chapters of this book. Here,
we will use the same deﬁnition to evaluate the outage probability of STBC
MIMO systems. Outage probability gives the proportion of time for which a
communication link is out of order. Given the average SNR at the receiver is
γ, the outage probability is deﬁned as the probability that the instantaneous

can be given by

is the CDF of the received instantaneous SNR. Thus, from the relation of CDF

the outage probability of STBC MIMO systems over η −µ fading channels

Error performance analysis
In this section, we will discuss a method to obtain an expression for error
performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems over η −µ fading channels.
Error performance analysis is primarily about the probability of error in the
detected symbols at the receiver. Outage probability is directly related to
error performance of the system but there is no exact relation between these
two performance parameters. For orthogonal STBC designs, the instantaneous
SNR at the receiver can be given as Frobenius norm of the channel times
average SNR as in equation (6.168).

It has already been discussed that γ is an η−µ distributed random variable
with fading parameters η and µNtNr and its PDF can be given as in the ex-
pression of equation (6.169). In general, to evaluate error performance of any
wireless communication system, the channel is assumed to be constant for a
while and the error performance is evaluated for those channel conditions. This
probability of error is known as conditional error probability for given chan-
nel conditions. Conditional probability of error depends on the instantaneous
received SNR which is a random variable on account of the randomly varying
channel coeﬃcients. Conditional probability of error for various modulation
schemes can be given by

For the case of Nt × Nr MIMO STBC systems, the fading parameters are η
and µNtNr. However, as discussed earlier, to keep the expressions simpler, the
parameter µ needs to be interpreted as µNtNr in the above expression and
all expressions henceforth.
The probability of error can be obtained by evaluating I1 and I2. First,
we evaluate I1 which may be obtained by substituting equation (6.178) in

Integrals I1 and I2 are deﬁnite integrals with ﬁnite limits. It is possible to
obtain a numerical solution for them. Alternatively, closed form solutions in
terms of hypergeometric functions can be obtained by various substitutions
as we did in the case of analysis of STBC MIMO systems over Nakagami-m
and κ −µ fading channels.
Next, we will obtain solutions for I1 and I2.
Solution for I1
To solve I1, let us change the variable by substituting cos2 θ = t. This
leads to
sin2 θ = 1 −cos2 θ = 1 −t
−2 cosθ sin θdθ = dt
(6.181)
Thus, the limits of integral would change from 0 to 1 and the integrating
variable dθ changes to

Solution for I2
One can proceed for solution of I2 following the steps used for solution of
I1 earlier. But in this case while making the substitution care is taken that the
upper and lower limits of integration be converted to 1 and 0 because most
special functions such as hypergeometric functions are deﬁned for this limit
of ﬁnite integrals. So, in this case, let us change the variable by substituting
2 sin2 θ = t. This leads to
sin2 θ = t

cos2 θ = 1 −sin2 θ = 1 −t

As in the case of error performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems over
Nakagami-m and κ −µ fading channels discussed earlier in this chapter, the
integrals I1 and I2 are in closed form involving hypergeometric functions, Ap-
pell hypergeometric function and Lauricella hypergeometric function in this
case. Again, the evaluation is to be carried out either by solving the deﬁnite
integral with ﬁnite limits numerically or using the inﬁnite series representa-
tion of these functions. Moreover, not all kinds of hypergeometric functions
have been implemented in commonly used computational tools and softwares.
Thus, in this case too, the computation of error probability can be simpliﬁed
using Chiani’s approximation [16] or Chernoﬀbound on the Gaussian Q func-
tion. This helps because the MGF of η −µ distributed SNR is in elementary
functions. It is very easy to evaluate the MGF for any value of SNR rather than
computing the complex functions such as hypergeometric functions obtained
as a solution of I1 and I2.
Bit error rate (BER) results for a 2 × 1 Alamouti STBC MIMO system

198
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
are shown in Figure 6.3. The BER is shown for various values of η in the range
from 0.01 to 1 and µ = 1. BER performance of the STBC system is observed
to degrade with the decreasing values of η when η < 1. Note that η is deﬁned
as the ratio of total power of in-phase components to that of quadrature
phase components in the multipath clusters. Thus, η = 1 represents a point
of symmetry. The channel model for given value of η will be the same as that
with 1/η and the same value of µ.
In the next section, we will discuss STBC MIMO systems over α−µ fading
channels.
6.8
STBC systems over α −µ fading channels
The discussion of α −µ distribution and the fading channel models was al-
ready presented in Section 2.4.4 of Chapter 2. There we discussed about the
physical model, PDF and CDF of α −µ distributed envelope and SNR and
the techniques to generate samples that follow α −µ distribution. We will
use those discussions and related expressions to evaluate various performance
parameters of STBC MIMO systems in this section. In this section, the fading
envelope (|hj,i|) of the channel coeﬃcients is assumed to be α −µ distributed
and all the links from transmitter to receiver are assumed to be i.i.d. In all
the discussions related to performance analysis of STBC MIMO systems over
α −µ fading channels, we will assume Nt × Nr MIMO systems. It is assumed
that an STBC codeword is transmitted over T time slots. So, a codeword
for complete STBC transmission can be given by a matrix with dimensions
Nt × T . It was already discussed that the STBC codewords can be separately
processed at diﬀerent antennas and then the processed signals can be added
together to get the signals equivalent to those received in MRC. From discus-
sions in previous sections of this chapter and Chapter 1 (Section 1.3.2 and
expression of equation (1.21)), the instantaneous SNR of the received signal
can be given by
γ = γ∥H∥2
F
(6.208)
where each element of H is α −µ distributed.
Note that the eﬀective received signal in equation (6.92) is in the same
form of the received signal after MRC in the receiver diversity techniques. In
other words, it has the signal part given by ∥H∥2
Fxi which is proportional to
the sum of squared magnitudes of the channel coeﬃcients. ∥H∥2
Fxi represents
sum of NtNr square variants of α −µ distributed random variables. Note
here that the exact distribution of this sum cannot be directly obtained as
in the earlier cases of Nakagami-m, κ −µ and η −µ distributed SNR. In
the case of α −µ distributed SNR, one needs to approximate the sum of
α −µ distributed square variates by using various moments as is done in [27].
However, instead of going into those complexities, we can obtain the PDF

Space Time Block Coded MIMO Systems
199
of received instantaneous SNR as a convolution of PDF of individual link
SNRs given that they are mutually independent. This makes the analysis
very diﬃcult. So, we represent the MGF of instantaneous SNR of L link MRC
system as a function of MGF of instantaneous SNR of single link. The relation
can be given as
MGFL = MGFL
1
(6.209)
where MGFL is the MGF of instantaneous SNR for a receiver with L branch
MRC diversity scheme and MGF1 is the MGF of instantaneous SNR for a
single link system.
To proceed for the analysis of single antenna systems, we refer to the MGF
of α−µ distributed SNR given by the expression of equation (2.52) of Chapter
2.

The average probability of error can be obtained by averaging the con-
ditional error probability over the PDF of received instantaneous SNR. It is
observed in all the previous cases that the exact error probability is in the
form of complex functions even if the MGF is in the form of simple expres-
sions consisting of elementary mathematical operations. While in this case,
the MGF itself is in the form of Meijer’s G function. So, in this case, we
evaluate approximate error probability.
In Section 6.5, we introduced the following two approximations for Gaus-
sian Q function for positive values of argument.

(6.215)
These approximations can be used in ﬁnding the average error probability
of any communication system by averaging the approximated Gaussian Q
function over the PDF of received SNR. Now, using equation (6.118) and
equation (6.120), the approximated Gaussian Q function is in the form of

will proceed further with averaging of equation (6.216) even though equation

Note that the above expression is an upper bound on the error probability for
a communication system without any diversity technique. With the help of
equation (6.209), an upper bound on the probability of error can be evaluated
for STBC MIMO systems over α −µ fading channels.
Among the generalized fading channels discussed in this book, α−µ chan-
nel model is the only model that takes care of the nonlinearities in the fading
environment. The parameter, α, shows the non-linearity of the fading environ-
ment. The eﬀect of non-linearity on the error performance of STBC MIMO
systems is shown in Figure 6.4. It is observed that the BER performance
improves with the increasing values of α. This is because a larger value of α
models the channels that are more like AWGN or non-fading scenarios (α →∞
models non-fading environments).

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications we have dis-
cussed until now are also known as point-to-point MIMO. There are many dis-
advantages associated such kinds of MIMO systems. Some of them are listed
below.
• Multiplexing gain is not possible for a rank deﬁcit channel matrix like line-
of-sight propagation or key hole channel.
• Multiple radio frequency (RF) chains are employed for multiple antennas.
Transmit antenna selection (TAS) has simpliﬁed such requirements. But
TAS needs a feedback path from the receiver to the transmitter.
• Due to size constraints, multiple antennas at the base station are possible
but not possible at the mobile station with the present scenario.
• Channel estimation overhead using pilot signals is not manageable for large

scale MIMO systems where the receiver and transmitter supposedly employ
hundreds to thousands of antennas.
7.1
Multiuser MIMO
Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) has overcome these shortfalls. Unlike point-
to-point MIMO, in MU-MIMO, a base station will serve several users [48,69].
A simpliﬁed model for MU-MIMO is shown in Figure 7.1. In this, a trans-
mitter employing four antennas is communicating with four users with a single
antenna. It is a highly simpliﬁed model. Assume a base station employing M
antennas and communicating with K users using a single antenna in a single
cell of a cellular network. There are two types of communication here [18,67].
1.
Base station (BS) sending data to the mobile users which is popu-
larly known as downlink.
2.
Mobile users or Mobile station (MS) sending data to the base station
which is also known as uplink.
Let us analyze communication in both cases mentioned above.

Uplink
The channel for uplink transmission is also known as multiple-access channel
in the literature. Assume that K users are sending signals to the base station.
The signal each user is sending to the base station is denoted by xUL
i
, i =
1, 2, 3..., K. Note that for a single antenna user, the signal vector will be a
complex scalar quantity. In order to preserve our analysis for any number
of antennas at the mobile user, we will continue using the signal from each
user at the uplink as a vector quantity. The channel for each user to the base
station is expressed as HUL
i
, i = 1, 2, 3..., K. The whole process is depicted in
Figure 7.2. Then the received signal at the base station can be represented as
yUL = HULxUL + nUL

The channel for downlink transmission is also known as broadcast channel in
the literature. Assume that each user as depicted in Figure 7.3 receives inde-
pendent signal vector xDL during the broadcast phase. Assume the downlink
and uplink signals are transmitted at separate time slots with suﬃcient guard

time intervals between them. For such time division duplex (TDD) mode of
operation [11], assuming the reciprocity of the channel, we may write down
the received signal at the user terminals as follows.

Note that for a single antenna user, the received signal vector and noise vector
for each user will be a complex scalar quantity. In order to preserve our analysis
for any number of antennas at the mobile user, we will continue using the
signal received as well as noise vector for each user at the downlink as a
vector quantity.
7.2
Massive MIMO
Massive MIMO in which base station employs several hundreds to thousands
of antennas and mobile users employing fewer antennas like one or two an-
tennas is scalable and has many advantages as mentioned below [70]. We will
assume each mobile station (user) employs single antenna for our analysis.
Massive MIMO is a special case of MU-MIMO. For massive MIMO as the
name suggests, we will assume the number of base station antennas (M) tends
to inﬁnity.
• Since mobile user has one or two antennas, much of the signal processing
is done at the base station. Mobile station is generally small and receive
diversity is not cost-impressive.
• In downlink, using beamforming at the base station, it can direct its beams
toward the desired user as depicted in Figure 7.4, thereby minimizing the
interference and energy usage. In uplink, base station will separate out the
signals received from diﬀerent users.
• In TDD massive MIMO, for an ideal case, the time required to estimate the
channel is not dependent on the number of antennas at the base station and
hence it is scalable.

FIGURE 7.4

K=3 users with single antenna (downlink transmission)
Energy and spectral eﬃciency of moderately large antenna arrays for MU-
MIMO has been compared to the single-input single-output (SISO) system.
It has been reported that there are signiﬁcant improvements in both [86]. For
an ideal channel state information (CSI) scenario, a mobile user communicat-
ing with a massive MIMO base station with much reduced uplink transmit
power of just
1
M would be to attain the same throughput as that of a single
antenna base station. A detailed discussion on the massive MIMO designs has
been presented in [85]. A thorough discussion on the massive MIMO has been
presented in [9,17,71].
7.2.1
Uplink capacity analysis
Let us consider a base station employing M antennas serving K users with
a single antenna. Assume the channel coeﬃcient from the ith user to the jth
antenna of the base station [63] as
hji = gji
p
di
(7.3)
where gji and di are the small scale channel gain coeﬃcients and large scale
fading coeﬃcients. The uplink channel for this case may be expressed as
Huplink = GD1/2
(7.4)
where

If we assume that channels are orthogonal, then
(Huplink)HHuplink = D1/2GHGD1/2 = MD
(7.5)
The above equation is also known as favorable channel condition. It may be
dependent on the type of antenna array and channel environments [87]. But it
has been reported in the literature that as the number of antennas at the base
station grows large (M →∞>> K), such favorable conditions are satisﬁed
for diﬀerent antenna array conﬁgurations and channel environments. It may
be, due to the vast spatial diversity, the small scale randomness dies out. This
needs a further investigation. We assume the favorable channel condition for
our analysis. Note that this favorable condition is assumed irrespective of
the small scale fading distributions, whether they are classical or generalized
fading distributions. Assume equal power is given to each user as P
K during
uplink. We may evaluate the capacity for such massive MIMO system of base
station with M antennas and single antenna K users for equal power allocation
as follows.
Cuplink
M>>K ≈log2 det(IK + PMD
Kσ2n
)
(7.6)
The above equation may also be expressed as
Cuplink
M>>K =
K
X
i=1
log2(1 + PMdi
Kσ2n
)
(7.7)
The above capacity may be achieved by a simple linear processing (matched
ﬁlter) at the base station as follows.
(Huplink)Hyuplink = (Huplink)H(Huplinkxuplink + nuplink)
(7.8)
If we substitute (Huplink)Hyuplink = ˜yuplink and (Huplink)Hnuplink = ˜nuplink,
we have
˜yuplink = MDxuplink + ˜nuplink
(7.9)
Note that matched Filter (MF) processing at the base station has decou-
pled all the users’ signals since D is a diagonal matrix. It means we have K
parallel independent Gaussian channels. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
each user’s link to the base station can be calculated as MP di
Kσ2
n . Hence MF
processing at the base station gives the capacity of equation (7.7).

210

7.2.2
Downlink capacity analysis
The capacity for the downlink massive MIMO can be calculated similarly.
The only diﬀerence would be that the base station has the CSI and hence can
allocate power adaptively to each user. Assume the power allocation matrix
Dp is as follows.

(7.10)
This capacity for the downlink can be easily achieved for the case when the
base station does the simple MF precoding as follows.

(7.11)
We can write down the expression for the downlink received signal vector as
below.
ydownlink = (Huplink)T xdownlink

(7.12)
Using the expression of (7.11) and channel favorable condition, the above
equation may be simpliﬁed as follows.
ydownlink = MD
1
2 D
1
2p xdownlink + ndownlink
(7.13)
Note that D and Dp are diagonal matrices. Hence the signals for the downlink
have been decoupled completely. Also it can be observed that this simple linear
precoding at the base station has achieved the capacity of equation (7.10).
There have been many assumptions in the above analysis, such as
• The channel is satisfying favorable conditions of orthogonality for a massive
MIMO case.
• CSI can be estimated at the base station properly.
• The channel is reciprocal.
But these assumptions may not be true in real life or practical situations.
Many researchers are looking into the possible problems in a practical sce-
nario and trying to solve such problems. Note that we have done our analysis
for a single cell. But in real life cellular communication is always multicell
communication (refer to Figure 7.5). The pilot symbols are transmitted from
the users to the base station which will be used for estimating the channels.

MIMO for 5G Mobile Communications
211
FIGURE 7.5
MU-MIMO-based cellular network (BS equipped with M=14 antennas and
single antenna MS or user, each cell has K=2 users for illustration purposes)
This estimated CSI is used by base station in the downlink transmission.
But the number of orthogonal pilot symbols is limited for a given period and
bandwidth. Hence the pilot symbols are reused in a multicell communication.
Hence the signals received by the base station are a linear combination of
pilot symbols from the home cell and neighboring cells. There is a high level
of interference especially at the cell edge. This is also known as pilot con-
tamination. The MF precoding we have discussed above doesn’t work well in
multicell MU-MIMO. It has been reported in the literature that zero forc-
ing (ZF), regularized zero forcing (RZF) and minimum mean square error
(MMSE) precoder work better in such cases [55]. In RZF, one premultiplys
the transmit signal in the downlink by a weight vector deﬁned as [111]

• δ = ∞(ZF precoding).
• δ =

2SNRdownlinklog2M (MMSE precoding [54]).
There are ways of overcoming such things by cooperation among the base
stations, which is referred to as coordinated multipoint transmission. There
are two types of cooperation (full and partial cooperation). Full cooperation
is called network MIMO and partial cooperation is referred to as coordinated
beamforming/scheduling [114]. There are twofold advantages of coordinated
multipoint transmission (mitigation of intercell interference and augmenting
data rate at the edge of cell) [42]. Some of the challenges with massive MIMO
are as follows [64].
• It has been assumed that channel for the uplink and downlink are reciprocal.
But the hardware at the mobile user and base station may be quite diﬀerent;
in that case, the reciprocal channel assumption may be lost.
• Orthogonal pilots are limited and hence they are reused. But for user at the
cell edge, there may be high interference from the adjacent or neighboring
cell’s user using the same set of pilots. This is called pilot contamination.
• Base station has no knowledge of the channel state information prior to link
establishment with a mobile user. Hence downlink beamforming could not
be performed. Hence transmit diversity employing space time codes may be
used.
• Massive MIMO has highly simpliﬁed operation with linear precoding and
detection for favorable channel condition. But this favorable channel con-
dition may not always be satisﬁed depending on the channel propagation
conditions, types of antenna arrays employed at the base station, etc. This
requires a thorough analysis.
7.2.3
Outage probabilty
It would be good to ﬁnd an approximate expression for outage probability
for each user in the downlink. Such analysis would be of help if we want to
design massive MIMO. For instance, we would like to ﬁnd the number of users

213
a massive base station could serve at a time for a given outage probability.
We will use single cell massive MIMO for the analysis. Suppose that the base
station is employing MF precoder for the downlink. Assume each user is using
a single antenna. For this case, one may express the signal transmitted from
the base station as follows [39].

Requirements for 5G mobile
Every generation cellular communication comes in a decade or so [108]: 1G
(1981), 2G(1992), 3G (2001) and 4G (2011). Requirements for the next gener-
ation 5G mobile communications in comparison with 4G mobile is tabulated
in Table 7.1. Even though 5G has not been standardized (it is expected some-
where in 2020), however, International Telecommunication Unit (ITU) has
come up with certain requirements for 5G mobile communications [82]. Peak
data rate is the best possible data rate a user can get in a network and area
traﬃc capacity is the cumulative data amount the network can serve. Peak
data rate is expected to be 20 Gbps and area traﬃc capacity, 10 Mbps/m2.
Latency of 1 ms is required for future 5G applications like two-way games,
tactile internet [40], and virtual and augmented reality (for instance, google
glass). 5G is yet to be standardized. It is expected that it will have super high
capacity and ultra high speed data rate. Besides 5G devices will consume less
power and be relatively cheaper.

Ten pillars for 5G mobile wireless communications [110] are listed below.
• Small cells
• mmWave
• Massive MIMO
• Multi-radio access technology (RAT)
• Self-organizing networks (SON)
• Device-to-device (D2D) communications
• Backhaul
• Energy eﬃciency (EE)
• New spectrum and sharing
• Radio access network (RAN) virtualization
7.3.2
Three big pillars for 5G mobile
In order to fulﬁll the requirements of 5G wireless communications, some sug-
gestions are listed below.
• Small cell networks like pico- and femtocells, which enhance the spatial and
frequency reuse, will be able to enhance the capacity of the system [137].
Small cells will reduce propagation losses, and increase data rate and energy
eﬃciency. Qualcomm demonstrated that the capacity of the network almost
doubles whenever the number of small cells double.
• Spectrum is crowded at microwave frequencies. But mmWave frequencies
are relatively free and the available bandwidth is huge and correspondingly
at a higher capacity of the system.

216
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
• Large antenna arrays at the base station will further enhance the capacity
of the system.
The above three technologies are also known as the three big pillars for
5G wireless [4] and they will get a lion’s share in augmenting the 5G capacity
1000×. In 5G, networks will be more and more heterogenous. Multi-RAT will
enable 5G devices to connect to 5G standard, 3G standard, 4G LTE, WiFi
and device-to-device (D2D) communications. There are two techniques which
are suggested in the literature for heterogenous networks (HeNets) of macro
cells and small cells.
• Biasing means that the preference will be given to the small cells even if it
has lower SINR, hence, network traﬃc of the heavily loaded macrocell could
be oﬀ-loaded to lightly loaded small cells.
• Muting means basically stopping the transmission from the macrocell when
the mobile user is served by the small cells which will enhance SINR of the
small cell considerably.
The idea is to have several small cells with base station employing many
small antennas connected with low power ampliﬁers. The aim is to exploit
elevation angle along with the azimuth angle so that we can have antenna
arrangements in 3-D, which is also known as full dimension MIMO [84]. In
fact all these three pillars are interrelated and one of them will inﬂuence the
other. All three techniques mentioned above will collectively work together to
augment capacity by a thousandfold [120]. mmWave band covers 30-300 GHz
corresponds to operating wavelength from 1-10 mm [142]. Hence one can in-
corporate many antennas in a comparatively smaller device since we know
that antenna array needs a spacing of at least half the wavelength. Besides,
dipole antenna size is usually also half wavelength. Let us make some typical
calculations for large scale antenna arrays. Consider a mobile headset of 10 cm
length, 1.5 cm thickness and 5 cm width. From our knowledge of antenna ar-
rays, antenna spacing for antenna arrays should be at least λ
2 = 15 cm for
1 GHz operating frequency. Assume it is a halfwave dipole antenna we are
considering. Hence for one antenna along with the spacing between antenna
arrays it occupies 30 cm. So we cannot place more than a single antenna on
such a mobile phone at 1 GHz. Consider mmWave communication at 30 GHz.
A single antenna needs a space of 1 cm. Now we have the scope for placing at
least 10 antennas along length and 5 antennas along breadth. Further, such
antenna arrays are allowed to be placed on the top and bottom surface of the
mobile headset. Hence a total of 100 antennas can be accommodated on the
same mobile headset for 30 GHz wireless communications. Similar calculations
will enable us to put thousands of antennas at the base station easily. There-
fore large scale antenna arrays are a possibility. The bandwidth of mmWave
band is also huge. A 10% bandwidth at 60 GHz is 6 GHz. Hence the channel
capacity which is directly proportional to the bandwidth will be quite high.
One of the major hurdles in mmWave band is that path loss is very high,

thereby highly dense small cell networks may be deployed. So all the above
three suggestions will collectively improve the network capacity in order to
meet the demands of 5G wireless.
What is the motivation behind using large scale antenna arrays in mmWave
communication? According to the Friis transmission formula, the received
power for line of sight (LOS) propagation can be expressed as
Pr = PtGtGr(λ/4πd)2
(7.25)
where Pr is the received signal power, Pt is the transmitted signal power, Gt is
the gain of transmitting antenna, Gr is the gain of receiving antenna, λ is the
wavelength of the signal used and d is the distance between the transmitter
and receiver.
The path loss at the mmWave is higher than 2. It has been reported in the
literature that path loss exponent varies from 1.7-2.5 for LOS and 3.5-6 for
non-LOS [108]. Also note that the mmWave is strongly dependent on the
blockage since there is less diﬀraction and specular propagation is more pro-
nounced. It leads to a bimodal channel based on absence or presence of LOS.
mmWave beams will be like a ﬂashlight and interference may not play a sig-
niﬁcant role. In handoﬀs and initial access in mmWave, it basically needs to
align the transmitter (base station) and receiver (mobile user) which is quite
challenging as the beams are very narrow. Hence, looking at the above ex-
pression for Pr, one can notice that it is directly proportional to the square
of the operating wavelength. Hence at higher frequencies like mmWave, the
received power will be reduced signiﬁcantly. For a ﬁxed distance, if we want
to increase the received signal power at mmWave, we can increase the gain of
the transmitting and receiving antennas. Mobile users are usually small so we
will not be able to put many antennas on the mobile headset. But base sta-
tions are large we may put hundreds to thousands of antennas. From antenna
theory, we know that the gain of the antenna can be increased signiﬁcantly for
large antenna arrays. We could also do transmit beamforming from the base
station and direct the beams toward the user, which signiﬁcantly reduce trans-
mit power and minimize the interference such as shown in Figure 1.4. Major
hurdles for mmWave communications are higher path loss and high attenu-
ation due to rainfall, snowfall, fog, foliage and atmospheric absorption [106].
Raindrop size is of the order of millimeters and hence raindrops will scat-
ter mmWave signals. Some typical values for these said attenuations are at a
distance of 200 m which is a typical distance for a small cell.
• Loss due to atmospheric absorption due to H2O and O2 is 0.02 dB.
• For heavy rainfall at 110 mm/h, a 4-dB loss is observed.
• For heavy snowfall at 10 mm/h and fog with visibility less than 50 m, a
0.1-dB loss is observed.
Propagation tends to be LOS and small scale fading has minimal eﬀect on the

218
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
received signal and channel impulse response. For LOS propagation, it may
be possible to estimate channel by estimating the direction of arrival (DOA),
hence pilot contamination issues may be overcome. Since mmWave propaga-
tion is predominantly LOS, the channel matrix will be low rank, hence there
will be no multiplexing gain for point-to-point MIMO communications. But for
multiuser MIMO there can be multiplexing gains from multiple user commu-
nication with base station [119]. mmWave signals cannot pass through bricks
and concrete walls, hence there should be diﬀerent cells indoors and outdoors.
Backhaul transmission can be made adaptive for mmWave massive MIMO by
electronically steering the beams of antenna arrays, hence there won’t be the
requirement of physically adjusting the antenna alignment of dish antennas
in microwave backhaul transmission. While mobile users move around, beam-
forming weights need to be adjusted adaptively so that antenna beams from
the user will be always be directed toward the base station. Complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) is one of the enabling technologies for
mmWave since one can integrate mixers, low-noise ampliﬁer, power ampliﬁer
and inter-frequency ampliﬁers in a single package.

Some possible IoT applications in real life scenarios are mentioned below.
• Smart devices in the home may connect with the smart devices in the neigh-
borhood and cooperate with each other to extinguish ﬁre.
• When people are doing window shopping in shopping malls, information
about the location of discounted items may be alerted to customers using
mobile clouds.
• Alerts for upcoming meetings will be given to the oﬃce goers and ﬁles neces-
sary for such meetings may be automatically transferred to the user’s device.
• Cars will inform on the user’s mobile phone about the status of fuel, engine
oil and battery.
• From vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, the shortest route to
the destination for the cars may be obtained.
• From vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, situation about the traﬃc
jam or emergency on the road can be obtained in real time.
• It will allow us to experience true real life inversive multimedia experiences
using virtual reality and augmented reality anywhere and anytime.

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
There will be high demand for remote control of devices like trains, buses and
cars. Things we see will be connected and create the world of IoT. Hence the
underlying network operations like security, identity, mobility, etc. should be
scalable in order to cope with an outburst of IoT. Smart devices will connect
to each other and share their information, which is also known as D2D commu-
nication. D2D communication basically allows users nearby to communicate
directly instead of the long radio hops via base station.
7.4.1
V2V and V2I channel models
From the V2V channel measurement results reported in [78], ﬁrst delay bins
exhibit better than Rayleigh fading, whereas longer delay bins are worse than
Rayleigh fading. It has been observed that Weibull distribution ﬁts better than
the other fading distribution like Nakagami. The PDF of Weibull distribution
is given by
fW (r) = β
αβ rβ−1exp(−( r
α)β)
(7.27)
where β is the shape parameter and α is the scale parameter given by α =
r
E(r2)
Γ(1+ 2
β ). β = 2 is a better ﬁt for V2V channels [72]. The Root mean square
(RMS) delay spread is ﬁtted to a lognormal distribution. The V2V spectrum
is a little bit smoother than the classical Jake spectrum [51]. Table 7.2 shows
the channel metrics [73] like path loss exponent (n), mean delay spread and
Doppler spread for highway, rural and urban scenarios. The channel metrics
for V2I communications for rural macrocell, urban macrocell and microcell
are listed in Table 7.3. It has been reported that the Doppler spectrum for
rural macrocell follows Jake’s spectrum, Urban macrocell Doppler spectrum
follows double exponential elevation power spectrum and microcells doppler
spectrum follows similar to macrocells.

MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
End to end performance analysis of mobile D2D cooperative communication
over cascaded α−µ channel has been reported in the literature [8]. The system
model assumes that there are three nodes, viz. source, relay and destination
nodes. Relay node assists the source node in transmitting data to the desti-
nation node by applying amplify and forward protocol. No direct link path
is assumed from the source to the destination. A lower bound on the aver-
age symbol error probability for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) has been
derived and validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
7.5
Large scale MIMO systems
In large scale MIMO systems, we will consider hundreds of antennas at the
transmitter and receiver. Basically, this will be a point-to-point MIMO sys-
tem like D2D communication mentioned above. For large antenna arrays at
the transmitter and receiver of a point-to-point MIMO system, there is a
prominent eﬀect also known as channel hardening eﬀect in the literature. It
has been observed that channel is no more random for such cases. From the
Marcenko-Pastur law from random matrix theory [19], the empirical distribu-
tion of the eigenvalues of HHH converges almost surely to the density
f(x) = (c)+δ(x) +
p
(x −a)+(b −x)+

(7.30)
where c = r−1
r , r = N
M , a = (1−√r)2, a = (1+√r)2, (z)+ = max(z, 0) and H
is the MIMO channel matrix of dimension M × N whose elements may have
any classical or generalized fading distribution with zero mean and variance
1
M .
7.5.1
Low complexity MIMO detection
Due to the channel hardening eﬀect, it is possible to employ machine learning-
based low complexity algorithms whose performance is comparable to maxi-
mum likelihood (ML) detection with reduced complexity. Note that the de-
coding complexity of an ML decoder is the number of metric computations
required to reach the ML decision. The number of metric calculations for ML
detection [20] can be computed as |As|N where As is the alphabet size for
M-ary modulation scheme used and N is the number of transmit antennas.
For instance, for a 5 × 5 MIMO system employing 16-QAM modulation, the
number of such metric calculations is 165 = 10, 48, 576. Hence it is almost
impossible to have a detection scheme like ML at the receiver for large scale
MIMO systems. Some low complexity algorithms are reported in [141], viz.
likelihood ascent search, reactive Tabu search, k-neighborhood search for ZF
solution [12], etc. The above-mentioned method actually searches the neigh-

MIMO for 5G Mobile Communications
223
borhood of ZF solution. Similarly, we may initialize the above algorithm with
MMSE [47] or lattice reduction aided ZF or MMSE solution and search its
neighborhood for a solution with a better cost function. This iterative pro-
cess will not stop until it reaches the threshold cost value. In [112], it has
been mentioned that one may not look for all the neighborhoods, but instead
look for some reduced neighborhood which is more likely to have the solution,
which is also known as reduced neighborhood search algorithms.
7.5.2
Perfect space time codes
At the transmitter, one can employ perfect space time codes [88]. Such space
time codes can achieve full diversity, a non-vanishing determinant for increased
spectral eﬃciency, uniform average transmitted energy per antenna and rate
r ≥1. The rate r perfect space time codes for a MIMO system with N trans-
mitting antennas can be constructed as [36]

where
• Dk = diag(zk, σ(zk), σ2(zk), · · · , σN−1(zk)).
• λ is a real and scalar value designed to meet the energy constraint.
• γ is a unit magnitude complex number dependent on N.
• Γ = (γeN, e1, e2, · · · , eN−2, eN−1) where ei represents the ith column of a
N × N identity matrix.
7.5.3
Bounds on capacity
The point-to-point MIMO system for equal power allocation has instantaneous
capacity as
C = log2|IRH + PQ
σ2nN |bits/s/Hz
(7.32)
where RH is the rank of the channel matrix H and Q is the complex Wishart
channel matrix. For full rank MIMO channel, then RH = min(M, N) = m,
we have
C =
m
X
i=1
log2(1 + Pλi

(7.33)
Since the trace of Q is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues, we may write the
above equation for two cases:

• The best case analysis when the singular values of channel are equal

If we normalize the channel gain coeﬃcients to one we have trace(Q) = MN,
then the lower and upper bounds on the instantaneous capacity of the channel
is given by

with Q function as a part of the integrand. This makes integrations diﬃcult

commonly, it is approximated in terms of exponential functions. We have
used the approximation proposed by Chiani et al. in [16].

It shall be noted here that the MGF of α −µ distributed SNR is in the form
of Meijer’s G function. To the best of our knowledge, Meijer’s G function
is not implemented in the current versions of MATLAB toolboxes. So, it is
not possible to directly evaluate Meijer’s G function in MATLAB. However,

246
MIMO wireless communications over generalized fading channels
current versions of MATLAB are equipped with an interface that integrates
Mathematica R
⃝notebook ﬁles with itself. And Meijer’s G function is imple-
mented in Mathematica. A notebook ﬁle can be opened using command “mu-
pad” in the MATLAB command window and a notebook ﬁle will open which
can execute Mathematica instructions and this can solve our purpose of eval-
uating MGF of α −µ distributed SNR.
