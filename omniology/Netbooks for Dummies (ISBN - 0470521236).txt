About the Author
Joel McNamara started using computers in the early Cenozoic era of personal 
computing (1980 to be exact). If NorthStar Horizon, ARPANET, PDP-11, Kaypro, 
and Apple Lisa ring a bell (when dinosaurs roamed the earth), like in the movie 
Zelig, he was there. Over the years, Joel has worked as a programmer, techni-
cal writer, and manager for a number of companies in the high-tech sector.
Joel currently consults and writes on things he fi nds interesting. Living in an 
undisclosed location somewhere in the Pacifi c Northwest, he likes boats of 
all kinds and is fond of old-school technologies such as celestial navigation 
and Morse Code.
Joel is also the author of ASUS Eee PC For Dummies, GPS For Dummies (1st and 
2nd Editions), Geocaching For Dummies, and Secrets of Computer Espionage: 
Tactics & Countermeasures — all brought to you by Wiley Publishing, Inc.

Introduction
I
t’s always pretty boring to start a book with a bit of history. But hey, this 
is important, so I’ll make it quick and painless. You have my word. (I plead 
guilty to falling asleep in history classes myself, so I can relate.)
In October 2007, a Taiwanese company named ASUS, which was primarily 
known for making computer motherboards and other components, started 
selling a diminutive laptop called the Eee PC. The laptop had an itsy bitsy, 
7-inch screen, an underpowered processor (compared with the latest and 
greatest dual core chips), a dinky keyboard, and a user interface that looked 
like it was designed by Toys“R”Us.
Pundits immediately dismissed the little laptop. Some of the quotes I remem-
ber hearing include the following: “Who in their right mind would buy some-
thing like that when for a bit over a hundred dollars more they could get a 
full-size, low-end laptop with a usable screen, decent processor, and built-in 
DVD drive?” “The keyboard keys are too small for typing unless you have 
toothpick-size fingers.” “A 900 MHz processor? You have to be kidding! I 
didn’t know they even made anything that slow anymore.” And finally, “Well it 
might be okay for little kids, but adults will never go for it.”
Ah, you’ve gotta love those pundits. They make the world go round. They 
had no clue — and I suspect ASUS didn’t either — that the Eee PC would 
be an industry game changer. It was one of those right-place-at-the-right-
time products that opened up a huge new market niche. By the end of 2007, 
around 400,000 little laptops were sold — mostly to adults, by the way. In 
2008, an estimated 11.4 million units were purchased. ABI Research predicts 
35 million units will ship in 2009 and a whopping 139 million of the little lap-
tops will be sold in 2013.
It turns out there was (and is) a huge demand for a portable computer that’s 
somewhere between the size of a cell phone and a conventional laptop. And 
because there was money to be made, more than a dozen companies jumped 
on the bandwagon and began selling their own versions of Lilliputian laptops.
These small wonders, now pretty much universally known as netbooks, are 
lightweight and compact laptops (right around two pounds and a little bit 
bigger than this book), durable enough not to mind getting knocked about a 
bit, cheaper (for the most part) than a conventional laptop, and are loaded 
with all sorts of hardware and software that you need for accessing the Net 
(thus the name). They’re perfect for doing a variety of personal, work, and 
entertainment-related tasks from home or on the road.

Netbooks For Dummies 
So with that bit of history out of the way, I can get right down to business 
and start telling you about this book. As you probably guessed from the title, 
it’s all about netbooks. In the coming pages, I tell you everything you need to 
know about these nifty little laptops, including their capabilities, limitations, 
and how to get the most from them.
Who This Book Is For
If you’re browsing through this book at your favorite bookseller right now 
(either online or in a good old fashioned bookstore) and you’re trying to 
decide whether you should shell out some hard-earned cash for this book, 
ask yourself these three simple questions:
 
✓ Are you thinking about purchasing a netbook?
 
✓ Have you recently bought a netbook (or maybe scored one as a gift)?
 
✓ Have you owned a netbook for a while, but want to get more out of it?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, you can immediately proceed 
to the cash register or online shopping cart because this book is for you. (If 
you’re still not convinced, feel free to continue flipping through the pages to 
make your decision.)
Although your netbook user manual covers the basics, there’s a good chance 
it doesn’t go into a whole lot of depth (which is perfectly understandable 
from the manufacturer’s perspective; you don’t want a big user manual when 
your goal is to offer an affordable computer).
With this book, I take you beyond the user guide and the online help, expand-
ing on topics and programs, presenting a variety of subjects that aren’t 
covered, and pointing out places where you can get more information on the 
Internet — all in the easy-to-read-and-understand style of the For Dummies 
series.
Setting Some Expectations
Before getting started, I’d like to set a few expectations about what you’ll be 
reading, just so you and I are on the same page (literally and figuratively):
 
✓ I’m not one of those netbook fanboys who say netbooks are the be-all, 
end-all perfect computer. (I personally don’t think such a thing will ever 
exist.) Netbooks have some distinct limitations, which I honestly share 
with you.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ When the first netbooks debuted, most of them ran one version or 
another of the Linux operating system. You can still get Linux netbooks, 
but the Windows models have proven much more popular, and because 
of that I primarily focus on Windows netbooks. (Take heart Linux users: 
I still discuss Linux netbooks here and there, as well as provide a few 
resources.)
 
✓ I expect you’ve used Windows before and are familiar with the operating 
system, so I don’t spend time walking you through how to use a mouse, 
copying and pasting, and other basics. However, I focus on things that 
make a netbook a little different to use compared to running Windows 
on a desktop or conventional laptop.
 
✓ Don’t expect Consumer Reports–style, specific product recommenda-
tions. New models are released much too quickly, and any netbook I rec-
ommend today could easily be yesterday’s news in a matter of months. 
(Although you won’t find any product endorsements, I do arm you with 
plenty of information to make a good choice if you’re in the market for a 
netbook.)
How This Book Is Organized
This book is conveniently divided into several parts. The content in each 
part is related (more or less), but, by all means, feel free to skip around and 
read about what interests you the most.
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks
This part of the book introduces you to netbooks. I start with a chapter that 
provides a quick roadmap to everything I cover in this book. Then I launch 
into telling you all about netbooks, especially how they differ from conven-
tional laptops. I help you make sense of the myriad of features and select a 
netbook that will work for you. Because netbooks come with a number of 
different operating systems, I provide a chapter that compares and contrasts 
the various options. And I conclude with a chapter that tells you what to 
expect and what you should do when you pull a shiny new netbook out of the 
box for the first time.
Part II: Using Your Netbook
In this part of the book, I get down to business (and fun), stepping you 
through what you need to know about using your netbook. I begin with a 
chapter on networking. (Hey, it’s called a netbook, and you’re going to be 

4
Netbooks For Dummies 
using it a lot to connect to the Net, so this is a good place to start.) I devote 
a chapter to productivity suites (both traditional software such as Microsoft 
Office and the newer generation of online applications like Zoho). All work 
and no play makes for a dull netbook, so I devote a chapter to entertainment 
(including video, music, and games). I also cover security issues and provide 
a survey of Net communication programs and social networking sites that 
lend themselves to the netbook form factor. I wrap up this part with a chap-
ter that introduces you to the wonders of GPS and tells you how to turn your 
netbook into a mobile navigator.
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories 
and Hardware
With a cutting-edge solid state drive, 802.11 wireless, an Ethernet jack, and 
webcam, you might think your netbook is all ready to go. Well, yes and no. 
Many users expand the storage with Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, maybe 
add a DVD player/writer, perhaps charge the laptop in a car or plane, or con-
nect any number of peripheral devices to the USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports. 
This part is about add-on netbook hardware and accessories, and I discuss 
everything from hooking up external devices to appropriate carrying cases.
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood
In this part, I pop the hood (or bonnet if you’re from the U.K.) on your 
netbook and see what makes it tick. I cover a collection of slightly more 
advanced — but not too geeky — topics compared with elsewhere in the 
book. I start with a chapter on troubleshooting your netbook — hopefully, 
you’ll never need to refer to it. I also cover backing up and restoring your 
netbook, upgrading memory and internal drives, and changing Windows 
settings. I tell you what you need to know about drivers (I’m talking about 
system software here, not golf) and considerations for dealing with BIOS. 
(BIOS is an abbreviation for basic input/output system, which is code a com-
puter runs when it is powered on before the operating system loads.)
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books have a part called The Part of Tens, and this one is no 
exception. In this part, you can find a chapter devoted to the best netbook 
Web sites, blogs, and forums on the Internet. I also give you a list of ten real 
cool netbook hardware hacks.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
If you’ve ever pawed through the pages of a For Dummies book before, 
undoubtedly you’ve seen all sorts of little icons scattered throughout the 
book. In keeping with that fine For Dummies tradition, this one is no different. 
So as a reminder (or first time explanation), here’s the scoop on the various 
icons you’ll encounter in the coming pages:
 
This is just a friendly little reminder about something of importance. Because 
I can’t be there in person to tap you on the shoulder or clear my throat, this 
icon will have to do.
 
Every now and then, I may need to get a little geeky on you. Maybe it’s to pro-
vide a bit more detail on a topic or clue you in to something cool that’s a little 
techy. In such cases, rest assured I either give you a plain-English explanation 
or point you off to a Web site where you can find out more.
 
This is a tip or trick designed to make your life easier; usually gained from 
practical experience and often not found in the user guide or online help; or 
if it is there, it’s buried deep in some obscure paragraph or maybe perhaps 
requires a suitable translation.
 
The little bomb icon means “Danger, Will Robinson!” (Not a “Lost in Space” 
fan? Look it up on Google.) While I’m digressing here, between you and me I’ve 
always thought they needed to update this icon with something a little more 
contemporary. The icon first appeared in conjunction with computers back in 
1984 when the Apple Macintosh first came out. And honestly, when was the 
last time people even used bombs that looked like that? Anyway, whenever 
you see the bomb, be sure to pay close attention. It means something you do 
(or don’t do) may cause the kind of trouble most rational people like to avoid.
Some Things to Keep in Mind
Before you get going with the rest of the book — and I know you can’t wait — 
I’d like to mention a couple of things:
 
✓ As I mention earlier, this book is not meant to replace your netbook’s 
user manual — especially considering the large number of different net-
books that are available on the market. This is Netbooks For Dummies, 
not a leather-bound, multivolume set of the Encyclopedia of Netbooks.
 
✓ I’m a self-admitted cheapskate who likes good values. That means I’m 
going to tell you about a variety of free and low-cost programs as well 

6
Netbooks For Dummies 
as offer tips on how to get the best deal on a netbook. In these hard eco-
nomic times, every dollar counts, and hey, it’s hip to be frugal!
 
✓ You can find lots of references to Web sites in this book. I’m sure you’ve 
noticed that Web sites change (and appear and disappear) about as fast 
and randomly as the stock market rises and falls. If you try entering a 
Web address in your browser and it doesn’t work, don’t get frustrated 
and walk away. I provide you with enough information to find what 
you’re looking for with some follow-up Google searching.
 
✓ You’re not going to find every netbook or netbook-compatible program 
in existence mentioned in the book. I’ve tried my best to list many of the 
more popular netbook manufacturers and programs, but as with any 
author, I’m faced with the harsh realities of page count constraints. So 
please don’t get upset if I didn’t mention your netbook or a program 
you use.
 
✓ Some days I wish the pace of technology and the consumer electronics 
marketplace would take a short vacation and stand still for a moment or 
two. It’s a foregone conclusion that between the time I write these words 
and this book is published, new netbooks will appear sporting spiffy 
new features and technology. Because I can’t see into the future, keep in 
mind this is a snapshot of the general state of the netbook world circa 
late 2009/early 2010.
Okay, that finishes up the introduction, so on with the show!

Part I
Getting Started 
with Netbooks

In this part . . .
I
n the fall of 2007, a small laptop called the Eee PC 
appeared on the market and took the world by storm. 
Dubbed a netbook, this Lilliputian laptop ushered in a new 
era of affordable and ultra-mobile personal computing. 
These go-anywhere, Internet-enabled laptops proved to be 
a perfect combination of size, price, and performance, and 
consumers quickly opened up their wallets and purses.
This part introduces you to netbooks. I start with some 
general information about the little laptops — as well as 
provide you with a roadmap of what you can find in the 
book. I then tell you exactly what netbooks are and how 
they differ from laptops. If you’re in the market for a net-
book, you’re faced with a confusing array of models and 
features. Considering this, I bring you up to speed on all 
the options and provide guidance on selecting and pur-
chasing a netbook that best meets your needs. I conclude 
this part with a chapter that gets you familiar with your 
new netbook and shows you how to easily exchange data 
with another computer.

S
o you want to know about netbooks? Well you’ve come to the right 
place. Obviously, this entire book is about the Lilliputian laptops, but in 
this chapter, I distill essential information to give you an overview of every-
thing you need to know about netbooks.
After you read this chapter, you should be able to talk knowledgably about 
netbooks at cocktail parties, and you may even gain a reputation for being 
techno-savvy — be careful though, as such status often results in a never-
ending stream of phone calls from family and friends asking for help with 
their computer problems.
In addition to the big picture view, this chapter also serves as a roadmap 
to the rest of the book. In the coming pages, I refer you to specific chapters 
where you can get more info about a certain topic or find out how to get your 
netbook to perform a specific task.

Netbook Nuts and Bolts
More than likely, you’ve wondered just exactly what a netbook is and how it’s 
different than a laptop. Here’s the lowdown. A netbook (also called a mini-
laptop, sub-notebook, or mobile Internet device) has these key features:
 
✓ Compact size and light weight: Netbooks are lighter, usually below or 
right around 3 pounds, and come in a smaller case than a conventional 
laptop. The smaller size is achieved with a smaller screen (typically 10 
inches or less) and a smaller keyboard that doesn’t have full-size keys. 
See Figure 1-1 for a size comparison between a laptop and a netbook.
 
Figure 1-1:

laptop with 
a netbook 
resting on 
top.
 
 
✓ Internet ready: As the name suggests, a netbook is ready to connect to 
the Internet. Netbooks have 802.11 wireless cards and an Ethernet jack 
for wired connections.
 
✓ Minimal hardware features: Unlike a full-size laptop, you won’t find 
a DVD drive, internal modem, FireWire port, PC card slot, or more 
than two or three USB ports on a netbook. Netbooks also have slower 

11
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Netbooks
processors compared to full-size laptops. All of this helps keep the costs 
down, which is a nice segue into the next bullet.
 
✓ Affordable: Netbooks are currently priced between $250 and $600. Many 
are under $400, with the average price falling on a regular basis.
When you see a netbook for the first time, you may be surprised by its size. 
However, don’t let the toy-like appearance of the mini-laptop fool you. This is 
a real computer, and for the most part, it can do just about anything a normal 
PC can — with a few exceptions that I discuss coming up.
 
A netbook isn’t just a cheap laptop. Its diminutive size allows you to carry it 
around more often and take it places where carrying a full-size laptop would 
be a hassle.
I want to emphasize that a netbook isn’t really designed to be your primary com-
puter. Its purpose is to be a highly mobile, convenient laptop you can take just 
about anywhere. It’s great for browsing the Web, sending e-mail, using Skype (a 
service for making phone calls over the Net), and other Internet-centric activities. 
It’s also suitable for basic word processing and spreadsheet work. However, the 
under-powered processor (and small screen and reduced-size keyboard on some 
models) limits its usefulness for certain tasks, such as playing graphics-intensive 
games, desktop publishing, or running computationally intensive programs.
That’s a brief description of what a netbook is. For more information, read 
Chapter 2, where I provide a lot more detail.
Picking the Perfect Netbook
When you’ve decided you need (or want) a netbook, now comes the chal-
lenge of selecting one that earns the Goldilocks rating of “just right.”
When ASUS released the first netbooks in the fall of 2007, making a selec-
tion was simple because there were only a few models to choose from. Now, 
thanks to the popularity of the little laptops, there are dozens of models 
available from a wide variety of manufacturers.
 
In Chapter 3, I provide a list of netbook manufacturer Web sites so you can 
check what’s currently available on the market. And in Chapter 22, I list a 
number of netbook news and review sites.
When selecting the perfect netbook, start with your wallet or your purse. How 
much money do you want to spend? At the time I’m writing this, netbooks 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
are priced between $250 and $600 — with many models in the $350 range. (I 
expect the entry-point models to drop to around $200 or perhaps even lower, 
so make sure to look around at prices.)
Just like most other computers, the more money you spend, the more whis-
tles and bells you get. Don’t dismiss low-priced netbooks, though. In most 
cases, they provide more than enough function to get basic tasks done.
Next, sift through the features. Netbooks come with a laundry list of some-
times confusing features. (I go into lots of detail on features in Chapter 3.) 
When it comes to specifications, here are the primary features you should 
key in on:
 
✓ Processor: Netbooks sport a number of different processors. Don’t 
expect the performance you get from a conventional laptop with a fast 
CPU. Netbooks aren’t designed to be high-performance computers; how-
ever, this isn’t to say they’re as slow as molasses. Instead of horsepower, 
focus on the processor that provides decent performance coupled with 
low power consumption. (I discuss available processors in depth in 
Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Battery life: The processor and the battery used (batteries typically 
are 3-cell or 6-cells; the more cells, the more power stored) dictate how 
long you can use the netbook without plugging it into a power source. 
Whether you have wireless turned on or off and what programs you’re 
running also impact battery life. The first generation of netbooks got 
only a few hours of battery life. Current models can easily achieve 
upwards of five or more hours.
 
 Longer battery life means a bigger battery. Netbooks that claim eight-to-
ten-hour battery lives are noticeably heavier and thicker than models 
with smaller batteries.
 
✓ Storage: Netbooks models come with a variety of internal storage 
options. Solid state drives (SSDs) are the wave of the future and use 
memory chips to store data. They’re lighter and have no moving parts 
to malfunction, but they’re currently more expensive and hold a limited 
amount of data compared with traditional hard drives. Hard drives add 
a bit more weight to a netbook, but offer more storage space at a lesser 
price than an SSD.
 
✓ Keyboard size: To fit a netbook in such a small package, manufactur-
ers need to make some compromises, and one of them is the size of 
the keyboard. Different models have different reduced-size keyboards. 
Some users with larger hands and fingers may find it difficult to type on 
smaller keyboards. The size of the keys can vary between manufacturers 
and models. Most 10-inch-screen netbooks have very usable keyboards 
although they are reduced in size.

13
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Netbooks
 
✓ Screen size: Netbooks generally come with screens ranging from 7 to 10 
inches, with different levels of resolution. Ten-inch screens are the stan-
dard these days. Smaller-screen models are more compact (see Figure 
1-2) but have smaller keyboards and don’t have as much screen real 
estate — which means more scrolling when browsing the Web.
 
Figure 1-2:

the size

between 
a netbook 
with a 
9-inch 
screen and 
one with 
a 10-inch 
screen.
 
Another one of the decisions you’ll need to make when selecting a netbook 
is what operating system you’ll use. Netbooks come installed with different 
versions of Windows and Linux (and there’s currently talk of other operating 
systems being available in the future, including Apple’s OS X and Google’s 
Chrome OS). Based on sales figures, most people opt for Windows (which 
I primarily focus on in this book). I list all the operating systems currently 
used on netbooks and discuss their pros and cons in Chapter 4.
After you’ve narrowed down which netbook model you want to purchase, the 
last step is pulling out your credit card and buying the little laptop. I provide 
you with advice on this in Chapter 3, but in the meantime, here are some 
essential points: 
 
✓ Stick with one of the larger netbook manufacturers. Although a lesser-
known brand laptop may work great, it’s usually safer to go with a well-
known brand. The more units that have sold, the greater the chance an 
online user community has formed. In many cases, online user commu-
nities offer faster and better support than the manufacturer.
 
✓ Read buyer reviews and feedback (especially from online retailer 
Web sites such as Amazon and Newegg). Get as many opinions as you 

14
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
can. If you remember your statistics class, the larger the sample size, the 
more meaningful the data.
 
✓ If you get a chance, find a local retailer who stocks netbooks and 
check them out in person. In the early days of netbooks, this was tough 
because only online stores carried the little laptops. Now, more brick-
and-mortar retailers are stocking the wee computers, as my Irish cous-
ins call them.
 
✓ Shop around because prices can vary — especially online. Every 
dollar saved counts, and you can easily save 20 bucks on up, depending 
on where you purchase your netbook.
Getting Started with a New Netbook
Pulling a new computer out of its box for the first time reminds me of opening 
up presents at Christmas when I was a kid. The year’s “big” present almost 
always came in a large box. But in the case of netbooks, the big gift from 
Santa comes in a small package.
First things first. Read the manual! It may be only a quick-start guide, with 
the full user manual tucked away on a DVD or installed on the netbook’s hard 
drive, but in any case, read it. It will make your life much easier — trust me.
I always like to plug in the power and fully charge the battery before I start 
using a new laptop. If you’re impatient, go ahead and fire up the netbook but 
keep it plugged in to a power source, and after you shut it down, let it fully 
charge.
While the netbook is charging, read the user manual (yes, I sound like a broken 
record) and get familiar with all the buttons, keys, jacks and connectors.
 
If your netbook didn’t come with a paper user manual for you to read while 
you’re patiently waiting for the laptop to charge, visit the manufacturer Web 
site with another computer and download a PDF version of the manual to 
peruse.
When the netbook first starts up, more than likely you’ll need to go through 
some initial setup screens that customize the laptop for your location and 
time zone. This process is painless, so just follow the instructions and fill in 
the requested information.
In Chapter 5, I provide more information on what to do after you get your 
new netbook out of its box. I also discuss the very important topic of moving 
data between your netbook and another computer.
I’m guessing you’ll want to connect to the Internet — more sooner than later — 
so I talk about that next.

15
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Netbooks
Netbooks and Networks
The word net in netbook doesn’t apply to a hair net, fishing net, or Annette 
Funicello. Nope, net refers to Internet (or network), because when connected 
to the Net, the little laptop really shines.
All netbooks have an 802.11 wireless card for connecting to the Internet. If 
you’ve used Windows to connect to the Internet, a netbook works the same 
way. That means you need to do the following:
 
1. Make sure the wireless card is turned on.
 
2. Select an access point you want to connect to; use a correct password 
if the connection is encrypted.
 
3. Start using the Internet.
In addition to a wireless network card, netbooks also come with an Ethernet 
port for making a wired connection to the Internet or a local area network 
(LAN). You’ll need an RJ45 cable to do this. Just plug one end of the cable 
into the netbook and the other into a network jack, and Windows should 
automatically do the rest and connect.
If you need more details on connecting to the Internet, be sure to read Chapter 6. 
In addition to the basics, I also cover 3G modems, sharing files on Windows 
networks, and using your netbook to remotely connect to another computer.
Aside from doing e-mail and browsing the Web, an Internet connection pro-
vides you and your netbook with a wealth of opportunities for taking advan-
tage of second-generation Internet communications programs and social 
networking sites. The bring-it-anywhere nature of a netbook and a wireless 
Net connection allows you to use instant messages (IMs); Internet telephony 
(such as Skype); and social networking sites like Facebook, MySpace, and 
Twitter to your heart’s content. If you haven’t used these programs or sites 
before, be sure to read Chapter 10 to come up to speed.
Business or Pleasure
Because of their small size and portable nature, netbooks get a lot of use 
while on the road or around the house — either for business or pleasure. I 
find a netbook especially useful for the following:
 
✓ Checking and sending e-mail
 
✓ Browsing the Web
 
✓ Watching videos

16
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
✓ Listening to music
 
✓ Instant messaging and using Skype
 
✓ Working on word processing and spreadsheet documents when away 
from a primary computer
 
✓ Viewing digital photos
 
✓ Traveling (especially on airplanes, trains, and buses)
 
If your netbook uses Microsoft Windows as its operating system, it’s compat-
ible with all Windows programs — with the exception of some games. Just 
keep in mind that processor-intensive programs (such as graphics applica-
tions) run slower due to the netbook’s under-powered CPU. Also, a netbook’s 
small screen can make life a little challenging for programs that expect more 
screen real estate.
Business sense
When it comes to business, productivity suites like Microsoft Office or the 
free, open-source OpenOffice are a must — many netbooks come bundled 
with Microsoft Works, which is adequate for very basic word processing and 
spreadsheet work, but may not offer all of the features users come to expect 
for real business.
Aside from traditional productivity suites, it’s worthwhile considering Web-
based collections of programs such as Google Apps and Zoho (see Figure 
1-3). If there’s a Net connection nearby, these Web programs have a number 
of benefits. I fill you in on everything you need to know about both traditional 
and online productivity programs in Chapter 7.
Fun and games
Of course, netbooks are great for work, but they’re also great for play. All 
netbooks have sound cards that allow you to record (there’s a microphone 
jack) and listen to music and words (through the speaker/headphone jack). 
In addition to the jacks, netbooks also have a built-in microphone and 
speaker. With some basic software, you can turn your netbook into an over-
sized MP3 player or a handy digital tape recorder for recording classroom 
lectures and meetings.

17
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Netbooks

Most netbooks are about the size of a portable DVD player. In addition to 
size, they also share the ability to play movies. Because netbooks don’t have 
built-in DVD drives, you’ll need to purchase an external drive that plugs 
into the netbook’s USB port if you want to watch a movie on a disc. Another 
alternative is to use ripping software to convert the DVD movie into a file that 
can be played on a computer — this is usually an AVI format file. If your net-
book doesn’t have an external DVD/CD-ROM drive, you can rip the movie on 
another computer and then transfer a copy to your netbook.
Many netbooks also have built-in webcams for recording video or streaming 
with video-conferencing programs.
If you’re a computer gamer, you’re probably wondering whether you can use 
your netbook to play some of your favorite games. The answer is yes, with a 
few caveats. 
Many Windows games load and run seamlessly on a Windows netbook — 
for example, Figure 1-4 shows the ever-popular time-waster Solitaire. The 
exceptions are games that require lots of memory or a high-end graphics 
card. Most netbooks have pretty basic graphics chips that get bogged down 
or don’t work well (or at all) when playing graphics-intensive, 3-D games. 
In addition, the relatively under-powered processor and limited amount of 
memory found in netbooks can also slow things down to a crawl.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
Figure 1-4:

If your favorite game requires a lot of graphics and CPU (also known as the 
processor chip or the central processing unit) power, don’t hold your breath 
that it will work to your satisfaction on a netbook. Also, just because a game 
runs on a netbook doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have fun playing it — keep 
in mind the small screen and touchpad. That said, some new netbooks with 
faster graphics processors and more memory make better game machines 
than others. And there are active gaming communities on the Internet that 
provide a wealth of information on which games work on various models of 
netbooks and which don’t.
In Chapter 8, I go into much more detail on the fun and games aspects of net-
books. I show you how to use your netbook to watch videos, listen to music, 
and turn it into a game machine.
Better safe than sorry
Lots of early Internet users had high hopes that the Net would usher in a 
utopian era of greater community through worldwide inter-connectedness. 
Unfortunately, the architects of the Net never expected all the spam, viruses, 
worms, and other malware that lurk in the digital shadows waiting to pounce 
on an unsuspecting victim. Because a netbook is at its best when connected 
to the Net, it’s critical that you have your shields up when you’re zooming 
around in Internet-space. Chapter 9 is devoted to security, and in it I bring 
you up to speed on the latest programs and techniques for keeping the bad 
guys out of your netbook.

 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Netbooks
In addition to electronic threats, a netbook’s small size makes it a tempting 
target for theft. (The small size also makes it more prone to accidental loss.) 
There are a number of ways to reduce the chances of this happening and to 
protect your data just in case it does. In the chapter on security, I also dis-
cuss physical security approaches to keep your netbook out of harm’s way.
Going places
Although many cell phones have built-in GPS (Global Positioning System) 
functionality that tells you where you are and how to get places, if you have 
a netbook you might consider turning it into a netbook navigator. It’s easy 
to connect a GPS receiver to a netbook, and a number of available mapping 
programs can tell you where you are and how to get from Point A to Point B. 
Chapter 11 is all about netbooks and GPS.
Accessorizing and Expanding
After you purchase a netbook, if you’re like most users you’ll also eventually 
buy some additional hardware or accessories to go with it.
The first purchase is usually something to carry the netbook around with. I 
really encourage you to have some type of padding to protect your netbook 
from the inevitable bumps and bruises when toting it around town.
Because of its compact size, you have all sorts of carrying options available, 
including cases and sleeves (padding with no carrying straps) designed spe-
cifically for a specific model, cases originally designed for something (por-
table DVD players work great), and cheap do-it-yourself carriers. If you need 
some ideas, check out Chapter 12.
If you’re going to be using your netbook for trans-Pacific or Atlantic flights (or 
anytime you’re away from a power source for an extended period), you’ll prob-
ably want to consider carrying a spare battery. Battery life can vary dramati-
cally between netbook models, ranging from a few hours to five hours plus — I 
just tested a netbook that achieved an amazing eight hours of run time. This has 
to do with the size of the battery (the more cells, the longer the life); the type of 
processor (some are more energy efficient than others); the screen brightness; 
whether the wireless card is turned on; and what you’re doing (for example, 
watching a movie drains the battery faster than working on a spreadsheet).
In Chapter 13, I charge up your brain cells with everything you need to know 
about batteries — including third-party and universal batteries. I also discuss 
different ways to maximize battery life.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Netbooks typically don’t have as much hardware as comes with a full-size 
laptop (no DVD drive, dialup modem, mouse, and so on). However, most 
netbooks have at least two USB ports that you can use with all sorts of exter-
nal USB devices. That includes flash memory drives, external hard drives, 
and DVD/CD-ROM drives (such as the one shown in Figure 1-5). You can find 
much more on expanding storage for your netbook in Chapter 14.
 
Figure 1-5:

DVD drive

Unlike laptops, most netbooks don’t have PC card slots — a few models are 
coming with newer and smaller ExpressCard slots though. For adding hard-
ware, always think USB or SD memory card. (Most netbooks feature an SD 
card reader slot.)
In addition to storage devices, you can also connect mice, keyboards, 
modems, Bluetooth cards, and so on, to your netbook. And don’t forget that 
most netbooks feature a VGA port that allows you to connect an external 
monitor or multimedia projector — a netbook, PowerPoint, and a projector 
makes a killer presentation system. I go into a lot more detail on netbook 
peripherals in Chapter 15.
Technically Speaking
Technically speaking, a netbook is no different than a conventional laptop or 
desktop PC. Although some of the hardware components may be a little dif-
ferent, what works with Windows should work with your Windows netbook. 
You should be aware of a few technical details, though.

21
 Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know about Netbooks
Underneath the hood
First off, if your netbook came with Windows, you can make various tweaks 
to the operating system to improve performance and free up drive space. In 
Chapter 19, I tell you about various tune-up hints and tricks.
Related to the operating system are drivers — and I’m not talking about 
motor vehicle operators or what Tiger Woods uses. Drivers are programs 
that allow the operating system to interact with a computer’s hardware. And 
your netbook has a number of drivers you should know about — especially 
as manufacturers often release new versions of drivers to fix bugs or add 
features. Chapter 20 is the place to go for information on netbook drivers, 
including how to download and install new versions.
With a standard laptop or desktop computer, most users never deal with the 
BIOS (basic input/output system). If you pay attention when your computer 
starts up, you may see a very brief message about pressing a certain key to 
change BIOS settings. BIOS settings include options for which device to use for 
startup (such as hard drive, CD drive, or perhaps a memory card) and whether 
hardware components such as wireless cards and webcams are turned on. At 
times you may need to change BIOS settings for your netbook, and Chapter 21 
tells you what you need to know — including how to upgrade the BIOS.
You can swap out the hard drive (or solid state drive) on a number of differ-
ent netbook models, replacing it with a larger drive for more storage. Many 
netbooks also allow you to upgrade the internal memory (RAM) to speed up 
performance. I discuss both of these types of upgrades in Chapter 18.
If you’re technically inclined and like to mess around with hardware, you’ll 
have hours of fun with your netbook. There is an active hardware hacking 
community on the Internet that’s doing all sorts of modifications to different 
netbooks, such as backlit keyboards, internal GPS receivers, homebrew touch 
screens, and even modified cases. Chapter 23 tells you more and points you 
to a number of Web sites that have do-it-yourself hardware hacking projects.
When bad things happen to good netbooks
Always remember that a netbook is just a computer. And like any computer 
(or mechanical or electronic device) it may break. Because you can take 
netbooks just about anywhere, the more you use it and carry it around, the 
greater chance you could accidentally drop it, spill something on it, soak it 
during a downpour — you get the picture.
Although it’s a good idea to periodically back up any computer, with a net-
book backing up is a must. Consider that a computer is cheap to replace 

22
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
compared to the Great American Novel you’ve been working on for the past 
couple of years, a final paper for a class, or a sales presentation for work. 
Enough said. In Chapter 17, I fill you in on various backup strategies and discuss 
restoring your netbook back to its original state if something bad happens.
Most netbooks are dependable performers, but every now and then a gremlin 
may decide to pay a visit and cause you an inordinate amount of frustration 
and hair pulling. In Chapter 16, I present a list of troubleshooting tips for 
common netbook problems. Also be sure to read the next section, “Netbook 
Information on the Net.”
Netbook Information on the Net
If you purchase a netbook, you’ll unquestionably use the Internet to get the 
most out of your little laptop. When you have a question about your netbook, 
you can turn to the manufacturer’s Web site. Most companies have support 
sections where you can read frequently asked question (FAQ) lists, download 
updated versions of important files and utilities, replace a lost copy of a user 
manual, and submit technical support questions.
In addition to manufacturer sites, many popular netbook brands and models 
have independently operated Web sites and user forums. In my opinion, these 
are often better than “official” technical support, in that you hear the voices of 
many netbook users — some of them incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.
Finally, if you really catch the netbook bug, you may want to stay up-to-date 
on the latest news and industry gossip. Because of a relatively low price 
point and releases of new models with new features, some users often pur-
chase new netbooks to replace old models — similar to upgrading cellular/
mobile phones. There are a number of Web destinations devoted to the latest 
netbook news to keep you well informed.
 
Make sure your old netbook goes to a new home instead of gathering dust in a 
closet or sent on a one-way trip to the landfill. Give it to your children, favorite 
niece or nephew, or perhaps an older relative who doesn’t own a computer.
You can find netbook Web resources by doing a bit of Googling, or better yet, 
go to Chapter 22, where I provide you with a list of what I consider are some 
of the best netbook sites on the Net.

▶ Discovering what makes a netbook
▶ Tracking the evolution of netbooks
▶ Checking out the pros and cons of netbooks and laptops
▶ Understanding netbook capabilities and limitations
▶ Deciding that you need a netbook
You hear about them on the news. You read about them in magazine 
articles. You may have even played with a friend’s or perhaps tried out a 
demo model in a store. They’re netbooks. They’re hot, and they’re taking the 
world by storm.
These tiny laptops are inexpensive, versatile, and trendy. But what exactly 
are they? How are they different from full-size laptops? And what makes them 
so popular?
I’m glad you asked, because in this chapter I answer all these questions and 
more.
Honey, I Shrunk the Laptop!
That’s what a netbook looks like, doesn’t it? If you’ve never seen one, check 
out Figure 2-1. It’s as if you absentmindedly put a laptop into the washing 
machine, left the setting on hot water, and when you pulled it out, to your 
dismay you discovered it shrank. (By the way, don’t try this at home.)

ferent sizes

But a netbook is more than just a laptop that was left in the washer or was 
zapped by a mad scientist’s shrink ray. It’s important to understand some 
of the differences between the netbook and its full-size laptop cousins — 
especially a netbook’s capabilities and limitations. The following sections 
get the ball rolling.
Just what exactly is a netbook?
For starters, a netbook is a small laptop. But you already knew that, right?
 
Netbooks are also known as mini-laptops, sub-notebooks, and mobile Internet 
devices (MIDs). For the purpose of this book, I refer to them by their most 
commonly used name, netbook.
Here are some of the things that make netbooks different from conventional 
laptops:
 
✓ Compact size: Netbooks are smaller than conventional laptops. This is 
achieved through a smaller screen (typically 10 inches or smaller) and a 
reduced-size keyboard.
 
 To get a better idea of the size of a netbook compared with a laptop (and 
other things), visit a cool Web site called sizeasy (http://sizeasy.
com). It compares physical dimensions of various products. Search for 
your favorite netbook and see how it stacks up measurement-wise.

25
 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
 
✓ Light weight: Netbooks are lighter than most laptops and usually weigh 
in around 3 pounds or less. The compact size and feather weight make 
carrying around a netbook a breeze — especially compared with a typi-
cal 6-pound-plus laptop.
 
✓ Internet ready: Netbooks could be more appropriately called internet-
books. The reason why is these little laptops are all ready to connect to the 
Internet — take your pick of built-in 802.11 wireless or cabled Ethernet con-
nections. The growing abundance of Wi-Fi hotspots makes the easy-to-carry 
netbook perfect for quick sessions of Web browsing or e-mail checking.
 
✓ No-frills hardware: You won’t find a DVD drive, internal modem, 
FireWire, PC card slots, or half a dozen USB ports on a netbook. 
Additionally, netbooks have relatively low-powered processors com-
pared with full-size laptops. All of this helps keep the cost down, which 
is a nice segue into the next bullet.
 
✓ Affordable: You don’t have to pay an arm and leg for a netbook — list 
prices currently range between $250 and $600, with many models priced 
under $400. If you shop around, you can pick up a basic netbook for 
around $250 or even less.
 
Some manufacturers are pushing models they call netbooks that come with 
screens larger than 10 inches. Don’t fall for the hype — these are more like 
lightweight laptops than netbooks. If you buy something someone calls a 
netbook with an 11- or 12-inch screen, you’re getting a bigger case to accom-
modate the screen and a heavier computer. In my opinion, only computers 
with 10-inch screens (plus or minus a tenth of an inch or two) or smaller are 
representative of true netbooks.
 
In Chapter 3, I go into depth about all the features you find in various netbook 
models so you can make an informed buying decision.
Prehistoric netbooks
The road to modern netbooks is littered with the fossilized remains of small 
laptops that, for one reason or another, never quite achieved popularity. Put 
on your Indiana Jones fedora for a moment or two so you can unearth a few 
evolutionary ancestors of the contemporary netbook.
Going through a closet filled with dusty, obsolete junk (er, I mean my histori-
cal computing device collection), I come across a mid-1990s HP 100LX, shown 
in Figure 2-2. 

26
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
Figure 2-2: 
Oldies but 
goodies: an

Libretto

and, for 
comparison, 
a first-gen 
Eee PC 701 
from 2007 
(left).
 
The 100LX came out in the days before Windows 3.0 — that was the first ver-
sion of Windows that enjoyed widespread popularity. It fit in your palm, had a 
bunch of productivity applications built in, sported a full, yet tiny keyboard, 
ran DOS, and was powered by ubiquitous AA batteries.
The popularity of Windows squeezed the HP family of palmtops out of the 
market. And because of the success of Windows, Microsoft rolled out an 
operating system specifically designed for mobile devices — mostly to com-
pete with the popular Palm PDA. Called Windows CE, the OS had a Windows 
look and feel.
Computer manufacturers started building small laptops, similar in form 
to today’s netbooks, which ran Windows CE. Unfortunately, the operating 
system never caught on with consumers, who complained it was buggy and 
didn’t run “real” Windows programs that ran on a PC. Coupled with that, the 
Windows CE mini-laptops were priced between $700 and $1,000 — viewed as 
too costly for the limited features they provided. (Microsoft finally got the 
bugs out with the rebranded Pocket PC operating system, but by then the 
mini-laptop market was viewed as a lost cause.)

27
 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
However, the little laptop idea just wouldn’t die. Companies like Toshiba still 
pressed forward. In the late 1990s, its Libretto line (refer to Figure 2-2) used 
the standard version of Windows — which meant you could run any Windows 
program on it. Aside from being about twice as thick as contemporary net-
books and lacking built-in networking capabilities, it matched the form factor 
of today’s mini-laptops.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, a British company called Psion 
(see the “Netbook name calling” sidebar) was making a nifty organizer simi-
lar to the HP 100LX. It evolved into a product called the Psion 5, which had 
a speedy processor and ran a custom graphical user interface operating 
system called EPOC. The subsequent Psion 7, which was marketed as the 
netBook, was pretty close to today’s netbooks, featuring a 7-inch color touch 
screen and network connectivity. Unfortunately, by the early 2000s, Psion 
stopped producing its mini-computers, instead opting to focus on developing 
and licensing operating systems for cellular phones.
Netbook name calling
You may have thought the term netbook is a 
generic way of describing a small laptop. But 
guess what, the term netbook is trademarked. 
And a nasty little legal fight broke out because 
of it.
Computer manufacturer Psion applied for the 
trademark in Europe and the U.S. in 1996 — 
it was registered by the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office in 2000. Psion used the trade-
mark on two of its products, the netBook and 
NetBook Pro, which were discontinued long 
before ASUS debuted its Eee PC. (The Eee PC 
is generally considered the first netbook.)
In March 2008, Intel started using netbook to 
describe “small laptops that are designed for 
wireless communication and access to the 
Internet.” Intel’s legal-beagles felt they were 
on solid ground because they weren’t offering a 
branded line of computers under the name. (The 
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had already 
rejected some product names, such as MSI’s 
proposed “Wind Netbook” citing a “likelihood 
of confusion” with Psion’s trademark.)
In December 2008, Psion began sending cease-
and-desist notices to OEMs (Original Equipment 
Manufacturers) and Web netbook news sites 
telling them to stop using the term netbook. 
Most people blew the letters off until February 
2009, when Google declared it was banning the 
use of netbook from AdSense advertisements. 
This got people riled up. An organization called 
Save the Netbooks was formed and stated it 
was going to sue Psion. Dell beat them to the 
punch and sued to legally quash the trademark. 
Intel joined in and accused Psion of fraud and 
demanded the trademark’s immediate dismissal. 
Psion fired the next shot, counter-suing Intel for 
$1.2 billion. Sheesh. Can’t we all just get along?
Time will tell how this will all play out, but even if 
Psion does have legal ownership of the term, the 
genie is out of the bottle, and the company will 
be hard pressed to stop a whole lot of people 
from generically referring to mini-laptops as 
netbooks. As I write this, rumors are swirling 
that Psion has relinquished claim to the netbook 
name. Hopefully this little tempest in a teapot is 
over and everyone can get back to business.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Microsoft decided to give the mini-laptop market one last shot, and in 2006, 
it began marketing a concept called Origami, which later became known as 
UMPC (Ultra Mobile PC). Manufacturers that released the small tablet com-
puters, which ran a custom version of Windows, never really found much 
commercial success.
So what happened? Why didn’t these prehistoric netbooks ever gain the 
crazy success that netbooks have enjoyed over the past few years? There are 
a number of reasons why, including
 
✓ Price: These netbook ancestors weren’t cheap. And most consum-
ers didn’t see enough bang for the buck to buy them. In many cases, 
cheaper components and more efficient Asian manufacturing processes 
that are present today weren’t available.
 
✓ Performance: Oh dear, performance of these computers compared to 
the full-size laptops and PCs of the time was pretty dismal. Today’s net-
books still aren’t as fast as a low-end dual core PC, but performance is 
more than adequate for browsing the Web, watching videos, and using 
productivity software.
 
✓ Wireless Internet availability: Today, many coffee shops, airports, 
libraries, restaurants, airplanes, ferry boats, truck stops, marinas, parks, 
and so on have free (or paid) Wi-Fi. Wireless Internet availability, and 
consumer dependence on e-mail and Web sites, were virtually nonexis-
tent when these prototype netbooks emerged from the primordial muck.
First-generation netbooks
First-generation netbooks can be traced back to the fall of 2007, when ASUS 
released the Eee PC, which is generally hailed as the first true netbook. The 
stars and planets were in perfect alignment for a smash hit. Wireless Net 
availability had taken off, and people wanted an inexpensive, portable (yet 
usable) computer they could tote around that was somewhere between the 
size of a cellular phone/PDA and a full-size laptop.
The surprise popularity of the Eee PC brought a succession of competitors 
(and follow-up models from ASUS), all sharing the same basic features. First 
generation netbooks can be identified by:
 
✓ Internet connectivity: Models featured a built-in wireless card and an 
Ethernet port.
 
✓ Solid state drive (SSD): To keep the weight down and provide super-fast 
startup times, first generation netbooks featured SSDs. Instead of relying 
on a spinning platter like conventional hard drives, SSDs use memory 
chips. The downside to SSDs is they are considerably more expensive 
than conventional drives, so to keep the cost affordable, small SSDs pro-
viding 4 to 8GB of storage were offered.

29
 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
 
✓ Celeron processor: A low-voltage version of Intel’s Celeron chip was 
used. Running at around 900 MHz, the processor was no speed demon, 
but performance was acceptable for basic computing tasks.
 
✓ 7-inch screen: First-generation netbooks sported fairly small screens, 
which made browsing Web sites a little painful. Resolution was limited to 
a meager 800 x 480.
 
✓ Small keyboard: The first-generation netbooks were about the size of 
this book. To accommodate the small case size, reduced keyboards 
were used — between 80 and 85 percent of normal size. The cramped 
The OLPC XO-1
Although it’s not really a consumer product, I 
consider the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) XO-1 
to be the mini-laptop that started the whole net-
book revolution.
Nicholas Negroponte, who ran the Media Lab at 
MIT among other things, had a wonderful vision 
of producing a laptop priced at $100. It would be 
primarily designed as an educational device for 
children all over the world. This evolved into the 
One Laptop Per Child program, which created 
and produced the XO-1.
The XO has some pretty slick features like a 
screen you can read in direct sunlight, a spill-
proof keyboard, a solid-state design that doesn’t 
generate heat, and a built-in wireless card with 
a pair of antennas you can rotate for the best 
signal reception. (Part of the original design 
spec called for a hand crank for charging the 
laptop’s battery, but unfortunately this never 
made it into production.) The XO also sports 
a very simple user interface called Sugar that 
was built from the ground up for use in educa-
tion. Don’t go looking for windows, folders, and 
other elements of the common desktop meta-
phor — you won’t find them.
The whole concept got other manufacturers 
thinking about producing competitive small, 
cheap laptops for the educational market. Out 
of that, ASUS released the Eee PC. (The XO-1 
never quite lived up to its $100-laptop reputation, 
instead costing a bit under $200. And there’s a 
recent move to use Windows XP instead of the 
Linux-based Sugar for its operating system.)
Negroponte’s original market for the XO-1 was 
education ministries of developing countries, 
who would order thousands of units at a time. 
There was a limited Give One Get One program, 
where individuals could buy two laptops for 
$399, keeping one and having the other donated 
to a child in a developing country.
This means XO-1s show up for sale on eBay, 
Craigslist, and other places from time to time. 
However, unless you want one for your child 
or are a geek who likes to play with technol-
ogy, I wouldn’t recommend purchasing one. 
In my opinion, the speed and performance are 
considerably lacking compared to first-gener-
ation netbooks like the Eee PC 701 (although 
a faster chip in the upcoming XO-1.5 version 
may address this), and the keys lack the tac-
tile touch and feel of a normal keyboard. Also, 
even though it’s improved greatly from the initial 
release, the custom Linux operating system isn’t 
rock solid reliable. (It’s possible to load other 
operating systems on the XO-1, though.)
Despite the shortcomings, I’m still hanging 
onto my XO-1 just in case I need a rugged little 
laptop I can use outdoors — one that sips small 
amounts of electricity and can be powered by 
a small solar panel. If you’re interested in the 
OLPC and the XO computers, check out www.
olpcnews.com.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
keyboards were functional, especially after some practice, but certainly 
not as usable as a full-size keyboard.
 
✓ No-frills hardware: Early netbooks sported a touchpad, several USB 
ports, a VGA output for connecting an external monitor or projector, 
audio input and output jacks, built-in speakers and microphone, an SD 
memory card reader, and all but the most basic models came with a 
webcam.
 
✓ Not-so-great battery life: You may think a small laptop would have a 
great battery life. However, the catch is that with a small case, you have 
to use a smaller battery — which means less power storage capacity. 
Depending on how you used them, first-generation netbooks provided 
around 2.5 hours or less of battery life.
 
✓ Linux operating system: As another cost-saving measure, versions 
of the free, open-source Linux operating system were used instead of 
Windows. (Microsoft charges a licensing fee for each copy of Windows a 
manufacturer distributes on a computer.) Customized, easy-to-use user 
interfaces were deployed to conceal some of the complexities of Linux. 
(If you owned a licensed copy of Windows, it was possible to replace 
Linux with Windows on your own, but the process was both time con-
suming and a bit technical.) 
Second-generation netbooks
The first-generation netbooks caught on like wildfire, and based on customer 
feedback, a second generation of products appeared by mid-2008. These 
mini-laptops still shared many of the same characteristics of their predeces-
sors but included some important changes:
 
✓ Intel Atom processor: When the first-generation netbooks arrived, Intel 
was just finishing work on a new low-voltage processor specifically 
designed for mobile devices. Codenamed Atom, the chip was perfect for 
netbooks. In fact, when the chip started shipping in 2008, there was such 
a large demand Intel couldn’t fill all the orders, and many manufactur-
ers were forced to continue using the older and cheaper Celeron chip in 
their netbooks.
 
 From a performance standpoint, the first Atom chips offered no measur-
able improvements compared with the older Celeron chips. The Atom 
wasn’t faster, but it consumed much less power, thus increasing battery 
life. Subsequent Atom processors feature better performance.
 
✓ Conventional hard drives: Although users liked the speed and fast 
startup of solid state drives, they didn’t appreciate the measly amount of 
storage space — when a single movie takes up just under 1GB of storage, 

31
 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
an 8GB drive just doesn’t cut it. Although you could boost storage space 
by using inexpensive SD memory cards and USB flash drives, manufac-
turers decided to start offering cheaper, conventional hard drives along-
side the SSD models. Hard drives of 100GB and up made much more 
sense for adequate storage.
 
✓ Larger screens: The 7-inch screens didn’t offer enough screen real 
estate for most people, and manufacturers soon began to shoehorn 
9-inch screens into roughly the same size case as the smaller-screen 
models. Some 10-inch-screen models were also offered, and even though 
they had larger cases, they were much smaller than full-size laptops.
 
✓ Larger keyboards: Many people had difficulty using the small keyboards 
found in first-generation netbooks. Eager to please, manufacturers started 
to introduce models with larger keyboards — up to a very usable 90 to 
95 percent of normal key size. A 10-inch-screen netbook has a larger 
keyboard than smaller models thanks to the larger case needed for the 
screen.
 
 Keyboard layout, key size, and key feel vary from manufacturer to 
manufacturer — and sometimes even between models.
 
✓ Windows XP: Although Linux netbooks work great, most people use 
Windows and are more familiar with it. Because of this, consumers 
sent a strong message to netbook manufacturers that they wanted the 
Microsoft operating system. The companies obliged and started offering 
models with Windows XP installed. (In fact, Windows netbooks currently 
outsell Linux netbooks by about 9 to 1.) Check out Chapter 4, where I go 
into more detail about all of the different netbook operating systems.
 
✓ More memory: First-generation laptops had 512K of RAM. That was fine 
for a lean version of Linux, and although Windows XP can get by with 
that meager measure of memory, it ran better with a little more oomph. 
That led manufacturers to start boosting the RAM on most models to at 
least 1GB.
 
 Microsoft nixed netbooks from having as much memory as conventional 
laptops. The Redmond giant stipulated that manufacturers who licensed 
Windows XP could use it only on netbooks with 2GB or less of RAM.
 
✓ Better battery life: The Atom processor combined with larger batteries 
boosted netbook battery life by an hour and upwards. Users could look 
forward to 4.5 to 5 hours (or even more) of battery life, depending on use.
 
 Battery life depends on how you’re using your netbook. Far less power 
is required working on a word processor document compared to surfing 
the Net with wireless on and watching a movie at the same time.
 
✓ More hardware: Manufacturers started offering models with new hard-
ware options including Bluetooth.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Third-generation netbooks
For only being on the market a few years, netbooks have undergone a fairly 
rapid evolution. The third generation of netbooks is just about ready to 
emerge from its cocoon — or likely already will have by the time you read 
this. Some of the newer-is-better features you’ll find include
 
✓ Touch screens: Since the first-generation netbooks, hardware hack-
ers have been retrofitting touch screens into their mini-laptops. 
Manufacturers have now clued into this as a good idea, and touch 
screen models are available. Some designs have a rotating screen that 
turns the netbook into a tablet computer.
Nostradamus on netbooks
Instead of doing the popular pundit party pleaser 
of proffering predictions (for the future of netbooks 
that is), I decided to channel the legendary seer 
Nostradamus to get his take on what lies ahead — 
that way, if he blows it, hey, you can’t blame me.
Here’s what old Nostradamus had to say about 
the future of netbooks (sorry, he didn’t have 
time for French quatrains):
 ✓ Lower prices: The $100 laptop may actu-
ally be realized in the near future. Cheaper 
processors and decreased manufacturing 
costs will continue to lower netbook prices, 
with basic models falling below the $200 
and eventually $150 price points.
 ✓ Longer battery life: Technology advances in 
fuel cells and batteries will power your netbook 
all day without a charge. Nine-cell batteries 
are already coming on the market that offer 
eight hours plus of unplugged computing — 
just remember that bigger batteries weigh 
more and mean bigger or thicker cases.
 ✓ New chips: Although they won’t run 
Windows, expect netbooks powered by 
ARM chips to appear — especially on 
inexpensive, basic models. ARM proces-
sors consume a tiny amount of power and 
likely will run some type of Linux operating 
system, such as Google Chrome OS. 
 ✓ Thin is in: Look for netbooks to go on diets 
and get thinner cases.
 ✓ Better screens: Mary Lou Jepsen was the 
brains behind the high-resolution, easy-to-
read-in-the-sun screen that comes with the 
OLPC XO-1. She started her own company, 
called Pixel Qi (http://pixelqi.com), 
to provide innovative screens to computer 
manufacturers. They should start showing 
up in netbooks soon.
 ✓ Ruggedized cases: Look for drop-proof, 
water-resistant netbooks to hit the streets — 
and not get broken in the process.
 ✓ GPS: Global Positioning System chips are 
getting smaller and cheaper, and it’s just a 
matter of time before they become standard 
inside netbooks.
 ✓ TV tuners: You can watch movies on your 
netbook, so why not watch digital TV with a 
tuner card that comes standard?
 ✓ Instant-on: Instant-on startup code like 
Splashtop (www.splashtop.com) will 
find its way onto netbooks. An instant-on 
computer allows you to access Internet 
applications like a Web browser, e-mail, 
and Skype without waiting for the primary 
operating system to boot.

33
 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
 
✓ Windows 7: The popularity of netbooks took Microsoft by surprise, 
and the company would like to see something other than the dated 
Windows XP running on small laptops — and I’m talking about a 
Microsoft brand product, not Linux or any other operating system. 
Microsoft has been getting a lot of press on its upcoming Windows 7 
operating system, including how it will run better on netbooks than 
the venerable XP.
 
✓ Increased connectivity: In addition to Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections, 
manufacturers are offering netbooks with 3G (Third Generation) tele-
communications hardware that allows you to have mobile broadband 
access through a cellular phone network.
 
✓ Increased performance: Faster versions of the Intel Atom chip are 
becoming available, and netbooks are appearing with other processors. 
In addition, some netbooks now come with high-performance graphics 
cards that support graphics-intensive games and other programs.
Nuts About the Net
As I mention in Chapter 1, the net in netbook doesn’t apply to a hair net, a 
fishing net, or Annette Funicello. Instead, it refers to the Internet. A netbook 
is defined by its affordable, small form factor coupled with widely available 
wireless Net access. Because the little laptop is so easy to tote around, just 
about anywhere you find a wireless connection you can
 
✓ Check and send e-mail.
 
✓ Browse the Web.
 
✓ Watch streaming videos.
 
✓ Use instant messaging, Twitter, and Skype.
 
✓ Stay in touch through social networking sites such as Facebook and 
MySpace.
All netbooks offer two ways of jacking into the Internet (or a Local Area 
Network):
 
✓ Wireless: Netbooks have a built-in, wireless 802.11 card (typically 802.11 
b/g) for quick and easy connections to Wi-Fi access points.
 
✓ Wired: If a faster, wired Net connection is available, just plug a cable 
into your netbook’s Ethernet port.
With Windows netbooks, accessing the Net is no different than making a con-
nection with a Windows laptop or desktop PC.

34
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
Although not as popular in the United States as other places in the world (at 
least as of yet), 3G, as in Third Generation, cellular phone services provide 
high-speed Internet access for mobile devices. Newer netbook models have 
built-in 3G modem cards. With a cellular data plan, they allow you to access 
the Net from just about anywhere you can use a cell phone.
Netbooks versus Laptops: Bigger Isn’t 
Necessarily Better
A common criticism leveled against netbooks is that they’re too similar to 
a full-size laptop. That is, for just a bit more money why wouldn’t you buy a 
cheap, full-size laptop instead?
Yes, it’s true that over the past few years traditional laptop prices have plum-
meted. You can easily find a decent, low-end laptop loaded up with an inter-
nal DVD drive, memory card reader, wireless card, 15-inch screen, Bluetooth, 
a fistful of USB ports, a fast processor, a couple GB of RAM, and a big hard 
drive for $500 or less.
However . . .
Head in the clouds
You can’t talk about netbooks without mention-
ing cloud computing. Here’s a brief description 
of what this buzzword means in case you ever 
hear it in a conversation.
Think of the Internet as one big cloud. Lots of 
complex things are going on inside the cloud, 
but the puffy, white billows prevent you from 
seeing the inner workings — that would be 
Web services and software, from companies 
such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Zoho, and 
Yahoo! (to name a few).
You don’t need to know what’s happening inside 
the cloud to benefit from it. An example of cloud 
computing is Google Docs, where you access 
documents with a Web browser while the actual 
applications and data are being stored on a 
server. (I discuss Google Docs in Chapter 7.)
Netbooks make cloud computing more viable, 
because they are easy to pack around and can 
access the Internet from any wireless hotspot.
That’s what cloud computing is in a nut-
shell. If you want to learn more details, check 
out this great YouTube video with various 
industry “names” explaining cloud computing 
in their own words: www.youtube.com/
watch?v=6PNuQHUiV3Q.

 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
Looking at full-size laptop downsides
First, take a look at some of the downsides to a standard laptop compared to 
a netbook.
 
✓ Cost: If you’re on a tight budget, a laptop, even a cheap one, is going to 
cost you more than a netbook. (However, some manufacturers are pro-
ducing models they call netbooks, which are actually more like a laptop 
in terms of price and size.)
 
 In Chapter 3, I give you tips on how to get the best buy when purchasing 
a netbook.
 
✓ Weight: A good guideline is the heavier a laptop, the less it will get car-
ried outside the home or office — unless it’s a work-issued model that 
you’re forced to lug around. Yes, you can get ultra-light laptops like the 
MacBook Air or Dell Adamo, but they still have a large, albeit thin, case 
compared to a netbook. And for the price, you could pick up about a half 
a dozen basic netbooks.
 
✓ Size: Laptops have larger cases than netbooks. Take a gander at 
Figure 2-3, which shows a 10.1-inch-screen netbook next to a standard 
15.4-inch-screen Dell laptop. (And just so I don’t offend any Mac users 
out there, Figure 2-4 shows a 13.3-inch-screen MacBook with the same 
netbook.) Netbook or laptop? You tell me which is going to be easier to 
carry around.

✓ Hardware: Be honest with me: When was the last time you actually used 
the built-in DVD player in your laptop? Or that dialup modem? For most 
users, a full-size laptop has a fair number of hardware components that 
are seldom if ever used. These components make the laptop heavier and 
add to its cost.
Missing in action: Features you 
don’t find on a netbook
The truth is, when comparing netbooks to laptops, some of the features you 
normally expect to find on a laptop are going to be missing in action on a net-
book. Just so you know, that includes
 
✓ Larger screen
 
✓ Larger hard drive
 
✓ Full-size keyboard
 
✓ Faster processor
 
✓ Performance graphics card
 
✓ DVD/CD-ROM player/burner
 
✓ PC Card slots
 
✓ Serial port
 
✓ Dialup modem
 
✓ FireWire

37
 Chapter 2: Introducing Netbooks
Life is all about compromises. Millions of netbook users are willing to trade 
off these standard laptops features for the portability and convenience of a 
netbook.
Deciding between horsepower 
or more miles per gallon
When I grew up, 1960s and 70s muscle cars were the big thing. A monster 
engine with lots of horsepower and a blistering fast quarter mile speed was 
all that counted. Ah, misspent youth.
Now that I’m older, wiser, and greener, a more practical and functional car 
that gets good gas mileage, is reliable, and is easy to maintain is much more 
important to me (although I still like old-school sports cars).
You can apply the same analogy to laptops and netbooks. Do you really need 
the 160 mph top speed and tire-melting torque of a zoomy laptop running the 
fastest possible processor? Or does it make more sense to have a zippy and 
nimble little netbook that didn’t cost you an arm and a leg for going into town 
and taking on long trips?
I’ve been using netbooks since they first came out, and in all honesty, for 
everyday tasks such as e-mail, Web browsing, word processing, and so on, 
low-horsepower chips such as Celerons and Atoms actually work quite well.
Don’t let what appears to be a slow processor speed fool you. You don’t 
need a high-horsepower, fast processor for the kind of things you’ll likely be 
using your netbook for. Instead of muscle car, think a peppy and fun little 
economy car.
A Laptop and a Netbook?
Heck, I say if you can afford it, you should have a laptop and a netbook — or 
a desktop PC and a netbook. Use a standard laptop (or desktop) for doing 
serious work and running computationally intensive programs. Use a net-
book as an ultra-portable travel companion for doing small bits of work and 
accessing the Internet while away from home (or even at home in unconven-
tional places such as the kitchen, garage, or patio).
Intel recently launched a marketing campaign (www.intel.com/consumer/
learn/netbook.htm) around the theme of “laptops are for creating” (as 
are desktop PCs) while “netbooks are for viewing and sharing.” Although 
the company obviously stands to benefit from increased sales of any device 

38
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
that uses its chips, conceptually, the marketing team isn’t wrong. There are 
some things (creating and editing photos, encoding music, playing graphics 
intensive games, and using desktop publishing and graphics software) that 
a traditional laptop is going to be much better at compared with a netbook. 
Save these heavy-lifting tasks for a full-size laptop or desktop PC and avoid 
the frustration of trying to get your poor little netbook to perform them.

Chapter 3
Selecting a Netbook
In This Chapter
▶ Meeting the manufacturers
▶ Choosing a chip
▶ Speaking of storage
▶ Sizing up screens
▶ Focusing on features
▶ Reviewing selection suggestions
▶ Getting purchasing pointers
You’ve decided you want a netbook. I really can’t blame you; they’re ver-
satile, fun, and useful little computers. But now comes the hard part: 
sorting through a sea of models with all sorts of different (and similar) fea-
tures. Who would have thought buying such a small, simple computer could 
be a large, complicated task?
It’s certainly possible to buy a netbook based on looks or an online review 
or two, but most people like to do a little more research before purchasing a 
computer. In this chapter, I take some of the mystery out of selecting a net-
book. I tell you about various netbook features and hardware components 
and provide guidance on which netbooks are best suited for your needs. With 
that information in hand, I tell you where and how to purchase a netbook.
Time’s a-wasting, and you’d better get started. The quicker you get through 
this chapter, the sooner you’ll have a netbook of your own.
Meet the Manufacturers
When netbooks first hit the marketplace, only a handful of computer manu-
facturers were offering the little laptops. Now it seems everyone and his 
brother is making a version of a netbook.

40
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
When selecting a netbook, it’s best to start by seeing what’s available on the 
market and who makes what. As a handy reference, here’s a list of the major 
companies currently offering netbooks along with the addresses for their 
Web sites:
 
✓ Acer, www.acer.com
 
✓ ASUS, www.asus.com
 
✓ Dell, www.dell.com
 
✓ Everex, www.everexstore.com/everex
 
✓ Fujitsu, www.fujitsu.com/global/services/computing
 
✓ HP, www.hp.com
 
✓ LG, www.lg.com
 
✓ Lenovo, www.lenovo.com
 
✓ MSI, www.msi.com
 
✓ Samsung, www.samsung.com
 
✓ Sony, www.sony.com
 
✓ Toshiba, www.toshiba.com
ASUS model madness
For when you start shopping for netbooks, I 
need to give you a little heads-up about ASUS — 
the firm that got the ball rolling with netbooks. If 
you look at the company’s little laptop offerings, 
there are enough models to make your head spin. 
When I was writing ASUS Eee PCs For Dummies 
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.), it seemed like a week 
didn’t go by that ASUS wasn’t announcing 
a new netbook with a different model number. 
It was crazy trying to keep up with them all, and 
netbook pundits were constantly chiding the 
manufacturer about having too many models to 
choose from and confusing the buying public. 
The company’s release pace has slowed down, 
but their model numbers can be cryptic.
At first it looks simple. For example, a 701 model 
has a 7-inch screen, a 900 model has a 9-inch 
screen, and so on. Then it starts to get confus-
ing. Here’s why: Another netbook manufacturer 
may have a model ABC and offer it in several 
different configurations; perhaps with Windows 
or Linux, solid state drive or hard drive, and so 
on. ASUS, on the other hand, tends to use a 
unique model number for each configuration. 
So instead of having just a model ABC avail-
able with different options, you’d probably find 
an ABC-W, ABC-L, ABC-HD, and so on. Heck, 
the company might even release a CBA model, 
making you think it’s something entirely differ-
ent than an ABC, when in reality it isn’t.
My point is, when you’re looking at ASUS net-
books, don’t get all hung up on all the model 
names and numbers — this holds true for any 
manufacturer. In fact, forget them. Look at the 
features and figure out what you want. I guar-
antee if you try to make sense of the extensive 
and frequently confusing model numbers, you’ll 
probably go a little crazy in the process.

41
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
This isn’t a complete list of all netbook manufacturers — there are more. I 
don’t include some companies because they currently have limited distri-
bution channels. Some great netbooks are made in Taiwan and Korea by 
lesser-known manufacturers that aren’t as readily available to international 
consumers outside of Asia.
 
To stay up-to-date with the latest netbook manufacturers and models (includ-
ing many lesser-known brands), one of my favorite places to visit is the 
Liliputing.com product database. Point your Web browser to http://
products.liliputing.com. 
 
The netbook market is in its infancy. Expect more companies to start selling 
their own versions of little laptops in the near future. As I write this, Nokia is 
working on a netbook, and there are persistent rumors Apple will release a 
netbook soon.
Picking a Price Point
When selecting the perfect netbook, start with your wallet (or purse). How much 
money do you want to spend? Currently, netbooks are priced between $250 and 
$600. (I expect the price of new entry point models to drop to around $200 and 
lower in the near future.) The sweet spot is presently in the $350 to $400 range.
 
If you shop around, it’s possible to find refurbished and discontinued net-
books for $200 or less. These models may not have all the whistles and bells of 
newer netbooks but are easier on the budget and definitely usable.
As with any consumer electronics product, the higher the price, the more 
features (otherwise known as whistles and bells) you can expect. The 
guideline is . . .
 
✓ The larger the screen
 
✓ The faster the chip
 
✓ The better the graphics chipset
 
✓ The more memory
 
✓ The bigger the drive
 
✓ The more features (Bluetooth, 3G modem for broadband Internet con-
nection through a cellular phone service provider, and so on)
. . . the higher the price.
 
A higher price netbook doesn’t necessarily mean better. Basic, no-frills models 
are perfectly acceptable for many tasks. In my opinion, part of what defines a 
netbook is its affordable price.

42
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Choosing Chips
When you look at netbook specifications, you’ll notice several types of CPU 
(central processing unit) chips are used to power different models. The fol-
lowing sections describe what you need to know about these chips.
 
The general rule is the faster a processor’s clock speed (that’s the MHz or GHz 
number associated with a CPU), the more performance it will offer.
Intel Celeron-M
The first generation of netbooks, and even some current models, sport Intel 
Celeron-M (M as in mobile) processors. The Celeron is in the x86 family of 
processors and is based on the Pentium chip. Manufacturers use this chip in 
value and bargain laptops. It offers adequate performance but is getting a bit 
long in tooth and is being replaced by more efficient chips such as the Intel 
Atom, described next.
Intel Atom
Because of the growing popularity of mobile devices, Intel decided to develop 
a new low-voltage chip. Dubbed Atom (see Figure 3-1), the chip debuted in 
2008 and was quickly adopted by netbook manufacturers. Netbooks powered 
by Atom processors have longer battery lives compared with similar config-
ured models that use Celeron chips. At present, the Atom processor domi-
nates the netbook market.
All in common
When you purchase a netbook, no matter which 
brand or model, a number of features seem to 
universally come standard — of course, always 
get the model specs just to be sure. Common 
features include
 ✓ 10/100 Ethernet port
 ✓ 802.11 b/g wireless card (some models sup-
port 802.11 n)
 ✓ Audio-in jack (microphone)
 ✓ Audio-out jack (headphones or speakers)
 ✓ Built-in speakers (many models feature a 
built-in microphone)
 ✓ SD card reader
 ✓ Touchpad
 ✓ USB ports (2 or 3)
 ✓ VGA out (for external monitor or projector)

Graphics chipsets
When netbooks were first introduced, they used 
fairly rudimentary graphics chipsets. There is 
currently a move by netbook manufacturers to 
start including higher-end graphics chips that 
will support 3-D graphics for games and high-
definition (HD) video. Here’s some brief informa-
tion about common graphics chips and chipsets 
found in netbooks:
 ✓ Intel GMA: GMA stands for Graphics Media 
Accelerator, and this is Intel’s line of graph-
ics processing units (GPUs) built into moth-
erboard chipsets. The 500, 900, and 950 
GPUs are commonly used in netbooks.
 ✓ Intel 945 GSE: A graphics chipset (based on 
the GMA 950 architecture) included with 
netbooks that use the N270 Atom proces-
sor. It’s power efficient but lacking in per-
formance when it comes to working with 
graphics intensive programs and data.
 ✓ Intel GN 40: Intel’s latest graphics chipset 
for netbooks that supports high-definition 
(720p) video and 3-D. This chipset is included 
with netbooks powered by N280 Atom pro-
cessors. Initial reports say the chipset 
offers more performance but slightly less 
power efficiency.
 ✓ Nvidia Ion: Graphics giant Nvidia is get-
ting into the netbook game with a chipset 
called Ion. This is an Atom processor paired 
with GeForce 9400M graphic chip. Nvidia is 
promising 5x faster graphics and 10x faster 
video transcoding compared with an Atom-
powered netbook with a 945GSE chipset. 
(Nvidia’s Tegra platform includes a graph-
ics chip paired with an ARM processor.)
If you’re a heavy-duty gamer or want to watch 
Blu-ray videos, get a netbook with a fast graph-
ics chipset. If you just plan on using your net-
book for general computing and accessing the 
Net, you don’t really need a higher-power (and 
more costly) graphics chipset.

44
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
Silverthorne was the original codename for the Atom chip. It was designed for 
ultra-mobile PCs. Diamondville is the version of Atom designed for netbooks. 
There’s also a dual-core Atom on the drawing board, and it’s supposed to offer 
higher performance.
Atom N270 processors run at 1.6 GHz. Intel’s new Atom N280 runs at a slightly 
faster 1.66 GHz. Both processors draw about the same amount of power.
Both of these chips are expected to be phased out by mid-2010 and replaced 
by the next generation Atom N450 — codenamed Pine Trail. This single core 
processor will use less power and run at a faster speed.
 
Atom chips are more expensive than Celeron chips. That’s why Celeron model 
netbooks had a lower price than their Atom cousins. As Intel expands its Atom 
line of chips, look for netbooks using lower-speed Atoms to be cheaper than 
models with faster processors.
VIA
VIA Technologies is a Taiwanese manufacturer of computer components. The 
company produces a processor called the C7-M, which is used in a handful 
of netbooks. The C7-M is more or less equivalent to the Celeron in terms of 
processing power. VIA recently released a new processor called Nano, which 
is designed to compete against the Atom in the notebook market.
AMD
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is Intel’s perennial competitor in the processor 
market. AMD was initially skeptical about the netbook market and decided 
it wasn’t a development priority. The company has since announced that it’s 
working on a chip dubbed Neo that will compete with the Atom. (Whether 
Neo means “new” or is a reference to the movie The Matrix, I don’t know.) 
After AMD releases a suitable netbook processor, expect some manufacturers 
to jump on the bandwagon.
ARM
ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine. This is a 32-bit, Reduced Instruction 
Set Chip (RISC) architecture developed by ARM Limited. If you have a cell 
phone, there’s a very good chance it’s powered by one or more ARM chips. 
ARM chips are also widely used in PDAs (personal digital assistants), MP3 
players, and handheld game machines.

45
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
 
ARM processors aren’t the only alternative chips to perhaps find their way 
into netbooks. Companies like Freescale Semiconductor, Qualcomm (see 
the “Smartbooks” sidebar) and Samsung Electronics all make inexpensive, 
power-saving chips used in cell phones and are eyeing the netbook market.
As I write this, a few ARM-powered netbooks have been announced, and 
some of the larger netbook manufacturers are hinting about future production. 
ARM chips are cheap compared with the Intel Atom. And while they don’t 
offer the performance of an Atom processor, manufacturers are considering 
the chips for use in the next generation of netbooks.
 
The Windows operating system was developed to run on Intel x86 processors. 
ARM chips don’t use the same instruction set as Intel chips, which means 
Windows and Windows programs won’t run on ARM netbooks.
An industry goal is to eventually create a $100-or-less netbook. ARM chips 
would likely power such an inexpensive netbook, running a custom operat-
ing system based on Linux. Such a device would have enough horsepower 
for basic Net activities such as e-mail, Web browsing, instant messaging, and 
watching streamed videos.
Smartbooks
What do you get when you cross a netbook 
with a smartphone? According to chipmaker 
Qualcomm, you get a smartbook. In May 2009, 
the company started promoting the idea of 
a device that looks like a typical netbook but 
uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipset, which is 
based on an ARM-based processor that comes 
with 3G mobile broadband, Bluetooth, GPS, and 
Wi-Fi. In addition to the connectivity features, 
a smartbook also has enhanced graphics 
capabilities that allow you to play 3-D games 
and watch HD video.
The catch is a smartbook won’t run Windows 
or any familiar Windows programs. The little 
laptop will need to run some variety of Linux 
or perhaps an updated variation of a Microsoft 
PDA operating system.
Qualcomm has been showing off prototypes of 
various devices using its chipsets for awhile 
now, but Atom netbooks still rule the market. 
The success of any ARM-processor little 
laptop is going to depend on aggressive (mean-
ing cheap) pricing coupled with an outstanding 
user interface and operating system — Google 
Android and Chrome as well as Moblin show 
promise. At this point, I’m not ready to make any 
bets on the smartbook concept taking off.

46
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Mesmerized by Memory
Like any computer, netbooks have internal random access memory (RAM). 
Over the years, as memory prices have declined and programs and operating 
systems have gotten more bloated (er, I mean have greater memory 
requirements to support new and exciting features, yeah, that’s it), traditional 
laptops and desktop PCs have come with more and more RAM. It’s not 
uncommon to see low-end PCs stuffed with 3–4GB of RAM.
When you start looking at netbooks, you may be shocked that some 
models come with only 512K of RAM. “How can that be?” you say. “Won’t the 
computer run as slow as frozen molasses in the middle of December?”
Actually, no. Both Windows XP and Linux can easily run on 512K RAM and 
still have acceptable performance — as long as you don’t have a lot of 
programs or files open at once or try to run memory-intensive programs.
That said, 1GB of RAM will give you snappier performance, and you don’t 
need to worry so much about curbing your multitasking.
Manufacturers may offer 512K of RAM in a basic netbook with 1 to 2GB in 
higher priced models — 1GB seems to currently be the standard.
 
The maximum for any netbook running Windows is 2GB. This has nothing to 
do with technology but everything to do with Microsoft’s licensing agreement, 
which stipulates manufacturers cannot sell netbooks with more than 2GB of 
memory that run Windows XP.
Opt for at least a 1GB netbook, or if you’re stuck with less, make sure it’s 
possible to upgrade the RAM at some future time. (I discuss adding more 
RAM in Chapter 18.)
 
A few manufacturers are offering Microsoft Vista on their netbooks. If you’re 
thinking about running Vista, you need at least 2GB of RAM. I talk more about 
Vista in Chapter 4.
Stumped by Storage
Why should you be stumped by storage? That shouldn’t be a hard decision. 
You just get a netbook that has a big enough hard drive to hold all of your 
stuff. Well, it’s actually a little more complicated than that because many 
netbooks offer two options for storage, solid state drives and traditional hard 
disk drives. Here’s the lowdown on both.

 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
Solid state drives (SSDs)
Instead of relying on spinning platters (found in standard laptop and desktop 
PC hard drives), some netbook models feature a solid state drive (SSD) — 
one is shown in Figure 3-2. An SSD uses a memory chip to store data and 
doesn’t have any moving mechanical parts — this makes them lighter and 
less prone to failure. They start up and power down very quickly, are quiet, 
and have fast read and write times.

SSDs have two downsides: 
 
✓ Cost: Because they’re a rather new storage technology, they’re quite 
expensive. At the present, the retail price of a 256GB SSD is around $500. 
Compare that with a conventional hard drive you can get for about $50. 
 
✓ Capacity: Due to the cost, netbook manufacturers use low-capacity 
SSDs — storage capacity is usually under 20GB. On very small SSDs, 
Linux is typically installed.
SSDs are the wave of the future for laptops. Prices are starting to fall, but it 
will be several years at the least before SSDs are comparably priced to 
traditional hard drives that have large amounts of storage space.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Hard disk drives (HDDs)
Over the years, hard disk drives have become the storage medium of choice 
for laptops and desktop PCs. They work by reading and writing data on 
rapidly spinning platters that have magnetic surfaces. A relatively inexpensive 
HDD can store a large amount of data. Compared with a solid state drive, 
hard drives are considerably cheaper, a little heavier, consume a bit more 
power, and because they have moving mechanical parts, aren’t quite as 
robust.
Early netbooks didn’t have HDDs, but customer demand for more storage 
prompted manufacturers to start offering conventional hard drives. HDD-
equipped netbooks are now more popular than SSD models and commonly 
come in 80, 120, and 160GB sizes, with Windows typically installed.
 
It’s also possible to have a hybrid storage system. As I write this, a netbook 
that uses a small SSD for the operating system and a HDD for data and 
installed programs was just announced. This design would be the best of both 
worlds.
Deciding between SSD and HDD
Which would you choose? A netbook with a 16GB solid state drive or one 
with a conventional 160GB hard disk? Oh, I forgot to mention, both retail for 
the same price.
“No way,” you exclaim. “That must be a typo. You’d have to be crazy to limit 
yourself to only 16GB of storage when you could have ten times more for the 
same price.”
This is a dilemma netbook buyers sometimes often face. As I mention earlier, 
because solid state drives are much more expensive than traditional hard 
drives, manufacturers use low-capacity SSDs to keep prices down. Here’s a 
bit of guidance if you’re having trouble making a decision.
Choose a netbook with an SSD drive if you
 
✓ Want the lightest weight configuration possible
 
✓ Like very fast startup times
 
✓ Don’t plan on adding many other programs beyond those that were 
preinstalled
 
✓ Are primarily using the netbook for accessing the Internet

49
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
Choose a netbook with a conventional hard drive if you plan on
 
✓ Installing lots of programs
 
✓ Storing movies and MP3 files on the drive
 
✓ Running programs that use large data files (such as mapping or 
professional graphics applications)
 
Personally, I’d opt for a netbook with a hard drive versus a solid state drive. 
SSDs are cool, but the low capacity due to the price doesn’t make them as 
versatile. When 80 or 120GB SSDs come down in price, I’ll change my tune. 
In the meantime, laptop hard drives are an affordable, reliable, and known 
commodity — and are usually easy to swap or replace.
 
Just because a netbook with a hard drive comes preinstalled with Windows 
doesn’t mean you can’t install Linux on it. And conversely, if you have a Linux 
netbook with an SSD, you can always install Windows on it. I discuss more 
about this in Chapter 4.
Keyboard Conundrums
When you purchase a desktop PC or a conventional laptop, you get a 
standardized keyboard. Although some of the keys might be in different 
places, you at least know they’ll all generally be the same size and shape.
This isn’t the case with netbooks. The size of the keys, how they feel when 
you press them, their shape, and even their layout differ from manufacturer 
to manufacturer — and sometimes even among models. See Figure 3-3 to get 
an idea of how key size can vary.
Because of this, I strongly recommend — if you have a chance — trying out 
several netbooks before you buy. More retail stores are carrying netbooks 
with the undersized keys, and it’s important to select a model you and your 
fingers will be happy with. If you can’t demo a model or two, make sure the 
online retailer has a reasonable return policy just in case you find out your 
fingers and the netbook can’t be friends.
Generally, you’ll find the keys on most 10-inch-screen netbooks quite usable. On 
smaller netbooks, the keyboards can definitely be challenging to get used to.

Baffled by Batteries
When you read netbook specifications, you’ll undoubtedly see information 
about the battery. All netbooks currently use rechargeable lithium ion 
batteries. Pay attention to these two things:
 
✓ mAh: This stands for milliamp hour, a technical term that states how 
much power a battery holds. Batteries with higher mAh values last 
longer without recharging.
 
 As a battery ages, its storage capacity decreases. For example, a new 
2,200 mAh battery may last longer between recharges than an old 4,000 
mAh battery.
 
✓ Cells: A netbook’s plastic battery case contains a series of battery cells. 
The more cells a battery has, the more power it stores, and the longer 
it will last away from a power outlet. Netbook batteries typically have 
three, four, or six cells — extended batteries may even have more.
 
The more cells in a battery, the heavier the battery. Also, you can stuff only 
so many cells into a netbook-sized battery case. Beyond a certain number of 
cells, the manufacturer needs to either extend the battery case (which means 
it won’t fit flush inside the netbook) or expand the netbook’s case so it will fit 
larger batteries.
 
Take a netbook manufacturer’s bragging about battery life with a grain of salt. 
The numbers they sling around are for absolutely best case scenarios — 
wireless off, dimmed screen, limited processor activity, and so on. Under real 
world conditions, always expect to get somewhat less than advertised time.

51
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
Settling on a Screen
Netbooks come with a variety of nice and compact screen sizes. Figure 3-4 
gives you a relative idea of how screens compare size-wise. Generally, the 
larger the screen and the higher the resolution, the more the netbook costs. 
Here’s what to expect in the way of netbook screens.
 
✓ 7-inch: First-generation netbooks featured a dinky 7-inch display. It’s 
kind of a pain to surf Web sites with these size screens because the 
whole page isn’t displayed horizontally — forcing you to scroll quite a 
bit. Additionally, the resolution of the 7-inch screens was a meager 
800 x 480. Netbooks with these screens have mostly gone the way of the 
dinosaur and are available only on the used and discounted markets.
 
✓ 9-inch: Manufacturers quickly wised up that 7-inch screens just didn’t 
cut the mustard. From an engineering standpoint, it’s possible to 
shoehorn a 9-inch-screen into a 7-inch netbook case and make the case 
only slightly larger.
 
 In fact, many 7-inch-screen netbooks had a plastic bezel around the 
screen which, when you tallied up the screen and bezel size, was 
roughly equivalent to a 9-inch-screen model.
 
 Most screens this size have a 1024 x 600 resolution. If you’re looking for 
ultimate portability, go with a 9-inch-screen model. The downside is you 
still may be faced with a small keyboard.
 
 Want to get a feel for what browsing the Web at 1024 x 600 is like? If you 
use the Firefox browser, enter this command in the address bar:
javascript:resizeTo(1024,600);
 
 Be forewarned that many manufacturers seem to be doing away with 
their 9-inch models in favor of the more popular and usable 10-inch-
screen netbooks, which I talk about next.
 
✓ 10-inch and beyond: When you put a 10-inch screen in a netbook, its 
case needs to be enlarged. With the bigger case, you can add a larger 
keyboard and a bigger battery. Netbooks with 10-inch screens are pretty 
much standard these days, although different models have different 
maximum screen resolutions — generally, the higher the resolution, the 
better.
 
Despite what a manufacturer may advertise, I personally don’t consider any 
netbook that has a screen larger than 10 inches (a few tenths of an inch over is 
okay), a true netbook. Models touting 11- and 12-inch screens are really more 
like laptops than netbooks because you’re giving up the compact size, light 
weight, and inexpensive price tag.

8.9 inches–1024×600
7 inches–800×480
 
I’m guilty of rounding screen size numbers just to make it easier to understand. 
Most netbook screens described as 9 inches are actually 8.9 inches. A 10-inch 
screen can be 10, 10.1 or 10.2 inches based on manufacturer specs. But what’s 
a few tenths of an inch between friends?
 
Many netbooks have glossy screens — the surface is reflective. Some 
models have matte screens, which don’t reflect. Research by the Queensland 
University of Technology in Australia suggests high-gloss screens may cause 
back problems because users adopt awkward positions to avoid glare and 
reflections typically not present with matte screens. For more information, see 
www.hrd.qut.edu.au/healthsafety/worksafely/highGloss.jsp.
Operating System Opinions
With some netbook models, you have a choice between Linux and Windows 
operating systems — and in the future, you likely will have even have more 
options. 
Although netbooks running Windows are currently the most popular, that 
doesn’t necessarily mean you have to follow the crowd. There’s a lot to say 
on this subject, so I devote all of Chapter 4 to discussing operating systems. 
Be sure to check it out.

53
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
Case in Point
At a quick glance, most netbooks look fairly similar. However, you can find 
a lot of variation among the cases that house the internal parts and pieces. 
When you’re shopping for a netbook, don’t get so focused on hardware 
specifications that you forget about the case. Here are a few case laws:
 
✓ Check out photos. Just about every netbook that comes on the market 
gets reviewed, and many of the reviews have detailed photos from 
different angles — much more useful than the official product pictures 
on the manufacturer Web sites. Check out the photos! You’ll find that 
some netbooks are definitely more aesthetically pleasing than others — 
just remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
 
✓ Read the dimension specifications. When you’re comparison shopping 
netbooks, pay attention to the case dimension specifications. All netbooks 
are not created equal when it comes to length, width, thickness, and 
weight. These dimensions are important if you’re looking for an ultra-
portable travel companion.
 
✓ Decide on a style and color. Some manufacturers offer cases with 
stylish metal trim and in colors other than basic white or black — there 
are also a few netbooks on the market with metal cases. You might have 
to pay a little extra for a different case color, material, or a snazzy design 
on the case, but if fire engine red is more you, don’t be afraid to go for it.
 
Plastic netbook cases come with either matte or glossy finishes, depending on 
the model. Glossy cases in dark colors are notorious for showing fingerprints — 
in case that bothers you.
You may narrow down your choices to several different netbooks that all 
have the same features and the same general price. In such cases flip a coin 
or make your decision on case aesthetics.
 
If you want to make a personal statement with your netbook, be sure to read 
Chapter 12, where I tell you about laptop skins (decals for adorning your 
netbook).
Ferreting out Other Features
In the previous sections of this chapter, I cover most of the primary features 
you should consider when selecting a netbook. However, there are still a few 
more miscellaneous features that come with different models that I want to 
tell you about.

54
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
3G modems
The term 3G stands for Third Generation. This term refers to cell phone 
companies providing high-speed wireless Internet access from your phone 
through their systems — after you sign up for a data plan, of course.
Mobile phones aren’t the only beneficiaries of 3G networks. Newer netbook 
models are coming equipped with built-in 3G modems — that means you 
don’t need to be near a Wi-Fi hotspot to access the Net. In fact, some cellular 
providers are beginning to offer discounted netbooks with their data plans. 
(See the “Netbooks for nothing” sidebar in this chapter.) 
If your netbook doesn’t have a built-in 3G modem, you can purchase add-on 
products. I discuss these in Chapter 6.
Bluetooth
Some netbooks have built-in hardware for interacting with Bluetooth devices 
such as cell phones, speakers, and GPS receivers. If your netbook didn’t 
include Bluetooth, you can purchase an add-on card. I talk more about 
Bluetooth in Chapter 6.
Touchpads
Like most laptops, netbooks primarily use a touchpad instead of a mouse for 
interfacing with the operating system and programs — you can still use a USB 
mouse at the same time if you like. (If you’re a new laptop or netbook user 
and have never used a touchpad before, be sure to read the section on 
touchpads in Chapter 5.)
Some netbook touchpads support a feature called multitouch. Multitouch lets 
you use two fingers at the same time to navigate the screen. It’s the same 
technology found in Apple’s iPhone, iPod touch, MacBook Air, and MacBook 
Pro products.
Multitouch is pretty cool, state-of-the-art technology. In programs that 
support it, you can zoom out by placing two fingers on the touchpad and 
moving them apart — pinch them together to zoom in. You can also scroll 
windows by placing both fingers together on the touchpad and then together 
dragging them up or down.

55
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
Webcams
A number of netbooks have Web cameras (webcams) built into the case 
above the screen. This is a handy feature if you plan to use your netbook for 
video conferencing (or chatting) or shooting quick photos or videos.
Don’t expect image quality and resolution to be as high as a standalone 
digital still or video camera though. If your netbook is equipped for video, it 
will have a lowly 0.3 or 1.3 megapixel camera built in — compare that with 
digital still cameras that commonly feature 7 to 10 megapixel resolution. 
ExpressCards
No, I’m not referring to that credit card you should never leave home without. 
I’m talking about the ExpressCard hardware standard which replaces PC 
Cards (also known as PCMCIA cards). An ExpressCard is smaller and faster 
than older expansion cards — laptop manufacturers have started adopting 
the standard within the past few years, and it proves to be the wave of the 
future. Currently, only a few netbooks sport ExpressCard slots, but I expect 
this to change as manufacturers try to outdo each other with features in the 
increasingly competitive market.
 
ExpressCards can also be referred to as Peripheral Component Interconnect 
Express, PCIe, or PCI-E cards. ExpressCards are derived from the PCIe standard.
Selection Suggestions
I’m not going to recommend a specific brand or model of netbook — sorry, 
that would take away all the fun of deciding exactly what’s right for you. Once 
you know about the features, and start looking at the specs and prices, I have 
no doubt you’ll quickly come up with a short list of models to choose from.
If you’re stuck, here are a few general recommendations on what type of 
netbook to consider, depending on who will be using it:
 
✓ Children: Go for a basic, no-frills model. They’re relatively inexpensive 
and are fairly immune to minor bumps and drops — especially SSD 
models. A smaller keyboard is perfect for littler hands. Consider models 
designed for the education market.

56
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
✓ Students: Having been a starving student once, look for the most 
features with the best price. Battery life should be a big consideration. 
Bluetooth is a plus if you have a compatible cell phone. The lighter and 
smaller the better — with a usable screen and keyboard, of course.
 
✓ Businesspeople: Go for a model with a larger, more usable-size keyboard 
and screen. Because the business world seems to revolve around 
Windows, select it as your operating system for easy networking 
inter-operability and data synchronization. Again, look for long battery 
life.
 
✓ Home computer users: Netbooks are a great second computer. If you 
have a wireless access point at home, a netbook’s light weight and size 
make it perfect for accessing the Internet anywhere you want — kitchen, 
patio, bedroom, wherever. It’s also convenient to toss in a bag or purse 
when you head to the coffee shop. Find a balance between size and 
usability that works for you.
 
✓ Senior citizens: For seniors, I recommend a netbook with at least a 
10-inch screen — get something you don’t have trouble seeing. A larger 
keyboard is also important. If you’re going to be using the mini-laptop 
mostly around home, don’t worry about battery life, because a power 
outlet will always be nearby.
 
✓ Techies: Take your pick — depending on how much you’ve got to spend. 
Some netbooks lend themselves more to tinkering and customization 
than others, so do a quick Google search for a model you’re interested in 
and for hacking. And check out Chapter 23 for a collection of projects to 
get you started.
Buying Basics
Great! You’ve persevered through this chapter, did all of your homework, and 
now have one or more netbooks on your short list. You’re almost there, and I 
want to close with some final buying advice:
 
✓ Go with a larger netbook manufacturer. Unless you’re technically 
savvy, it makes sense to go with a netbook made by one of the 
manufacturers I mention at the beginning of this chapter. Although a 
lesser-known brand may work great, it’s usually safer to go with a 
well-known name brand. That’s because you’ll likely get better technical 
support from the manufacturer, plus, the more units that are sold, the 
greater the chance an online user community will develop. In many 
cases, I’ve found online forums offer faster and better support than what 
you get from the factory.

57
 Chapter 3: Selecting a Netbook
 
✓ Check out buyer reviews and feedback — online retailer Web sites 
such as Amazon and Newegg are good sources. Get as many opinions 
as you can. A key tenet of statistics is the larger the sample size, the 
more meaningful the data will be. I mention some great Internet 
information resources to check out in Chapter 22.
 
 Consumer Reports did a review of six netbooks in November 2008, 
and although that seems like forever considering the way technology 
changes, it’s worthwhile reading the free review at http://blogs.
consumerreports.org/electronics/2008/11/six-windows-
net.html. Check the site to see whether any updated reviews have 
been written with newer products. Consumer Reports reviewed and 
rated netbooks and other laptops in its June 2009 magazine issue, but as 
I write this it hasn’t appeared online, so visit your friendly local library.
 
✓ Price shop. Prices vary, especially online. Every dollar saved these days 
counts, and you can easily bank an extra 20 bucks on up, depending 
on where you purchase your netbook. Amazon (www.amazon.com), 
Newegg (www.newegg.com), and Buy.com (www.buy.com) all stock 
netbooks, as do many smaller online retailers — Google is your friend in 
finding them.
 
 If you’re on a really low budget but still want a netbook, consider a 
first- or second-generation model. With manufacturers getting rid of 
older, discontinued models, I’ve seen some limited quantity, great 
bargains on various deal Web sites — and don’t forget about eBay. As I 
write this, it’s possible to pick up new first- and second-generation 
netbooks for around $150 or less.
 
✓ Shop local. If you get a chance, find a local retailer who carries 
netbooks and check it out in person. (In the United States, Target, Best 
Buy, Costco and even Toys“R”Us stock some models of netbooks, and a 
number of smaller retailers are beginning to carry different lines.)
 
 Some manufacturers offer discounted prices on refurbished netbooks. 
These are netbooks that have been returned to the manufacturer for one 
reason or another and then are tested and repaired if necessary. Most 
come with full warranties. Check the manufacturer’s Web site (there’s 
a list at the beginning of the chapter) to see whether you can score any 
deals. I’ve also found that sites like Buy.com often carry refurbished 
netbooks.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Netbooks for nothing
“Pssst. How’d you like a netbook for free? I’ve 
got this brand-new little gem right here that 
could be yours.”
You might be getting this pitch soon, and it won’t 
be coming from a shady character lurking in the 
shadows of a darkened alley on the wrong side 
of town.
No, this offer may be coming from your friendly 
neighborhood cellular provider. As I write this, 
some of the large providers are starting to offer 
brand-new netbooks for $50 to $100 when you 
sign up with them for a 3G data plan. If the past 
predicts the future, there’s always a possibility 
they may eventually start giving away netbooks 
for free just like cell phones.
However, don’t be penny wise and pound 
foolish when it comes to cheap netbooks bundled 
with cellular data plans. As an example, one 
retailer (who shall remain nameless) is offering 
a popular netbook for $99 when you sign up for 
a data plan that costs $70 a month. However, if 
you look around, you can get plans that include 
both voice and data for the same price or less. 
Do some window shopping and brush off any 
rusty math skills before being lured in by a 
discounted netbook deal.
Also, beware of suicidal netbooks. Unlike a 
mobile phone, which is pretty useless without a 
service provider, with a netbook, you still have 
a functional computer when you cancel your 
data plan (or don’t pay the bill). LM Ericsson 
AB, the Swedish company that makes many of 
the modems that go into laptops, has a plan to 
prevent this. The company recently announced 
a new modem dubbed a “kill pill” that allows 
a carrier to send a signal to the netbook and 
completely disable it. Ouch!

Netbook Operating Systems

▶ Ogling Google Android and Chrome
▶ Deciding between Windows and Linux
A
ll computers need an operating system (OS) to manage files, run 
programs, print documents, and perform other basic tasks. A netbook 
is no exception.
When you buy a computer, you usually don’t need to worry about the 
operating system. If you buy a PC, you get Windows. If you buy a Mac, you 
get OS X. But as you start looking at different netbooks, you’ll soon find that 
manufacturers offer a number of different operating systems on their little 
laptops. In fact, you may even have a choice between two operating systems 
on the same model.
This chapter is all about netbook operating systems. I tell you about what 
operating systems are available now (and what’s in the pipeline), list key 
differences between different operating systems, and even weigh in on the 
sometimes heated Linux-versus-Windows question.
Working with Windows
When you think about operating systems, Microsoft Windows naturally 
comes to mind. Since the 1990s, Windows has been the dominant operating 
system across all PCs — and it continues its reign among netbooks. Follow 
along as I describe past and present versions of Windows that are used on 
netbooks.

60
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
XPerience counts
Because netbooks first came out at the end of 2007, you would think the little 
laptops would be running the latest, greatest, cutting-edge operating system. 
But guess what? The most popular netbook OS is the venerable Windows XP 
(shown in Figure 4-1), which was first released in October 2001.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Microsoft XP 
running on a 
netbook.
 
Microsoft has tried its best to replace the dated operating system, but hasn’t 
had much success. (Although the company has ended mainstream support 
for XP, it will continue offering free security fixes until 2014.) Microsoft’s 
problem is that plain and simple, XP just works. It’s reliable, predictable, easy 
to use, supports all manner of hardware devices and programs, and is as 
comfortable as an old sweater. According to March statistics from research 
company Hitslink, 63 percent of computers connected to the Internet are 
running XP — compare that to a meager 24 percent for Vista, with the 
remainder split up between Linux and Mac.
Aside from general consumer popularity, XP is well suited for netbooks. Even 
a first generation netbook with 512K of RAM and a 900 MHz processor can 
run XP and most Windows programs reasonably well. More memory and a 
faster processor are even better. Aside from a smaller screen, you can expect 
XP to run on your netbook just like it does on a full-size laptop or desktop 
PC — and that means nearly all the Windows programs work the same.

61
 Chapter 4: Netbook Operating Systems
Viewing Vista
The Microsoft Vista OS hasn’t been the smash success the company expected 
it to be. Since Vista was released in 2007, a lot of PC users expressed their 
content with Windows XP by deciding not to upgrade. And with sales of new 
traditional laptops and desktop PCs (which come preinstalled with Vista) 
down, Microsoft hasn’t made as big of a dent in the user base as it thought it 
would.
Vista requires more memory and computing horsepower than previous 
versions of Windows, and this is where Microsoft made a faulty assumption. 
Up until now, computers have evolved very predictably — new computers 
have faster processors, more memory, and bigger hard drives than previous 
generations. Microsoft assumed this Darwinian process would continue, 
and that computers would naturally and eventually beef up to meet Vista’s 
demands. However the emergence of netbooks in 2007 flipped that assumption 
on its head — no-frills, underpowered computers are selling like hot cakes. 
The Internet has taken priority over the traditional desktop computer.
Because most netbooks have a gigabyte or less of RAM and relatively low-
performance processors, Vista isn’t the best operating system to use. Some 
netbook users have tried installing Vista on their tiny laptops and were 
disappointed at the speed and performance. That’s why the majority of 
Conspiracy nation
The popularity of Linux netbooks took many by 
surprise — including Microsoft. When netbooks 
first came out, they exclusively ran Linux 
operating systems. Manufacturers provided 
instructions for installing Windows XP if 
you happened to have a spare copy, but you 
couldn’t buy an off-the-shelf netbook with the 
Microsoft OS.
Then suddenly, Windows XP models became 
available — for the same price as Linux models. 
This was curious because Linux was free and 
didn’t require any manufacturer licensing 
fees, but Windows did. Some industry analysts 
(and conspiracy theorists) believed Microsoft 
recognized a threat to its hegemony. The rumors 
go that the Redmond giant started offering 
netbook manufacturers some really good 
licensing deals and incentives if they offered 
Windows XP Home edition netbooks. And in a 
very short amount of time, Windows netbooks 
were outselling their Linux cousins by a margin 
of 9 to 1. The Wall Street Journal recently ran 
an article that suggested Microsoft was making 
around $15 from a netbook that comes with 
XP — compare that to around $50 to $60 
each time a computer with Vista is sold. We’ll 
probably never know the real story, but hey, 
that’s business.

netbook manufacturers have stuck with Windows XP as their operating 
system of choice. (A cost factor is also involved because copies of XP have a 
cheaper licensing fee compared with Vista.)
 
Although a few manufacturers do offer Vista Home, with various system 
settings tweaked to accommodate underpowered netbooks, at the present, I’d 
stick with a model that runs Windows XP or Windows 7, which I discuss next.
Seeking 7
Next up at bat from Microsoft’s operating system team is Windows 7. 
(Figure 4-2 shows you an example of the updated desktop and user interface.) 
The new OS is a more advanced and improved version of Windows Vista. 
It runs faster, requires less memory, and has a number of user interface 
enhancements that make it more intuitive and friendly to use — perfect for 
a netbook. In my opinion, Microsoft has learned from the less-than-entirely-
successful Vista and has put much more thought (and user feedback) into 
this operating system.
Voting for Vista
If you’re bound and determined to run Vista on 
your netbook, you’re a hardy soul, and the least 
I can do is give you a few tips to make the instal-
lation easier:
 ✓ Upgrade your system memory to at least 
2GB. A 512K memory is painful, and 1GB is 
usable, but slow.
 ✓ Make sure you have enough storage space. 
Vista is big, and I wouldn’t recommend 
installing it on a low-capacity solid state 
drive.
 ✓ Use vLite (www.vlite.net), a free 
utility that creates a stripped-down version 
of Vista. You need to own a copy of Vista; 
vLite creates the lite version of Vista from 
the installation disc.
 ✓ You need an external DVD player to use the 
installation disc (either a vLite version or the 
original). It may be possible to install Vista 
from an SD memory card or a USB flash 
drive, but the DVD route is the easiest.
 ✓ You need Vista-compatible drivers for 
your netbook hardware. The netbook’s 
manufacturer Web support should have the 
drivers available for download.
 ✓ Search Google for your netbook model and 
Vista (for instance, type “Eee PC Vista” as 
your search term) to get information from 
other users who may have successfully 
installed Vista. Also check some of the 
forums I mention in Chapter 22.
Or, better yet, skip all the preceding steps, sell 
your old netbook, and buy a new one that has 
Vista preinstalled.

system.
 
The OS comes in a variety of editions, with Windows 7 Home Premium 
targeted at home computers, laptops, and netbooks — there are also 
Professional and Ultimate versions for business and enterprise users. A 
Windows 7 Starter Edition is also available on some netbooks. Microsoft has 
traditionally released starter editions in developing countries. This software 
is an inexpensive version of the operating system with some features pared 
down. The goal is to get more Windows users in non-industrialized countries, 
where most people or computer manufacturers couldn’t afford a fully priced 
retail or licensed version. Using a special Starter Edition for netbooks ensures 
a Microsoft operating system ends up on $200-or-less netbooks without 
cutting into the manufacturers’ margins too much.
Don’t expect the Starter Edition to have all of the functionality of the full 
editions. It has a number of limitations including no support for multitouch 
on touchpads, no DVD playback, and limited customization options such as 
not being able to change your desktop wallpaper. If your netbook comes with 
this basic version of the operating system, you can always upgrade to the 
Home version to get more features. 

64
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
If you’re trying to decide whether you should upgrade your Windows XP 
netbook to Windows 7, check out this great article from Maximum PC that 
compares real-world performance between the two operating systems (and 
even contrasts a few Linux distributions): www.maximumpc.com/article/
features/windows_7_vs_linux_whats_best_os_your_netbook.
For more on Windows 7, visit Microsoft’s official Web page at www.micro
soft.com/windows/windows-7.
 
Don’t think the venerable Windows XP will disappear as soon as Windows 7 
hits the shelves. Microsoft announced that netbook manufacturers will be 
able to sell little laptops with XP for one year after Windows 7 is generally 
available.
Loving Linux
When the first netbooks hit the market, they all ran Linux. Some netbook 
manufacturers continue to offer Linux models, and if you don’t know much 
about the operating system, this is the place to find out about it — or at least 
get a good, general overview.
Penguin pointers
If you’re not a Linux aficionado, you’re probably wondering what’s up with 
the title of this section. When you start using Linux, you’ll notice there’s 
an overabundance of references to penguins, especially a cute, cuddly one 
named Tux — the official mascot of Linux as shown in Figure 4-3. Here’s the 
story: In 1996, developers were trying to think up a mascot for Linux. Sharks 
and eagles were considered, but Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux, as in 
LInus uNIX) mentioned he was fond of penguins. So a contest was proposed 
to come up with a suitable-looking bird. Larry Ewing’s design won best of 
show, and because penguins appear to be wearing tuxedos, someone sug-
gested the name Tux. The rest is history.

Okay, with that fowl explanation out of the way, I need to get back on track.
Linux is a free, open-source operating system. Lots of programmers all over 
the world volunteer their time, contributing to its development — some of 
the reasons they do this include altruism, ego, and beefing up their reputations 
and resumes.
Just because something is free doesn’t mean it doesn’t have value. Linux is 
a very mature and solid operating system — easily in the same league as the 
latest offerings from Microsoft and Apple.
Linux, which is based on Unix, started out as a command-line operating 
system. In an effort to modernize Linux with a desktop, windows, and menus, 
two graphical user interface projects were started: KDE (www.kde.org) and 
Gnome (www.gnome.org). Both generally work the same but have a slightly 
different look and feel and associated programs. KDE is Windows-like, and 
Gnome is more Mac-like. Versions of Linux that run on netbooks typically use 
either KDE or Gnome as their user interface. Now let me tell you about those 
different versions of Linux.
Discussing distros
A number of different versions of Linux are available — these are called 
distributions or distros if you want to sound clued in. You may have heard of 
Ubuntu, Fedora (formerly Red Hat), PCLinuxOS, or Slackware; to name a few. 
A company, organization, or group of people creates a distribution based on 
a version of a common Linux kernel. It then includes various packages and 
software. This distribution is then packaged up and released on a disc or 
over the Internet for download. (Head over to www.linux.org to find out 
more about all the different distributions.)
No single Linux distribution has been standardized for netbooks, and you can 
find manufacturers offering different distros with their products. Here’s a list 
of the distributions some of the main netbook players currently offer:

Manufacturers further customize their distros, optimizing them for their own 
netbooks. For example, ASUS uses a Linux distribution called Xandros, cus-
tomizing the user interface and code for the Eee PC (as shown in Figure 4-4).
 
Figure 4-4:

If you don’t like the version of Linux that shipped with your netbook, it’s 
relatively simple to install a different distro that has features you like. Take 
ASUS as an example again: Many techie users don’t like the simplified user 
interface on Linux Eee PCs and end up replacing the Xandros distro with a 
version of Ubuntu (shown in Figure 4-5) or another distribution.

67
 Chapter 4: Netbook Operating Systems

The main differences between Linux distributions are the user interface and 
included programs. Linux is Linux, and no matter which distro you use, the 
operating system functions and the commands you use all remain the same.
Going mobile
Most Linux distros were designed to run on 
PCs — whether they’re desktops or laptops. But 
a few ongoing projects are working on creating 
versions of Linux operating systems specifically 
for netbooks and mobile Internet devices 
(MIDs) — think netbook functionality, but 
smaller with a touch screen and no keyboard.
These projects could make a big impact in the 
netbook world, perhaps moving manufacturers 
to begin supporting a standardized Linux 
operating system — including a common 
user interface designed specifically for small 
screens. Here are some of the projects worth 
keeping an eye on:
 ✓ Moblin: Intel is a big backer of this 
open-source project, and the Moblin 2 
operating system is designed to run on Atom 
processors. Check out www.moblin.
org for more.
 ✓ Ubuntu Netbook Remix: Canonical, 
which develops and distributes the very 
popular Ubuntu Linux, has been working 
on a version of its operating system 
expressly designed for netbooks. See www.
canonical.com/netbooks.
 ✓ Ubuntu MID: This is another Ubuntu project, 
but this one targeted at MIDs. To find 
out more, visit www.ubuntu.com/
products/mobile.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Asking for Apple
As of the summer of 2009, Apple doesn’t include a netbook in its product 
lineup. But that’s not to say the secretive company is not working on a tiny 
laptop, perhaps a cross between an iPod and MacBook. It seems a week 
doesn’t go by without rumors about such a device.
At the end of April 2009, Tim Cook, Apple’s Chief Operating Officer said, 
“When I look at netbooks, I see cracked keyboards, terrible software, junky 
hardware, very small screens. It’s just not a good consumer experience and 
not something we would put the Mac brand on. It’s a segment we would not 
choose to play in.”
I personally wouldn’t take those words at face value. First, Apple often says 
one thing then does something else. Second, from a marketing standpoint, 
it would make sense for Apple to release a netbook product but call it 
something else to differentiate it from other netbooks. We shall see.
If you’re a frustrated Apple fan and can’t wait for a Cupertino netbook, you do 
have an alternative. Be forewarned, though, you’re treading in a legally gray 
area. Here’s the scoop.
It’s technically possible to hack a netbook and install a copy of OS X on it. I’m 
certainly not endorsing the practice, but you heard that right. The hardware 
internals of some netbooks, such as the MSI Wind and Dell Mini, make some 
netbooks more suitable than others for this operation. But it’s generally not 
that difficult to play mad scientist and create a Hackintosh netbook — you 
don’t even need Igor for an assistant.
 
Just remember that even if you own a Mac and the OS X installation DVD that 
came with it, it’s a violation of the licensing agreement to install OS X on a PC. 
And Apple doesn’t have much of a sense of humor when it comes to things it 
deems proprietary.
In February 2009, Apple’s lawyers compelled Wired.com to remove a video 
tutorial on how to load OS X on a netbook. Here’s a URL for the censored Web 
page if you’re interested; the page still contains some unedited instructions 
which gives you an idea about the process: 
http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/gadget-lab-vide.html
Despite the Wired video’s demise, if you’re handy with Google, there are still 
other sources on the Net where you can find out more information. Before 
you do so though, check out this MacWorld article that talks about a reviewer’s 
experience running OS X on a non-Apple netbook: 
www.macworld.com/article/138900/2009/02/apple_netbook.html

69
 Chapter 4: Netbook Operating Systems
Just because a netbook runs OS X, that doesn’t make it a Mac. Performance is 
going to be less than a vintage G4 PowerBook, and you’ll be missing many of 
the design and engineering features that define Apple products.
Me, I’ll patiently wait for a real Mac netbook. Hopefully it’ll be on the market 
by the time you read this.
Getting Google Android
I fondly remember the days when Google was just a Web search engine, and 
it was the new kid on the block, gunning for market leader AltaVista. Now 
Google seems to be everywhere and has its fingers in everything — including 
operating systems.
Google Android is an operating system for mobile phones. It’s optimized for 
using a number of Google’s Internet services (Google Maps, Google Apps, and 
so on). The OS is open source (based on the Linux kernel) and allows developers 
to easily write programs that run in it.
Android is a new operating system, and phone manufacturers such as Motorola, 
Samsung, and Sony Ericson are currently working on products that will use it.
What’s interesting about Android is that it could be scaled up to work on a 
netbook. In fact, some netbook companies have publicly stated they’re 
examining the OS for potential use in future products. (Telecom giant Nokia is 
also talking about using its phone operating system in netbooks.)
The next generation of netbooks will likely diverge into two lineages: netbooks 
with Atom processors running Windows (much like what currently is on the 
market); and cheap, $100-to-$200, no-frills netbooks with ARM processors 
running some type of open-source operating system such as Android. 
Considering Google’s bankroll and the importance of taking a leading role in 
this space, I wouldn’t be surprised if the company becomes a major player in 
the netbook game.
 
For more information on Android, visit www.android.com. You can also 
download a free, prerelease version of the operating system that will run on a 
netbook from: http://code.google.com/p/live-android.
Contending with Chrome
But wait, I’m not done talking about Google just quite yet. During the summer 
of 2009, the company dropped a bombshell and officially announced it would 
be releasing a brand new operating system for netbooks — which will later 
appear on desktop PCs and laptops.

70
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Dubbed Chrome OS, the free operating system is designed to run on ARM and 
x86 processors, boot almost instantly, work with Google Web apps (Google 
is calling it “a browser-based operating system”), and offer a security system 
that eliminates users worrying about viruses and security updates. Wow!
Google has stated it will make the Chrome OS source code open source 
toward the end of 2009, and netbooks running the operating system should 
be available by the second half of 2010. (When the operating system is 
released, you’ll also be able to download it and install it on older netbooks.)
This operating system has the potential to make serious waves in the 
computer world, especially as a number of industry heavy hitters are 
working with Google on the project — including Acer, Adobe, ASUS, 
Freescale, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and 
Toshiba.
The best place to get the latest on Chrome OS is to visit the official Web site 
at http://chromestory.com.
Windows versus Linux
Now that you have a general idea of what operating systems are available 
for netbooks, I need to lead you through a small minefield and talk about 
Windows versus Linux — just in case you may need to make a choice 
between the two operating systems.
Pros and cons
I’m not going to advocate for one system or the other (there are already 
enough flame wars on the Internet). Like most things, each operating system 
has its pros and cons. To give you some perspective, here are a few key 
advantages of each:
Windows advantages
 
✓ The user interface is more familiar.
 
✓ More programs are available (including specialized applications).
 
✓ Commercial applications tend to have a more polished user interface.
 
✓ It offers better hardware compatibility (especially with printers and 
scanners).

71
 Chapter 4: Netbook Operating Systems
Linux advantages
 
✓ Microsoft doesn’t make it, and it’s free. (More than a few people don’t 
have warm fuzzies about the software giant.)
 
✓ Many free, open-source programs are available (with similar functionality 
to popular Windows applications).
 
✓ It’s more secure (fewer viruses, worms, and Trojans).
 
✓ It provides better performance on computers with slower processors 
and less memory.
 
This whole discussion is probably moot as the Microsoft juggernaut continues 
to steamroller Linux in the netbook market. Windows netbooks outsell models 
running Linux by a wide margin now, and there’s a good chance manufacturers 
will start dropping Linux models because of poor sales. If you’re a Linux lover, 
take heart. You can always format the drive and install your favorite distro. 
And in the future, things may be different when Linux-based operating systems 
such as Chrome OS and Moblin debut.
Which to choose?
If you’re having trouble making up your mind, here are a few suggestions to 
steer you in the right direction:
Pick Windows if you . . .
 
✓ Have experience with Windows and don’t want to learn the nuances of a 
different operating system’s user interface.
 
✓ Plan on using Windows programs that aren’t available for Linux.
 
✓ Have hardware (printer, scanner, and so on) that isn’t compatible with 
Linux.
Pick Linux if you . . .
 
✓ Like the idea of free, open-source software.
 
✓ Already use Linux.
 
✓ Are willing to trade off a few quirks for a very secure operating system.
 
✓ Are ready to invest some time in learning a new operating system. (You 
should be up to speed in a week or two.)
 
✓ Are technically inclined — you don’t need to be a techie to use a Linux 
netbook, but being a little more technical makes it easier to do advanced 
procedures at times.

72
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
As much as I like Linux, at this point I have to say I’d steer most new netbook 
users to a Windows model. Linux is getting close to being a worthy competitor 
to Windows on the desktop, but it still has some quirks that can frustrate 
many people who have been using Windows for a while. I reserve the right to 
change my mind when $100-to-$150 netbooks running Android, Moblin, 
Chrome OS or whatever become available.
 
If you visit retail outlets to shop for netbooks, there’s a good chance you 
won’t find a Linux netbook to try out. Increasingly, retailers are stocking only 
Windows netbooks — several reports have shown Linux netbooks have a 
higher return rate than Windows models; this is likely because the user 
interfaces are different enough to initially frustrate an impatient Windows 
user. If you want a Linux netbook, you need to go online. And if you do, make 
sure the retailer has a decent return policy just in case the operating system 
isn’t for you.
The old switcheroo
If your netbook has an Intel x86 family processor 
(Celeron or Atom chip), keep in mind you’re not 
tied to using the preinstalled operating system. 
That means you can dump Windows for a Linux 
distro or give Linux the boot and replace it with 
Windows (a licensed copy of course). If you 
don’t like the new OS, just install the old one.
For Linux, first find a suitable distribution. 
Check out some of the online forums I mention 
in Chapter 22 — you can usually find a lot of 
discussion about distros and how to install 
them. 
Download the distro and burn it to a CD. (You 
can also put the distribution image on an SD 
memory card or a USB flash drive, but having 
an external DVD/CD-ROM is usually the 
easiest.)
Back up any files you want to save.
Boot from the distribution disc — this typically 
involves changing a BIOS setting or pressing a 
certain key sequence at startup to get a menu 
of choices. (I discuss this more in Chapter 21.) 
After the operating system has started, follow 
the installation instructions.
Many distributions come in “live” versions, 
which means you can boot and run the operating 
system in virtual memory, without reformatting 
the hard drive and replacing the original OS. It’s 
a great way to test drive an operating system.
Restart your netbook, and the new OS will run.
One very important warning when switching 
operating systems: Instead of supplying an 
install disc, some netbook manufacturers place 
a copy of the installation program and files on a 
separate partition of the hard drive. If for some 
reason you need to reinstall the operating 
system, these files are used. If you format the 
hard drive and install a new operating system, 
you’re going to be out of luck if you want to 
restore the original operating system. If an 
operating system install disc didn’t come with 
your netbook, contact the manufacturer to see 
whether you can get one.

You took the plunge (or are preparing to) and went out and bought 
yourself a shiny new netbook. Good for you. You’re going to find it’s a 
lot of fun and incredibly useful. But before you getting rolling with the fun and 
usefulness, you should know a few things.
Before a pilot can captain an aircraft he or she hasn’t flown before, another 
pilot with experience in the plane gives a check ride. The seasoned pilot goes 
over all the controls and gauges and explains important details. Then the 
inexperienced pilot starts the engine, taxis down the runway, and takes off for 
a short ride — all under the watchful eye of the check pilot.
Because I can’t be with you when you pull your new netbook out of the box, 
consider this chapter an official check ride. Now if you’ll step out onto the 
runway, you can get started.
Read the Manual
Would you please, pretty please with sugar on top, before doing anything 
else with your brand-new netbook, take a moment of your time, and ever-so-
thoughtfully peruse the pages of the user manual, paying careful attention to 
what it says?
More succinctly, read the first part of the user manual before you do anything 
else. Yes, I know you want to play with your new toy, but the manufacturer 
has some important things to say before you do — and the manual is where 
you find them.

74
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
This book is about all netbooks, and not one specific brand or model. 
Although many netbooks have common features and functionality, always 
check your user manual for specifics.
There’s a trend for manufacturers to skimp on user manuals and include only 
printed quick-start guides or posters with their products. They’re trying to 
keep the costs down so they can pass the savings on to you; margins on 
consumer electronics products are notoriously slim.
If that’s the case, read the quick-start information first. If there’s no printed 
user manual, it’s probably already installed on the netbook’s drive, and you’ll 
have to start up the little laptop first to view it. (The manual may also be on 
an included CD-ROM or DVD, in which case, use another computer with a 
DVD drive to read it.)
 
If you lost the user manual in the excitement of opening up the box, pay a visit 
to the support section of the manufacturer’s Web site and download a PDF 
version of the manual. I like to keep a copy of the manual stored on my primary 
PC so it’s easy to reference.
Power to the People
After you’ve read the manual (at least the “Getting Started” section — hint, 
hint), it’s time to feed your netbook a little juice. Your netbook’s battery 
should be charged to some extent, but if not, it’s a good idea to top it off.
If you just got a new netbook, I’m sure you’re eager to use it. But before 
powering on your netbook for the first time, I recommend you fully charge 
the battery. That means
 
1. Make sure the battery is properly inserted into the netbook.
 
2. Plug the power supply adapter cord into a wall socket.
 
3. Plug the power supply adapter into the netbook.
 
 Most netbooks are rated to handle 100 to 120 volts and 220 to 240 volts 
of AC (alternating current) — check your user manual to verify this. That 
means you can use the computer almost anywhere in the world you can 
get electricity from a wall socket. Depending on where you travel, you 
may need to purchase an inexpensive adapter so the plug correctly fits 
the socket type.

75
 Chapter 5: First Things First
 
4. Wait until the charging status light says the battery is fully charged.
 
 Depending on the netbook, this could be an orange light turning off or 
a green light turning on or something else. Check your user manual for 
details.
 
 Charge time depends on how much charge the battery has and its 
capacity. For example, a fully discharged 3-cell battery will charge faster 
than a fully discharged 6-cell battery. As a ballpark estimate, figure 
around 2 to 3 hours for a full charge. I discuss batteries at length in 
Chapter 13.
If you’re impatient and can’t wait to use your new netbook, you won’t hurt it 
if you don’t initially top off the battery — just keep the netbook plugged in 
to an electrical socket and let it fully charge when you’re done. It’s just good 
practice to do this with any battery powered device and it helps prolong 
overall battery life.
 
When some netbooks are plugged into a wall socket, the USB ports are 
powered even if the computer is turned off. This means you can use the 
netbook to charge your USB devices (such as MP3 players), even when the 
laptop isn’t turned on.
 
When you’re done using your netbook, turn it off like you would any Windows 
PC. In Windows XP, choose Start➪Turn Off Computer➪Turn Off.
Signing on the Dotted Line
Locate your netbook’s power switch — it can be inside or on one of the 
case’s sides — and turn it on for the first time. Your netbook happily comes 
to life, and you are greeted with a series of screens that prompt you to 
enter information such as the nationality of keyboard you’ll be using, a user 
account name and password, your time zone, and other bits of data that will 
configure the operating system.
To keep the lawyers happy, you’re also asked to agree to licensing terms. 
Most people blow this off and never read them, but feel free to if you have 
the time and inclination — especially around bedtime if you’re having trouble 
getting to sleep.
You only have to go through this initialization process once — when you 
first get your netbook. (However, if you ever have to reinstall the operating 
system, you’ll need to go through the sequence again.) When setup is 
complete, your netbook is now officially ready to use.

76
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
You Light Up My Life
With your netbook powered up, you’ll see various lights twinkling on the 
case — as an example, Figure 5-1 points out the status lights on an ASUS Eee 
PC model. These LED lights let you know at a glance whether your netbook 
is running and what it’s up to. Some netbooks may have only a single status 
light, whereas others have several. Typical lights include
 
✓ Power: Tells you whether the netbook is powered on or off. The light 
may be incorporated into the power switch or located elsewhere.
 
✓ Drive: Whenever the operating system or a program accesses the hard 
drive (or solid state drive) this light flashes.
 
✓ Battery: The battery status light provides information about the battery 
charge. Status lights vary from netbook to netbook; for example, the 
light may change from green to orange as the battery discharges and 
start flashing when there are only minutes of power left. When you’re 
charging your battery, this light also tells you when it’s fully charged. 
(In some models, the power and battery lights are combined.)
 
✓ Wireless: When the Wi-Fi card is on, a status light is illuminated.
 
 If you can’t get a wireless connection, always check the wireless status 
light. If it’s off, you need to turn on the wireless card. I tell you all about 
networking in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Bluetooth: If your netbook supports built-in Bluetooth, a light lets you 
know whether it is on or off.
 
✓ Webcam: If your netbook has a built-in Web camera (or webcam), it 
should have a status light that comes on when the webcam is on. This 
prevents potentially embarrassing moments.
 
✓ Keyboard status: Some netbooks have LED lights that indicate whether 
the Caps Lock or Num Lock keys have been depressed. Press the 
respective key to enable or disable.
 
If a program or Web site repeatedly refuses to accept a password, check the 
Caps Lock. On small netbook keyboards, it’s easy to accidentally press this key.
Check your user manual for more information on what status lights mean and 
where they’re located on your particular netbook.

Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Handling Parts and Pieces
Pick up your netbook. Wow, it’s really light. Now take a look at it, paying 
attention to the sides and bottom of the case. Here’s what you find:
 
✓ USB ports: Your netbook should have two or three USB 2.0 ports. This 
is where you can plug in a mouse, keyboard, DVD drive, light, fan, coffee 
cup heater, or any other useful or useless USB device. (Figures 5-2 and 5-3 
show the location of USB ports on an ASUS Eee PC model.)

✓ Ethernet port: This port looks like a slightly oversize phone jack, but 
don’t try to plug your phone or a modem cable into it. Instead, this port 
is for connecting to the Internet (or a local area network, LAN) with a 
cable that has an RJ45 connector — I talk more about this and networking 
in Chapter 6. Figure 5-4 shows the location of the Ethernet port (called 
the LAN port) on an ASUS Eee PC model.

✓ Audio-in port: This port is for attaching a microphone.
 
✓ Audio-out port: The audio-out port is for plugging in headphones or 
speakers. When a jack is plugged in to this port, sound doesn’t play 
through the built-in speakers. Refer to Figure 5-2 for the location of 
audio-in and -out ports on an ASUS netbook.
 
 The audio-in port usually has a small icon of a microphone next to it. 
The audio-out port has an icon of a pair of headphones. On a netbook, 
both icons are pretty tiny and difficult to see. To make distinguishing the 
ports easier, some netbooks use color coding: Pink is audio in, and green 
is audio out.
 
 The audio-in/out ports of most netbooks support a standardized
 1⁄8-inch 
(3.5mm) mini-jack.
 
✓ Built-in speakers: Your netbook has a pair of built-in speakers. Their 
location varies from model to model — look to the sides of the screen or 
somewhere on the case. (Figure 5-5 shows their location on an ASUS Eee 
PC.) Don’t expect high-quality, stereophonic sound. If you want to listen 
to decent sounding music, use headphones.

✓ Built-in microphone: Many netbooks have a built-in microphone handy 
for recording lecture notes and meeting presentations or for video 
conferencing. (Refer to Figure 5-1 for the location on an ASUS netbook.) 
Like the built-in speakers, don’t expect a high-level of audio quality — 
use an external microphone instead.
 
✓ Card reader: Most netbooks have a built-in SD (Secure Digital) memory 
card reader — typically the reader also supports MMC (MultiMedia 
Card) and SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) cards; some netbooks 
have readers that support additional types of memory cards. Press the 
memory card in the slot until it clicks into place. Press the card again 
to release and remove it. Refer to Figure 5-4 for the location of the card 
reader port on an ASUS netbook model.
 
 I discuss SD cards at length in Chapter 14.

81
 Chapter 5: First Things First
 
✓ VGA port: This port is for plugging in an external monitor or projector — 
it’s easy to identify with its three rows of five holes, which take a 15-pin 
connector. Your netbook sends a video signal of whatever appears on 
the screen to a device that’s connected to the VGA port. Refer to Figure 
5-4 for the location of the VGA port (display output) on an ASUS Eee PC.
 
 Instead of a VGA port, some netbooks have an HDMI port. This is a 
high-definition multimedia interface port for sending an uncompressed, 
all digital, high-definition audio and video signal to an HD television, 
monitor, or other device.
 
✓ Kensington lock: This is a slot (refer to Figure 5-4) for attaching an 
optional security cable. I discuss netbook security, including Kensington 
locks, in Chapter 9.
 
✓ Webcam: Many netbooks have a built-in webcam. Look at the case 
above the screen and smile. (Figure 5-1 shows the location of the 
webcam on an ASUS Eee PC.) Don’t expect high-definition quality out of 
these low-resolution (0.3 to 1.3 megapixels) cameras. They do, however, 
perform fine for video conferencing, using Skype (a program that allows 
you to make phone calls over the Internet), and instant messaging.
 
✓ Battery compartment: A netbook wouldn’t be a netbook if it had to be 
plugged into an electrical outlet all the time. Your battery needs a place 
to live and depending on your netbook, the battery compartment may 
be at the back of the case or on the bottom (refer to Figure 5-5). Check 
your user manual for information on removing and inserting batteries. (I 
provide more details on netbook batteries in Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Memory compartment: On netbooks supporting memory that can be 
upgraded, you can typically find a compartment on the underside of 
the case. (Refer to Figure 5-5.) There may also be a compartment for 
accessing the drive to replace it. In Chapter 18, I discuss upgrading 
memory and drives.
If you can’t figure out where any of the preceding parts and pieces are located 
or your netbook has a connector, compartment, port, slot, or thingamajig that 
you have no idea what it is, consult your friendly user manual.
Touching on Touchpads
The touchpad is the recessed rectangular area below the keyboard (refer to 
Figure 5-1). Directly below the touchpad, you find the mouse buttons. (A few 
netbooks incorporate the buttons to the right and left of the touchpad or 
directly on the touchpad surface so there are no visible buttons.) Some 

82
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
netbook models have two distinct buttons, whereas others feature what 
looks like a single, long button — clicking the left side of the bar is equivalent 
to a left mouse click, and clicking the right side is the same as a right mouse 
click.
 
If the mouse buttons feel a little stiff and clunky, most netbook touchpads 
support tapping — a single tap on the touchpad is treated as a mouse click, 
and two quick taps are a double-click. You can change touchpad settings in 
the Windows Control Panel — for many notebooks, double-click the Mouse 
icon in the Control Panel window to access the settings.
If you’ve never used a touchpad before, read on. Experienced laptop users, 
feel free to skip this section.
Lightly drag your finger (whichever one feels the most natural) across the 
touchpad surface to move the onscreen cursor. Drag to the right, and the 
cursor moves right. Drag up, and the cursor goes up. You get it.
To move the cursor more than a short distance, simply lift your finger when 
it starts to go off the touchpad, put it back down on the touchpad, and drag 
again. Repeat until the cursor is where you want it to be.
Some netbook touchpads have what looks like a blunt sewing needle printed 
on the pad. This is a visual clue that the touchpad supports scrolling. If 
there’s an up-and-down sewing needle, vertical scrolling is supported, and if 
there’s a right-to-left sewing needle, horizontal scrolling is supported. That 
means if you drag in the touchpad scrolling area, you can control programs 
that display a vertical (and/or horizontal) scrollbar. Drag up to scroll up. Drag 
down to scroll down. Drag left to left scroll. Drag right to right scroll.
 
If you’re so inclined, you can always plug a USB or wireless mouse into your 
netbook and use it instead of the touchpad.
Figuring out Function Keys
The top, first row of keys on your netbook are the function keys — sometimes 
called F keys. These keys allow you to quickly control different hardware 
components on your netbook. In addition to the key labels (such as F1, F2, 
and so on), these function keys also have small icons printed on them that 
give you a clue to their purpose — or depending on what the icon looks like, 
simply confuse you.
Function keys’ functions vary from one netbook to another, but here are 
some general things holding down the function key (often labeled Fn) key and 
then pressing the appropriate F or symbol key can do:

83
 Chapter 5: First Things First
 
✓ Turn the wireless card on and off.
 
✓ Turn Bluetooth (if built-in) on and off.
 
✓ Increase and decrease the screen brightness.
 
✓ Turn off display backlighting.
 
✓ Control the internal speaker volume.
 
✓ Control display output. (For example, when the netbook is connected to 
an external monitor or projector, this key toggles among showing only 
the netbook screen display, both the netbook and external monitor 
display, or just the external monitor display.)
 
✓ Turn the touchpad on and off.
 
✓ Put the netbook in sleep state (and wake it up).
Not to sound like a broken record, but refer to the user manual for a list of 
your netbook’s function keys and what they do.
Exchanging Data with Your Primary PC
Because there’s a good chance your netbook won’t be your main computer, 
you’ll likely want to exchange data between it and your primary computer. 
You can do this in a number of different ways, some simple, some complex. I 
mention four of my favorite options that don’t require a lot of techno-savvy.
Using USB flash drives
In the old days, you used floppy disks to move files between computers — 
fondly called a sneaker (as in shoes) net. I can’t remember the last time I 
saw a floppy disc drive on a new computer, and now the media of choice for 
getting files from Computer A to Computer B is a USB flash drive. These 
inexpensive and versatile drives are a must for quick backups and transferring 
files. To use them, simply follow these steps: 
 
1. Insert the flash drive in Computer A’s USB port.
 
2. Using Explorer, copy files to the drive — dragging works well.
 
3. Remove the drive.
 
 Don’t forget to use Window’s Safely Remove command in the taskbar 
before removing the drive.
 
4. Insert the drive in Computer B’s USB port.

84
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
 
5. Use Explorer to copy the files from the flash drive — again, dragging 
and dropping.
That’s all there is to it. I give you more information about these flash drives in 
Chapter 14.
 
Keep files you’ll be working on with different computers on a single USB flash 
drive. Plug the flash drive into your netbook when you want to edit a file and 
make your changes. If you want to work with the file on your desktop PC, do 
the same. This avoids any version control problems with multiple copies of 
files floating around. Just be sure to keep backups of the files in case you 
misplace your flash drive.
 
Don’t forget about your SD card reader. Many newer laptop and desktop PCs 
can read SD cards just like your netbook, and you can also use this media for 
transferring files.
Making the most of Windows file sharing
If you’ve set up a home network or are using your netbook with a work 
network, you can easily exchange files with Windows file sharing. If both your 
netbook and desktop PC (or laptop) are connected to the same workgroup, 
you can use shared folders to move files back and forth. I provide full details 
on file sharing in Chapter 6.
Making sense of online storage
Online storage is turning into a big deal these days. In the next decade, 
an estimated 70 to 75 percent of all PCs will be using some form of online 
storage. In fact, some manufacturers are even providing free secure 
online storage with the purchase of certain netbook models.
Online storage makes exchanging data between computers a snap. All you 
need to do is sign up with a storage service and then connect to a Web site 
and upload and download your files. (Some netbooks come with online 
storage programs installed, so be sure to check your user manual.) I discuss 
this option more and provide a list of popular online storage services in 
Chapter 17.
 
If you’re considering using online storage, check out a Web site called Backup 
Review (www.backupreview.info), which provides information and ratings 
on many online storage services.

85
 Chapter 5: First Things First
A simple, Net-centric way of getting files between computers is by sending 
a file as an attachment to your Web e-mail account. You can then open the 
e-mail from another computer and save the attachment. This works if you 
need to transfer only a few files. Also remember that most Web mail providers 
place limitations on attachment size — you may have trouble with a file that’s 
1GB or larger.
 
Be careful when storing documents with personal or financial information 
online — social security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account 
information, and so on. Although online storage Web sites may advertise all 
sorts of security measures, there’s always the risk a server could get hacked, 
the company could go out of business, or some other disaster could befall 
your data. If you’re going to store sensitive information online, encrypt it first. 
I give you tips on using encryption in Chapter 9.
Synchronizing with Briefcase
Although it’s easy to copy files or folders between computers by dragging 
and dropping, you may be faced with the problem of duplicate named files. 
If there’s already a file or folder with the same name, Windows politely asks 
if you’re sure you want to replace it. Although the file size and last modified 
dates are shown to help you determine whether it’s an older or newer version, 
it’s still a hassle — especially if you’re dealing with a significant number of 
files.
You can skip this headache and those annoying Confirm File Replace dialog 
boxes with a nifty Windows file synchronization feature called Briefcase. The 
following sections tell you how it works.
Making a Briefcase
Say you have some word processing and spreadsheet files you want to 
transfer to your netbook. (Or perhaps you have these files on your netbook 
and you want to move them to your desktop PC — it doesn’t matter, the 
process is the same.)
First you need to create a Briefcase:
 
1. On an empty part of the Windows desktop, right-click to open a 
pop-up menu.
 
2. Choose New➪Briefcase.
 
 A Briefcase icon named New Briefcase appears on the desktop. You can 
rename it if you like.
That’s all there is to it.

86
Part I: Getting Started with Netbooks 
Packing the Briefcase
Just like going on a trip, the next step is to pack the little case. This means 
copying any files you want to exchange with the other computer into the 
Briefcase. The Briefcase acts just like a folder — double-click to open it. You 
can then copy and paste files into the Briefcase just like you would with a 
folder.
Transferring the Briefcase
After you’ve copied any files you want to transfer to Briefcase, it’s time to 
copy the Briefcase to your netbook. Here are the steps:
 
1. Make sure any files you’ve copied to the Briefcase are closed.
 
 For example, if you have a Word document you want to transfer, don’t be 
working on it in Word.
 
2. Double-click the Briefcase (if it’s not already open).
 
3. Click either the Update All Items button or the Update All button.
 
 This step ensures Briefcase has the most recent versions of the files.
 
4. Copy the Briefcase to your netbook.
 
 You can use a USB flash drive, an SD card, or a network connection. (If 
you’re using a flash drive or memory card, make sure you have enough 
room to copy the Briefcase. You can right-click the Briefcase icon and 
click Properties in the pop-up menu to see how big the Briefcase file is.)
Working with the Briefcase
After the Briefcase is on your netbook, treat it like a folder. Leave any files 
you want to exchange with your desktop PC in it — programs treat Briefcase 
just like a folder when you use the File➪Open or File➪Save as menu commands.
When you want to transfer the files back to your desktop PC, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Copy Briefcase from your netbook to your desktop PC.
 
2. Double click Briefcase to open it.
 
3. Click the Update All button (or select the files to synchronize).
 
4. Click Update.
 
 Any modified files are now synced up. Repeat the process as needed.

Part II
Using Your 
Netbook

In this part . . .
A 
netbook is certainly not just meant to be looked at 
fondly and admired. You most certainly want to use 
your little laptop, and that’s what this part is all about.
I start with a chapter that puts the net in netbook — more 
specifically, it includes everything you need to know 
about networking and connecting to the Internet.
In the work department, I discuss various productivity 
software suites (both traditional software like Microsoft 
Office and the latest online services such as Zoho). I also 
devote a chapter to netbook security issues — both physical 
and networked. You definitely need some playtime to 
balance out the work, so I tell you what you need to know 
about listening to music, watching videos, and playing 
games on your netbook.
Social networking (using sites such as Twitter, Facebook, 
and MySpace) is big these days, and a netbook makes 
keeping in touch from just about anyplace a snap. If you 
haven’t tried Web-based social networking, I tell you what 
you need to get started — as well as some tips for getting 
the most out of instant messaging and Skype.
I wrap up with information about GPS and how to turn 
your netbook into a nimble navigator.

Netbook Networking
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networking
▶ Using 3G modems
▶ Considering Bluetooth
▶ Checking out wired Ethernet connections
▶ Browsing with Firefox
▶ Picking a netbook e-mail strategy
▶ Using Ultra VNC to remotely connect to a computer
▶ Sharing files on a Windows network
T
his chapter puts the Net in netbook — or maybe the book in netbook, 
take your pick. What I mean is that I cover everything you need to know 
about doing some serious networking with your netbook.
That of course includes wireless connectivity of all types (802.11, 3G, 
Bluetooth, and WiMAX) as well as the more old-school Ethernet cable way to 
connect to the Internet.
In addition to telling you about the basics of getting connected, I provide 
netbook-specific pointers on Web browsers and e-mail clients, how to use 
remote control desktop software, and the art of sharing files on a Windows 
network.
Your netbook was born to network, so what are you waiting for?
Wireless Wanderings
When you buy a netbook, you’ll undoubtedly want to use its wireless 
capabilities — that’s what the netbook is designed for, after all. In the 
following sections, I walk you through all the wireless radio wave wizardry 
options you have available for getting connected.

90
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
802.11
If you have experience connecting to the Internet with a wireless laptop, 
you can skip this section — you never know, though; you might discover 
something new. If you’ve never connected to the Net with a laptop, I tell you 
what you need to know to get started.
Wi-Fi basics
IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.11, better known 
as Wi-Fi or WLAN (wireless local area network), is a set of wireless standards 
for connecting to networks (most commonly, the Internet). Your netbook 
has a built-in wireless card and antenna that allow you to connect to the Net 
wherever there’s a nearby wireless router or access point (AP) — such a 
place is known as a hotspot. Wireless routers and access points access the 
Internet through a high-speed, wired connection and share this connection 
with computers via radio waves.
If the Wi-Fi hotspot is publicly accessible (doesn’t require a password), 
Windows happily connects to it, and voilà, you’re on the Internet. 
 
Wireless routers cost between $35 and $100 (depending on the model). 
Because they’re cheap and easy to install, many people connect them to their 
DSL or cable modems to create a wireless home network. If you do this, be 
sure to enable WPA security on the router. If you don’t, it’s possible for 
someone to “borrow” your wireless Internet connection — and rack up a big 
download bill if your bandwidth is metered.
Making a wireless connection
Windows is usually configured so it automatically connects to a nearby, open 
(with no security) access point. If your netbook doesn’t automatically con-
nect (or if you want to see whether any networks are available), here’s what 
you need to do:
 
1. Right-click the wireless icon in the Windows taskbar and choose View 
Available Wireless Networks from the pop-up menu.
 
 If you left-click the icon, a status dialog box appears and shows informa-
tion about the current wireless connection.
 
2. Select a wireless network you want to connect to in the dialog box 
and click the Connect button. (A connected network is shown in 
Figure 6-1.)
 
 If a lock icon is shown beneath the network name, that means the net-
work uses encryption and is secured. You need to enter the correct 
password to access the network.

802.11 alphabet soup
A veritable alphabet soup of letters has been 
tagged on to 802.11. Here’s what all those 
extra letters (which have to do with specific 
protocols) mean:
 ✓ 802.11a: This standard has a maximum data 
rate of 54 Mbps and a range of 35 meters. 
It broadcasts in the 5 GHz frequency range, 
which reduces the chance of interference 
but decreases its penetration. (Walls and 
other solid objects can absorb the radio 
waves.)
 ✓ 802.11b: This was the first widely adopted 
wireless standard and has a maximum 
speed of 11 Mbps with a range of 30 meters. 
Most 802.11b access points and routers 
used a security method called WEP, which 
isn’t very secure.
 ✓ 802.11g: The next step in wireless 
standards evolution was G. This version 
features increased speed (54 Mbps) and 
range (100 meters) compared with the older 
B standard. The 802.11g routers and access 
points also have beefed up security known 
as WPA.
 ✓ 802.11n: This new standard is expected to 
be finalized and released in 2010 — that 
hasn’t stopped some manufacturers from 
already releasing 802.11n products, though. 
It’s considerably faster at 108 Mbps with an 
expanded range of 300 meters.
Many wireless cards (and netbooks) can 
operate with several of these protocols — the 
system software automatically switches the 
protocol depending on whatever the router/
access point is using.
However, just having a speedy new 802.11n 
card in your netbook doesn’t mean you’re going 
to have a super-fast Internet connection. Even 
though you have 802.11n, if you’re connecting 
to an 802.11g access point, you get 802.11g 
speeds. As soon as the N standard becomes 
finalized, expect hotspots to replace their older 
routers and access points with newer, faster 
models.

92
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
 The signal strength bars are useful for determining how good the con-
nection is. Typically, the more bars, the better and faster the connection.
 
 Windows provides you with some status information as it tries to 
connect to the selected network and then tells you whether the 
connection was successful.
That’s it in a nutshell. It’s relatively straightforward — check your user 
manual for additional information. If you do run into problems, I recommend 
reading through this Microsoft troubleshooting guide: http://support.
microsoft.com/kb/870702.
 
You can turn off the wireless card to increase battery life. Also, you should 
turn off the wireless card while flying on a plane where wireless might 
interfere with the aircraft’s instruments — or so they say.
 
The 802.11b and g wireless cards and access points transmit and receive 2.4 
GHz radio waves. The problem with this frequency is that baby monitors, 
Bluetooth devices, certain cordless telephones, and microwave ovens also 
emit radio signals in the same general range. That means when you pop some 
popcorn in the microwave, there’s a possibility your Net connection will 
temporarily go snap, crackle, pop while the oven is on, depending where your 
netbook, microwave, and access point are located.
3G networks
Whenever you hear the term 3G (as in Third Generation), it refers to Internet 
access through cellular phone networks. It works like this:
You subscribe to a data plan through a cellular phone provider (or a 
combination voice and data plan). If you have a relatively current cell phone, 
you probably know what I’m talking about in that you can check e-mail and 
browse the Web from your phone. However, you can also use a 3G modem 
connected to your netbook (or laptop) to access the Net.
Unlike a Wi-Fi network, where you need to be near a wireless access point, 
with a 3G network you can be anywhere in the cellular network’s data 
coverage area to access the Internet. Speed is decent (especially if you’re 
stationary), but isn’t as fast as a good 802.11 wireless connection.
Some higher-end netbooks come with built-in 3G modems. If your netbook 
doesn’t have a 3G modem, you can add this type of wireless connectivity 
several different ways.

93
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
 
✓ USB: This 3G modem plugs into a USB port on your netbook, as shown in 
Figure 6-2.
 
✓ ExpressCard: A few netbooks come with an ExpressCard expansion 
slot — this is a smaller version of a PC Card. Several manufacturers offer 
ExpressCard 3G modems.
 
Figure 6-2: 
A plug-in 
USB 3G 
modem.
 
You can get a 3G modem through your cellular provider (or a compatible 
version from a retailer). Prices range between $100 and $200 depending on 
the model. But hold onto your hats because some providers are now offering 
discounted netbooks and modems when you sign up for a data plan — and 
if this marketing gimmick takes off, there may come a day in the future when 
carriers start giving away subsidized, no-frills netbooks for free like they do 
with phones.
Check with your cellular provider to get more information about its 3G 
services and compatibility with your netbook.
 
Before you sign up for 3G service, try to get some feedback about how the 
service is in your area — check out user forums such as www.howardforums.
com or http://cellphoneforums.net. Although a cellular carrier may 
claim coverage over a large area, some places may have faster and better 
connectivity than others.

94
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Bluetooth
A fair number of netbooks tout Bluetooth in their feature lists. But what 
exactly does that mean for you? Here’s the lowdown:
Bluetooth is a wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances — 
up to 10 meters or around 32 feet if you’re metrically challenged. A device 
sends out a 2.4 GHz radio signal, another device receives the signal, and the 
two devices start talking to each other.
 
Bluetooth is named after Danish King Harald “Bluetooth” Blaatand. No, Harald 
didn’t invent the wireless protocol — that would have been some mean trick 
since he died in 985. Actually, the good king was known for unifying Denmark, 
Norway, and Sweden. Because the inventors of Bluetooth saw the standard as 
a unifying communications protocol, they decided to honor King Harald. By 
the way, those symbols on the Bluetooth logo are the king’s initials in Nordic 
runes.
Bluetooth is a way to replace cables. There are Bluetooth-compatible printers, 
headphones, keyboards, mice, PDAs, cell phones, and GPS receivers. None of 
them require cables. One of the biggest uses of Bluetooth is synchronizing 
contact and calendar information among PDAs, laptops, and cell phones. 
If you don’t have an Internet connection but you do have a Bluetooth-
compatible phone and netbook, it’s also possible to wirelessly connect to the 
Net through the cell phone.
WiMAX
WiMAX stands for Worldwide Interoperability 
for Microwave Access. It’s an up-and-coming 
Fourth Generation (4G) communications stan-
dard — officially known as 802.16. The 4G 
services promise to give you wired broadband 
speeds on mobile devices — they’re designed 
primarily to move data and not voice like the ear-
lier generation standards. WiMAX also allows a 
provider to offer literally blanket Internet cover-
age: With 802.11, you need to be within 100 to 
300 feet of an access point; compare that with 
WiMAX, which has up to a 30-mile range.
Like 3G services, you subscribe to a data plan 
and use a plug-in USB modem to access the 
Net. At the present, companies like Clearwire 
(www.clearwire.com) have just started 
to roll out WiMAX networks in limited parts of 
the United States. Computer manufacturers are 
bullish on WiMAX and have announced plans to 
start offering laptops and netbooks with built-in 
4G modems. 
WiMAX isn’t the only horse in the 4G race. A 
competing technology known as LTE (Long-
Term Evolution) is favored by telecommunica-
tions companies, but as of 2009, it isn’t out of 
the gate yet — and likely won’t be available for 
another several years.
Keep your eye on 4G technologies. It’s what 
your netbook will likely be using (as well as your 
desktop PC, mobile phone, and maybe even 
your toaster) in the not-so-distant future.

95
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
Keep in mind that Bluetooth transfers data at a rate of 1 Mbps. That’s about 
three to eight times faster than the average speed of parallel and serial ports 
(which it aims to replace), but considerably slower than an 802.11 wireless 
connection — you’re not going to be using Bluetooth for your everyday 
Internet connection.
 
The next generation of Bluetooth, version 3.0, will amp up the protocol’s 
speed to a zoomy 24 Mbps. In addition to the speed increase, Bluetooth 
devices will also get improved power management capabilities so they’ll run 
more efficiently and longer on batteries.
What does all of this have to do with netbooks? Simple: If you use a Bluetooth 
device such as a cell phone, headphones, or a GPS receiver (or are planning on 
purchasing such a device in the future), be sure your netbook has Bluetooth 
so you can take advantage of it. (If you don’t need Bluetooth, you can save a 
few bucks on a model without it.)
If your netbook lacks Bluetooth but you want to join the party, you can get 
an inexpensive (around $20) Bluetooth adapter that you plug in to one of 
your USB slots — you may need to install driver software, but Windows 
might automatically do this for you. I talk more about Bluetooth adapters in 
Chapter 15.
Before using Bluetooth in Windows, you need to configure it, which you can 
easily do with a configuration wizard by just following the steps. You need to 
choose what types of services the computer will offer, such as file transfer, 
personal information manager (PIM) synchronization, headset, and so on, as 
shown in Figure 6-3.
 
Figure 6-3: 
During 
Bluetooth 
configura-
tion, you 
can specify 
services 
that your 
computer 
will offer.
 

96
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
When you’re finished with the configuration, Windows places a My Bluetooth 
Places icon on your desktop. By clicking the icon, you open a window, which 
is where you control all your Bluetooth connections (including searching for 
nearby devices) and settings. A Bluetooth icon is also installed in the taskbar 
for quick access.
Check your netbook’s user manual for more details on using Bluetooth.
 
If you have Bluetooth built into your netbook, you can turn it off to save on 
battery drain. Press a function key or use a menu command (check your user 
manual) to turn it on and off.
Easy Ethernet
All netbooks have an RJ45 jack located somewhere on the case. It looks like 
what you’d plug a landline telephone into but is a bit larger — if you try to 
plug a phone cord into it, it won’t fit.
The RJ45 jack is the key to wired network access because, behind it, your 
netbook contains a 10/100 Ethernet card. Plug one end of a cable with RJ45 
connectors (commonly called a CAT5 or Category 5 cable, shown in Figure 6-4) 
into your netbook and the other end into a router, switch, or wall network 
port, and you’re ready to go.
 
Figure 6-4:

tions.
 

97
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
If the router or switch you’re connecting to uses DHCP (Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol), Windows does everything for you and automatically 
connects to the Internet. It’s as easy as plugging in the cable and having 
Internet access in a matter of seconds.
 
Most networks use DHCP, but some use static Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
In these cases you’ll need to get an IP address from your system administrator 
and configure Windows to use it. Your administrator will provide you with 
instructions on how to do this.
If a wired Ethernet connection is available, here are a few things to consider:
 
✓ A wired connection is faster than a wireless connection — unless it’s a 
4G network, which I discuss in the previous wireless section.
 
✓ A wired connection uses less power than a wireless connection.
 
✓ A wired connection isn’t susceptible to radio wave interference.
 
✓ A network status icon appears in the Windows taskbar — it looks like 
two computer monitors, side by side. Move the mouse over the icon to 
check whether you have a wired connection. If you do, the connection 
speed is shown.
 
You don’t need to turn off your netbook’s wireless card when you’re using a 
wired connection. Windows is smart enough to handle two types of network 
connections at once. If you start getting odd networking errors though, 
consider turning off the wireless card.
Internet Instructions
After you connect to the Internet, I’m going to make a bold assumption you 
already know what to do — if I’m wrong, I suggest picking up a copy of The 
Internet For Dummies by John R. Levin, Margaret Levine Young, and Carol 
Baroudi (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Instead of telling you what a browser is and how to use e-mail, I give you 
various useful Net-related tricks that I’ve gleaned from using netbooks over 
the past several years.
 
I discuss social networking sites as well as Twitter and Skype in Chapter 10.

98
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Browsing the Web
If you purchase a Windows netbook, it’s going to come preinstalled with 
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE). If you’re like most users, you’ll start using 
IE to browse the Web and think nothing more of it.
That’s cool, but I want to make a pitch for downloading and trying Firefox 
(www.mozilla.com/firefox), a popular, free, open-source browser with 
versions that run in Windows, Macintosh OS X, and Linux. The browser, 
running on a netbook, is shown in Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
The Firefox 
browser on 
a netbook.
 
 
If you’ve been using IE for awhile, you’ll notice that Firefox is very similar. 
There are a few interface differences that are explained on the following site 
(a no-pressure sales pitch is also included): www.mozilla.com/en-US/
firefox/switch.html.
Firefox features
Most browsers share basic functions and generally work the same, but if 
you’ve never used Firefox before, I want to mention some features that make 
it my browser of choice on a netbook (as well as other computers):
 
✓ Built-in spell checking: No matter what Web site you’re on, as you type 
words that aren’t in the browser’s spelling dictionary, they’re underlined 
in red. This prevents many embarrassing typos when you’re composing 
Web e-mail.

99
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
 
✓ Enhanced security: I used to do quite a bit of computer security work, 
and still dabble in it, and quite honestly Firefox is the most secure Web 
browser for Windows. You’ll find phishing and spyware protection, 
easy private data clearing, and prompt update releases when security 
vulnerabilities are discovered.
 
✓ Multiple search engine support: Type a term in the toolbar and then 
select which search engine you’d like to use, such as Google, Yahoo!, 
Wikipedia, eBay, and others.
 
✓ Pop-up blocking: Firefox can automatically block annoying (and 
sometimes malicious) pop-up windows.
 
✓ RSS reader: Get RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, such as blog 
postings, news headlines, and Web site updates from inside the browser. 
 
✓ Session restore: If your computer crashes while Firefox is running (or 
you shut it down), the browser remembers and loads all the Web sites 
you had open the next time it runs. You can also elect to save all your 
open tabs when you quit — they automatically open the next time 
Firefox runs.
 
✓ Speed: Firefox is quick, even on netbooks with their small amount of 
memory and not-exactly-speedy processors.
 
✓ Add-ons: These are small programs for extending Firefox’s functionality. 
I provide more extensive coverage on these useful mini-programs in the 
next section.
 
✓ Tabbed browsing: Firefox pioneered the use of tabs versus separate 
windows for browsing, and it has a number of different options for 
maximizing tabbed Web surfing.
 
Microsoft has been playing catch-up with Firefox and has copycatted some of 
the preceding features in the latest release of IE. The Firefox developers aren’t 
sitting still, though, and are incorporating new, innovative features at a much 
faster rate than the Redmond giant.
I could go on listing more features, but instead, why don’t you start using the 
browser and discover all it has to offer? To read more about browsing the 
Firefox way, visit the official Web support site at http://support.mozilla.
com or check out the forums at http://forums.mozillazine.org.
Using Firefox add-ons
Other browsers have add-ons (small programs that provide additional 
functionality to the browser) but a big advantage Firefox has over the 
competition is the large number of free add-on programs and themes.
Add-ons come in three different types:
 
✓ Extensions: Small programs designed to extend the browser’s functionality

100
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
✓ Languages: A feature that changes the language of the user interface
 
✓ Themes: Code that alters the browser’s user interface
Add-ons tend to be relatively small (measured in kilobytes) and don’t take up 
a lot of disk space — which is important if disk space is at a premium on your 
netbook.
They are also very easy to install. The Firefox add-ons Web site (https://
addons.mozilla.org) contains descriptions, links, and reviews of over 
1,000 available add-ons. Installation is a matter of clicking a few buttons.
To get you started with add-ons, here are a few of my favorites that you may 
want to try:
 
✓ Adblock Plus: Blocks Web site advertisements, which is especially 
useful on a netbook with its smaller screen: https://addons.
mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1865.
 
✓ Forecastfox: A slick little weather add-on that gets forecasts from 
Accuweather.com and displays them in the status bar: https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/398.
 
✓ NoScript: If you’re concerned about Java and JavaScript security, use 
this add-on to execute scripts from only the sites you trust: https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722.
 
✓ Video DownloadHelper: Saves YouTube and other online videos to 
your drive: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/3006.
Have fun with add-ons. With the large number of available add-ons, you can 
spend hours browsing through the add-on database, reading reviews and 
descriptions, and downloading different versions.
 
Add-ons take up memory and processor cycles, so if you go crazy installing a 
lot of them, Firefox’s performance will begin to suffer. If this happens, just start 
removing the add-ons you’ve installed.
Maximizing screen real estate
In Firefox, you have a number of ways to deal with a netbook’s reduced size 
screen viewing area. Try one or more of the following:
 
✓ Hide the Windows taskbar. Right-click the taskbar at the bottom of the 
screen and choose Properties. Then select the Auto-Hide the Taskbar 
check box.
 
✓ Hide Firefox toolbars. From Firefox’s View menu, choose Toolbars. Then 
deselect the Navigation Toolbar and Bookmarks Toolbar check box.
 
✓ Hide the Firefox status bar. On the View menu, deselect Status Bar.

101
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
 
✓ Use a Firefox add-on. Several available add-on themes can maximize 
screen space. They include
 
• miniFox: This theme maximizes space between interface elements: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/607.
 
• Tiny Menu: Replaces the default menu with a reduced size version: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/1455.
 
• Compact Menu: Provides several ways of compressing the 
menu: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/4550.
 
• Full Fullscreen: Starts Firefox in full-screen mode and hides the 
toolbars: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/1568.
 
You can find other add-on themes for netbook screens besides the ones I 
mention here. Visit the Firefox add-ons site (https://addons.mozilla.
org/firefox) and do a search for compact.
Exchanging e-mail
If you’re like most people and use your netbook as a secondary computer, 
e-mail has the potential to become a royal pain in the you-know-what. 
Whenever you access your e-mail with a traditional e-mail client (such as 
Outlook or Thunderbird), messages are downloaded from a remote mail 
server to the inbox on your hard drive. After the message is successfully 
downloaded, it’s removed from the mail server — unless you set an option to 
keep it there.
So far, so good. The problem with traditional e-mail clients is that when you 
access mail on your primary laptop or desktop PC, messages are stored 
there, and when you check your mail on a netbook, messages are saved there 
too. Soon you have lots of e-mails scattered between your primary computer 
and your netbook. Good luck trying to keep all the messages on the two 
computers organized!
There are ways to synchronize inboxes between two computers, but instead 
I recommend the simple approach of using a Web mail account. They’re free, 
convenient, easy to use, and you don’t need to worry about e-mails stored on 
multiple computers — because messages are stored and managed remotely.
There are lots of free Web mail services available on the Net, but here are the 
biggies:
 
✓ Gmail: Google’s e-mail service (http://mail.google.com).
 
✓ Hotmail: Microsoft’s e-mail service (www.hotmail.com).

102
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
✓ Yahoo! Mail: The Yahoo! e-mail service (http://mail.yahoo.com).
 
✓ AOL Mail: The America Online e-mail service (http://mail.aol.com).
If you don’t have a free account with one of these services, you can create 
one on the preceding login Web pages.
 
For a great comparison of features that the different Web e-mail services offer, 
visit http://blogs.swebee.com/e-mail-service/free-webmail-
services-comparison/2008-05-01_69-1.html.
 
If you plan to exclusively use your netbook for accessing e-mail, I suggest 
you use a free e-mail program called Thunderbird (www.mozilla.com). It’s 
brought to you by the same people who provide the Firefox Web browser 
and is an excellent traditional e-mail client. Standalone e-mail programs have 
more features than Web-hosted mail systems, and Thunderbird is especially 
versatile because you can use it with a Web mail account.
Connecting remotely with Ultra VNC
Speaking of the Internet, I have to mention a very cool and useful tool that’s 
popular with geeks but is mostly unknown outside of techie circles. It’s a 
Windows version of a program and communications protocol called VNC 
(Virtual Network Computing). Here’s the general idea:
Say you’re on the road with your netbook and need something on your 
primary computer back home — maybe it’s a spreadsheet file you forgot or 
perhaps you need to get some information out of a database you don’t have 
installed on your netbook. Through the magic of the Internet, how would you 
like the desktop of your primary PC to appear on the netbook’s screen and 
then be able to transfer the file you need or run the database program on 
your home computer? You can do this with a free program called Ultra VNC 
(www.uvnc.com).
Installing Ultra VNC
Here are the basic steps to get rolling with Ultra VNC:
 
1. Download the Ultra VNC software and install it on your primary 
computer — not your netbook. Specify you want the server files 
during the installation. 
 
2. Download and install a copy of VNC on your netbook. Have the 
installation program install the viewer files.
 
3. Run the Ultra VNC server on the primary computer.
 
 It’s best to have a DSL or cable modem Internet connection, and always 
leave your primary computer running so you can access it anytime. 

103
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
 
 The configuration dialog box automatically appears, as shown in 
Figure 6-6.
 
4. Configure the server. 
 
 Among settings you need to provide is a password, which you can enter 
in the Authentication area in the VNC Password text box. This password 
prevents anyone from logging onto the computer. Don’t let the complicated 
dialog box intimidate you. Unless you want to use some of the advanced 
features of Ultra VNC, just enter a password and leave the other default 
settings alone.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Configuring 
the Ultra 
VNC server.
 
 
If you’re using a router or firewall on your primary computer, you need to 
change settings to allow Ultra VNC to send and receive data on a certain 
port — the technical term for this is port forwarding.
 
Go to www.youtube.com and search for Ultra VNC to view video tutorials and 
demonstrations of Ultra VNC in action. The Ultra VNC home Web site also has 
documentation and tutorials.
Using Ultra VNC
When Ultra VNC is running in server mode on your primary computer (which 
is connected to the Internet), here’s how to access the server:
 
1. Run Ultra VNC in Viewer mode on your netbook.

104
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
2. Connect to your primary computer using its IP address.
 
 You need to determine the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the server 
computer so that you can connect to it. A number of free Web sites can 
return the IP address of a computer that visits them — for example, 
www.ip-adress.com and http://whatismyipaddress.com.
 
 Most Internet service providers provide dynamic versus static IP 
addresses. This means if your Internet service is temporarily interrupted, 
such as with a power outage, your computer may be assigned a new IP 
address. This can create problems connecting with Ultra VNC which 
relies on a current IP address. The solution is to use a free dynamic 
DNS (Domain Name System) service — I personally like DynDNS. After 
installing a program on your computer, instead of using a numeric IP 
address to access a remote computer, you can use a hostname such as 
mycomputer.ath.cx. If the dynamic IP address ever changes, it’s no big 
deal. Check out www.dyndns.com for more information.
 
3. Enter the server password.
Ultra VNC now shows the desktop of your primary computer in a separate 
window, as shown in Figure 6-7.
When you move or click the mouse in the window (or type), it sends those 
commands to your primary computer. In effect, you’re remotely controlling 
the other computer (including running programs on it) and watching the 
results in the Ultra VNC window.
 
Figure 6-7: 
This 
netbook 
is running 
Ultra VNC 
remotely

program 
on another 
computer.
 

105
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
A series of icon commands appears at the top of the screen. Here you change 
different options, initiate file transfers between the two computers, and close 
the connection.
The main downside to using Ultra VNC (or any remote desktop program; 
there are other free and commercial versions available) is the screen-size 
disparity between your larger-screen primary computer and smaller-screened 
netbook — you’ll need to scroll to see the full screen. 
 
If you often find yourself playing computer technical support for less-savvy 
friends and family members, Ultra VNC is a great tool for remotely trouble-
shooting their problems.
Sharing files on a Windows network
A router (or switch) allows a single broadband Internet connection to be 
shared by multiple computers. You hook up the router to a DSL or cable 
connection, and it provides other computers with access to the Net — either 
with plugged in Ethernet cables or wirelessly, depending on the router type. 
Routers also offer essential security against outside intruders serving a 
hardware firewall. 
In addition to accessing the Internet, multiple computers connected to a 
router can communicate with each other in a local area network (LAN), 
which makes it easy for computers running Windows to share files and even 
printers.
A Windows network is very useful for netbooks because you can transfer files 
between your primary computer and print files — all via the network.
I want to give you a synopsis of what’s involved in sharing files over a 
Windows network, but I don’t have the space for it. Entire books have been 
written on the subject, so I’m just going to provide a brief overview. For more 
details, check out Microsoft’s extensive collection of tutorials and guides for 
XP networking at www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/
default.mspx.
 
For networking with Windows 7, which as I write this hasn’t been released, 
check out the main product page at www.microsoft.com/windows/
windows-7/default.aspx.
For starters, Microsoft uses a Network Setup Wizard that makes it fairly 
painless to get a home network up and running. You can find the wizard by 
clicking Network and Internet Connections in the Windows Control Panel.

106
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
All computers in the network need to have the same workgroup name. By 
default, Microsoft uses the name workgroup. You can change the workgroup 
name by right-clicking the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop and 
choosing Properties. Then click the Computer Name tab. If you change the 
workgroup or computer name, you need to restart the computer.
After you have your network configured, here’s what you need to do to share 
a folder on a Windows network. (This applies to a netbook or any other PC 
running Windows XP on the network.)
 
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore.
 
2. Right-click the folder you want to share and choose Sharing and 
Security.
 
 A folder Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
3. Select the Share This Folder on the Network check box and click OK. 
(You can optionally give the folder a different shared name in the 
Share Name text box.)
 
Figure 6-8: 
Setting up a 
folder to be 
shared in a 
Windows 
network.
 
A hand icon appears on the folder, indicating it’s shared. Any computer on 
the network can now access the folder. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the My Network Places icon on the Windows desktop.
 
 A window with computers connected to your Windows network appears.

107
 Chapter 6: Netbook Networking
 
2. Double-click a shared folder you want to access.
 
 A list of files and folders inside the folder appears (as shown in Figure 6-9). 
You can double-click a file to open it or copy files to your hard drive by 
dragging and dropping.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Accessing 
a shared 
folder in a 
Windows 
network.
 
 
One of the biggest challenges to getting a Windows network working properly 
can be software firewall settings. A firewall can block a computer within the 
network from sending and receiving data packets from other computers. If 
shared computers don’t show up in My Network Places, the first place to 
check is your firewall settings — make sure LAN traffic is allowed.

Netbooks at Work
In This Chapter
▶ Getting down to business with Microsoft Works
▶ Using Microsoft Office
▶ Opting for OpenOffice
▶ Working online with Google Docs
▶ Discovering Zoho
N
etbooks are nifty productivity tools. Because of their size, they’re 
perfect for business trips, presentations, or anytime you need to work 
but don’t feel like lugging around a traditional laptop or sitting down to a 
desktop PC.
Because most netbooks run Windows, it’s a snap to use many familiar 
business-related Windows programs — as long as you abide by the terms 
of the license agreement, of course.
In this chapter, I get down to work with netbooks. I’m guessing you already 
know about Microsoft mainstays Word, Excel, and PowerPoint (which I briefly 
discuss), but you may not know much about Microsoft Works (which often 
comes preinstalled on many netbooks) or OpenOffice (a free, open-source 
alternative to Microsoft Office).
In addition to these traditional software packages that you download or 
install from a CD-ROM or DVD, you can also find and make use of some very 
slick, Web-hosted productivity alternatives such as Google Docs and Zoho.
So grab a cup of coffee and pull up a chair as I survey different ways to put 
your netbook to work.

110
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Working with Microsoft Works
Microsoft Works is the kid-brother to Microsoft Office: It’s smaller, cheaper, 
and doesn’t have as many features. Because some netbooks come bundled 
with Works, I spend a little time telling you about this consumer-grade 
productivity suite.
Works comes with a word processor, spreadsheet, database, calendar, and 
dictionary.
Over the years, manufacturers have bundled Microsoft Works on PCs of all 
shapes and sizes. In the old days, all the Works programs ran in the same 
window and used the same interface. However, with Works 2000, Microsoft 
switched over to a more familiar, modular approach, where each program 
runs in its own window. (As I write this, the current release of Works is 
version 9.)
When you run Works, you’re greeted with a task launcher page (shown in 
Figure 7-1). Click a program icon on the left side of the window to run that 
program.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The 
Microsoft 
Works task 
launcher.
 
 
When you load Works, Microsoft Office program icons may be displayed. If 
they are, these are trial versions of the Office programs and will work for only 
60 days or a limited number of file opens — after that, you need to purchase a 
registered version. Works itself is not a trial version, though.

111
 Chapter 7: Netbooks at Work
When you run a Works program, you’re prompted as to whether you want to 
open a blank document or use a template (shown in Figure 7-2). Templates 
allow you to easily create professionally formatted newsletters, greeting 
cards, invoices, schedules, and other forms.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Microsoft 
Works has 
a variety of 
document 
templates.
 
Older versions of Microsoft Works often got a bad rap for using a proprietary 
document format that wasn’t compatible with any other applications — 
including Microsoft Office programs. That’s changed with the most recent 
releases, and you can import and export all the common Office file formats. A 
file created with Microsoft Word is shown opened in Works in Figure 7-3.
You can still hear people on the Internet grousing about Works and how other 
better, free alternatives are available — and that’s true. OpenOffice (more on 
that coming up in this chapter) and AbiWord (a free word processor down-
loadable from www.abisource.com) have many more features. However, the 
current release of Works isn’t that bad, and I have a feeling many of the com-
plaints came from those who used older versions.
If you’re looking for a basic, easy-to-use collection of productivity programs 
and if Works came preinstalled on your netbook, give it a try and see what 
you think. (However, I wouldn’t run out and purchase a copy of Works, 
because of the free alternatives I mention here.)
You can find out more about Works directly from the Microsoft source at 
www.microsoft.com/products/Works/default.mspx.

If Works was preinstalled and you decide to remove it to save disk space, it 
might not be easy to restore the program after you’ve uninstalled it. Many 
netbook manufacturers don’t include a separate install program for Works — 
you have to do a full system restore from a recovery disc or drive partition to 
get the program back.
Managing Microsoft Office
I’m not going to spend a lot of time discussing Microsoft Office. The 
productivity suite is pretty much the de facto standard in the business world, 
and if you’ve used a Windows computer in the past, I’m guessing you’ve been 
exposed to the ubiquitous Word (shown in Figure 7-4), Excel, and PowerPoint.
From a netbook standpoint, Office works just like it does on a traditional 
laptop or desktop PC — although the performance isn’t as zippy due to the 
netbook’s underpowered processor and limited memory. If you use Office 
on your primary computer, it’s nice to have the same interface and file 
compatibility on your netbook.
Some netbooks come with a trial version of Microsoft Office. This free demo 
lets you evaluate the software for a limited period of time. To use the trial 
version, you need to activate the software the first time you use it — if you 
don’t, the program runs in Reduced Functionality mode, which means you 
can view documents but can’t edit, save changes, or create new documents.

uitous

book.
 
When you run one of the Office programs for the first time, follow the 
prompts to activate the software — an Activation Wizard contacts Microsoft 
over the Internet and does the rest.
When the trial period is over, Office returns to Reduced Functionality mode — 
any documents you created or edited will still be there, but you can view 
them only with the Office programs on your netbook. (You can edit the 
documents if you move them to another computer running a registered version 
of Office.) You need to purchase a license to restore the full functionality of 
Office, which you can get either online or from a retail outlet.
 
For more information on Office activation, go to http://us20.trymicro
softoffice.com/faq.aspx.
My biggest complaint with Microsoft Office is that, like many other 
software packages, it has become increasingly bloated over the years. On an 
underpowered netbook, performance can get pokey if you’re working with 
large documents or have a number of files open — and please, don’t even 
attempt to run complex spreadsheet models unless you want to wait forever.
 
I’ve found that older versions of Office (specifically the 1997, 2000, and XP 
versions) are less resource-intensive and better performers — you should still 
avoid complex spreadsheets, though. If you have an old, licensed copy lying 
around, consider running it on your netbook instead of Office 2003, 2007, or 
later.

114
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
It sounds like Microsoft may be planning a trimmed down version of Office 
for netbooks with the next release of the product — dubbed Office 2010. 
During a technology conference in the spring of 2009, without giving away 
any details, the president of Microsoft’s business division said the company 
would be incorporating netbooks into its overall plans for Office. In addition 
to the traditional software, also look for an online version of the productivity 
suite called Office Web Apps.
To get more information about Office, visit http://office.microsoft.com.
 
Because netbooks don’t have built-in DVD drives like many other PCs, what 
do you do if you’ve purchased a copy of Office and want to install it on your 
netbook? The friendly folks in Redmond make it easy. With your netbook 
connected to the Internet, go to www.getmicrosoftoffice.com. There you 
can download the installation files directly to your netbook — you’ll need the 
25-digit product key found in the software package. When the download is 
finished, install Office, and you’re ready to go.
Considering the OpenOffice Option
OpenOffice is an office application suite of programs. The legally correct 
name is OpenOffice.org, but most people refer to it as OpenOffice. Think of it 
as a free, open-source Microsoft Office alternative (with a few more features, 
actually).
OpenOffice started life in the late 1990s as StarOffice, a commercial office 
application suite. Sun Microsystems (which was in a pitched battle with 
Microsoft at the time) purchased the software from a German company and 
then made it available for free. In 2000, Sun released the source code, and 
OpenOffice became an open-source project. Over the years, it has evolved 
from a slightly clunky collection of programs to a full-featured, viable 
alternative to Microsoft Office.
 
StarOffice, which is preinstalled on some netbooks, has most of the same 
programs and interfaces as OpenOffice.
OpenOffice (the startup screen is shown in Figure 7-5) comes with several 
programs, including
 
✓ OpenOffice Base: A database application similar to Microsoft Access
 
✓ OpenOffice Calc: A spreadsheet program similar to Microsoft Excel
 
✓ OpenOffice Draw: A vector graphics program with features comparable 
to early versions of CorelDRAW

115
 Chapter 7: Netbooks at Work
 
✓ OpenOffice Impress: A presentation program similar to Microsoft 
PowerPoint
 
✓ OpenOffice Math: A utility for creating and editing mathematical 
equations (similar to Microsoft Equation Editor)
 
✓ OpenOffice Writer: A word processor (shown in Figure 7-6) that has a 
set of features similar (and a similar look and feel) to the Microsoft Word 
features
 
Figure 7-5: 
OpenOffice 
startup 
screen.
 
One program that OpenOffice doesn’t come with is an e-mail/scheduling 
application like Microsoft Outlook. You need to download and install 
open-source Thunderbird and Sunbird to get this functionality.
For the most part, OpenOffice is compatible with Microsoft Office format 
files. That means you can copy a Word file from your PC onto a USB flash 
drive, plug it into your netbook, and work on the document with OpenOffice. 
And when you get back to your main PC, Word can happily read all the edits 
you made on your netbook.
 
You will likely run into compatibility troubles if your Microsoft Office 
documents have complex graphics, fancy fonts and formatting, nested tables, 
complicated macros, and embedded OLE objects.
OpenOffice programs can save files in Adobe Acrobat PDF format, so you 
don’t need commercial or free conversion applications.

Versions of OpenOffice are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. To find out 
more about OpenOffice or to download a version visit www.openoffice.org.
 
If you want to give OpenOffice a try without installing it on your hard drive, 
check out this portable version: http://portableapps.com/apps/
office/openoffice_portable. It runs on a USB flash drive or an SD card 
with about 250MB of free space available. After you install it, just plug in the 
drive or card and run OpenOffice on any Windows PC.

If you’re an OpenOffice user or a potential 
one, consider checking out some of the many 
resources available on the Internet to get more 
information about the suite. Here are some of

Going Online with Google Docs
Google Docs (http://docs.google.com) is a free, online suite of office 
programs, including a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation 
application. Instead of the conventional approach of using standalone 
programs installed on your netbook (or any other PC for that matter), Google 
Docs lets you create, edit, and store documents online by using a Web 
browser and an Internet connection. The Google Docs interface is shown in 
Figure 7-7.
 
Figure 7-7:

You need a free Google account to use Google Docs. Either sign in with your 
existing account information or create a new account.
Some of Google Docs’ features include
 
✓ A simple, easy-to-use interface
 
✓ The ability to save documents in PDF and other common formats
 
✓ The ability to import Microsoft Office and OpenOffice documents 
(An imported Word document is shown in Figure 7-8.)
 
✓ Collaboration options that allow documents to be shared, opened, and 
edited by multiple users at the same time
 
✓ The ability to publish documents as Web pages

check out the Google Docs development team’s blog at http://google

Storing your documents online and working on them from anywhere you 
can get an Internet connection is pretty appealing — especially with a go-
anywhere netbook. However, before you start putting all your eggs in the 
Google Docs basket, you should be aware of a few catches:
 
✓ Internet connection required: No Net means no access to documents. 
Google Docs does, however, allow you to save documents directly to 
your netbook.
 
✓ Basic features: The word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation 
programs have basic features. If you need advanced functions and features, 
you should turn to a conventional office program like Microsoft Office or 
OpenOffice.
 
✓ Document size and total storage space: Google Docs puts limitations 
on how large a single document can be as well as the total number of 
documents that you can store online. See the “Google Docs limitations” 
sidebar for more.
 
✓ Theoretical security issues: There are some theoretical security and 
privacy issues with using Google Docs. Not to be overly paranoid, but I 
personally wouldn’t use it to work on a document that contains sensitive 
information.
I’ve just scratched the surface on Google Docs, and there’s a lot more to 
discover, so pay a visit to http://docs.google.com/support.

 Chapter 7: Netbooks at Work
Getting in the Zoho Zone
Another option in the online productivity suite department is an amazing 
collection of programs available from Zoho (www.zoho.com). Like Google 
Docs, you dispense with traditional office software installed on your hard 
drive and do everything over the Net instead. Figure 7-9 shows the Zoho 
desktop interface. (In case you’re curious, the name Zoho is a deliberate 
misspelling of SOHO, an acronym for Small Office/Home Office.)
Starting out with only an online word processor about four years ago, Zoho 
has added a wide array of products to its application suite. The company’s 
Web services are extremely popular with around 1.5 million registered users 
and 500,000 unique monthly logins.
Zoho caters to individuals as well as organization and small-to-medium-size 
businesses. Online applications are free for individuals, but the company 
charges subscription fees for some of the business-oriented services.
If you’ve never checked out Zoho, you’ll be surprised at the number of 
programs that are available. Here’s what’s currently offered in the way of 
productivity software:
Google Docs limitations
Aside from needing an Internet connection to 
use the Google Docs applications, you should 
be aware of a few other limitations to the online 
service.
You have a limited amount of storage space 
with each Google account:
 ✓ Docs: Each doc can be up to 500K, plus up 
to 2MB per embedded image.
 ✓ Spreadsheets: Each spreadsheet can 
have up to 256 columns, 200,000 cells, or 
100 sheets — whichever is reached first. 
There’s no limit on rows.
 ✓ Presentations: Files in PowerPoint formats 
(.ppt and .pps) can have a maximum 
size of 10MB or 200 slides. Files uploaded 
from the Web can be up to 2MB. E-mailed 
files can be up to 500K.
 ✓ PDFs: You can store up to 10MB per PDF 
from your computer and 2MB from the Web 
in your Docs list. You can have up to 100 
PDF files.
Google Docs also has the following limitations:
 ✓ Files can only be uploaded or downloaded 
one at a time.
 ✓ Older Web browsers aren’t compatible with 
Google Docs.
Google is always tweaking its services, and 
some of these limitations may change in the 
future.

face.
 
 
✓ Zoho Chat: You can embed this chat application into pages or blogs. 
Zoho Chat also supports private instant messaging and can integrate 
with many popular chat clients.
 
✓ Zoho Mail: This Web-based collaboration program includes e-mail, 
calendar, and document, task, and contact management features. It also 
integrates with Zoho Sheet, Show, and Writer.
 
✓ Zoho Notebook: A tool for organizing information similar to Microsoft 
OneNote or Google Notebook. You can include text, images, video, and 
audio in a “notebook” and optionally share the notebook or its individual 
pages over the Net.
 
✓ Zoho Planner: It’s just what it sounds like: an online planner with a 
calendar, to-do lists, pages, and reminders that’s similar in functionality 
to Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. You can share the information 
with other people.
 
✓ Zoho Share: It’s a service for sharing content of all types. Think of it as a 
cross between Microsoft SharePoint and YouTube.
 
✓ Zoho Sheet: Every productivity suite needs a spreadsheet, and this is 
Zoho’s. It’s compatible with Microsoft Excel file formats.
 
✓ Zoho Show: This online presentation application allows users to create 
or import Microsoft PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.
 
✓ Zoho Wiki: This program acts as a simple wiki and Web page–creation 
tool.
 
✓ Zoho Writer: The suite’s word processor supports most common 
document formats as well as multiuser collaboration. (See Figure 7-10.)

In addition to productivity applications for individuals, Zoho has a series of 
business-oriented applications that include
 
✓ Zoho Creator: A database-creation tool. Picture an easy-to-use Microsoft 
Access (with basic features), only online. Use drag and drop tools to 
create custom forms.
 
✓ Zoho CRM: CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. This 
application helps a business manage sales leads, accounts, campaigns, 
forecasts, and activities.
 
✓ Zoho Invoice: An online invoice generator and tracking program. With it, 
you can create, send, and track estimates and invoices.
 
✓ Zoho Meeting: A Web conferencing application that supports audio, 
video, and presentation display.
 
✓ Zoho People: A human resources program for handling recruitment, 
common organizational forms and charts, and more.
 
✓ Zoho Projects: A classic project management application that supports 
tasks, task ownership, deadlines, milestones, Gantt charts, and 
everything you need to track a project.
 
✓ Zoho Reports: An online database and reporting program.

122
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
In addition to applications included in the productivity and business suites, 
Zoho offers tools such as Zoho Challenge (an online test and evaluation 
program), Zoho Polls (a survey application) and Site 24x7 (a Web site statistics 
service). New applications and tools are frequently introduced, and existing 
versions are often updated.
It’s hard to do justice to Zoho in words alone, and I encourage you to go to 
www.zoho.com and try the applications for yourself. In my opinion, some of 
the features and functionality beat the competing Google services.

Netbook Fun and Games
In This Chapter
▶ Listening to music
▶ Tuning in to podcasts and Net radio
▶ Watching videos and movies
▶ Playing games
▶ Dealing with netbook gaming limitations
I
n addition to checking e-mail, browsing Web sites, and using productivity 
software, a netbook is also one sweet little portable entertainment center. 
With it, you can listen to music and radio stations, watch movies, and play 
games.
This chapter is all about fun and games. Here I tell you everything you need 
to know about listening to music, podcasts, and streaming audio on your 
netbook. I then cover watching DVD movies and streaming videos, and I 
explain how to watch movies if your netbook doesn’t have an external DVD 
drive. I wrap things up with a discussion of playing games on your netbook 
and a description of the limitations that might stymie a hardcore gamer.
Remember, all work and no play makes a dull netbook.
Music to My Ears
No, I’m not advocating you ditch your MP3 player or cell phone and start 
listening to music exclusively on your netbook — I’ve yet to see someone 
with a netbook strapped to their arm or tucked in a front shirt pocket. That 
would be crazy.
Instead, I want to clue you in to different aspects of using your netbook to 
groove to tunes. It’s nice to listen to music while working or browsing the 
Web, and because you’re already using your netbook, you may as well plug in 
some headphones and rock (or chill out with a calm instrumental if need be).

124
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
Most MP3 player headphones should fit your netbook’s audio output jack.
Using an MP3 player is pretty simple, but if you want to turn your little 
laptop into a mobile jukebox, you should know a few things. Don’t press Fast 
Forward, but keep on reading.
MP3 mania
If you don’t know it, MP3 stands for Moving Picture Experts Group-1 Audio 
Layer 3 — which is a mouthful to say. It’s arguably the mostly widely used 
format for storing digital music. If you copy an MP3 file to your netbook and 
double-click it, there’s a very good chance Windows Media Player (or some 
other program) will start, and if you have the speakers turned up, a song will 
begin playing.
 
If you copy more than one MP3 file to a folder on your netbook, you can have 
the music player program play all the songs in the folder, one after another — 
or randomly shuffle through the entire collection. Check your media player’s 
online help file for instructions on how to do this.
 
Other common digital music formats you should know about are WMA 
(Windows Media Audio, used by Microsoft); AAC (Advanced Audio Coding, 
used by Apple); and OGG (Ogg Vorbis, an open-source format — you’ve got 
to love geeks and their weird naming sense). If you see a file with any of these 
extensions, it’s digital music or sound.
Although Windows Media Player plays MP3 files and other sound formats, 
many people who listen to music on their netbooks use some other music 
playing software. There’s nothing wrong with Windows Media Player — it’s 
just that there are better options available. Here are some top picks:
 
✓ iTunes: If you have an Apple iPod, you already know about iTunes and 
likely have installed it on your netbook. iTunes is a proprietary media 
player that can play and organize digital music and video files. The 
program also manages music on Apple iPods and iPhones. In addition, 
if you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes can access the iTunes Store, 
where you can purchase and download music — as well as videos, 
games, audiobooks, and other media. iTunes itself is free, and you can 
download it from www.apple.com/itunes.
 
 Music downloaded from the iTunes Store has traditionally been encoded 
with copy protection — the music can play only on the computer that 
downloaded the song (or the iPod the music was copied to). In January 
2009, Apple announced it would eventually stop selling music with 
digital rights management (DRM) restrictions, which means it will be 
easier to copy tunes to your netbook.

125
 Chapter 8: Netbook Fun and Games
 
✓ Songbird: If you don’t like to be locked into proprietary media players 
from Apple or Microsoft, I have one word for you: Songbird (see Figure 
8-1). Songbird is somewhat like Firefox and Internet Explorer — the little 
guy is up against the 800-pound gorilla, which in this case is iTunes. 
Songbird shows a lot of promise and is turning into a mature and 
feature-rich program for playing and managing your music. Check it out 
at http://getsongbird.com.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The 
Songbird 
music 
player and 
organizer.
 
 
✓ WinAMP: Last but not least is the granddaddy of music playing programs, 
WinAMP, which was released way back in 1997. I have to mention this 
software for nostalgic reasons as well as recommend it as a simple, 
no-frills music player that just plain works — particularly the pre-5.0 
versions, which don’t take up a lot of system resources. One of the other 
benefits to WinAMP is the large number of add-ons and skins (files that 
customize the appearance and user interface) that are available. You can 
download the current version of WinAMP at www.winamp.com or older 
versions at www.oldversion.com/Winamp.html.
 
In addition to playing MP3s, your netbook can record MP3 files. By using 
the netbook’s built-in microphone (or plugging in an external mic for better 
sound quality), you can record lectures, immortalize your baby’s first words, 
or prove to your spouse that he indeed does snore in the middle of the night. 
Instead of using the Windows sound recorder accessory program, download 
a copy of Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net), a free and 
powerful sound editor.

126
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Streaming audio
Most people know they can play MP3 files on a computer. But you might 
not be aware of the large number of podcasts (a downloadable audio 
broadcast) and radio stations that stream music, news, and commentary 
over the Internet. An example of a streaming radio station is shown in 
Figure 8-2.
 
Unlike downloading a music file where you have to wait until the file finishes 
downloading to play it, streaming works by sending a continuous stream of 
data to your music player. After a certain amount of data is saved to disk (a 
process called buffering), the audio starts to play.
The player continues to download the audio stream, buffering as necessary, 
until the program is finished. Streaming audio is an efficient way of providing 
a large amount of data to many people at once. In most cases, the complete 
audio program isn’t permanently saved on your hard drive — a temporary 
file may be saved but usually is automatically deleted after you quit the 
music player program.
The cool thing about many of these podcasts and radio stations is they have 
an international reach — as well as a unique voice outside the typical 
homogenized corporate media you typically hear on your car radio. If you 
have a Net connection and live in Heartland America, you can easily tune in 
to Radio Netherlands to get a European view of world events.
Music ripping
Your netbook probably doesn’t have a CD-ROM/
DVD drive, so how do you listen to your music 
CD collection? (Even if you do have an external 
drive, it may be almost as big as your netbook, 
which doesn’t make for a very portable music 
solution.)
To take your tunes on the road, you need to rip 
your music CD. This means putting the CD in a 
computer (that has a drive capable of reading 
CDs) and running a program that copies the 
music tracks onto the hard drive, saving them 
in the MP3 file format or another format of your 
choice. When you’re done, copy the files to 
your netbook and listen away.
My favorite Windows CD ripper is a free, 
open-source program called CDex (http://
cdexos.sourceforge.net). It’s been 
around forever but provides everything you 
need. The MP3 format supports a series of tags 
that provide information about the file — such 
as music type, artist, track number, and so on. 
When you rip music with CDex, you need to 
manually enter this information. (You don’t have 
to, but your media player uses the tag informa-
tion to display information when the song plays 
as well as for searching and sorting.)
Just remember to respect the copyright holder 
and not give away copies of the ripped tunes to 
your friends — either in person or over a peer-
to-peer (P2P) network.

127
 Chapter 8: Netbook Fun and Games
 
Figure 8-2:

Try dialing in your netbook to some of the following free Internet radio sites 
or directories of online stations and podcasts. In most cases, it’s just a matter 
of pointing your Web browser to a site, clicking, and then sitting back and 
listening.
 
✓ Live365, www.live365.com
 
✓ Radio Tower, www.radiotower.com
 
✓ Pandora, www.pandora.com
 
✓ SHOUTCast, www.shoutcast.com
 
✓ Radio Locator, www.radio-locator.com
 
✓ BBC Radio, www.bbc.co.uk/radio
 
✓ National Public Radio (NPR), www.npr.org
 
✓ Podcast Directory, www.podcastdirectory.com
 
✓ Podcast Alley, www.podcastalley.com
 
If you’re learning a foreign language, international Internet radio stations are a 
great resource for practicing your listening skills. News programs are a good 
place to start because the broadcasters speak a little more slowly and really 
articulate their words.
 
Remember your netbook’s limited memory and processing speed. If you’re 
working on too many things at once, taxing the memory and processor, your 
music will likely pause and stutter. There’s nothing wrong with your netbook. 
You’re just doing more than it can handle at one time.

128
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Viewing Videos
As the old Buggles song goes, “Video killed the radio star.” Faster processors 
and more memory; high-speed Net connections; compressed video formats; 
peer-to-peer file-sharing networks (legitimately used, of course); and cheap 
DVD drives have made video on computers as common as rain on a picnic.
Your netbook is no exception, especially considering it’s roughly the size of 
a portable DVD player and can serve double duty as a computer and a movie 
viewer. The following sections give you the lowdown on viewing videos on 
your netbook.
DVDs
Even with the advent of high-speed Net connections, a significant number of 
people still watch movies at home or on the road the old-fashioned way — 
with a DVD. And you can certainly do this with your netbook, turning it into 
an inexpensive, personal home theater.
Of course, because your netbook probably doesn’t have a built-in DVD drive, 
you’ll need to buy one. I discuss purchasing external DVD drives in Chapter 14.
After you have that little detail taken care of, you can go to the movies! Here’s 
how:
 
1. Plug in the external DVD drive into one of your netbook’s USB ports — 
your netbook should be powered on, by the way.
 
2. Insert a movie into the DVD drive.
 
3. Watch the movie (as shown in Figure 8-3).
Windows should automatically recognize that a movie has been inserted into 
the drive and will start up Windows Media Player (or whatever your default 
player is) to play it.
 
If Windows Media Player won’t play the DVD, there’s a good chance you’re 
missing a codec that supports DVD viewing (see the “Codec connection” 
sidebar nearby). You can either download the codec you need, or use another 
media player that already has the proper codec — my favorite is VLC, which 
you can download for free at www.videolan.org.
 
Watching a movie on an external DVD drive drains batteries faster than 
normal, so consider keeping your netbook plugged in to an electrical outlet 
during show time if you have the choice.

Most netbooks aren’t up to the task of watching Blu-ray and high-definition 
(HD) movies and streaming TV shows. The little laptops just don’t have the 
graphics horsepower to display the real-as-life videos. Newer netbook models 
are becoming available with faster graphics processors, though. If HD is a big 
deal for you, shop around for a netbook that’s rated (and reviewed) to handle 
high definition.
Ripping movies
If you own a movie on a DVD but don’t have an external DVD player for your 
netbook, it’s still possible to watch the movie on your little laptop. This 
involves a technique known as ripping. Ripping is the process of copying a 
movie from a DVD and then converting it to a compressed file that can be 
stored and played on a computer. (DVD rippers are different from the CD 
rippers I describe in the “Music ripping” sidebar in this chapter — you 
typically need separate programs to rip music and movies.)
 
A movie DVD contains a number of different audio and video files. The 
primary tasks of a ripping program are copying the appropriate files and then 
combining them into a single compressed file that you can watch on your 
computer.
To rip a movie on a DVD, you need the following:
 
✓ A computer with a DVD drive: The faster the processor and more 
memory, the better.

130
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
✓ A ripping program: Free options include Handbrake (http://hand
brake.fr) and AutoGK (www.autogk.me.uk, shown in Figure 8-4). You 
run the ripping program on the computer with a DVD drive. (Even if you 
have an external DVD drive for your netbook, I still recommend ripping 
on a computer with a faster processor and more memory unless you 
want to wait for a very long time.)
 
 Most DVD movies are protected with an encryption scheme to prevent 
piracy. Many DVD-ripping programs attempt to bypass the copy protection 
to create an unprotected file that can be played on any computer. 
However, in some cases, you may not be able to make a copy of a movie 
due to the protection scheme.

When you’ve ripped the movie, copy it to a USB flash drive and then move it 
to your netbook for viewing. You can use Windows Media Player or another 
player — my favorite is VLC, which you can download for free from www.
videolan.org/vlc. If the movie doesn’t play correctly, you’re likely 
missing a codec. See the “Codec connection” sidebar for more information.
 
Ripping copyrighted material for personal use isn’t considered a crime in 
many countries. However, if you rip a movie and give a copy to a friend, that is 
an illegal copyright violation — unless you live in a country that permits it.

 Chapter 8: Netbook Fun and Games
 
There’s a lot more to DVD ripping than I have the space to describe. The best 
place to get all the information is www.doom9.org. There you can find a full 
set of tutorials and various useful programs to download. 
 
Movies ripped by other people are available on the Net, and you can find them 
readily on popular BitTorrent sites. However, in many countries (such as the 
U.S.), downloading these videos is illegal because it violates copyright laws. 
Know the laws in your own country and understand that prohibited down-
loading may result in legal action, a fine, your Internet provider canceling your 
account, or all of the above.
Streaming video
Streaming video is just like streaming audio (check out the earlier “Streaming 
audio” section for a general discussion on streaming) with video data added 
to the audio. You typically don’t need a separate program to watch streaming 
video — just point your Web browser at a site, click, and then sit back and 
start munching some popcorn. (There’s a small chance your Web browser 
may need a plug-in installed before you can view the video.) 
Codec connection
If you rip a movie and it doesn’t play (you get 
sound but no video or video and no sound), 
there’s a good chance an associated codec isn’t 
present on your netbook. A codec (which stands 
for coder-decoder or compressor-decompres-
sor) is a program (or file with instructions for 
a program) that compresses or decompresses 
digital audio and video. Depending on how the 
video was encoded, you may need to install a 
specific codec to view it.
One of the most common file extensions for 
ripped movies is AVI (Audio Video Interleave). 
An AVI file is a container that can store 
different types of encoded videos — such as 
DivX or Xvid formats. Although most media 
players can play AVI files, if the appropriate 
codec hasn’t been installed (for example, one 
that decodes an Xvid video), you won’t be able 
to watch the movie.
If you have an Internet connection, some media 
players will attempt to download and install the 
required codec. The easiest solution is to down-
load the K-Lite Codec Pack from http://
codecguide.com. This is a free collection 
of just about every codec you’ll ever need to 
watch videos — currently around 15MB in size. 
Follow the instructions for installing the latest 
version of the pack, restart your media player, 
and then break out the popcorn and enjoy the 
movie. 

132
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
The Net has lots of streaming video content these days, but here is a collection 
of Web sites I recommend for getting your video fix:
 
✓ YouTube: (www.youtube.com) This is the original “anyone can be 
a filmmaker, post your own videos” site. Aside from all the amateur 
content, some of which is pretty good, YouTube has started to add TV 
shows and movies in a new Shows section.
 
✓ Hulu: (www.hulu.com) This Web site provides commercial-supported 
streaming video of TV shows and movies from NBC, Fox, and other 
networks and studios. (Figure 8-5 shows Hulu in action.)
 
✓ Joost: (www.joost.com)An innovative Internet TV service from the 
founders of Kazaa and Skype.
 
✓ Crackle: (www.crackle.com) A Sony Pictures Entertainment site 
featuring free movies and TV shows.
 
✓ Netflix: (www.netflix.com) If you have a Netflix account, don’t forget 
you can view a number of movies online in addition to getting DVDs 
through the mail.
 
✓ Surf the Channel: (www.surfthechannel.com) This site doesn’t 
stream TV shows but is a search engine for finding sites that do stream 
your favorite shows. 
 
✓ TV.com: (www.tv.com) This CBS-owned Web site is starting to offer 
streaming videos similar to content on Hulu.
 
Figure 8-5: 
You can 
watch 
old TV 
shows on 
a netbook 
with Hulu. 
Everybody 
needs a vice 
(specifically, 
a Miami 
Vice) or two.
 
 
If you’re a TV junkie, many networks are offering streaming videos of their shows 
directly from their main corporate Web sites — for example, www.nbc.com.

133
 Chapter 8: Netbook Fun and Games
Instead of using a Net connection to watch TV, you can go retro and pluck 
television signals from the airwaves and view shows on your netbook. I 
discuss TV tuners in Chapter 15.
 
Both Hulu and YouTube Shows currently restrict viewing to computers in the 
United States. With a little technical know-how and a proxy server, it’s possible 
for international viewers to watch U.S. only video content. Use Google to find 
out more.
 
Some Internet providers are starting to charge by the amount of bandwidth 
used. That means you can upload and download only a fixed number of 
gigabytes each month based on a subscription level. If you exceed the 
amount, you pay more. (This is similar to cell phone plans where you have a 
set number of minutes.) If your Net provider is metering your service, keep in 
mind streaming video can consume a lot of bandwidth.
Flash dance
This section is about streaming video, but this 
sidebar isn’t a link to the old Jennifer Beals 
movie — sorry. Instead, I want to talk a little 
about Flash Video. Quite a lot of the video 
you watch on the Net these days is delivered 
in Flash Video (FLV) format — YouTube is an 
example. Most Web browsers come with an 
Adobe Flash Player plug-in, which allows you 
to watch a video inside your browser.
The Web server streams the video, and Flash 
Player saves incoming video data (buffering) 
and plays it. If you’ve ever had a video abruptly 
stop and then restart, it’s because the player is 
waiting for more data to continue; otherwise, 
enough of the video hasn’t been buffered yet.
Most streaming video Web sites don’t offer 
you an option of saving the video to your hard 
drive. If you want to watch it again, you need 
to connect to the Net and revisit the Web site. 
However, because of the way Flash Video 
works, you can save video from some sites 
directly to your netbook.
The Flash Player creates a temporary file as 
the video is streamed. It’s possible to rename 
this file and have a video you can open and 
watch whenever you like. A number of Web 
sites make this process simple — you can do a 
Google search for YouTube flv to find some such 
sites. You supply a link to a video (such as from 
YouTube), and the Web site saves the FLV file to 
your hard drive.
Another approach to saving Flash videos is 
to use a browser add-on program — I like 
DownloadHelp for Firefox. With these add-
ons, whenever a Flash video is shown in your 
browser, you can click a menu item to save the 
file. Check your browser’s add-on page to find 
an FLV utility — for Firefox, go to https://
addons.mozilla.org.
Web sites that offer commercial videos (such as 
Hulu.com) stream Flash in a way that a tempo-
rary file isn’t saved to disk — mostly as a form 
of copy protection. In these cases, you’re out of 
luck if you want to save a video. A few products 
on the market claim to be able to save protected 
videos, but new protection schemes are then 
quickly introduced to thwart the programs.

134
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Shall We Play a Game?
I need to talk to you about games. I don’t mean Solitaire and Minesweeper, 
but action games like Crysis, Half-Life 2, or Counter-Strike: Source. If these 
names don’t ring a bell, consider this section optional reading.
If you just got a netbook and are a gamer, you’re probably dying to load up 
your favorite games and start playing. But hold your horses: You need to 
know a few things before you can start blasting away with your plasma rifle.
 
Bonus points if you can name the movie this section heading refers to. Give 
up? It’s War Games (1983), starring Matthew Broderick as a student who saves 
the world from a war-gaming super-computer. It was actually nominated for a 
couple of Academy Awards and was one of the first hacker flicks to come out 
of Hollywood.
Netbook limitations
First off, a netbook is not a game machine. Yes, it’s a computer and runs 
Windows, so it should theoretically run popular Windows games. But there 
are five things going against a netbook when it comes to playing games.
 
These limitations apply to graphics-intensive, 3-D commercial games or 
multiplayer Internet games. A netbook can easily handle less-resource-
intensive games like Tetris, Solitaire, and other popular time wasters.
The five limitations are
 
✓ Screen size: A 10-inch (or less) screen just doesn’t cut it with some 
games — either in terms of usability or game requirements; for example, 
some games require 1024 x 768 resolution. There’s not much you can do 
about this without hooking up an external monitor.
 
✓ Processor: The Atom processor isn’t what you’d call a rocket ship, and 
you’ll experience considerable lag on some games compared with 
playing games on laptops or desktop PCs equipped with faster chips.
 
 The more the chip has to work, the hotter the netbook gets. I’ve found 
some games can get a netbook case uncomfortably warm when it’s 
perched on my lap.
 
✓ Graphics chipset: This is the biggest stumbling block for playing 
modern 3-D games. Many best selling computer games require a cutting-
edge graphics card that supports 3-D animation to present realistic 
video. Currently, most netbooks have graphics chipsets more suitable 
for business or basic home PCs, not full-on game computers — a few are 
starting to appear with decent graphics processors, though.

135
 Chapter 8: Netbook Fun and Games
 
✓ Memory: The more memory the better, and although netbooks sporting 
1 or 2GB of RAM are usable, more is always preferred — but you’re stuck 
due to Microsoft’s licensing stipulation that states netbooks running XP 
can have a maximum of 2GB of RAM. The same limitation will likely exist 
with Windows 7.
 
✓ CD/DVD player: If you don’t have an external DVD drive to install the 
game, you’re stuck.
 
It’s sometimes possible to get around a missing DVD drive with a little trickery. 
On a PC with a DVD player, use a DVD copy program to create an ISO image 
of the entire DVD. Copy the ISO file to your netbook’s hard drive and then use 
version 3.47 of Daemon Tools (www.oldversion.com/Daemon-Tools.
html) to mount the ISO file. Daemon Tools emulates a CD-ROM drive, and 
the installer will think you have an optical drive and that the game DVD is 
inserted.
It might seem like I’ve painted a bleak picture for gaming on a netbook. You 
really need to accept a netbook’s hardware limitations and try not to turn the 
little laptop into something that it’s not.
Don’t give up hope, though. Lots of games can run on a netbook. For example, 
if you have any older games lying around the house gathering dust like 
Half-Life 2, Starcraft, and Diablo, give them a try. A screen from the original 
Call of Duty is shown in Figure 8-6. On most netbooks, the oldie-but-goodie 
games run fine, and because you probably haven’t played them in awhile, it 
will be just like getting a new game — with a bit of déjà vu.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Older games 
like Call of 
Duty work 
fine on most 
netbooks.
 

136
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Internet resources for netbook gamers
Instead of playing test pilot (or crash-test dummy as the case may be) and 
spending a bunch of time seeing whether a favorite game works on your 
netbook, I suggest you save possible frustration and first check whether 
anyone else has had success. The Internet is perfect for this, and the 
resources that I mention in this section can help.
 
Because of the hardware similarities among netbooks, if someone reports 
having success getting a game to play on one particular brand and model of 
netbook, there’s a pretty good chance it will work on a different brand, too. In 
other words, if you have an Acer netbook, don’t immediately think because I 
list an ASUS Web site here that it doesn’t provide useful information.
 
✓ Gameeer.com: (www.bourdeaux.net/eeepc) The ASUS Eee PC site 
has an extensive list of games that work and don’t work on an Eee PC 
900 20G running Windows XP. 
 
✓ EeeUser.com Forum: (http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewforum.
php?id=28) Check the gaming section of this popular Eee PC user 
forum for an extensive list of games — as well as tips and hints for 
getting games working. 
 
✓ Acer Aspire One User Forums: (www.aspireoneuser.com/forum/
viewforum.php?f=21) This site has a game-related forum for Acer 
users. 
 
✓ MyDellMini Forums: (http://mydellmini.com/forum/list-of-
games-that-play-on-the-mini-t639.html) Here you find a list of 
games that work, don’t work, or sort of work on Dell Minis. 
 
✓ Freeware Windows XP games: (http://home.comcast.
net/~SupportCD/XPGames.html) You can find many Windows 
XP–compatible games out there, including some very good free ones. 
Although I can’t promise that all the games listed on this Web site will 
work with every model of netbook, it’s still a worthwhile reference.

Chapter 9
Better Safe than Sorry: Security
In This Chapter
▶ Vanquishing viruses
▶ Stopping spyware
▶ Focusing on firewalls
▶ Engaging encryption
▶ Considering Kensington locks
T
his chapter is about netbook security. “Ho, hum,” you probably say. 
“He’s going to rehash all that stuff I’ve already heard about scary viruses, 
programs called firewalls, and other things that frankly I find boring.”
Actually I’m not. After spending a whole lot of years advising corporations, 
organizations, and government agencies on computer security, I’m tired of 
using fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) to get people to adopt more secure 
computing practices. So I’m not telling you evil-hacker, boogieman stories 
or top-ten reasons why you should use security software. You’re already 
bombarded with enough of that stuff in the media as it is.
Instead, how about if I treat you like a grown-up who’s going to make his or 
her own decisions about how much and what types of security to use? No 
scolding, threats, or browbeating. Sound like a deal? If so, great, because in 
this chapter, I dispense with the hype and boil down what you need to know 
about basic netbook security practices, including antivirus software, spyware 
detection programs, personal firewalls, encryption, and locks for physically 
securing your netbook. You might even find out something new, so read on.

138
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Keeping Viruses at Bay
Brush your teeth after meals, clean your plate, wear clean underwear, and 
always run antivirus software. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I said I wasn’t going to be 
your mother when it comes to computer security, and I mean it.
You already know about viruses and that you should be running some kind of 
antivirus program — especially if you have a Windows netbook. Little laptops 
running Linux are much more immune to getting bad infections.
Glossary of gotchas
Here’s a collection of computer-security terms 
you may have read or heard about. I’m guessing 
you’re aware of at least half of them. If you 
recognize more than that, give yourself a gold 
star for being security savvy:
 ✓ Adware: A program that displays advertise-
ments after the software has been installed 
or while it’s being used — typically without 
your knowledge or permission.
 ✓ Botnet: As in robot network. A collection of 
zombie computers (see zombie in this list) 
that’s used for malicious purposes such 
as spamming or denial of service attacks 
(where a Web site is bombarded with 
traffic, preventing use).
 ✓ Malware: As in malicious software. A term 
that encompasses Trojan horses, viruses, 
worms, and other software meant to harm 
you or your computer.
 ✓ Rootkit: A program or collection of programs 
designed to hide the fact that someone 
has broken into a computer. For example, 
certain system files that could reveal that a 
computer has been compromised might be 
replaced by rootkit files to hide the attack or 
provide a backdoor for future unauthorized 
access.
 ✓ Spyware: A program installed on a 
computer without your knowledge to 
covertly collect information on you, your 
computer, or how you use the computer.
 ✓ Trojan horse: Just like in the old Greek 
story, a program pretends to be something 
else while concealing a more nefarious 
purpose — in other words, beware of geeks 
bearing gifts.
 ✓ Virus: An up-to-no-good program that 
can copy itself and infect your computer 
without your knowing about it.
 ✓ Worm: A self-replicating program that 
sends copies of itself to other computers 
on a network. Unlike a virus, worms don’t 
attach themselves to a program but still 
perform varying degrees of mischief.
 ✓ Zombie: A computer that is secretly under 
the remote control of someone else — 
again, typically for malicious purposes.

139
 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
Let me start by saying that many netbooks come with trial subscriptions of 
commercial security products. These programs provide you with updated 
virus and malware protection for a set period of time and then require you 
to purchase the services after the initial trial (or future subscription period) 
ends. It’s usually a fairly nominal fee, and many computer users automatically 
break out the credit card for peace of mind.
That’s your choice, but personally I’m not overly enamored with these 
security suites. They tend to be big and consume a bunch of memory and 
processor cycles — both of which are at a premium in a netbook.
If you don’t feel like shelling out hard-earned bucks after a trial period, or 
if you don’t appreciate the system performance slowdowns security suites 
often cause, or if your netbook doesn’t come preinstalled with antivirus 
software, here’s what I suggest: There are three free Windows programs 
that provide you with real-time virus protection — the software runs in the 
background and is always on the lookout for viruses. These programs all 
offer basic virus protection, and you can get for-pay versions of the programs 
with more advanced features. Coincidentally, all the software names start 
with the letter A:
 
✓ avast!: (www.avast.com) avast! is a very popular, free antivirus program 
that hails from the Czech Republic. It first came out in 1988, and as of 
the spring of 2009, it has over 50 million registered users worldwide. 
The software has a number of different features that protect you from 
all sorts of malicious threats. Download the free version and get more 
information at the avast! Web site.
 
✓ AVG: (http://free.grisoft.com) AVG is another widely used 
antivirus application from the former Czechoslovakia. (Do the Czechs 
know viruses or what?) avast! has a few more features and a cleaner 
interface in my opinion. 
 
✓ AntiVir: (www.avira.com) No, not another Czech security program. 
This one is from German company Avira and is well-suited for netbooks 
because of its low system requirements — it also gets good marks from 
users and reviewers.
I recommend downloading and evaluating all of these programs to see which 
one works best for you.
The three free antivirus programs I mention in the preceding section certainly 
aren’t the only game in town. You can also find a slew of other commercial and 
free alternatives. Even Microsoft is aiming to get into the free antivirus game — 
the Redmond giant has announced a product tentatively called Microsoft 
Security Essentials, which will likely be available by the time you read this.

140
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Instead of giving you a laundry list of software, I suggest you check out some 
independent online resources that list and rate antivirus packages. That way 
you can pick a solution that you like the best. My top information sources are
 
✓ Virus Bulletin, www.virusbtn.com/index
 
✓ AV.Test, http://av-test.org
 
✓ AV Comparatives, www.av-comparatives.org
Your netbook’s startup time increases when you use antivirus software that 
provides real-time protection. More system resources are also used because 
the program is always running. An alternative is to use the open-source 
ClamAV utility (www.clamav.net). ClamAV searches for viruses and Trojan 
horses only when you run the program (which means no real-time protection). 
If you have a low risk of picking up a virus, use this program to scan your 
drive every week or so to check for infections.
Online antidotes
Viruses, Trojan horses, and other related ilk 
have grown considerably more sophisticated 
over the years. A good virus (good for the virus 
writer, bad for you) can detect that antivirus and 
other security applications are running and then 
attempt to circumvent the good-guy programs.
If you think your netbook is infected with a virus 
that has somehow managed to beat your security 
software, don’t panic. Several free virus 
utilities can work over the Internet through 
your Web browser. They can detect and often 
remove any nasties that may have breached 
your defenses. Point your browser to one 
of the services listed here and follow the 
instructions:
 ✓ TrendMicro HouseCall, http://house
call.antivirus.com/
 ✓ Symantec SecurityCheck, http://
security.symantec.com/
 ✓ McAfee Virusscan Online, http://
us.mcafee.com/root/mfs/
default.asp
An online antivirus program should never 
replace its standalone cousin because it doesn’t 
perform real-time scanning and it requires a Net 
connection. However, it’s a great supplementary 
security tool and is perfect if you ever need 
to provide technical support over the phone 
to a friend or family member who is suffering 
from mysterious netbook problems that may be 
virus-related.
The main downsides to these online antidotes 
are they can be a bit slow and some services 
run only with Internet Explorer.

141
 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
Zapping Spyware
If you didn’t read the “Glossary of gotchas” sidebar near the beginning of 
this chapter, spyware is a general term that relates to any ill-intentioned, 
eavesdropping program or file that is installed on your PC without your 
knowledge. Spyware is designed to take control or monitor your computer — 
without your permission.
Spyware can be covertly installed on your computer when you run a program 
or visit a Web site. It’s very pervasive these days (especially targeted at 
Windows PCs), but the good news is that a number of free and commercial 
utilities can detect and remove unwanted snooping pests. The following 
sections discuss several free ones.
Call me paranoid, but I have all three of the following programs installed on 
my netbook. In the past, there have been times when I’ve found that one 
utility can detect and deal with something malicious that the others missed.
Ad-Aware Free
Ad-Aware Free started out as a utility for alerting users to advertising Web 
sites that were secretly tracking your visits. Since then, the program has 
evolved into a complete spyware detection and removal tool. It identifies 
dialers (programs that make long distance phone calls and you get the bill), 
Trojan horses, keyloggers (programs that monitor what keys you press), 
browser hijackers, and other privacy-violating malware. For more information 
and to download the program, visit www.lavasoft.com.
Spybot-S&D
Spybot-S&D (for Search and Destroy) is the granddaddy of spyware detection 
and removal programs. Although it’s been around forever, it’s still a valuable 
tool to have in your protection arsenal. You can find out about it at www.
safer-networking.org.
CCleaner
CCleaner (the first C stands for Crap) really isn’t a dedicated spyware detector 
per se. Instead, it cleans up temporary files, browser histories, cookies, and 
unused registry entries. Although spyware can hide data in some of these 
places, CCleaner is even more indispensable on a netbook with a small drive 
because it gets rid of unneeded files that take up valuable space. To download 
the utility, go to www.ccleaner.com.

142
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Focusing on Firewalls
Most home and business computer users connect to the Internet through 
routers and switches. In addition to allowing multiple computers to share to 
a single Internet connection (DSL, cable, T1 line, and so on), these hardware 
devices also serve as firewalls to the Internet — keeping you safe from 
hackers trying to break into your computer.
But what about when you connect to the Internet with your netbook in a 
coffee shop, park, fast food restaurant, or other place? Heck, you have no 
idea how secure the hotspot connection is and what security measures are 
being used. Me, I don’t like cowering in fear when I use my netbook, so a 
software firewall is always running when I’m on the Net on the road.
Firewall programs (often called personal firewalls) control network traffic 
coming into and going out of your computer. You permit or deny certain 
types of traffic based on rules you establish — for example, you could 
create a rule that allows incoming and outgoing Internet traffic for your Web 
browser. If network traffic occurs that doesn’t conform to a rule, the firewall 
notifies you, and you have the option of blocking the connection.
Even if you’re protected by a hardware firewall such as a router or switch, it’s 
cheap insurance to run firewall software. Besides being a redundant system, 
firewall software packages often include additional security features to help 
you keep the bad guys out.
What firewall would I recommend? I’m glad you asked.
Windows Firewall
Windows XP comes preinstalled with a firewall. The problem is this firewall 
is a little like using Paint — it’s free, comes with a computer, and has limited 
functionality. What I don’t like about the Windows firewall is it doesn’t 
identify or allow you to control outbound connections. That means if a 
malware program somehow gets onto your netbook and tries to covertly 
phone home (connect to a server over the Internet to send eavesdropped or 
stolen data), the Windows firewall isn’t going to alert you. This is not a good 
thing, especially because just about every commercial and free firewall program 
lets you set up rules for allowing and disallowing outgoing Net connections.
If you’re using the Windows firewall, I suggest you download and install one 
of the alternative programs I list in the following section and then turn off the 
Microsoft firewall and let the other firewall assume guard duty.

143
 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
The firewalls that come with Vista and Windows 7 protect you against 
potentially harmful outbound connections and include a number of more 
advanced features. In other words, if you’re running Vista or Windows 7 on a 
netbook, you should be fine with the default firewall.
Firewall alternatives
If you want a more substantial firewall than the one that comes with Windows 
XP, and I recommend that you should, you have many choices. The market is 
filled with free and commercial offerings.
Your netbook may have a trial version of a security suite that comes with a 
firewall. If you read the previous section on antivirus software, you know I’m 
not a big fan of security suites because they tend to eat up system resources 
like memory and processor cycles. Instead, I recommend an à la carte 
approach, using individual security programs of your own choosing,
By now, you should have a pretty good idea that I’m value-minded — or a 
cheapskate, take your pick. Considering that, here are three free firewall 
programs you should consider:
 
✓ Comodo Internet Security, http://personalfirewall.comodo.com
 
✓ PC Tools Firewall Plus, www.pctools.com/firewall
 
✓ Online Armor Personal Firewall, www.tallemu.com/free-fire
wall-protection-software.html
After you’ve installed a personal firewall, it needs a little training. That means 
a dialog box will pop up every now and then, asking whether it’s all right that 
a program you’re running is connecting to the Internet. This is normal, and 
your responses teach the firewall each time so it won’t be constantly bugging 
you. If you want to get advanced, you can also create a list of rules for the 
firewall to allow or disallow certain programs or connections via certain 
ports (with network protocols). An example of this is shown in Figure 9-1 
with the Comodo firewall.
PC pioneer Steve Gibson offers a free Web service called ShieldsUP! that tests 
how much protection your current firewall and security configuration pro-
vide against Net no-good-niks. Check it out at www.grc.com.

Evading Evil (with Encryption)
One of the biggest benefits of a netbook is also one of its main vulnerabilities. 
Because a netbook is so small and light, it’s easy for someone to snatch it if 
you leave the laptop unattended or if you aren’t paying attention. Plus, its 
diminutive dimensions put the netbook at risk for accidental loss. It’s not 
as bad as a cell phone, but you can still easily slip it out of a bag or leave it 
behind at the local coffee shop.
If one day your netbook disappears, never to be seen again, you’ll be out the 
replacement cost. But a bigger concern is what’s on your netbook — you do 
back it up on a regular basis, don’t you?
Windows firewalls rated
My favorite resource for making sense of the 
large number of free and commercial Windows 
firewalls on the market is Matousec, an 
independent security firm that provides firewall 
ratings. Matousec cuts through the advertising 
hype, applying a set of rigorous tests to see 
which firewalls cut the mustard — and which

 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
Aside from backing up the Great American Novel you’re working on and your 
favorite MP3s, you should think about backing up any personal or financial 
information that resides on your netbook. Identity theft is a big deal, and if 
you have any files that contain your Social Security number, credit card 
numbers, or other sensitive and personal information, there’s always a 
chance it could fall into less-than-honest hands. (Okay, I promised not to tell 
any scary stories, but I just couldn’t help myself.)
Even using a password when Windows starts up may not keep files safe from 
prying eyes. If someone with basic hacking skills has physical access to any 
password-protected Windows netbook, there’s a good chance he or she will 
be able to defeat the login security and get at the files.
Most netbooks don’t enable Windows startup password protection by 
default. To turn it on, in the Windows Control Panel select User Accounts. 
A somewhat more secure way of password protecting a netbook is to use a 
BIOS password, which I discuss in Chapter 21.
The way to protect critical documents is with encryption. In simple terms, 
encryption means employing a program that scrambles the contents of a 
file so only a person who knows an associated password can access the 
information. I spend a little time telling you about one of my favorite 
Windows encryption programs. It’s called TrueCrypt, and it’s a powerful 
(and free) way to keep your files safe.
Finding out about TrueCrypt
TrueCrypt is a free, open-source program that allows you to secure your files. 
This is industrial-strength encryption that even those three-letter-acronym 
government spy organizations would have difficulty cracking.
Before launching into specifics, you should know the two types of encryption 
programs:
 
✓ File encryption: An individual file is scrambled. (See the “File locker” 
sidebar.)
 
✓ Disk encryption: An entire volume is scrambled.
TrueCrypt is a disk encryption program. You can use it three different ways:
 
✓ Create an encrypted virtual volume — a file container that can be 
mounted and used like a storage device (such as a USB flash memory 
drive or hard drive). 
 
✓ Encrypt an entire partition or storage device.
 
✓ Encrypt a system disk partition or volume where Windows is installed.

146
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
In the following sections, I cover creating and using encrypted virtual 
volumes. Because many people don’t know about TrueCrypt, I go into step-
by-step detail on a few of the basics. Read the documentation that comes 
with the program (you can download it from www.truecrypt.org) to find 
out how to encrypt partitions and use other advanced TrueCrypt features.
Creating a TrueCrypt volume
First, download and install TrueCrypt. Versions are available for Windows, 
Linux, and the Mac, so no matter what operating system your netbook is 
running, you should be able to use the program.
Here’s all you have to do:
 
1. Run TrueCrypt.
 
2. Click the Create Volume button.
 
 This starts the TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard.
 
3. Make sure the Create a File Container radio button is selected and 
click Next.
 
4. Select the Standard TrueCrypt Volume radio button and click Next.
File locker
I recommend using file encryption anytime 
you’re storing sensitive files on the Internet. 
Although online storage sites may tout strong 
security procedures, you should shoulder the 
ultimate responsibility for your own file security. 
In addition, you may want to use file encryption 
if you have only a few sensitive files on your 
netbook and don’t need a disk encryption 
solution like TrueCrypt.
When it comes to file encryption, I recommend 
giving potential snoopers the axe — the 
AxCrypt, to be precise.
AxCrypt is an easy-to-use shareware encryption 
program. It integrates with Windows Explorer, 
so it’s simply a matter of right-clicking on a file 
and selecting Encrypt from the AxCrypt context 
menu. Enter a password or passphrase and 
voilà, the file is encrypted. (Use the reverse 
procedure to decrypt a file.)
You can download AxCrypt from www.ax
antum.com/AxCrypt.
The University of Delaware has a simple tutorial 
if you’d like to find out more: www.udel.edu/
pnpi/tools/encrypt/win/axcrypt/
index.html.

 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
 
5. Click the Select File button.
 
6. Create a file container, specifying the filename and location. Click 
Next to continue.
 
7. Select the encryption and hash algorithm types and click Next. 
(See Figure 9-2.)
 
Figure 9-2: 
Specify the 
encryption 
algorithm 
when cre-
ating a 
TrueCrypt 
volume.
 
 
 TrueCrypt supports a number of different encryption algorithms. The 
default is AES, a strong encryption method standardized by the U.S. 
government. The default hash algorithm is RIPEMD-160. Use the default 
settings — unless you’re a techie and have a good reason not to. You can 
find out more about these algorithms by clicking the information links in 
the dialog box.
 
8. Enter the size of the file container and click Next.
 
 Make sure the container size will be big enough to store all the files you 
want to encrypt. You can specify a size in either K (kilobytes) or MB 
(megabytes).
 
9. Enter a password (twice for confirmation) and click Next.
 
 Use a strong password when creating a TrueCrypt volume. A weak pass-
word (such as one that is easy to guess, short in length, or contains only 
alphabetic characters in the same case) can render a strong encryption 
algorithm useless. Your password should be a combination of numbers, 
letters, and punctuation marks — the longer and harder to guess, the 
better. Combine multiple words or use an easy-to-remember phrase.

148
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
10. Enter information about the volume format and then click Format 
button.
 
 You can use the default settings. Move the mouse randomly inside the 
dialog box to generate random numbers for the encryption algorithm 
to use.
 
 A window informs you that the volume has successfully been created. 
 
11. Click Exit to return to the main TrueCrypt user interface.
 
 You’re now ready to add files you want to encrypt to the volume you just 
created.
Opening a TrueCrypt volume
Before you can copy files to an encrypted TrueCrypt volume or access files 
that you have stored in that volume, you need to open the volume. Here’s how:
 
1. Run TrueCrypt.
 
2. In the large text box, select a free volume letter.
 
 Such as X:, Y:, or Z:.
 
3. Click the Select File button.
 
4. Choose the file container you previously created and click Open.
 
5. Click the Mount button.
 
6. Enter the password you associated with the volume and click OK.
 
 Information about the volume now appears in the list. For example, 
if you selected Z: as the volume, the file container name, size and 
encryption algorithm appear next to Z: (as shown in Figure 9-3).
 
 TrueCrypt interacts with the operating system and Windows treats the 
file container just like a folder or hard drive.
Accessing files in a TrueCrypt volume
After you’ve opened and mounted a TrueCrypt volume, it behaves exactly like 
a hard drive or USB flash drive does under Windows (as shown in Figure 9-4):
 
✓ In Explorer (right click Start and select Explore), drag and drop files to 
copy or move them to and from the volume.
 
✓ Double-click a file on the encrypted volume to open it.
 
✓ From inside a program, access a file with the Open command in the File 
menu.

149
 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
As long as a TrueCrypt volume is mounted, it’s business as usual when it 
comes to accessing files.
 
Figure 9-3: 
A TrueCrypt 
file 
container

volume Z:.
 
 
Figure 9-4: 
A mounted 
TrueCrypt 
volume is 
just like 
any other 
Windows 
volume 
when you’re 
working 
with files.
 
Be sure to delete the original file after you copy it to the TrueCrypt volume. 
If you don’t, theoretically, someone could access the original, unencrypted 
version.
Technically speaking, even after you move a file into the Windows Recycle Bin 
and empty it, the file still exists on the hard drive. Some file recovery programs 
can restore the contents of a deleted file. To eliminate this vulnerability, use a 
secure erasing program — my favorite is Eraser, which you can download for 

150
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
free at www.heidi.ie/eraser. These programs overwrite the contents of 
files before they’re deleted. If someone uses a file-recovery utility on a securely 
erased file, he’s out of luck in viewing the original contents.
Closing a TrueCrypt volume
When you’re finished accessing files in the encrypted volume, it’s time to 
lock them up. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Make sure all files in the volume you’ve been working with are closed.
 
2. Select the volume you want to close in the TrueCrypt volume list.
 
3. Click the Dismount button.
This closes the volume — file container information no longer appears next to 
the volume letter. In addition, this volume is no longer available to Windows.
The only way anyone can access the documents in the file container is if he 
runs TrueCrypt, selects the container file, and mounts it with the correct 
password. This means if your netbook takes a hike, either accidentally or 
with a thief, you don’t have to worry about any sensitive documents falling 
into the wrong hands.
Keying in on Kensington Locks
Most laptop cases, and netbooks are no exception, have a small slot molded 
into the side or back for attaching a security cable. The idea is you can 
secure your computer to some big, relatively immovable object (desk, table, 
chair, fence, park bench, and so on), so if you temporarily need to leave your 
netbook unattended, it will be there when you get back. Here’s the scoop on 
this antitheft system.
The Kensington Security Slot has been around since 1990. Kensington Computer 
Products, which makes accessories for computers, sold a group of computer 
manufacturers on the idea of providing a simple way of securing laptops, moni-
tors, desktop PCs and other electronic equipment. By incorporating a small, 
metal-backed slot in the case design, security-conscious users could purchase a 
patented cable lock from Kensington. “That makes sense,” the manufacturers said 
because adding a slot wouldn’t be a big expense. And thus a standard was born.
Kensington locks (one is shown in Figure 9-5) feature a plastic-coated cable 
with a lock on one end and a loop on the other. The lock is simple to use.
 
1. Find some difficult-to-move object (park bench, table, pipe, Congress, 
and so on).

151
 Chapter 9: Better Safe than Sorry: Security
 
2. Thread the lock end of the cable through the loop end and secure the 
cable to the object.
 
 Just make sure the cable can’t be easily slipped off whatever you attach 
it to. Don’t do something like secure the cable to a table leg if the table 
could be easily lifted and the loop slid down the leg.
 
3. Insert the lock end into your netbook’s security slot.
 
4. Lock it up.
That’s it. You can now wander off, safe in the knowledge that your netbook is 
secure — however, be sure to read the “Pros and cons” sidebar.
Kensington offers several different models, featuring two types of locks: one 
that uses a key and another that employs a combination lock. If you shop 
around, expect to pay around $40 for a Kensington lock.
Other manufacturers make similar locks, but Kensington models tend to get 
the highest user ratings.

Pros and cons
I know a guy who happens to know a guy who 
knows a guy who knows a thing or two about 
locks. Let’s just say he’s been locked up a time 
or two for getting caught doing things to locks 
he shouldn’t have. His name is Spike, and I 
recently paid him a visit to get his professional 
opinion on Kensington-type lock systems. 
Here’s what he had to say.
“Let me put it this way. And I’m just talking 
in theoretical terms, okay? Certainly not 
from practical experience. There are three 
weaknesses to these kinds of locks.
“First, the computer case. It’s plastic right? 
You don’t have to be a gorilla like me to grab a 
locked-up laptop, start yanking on the computer 
really hard, and rip the lock out of the case. Yeah 
it may leave a big, jagged hole, but you just tell 
people it’s a manufacturer’s defect, which is the 
reason you’re selling it so cheap. Heh, heh.
“Number two, the cable. If the bad guy has 
the time and not too many people are around, 
he can just whip out a little pocket saw. You 
want the thickest cable available to slow down 
cutting.
“And last, the lock. You have your choice of a 
tubular lock or a combination lock. Some people 
think because I bench press 300 pounds, I’m a 
brute force kind of guy. Au contraire. I prefer 
finesse over muscle, and some of these locks 
are very easy to defeat by manipulation. You 
don’t believe me? Try searching YouTube for 
Kensington lock. The proof is in the videos. 
Word on the street is the lock company made 
some improvements, but I can’t personally 
vouch for that.
“I want to say one more thing before time is 
up and I need to go back to my cell, uh, I mean 
temporary domicile. This kind of lock works 
great for keeping honest people honest — 
seeing an unattended netbook securely cabled 
to a table greatly reduces the temptation of 
someone walking by, picking it up, and strolling 
away with it. But if it were me, I would never 
leave my netbook all by its lonesome — locked 
up or not. Well, got to go now, pal. Enjoy life on 
the outside; I’ll look you up in a couple years.”

T
he bring-anywhere, do-anything nature of a netbook makes it ideal for 
a number of popular Internet social networking and communication 
services. Wherever there’s a Wi-Fi connection, you can use your netbook to 
stay in touch with friends, family, and co-workers — and I’m not talking about 
e-mail. E-mail is so old school.
Using the Internet as a foundation, many innovative ways of communicat-
ing electronically have appeared. Social networking sites such as Twitter, 
MySpace, and Facebook and programs like Skype and instant messaging cli-
ents have all redefined how people interact.
This new generation of communication tools is especially well suited to net-
books, and if you’re not already using some of these Web sites and programs, 
it’s worthwhile to find out more.
In this chapter, I tell you what you need to know about these tools so you 
can try them out. I provide a general introduction, how to get started using 
them, and where to go for more information. (If you’re an experienced social 
networker, feel free to skim this chapter. You never know though — you might 
find out something new.)

Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Of Twitter and Tweets
Twitter is all over the news these days. It’s the latest hot Internet-related 
thing. Oprah tweets with celebs (it took awhile, but she finally figured it out), 
the CDC tweets about flu, Lance Armstrong tweets about training and bike 
racing, and everyday people tweet about everyday stuff. Just what’s up with 
all this tweeting and exactly what is Twitter?
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a free microblogging Web site — it’s been 
around since 2006. You probably already know about blogging — Web logging, 
where someone posts an online journal. Twitter is the same idea except a 
posted message can be no more than 140 characters — these posts are called 
tweets. People, known as followers, subscribe to tweets. You have the option 
of limiting who your tweets go out to (such as friends and family who sub-
scribe), or you can open up subscriptions to anyone.
People seem to either love Twitter or hate it. The service’s critics view the 
majority of tweets as time wasting, ego-driven, stream-of-conscious ramblings. 
Twitter fans argue that the service is a valid form of modern-day expression 
and communication and good tweets are informational and useful — in addi-
tion, following some of the less-useful tweets is a nice diversion from reality.
I say give Twitter a try and then make up your own mind. The following sec-
tions cover some basics to get you started.
Social networking defined
You hear the term social networking used quite 
a bit these days, but what exactly is it? Social 
networking refers to Internet services that are 
used to build online communities. These com-
munities consist of people who share similar 
interests or activities. Social networking Web 
sites provide a way for people to interact — 
through forums, e-mail, instant messaging, and 
blogs.
Social networking isn’t new and can be traced 
back to bulletin board services (BBSs), USENET 
(Internet newsgroups), and e-mail listservs — 
all of which emerged in the 1970s and ’80s. 
However, it wasn’t until the World Wide Web 
took off in the 1990s that social networking 
really blossomed. Web sites such as Geocities, 
Tripod, and Classmates.com were early pio-
neers, followed by hugely successful sites 
including MySpace, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
Social networking is often associated with 
Web 2.0 — another buzzword that refers to the 
next generation of Web site development and 
design. Whereas first-generation Web sites 
mainly provided information, Web 2.0 is all 
about communication, facilitation, sharing, and 
collaboration.

155
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
 
Before you can subscribe to tweets or have your own adoring followers, you 
need to sign up for a free Twitter account. It’s painless, and you can do so at 
www.twitter.com. Pick a simple name that’s similar to your own, upload a 
picture of yourself (or something cool), fill in the bio, and you’re ready to go.
Following tweets
The best way to get a taste of Twitter is to play follow the leader. In this case, 
you’ll be following (reading) someone else’s tweets.
If a friend or family member tweets, that’s a good place to start. If not, after 
you log in to your Twitter account, go to the top of the page and click the 
Find People link. This link takes you to a screen where you type in someone’s 
first name, last name, or Twitter username, and see whether he or she is 
tweeting.
Try typing obama, mccain, oprah, or cnn as examples. Figure 10-1 shows the 
results if you typed CDC (Centers for Disease Control). The agency uses Twitter 
to get the official word out regarding swine flu and other health emergencies — a 
useful example of tweeting, in my opinion.
Twitter found a number of CDCs. Click the first link to display a list of recent 
tweets for that Twitterer (another name for a tweeter). What you get is shown 
in Figure 10-2.

The Follow button
Clicking the Follow button subscribes you to that Twitterer’s future tweets. 
Your Twitter home page displays any tweets you’ve subscribed to.
 
You can easily delete a tweet subscription by clicking the Following link on 
your Twitter home page. Choose the subscription to delete and click the 
Remove button.
 
Searching is fine, but sometimes it’s easier to see categorized tweets. Use a 
Twitter directory Web site such as WeFollow.com (http://wefollow.com) 
to check out tweets organized by categories.
As a follower, you can reply to a tweet either publicly or privately. Unless the 
tweets are going out to a relatively small number of people, it’s a good idea 
not to expect a reply, though — especially with famous and not-so-famous 
Twitterers with legions of followers. But you never know who you might get a 
response from.
 
Some Twitterers use automated programs to post their tweets. With some 
tweets, you do the math and tell me whether anyone could possibly be churn-
ing out such a high volume of messages by hand. In addition, although some 
celebrity tweeters do post their own messages, others rely on ghost-tweeters 
or PR services to do most of the work.

157
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
Sending tweets to followers
Sending a tweet out to your followers is simple. On your Twitter.com home 
page, type up to 140 characters in the “What are you doing?” text box and 
click the Update button. The tweet is sent winging its way out to your loyal 
followers.
 
Better yet, use one of the Twitter applications I mention in the “Twitter.com or 
not” sidebar to send out your tweets.
There are lots of Web sites, forum posts, and blog articles devoted to Twitter 
etiquette, including do’s and don’ts. Google them if you’re interested, or just 
apply some common sense.
 
Twitter makes use of special characters at the beginning of a tweet to do dif-
ferent things. For example, if you want to send a private message to someone, 
type d and then the person’s Twitter username. For example, the following 
statement would send a message only to a user named renaldo_moon:
d renaldo_moon was that a fat cat or what?
Check the Twitter online help for information on all the text commands.
Twitter.com or not
Although you can certainly use the Twitter.
com Web site to send and follow tweets, it’s 
much easier to use a standalone program 
that accesses the Twitter feeds. The friendly 
folks at Twitter released an API (Application 
Programming Interface) that allows anyone to 
write a program that will work with the Twitter 
service. These programs are quicker to use and 
provide additional functionality.
Here are several Windows programs you might 
consider installing on your netbook:
 ✓ MadTwitter: (www.madtwitter.com) 
Based on the popular Twitterrific for the 
Mac, this application installs in the desk-
top system tray and alerts you of incoming 
tweets. Click the icon to bring up a window 
to send tweets of your own. 
 ✓ Feedalizr: (www.feedalizr.com) An 
Adobe Air desktop application for interfac-
ing several social networking sites, includ-
ing Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr.
 ✓ TweetDeck: (www.tweetdeck.com) 
Another Adobe Air application that offers 
extended features for Twitter users not 
found on the Twitter Web site.

grams for Macs, Linux PCs and cell phones),

Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Getting the word out
Knowing how to tweet to followers doesn’t do you much good if you don’t 
have any followers, does it? Here are a few tips for attracting followers:
 
✓ Make yourself easy to find by choosing a Twitter name that’s close to 
your real name.
 
✓ Click the Find People link on your Twitter home page and then click 
the Invite By E-Mail link. You can enter one or more e-mail addresses to 
tell people that you tweet.
 
✓ Include your Twitter account name in e-mail, on Web sites, business 
cards, advertisements, wherever.
 
✓ Include useful or interesting information in your tweets. Unless you’re 
famous, most people couldn’t care less what kind of pickle is on your 
sandwich.
 
✓ Be engaging. Don’t make it a one-way conversation.
Unless it’s friends and family (who tend to be captive audiences), you need to 
put some work into retaining followers. The best way to do this is by following 
different people and understanding what makes a good (and bad) Twitterer. 
Practical applications
I’m a practical kind of guy, and personally don’t see the value in knowing 
when a celebrity is walking her toy poodle or in getting 24/7 updates on what 
Shrinking links
Because tweets are limited to 140 characters, 
you want to be brief and terse. This can be a 
challenge if you’re including a Web site address 
in the tweet — especially a long one.
The secret is to use a free Web service that 
provides a short Web address that redi-
rects to the longer one. For example, you 
could turn a long Web address like www.
dummies.com/store/product/
GPS-For-Dummies-2nd-Edition.
productCd-0470156236.html into a 
short one like http://tinyurl.com/
qgo52v.
Here are some free services that put bloated 
Web site addresses on a crash diet:
 ✓ TinyURL (www.tinyurl.com)
 ✓ bit.ly (www.bit.ly)
 ✓ is.gd (www.is.gd)
 ✓ Snipurl (www.snipurl.com)

159
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
my best friend is doing or thinking. But hey, if you like that kind of thing, 
that’s cool.
In my opinion, Twitter is a great tool for quickly communicating time-sensitive 
information and keeping people updated on significant stuff. Aside from the 
entertainment value (everyone needs guilty pleasures), here are some practical 
applications for Twitter:
 
✓ Quick updates to distant friends or family
 
✓ Brand building (developing a loyal base of followers)
 
✓ Marketing (driving traffic to Web sites)
 
✓ Stock tips and financial news
 
✓ Asking questions (If you have a large enough group of followers, collec-
tive wisdom can often be much faster than searching the Web.)
 
✓ Breaking news stories
 
✓ Critical emergency information (disasters, flu pandemics, fires)
 
✓ Advertising (special sales, discounts, and so on — just don’t spam)
You could make the argument that anything you can do with Twitter you can 
do with e-mail, instant messaging, or blogs. That’s very true, although Twitter 
forces you to be brief and doesn’t seem to be as time consuming — unless 
you’re following lots of people.
It’s too soon to tell whether Twitter is just another fad with its popularity 
driven by novelty or whether it will have legs and become a mainstay of the 
Net like e-mail or Web sites. Time will definitely tell.
There’s much more to Twitter than I have the pages to cover. To come up to 
speed, check out the Help section at www.twitter.com. In addition, lots 
of Web sites and blogs are devoted to Twitter. Google is your friend when it 
comes to finding out more.
Social Networking “Friend” Sites
You’ve probably heard and read about MySpace (shown in Figure 10-3) and 
Facebook. These two Web sites (www.myspace.com and www.facebook.
com) are currently the biggest players in the Internet social networking 
scene. If you already have a MySpace or Facebook account, this section is 
going to be old news for you. If not, read on to see what all of the buzz is 
about.

160
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
Figure 10-3: 
Even 
the U.S. 
president 
is on 
MySpace.
 
For starters, social networking sites share common characteristics: 
 
✓ Web-centric: You use a Web browser to access the site. Also, unlike 
building a traditional Web site, which requires varying degrees of techni-
cal knowledge and skill, social networking sites feature easy-to-use tools 
for creating a Web presence.
 
✓ Free: Most social networking sites are supported by advertising and 
don’t cost anything to join. (A few sites cost money to join or provide 
premium services for a fee.)
 
✓ Communication-oriented: Blogs, messaging, and photo and music host-
ing are just a few of the internal tools that sites offer their users for stay-
ing in touch with each other.
 
✓ Profile-based: Social networking sites rely on user-created profiles. You pro-
vide various bits of information about yourself in a profile that other users 
can see. Profiles are searchable so people on the network can find you.
 
✓ Friend-focused: Part of a social network presence includes a list of other 
people in the network who are your “friends.” (The definition of friend 
ranges broadly. At one end is a stranger who’s hoping you’ll reciprocally 
list her as a friend, and at the other end is your mother. Because your 
total number of friends is always displayed, some people go for quantity 
versus quality.)
Younger Internet users were the early adopters of social networking Web 
sites. When the ball got rolling in the mid-2000s, MySpace was viewed pri-
marily as a place for teenagers (and even younger kids) to hang out. When 
Facebook (see Figure 10-4) debuted, it was targeted toward college-age users.

161
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
 
Figure 10-4: 
The U.S. 
president 
is also on 
Facebook.
 
Since then, older users have flocked to both sites (often to the dismay of the 
original younger generations), and social networking has gone mainstream. 
Professionally oriented sites such as LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) are 
seeking to tap into the growing adult interest in social networking.
 
According to a Pew Internet survey, at the beginning of 2009, about 35 percent 
of adult Net users use social networking sites. Compare that to around 65 per-
cent of online teens ages 12 to 17 and roughly 75 percent of Net users between 
18 and 24 who use social networking sites. Only 7 percent of Net users 65 and 
older can be found on the sites, but I suspect that number will rise.
Should you participate in a social networking site? That’s up to you. They 
do offer a great way to stay in touch with friends and family members and to 
share what’s going on in your life. Check out a social networking page that 
belongs to someone you know and see what you think. If it looks interesting, 
sign up for an account and give it try. If you don’t like the experience, you can 
always stop participating and delete the account.
 
Employers and prospective employers are increasingly checking out MySpace 
and Facebook to see what kind of presence employees or potential future 
employees have. (In fact, some employers are even requesting Facebook 
URLs from prospective employees instead of traditional resumes.) The lines 
between personal and professional life are becoming increasingly blurred. Yes 
I know, you have a right to self-expression. Just realize that anything you say 
(and post) on the Internet may be held against you — even 5, 10, or 15 years 
down the road.

162
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
All online networking sites have extensive online help that covers all aspects 
of using a site — in addition, the Internet is filled with tutorials, guides, and 
how-tos for social networking sites. Or if you’re old school, visit your local 
library or friendly bookstore and pick up a copy of MySpace For Dummies by 
Ryan Hupfer, Mitch Maxson, and Ryan Williams, or Facebook For Dummies by 
Carolyn Abram and Leah Pearlman, both published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
Going inside Instant Messaging (IM)
Instant messaging (commonly known as IM or chat) is a way to have a real-
time text conversation with one or more people. You run an IM program on 
your netbook (which needs to be connected to the Internet) then type a mes-
sage to someone else who’s online. The text appears on his screen, and he 
replies. Then you reply. And so on.
The technology isn’t exactly cutting edge, but if you’ve never done instant 
messaging before and want to try it out on your netbook, read on.
IM networks
Instant messaging works through a series of servers connected to the Internet. 
You connect to a server with an IM program (more on that coming up). The 
MySpace and Facebook differences
In a nutshell, here are the differences between 
MySpace and Facebook:
MySpace:
 ✓ Younger demographic
 ✓ Users tend to use aliases
 ✓ Offers more creative options for custom 
layout designs
 ✓ More focused on entertainment and music
Facebook:
 ✓ Older demographic
 ✓ Users tend to use real names
 ✓ Standardized layout designs
 ✓ More professionally oriented
MySpace long was the top social network-
ing site, but in the spring of 2009, it was sur-
passed by Facebook’s higher growth rate and 
hit counts. Many analysts believe Facebook 
will take a commanding lead and dominate the 
social networking market in the coming years.

163
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
server notifies other users that have added you to their address books that 
you’re online. They can then send you messages, or you can send them mes-
sages. The IM servers handle all the traffic passing back and forth. When 
you’re done, you either finish the conversation or log off the network.
Before you can instant message, you need a free account on an IM network, 
which houses the servers. A number of IM networks are available. Here are 
Web addresses for the most popular services where you can register for an 
account:
 
✓ AIM, www.aim.com
 
✓ Google, http://mail.google.com/mail/signup
 
✓ ICQ, http://web.icq.com/register
 
✓ MSN, http://registernet.passport.com
 
✓ Yahoo! http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register
 
Skype also features IM capabilities. I discuss Skype later in this chapter.
IM clients
When you have an account on an IM network, you need an IM program (in 
geek-speak, a client). This is a program that connects to the IM network over 
the Internet and allows you to send and receive messages — as well as per-
form other IM housekeeping tasks.
Generally, each IM network has a specific client program that works only with 
that network. For example, if you sign up for an account on the AIM (AOL 
Instant Messaging) network, you would use the AIM client program. You can 
freely download the client software from the Web site where you registered 
for the IM network account.
 
Most networks also let you IM through a Web page on the network’s Web site 
(listed in the preceding section). This is handy if you’re on a computer that 
doesn’t have the client software installed — or you’re too lazy to load it on 
your netbook.
Your Windows netbook should come with MSN Messenger already installed. 
Depending on the manufacturer, other IM programs may also be present.
 
My favorite IM client is a free, open-source program called Pidgin (www.
pidgin.im). Pidgin is a multiprotocol client (you can use it on a number of 
different IM networks, as shown in Figure 10-5) that has many nifty features.

164

With the 
Pidgin 
client, you

multiple IM 
networks.

URL: http://im.about.com.
IM basics
Entire books have been written on instant messaging, and there’s a lot to 
know, but I want to give you a very quick rundown on some basic information 
to get you going:
 
✓ IM client software has a search feature for finding people that have an 
account on the IM network. Use the search feature to find people you 
want to chat with — or better yet, ask a friend or family member ahead 
of time for his or her IM account name; be sure to tell them yours.
 
✓ IM programs have address books (also known as buddy lists) where 
you store the network account names of people you frequently chat 
with. An icon typically appears next to an account name to let you know 
whether a person is online and available to chat. (To avoid spamming, 
most networks require a user to approve or deny adding their name to 
someone else’s address book.)
 
✓ While your IM program is running and connected, if someone wants 
to chat with you, a sound is played or an icon flashes. Because of 
this, many users keep their IM program running in the background; just 
remember, this taxes your netbook’s memory and processor a bit.

165
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
 
✓ If you’re away from your netbook (or too busy to chat), you can set 
your status to “away from desk” so people won’t try to ring you up.
 
✓ You can include emoticons (smiley and other faces) in a message to 
add a little more feeling to the text.
 
✓ Some IM clients offer more than just text chatting. For instance, your 
IM client might include features such as video conferencing (with a 
webcam), sending messages when someone is offline, encryption, and 
file transfer.
 
✓ IM tends to favor speedy typists and people who communicate better 
with written versus spoken words.
The main IM network Web site, as well as the online help that comes with 
your IM client, tells you everything else you need to know.
 
IMing can be a huge time-sink, especially if you keep your client running in the 
background and feel obligated to chat with everyone who rings you up. At first 
it’s kind of fun, but it can easily become a productivity hit if you let it get away 
from you — both initiating and receiving chat sessions.
Getting the Scoop on Skype
How would you like to talk with someone across the country without paying 
expensive long distance bills or burning up precious cell phone minutes? You 
can, using the Internet and a popular free program called Skype. There’s a 
good chance it’s already installed on your netbook, but if not, you can get it 
from www.skype.com. If you’ve never used Skype, this section tells you what 
you need to know.
 
Skype was originally known as “Sky peer-to-peer” or Skyper. Because someone 
already had the Skyper Web domain, the developers decided to drop the r, and 
Skype was born.
Skype, and other programs like it, use a protocol designed for sending and 
receiving digitized voice over the Internet (the technical term for this is 
Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP). When you speak into your netbook’s 
microphone, your words are converted into data packets that are sent to 
the computer of whomever you’re having the conversation with. The data is 
then reconverted, and the person on the other end hears your voice. It’s just 
like a normal phone conversation, with the same level of voice quality, but 
everything is done over the Internet without a traditional phone company 
involved.

166
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
Skype is free if you’re calling someone else who has a Skype account or that 
person is calling you. If you want to use Skype to call a landline or mobile 
phone (or take an incoming call from someone on a landline or mobile phone), 
you need to pay for an additional service — which is usually cheaper than 
most long distance plans.
To get started running Skype, you need an account. If you don’t have an 
account, you can sign up for one directly from the program — that’s a hint to 
run it now if you’re following along. Select a Skype name and password, enter 
your e-mail address, fill in your profile, and you’re ready to go. The main 
Skype program window is shown in Figure 10-6.
 
You have the option of automatically loading and running Skype whenever 
your netbook starts. Just remember, the more programs that are running in 
the background, the bigger a performance hit your little laptop will take.
Skype allows you to search for other Skype users based on information 
in their profiles — specifically the user’s Skype name, full name, or e-mail 
address. As I write this, over 440 million Skype accounts are in existence, so 
there’s a good chance someone you know is using Skype.
 
Figure 10-6:

window is

do your 
bidding.
 

167
 Chapter 10: Staying in Touch: Twitter, Social Networking, IM, and Skype
When you find out someone’s Skype account name (whether by searching 
the Skype network or simply by asking), you add that name as a contact. 
After you’ve added a contact, you can give that person a ring by double-
clicking her Skype name in the main program window. You can tell whether 
she’s available by an icon that appears next to her name — a gray icon with 
an X means unavailable. (With newer versions of Skype, the person needs to 
approve you before you can add her name to your contact list.)
 
Before calling someone, I suggest you double-click on the Skype Test Call con-
tact. This is a handy feature that makes a test call to ensure your microphone 
and speakers are configured correctly.
Skype will let the person know you’re calling, she answers, and then you 
have a conversation just like you were talking on the phone — speaking into 
your microphone and listening to your speakers. In addition to making voice 
phone calls you can also instant message, video conference (using your 
webcam), and transfer files with another user.
 
Instead of using your netbook’s built-in speakers and microphone when you’re 
using Skype, I suggest you invest in a headset. I discuss selecting headsets in 
Chapter 15.
Check the Skype online help to find out more or watch one of the many 
tutorials available on YouTube. Or, if you’re old-fashioned, pick up a copy of 
Skype For Dummies by Loren Abdulezer, Susan Abdulezer, Howard Dammond, 
and Niklas Zennstrom (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Netbook Navigators
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding GPS
▶ Building a netbook navigator
▶ Selecting a netbook-compatible GPS receiver
▶ Selecting the right map software
▶ Connecting everything together
I
t’s not everyday I get a chance to talk about two of my favorite subjects, 
GPS and netbooks. You might not know it, but these two recent techno-
logical innovations go together like apple pie and vanilla ice cream. Combine 
the two, and you get a delicious netbook navigator.
You may be wondering in these days of cheap car GPS units and maps on 
your cell phone, why would you need GPS on your netbook? Simple: A net-
book gives you a lot of navigation power in a small package. Lots of the free 
and low-cost map software available can run circles around your cell phone 
or car GPS unit. Load a program or two onto your take-anywhere netbook, 
connect a GPS receiver, and you’ll never be lost again — at least as long as 
the battery lasts.
In this chapter, I bring you up to speed on using GPS with a netbook. I briefly 
explain what GPS is, describe different types of GPS units you can use with 
your netbook (and how to connect them), and recommend map programs for 
various uses.
It’s time to set a 270 degree course heading and shove off, matey! Steady as 
she goes.

170
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
GPS in a Nutshell
There’s a lot to know about GPS, and entire books have been written about 
the subject (more on that in a minute). But I keep it short and sweet and just 
tell you the absolute basics:
 
✓ GPS stands for Global Positioning System. It’s a series of satellites that 
transmit radio waves down to earth. A GPS unit receives the signals from 
three or more satellites and mathematically determines your location — 
anywhere in the world.
 
✓ GPS was originally developed by the U.S. military but is freely avail-
able to anyone who has a GPS receiver. There are no annual subscrip-
tion fees to use the service.
 
✓ GPS works best if you have a clear view of the sky. Heavy forests, tall 
buildings, and parking garage interiors can all block GPS signals so an 
accurate position can’t be determined. Newer GPS receivers use high-
sensitivity chips for better signal reception.
 
✓ GPS units report your location in latitude and longitude. It looks 
something like this: 48.14417, – 122.75522. They also provide information 
about time, speed, distance, and elevation.
 
✓ When you save a location on your GPS unit, it’s called a waypoint.
 
✓ GPS is typically accurate anywhere from 10 to 100 feet — these days 
more like in the 10-to-30-foot range. Satellite signal strength and the 
number of satellite signals available impact accuracy.
 
✓ GPS units can be connected to netbooks and other personal comput-
ers and interact with programs and digital maps. For example, your 
current position appears on a map that moves as you do.
That’s a super-encapsulated explanation of the nuts and bolts of GPS. There’s 
a lot more to discover, so here’s a shameless plug for another For Dummies 
book I wrote called GPS For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). Enough with 
the sales pitches and back to netbooks.
Surveying GPS Receivers
I assume you already have a netbook (or plan to get one). If so, you’re about 
halfway there in turning your little laptop into a personal navigator. The next 
thing you need is a GPS receiver that will work with your netbook. As I write 
this, a few manufacturers have announced netbook models that will come 
with built-in GPS receivers. However, if you don’t have one of these new geo-
smart netbooks, the following sections tell you about the types of GPS units 
you can use with any netbook.

171
 Chapter 11: Netbook Navigators
Handheld GPS receivers
Handheld GPS receivers are traditionally used for hiking and other outdoor 
activities. They’re compact, run a long time on AA batteries, and often dis-
play maps. Most models can also connect to a computer to provide your 
netbook with real-time location data. The big advantage to a handheld GPS 
receiver is you can use it by itself (for hiking, biking, boating, whatever) and 
then connect it to your netbook whenever you need to.
When it comes to handheld GPS units, I prefer Garmin (www.garmin.com) 
products, like the one shown in Figure 11-1. They tend to be easy to use, well 
built, and reliable. Good battery life, the availability of many free maps that 
can be uploaded to the unit, and ease of connecting to a netbook via a USB 
cable are also big pluses.
 
Other handheld GPS manufacturers to consider include DeLorme (www.
delorme.com), Lowrance (www.lowrance.com), and Magellan (www.
magellangps.com).
Minimum netbook navigator requirements
You can turn just about any netbook into a net-
book navigator (one is shown in Figure 11-1), 
but I strongly recommend the following for your 
minimum requirements:
 ✓ 10-inch screen: The more screen real estate 
to display the map and program controls, 
the better.
 ✓ Hard disk drive: Lots of maps take up lots of 
space. Although a solid state drive is fast, 
most don’t have enough capacity to store 
a large number of maps — I’m talking giga-
bytes of data for a decent size collection of 
maps.
 ✓ Windows operating system: You can find a 
few Linux map programs out there, but many 
more Windows programs are available — I 
discuss some of the best coming up.
 ✓ External power source: If you’re using your 
netbook in a car, truck, or boat, you’ll want 
some type of an external power supply, 
such as a cigarette lighter adapter or 
inverter. I tell you everything you need to 
know in Chapter 13.
 ✓ External DVD drive: Some map software 
packages require a DVD drive to install 
the program and data. Check the software 
requirements before you purchase or 
download a map program.

Handheld GPS receivers generally are priced between $100 and $500 — the 
higher the price, the more features. An expensive consumer GPS unit is gen-
erally no more accurate than a budget model — in most cases a basic or mid-
ranged model will serve you just as well as a top of the line model.
 
If you have a GPS unit in your car, keep in mind that most automotive GPS 
receivers aren’t designed to interface with a computer. Sorry.
Mouse GPS units
GPS receivers that don’t have a display screen but connect to a computer 
with a USB cable are often called mouse receivers because they sort of look 
like a computer mouse — one is shown in Figure 11-2. A mouse GPS receiver 
acts as an input device for your netbook and sends only satellite data that it’s 
currently receiving.
 
There is a product that incorporates a GPS receiver into a real computer 
mouse — personally, I think it’s a little cheesy.

173
 Chapter 11: Netbook Navigators
Mouse GPS receivers are about half the size of the smallest handheld GPS 
receivers, but even so, they still have good satellite reception with open 
skies. Depending on the model and type, a mouse GPS receiver can be pow-
ered by a cigarette lighter adapter, rechargeable batteries, or from the USB 
port of the computer it’s plugged into.
 
Figure 11-2: 
A USB 
mouse GPS 
receiver.
 
Mouse GPS products are usually under $100. A number of companies that 
offer street map programs optionally bundle a mouse GPS receiver with t
heir software. Garmin (www.garmin.com), DeLorme (www.delorme.com), 
and Microsoft (www.microsoft.com) are among some of the popular 
manufacturers.
 
You can also find tailless mouse GPS receivers. These are GPS units that plug 
directly into your netbook’s USB port — there’s no cable. The downside to 
these products is you can’t position the GPS receiver in an optimal location 
because it’s attached directly to the netbook. If your netbook doesn’t have a 
good view of open skies, you may get weak satellite signals.
Bluetooth GPS
Bluetooth GPS units (one is shown in Figure 11-3) get rid of cable clutter by 
wirelessly sending location information to your netbook. If your netbook sup-
ports Bluetooth (see Chapter 6), it’s just a matter of installing some software, 
configuring your netbook, and turning on the Bluetooth GPS unit. Just like 
magic, GPS data is wirelessly transmitted.

174
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
Bluetooth GPS receivers are pretty slick because of what they don’t do:
 
✓ They don’t rely on the netbook’s batteries for power. They have their 
own power source and will run from 6–10 hours when fully charged, 
depending on the model.
 
✓ They don’t use up one of the netbook’s USB ports.
 
✓ They don’t need cables that can become a tangled mess. Bluetooth 
devices have about a 30-foot range, and the GPS receiver can be placed 
in an optimal position on a car’s dashboard to receive satellite signals.
Place your Bluetooth GPS receiver (about the size of a mouse GPS receiver 
or smaller) anywhere with an open view of the sky, and it will broadcast GPS 
data to your Bluetooth-enabled netbook.
 
Some Bluetooth models serve dual duty and also allow you to connect the GPS 
receiver with a USB cable.
Many Bluetooth GPS receivers are on the market these days. Your best bet to 
find out more is to do a Google search for bluetooth gps.

175
 Chapter 11: Netbook Navigators
Selecting Map Software
After you have a netbook and a suitable GPS receiver, you need some map-
ping software. Before I make recommendations on what to get, you should 
know there are three ways to use a GPS-enabled netbook. With it, you can
 
✓ See where you’re currently located. The GPS unit reports your current 
location, and the mapping software displays your location on a map. The 
location point on the map moves, and the map itself scrolls as the GPS 
unit moves. With street map programs, you enter a destination, and the 
program gives you turn-by-turn directions on how to get there, whether 
the directions are listed onscreen, are announced with a synthesized 
voice, or both.
 
✓ See where you’ve been. A GPS receiver stores information about where 
it’s been — see the “Making tracks (and waypoints)” sidebar. You can 
transfer this information to your netbook and use a map program to dis-
play it.
 
✓ Exchange data. Map programs allow you to download other data from 
your GPS unit (such as waypoints) to your netbook or upload data (way-
points and maps) from your netbook. Most GPS receivers come with 
basic software for exchanging and saving data.
 
Manufacturers use proprietary map formats for displaying maps on handheld 
and automotive GPS units. Unless map software comes from the manufacturer, 
you won’t be able to copy a digital map you see on your netbook to a GPS 
receiver. (There are few exceptions to this rule. For example, hackers success-
fully reverse-engineered Garmin’s map format, and now a number of utilities 
are available for creating Garmin-compatible maps.)
SD card GPS
In addition to USB and Bluetooth GPS receiv-
ers, some GPS units that are available can be 
inserted into your netbook’s SD card reader. 
This might sound like a good idea, but I’m not 
too keen on these products for a few reasons:
 ✓ If you’re not connected to an external 
power source, GPS receiver cards can run 
down your netbook’s battery fairly quickly.
 ✓ They take up your only SD card slot.
 ✓ Because they’re inserted into your netbook, 
you can’t position the receiver for optimal 
satellite reception.
Opt for a USB mouse or Bluetooth GPS receiver 
instead.

176
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
You can spend a little or a lot on map programs — commercial, shareware, 
and free programs are available. Because so many different types of maps 
exist, you can find programs that are specialized for one particular use or 
another — such as street map program, hiking map program, and so on.
The following sections give you a quick rundown on some suitable map soft-
ware candidates for your netbook, organized by type.
Street maps
Street map programs help you navigate paved roads, highways, and byways. 
If you’ve used a car GPS unit, street map programs provide the same func-
tionality — with more features and a bigger screen.
One of the more popular street map programs is DeLorme’s Street Atlas USA, 
shown in Figure 11-4. This program displays roadmaps of the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico; finds addresses; and creates routes between two or 
more points. Check out a few of the program’s other useful features:
 
✓ POIs: All street navigation programs contain extensive databases of 
POIs. POIs refer to Points of Interest such as restaurants, hotels, parks, 
gas stations, and other locations you might be interested in while travel-
ing. Street Atlas USA has a POI database that contains over four million 
businesses, services, and organizations.
Making tracks (and waypoints)
GPS receivers support a feature called tracks. 
A track is a location where you’ve been — think 
of it as an electronic breadcrumb. Whenever 
the GPS unit is turned on, it dutifully collects 
and stores a track point — the latitude and lon-
gitude, data and time, and elevation. You specify 
how often track points are collected, either by a 
set amount of time or distance.
When you connect a GPS receiver to a net-
book, you can download the track file. Then 
you run a map program, load the track file, and 
presto, a record of your travels appears over-
laid on the map.
Another GPS term you should be familiar with 
is waypoint. This is information about a known 
location, including coordinates and a name. 
Say you wanted to mark a favorite fishing spot. 
You’d create a waypoint for the location with 
your GPS unit and give it a short name. The 
waypoint is stored in a list in the GPS receiver’s 
memory. When you want to go back to where 
the fish are biting, you display the waypoint list 
and instruct the GPS unit to go to that point. It 
happily calculates the distance and uses an 
arrow to show you how to get there. If your GPS 
receiver can display a map, an icon appears at 
the waypoint’s location. 
Oh, if only Hansel and Gretel had a GPS unit 
with them, that poor misunderstood witch might 
still be around today.

177
 Chapter 11: Netbook Navigators
 
✓ Voice support: Street Atlas USA can give you voice instructions when 
you need to turn to reach your destination. You can also use a voice 
recognition feature to give Street Atlas USA commands instead of using a 
keyboard or mouse.
 
✓ Routable roads: A big issue that all map companies face is ensuring that 
their road data is accurate — this is challenging considering the number 
of new roads that are built every year. Street Atlas USA has a feature that 
allows you to draw in roads that are missing on a map. After you create 
a road, Street Atlas USA can use it when calculating routes.
 
✓ Netbook interface: Street Atlas USA offers a UMPC (Ultra Mobile PC) 
mode during installation that configures its interface for a smaller-screen 
netbook.
 
✓ Aerial photos: You can purchase and download aerial photos and then 
overlay streets and POI information on top of the bird’s-eye view.
 
✓ Customizable maps: Street Atlas USA has an extensive collection of 
drawing tools for customizing maps with symbols, shapes, and text 
annotations.
Street Atlas USA has many more features than I can cover in the space of this 
section (such as downloadable maps, distance measuring, and trip planning 
that takes fuel consumption as well as the number of hours spent driving into 
consideration). To find out more about all of the features, visit www.delorme. 
com. The program’s suggested retail price is under $40.
Microsoft also makes a popular street and roadmap program appropriately 
named Streets & Trips. Find out more about it at www.microsoft.com/
Streets/en-us/default.aspx.
 
If you want to run street map software on your netbook, you need an external 
DVD drive to install the program and maps.
 
At this point, there aren’t any free street map programs that match the fea-
tures of commercial road navigation programs. That may be changing in the 
future with a slick open-source project called OpenStreetMap. To find out 
more, visit www.openstreetmap.org.
Topographic maps
Topographic maps show land features and are primarily used for hiking and 
other outdoor activities. If you visit the TerraServer-USA Web site (http://
terraserver-usa.com), you can view topographic maps of different scales 
for the United States; these official maps are produced by the United States 
Geological Survey (USGS).

Doug Cox, who is a retired airline pilot turned Windows programmer, lever-
ages this map data in an elegantly small, powerful-yet-easy-to-use program 
called USAPhotoMaps (http://jdmcox.com). Use it to
 
✓ Display USGS topographic maps and aerial photos.
 
✓ Zoom in and out on map features.
 
✓ Support user-defined text labels.
 
✓ Print and save user-selected areas as JPG format files.
 
✓ Interface with a GPS receiver for real-time tracking.
 
✓ Import and export GPS waypoints, routes, and tracks.
The cool thing about this program is it caches all the map data to your 
hard drive. That means after you initially view an area, you don’t need an 
Internet connection to display the maps again. You can be out in the middle 
of nowhere, with no wireless or Net connection for miles, and USAPhotoMaps 
will show you where you’re located. (See Figure 11-5.)
Cox updates the program regularly and has added a variety of new features 
over the years. It’s free (including the C source code), but if you like it, give 
him a tip of the hat with a PayPal donation.
 
DeLorme (www.delorme.com), Maptech (www.maptech.com), National 
Geographic Maps (www.natgeomaps.com), and TopoFusion (www.topo
fusion.com) all make commercial topographic map programs for Windows 
and are worth checking out.

Some topographic map programs can display maps in 3-D. But be prepared for 
a potentially long wait because most netbooks don’t have the graphics or pro-
cessor horsepower for this kind of work.
Satellite images
Google Earth has to be one of the slickest free pieces of software to come 
around in years. The program is a virtual globe with color satellite imagery of 
the entire world. You simply rotate the globe to a location you’re interested 
in and then zoom in to see more detail.
In addition to showing satellite imagery (an example is shown in Figure 11-6), 
Google Earth can also overlay data onto its bird’s-eye views. With a click of 
a button, you can see roads, storm fronts, cities, borders, Wikipedia entries, 
user-submitted photos, and more.
Between satellite images and layers, this is a huge amount of data. It would 
be impossible to include all of this on a few DVDs, so Google keeps the data 
online on some serious, industrial-strength servers. The program uses an 
Internet connection to download data you’re interested in seeing. When you 
scroll or zoom, Google Earth gets new data from the servers and displays it.
 
Google Earth caches data to your hard drive. This means if you’ve previously 
viewed an area, you won’t need to have an Internet connection to see it again — 
that is, unless the cache (up to 2GB) is written over by new places you visit.

Google offers a for-pay version of the program called Google Earth Plus that 
incorporated several advanced features such as the ability to interface with a 
GPS receiver. Recently, the company decided to add GPS functionality to the 
free version of the program. That means you can have satellite image moving 
maps with your netbook when you connect a GPS unit. James Bond has noth-
ing on you — well, the Google images aren’t real time, sorry 007.

Charts
A chart is the official term for a map that covers navigable waters — such as 
coastal waters and the oceans. A netbook makes a handy-dandy boating compan-
ion (for vessels with cabins) when coupled with digital charts and a GPS receiver.
Although you can find many commercial Windows navigation programs on the 
market (they vary considerably in price), if you’re just getting your feet wet 
with electronic navigation, I suggest you start the low-budget (as in free) route.
If you live in the United States, reclaim some of your hard-earned tax dol-
lars by downloading free nautical charts — noncitizens can, too. In 2005, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began making all 
of its digital charts available on the Internet for free. Just point your browser 
to http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov and follow the directions. You 
want to download Raster Navigation Charts (RNCs). These are scanned 

181
 Chapter 11: Netbook Navigators
versions of paper charts, sometimes referred to as BSB charts; the name of 
the proprietary format back when they weren’t free.
After you’ve downloaded a few free charts, you need a program to use them. 
The navigation software packages on the market cost anywhere from $50 to 
$1,000 or more. These programs let you view and print charts. If you have a 
netbook hooked up to a GPS receiver, you can see where you are on the chart 
in the comfort of your boat’s cabin while motoring or sailing.
I want to point you in the direction of a great Windows navigation program 
that’s free. It’s called SeaClear (shown in Figure 11-7), and you can download it 
from www.sping.com/seaclear. SeaClear is a powerful and easy-to-use pro-
gram that works great with NOAA RNC charts. It’s in use all over the world and 
is frequently updated by its creator. A netbook (SeaClear isn’t system-resource 
intensive), free NOAA charts, and an inexpensive GPS receiver give you a bargain-
 basement navigation system.
 
A number of other free or demo programs are also available for viewing and 
printing charts. NOAA provides a convenient list of software, including Web 
links, at http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/Raster/resources.
htm.
Making the Connection
You have a netbook, GPS receiver, and some mapping software. Great! Now 
there’s just one more thing I need to tell you about: getting them all to talk to 
each other.
When consumer GPS receivers first hit the market in the 1990s, users connected 
them to a computer with a serial cable — one end plugged in the GPS unit, the 
other into the PC’s serial port. Getting the two devices to communicate was 
sometimes a challenge and required tweaking a number of different settings like 
baud rates, parity, and stop bits — those were the dark ages, believe me.
Fortunately, serial ports have mostly gone the way of the dinosaur, and USB 
is now the way to easily connect peripherals and other devices. However, 
when it comes to GPS receivers, it’s not always as simple as plugging and 
playing. Read on to find out why.
Protocols
A protocol is a way for two devices to successfully talk with each other. Think 
of a protocol as a language with a strict set of rules. When one device sends 
a message to another device, it expects a certain response back. This struc-
tured, back-and-forth chit-chat takes place until one device sends a message 
that states the conversation is over. Like, “Gotta run, catch you later.”

182
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
Figure 11-7:

software 
running on a 
netbook.
 
Likewise, when you connect a GPS receiver to a computer, a certain protocol 
is used to transfer data between the two devices. You need to ensure that the 
same protocol has been selected for both devices. If two different protocols 
are used, it’s like the GPS receiver speaking Navajo to a netbook that under-
stands only Aleut.
The protocols typically used with GPS receivers are
 
✓ NMEA: The National Marine Electronics Association came up with the 
NMEA 0183 standard, which is a protocol for transferring data between 
marine-related electronics, such as GPS receivers, autopilots, and chart 
plotters. Most GPS receivers support the NMEA 0183 standard, which 
uses widely documented text messages. Typical NMEA data includes 
latitude, longitude, time, and satellite status.
 
 NMEA comes in several different versions, including 1.5, 2.1, 2.3, and 
3.01. Make sure that this version number matches both the GPS receiver 
and the map program that you’re using.
 
✓ Proprietary: Some GPS manufacturers have proprietary protocols for 
communicating with a GPS receiver. These protocols send additional 
data (for example, altitude, speed, and position error) that isn’t included 
in the NMEA standard.
 
NMEA is the de facto standard for getting a GPS receiver to talk to a com-
puter. However, if you have a choice between NMEA and a proprietary pro-
tocol (for example, the Garmin protocol used with Garmin GPS receivers), 
select the proprietary protocol because it can supply richer data to a pro-
gram. Some Garmin GPS units don’t support NMEA, and in that case you need 
to use the Garmin protocol. The popularity of Garmin products has prompted 
most map programs to support Garmin’s protocol.

183
 Chapter 11: Netbook Navigators
Virtual serial ports
Most USB-compatible GPS receivers come with special driver software that 
creates a virtual serial port (a serial port is also known as a COM port) that’s 
associated with the GPS unit. You install and configure the driver software 
(which comes with the receiver on a CD-ROM or DVD or is downloadable 
from the manufacturer’s Web site). When you plug the GPS unit into your 
netbook with a USB cable, the software emulates a serial port connection. 
This allows mapping software that needs to communicate with a GPS unit 
through a serial port to successfully do so even though it’s a USB connec-
tion (which uses a different protocol). Check your GPS unit’s user manual for 
more information.
 
If you plug in a USB GPS receiver that doesn’t have an associated driver 
installed, the Windows Found New Hardware wizard should fire up and step 
you through the installation process. No driver means no interfacing the GPS 
unit with your netbook.
 
Always make sure you have the latest USB driver, the latest version of the 
mapping software (that supports your receiver), and the latest version of the 
GPS receiver firmware. For the driver and firmware, visit the GPS unit ‘s manu-
facturer Web site.
Putting it all together
After you have the driver software for the GPS receiver installed on your net-
book and know what protocol to use, it’s time to put everything together and 
test out your netbook navigator.
Here are the general steps for interfacing your netbook with a GPS unit with 
a USB cable. (If you have a Bluetooth GPS receiver, see the instructions that 
came with the GPS unit.)
 
1. Connect the GPS USB cable to your netbook and to your GPS unit.
 
 Your netbook should be running.
 
2. Turn on your GPS receiver.
 
 If you’re plotting your current location with a map program, the GPS 
receiver needs to get a satellite fix (receive signals from at least three 
satellites) before it can provide your present position. This process can 
take a matter of seconds or minutes. A GPS receiver will get a fix faster if 
it’s stationary and not moving.
 
3. Run the map program.

184
Part II: Using Your Netbook 
 
4. Ensure that the protocols and settings on both the GPS receiver and 
the map program are the same.
 
 Some map programs automatically search all of the available COM ports 
for a connected GPS unit. If your GPS receiver doesn’t seem to be talking 
to your netbook, try manually specifying a different COM port setting — 
they’re numbered, such as COM1, COM2, and so on.
If you successfully connect (if you don’t, the map program will tell you), you 
can then
 
✓ Select the type of data (waypoints, routes, or tracks) and upload it to the 
GPS receiver from your netbook — or download it from the GPS receiver 
to your netbook.
 
✓ Upload a map to the GPS receiver that was created with a GPS manufac-
turer’s mapping program.
 
✓ Have the GPS receiver start providing location data to the program for 
real-time mapping.
Check the map program’s user manual or online help for specific instructions 
on transferring data between your GPS receiver and a computer. If you’re 
still having difficulties, post a message in one of the netbook forums I list in 
Chapter 22.
Happy navigating!
Spanner
When it comes to using my netbook with soft-
ware that doesn’t directly support a Garmin 
handheld GPS unit, I use Spanner. Spanner is 
a free Windows program that reads current 
GPS coordinates from Garmin’s proprietary 
data transfer protocol and translates the coor-
dinates into NMEA 0183 format. You can down-
load it from the support section of the Garmin 
Web site (www.garmin.com).
This utility was originally designed for Garmin’s 
USB mouse GPS product, so the receiver could 
interface with other navigation programs (such 
as Microsoft Streets & Trips, DeLorme Street 
Atlas, and Ozi Explorer) that use real-time NMEA 
data to display moving maps. Spanner also 
works with a number of other Garmin receivers 
and allows you to use your handheld GPS unit 
with a netbook and navigation software.
Spanner version 2.1 (the most current release) 
doesn’t work with several newer Garmin hand-
helds. An alternative is to use a commercial 
product called GPSGate. You can find more 
information about it at http://franson.

Accessories and 
Hardware

In this part . . .
D
espite being such small and affordable laptops, 
netbooks come with quite a number of hardware 
features. However, if you’re like most people, you want to 
purchase some accessories and hardware add-ons to jazz 
up your netbook’s usability and functionality. If that’s what 
you’re interested in, you came to the right part.
I start by describing netbook carrying cases — you’ll be 
surprised at all the choices. I then tell you about powering 
your netbook and include information on spare batteries, 
car chargers, and how to make your batteries last longer. 
In the remaining chapters in this part, you find out about 
expanding storage with various types of drives and how 
to connect a variety of different peripherals to your net-
book (including monitors, keyboards, modems, Bluetooth, 
and more).

▶ Selecting a sleeve
▶ Choosing a soft carrying case
▶ Finding out about rugged cases
▶ Making your own carrying case
“A
n entire chapter devoted to carrying around your netbook? Doesn’t 
that seem a bit much?” you say. A netbook is so light and small, it’s 
easy to carry around in your hand or tuck inside a bag or a large purse. So 
what’s there to know?
Actually there’s a surprising amount to know. For starters, I recommend 
always using some type of case when it’s time for your netbook to leave the 
house or office. A case . . .
 
✓ Offers added protection from bumps, scratches, and drops.
 
✓ Isn’t as likely to slip out of your hands.
 
✓ Can provide much-needed room for your wall charger, spare battery, and 
other accessories.
After you decide you need a case, you have all sorts of choices — from 
simple neoprene sleeves to high-end carrying cases to do-it-yourself carriers. 
It’s worth knowing about all these options (and more), and that’s what this 
chapter is all about.

188
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
Case in Point
You decided to take my advice about cases, and now you’re in the market for 
something you can use to carry your netbook around. Good for you — you 
won’t regret it.
Before I go into specifics, here are some tips to get you started:
 
✓ When shopping for a case, the first thing you should do is write down 
the dimensions of your netbook. Knowing the dimensions makes it easy 
to narrow down your choices because cases list their own dimensions 
and what size of laptops and netbooks they fit.
 
 If you’re using an extended battery (bigger than what came standard), 
don’t forget to factor it into your measurements.
 
✓ Don’t feel obligated to purchase a case sold by your netbook manu-
facturer. Lots of cases are available, and brand loyalty will likely end up 
costing you a little more — often without much gain.
 
✓ Check out Web forums devoted to your netbook. What people use to 
carry their netbook is a popular topic, and you frequently can find pages 
of product recommendations along with photos.
 
✓ Shop around. There are lots of deals to be had online — never pay man-
ufacturer’s suggested retail price for a carrying case.
The next few sections describe the types of cases available.
 
Who needs a case if you have the right type of clothes? If you really want to go 
for Gucci geek look, check out a SCOTTEVEST at www.scottevest.com.
Sleeves
The most basic type of carrying case is called a sleeve. This is several 
pieces of cushiony neoprene (the material used for wetsuits) sewn or glued 
together. Your netbook slides inside the sleeve, and then you put the pro-
tected netbook in a backpack, book bag, purse, or whatever. Some netbook 
models come with sleeves, but most don’t. A sleeve is shown in Figure 12-1.
 
Sleeves come in different sizes. Your netbook should fit snugly into a sleeve — 
not so tight that it’s difficult to insert or remove, and not so loose that it slides 
around inside. You want a Goldilocks “just right” fit.

189
 Chapter 12: Carrying Your Netbook
 
Figure 12-1: 
A neoprene 
sleeve 
protects 
your 
netbook.
 
Basic sleeves are simply constructed like a pillowcase. However, many variet-
ies on the market have more features, including
 
✓ Handles
 
✓ External pockets
 
✓ Zippers
 
✓ Colors other than black (Some sleeves have two layers of colored neo-
prene and are reversible.)
If you’re not going to carry your netbook around in a padded carrying case 
designed expressly for a netbook, I strongly recommend purchasing a sleeve. 
Sleeves are generally priced between $10 and $25. Do a Google search for net-
book sleeve for online sources.
 
Sleeves designed for portable DVD drives tend to be cheaper than laptop 
sleeves, and many models are sized for netbook dimensions.
 
Beware of inexpensive neoprene sleeves in the $5 or under range. They may 
be made from a cheap grade of rubber that has a distinctly bad smell. The 
odor usually goes away after a few days, but in the meantime, phew.
Soft carrying cases
A sleeve works great if you’re stashing your netbook in a bag, pack, or sack 
without padding, but many people opt for a soft, padded carrying case 
instead. Carrying cases are fitted with shoulder straps and usually offer extra 
room for carrying netbook accessories — as well as sunglasses, notebooks, 
pens, cell phones, and other stuff you use on a daily basis.

190
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
 
What’s the point of buying a sub-3-pound netbook if you’re going to fill your 
bag up with everything but the kitchen sink? What you carry around is your 
business, but personally I’m a fan of packing light.
Cases come in a variety of sizes, shapes, colors, designs, and materials 
(leather, lightweight and heavyweight nylon, neoprene, plastic, and com-
binations thereof). Aside from picking one that fits your netbook, select 
something that’s aesthetically pleasing to your eye. Use your favorite search 
engine and type in netbook case to see what’s available.
Netbook and laptop cases
When shopping for a netbook case, it’s logical to start looking at products 
designed specifically for netbooks (and small laptops) — one is shown in 
Figure 12-2. Lots of small and large companies make all manner of computer 
carrying cases. They typically feature
 
✓ Padded compartment for the laptop
 
✓ Shoulder strap or carrying handle
 
✓ Pockets of different sizes
Friendly frequent fliers
If you do a lot of air travel with your netbook, 
consider a checkpoint-friendly carrying case 
design. In 2008, the Transportation Safety 
Agency (TSA) invited case manufacturers to 
produce bags that would allow passengers to 
pass through airport security checkpoints with-
out having to remove laptops from their bags. 
Some of the TSA criteria included
 ✓ A laptop-only section that unfolds and lies 
completely flat on the X-ray conveyor belt
 ✓ Easy access to the laptop in case an officer 
needs to examine it
 ✓ A full view of the laptop in its dedicated 
compartment — no emblems, metal snaps, 
pockets, zippers, or seals on top of or 
underneath the compartment
 ✓ No more than 30 inches in length when 
opened, so X-ray machines can display the 
bag’s contents in one image
Checkpoint-friendly bags should help speed up 
the screening process as well as protect your 
netbook from bumps and scratches as it rides 
on the conveyor belt.
TSA has trained its screeners to recognize 
these bags, and they’ll be labeled as such by 
the manufacturer. 

191
 Chapter 12: Carrying Your Netbook
I look for several things in a good netbook case:
 
✓ Decent level of padding in the computer compartment
 
✓ Plastic lining to keep rain and moisture off the netbook
 
✓ Adjustable strap to provide a secure fit in the computer compartment
 
✓ Comfortable, padded shoulder strap
 
✓ Good closures on flaps and pockets so they don’t come open
 
✓ Durable materials (I personally like Cordura and ballistic nylon.)
You can spend anywhere from $25 to several hundred dollars on a netbook 
case. Inexpensive, mass-produced cases are fine if you infrequently carry 
your netbook. If your little laptop goes everywhere with you, I recommend 
investing in a better quality carrier — expect to spend between $50 and $100.
 
Figure 12-2: 
A netbook 
case.
 
DVD cases
My favorite low-budget way to protect and carry a netbook is with a case 
designed for a portable DVD player. The dimensions of many netbooks hap-
pily match the size of different types of travel DVD players. Because of the 
popularity of these players, you can find a lot of nice, padded cases on the 

192
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
market that don’t cost an arm and a leg — it’s easy to find something under 
$20. I personally like the Case Logic brand. These products can be had for 
under $20 — an example is shown in Figure 12-3.
 
Figure 12-3: 
A DVD 
case makes 
a good, 
low-budget

Other padded cases
In addition to cases primarily designed for electronic devices, it’s worthwhile 
to check out other types of padded cases that can safely hold a netbook, 
such as the following: 
 
✓ Camera cases: A number of excellent 35mm camera bags on the market 
offer a perfect fit for netbooks. (See Figure 12-4.)
 
✓ Messenger bags: Messenger bags are shoulder bags originally designed 
for bike messengers. More and more models, large and small, are featur-
ing padded compartments for netbooks and laptops.
Expect to pay between $50 to $150 for these types of cases.
 
If a case is a little skimpy on the padding, don’t hesitate to beef it up. Fabric 
stores sell different types of foam you can install to add more shock absorbing 
properties. With a little glue, custom-cut foam, and patience, you can even 
turn an unpadded bag or case into a suitable carrier.

193

Hard cases
If you’re venturing off the beaten track and bringing your netbook with you 
while you climb Everest, sail around the world solo, ride a dog sled to the 
arctic (before it melts), or blog about the war in Afghanistan, you’ll want 
something a little more rugged than your standard-issue, soft carrying case. 
Perhaps I can interest you in a little waterproof number that’s shock resistant 
and can be driven over by a truck without crumpling whatever is inside. Yes? 
Ah good, step this way. I have just what you’re looking for.
When the going gets tough, the tough turn to plastic. Not cheap plastic, mind 
you, but a strong and durable material called copolymer polypropylene — an 
example case is shown in Figure 12-5. Two companies dominate the market 
for very rugged, plastic cases for carrying all manner of precious things 
(including netbooks):
 
✓ Pelican: Pelican (www.pelican.com) is the big name in rugged, water-
proof, shock-resistant cases. These cases receive rave reviews from 
militaries, governments, and other professional users. The case in 
Figure 12-5 is made by Pelican.
 
✓ OtterBox: OtterBox (www.otterbox.com) has focused on building 
tough, waterproof cases for electronics devices — they also make some 
smaller cases similar in design to Pelican cases.
You can’t go wrong getting a case from either of these manufacturers. Just 
because the cases are made of plastic, that doesn’t mean they’re cheap. 
Depending on the size and features, expect to spend as much as you would 
on a conventional laptop case.

194
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
 
Figure 12-5: 
A Pelican 
case offers 
hard shell 
protection 
for your 
netbook.
 
 
Because many hard cases have carrying handles, it’s possible to use smaller 
models as bulletproof (not literally), daily carry briefcases — a pair of hand-
cuffs attached to the case and your wrist makes a nice accessory.
 
What’s with the valve on Pelican cases, you may ask? This has nothing to do 
with netbooks, but here’s the story: This is a pressure-relief valve. If the case 
is shut and sealed at a low elevation and then taken to a very high place (or 
travels in an un-pressurized aircraft), the ambient pressure outside the case 
drops. If a large enough drop occurs, a normal case would start to bulge, 
blow a gasket, and would no longer be waterproof, or even pop open. The 
relief valve on the Pelican case prevents this from happening. Unless you 
have this specialized need, as the military does, forget about the valve. For 
most people, it will never serve its purpose.
Unconventional cases
Think outside the box (or in this case, the bag)! 
Many cases and containers not designed spe-
cifically as netbook carriers fit the little laptops 
like a charm. You can usually score one of these 
unconventional cases for cheaper than a case 
sold specifically for netbook use. Plus, they’re 
the ultimate in low-profile stealth — who would 
expect you’re packing a computer in one of the 
following:
 ✓ Hardware store tool bag
 ✓ Bible case (from Christian bookstores)
 ✓ Padded lunch sack
 ✓ Military surplus gas mask or map bag
 ✓ Nintendo Wii soft carry bag
 ✓ Rectangular candy tin (with glued in 
padding)
That should give you some ideas to be on the 
lookout for other unconventional cases. Don’t 
be afraid to find something unique that matches 
your personality.

195
 Chapter 12: Carrying Your Netbook
For the Do-It-Yourselfer
If you’re on a tight budget (and who isn’t these days?), instead of shelling out 
bucks for a commercial carry case, how about making one of your own? If 
you’re handy or know someone who is, give one of these inexpensive projects 
a try. After all, you don’t necessarily need to be a lawyer to make your case.
Sew it yourself
If you have a sewing machine and someone who knows how to use it, it’s 
easy to make your own custom netbook carrier or sleeve. To get you started, 
here’s a great illustrated tutorial for making your own netbook carrying case 
out of fabric: http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=13300. 
This is for an Eee PC, but it’s easy enough to adapt the pattern to your own 
netbook.
Modify an old planner
If you have an old, zippered binder planner (like a Day-Runner) lying around 
that isn’t getting much use, see whether the dimensions fit your netbook. It 
takes about five minutes of minor surgery with a pair of pliers to remove the 
interior metal 3-ring clip. When the clip is removed, slide your netbook in, zip 
it up, and you’re ready for the road. (See Figure 12-6.)
 
Check out this Web page from Instructables.com for step-by-step direc-
tions, including photos: www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-
simple-carrying-case-for-the-Asus-Ee.
Wrap it in bubbles
Shortly after buying my first netbook, I remember getting a call about a short-
notice opportunity to visit a third-world country and travel around in a Land 
Rover — both the country and the truck turned out to have seen better days. 
I wanted to bring the netbook with me but was afraid of it getting trashed 
by all the bumps and dust. With no time to buy a sleeve, I wondered what 
Macgyver would do under similar circumstances. Voilà! Some old bubble 
wrap cut to shape, a little duct tape, the netbook stowed safely in a couple of 
zip freezer bags, and I was ready to go. It didn’t look pretty, but the netbook 
survived the trip.

Pad it with an envelope
Although I wouldn’t want to send my netbook through the mail this way, 
a mailing envelope with the inside padded either foam or bubble wrap 
makes a cheap, quick-and-dirty sleeve. The folks at Instructables have an 
even more deluxe version of the same general idea. Check it out at www.

Powering Your Netbook
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering battery basics
▶ Human-powered netbooks
▶ Using cigarette lighter adapters and inverters
▶ Solar-powered netbooks
▶ Taking advantage of power-saving tips and tricks
You obviously need electricity to directly run your netbook or charge 
its battery. Without power, your little laptop is just a high-tech, plastic 
paperweight — it looks cool, but that’s about it.
Most people find that the battery and wall charger included with their net-
book meet all of their power needs. But what if there’s no electric outlet 
nearby? What if you’re always on the go and a single battery doesn’t cut it for 
your computing needs? What happens when the battery that came with your 
netbook finally gives up the ghost? What if . . . ?
All good questions that I’m glad you asked. You’re in luck, because this chap-
ter is all about ways to power your netbook. I cover batteries (of all different 
types), charging and running your netbook while on the road (or in the air), 
some sustainable energy options, and I wrap up with tips for maximizing 
battery life.
Tackling Battery Basics
Unlike a desktop PC that spends its entire life tethered to a power cord and 
electrical wall socket, your netbook is designed to go places. Thanks to its 
small size, you can use it just about anywhere — that is, as long as you have 
a charged battery.

198
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
In the following sections, I give you the juice on batteries. Maybe, after lots 
of use, your netbook’s battery has decided to throw in the towel. Or perhaps 
you’ve found that one battery doesn’t cut it on transoceanic flights, long 
commutes, or day outings at the beach. If you need a battery, this is where 
you can find out about your options.
Current concepts
Before charging up your brain cells with some battery basics, you need to 
know a few important terms and concepts that relate to your netbook’s 
battery (or any laptop’s battery, for that matter):
 
✓ mAh: This stands for milliampere-hour, a measurement of how much 
energy is stored in a battery. Generally, the bigger the mAh number, the 
longer the battery life — and the more expensive the battery.
 
 Battery life also depends on what you’re doing. A netbook with a lower 
mAh battery rating may run longer than the same netbook with a higher 
capacity battery — that is, if you were word processing with the wireless 
card turned off, compared with watching videos and surfing the Net at 
the same time, which requires more power.
 
✓ Cells: Even though laptop batteries look like one big battery, they 
aren’t — see Figure 13-1. They’re composed of a series of cells (smaller, 
individual batteries) that are connected inside the sealed plastic case. 
More cells typically mean longer battery life — they also make the 
battery heavier and more expensive than batteries with fewer cells. 
Manufacturers almost always list how many cells are in a battery. 
Netbooks are typically powered by three- or six-cell batteries.
 
 Don’t think that having the same number of cells makes batteries the 
same. For example, a four-cell battery may come in 4,400, 5,200, and 
5,800 mAh models.
 
✓ Battery memory: You may have heard that batteries have memories 
and occasionally need to be fully discharged. Not true with lithium ion 
(li-ion) batteries, which most laptops use these days. They don’t have 
a memory (like older nickel cadmium batteries), and there’s no need to 
fully discharge them. Actually, to maximize battery life, li-ions should be 
charged when they’re down to around 50 percent capacity.
 
✓ Battery lifespan: Sooner or later, your battery is going to bite the dust. 
Batteries have a limited life span that depends on how many times 
they’ve been charged and how they’ve been maintained. As a battery 
starts to wear out, the amount of charge it holds slowly decreases — 
meaning you get fewer and fewer minutes of use, even though the 

199
 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
battery is fully charged. Eventually, the battery won’t power your laptop 
at all — or it will refuse to completely charge. Depending on use and 
how you take care of the battery, expect it to last one to three years.

Brand-name batteries
If you’re shopping for a new netbook battery (that is, if your old one didn’t 
seem to last very long and you need a replacement, or if you’re considering a 
second battery so you can use your little laptop longer), you’ll probably first 
turn to a battery that has the same name as your netbook’s manufacturer.
This makes sense because you know a battery from the manufacturer is guar-
anteed to work with your netbook. Manufacturer batteries are also covered 
by warranties, whereas third-party batteries may not be.
Prices for manufacturer batteries run $65 to $125 depending on capacity — 
it’s worthwhile to shop around on the Internet for the best deal.

Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
 
If your netbook was available in different colors, there’s a chance the batteries 
are too. Unless you’re going for a two-tone look, be sure to order one that 
matches.
Third-party batteries
An alternative to using a netbook manufacturer name-brand battery is to go 
with a third-party battery. Many “generic” batteries use the same compo-
nents as the original batteries that come with the netbooks — they may even 
come from the same factory as the name-brand battery. Because they don’t 
have the brand name on the label, they’re usually priced lower because of 
reduced business overhead costs.
Third-party batteries generally have the same mAh ratings as manufacturer 
batteries, but also may be available in even higher-capacity models. For 
example, some third-party netbook batteries have a rating over 10,000 mAh, 
and some batteries have nine or more cells.
 
When buying batteries that have above-normal capacity, always check a photo 
of the battery and its dimensions. In some cases, the battery may be physi-
cally larger than the one that comes with your netbook, — in that event, don’t 
expect a flush fit, because the bigger battery will stick out beyond the back or 
bottom of the case, increasing the overall size (and weight) of your netbook.
Before you buy a third-party battery (especially from eBay), check what 
people have to say about the battery and vendor in online reviews — Amazon.
com and forums devoted to a particular netbook are a good place to look. For 
example, Mugen Power Batteries (www.mugenpowerbatteries.info) has 
received a number of favorable reviews for its extended life batteries.
Burning down the house
No, I’m not talking about those exploding Dell 
laptop batteries back in 2006 — despite all the 
hype, only a few actual cases were reported. 
Instead, I want to mention that sometimes get-
ting netbook batteries can be challenging due 
to a weak link in the supply chain. Only a few 
plants make netbook (and laptop) batteries, 
and they seem to have bad luck when it comes 
to fires. In March 2008, a fire broke out at LG 
Chem’s Ochang, South Korea battery plant. This 
severely impacted ASUS, Dell, and HP laptop 
battery availability. The computer industry was 
already being impacted by an earlier fire in 
October 2007 at a battery factory in Japan that 
caused laptop battery shortages. If you find bat-
teries are backordered, it might be high-demand 
or another fire.

 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
Power to-go: Universal batteries
If you need extra juice, you don’t necessarily need to purchase a battery built 
expressly for your netbook. There are always universal batteries. These are 
external lithium-ion batteries that can power all sorts of electronic devices — 
MP3 players, cell phones, and other types of laptops — as well as your net-
book. After the universal battery is fully charged from an included AC or DC 
adapter, plug the battery into a netbook’s power jack (where you normally 
plug in the wall charger), and your little netbook runs on the external battery 
until it discharges. When the external battery is depleted, the netbook auto-
matically starts using its internal battery.
One of my favorite universal batteries is the Tekkeon myPower ALL product 
line (shown in Figure 13-2). Three models are available: 
 
✓ MP3700: Provides up to 20 volts, has a smart sensor that automatically 
determines the correct amount of voltage to use, a USB charging port, 
and can be expanded with a spare battery pack. Priced around $170.
 
✓ MP3450: Provides up to 19 volts, has a USB charging port, and can be 
expanded with a spare battery pack. Priced around $130.
 
✓ MP3300: A lower-cost model without all the features of the MP3450, but 
still provides up to 14 volts of power.

Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
I’ve found an MP3450 provides around three-and-a-half to four hours of power 
before my netbook’s internal battery takes over — your mileage may vary.
Universal batteries aren’t quite as lightweight and svelte as a netbook’s inter-
nal battery (they’re still very portable though), but they do offer more func-
tionality for around the same price. They’re especially a good deal if you have 
another laptop or need to power other portable electronic devices.

Human-powered netbooks
The One Laptop Per Child XO, which I consider 
the first netbook, originally was designed to be 
powered by a built-in hand crank. These com-
puters were destined for off-the-grid developing 
countries, and the engineers thought it would 
be smart to make the little laptops human-
powered. Unfortunately, the hand crank was 
dropped from production models due to reli-
ability issues and the fact it took a whole lot of 
cranking to charge up the battery.
If you want to power your netbook with muscle, 
you still have a number of options. Here’s a 
quick rundown.
One of my favorite human-powered electri-
cal device manufacturers is Freeplay Energy 
(www.freeplayenergy.com). The com-
pany started out producing rugged, hand-crank 
radios for use in Africa and third-world coun-
tries. Since then, they’ve expanded their prod-
ucts to a number of different human-powered 
gadgets. Weza (a Swahili word that means 
power) is built around a 12-volt lead-acid bat-
tery. You can charge the battery by plugging 
it into an electrical outlet or solar panel or by 
stepping on its foot treadle. FreeCharge 12V is 
a small, lightweight, 12-volt handheld generator. 
Attach a cigarette lighter adapter to your net-
book, plug it into FreeCharge, and start cranking 
(at 120 revolutions per minute or more) — be 
prepared for a couple of hours of cranking and 
some sore muscles afterward.
Another alternative-energy company called 
Potenco (www.potenco.com), has devel-
oped a pull-cord power generator, which 
should be easier to use than a crank device. 
At this time, it’s not commercially available, but 
hopefully will be soon.
The least-demanding human-powered way to 
run and charge your netbook is with a pedal-
powered power source. This is a stationary 
bike hooked up to a generator. As you pedal, 
the generator creates electricity that you can 
use to directly power an electronic device or 
charge a 12-volt battery. For more information 
on this option, check out Windstream (www.
windstreampower.com) and the do-it-
yourself Pedal Powered Generator (www.
los-gatos.ca.us/davidbu/pedgen.
html).
Have a good workout!

 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
Getting a Charge (Out of Your Car)
A car or truck can power your netbook and charge its battery — although 
when gas prices are up, it’s a pretty expensive generator. If you’re going to be 
on the road with your netbook, you have two options for keeping it charged: 
a cigarette lighter adapter (CLA) or an inverter. Here’s the lowdown on both.
Cigarette lighter adapters
Cigarette lighters first started appearing in cars way back in the 1920s — they 
were originally designed for lighting cigars; that’s why they’re the stubby size 
they are. Thanks to some design changes in the 1950s, it became possible to 
use the 12-volt, direct current generated by a car to power electrical devices 
connected to a CLA. By using a CLA like the one in Figure 13-3, you can run 
and charge your netbook.
 
CLAs have circuitry that converts the car’s 12-volt electricity into power that’s 
usable by a netbook. CLAs also have fuses to protect your little laptop in case 
a higher-than-normal amount of current comes through the lighter. Fried net-
books don’t smell or work all that well.

204
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
Many manufacturers offer CLAs for their netbooks — third-party models are 
often available cheaper. Another option is to use a universal DC adapter such 
as those sold by Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com). These units work 
with a number of different products — plugs are available to fit various elec-
tronic devices. A universal adapter and single plug should cost around $45.
 
If you use a universal, multi-voltage charger, be sure you use the correct volt-
age for your netbook — check the power rating label, which is usually on the 
underside of the case. A netbook’s power supply can handle a little over and 
under its rated voltage, but if you use too many volts, you risk damaging the 
computer. You also need to ensure the power tip is the correct polarity (such 
as the tip is positive and the outer sleeve is negative or the reverse). Always 
check a device’s user guide or online specifications to find out about its power 
requirements.
 
Some airlines offer DC power outlets in their seats (usually business and first 
class). If you do a lot of flying in addition to driving, CLA chargers are available 
that work in both car and plane receptacles.
Speaking of charging and flying, when I’m on the road, I always carry a small 
wall-socket plug with multiple outlets. Public spots in airports for recharging 
electronic devices are always at a premium, and a multiple-outlet plug lets you 
get karma points by sharing the juice from a single outlet with other travelers.
Sine language
You may read Internet forum discussions about 
inverters, sine waves, and powering netbooks. 
Here’s what you need to know.
The two types of inverters are 
 ✓ True-sine wave inverters produce power 
like the kind you get from your electric com-
pany. When you look at the power wave 
through an oscilloscope, it appears as a 
smooth sine wave.
 ✓ Modified-sine wave (also called square 
wave) inverters are the most common type 
of inverter. They’re considerably cheaper 
than true-sine inverters and produce more 
of a squared-off looking wave.
 
 Modified-sine wave inverters work fine 
for powering laptops and most household 
appliances. True-sine inverters are required 
for devices that might have problems using 
an electrical current with a modified sine 
wave. These include fax machines, laser 
printers, plasma TVs, and other specialized 
devices.

205
 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
Inverters
Another option for powering your netbook while on the road is to use an 
automotive inverter. This device converts a car’s 12-volt DC (direct current) 
to 120-volt AC (alternating current) — what comes out of standard United 
States electrical outlets.
Car inverters (two are shown in Figure 13-4) provide one or more electrical 
outlets that work just like a wall socket. Just plug in any electrical device, and 
you can run it from your car’s electrical system. (When the car is running, its 
battery is being charged, so you don’t need to worry about it discharging.)

Inverters have different wattage ratings. The more watts an inverter can 
handle, the more it costs. Make sure you have a large enough inverter to 
accommodate the device(s) you plan on using. Because netbooks draw well 
under 30 watts, you can use a relatively inexpensive (around $20), 75-watt 
inverter.
 
All electrical devices (including netbooks) have a label that lists their wattage. 
If the device doesn’t show watts but lists only volts and amps, use this simple 
formula: Watts = Volts × Amps

206
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
The advantage to an inverter is you can use a variety of electrical devices 
with it and not need special plugs or adapters. Just plug in the wall wart 
(power adapter) that came with your netbook. Inverters are available in the 
automotive or electronics sections of most large chain stores.
 
Many car inverters now come with USB jacks, so you can charge MP3 players 
and other devices.
Power-Saving Tips
A lot of people instantly think a tiny computer like a netbook means long bat-
tery life. It’s so small that it can’t be using very much power and should run 
all day. Right?
Here comes the sun
How about going green and using the sun to 
power your netbook? Here are some things to 
know.
Those little solar panels used for charging cell 
phones and MP3 players aren’t going to charge 
your netbook — they produce well under 5 
watts. At the very minimum, you need a 25-watt 
solar panel to directly power your netbook while 
it’s running. It’s possible to use lower-wattage 
panels to charge your netbook’s battery while 
the laptop isn’t running.
A solar panel’s rated wattage is the maximum 
amount of power produced under the most 
optimal conditions. That means direct, bright 
sunshine. Add some clouds, and the wattage 
starts to fall off — the more clouds, the less 
power. Higher-panel wattage ratings (the more 
watts, the higher the price and larger the panel) 
increase the chances you’ll get the power you 
need in less-than-optimal conditions.
In addition to coming in different sizes, solar 
panels can be rigid or flexible. Figure on spending 
$200 to $250 for a rigid, 30-watt solar panel and 
around double that for a flexible panel with the 
same output. (Solar panels are coming down in 
price, but aren’t cheap yet.)
When you’ve picked out a panel (or several, 
because you can combine them) you need to 
decide whether you’ll power your netbook 
directly from the panel or from an external 
battery — the solar panel keeps the battery 
charged, which in turn powers your netbook.
There’s much more to solar-powering your net-
book than I have the space to discuss. Check 
out these Web sites for more information: 
Home Power Magazine (www.homepower.
com), SolarPower Forum (www.solarpower
forum.net), and OtherPower.com (www.
fieldlines.com/section/solar).

products are Modern Output (www.modern

 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
Not so fast; there’s a catch. Smaller computers tend to have smaller batter-
ies that don’t have as much capacity as bigger batteries in bigger laptops. So 
considering this, the typical battery life on netbooks tends to run anywhere 
from two and a half to around five hours. (Power-stingy processors like Atom 
increase battery life.)
While bigger batteries and miserly CPUs help extend battery life, laptops are 
like cars and gas mileage. “Your mileage may vary” — mostly depending on 
your driving (or computing) habits. Here are some tips to improve your bat-
tery life, giving you more smiles per gallon.
Turn off your netbook
Most folks have become accustomed to leaving their PCs turned on when 
they’re not in use — mostly out of convenience due to the painfully long 
amount of time it takes for a computer to start up and go through the boot 
process. (Standby and hibernation modes are both attempts to speed up 
restart time while saving power, and I talk about them next.)
However, a netbook’s speedy startup changes these rules. With super-fast 
boot times, there’s no reason to leave your computer turned on when you’re 
temporarily not using it, especially when you’re running on batteries and it 
may be awhile before a recharge.
Use standby mode
Although I recommend turning off your netbook to maximize battery life 
if you’re not going to be using it for awhile, sometimes you may want to 
use standby mode — this option is available in a dialog box when you use 
Windows to turn off your netbook.
In standby mode, power is reduced to various netbook hardware compo-
nents, some of the memory is stored to drive, and the laptop goes to sleep. 
When you resume (by pressing the power button), the netbook wakes up. 
After a few seconds, all the windows and programs you had open before 
you went into standby are restored. This is convenient if you have a lot of 
browser tabs open or are working with several documents. You don’t have to 
reopen them like you would if you turned off the laptop.
Just keep in mind that power is still being consumed in standby mode, 
although the amount is smaller compared with when the netbook is turned 
on and running.

208
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
In Windows, in addition to standby mode, you also have an option called 
hibernation. Hibernation mode saves memory to disk like standby, but then 
turns the computer completely off (instead of reducing power). When the PC 
is turned back on again, the boot process is skipped, and the stored memory 
contents are restored. You can enable hibernation and set other power con-
serving preferences by clicking Power Options in the Windows Control Panel. 
Refer to Windows online help for more information on hibernation. 
Use low power settings
Some netbooks have an option to control the processor speed. The faster a 
processor runs, the more power it consumes. If the speed is reduced, perfor-
mance is decreased, but battery life goes up. On models that support chang-
ing the clock speed, you can speed up or slow down the chip in the BIOS or 
a separate utility program. Check your user manual to see whether your net-
book supports this feature.
Turn off Wi-Fi
If you don’t need a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet (say you’re just doing 
some basic word processing) and your netbook’s wireless status light is on, 
the built-in wireless card is sipping away precious battery power. Even when 
you’re not connected to an access point, the wireless card is still powered up 
and is sending and receiving data.
If you don’t need Wi-Fi, turn it off. (Check your user manual for instructions. 
This is usually a function key. When you press the function key again, wire-
less is available — the status light will be illuminated.)
 
If your netbook supports Bluetooth and you’re not using it, turn it off too. 
Check your user manual for instructions.
Dim the display
In addition to the wireless card, your netbook’s monitor is another culprit in 
eating away at battery life. The brighter the screen display, the more power is 
required. You guessed it: You can maximize your battery time by reducing the 
screen’s brightness. Dim your screen to a usable level — there’s typically a 
function key that does this; check your user manual.

209
 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
Treat your battery right
Many people tend to take electronic device batteries for granted. When they 
get long in the tooth and no longer hold a full charge, the battery (or some-
times the device) gets replaced. I won’t get up on a soapbox about our dis-
posable society.
Batteries are pretty complicated chemical power storage devices, and how 
you treat them directly impacts their longevity. As a battery ages, its storage 
capacity diminishes, so it makes economic and environmental sense to keep 
it healthy. Here are a few tips to maximize long-term battery life:
 
✓ Keep them cool. Lithium ion batteries exposed to high temperatures 
have shorter lives. Keep batteries out of the sun and very warm loca-
tions. If your netbook feels like it’s starting to get overly hot, consider 
removing the battery. (You need a nearby wall socket to run on AC 
power.)
 
✓ Don’t run them dry. Completely discharging a battery decreases its life. 
Like a car, always leave a little extra in tank before you need a fill-up.
 
✓ Recharge them often. Don’t be shy about plugging into a wall socket 
and recharging your battery, even when it’s only partially discharged. 
Laptop batteries like to be treated this way.
 
✓ Keep the contacts clean. If you swap your batteries a lot, dirt and grime 
can build up on the contacts, preventing electrons from flowing freely. 
Every few months, use a cotton swab and alcohol to clean dirty battery 
contacts.
 
✓ Use it or lose it. Don’t leave a charged battery sitting around unused for 
long periods of time as it will slowly discharge even though it’s not being 
used. Fully discharging batteries shortens their lives. After it’s charged, 
use the battery at least once every two to three weeks.
 
If you really want to get geeky about the technical aspects of batteries (trust 
me, it’s fascinating), pay a visit to Battery University at www.battery
university.com.
Disconnect USB devices
The USB ports on your netbook (or any computer, for that matter) are 
powered. Each port makes up to 5 volts available, so anytime you have a 
USB device connected to your netbook, it’s drawing electricity. And when 
you’re not plugged into a wall socket, that power is coming from the battery. 

210
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
How much depends on the device. A USB flash drive may draw only a small 
amount of power, whereas an external DVD player without its own power 
source consumes much more.
As a general guideline, if you have an SD card or a USB thumb drive plugged 
in the entire time while using a battery, you’ll lose from 5 to 15 minutes of 
power. An external USB hard drive consumes about 20 to 35 minutes of bat-
tery time. Your mileage will vary, but the more time a drive is accessed for 
read and write operations, the more power it needs.
The bottom line is if you’re not using the USB device, unplug it. The same 
holds true for the card reader — remove the SD card if you’re not using it. 
Even with low-consumption devices like memory drives and cards, every 
electron counts.
 
Some USB hard drives and DVD players require two USB ports to run. They 
come with a splitter cable that plugs into two of the computer’s USB ports and 
then into the device. With these devices, this means the power from a single 
port doesn’t provide enough juice to run the device. This isn’t a big deal with 
a desktop PC, but it is with a battery-powered laptop. If you have a choice, 
external USB devices that require only a single port are much more battery 
thrifty. 
Don’t use animated screen savers
Using my trusty Kill A Watt meter (www.p3international.com, a slick 
device that measures how much power electric appliances use), I discovered 
something really interesting. Animated screen savers (on all kinds of comput-
ers) consume about twice as much power as just a blank screen. It makes 
sense, because the processor has to work harder drawing all of those intri-
cate geometric shapes and flying icons of various types. A harder-working 
CPU needs more electricity, so if you use a screen saver, stick to one without 
animation.
Use a wired Ethernet connection
If you have a choice of connecting to the Internet either wirelessly or wired, 
pick the cable. The netbook’s built-in Ethernet card requires less power than 
the internal Wi-Fi card. (Also, don’t forget to turn off the wireless card to be 
really battery frugal.)

211
 Chapter 13: Powering Your Netbook
Know what activities drain batteries
Your netbook doesn’t use the same amount of power for everything it does. 
Some activities require more electricity than others. (This is where a Kill A 
Watt meter is handy.) For example, these activities require more power than 
browsing Web pages, reading an e-book, or writing an e-mail:
 
✓ Watching videos
 
✓ Listening to music (the louder the speaker volume, the larger the bat-
tery drain)
 
✓ Connecting to external devices (such as hard drives and DVD player/
writers)
 
✓ Playing games with lots of graphics
If you’re trying to be a battery cheapskate because it will be hours before you 
can get to a wall socket for a recharge, keep the juice-sucking activities to a 
minimum.
Single task
Whether you like it or not, computers have taught people to become masters 
of multitasking. But guess what: Multitasking decreases battery life. The more 
programs and windows you have open at once, the more the processor needs 
to work. And the harder the processor works, the more power it requires. In 
addition, when you place a lot of demand on a processor, it generates extra 
heat. Heat degrades battery life (so does cold, by the way). Heat also causes 
the fan to come on, which uses even more juice. It’s quite the vicious cycle 
actually.
So if you’re away from a wall socket and you’re trying to save every possible 
electron, just do one thing at a time on your netbook. You may find the sim-
plicity is actually refreshing.

External Storage

W
hen the first generation of netbooks arrived, storage was extremely 
limited — solid state drives offered only a puny 4 to 8GB of space. 
Fortunately, a netbook’s SD (Secure Digital) card reader and USB ports pro-
vided all sorts of opportunities for adding badly needed storage capacity to 
the little laptops.
Things have gotten much better since then, and unless you have an older net-
book, space shouldn’t be as much of an issue — thanks to larger solid state 
drives and conventional hard drives in the 120-to-160GB range, and even 
larger.
However, it’s worth knowing about all the external storage options that are 
available for your netbook — whether you’re swapping data between com-
puters or accessing a media library filled with music and videos. In this chap-
ter, I give you lowdown on using your netbook with external storage devices.
SD (Secure Digital) Cards
I have yet to see a netbook that doesn’t have an SD (Secure Digital) card 
reader. In fact, built-in SD card readers are one of the features that define 
netbooks. On netbooks with small solid state drives, an SD card (shown in 
Figure 14-1) is a cheap, easy, and effective way to add more storage to a little 
laptop. Just press a card into the slot, and you have more space — the SD 
card appears in Windows Explorer just like a hard drive, and you can drag 
and drop files to it.

214
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
 
Figure 14-1: 
An SD card

mini and 
micro 
versions.
 
 
Some SD cards have a write protection tab. If you can’t save files to a card, 
check that the write protection tab hasn’t accidentally been switched on.
SD cards also offer a way to try out other operating systems on your netbook 
without overwriting Windows or setting up your system to dual boot. (Dual 
boot means installing a program that allows you to select which operating 
system to run in case you have several different types installed.) But before 
I talk about the specifics of using an SD card, it’s best that you have a basic 
understanding of memory cards.
Digital life
Nothing lasts forever, and the same holds true 
for memory cards. An SD card’s lifecycle is 
determined by three factors:
 ✓ Insertion/removal cycle: How many times 
you push the card into the reader and take 
it out. Many manufacturers figure 10,000 
insertion/removals is a realistic expectation.
 ✓ Read/write cycle: The number of times the 
card reader reads and writes data to the 
card. You’re good for about 1,000,000 read/
write cycles.
 ✓ Human factor: I’ve found this to be the big-
gest life limiter to memory cards — you 
lose them, your cat chews on them, they go 
through the washing machine . . . you get 
what I’m saying.

215
 Chapter 14: External Storage
Cavalcade of cards
Netbook SD card readers generally support three types of memory cards:
 
✓ SD— (Secure Digital): Flash memory cards that range from 8MB to 4GB.
 
✓ SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity): This is an extension of the SD 
standard that debuted in 2006. It allows for memory cards with capaci-
ties higher than 4GB. The SD and SDHC cards are identical in size and 
shape; however, older card readers can’t read the new format. (High-
capacity cards are labeled SDHC so you can tell the two cards apart.)
 
 Based on the SDHC specification, these cards can theoretically have up 
to 2,048GB of storage. Wow! However, at the present, card manufacturers 
have set a maximum of 32GB. Don’t be surprised if that goes up in the 
future.
 
✓ MMC (MultiMedia Card): SD and SDHC cards are derived from an older 
standard known as MultiMedia Cards. MMCs are slower and have less 
storage capacity. SD and SDHC cards have surpassed MMCs in popularity.
 
The same SD cards you use in your netbook are also used in digital cameras. 
For more details on memory cards, check out Steve’s Digicams (a digital 
camera Web site) at www.steves-digicams.com/flash_memory.html.
In addition to SD and MMC cards, a few netbook models also support less-
popular Memory Stick and XD cards. If you have a camera that uses these 
types of cards, it’s worthwhile to consider getting a netbook that supports 
them too.
Your digital camera or an older card reader may be able to read only SD 
cards. If that’s the case with your card reader, when you insert an SDHC card, 
it won’t be recognized. Keep this in mind if you’re going to be swapping the 
card between your netbook and another device. Card readers that support 
SDHC can read SD cards, but not vice versa.
SDXC
SDXC stands for Secure Digital Extended 
Capacity. This is a new memory card standard 
announced in 2009 that supports from 32GB to 
a whopping 2TB (that’s terabytes) of storage. As 
I write this, cards and compatible card readers 
for the new standard aren’t available yet. But 
I certainly expect them to start showing up in 
netbooks in the near future.

Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
 
If you have a mini or micro SD card (shown earlier in Figure 14-1), you’ll need 
an adapter to be able to use the card with your netbook’s card reader.
Ins and outs
Using an SD card with your netbook is simple. With the label facing up, insert 
the card into the card reader (with the metal connection points pointing 
toward the computer) until you hear it click in place. You may need to use 
your fingernail to press the card all the way in. When fully inserted, the card 
will be flush with the case.
To remove the card, press on it until you hear it click. The card reader 
is spring loaded, and the SD card will partially pop up. After the card is 
released, pull it all the way out of the card reader slot.
 
When you’re done using an SD card, be sure to use the Safely Remove 
Hardware command before removing the card — on the right side of Windows 
taskbar, right-click the icon with the small green arrow and then choose 
Safely Remove Hardware. This ensures all files are properly closed on the 
card before you eject it. You take the risk of possibly losing data or corrupting 
files if you remove a card without using this command. If Windows tells you 
the card can’t be removed, a file you’ve been working on is open or perhaps 
a Windows Explorer window is displaying the directory contents of the card. 
Close the file or window and try again.
Formatting SD cards
You can format an SD card in Windows in three ways:
 
✓ FAT16: FAT stands for File Allocation Table — in this case, 16-bit. This 
format dates back to the mid-1970s and was the primary file system for 
DOS and Windows. The maximum file size is 2GB.
 
✓ FAT32: An enhanced, 32-bit version of FAT that debuted in 1996 offering 
larger volume and maximum file sizes.
 
✓ NTFS: NTFS stands for NT File System. (Windows NT was the prede-
cessor of Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7 with NT standing for New 
Technology.) It’s now the standard file system for Windows, offering 
many improvements over FAT.
 
Most SD cards already come preformatted as FAT16 or FAT32, so you shouldn’t 
need to worry about initially formatting them.

217
 Chapter 14: External Storage
If an SD card you purchased needs formatting or if you have a card that 
doesn’t seem to work right, you’ll need to format it. Here’s how:
 
1. Insert the card in the reader.
 
2. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore.
 
3. In Windows Explorer, select the drive letter associated with the card 
you want to format.
 
4. Right-click the drive letter and choose Format from the shortcut 
menu.
 
 A Format dialog box appears.
 
5. Select the format type from the File System drop-down list and give 
the card a name in the Volume Label text box.
 
 Which format type you specify depends on how you use the card:
 
• If you’re only using the card with Windows computers, format it as 
NTFS.
 
• If you’ll be using the card with your netbook and another device 
(digital camera, cell phone, MP3 player, or a Mac or Linux com-
puter), format the card as FAT32.
 
6. Click the Start button.
 
 You’re asked whether you’re sure you want to format the card. 
 
7. Click OK to continue.
 
 A Format Complete dialog box appears after the card is successfully 
formatted.
 
If you want to use the SD Card Association’s (the SD standards group) official 
formatting utility, you can download a Windows version here: www.sdcard.
org/about/downloads.
Booting another operating system
Most netbooks allow you to boot from another operating system that’s 
installed on an SD card. This is handy if you want to see what Linux is all 
about without installing the free operating system over Windows or going 
through the hassles of setting up a dual boot system — do a Google search 
for dual boot to find out more.

218
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
 
Booting from another operating system can also be a lifesaver. If Windows gets 
corrupted or your netbook is infected by a particularly nasty virus, in many 
cases you can boot from Linux to recover files or repair damage.
Many Linux distributions are available in “live” system versions. That means 
they boot and run from a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or SD card, and you don’t 
need to install them on your hard drive.
 
When it comes to running another operating system on my netbook, I prefer 
SD cards because they are compact and fit flush in the case — you can easily 
leave an alternative operating system in the SD card reader, ready to use when 
needed.
Check some of the user forums that I list in Chapter 22 for Linux distributions 
that work well with your netbook. Two of my current favorites are
 
✓ Ubuntu Netbook Remix, www.ubuntu.com 
 
✓ Easy Peasy, www.geteasypeasy.com
Hot stuff
Some netbook users have encountered prob-
lems with corrupted files on SD cards or a 
card that won’t format properly. If this sounds 
familiar, the culprit may be excessive heat. On 
netbook models that run a little hot, it’s possible 
the card reader controller chip overheats and 
causes write problems — especially when 
writing large files.
This seems to be an intermittent problem that 
impacts only some netbook models — and even 
then, not all of them. If you’re having SD card 
issues similar to the ones I just mentioned, here 
are some things to try:
 ✓ Make sure the card isn’t defective. It’s not 
unheard of to get a bad SD card. Try using it 
on another computer.
 ✓ Make sure the card reader on the netbook 
isn’t to blame. Again, try using the card with 
another PC.
 ✓ Reformat the card.
 ✓ Placing a netbook on a soft surface can 
block the cooling vents, so keep it on a hard 
surface.
 ✓ Use a utility program to set the CPU volt-
age to a lower level. The lower voltage 
decreases CPU temperature, which lowers 
the overall heat. The tradeoff is that system 
performance is decreased because the pro-
cessor’s speed is lowered to run cooler.
 ✓ If you need to transfer large files, do so 
before the netbook starts to warm up.

219
 Chapter 14: External Storage
Here are the general steps for using an alternative operating system on your 
netbook:
 
1. Install the operating system on an SD card.
 
 Follow the instructions on the distribution Web site or from a user 
forum. You can install the operating system on an SD card using any 
computer that has a card reader.
 
2. Turn off your netbook and insert the SD card into the card reader.
 
3. Press the key sequence to force the netbook to boot from the SD card 
reader instead of from the hard drive.
 
 Check your user manual for details on which key(s) to use.
The operating system should load and run — if you’re asked whether you 
want to install the operating system, say no. You want to use the “live” ver-
sion, not install the OS to your hard drive. (A live version is a copy of an 
operating system designed to run on an SD card, USB flash drive, or CD-ROM 
without being installed on a hard drive.)
Have fun exploring Linux!
 
If you run Linux from an SD card and change any of the default system set-
tings, these settings usually aren’t saved when you shut down — a live version 
is a bit like a demo. If you’re going to be frequently using the operating system, 
you need a way to keep the settings persistent. This should be described on 
the distribution Web site or in a user forum post.
For a complete list, including descriptions, of just about every Linux distribu-
tion on the planet, visit http://distrowatch.com.
 
One of the main downsides to running an operating system from an SD card is 
that operating systems are always reading and writing data. Doing lots of reads 
and writes wears out an SD card much faster than a conventional hard drive. I 
can’t give you an exact timeframe, but I’ve heard of users needing to replace an 
SD card after running Linux daily on the card for six months to a year. If you’re 
going to be running Linux every now and then, using an SD card is fine. If you’re 
a heavy Linux user, look into a distribution that has been optimized to run on a 
flash memory device with limited reads and writes or bite the bullet and install 
the operating system on your hard drive — either standalone or dual boot.

USB Flash Drives
I’ll bet you remember the good old days when floppy disks were the tech-
nology of choice for saving files and moving data between computers. (And 
you get bonus points if you remember when those nifty 3.5-inch hard-cased 
floppy disks first appeared and started to replace their flexible 5.25-inch 
cousins.)
Alas, the poor floppy’s fate was sealed in 2000 when IBM and Trek 
Technology introduced a slick alternative to the ubiquitous floppy disk. The 
product was a flash memory chip with a USB connector enclosed in a small 
plastic case and dubbed the ThumbDrive. Plugged into a PC’s USB port, the 
drive offered a whopping 8MB of storage — around five times more than a 
3.5-inch floppy disk held at the time.
The rest is history, and USB flash drives (also known as UFDs, pen drives, 
jump drives, key drives, thumb drives, or in my family, brain suckers) have 
become a part of everyday computing — and have kept the tradeshow trash 
and trinket industry alive and well. 
Flash drives come in all sorts of shapes and sizes (as shown in Figure 14-2) 
and are available in capacities up to 64GB. (It’s difficult to find new drives 
under 1GB these days.) Storage space seems to always be rising with prices 
falling, and as I write this, if you shop around, you can get a 16GB thumb 
drive for around $40 or less.

You can find lots of USB flash drive reviews on the Web. A relatively compre-
hensive and recent one (May 2009) appeared in Ars Technica: http://
arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2009/05/usb-flash-drive-
roundup.ars. Search for flash drive reviews in Google to find more.
 
Both SD cards and USB flash drives use flash memory. Because more comput-
ers have USB ports than built-in card readers, flash memory in the form of USB 
drives is more popular for data storage — at least on personal computers.
Netbooks have two or three USB 2.0 ports (which are compatible with 
older and slower 1.1 USB flash drives as well as the more modern, faster 2.0 
drives). Just plug a flash drive into your netbook and use Windows Explorer 
to access the files.
 
When you’re done using a flash drive, be sure to use the Safely Remove 
Hardware command in Windows taskbar before removing the drive. I discuss 
this in the SD card “Ins and outs” section earlier in the chapter. 
Flash drives are perfect for
 
✓ Adding more storage space to netbooks with low-capacity solid state 
drives
 
✓ Backing up critical files on your netbook
Flash drive lifecycles
Like any storage media, flash drives aren’t 
immortal. Two primary factors determine how 
long of a life a flash drive will have.
The first factor is the type of flash memory used. 
The most common is called MLC (multilevel 
cell). There’s also SLC (single-level cell), which 
is twice as fast (as well as twice as expensive). 
SLC also boasts a longer lifecycle of 100,000 
write/erase cycles compared to MLC’s 10,000 
write cycles. (Unfortunately, most manufac-
turers don’t label their products, so you won’t 
know whether a more expensive thumb drive 
is using SLC.) 
Right around the maximum number of write 
cycles, a flash drive slowly starts to fail — parts 
of its memory will no longer able to be used. 
Many flash drives have a five-year warranty, 
and under normal use should last beyond that.
The other factor that limits a flash drive’s life is 
the USB connector. Manufacturers use a figure 
known as Mating Durability (I didn’t make that 
up) to predict the maximum number of connec-
tions before failure. That number is about 1,500. 
If you do the math, that’s using your flash drive 
once every day for a little over four years.

Most USB flash drives are formatted as FAT — see the “Formatting SD cards” 
section, earlier in this chapter, for more information. If you need to format a 
flash drive, the same principles and techniques used with SD cards apply.
If you store sensitive documents on a USB flash drive, I highly encourage 
you to use encryption to keep files safe. I tell you what you need to know in 
Chapter 9.
 
Some MP3 players can serve as a USB mass storage device (often referred to as 
MSC or UMS) — that means you can use it with your netbook to transfer and 
save files. Just connect the player to the little laptop with a USB cable, and the 
player’s memory or drive will appear as a volume in Windows Explorer. Check 
your MP3 player manual for more information.
U3
A number of USB flash drives come with some-
thing called U3 — no, this isn’t a band formed 
by the offspring of Bono and the other founders 
of rock legend U2. 
U3 (www.u3.com) is a technology for auto-
matically launching programs stored on a USB 
flash drive. It uses a program called LaunchPad 
that runs whenever the flash drive is inserted 
into a Windows computer. The idea is for U3 
compliant programs to cleanly run on any 
Windows PC. Normally, program settings are 
written to the Windows registry, which makes 
it difficult to install a program on a flash drive 
and be able to move it from one computer to 
another with all the settings intact. U3 and 
compatible programs (a list is here: http://
software.u3.com) address this issue.
I’m personally not a big fan of U3 — I’ve expe-
rienced compatibility issues with various hard-
ware and software, I don’t like memory and 
storage space being taken up by something 
I don’t use, plus the original version left a bad 
taste in my mouth because it was next to impos-
sible to uninstall. For program portability, I’m 
much more in favor of the Portable Apps (www.
portableapps.com) approach. Unless you 
have a compelling reason to keep it, I recom-
mend removing U3 from your flash drive — 
either run the uninstaller program or visit the 
drive’s support Web site for instructions.
Microsoft and SanDisk are currently working 
on a replacement for U3 called StartKey. I’ve 
got my fingers crossed it won’t have as many 
issues as U3.

223
 Chapter 14: External Storage
 
If you’re a Windows user who frequently defragments your hard drive to 
keep it running smoothly, don’t bother defragmenting your USB flash drive. 
Defragmentation works by optimizing access to data on a drive with spinning 
platters and moving heads. Flash memory has no moving parts and is 
random-access, so you don’t get any performance gains with defragmenting. 
Additionally, because defragmentation moves data around for optimization, 
the write/erases decrease the flash memory’s life. (See the “Flash drive life-
cycles” sidebar.)
USB Hard Drives
USB ports make life easy when it comes to adding external storage to your 
netbook. A USB hard drive is a traditional hard drive (the same kind you find 
inside a desktop PC or laptop) with an enclosure and USB cable. Just plug 
an external hard drive into your netbook (or any other computer) and like 
magic, more gigabytes appear.
 
If you’re interested in upgrading your netbook’s internal hard drive, be sure to 
check out Chapter 18.
You can get two types of external USB hard drives for your netbook:
 
✓ Mobile: These drives have a small enclosure (small enough to fit into a 
pocket) and are designed to be carried around easily. They have limited 
storage capacity (generally in the 160 to 500GB size range and increas-
ing) but typically don’t require a separate power source.
 
 Choose a mobile USB drive if your netbook has a low-capacity solid state 
drive and you want to bring more storage with you on the road (or any-
time you want to bring a large amount of data with you).
 
✓ Desktop: These are larger drives, both in terms of capacity (1 terabyte 
models are common) and enclosure size (bigger cases to handle the 
bigger capacity drive). Examples of desktop and portable USB drives are 
shown in Figure 14-3.
 
 Choose a desktop model for archiving files or if you don’t need to bring 
extra storage capacity with you. For example, instead of keeping your 
entire music or video collection on your netbook, store it on a larger 
desktop USB drive and keep only some of the files on your netbook.

224
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
Both types of drives are easily moved from one computer to another and 
make great backup solutions.
 
Hard drives operate at different speeds — measured in RPMs (revolutions per 
minute). The faster a hard drive platter spins, the faster the data access. Most 
PC hard drives run at 5,400 RPM. You generally pay a little extra for a 7,200 
RPM drive.
 
USB external drives are slower than internal hard drives. For day-to-day com-
puting, the speed difference isn’t that noticeable. However, if you transfer a 
large number of files or a single big file, you’ll definitely see a lag.

225
 Chapter 14: External Storage
 
When you’re done using a USB hard drive, before unplugging it be sure to use 
the Safely Remove Hardware command in the Windows taskbar. My editor 
thinks I’m sounding like a broken record with this, but it’s a good habit to 
have. See the SD card “Ins and outs” section earlier in the chapter for more 
information. 
 
If you have an IDE or SATA internal hard drive from an old PC lying around col-
lecting dust, consider turning it into a cheap desktop storage device for your 
netbook. Just pick up a USB IDE adapter. Plug one end into the old hard drive 
(or an old internal CD or DVD drive for that matter), hook up the included 
power supply if needed, and then plug the USB connector into the netbook. 
The adapters are reasonably priced under $25 and are available from a 
number of online retailers. Do a Google search for usb ide adapter. If you don’t 
like the unsightly appearance of a naked hard drive, do a Google search for 
hard drive enclosure for places to purchase an inexpensive plastic case.
CD-ROM, DVD, and Blu-ray Drives
The last stop on this tour of netbook external storage devices is in the opti-
cal department — not glasses, but optical storage. These devices include the 
CD-ROM, DVD, and Blu-ray family of drives — all of which use a small beam of 
laser light precisely focused on a spinning disc that stores the data.
USB power considerations
USB ports not only transfer data back and forth, 
but can also provide power to a connected 
device. (That’s what an external drive is get-
ting its juice from, unless it uses its own power 
supply.)
Ideally, you plug a USB hard drive or DVD 
into your netbook and everything works, with 
the files and folders all displayed in Windows 
Explorer. However, to function correctly, some 
drives need more power than a single USB port 
can provide.
This is addressed with either an external power 
source (especially with larger capacity drives) 
or a special USB Y-cable. You plug the two 
ends of the Y-cable into two netbook USB ports 
and the single end into the drive. This supplies 
enough power to run the drive from the two net-
book ports.
Drives that require power from a single USB 
port are more energy efficient, which means 
longer battery life when you’re not plugged into 
a wall socket. They also don’t tie up a second 
USB port. If you have a choice, always go with 
a drive that needs only a single cable. 

226
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
Unlike traditional laptops, netbooks don’t come with a built-in optical drive — 
considering the size, there’s no place to put it, plus manufacturers try to keep 
netbook costs down. Realistically, in its role as an ultra-portable laptop, you 
can easily get by without ever needing an optical drive for your netbook.
However, there are a couple of reasons that might lead you to purchase an 
optical drive, such as wanting to
 
✓ Watch movies on commercial DVDs.
 
✓ Restore your system from the recovery DVD that came with your computer.
 
✓ Access files you have stored on DVDs and CD-ROMs.
Before I discuss specifics, it’s good to have a basic understanding of the three 
types of optical storage media that are currently available:
 
✓ CD-ROM: Compact discs were the first widely used optical storage 
media. Depending on the type, a CD-ROM (read-only memory) can store 
between 650 and 900MB of data.
 
✓ DVD: Digital versatile discs (formally DVD-ROM) followed CD-ROMs and 
can store 4.7GB of data on a single-sided disc.
 
✓ Blu-ray: These discs (the name comes from a blue laser the technology 
uses) are the latest in optical storage and can store a mammoth 25GB of 
data on a single-sided disc.
Two types of drives are available for these storage mediums:
 
✓ Read only: Like the name suggests, a read-only drive can view only 
data — like a DVD or Blu-ray player you hook up to your television. You 
can’t write data with these types of drives. These days, most optical 
drives for computers are read/write, which I describe next.
 
✓ Read/write: These drives can both read and write data — they’re often 
called burners. With each of the optical storage medium types you can 
buy blank, writable discs — either writable once or many times. Files 
can be written to but not deleted from a disc labeled with R (such as 
CD-R). Files can be written and deleted from discs labeled with RW.
USB versions of optical drives are available, and it’s just a matter of plug-
ging them into your netbook to get them running — of course check the user 
manual for installation instructions.
 
Drives are generally backwards compatible. That means a DVD drive can use 
both DVDs and CD-ROMs, or a Blu-ray drive can access Blu-ray, DVDs, and 
CD-ROMs. However, always check the manufacturer’s specifications for com-
patibility information.

227
 Chapter 14: External Storage
Because of backwards compatibility, CD-ROM drives have gone the way of the 
dodo and have been replaced by DVD drives. For netbooks, I recommend a 
portable USB DVD drive such as the one shown in Figure 14-4. (This is an LG 
model GSA-E50N, by the way, which is very popular with netbook users and 
works quite well with both Windows and Linux models.) Portable DVD drives 
are priced between $100 and $150 and are available online or from most large 
electronics retailers.
 
If you have an old internal DVD drive from a desktop PC or laptop, you may 
be able to connect it to your netbook with a USB IDE adapter. See the previous 
section on hard drives to find out more.
Although Blu-ray is the wave of the future, netbooks aren’t quite up to speed 
yet — at least when it comes to viewing Blu-ray videos. At present, most net-
books don’t come with high-performance graphics chipsets that allow you to 
watch high-definition videos. Unless your netbook has a faster processor and 
compatible graphics chipset, for now I’d stick with a DVD drive and pass on 
Blu-ray.

Blinging Out Your Netbook
Is your netbook’s appearance a little too ho-hum for your personal tastes? 
Perhaps you’re tired of your netbook looking like everyone else’s. Then how 
about adding a little bling to your netbook and turning it into a work of art 
like the one shown in Figure 15-1? You don’t even need to be an artist or have 
a creative bone in your body.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Use a 
decal to 
personalize 
your

(This decal 
came from 
Schtickers.) 
 
You too can put a temporary tattoo on your netbook (or any laptop) thanks 
to a number of companies that offer decals designed to uniquely personal-
ize your PC. Commonly referred to as skins, these aren’t the cheap bumper 
stickers you see around town during election time. Instead, they’re quality 
vinyl decals with a reusable adhesive that doesn’t leave messy, sticky goo 
when you pull them off. Priced around $20, they come in solid colors, fine art 
prints, nature scenes, you name it — you can even submit graphics files to 
create your own custom decals.
Here are several skin sources to check out:
 
✓ Schtickers, www.schtickers.com
 
✓ DecalGirl, www.decalgirl.com
 
✓ GelaSkins, www.gelaskins.com
 
Most companies offer skins to fit standard laptop and netbook screen sizes — 
remember, you can always trim a larger decal. If you have a smaller screen 
netbook (7 to 9-inch screens) and can’t find a skin to fit, order a custom 8.5 x 
5.5-inch skin — you shouldn’t need to do any extra cutting.

commercial print shop (like FedEx/Kinkos) and have someone print the file 
on an 8.5 x 11-inch clear adhesive label. Carefully cut the label to match your 
netbook’s dimensions, and presto, a custom skin for less than a couple of dol-
lars. (Consider getting two labels: one for the skin and the other to stick over 
it as a protective layer.) This do-it-yourself approach works great with white 
netbooks, but it leaves a little to be desired appearance-wise on darker-colored 
models. If you have a black or dark-color netbook that you want to dress up, I 
recommend using opaque white labels.
 
Your netbook manufacturer may offer personalized netbooks off the shelf. For 
example, Dell’s Design Studio (www.dell.com/designstudio) allows you 
to choose from different designs that can be applied to your netbook’s case 
before it shows up on your doorstep.
Messing Around with Mice
Some people either dislike or can’t get used to a netbook touchpad. That’s 
perfectly understandable because a conventional mouse is easier to use and 
more ergonomic. A touchpad is designed to provide a semi-efficient way to 
control the cursor in a small package.
Netbooks with frickin’ laser beams
No, I’m not referring to Dr. Evil and his pet 
sharks. (Refer to the Austin Powers movies as 
needed.) I’m talking about using laser beams to 
customize your netbook case. The availability 
of relatively low-cost laser engraving machines 
has spurred a cottage industry of entrepreneurs 
who will burn text and images into the top of 
your favorite laptop’s case — without making 
a melty mess.
You submit the artwork, send in your laptop, 
and zzzzzzzzzap, your netbook gets a permanent 
tattoo. The appearance is stunning and cer-
tainly will set your netbook apart from anyone 
else’s. Expect to spend somewhere around one 
million dollars — not really, more in the $50-to-
$150 range, depending on the complexity of the 
image.
Do a Google search for laptop laser engraving 
to check out photos and find vendors or call a 
nearby trophy or engraving shop to see whether 
they can do the job locally for you.

Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
If you often use your netbook where you have the room for a mouse on the 
side, I say go for one. Here are your two choices:
 
✓ Cable: This is the tried-and-true mouse that comes with desktop PCs. 
If you have an unused USB mouse lying around from an old computer 
(who doesn’t?), just plug it in to your netbook — it immediately starts 
working. In addition to full-size mice, a number of companies make 
smaller computer rodents designed for laptops and travel use.
 
✓ Wireless: With wireless mice, there’s no cable — just like the mice in the 
kid’s song, they lost their tails. Instead, these mice work with radio sig-
nals that are sent between the mouse and computer. Wireless mice use 
either a proprietary transmitter/receiver that plugs into a USB port or 
rely on Bluetooth (either built-in or as an add-on).
 
When it comes to wireless mice, I’ve found Bluetooth mice to be a little less 
reliable than traditional wireless mice.
One of the more popular wireless mice for laptops and netbooks is Logitech’s 
VX Nano — shown in Figure 15-2. This mini-mighty-mouse runs on two AAA 
batteries and communicates with your netbook through a small dongle that 
plugs into a USB port. The dongle is teensy weensy and can be stored inside 
the mouse so you don’t lose it. VX Nanos are priced around $55.

Mice come in all sorts of colors, shapes, and sizes. The fancy ones have a 
range of different features, such as three buttons, scroll wheels, retractable 
cables, and lasers for more precise tracking. For a new mouse, expect to shell 
out between $25 and $100 — depending on the features, of course.

233
 Chapter 15: Netbook Gizmos and Gadgets
 
A wireless mouse consumes more power than its cousin with a tail, so if you’re 
trying to maximize battery life, go for a traditional cable mouse.
Contemplating Keyboards
During the early days of netbooks, probably the two biggest complaints 
about the little laptops were the small screens and the tiny keyboards — 
which caused lots of typos and cramped fingers for more than one user.
Thankfully the screen and keyboard issues are both addressed in today’s 
somewhat larger netbooks. However, the keyboard is still a problem if
 
✓ You have an older netbook and never got the hang of the undersized 
keyboard.
 
✓ You still can’t get used to any kind of a reduced keyboard size — even 
the 90 percent or larger versions.
 
✓ You like the reduced size and portability of a smaller netbook and can 
live with the keyboard for casual use, but you prefer a larger keyboard 
when it’s time for serious typing.
If you fall into any of these categories, I have just the solution for you: a USB 
keyboard. There are four types:
 
✓ Conventional: Do you have an ancient and unused desktop PC with a 
USB keyboard gathering dust in a closet? Just plug the keyboard into 
your netbook and start typing. It isn’t the most portable solution, but if 
you’re going to be on the road a lot, check out the reduced-size travel 
keyboards available for under $40.
 
✓ Folding: Travel-size keyboards are still a little too bulky for some 
people. If you’re one of them, an alternative is a folding keyboard, shown 
in Figure 15-3. As the name suggests, these keyboards fold in half when 
not in use. Models range from full to travel size and are priced in the $40-
to-$60 range.
 
✓ Bluetooth: If your netbook has Bluetooth, wireless keyboards are avail-
able for it. These keyboards are slick because you can position them 
anywhere within 30 feet or so away from your netbook. Prices range 
from $75 to $150, depending on the model and features.
 
✓ Roll-up: The last option is to forget about a rigid plastic keyboard and 
go with a soft, flexible keyboard that rolls up. These water-resistant 
keyboards (shown in Figure 15-4) are sold by several companies and are 
priced between $20 and $40. A downside is the soft silicone keys don’t 
make noise or have the tactile feel of a conventional keyboard.

Mastering Modems
With Wi-Fi, 3G wireless broadband, and cable/DSL modems, why on earth 
would you need a dialup modem? (Remember the funny chirping and 
screeching sounds they made?) Well, depending on where you are in the 
world, a dialup modem may be the only way to get Internet access. If you and 
your netbook are in such a situation, read on.
 
Be aware that getting a USB dialup modem to work under Linux is much more 
complicated than with Windows. You need to do a lot of configuration and 
may have to recompile the kernel. In fact, if you plan on getting a netbook and 
will be exclusively using a dialup modem, for the average user I personally 
wouldn’t consider a Linux model because of the high hassle factor.

235
 Chapter 15: Netbook Gizmos and Gadgets
Because netbooks don’t have a PC Card slot like many other laptops, you 
need a dialup modem that plugs into one of the USB slots. A popular USB 
modem that works with many Windows and Linux netbooks is the Zoom 3095 
V92 USB Mini modem, shown in Figure 15-5.
USB dialup modems are readily available and cost in the $40-to-$50 range.
 
A handful of netbooks have ExpressCard slots, a smaller, more up-to-date ver-
sion of a PC Card slot. If yours does, ExpressCard dialup modems are available.
With Windows netbooks, just plug in the USB modem and configure it in 
the Control Panel. Depending on the modem, you may also have to install a 
driver.
 
You may be able to use your cell phone as a modem with your netbook 
through a USB or Bluetooth connection. Visit the netbooks forums I list in 
Chapter 22 and see whether you can find any discussion threads that include 
your phone model.

Beefing Up with Bluetooth
Bluetooth has turned into the de facto standard for short-range wireless com-
munications. Compatible cell phones, GPS receivers, mice, keyboards, lap-
tops, PDAs, and other devices all use Bluetooth to exchange data over radio 
airwaves. (I discuss Bluetooth at length in Chapter 6.)
If your netbook doesn’t have built-in Bluetooth, you can buy an add-on 
adapter. I recommend going with one of the smallest Bluetooth adapters 
around, made by Mogo. (Figure 15-6 compares the Mogo adapter’s size with a 
Logitech wireless mouse dongle.)
 
Figure 15-6: 
The MoGo 
Bluetooth 
adapter 
(round) and 
the Logitech 
VX Nano 
adapter 
(square) on 
a netbook.
 
With any Bluetooth adapter, if you’re running Windows, first see whether the 
device works by plugging it in. If it doesn’t, follow the directions that came 
with the adapter and install the correct driver.
 
Getting a Bluetooth adapter to work with Linux is a bit more complicated. 
You’ll first need to enter some commands at the console and modify a system 
configuration file or two. Check one of the netbook user forums I list in 
Chapter 22 for more information.
Expect to pay between $25 and $50 for a USB Bluetooth adapter.

237
 Chapter 15: Netbook Gizmos and Gadgets
Headphones, Headsets, and Speakers
If you have an MP3 player, you can use its earbuds or headphones to jack in 
to your netbook and listen to some tunes — more about music in Chapter 8. 
If you don’t have an MP3 player and listening to music or watching videos on 
your netbook is starting to annoy your partner (who is trying to quietly read 
a book), maintain domestic tranquility with a set of headphones. Netbooks 
have the same size jack as MP3 players, and the marketplace is filled with 
headphones and earbuds ranging from under $10 to over $100.
 
All headphones and earbuds are not created equal. One my favorite sources 
for information on nonprescription hearing aides is a Web site with the in-
your-face name of Anything But iPod (http://anythingbutipod.com). 
This site focuses on MP3 players but also has extensive headphone reviews 
and a lively and informative forum (http://anythingbutipod.com/
forum/forumdisplay.php?f=22). You’ll find out you don’t have to spend a 
fortune on earbuds or headphones to get excellent sound quality.
If you use Skype or an instant messaging program that supports voice chat 
(see Chapter 10), you’ll want to invest in a headset for your netbook. This is a 
pair of headphones that has a microphone grafted on, as shown in Figure 15-7.
 
Figure 15-7: 
A headset 
is essential 
for netbook 
Skyping.
 

238
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
Sure, you can use your netbook’s built-in microphone and speakers, but then 
everyone can hear your conversation if you’re in a public place, you have to 
speak louder or crouch in toward the mic, and the sound quality isn’t that 
great. A lightweight, easy-to-carry headset is a must if you’re a Skyping net-
book road warrior. And a headset won’t cost you an arm and a leg — expect 
to pay anywhere between $15 and $75; the more you pay, the better the 
sound and features.
Speaking of speakers, the quality and size of built-in netbook speakers really 
depends on the netbook — brands and models vary quite a bit. Some speak-
ers are pretty tiny and sound tinny, but others are halfway decent. If the 
sound from your built-in speakers just doesn’t cut it, invest in some external 
speakers. The popularity of the iPod and other MP3 players prompted an 
explosion of external speaker options, ranging from cheap products that 
probably aren’t much better than your netbook’s to high-end speakers cost-
ing hundreds of dollars that integrate with home theater stereo systems.
One product that receives a big thumb’s up from serious geeks is the X-mini 
(www.x-mini.com) series of capsule speakers (shown in Figure 15-8). These 
lightweight, cool-looking, portable speakers are powered by a rechargeable 
battery (plug it into a USB port when it gets low) and produce amazing sound 
for such a small package. Hook two of them together (they’re priced around 
$25 a piece), and you’re ready for stereophonic melodies.

 Chapter 15: Netbook Gizmos and Gadgets
Bring On the Big Screen
In my opinion, netbooks make the perfect computer for training and presen-
tations. It’s easy to tote a lightweight netbook to a meeting, class, or confer-
ence; and with its VGA output, hooking up a netbook to an external monitor 
or projector is a snap. In the following sections, I share a few thoughts on 
using external monitors and projectors with your netbook.
 
Some netbooks come with high-definition HDMI outputs instead of VGA. If you 
plan to connect your netbook to a monitor or projector, make sure it will be 
compatible with the external display device you plan to use.
External monitors
Whether you’re going to connect your netbook to a 20-inch LCD PC monitor 
or a big-screen TV, getting the best and most viewable display on an external 
monitor is often a trial-and-error process. You’ll need to try a number of dif-
ferent monitor settings until you find the one that works the best — this is 
because your netbook supports only a handful of screen resolutions, unlike a 
desktop PC.
Generally, connecting to a traditional monitor with a 4:3 screen ratio (square in 
shape) produces the best results. With a more contemporary 16:9 ratio (wide-
screen) monitor, you may end up with a distorted image — if so, try changing 
the screen resolution in the display settings in the Windows Control Panel.
With any monitor connected to your netbook, if you get a grainy or distorted 
picture, keep on trying different settings until you get the best-looking picture.
 
External monitor resolutions that don’t match the resolutions your netbook 
can display will produce distorted images. This is because the pixels are no 
longer square, but elongated or compressed.
Projectors
Up until a few years ago, presentation projectors were bulky and expensive 
devices used only in universities, big corporations, and government agencies. 
Prices and sizes have both shrunk, and now portable home theater and busi-
ness projectors are readily available for under $1,000.

240
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
When it comes to netbooks, multimedia projectors (often called PowerPoint 
projectors) are a bit easier to deal with than external monitors. This is 
because the display devices support only standard resolutions. It’s usually 
just a matter of plugging a projector into the netbook and whatever is dis-
played on the screen appears on the wall.
 
Your netbook has a function key that controls the screen output. (Check your 
user manual for which key to use.) When you press the function key, it toggles 
through several different modes: netbook screen only, netbook screen and 
external display device, and external display device only. If you can’t get your 
netbook to work correctly with a projector, try pressing the function key that 
controls screen output a few times.
 
Always connect and turn on the external monitor or projector first and then 
turn on your netbook. If the netbook is running when the display device is 
plugged in, it may not work correctly with the external device.
Creating presentations on a netbook can be a bit challenging because of the 
small screen and small keyboard (on some models). I typically build a presen-
tation on a desktop PC or a full-size laptop and then copy it to my netbook.
 
If you’re using your netbook only to display presentations, you don’t need 
a full version of Microsoft Office and PowerPoint installed. Microsoft’s 
PowerPoint Viewer is a handy utility that plays presentations on any computer 
running Windows. PowerPoint Viewer 2007 works with Microsoft Office 2007 
and earlier versions of PowerPoint presentations. (You can also download 
older viewers that work with earlier versions of Office — they tend to be 
smaller if you’re trying to conserve drive space.) The program comes prein-
stalled on some netbooks or visit the Downloads section at http://office.
microsoft.com.
Flipping Channels
Just about everyone watches television over cable or on the Internet these 
days. However, now that the move to digital television has been completed 
(in the United States and elsewhere), it’s possible to use your netbook to 
watch TV without cable or an Internet connection using something called a 
TV tuner. Here’s the lowdown.
First off, you’ll be going for something known as OTA (over the air) TV 
channels — just like in the good old, pre-cable, rabbit ear antenna days. 
You won’t have access to hundreds of channels, only whatever’s available 
in your local area — or wherever you’re traveling.

241
 Chapter 15: Netbook Gizmos and Gadgets
A TV tuner is a hardware device that plugs in to your netbook’s (or any com-
puter’s) USB port. These are usually priced between $50 and $100. You’ll want 
an ATSC tuner.
 
ATSC stands for Advanced Television Systems Committee. ATSC digital televi-
sion (DTV) is the format used for over-the-air digital TV broadcasts in North 
America, as well as South Korea and Taiwan. (If you’re somewhere else in the 
world, you’ll need a tuner that works for your location.)
The tuner receives digital TV broadcasts and decodes the signal so it can be 
played with Windows software supplied with the tuner. Some tuners give you 
the ability to record TV shows in MP4 format to watch later on your netbook 
or another computer.
Although most netbooks don’t have the speediest processors or graphics 
chips, many users report acceptable performance with a TV tuner connected 
to their Atom processor netbooks.
 
You’ll need an antenna to get the best signal reception out of a TV tuner. If 
your tuner didn’t come with one, they’re available online and at electronics 
stores. Make sure the antenna cable jack will fit the tuner.
Some manufacturers are starting to build tuners directly into their netbooks. 
For example, Dell offers an ATSC TV tuner as an option on some of its net-
book models.
I Saw the Light
Netbooks that don’t have backlit keyboards can be a real pain to use when 
the lights go out. Small keys and unusual key placement can leave you fumble-
fingered, and it doesn’t help peeking at a keyboard you can’t see.
To quote an old Robert Cray song, “Don’t be afraid of the dark.” Instead, pick 
up a USB-powered LED light. These handy little accessories are perfect for 
when the lights go down or out — LED bulbs also don’t need much power, 
thus prolonging battery life.
Go for a light that sports a flexible gooseneck so you can optimally position 
it. Depending on the model and features, prices range between $5 and $20. 
(Don’t be penny-wise and pound-foolish and pick up a dollar store variety. 
They often use low-quality LEDs and have cheap goosenecks that easily 
break.)

242
Part III: Netbook Add-On Accessories and Hardware 
In Case You Gotta Have More USB Toys
I’ve only scratched the surface when it comes to USB add-ons for your little 
laptop. You can find many other USB gizmos for your netbook (or any PC). 
Some are useful (coffee cup heaters, fans, and plug-in rechargeable AA batteries); 
others are entertaining (dancing robots, toy rocket launchers, and program-
mable LED signs). Most online computer accessory retailers have a large 
selection of USB toys. For excellent coverage of what’s available, check out 
Coolest Gadgets at www.coolest-gadgets.com/category/pc-gadgets/
usb-gadgets.
If you can’t help yourself and end up with more USB gadgets than will fit in 
your netbook’s two or three USB ports, pick up a USB hub — think of it like an 
electrical extension cord with multiple outlets, but for USB. You simply plug 
the USB hub into one of your netbook’s USB ports. This makes more ports 
available — four is a common number. Just remember, a single USB port is 
limited in the amount of power it delivers. If you have several USB devices 
that need power (external hard drive, DVD player, and so on), you need a self-
powered hub that has its own power supply.

you. I then step you through options for backing up and

Some netbooks allow you to upgrade storage (as in a solid 
state drive or hard drive) or system memory. I tell you 
what you need to know to perform these relatively easy 
operations.
In the second half of the part, I get a bit more technical 
and discuss the various Windows system settings related 
to netbooks, the essential drivers a netbook needs to run, 
and why knowing what BIOS is may be more important 
with netbooks than with other computers.

S
ometimes bad things happen to good netbooks — and their owners. 
Although I have my fingers crossed that you’ll be an exception, at some 
point or another, just about every netbook user will encounter some kind of 
glitch. It may be a small annoyance that you can easily live with or a colos-
sal problem of epic proportions that you need to fix immediately. Usually it’s 
something in between.
Just knowing about problems and how to fix them is often good juju for keep-
ing gremlins away. That’s what this chapter is all about. In it, I give you gen-
eral guidance on netbook troubleshooting. Then I cover some specific issues 
you may bump into with your netbook — and how to best remedy them.
How to Troubleshoot
Troubleshooting your netbook is as much of an art as it is a science. Keep 
in mind that you don’t necessarily need to be a computer guru with years 
of experience to solve a technical problem. What you need is a structured, 
common-sense, problem-solving approach. Like this one:
 
1. Collect the evidence.
 
 Treat your netbook problem like a crime scene. To solve the mystery, 
you need to collect evidence. That means writing down exactly what 

246
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
error messages say, determining what sequence of steps or events 
caused the problem to occur, and remembering whether you installed a 
new program, changed a system setting, opened an e-mail attachment, 
or visited a new Web site before the problems began.
 
 Consider yourself a crime scene technician — just like on CSI. As you 
collect evidence, you might have an “ah-ha” moment that will allow you 
to solve the case. If not, a more experienced detective (a Web forum 
member or manufacturer tech support person) should find the evidence 
valuable when coming up with a solution.
 
2. Read the user manual and online help.
 
 This probably sounds trite, but all too often the solution to a common 
problem is between the pages of a user manual — or online help. Take 
a moment to see whether the manual mentions anything that resembles 
your problem. (If you lost your user manual, visit the manufacturer’s 
Web site and download a PDF copy.) If you solve the problem this way, 
give yourself a pat on the back. If not, go to Step 3.
 
 Always give yourself a set amount of time to solve a problem by yourself. 
It’s easy to keep beating your head against a wall, trying the same thing 
over and over again while cursing in frustration. There’s a point of dimin-
ishing returns, and you need to know when to stop and ask for help.
 
3. Visit a Web forum.
 
 If you can’t figure out a problem on your own, pay a visit to a net-
book forum. I’ve found these Web sites invaluable for troubleshooting 
common and not-so-common netbook problems — especially forums 
that have a high number of posts and a lot of activity. I list netbook 
forums, many oriented to a specific manufacturer, in Chapter 22.
 
 These user forums are free — although you need to register to post a mes-
sage. Use the forum’s search feature to see whether any past messages 
relate to your problem: Enter a few key words that relate to your troubles. 
If you can’t find anything, post a question in an appropriate subforum. 
(Most forums have subforums devoted to different topics.) Give a clear 
description of your problem and list the evidence you collected. Over the 
next few days, check the post to see whether it received any replies. If 
your problem leaves everyone scratching their heads, go to Step 4.
 
4. Contact the manufacturer.
 
 I consider contacting the manufacturer a last resort step in netbook 
troubleshooting. I say this not to disparage the manufacturers but 
because I find that Web forums usually provide quicker and sometimes 
better-quality information — this doesn’t mean you should avoid manu-
facturer support, though.
 
 Manufacturers usually offer a smorgasbord of support options on their 
Web sites, including lists of frequently asked questions, searchable 
knowledge bases, community forums, and e-mail address and phone 

247
 Chapter 16: Troubleshooting Your Netbook
number contacts for technical support. I provide a list of netbook manu-
facturer Web sites in Chapter 22.
 
 If you e-mail or call a manufacturer, have your list of Step 1 evidence in 
front of you. The more information a support technician has about a 
problem, the better he or she will be able to diagnose what’s going on.
Troubleshooting Tools
When it comes to gathering troubleshooting information about your Windows 
netbook (as well as diagnosing and sometimes solving problems), I find that 
three system tools that come with Windows are indispensable: MSConfig, 
MSInfo32, and Windows Task Manager. These tools are available with XP and 
Vista and should also come with Windows 7 — Windows 7 has a slightly dif-
ferent appearance but still generally works the same.
Broken Windows
If something goes wrong with your netbook, it’s 
either a software problem or a hardware prob-
lem. If it’s a software problem (with a program 
or with Windows), that means there’s a bug, a 
setting was changed, a file got corrupted, or 
some malicious software like a virus is running 
amuck.
Here are some general suggestions you’ll likely 
hear from a technical support line for dealing 
with a misbehaving netbook:
 ✓ Run antivirus software. A malicious pro-
gram can cause your netbook to behave 
strangely. Check out Chapter 9, where I 
discuss virus protection software.
 ✓ Make sure you have the latest program or 
Windows updates. Software makers fre-
quently release updates that include bug 
fixes — perhaps one that’s related to your 
problem.
 ✓ Exit the program and shut down the net-
book. Sometimes a program has a bug that 
isn’t easily replicable. Try restarting your 
netbook and see whether the problem is 
still there.
 ✓ If you recently installed a new program 
and then started to encounter problems, 
uninstall the program. At times, programs 
can install files or change system settings 
that accidentally upset the apple cart, so to 
speak.
 ✓ Use an earlier Windows system restore 
point. Windows allows you to save a snap-
shot of the system state and then restore 
it. This is handy since you can go back to 
an earlier version of the system before 
you started having troubles. Search the 
Windows online help for restore point to 
find out more.
 ✓ Do a complete system reinstall. This is a 
last resort that I discuss in Chapter 17.

MSConfig
MSConfig is the Windows System Configuration Utility — shown in Figure

allows you to control them. This program is extremely useful for seeing what 
programs automatically run when your netbook starts up.
To run MSConfig in Windows XP, follow these steps:

MSInfo32
MSInfo32 (shown in Figure 16-2) provides system information about your net-
book. This utility is essential for nosing around the insides of your netbook 
and finding out about hardware and software. Even if you don’t know what 
it all means, if someone is helping you with a problem and asks for specific 
information, this program provides it. In addition to system information, 
MSInfo32 has some diagnostic tools.

Windows Task Manager
Windows Task Manager (shown in Figure 16-3) provides information about 
your netbook’s performance — including running programs, memory use, 
processor use, and network activity. The Task Manager can also be used to 
end programs that are unresponsive.
 
Be careful about terminating system processes. If you don’t know what you’re 
doing, you risk making Windows unstable.
You can start Windows Task Manager in Windows XP three different ways:
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Alt+Del and click Task Manager.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc.
 
✓ Right-click an empty area of the Windows taskbar and then click Task 
Manager.

Startup Problems
When it comes to solving specific netbook issues, I logically start with 
startup problems. I assume your netbook shows some form of life like a 
startup screen, active LED status lights, and so on. If it doesn’t, be sure to 
read the “Dead as a Proverbial Doornail” section at the end of this chapter.
If your netbook seems to be starting up slowly, there’s a very good chance 
you have too many programs running at startup time. You’d be amazed at all 
the utility programs various applications install — sometimes without your 
knowledge. On a low-memory computer like a netbook, these little startup 
programs not only cost start time, but also tax system memory and the pro-
cessor. See the earlier “MSConfig” section to see what programs are running 
at startup.
 
Many programs that appear in the Windows taskbar have a setting for option-
ally running the program at Windows startup (or not). Click or right-click a 
program icon in the taskbar and then go to the program options.
If your netbook starts up but never gets to the Windows desktop, there’s a 
problem with Windows. Fortunately, the operating system has a special Safe 
Boot mode that allows you to boot with minimal drivers and startup pro-
grams loaded — press F8 after you turn on your netbook. When you get to 
the Windows desktop, you can try to diagnose the problem or at least make 
copies of important files.

251
 Chapter 16: Troubleshooting Your Netbook
To find out more about Safe Boot, go to http://support.microsoft.
com/kb/316434.
 
If you can’t start up Windows with Safe Boot, you can always bust out an 
advanced move by booting the netbook with Linux. I discuss operating sys-
tems in Chapter 4 and provide information on booting with an alternative 
operating system.
Forgotten Windows Login Password
Say you set a Windows login password (which I recommend) and then you 
forgot it (which I don’t recommend). Don’t despair: There’s hope for using 
your netbook again.
First, make sure Caps Lock isn’t on when you log in. (Psst. Don’t worry: It hap-
pens to everyone.)
If Caps Lock isn’t on and you’re running Windows XP, you have a number 
of ways to log in to the netbook without a password. Check this handy 
how-to for one simple method that involves booting into Safe Boot mode as 
Administrator: www.wikihow.com/Log-on-to-Windows-XP-if-You-
Forget-Your-Password.
When you’re logged in, change your account password to something more 
memorable and consider writing it down in case there’s a future memory 
failure — yours, not the netbook’s.
 
If you set a BIOS password and forget it, this is going to make life a little more 
challenging. You need to remove the netbook’s BIOS battery — check an 
online forum for instructions. The BIOS battery is similar to the type used in 
watches and calculators. When it’s removed, it clears all the BIOS settings, 
resetting them to default values. Wait a few minutes, reinstall the battery, 
put your netbook back together, and turn it on. I tell you more about BIOS in 
Chapter 21.
Getting in Touch with the Touchpad
Some netbook touchpads seem to get moody, and for no apparent reason 
your cursor suddenly starts flying around the screen or maybe gets really, 
really slow. Another symptom of a touchy touchpad is when multiple copies 
of a program open when you double-click its icon.

252
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
If you’re having any unusual cursor and touchpad behavior problems, the 
touchpad settings need adjusting. Here’s how to do it in Windows XP:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
2. Click Printers and Other Hardware.
 
 Depending on how your copy of Windows is configured, this step may 
not be necessary.
 
3. Click Mouse.
 
 A dialog box is displayed with various setting tabs. 
 
4. Click a tab labeled touchpad (or similar) to access touchpad settings. 
 
 Here you control mouse and touchpad options. 
 
5. Change the touchpad sensitivity so the cursor behaves normally.
 
 This typically involves using a slider control to specify a lighter or 
heavier touch. If the cursor is flying around at the slightest touch, 
decrease the sensitivity. If you have to press hard to get the cursor to 
move, increase the sensitivity.
 
Most netbooks come with touchpad tapping enabled. This setting allows you to 
use the touchpad surface for clicking or double-clicking in addition to the touch-
pad buttons — for example, moving the cursor over a dialog box button and 
tapping the touchpad is equivalent to clicking the left touchpad/mouse button. If 
the tapping sensitivity is set too high, just about every time you brush the touch-
pad with a finger will be considered a mouse click. The cursor and windows 
will zoom around, and programs will mysteriously open. If this bugs you (it sure 
would bug me), change the sensitivity or turn off the tapping feature.
Webcam Issues
Some users have troubles with their built-in webcam not working. They try 
Skype or some other program that supports the cam but get a blank screen. If 
this happens to you, try these fixes:
 
✓ Check whether the webcam is enabled in BIOS. Don’t ask me why, but 
sometimes a netbook BIOS setting gets changed, and the change dis-
ables the camera. Read Chapter 21 for instructions on how to get to the 
BIOS settings and enable the cam.
 
✓ Install the latest driver. Check the manufacturer’s support Web site and 
see whether a new driver is available for the webcam. (I give you the full 
scoop on drivers in Chapter 20.) Even if you’re running the most current 
version, sometimes a file can get corrupted, so it’s worth it trying to 
reinstall the driver.

253
 Chapter 16: Troubleshooting Your Netbook
 
Most netbooks feature a LED light next to the camera lens — when the light is 
on, so is the camera. If the light is on but the camera’s not, you might have a 
hardware problem with the camera. However, my first guess would be that the 
camera hasn’t been configured properly in the program. Check various pro-
gram options and settings to make sure.
Dealing with Batteries
If you’re not getting the amount of runtime out of your battery that you used 
to, there’s a very good chance it reached its prime and is now on the downhill 
slide. A netbook (or any laptop) battery has a limited lifespan: After a certain 
point, it begins to hold less and less of a charge, which means you get fewer 
and fewer minutes of running time when the device isn’t plugged in. If you use 
your netbook a lot, figure a year or two before it’s time for a new battery.
 
If you have a couple of batteries and frequently swap them, visually check that 
the connection points are clean — grime and grunge on the connectors that 
may cause problems is clearly apparent. Dirty connectors may prevent a bat-
tery from delivering a full charge.
There’s more on batteries in Chapter 13.
Repairing Wireless Connections
Unfortunately, wireless problems can be both tricky and mysterious to 
resolve. Often the culprit is a setting that was inadvertently changed or a 
temporary glitch in the wireless card, router, or either’s interface software. 
You can try a variety of things in case you run into the following wireless 
difficulties:
 
✓ Is the wireless card enabled on your netbook? Is the LED status light 
on, or does the wireless icon in the Windows taskbar indicate wireless is 
enabled? If it isn’t, wireless is disabled. Press the appropriate function key 
(or click the taskbar icon) to enable wireless and then wait for a connection.
 
✓ Do you lose your wireless connection when the microwave oven is 
on? Or do you perhaps have a baby monitor, cordless phone, garage 
door opener, or fluorescent light fixture? You’re not hallucinating. 
These devices all run in the 2.4GHz radio frequency range and can inter-
fere with Wi-Fi connections. Try moving your netbook away from the 
offending devices (or your wireless router) if possible to eliminate the 
problem.

254
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
✓ Is your home or office wireless router/access point to blame? If you 
have another laptop, can you successfully get a Net connection? If not, 
reboot or turn the router off and on again. Wait about a minute until the 
router reconnects to the Internet and then try connecting again with 
your netbook. (Turn off your netbook and then restart it after the wire-
less router’s status lights indicate there’s an Internet connection.)
 
 Check which version of firmware the wireless router is running. If it isn’t 
current, upgrade to the latest. Consult your router user manual or the 
manufacturer Web site for details.
 
✓ Does the router have any security settings (such as MAC address fil-
tering, WEP, or WPA) turned on that may be preventing the netbook 
from connecting? If it does, make sure you’re using the right settings on 
your netbook to connect to the router.
 
✓ Are you having troubles connecting to just one access point? Try con-
necting to a free public Wi-Fi network (at a library, coffee shop, or college). 
If you’re successful, you rule out the possibility that your wireless card is 
broken. The problem may be with a single connection — usually a security 
setting or perhaps incompatibility with an older router/access point.
 
Try right-clicking the wireless icon in the Windows taskbar and selecting 
Repair. With this command, Windows disconnects from the wireless router, 
clears cached network settings, and then attempts to reconnect.
If all else fails, check out this detailed wireless troubleshooting guide from 
Microsoft: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/870702.
Running Slow
If your netbook is running slow, there might not be anything wrong with it. Don’t 
expect as snappy of performance compared with a traditional laptop or desktop 
PC — a netbook is lacking in both the memory and the processor departments.
I’ve found common culprits for poor, pokey performance include
 
✓ Running a processor-intensive program (such as a video player, a game 
with lots of 3-D animation, or a complex spreadsheet)
 
✓ Running multiple programs at once
 
✓ Opening a large number of files or windows
 
✓ Opening too many Web browser tabs
 
✓ Having lots of programs running in the background
The solution is to recognize your netbook’s limitations and spend more time 
single-tasking than multitasking. Trust me, it’s possible.

255
 Chapter 16: Troubleshooting Your Netbook
Dead as a Proverbial Doornail
I saved the absolute worst case scenario for last. You try to turn on the net-
book and nothing happens. Or maybe some LED status lights come on, but 
the screen is black. Your netbook seems to be a goner.
First, try pressing a key, wiggling your finger on the touchpad, or pressing 
the power button. Your netbook may just be in standby or hibernation mode 
(with a blank screen), and you just need to wake it up.
If that doesn’t work, there’s a chance the netbook’s display is set only to 
appear on an external monitor or projector and not on the netbook’s screen. 
Check your user manual for the appropriate function key to press to toggle 
screen modes.
Still no luck? Try plugging the netbook into an electrical outlet. It’s possible 
the battery has completely discharged, and there’s no power left. By the way, 
make sure it’s a known working electrical outlet — plug a lamp or appliance 
in if you have any doubts. And make sure all the connections are tight.
Uh-oh, I’m running out of the obvious cures. Next on my list is to read 
Chapter 17 for instructions on restoring your system — either from a DVD or 
the recovery hard drive partition.
No luck with that? Not good. I’d be suspicious that it’s probably a hardware 
or BIOS problem. If it’s a failed motherboard or power supply, there’s not 
much you can do.
Reset
If your netbook stops working (hangs) while a 
program is running, press Ctrl+Alt+Del to run 
the Windows Task Manager. You can then shut 
down the netbook with Task Manager or try 
closing the offending program — select the 
program in the Applications tab and click End 
Task. If you haven’t saved what you’ve been 
working on in the program, any changes you 
made are lost.
If it’s a serious system crash where Ctrl+Alt+Del 
doesn’t even work (such as an infamous Blue 
Screen of Death crash), press and hold the 
power button for 5 to 10 seconds. This forces 
the netbook to shut down. It’s a last-resort 
option because Windows doesn’t do a clean 
exit. You will definitely lose everything you’ve 
been working on, and there’s a good chance the 
netbook will boot up slower when you power it 
on again as Windows picks itself up, shakes the 
dust off, and tries to figure out what happened.

256
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
If the BIOS has somehow become corrupted (say you tried to upgrade it, 
but something happened), you have one last-resort option. Read Chapter 21 
where I discuss installing a new copy of the BIOS.
Failing that, here’s hoping your netbook is still under warranty. If so, contact 
the manufacturer, who will likely replace your netbook with a new one rather 
than repair it.
If your netbook is out of warranty, look on the bright side: All of your data 
is backed up just as I describe in Chapter 17 (right?), and you were looking 
for an excuse to get a new model with the latest features. The glass is always 
either half empty or half full.

Chapter 17
Backing Up and Restoring 
Your Netbook
In This Chapter

▶ Using Windows backup utilities
▶ Getting comfortable with commercial backup software
▶ Reinstalling Windows
T
ime is precious. If something happens to your netbook (it breaks, is lost, 
or is stolen), a whole lot of your precious time and effort just disappeared. 
Think about the amount of time that went into those PowerPoint presentations 
for your job, or that screenplay you’ve been writing on the side that you know 
will be a smash hit, or maybe all of those songs in your music collection you’ve 
painstakingly acquired over the years — legally, of course. It may take days, 
weeks, or months to reconstruct everything — that is, if you’re lucky. And that 
doesn’t include the cash you’re out from buying all that music again.
Of course that sad scene doesn’t need to happen. Backing up your netbook 
is simple and cheap insurance. If something goes wrong, you won’t be crying 
the blues because a copy of the fruits of your labor exists somewhere else.
In this chapter, I discuss backing up and restoring your netbook (there are 
several different approaches) and fill you in on the programs that make it 
easy. I also talk about reinstalling Windows on your netbook — and tell you 
when you should do it.
I don’t want to waste your time, so feel free to get started.
Understanding Simple File Copying
The simplest way to back up your netbook is to copy individual files and 
directories to another storage medium — USB flash drive, SD memory card, 
DVD or CD-ROM, an external hard drive, or another networked computer.

258
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
Making a duplicate copy of a file or folder and keeping it where the original is 
stored isn’t a smart backup policy. If you make a copy of a folder and keep it 
on the same hard drive as the original folder, you’re probably going to be out 
of luck if the drive fails.
Some netbooks come with free online storage services that you can use for 
backing up files. I talk more about some online storage solutions coming up.
In Windows Explorer, select the files and folders you want to back up and 
drag them to the other storage device. It’s as simple as that.
This simple backup strategy works great if you don’t have many files (it can 
take a lot of time copying gigabytes of data) or if you’re only interested in 
archiving documents and other files — simple file copying can’t back up the 
entire Windows operating system or any installed programs.
 
From an organizational standpoint, it makes sense to keep all your files in the 
My Documents folder instead of scattered all over your drive. That way you 
just copy the My Documents folder to back up your files.
Manually copying and dragging files and folders can get a bit tedious — 
especially when Windows is always asking whether you want to replace a 
same-named file. If you have a number of files you want to back up to read/
write media (such as a USB flash drive or external hard drive), I suggest pick-
ing up a copy of SyncToy, shown in Figure 17-1.
This is a free utility from Microsoft that makes backing up and synchroniz-
ing files a breeze. If you don’t have very demanding backup needs, I highly 
recommend this program. To find out more and to download, visit www.
microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c26efa36-98e0-
 4ee9-a7c5-98d0592d8c52&displaylang=en.

the appropriate Microsoft Web page.
Backing Up and Restoring Your Drive
Drag-and-drop copying works great if you’re backing up only a few files every 
now and then. But if you have lots of files to archive, want to back up your 
entire hard drive, and plan to be religious about backup frequency, you need 
a specialized program. These backup programs (depending on the software) 
allow you to
 
✓ Specify which files and folders to back up. Backup parameters are 
saved so you don’t have to enter them each time. You can back up to dif-
ferent storage media such as DVDs or external hard drives.
 
✓ Back up the entire drive. Including hidden system files.
 
✓ Restore files (or the drive) from a backup copy. You can restore the 
backed-up data to your netbook or another computer with a couple of 
clicks.
 
✓ Compress backup files. To save space, archived files are compressed. If 
you need to restore files, they’re decompressed.
 
✓ Encrypt backup files. Backup files are scrambled and password- pro-
tected to prevent unauthorized access.
 
✓ Schedule backups. Automatically run the backup program in the back-
ground at scheduled intervals.
Offsite storage
Backing up important files on your netbook is 
smart. If you want to be really smart, keep a 
copy of your backup someplace else. This is 
a common practice with businesses that have 
disaster recovery plans. If an office burns down 
and the backups are kept in the same room as 
the servers, everyone gets burned.
For personal offsite storage, consider keeping 
a copy of your backup at a friend’s or family 
member’s house, in a safety deposit box, or with 
an online storage service you can access over 
the Internet. You don’t need to visit the offsite 
storage site every time you make a backup, 
just periodically. If something happens to your 
netbook and your house, apartment, or office, 
copies of important files will be safe and 
sound.
This suggestion may seem a little paranoid, but 
if you live in a natural-disaster–prone area (with 
floods, wildfires, earthquakes, or hurricanes), it 
makes sense to have a backup of your backup. 
Even if natural disasters are rare, it’s still not 
a bad idea to think about safeguarding very 
important files.

260
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
✓ Perform incremental backups. Automatically compare files being 
backed up with archived versions. If changes have been made to the 
original file, a new backup is made. If there haven’t been any changes, no 
backup is made. This saves time.
 
✓ Clone a drive. Some programs support drive cloning; see the “Attack of 
the clones” sidebar.
In the following sections, I survey different backup programs you can use 
with your Windows netbook.
Windows backup utilities
I start my discussion of backup programs with Microsoft. Over the years, the 
company has included different backup utilities with its operating systems. 
Here’s the lowdown on Microsoft backup solutions, depending on which ver-
sion of Windows you’re using with your netbook.
Windows XP
Windows Backup (shown in Figure 17-2) is an easy-to-use backup program for 
computers running Windows XP. It has basic features and allows you to spec-
ify what files and folders you’d like to archive. It can also back up common 
program and system settings.
For some reason, Microsoft decided to preinstall Windows Backup only 
on copies of Windows XP Professional — most netbooks run Windows 
XP Home. If your netbook comes with a CD-ROM that has a “real” copy of 
Windows XP Home and not just a recovery image, the program is located in 
the VALUEADD\MSFT\NTBACKUP directory. Double-click Ntbackup.msi to 
install the program. If you don’t have a CD-ROM, try searching for ntbackup.
msi in Google to find and download the file — it’s available on a number of 
unofficial Windows XP support sites.
After you install the program, to run it, choose Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪System Tools➪Backup.
 
For more on using Windows Backup with a Windows XP netbook, check out 
this article: www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/learnmore/
bott_03july14.mspx.
Vista
With Vista, Microsoft redesigned, simplified, and renamed the Windows 
Backup program calling it the Backup Status and Configuration tool. 
Personally, I feel the program was dumbed down a little too much because 
it prevents you from performing some basic and advanced backup functions 
that were available in Windows Backup.

261
 Chapter 17: Backing Up and Restoring Your Netbook
 
It’s possible to use Windows Backup with Vista if you copy the Ntbackup.
exe, Ntmsapi.dll, and Vssapi.dll files from a computer running XP to the 
Vista Program Files folder. To run Windows Backup (Ntbackup.exe), you 
first need to turn on Removable Storage Management — choose Start➪Control 
Panel➪Programs➪Turn Windows Features On or Off.
If you’re running Vista on your netbook, check the online Help for more infor-
mation on the Backup Status and Configuration tool.
Windows 7
As I write this, the final version of Windows 7 hasn’t hit the streets yet, but if the 
backup program included in final release candidates is included, netbook users 
running the new Microsoft operating system should have a smile on their faces.
Vista’s Backup Status and Configuration tool is no more and has been 
replaced by a tool called Backup and Restore — which is much more configu-
rable but still easy to use.
To find out more about the program, use the online Help (which is acces-
sible from the Start menu) to search for backup. You can run the program by 
typing backup in the Start menu search box and selecting one of the results.
Attack of the clones
I briefly want to tell you about cloning hard 
drives — also known as disk imaging. 
This doesn’t require a laboratory or even a 
working knowledge of DNA. Cloning a drive 
means to make an exact, byte-by-byte duplicate 
of the drive. Instead of individual files being 
copied, entire hard drive sectors are faithfully 
reproduced.
Drive cloning is smart if you’re upgrading to a 
bigger hard drive. You clone the old drive to the 
new drive, and when you install the new drive, 
everything is there just like before. No need for 
reinstalling Windows or other programs.
You can directly clone from one drive to another 
(you’ll need a special adapter and a cable) or 
save a compressed image of the drive to a DVD 
or other storage media. You can uncompress 
the image later and use to restore the contents 
of a drive; just remember the storage media 
needs to be large enough to accommodate all 
the files on the original drive you’re cloning.
Note: If Windows seems to slow down after 
a couple of years, it’s not your imagination. 
Unused programs, drivers, and registry entries 
can impact a computer’s performance. Keep 
this in mind when you’re thinking about cloning. 
It may be smarter to perform a fresh operating 
system install on a new drive than to reinstall 
programs and copy over backed-up data files.
You can find a number of commercial drive 
cloning programs on the market, including 
Norton Ghost and Acronis True Image. Do a 
Web search for disk cloning software to find 
out more about other programs. 

262

Commercial backup programs
Although the programs that come with Windows work great for backups, you 
can also find a number of other freeware and commercial backup programs that 
have better and more advanced features. Think of it like this: For some people, 
the basic Windows Paint program meets their needs; for others, it’s worthwhile 
to shell out the extra bucks to get the enhanced features of Photoshop.
Here’s a collection of popular, non-Microsoft backup programs for Windows 
netbooks — or any computer that uses Windows XP (or later). All of these 
programs are reasonably priced and some have free, limited-feature, or trial 
versions available. A few even allow you to back up data online, so you don’t 
need to worry about external storage media such as DVDs or spare hard 
drives. Check out the respective Web sites for more information:
 
✓ Acronis True Image: (www.acronis.com) The Home version of Acronis 
True Image is a traditional backup and disk-cloning program that saves 
data to CD-ROMs, DVDs, flash memory, and hard drives. It costs $49.99. 
Acronis also provides a free trial version.
 
✓ Carbonite: (http://carbonite.com) This is a popular online backup 
service. You install a program on your netbook that manages backups 
over the Internet to a secure server. For $54.95 a year, you can back up 
as much data as you want. A 15-day free trial is available.
 
 When it comes to online backup services, your biggest limitation is going 
to be bandwidth. It’s not realistic to think you’ll be able to back up a full 
250GB hard drive online — it would take a very long time. In addition, if 
your Internet service provider has a metered bandwidth plan, you can use 
up your allocation pretty quickly if you’re performing frequent backups.

263
 Chapter 17: Backing Up and Restoring Your Netbook
 
✓ Cobian Backup: (www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/cobianbackup.htm) 
You’ve got to love developers who release good programs for free. That’s 
what Luis Cobian did with this powerful piece of backup software. If you 
use it, be sure to send him a donation.
 
✓ Jungle Disk: (www.jungledisk.com) Jungle Disk is a pay-as-you-go online 
backup service that uses Amazon’s S3 storage service. Rates are currently 
$2 a month plus 15 cents each month for every gigabyte of storage space, 
10 cents per gigabyte uploaded, and 17 cents per gigabyte downloaded.
 
✓ Macrium Reflect: (www.macrium.com) Reflect is an easy-to-use backup 
and disk-imaging program that comes with a number of advanced fea-
tures. It’s priced at $39.95 with a free, 30-day trial version available. 
 
✓ Mozy: (http://mozy.com) This online storage service charges $4.95 a 
month for unlimited backup with its MozyHome product — there’s also 
a professional version with encryption and other features with a higher 
subscription fee. If you don’t have a lot to back up, sign up for a free 
account and get a complimentary 2GB of storage.
 
✓ SyncBack: (www.2brightsparks.com/syncback)A feature-rich 
backup program with easy and power-user modes. Three versions with 
different features are available, priced at $49.95, $30, and free — you 
can’t beat the price of that last one.
 
If you’re using an online storage service to back up sensitive files, no matter 
how secure the service advertises itself, I highly recommend encrypting your 
data. I discuss encryption in Chapter 9.
Reinstalling Windows
Reinstalling Windows means erasing your netbook’s hard drive and restor-
ing it to just like it came out of the box. (I’m talking about just the operating 
system and installed programs — you’re on your own for fixing any dings or 
scratches on the case.)
Reinstalling Windows is a rather extreme measure, and there are four situa-
tions that call for it:
 
✓ Corrupted system files make Windows unstable.
 
✓ Viruses or other malware make your netbook unusable.
 
 On many occasions, it’s faster and easier to reinstall Windows than try 
to repair a netbook that’s been infected by a difficult and stubborn-to-
remove virus.

264
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
✓ Your netbook doesn’t work right and you’ve tried everything else.
 
✓ The government (or space aliens) have bugged your netbook to dis-
cover Aunt Sally’s secret oatmeal cookie recipe. 
If you decide you need to reinstall Windows, first back up any files you want 
to save. (You should have a pretty good idea of how to do this from earlier 
sections in this chapter.)
Netbook manufacturers provide two different ways to reinstall the operating 
system. Some manufacturers provide one or the other; some provide both:
 
✓ Drive partition: An image of the operating system is stored on a drive 
partition.
 
✓ Recovery discs: CD-ROM(s) or a DVD is included that contains a recov-
ery image or a copy of Windows. Some manufacturers don’t provide a 
disc but include a utility program for creating a recovery disc — you 
supply the CD-ROM or DVD and the drive.
 
Most manufacturers use recovery images these days in an effort to stem soft-
ware piracy. Unlike a copy of Windows that can be installed on any computer, a 
recovery image can be installed only on the computer it came with — also, you 
can’t access any of the individual operating system files on the recovery image.
 
Any programs you installed or any system updates you applied between the 
time you got your netbook and when you performed the system reinstall are 
no longer present. You need to download and install them again.
Using a recovery disc
If a recovery disc (CD-ROM or DVD) came with your netbook, you can use it 
to restore Windows and other programs. (Obviously you’ll need an external 
drive to access the disc.)
Here are the general steps for reinstalling Windows from a recovery disc 
(refer to your netbook user manual for specific instructions):
 
1. Connect your netbook to an external power source and turn it on.
 
 Consider having a fully charged battery, too, just in case the power goes out.
 
2. Connect an external DVD drive to your netbook and insert the recovery 
disc.
 
 Some netbooks provide power to USB ports when plugged in to an exter-
nal power supply. That means if the drive is connected, you can insert 
and eject DVDs without the netbook being turned on.

 Chapter 17: Backing Up and Restoring Your Netbook
Windows System Restore
One of the niftier features that Microsoft 
included in Windows is something called 
System Restore. This is a time-machine–like 
feature that allows you to roll back system files, 
registry keys, and installed programs to a previ-
ous state.
Say you installed some program and suddenly 
your netbook starts acting strange. Uninstalling 
the program doesn’t help, and you think you may 
need to reinstall Windows. Before you do, try 
System Restore. The program will restore your 
system exactly how it was before you installed 
the suspect program.
System Restore automatically takes snapshots 
of the system state . . .
 ✓ Every 24 hours of computer use.
 ✓ When software is installed with programs 
that are designed to work with System 
Restore.
 ✓ When Windows Update installs new 
updates.
 ✓ Whenever you request it.
These snapshots are called restore points. 
You can display a calendar with various saved 
restore points and tell Windows to go back 
in time to a restore point, as shown in the 
figure. System settings and state are then 
reverted back to reflect that prior point in time. 
(System Restore only impacts system files and 
programs — you won’t lose data files such as 
word processing documents when you go back 
to an older restore point.)
Windows allocates a certain amount of disk 
space for storing restore point data. Older 
restore points are constantly being deleted as 
newer points are created.
In my book, this is an indispensable tool every 
netbook owner should know about. There 
are differences between Windows XP, Vista, 
and Windows 7 versions of System Restore. 
For detailed information, your best bet is to 
consult Windows online Help or visit www.
microsoft.com and search for System 
Restore.

3. Restart your netbook and press the key sequence to boot from the 
DVD drive.
 
 Your user manual has information on which key(s) to press. If holding 
down the key doesn’t allow you to select which device to boot from, try 
restarting the netbook and quickly and repeatedly pressing the key(s).
 
 Some netbooks have a BIOS setting that speeds up the boot process — 
for example, in ASUS netbooks, it’s called Boot Booster. If this setting is 
enabled, you won’t be able to select a boot device with the function key at 
startup. See Chapter 21 for information on how to change BIOS settings. 
 
4. Follow the directions that appear on the screen.
 
 You’ll be prompted if you want to restore the Windows image. If you 
haven’t backed up any important files, now would be a good time to 
cancel the reinstallation and do a backup.
The process is fully automated and takes between 15 to 20 minutes — your 
mileage may vary depending on the netbook. You’ll see status messages as 
the system is restored, and you may be prompted to restart your netbook. 
When the reinstallation is complete, Windows starts. You’ll need to go 
through the same steps as you did when you first got your netbook, including 
setting the time zone, agreeing to the licensing terms, specifying computer 
name and username, and entering other settings.
That’s it. When your netbook starts up next, it will be just like it came from 
the factory. Copy any files you backed up onto the drive, install any programs 
or updates, and you’re back in business.
 
In addition to the Windows recovery disc, some manufacturers include discs 
that have other programs that came preinstalled on your netbook. You may 
need to run the installation programs on these discs to restore other pro-
grams that weren’t included during the system reinstallation.
Using a drive partition recovery image
If your netbook didn’t come with a recovery disc and you need to reinstall 
Windows, you need to use a recovery image that’s installed on a partition of 
your hard drive or solid state drive. The recovery image includes Windows 
and all the netbook drivers and utility programs.
Here are the general steps to use a drive partition recovery image (check 
your user manual for specific instructions that apply to your netbook model):
 
1. Connect your netbook to an external power source.
 
 You don’t want to have your battery die in the middle of a system 
restore; it’s bad luck — especially for your drive as it could get cor-
rupted or possibly damaged.

267
 Chapter 17: Backing Up and Restoring Your Netbook
 
2. Turn on your netbook and press the key sequence to begin system 
reinstallation.
 
 This is typically a function key. Check your user manual for the cor-
rect one to use. Some netbooks require you to enable a recovery mode 
BIOS setting before you can reinstall the system. Again, refer to the user 
manual for details.
 
3. Follow the onscreen directions.
 
 Your netbook runs a program that erases the main drive partition and 
copies the image from the recovery partition. You should be able to see 
this partition with Windows Explorer — for example, there may be a D: 
drive named Restore with several gigabytes for data. Using a recovery 
partition should be somewhat faster than using a recovery disc. After 
the image is copied, Windows starts up and the system is in an identical 
state to when you first got your netbook. 
 
If you completely reformat your hard drive, you will delete the recovery parti-
tion and won’t be able to restore Windows — unless you have a recovery disc. 
I’ve seen this happen with netbook users who want to try out Linux, format 
their drives, and end up not being able to restore Windows. If you want to play 
with Linux, use a live version (that is, a customized version) that you can boot 
from on a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or SD card without permanently installing 
on the hard drive. If you format your drive or somehow the recovery partition 
is damaged, contact the manufacturer and see whether you can get a recovery 
disc. When you get the disc, if you don’t already have a USB DVD drive, you’ll 
need to purchase one.

Upgrading Storage and Memory
In This Chapter
▶ Muddling through memory
▶ Upgrading RAM
▶ Understanding internal drives
▶ Swapping drives
O
ur society is accustomed to a “more is better” outlook on life. I don’t 
mean to get up on a soapbox, but the computer industry is especially 
guilty of promoting excess when it comes to processor speed, drive space, 
and system memory. (In all fairness to the hardware manufacturers, much 
of this is driven by software companies that continue to produce bigger and 
more bloated products. Of course, memory, storage, and processing power 
have all gotten cheaper, so why not take advantage of it? It’s a vicious cycle.)
The popularity of the netbook has been a refreshing reversal to the “bigger 
is better” philosophy. It’s amazing how functional a well-designed computer 
can be when it’s based on memory, available storage space, and processing 
power that was top of the line five or more years back.
Don’t worry; this isn’t an op-ed piece, and I’m actually going somewhere with 
all this. Even though a minimalist netbook does a good job of meeting your 
computing needs, you still may want to amp up the memory or storage in your 
little laptop. That’s what this chapter is about. If you’ve never upgraded a com-
puter’s memory or hard drive before, I tell you everything you need to know — 
and if you have, I cover a variety of netbook specifics you should know.
Adding More Memory
The first generation of netbooks had a paltry 512K of system memory — 
system memory is also known as RAM, or random access memory. The 

270
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
majority of netbooks on the market have now mostly standardized on a 
quite usable 1GB of memory. However, if you’re not happy with the amount 
of memory that came from the factory, many netbook models allow you to 
upgrade system memory. In this section, I give you advice on whether to 
upgrade RAM and how to select the right type of memory, and I conclude 
with a general tutorial on adding more memory to your netbook.
Do you need to upgrade memory?
The first question you should ask yourself is whether more memory will 
make you a happier and more productive netbook owner.
I believe for most users (with the current netbooks on the market), 1GB of 
RAM is perfectly acceptable for basic netbook computing needs. You will 
see only a small performance gain when you upgrade — but it’s not like your 
little laptop will suddenly become twice as fast.
 
Keep in mind that the reason that most netbooks come with a maximum of 
1GB of memory is due to Microsoft licensing requirements. For a netbook 
to qualify as a ULCPC (that’s Ultra Low Cost Personal Computer) under 
Microsoft’s Designed for Windows XP logo program, the manufacturer can’t 
ship a netbook with more than 1GB. However, this doesn’t prevent a manufac-
turer from building a netbook that can be user expandable with more memory.
Upgrading memory involves taking your netbook apart — and doing so 
involves varying degrees of complexity depending on the model, from simple 
to nearly requiring an engineering degree. I describe the process coming up, 
but if you’re not comfortable installing the memory yourself, that’s all right. 
Your netbook will be fine without more memory.
If you’re set on upgrading memory, I certainly won’t try to dissuade you. 
Memory is relatively cheap and depending on the netbook model, is pretty 
easy to install — even for a novice. So, if you want mo’ memory, read on.
Can you upgrade the memory?
If you decide you want (or need) more memory, the next question you must 
address is whether your netbook’s RAM can be upgraded. Turn to your user 
manual for the answer — or the manufacturer’s support Web site. If the user 
manual doesn’t say or is vague, head over to Google and search for the name 
of your netbook and memory upgrade. Other owners no doubt have had 

271
 Chapter 18: Upgrading Storage and Memory
the same question, and you’ll quickly find out whether you can add more 
memory to your netbook.
There are several clues that your memory may not be easily upgraded:
 
✓ The manufacturer explicitly says “no dice” on upgrades. (This will be 
listed in product specifications on the manufacturer Web site and/or in 
the user manual.)
 
✓ The memory is soldered in place as opposed to removable from a 
socket.
 
✓ There’s no door for accessing the memory module.
 
✓ Opening the case voids the manufacturer’s warranty. (If there are tamper-
proof, quality-assurance labels sealing the case, that’s a hint.)
These factors don’t absolutely mean you can’t upgrade the memory; they just 
make it more difficult and mean there are more potential consequences if you 
mess up. However, if you’re technically inclined, and if it’s possible (although 
perhaps a pain) to upgrade the memory, and if you don’t care about the war-
ranty, then press on.
 
If you’re stuck with a netbook that you can’t upgrade, I recommend making the 
best of it. Honestly, depending on your use, the netbook may be perfectly fine 
in the performance department. If it’s not, I suggest saving up for a new model 
that has more RAM or can be easily upgraded.
Memory bytes
When you read about or go shopping for 
memory, you’ll be barraged with a bunch of baf-
fling buzzwords and arcane acronyms. Here’s a 
handy guide to make sense of them:
 ✓ DDR2: Double data rate synchronous 
dynamic random access memory (SDRAM). 
The second generation, that’s what the 2 
stands for, of a memory technology.
 ✓ DIMM: Dual inline memory module. A card 
that contains multiple memory chips — used 
to update a computer’s system memory.
 ✓ MHz: Just like processors, memory comes in 
different speeds — measured in megahertz 
or MHz. Faster memory is better, but keep 
in mind that different netbooks support dif-
ferent maximum speeds. If you pay more 
money for faster memory, you might not get 
the full benefit of its zippiness — it’s like 
having a Ferrari that can go 140 MPH, but 
the speed limit is only 60 MPH, and there 
are police wherever you look.
 ✓ RAM: Random access memory or the main, 
system memory.
 ✓ SODIMM: Small outline dual inline memory 
module. A smaller version of DIMM typically 
used in laptops and netbooks. SODIMMs 
have different numbers of pins, so it’s 
important to get the right one that works 
with your netbook.

272
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
Selecting the right memory
After you’ve confirmed you can upgrade your netbook’s RAM, you need to 
select the right type because there are many types of computer memory on 
the market. There are two ways to determine which kind of memory is appro-
priate for your netbook:
 
✓ Read the user manual. Am I sounding like a broken record throughout 
this book yet?
 
✓ Check the Net. First, check the netbook manufacturer’s support Web 
site. You can also do a search for your netbook model and the word 
memory. You’ll get lots of retail sites offering their wares and telling you 
the type of memory you need. Additionally, you can check Web forums 
devoted to your netbook. There are always discussion threads devoted 
to memory upgrades.
For system memory, most netbooks use DDR2 SODIMM, shown in Figure 18-1. 
(Use the acronym guide in the “Memory bytes” sidebar to help figure out 
what all of those letters mean.)
 
Figure 18-1:
 DDR2 
SODIMM for 
a netbook.
 
For example, a manufacturer might suggest you upgrade with this:
2GB DDR2-667 SODIMM
That’s a 2GB memory module.
 
The number that comes after DDR2 is not the memory speed in MHz but the 
effective number of data transfers per second. Here’s how fast the different 
types of memory are: DDR2-400 — 100 MHz, DDR2-533 — 133 MHz, DDR2-667 — 
166 MHz, DDR2-800 — 200 MHz, and DDR2-1066 — 266 MHz.

273
 Chapter 18: Upgrading Storage and Memory
 
Don’t bother getting memory faster than 166 MHz. The additional cost doesn’t 
justify the benefit.
On most memory upgradeable netbooks, the memory module is installed in 
a socket. You pull the old memory out and snap a new module (with more 
memory) in.
Netbook memory is currently offered in nice round numbers, 1GB and 2GB 
modules. Depending on the brand, where you purchase it, and how much you 
buy (1 or 2GB) expect to pay between $20 and $50. (Like the stock market, 
memory prices seem to always be going up or down.)
 
Netbooks may be limited to a maximum amount of RAM by operating system 
or hardware constraints. For example, when the Eee PC first came out, Linux 
models could address only up to 1GB of memory. If you installed 2GB, the net-
book would still work but would use only 1GB of the memory. Currently, most 
netbook system chipsets don’t support more than 2GB of RAM — regardless 
of the operating system.
General guide to upgrading memory
Here I tell you the basic procedure for upgrading your netbook’s memory. 
Remember that each netbook is different, and the following figures and steps 
might not exactly match your model — but at the very least, they can give 
you an idea of what’s involved.
 
Before upgrading your netbook’s memory, I highly recommend you do some 
homework. Use Google to search for tutorials dedicated to your specific 
netbook — you can find many excellent guides with full-color photos and 
detailed instructions on various Web sites and forums. Also check YouTube, 
because the site hosts a number of video tutorials that are great for under-
standing all the steps.
The following steps outline the basic procedure for upgrading your netbook’s 
memory:
 
1. Turn off your netbook.
 
 Make sure the netbook is powered off and not in sleep mode. Disconnect 
the power supply from the laptop. It’s also a good idea to remove the 
battery. When the battery is removed, press the power button. This 
action grounds the system board.
 
2. Get to where the memory is.
 
 Turn the netbook over so the bottom is facing up. Your netbook will 
either have a removable panel for accessing the memory (shown in 

274
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
Figure 18-2; this makes it easy to upgrade memory), or you’ll need to 
take the case apart to get at the memory (which is more of a hassle). 
With either, you must remove some small screws (usually Phillips head), 
so have an appropriate size screwdriver handy.
 
Figure 18-2: 
Remove a 
netbook’s 
memory 
access 
panel.
 
 
 Put the screws in a small bowl or someplace you won’t lose them. It’s 
also a good idea not to work around open heater vents, carpet, or places 
where small screws accidentally knocked to the floor could disappear 
forever.
 
3. Locate the memory and remove it.
 
 With the panel removed or the case opened, find the memory — see 
Figure 18-3.
 
 Most netbooks use plastic or metal retaining clips to hold the memory in 
place (also shown in Figure 18-3). With your fingertips, carefully spread 
the retaining clips apart.
 
 The memory module will pop up at an angle. Lift the module up and out 
to remove it from the socket.
 
 Be careful when handling the memory module. You should hold it by the 
edges and not grasp the chips or pins.

275
 Chapter 18: Upgrading Storage and Memory
 
Figure 18-3: 
The memory 
compartment 
is open, 
showing the 
location of 
the memory 
module and 
retaining 
clips.
 
 
4. Place the new memory into the empty socket.
 
 This is mostly the same procedure as removing the memory module, but 
in reverse.
 
 Aligning the memory module pins with the socket, slide the module into 
the socket at about a 45-degree angle, as shown in Figure 18-4. Gently 
press the module down until it clicks into place and is secured by the 
retaining clips.
 
 If you don’t see and hear it click into place, remove the module and start 
over again. Something is out of alignment.
Don’t give me no static
Anytime you play surgeon and operate on a 
computer, you need to be careful of static dis-
charge. If you touch something or someone and 
get a shock from static electricity, it’s a harm-
less surprise. If you touch the wrong compo-
nent while you’re working on your netbook and 
give it a static shock, the electricity can pos-
sibly damage sensitive electronics.
Computer technicians often wear a grounding 
wrist strap to prevent static discharge. You can 
also occasionally touch an unpainted, metal 
surface (such as a connector on the back of 
your computer) to discharge static from your 
body.
Static electricity is more prevalent when the 
humidity is low. I also recommend not vigorously 
rubbing your feet on carpet prior to swapping 
out memory or a hard drive — ah, that brings 
back childhood memories.

276
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
Figure 18-4: 
Insert a new 
memory 
module into 
the socket.
 
 
5. Put the case back together.
 
 Reattach the panel (or reassemble the case) and put the screws back in. 
Reinsert the battery into the case.
 
6. Turn on your netbook.
 
 It’s time to check your work. If everything went well, your netbook 
should now report you have more memory. Some models display the 
amount of RAM at startup, or you can select My Computer on the 
Windows desktop and then right-click and choose Properties from the 
pop-up menu.
 
 If your netbook doesn’t boot, either the memory is defective or more 
than likely it isn’t seated properly in the socket. Go through the pre-
ceding steps again and verify that the memory module is in place. If it 
appears to be, try reinstalling the old memory and see whether the net-
book will boot. If it does, there’s a good chance the memory is defective, 
and you’ll need to return it.
Swapping Internal Drives
Depending on your netbook model, you may be able to swap its internal 
drive for a larger drive. In the following sections, I tell you all about swapping 
drives, including which types of storage drives are available, how to decide 

277
 Chapter 18: Upgrading Storage and Memory
whether you need a bigger drive, and the general steps involved in removing 
and installing a new drive.
 
As I mention earlier in the “Adding More Memory” section of this chapter, 
always check your user manual or the manufacturer’s support Web site for 
information on replacing hardware.
Types of netbook drives
Netbooks are sold with two types of drives, solid state drives (SSDs) or hard 
disk drives (HDDs). 
Solid state drives
Solid state drives (one is shown in Figure 18-5), often abbreviated SSD, use 
memory to store data and don’t have any moving mechanical parts — this 
makes them lighter and less prone to failure. They start up and power down 
very quickly, are quiet, and have fast read and write times. SSDs were popular 
in first generation netbooks and still are available in smaller models where 
maximum low weight and portability are desirable features.
The downside to SSDs is they aren’t cheap — at least the high-capacity models. 
For example a 160GB SSD is currently priced around $900 — ouch, compare 
that with a hard disk drive the same size, which costs well under $200.

Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
Hard disk drives
Most computers use a hard disk drive (HDD) as their primary storage media. 
A hard drive stores digitally encoded data on the magnetic surfaces of rap-
idly rotating platters.
Traditional laptops use 2.5-inch drives, but in an effort to save space, net-
book manufacturers tend to use smaller, 1.8-inch drives — shown in Figure 
18-6. Currently, the largest capacity 1.8-inch drive offers 250GB of storage. 
However, most netbooks are sold with hard drives that range from 60 to 
160GB in size.
 
Figure 18-6: 
Inside a 
1.8-inch 
hard disk 
drive (HDD) 
typically 
found in a 
netbook.
 
Like any hard drive, the more storage available the higher the price tag. 
Relatively low-capacity 60GB drives cost around $75, whereas a 160GB drive 
is priced around $175.
 
Depending on the netbook, it’s usually possible to exchange a hard disk drive 
for an SSD or an SSD for a hard drive. The critical issue is the connector on 
the motherboard. For example, if the netbook uses a SATA (Serial Advanced 
Technology Attachment) connector and comes with a SATA hard drive, you 
should be able to swap the hard drive for an SSD. (See the nearby sidebar, 
“Drive lingo,” for more about SATA.) Things get more complicated when the 
motherboard connector doesn’t match the connector of the drive you want to 
install. In such cases, adapters may be available. Just remember there’s not a 
lot of space inside a netbook, so the adapter needs to fit.

279
 Chapter 18: Upgrading Storage and Memory
Do you need a bigger drive?
If you have a netbook with a relatively shrimpy sized drive, should you swap 
it out for a bigger drive? It depends.
First, can your netbook drive be upgraded? Some manufacturers make it easy 
to swap out a drive, whereas others make it considerably difficult, and sev-
eral won’t honor the warranty if you open up the case.
Second, is your current drive full or close to full? If it is, are you using the net-
book as it was designed — as a portable, travel companion, not as a desktop 
or full-size laptop replacement (with a big drive cluttered with tons of files 
and programs)?
Honestly, for the average netbook user, I say don’t worry about replacing 
your drive. It likely has enough capacity to serve your basic computing 
needs. (If it doesn’t, and you’re technically inclined, then go for the swap.)
The only netbook owners I would recommend upgrading are those stuck with 
very small SSDs. Although it’s possible to run Linux and Windows on 4 and 
8GB netbooks, it doesn’t leave you much breathing room for even a minimal 
collection of programs and files.
Companies such as RunCore (www.runcore.com) and others are starting to 
offer reasonably priced, upgrade SSDs. For example, RunCore has 16, 32, 64, 
and 128GB SSDs that are priced between $69 and $389.
 
Be smart about upgrading an SSD, because at the present you might be able 
to buy a brand new netbook with lots of enhanced features for the price of a 
higher-capacity SSD.
 
If you’re considering replacing your SSD, always check the advertised read/
write speeds and read reviews. Memory speeds vary, and there are noticeably 
slower SSDs on the market — the higher the speed, the better.
General guide to replacing a drive
Next, I step you through replacing a netbook’s drive. Each netbook is dif-
ferent, so treat the following instructions and figures as a general guide. 
Although the details may not match your netbook exactly, you’ll have a 
better sense of everything that’s involved in a drive swap.

280
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
Use Google to search for tutorials on upgrading your netbook’s drive — there 
are many excellent guides with full-color photos and detailed instructions on 
various Web sites and forums. Also check YouTube for video tutorials.
Here’s how to replace a netbook’s drive:
 
1. Back up the old drive.
 
 Unless you want to start completely from scratch, I suggest you first 
back up the drive you’re going to replace. At a minimum, this means 
copying files you’ll want stored on the new drive — use a USB flash drive 
or external drive. A more advanced technique is to clone the drive. I dis-
cuss backup strategies, including cloning, in Chapter 17.
 
2. Turn off your netbook.
 
 Make sure the netbook is powered off. Disconnect the power supply and 
remove the battery. After you’ve done that, press the power button to 
ground the system board.
Drive lingo
When you start looking at storage drives, you 
need to work through some of the jargon. Here’s 
a short glossary to help you out:
 ✓ PATA: Parallel Advanced Technology 
Attachment. An older interface standard for 
connecting storage devices (hard drives) to 
computer motherboards. Many netbooks 
come with PATA because it is power effi-
cient — however SATA is now more com-
monly used on desktop and full-size laptop 
computers. 
 ✓ RPM: Revolutions per minute. This is the 
rate a hard drive’s platter spins. The higher 
the number, the faster data on the disk is 
read. For example a 7,200 RPM is faster 
(and more expensive) than a 4,200 RPM 
drive.
 ✓ SATA: Serial Advanced Technology 
Attachment. A storage interface for con-
necting drives to computer motherboards. 
Has more features and is more compatible 
with future storage devices than PATA.
 ✓ ZIF: Zero Insertion Force. A socket-based 
connector standard. If your netbook uses a 
ZIF interface to connect its internal drive, a 
replacement drive needs to be ZIF compat-
ible or you’ll need an adapter.
Unless you’re a techie, don’t be concerned with 
remembering all of this. If you’re shopping for a 
replacement drive, simply look for a drive that’s 
advertised as compatible with your netbook 
make and model.

281
 Chapter 18: Upgrading Storage and Memory
 
3. Get to where the hard drive is located.
 
 Turn the netbook over so the bottom is facing up. Your netbook has a 
removable panel for accessing the hard drive (shown in Figure 18-7) — 
some models use the same access panel for memory and drives; others 
have separate panels. If there’s no access panel, you’ll need to take the case 
apart to get to the drive. Remove the screws and try not to lose them.
 
4. Remove the drive retaining screws.
 
 Whether the drive is an SSD or hard disk, it will be held in place with 
some type of retaining screws. Depending on the netbook model, the 
drive may have a bracket that secures it in place (shown in Figure 18-7), 
or the drive may be screwed directly to the circuit board (shown with 
a caseless SSD in Figure 18-8). Remove the screws and put them some-
place memorable.

 With the retaining screws removed, now pull the drive away from the 
connector and lift it out of the case. Many hard drives have a pull tab 
attached for easier removal as shown in Figure 18-9. For SSDs, handle the 
drive by the edges.

 Pretty much the reverse procedure of removing the drive — just slide 
the drive into the connector and then screw it into place. Some hard 
drives may be enclosed with a bracket; if so, you need to unscrew the 
bracket and install it on the new drive.

8. Turn on your netbook.
 
 Your little laptop should boot up, and the operating system will start 
to load. If it doesn’t, either the new drive is defective or hasn’t been 
installed correctly — the latter being more likely of the two. Go through 
the steps again and make sure the drive is in place. If you’re replacing a 
drive that works, try reinstalling it and see whether the netbook starts 
up. If it does, there’s a problem with the new drive, and you need to 
replace it.

ecause of increased gas prices, a new sport called hypermiling is 
becoming popular. You mostly play against yourself with the goal of get-
ting the most possible miles per gallon whenever you drive — you do this by 
modifying your car and your driving habits. One of the first things hypermilers 
do is ensure their car is tuned up for optimal performance. You should do the 
same with your netbook.
The simple truth is that a netbook is not a powerful, speed demon of a com-
puter. Its processor, memory, and graphics chipset all limit its performance 
compared with traditional laptops and PCs. And quite honestly, the way 
Windows comes configured out-of-the-box can hinder your little laptop’s per-
formance even more.
The good news is you can perform a series of Windows tune-up tricks 
to speed up your netbook, get it running more efficiently, and save drive 
space. In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on optimizing Windows XP for 
your netbook — if you’re running Windows 7, be sure to read the sidebar 
“Optimizing Windows 7.”
I don’t guarantee these tips and tricks will give your netbook the same perfor-
mance as a traditional PC with a dual core processor and loads of RAM, but 
hey, every little bit helps, and if you do enough optimization tricks, you can 
get some noticeable improvements. So pick up that 9/16-inch crescent wrench 
over there and get started.

Reduce, Simplify
One of my favorite Bruce Lee quotes is “Take what is useful and discard the 
rest.” He was talking about martial arts training and techniques, but his com-
ment is appropriate for lots of other things, too, including netbooks.
Just like any other PC these days, your netbook is going to come with lots of 
programs installed — many that you’ll likely never use. These programs are a 
drain on your netbook for a couple of reasons:
 
✓ Unused programs take up drive space, which is especially critical on net-
books that have small drives without a lot of storage.
 
✓ There may be programs you don’t even know about that are running 
in the background, taking up precious system memory and processor 
cycles.
In addition to these programs, your netbook can quickly acquire all sorts of 
temporary files that rob free disk space.
Your one-stop shop for keeping what’s useful and discarding the rest is a 
Windows program called Disk Cleanup. To run the program, choose Start➪
Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk Cleanup.
Optimizing Windows 7
As I write this, user tests of beta versions of 
Windows 7 on various netbooks show the 
operating system performs just as well if not 
somewhat faster than Windows XP. That’s 
good news, because by the time you read this, 
Microsoft’s newest operating system will come 
preinstalled on various netbook models — in a 
version designed for low-horsepower comput-
ers like netbooks.
Of course, that’s not to say Windows 7 comes 
perfectly configured for your netbook. As with 
XP, you should optionally be able to tune up the 
operating system to enhance your netbook’s 
performance. (Remember: You won’t be able 
to upgrade XP to Windows 7 — you need to 
perform a fresh install of the new operating 
system.)
If your netbook is running Windows 7, start 
by uninstalling any programs you don’t need, 
then move on to turning off unused services 
as I describe in this chapter. In theory, some 
of the other tuning tips I offer for Windows XP 
should also apply — however, how you make 
the changes will probably be a little different.
Because the final version of Windows 7 hasn’t 
hit the streets yet, there’s not as much tune-up 
information available as there is for prior ver-
sions of Windows. However, I expect that to 
change rapidly. The publishers of one of my 
favorite sites for tweaking Windows XP (www.
tweakxp.com) already have a site devoted 
to optimizing Windows 7, and it’s aptly named 
www.tweakwin7.com. Check it out for spe-
cific performance hints.

Disk Cleanup displays a list of different types of temporary files and how 
much space they currently are taking up, as shown in Figure 19-1. Select a 
check box to indicate the files you want to delete and click OK. The program 
ferrets out the files and removes them for you.
 
Figure 19-1:

space.
 
In addition to getting rid of unwanted temporary files, Disk Cleanup is a con-
venient jump-off point to three other space-saving programs. When you click 
the More Options tab, you can
 
✓ Remove Windows components. Windows comes with a number of com-
ponents you may not ever use, such as fax services, MSN, and various 
system accessories. With this tool, you can add and remove Windows 
components. 
 
✓ Uninstall programs. This option runs the Add or Remove Programs util-
ity, which you can also run from the Windows Control Panel. A list of 
installed programs is displayed. Select a program and click the Remove 
button to uninstall it.
 
 If you don’t know what a program is, do a little bit of research (with 
Google) before you uninstall it. It may be more important than you think.
 
✓ Delete old system restore points. System Restore is a Windows utility 
that allows you to roll back the system to a previous point in time. (See 
the “System Restore” section later in the chapter.) You can get rid of old 
restore point data to free up more drive space.
 
Check Windows online Help to find out more about any of these clean-up 
programs.

Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
Disable Services
Windows (or any operating system for that matter) is not one single, large 
program, but a collection of small programs, each of which is responsible for 
a specific task, such as printing, network communications, and so on. These 
small programs run in the background and are called services. Services con-
sume memory and processor cycles — see where I’m going with this?
Windows runs a number of different services. Some are critical to the operat-
ing system working correctly; others are completely optional and may never 
be of use to you. You should consider turning off the latter.
To find out which services your netbook is running, use MSConfig — the 
Windows System Configuration Utility. This program provides information 
about services and allows you to enable and disable them, and it displays 
other system information.
To run MSConfig in XP, here’s what you do:
 
1. Choose Start➪Run.
 
2. Type msconfig and click OK.
 
3. Click the Services tab.
A list of services is displayed, as shown in Figure 19-2. A check mark next to 
an item means that service is enabled and automatically runs when Windows 
starts up. If you deselect the item and click the Apply or OK button, the ser-
vice won’t start the next time Windows starts — saving you memory and 
processor cycles.
RAMeo, RAMeo
“Wherefore art thou RAMeo?” said Juliet to her 
netbook. Pardon the bad pun. I know this chap-
ter is about optimizing Windows to increase 
performance, but the single best thing you can 
possibly do to make your netbook go faster is to 
add more memory.
Sure Windows XP can run with 512MB of RAM 
(or even less), but the more memory the better. 
And if you perform the tweaks in this chapter 
and add more memory, your netbook will be 
even zoomier. Take this as a hint to read Chapter 
18, where I tell you everything you need to know 
about upgrading memory on your netbook.

I could fill this entire book with descriptions of all the Windows XP services. 
But because I don’t have the pages for that, I’ll steer you to a very compre-
hensive Web site that describes all the standard services and even gives 
suggestions on which ones to disable (and leave alone). And as a bonus, the 
site provides information on Windows 7 services. Point your browser to www.

Selective Startups
Look down at the Windows taskbar. See all those little icons down there to 
the right? Do you even know what half of them are or what they do? I’ll tell 
you what they’re doing: Those potentially unused programs are consuming 
system memory and possibly processor cycles. On a traditional laptop or 
PC with lots of memory and a fast processor, it’s not a big deal. But on a net-
book, the more of the little goblins that inhabit the taskbar, the less snappy 
your little laptop will perform.
First things first. Click each of the icons to see what it is. All the programs in 
the taskbar are being automatically loaded when Windows starts up. If you 
don’t use the program, it’s silly to have it wasting resources.
Many programs that end up in the taskbar have an option that says Run at 
Startup or something similar. Try right- or left-clicking the icon to display a 

290
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
pop-up menu. You may need to do some sleuthing to find the location of the 
right setting, but just make sure the program doesn’t run when Windows 
starts.
Another way to find out which programs are run when Windows loads is to 
use MSConfig, which I introduce in the “Disable Services” section, earlier in 
this chapter. To run MSConfig, you need to
 
1. Choose Start➪Run.
 
2. Type msconfig and click OK.
 
3. Click the Startup tab.
A list of startup programs is displayed, as shown in Figure 19-3. A check mark 
next to an item means the program runs when Windows starts up. If you 
deselect the item and click the Apply or OK button, the program won’t run 
the next time Windows starts.
You’ll need to play detective with some of these programs to see what they 
are — many are part of the operating system and are required for your net-
book to work correctly, so don’t blindly turn off programs.
Use Google to search for a program’s name that appears in the list. For exam-
ple, if you searched for Reader_sl.exe, you’d find out it was Adobe Reader 
Speed Launch, a program that doesn’t really need to run at startup.

 Chapter 19: Optimizing Windows
Ditch the Glitz
I remember when Windows 3.0 came out. Wow, did it ever have a cutting-
edge, fancy user interface. Today, it looks quaint and antiquated in compari-
son with the animated, eye-popping operating system interfaces you find in 
the current versions of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
There was a reason earlier generations of Windows didn’t have all those 
glitzy interface features you see on present day operating systems. That 
reason was performance — computers of the time just didn’t have the power 
to do all the fancy graphics stuff you see today.
By default, Windows XP has a number of graphics features turned on that 
enhance the user interface. If you turn them off, you free up processor cycles 
and memory. Here’s how:
 
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore from the pop-up menu.
 
 Windows Explorer appears.
 
2. Right-click My Computer and choose Properties.
 
 The System Properties dialog box appears
 
3. Click the Advanced tab.
 
4. Click the Settings button under Performance.
 
 The Performance Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-4. 
Here you find a variety of user interface visual effects. You have two 
options to increase system performance:
 
• Select the Adjust for Best Performance radio button. This turns off all 
the different graphics interface options shown in the list.
 
• Select the Custom radio button. With this choice, only the visual 
effects options that are selected are used. Turn off any effects you 
don’t want to run.
 
5. Click OK to save your changes and you’re done.
I have to warn you, though: Turning off all the graphics effects is probably 
going to seem odd at first. Your eyes tell you something seems just a little off, 
and you can’t quite put your finger on what it is. If you don’t like the results, 
try turning selected effects on and off. Or, go back and enable all the effects 
again.

visual

boost.
 
 
Pictures of puppies, landscapes, children (or whatever) for your desktop back-
ground add a nice personal touch to your netbook. However, a custom back-
ground also consumes system memory. Consider using a simple, solid color 
instead. It’s boring but efficient.
Industrial Space Saving
Aside from uninstalling programs and temporary files you don’t use (as I 
mention earlier), if you have an extremely space-constrained netbook, you 
need to perform some industrial-strength space saving. You can tweak sev-
eral Windows features to maximize your storage space, as I describe in the 
following sections.
 
These space-saving tips are primarily for netbooks with small solid state 
drives. Don’t feel compelled to use them if you have a netbook with a hard 
disk drive — unless you’re really trying to scrimp on space.

293
 Chapter 19: Optimizing Windows
Compression
You may not know it, but Windows has a feature that allows you to save drive 
space by compressing individual folders or the entire drive. Here’s how to do it.
To compress a folder, take these steps:
 
1. Right-click the folder and choose Properties.
 
 The folder Properties dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
 The Advanced Attributes dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Compress Contents to Save Disk Space check box, as shown 
in Figure 19-5.
 
4. Click OK.
 
Figure 19-5: 
Compress 
a folder to 
save space.
 
Any files in the folder (or that are moved to the folder in the future) are auto-
matically compressed. When you open a file in the folder, Windows transpar-
ently uncompresses it to allow program access. When the file is closed, it’s 
compressed again.
 
You can also compress individual files using the same technique.
To compress the entire drive, here’s what you do:
 
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore from the pop-up menu.
 
 Windows Explorer appears.

294
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
2. Right-click on the C: drive and choose Properties.
 
 The (C:) Properties dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Compress Drive to Save Disk Space check box, as shown in 
Figure 19-6.
 
4. Click OK.
Windows begins compressing the drive. The length of time it takes depends 
on the size of the drive and how full it is.
 
Figure 19-6: 
Compress 
the drive to 
save space.
 
Compressing the entire drive might seem like a good idea, but keep in mind 
that although available space increases, your performance may decrease. 
When programs and certain system files are compressed, they must be 
uncompressed before they can be run or used. This can really slow down 
your system.
Page file
In addition to system memory (commonly known as RAM), modern operat-
ing systems also rely on something called virtual memory. Virtual memory is 
drive space that’s treated as memory. Windows allocates a certain amount 
of drive space and reads and writes data to it, thus extending the physical 
memory.
By default, Windows XP allocates 1.5 times the amount of physical memory 
for virtual memory — so with a netbook that has 1GB of RAM, 1.5GB of drive 

295
 Chapter 19: Optimizing Windows
space is used for virtual memory. Virtual memory is kept in a page file, also 
known as a swap file, as data is being swapped in and out of it.
Needless to say, on a netbook with a small solid state drive, virtual memory 
can consume a big chunk of space. Here’s how to turn it off:
 
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore from the pop-up menu.
 
 Windows Explorer appears.
 
2. Right-click My Computer and choose Properties.
 
 The System Properties dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Advanced tab.
 
4. Click the Settings button under Performance.
 
 The Performance Options dialog box appears.
 
5. Click the Advanced tab.
 
6. Under Virtual Memory, click the Change button.
 
 The Virtual Memory settings dialog box is displayed, as shown in 
Figure 19-7. 
 
7. Change the size of the page file (or elect not to use it). When you’re 
done, click OK. 
 
 Windows restarts and resizes (or removes) the existing page file.
 
If you decide to ditch the page file, you’ll have to make do with whatever phys-
ical memory you have installed in your netbook. Try to single-task and not 
open lots of browser tabs to avoid Windows complaining about running out of 
memory. If your netbook’s performance really suffers after disabling swapping, 
turn it back on.
Hibernation
Windows XP has two ways of putting your netbook to sleep when you won’t 
be using it for awhile.
 
✓ Standby: This is an energy-saving mode where the monitor and drive are 
turned off and your netbook uses less power.
 
✓ Hibernate: In this mode, Windows writes an image of the system state 
and everything in memory to the drive and then shuts down your net-
book. When you come out of hibernation, your netbook is exactly the 
same as you left it, with the same programs running and files open — no 
booting required.

296
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
Figure 19-7: 
Change 
the page 
file size 
or disable 
swapping to 
save space.
 
Hibernation is great for shutting down your netbook for the night or the 
weekend, but Windows needs to store that sleepy bear data someplace. Figure 
the amount of system memory you have plus a little more will be written to 
disk — for example, a 1GB netbook needs a bit more than 1GB of disk space 
to support hibernation.
If you’re tight on drive space, turn off hibernation. In the Windows Control 
Panel, go to Power Options, and on the Hibernate tab, deselect the Enable 
Hibernation check box.
System Restore
Windows has a slick feature called System Restore that allows you to roll 
back system settings and installed programs to a previous point in time. It’s 
very useful if your netbook starts misbehaving after you install a new pro-
gram or update. (I talk more about this feature in Chapter 17.)
The downside to System Restore is its associated data takes up space. A cer-
tain amount of drive space is allocated to save all the data included with a 
restore point. However, you can turn off System Restore or change how much 
space is allocated by doing the following:
 
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 Windows Explorer appears.
 
2. Right-click My Computer and select Properties.
 
 The System Properties dialog box appears.

297
 Chapter 19: Optimizing Windows
 
3. Click the System Restore tab.
 
 System Restore options are displayed, as shown in Figure 19-8. 
 
4. Either turn off System Restore or use the slider bar to change the 
amount of space the service uses. Then click OK. 
 
 Reducing the space does reduce the number of restore points that can 
be saved.
 
Figure 19-8: 
Save space 
by turning 
System 
Restore off 
or changing 
the amount 
of space it 
uses.
 
 
There’s a case for weighing the usefulness of System Restore with the amount 
of space it takes up. My recommendation is if you’ve been running Windows 
on other computers for awhile and have never used System Restore, consider 
disabling it on your netbook if you need the extra space.

Discovering Drivers
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know drivers
▶ Determining driver versions
▶ Downloading updated drivers
▶ Installing a driver
T
his chapter isn’t about using a netbook to keep track of your golf clubs 
or how to discover whether hackers known as war drivers are eaves-
dropping on your netbook’s Wi-Fi connection.
The drivers that I’m talking about are device drivers — software that allows 
Windows and other programs to interface with your netbook’s hardware, 
such as its wireless LAN card, webcam, and SD memory card reader.
Device drivers come preinstalled on your netbook and work quietly behind 
the scenes — you don’t need to run the programs or usually even worry about 
them. However, there may come a time that you need to install a driver, down-
load a new version of one, or are just curious about what drivers are all about. 
You’ve come to the right place, because that’s what I cover in this chapter.
The Dope on Drivers
For the most part, you can go through life being blissfully unaware of device 
drivers. They sit unnoticed in the background, chugging away, doing the 
important job of interfacing with various hardware components. Both 
Windows and other programs rely on drivers to use hardware such as wire-
less cards, webcams, sound cards, and more. If a correct driver isn’t installed 
or a driver file becomes corrupted, the hardware device won’t work. Bummer. 
Then you’re forced to come up to speed on drivers.

300
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
Generally, there are three types of device drivers:
 
✓ System drivers: These drivers come with Windows and are part of the 
operating system. Microsoft includes drivers for many different kinds of 
popular hardware products.
 
✓ Computer manufacturer drivers: These drivers are provided by the PC 
manufacturer based on a specific computer’s hardware components. 
These drivers, as well as the system drivers, are preinstalled on your 
netbook.
 
 Drivers tend to be netbook model specific. That means although the 
same hardware component may be used in a number of different net-
books, you should use only a driver the manufacturer says is for your 
little laptop.
 
✓ Third-party hardware drivers: Certain types of add-on hardware may 
require a driver to be installed for the product to work correctly — 
printers are a good example. These drivers are provided on CD-ROMs 
or DVDs that come with the hardware (or from support Web sites). You 
need to install the driver if it doesn’t come with Windows.
Essential netbook drivers
Lots of drivers are preinstalled on your net-
book (many are part of the Windows operating 
system). Here’s a list of common drivers that 
manufacturers put on your netbook to ensure 
all those nifty hardware features work as 
advertised:
 ✓ Audio: Interfaces with the sound card for 
playing and recording audio.
 ✓ Bluetooth: Controls the Bluetooth card (if 
present).
 ✓ Camera: Communicates with the webcam.
 ✓ Card reader: Interfaces with the memory 
card reader.
 ✓ Chipset: Interfaces with the processor and 
other integrated chips.
 ✓ Graphics: Communicates with the graphics 
processor.
 ✓ LAN: Controls the network card.
 ✓ Power: Controls power consumption 
options. 
 ✓ VGA: Interfaces with an external display 
device such as a monitor or projector.
 ✓ Wireless LAN: Provides Wi-Fi functionality 
with the wireless card.
Some manufacturers may provide additional 
drivers depending on the netbook features, such 
as for a 3G (as in Third Generation) modem, TV 
tuner, or GPS receiver. All these drivers (the 
type will vary depending on the netbook make 
and model) should be available on the manufac-
turer’s support Web site.

301
 Chapter 20: Discovering Drivers
A device driver is a program — just like a word processor, a spreadsheet, or 
an operating system. That means it can have bugs (that need to be fixed), or 
whoever wrote the program may have released updated versions with new 
features or functionality.
What I’m getting at is it’s not uncommon for Microsoft and netbook and hard-
ware device manufacturers to release updated versions of their drivers — 
which I talk about next.
Updating Drivers
Perhaps you were reading on a netbook Web forum that a new version of 
a wireless driver is available. Or maybe you’re having problems with your 
netbook and someone suggests you get an updated release of the webcam 
driver. Where do you get updated drivers from and how do you install them?
First off, updating a device driver is usually a three-step process:
 
1. Find out what version of the driver you have.
 
2. Check what the latest version of the driver is, and if there’s a newer 
version, download it.
 
3. Install the driver.
 
Some netbook manufacturers automate the entire process by providing a 
utility program that connects to a support Web site, compares driver ver-
sions, and downloads and installs the correct drivers (if you don’t have the 
latest version). Check your user manual or online Help to see whether you 
have this option.
In the coming sections, I give you the details on each of these three steps.
Determining the installed version
You need to know what version of an installed device driver you have before 
you can find out whether a newer version is available. To determine the ver-
sion, run the Windows Device Manager. Here’s how:
In Windows XP (Classic File Manager view)
 
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel➪System.
 
2. On the Hardware tab, click Device Manager.

302
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
In Windows XP (Category File Manager view)
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Performance and Maintenance➪System.
 
2. On the Hardware tab, click Device Manager.
In Windows 7
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪System and Security➪Device Manager.
Next, with the Device Manager running (as shown in Figure 20-1), select a 
driver you want to get information about.
 
Figure 20-1: 
Windows 
Device 
Manager 
displays 
hardware 
devices.
 
Hardware devices are organized by type — for example, the Disk Drives item 
contains information about internal drives. Click the plus sign (+) to the left 
of a hardware device type icon to expand the list. (The Network Adapters 
item is shown expanded in Figure 20-1.)
 
When a list is expanded, the plus sign turns into a minus sign (–). Click the 
minus sign to condense the list.
With the selected hardware device, right-click and choose Properties from 
the pop-up menu. A Properties dialog box is displayed. Click the Driver tab to 
get details about the driver, as shown in Figure 20-2. The release date and ver-
sion number are shown.

303
 Chapter 20: Discovering Drivers
Make a note of the version number and release date. You need this to find out 
whether the driver is current.
 
Figure 20-2:

and release

Getting the latest version
When you know which version of a driver your netbook is running, it’s time 
to see whether a newer release is available.
 
Device driver updates are free. You may have to register to download a driver, 
but you won’t have to pay for it.
Go to the manufacturer’s support Web site for your netbook. There will be a 
download section where you can get the latest versions of drivers and util-
ity programs. (You may need to do a little bit of hunting because sometimes 
manufacturers bury downloadable files in the oddest places or make you 
jump through all sorts of hoops to get to them.)
After you specify your netbook model, a list of available files is displayed. 
Read through the list until you find the driver you’re interested in and then 
take a look at the information provided about it. An example is shown in 
Figure 20-3.
Compare the driver version number and release date on the support site with 
the driver version that’s currently on your netbook — remember, you wrote 
it down:

304
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
✓ If the versions are the same, there’s no sense in downloading the 
driver — unless you suspect the driver on your netbook may have 
become corrupted and you’re planning to reinstall it.
 
✓ If the support site has a newer version of the driver, follow the instruc-

Some manufacturers provide a CD-ROM or DVD that contains all the required 
drivers for your netbook. If a device isn’t working properly and you suspect a 
corrupted driver file may be the culprit, you can use a driver from the disc 
instead of downloading one from the manufacturer support site. Additionally, 
if you have to reinstall Windows, you may need to install these drivers so 
your netbook works correctly. You need an external drive to access these 
files. If you don’t have one, download the drivers from the support Web site 
with another computer and then transfer them to your netbook with a USB 
flash drive.
Installing the update
After you’ve obtained a device driver (either downloaded or from a CD-ROM 
that came with your netbook), the installation process is straightforward. 
Here’s what you do:

305
 Chapter 20: Discovering Drivers
 
1. Follow the steps listed in the section, “Determining the installed 
version,” earlier in this chapter, to run the Device Manager.
 
2. In the Device Manager, select the device driver you want to update.
 
3. Right-click the selected driver and choose Update Driver from the 
pop-up menu.
 
4. Follow the Hardware Update Wizard prompts and instructions.
Specify the location of the updated driver — either downloaded to your hard 
drive, on a USB flash drive, or on the manufacturer CD-ROM. There is an 
option that queries a Microsoft Internet site for updated drivers, but because 
you already have the driver you need, asking Windows to search for a newer 
version isn’t necessary.
 
If you decide to use the search feature instead of manually downloading a 
driver from a manufacturer site, keep in mind that searching works great for 
system drivers but may not always find the latest manufacturer drivers.
Windows then replaces the current device driver with the one you specify. 
You may need to restart your netbook for the new driver to start working — 
Windows lets you know if that’s the case.
To update or not
If you discover that a new version of a driver 
is available, should you automatically down-
load and install it? Newer is better, right? The 
computer industry has done a very good job of 
training all of us to believe that’s the case. But 
hold on a minute.
Personally, I believe in the old adage of “if it’s 
not broken, don’t fix it.” Unless I have a very 
compelling reason to use a new release of a 
driver, I generally won’t update an older ver-
sion. Unless you have a bit of a technical bent, 
the update process can be a bit confusing as 
well as time consuming — especially if your 
netbook doesn’t work correctly after a new 
driver version is installed.
At the very least, I’ll get as much information 
as I possibly can to help me decide whether to 
update. That includes
 ✓ Checking out the read-me file that comes 
with the driver. This file usually contains 
some notes on what’s new and has been 
changed.
 ✓ Reviewing netbook forums to see whether I 
can find any user comments about a newly 
released driver.
Even if I do decide to update, I won’t do it imme-
diately unless the driver is supposed to fix a bug 
that I’ve been cursing about for awhile. I like 
to wait at least a few weeks after a release to 
make sure it’s stable — and let other users play 
test pilot ahead of me.

306
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
 
As always, check your user manual, the manufacturer’s support site, or a net-
book forum for specific information about upgrading drivers on your particu-
lar model.
 
Windows is only halfway intelligent when it comes to upgrading drivers. It’s 
possible to replace a driver with one that’s not compatible with a hardware 
component. When that happens, at the very least the hardware won’t work — 
at the worst, the hardware won’t work and Windows will become unstable. 
Always make sure you have the right driver. If you get yourself in trouble, try 
using the Roll Back Driver command in the device Properties dialog box, 
shown earlier in Figure 20-2.

IOS stands for basic input/output system. This is firmware (a program in 
hardware) that runs when a computer starts up. The BIOS recognizes 
and initializes various system hardware components, such as storage drives, 
the keyboard, video card, and other devices. This startup process gets the 
computer ready for Windows (or some other operating system) to load and 
take charge.
You may have been using computers for years and never had to deal with 
BIOS before, so why am I devoting a chapter to it in this book? The answer is 
that netbooks may require you to work with the BIOS more than your average 
laptop or desktop PC does — at least that’s what some evidence suggests.
I don’t want to say it’s certain you’ll have to muck around with your netbook’s 
BIOS, but just in case you do, this chapter prepares you. I describe what the 
BIOS is and how it works, how to access and change netbook BIOS settings, 
and the pros and cons of updating the BIOS, and even how to do the updating.
Boiling Down BIOS
As I mention in the introduction, BIOS (basic input/output system) is program 
code that runs when your netbook is powered on. The purpose of BIOS is 
to make sure essential hardware components are working correctly before 
Windows loads and runs. In addition, the BIOS also contains a library of code 
used to control the keyboard and display and to store different system settings.

308
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
The BIOS is incorporated into a chip — a CMOS (complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor) chip, to be precise. This chip contains rewritable memory, 
and it’s possible to update the BIOS code with new versions — a process 
commonly known as flashing, which I talk about later in this chapter, in the 
section “Updating the BIOS.”
A handful of companies manufacture BIOS for computers — a few of the more 
popular brands are AMI, Award, and Phoenix. Netbook manufacturers install 
BIOS chips with code customized to work with their little laptops on system 
motherboards, the board that contains the brains of the computer, including 
the processor, memory, and graphics processor.
That’s BIOS boiled down without getting into the real geeky stuff. The reason 
I’m bringing you up to speed on BIOS has to do with an observation: I’ve 
been hanging around personal computers for a long time now, and for some 
reason, I see netbook users mentioning more BIOS-related issues than tradi-
tional PC users. For example, here’s a sampling of topics frequently discussed 
in netbook user Web forums:
 
✓ My webcams aren’t working because of a BIOS setting.
 
✓ My wireless isn’t working after a BIOS update.
 
✓ What’s involved in changing the BIOS boot order sequence to use an 
operating system on an SD card?
 
✓ My netbook died after a failed BIOS upgrade.
 
✓ Should I change the processor speed in BIOS?
I don’t exactly know what the BIOS fixation is (and personally, I’ve never had 
any BIOS-related problems with any of the netbooks I’ve used), but I decided 
it was best to devote some time to the subject — just in case.
 
The best place on the Web to get detailed information on all sorts of aspects of 
BIOS is Wim’s BIOS site at www.wimsbios.com.
Getting to the BIOS Settings
All BIOSes have a setup program for changing settings. To run the program, 
you need to press a certain key (or keys) right after you turn on the netbook.
 
Some netbook user manuals refer to the time that immediately follows press-
ing the power button as POST (power-on self test). POST checks your hard-
ware to ensure that necessary components are present and working.

309
 Chapter 21: BIOS Basics
On some netbooks, a startup screen briefly appears. Somewhere on the 
screen, a message, such as Press F2 to run setup, tells you which 
key(s) you need to press to edit BIOS settings. When you see the screen, 
press the key.
Other netbooks don’t include a helpful reminder screen before Windows 
starts to load — the screen is disabled in a BIOS setting that speeds up boot 
time. If this is the case, you’ll need to press the BIOS setup key(s) immedi-
ately after you press the netbook power button.
Unfortunately, the computer industry has never standardized on a common 
key sequence to get to the BIOS settings — the key(s) will vary depending on 
your netbook manufacturer and the BIOS used.
Some common key sequences for running the BIOS setup program include:
 
✓ Del
 
✓ Esc
 
✓ F1
 
✓ F2
 
✓ Ctrl+Alt+Esc
Your user manual (or the manufacturer support Web site) will tell you which 
key(s) works for your netbook.
 
Some netbooks are very picky about exactly when you need to press the key. If 
pressing and holding the correct key doesn’t bring up the setup program, 
restart your netbook and then try rapidly and repeatedly pressing the key.
Changing BIOS Settings
When you press the appropriate key(s), a very old-school text screen 
appears, and it looks similar to what’s shown in Figure 21-1. Information 
about your netbook (including the memory, processor type and speed, and 
BIOS version) is displayed. 
Congratulations! You’re now running the BIOS setup program, where you can 
make various system changes.
 
This isn’t the place to be changing settings for things you don’t understand. If 
you don’t know what you’re doing (and why you’re doing it), you can mess 
your netbook up pretty good — as in bad. Don’t play around with BIOS set-
tings unless you have to, and even then, be careful.

Navigating the screens
If you’re used to Windows, don’t expect fancy fonts, graphics, or icons in the 
BIOS setup program. Heck, you can’t even use your mouse to select menu 
items. Instead, expect a text-based interface that looks like it escaped from 
the 1980s. You even have to use your keyboard to navigate the screen.
The BIOS setup program has different screens that are organized around 
types of settings. The screen names appear at the top of the screens — 
they’re like tabs. For example, all the security-related settings may appear on 
a screen named Security.
A list showing available keyboard commands always appears on the screen, 
so you’ll know how to navigate the screens. As an example, here’s a quick 
rundown of various AMI BIOS commands:
 
✓ Right- and left-arrow keys: Selects a screen — click one of the arrow 
keys to move to the next or previous screen. The currently selected 
screen name is highlighted at the top of the window.
 
✓ Up- and down-arrow keys: Selects a setting in the current screen. Brief 
information about the setting and commands appears to the right.
 
✓ Plus (+) and minus (–) keys: Changes an option — the currently selected 
option is highlighted in white.
 
✓ Enter: Selects a setting and displays another screen with additional 
related settings.

311
 Chapter 21: BIOS Basics
 
✓ Tab: On settings that have multiple fields, moves to a field. For example, 
if you were changing the system time setting, pressing Tab would move 
between the hours, minutes, and seconds fields.
 
✓ Esc: Exits the current screen. If you press Esc in any of the main screens, 
you’re asked whether you want to save your changes before you quit 
setup.
 
✓ F1: Displays a Help dialog box with commands. Press Esc to close the 
dialog box.
 
✓ F10: Saves any changes you’ve made and exits the setup program.
 
If a dialog box with buttons is displayed, use Tab to move between the buttons 
and press Enter to click a button.
After you exit, the setup program closes, your netbook continues booting, 
and Windows starts.
 
The preceding commands are found in the AMI (American Megatrends, Inc.) 
BIOS setup utility. Depending on which BIOS your netbook comes with, the 
commands may be different.
Setting options
The BIOS setup program allows you to change a number of system settings — 
think of it as a low-level Windows Control Panel for netbook hardware. You 
can change many settings, but in the following sections, I focus on those most 
important to netbook users.
Hardware
The BIOS contains settings for a number of hardware devices, including
 
✓ LAN: Wired network card
 
✓ Audio: Sound card
 
✓ Card reader: SD memory card reader
 
✓ Camera: Webcam (if built-in)
 
✓ WLAN: Wireless network card
 
✓ Bluetooth: Bluetooth wireless (if built-in)
 
In the popular AMI BIOS, these settings are found in the Onboard Devices 
Configuration item in the Advanced screen.

312
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
These hardware devices can all be enabled or disabled. Use the + (plus) key 
to enable a selected item or the – (minus) key to disable an item.
If one or more of these hardware components aren’t working on your net-
book, check whether it’s enabled. If a setting is disabled, that particular 
device won’t function. If you enable the device, save the change, and then 
exit the setup program, there’s a good chance you will just have solved your 
problem.
 
Some of these hardware components can be turned on and off with function 
keys. Try enabling a device that doesn’t work with a function key first before 
running the BIOS setup program and changing settings — it’s much easier. 
Check your user manual for details.
Boot
These settings control your netbook’s boot (startup) options, including
 
✓ Boot Device Priority: Sets the booting order of storage devices. For 
example, you could specify that your netbook boots from an operating 
system installed on an SD card (if present) before Windows on the hard 
drive loads and runs.
 
 Most netbooks have a key command for selecting which device to boot 
from. When you press a certain key after you power on the netbook, a 
dialog box appears and allows you to choose the boot device (SD card 
reader, internal hard drive, or external drive). Check your user manual 
for more information.
 
✓ Boot Settings: Many netbooks have a BIOS option that speeds up booting 
by skipping some startup tests — as well as the startup screen. You can 
enable or disable this setting here. In most cases, it doesn’t hurt to disable 
startup tests. If you do, and at some point your netbook doesn’t seem to 
be working correctly, enable the tests. If there’s some type of hardware 
problem, information about it will appear after you turn on the netbook.
Security
Several different security settings in BIOS are available to protect your net-
book. If you’re storing sensitive information on your little laptop, consider 
using one or more of the following options:
 
✓ User Password: This setting requires a password when the netbook 
starts up. If you don’t get it right, you’re out of luck.
 
✓ Supervisor Password: With this setting, you need a password to access 
the BIOS setup program. If the supervisor password isn’t set, anyone 
who knows the user password can change it in the BIOS setup program. 
If the supervisor password is set, it’s impossible to reset the user pass-
word without knowing the supervisor password.

313
 Chapter 21: BIOS Basics
 
✓ HDD User Password: If this option is enabled, the netbook’s hard drive 
won’t be accessible until a correct password is entered. Some BIOS ver-
sions use encryption to secure the drive. (See Chapter 9, where I discuss 
software encryption options.)
 
✓ HDD Master Password: Similar to the supervisor password, if a master 
hard drive password is set, you need to correctly enter it in order to 
change the HDD User Password. Yes, it’s a password you need to enter 
to change another password. For years, BIOS users have been scratching 
their heads over these rather confusing collections of password setting.
 
If you use BIOS passwords, be sure to write them down and keep them in a 
safe place. If you forget them, it can be difficult (or sometimes impossible) to 
access a protected netbook.
 
There are ways of defeating BIOS security, depending on the computer. This 
means two things:
 
✓ BIOS security measures won’t stop a determined and skilled adversary 
from getting into your netbook — they can stop most people, but not 
everyone.
 
✓ If you forget your password, there’s some possible hope. Do some 
Google searching on BIOS password for more.
CPU
Some netbook models contain a BIOS setting for controlling the speed of the 
processor. The faster a processor runs, the more power it draws. By reducing 
the speed of the processor, you increase battery life. To better handle high-
definition video, some manufacturers offer an option of running the proces-
sor faster than its advertised speed (known as overclocking). The downsides 
to overclocking are battery life is decreased and the computer runs hotter.
Updating the BIOS
Manufacturers often release updates to a netbook’s BIOS for fixing bugs and 
adding new features — remember that the BIOS code is stored in a chip with 
rewritable memory. Many netbooks include programs for updating to the 
latest version of the BIOS — this is commonly known as flashing, but it has 
nothing to do with a seedy-looking character in a trench coat. In general, 
none of this sounds out of the ordinary. In fact it probably sounds like a 
common software update, the kind where you check whether there’s a new 
release, download and install it, and everyone’s happy.

314
Part IV: Checking Underneath the Hood 
Not so fast. Despite appearances, it’s really not that simple, and many net-
book manufacturers are a little guilty of glossing over some important details 
that could bite you in the behind.
What the friendly user manuals often neglect to mention is if something goes 
wrong during a BIOS update, there’s a chance you’ll turn your netbook into a 
brick — or, to quote an old Monty Python skit, “it will be pushing up the daisies.”
If corrupt code or data gets written to the BIOS while flashing, the odds are 
good that your netbook’s motherboard won’t be able to communicate with 
hardware components. Trying to flash the BIOS a second time may not help 
either.
If this happens while your netbook is under warranty, off it goes to the manu-
facturer, and you patiently wait for a replacement laptop to arrive — you did 
back up your files, I hope.
If the BIOS gets messed up after your warranty expires, it probably means 
buying a new netbook. (It’s possible to install a new BIOS chip or mother-
board, but considering the servicing costs, it usually makes more economic 
sense to opt for a whole new computer.)
 
Computer and BIOS manufacturers are aware of the risks that BIOS updates 
pose and typically include some safeguard measures during the update pro-
cess. However, these safety procedures aren’t infallible. If you suspect you’ve 
messed up the BIOS, consult the netbook manufacturer’s support site to see 
whether you can find utilities or procedures that might help you get your net-
book working again.
When it comes to BIOS upgrades, I’m an advocate of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix 
it.” Unless you have a compelling reason to update the BIOS (such as a known 
hardware bug that’s been troubling you gets fixed in a new BIOS version), 
don’t.
Just because a new version of the BIOS is available, don’t rush out and 
update — avoid the Pavlovian response of automatically updating whenever 
a manufacturer rings the “new version” bell.
Usually a manufacturer supplies a list of what’s been fixed or added in new 
BIOS releases — although the information can be pretty terse and sometimes 
difficult to understand. If you’re having an issue that seems related to one of 
the described fixes, consider updating — but recognize the risks, especially if 
the warranty on your netbook has expired.

315
 Chapter 21: BIOS Basics
 
When a new version of a BIOS is released, there’s often lots of discussion 
about it in netbook Web forums. You may glean some insights from other 
users who’ve already installed an update as to whether a specific problem 
has been fixed. Be suspicious about reports of faster boot times. It seems like 
any time a new BIOS is released, someone is always claiming his computer 
(whether it’s a netbook, laptop or desktop PC) starts up faster — even if 
there were no changes to boot-specific code. Oh well.
Check your user manual or the manufacturer’s Web support site for details 
on updating your netbook’s BIOS. Updating is usually done with a supplied 
utility program or by downloading a BIOS file to an SD card and pressing a 
key sequence after the netbook is powered on — the BIOS file on the SD card 
replaces the current BIOS.
BIOS update hints
If you decide to flash your BIOS, here are a few 
hints to ensure a successful experience:
 ✓ Always update the BIOS with the netbook 
plugged into an electrical outlet. Losing 
power midway through a BIOS flash is a 
recipe for disaster.
 ✓ Make sure your battery is fully charged just 
in case the main power goes out.
 ✓ Never turn off or reset your netbook during 
a BIOS flash.
 ✓ Follow the manufacturer’s update instruc-
tions to the letter. Read through the direc-
tions several times so you understand 
them. If something doesn’t make sense, 
try searching on Google for your netbook 
model and the keywords BIOS update — 
you’ll find tutorials and user commentary 
that helps explain unclear steps.
 ✓ Make sure you get the right BIOS for your 
netbook. Flashing a BIOS update for another 
model can cause big trouble.
 ✓ Use the most recent version of the BIOS 
update utility — check the manufacturer’s 
Web site.
 ✓ If you’ve overclocked your netbook (per-
formed a tweak to speed up the processor 
to get it to run faster), be aware that flash-
ing a new BIOS can possibly lock up your 
little laptop.
 ✓ If there’s a way to flash the BIOS with-
out running a utility program from within 
Windows, do it. I’ve heard of instances 
where Windows processes and antivirus 
software have messed up a BIOS update. 
Play it safe if you can.
Good luck!

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
elcome to The Part of Tens. If you’re a connoisseur 
of other fine For Dummies books, you’ve undoubt-
edly noticed that all For Dummies titles have this part — 
and who am I to break with tradition?
For your reading pleasure, in this part you find a chapter 
that lists essential Internet information resources for 
netbooks and another that describes ten netbook 
hardware hacks.

Chapter 22
Top Ten Internet 
Netbook Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Netbook manufacturer support Web sites
▶ Netbook Web forums
▶ Netbook news and review sites
You can find a tremendous amount of technical support information 
about netbooks available on the Internet. Some of it comes from official 
sources (like manufacturer Web sites), but an increasing amount is provided 
by individual netbook users who are passionate about their little laptops and 
want to spread the word as well as help other users. In this chapter, I list the 
top places to get free technical support for your netbook.
In addition to these sites, I point you toward some of the best Net sources 
for netbook news and reviews. The netbook world is always changing — new 
products are released, old products are dropped, hot technologies emerge, 
and so on. If you want to stay up on the latest happenings, these news and 
review Web sites are indispensable.
Also, I guess I lied when I said I’d cover only the top ten Net resources — it’s 
more like the top 40. But you don’t mind that, do you? I didn’t think so. Here 
they are.
Official Support
When you need netbook technical support, the place to go is the World Wide 
Web. The first stop should be your netbook manufacturer’s Web site. Here 
you find how to get technical support, software updates you can download, 
user manuals, and additional information about your netbook.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
When I’m checking out support sites, I always use my primary computer for 
the browsing, with my netbook running at its side. That makes it easy to 
read directions on the main PC and then do whatever you need to do on 
your netbook.
Because netbook manufacturers are international companies, they often have 
a different Web site for each country or region. Considering that, I list the 
primary Web addresses for the major netbook manufacturers. From here you 
can click until you find a support site for where you live — often localized in 
your language.
 
✓ Acer, www.acer.com
 
✓ ASUS, www.asus.com
 
✓ Dell, www.dell.com
 
✓ Everex, www.everexstore.com/everex
 
✓ Fujitsu, www.fujitsu.com/global/services/computing
 
✓ HP, www.hp.com
 
✓ LG, www.lg.com
 
✓ Lenovo, www.lenovo.com
 
✓ MSI, www.msimobile.com
 
✓ One Laptop per Child (OLPC), www.laptop.org
 
✓ Samsung, www.samsung.com
 
✓ Toshiba, www.toshiba.com
If you don’t see your netbook manufacturer in this list, enter the company’s 
name in Google and jump to the manufacturer’s Web site.
 
I’ve found netbook manufacturer information (especially downloads) can vary 
among different country Web sites. If you feel like doing a little globe-trotting 
and exploring, try checking out various international sites.
Functional Forums
If you’re having problems with your netbook and can’t get a good answer from 
an official support site, visit a Web forum. A number of user communities have 
popped up around popular brands and models of netbooks. I’ve found at times 
I can get faster and more accurate information from these unofficial sources 
than I can from an official manufacturer’s technical support site.

321
 Chapter 22: Top Ten Internet Netbook Resources
All access to these forums is free so that anyone can read them, but if you 
want to post a message, you’ll need to register for a free account. If you’re 
new to netbook forums, I have several pieces of advice:
 
✓ Read through the forum posts first to get a general idea of how the 
group works. Also, if you have a question, there’s a pretty good chance 
it may have already been answered in the past. It’s also not a bad idea to 
read any FAQs (Frequently Asked Question lists) or wikis that are associ-
ated with the forum.
 
✓ Use the forum’s search function before you post a question. You 
should do this just in case the question has already been answered. 
Search for some pertinent keywords that relate to your question.
 
✓ When you post a question, provide as much detail as you can. Avoid 
“My netbook doesn’t work. What should I do?” A better approach is “My 
Eee PC 900A won’t boot after I accidentally left it on a picnic table over-
night and it rained.”
 
Although most forum “elders” are kind and provide sage wisdom, some can 
get a little grumpy, especially when they think someone isn’t asking a worth-
while question. Don’t sweat it if someone gets a little testy. It’s the Internet 
after all.
Here’s a collection of independent netbook forums to consult, organized 
alphabetically by brand:

News and Reviews
If you want to stay up-to-date with the latest on netbooks, you can turn to 
a number of Web sites and blogs. Here I tell you about the ones considered 
some of the best — presented in alphabetical order.
 
ASUS’s Eee PC was the first netbook to hit the market, and a lot of Web sites 
appeared with some variation of Eee in their names. However, the name 
doesn’t necessarily mean the site is only about Eee PCs. As netbook popular-
ity increased, many sites started covering all makes and models of netbooks 
but never changed their site names.
 
If you’re shopping for a new netbook, several of these sites not only provide 
news and reviews, but also have a deals section devoted to bargain-priced net-
books from various sources.

G
ood, Igor. You’re just in time. (Cue high voltage electricity arcing 
through the air in a dark, dank, evil scientist’s dungeon lair.) The sub-
ject is on the table, and I’m about ready to begin. Yes, I’m going to turn this 
mild mannered netbook into a . . . Bwah, ha, ha, ha!
If you’re one of those mad scientist types who’s never happy with things as 
they originally came from the manufacturer, because you just know you can 
make them better, this chapter is for you. Here I supply the inveterate tin-
kerer with ten (actually a few more than that, but who’s counting) hardware 
projects for modifying various models of netbooks.
 
I absolutely have to throw one of those little bomb icons in here. Be fore-
warned: Many of these projects require a steady soldering hand and a rudi-
mentary knowledge of electronics. There’s a good chance you can turn your 
netbook into a brick if you mess up — and forget about a manufacturer honor-
ing your warranty. 
With the disclaimers out of the way, please follow me down to the laboratory. 
Walk this way. (Even if you’re not planning on modding your netbook, it’s still 
fun to see what other people have done.)

Add a Keyboard Backlight
If you’re a touch typist who’s used to normal-size keys, using a netbook with 
a small keyboard can be a bit challenging — enough to make you look down 
at the keys every now and then. When the lights go out, it’s even worse — 
especially for hunt-and-peck typists. If you can’t see what you’re pressing, the 
typo count will be sky high.
The first hardware hack in this chapter is installing a keyboard backlight 
inside the case. This provides a soothing glow between the key spaces, softly 
illuminating the keyboard (as shown in Figure 23-1) — kind of like having a 
nightlight inside your netbook.
Popular Science has step-by-step instructions, using an Eee PC. The cost is 
under $15, and the work takes just a couple hours of your time. Check it out at

keyboard-backlight-under-15

Add Internal GPS
In Chapter 11, I tell you about using an external GPS receiver to turn your 
netbook into a nifty, nimble navigator. But wouldn’t it be nice if you could dis-
pense with the cables or Bluetooth connections and forget about yet another 
accessory to carry around?
Although a few netbooks are available with built-in GPS chips, most aren’t. 
However, with a little bit of hardware hacking, you can add GPS functionality 
to just about any netbook.

327
 Chapter 23: Ten Cool Hardware Hacks
Thanks to folks like Tom Beauchamp, adding GPS isn’t as hard as you might 
think. Tom bought a USB GPS receiver (shown in Figure 23-2) and engineered 
a way to fit it into his Dell Mini’s case. Tom shares instructions and photos 
with you in this informative forum post:
http://mydellmini.com/forum/integrated-gps-on-my-mini-
9-t167.html

receiver is

Swap in a Touch Screen
When netbooks first came out, a lot of users were clamoring for touch screen 
models. About two years later, manufacturers are finally starting to release 
little laptops that give you a tablet computing experience. But in the mean-
time, hardware hackers have been modifying existing netbooks right and left 
with touch panels — and if you’re a bit of a geek, you can too.
A good place to start is with netbook guru and blogger JKKMobile. He’s been 
building touch screen Eee PCs since a few months after they first hit the 
streets. Check out this URL for video instructions:

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
http://jkkmobile.blogspot.com/2007/12/asus-eee-pc-with-
touch-screen.html
From an engineering standpoint, it’s not that difficult to swap a default net-
book screen with a touch panel. With a little searching through Google or 
through Web forums devoted to your netbook make and model, you should 
be able to find hacking instructions — or people offering customized models. 
Or you could just wait and buy a new touch screen netbook.
Make Your Own Extended Battery
Do you want to power your netbook with an extended-life battery but don’t 
want to shell out the bucks to purchase a new one? No worries, because 
those crazy French hackers over at www.blogeee.net show you how — 
using an MSI Wind netbook as shown in Figure 23-3. Here’s the URL:
www.blogeee.net/2008/07/31/une-batterie-9-cellules-pour-
msi-wind-u100-faite-maison
Oops, I forgot to mention the tutorial is in French. There are enough photos 
to give you a pretty good idea of what the process is, but understanding the 
words that go with the pictures is always nice.
 
If your French is as bad as mine (or even worse), head over to Google’s free 
translation service at http://translate.google.com. Type in the Web 
address and specify to translate from French to English. Mon dieu! The transla-
tion is a bit fractured, but quite usable.

Mod the Case
An interesting subculture of hardware hackers known as case modders has 
cropped up. These artistic hackers hack the outside of a computer — and 
sometimes the insides, too. In a nutshell, they swap the original computer 
case for something infinitely cooler. Modders have put computers in man-
nequins, old radios, movie props, and just about anything you can possibly 
think of — do a Google search for case mods to see what I mean.
The popularity of netbooks is focusing modders’ attention on the little lap-
tops. For example, Figure 23-4 shows a sleek Eee PC crafted by a Japanese 
modder who ditched the original case and keyboard and turned it into a 
tablet PC. You can check out more photos at
http://dvice.com/archives/2009/02/gutted_eee_pc_d.php
Hack your Dell Mini
I have to hand it to Dell. Whereas other manu-
facturers treat the internals of their netbooks 
like state secrets, Dell happily provides the ser-
vice manual online for free.
If you’re a hardware hacker, you know how 
much easier it is to have the service manual 
available to find out about all the components 
and how they’re connected. For example, say 
you have a Mini 910 and want to swap out the 
built-in digital camera for something a bit better. 
No problem; just point your browser at
h t t p : / / s u p p o r t . d e l l . c o m /
support/edocs/systems/ins910/
en/sm/index.htm
You get step-by-step instructions, includ-
ing color photos. That’s what I call hardware 
hacker friendly — yet another reason why the 
Dell Minis are turning into a favorite of geeks.

No-Soldering Hardware Mods
I’ve always thought that if you’re going to hack hardware, you need a cool 
hand with a hot soldering iron. Touching the wrong component with the sol-
dering iron tip or blobbing solder in the wrong place is a recipe for disaster.
I was pretty amazed when I saw the following tutorial on installing a touch 
screen in an Eee PC with no soldering involved — and for under $50, mind 
you.
www.instructables.com/id/how_to_touchscreen_EEE_without_
soldering_/
The secret to holding everything together without the silver melty stuff is 
simply pieces of high-temperature tape. Wow, that opens up all sorts of pos-
sibilities for soldering-phobics.
Add a Second Memory Card Reader
One of the defining features of a netbook is a built-in SD memory card 
reader. The reader allows you to boot different operating systems and 
transfer photos from digital cameras — on first-generation netbooks, it was 
essential for expanding storage on models that came with low-capacity 
solid state drives.

331
 Chapter 23: Ten Cool Hardware Hacks
But more is always better, so why not add another memory card reader? 
After all, you do have two or more USB slots.
Your friends at Popular Science were so enamored with modding the Eee PC 
they ran a series of hardware hacking how-to articles. This article shows you 
how to install a microSD card reader (shown in Figure 23-5):

Flash (CF) card reader to another netbook brand at

Turn a Netbook into a Picture Frame
Digital picture frames were a big hit a few Christmases ago. The novelty has 
since worn off, and the prices have dropped, but that hasn’t stopped the 
hardware-hacking community from continuing to play around with the idea.
There’s an old saying that if you give a bored hacker some old hardware, you’ll 
probably be surprised at what that hacker comes up with. A case in point is a 
hacker who goes by the name of Q, who took a cheap, first-generation Eee PC 
and turned it into a digital picture. His meticulously documented how-to is here:

332

Q also has some detailed information on hacking Dell Minis elsewhere on 
his site.
Add an External Wi-Fi Antenna Jack
For a tiny PC, most netbooks get surprisingly good Wi-Fi reception — 
especially considering the space available for an internal antenna is much 
less compared to a full-size laptop.
However, there may be times when you want to boost reception with an 
external antenna — for example when war-driving, er, I mean, performing 
wireless security audits. Unfortunately, netbooks don’t come with PC card 
slots where the simple solution would be to purchase a Wi-Fi card that sup-
ported plugging in an external antenna.
But a hardware limitation can’t stop a determined hacker. In an excellent 
tutorial, Terry Porter shows you how to install an SMA jack into the back 
of an Eee PC (shown in Figure 23-6). When attached to an external antenna, 
signal strength for the built-in Wi-Fi card is considerably increased.
Here’s the Web address for more information:

Swiss Army Knife Mod an Eee PC
I love Swiss Army Knives — they feature tools of every manner and are ready 
for any job. And I have to give a tip of the hat to Torsten Lyngaas, who per-
formed one big Swiss Army Knife of a modification to an Eee PC. He stuffed 
over $400 of additional hardware into the little laptop, including a USB hub, 
GPS with antenna, Bluetooth, card reader, flash drive, new power switch, FM 
transmitter, modem, touch screen, temperature sensor, and heat sink.
The cool thing is that he provides detailed information about the parts he 
used and how he added them — complete with close-up photos. Check out 
his wiki at

Want to streamline your 
life with a netbook? Here’s 
what you need to know!
What’s smaller than a laptop, bigger than a cell phone, and 
keeps you connected? It’s the netbook, and this “real” book 
tells you how to pick the right one; use it for work, school, 
and play; and add bells, whistles, and anything else you 
might need. The book also covers all the operating systems 
that run on netbooks, including Linux®, Google™ Chrome, 
Windows® XP, Windows Vista®, and even Windows® 7.
•  Out of the box — set up your netbook, charge the battery, and 
sync it with your primary computer
•  Get connected — via Wi-Fi, 3G networks, Bluetooth®, or Ethernet
•  Do some work — explore Microsoft® Works, OpenOffice.org®, 
Google Apps™, and Zoho® productivity suites
•  Play time — discover free Internet radio, streaming video, and 
games you can play on your netbook
•  Keep up with your peeps — tweet and IM, keep up with Facebook 
friends, and make Skype phone calls
•  Even netbooks like accessories — check out ways to expand 
storage, protect your netbook with a case, and add a mouse
•  Safety first — find quality antivirus programs, firewalls, and 
encryption options
•  The maintenance mantra — learn about backing up and restoring 
your netbook, troubleshooting, and managing battery life
