An Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) is a graded depolarization due to influx of positive ions. 
 
An Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) is a graded hyperpolarization due to net influx of negative ions 
or net efflux of positive ions

Cholinergic Synapses 
Acetylcholine (ACh) = neurotransmitter 
Two types of receptors: 
Nicotinic- ligand gated ion channel (skeletal 
 
 muscle and brain) 
Muscarinic- G protein coupled (heart, 
 
smooth muscle, glands, brain) 

Adrenergic Synapses 
Catecholamines = neurotransmitters (tyrosine 
based) 
Norepinephrine 
Epinephrine 
Alpha and beta adrenergic receptors - 
 
G protein coupled  
 
act via second messengers 
 
(heart, smooth muscle, glands) 

Key Concepts 
Neurons process incoming information in dendrites and 
the soma by summing the post-synaptic membrane 
potential changes (graded potentials). Spatial summation 
is the addition of inputs occurring simultaneously within 
neighboring synapses. Temporal summation is the 
addition of inputs occurring very close to one another in 
time within the same synapse.    
 
Neurotransmitters transmit signals within milliseconds by 
binding receptors on the postsynaptic cell.
