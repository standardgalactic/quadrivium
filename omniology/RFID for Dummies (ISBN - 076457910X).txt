About the Author
As you may have guessed by the dangling participles and misused gerunds,
this is the first book by Patrick J. Sweeney II (despite Amazon’s link to
books on gynecology by an author of the same name). When not negotiating
with his editor to push back book deadlines, he leads ODIN technologies as
President and CEO.
ODIN technologies is a global RFID software and services company focusing
on RFID infrastructure. Mr. Sweeney is well recognized as a visionary in the
RFID industry with several RFID patents in various stages of approval. He has
appeared in such publications as CIO Magazine, The Washington Post, Fortune
magazine, Internet Week, and many others. He has been interviewed by ABC
news and CNN, among others, and is a frequent speaker worldwide on all
topics relating to RFID. He is also an active member of several standards
bodies and regulatory groups helping to shape the evolution of the RFID
industry.
Mr. Sweeney is a second-generation IT professional; his father was one of the
first employees at Electronic Data Systems (EDS), where “Pops” entertained
him and his brother on weekends by teaching them to read punch cards and
other useful skills. Mr. Sweeney took that genetic proclivity toward data cen-
ters and started a successful, secure managed hosting company in the late
1990s, which he later sold. His brother took that same early training and
started XS Speed Choppers, making custom motorcycles — go figure.
Mr. Sweeney finished second in the 1996 Olympic trials in the single scull, is
an avid outdoorsman, enjoys helping other entrepreneurs, and is passionate
about various Irish causes. He is a board member of Trinity College business
school in Dublin, Ireland, and an Alumni Board member at the Darden School
of Business at the University of Virginia. He graduated from Darden and
received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of New Hampshire.
He is blessed with a great family—wife Christen, daughter Shannon, son P.J.,
and three dogs. They live in Middleburg, Virginia, in a house full of useless
RFID gadgets.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to everyone who makes the dream of entrepreneur-
ship and innovation possible, from the brave men and women defending our
freedom in the armed forces, police, and fire departments to college profes-
sors, mentors, and angel investors.
Topping the list of people who make entrepreneurship (and crazy book pro-
jects) possible are loving, understanding, and helpful spouses like mine. This
book is especially dedicated to my beautiful wife Christen, who helps and
supports me as I build companies, write books, and travel around the world
chasing birds and the Red Sox.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost my family gets a big thanks for letting me bang away on
the laptop during dinner, in bed, and at other times made awkward because
an electronic device is the center of my world instead of them. Thanks Betty,
Shannon, and P.J.!
The book flow, formatting, and funniness (I recently learned that there is
called alliteration) is largely due to the great work of Becky Huehls at Wiley
who was my project editor and learned me all sorts of interesting things
about writing.
Of course the book wouldn’t even be possible if not for the guys in ODIN
technologies labs; Bret, Charles, Nick, Ray, Dave, and the rest of the crew
played an invaluable role, and they deserve a ton of updog.
I could not have written such a comprehensive book on this diverse technol-
ogy without significant contributions from some first-class industry experts.
Many of these folks contributed an entire chapter to the book, so although the
pronoun “I” is used throughout the book to stay consistent with Wiley’s For
Dummies style, much of the credit goes to an amazing team of contributors:

Introduction
S
omewhere, separated from you by just a few degrees, is not Kevin Bacon,
but an 800-pound gorilla demanding that you adopt radio frequency iden-
tification, or RFID — a technology you may have never even heard of until
just a few months ago. Chances are that gorilla wears a stylish blue smock
with a yellow smiley face on it and greets you with a “Welcome to Wal-Mart.”
If not Wal-Mart, the US Department of Defense, Target, Albertsons, Best Buy,
Tesco, Metro, the FDA or a number of other companies may be requiring you
to implement this technology by a certain deadline. If you don’t have a man-
dated deadline for adopting RFID, consider yourself lucky. You can discover
and make decisions about this exciting technology based on your normal
process for evaluating new business tools.
Whatever your situation is, you either want or need to set up an RFID network.
So you went out and picked up RFID For Dummies and are ready to go —
yippee!
About This Book
This is a book that is on a mission to take the confusion out of RFID. RFID 
is based on well-known laws of physics. It’s easy to understand how things
work after you get your arms around those basics. The better news is that
the technology works really well if you know what you’re doing. So without
sending you to MIT for a couple of years of RF engineering school, this book
explains everything you need to know to start setting up and deploying your
own RFID network — what more could you ask for? 
Who This Book Is For
Whether you are just curious, scared, worried, or simply mad at the prospect
of implementing yet another new technology — even if you know nothing
about RFID — RFID For Dummies is here to help. And, unlike a similar promise
by the IRS, this book really will help. You find out what RFID is, what it does,
and how it works. I guide you through the concepts and ideas in plain English,
walk you through the basics of RFID from a business perspective, and specu-
late on where this technology is headed (although I do, from time to time,

provide sufficient Geek Speak for the engineers and systems guys who, no
doubt reluctantly, bought this book in an attempt to actually understand the
mechanics of Radio Frequency Identification).
If you know the basics about running a laptop or PC and know what an IP
address is, you are armed with just about all you need to know to initially set
up an RFID network. If you have any background in physics and understand
some things from an electronics perspective, you’ve got a running start. I
assume that you come from a supply chain or warehouse background and
might not have a detailed IT background.
You Don’t Need a Slide Rule and Pocket
Protector to Use This Book
Other than the willingness to learn and basic knowledge, you need some equip-
ment to set up your RFID network and follow some of the processes outlined in
this book. At some point, plan to get
 A spectrum analyzer (discussed in Chapter 8)
 A budget to buy an RFID reader, antennas, tags, and a rack (about $7,500
total)
 An area large enough to begin testing and using the equipment (at least
20 feet x 20 feet)
 Another person to help you occasionally try out the technology
 A penchant for experimentation and thirst for knowledge
How This Book Is Organized
RFID For Dummies is broken into six different parts. If you are new to the
technology, it is helpful to read the parts in sequential order. If you have a
physics or RF background and you want to get into the nuts and bolts of the
technology, skip right to Part II and then move on to Part III. If you are trying
to justify the RFID project, you may want to go right to Part V, which addresses
some of the business concerns around strategic planning and ROI. You can
read all the technical chapters in Parts II and III by themselves and use them
for reference, as well as the last part, the Part of Tens. Here’s a quick rundown
of what you’ll find in each part.

RFID For Dummies 

Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID,
Here’s the Rest of the Story
This part introduces the basics of RFID. In Chapter 1, you find an overview of
the technology, what advantages are driving the mandates, and a blueprint
for implementing RFID, which I call the four Ps. In Chapter 2, I explain how
RFID fits into the world of Auto-ID technology and explain some of the basics
about the protocols that make it work. Chapter 3 helps you start assessing
the impact RFID will have on your business and helps you make some basic
decisions about how you’ll use RFID.
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic 
Wave: The Physics of RFID
In this part, I peel away the layers of RFID to uncover the underlying science
of RFID. This part gives you the physics knowledge you need in order to design
your network for optimal performance and make wise purchases. In Chapter
4, you can find an overview of how the physics of RFID systems work. Chap-
ter 5 digs a little deeper by delving it parts inside each of the key components
of a system. Whereas Chapters 4 and 5 focus on the invisible realm of electro-
magnetic waves, Chapter 6 is focused squarely in warehouse or marketplace,
covering common setups of RFID systems and case studies so that you can
learn from early adopters.
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application 
into Your World
This part is your key to designing an RFID network specifically for your envi-
ronment and needs. In Chapter 7, I walk you through the process of testing
for electromagnetic noise in your warehouse or building using a spectrum
analyzer. Chapter 8 helps you set up a lab (or find one you can use) so that
you test for the right tag (Chapter 9) and tag reader (Chapter 10). And last
but not least, Chapter 11 helps you wend your way through maze of middle-
ware (the software the connects the RFID network) by explaining what fea-
tures to look for and how to fit middleware into your network architecture.

Introduction

Part IV: Raising the Beams 
for Your Network
This part walks you through the process of actually implementing your care-
fully planned-out RFID network. Chapter 12 explains a few project management
tools that will keep your trial run and follow-up network designs on schedule.
Chapter 13 covers the process of setting up the hardware in the warehouse,
or other real-world setting (as opposed to a lab), and how to train your
employees to use the new system. And Chapter 14 explains now to set up
monitoring systems for both operators and system administrators, so that
your system keeps running strong, and thus helps your bottom line.
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter
Deploying an RFID system is a big project, and the bottom line needs to drive
your implementation. This part walks you through the key RFID-related busi-
ness decisions you need to make. In Chapter 15, I explain who in your organiza-
tion needs to be involved in these decisions and walk you through a nine-step
process for building and presenting a business case study. In Chapter 16, I
explain strategic benefits you need to include in the business case in more
detail, including how to calculate return on investment, or ROI, for all the
money you’re about to spend on RFID hardware and software. Chapter 17 is
your guide to outsourcing: I explain how you decide whether to outsource,
what to look for in an outsourcing partner, and how to seal the deal.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without a Part of Tens. The four chapters
in this part offer (more or less) ten equipment vendors to assess, ten of the
best RFID-related Web sites, ten tips from RFID experts who are part of that
rare fraternity that has actually done real-world deployments and lived to tell
about it, and ten standards and protocols for RFID that you may want to
investigate.
In the back of this book, you can also find a glossary of electrical, magnetic,
and scientific terms. So if, in your RFID reading, you come across terminology
that leaves you baffled, you can use this glossary as a handy resource.

you can normally skip over unless you have a closet desire to geek out on
radio frequency. But face it: If you’re reading about RFID, you’re probably a
technical-minded person. If this is the case, you’re more likely to skip to this
icon instead of skipping over it.
The Warning icon tells you to watch out! It marks important information that
may save you headaches, long talks with government officials, and maybe
even bodily injury.
The Case Study icon points out real-life examples of how RFID has been used
(and misused) in the marketplace.

the Rest of the Story

In this part . . .
P
art I gets you prowling down the path to RFID adop-
tion. In these three chapters, you become acquainted
with the basics of the technology and understand how it
compares to other automatic identification (Auto-ID) tech-
nologies. I explain why RFID has blossomed into the latest
and greatest technology since the electric toaster. You also
find out why so many people need to adopt this technology
in such a short period of time.
The last chapter of Part I shows you, in simple, easy-to-
understand terms, how to compare the different RFID 
networking and technology systems. This serves as a
primer for more detailed discussions later in the book.

Chapter 1
Taking the Mystery out of RFID
In This Chapter
 Discovering RFID
 Getting a handle on the technology
 Figuring out what you need to know
 Knowing what to expect in the future
W
ith all the recent hype over radio frequency identification (RFID) and
the requirements to implement it, you might think that RFID can turn
water into wine, transform lead into gold, and cure the world’s diseases. You
might also be worried that RFID will enable Big Brother to track your move-
ments to within a foot of your location from a satellite five hundred miles up
in space. The truth is, RFID can do none of these things.
In this chapter, you find out the basics of what RFID is, what forces are dri-
ving RFID as a replacement for the bar code in the marketplace, and what
benefits RFID can offer.
If you are responsible for complying with high-profile mandates from one of
your suppliers or customers, this chapter also offers a framework to help you
begin setting up a system and making it work within your existing business
process. The bad news is that an RFID implementation is a daunting project
even at a minimal compliance level, sometimes referred to as slap and ship or,
more appropriately, tag and ship. The good news is that the benefits to the
business are substantial, particularly if your trading partners are involved.
RFID technology is here to stay, so the sooner you understand it, the quicker
you can make key strategic decisions for your company.
What Is RFID?
RFID is a very valuable business and technology tool. It holds the promise of
replacing existing identification technologies like the bar code. RFID offers
strategic advantages for businesses because it can track inventory in the
supply chain more efficiently, provide real-time in-transit visibility (ITV), and
monitor general enterprise assets. The more RFID is in the news, the more

creative people are about its potential applications. For example, I recently
heard from someone who wanted to use RFID to track fishing nets in the
North Sea.
The origins of RFID in inventory tracking
Wal-Mart has spent millions of dollars since the late 1990s researching the
efficacy of RFID systems to replace bar codes (which have been in use since
the days of The Brady Bunch and Gilligan’s Island — that’s the early 1970s, for
those of you with all your hair left).
In 1999, with the help of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT), a consortium of companies formed the Auto-ID Center — a center for
continued research into the nature and use of radio frequency identification.
The consortium had a new idea about how organizations could identify and
track their assets. The vision underlying automatic identification (or Auto-ID)
is the creation of an “Internet of Objects.” In such a highly connected network,
devices dispersed through an enterprise can talk to each other — providing
real-time information about the location, contents, destination, and ambient
conditions of assets. This communication allows much-sought-after machine-
to-machine communication and decision-making, rendering humans unneces-
sary and mistakes a thing of the past.
Today, Auto-ID can track not only enterprise assets, but also the movement of
products, containers, vehicles, and other assets across vast geographic areas.
For more about the Auto-ID Center and the current organizations involved in
developing RFID technology, see Chapter 2.
Tracking goods with EPC codes
RFID is actually nothing new. Just as goods today have bar codes, goods in RFID
systems have codes that enable systems to share information. Because the
mandated RFID systems require businesses to share information with each
other, the different systems need to use the same code — the electronic prod-
uct code (EPC). The EPC is the individual number associated with an RFID tag
or chip.
The EPC was developed at MIT’s Auto-ID Center in 2000 and is a modern-day
replacement for the Universal Product Code (UPC). A tag’s embedded EPC
number is unique to that tag. However, the EPC protocol is universal to all
EPC-compliant systems and serves two specific functions:
 Telling how data is to be segregated and stored on the tag, or what is
also known as the numbering scheme.
 Determining how the tags and readers communicate (also called the air
interface protocol).
10
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

Wal-Mart, like other large retailers, had more pragmatic issues at hand when
they established an RFID requirement for their suppliers. Under Wal-Mart’s
mandate, each supplier is required to identify their products not by bar
codes and waybills, but through EPCs that are automatically broadcast by
RFID tags as new products arrive at the retailer’s warehouse, distribution
center, or store. In Chapter 2, I explain how EPC works in more detail.
Sizing Up the Benefits of RFID
Capturing inventory as it arrives from the supplier is the first step in a 
company-wide tracking system that “knows” where every item is through-
out its lifetime in the store. This tracking offers retailers tremendous insight
into their inventory, which enables those retailers to control costs and reduce
investment on inventory, which means lower prices and better competition
for consumers.
Having better information about inventory offers retailers all sorts of potential
benefits. The retailers know how much inventory is still on pallets in the ware-
house, how much is on its way to distribution centers and stores, and how
much is currently on the shelves in each of its stores. With this knowledge,
retailers have the foundation for measuring product consumption, seeing
buying patterns, and controlling inventory more efficiently. Through this
process, a retailer ensures that its shelves are stocked and that customers
can buy high-volume products (such as razor blades, diapers, and toilet
paper) when they need them and in the quantity they need.
Of course, businesses don’t spend money unless they expect to make
money off that investment. Major retailers believe that a comprehensive
RFID program — tying suppliers to inventories to retail outlet shelf stock —
will generate savings of around 10 to 16 percent, based simply on inventory
cost reduction in each of their distribution centers (DCs). This translates
into billions of dollars in savings each year — a pretty impressive result by
any measure. The benefits can extend to other applications beyond retailers:
Third-party logistics companies can speed up their billing cycle and create
a new revenue stream with RFID; government agencies can reduce loss and
increase security; museums can reduce cost to conduct inventory; sports
teams can increase sales at games — the applications are limitless.
In an RFID system that uses an electronic product code (EPC) or similar num-
bering scheme, the following RFID attributes lead to those kinds of savings:
 Serialized data: Every object in the supply chain has a unique identify-
ing number.
 Reduced human intervention: RFID allows tracking automatically with-
out needing people to count or capture data or scan bar codes, which
means reduced labor costs and fewer errors.
11
Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

 Higher throughput supply chains: RFID allows many items to be
counted simultaneously.
 Real-time information flow: As soon as an item changes state (off the
shelf, out of a truck, sold to customer), the information can be updated
across the supply chain.
 Increased item security: Tagging items allows them to be tracked inside
a confined facility or space.
In the following sections, I explain each of these benefits in more detail. In
Chapter 2, I compare RFID to other auto-identification technologies, like the
bar code, and offer tips for developing an overall Auto-ID strategy so that you
see how you might apply RFID’s benefits to your own business.
Obviously, there is a genuine reason for the excitement surrounding RFID and
the EPC. People are anxious to implement the technology so they can track
supplies from the factory to the foxhole, or from the grower to the grocer.
Much like the excitement surrounding the Internet, RFID carries the promise
of a very disruptive technology with substantial future rewards. The excite-
ment (dare I say hype?) needs to be tempered by the real-world limitations of
the technology and the laws of physics. Adding to the practical limitations
of today’s RFID technology is a deluge of misinformation and broken promises.
Today’s marketplace dynamic is the cause of much of this RFID heartache. I
introduce a well-balanced approach to RFID in “Finding Success with Four Ps
in a Pod,” later in this chapter, to make sure that you stay on an even keel and
take a pragmatic, process-driven approach to the technology.
Tracking individual items
with serialized data
Serialized data means that each item has its own unique identifier or serial
number. This helps an enterprise
 Keep very accurate account of each item in the supply chain or prop-
erty list. Instead of knowing that there are 1,000 boxes of Cap’n Crunch
(get it? serialized data) in the back room, a grocer knows which box has
been sold and which one has been sitting there for a long time.
 Know which item was produced where, in companies that produce
the same item at multiple plants. This is critical for tracking total qual-
ity, aiding in recalls, verifying warranties, and so on.
 Prevent counterfeiting and diversion. Serialized data allows items such
as high-cost drugs to travel through a supply chain while recording
every stop they make.
12
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

The benefit of serialized data is better inventory control, reduced loss, reduced
carrying cost, and improved customer satisfaction (customers at every level,
not just walk-in-off-the-street Joe Brown). Each of these advantages over the
existing system has a benefit of reducing cost and improving productivity
(another way of saying the same thing!).
RFID tracks individual items by associating the unique EPC number to a secure
database. This concept is often likened to license plates. Just like the DMV
knows who owns a car by looking up the license plate number on a central
server, an RFID system can pull up a limitless amount of information about a
tag based on its unique identifier. 
In some instances, particularly with active tags, the RFID tag allows all the
critical information to be stored directly to the tag. No need to look to a
database — all the info is right on the tag. This technology can be very useful
in instances such as the shipment of military supplies to overseas theaters,
where accessing a central database is nearly impossible.
Reducing human intervention
Thousands of applications require humans to scan an object with a bar code
scanner or read information on a label. When you check out at the supermar-
ket, the checker has to pass each item in your cart over the lasers that scan
the bar codes. RFID technology has the potential to eliminate this human
intervention. If all your groceries had RFID tags, you could walk straight out
the door and have all the items in your basket read automatically as you
passed by a portal, with no need to take things out and scan them. 
Think about cases of items coming off of a tractor trailer into a distribution
center. Today, someone scans each box one at a time with a bar code scanner
and often sticks a label on the box as it leaves the truck. From a logistics
perspective, RFID can automatically verify a shipment, optimize cross-docking
and flow of goods, and automate much of the pick-and-stow functions. With
RFID, things can move off the truck by the pallet-load. Hundreds of items
can be read simultaneously, and the data can immediately hit the inventory
system as being on-site, identifying what it is, where it came from, where it’s
going, and so on.
The benefit of having fewer human hands involved is reduced errors, which
produces reduced costs, faster throughput, and reduced damage and returns.
The overall implication of reduced human intervention, given the high cost of
salaries, benefits, and the cost of management associated with crews of
human workers, is a dramatic reduction in operating costs.
Automated toll systems are a prime example of how the lack of human inter-
vention saves both time and money. Remember how long the lines at highway
tollbooths used to be? This was especially annoying if your daily commute
13
Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

was on a toll road. With automated toll systems (made possible by RFID), no
longer does a car have to stop to hand cash to an exhaust-inhaling person
stuffed in a 2-x-3-foot box all day. Zoom by and smile. Less traffic, lower cost,
elimination of a hazardous job. Thank you RFID!
Moving more goods through
the supply chain
Supply chains that can move more goods (also called higher throughput supply
chains) reduce processing time, which leads to reduced costs, higher turn-
around for billing customers, improved cash flow, a better bottom line, and,
of course, reduced error rates, which also contribute to improved customer
service. This leads to better customer retention, higher sales, and an increase
in profitability and throughput performance.
Before RFID systems became a viable Auto-ID technology, systems with high-
volume throughput (airline luggage handling, package delivery, road race
participants) all had to be read one item at a time because a bar code scan-
ner can read only one bar code at a time. Whenever only one item is read at
a time (manually or with a bar code), the maximum throughput is — you
guessed it — one.
Entire systems were designed around processing one as quickly as possible.
Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, spent millions trying to figure out how to collect
one package at a time and read it in the shortest amount of time as it goes
down a very high-speed conveyor. That was the design goal of systems that
required optimization of a one-at-a-time bottleneck.
RFID changes all that by allowing a whole bundle of packages, a trailer of
luggage, or tens of runners to be read all at once, greatly increasing through-
put. With RFID, you can read hundreds of objects all nearly simultaneously.
No longer will systems be designed to optimize the speed of one; rather,
they will be designed using the laws of physics to maximize the number of
simultaneous reads.
Capturing information in real time
Real-time information can help you reduce costs, improve sales, increase cash
flow, allow for specialized servicing and manufacturing for top customers, and
thus capture a larger market share and improve overall capitalization per client
and per employee. Because you know, in real time, where everything is, you
can deliver on promises, reduce errors, increase customer loyalty, reduce
waste, optimize materials use, and directly impact the tactical (departmental)
and strategic (corporate and division-level) bottom line.
14
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

If time is money, information is insurance. What is on a store shelf, off the
shelves, selling well, about to spoil, running low in back, and missing is all
critical information to a retailer, producer, or supplier.
An RFID system can also allow machine-to-machine communication and
automated decision-making. Automated decision-making is based on two
principles of RFID: lack of human intervention and real-time information
flows. In real time, a conveyor can close a gate and route a package at 600
feet per minute from one line to another line all because it reads the data off
an RFID tag and retrieves a command specific to that individual item (it’s that
serialized data benefit again).
Increasing security
RFID’s increased security means improved delivery and control and increased
anti-counterfeit measures, as well as theft reduction, which leads to a signifi-
cant reduction in costs.
If you are responsible for the tracking and accounting of property items, or if
shrinkage to you is more than what happens when you jump into that frigid
Cape Cod Bay, RFID is a dream come true. (Shrinkage in an inventory sense is
the loss or theft of items in the supply chain.) The ability to permanently affix
a tag to every item of value in a location and know exactly where that item
is at all times as it passes through various doorways is something no other
technology can offer. From a security perspective, RFID’s ability to track and
trace property can help everything from the war on terrorism to anti-fraud
and anti-counterfeit measures. Here are some examples:
 The pharmaceutical industry not only deals with fake drugs being passed
off as the real deal, but is fighting a multibillion-dollar issue of diversion.
Drugs have different price scales for different buyers. Distributors know
who pays less for drugs — like hospitals and nursing homes — and some
less-than-upstanding distributors take advantage of these price differ-
ences to illegally turn a profit. See Chapter 6 for more details.
 Gray market items (items that are made in the same plants or with the
same markings as a real product but sold much cheaper on the black
market) are another problem easily solved with RFID: Embed a chip in
every Fendi bag and you’ll be able to tell the fake ones sold on the street
from the real ones sold at Neiman Marcus without waiting for the faux
leather to fade.
 The federal government just wishes they had tagged the assets at Los
Alamos and other sensitive facilities. You can track assets with RFID by,
for example, triggering an alarm to sound and a camera to take a picture
when tagged assets pass through a doorway. RFID allows all these things
and more to happen automatically.

Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

Mandates, Womendates, Blind Dates —
Forcing Efficiency
In June of 2003, when Linda Dillman, Chief Information Officer (CIO) for 
Wal-Mart, announced to the world that Wal-Mart would require all suppliers
to put RFID tags on every case and pallet that entered a Wal-Mart distribution
center or store, the technology world as we knew it changed forever. This
was the first of several high-profile mandates that rocked the retail and tech-
nology world and catapulted a new industry to be coined “the next big thing.”
What are the major mandates?
This section gives you a rundown of the major mandates that are driving
RFID implementation.
Wal-Mart
The Wal-Mart mandate detailed a plan for its top 100 suppliers to ship certain
RFID-tagged items to distribution centers and stores in and around Sanger,
Texas, by January 2005. Wal-Mart encouraged and engaged many other suppli-
ers to participate — 137 in all. From that portentous announcement in June
2003, the press, the privacy advocates, and the competition began to emerge.
The analysts quickly began to claim that RFID will be much bigger than Y2K
and that Wal-Mart will become Big Brother and track everything everywhere.
Sensationalism in the press took every angle from market size to predictions
of failure. But no matter what angle they took, it was clear that the first stone
was cast.
The U.S. Department of Defense
In the late summer of 2003, rumors of high-level U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) personnel making regular trips to Bentonville, Arkansas, began circulat-
ing in the RFID community. Rumors turned to rumblings when the DoD’s Office
of Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) began meetings with the various
branches looking for information about existing RFID programs, the use of con-
tact memory buttons, and where bar codes might be replaced and optimized
by passive RFID tags. Although DoD was also an early member of the Auto-ID
Center, the DoD was clearly going to use Wal-Mart’s research and development
efforts and early momentum to bring its own mandate to the world.
The DoD has always been a technology innovator through such groups as
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and others, but the
technology impact has been mostly within its own secluded world. Demand-
ing an RFID mandate of their 40,000 suppliers seemed like an unprecedented
16
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

move — a move which had the potential to dwarf the impact of Wal-Mart’s
announcement in the technology and supplier world and guarantee the future
of a fledgling RFID industry.
That announcement came in October of 2003, when Michael Wynne, Acting
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, released
a policy paper spelling out a passive RFID program for all 40,000 DoD suppliers.
When details were finally released in July of 2004, the policy turned out to be
a near carbon copy of Wal-Mart’s mandate. Cases and pallets going into two
DoD distribution facilities — Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, and San Joaquin,
California — are required to have passive UHF RFID tags with an EPC number
or specific military number embedded on the tag.
Target
At about the same time the DoD announcement came out, another one of the
most successful retailers in the United States, Target Corporation, announced
its plans to keep up with Wal-Mart and require its suppliers to adopt RFID as
well. Details of Target’s mandate came out in August 2004, when the company
called many of its suppliers to a meeting in the Minneapolis headquarters. The
company took an intelligent approach to dealing with suppliers by making its
mandate specific to a distribution center in Tyler, Texas. Target was also look-
ing for suppliers that were already underway with Wal-Mart to participate in
its early pilot, scheduled for a handful of suppliers in January 2005. The top
suppliers to Target have until June 2005 to become compliant, allowing Target
to stay a close follower to Wal-Mart, while learning from many of Wal-Mart’s
early mistakes.
Other mandates
Other mandates came along from the grocery store chain Albertsons,
European companies Metro AG and Tesco, and (in a significant validation
for the consumer products world) electronics superstore Best Buy. With
many common suppliers in every industry deploying RFID, it is only a matter
of time before other industry powerhouses like Home Depot, Lowes, Staples,
and others follow suit.
Responding to the mandates
Mandates are similar to blind dates for many suppliers: The retailers say
that RFID could be the perfect match, and that they’re committed to seeing it
through, but most of the suppliers haven’t a clue what the outcome will be.
As I write this book, suppliers have shown a range of responses:
 Love at first site: Some suppliers are already planning to adopt RFID
deeply into their enterprise. Many industry pioneers have taken this
approach. Gillette, Kimberly Clark, Procter & Gamble, Orco Construction
17
Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

Supply, GTSI, and others have moved aggressively to gain a competitive
advantage by incorporating RFID fully into their systems. These are the
folks who are going to get an early — and potentially insurmountable —
strategic advantage from the technology, in much the same way as FedEx
crushed the U.S. Postal Service in overnight delivery by incorporating
supply-chain optimization and technology into a delivery service. The
Postal Service has never recovered. The companies investing heavily and
working through the learning curve quickly have the potential to leave
their competitors in the dust.
 The cautious approach: These suppliers are doing the minimal amount
to get by until they discover more about the technology. This is a risk-
aversion approach that doesn’t lead to a big strategic advantage, but it
also enables these companies to learn about the technology a bite at a
time and not make any big mistakes in implementation — lower risk and
lower reward.
 The naysayers: A small percentage of suppliers are doing nothing and will
accept whatever penalties companies like Wal-Mart assess to noncompli-
ant suppliers. These are the folks who, if they are in a competitive indus-
try, are most at risk. Remember Eastern Airlines, and Digital Equipment
Company? All once-successful companies that died because they failed
to innovate. RFID represents a classic case of innovation advantage for
early adopters and margin-eroding competitive pressure for naysayers.
Many folks may see a mandate as a powerful customer forcing new technology
on a powerless client, and in some cases that is certainly the truth. The DoD,
however, is a notable exception. According to analysts within the DoD’s AIT
group, the average payment cycle for a DoD supplier is 45 days from DoD
receiving a shipment to a check being sent out to the supplier. With RFID-
enabled shipments, DoD is committed to getting the payment down to 72
hours. The $60,000 question is when that efficiency will be in the system. My
guess is that payment cycles will approach less than a week within four years.

gorillas in blue, monogrammed, smiley-face-adorned smocks are insisting
that you need to use a technology you hadn’t even heard of a year ago. The
bottom line is that you’re going to need help. You need a physicist.
Finding a physics expert
The marketplace dynamics of RFID are starkly different from the Internet, the
word processor, the telephone, and other disruptive technologies of recent
memory. In most other instances, invention, understanding, experimentation,
and eventually adoption flowed naturally. Not so with RFID. Tens of thousands
of enterprises are being forced to go from oblivion to adoption. This acceler-
ated implementation creates a tremendous opportunity for the handful of folks
out there who understand and can work with radio frequency technology.
However, much like the carpetbagging that went on after the Civil War, it has
opened the door for opportunists to try for a quick buck. And without many
RFID experts in the world, you need the ability to distinguish the true experts
from those who claim to be.
When you look for an expert to help with an RFID deployment, you can easily
vet out the technology charlatans by having a little bit of knowledge and
knowing the right questions to ask.
Because you’re smarter than the average bear and bought RFID For Dummies,
you’ll at least know what you’re in for and will eventually be able to choose
a partner who can provide you accurate information and accurate help.
Alternatively, brave warrior of RFID, I arm you with enough information to
take on this mighty task yourself. Either way, to get you started, you need
to understand something about the physics yourself.
The basic physics of RFID
In essence, an RFID system is just a reader and a tag communicating over the
air at a certain frequency, like any other radio communication. The readers,
antennas, tags, and frequency make up the basics of an RFID system, and the
following sections give you an overview of how they work. Understanding
some of the nuances behind the system as your company wades into the
choppy waters of RFID can be the difference between making a multimillion-
dollar mistake and being the CEO’s new golfing buddy.
RFID readers
An RFID reader is really a radio, just like the one you have in your car, except
that an RFID reader picks up analog signals, not hip-hop. The reader produces
electricity that runs down a cable at a particular rate. That electricity eventu-
ally hits a piece of metal on the antenna, which radiates the same signal rate
out in space at a certain frequency and wavelength.
19
Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

The reader not only generates the signal that goes out through the antenna
into space, but also listens for a response from the tag. The RFID reader is like
a high-tech Morse code machine, but instead of the dots and dashes the Lone
Ranger might have listened in on, the RFID reader transmits and receives
analog waves and then turns them into a string of zeros and ones, bits of digi-
tal information.
Each reader is connected to one or more antennas. The three components, the
reader, and the antenna are shown in Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2. Figure 1-1 shows
an Alien reader with Alien Class 1 tags (more on tag classes in Chapter 2) and
Figure 1-2 shows a Matrics/Symbol reader with antenna and Class 0 tags. To
put their size in perspective, the grid is made up of 12-x-12-inch squares. The
antennas are a science all their own (see Chapters 4 and 5 for more details),
but the important thing to know is that the reader creates the electromag-
netic signal and the antenna broadcasts it into a specific interrogation zone.
The interrogation zone is a radio frequency field that can be thought of as a
giant bubble coming off of the antenna.
The tag
If the reader transmits a signal out into space (and space can be the distance
from one side of a dock door to the other), what is out there transmitting
back? The answer of course is the tag.
An RFID tag is made up of two basic parts: the chip, or integrated circuit, and
the antenna. The chip is a tiny computer that stores a series of numbers unique
to that chip. The chip also has the logic to tell itself what to do when it is in front
of a reader. The antenna enables the chip to receive power and communicate,
enabling the RFID tag to exchange data with the reader.
Some tags are active tags because a battery powers their communication. Most
of the tags produced today are passive tags. This means that the only time they
communicate is when they are in the close presence of a reader. Being in the
presence of a reader means that they are sitting in an electromagnetic field.
When a passive tag enters an electric or magnetic field, the tag draws enough
energy from that field to power itself and broadcast its information.
The type of communication that allows this exchange to happen is called
backscatter. The reader sends out an electromagnetic wave at one specific fre-
quency. That wave hits the RFID tag, and the tag then “scatters back” a wave at
a different frequency with the chip’s information encoded in those backscatter
waves. I explain how tags work with readers in more detail in Chapter 5.
Frequency
Both the tags and the readers operate over a specific frequency. Think of
them as what they really are: radios that have their own very specific sta-
tions on which they can talk and listen. So in a way, the tags are tuned into
the readers, just as your car radio is tuned into that hip-hop station.

Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

The majority of RFID being used in the supply chain world uses the ultrahigh-
frequency band, or UHF. In the United States, this is referred to as the 915
megahertz (MHz) band. Although it is actually the 902–928 MHz range, 915
just happens to be the center. In Europe and Asia, this range is slightly differ-
ent. Some applications, such as pharmaceuticals and asset tracking, use high
frequency, or HF, which is at 13.56 MHz. Chapter 3 explains frequencies in
more detail.
Finding Success with Four Ps in a Pod
I can enlighten you on all you need to know for an RFID deployment with the
Four Ps. By the Four Ps, I don’t mean that intoxicating Irish pub in
Washington, D.C. I mean the four principal stages of an RFID deployment:
Planning, Physics, Pilot, and Production.
The Four Ps encompass the key stages of an RFID network deployment.
Figure 1-3 shows how they tie together in an evolutionary process of assess-
ment, deployment, and scalability. The following sections explain the impor-
tance of each P in more detail.
Planning
Planning is the most important step in any complex undertaking. An RFID
system is no different than a military operation; only the stakes are different.
If you’re playing the role of Captain RFID in your organization, the best thing
you can do is plan properly.
22
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 
When will tag cost please the boss?
As I write this book, tags cost anywhere from
$.22 to $1.20 each for passive tags, depending
on volume, manufacturer, and special design
functions for hard-to-tag items like metal or
liquid products. Many people in the consumer
packaged goods (CPG) industry have said that
the “magic price” for tags is under $.05 each.
Many highly innovative companies are address-
ing this cost problem by pioneering production
systems, experimenting with low-cost adhesives,
and using conductive ink for antennas. Given the
volume of potential applications (12 billion items
in the pharmaceutical industry alone) and accel-
erating innovation, I advise clients who will buy
in significant volumes that they should plan for a
$.05–.075 tag by the end of 2007. Look for some
large Asian manufacturers to bring tags to
market in 2005 and 2006, adding to the increase
in competition and fueling price pressure for that
cheaper tag.

The Planning stage ideally takes place over several months to make sure your
organization has considered all the potential areas of impact, had time to get
up to speed on the technology, and appropriately budgeted for the future. If
you are being forced to comply by the government or a by large retailer, you
do not have that luxury. If you do not have the time to do a full-blown plan-
ning session, use the following guidelines as must-haves for moving forward
successfully. If you do have the time, use Chapters 3 and 16 as the foundation
for your long-term planning cycle.
The critical planning steps for your RFID deployment are
1. Create a global RFID policy.
Creating the global RFID policy requires a lot of research so that you
understand all the available options in technology, business processes,
and costs. This policy step addresses how to roll out the plan throughout
your organization, what frequencies to use, data synchronization meth-
ods, and so on. If you are under a mandate, you might have many of these
issues decided for you by someone else. Essentially, your global RFID
policy will set the basis for how you need to move forward and help
everyone in your organization understand what is about to happen
with RFID.
Spend as much time as necessary in setting the RFID policy. If you don’t
nail down your RFID policy well, you won’t be overly successful with the
steps that follow. Remember what Roger Staubach, a former Navy mid-
shipman, once said: “Spectacular achievements are always preceded by
unspectacular preparation.”
2. Execute an application analysis.
An application analysis covers the rationale and reasons for the RFID
deployment and how RFID will be used. This includes very specific
understanding of how RFID fits within your business processes. See
Chapter 3 for more about assessing business processes.

3. Develop a cost/benefit breakdown.
You need to examine the tangible and intangible ROI (return on invest-
ment). Chapter 17 gives a quick and dirty example of how to do that.
4. Develop an implementation model (timeline).
With a new war chest of knowledge, you need to put together a project
timeline (working back from any mandates you might be under) and
investigate RFID vendors and consultants.
Keep in mind that most RFID hardware vendors are not ramped up for
high-volume production. This means order lead times can be anywhere
from three to six weeks. Many people fail to consider this and end up
being delayed several weeks. Make sure you incorporate equipment order
timing into project planning timelines to stay on schedule. Chapter 12
offers more details on project planning.
5. Design a deployment plan.
Basically, this step involves going through each step in the implementa-
tion model and assigning roles and responsibilities, seeing what parts are
dependent on successful completion of other parts, and understanding
the scope of the entire project. Having a timeline and some outside exper-
tise on board will help you move toward a comprehensive, straightfor-
ward pilot that will serve as the foundation for a widely-deployed RFID
network. See Chapter 17 for details on how the RFID plan fits in with your
strategic plan.
6. Manage the change and potential impact on the enterprise.
Finally, as with all good projects and consistent with the popular tenets of
Six Sigma management principles, you need to audit the result by seeing
how your deployment of the technology compared with what was being
used before (usually bar codes) and ensure the survivability of the change
by making sure the organization has mechanisms to prevent workers from
avoiding or faking the use of the technology. 
Physics
The second P is the Physics component. Certain laws of physics — no matter
whom you know in the RF Police — just can’t be bypassed. Those laws of
physics are important because they affect the products you tag and the facili-
ties where you set up readers. The three areas in which physics most come
into play are
 Full Faraday Cycle Analysis to understand the environment: The Full
Faraday Cycle Analysis, named after the famous physicist of the 1800s,
Michael Faraday, is made up of two primary components. First is a 
24
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

time-based analysis of ambient electromagnetic noise (AEN), and second
is RF path loss contour mapping (PLCM). You can find out how to exe-
cute both of these functions in Chapter 7. The goal is to see all the
invisible electronic, magnetic, and radio waves that flow throughout
a location and then properly design an RFID network to live within
that environment.
 Product or SKU testing for tag selection and placement: This step
involves properly testing your products for an RF signature. Many
people refer to this as SKU testing for RFID compatibility. In a vacuum,
the reader and its antenna combine to make a perfectly shaped RF field.
Put an object, like a case of SPAM, in the middle of that field and that
perfectly shaped RF field becomes distorted beyond recognition. Why?
Because RF waves, like light waves, can be reflected and absorbed.
Metal reflects RF waves, and liquids absorb them. Knowing this, you
can imagine how an RF calamity might ensue in an interrogation zone
if you try to tag a case of SPAM, a highly liquid foodstuff in a metallic
can. To avoid this calamity, see Chapter 8, which goes over a sound
scientific methodology to find the right tag and placement for your
products.
 Selection of the RFID hardware based on scientific testing: Buying an
“RFID in a box” or a “slap and ship portal” is a big mistake. Although
these solutions look attractive on the surface, they can turn into a
maintenance and support nightmare, and often end up being completely
written off as organizations move to a full RFID network. The physics
and planning should be done with the end in mind — where do you
expect or want your RFID network to be in three to five years? If you
are planning for ten dock doors, design for that and source a solution
now that is optimal for the long term, even if you’re setting up only one
dock door today.
To design with the end in mind, you need to do scientific testing. After
you understand how your products behave in an RF field and what the
specific requirements of your environment are, you can set up a lab to
help you discover what the best readers and antennas are. Colvin Ryan,
the world-famous steeplechase jockey, is famous for saying, “No matter
what place the horse is in over the first two fences, the only thing that
matters in the end is who gets the girl.” That is a prime example of work-
ing with the end in mind.
I remember one client whose software vendor sold them a print-and-apply
solution and readers before any of the physics testing was done. The client
then discovered that the tags read 10–15 percent of the time at most and that
the readers didn’t have the communication capabilities to fit well into the
existing infrastructure. Then they went through the proper testing and hard-
ware selection and are now at a 100-percent read rate. But they’re left with
several thousand dollars’ worth of high-tech paperweights.

Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

Pilot
If you’ve been following the RFID buzz for the past year or two, you might
think you were on the set of the movie Top Gun with the number of times
you’ve heard the word pilot bantered about. The truth is, there is so much to
learn about RFID that companies are trying to get away with as little initial
impact as possible. Many are limiting the commotion by starting out with a
one- or two-location pilot, or a trial system.
The bad news is that pilot costs can range from $50,000 to $1,000,000 depend-
ing on the scope and requirements. The good news is that, when done cor-
rectly, a pilot program can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars as your
company moves toward full deployment. And you will eventually be deploying
an RFID network. Think of the pilot as an initial deposit in a high-yield 401(k) —
the earlier you start it, the more benefit you get out of it in the long run. (Sorry,
I know this isn’t Financial Planning For Dummies, but that recessive MBA gene
flexes its helix every now and again.)
In essence, the pilot provides a solid road map for production but has a more
limited scope. Following the Four Ps process, the Pilot stage becomes a prag-
matic step toward true understanding of RFID.
The pilot is about deploying and testing the RFID network in your environ-
ment. To get a better sense of what a pilot involves, see Table 1-1, which out-
lines the basic phases of an RFID pilot.

Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

Think of the pilot deployment as the first node in an overall system architec-
ture that may take years to develop completely. Pilots provide a road map for
production, but have more limited scope and a longer redesign process. After
the system is up and actually collecting data, you can expect several reitera-
tions of design and modifications to the process. That redesign process
allows you to expand the system as you’re ready; it also helps you under-
stand that the RFID network is a living thing, evolving as business processes
change and become optimized. As shown in Figure 1-3, the pilot logically
morphs into the Production phase and scaling up the network.
Production
The first three Ps might seem like a sprint to get yourself ready with this new
technology, but the last P, Production, is the methodical scaling up of a well-
designed system. It’s the steady pace of a marathoner who knows exactly
what his splits should be at every mile to get to the finish line.
The key difference between the pilot and the production systems is that the
network grows exponentially in complexity as readers are added and more
data is captured. As scary as this might sound, if the Planning and Pilot
stages were done with the end goal in mind, growth should come smoothly
and relatively painlessly. Scaling up an RFID network is similar to the pilot
process; you add nodes to a previously designed network and focus on small
design modifications to manage any unplanned events.
In addition, when you reach the Production phase, you’re ready to add the
following tasks into the mix of your RFID network:
 Managing the health and performance of the network: This is the most
complex challenge of production and involves making sure that the read-
ers are performing optimally and stay correctly configured. Detecting
anomalous behavior before it leads to catastrophic failure is the key.
Only a couple of options today address this need, and they are covered
in Chapter 14. One thing is very clear, however: Traditional network
management systems like Tivoli, Unicenter, and OpenView are poorly
suited for management and monitoring of a complex RFID network
because they can’t understand the multifaceted physics components
that are at the root of an RFID network’s performance.
 Integrating your RFID data into existing systems: This is the timeliest
issue. An RFID network will produce much more data in real time than
your current system (because items are serialized). This is very different
from what most core business applications are used to. Many are
designed to deal with bar code data coming in at regular intervals in
a batched mode. Fortunately, the major enterprise resource planning
(ERP), warehouse management (WMS), and inventory software vendors
are designing and building new additions to their existing applications
27
Chapter 1: Taking the Mystery out of RFID

specifically for RFID. This will ease the integration burden and help
enterprises leverage the intelligence gleaned from real-time serialized
data. Already, companies like SAP, Manugistics, Oracle, and others have
built RFID middleware and modules that their existing clients will be
able to benefit from. See Chapter 10 for more details.
 Testing your system with outside partners: Just like the force of an
army’s battalion is made up of many individual soldiers, the power
of RFID is unleashed when a multiplicity of single nodes are bonded
together sharing real-time, specific data. After you have data populating
your critical business applications and are confident your RFID network
and infrastructure are performing well, you can start to test with selected
suppliers and customers. The value of this information is stunning:
• For companies concerned with inventory management, incorporating
both upstream and downstream partners provides a level of in-
transit visibility that allows radical changes in your inventory
management process and, most importantly, reduces necessary
capital tied up in the inventory cycle.
• For companies focused on asset tracking and security, incorporating
the new RFID data with back-end applications allows chain-of-
custody or pedigree information and specific association with
people, plants, and distributors that has never been available.
 Educating the users: Training is critical to ensure front-line adoption and
proper usage of the systems. The complexity of performance and the
invisible nature of RF make for a unique combination for the worker in
the field. Warehouse and system staff need to understand what affects the
success of a reader network and how to recognize some of the basic
issues. Behaviors they may not think twice about today may need to be
modified. For instance, if a worker decides to unplug a reader to use the
outlet, he needs to know that the custom configuration on most of today’s
readers will be lost, and when that reader is plugged back in, that the con-
figuration is set back to the factory default. Or if a forklift is parked in a
reader’s interrogation zone, users need to know that the success of tag
reads is likely to be altered. Performance and business process issues
can be designed into the network to a certain extent with visible light or
sound queues, but many of the relevant issues will need to be addressed
with specific training. Chapters 14 and 15 discuss training for your pilot
and production deployments in more detail.
A Ride in the Time Machine
This book was written in 2004 and released in early 2005. So what will things
look like five or ten years from now? As I mentioned earlier, the $.05 tag will
be a reality, but more importantly, RFID technology and a global protocol will
28
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

enable a world we couldn’t even have imagined at the turn of this century. In
less than five years, we will witness a $25 RFID reader and all the technology
and digital signal processing on a single chip. RFID readers will come in two
flavors: (1) cheap, dumb readers that only read tags and send the data up to
a central collection point, which filters and smoothes the data for analysis;
and (2) more expensive, higher-processing, smart RFID readers that can per-
form intelligent operations beyond simple communication.
The cheap and small readers will enable a convergence of parallel technolo-
gies you may have already heard of:
 Mesh networks: Items that communicate and self-configure every time a
new node is recognized or removed.
 Grid computing: The ability to co-opt computing power like a utility
when an application needs more horsepower.
 Dust motes: Tiny sensor networks that can do everything from predict
disasters like tsunamis to recognize chemical warfare, and can be
deployed by dropping them from a plane by the thousands, like crop
dusters.
 Sensors: To monitor everything from temperature to vibration to
nuclear levels attached to this networked world.
Many people’s vision of an internet of smart objects will be realized as all of
these technologies unite in a manner that is pure machine-to-machine commu-
nication. An object embedded with an RFID tag or some derivative will enter
the presence of other objects that are similarly enabled and be instantly recog-
nized. Each object will have enough data to configure itself into the geographi-
cal network in which it resides. Information about everything from temperature
and movement to cost and ownership will be distributed in these complex
systems. Most importantly, it will all happen wirelessly, with a limited number
of data standards, such as the EPC protocol, ISO standards, and unlicensed
bandwidth.
This intelligent, wireless, machine-to-machine communication will grow at a
cost of strict regulatory compliance related to our privacy and freedom if we
let one seed germinate that has already been planted — ignorance. Without
clearly understanding the impact and application of disruptive technologies
like RFID, some people will have a knee-jerk reaction that our privacy is at
stake. In today’s world, and the world a decade from now, education and
understanding will be the best protection against overbearing federal regula-
tions and alarmist articles in popular press. See Chapter 2 for more about
privacy concerns.
George Jetson never had it as good as we will a decade from now: When you
wake up in the morning, your armoire will notify you of your perfect wardrobe
based not only on fashion coordination, but also on what’s on your calendar

for the day. Then you’ll get in your car and head back to sleep because it will
use sensors and GPS to drive you to the office. If a tire gets low on air, it
will route the car to the service station for a quick fix and get you back on
your way. If the interstate is backed up, your car will route you to a different
path and get you there on time. Then, when you stop at the store on the
way home, you’ll simply fill your cart up with items and walk out the front
door, and a sign will let you know that you’ve just purchased $38.76 worth
of Pop-Tarts, toothpaste, SPAM, and Cheez Whiz. When you get home,
your refrigerator will display a warning light that your arteries are going
to be blocked quicker than brushing your Newfoundland in the tub will
block your drain if you don’t change your diet. If it does get that far, we
may want Jane Jetson to stop this crazy thing called technology. But, need-
less to say, the future could be a very cool place that is wildly efficient, thanks
to RFID.

Auto-ID Technologies:
Why RFID Is King of the Hill
In This Chapter
 Investigating automatic identification technologies
 Comparing various numbering schemes for Auto-ID
 Understanding privacy and standards
T
he world of automatic identification technology (referred to as either AIT
or Auto-ID) has steadily grown over the past half-century into what it is
today — an indispensable part of our everyday life. The bar code has been
the sovereign monarch, the foundation and foothold for Auto-ID technologies,
for the past three decades. Look on the back of this book, on your computer,
under the hood of your Ferrari — and yes, even tattooed on the neck of that
kid down the street with all the piercings: Bar codes are everywhere. And if
you look closely enough, you might just notice a few gray lines in with the
usual black ones: The bar code has entered its thirties and is showing some
subtle signs of age.
Although RFID is the new heir apparent, it isn’t replacing every bar code or
other Auto-ID technology any time soon. Each Auto-ID technology has its
strengths and weaknesses. Even though the bar code is getting a little gray
around the temples (like me), it still has plenty of use to the industrial world —
hopefully, also like me.
As you look at deploying Auto-ID technologies in your enterprise, under-
standing what the key Auto-ID technologies (RFID, bar codes, and contact
memory buttons) can and can’t do is important. Knowing the strengths,
weaknesses, costs, and issues of each one will help you craft a strategy that
incorporates the best possible options. Having a good grasp of the standards
surrounding the newest of the technologies, RFID, will help you glance into
the future and plan for adoption time frames, interoperability issues, and
data synchronization problems.

Planning an Auto-ID Strategy
for the Times
In this section, I cover the key features of the bar code and other Auto-ID
technologies so that you can see how newer ones can take advantage of
developments in technology infrastructure.
The three principal types of Auto-ID technology that I cover are bar codes,
contact memory buttons, and radio frequency identification (RFID). All three
technologies have a viable place in the global marketplace today. The distinct
technology differences show why there are very specific applications for each
of the three. After you understand the key features of Auto-ID technologies
and how the different options stack up, you can begin to think of strategies for
using them in your business.
Whenever you compare different items of the same ilk — cars, ski goggles,
shoe polish, whatever — it helps to have a few criteria to work with. The
following list gives you some idea of the criteria to compare Auto-ID technolo-
gies, which can help you figure out which ones best fit your business needs:
 Modification of data: The ability to change the data on the tag or to
write data to the tag.
 Security of data: The ability to encrypt the data on the tag.
 Amount of data: The amount of useful data the tag can store.
 Costs: In addition to the obvious — how much each one costs — also
remember to consider the costs of ancillary equipment you need to
work with a technology.
 Standards: Whether there is a set open standard that many manufactur-
ers and users have adopted, or whether the technology is proprietary to
one manufacturer (remember VHS versus Betamax?).
 Life span: How long the tag remains readable. Some tags enable you to
read their data indefinitely, whereas others have a shelf life.
 Reading distance: Whether the tag requires line of sight to be read and
how far away can it pick up a signal.
 Number that can be read at a time: You read a bar code or contact
memory button only one at a time; other technologies enable you to
read multiple tags at a time. 
 Potential interference: What can keep the tag from properly being read.

Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

Comparing the major players in Auto-ID:
Bar codes, contact memory, and RFID
The granddaddy of the Auto-ID technologies is the bar code. In fact, the very
first item to be bar coded, a pack of Wrigley’s chewing gum, is now on display
at the Smithsonian Institution, reminding future generations of the pivotal
role the technology played. However, the bar code has limitations that don’t
take advantage of the technical infrastructure available today. The following
sections explain what the different technologies are and break down the
details of what bar codes have to offer compared with contact memory
buttons and, of course, RFID.
Bar codes
The problem with the bar code is that the maximum throughput in any bar
code system is one: that is, you can scan only one object at a time. In addition,
because a limited amount of data is stored in a small form factor, the bar code
doesn’t have enough room for a unique serial number, expiration date, or other
pertinent information. Lastly, the bar code reader has to be able to “see” the
bar code marking to read it. For example, if a bar coded item is wrapped, pack-
aged in a container, kept under a sheet or cover, or has somehow gotten dirty,
dusty, or marked, the bar code can’t be read.
Because of these limitations, most bar code innovations in the past few years
have focused on data-capture and data-transmission devices to make bar
codes more useful and to help them keep up with faster computing power
and better network connectivity. This section explains the different bar code
systems available — the old linear bar code, the stacked bar code, and
matrix symbols — and clarifies how they stack up.
Linear bar codes are the most widely used Auto-ID system. They can be found
on everything from cans of soda to rental cars. They are formed by printing a
series of alternating dark and light (usually white) bars of varying width. These
patterns have very specific meanings and representations. The other compo-
nent of an Auto-ID solution, the reader or scanner, is of course a key part of a
linear bar code system. Many types of scanners can read linear bar codes.
Fixed-location scanners can be used to read linear bar codes without signifi-
cant operator intervention if there is a method to ensure that the label faces
the scanner. In terms of the criteria discussed earlier, linear bar codes offer the
following:
 Modification of data: After a bar code is printed, it’s done. You can’t
change the orientation of the markings after the symbol has been
printed or etched.
 Security of data: Linear bar codes are widely adopted, and the stan-
dards are well known; however, they are not encrypted for security.
 Amount of data: Linear bar codes can have up to 30 characters of data.
34
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

 Costs: The cost can be a fraction of a penny or several cents if the bar
code is etched into an item.
 Standards: One of the shortcomings of bar code technology has been the
lack of a true universal protocol; the good news is that many of these stan-
dards are quite stable and are adopted by many end users. This is illus-
trated by the fact that over 200 types of bar code schemes (symbologies)
are in use today. Realistically, however, only four symbologies (UPC/EAN,
Interleaved 2-of-5, Code 39, and Code 128) are in common use, and all
are covered by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
standards.
 Life span: Life span is fairly low because they are usually printed.
However, if they are etched, they can last a very long time.
 Reading distance: Linear bar codes require line of sight to be read and
have a range of a few feet.
 Number that can be read at a time: Only one item can be scanned at a
time.
 Potential interference: Linear bar codes become unreadable when verti-
cal damage occurs. Such damage occurs when a black bar is completely
eliminated or altered or when a white bar is filled in. In the event of verti-
cal damage to the symbol, there is typically no possibility of recovering
the data. Only one bar code symbology (93i) contains erasure and error-
correction capabilities. The symbol also becomes unreadable if obscured
by dirt or other contaminants or when severely abraded. In addition to
the bar code being susceptible to dirt and dust, the readers also cease
to function if dirt, dust, or other foreign objects obstruct the lens.
Another type of bar code is the stacked bar code (also called a 2-D bar code).
From a technology perspective, a stacked bar code comprises multiple rows
of very short linear bar codes, arranged in a specific manner to ensure cor-
rect decoding. Although several stacked bar code symbologies are available,
only one is commonly used: PDF 417. The stacked bar code is very similar to
the linear bar code, with the exception of the following key differences:
 Security of data: Because they lack the vertical redundancy of linear
bar codes, stacked bar code symbologies employ a specification called
Reed-Solomon erasure and error correction, which allows part of the tag
to be destroyed while retaining all the original information. Data com-
paction schemes as well as encryption help to increase data capacity
and enhance data security. Because it is a line-of-sight technology that
carries more data than a simple linear bar code, additional security con-
cerns exist. For instance, a PDF bar code can be photocopied, scanned,
or faxed and subsequently read, making counterfeiting and theft very
simple — a continuing problem with the bar codes used on tickets for
sporting events.
35
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

 Amount of data: The stacked bar code is the only bar code on which a
significant amount of storage can be added right to the tag. Stacked bar
code symbols can contain more data than linear bar code symbols — up
to a full kilobyte.
 Cost: Stacked bar code symbols are less readily available from third-party
vendors, but despite a significant amount of competition, they still share
the ability to be printed or etched and therefore are very low-cost.
 Standards: PDF 417 is an ISO standard. PDF here stand for portable data
file (not the Adobe portable document format). This symbology addresses
many of the limitations of linear bar codes and has been the only genuine
innovation in tag design in recent years.
 Potential interference: Although they are more tolerant of localized
damage than linear bar codes, significant amounts of obscuring material
or abrasion can still render them unreadable in spite of their error-
correction capabilities
Matrix symbols are yet a third type of bar code. They’re composed of discrete
modules (typically round or square) arranged in a grid pattern. In the United
States, the most widely known examples of a matrix symbol are the codes
that the U.S. Postal Service prints on letters and postcards in order to sort
the mail. 
Matrix symbols share many characteristics with the linear bar code, but
they do have some unique traits that make they better suited for specific
applications:
 Security and amount of data: In these areas, matrix symbols have the
same capabilities as stacked bar code symbologies and are roughly
equivalent in data capacity and error correction.
 Costs: Matrix symbols can be read only with two-dimensional array
(charge-coupled device [CCD] or complementary metal oxide semi-
conductor [CMOS]) readers, which are more expensive than standard
bar code readers.
 Standards: A number of matrix symbologies are available, but only three
are in common use: Data Matrix, QR Code, and MaxiCode. Data Matrix
symbology is covered by an ISO standard. ISO approval of QR Code is
pending. Only United Parcel Service (UPS) uses MaxiCode. Aztec and
Mesa Code are two other less commonly used matrix symbologies that
are undergoing ISO standardization.
Matrix symbols for harsh environments are infrequently available from third-
party vendors, although there is support from some direct-part-marking
equipment vendors.
36
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

Matrix symbols are more tolerant of printing irregularities than width-based
symbologies such as linear and stacked bar codes. Additionally, direct marked
symbols have very low contrast between “marked” and “unmarked” areas.
Contact memory buttons
Contact memory buttons have also been around for nearly a generation. They
are a specific type of Auto-ID that requires a wand to make physical contact
with a button tag to read the data on the tag. Each button tag is about the size
of a quarter. Given the limited adoption of contact memory button technology,
comparatively little investment and innovation is occurring in this arena.
Because contact memory will never be a widespread Auto-ID solution, a key
concern surrounding this technology is that the three major contact memory
button solutions in use today are proprietary systems. If those solutions are
discontinued, finding a replacement may prove difficult. But as you can see
from some of the key attributes, contact memory does have some distinct
advantages.
 Modification of data: Contact memory buttons can be written to and
read many times. They are robust because they can withstand vibration
and harsh environments and still be read.
 Security of data: Contact memory buttons can have their data
encrypted.
 Amount of data: Data storage can be up to 8MB.
 Costs: Start at just over $1.
 Standards: There is no universally accepted standard; contact memory
buttons are proprietary technologies.
 Life span: The physical contact required for communication with the
reader limits the usable life of that reader.
 Reading distance: Because the tag reader has to come in physical con-
tact with the button tag, the reading distance is essentially zero.
 Number that can be read at a time: You can read these only one at a
time.
 Potential interference: The physical contact required also limits the
efficiency with which the contact memory button can be read.
RFID
An RFID solution uses a radio frequency (RF) signal to broadcast the data
captured and maintained in an RFID chip. An RFID system is composed of
three components: a programmable transponder or tag, a reader (with an
antenna), and a host. Figure 2-1 shows the basics of how an RFID system works.
37
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

Much of the criteria for RFID systems depend on the type of tag that you use.
Tags can be active, passive, or semi-passive. Here’s an overview of the differ-
ent types:
 An active tag has its own battery power to contact the reader. Power
from the battery is used to run the microchip’s circuitry and to broad-
cast a signal to a reader. An active tag’s onboard power source enables
the tag to broadcast a signal out at great range by either constantly bea-
coning a signal or broadcasting only when the reader talks first. Some of
the more powerful active tags can communicate up to 1 kilometer.
Active tags are much larger and therefore can carry a lot more memory
capability. Rather than simply having a unique serial number on the tag,
like a passive tag, active tags often carry information such as the full
contents of a container, its destination, and its origin. By carrying all the
information on the tag, you can retrieve information instantly. For exam-
ple, soldiers in battle usually can’t look up a file associated with a tag on
the Internet, so soldiers use hand-held units to scan containers with
active tags to find out what’s inside.
Despite their cost, active tags have proven a significant return on invest-
ment (ROI) for many applications. Since the early 1990s, the DoD has put
active tags, about the size of a cigarette carton, on containers to track
both their contents and their whereabouts. As of 2003, every container
that the DoD ships out of the United States has an active tag affixed to it.

can integrate with an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular
communication network, or satellite system to give exact whereabouts
and provide constant communication back to a tracking program. 
One of the reasons active tags have not grown to widescale adoption is
the lack of an open global standard, although the DoD has helped to
drive efforts toward creating interoperability with active tags. 
 A passive tag does not require a battery. Rather, a passive tag derives its
power from the electromagnetic field created by the signal from the RFID
reader to respond to the reader with its information. Because the man-
dates generally require passive tags, I devote more space to explaining
how they work in this book. See Chapter 5 for details on the physics of
passive tags, and Chapter 8 for more about testing for the right tags. 
 Semi-passive tags use a battery to run the chip’s circuitry but communi-
cate by drawing power from the reader’s radio waves (like a passive
tag). Because these tags have a battery, they’re larger and more expen-
sive than passive tags, but have greater communication ranges. Some
active tags can also be made to monitor sensor inputs, such as the tem-
perature or movement, even without being within an interrogation zone
to power up the tag. 
In addition, tags come in different classes and generations: Class 0, Class 1, and
Gen 1, Gen 2, and so on (which, for the purposes of comparing RFID against the
other Auto-ID technologies, determines whether you can modify the data).
Here’s how the different criteria break down:
 Modification of data: The ability to modify data depends on the stan-
dard that you use. Using the electronic product code standard (EPC),
the two classes are
• Class 0 tags: These are read-only, which means you have to use the
number that the manufacturer writes on the tags.
• Class 1 tags: These are read/write tags, which means you can pro-
gram whatever number you want on them (often called commis-
sioning the tag) at your place of business and then read them an
infinite number of times — write once, read many (WORM).
 Security of data: Depending on the class and generation of the RFID tag,
they have the ability to be encrypted so that others with standard RFID
readers cannot read the actual data on the tag. For more details about
the security of data in RFID systems, see the section, “To EPC or Not
to Be: Unraveling the Words, Words, Words of the Electronic Product
Code,” later in this chapter.
 Amount of data: Depending on the manufacturer, these tags can contain
64, 96, 128, 256, or 512 bits of information.
39
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

 Costs: Costs, which range in volume from 20–50 cents per tag, are falling
fast.
 Standards and regulations: RFID systems use many different frequencies.
International governing bodies — such as the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) in the United States and European Telecommunications
Standards Institute (ETSI) in Europe — regulate these frequencies.
Generally, the most common are low-frequency (LF, around 125 kHz), 
high-frequency (HF, 13.56 MHz), and ultrahigh frequency (UHF, 850–930
MHz). UHF RFID systems have been in commercial use only since the 
mid-1990s, and countries have not agreed on a single area of the UHF
spectrum for RFID. Europe centers around 868 MHz for UHF (and as
recently as November 2004, increased some of the available power and
spectrum), and the United States centers around 915 MHz. Radio waves
behave differently at different frequencies, so you have to choose the
right frequency for the right application. I discuss frequency in detail in
Chapter 3.
As far as standards go, the protocols that the tags and readers use to com-
municate can be described as the air interface protocol. The two primary
ones that you hear about are the EPC standard and the ISO standard. Both
EPC Class 0 and Class 1 tags and ISO 18000-6 tags operate in the 860–930
MHz range. A new standard called EPC Gen 2 is being developed that will
also work in the 900 MHz range but will be a worldwide standard for data
communication. I discuss these protocols in detail later in this chapter.
 Life span: Having no need for a battery makes the passive tag’s life virtu-
ally unlimited. Active tags and semi passive tags last as long as their bat-
teries. Refer to Table 2-1 for more details.
 Size: Passive tags range in size from Hitachi’s mu-chip (µ-chip; about 
the size of a pin head) to the size of a letter envelope. Active tags range
in size from the size of a piece of hard candy to about the size of a
carton of cigarettes. The larger the size, the fewer items the tag can
easily be affixed to. The smaller the size, the less the read distance.
 Reading distance: Passive tags communicate in ranges from a few mil-
limeters (called the near field) all the way out to tens of meters. Active
tags can communicate more than 100 meters. The big benefit, as I men-
tion earlier, is that you don’t have to see a tag to read it. Tags inside con-
tainers, behind walls, in briefcases, and so forth can still be read.
 Number that can be read at a time: A reader can read hundreds of tags
nearly simultaneously.
 Potential interference: Various materials such as metals and liquids can
interfere with passive tags. Active tags are less susceptible to interfer-
ence but still can have issues inside metal containers.
40
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

Two types of technologies use radio frequency as a broadcast mechanism:
radio frequency identification (RFID) and micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS). Unfortunately, the market and internal users sometimes confuse
these two technologies. In many cases, people use the term RFID to refer to
both technologies. It’s important to understand the two are different. See the
sidebar, “MEMS, the kissing cousin of RFID,” for details.
Crafting an Auto-ID strategy for 
your business (Or, why RFID
is the wave of the future)
The preceding section gives you an overall idea of what the different Auto-ID
technologies can and can’t do. Maybe you’ve already begun to see how your
Auto-ID strategy can evolve beyond the bar code. Regardless, this section
digs a little deeper, connecting the specs to real-world practices.
41
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill
MEMS, the kissing cousin of RFID
A MEMS device connects the physical world
with the electronic world. MEMS not only iden-
tify a component or product (like an RFID tag),
but also take measurements from or make
changes in the physical world. MEMS devices
come in several functional types:
 Sensors: Sensors detect a condition in the
physical world and convert it to an electri-
cal signal or data element (for example, a
tire with a MEMS device embedded can
report its pressure back to the car).
 Actuators: Actuators convert an electrical
signal into an action in the physical envi-
ronment, such as a garage door opener.
 Combination: Sensors and actuators can be
combined in devices such as thermostats.
MEMS devices typically use RF transmissions
to communicate information to other systems or
devices.
Remember: RFID is used to identify items with a
number and is therefore an open system. This
means that it requires access to other systems
to complete its function. MEMS devices, on the
other hand, take measurements of the physical
world and can do so in a closed-system func-
tion. In other words, MEMS can be entirely
independent of other systems, or they may carry
an identification number and thus become an
open system. (Note: At this point, MEMS identi-
fication numbers appear to be proprietary and
not based on open standards.)

Bar codes are cheaper and, in a few specific instances, perform better than
other forms of Auto-ID. This fact supports the logical conclusion that a com-
bination of bar code and RFID will become the optimal strategy for most
enterprises. Bar codes still have the competitive edge in the following cases:
 When you need to apply the ID directly to an asset, particularly when
you need to etch the ID directly in metal: Linear bar codes are widely
used by commercial, industrial, and governmental agencies to tag every-
thing from boots to data storage devices. Even weapons have been 
laser-etched with linear bar codes by the Department of Defense (DoD).
However, Matrix symbols, particularly Data Matrix, are better suited
than other bar code types for direct marking on items. Several current
applications in which Data Matrix codes have been permanently marked
on metal and plastic have been successful on the market.
 When you need to identify items out in the field: For example, the
development of bar code readers that attach to cellular phones enables
delivery personnel, repair technicians, and security staff to identify
items on location. Although active RFID tags offer the same capability
because they have onboard power, the active tags are large and expen-
sive to implement. The use of bar code scanners is more cost effective
in these cases, especially because identifying items (such as a package
you’re having shipped to your house) don’t require the increased data
storage space that active tags offer. The postal folks can get the job done
with a simple matrix bar code. Like many other things in the RFID indus-
try, however, this is evolving over time. Now there are companies offer-
ing portable RFID readers that even interoperate with mobile phones.
Nokia has one such solution that you can check out here: (www.nokia.
com/nokia/0,,55738,00.html)
Likewise, contact memory buttons have useful applications as well, such as
 Reading moving parts that create a lot of radio noise and vibration:
Because RFID relies on radio frequency, an RFID tag can’t transmit a
signal successfully through significant radio noise. (You can find out
more about noise in Chapter 7.) Contact memory buttons are not
affected by radio noise because the communication is via contact, which
make them an ideal workaround for these types of environments.
 Tracking volatile chemicals: A contact memory button is still the pre-
ferred type of Auto-ID for this purpose because it is less susceptible to
corrosion and failure in harsh environments.
With those cases out of the way, you can now focus on the interesting part —
how do you best harness the potential of RFID? The evolution of technology —
particularly applications such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software,
42
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

warehouse management systems (WMS), and assess management systems
(which can handle greater volumes of near-real-time data) — has highlighted
the shortcomings of the bar code. With RFID, however, you can take advantage
of advances in technological infrastructure, which opens up many possibilities
for businesses:
 Tracking high-value goods that need to be scanned over long ranges:
Active and semi-passive tags have the great benefits of not needing line
of sight, working at long distances, and reading many at a time with
great speed. That’s why RFID is so well suited for tracking many items
on high-speed conveyors, moving forklifts, railway cars on a track, or
with tens of other containers in a yard. Active and semi-passive tags
cost a dollar or more, however, making them too expensive to put on
low-cost items.
 Tracking many items that are fast-moving and not of great value in a
supply chain or asset management: Companies are implementing passive
UHF tags, which cost less than 25 cents today in volumes of 1 million tags
or more. Their read range isn’t as far as with active tags — typically less
than 20 feet, versus 100 feet or more for active tags — but they are far less
expensive than active tags and can be disposed of with the product pack-
aging. The ability to dispose of the tags is becoming an important issue
due to privacy concerns. This is why Wal-Mart, Target, the DoD, and many
others have required their suppliers to use this technology — so that they
can have a live, real-time view of their supply chains.
 Tracking data in real-time with serialized (each item has its own
serial number) data: It is clear that these applications can handle data
in near-real-time instead of the traditional batch mode. Batch mode
means that a large volume of data is sent all at once to be processed
overnight or on a weekend.
 Using machine-to-machine communication to make decisions and set
actions: RFID can be incorporated into sorting systems such that, if a
reader scans a particular case, it can send a signal to the conveyor to
sort that case to a specific area: The machines make the decisions, not
humans. It is also clear that to truly eliminate human error and to
increase speed, the communication needs to be between machines, not
from human to machine.
 Using serialized data: Because each RFID tag has its own unique serial
number — not just a product identifier like a bar code — significant
information can be gleaned about the supply chain if each item has its
own unique serial number that can be stored for an indefinite period
of time.
The bar code didn’t easily allow for any of these processes.

To EPC or Not to Be: Unraveling
the Words, Words, Words of the
Electronic Product Code
What the UPC is to bar codes, the EPC (electronic product code) is to RFID.
When an RFID reader scans a tag on a case of toothpaste, the tag sends an EPC
number to the inventory management system, letting it know exactly which
case of toothpaste it just saw, where it was, and at what time it saw it. If you are
one of the 60,000 companies under a mandate to implement RFID, you need to
do so by using the EPC protocol. Thus, understanding it helps you get your
arms around not just the technology of RFID, but also the standards of EPC.
44
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 
Birth of a revolution: The MIT Auto-ID Laboratory
Like many technology revolutions, the Auto-ID
development has come about primarily because
of the DoD. Since the early 1990s, the DoD has
been using active RFID to tag shipping contain-
ers moving throughout the DoD supply chain.
The private sector soon realized that the DoD’s
massive supply chain was a great proxy for any
commercial supply chain: they could use RFID
to track cases and items, rather than just ship-
ping containers, and make a huge impact on
their operations. 
However, the retailers needed to sort out major
shortcomings in price, size, and interoperability.
The people most interested in seeing RFID blos-
som — namely, large retailers and consumer
packaged good (CPG) manufacturers, along
with the DoD — funded MIT’s Auto-ID Center in
1999. The Auto-ID Center’s goal was to make
RFID a viable technology in the supply chain.
The MIT Auto-ID Center team was energized by
the leadership of Sanjay Sarma and David
Brock and was augmented by Kevin Ashton (an
executive on loan from Procter & Gamble). The
team needed some big foreheads to figure out
all the tough issues, so Sarma enticed one of his
former grad students, Daniel Engels, to finish his
Ph.D. at MIT and help solve issues that the
Auto-ID Center faced. The MIT team also
needed some world-class physics and RF
expertise; for that the team enlisted Dr. Peter
Cole from the University of Adelaide in Australia.
With this team in place, the Auto-ID Center set
about creating technology that was smaller,
cheaper, and solved the interoperability issues.
The Auto-ID Center eventually morphed into
a conglomerate of six universities: MIT, the
University of Cambridge, the University of
Adelaide, Keio University, Fudan University, and
the University of St. Gallen — each with its own
focus and unique capabilities but linked by the
common vision of an “Internet of things.” Their
collective goal was to “develop new technolo-
gies and applications for revolutionizing global
commerce and providing previously unrealiz-
able consumer benefits.”
In October of 2003, the Auto-ID Center licensed
its intellectual property to the EPC to the UCC —
the Uniform Code Council (the bar code folks).
The UCC created a new subsidiary called
EPCglobal to manage the licensing of intellectual
property and to allocate EPC numbers to end
users. EPCglobal also made the final determina-
tion of what the standards and protocols look like.

In late 2000, Dr. David Brock (one of the founders of the Auto-ID Center),
wrote a white paper that introduced the concept of the EPC, explaining why
the Universal Product Code (UPC or bar code) needed to be replaced with
the EPC. (For more on the Auto-ID Center, see the nearby sidebar, “Birth of a
revolution: The MIT Auto-ID Laboratory.”)
In the paper, Brock cited the UPC as one of the most successful standards
ever developed and pointed out that UPC coding and labeling touch a vast
number of elements in the supply chain. However, as I mention earlier in this
chapter, the evolution of technology has left the venerable UPC in the slow
lane. The emergence of the Internet, digitization of information, ubiquity and
low cost of computing power, and globalization of business necessitates a
new and better solution based on a network infrastructure that has been
built worldwide for the past 20 years.
The electronic product code, which uniquely identifies objects and facilitates
tracking throughout the product life cycle, was created to take advantage of
widespread broadband capability, faster computing power, and cheaper data
storage. The EPC was designed by the team at the MIT Auto-ID Center to be
a simple and extensible code for efficient referencing to networked informa-
tion: a worldwide license plate for every object ever made — an Internet of
things was the vision. This went well beyond what the UPC could ever dream
of doing with its limited data scheme and ability to be programmed with
information only one time.
How EPC is different from UPC
A UPC is limited because it contains only the manufacturer and product
codes. Figure 2-2 shows the representation of data stored on a UPC.

Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

The black lines and empty spaces of the bar code hold different representa-
tion of the data than what is the actual UPC numeric code. Similar to an
Internet IP address, the UPC code is made up of four different subsets:
 The first partition is a single digit indicating the numbering system used
to interpret the remaining characters. For example, a 0 as the first number
means that a regular UPC code will follow, but a 5 means that a coupon is
going to be represented by the rest of the numbers in the UPC.
 The second partition is made up of five numbers that designate the man-
ufacturer’s identification number.
 The next five digits represent the item number.
 Because I started with a single digit, I might as well end with one. The
last digit is added as a check used to validate the correct read from the
scanning process — a single-digit insurance.
With five digits for the manufacturer and five for the product, the UPC can pro-
vide up to 10 unique numbering systems, 100,000 manufacturer identifiers,
and 100,000 product types for each manufacturer.
The EPC differs from the UPC in a number of ways. First, like many new and
improved versions, it’s definitely bigger: namely, it stores a lot more informa-
tion. Figure 2-3 shows how the EPC data is structured.
The setup of EPC data is quite similar to the UPC, but there are some critical
improvements:
 Header: The first thing you’ll notice is that there’s a header. This tells
the RFID reader what type of number follows. The header is designed so
that the EPC tag can represent a military UID or an FDA code, instead of
a complete EPC structure.
 EPC Manager Number: The next partition is the EPC Manager Number,
which identifies the company or company entity.
 Object class: Next is the object class, similar to a stock-keeping unit,
or SKU.

Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

 Serial number: Lastly (and most importantly) is a serial number, which
is the specific instance of the object class being tagged. Thus, it identi-
fies the item with the specific tag as that item (not just a type of item).
Depending on the total data-carrying capacity of a tag, an EPC number can
be from 32 to 256 bits long. This means that rather than the 100,000 possible
numbers that the UPC can accommodate, the EPC can be used for millions of
trillions of unique items.
Why an EPC RFID tag doesn’t contain
more information
An EPC tag contains something quite nondescript: a 96-bit unique identifier.
This is a really big number that will never be repeated or allocated to anything
except that tag. Here are the two primary reasons why EPC numbers contain
only a unique identifier, as opposed to actual information about the product:
 Security: The EPC numbering system has often been compared with the
license plate systems that departments/bureaus of motor vehicles use.
Each car has a unique license plate, but you have to have access to the
DMV (or BMV) database to find out who owns the car, where the owner
lives, and other private information. The EPC is the same way. Because it
points to a file in a database, that file and the information it contains can
be as secure as any other data store. Being able to read a tag number
doesn’t matter if you don’t have access to the database to read what
information is related to that tag. The Generation 2.0 EPC protocol even
allows parts of the 96-bit number to be hashed or scrambled for even
greater security.
 Cost: Delivering a very low-cost RFID tag was one of the primary goals of
the Auto-ID Center. In order to get the cost as low as possible, the compo-
nents of each tag had to be as minimalist as possible. Memory on an inte-
grated circuit (IC) is one component that drives up the cost. The smaller
the memory requirements, the cheaper the tag. Originally, EPC tags held
64 bits, but end users and academics agreed that was too limiting.
The combination of cost and security drove the architects of the EPC proto-
col to set up an overall system in which a minimal amount of information (a
unique number) could be embedded on each tag.
The EPC protocol and data structure is the standard most widely accepted in
the U.S. supply chain because of the support of Wal-Mart, the DoD, and other
big players. There are still many other systems (see Chapter 21 for info on
standards and protocols for RFID) that do not conform to the EPC open stan-
dard but that are useful for certain applications. 
47
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

When might you use a system other than the EPC? A significant example is
the active tags used by the DoD. They are based on a proprietary technology
by Savi Technology (www.savi.com; a commercial supplier of active tags)
that stores all the information about the contents of each container, allowing
a soldier in the field to scan a tag and read what is in the container. This is
practical for the DoD because there is no way to look up a database file to
match an EPC number with its information out in an operational theater. Until
troops can parachute out of a plane and land in the remotest reaches of the
Earth with a high-speed Internet satellite connection on their hips, it is unlikely
that a license-plate scheme like the EPC will be effective in that environment.
How the EPC works
The EPC covers three primary areas of standards:
 The air interface protocol: The air interface protocol has been the
source of much confusion, consternation, and chagrin since the Auto-ID
Center supported the technology. The EPC Generation protocol was just
recently finalized and has gone to production after much iteration and
negotiations.
 The data structure for numbers on the tags: The data structure, which
I explain earlier in the section, “How EPC is different from UPC,” is now
universally agreed upon.
The data structure of the EPC was the source of much debate among
the major players during the earlier days of RFID development. The
original inventors of the EPC data structure felt that the governing body,
EPCglobal, diminished a significant technical advantage by changing
what the various blocks were used for. The DoD also responded that
the data structure was not suitable for its needs and made EPCglobal
include the DoD’s structure into the EPC.
 A network to look up tag information: This is the least accepted and
least evolved portion of the EPC standards. A globally adopted network
isn’t in place yet because many end users are simply adding EPC data to
their existing EDI systems.
What are the different protocols?
As RFID has developed into a viable replacement for the bar code, several dif-
ferent protocols have become available on the market, and each new proto-
col generally improves upon the shortcomings of its predecessors. 
Today, the companies requiring their suppliers to implement RFID have stan-
dardized on one protocol: the EPC Generation 2.0 (more on that in a moment).
However, you still see tags using earlier protocols, so it’s helpful to know how
to recognize them. Table 2-2 outlines what the different protocols are and key
information that you need to know about each one.

Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

As you make decisions about your RFID system, two factors that come into
play are where you are going to incorporate the RFID network and with whom
you’ll have to interoperate. Different regions or countries have different stan-
dards, and ISO and EPCglobal have different requirements incorporated into
their open standards. Chapter 3 covers using RFID in different countries.
The Class 0 tag is Symbol’s proprietary preprogrammed tag protocol, which
disallows an end user from writing a new number to the tag. Preprogrammed
tags both increase administrative and logistics costs of affixing the correct
tag to the correct item and minimize a tag’s flexibility, but remove the step of
needing to write to a tag on the factory floor. Manufacturers are allocated
specific blocks of EPC numbers (from the Uniform Code Council’s governing
division, EPCglobal) and add their own product codes and serial numbers to
their assigned manufacturer numbers to create unique identifiers. Class 0 has
gained most of its popularity for closed or tightly managed systems like air-
port luggage tracking. However, because it was an early Auto-ID standard,
Wal-Mart and the DoD agreed to support it for only a limited time.
50
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 
The origins of the protocols
The Auto-ID Center identified the necessity for
an RFID protocol that enabled an ultra-low-cost
RFID tag implementation. The Auto-ID Center
identified the cost of $.05 as the psychological
barrier cost that would enable widespread item
level RFID tagging. Although none of the exist-
ing standards or proprietary protocols at that
time enabled such a low-cost tag, Alien
Technology, a small California-based start-up,
had an efficient, high volume, chip-to-antenna
assembly technology. They accepted the
Center’s challenge of developing a low-cost
RFID system with the target of a tag costing less
than $.05. 
The Auto-ID Center, in conjunction with Alien
Technologies, developed the Generation 1 Class
1 standard. A similarly innovative company,
Matrics (purchased in 2004 by Symbol), came
forward with a less flexible but high-performance
protocol, with product available approximately
one year before the Class 1 product, and the
Auto-ID Center classified it as a Class 0 stan-
dard. Both Alien and Matrics focused on UHF
solutions. A third company, Philips, in conjunc-
tion with the Auto-ID Center, developed a high-
performance HF protocol, and it was also
coined as an EPC Class 1 standard. Then ISO
also got in the mix with its 18000 specifications.
The primary problems in the market place,
which were slowing adoption, were multiple
published standards, and none with products
available from multiple vendors.
As recently as 2004, the “acceptable protocols”
for use in pilots and implementations were
defined as either Class 0 or Class 1 Identity tags.
Although these were called open standards that
any vendor could use to identify products, they
were based on individual companies’ propri-
etary technology. At the same time, the ISO
18000 standard began to emerge. However,
these protocol standards are not interoperable.
Clearly, the world of RFID needed a single solu-
tion everyone could agree on and implement —
that would be Generation 2.0.

Class 1 tags allow end users to write serial numbers to their tags, but the
Class 1 Generation 1.0 reader technology does not enable communication
with Class 0 tags. The other problem with Class 1 Generation 1.0 tags is that
only 64 bits of memory are available on the tag, thus limiting potential num-
bering schemes.
The emerging ISO standard has four primary components, but ISO 18000-6 is
the one dealing with the UHF range. The ISO standard differs from the EPC
standard in that the ISO standard addresses only the air interface (how the
tags and readers talk to each other), while the EPC standard addresses other
components of the system beyond the air interface.
Working with the protocols: Why Generation 2.0 is better
The Auto-ID Center classified tags as Class 0 through Class 5 based on their
functionality. Class 0 and Class 1 were designed to be low-cost identity tags
and became the main drivers around the RFID revolution as they became the
focus of the retail and DoD mandates. The issues surrounding the confusion
between Class 0, Class 1, and the nuances in those classes have led the EPC
community to demand a clarification. However, the solution to keep the same
classifications — Class 0 through Class 4 — creates a next generation of each
class, aptly named Generation 2.0, or simply Gen 2.0. Therefore, a Gen 2.0
Class 1 tag is still a write once, read many (WORM) tag; however, it has a
truly open standard that any manufacturer can produce tags based on.
The next generation of EPC protocol is better for four primary reasons:
 It creates an interoperable, global standard.
 It makes deployment of many readers easier for end-users.
 It includes additional features that make it technically more advanced.
 It uses more advanced anticollision protocols for faster, more accurate
performance.
The Class 1 Generation 2.0 protocol is backward-compatible for Generation 1.0
Class 1 and Class 0, and replaces the specifications for both classes of tags.
Class 1 Generation 2.0 protocol also operates with the emerging ISO 18000-6
standard protocol (it is expected to become the ISO 18000-6c protocol with
ratification in late 2005), creating one global standard and enabling an efficient
solution for the lack of interoperability between Class 0 and Class 1 tags.
The Generation 2.0 tags utilize four distinct memory banks:
 Object Identification (OID) – EPC Data: The OID memory stores the
identifier of the object to which the tag is affixed and consists of a 16-bit
protocol-control parameter, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC16)
that ensures that no errors in data have been communicated from a tag
to a reader (with an accuracy rate of 99.998 percent), and an object iden-
tifier that is an N-bit EPC code (where N is any valid EPC length).
51
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

 Tag identification memory: The tag identification memory (as well as the
user memory) is incorporated within the Generation 2.0 Class 2 Higher
Functionality tags, which allow tag- and vendor-specific data storage.
The tag identification memory stores the unique identifier for the tag.
 User memory: The user memory allows user-specific memory storage.
 Reserved memory: This is used for system parameters, such as a
password.
Generation 2.0 Identity addresses the folks who are concerned about privacy
by having a feature in the form of the Conceal function and maintaining the
Kill function also found in the Generation 1 Class 0 and Class 1 protocols.
Concealed tags do not communicate any of their data until the reader sends
a password to the tag. A 16-bit random number generator (RN16) is used to
generate numbers for encryption of data communicated to the tag, so this
number “hashes” part of the data like scrambling a bunch of eggs, making it
nearly impossible for someone else to read.
How the EPC prepared for the future,
and who oversees that
Sanjay Sarma of the MIT Auto-ID Center originally proposed a way of develop-
ing an open standard protocol, which today is known as the EPC. He based his
idea on the work of the group that created the World Wide Web, aptly named
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C; www.w3c.com). Sarma developed EPC
so that it allows true standard interoperability. The Auto-ID Center hinged its
future — in fact, its very existence — on the notion that its founding sponsors
would accept the EPC. Because many of the founding companies were using
UPCs as the Auto-ID standard, it seemed like a reasonable bet that these com-
panies would adopt EPC because it was designed to be a close cousin.
The flexibility of the EPC also ensures future use and global uniqueness indefi-
nitely. A 96-bit number enables the theoretical identification of nearly a million,
trillion, trillion objects. To put this in perspective, if that many golf balls were
placed in a line, they would extend far beyond the edge of the known universe.
If these golf balls were formed into a sphere, they would make an object six
billion times larger than our sun. With that in mind, the industry believes that
a 96-bit code will suffice for object identification well into the future.
In November of 2003, the Auto-ID Center turned over its work to EPCglobal,
Inc., a joint venture between EAN International and the Uniform Code
Council, Inc. According to its Web site (www.epcglobalinc.org), EPCglobal
“carries forth the research completed by the Auto-ID Center to work toward
the development of industry-accepted standards and commercial adoption.” 
52
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

With the various standards evolving and more people requiring their
trading partners to adopt forms of RFID, keeping an eye on what is happen-
ing at EPCglobal can be critical to your long-term successful adoption of RFID.
EPCglobal also has several highly involved working groups, which bring
end users together to help figure out the best way to adopt RFID, from data
standards to preparing analysis on return on investment (ROI).
Addressing Privacy Concerns
With any new and highly disruptive technology, issues are raised about the
potential downside. The first among these, for the case of RFID, is the con-
cern about individual privacy:
 Why people are worried: A considerable driver of the fear of RFID as an
invasive technology is a lack of understanding about it. In a recent inter-
view, I was asked about sticky RFID tags that could surreptitiously be
placed on the bottom of someone’s shoes and then tracked wherever they
went, which is impossible. A more realistic fear is that someone could
monitor the arrival and departure of an item you’ve bought. For example,
if you purchase a watch with an embedded RFID tag and the tag was
associated with you, someone could conceivably monitor every time you
came and went to that store. However, this collection of information is
similar to what happens today. For example, if you pay with a credit card
or if you use a grocery discount card, that store is gathering information
about all your purchases. The concern is an extension of an old issue.
 Why people shouldn’t be concerned: The simple solution in most
instances is the basic countermeasure employed by everyone but Minnie
Pearl — that is, just take off the tag. If the tag is actually embedded in
something, cutting it off or just scraping the chip off the tag (easily done
with a pair of nail clippers) is sufficient to ruin the tag’s ability to commu-
nicate. The infrastructure and cost of RFID networks are also prohibitive
factors. Simple return on investment dictates that no amount of informa-
tion will pay for investing in an infrastructure that would be ubiquitous
enough to track items everywhere you go.
Although the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Congress have begun
instituting hearings to consider the possible regulation of RFID frequency
bands — which currently use unlicensed bands — existing property rights
and common-law privacy torts substantially limit the potential abuse of RFID.
Putting a chip or a reader on a person or person’s property against his or her
will is a tort and a violation of constitutional rights and fundamental liberties,
which is certainly a criminal offense. Hiding RFID readers in your house or
car would be no different than wiretapping your phone or hiding a video
camera in your kitchen. (And an RFID reader is a lot easier to locate than a
wiretap because it operates at a known, easily detectible frequency.)
53
Chapter 2: Auto-ID Technologies: Why RFID Is King of the Hill

Social forces will most likely regulate the use and deployment of RFID long
before the government and lawmakers get involved. The various types of
forces that regulate emerging technologies include economic incentives
(using a speedpass RFID token to shorten your wait at the gas pump), con-
sumer preferences (not having to stand in line to upgrade your DVD player
with new software), countermeasures (new tag protocols that cause the tag
to self-destruct), and existing laws that regulate the use of personal informa-
tion. RFID technology will be no more and no less controlled by these forces.
Among these regulating forces, buyer preference will most effectively regu-
late the use of RFID. Some citizens won’t want to pay to create and enforce
laws and regulations; others may opt for the convenience RFID offers.
Activists who have considerable privacy concerns should focus on ensuring
that companies post a simple notification that they use RFID tags, educat-
ing consumers of the true technological limitations, and tearing up all their
credit cards (because that’s where the juiciest information can be tracked,
like everything a person purchases online).

eploying an RFID network is a little bit like farting in church: It has spe-
cific impact for one person, it affects everyone else around that person,
but not everyone is going to stand up and say how they feel about it. The
difference is that, if you plan things correctly, your RFID deployment can be
a big hit with everyone — if you figure out how to make that happen with a
fart, let me know.
To make your RFID deployment successful, you need to consider all the
stakeholders and understand the different areas impacted by a new RFID net-
work before you start putting systems up around your facility. This chapter
walks you through the basic decisions and assessments you need to make
your deployment a success.
 First, I explain how to examine the areas of impact within your
organization.
 Then, I cover some basics of the technology, so you can begin making
basic decisions that shape your RFID network. I talk briefly about the fre-
quencies of various systems, and then give you some performance crite-
ria to think about as you plan your RFID strategy.
With just a little understanding of the areas impacted by RFID and the types of
systems available, you can start to understand the performance constraints
of modern RFID systems. This knowledge can also help you determine who to
involve in your RFID project and, more importantly, this knowledge can help
you avoid many of the “gotchas” that early adopters faced. If you begin your

design with the end in mind and you roll in the laws of physics, the limitations
of the current technology, and how products behave in an interrogation zones,
you’ve got the key ingredients of cooking up a successful RFID network.
Midas Touch Points: Where RFID
Impacts Your Organization
Without a good understanding of certain components within your business,
you can’t take advantage of RFID’s ability to provide real-time, serialized data.
You merely get more bad information a lot quicker — no more use to you
than a bad smell in a crowded room. You can have the Midas touch by turn-
ing this new technology into gold for your organization if you understand the
basics of the business process change, the impact on the information sys-
tems, and what needs to change within each facility.
The best way to get your arms around how the RFID network will impact your
organization is to assess your business from the touch points RFID creates.
Knowing those points is your key to success (and a critical part of the four
Ps — Process — which I introduce in Chapter 1). If the planning is done
correctly, these touch points can be as good as gold for your organization:
They’ll give you information about your systems, processes, and enterprise,
creating a true competitive advantage.
For most businesses, you can break this assessment of RFID’s overall impact
into three distinct workflows: business processes, physical infrastructure,
and systems and technology. To map out the points where RFID has an influ-
ence (the touch points), here’s an overview of the steps to follow:
1. Map out your current business processes and then identify points on
that map where RFID can improve those processes.
2. Determine points where you need to change your physical infrastruc-
ture in order to accommodate RFID.
3. Examine your current systems and technology and identify points
where you need to add to or change your IT infrastructure to accom-
modate RFID or fully take advantage of its benefits.
Discovering the touch points for these three workflows is your key to involving
the right people, picking the best starting point, creating a successful long-term
plan, and buying the right hardware and software.
This exercise alone can help shed light on what’s happening in the organiza-
tion and is a good way to get the RFID team working together. In Chapter 15,
I cover how to organize an RFID team, which is of critical importance as you
go through this mapping to make sure you’re not overlooking any areas of
your business.
56
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

Each area (business processes, physical infrastructure, and IT infrastructure)
must also be linked to your overall strategy. That is, you must also ask the
question, “What does the end-game look like?” As you work through each area,
you should gain insight to the following kinds of strategic level questions:
 After RFID is fully deployed, what is my competitive edge?
 How does this RFID deployment align with my supply chain management
goals?
 Do my trading partners share similar goals and objectives regarding
RFID deployment?
The following sections explain each step of the process in detail.
Outlining how RFID affects your business
processes
No matter what type of RFID application you’re using, you can map it as a
business process flow. Make sure you evaluate your current business
processes from end to end. The easiest way to start this is to get a white-
board (or an easel with sheets of paper) and diagram what happens from the
earliest point in your production or supply chain as possible. Here are some
common examples:
 Raw goods: Begin mapping from the point raw goods hits the arrival
docks. Show how the raw goods process changes into work-in-process,
and then what happens as it leaves the facility.
 Distribution channels: Map what happens when products arrive, how
are they stored and sorted, and what happens as they leave.
 Asset management: Begin when something is ordered and map what
happens when it arrives and how it’s accounted for annually.
The biggest ROI (return on investment) and strategic benefits from RFID
come from being able to improve your business processes. Trying to deploy
RFID with no change in existing process means only that you’re adding an
expense. That’s why, after you map current business processes, you need to
identify the business process touch points — that is, the points where RFID
will improve your business process. To identify possible touch points, look
for places where
 You can automate human tasks. Any place where human intervention is
required to read a label or scan a bar code is a possible place to put an
antenna and RFID reader to automate the procedure. By doing so, you
can eliminate employees and 
57
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

 You can eliminate frequent data errors. Data errors are usually the
result of humans doing the counting, so look at all the human interaction
throughout the process.
 You can benefit from real-time data capture. For instance, if there’s a
critical point in the working process where things need to be ordered or
work has to be scheduled, knowing when something reaches that point
is critical. RFID can enable that knowledge by sending specific informa-
tion or instruction to a central application the moment it reads a tag.
 Things must pass by a choke point (a place where all items need to pass
through during the normal process, like a toll booth on a highway is a
choke point for traffic). Reading data at these points will give you an idea
of real-time volume flow and timing. If you have applications that are set
up with automated decision rules (such as, do something if a certain con-
dition exists), RFID can enable these actions without human intervention
and in real time. A good example is scheduling a warehouse pickup; if
you are getting RFID information from a location at certain dock door, you
know that the next truck coming into the warehouse needs to be sched-
uled at a different dock door.
 Things are in-bound from suppliers or partners. Eventually your part-
ners will be tagging things, and if you can automatically count those
things, you can streamline the put-away, billing, and forecasting
processes significantly.
 You can directly correlate with key interrogation zones (places where
RFID readers scan tags for information) to check accuracy of informa-
tion. In other words, if things are put on a specific conveyor after they
come in a dock door, spending a couple thousand dollars for another
interrogation zone and linking it to the initial interrogation zone (at the
dock door for instance) can insure a high degree of accuracy and let you
know when one of the readers has performance issues.
For analysis purposes, try to incorporate RFID everywhere, even if you know
that it doesn’t make sense from a financial or technical perspective. You may
find possibilities you haven’t thought of in terms of benefits to the business
process. Brainstorm the RFID possibilities — don’t try to justify them or con-
sider the feasibility just yet. Think about where you might benefit from auto-
matic data capture and automatic counting.
As you work on evaluating business process touch points, the following ques-
tions may help you translate all the information you gather into a more con-
crete analysis:
 What objectives will determine success for your RFID initiative in the
next 6, 12, or 36 months?
 What benefits can RFID deliver and what cost is required? 
58
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

 How will you measure results against your baseline?
 At what facilities and which products will you pilot first?
 How does the business process need to change to accommodate RFID?
 What user scenarios and processes will you pilot?
 How will you document the impact that the pilot has on business
processes?
 What personnel issues need to be addressed — safety concerns, union
questions, privacy, and education?
 Should the program be funded with capital budget or operating budget?
 What are the tax implications of an RFID network?
 Can you get your landlord to subsidize it as part of the build-out
allowance?

for flat-loaded cases (those that employees put
directly on the truck, one at a time) should work
something like this: An employee scans a case
bar code as it is loaded into the truck from a con-
veyor going into the back of the truck. This bar
code scan as the case actually goes into the
truck indicates that the case has been loaded on
a specific outbound truck. In reality, though, 
pallets are not scanned as they go onto the 
truck. Instead, the pallets are staged off to a 
dedicated area in the warehouse near the out-
bound trailers — but not directly in them — just
waiting for the truck to be almost full so the pal-
lets can be loaded last, and therefore unloaded
first. When the pallet is staged off in that special
area, the employee scans a bar code that asso-
ciates the pallet with the specific outbound
trailer.
The problem this retailer faced is that often the
pallet doesn’t make it onto the truck because
the truck fills up with individual cases being flat-
loaded. In the inventory management system,
however, the pallet is recorded as having been
shipped on that truck and then received at the
store where the truck is off-loaded. This creates
a significant cascading effect on inventory
accuracy and data collection.
A situation like this is the perfect opportunity for
RFID to automate a bad process and improve
inventory accuracy and data collection. This
problem begs for RFID readers at the dock door,
logging everything that gets put onto the truck —
and only things that get put onto the truck — by
scanning dedicated pallet tags as they pass
by the readers. Even though the pallets may be
temporarily placed someplace for later loading
into the truck, they will be read only if they make
it on the truck. Not only will RFID make the
process much more accurate, it will eliminate
the business process of the person dropping off
the pallet having to stop and scan a spot on the
wall with the truck bar code to make the associ-
ation between truck and pallet. The forklift driver
can simply drop off the pallet at the staging area
and be on his merry way.

Determining how RFID will affect
your facility
Looking at your business process flows (as described in the preceding section)
spawns creative places to put RFID interrogation zones (radio frequency fields
where the tags are to be read). The next logical step is assessing touch points
in your physical infrastructure — or how and where your physical infrastruc-
ture needs to change in order to accommodate those interrogation zones.
As you look for these touch points, consider the following questions:
 What new hardware will you need? RFID systems require antennas,
readers, routers, data cable, and so on.
 How can you install, ruggedize, and power those systems? Look for
infrastructure that’s already in place (power and networking) as well as
capabilities you might need to add.
 How will data be sent back to a central application if you actually set
up readers and antennas in those locations?
 What items will you be tagging and tracking, and how and where will
you tag items?
 What performance and tracking requirements must be accommodated?
 What other systems in place currently generate RF noise, and how can
you plan to reduce that noise? In addition to your own facility, consider
how your systems might affect your neighbor’s or how your neighbor’s
systems might affect yours. Consider how you might make expansion
facilities RF-friendly.
You can find more information about determining what hardware you need
and how to set it up in Chapters 9 and 10.
The assessment of how RFID will impact your environment is the perfect
opportunity to involve your facilities team — engineers, property managers,
electricians. These folks can help you determine where you might need
custom installation solutions and understand whether you need to add
things such as additional conveyors, structures to protect against forklift
accidents, and additional power sources.
A great way to begin understanding the impact on the physical infrastructure
and facilities is by practicing a little management by wandering around (MBWA).
After walking through your facilities with your warehouse or production super-
visor, get a copy of your engineering drawings and mark out potential locations
for the RFID interrogation zones. This helps you understand where you may
have to supply dedicated power, install CAT-5 cable, and alter current working
conditions like conveyor directions or forklift paths.
60
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

In addition, the information you gather in MWBA helps when you make tech-
nology assessment decisions, as described in the next section. For example,
you may decide that you need a reader that can be powered over Ethernet, or
that RS-485 is the only communication that will make it across your full facility.
Evaluating your technical needs
The four little letters, R-F-I-D, have shot fear into the heart of system adminis-
trators and application engineers like nothing since the three characters, Y-2-K.
Many early estimates of the impact of RFID technology projected that terabytes
of data would surge out of each warehouse, and companies would have to
install dozens of T-1s to transport the data between locations. Fortunately,
that isn’t the case for well-architected and -constructed RFID networks.
A critical step in creating this well-constructed network is understanding all
the touch points of an RFID network to the IT system. Because the benefits of
RFID networks are predicated on transporting real-time, serialized data into
an application that can make sense of it all, two areas to examine for IT touch
points are applications and data transmission.
Applications
One of the keys to handling the billions of reads that happen in a typical ware-
house is to have specialty middleware (filtering software) for the readers. The
data created by an RFID reader needs to be filtered and smoothed before it is
useful for any application. The special filtering and smoothing software is
called a reader interface, EPC information server, or a Savant. The reader inter-
face is the key to making the data volume manageable and the information
useful. (I go over the various middleware options in detail in Chapter 11.)
The middleware enables you to use RFID with existing applications, such as
warehouse management systems (WMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP)
suites, or inventory management packages. The good news is that the leading
software companies are all developing middleware modules specifically
designed for RFID. Although many of these will not be commercially viable
until 2006, they will still solve many of the problems IT staff are concerned
with, such as the form that the data will need to be exported in, how the
multiple reads will be filtered, and what the key filters for the data are.
Data transmission
Data transmission is another critical area to consider beyond the principal
business applications. You need to figure out how to transmit the data
coming off your readers to your trading partners — most likely on one of
your existing systems. Although this is nothing new, you do need to transfer
61
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

more data and do so in a different format from the UPC. The key RFID influ-
encers who are driving the mandates — Wal-Mart, the Department of Defense,
Tesco, Target, and others — require partners to
 Use the electronic product code (more commonly known as EPC; see
Chapter 2 for details).
 Exchange that EPC data by using existing systems such as EDI
(Electronic Data Interchange, the systems used to send order informa-
tion between partners), Web-based systems like AS2, or custom systems
like Wal-Mart’s Retail Link.
This data exchange happens today without EPC numbers: When a client orders
a particular item from a supplier, that supplier sends an order confirmation
and/or an advanced shipping notification (ASN) back to the client. The client
company stores that information — specifically the item’s description and UPC
or serial number — in its system locally, and knows to expect the item in an
upcoming shipment.
To optimize your systems for RFID, the critical task for your organization is
associating the scanned EPC numbers as they come in the door with EPC
numbers on things like an ASN. Part of determining your IT touch points is
figuring out how to use your existing methods of data interchange to carry
additional information about each item, case, or pallet received. In most
instances, this is a simple 96-bit hexadecimal number (the EPC number), so
you should plan to deal with that number as a unique data identifier.
Some people have talked about a global look-up system like the Domain Name
Service (DNS), particularly VeriSign, which runs the DNS system. VeriSign has
invested heavily in building and marketing an EPC network specifically to look
up EPC data. However, this is likely to be used only by a few niche industries,
such as the pharmaceutical industry. Most other industries will have existing
methods of transporting data and won’t go to the additional expense of adding
another network layer that requires each number to be looked up. It is seldom
necessary to look up each EPC number on a central data repository like you
do with a Web page or other system using the Domain Name Service (DNS).
Data will travel the way it does today — by being pushed through existing
systems, which will be optimized for RFID. A look-up system like the EPC
network would only be used for exceptions. The other solutions that exist
are specialized overlay networks for global data exchange. By only looking
up exceptions and pushing EPC data over existing systems like AS2 or ASN,
the bandwidth requirements are significantly lower than if you looked up
every tag that was read coming into your facility.
Drilling down to the touch points
With an overall understanding of how your IT infrastructure needs to change
to take advantage of RFID, your RFID team can begin assessing more specific
62
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

IT touch points. The following questions can help you make critical decisions
and create a well-developed implementation plan:
 How will data in remote locations away from primary data centers be
stored and backed-up? Estimate the data storage needs for the next 6,
12, and 36 months.
 How will data be transported between locations? More importantly,
what data has to make it back to a central application or location to be
actionable, and what form does that data need to be in? Consider whom
you need to synchronize data with, and how you’ll address data synchro-
nization internally and externally.
 What is the appropriate integration strategy and technology to employ?
Consider how RFID will impact the existing applications. Do you need to
do a full integration with your and your trading partner’s applications or
can you take advantage of new technologies like integration networks
from providers like Grand Central?
 How will you manage the RFID infrastructure after it’s installed and
operational? Do you need a 24/7 operational RFID network? Consider
whether you need to increase bandwidth to facilities with RFID infra-
structure and whether you need to rearchitect your network to include
wireless or additional security for RFID?
 How will configurations be classified for different reader set-ups? How
can those configurations be pushed out automatically to new readers
added to the network? You’ll want untrained personnel to be able to add
readers or replace faulty ones, and know that they belong to a configura-
tion class that may be called dock door, or conveyor, and then push that
configuration remotely onto that reader.
 What happens to reader configuration, data, and routing if a power
failure occurs — is there a back-up strategy in place?
 Can the RFID system be incorporated with logistic systems to allow
trucks inbound with tagged items to specific dock doors that are set
up with RFID?
 How will existing processes need to be changed to handle data? Does
information come back today in batch form once a day, once a week, or
at other scheduled intervals? RFID’s benefit is giving information back in
real time — what changes need to be made to leverage that advantage?
 How will your systems take advantage of serialized data? Most bar
code scanners can record only that a box of tiddlywinks arrived. It won’t
likely know the difference and specifics of each individual box of tiddly-
winks. A significant benefit of RFID is that you can know a vast amount
of data on each box, case, or item, such as when it arrived, where its
going, how long its shelf life is, and so on. Being able to act on this type
of data is critical to your IT system.
63
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?
REM didn’t know the first thing about RFID when they sang that line in their
’90s hit, but it’s the right question to ask (if you ever find out who Kenneth is)
because the choices are many.
The mandates many suppliers are forced to comply with will dictate the type
of RFID network you put in. Most of the highly publicized mandates require
suppliers to use UHF, which is 902–928 MHz in the United States.
The reason for this choice of frequency is largely due to work at MIT’s Auto-
ID Center in early 2000: The innovation centered on UHF’s ability to read tags
at greater distances than other frequencies. This has made UHF the early
favorite in the supply chain world. However, other frequencies have their
places in the evolving world of RFID.
64
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 
Data synchronization
A core component of the success of RFID net-
works in a global, collaborative world is the abil-
ity to synchronize data with partners. That data
may be anything from case docket numbers for
evidence to SKU numbers and pricing. Various
industries are looking at different ways of syn-
chronizing the data between trading partners,
but it is a challenging issue. The pharmaceutical
world, for example, could have one central data-
base to list products and track the location of
each of those products, but who would manage
that? The Food and Drug Administration is a likely
candidate because there are significant security,
fraud, diversion, and liability concerns that RFID
can solve without giving away competitive infor-
mation; however, the FDA is not set up to do that.
Moreover, they don’t want to do it.
The logical place to turn is the associations. The
Healthcare Distribution and Manufacturers
Association (HDMA) is one possibility. The
goal is to have a central repository where
stores, distributors, and hospitals can verify the
pedigree and chain of custody of high-theft or
high-counterfeit drugs. This is why a central
database would need to be accessed by many
different parties. This issue is prevalent across
many industries starting to look at RFID and
exploring a more collaborative network among
trading partners.
The retail world is leading the charge and may
be a good place for others to look for early
learning. The retail industry has standardized on
the EPC protocol and data structure on each tag
so there can be a central store of data: the
EPCglobal registry. The registry exists so that
accurately described and consistent product
information can be exchanged between trading
partners. Wal-Mart has selected the Uniform
Code Council and its data synchronization
system UCCnet as the preferred method of
exchanging information. As of this book going
to print, 650 suppliers send item information to
the data pool on a machine-to-machine basis.
This model seems to be working and will even-
tually be replicated across other industries.

Understanding the difference between
licensed and unlicensed frequencies
Because RF waves can have such a big impact on other receivers and are
much more difficult to block than say, light waves, RF waves are tightly con-
trolled by the FCC (and its equivalents in other countries). The FCC and its
spectrum license process (which you may have heard about in spectrum auc-
tions) specify the frequencies, communication means, amplitudes, and uses
that are permitted through a process known as spectrum licensing, which
allows for both unlicensed and licensed bands:
 Unlicensed frequency bands: The popularity of particular frequencies
arises because of pre-existing technology and the fact that the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) has allocated certain sections of the
frequency band as unlicensed. This means that as long as people follow
rules of transmission and broadcast, anyone can use these frequencies.
The FCC has created unlicensed usage for low-frequency (LF), high-
frequency (HF), and ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) bands.
 Licensed frequency bands: These bands require you to pay to use a
certain frequency band. Ever since governing bodies began allocating
licensed frequency ranges, big-spending speculators have been cashing
in. Frequency bands were the area of much speculation during the ’80s
and ’90s and resulted in many spectacular overnight millionaires.
The good news for those folks who need to adopt RFID because of a trading
partner or client requirement is that they will likely be able to use the unli-
censed ISM band and not have to deal with the FCC. Chances are you need
to use UHF in the unlicensed ISM band (902–928 MHz), and you won’t need to
worry about purchasing spectrum rights. If you’re looking to build propri-
etary closed-loop systems, you need to go through the process of applying
for an FCC license. Using a licensed spectrum is applicable for closed sys-
tems in which interoperability is not of concern.
Examining the most common
frequencies in RFID
RFID systems use many different frequencies, but generally the most
common are unlicensed low-frequency (LF, around 125 KHz), high-frequency
(HF, 13.56 MHz), and ultrahigh-frequency (UHF, 902–928 MHz). Microwave
(2.45 GHz) is also used in some applications.
65
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

Radio waves behave differently at different frequencies, so you have to
choose the right frequency for the right application. Here are two key factors
to keep in mind:
 How far the frequency is able to read: The higher the frequency, the
shorter the wavelength for RF transmission. Without going into the
details of the physics, the shorter the wavelength, the better a small
antenna like an RFID tag is able to receive a transmission at greater dis-
tances. Therefore, the lower the frequency, the shorter the read distance
for an equal tag size.
 How well that frequency works with the materials you need to use:
You need to decide the properties that are most important in the appli-
cation, such as being able to work in an environment where metal,
liquid, or machines are prevalent. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more details
on how different materials affect RF waves and how to get optimal reads
with those materials.
Table 3-1 gives an overview of the read distances for the different frequencies
as well as examples of the types of applications that might use particular fre-
quencies.

Frequencies, power, and countries
UHF RFID systems have been around only since the mid-1990s, and countries
have not agreed on a single area of the UHF spectrum for RFID. If you’re part
of a global organization that’s planning on adopting RFID worldwide, you
need to look at the various frequencies and power levels being used across
the globe. In North America, Europe, and Japan:
 Low Frequency (LF) 125–134 kHz is used for RFID applications.
 High Frequency (HF) 13.56 MHz is used at very similar power levels.
UHF frequencies aren’t so streamlined, however. Table 3-2 outlines the UHF
spectrums used in different geographic areas at the time this book went to
press and the power antennas require to use those spectrums (expressed in
both watts and ERP).

Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

Also, on the other side of the Earth is the hugely influential factor in RFID fre-
quency standards I call the China Syndrome. Nearly 20 percent of what is
shipped into the United States from China is destined for Wal-Mart. Ideally all
those cases coming in would have a UHF tag affixed to them, per Wal-Mart’s
mandate. However in China, 915 MHz is used for GSM mobile communication
systems: A factory, warehouse, hotel, or community may set up its own pri-
vately managed system at this band. Because this band is already actively
used in China, it is unlikely to be reallocated for RFID.
With this heterogeneous mix of global frequencies, both readers and tags
have to become more agile. Now both readers and tags that can read multiple
frequencies and have various power levels are on the market. However, no
regulatory body (like the FCC) wants to allow a unit whose power can be
changed to be sold, because enforcement issues would be a nightmare. The
U.S. DoD is having to address these problems in a particularly creative way
because it sets up and builds systems overseas and needs to comply with the
regulations in the resident country. It’s a tricky situation for any global multi-
national corporation or agency like the DoD to maintain central IT infrastruc-
ture control and local compliance.
One thing you may end up doing, if you’re planning and testing in the United
States, is applying to the FCC for a specific license to be allowed to test
European or Japanese spectrum in the United States This helps you decide
on the right hardware and solutions for your global infrastructure but
enables you to test them in one location.
For more information, the government, as always, is here to help. Check out
the FCC’s site:

Beyond UHF: Looking toward the future
UHF has undoubtedly taken the early lead in the RFID race. Investment and
innovation have been centered on UHF, but the buzz around RFID is creating
an investment tide that will raise all boats. Recently, deals focused on HF and
2.45 GHz (microwave) have also received funding from venture capitalists.
This means that other frequencies will have an opportunity to show their
strengths as they become more user-friendly.
Certain niche industries will drive the adoption of frequencies other than
UHF. This is happening today in the pharmaceutical world. The big pharma-
ceutical companies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some drug
stores are currently deploying 13.56 MHz (HF) systems for tracking expensive
drugs. The reason they have decided to use HF and buck the trend of using
UHF is twofold:
68
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

 Most of the drugs have a high liquid content, and HF performs better
than UHF for close-range liquid items.
 A number of items in very close proximity to one another need to be
accurately read. HF has a better ability to manage the issues raised by
this close proximity in what is referred to as the near field, particularly if
there is little movement.
The near field and near-field communications (NFC) are getting their own
notoriety as a unique technology. However, they’re really just a specific type
of RFID that uses the HF band of the spectrum (in the United States and
Europe, this is most often 13.56 MHz). In addition to the different band, it
uses a different form of communication that has an impact on the usable
range. Remember that the lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength.
If 13.56 MHz is used, the wavelength is about as long as a football field; any-
thing closer than that full wavelength distance is said to be in the near field.
Practically speaking, this means that NFC must happen in very close range —
usually under one foot. Near-field communication is all via magnetic waves
and has an inverse sixth power (1/r6) relationship with range, which explains
why the range is only a few inches because the power to wake up and com-
municate with a tag diminishes very quickly.
Speed, Accuracy, or Distance —
Pick Two
It is quite possible to optimize various RFID frequencies to work at extended
distances, and on very fast moving items, and with many items in the interroga-
tion zone — but not optimally with all three at once. The limitations surround-
ing RFID systems and various frequency choices are such that you need to
decide the most important criteria for the information you need and design
your system around that criteria. Another way of saying this is that you need
to account for the laws of physics (one of the four Ps that I introduce in
Chapter 1).
The laws of physics clearly dictate the behavior of radio frequency, electro-
magnetic radiation, and radio communication. Although many people would
have you believe it is some esoteric black art, it is not. Many people make the
mistake of not even considering some of the known laws of physics as they
start building an RFID system. The systems they deploy are usually deemed
poor performers because of so-called immature technology, when in fact it’s
because of engineering errors. Another reason people say RFID technology is
immature is that they try to buy a “slap and ship” solution, thinking it will
work for any application. But there is no silver bullet, or “RFID in a Box”
solution, no matter what someone’s marketing literature tells you.
69
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

A properly designed RFID network is customized for the particular environ-
ment, product characteristics, IT systems, and business processes. The only
way you can select the right tags is to test what will be tagged. The only way
to select the right readers is to investigate the physical environment, know
the tags you’re using, and then decide on the best solution. Although this
may seem like an impossible task to manage, you can build a system that’s
both customized and meets your needs by designing the nodes of your RFID
network one at a time, but doing so with the full network in mind and going
for as much standardization as possible. Follow a sound scientific methodol-
ogy starting with the physics, and you’ll have a highly accurate, easily main-
tained RFID network.
The follow sections help you gain a basic understanding of the physics and
limitations you need to work with as you design the system and how that
system will work within your business. This section can be your foundation,
and Part II explores the physics of RFID in even more detail.
Designing for the right read distance
Distance is one simple parameter to consider as you evaluate your system
requirements. By understanding your business process, where you need to
have interrogation zones, and how wide an area you need to cover (all
explained earlier in this chapter), you can figure out how far your readers
need to read.
If the area is wider than a couple feet, you likely need UHF (as opposed to HF
or LF). When designing an UHF system, you want to determine the maximum
read distance as well as the minimum because in RFID networks, too much
distance isn’t a good thing. Reader manufacturers make bold claims about
the distance at which their readers can read a tag: “Tags read at 15 meters”
or “30-foot accurate reads.” These distances don’t matter in the real world.
In all the deployments I’ve done, I have yet to see a dock door that’s 60 feet
across (needing a reader that can read 30 feet from one side and 30 feet from
the other side). In fact, very few applications require a read distance beyond
6 or 7 feet, particularly in a typical dock door setup with an antenna on each
side of a door (so a read range needs to be only half the door width).
After you know what distance you need, you also need to consider the quality
and design of the equipment and other factors that affect the read range. The
primary factors are
 The sensitivity of the radio on the reader or its receiving capabilities:
You can determine this by comparing readers side by side in a lab set-
ting, which I explain in Chapter 10.
 The transmitted wave’s absolute power: This is usually regulated by
governing bodies like the FCC or ETSI.
70
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

A number of sophisticated (and well-known) physics equations dictate
the effect of distance and the power of the wave transmitted on read
range. An RFID wave propagating from an antenna is like a grenade
exploding — it blows up in all directions. One of the known equations
of physics proves that when the distance from the transmitter doubles,
the strength of the original RFID signal (or wave) is quartered. The fancy
name for this is the inverse-square relationship and knowing this relation-
ship helps you plan what level of power you need for the distance you
need to cover. I go over this in more detail in Chapter 10.
 The path of the wave relative to environmental factors. Ambient elec-
tromagnetic noise or interfering factors can affect a reader’s ability to
obtain accurate readers across a given distance. In Chapter 7, I spend a
lot of time helping you understand how to look at the environment and
all the noise that may affect your RFID system.
RFID is just another form of radio communication — like your car’s radio
or mobile phone — and it is susceptible to interference. That interference
can come from many different types of materials. As RF waves slide
through materials, they may be absorbed or reflected, depending on the
properties of the material and the type of radiation. This change in the RF
waves results in a reduction, or attenuation, of the strength of the wave.
Attenuation changes depending on the type of material RF waves pass
through. In addition to attenuation, there can be interference by other
waveforms that desensitize the receiving antennas of the RFID system.
Bottom line is, to read tags accurately across a given distance, you need to
carefully consider the readers’ radio and power and the environmental fac-
tors. However, the farther away you need to read, the more likely you are to
run into diminished power and interference from environmental factors.
Reads — tell me how fast and how many
After you understand the principles behind read distance and can identify
the maximum read distance you need (as described in the preceding sec-
tion), the next step is to figure out the speed of reads required in your system
and how many can be read in a set period of time.
If you’re using a bar code system today, even adding two reads per second
can be twice as good, or 100 percent better, than what you have today. RFID
allows much more than double the bar code speed.
To figure out required speed for your tag readers, you need to understand
how many items will go through the interrogation zone per second or per
minute. Basically, what you’re trying to determine is whether the solution
needs to be set to interrogate continuously so it never misses an item (for
example if you need to read pallets as they pass through a dock door), or if
you can just look for changes in the field (like if something was sitting on a
71
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

shelf or in a case). If you’re not sure, see Chapter 6, where you can find more
details about common RFID setups, such as dock doors, conveyors, shelves,
and shrink wrap stations.
If you determine that you need to interrogate continuously, note that an impor-
tant factor in the speed is the air interface protocol that your system uses. If
your system is tuned and configured properly, you can read tens of dozens of
RFID tags in an interrogation zone almost at the same time. It happens so
quickly that it may seem like the tags are being read simultaneously, but the
majority of air interface protocols (like the modified ALOHA slot protocol in
the Generation 2.0 standard) are read and identified consecutively so that
there are no issues with collision — tags interfering with each other.
The anticollision protocols in the Generation 2.0 version of the electronic
product code (EPC) standard were under much debate in order to attempt to
optimize the reads per second. The critical factor for performance is that the
protocol and readers can identify unique tags. The reader determines this by
talking first — or sending out a signal to the tag — to wake up the tags in a
method known as reader talks first.
I introduce the EPC and its protocols, including Generation 2.0, in Chapter 2.
For more details about how these protocols work, see Chapter 5.
Reading multiple tags at once —
accuracy considerations
Like in most things in life, faster is not necessarily more accurate in an RFID
system. As you evaluate tag readers, you want a metric that accounts for the
speed and the accuracy.
Thus, the best metric for comparing different readers is the time to last tag in
the field. The system that best “wakes up” all the tags that you need to read
in the interrogation zone (as a pallet comes through a forklift or a tray leaves
a centrifuge) and transmits the information on those tags back to the receiver
is the system that is more accurate and will best meet your needs.
Make sure you distinguish the “time to last tag in the field” metric from the
absolute best value for the numbers of reads per second. For example, it’s
possible to read a single tag several hundred times in a second (the absolute
best value), but that same system may not be able to read a hundred different
tags at once in that same second.
72
Part I: Now That You Can Spell RFID, Here’s the Rest of the Story 

You discover the difference between the two metrics in your reader testing,
which I explain in more detail in Chapter 10. Here’s an overview of the steps
to clarify how the process works:
1. Test a single tag in the interrogation zone and record the number of
reads over a set period of time.
2. Test some number of tags over the same period of time.
3. Compare the two read rates.
You can expect results something like this:
• 1 tag tested for 30 seconds yields 1,000 reads
• 10 tags tested for 30 seconds yields 100 reads
In addition to the metrics, here are some considerations for weighing accuracy
against speed and distance, as you decide on the basic design of your RFID
system:
 If tags move through an interrogation zone very quickly, you need read-
ers configured to broadcast and receive data very quickly. Because that
setup is focused on very quickly reading every tag that goes by, it is not
possible to read more than a few tags at maximum speed.
 Similarly, because a tag takes time to respond to an inquiry from a
reader, the farther away that tag is from the reader and the weaker that
signal is, the longer it takes to get that response back and receive the
next one.
So if you want speed and accuracy, you need to keep the number of tags to
read within the capabilities of the system, and if you want to emphasize
speed and accuracy, you want the shortest distance possible between the
tag and reader. The reason for these constraints is because of the frequency
hopping — the fact that each channel can broadcast only for a short period
of time and then has to switch channels. Therefore, if you’re in the middle of
communication and the channels change, there is a higher likelihood of miss-
ing a receiving communication from the tags.
Now What about the Tags and Objects?
The tag is in fact a tiny RFID system: It receives an RF wave, processes the
signal, and transmits an RF wave. Those waves are subject to the same laws
of physics that the readers are subject to. With these laws in mind, you need
to consider how the objects and the tags on those objects will work with
your system:
73
Chapter 3: Making Basic Decisions about Your RFID System

 Consider how the object might affect the system: Whether the object is
a case, a pallet, or a laptop, you need to know how it will respond to the
various factors that make up an RFID system. If the tag is surrounded by
liquid, for example, that liquid will strongly attenuate the RF wave. A
metal object may change the tuning of a tag (or frequency on which it
can receive signals), reflecting the RF waves from a reader, or block
communication from a specific antenna.
 Remember that the tag and object need to work together while fre-
quency hopping: The constraint that you have to face in the United States
is the use of frequency hopping across 124 channels from 902–928 MHz.
This means that the tag on an object has to be properly tuned to read well
in all those channels because, according to FCC regulations, a reader can
broadcast on any given channel for only a certain period of time (400 milli-
seconds per channel over any 20-second period in most instances). This
is considered wideband communication because it takes place over a
wide band of communication channels — 902–928 MHz.
See Chapter 5 for more details on understanding the physics of tags and
choosing the right one. See Chapter 9 for all the specifics of testing for the
proper tag and placement.

f this book is your first bit of reading on the topic of radio frequency 
identification, this chapter serves to ground you in the basics of radio fre-
quency technology and how it came around to tracking small tags through
the supply chain. If you’ve been inundated with press about the newest and
most disruptive technology in decades, this chapter is your reality check.
This chapter walks you through some of the basics of good old-fashioned
physics and the laws that God created for science.
In this chapter, I describe the elements of an RFID network. The description
starts with basic RFID components and moves step by step to a full Web-
enabled supply chain network. This step-by-step approach helps you under-
stand how a single tag the size of a quarter can grow into a global supply
chain technology that is capable of saving billions of dollars. The RFID net-
work is built up one node, and one tag, at a time. Understanding the individ-
ual components and how they fit together helps you frame architecture and
deployment strategies.
Elements of a Basic RFID System
Learning the fundamentals of RFID can be overwhelming. You can avoid feel-
ing overwhelmed and the sensation of going around and around in circles,
and the sensation of going around and around in circles — I’m just messing
with you — by understanding the basics of how data travels in waves and
then through a network in an RFID system. This understanding gives you a
solid foundation for greater knowledge as you explore the global architecture
of RFID.

In a basic RFID system, four fundamental components are required for data to
make its grand journey:
 A transponder (more commonly just called a tag) that is programmed
with information that uniquely identifies itself, thus the concept of
“automatic identification”
 A transceiver (more commonly called a reader) to handle radio commu-
nication through the antennas and pass tag information to the outside
world
 An antenna attached to the reader to communicate with transponders
 A reader interface layer, or middleware, which compresses thousands of
tag signals into a single identification and also acts as a conduit between
the RFID hardware elements to the client’s application software systems,
such as inventory, accounts receivable, shipping, logistics, and so on
Figure 4-1 shows the basics of how a simple RFID system works and the four
main components of that system.
For now, I focus on a passive RFID system and a passive tag. Here’s an
overview of how the system works:
1. The tag is activated when it passes through a radio frequency field,
which has been generated by an antenna and reader.
2. The tag sends out a programmed response.
3. The antenna that generated the field originally and is attached to the
reader detects that response.
4. The transceiver (or reader) sends the data to the middleware.
5. The middleware sends the information contained in the tags to whatever
systems need that information.

Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

The following sections discuss the role each piece of the system plays in 
creating waves and transmitting data through those waves and into your 
network.
Everything starts with the tag
A tag, in a passive RFID system, is a little transceiver waiting to be turned on
(and no, that doesn’t happen by seeing a tag of the opposite sex). The tag has
a small computer chip (or memory area) that is programmed with informa-
tion that uniquely identifies the tag. This information is sent when the tag is
activated (turned on).
A passive RFID transponder does not contain its own power source; rather, 
it absorbs energy propagated from a reader antenna’s radio frequency (RF)
field to supply all the power it needs to wake up its chip and communicate
with a reader by sending back (backscattering) the information contained 
in its memory to a receiving antenna. As tags move into an antenna’s radio
field, they are excited, and each one transmits its identification data. 
For more on the inner workings and physics of tags, see Chapter 5.
Antennas send and receive radio waves
Both tags and readers have their own antennas because they are both radio
devices. A tag antenna, which is only a few centimeters (or less) long, attaches
to the integrated circuit (IC, or just chip) to absorb a signal and then transmit
out a slightly modified signal. The reader antennas range in size but are gener-
ally about the size of a computer flat screen and are specially tuned to transmit
and receive RF signals.
Antennas are how readers communicate with the outside world. Reader
antennas send radio signals into the air to activate a tag, listen for an echo
(or backscatter) from the tag, read the data transmitted by a tag, and, in some
cases, write data onto a tag. Antennas act as conduits between the tag and
the transceiver and can function continuously or on demand.
 Continuously active antenna systems are used when tagged items are
present on a regular basis or when multiple tags are passing through the
antenna’s detection field.
 On the other hand, an antenna’s detection field can be activated only
when needed by a sensor of some kind. The on-demand method can be
triggered by optical, pressure, or other kinds of proximity sensors.
79
Chapter 4: What Makes Up an RFID Network

Antennas come in a variety of shapes and sizes; I explain how to choose the
right one from a physics perspective in Chapter 5. This diversity in size and
shape allows antenna placement in a wide variety of locations — from ware-
house doors to highway tollbooths. 
Readers tell the antennas what to do
An antenna is connected to a transceiver (which is generally known as a
reader). Typically, one to four antennas are attached to a single reader, and
those antennas send out the reader’s signals. Basically, the reader tells the
antennas how to generate the proper RF field, which can cover an area as
small as 1 inch to as large as 100 feet or more, depending on the power
output and the frequency. When an RFID transponder (or tag) moves into the
antenna’s radio field, it becomes active and sends back to the antenna what-
ever information has been programmed into its memory. A reader receives
the tag’s signal through its array of antennas, decodes the signal, and sends
the information to the host computer system. A reader can also transmit spe-
cial signals to a tag — telling a tag to come alive, synchronizing a tag with the
reader, or interrogating all or part of the tag’s contents.
The middleware transforms the system 
into a network of objects
The basic elements of an RFID system are rarely useful in isolation. They gain
value as part of a production or logistics system. In this way, the use of more
than one system in an industrial process becomes a local network. The con-
nection of local networks constitutes a global network. You can think of the
local networks as a node of hardware (a reader, antennas, and tags) that
interacts within itself to exchange information over RF waves. A bunch of
nodes connected together creates a global network that connects to an appli-
cation that creates useful information out of the data.
In order to move data from a single node to the local network and/or to the
global network, you need the data-collection component, which ties readers,
antennas, and tags together. This component is called by many names —
middleware, reader interface layer, Savant — all describing the very simple
glue that sticks together each node in an RFID system.
Middleware connects the data coming into a reader to the client’s host soft-
ware systems. The middleware provides a coherent and stable interface
between the RFID hardware operations and the flow of data elements, such 
as EPC (electronic product code) numbers, into inventory, sales, purchasing, 
marketing, and similar database systems distributed throughout an enterprise.
80
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

The elements of middleware include the following:
 Reader and device management: RFID middleware allows users to con-
figure, monitor, deploy, and issue commands directly to readers through
a common interface.
 Data management: As RFID middleware captures EPC data or other data
from readers, it can intelligently filter and route it to the appropriate
destinations.
 Application integration: RFID middleware solutions provide messaging,
routing, and connectivity features required to integrate RFID data into
existing supply-chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning
(ERP), warehouse management (WMS), or customer relationship man-
agement (CRM) systems.
 Partner integration: Middleware can provide collaborative solutions
like business-to-business (B2B) integration between trading partners.
The basic elements provide the data source or the local node to generate
data. A series of these are linked into a local network that can connect to
either a larger network or even a global network by employing middleware.
An RFID network is a peer-to-peer architecture capable of aggregating highly
actionable data to a central location. See Chapter 10 for more details about
middleware.
Imagine this: The use of a single tag, no larger than a book of matches, is mul-
tiplied millions of times over within a global supply chain, which creates a
peer-to-peer network that shares data in real time across a limitless number
of boundaries. The image of the single millimeter-sized chip quickly expands
to comprise a warehouse; a company; an industry; and a world of rapidly
changing, automatically updated, real-time information. From that tiny chip
blossoms the power to know where every object is at all times in a global net-
work. Pretty cool, huh?
Time to Make Some Waves —
Electromagnetic Waves
To understand today’s new RFID technology and equipment, it is important
to understand the fundamentals of the science. RFID is all about physics.
Laws and mathematical equations that describe the behavior of this technol-
ogy have been around for decades, even centuries. Although some people
might have you believe that a successful RFID deployment requires you to
wear sacred shells, sacrifice a chicken, and walk across hot coals, black
magic usually isn’t required.
81
Chapter 4: What Makes Up an RFID Network

The best RFID engineers understand where the technology originated, what
its limitations are, and how the laws of physics can be leveraged as an asset
in the design and deployment of an RFID network. The following sections
explain basic principles of electromagnetic waves, how they’re measured,
and how they affect each other.
82
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 
Plowing the fields for electromagnetic 
radiation: A timeline
As far back as science knows, various fields of
electronic and magnetic radiation have existed.
But the field of radio frequency communication
didn’t really take off, from the perspective of
RFID, until the late 1800s:
 In the 1860s, while all his friends were out
playing golf, James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish
physicist, predicted the existence of radio
waves and postulated uses for those waves. 
 A short while later, in 1886, German scientist
Heinrich Rudolf Hertz skipped Oktoberfest to
prove that rapid variations of electric current
could be projected into space in the form of
radio waves similar to light waves, and that
this current was measurable and repeatable.
 In 1902, Italian physicist Guglielmo Marconi
sparked a signal from England across the
Atlantic to the shores of Newfoundland,
demonstrating the first long-range use of
radio waves as a form of communication. He
broadcast the letter S in Morse code. He
was trying to transmit SOS (with the classy
Italian accent that worked so well for Sophia
Loren) but left the folks in Newfoundland
hanging.
 During World War II, the British developed
the first RFID tagging system in order to
rapidly discriminate between their own
returning aircraft and squadrons of the
German Luftwaffe. British fighters were
equipped with tags that replied to an interro-
gation signal with a special “I am a friend”
code — routinely changed so that the enemy
could not use it. Snoopy should have had this
in his battles against the Red Baron.
 In the late 1960s, the need for security and
safety of nuclear materials drove further
development of RFID tagging, such as elec-
tronic article surveillance (EAS).
 In 1977, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories
(LASL) transferred the RFID technology that
had been developed in government labs to
the public sector. Commercial RFID appli-
cations beyond EAS began to appear in the
early 1980s: railroad freight car tagging, the
tagging of cattle and rare dog breeds, auto-
mobile immobilizers, keyless entry systems,
and automatic highway toll collection.
 As the 1980s drew to a close, the primary
focus in RFID commercialization shifted from
new applications to issues of performance
improvement and cost reduction, as well as
reader, tag, and antenna miniaturization. The
success is evident in the variety of RFID
applications and system components now
available in stores like Radio Shack.

Understanding everything that happens in the environment is critical to the
success of your RFID system; that’s why we spend all of Chapter 7 talking
about the site assessment. But knowing the root cause of problems will help
you fix issues that crop up during that assessment.
Your “new” experiences are grounded in history. Problems you are con-
fronting for the first time have likely been solved before. I always say it’s
great to learn from mistakes — as long as they are someone else’s.
Frequency is a measurement
Electromagnetic radiation may have begun when the quark and leptronic soup
became transparent to photons (the electromagnetic carrier particle), but the
ability to measure all that radiation arrived relatively recently in the 19th cen-
tury. Scientists like James Joule and James Maxwell were the first to figure out
that you can measure the invisible. The ability to quantify frequency began
with the advent of modern physics and the development of wave and particle
theories. It is the principles behind wave and particle theory that led to the use
of electronic and magnetic waves to communicate data.
Frequency is an important topic in the understanding of RFID. In Chapter 3, 
I introduce the three main types of frequency in RFID: low frequency (LF),
high frequency (HF), and ultrahigh frequency (UHF). As you begin to under-
stand the physics of RFID, you need to understand how frequency works as 
a measurement:
 Frequency is a measure of how many times an electromagnetic wave
goes from one crest to the next crest in a unit of time (such as a second)
as it moves through space.
 This movement from crest to crest (or trough to trough) is called a cycle.
Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz), which tells you how many cycles
per second occur in an electromagnetic wave.
When ultraviolet radiation burns our skin at the beach, X-rays take pictures of
broken bones, light glows from a neon sign outside your hotel window, or sig-
nals are sent to antenna arrays in RFID networks, different frequencies are at
work. All these sources belong to the family called the electromagnetic spec-
trum. As the name spectrum suggests, radio-frequency emissions form a series
starting at extremely low frequencies (such as your car radio), going through
the familiar visible wavelengths at higher frequencies, and finally to X-rays,
gamma rays, and cosmic rays at extremely high frequencies. For example, the
visible region of the spectrum is around 1014 Hz, and the UV rays that burn us
are at 1016 Hz. Cosmic rays are 1021 Hertz. RFID normally uses a portion of this
spectrum from 125 kHz (kilohertz) to 5.3 GHz (gigahertz).
83
Chapter 4: What Makes Up an RFID Network

History may repeat itself, but 
virginity comes only once
In 1902, when the Marconi team sent out the first transatlantic RF signal, that
sole signal had the world’s airwaves to itself. Lightning was the only possible
competition. Fortunately, the skies over the northern Atlantic were clear that
day, and long-range radio was born. That signal was received 1,500 miles
away because no competing RF signals were around to create interference.
In the late 1990s, when modern RF engineers from the Marconi Corporation
(named after the famed engineer) proposed a reenactment of the original
event, it turned out to be impossible due to RF crowding or noise. A small
signal discharged today is completely drowned in the vast sea of radio fre-
quency noise. The lesson here is that the human eye couldn’t detect a change
in the radio wave patterns in the last hundred years; the invisible noise is
what creates the biggest stumbling blocks to any radio system.
You need to be aware of all RF sources in and around your environment and
also of any other sources that might interfere with the RF transmission once
your network is operational. I show you how to check this in Chapter 7.
Fields: Electrical and magnetic, 
near and far
An electrical current gives rise to a surrounding magnetic field. A common
example of the effect of this field is the effect of a current on a compass
needle: The electrical current generates a magnetic field, which causes the
compass needle to align with the magnetic field. A magnetic field can also
generate an electrical current. This dual relationship between electrical and
magnetic fields is a basic and fundamental physical property.
The region close to the source of the electrical current, where the magnetic
or electrostatic forces can be detected, is called the induction field. Outside
the induction field is the radiation field. Depending on which type of fre-
quency your system uses (LF, HF, or UHF, which I introduce in Chapter 3),
either the induction field or the radiation field will power the tags:
 In LF and HF systems, the induction field has sufficient power to drive
an electromagnetic field in the tag so that the chip is activated. Outside
the induction field, the radiation field is too weak to do the same to
other chips. This means a reader won’t activate tags in neighboring LF
or HF systems.
84
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

If you’re interested in why the induction field can power the tag,
research the inverse square law.
Measuring the strength necessary to actually activate a tag in the induc-
tion field is how you focus your RFID system’s detection areas. This
detection distance in the induction field is called the near field.
 In UHF systems, the radiation field powers up the tag. This detection
distance is known as the far field. Because you’re working in the far field,
the antennas are shaped and work differently than antennas in LF and
HF systems (more on antennas in the next section).
Creating resonance between 
the antennas and the field
Antennas are made of conductive material and couple the RF waves for com-
munication purposes. Coupling is the matching of the tag and the reader so
that they can communicate effectively together at the same frequency. Every
piece of electrically conductive material has some degree of coupling with
radiation fields out in the real world. Only when the conductor is designed 
to provide high coupling efficiency between certain media is it called an
antenna.
A key feature of antenna design is the idea of a resonance frequency. Resonance
means that two things are moving in unison or in lock step. Ignoring for the
moment the underlying mathematics and physics of this event, you can easily
demonstrate how resonance works. Fill a long, low basin with water. If you put
your hand into the water and, with large strokes, move it back and forth, the
water becomes turbulent and you splash water out of the basin. But, if you
gradually change the length and frequency of your strokes, you will eventually
find a rate at which the entire body of water moves in unison with your hand.
This is the resonance frequency. Your hand has matched the resonance fre-
quency of the water in a basin of those particular dimensions.
Antennas work the same way. They need to match the frequency of the incom-
ing field in order to set up a resonance between the antenna and the field.
Resonance is based on a multiple of the wavelengths; thus you will notice that
tags (which are tiny transceivers with their own antennas) have a size that is
generally proportional to the size of the reader’s antenna.
The shape of the antenna is also matched to the frequency it is intended 
to interact with. Thus LF and HF tags are shaped like coils, which resonate
better in the near field, and UHF tags have a flatter shape, which works better
in the far field. The simplest antenna design of this nature is an antenna
called a half-wave dipole antenna (a good term to remember for cocktail par-
ties when someone asks you about RFID). Essentially, the idea is to match
half of the wavelength (half wave) with the resonant frequency, and it will
receive a stronger signal.
85
Chapter 4: What Makes Up an RFID Network

It makes sense to relate the physical concepts of resonance to some practical
RFID issues:
 When a tag antenna is immersed in the field of a reader antenna (in
which both antennas are tuned to couple at the same frequency), the tag
absorbs the radio frequency energy at a particular wavelength — the
wavelength that makes it move at the same rate as the reader antenna.
This is how resonance works in an RFID system.
 The UHF antenna design is proportional to about the wavelength of the
signal. Knowing the wavelength of UHF systems (about 33 cm) is impor-
tant when designing your RFID system because anything conductive that
is about that length can act as an antenna and cause problems with your
system. Tags that are some multiple of that wavelength will also receive
a better signal.
ODIN technologies’ top engineer was doing a site assessment at a company
that made cable racks for data centers, among other products. The engineer
was trying to figure out why all the RF from a signal generator was going hay-
wire in a particular part of the warehouse. After looking around, he noticed
that the metal ladder racks for cabling were made with a bunch of 1-x-1-foot
sections. He realized that 1 foot is about 33 centimeters, which is a perfect
wavelength for UHF. The ladder racks were absorbing all the RF signals
intended for RFID tags and needed to be relocated to make the system work
properly.

f you want to know a thing or two about setting up a great RFID system,
take a look at Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes of all time.
What does Lance have to do with RFID? Well, you can make even the simplest
and most well-proven systems better by paying painstaking attention to the
minutest details. You also need to understand every component that makes
up the entire system. The simple system in Lance’s case is a bicycle. If you
add a little oil to a rusty chain, an old neglected bicycle can take you around
the neighborhood or through the countryside in far less time than you can
walk. Lance’s team in the Tour de France, by contrast, has spent countless
hours understanding the effects of wind, speed, tire pressure, clothing, and
so on, using that knowledge to fine-tune their clothing and bicycles so they
don’t lose a second to the competition. Sure, the cyclists look ridiculous in
their pointy helmets, but their efforts do illustrate the benefit of understand-
ing every component of a system, how the system functions, and the effect
that the system can have on overall performance.
In this chapter, you come one step closer to crafting the Tour de France bicy-
cle of RFID. I walk you through the basics of RFID tags and readers, talk to
you about different aspects of design and performance, and show how they
interoperate. After you understand the technology, I take you through a crash
course in understanding the protocols that allow tags to communicate with
readers.
With a more in-depth understanding of the individual subcomponents of an
RFID system, you’ll be much better able to create a high-performing, efficient
RFID network. If you understand how the system works on the basic level,

you can begin to investigate specific ways of doing things in your environ-
ment, and begin to influence what technology, protocols, and standards you
wish to support.
Anatomy of a Passive Tag:
Understanding How It Works 
and Choosing the Right One
All the buzz is about passive tags. Thanks to the work of the Auto-ID Lab 
at MIT, passive RFID tags have become cheaper, smaller, and globally inter-
operable (for the most part). See Chapter 21 for more info on the standards.
Although your RFID applications might require active or semi-passive tags
(Chapter 2 can help you determine which type you need), the innovations in
passive tags drive the Wal-Mart and Department of Defense (DoD) mandates,
and this is the tag that you’re likely to use.
Although a tag seems quite simple, like a bicycle — it’s just a couple of wheels
and gears and a frame, right? — the engineering and innovation surrounding a
tag can make all the difference in the world. Understanding how tags work and
some of the basics behind tag design will help you to understand the potential
applications and types of passive tags that you might want to investigate. The
two parts of a tag that have the greatest fundamental impact on its perfor-
mance are the tag antenna and the integrated circuit (IC, or chip). In this sec-
tion, I explain how these two components are responsible for extracting,
efficiently consuming, and reflecting RF power.
As you consider how the different tag designs work and which design will
work best for you, think about where you might put the tag on your object,
case, or item as well as how the tag might be attached to the item in the man-
ufacturing, assembly, or packaging processes. Having an idea where the tag
will be enables you to choose the optimal tag design — that is, one that
enables you to get accurate reads. In Chapter 9, I explain how you place tags
and test them in a real-world environment, but for now, it’s helpful to keep
tag placement in the back of your mind.
How do tags receive and 
transmit information?
Think of an RFID tag as a very simple, very small two-way radio. Depending
on the type of tag, its role is to receive a signal, power up an onboard chip
88
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

(with data embedded on it), and then broadcast that information. It is a
simple yet elegant bit of science at work right under your eyes. Well-known
laws of physics govern the tag behavior, like they govern the behavior of a
bicycle balanced on two wheels.
A passive tag consists of three components that enable it to receive and
transmit signals in its ultra-efficient way:
 An integrated circuit or chip: This chip stores data and executes spe-
cific commands. Most of the passive tags today carry 96 bits of memory,
although some can carry as little as 2 bits or as much as 1,000 bits. The
chip design determines whether the tag has read-only or read-write
properties. Three or four manufacturers, including Phillips, Texas
Instruments, Fairchild, and ST Micro, are the primary makers of these
chips. Most tag manufacturers purchase their IC chips from these pri-
mary sources, so you have little chance of getting a cost advantage in
chip purchase.
 An antenna (or coupling element): The antenna’s function is to absorb RF
waves and then broadcast a signal back out. The antenna powers up the
tag by collecting the energy from the RF field and exciting the onboard
chip into action. This process is called coupling because the tag antenna
must “couple” with the electromagnetic fields that the RFID reader emits.
In more technical terms, coupling describes the extent to which power is
transferred from one system component to another — in this case, from
air to the antenna.
The size of the antenna is critical to the performance of the tag because
the antenna’s size usually determines a tag’s read range. Simply put, a
bigger antenna can collect more energy and therefore broadcast more
energy back out. You can usually determine the size of a tag’s antenna
by looking at the tag: the bigger the tag, the bigger the antenna. You
might see antennas (and therefore tags) that are the size of a dime and
others that are the size of a business envelope.
Another characteristic of antennas that enable them to send and receive
signals is the antenna’s shape: Low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency
(HF) antennas tend to be coils because these frequencies are predomi-
nantly magnetic in nature. Ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) designs tend to
look like radio or old-style television antennas because UHF frequencies
are more purely electric in nature.
Later in this chapter, I explain how tag antennas work and how different
engineering designs can improve antenna performance in various RFID
applications.
 The substrate (or material that holds it all together): This is most often
a Mylar or plastic film. Both the antenna and chip are attached to it.

Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System

How does a tag antenna work, and how do
you choose among the different kinds?
Tag antennas come in all shapes and sizes, and the antenna design changes
things dramatically. A wide variety of antenna designs has been proposed in
attempts to maximize the performance of the tag on a wide variety of materials.
The fundamental problem of RFID is transmitting adequate power to RFID
tags. The transmitting power is considered adequate when a tag can effi-
ciently consume, use, and reflect RF power when attached to a case or pallet
(usually this requires –10 db of power). Understanding how different tag
antennas work — and especially how they reflect power back (a process
called backscatter) — helps you make the right selection and ultimately leads
to optimal performance.
For an RF wave to properly power up a passive tag, the electrical current
coming out of an RFID reader has to hit the conducting plane (the antenna)
orthogonally — that is, at right angles. This simple law of physics, known as
Gauss’s Law, states that electric flux creates a charge and that an electric field
cannot just go past a conductor — it must turn and meet it at right angles. So
what does this mean to practical design application? Here are some points to
keep in mind:

Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 
Innovations that might save you money
Passive tags made widespread adoption of
RFID affordable, and innovations in engineering
and production processes will help make tags
even cheaper.
Conductive ink is an area of antenna innovation
that promises to drive down the costs of RFID
tags significantly. Conductive ink is essentially
ink with properties that are amenable to RF cou-
pling (connecting the broadcasting signal to the
receiving tag in an optimal manner). The benefit
of using conductive ink to make the antenna
covers both material costs and engineering
costs. Most traditional metallic antennas are
made by taking a solid piece of metal, often
copper, and removing material to get to the
desired shape. Obviously, this wastes a lot of
good copper or aluminum. Conductive ink, on the
other hand, uses various printing technologies
similar to inkjet printers that add only the amount
of antenna material needed, making it much
more efficient.
Another area for innovation and cost savings is
the substrate that holds tags together. Many
people tend to overlook the significant expense
of traditional chip adhesive and assembly
processes. Historically, chips have been attached
by using a flip-chip (flipping a chip into place and
gluing it to an antenna) assembly process, which
is not only costly (when you’re talking about frac-
tions of a penny for components) but also slow.
Two unique innovations in the tag manufacturing
process have been Alien Technology’s Fluidic
Self-Assembly (FSA) and Matrics/Symbols
Parallel Integrated Chip Assembly (PICA). Both
hold promise to dramatically reduce production
cost and speed up capacity.

 Antennas that have many different angles are designed to couple with
an RF wave at any opportunity. That’s why some of the antennas have
many turns and wings shooting off the center. These antennas, which
are called orientation-insensitive, are better for reading a tag as it passes
through a dock door or doorway, for instance.
 The long, straight tags, on the other hand, are designed to perform
very well on flat, directionally sensitive applications or with a circu-
larly polarized antenna. You can use these to good effect on cases going
down a conveyor belt. The tag reader signal comes from a constant, pre-
determined direction. Thus, with a little planning, the readers can hit the
sweet spot with a whole lot of antenna area.
 The straighter the tag antenna, the greater the size of the conductive
plane (or coupling element); the greater the conductive plane, the
better the tag performance. If the tag’s antenna is curved in many direc-
tions, only part of the tag is ever orthogonal to the RF wave, so only part
of the antenna is used. If the tag has a straight antenna and the antenna
is in proper orientation, the entire surface becomes used in power and
communication. That means the tag has a greater read distance and is
more likely to receive the power needed for accurate reads.
With the proper understanding of tag antenna physics under your belt, you
can ask the following questions to determine whether a given tag antenna
design is right for you:
 What are the coupling characteristics of the antenna? All tag antennas
have a capacitive element (a plate to store magnetic energy) and an
inductive element (the coil to store electric energy), which make up the
impedance (how easily current can flow through a system, measured in
ohms) of the antenna.
Some tags are tuned: Just as a tuning fork is tuned to a particular key, an
antenna can be tuned to a particular frequency specifically to work best
when affixed to cases of product consisting of metals, liquids, or other
specific materials. The length of the antenna determines the tuning, as
shown in Figure 5-1.

Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System

Others tags actually use the product as the antenna. For example, sev-
eral manufacturers are designing tags that couple with a DVD, using it as
the antenna.
 What is the orientation sensitivity of the antenna? As I mention earlier
in this section, some antennas read from many different directions, and
others read from just one.
Some tag designs effectively incorporate multiple antennas, each of
which is polarized in a different direction but in the same plane. This
allows you to put antennas on in multiple directions and still get good
reads as opposed to affixing them in a specific orientation to be oriented
specifically to a reader’s antenna. Another innovative idea in tags is to
actually put two antennas on a chip, which is often called a dual-dipole
tag. This idea gives you twice the orientation sensitivity because the tag
antennas are usually mounted at right angles to each other on the tag.
 How does the tag fit on the product? Some tags achieve superior range
and orientation insensitivity at the expense of small form factor. If these
tags do not fit in the space allocated for labeling purposes, they should
be eliminated from stock-keeping unit (SKU) testing (which I discuss in
Chapter 9). In other words, some tags might work great for a particular
type of product, but if they don’t fit on the product, they’re not the right
tags.
How does the integrated circuit 
affect performance?
Most tags are identified primarily by their antenna shape, but a microscopic
integrated circuit has a far greater impact on overall tag performance. The IC,
or simply the chip, is responsible for converting RF energy into usable electri-
cal power, storing and retrieving data, and modulating the backscatter signal
(the signal that the tag sends back to the reader). Tag parameters related to
power extraction, consumption, and reflection include
 The amount of memory on the chip: Because low cost is the ultimate
design priority of the electronic product code (EPC) industry, memory
storage levels are kept to a bare minimum (96 bits on average). Rather
than store all the data about an item in the tag’s chip, the EPC uses a
serialized numbering system to point toward additional information
about each item, which is stored on a secure database. As such, the
power required for encoding and reading EPC tags is kept to a minimum,
on the order of 100 micro-watts (1 × 10E–6 W) or –10 dBm. See Chapter 2
for more details on how the EPC works.
 The efficiency of the power circuitry: The IC receives energy from the
tag antenna in the form of an oscillating current at the frequency of the
reader transmission. This current must be down-converted and rectified
by using circuitry tuned to a specific frequency. The precision of these
92
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

components and how well they are matched determine power conver-
sion efficiency. Some newer chips from companies like Impinj are being
designed to operate more efficiently and thus use lower power than tra-
ditional chip design, which would mean that your readers could have
lower power output and less interference with each other.
 The impedance match of the chip and the antenna: If an impedance
mismatch exists between the chip and the tag antenna, power is
reflected away from the chip and thus unavailable for use by the tag.
This is the case with some poorly manufactured tags. Unfortunately, the
only way to find out this for sure is to use an expensive piece of test
equipment called a network analyzer. The better way to avoid this is to
find historical data about tag quality by looking at commercially avail-
able benchmark studies.
 The ability of the chip to alter the impedance of its antenna: Tags send
a signal back to the antenna by using a technology called backscatter.
That backscatter can also modulate (change the signal) as the chip alters
the impedance of the tag antenna (changes the ability of current to flow
through it) at specific time intervals (pulse-width modulation). Think of
this as taking a garden hose and squeezing it at a specific interval to see
how the water changes coming out. The chip’s ability to change the
impedance precisely and in sync with the reader determines signal clar-
ity and strength.
 How tags must respond in collision-free channels: When multiple tags
pass through the RFID reader’s field simultaneously, they must talk in
turn to prevent data collision at the receiver. EPC tags support one of
two algorithms used to accomplish this task: tree walking and ALOHA
slot. The anticollision protocol determines performance, although the
emerging standards will likely set the protocol to be an ALOHA slot. This
means that if you want the slightly better performance of a tree walking
protocol, you need to use a proprietary system.
93
Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System
The mu-chip takes over the world (when cows fly)
Recently, Hitachi, Ltd., introduced the mu-chip,
an RFID chip and antenna on an IC board about
the size of a pinhead. The press had a field day
with the release of the product, saying that it
would now be possible to clandestinely track
everything all the time.
If you understand the relationship between
antenna size and tag performance, you know
the physics of RF communication make this
Orwellian scenario impossible. The maximum
read range of the mu-chip is just a few millime-
ters because the limited surface area of the
antenna limits the chip’s power and therefore its
ability to transmit data off the chip. The chip will
have great utility for anti-counterfeit purposes
in everything from money to concert tickets, but
like the other laws of physics, you can’t violate
the principles of antenna size no matter how
felonious you might be feeling.

Each IC manufacturer has a proprietary chip design that employs a unique
manufacturing process. The ability of the manufacturer to optimize each of
these parameters will determine in large part how well the tag performs.
Some tag examples for the geek in you
Tag antenna designs are a combination of art and science. Many tag antennas
are designed with sophisticated computer modeling programs, and others
are designed by engineers, using known shapes and patterns from other
applications. You can see how the tag designs vary in Figure 5-2.
Some of the more popular passive tags being used in the Wal-Mart and DoD
deployments include the following:
 Alien “I2” tag: The Alien “I2” tag has an advantage over other tags in
that its length approaches half a wavelength (approximately six inches)
at 915 MHz — the ideal length of a dipole antenna. It exhibits a very high
level of performance, particularly when mounted parallel to an antenna’s
field. Dimensions: 6.0 x 0.65 inches
 Alien “Squiggle” tag: This tag “squiggles” in two dimensions to gain vir-
tual antenna length, making the orientation and length of the antenna
element optimized while keeping the tag compact. Thus, if the tag is not
in the perfect orientation, it still has the chance to couple with the
broadcasting antenna. Dimensions: 3.8 x 0.6 inches
Figure 5-2:
Various tag
designs.
94
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

 Avery Dennison Strip tag: The Avery Dennison Strip tag is unique in
that it is nearly all metal, like a normal transmitter antenna dipole, which
allows it to have a more conductive surface and absorb more energy.
Dimensions: 3.75 x 0.45 inches
 Rafsec Folded Dipole CCT tag: The Rafsec tag is unique because it is a
folded dipole. The current for the antenna is strongest at the midpoint of
the antenna; accordingly, the strongest radiation occurs at the center 
of the antenna substrate, along the upper strip. This offers good long-
distance read range. Dimensions: 4.0 x 0.5 inches
These four tags illustrate just a few of the possibilities out there. In fact, several
dozen different tag types are available from manufacturers like Alien, Symbol,
OMRON, Rafsec, Avery Dennison, Texas Instruments, and others. If, as you
investigate and test tags, you don’t find a tag that works for you, consider com-
panies that do custom tag design (using anything from advanced fractal mathe-
matics and sophisticated programs to geometric shapes from an artist’s mind).
Tracking the Tags with a Reader
Before you decide to quit your day job and open up a tag design boutique,
you’d better add reader functionality to your list of growing knowledge. No
matter how sophisticated a tag is, it’s worthless without a reader. A reader 
is an information tollbooth on the highway to efficient supply chains, accu-
rate inventories, and perfect asset management. That is, readers collect the
important information from the tags as the tags pass through the supply
chain applications so you can make useful business decisions based on real-
time information, like when to order more stock.
Understanding how readers work will help you understand the system better
and ground your knowledge for assessing the various types of readers.
Holler back, young ’un — Transmitting
and receiving signals
An RFID reader is a sophisticated radio. To illustrate how a reader works, the
following steps walk you through the life cycle of a read:
1. The energy to transmit the radio wave comes from an external power
source like a battery or a wall outlet.
2. Inside the reader, a digital signal processor (DSP) chip and a regular
processor control the flow of electricity in a very specific manner, 
modulating the frequency and the amplitude of the wave that the reader
generates.
95
Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System

I explain how this works in more detail in a moment.
3. That flow of electricity goes to an antenna via a coax cable. How the
electricity gets to that antenna is controlled by the complex circuitry
anchored by the DSP.
4. The antenna sends out an RF wave carrying data by using a process
called modulation.
Modulation is essentially the introduction of very small variations in the
electrical signal. An easy way to picture this is by imagining the old Civil
War signalmen who flashed light signals back and forth from ship to ship
or from ship to shore. That was wave modulation, but they were modu-
lating light waves. Of course, a sophisticated RFID unit uses a much
more complex mechanism in which the frequency and/or amplitude of
the transmitted wave are varied in the slightest manner to encode a
great deal of information. Whereas the Civil War signalmen transmitted
dots and dashes to remind someone to bring more rum back to the boat,
the reader’s RF signal transmits 0s and 1s that an application turns into
information about that item.
5. After the reader antenna receives the signal back from a tag, the reader
carries the signal back down to the electronics.
6. The electronics then make sense of the subtle differences in the waves
and decode it to create useful information. (Note that this is different
from the filtering and smoothing that middleware does on the data or
EPC numbers received; see Chapter 11 for more on middleware.)
Transmitting antennas are represented by the abbreviation Tx, and receiving
antennas are represented you guessed it — Rx. In many cases, they are the
same antenna; however, on some readers, you might see a spot to plug in a
Tx antenna and another one to plug in an Rx antenna. The Tx antenna is the
one broadcasting a powerful signal, and the Rx is the one listening for the
much weaker signal from the tag. If the Tx and Rx antennas are separate, you
always want the Rx signal as close to the tag as possible.
The DSP chip: Examining 
the brain of a reader
As I mention earlier in this chapter, the digital signal processor (DSP chip)
controls the electricity that flows through a reader. Specifically, it applies 
an alternating voltage (for example, the modulated carrier wave carrying 
the information) to a transmitting antenna. This process of producing a cur-
rent that moves back and forth (oscillates) is more complex than it sounds
96
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

because the number of oscillations over a period of time determines the
information on those waves. All this oscillation and frequency generation
requires the DSP to do a lot of sophisticated math.
In addition to the DSP, every RFID reader has a fairly standard onboard
processor to do simple calculation and run the operating system. Figure 5-3
shows the inside of an RFID reader and points out the DSP and the primary
processor. As you compare various readers and their technology, you’ll want
to know who makes their DSP and main processors, particularly because
many people are going to rush to order RFID readers as they are required 
to. This immediate order will cause production strains on boutique makers 
of chips, whereas companies like Texas Instruments and Intel are more likely
to be able to handle huge production volumes.
The DSP, the heart of any RFID reader, has four specific properties:
 Mathematical whiz chip: The DSP chip is first and foremost a calculator
on steroids — the basic design leverages arithmetic logic units and one
or more multipliers in their primary function. These processing units are
designed to be extremely fast and to execute, in a single clock cycle (one
unit of time for a computers processor to run), the full extent of their
mathematical operations.
 Super-efficient memory: Programming on DSP chips needs to be highly
efficient because there is such a limited amount of memory. The average
DSP chip holds anywhere from 8 kilobytes to 256 kilobytes. To put it in
perspective, this chapter is about 60 kilobytes as a Word file (with no
graphics).
 The ability to move data in and out in real time: A DSP chip is the ulti-
mate inventory management device — it gets data in and data back out
in a real-time continuous stream. It has to, or else a gap in the communi-
cation occurs because radio waves can’t be stored in a cache anywhere.
A lot of folks bandy about the term real-time when they actually mean
near real-time. But in DSP processing, it does actually happen in real-
time as a stream of constant processing of the electronic signals.
 Low power requirements: The DSP chip is like the Toyota Prius of the
processor world, and the Pentium IV is like a Hummer. DSP chips use
only a fraction of the power of a normal processor, even at full speed.
Because they use less electricity to run, they also produce less heat. The
Pentium IV processor, on the other hand, has incredible performance
but uses up a lot of fuel to get that strong performance.
DSP chips are not just in RFID readers. They are the key to every electronic
device that requires a lot of heavy lifting in the math department — from cel-
lular telephones to MP3 players to digital cameras.

Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System

Ring around the dipole and other bad
antenna stories
An RFID reader uses one of several basic types of antenna. As with any radio
transmitter and receiver, the antenna is the ears and mouth of the system. It
both “talks” (transmitter) and “listens” (receiver). For an RFID reader, you
need an antenna with the following properties:
 Highest directivity: The antenna property of directivity is the guiding
parameter for point-to-point communication, as opposed to broadcast
communication. For example, compare a broadcasting application like
FM radio with a wireless data network. In FM radio, the more people
who can hear your station the better, so your goal is to spread your
transmitter signal in all directions as far as it will go. But in a wireless
data network that connects two buildings, you want the signal to radiate
in a preferred direction so that not many antennas can receive the data.
In the case of RFID, you want your transmitted signal and your received
signal to be confined to a specific area, not broadcast into other RFID
zones or systems.
Receiving signals from another RFID interrogation zone creates what are
called phantom reads or ghost reads. Many people setting up systems via
trial and error end up experiencing phantom read problems.

Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

 Best gain: Gain is a measure of how much better (or worse) an antenna
can transmit its signal over some known baseline reference. To help
visualize this, an FM radio station wants its transmitting signal to be
spread out in a full circle so that more people can hear it. The wireless
data network administrators, on the other hand, want the transmitted
signal to prefer one point to another. If you add all the energy in the
circle and then take that energy and fit it into a highly directive antenna,
the signal strength will be concentrated. In this case, the signal strength
is much stronger at some reference point for the highly directive
antenna than for the broadcast circle antenna. In RFID, you want the
transmitted signal to be concentrated at the tag so that the tag will wake
up quickly and backscatter a strong signal to the reader. On the receiver
side of things, you want your receiver to be able to hear the smallest
possible backscattered signal.
 Circular polarization: Polarization for an antenna is simply the orienta-
tion that the electromagnetic wave radiates from the antenna. The two
basic types of polarization are linear and circular. In the simplest of
terms, if your antenna is a dipole (or “stick”), it broadcasts out in a line
that generates from that stick. With circular polarization, the radiating
signal spins.
In any radio communication system, you need to have the receiving and
transmitting antennas in the same orientation for maximum signal trans-
fer from transmitter to receiver. In this way, the talker is loud, and the
listener hears most efficiently.
With RFID and polarization in mind, you must look at the two radio links
involved. The reader serves as the transmitter for the forward link (reader-
to-tag) and also as the receiver for the back link (tag-to-reader). In a similar
manner, the tag also operates as both a transmitter and receiver. For the
most efficient communication between tag and reader, the orientation (or
polarization) of the tag antenna and the reader antenna needs to be the same.
If the orientation of your tags will be random, you can’t use a linearly polar-
ized antenna without losing read efficiency. For this application, an antenna
with a circular polarization works best. When the tag is in any circular orien-
tation with respect to the reader antenna, the reader will “hear” the tag well.
Other antenna parameters, such as radiation efficiency (the ability of the
antenna to “push” a signal into the air) and driving point impedance, must
also be known in order to design a transmitter that operates most effectively
with the antenna. However, these parameters are usually fixed by the manu-
facturer to the radio industry standards. I won’t clutter your head with an
explanation that would be of no use. It suffices to say that commercially avail-
able antennas are designed correctly.

Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System

Air in Her Face — Blowing 
Sweet Nothings
That’s air interface, not air in her face! The air interface (or Physical layer for
you networking types) is the protocol that dictates how the readers and tags
talk to each other and how the data keeps from colliding. The air interface
protocol is the Cap’n Crunch decoder ring of the RFID world. A reader has a
very specific way in which it encodes data by modulation, and this is the
secret of the air interface. Without knowing how the information from the
reader is encoded, the tag can’t communicate with it.
Although RFID received much notoriety in the early part of this century, it
wasn’t until a well-accepted air interface protocol was designed that people
began making significant investments in the technology. The air interface pro-
tocol (remember this because it’s great cocktail party banter) that was finally
chosen, after a year of deliberation, was the modified ALOHA slot protocol.
This is what you need to make sure that your tags employ if you want to be
compliant with EPC Generation 2.0 protocols.
100
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 
Air interface technology
Here’s a more detailed explanation of how anti-
collision works within air interface technology:
Space Domains
In space-domain methods, tags are placed in
specific locations to achieve isolation. Tags in
space-domain methods are identified by variation
of reader range (variation of power is transferred
to passive tags) and/or by using directional
antennas. RFID using only space-domain meth-
ods drastically hinders the effectiveness of the
technology. Space-domain methods rely on the
number of tags in a reader’s range — if too many
tags are in the area, collision results and reduces
the reader’s ability to interpret any signals.
Frequency Domains
Frequency-domain anticollision methods allow
for robust wireless communications but can add
excessive complexity and cost to an RFID system.
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) sys-
tems divide the total available bandwidth into
fixed-width channels. FDMA is costly because it
requires accurate frequency sources and band-
pass filters. Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) systems have many advantages over
FDMA systems. CDMA offers better adaptability
to varying traffic load, increased capacity to read
tags, and processing gain. CDMA and other
spread spectrum (SS) methods are currently dif-
ficult and costly to implement for RFID systems
but are popular in cellular telephony.
Time Domains
Most RFID anticollision methods are time-
domain. In these methods, fractional communi-
cations from tags are varied in time. Time-domain
methods can be classified into synchronous and
asynchronous schemes.
 Synchronous schemes are those in which a
reader transmits a query to a specific tag by
using its UID (unique ID) number. This is an
effective anticollision method because tags

101
Chapter 5: Understanding How Techology Becomes a Working System
do not have to take turns communicating to
the reader, and tags do not have to rely on a
complete “uncollided” transmission to be
identified. A reader can poll through a list of
tags, but the polling method, also known as
tree walking or binary tree, is relatively time-
consuming and depends on the tag’s UID
number being known. Binary tree searches
use binary code (groups of 0s and 1s) for
communication and basically involve the
reader actively sending a signal of a 1 or 0 to
a tag. If the reader sends the correct number,
the tag acknowledges it by transmitting the
signal back to the reader. If the reader sends
the wrong signal, the tag mutes itself and
awaits another signal. Eventually, the com-
puter deciphers the code of the tag. Symbol
Class 0 tags use this anticollision algorithm,
and ODIN technologies lab research has
shown it to be an effective method for inter-
rogating multiple tags quickly.
 Asynchronous schemes are those in which
tags in the reader’s field respond at randomly
generated times. This helps to reduce the
chance of collisions. The ALOHA scheme is
asynchronous and involves a node transmit-
ting a data packet after receiving a data
packet. If a collision occurs, a node becomes
saturated and transmits the packet again
after a random delay. The reader transmits
continuously until a collision does not occur.
A slotted ALOHA transmission is performed
in slotted times by making small restrictions
in the transmission freedom of individual data
packets. When packets collide under slotted
ALOHA protocol, they overlap completely
instead of partially, and this significantly
increases the efficiency of data transfer.
ALOHA is more easily understood by using an
analogy. For the purposes of the analogy, imagine
50 tags in an interrogation zone. Then imagine 50
railway stations as tags, a railroad car as a tag’s
transmission, and two tunnels that represent the
antenna/reader. A train gets loaded with supplies
at its respective station (which is representative
of the data being delivered). After supplies are
delivered through the tunnel, they are no longer
needed, and thus the next train does not need to
leave the station. One tunnel (the reader output
tunnel) has trains coming out on one track, one
behind the other, at constant speeds (this repre-
sents the electromagnetic waves being emitted
by the antenna). At the 50 stations, the trains stop
simultaneously, pick up their supplies (which
takes a random amount of time, analogous to the
random delay of ALOHA protocol), and take off for
the next tunnel. The tracks all converge at that
next tunnel, however, and the trains cannot touch
each other while merging, or the “collision” will
destroy them. Thus, no supplies will reach the
other side (no data will be transferred to the
reader). Trains will continue to leave stations until
the supplies are delivered, and the station, receiv-
ing word from the “antenna/reader” tunnel, shuts
down (representing a tag shutting off, or muting
itself). The trains are long, and even though they
move extremely fast, they sometimes overlap by
random distances. The more trains there are leav-
ing at random times, the more chance for collision.
This is representative of pure ALOHA protocol.
In slotted ALOHA protocol, trains are allowed to
leave only at certain times (slots). Imagine that
the stations have stoplights, and that they all
turn green and red at intervals just long enough
to prevent partial train collision. If a train is
ready to go at green, it goes; but if it is not, it
must wait for the next light. This ensures that if
two trains (signals) go at the same time, they
completely collide. If they overlapped (as they
do with pure ALOHA), the lagging train would
still have the ability to collide with a train behind
it. Now imagine that the stoplight flickers on and
off multiple times per second, and that the trains
instantly accelerate to light speed. It might be
easier to see how slotted ALOHA is superior to
pure ALOHA. As stated before, after the train
has delivered its supplies, it sends a signal so
that no train leaves its respective station, thus
ensuring a smaller chance of collision. The
newest EPC protocol, EPC Gen 2.0, is a slotted
ALOHA protocol.

ready to think about where you might be able to put RFID to use and how it
can improve your business operations.
This chapter introduces you to some basic applications of the technology,
both the ones you’ve heard of time and time again — like dock doors and
conveyors — and others that you might not ever have thought of — like
smart shelves. Understanding the basic applications of the technology is
important if you are going to plan for and design your RFID system effec-
tively. You find out ways in which other people have applied RFID technology
to their businesses so that you might be able to think of applications in your
own environment.
Setting Up RFID Interrogation Zones
The RFID interrogation zone is where it all happens. It’s the “bubble” created
by a reader and antennas that allows a tag to be read and then that informa-
tion to be automatically collected and sent back to an enterprise application
like a warehouse management system or enterprise resource planning appli-
cation. The interrogation zones are set up in fairly common areas that are
generally choke points: that is, areas where all items have to flow through. A
choke point can be something as big as a tollbooth on a highway or as small
as a machine to dispense individual pills. Both of these applications use RFID
for automatic data collection and counting.

Coming and going — Reading 
at a dock door
The dock door application of RFID is probably one of the best-known and
most publicized uses of the technology. An interrogation zone (where tags are
read) can be easily set around a dock door and, with very high accuracy, read
a pallet tag. Figure 6-1 shows a common dock door setup. In many instances,
with a properly tuned system, that same dock door portal can read every
case on a pallet as it crosses the dock door.
What you need for an ideal dock door setup
The dock door deployment works best with the following elements:
 A high-powered UHF system because it gives good long-range read
capability for the cost of the system.
 Ample power to the antennas in the interrogation zone without being
so strong that it crosses over into adjacent dock doors two and three
bays down.
 A reader set to constantly poll, or look for, tags so that if something
comes through the interrogation zone quickly, you maximize your
chances of getting a response from the tag. It might take two or three
tries to get a successful response, so you want to poll often enough to
have at least a couple of attempts.

Setting up a dock door portal
You can deploy a dock door portal in many different ways. Here are the gen-
eral steps that you follow:
1. Decide on the area to be covered and the number of antennas to use.
Most of the UHF RFID portals used for dock door deployments have a
total of four antennas, two on each side of the door. Sometimes they
might have as many as eight antennas if the goal is to read every case on
the pallet or perhaps to cover a larger area.
2. Determine where to place the antennas.
Some dock doors require you to place an antenna overhead as well as on
both sides to get adequate coverage and penetration into the cases.
However, this setup is more problematic because every overhead
antenna installation will be custom as opposed to using a prefabricated
reader rack.
If you can manage to keep portals just on the sides of the doors, many
companies, such as Symbol Technologies (www.symbol.com), Venture
Research, Inc. (www.ventureresearch.com), ODIN technologies (www.
odintechnologies.com), and others make prefab rugged racks for the
side of dock doors. These racks usually have an easy way of mounting
antennas, protection to keep the hardware from being bumped into, a
secure place to house the reader, and somewhere to mount lights or
motion detectors. Having racks to set up and deploy in a very standard
way can allow someone to set up readers and antennas in 10 or 15 min-
utes for each dock door instead of several hours.
3. Install the antennas and make sure that they’re canted (angled)
slightly outward (pointing into the back of the truck) to help eliminate
cross talk among readers at adjacent dock doors.
4. Perform a thorough path loss contour mapping (PLCM), as detailed in
Chapter 7, to help create the correct configuration and setup and to
make sure that the power and configuration settings are optimized to
read everything at that dock door, and only that dock door.
Although reading all the cases on a pallet is one of the biggest benefits from a
business process perspective, this poses the biggest challenge in a dock door
portal setup. To maximize your chances of reading everything on the pallet
(instead of just the pallet tag), optimize the cases for the right tag and the
right placement. Optimized cases improve your performance not only on
individual items, but also on your full pallet amounts. Chapter 9 walks you
through the specifics of finding the right tag, placement, and orientation for
your products.

Your gateway to good reads — 
Other portals
The idea of a portal setup goes beyond just using readers at a dock door.
Anywhere there is a choke point (or an area where everything must flow
through) in a warehouse, building, highway, or process, there is a candidate
for a portal. Some useful portal applications include
 Doorway portals: The doorway portal is quite useful for item-level
tracking. A doorway portal can be deployed for everything from asset
management (tracking the coming and going of property) to security and
personnel access (making sure things that go out a doorway are sup-
posed to go out a doorway). Very primitive forms of RFID have been
used for decades in keeping store inventory safe. The tags used by com-
panies like Sensormatic or Checkpoint in those applications are chipless
and have only two bits of information: One represents store property
and sets off the alarm, and the other represents purchased property and
allows the person to walk through the doorway portal without setting off
the alarm.
 Security portals: The Federal Government is always looking for ways to
add security to Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs).
RFID can easily be a covert way to track laptops, hard drives, and even
handheld devices as they enter or exit these secure facilities. Other facil-
ities, like hospitals, track assets around the facilities by using active
RFID tags. Hospitals use active RFID (or RFID-like) systems based on 
Wi-Fi because they already have many devices that operate in the UHF
band. Most active systems operate at 433 MHz.
 Luggage portals: Figure 6-2 shows a luggage portal from the Hong Kong
airport, a very successful use of Matrics/Symbol readers to track luggage.
The setup of the portal is the same as a dock door portal with an over-
head component. The antennas on all three sides contain a transmitting
(Tx) and a receiving (Rx) element. The proper tuning of this system has
enabled a nearly 100 percent read of all luggage through the portal. In
fact, the tag designed specifically for this application has proven to be a
great performer in many instances. See Chapter 5 for more on tuning and
other details about how reader antennas work.
 Car or bus portals: If you live in a city with designated commuter lanes
or secure access to major airports, they are most likely controlled by
RFID systems. Buses on a tollroad or commuter lanes can often access
special lanes by driving under a portal and having a gate automatically
open after the RFID tag on the bus is read. Secure patrol cars in airports
will sometimes have tags mounted underneath the car and be read by a
reader in the pavement in front of a secure entrance.

The idea behind these portal applications is essentially the same as the dock
door portal, but the configuration of the readers is usually slightly different
because other portal applications are usually smaller than a ten-foot-wide
dock door.
A common mistake is over-designing the system — namely, adding more
antennas and extra readers. If you use more readers, tags, or power than you
need, the different systems interfere with each other when you put portals
side by side in a full RFID network. It takes only 100 microwatts or –10 dBm to
power up a tag and get a successful response. So each portal needs to have
that much power only in the areas where you want the tag to be read. To get
the right amount of power at a dock door, for example, place two reader
antennas on either side of the door, and make sure each antenna reads only
just past halfway across the door. This is true for any instance where anten-
nas are on both sides of the portal. Too much power is a bad thing, particu-
larly if other portals are close by. Some of these engineering issues will be
solved by Generation 2.0 readers, which have a feature for dense reader envi-
ronments. You can expect to see these Gen 2.0 readers in late 2005.

Keep on rollin’ — Setting up RFID 
at a conveyor
The conveyor is the second pitcher in the RFID rotation. The dock door
might be the star player that is throwing the 95 mph fastball, but the con-
veyor has all the subtleties, complications, and effectiveness of a knuckleball
from Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield.
The conveyor setup often consists of four antennas in a quad arrangement,
as shown in Figure 6-3. This setup gives an RFID conveyor application huge
advantages over a bar code conveyor solution because the RFID tag, unlike a
bar code, does not have to be facing in a specific direction. You don’t have to
worry about properly orienting a package as it makes its way through a sort
station or along a conveyor line.
Here are two important guidelines for positioning the antennas in a conveyor
setup:
 Set the antennas far enough away to have strong far-field communica-
tion. This means that the antennas should be about 18 inches away from
the edge of the conveyor. Even though the near field is about a foot (33
cm wavelength), metal and other objects can change the boundary
(interfere with the far field communication) between the near field and
the far field, so having a little wiggle room is a good idea. (For more on
near- and far-field coverage, see “One at a time — Reading objects on a
shelf,” later in this chapter.)

 Position an antenna underneath the conveyor to interrogate tags that
may end up facing the ground. Initially, I thought these antennas
needed to be installed under a nonmetal roller of some sort, but I’ve
found that they work pretty well underneath metal conveyor rollers. In
fact, that is exactly how the largest retailers have them deployed in their
distribution centers.
It’s important to design your RFID network with the end in mind. Although
you might set up only one or two read points for a pilot today, eventually you
might have 100 read points in the warehouse or distribution center. When
you build out your network, you will create an architecture that has critical
dependencies and correlations. The conveyor is a primary example of using
these relationships. If you have one reader in the same sort line or conveyor
line as another reader, the reads on those two should be highly correlated. If
they aren’t, you need to address a performance issue. You want to be able to
compare these two points in real time.
That’s a wrap — Interrogating 
at a shrink-wrap station
From a business process standpoint, the difference between a negative return
on investment (ROI) and a positive ROI might be the ability to read each indi-
vidual case and track information at the case level. The best method for read-
ing all the cases on a pallet is to set up an interrogation zone at a stretch- or
shrink-wrap station.
The type of machine that wraps your pallets determines how you set up the
interrogation zone. For example, if you have an arm that moves around the
pallet, you might set up the antennas of the RFID reader on the moving arm.
However, if you have a turntable that spins around a roll, you might fix an
antenna off to one side of the machine.
The best way to set up an interrogation zone at one of these stations is with a
combination of two antenna locations, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 First location: Affix an antenna to the arm that moves with the roll of
shrink-wrap. This requires a little more time in the installation process
but yields much better results than just setting up fixed antennas. It’s
critical to install the antenna cabling in as protected a manner as possi-
ble. To do this, you need to account for the movement of the arm by
having extra cable that can follow up and down as you cable the anten-
nas back to the reader.
 Second location: Set up the other antenna just next to the stretch-wrap
machine. Make sure that the antennas are not in the way of the forklift as
it drops off the pallet but close enough that the transmitting and receiv-
ing antennas can interrogate the pallet.
109
Chapter 6: Seeing Different RFID Systems at Work

How the pallet is spun on the turntable and the fact that a receiving antenna
moves close to the pallet (on the machine’s arm) make for a very favorable
setup to penetrate deeply into pallets full of cases in order to record accurate
results. After the pallet is stretch-wrapped, many people apply an RFID pallet
tag that summarizes all the contents of the pallet or indicates a standardized
number (like an SSCC — serial shipping container code). This makes a great
area to also set up a printer for additional tags and fits in well with the busi-
ness process. A stretch-wrap station is a great place for a reader because the
turntable of the stretch-wrap machine is constantly changing the location
and orientation of the tags and giving the readers many attempts to read
each of the tags as the pallet spins in the same spot.
One at a time — Reading 
objects on a shelf
The smart shelf was one of the first areas the scientists at MIT sought to con-
quer. Driven by early inspiration from Gillette, which has theft issues with
razor blades because of their relatively high cost and small size (easy to
pocket), the MIT team came up with several ways to read individual objects
on a shelf.
Choosing the right frequency
High frequency (HF), at 13.56 MHz, works best in a shelf situation where it’s
important to know the location of the items but not to read across multiple
shelves. However, HF can’t cover as much area as ultrahigh frequency (UHF),
915 MHz. HF works best in the near field, approximately 1–6 inches from the
antenna, and UHF communicates in the far field, about optimally a foot away
from the antenna. HF is the appropriate choice for most shelf readers because

it reads short range effectively and is less affected by metal and liquid. When
you set up shelf readers, you need to make sure that the antennas are designed
with the frequency, the distance of the tags, and the type of objects in mind.
Configuring a shelf reader
Reading tags at a dock door or a conveyor is like watching Jeff Gordon at the
Daytona 500 — you’ve got to be looking every second, or you’ll miss the car
as it flies by. For a shelf reader, however, speed isn’t an issue. Rather, state
change (something changing from what it was before: on the shelf or not on
the shelf) is the driving design factor. You don’t need (or want) to interrogate
the shelf’s state hundreds of times every minute — doing so just creates tons
of useless data.
You need to configure shelf readers to detect state changes or to poll at rela-
tively long intervals. Some readers, like the Symbol AR-400, can poll continu-
ously but report only when a tag comes in or out of the field. Other readers,
like the Texas Instruments 13.56 MHz board, enable you to custom-program
them to interrogate on various time settings. Choose whichever type of
reader best fits your needs.
Setting up
If you have one antenna per shelf (as shown in Figure 6-5), you can usually use
two or four antennas per reader, depending on the reader and frequency. To
read the tags, the antennas typically cycle through a set order, such as the fol-
lowing: antenna 1 first, antenna 2 second, and so on. You can also customize
the read cycle for your needs. For instance, if you have a top shelf in your store
of DVDs and you want to track which ones customers pick up and look at, you
might want to constantly scan that shelf. (The RFID crew at MeadWestvaco in
Maryland has built some interesting shelf applications for DVDs using shelf
antennas, if you are looking specifically for a shelf application.)
A HF tag works best when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the label
(that is, they meet at right angles). If the magnetic field is parallel to the label,
there is no coupling between tag and antenna and therefore no communica-
tion. This is why it is important to orient the tags at right angles to the radia-
tion of the antenna.
HF tag designs are based on the theory of near-field communication and have
antennas designed in a multiturn planar coil, or simply a multiple turn of the
antenna material. An induced voltage powers the tag and enables it to com-
municate. This voltage is created through Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic
Induction. At HF, where communication is in the near field, coupling volume
theory is what dictates the design of the system, and the focus is on the
energy stored per unit volume around the tag (the coil stores up energy).
Conversely, at UHF, where communication is in the far field, radiating antenna
theory drives the system design, and focus is on the electromagnetic power
flow per area flowing past the tag.

From Ski Resorts to Airlines: Applying
RFID in the Real World
The ability to track and trace, follow and find, and sneak and peek are all
enhanced by the use of RFID. Some privacy advocates worry that machines
will magically attach RFID tags to your clothing or shoes as you walk through
a store or around an office, but this is very unlikely. The limits of the RFID
technology are well known and defined by the laws of physics; however,
effective ways to use this technology are just beginning to emerge. The next
few sections examine some real-world applications of RFID technology and
how they benefit the companies involved.
Ski resorts
Ski resorts, hospitals, and water parks are all using RFID wristbands to follow
patrons and mine information or eliminate payment steps. The benefits of
RFID in this type of situation are twofold. RFID provides a convenience to the
user and, at the same time, creates a more efficient operation for the business.
Think of using RFID at a ski resort. A family shows up and gets mom, dad, and
the two kids wristbands with not only their lift tickets for the day attached 
to them but a certain amount of “mountain dollars” associated with the band
as well. Each of the kids has $25 in case they want to get a soda or buy lip balm
(but not both — if you’ve been to a ski resort lately, you know that would
require $50). As it gets colder and the family throws on extra jackets, they

don’t have to fumble for their lift tickets because the RFID reader can penetrate
easily through a ski jacket. And if one of the kids gets lost, the parents can go to
the ski patrol and find out where and when Junior was last scanned, so they
know where to start looking for him.
The benefits to the ski resort are that the speed of people onto and off of the
lift is greatly increased, and lines are diminished. They also get a lot more infor-
mation about each skier, such as what their patterns of behavior are, because
they can track each individual and their preferences. The lines are shortened
because RFID is not line of sight, and people don’t have to fumble for their lift
tickets to be verified visually. Counterfeiting lift tickets is also eliminated.
Law enforcement
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the law enforcement commu-
nity in general are keenly interested in using RFID to track everything from
evidence to drug shipments. Here are a few RFID applications in the pipeline:
 Tracking imports: The Department of Homeland Security is supporting
an initiative to put active RFID tags on all containers coming into the
United States. This would enable our Customs inspectors to greatly
increase their reach by sealing and verifying containers when they are
packed and then entering the country as “trusted” cargo.
 Controlling access to secure areas: Certain vehicles at airports have
RFID tags hidden underneath them that allow secure access to restricted
areas. RFID readers are embedded in the roadway and determine
whether a vehicle is authorized for access.
Pharmaceuticals
One of the biggest areas of promise for the use of RFID is in the pharmaceuti-
cal world. Currently, theft, counterfeiting, and diversion of expensive pre-
scription drugs are driving up costs. Here are some ways that RFID is helping
drug companies combat these problems:
 Theft and counterfeiting: One way for manufacturers to curb theft and
counterfeiting is to apply tamper-proof RFID labels to these drugs.
Pharmacies and hospitals verify the validity of their stock against a
secure database. If this initiative is widely adopted, along with other
methods like blister packs and chain of custody, this could completely
wipe out counterfeiting.
 Diversion: A bigger problem that RFID can solve for the drug companies
is diversion. This phenomenon arises from tiered pricing structures that
the government imposes on pharmaceutical companies and the distribu-
tion infrastructure in place.
113
Chapter 6: Seeing Different RFID Systems at Work

Here’s how diversion works. Say that Hoboken V.A. hospital orders 1,000
pills from its distributor, Soprano Distribution. Soprano then contacts its
supplier and places an order for the V.A. hospital, which means the pric-
ing is 40 percent less than the normal commercial pricing. But rather than
place an order for 1,000 pills, Soprano ups the order to 2,000. Soprano
ends up getting 2,000 pills at 40 percent off; it then sends 1,000 to the V.A.
hospital and keeps 1,000 to sell to its commercial customers at a much
higher profit margin.
Although this is an oversimplified example, it happens all the time. In
fact, some of the drug manufacturers have even bought back their own
drugs from distributors when they were short of product — for more
than they sold them — because of this problem.
RFID and a centrally managed and secure database could solve this
diversion issue by individually labeling each drug with its own identity
information and then recording each time it goes to a particular distribu-
tor and what the original pricing was meant for. That way, if a drugstore
scans in a new delivery of a drug that’s incorrect, it can send an alarm or
notification. The feds can then work back the chain of custody based on
earlier scans to see where the diversion took place and, yet again, bust
illegal distributors.
Additional business applications
Companies can also benefit from RFID in the following areas:
 Hazardous materials and recalls: A number of areas relating to haz-
ardous materials and recalls hold huge promise for RFID:
• A great example is the work the RFID team at Michelin has done to
embed a passive RFID tag into every tire they manufacture. Although
not yet in production, this has huge implications for maintenance,
shipping, recalls, and safety inspections.
• Companies manufacturing batteries that must meet disposal regu-
lations can embed RFID tags in their batteries and provide an
incentive for consumers to return them for credit on their next bat-
tery purchase. This allows the manufacturer to more accurately
track the returns and disposals even after the outside bar codes
and human-readable text have long worn off.
 Warranty verification and returns: The Computer Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA) is working with manufacturers to use RFID on
everything from work-in-process parts to warranty verification and
returns. Imagine not having to go through a hassle at your local electron-
ics store when you return the surround-sound system that went on the
fritz. They scan the RFID tag on the receiver, note the date and time you
purchased it (information that is kept on a store database), and give you
a new one.
114
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 

 Manufacturing: Many heavy manufacturing industries are seeing the
benefit of RFID as well. Automotive manufacturers have used active RFID
tags for years and now incorporate passive tags on car windows as they
travel through the assembly process to track the entire work in process
of the car from start to finish.
 Maintenance: The airline industry is finding great benefits in its mainte-
nance process. You know those oxygen masks you hope never drop down
when you’re flying on a plane? They are attached to bottles of oxygen
above the seat that have various expiration and refill dates. To check
these bottles, airline personnel used to unscrew each plastic cover and
visually inspect the date. It took hours to check a large plane. Now they
put an RFID tag, which can be read through the plastic cover, on each
bottle and walk down the aisle with a hand-held reader to gather the
exact same information in only minutes.
As RFID technology becomes more pervasive (and it’s possible for you to set
up RFID systems without a degree in physics), RFID will find its way into our
homes and offices in everyday applications, much like the Internet and wire-
less remote controls already have. The first companies to adopt and optimize
the technology are the ones who will leverage the competitive advantage any
disruptive technology can offer.
115
Chapter 6: Seeing Different RFID Systems at Work
Using RFID to track meat
A meat-packing company approached my com-
pany to design a unique RFID application for
tracking a meat product stored in a dumpster-
like container as it moved from a cold-storage
area into a processing area. The company
wanted real-time assurance that the correct
container was delivered to the correct pro-
cessing machine in the correct sequence. The
application needed to be operator-independent
and totally automated.
In order to set up the RFID tracking system, I
needed to devise a way to carefully tag the con-
tainers so that the tags could not potentially fall
into the product and contaminate the system,
and by association the meat. The tags also
needed to withstand cleaning conditions,
steam, and high pressure. Here are the details
of the setup:
 The tag was a stick tag sold by Intermec,
capable of being attached directly to metal.
 The native read distance was 3–4 meters.
 The tag was attached with silicone adhesive.
 The reader system was a portal at the slid-
ing door to the processing room. The equip-
ment was a single Intermec fixed reader
with two antennas facing each other from
opposite sides of the 12-foot opening. The
reader was enclosed in a NEMA 4 box and
hard-wired to house electrical components.
The data management system was RS-232
direct to a local database.
The company also wanted me to attach tags
directly to the meat hooks in the slaughter-
house. These tags needed to be hermetically

116
Part II: Ride the Electromagnetic Wave: The Physics of RFID 
sealed to avoid any contamination, and they
also needed to be small. The goal was to trans-
fer the ear tag information to the hook to follow
the cow all the way through the plant. Here’s the
setup that I used:
 I used 2.45 GHz inlays from Intermec and
molded them directly into plastic parts
specifically designed for these particular
hooks.
 The attachment was done by a machine,
and the tag needed to also survive tremen-
dous physical abuse.
 The readers were NEMA 4–encased and
distributed in a number of places in the plant.
Another popular use of RFID technology is tag-
ging reusable pallets and containers. My expe-
rience with tagging pallets for another company
was no small feat. The company wanted to use
a single tag for an entire pallet. I proposed two
options: place the tag in a plastic end plate or
place the tag in a channel in the wood. The
company opted for placing the tag in a channel.
The biggest challenge was tagging fresh pal-
lets. A normal pallet is at least a year old and
has a moisture content of 6–12 percent, but a
fresh pallet can approach 30 percent moisture.
This amount of moisture can cause up to 6 dB
in tag or system performance, which is enough
to limit read distance by several feet. I set up a
system with a single reader to read the pallets
on a conveyor. This setup yielded good results,
but the moisture content of the new pallets was
something I hadn’t bargained for. This was one
of those applications that helped drive a scien-
tific process for testing products to be tagged,
to avoid surprises like the moisture content.

W
hen you think about installing an RFID system in your warehouse or
distribution center (DC), you may think that the only obstacles you
have to worry about are a fast-moving forklift or an angry dock worker. But
the real villain is invisible, and it’s called ambient electromagnetic noise (AEN).
This rogue AEN consists of electrical and magnetic waves that certain electri-
cal devices generate and propagate through the air. In a typical warehouse or
store backroom — with conveyors, electric doors, sorting machines, infrared
scanners, real-time location systems, alarm motion detectors, site radio com-
munication, and a plethora of other systems generating electrical noise — it’s
easy to imagine how these electromagnetic waves fill the space around you.
Because these systems (which you already have in place) can create AEN
with radio-frequency signals in the range that RFID communications use, you
have a real potential for signal interference. This interference may adversely
affect your new RFID network. And the opposite is also true: Your fancy new
high-powered RFID system may adversely affect your existing systems.
To find out exactly what’s happening with AEN in your environment, you
need to test the location where you’re deploying RFID. This testing is com-
monly called a site assessment or site survey, and it enables you to diagnose
(and plan to avoid) the potential operational problems associated with
installing an RFID system.
In this chapter, I show you how to perform a site assessment and thereby see
the invisible AEN present in your environment. Specifically, I help you iden-
tify the potential sources of electromagnetic waves and decide where in your

facility to test for AEN. I outline the process for setting up test equipment
(like a spectrum analyzer), measuring AEN over time (by performing a Full
Faraday Cycle Analysis), and evaluating the results. Then, based on your
results, you find out how to perform RF path loss contour mapping, which
helps you determine what antenna design, placement, and tuning you need.
This leads to the optimal reader configuration required for a successful RFID
system installation, and also gives you the information needed to select the
right reader for your particular environment.
RFID isn’t like a fast food uniform — one size doesn’t fit all. There is no such
thing as the perfect solution for every application, at least not yet. So you
need to understand your environment and how your products react in that
environment before you can choose the right tags and readers.
Planning for Your Site Assessment
Understanding the working environment is the starting point when designing
and implementing a successful RFID network. The best way to do this is to
perform a radio frequency (RF) site assessment to ensure that the proposed
RFID installation can operate within the planned environment at optimal per-
formance. Sounds easy, right? Unfortunately, the complexity of invisible elec-
tromagnetic waves in your working environment makes sure that it’s not.

Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 
The future of RFID in the ISM band
RFID in the United States operates in the 902–928
MHz band. This is an unlicensed band that many
other systems operate within. Because many
systems operate in this band, the FCC requires
that any device in use, according to regulation 15,
uses frequency hopping. This means that a
device cannot transmit on any one of the 124
channels for longer than a fraction of a second.
The signals literally have to hop from channel to
channel in a pseudo-random manner. Because of
the explosion of popularity in RFID systems, the
FCC is faced with some increasing challenges as
the high-power RFID systems begin to compete
with other devices for channels in the ISM band.
One of the protocols most talked about within the
ISM band is a low-power wireless system called
Zigbee, a next-generation Bluetooth type of tech-
nology. The problem is that Zigbee and other sys-
tems can’t work when a high-powered RFID
system is operating. So what is the solution? 
The best solution would be for the FCC to allocate
a small portion of the 902–928 MHz frequency
specifically to RFID (say from 920–928 MHz). This
would allow RFID to have its own bit of spectrum
and not interfere with other unlicensed technol-
ogy. This would also allow RFID to broadcast in
narrow band (using one channel for extended
periods of time) and avoid frequency hopping. This
means that many systems could operate in the
same warehouse without interfering with each
other.

The site assessment is important because it enables you to see the invisible
forms of radio frequency communication already present — intentionally or
otherwise — where you want to install your reader network. The vast major-
ity of RFID systems operate in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)
band of 902–928 MHz (or 864–870 MHz in Europe), which is an unlicensed fre-
quency in the United States. Because it’s unlicensed, your RFID systems have
to get along with other devices that use this same unlicensed band, including
cordless phones, long-range radios, barcode devices, alarm systems, real-
time location systems, and many other wireless gadgets.
With all these devices vying for the same communication space, intermodula-
tion (that is, communications competing for the same channels — like when
you were on an old analog cell phone and you could hear someone else’s con-
versation) and data collision are inevitable if more than one system is operat-
ing in that unlicensed ISM band. Data collision is messy, costly, and a real
bear to clean up. But you can prevent a nasty clean-up job by performing a
thorough RF site assessment. Consider the following points to plan for and
execute a successful site assessment:
 Go to your business-process map (outlined in Chapter 17) where you
determined the target locations (known as interrogation zones) for
installing your RFID systems. These locations vary from warehouse to
warehouse and need to have a power source and Ethernet connectivity
for the readers (unless you have readers with wireless connectivity).
Commonly, RFID interrogation zones are placed at dock doors, shrink-
wrap stations, conveyor lines, and inventory shelves. After you identify
the target locations for RFID in your facility, you carry out the RF testing
procedure at each one.
 During your site assessment, look for two things: the strength of the
waves that propagate through your potential interrogation zone and
the frequency those waves broadcast over. Plan to perform the RF
assessment at each target location one at a time so you can get a good
picture of the relative strength of signals in each area. The higher the
prevalence and strength of waves in a particular band, the more diffi-
culty you’ll have implementing a successful RFID network.
 Look at AEN over a period of time, during all your business opera-
tions. Normally this is over the course of 24 to 48 hours. When doing a
site assessment, many people make one big mistake: They simply take a
snapshot of the AEN at a particular point in time (which is like choosing
golf clubs to use for an entire course by looking around the seventh
green). Instead, you should follow a process that takes a full look at the
entire electromagnetic cycle as your facility goes through its normal
business operations (which is more like walking all 18 holes of the
course and taking notes before you play it).
121
Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

This method of capturing all the relevant data is called a Full Faraday
Cycle Analysis (FFCA). This fancy-sounding name represents a way of
gathering time-dependent spectrum analysis data across a specific band
of operation at the exact locations where you’ll be setting up an RFID
interrogation zone. For your site assessment, this band is the 902 MHz to
928 MHz (ISM) frequency band. A Full Faraday Cycle Analysis ensures
that, before you start building your RFID network, you’ll have all the
data you need to make the right decisions regarding the type of hard-
ware you need and the way it should be configured. The analysis also
helps you understand any challenges you might face or systems you’ll
have to work around.
The FFCA also must take into account the entire space of your operating 
environment. The best way to do this is to begin looking at AEN at the four
corners of a warehouse and moving toward the center, taking additional 
measurements and recording the relative strength. It is important that you
measure the initial four corners over all work shifts. I’ve seen airport radar
repositioned at a certain time each day, shipping companies that come in
with handhelds, and other sources that can interfere with an RFID system.
Getting the right test equipment
The good news about an RFID deployment is the same as the bad news: The
frequency band used requires no operating license or permissions from any
governing body. Although the FCC has strict rules governing operation in this
FCC-allocated band, no operating license is required to use the 902–928 MHz
range. (To see the FCC rules, go to http://wireless.fcc.gov, click Rules
and Regulations on the left, and scroll down to Part 18 — Industrial, Scientific,
and Medical Equipment.) So before you deploy an RFID system, you need to
become an RF detective by setting up test equipment to find out what other
signals are active in the target area and might affect RFID performance.
You need the following equipment, shown in Figure 7-1, to correctly set up an
RF site assessment:
 Spectrum analyzer (SA): A device that measures the relative strength
and specific bandwidth of communication across a given range (in this
case 902–928 MHz) and that serves as the data-logging mechanism in the
testing setup for your site assessment.
 1⁄4-wave or 1⁄2-wave dipole 915 MHz antenna and ground plane plate:
The antenna is attached to the center of a ground plate (as shown in
Figure 7-1) to properly load the antenna. (The ground plane doesn’t need
to be perforated, like the one shown in Figure 7-1.) The antenna is also
attached to the spectrum analyzer by a coax cable. The antenna listens
in 360 degrees to all the ambient electromagnetic signals, and then
sends those signals back to the spectrum analyzer for display.
122
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

If you are using a 1⁄2-wave antenna, you don’t need a ground plane. You
can attach the antenna directly to the tripod. With the 1⁄4-wave antenna,
you need to use a plate of metal at least 33 cm by 33 cm as the ground
plate.
 Tripod stand: The mechanism that supports the antenna in the center 
of the target location. A tripod should be sturdy enough to hold up the
antenna and flexible enough to go from a foot or two off the ground up
to five or six feet high. A high-quality camera tripod usually does the
trick.
 Laptop computer: The laptop is used to log time-based data captured 
by your RF testing setup. The computer is usually connected to the
spectrum analyzer by an RS-232 or Ethernet cable. If you use an older —
usually cheaper — spectrum analyzer that doesn’t have the option of
connecting directly to a laptop, you can do without the laptop and use 
a digital camera to take pictures of the SA’s screen at various intervals 
to record the data. Although this is not as elegant as having the laptop
create the time-based graphs, it is equally effective.
RF testing equipment has been around for decades and is widely used for
everything from ham radio design to Wi-Fi network setups. There are a
number of sites online where you can find new equipment, but the best deals
are usually found on eBay, which is a fine place to get good equipment inex-
pensively. If you go this route, search for a spectrum analyzer that covers the
902–928 MHz band and make sure that it has been recently calibrated. If you
want to buy this equipment new, National Instruments, HP/Agilent, and
Tectronics all offer a good variety of choices.

Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

Setting up for RF testing
As you set up your RF testing equipment, keep in mind that you want to
gather data over a period of time representative of the normal business cycle.
Make sure that normal (or close to it) operations can take place after you put
your testing equipment in place.
Although it might be easiest to test a warehouse on a Saturday morning when
no one is around to get in your way, that is the worst possible time to get a true
picture of the RF noise that is likely to occur. As crazy as it may sound, test
during the busiest time for your location, and the data you gather will make 
the setup and deployment of your network easier by an order of magnitude.
Follow these steps to set up the test equipment:
1. Place the 1⁄4-wave dipole antenna on the ground plane plate and attach
both to the tripod (or if you’re using a 1⁄2-wave antenna, attach it
directly to the tripod) so that the center of the antenna is in the center
of the target area, as shown in Figure 7-2.
The target area is where you would like the RFID tags to be read — usually
3 feet above the ground for a dock door, 12 inches above a conveyor,
and so on. Because you want the antenna located as close as possible to
the center of the interrogation zone, the best way to mount the antenna
is usually with the tripod contorted in one way or another, so make sure
that you get a tripod that’s easily adjustable. You also may have to get
creative and hang the antenna from above to get it in the middle of the
interrogation zone.
124
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 
Hopping around the frequency band
You may hear people say they are setting up an
ultrahigh frequency (UHF) RFID system at the
915 MHz frequency. This statement is only par-
tially true. Because the FCC allows many unli-
censed devices to operate at that frequency, it
requires that no single device broadcast for
more than a certain length of time. If only one
frequency, or channel, was available, and a
device couldn’t broadcast for a more than a split
second, it just wouldn’t be possible to put many
devices on that channel. That is why devices
are designed to broadcast across a range of
channels.
The process of moving through each channel is
called frequency hopping, and most devices in
this band stay on one channel for only 200 mil-
liseconds or so. So to catch all the broadcasts,
you need to measure not just the 915 MHz chan-
nel, but the whole ISM range — from 902 MHz
to 928 MHz. (That’s 13 MHz on either side of the
center frequency, or a 26 MHz span.) The span
you need to measure is more than twice that (a
60 MHz span), however, because other licensed
frequencies may be operating close enough to
your ISM band and with enough power to inter-
rupt communications.

Do not hang an antenna from its coax cable because doing so may inter-
fere with the signal and communication and not accurately ground the
antenna. Instead, use a piece of rope or other nonconductive material to
hang the antenna.
2. Connect the antenna and ground plane to the spectrum analyzer by
screwing the coax cable into the input port on the spectrum analyzer.
As with all RF equipment, never connect or disconnect an antenna to 
or from a powered-up device, even if the device has fault protection.
Although most of today’s electronics have solid protection, connecting
an antenna with the power off is a good habit to get into that may save
you a few thousand dollars’ worth of fried equipment.
3. Attach the laptop computer to the spectrum analyzer, using either an
RS-232 connector or Ethernet cable, and power it up.
4. Power up the spectrum analyzer and tune it to a center frequency of
915 MHz.
See the sidebar, “Hopping around the frequency band” for the hows and
whys of tuning to this frequency.
5. Finish setting up the spectrum analyzer by doing the following:
• Set the span to 60 MHz. This setting ensures that the analyzer duly
notes any AEN on either side of the 915 MHz center frequency. You
want to know if any signals are even close because a device broad-
casting at 901 MHz can cause interference.
• Set the resolution bandwidth to 100 kHz to ensure that you record
reasonable levels of interference.
• Set the video bandwidth to 30 kHz to obtain a smooth plot on the
spectrum analyzer.
Figure 7-2:
An antenna

center of a
target area.
125
Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

• Set the amplitude attenuation to 0 dB so that the spectrum ana-
lyzer displays a discernible signal-to-noise level (making it easier
to see the interfering signals above the noise floor).
• Turn on maximum hold so that you can capture the energy of
every channel in the band you are testing.
After the antenna is in the middle of the proposed interrogation zone and
attached to your correctly tuned spectrum analyzer, you should see the virtual
screen on your laptop, or the video screen on the spectrum analyzer should be
active. If you see either one of these, you’re ready to start the testing.
Measuring for AEN during Normal
Operations (And Beyond)
The Full Faraday Cycle Analysis is the foundation for building an RFID network,
and the goal of that analysis is to have a perfect foundation for the structures
being put on top of it. For a full analysis, you need to do the following:
 Identify all the ambient electromagnetic noise within the facility.
 Log data over the course of a full business cycle (all the shifts) to under-
stand any changes that happen at different times of the day.
 Measure specifically at each interrogation zone to correctly assess the
strength of signals relative to where you’ll install readers.
 Rove around the facility to make sure you looked in every nook and
cranny for rogue AEN.
 Triangulate any sources of interference while roving about the facility
(in other words, get closer and closer until you find the source of the
interfering AEN).
 Run all the possible machinery and equipment that is likely to make
electronic noise in the interrogation zone while recording the data to
make sure no potential source is overlooked.
 Address the potential interference found by either eliminating it (for
example, upgrading a wireless barcode system from 915 MHz to 2.4 GHz
or finding a creative workaround (such as deploying only hand-held
RFID readers that do not broadcast at the full power of a fixed location
reader and don’t create as much interference).
 Map out the interrogation zones on computer-aided drafting (CAD)
drawings or blueprints and make sure that those zones are noise-free.
126
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

With your equipment set up, you’re ready to begin. The following sections
explain in more detail how you accomplish each part of the analysis.
Testing key points around the warehouse
As you test, you need to log the data:
 If you are using a laptop to log the data or employing a software-based
spectrum analyzer (like a National Instruments model), you should set
your virtual monitor to record information every hour and actively log it
to the hard drive.
 If you are using a spectrum analyzer without a laptop, you should
come back and take a digital picture every two hours over the course of
the normal business cycle. After taking the picture, clear the video dis-
play by resetting the video screen and begin collecting data again.
This initial measurement process is effective, but only represents one data
point in a facility. How large the warehouse is and how strong interfering sig-
nals are will determine what you pick up from that one location. So if you
have a large warehouse, you have to set up the same test procedure at sev-
eral locations within the warehouse to increase the accuracy.
You want to make sure you test for AEN close to all the potential RFID reader
interrogation zones (usually the dock doors, conveyor or sort stations, and
so on).
If you do notice any significant spikes on the monitor, you’ve caught some
interference. It is important to note the location, the time, and the frequency of
the interference and try to map a pattern (for instance, does the spike occur
every hour when the security guard makes his rounds?) or try to narrow the
time period in the next day or two to figure out the source of interference (did
a FedEx truck arrive to pick up packages during the window when you had
interference?).
One drawback to this static testing methodology is that it is difficult to find
the location of any interference. That’s why you follow up with other tests,
which I explain in the next two sections.
I’ve been a wild rover for many’s a year
The next step toward increasing the accuracy of your Full Faraday Cycle
Analysis is to take a roving data capture of AEN. This test is particularly effec-
tive if you share a facility with other tenants who may be running systems
127
Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

that are separated from yours by only sheetrock walls. To take a roving cap-
ture, you need the following:
 A portable uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or similar battery back-
up device. You need the ability to power the spectrum analyzer for
20–30 minutes. These are available from American Power Conversion for
under $200 at most computer stores.
 A golf cart, shopping cart, or similar means of wheeling your equipment
around a warehouse safely.
 A willing friend to act as a human tripod and carry the antenna around
next to the golf cart.
 Blueprints or CAD drawings of the facility come in handy, too.
To do the roving capture, follow these steps:
1. Set up the spectrum analyzer in the exact same manner as you did for
the static capture, except the power source and the antenna are both
mobile.
2. Rove around the facility, watching for noise in the spectrum ana-
lyzer’s display.
Because you are moving about the facility, you need to watch the dis-
play closely for noise in the ISM band and notice where that noise
occurred.
3. If you do find a source of interference, make sure you note the exact
location on your CAD drawing or blueprint and the strength in –dB or
decibels (which is how AEN is measured, just like sound waves are
measured in –dB).
4. Begin moving away from that original spot of interference in 10- to 15-
foot increments in four directions. In other words, move north 10 feet,
go back to the original spot, move south 10 feet, go back . . . you get
the idea.
This gives you four read points equidistant from the original interfer-
ence location to compare relative strength. If any one of the four points
is stronger than the first in terms of AEN signal strength, the interference
is coming from that direction. You need to repeat the same process from
the new location (the one with the stronger signal) in order to triangu-
late the source of the interference; in other words, keep moving toward
stronger signals until you find the source.
It helps if you have blueprints or CAD drawings of the facility. If you
encounter any random noise, you can mark the exact location where you 
128
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

picked up the interference and the exact strength of that location. Doing this
in multiple locations will also help you pinpoint the source of interference
based on signal strength. Having blueprints will also help you lay out your
design and location of the interrogation zones. If you don’t have CAD draw-
ings or actual blueprints, a simple diagram drawn to scale will help in the
planning stages.
I don’t hear anything; time 
to make my own noise
Now comes the fun part: making some noise. Mobile mechanical devices (like
forklifts, hand trucks, and the like) may pollute your potential interrogation
zones. To find out exactly what the effects of these devices are, you need to
bring those devices into the zone, run them full power, and see what sort of
AEN they create. Occasionally, the testing done during the normal business
cycle might leave out a business process, like running a floor cleaner that’s
used only one day a week, so now is the time to make sure you cover every
possible source of interference.
You need the spectrum analyzer, antenna, and laptop computer used in the
earlier stage. To do the test, follow these steps: 
1. Set up the spectrum analyzer in your interrogation zone by following
the same steps I outline in “Setting up for RF testing,” earlier in this
chapter.
All the settings for MHz, resolution bandwidth, video bandwidth, and so
on are the same.
2. Make some noise. Whatever business machines you’ve decided to use,
now is the time to fire them up and move them through and around
the interrogation zone.
This includes driving in and out of dock doors, raising and lowering fork-
lift blades, turning around, and so on.
3. As you operate the machines in the interrogation zone, make sure you
record the results. After a few passes through the area with various
machines, stop recording the data.
4. Any data that shows up on the spectrum analyzer but didn’t show up
during the normal testing of the same area suggests that some form of
interference is present. The next section explains how you ensure it
doesn’t become a problem.
129
Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

Solving interference problems
If at any time during the FFCA you discover interference, you have two
choices:
 Determine the cause of the interference and remove it. If a forklift, an
electronic scale, or an industrial magnet is causing issues, you may need
to make sure it doesn’t operate in the interrogation zone. Isolating the
guilty device is an easy way to fix the problem. Sometimes this is as easy
as moving it a few yards away from the interrogation zone; sometimes it
may need to be moved clear across the building.
 Work around it. Working around it is the more difficult choice.
Workarounds are difficult because a warehouse RFID system is designed
to get reads over open distances of several feet or more. Shielding entire
dock doors or conveyor stations from AEN is usually impractical. You
might be able to find the source of the noise (such as an alarm system or
hand-held scanners) and shield only those interferers. A common prob-
lem is that overnight carriers’ equipment is very close to the 902 MHz
band, and if you do a lot of parcel shipping, you may need a dedicated
location that is not near an interrogation zone for these carriers to use.
You may find that wireless barcode systems, which are common in ware-
houses, are operating over the UHF unlicensed band as well. If this is the case
and you’re planning a full RFID deployment, you can pretty much plan on call-
ing your bar code vendor and asking for an upgrade to 2.45 GHz. Many early
adopters of RFID had to go through this very exercise after they realized what
was messing up their bar code readers. If you don’t upgrade, hand-held bar
code scanners continue to transmit across the ISM, but the higher power
RFID readers will use more channels. Eventually, as more RFID readers are
deployed, the RFID readers will totally drown out the bar code readers.
Testing to Plan Your RFID Installation
With the Full Faraday Cycle Analysis complete (see the preceding sections for
details), you have the blueprints for building an RFID network. You under-
stand what you have to deal with. Now you want to use the data you gathered
to design the interrogation zones (the areas where you’ll set up RFID readers
to read tagged items), which is like creating a perfect set of footings for the
structures being put on top of your foundation. (For you artistic types, after
the site assessment is done, it’s like starting with a fresh canvas for your elec-
tromagnetic work of art.) 
130
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

Designing the interrogation zones requires two steps:
1. You begin by propagating a perfect RF wave around the area in which
you propose to set up your readers.
2. Then you create a contour map that helps you determine how those
waves are going to behave in that specific location.
Multi-pathing is a phenomenon that occurs in RF communications when
waves of matching frequency collide and drown each other out, causing
what’s called nulls or null spots. The RF path loss contour mapping helps
you determine where those spots are likely to be.
In the following sections, I explain these steps in more detail.
Gathering your equipment
It takes more than breadcrumbs to map the path of an RF signal. Propagating
the perfect RF wave and creating the contour map requires tools, and lots of
them. Here’s a quick list of items you need:
 Spectrum analyzer: A device that measures the relative strength and
specific bandwidth of communication across a given range (in this case,
902–928 MHz) and captures data as you test.
 Signal generator: A specialized device that produces RF signals at
preset frequencies, strengths, and durations. The signal generator is
hooked up to a 1⁄4-wave dipole antenna via a coax cable and will be used
to transmit the generated RF field.
 Circularly polarized UHF antenna: The antenna used by any UHF
reader, or one ordered directly from a company like Cushcraft or
Sensormatic, is attached to the spectrum analyzer to measure the RF
field received from the signal generator.
 1⁄4-wave dipole 915 MHz antenna and ground plane plate: Again, you
attach the antenna to the center of the ground plane plate and then
attach the antenna (mounted on the ground plane) to the signal genera-
tor. The antenna radiates an RF field in 360 degrees.
 Two tripod stands: One stand supports the antenna in the center of the
target location, and the other stand supports the UHF antenna at the
outside of the interrogation zone. A high-quality camera tripod is often
sturdy enough to hold up the antenna and flexible enough to go from a
foot or two off the ground up to five or six feet high.
131
Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

 Laptop computer: The laptop is used to measure the relative strength of
the signal produced by the signal generator. If you decided to get an
older spectrum analyzer that doesn’t connect directly to a laptop, you
can use a digital camera to take pictures of the SA’s screen at various
intervals to record the data.
At the end of the testing, you also use the laptop to take the data produced
by the test and map it in a spreadsheet program like Excel or Lotus.
Comparing the perfect signal 
to the actual signal
After you have performed your Full Faraday Cycle Analysis and you are sure
that no ambient noise is polluting the interrogation zone, you can start map-
ping out what the interrogation zone will look like. This processes is called RF
path loss contour mapping, which basically involves mapping out the RF path
where it varies from that perfect RF field.
The RF field propagating from an antenna is shaped like a giant pear, with the
stem attached to the antenna and the fat part heading off into space. The
items with RFID tags on them will move through the fat part. This RF propaga-
tion bubble’s size and shape depends on the type of antenna you use, and it
changes dramatically when there is anything within the bubble to reflect or
absorb the RF waves. Figure 7-3 shows a graphical representation of what the
RFID interrogation zone looks like.

132
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

RF path loss contour mapping enables you to understand how things around
a proposed interrogation zone distort that perfect shape. You use this infor-
mation to determine exactly where to place antennas and how much power
you need to create a signal.
Setting up the equipment
Here’s how to set up your equipment so you can start testing:
1. Place the 1⁄4-wave dipole antenna on the ground plane plate and attach
both to the tripod stand so that the center of the antenna is in the
center of the target area, as previously illustrated in Figure 7-2.
The target area is where you would like the RFID tags to be read — usually
3 feet above the ground for a dock door, 12 inches above a conveyor,
and so on. Because you want the antenna as close as possible to the
center of the interrogation zone, the best way to mount the antenna is
usually with the tripod contorted in one way or another, so make sure
that you get a tripod that is easily adjustable. You also might have to get
creative and hang the antenna from above to get it in the middle of the
interrogation zone.
2. Connect the 1⁄4-wave dipole antenna to the signal generator via the
coax cable.
3. Set the signal generator to a signal of at least –14 dBm so that the UHF
antenna can pick up a reasonably good signal.
4. Attach the laptop computer to the spectrum analyzer by using either
an RS-232 connector or Ethernet cable. Power up the laptop.
5. Attach the UHF antenna to the spectrum analyzer. Power up the spec-
trum analyzer and tune it to a center frequency of 915 MHz and a
span of 60 MHz.
6. Finish setting up the spectrum analyzer by doing the following:
• Set the span to 60 MHz.
• Set the resolution bandwidth to 100 kHz.
• Set the video bandwidth to 30 kHz.
• Set the amplitude attenuation to 0 dB.
• Turn off maximum hold to capture the energy received from the
radiating antenna.
See the earlier section, “Setting up for RF testing” for details on what
each of these settings does.
133
Chapter 7: Seeing the Invisible: The Site Assessment

Conducting the test
After setting up your equipment, you’re ready to test. To understand how the
test works, remember that the equipment is set up to simulate what will
become your interrogation zones:
 The 1⁄4-wave antenna attached to the signal generator pretends to be a
tag bouncing back a mock signal that is read by the UHF antenna.
 The UHF antenna simulates the tag reader that collects information from
the tags as the tagged boxes cross this zone.
To figure out the RF path loss, it helps to think of the interrogation zone area
you want to set up as being roughly the shape of a pie and to think of the tag
location as being at the center of a pie. Then divide the pie into eight slices
(the slices would be cut at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees).
Figure 7-4 shows where the 1⁄4-wave antenna should be positioned in the
center of the interrogation zone, and the eight spots around it show the loca-
tion of the UHF antenna attached to the signal generator. Those eight corners
are where you want to test the reaction of a 915 MHz propagation, or how
well the RF wave travels back to be heard by the reader’s antennas.
For the purposes of this first test, assume that you are trying to find out how
a dock door and all the equipment around it will affect the placement of
antennas, which direction they will have to face, and how much power each
antenna will need. The location could be any potential interrogation zone,

Follow these steps to conduct the test:
1. Place the 1⁄4 dipole antenna, which is connected to the signal genera-
tor, in the center of the proposed interrogation zone.
2. Connect the UHF flat panel directional antenna to the spectrum ana-
lyzer and mount it at the same height as the 1⁄4-wave dipole antenna.
Place it parallel to the dock door in the center (0 degrees in our
Figure 7-4 pie).
3. Turn the signal generator on first to 902 MHz and record the results
on the spectrum analyzer. Keep the UHF antenna in the same location
and set the signal generator to 915 MHz and record the results. Lastly,
repeat the process with the signal generator set to 928 MHz.
It is important to record the strength of the signal three times, once at
each of the different frequencies.
4. Relocate the directional antenna to each of the eight positions in the
Figure 7-4 pie around the 1⁄4-wave dipole antenna and record the signal
strength at each position.
Keep the distance from the 1⁄4-wave dipole the same. You want the dis-
tance to be the maximum distance you want to read from, which is usu-
ally half the total width of the dock door. Keep the directional antenna
always facing directly toward the 1⁄4-wave dipole.
This will result in an eight-position contour map of the RF field strength.
5. Put these 24 values into a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft
Excel, in the following format:

6. Using the radar graph option in the spreadsheet program, convert the
24 results from your 8-position test into a radar graph.
The result should look something like the graph on the right in Figure
7-5. The graph on the left is a perfect RF field in a vacuum. The informa-
tion you are interested in is how these two figures are different.
Putting your results to use
The Full Faraday Cycle Analysis and the RF path loss contour map are also
the perfect blueprint for setting up other aspects of an optimal RFID network
architecture. With those two tests completed, you can move on to the next
key steps in deploying your RFID network:
 You can choose the best reader to fit your needs.
 You can set up the optimal configuration of those readers.
 You can verify and test the readers once they are set up.
The RF path loss contour map is an important tool for designing your reader
interrogation zone. The ideal zone should be an equal bubble around the
center pole (the left graph in Figure 7-5).

You now need to compensate for any areas within that bubble that do not
have equally powerful signal strength. If an area where you decide to set up
an antenna is particularly weak, that will be a difficult area for tags to receive
enough energy to power back a signal.
A passive RFID tag requires about 100 microwatts of power (or –10 dBm) to
generate enough power and backscatter a signal to the receiving antenna of 
a reader. If you want to avoid problems of reading across multiple interroga-
tion zones (like from one dock door to another), you need to make sure your
power levels are below the –10 dBm level. This can be done by adjusting the
power or shaping the field with antenna choice and direction or with shield-
ing between the dock doors. Chapter 9 explains the specifics of reader setup
and testing.
For example, if you refer to the graph on the right in Figure 7-5, you see that
the signal reaching the point that represents 225 degrees is much weaker (or
closer to the center) than the other points in the chart. The signal is weaker
because something is either absorbing or deflecting the signal away from this
area.
It is up to the reader configuration to compensate for this loss. To counteract
that loss, the antenna located on that side of the dock door needs additional
power compared to the other dock doors.

I
magine yourself in the woods of Switzerland back in the year 1307. You’ve
got to shoot an apple off your son’s noggin’ or die. Do you just go out to
your local sporting goods store, pick up a bow, and take a shot? Of course
not, and neither would William Tell. He spent hours honing his skills and cre-
ating and testing bow designs before he became the expert marksman who
let that famous shot fly. How do you hone your skills and create perfect
designs for RFID before you make a huge investment in your production
system? By putting together a well-planned and -organized lab. That is your
key to becoming the William Tell of the RFID world.
As I mention throughout this book, understanding physics holds the key to a
successful RFID deployment. But physics can be a fickle thing: Because you
can’t see how radio frequency waves change and behave, you have to find
other means for knowing what happens with certain combinations of hard-
ware, antennas, tags, and products. The best way to glean useful information
is by having a consistent environment in which you can execute a repeatable
process. A repeatable and consistent testing methodology allows you to
change one variable at a time and compare results to understand the physics
behind RFID.

Not only does a quality lab help you to choose equipment, design, and
processes, but it is also a great place for your RFID team to discover new
technologies and try new equipment in a low-risk, nonproduction environ-
ment. You save money by testing equipment and identifying what will work
best for your RFID network before making a large financial investment in that
equipment, and you can separate marketing hype from reality. The lab can
also pay for itself quickly if you have a lot of items to test for tag placement
and tag type — also known as SKU testing. (SKU stands for stock-keeping unit.)
And lastly, a lab is also a great tool for getting the CEO excited about RFID.
This chapter takes you through the five steps of setting up a world-class lab
and gives you some examples of test procedures you can use to compare
equipment before making a buying decision. I tell you what equipment you
must have, what is nice to have, and what is icing on the cake. In addition, I
describe some of the test procedures we’ve refined at the ODIN technologies
labs and explain how you can apply your lab results and knowledge to the
real world.
To Lab or Not to Lab
Stop — before you spend any more time reading this chapter, you need to
understand the three options for testing products, evaluating equipment, and
trying different RFID configurations:
 Use a third-party lab. Third-party labs are great if you’re testing just a
few products or want the latest information on readers, antennas, and
tags. As I write this book, three principal labs do scientific testing for
RFID and also test for hire: 
• Met Labs (www.metlabs.com)
• The University of Kansas, anchoring the consortium called the
RFID Alliance Lab (www.rfidalliancelab.org)
• ODIN technologies lab, which has been doing RFID the longest and
produced the first head-to-head comparison of RFID readers and
tags (www.odintechnologies.com)
 Build your own in-house RFID lab. The benefit of having your own lab
is that you can maintain control over the testing, especially if you are
concerned with competitors seeing a preview of new products or pack-
aging. You also build a great amount of internal knowledge around the
technology. The drawback is the initial expense and the operating cost
to keep a lab running, train people, and recruit good talent.
 Use hybrid approach. In this case, a qualified consultant or existing lab
sets up a lab for you. You use their testing software, services, and proto-
cols to get the benefit of their intellectual capital but still maintain control
and build knowledge.

Beyond a Swanky White Lab Coat: The
Tools You Need for Successful Testing
Before setting up a lab, you need to think about what tools you need for a
successful lab environment. If you’re setting up a lab on your own, you need
some of this equipment in order to build the lab. If you’re using an outside
firm to help you set up a lab, ask which of the following devices they plan on
including. So get out your checkbook and let’s go shopping. First, here are
the must-haves:
 An assortment of RFID readers that have
• The ability to read Class 0, Class 1, and Generation 2.0 tags
• The ability to read multiple protocols
• Integrated printers
 An assortment of linear and circular polarized antennas — both 
directional and omnidirectional (many will come with the readers,
others can be ordered directly from Cushcraft or Sensormatic)
 A mixture of RFID tags
 An application server and database server
 Several hubs — USB, RS-232, and RS-485
 Several serial-to-Ethernet converters
 An assortment of zip-ties and plastic bands
 1-inch thick colored tape
 25 feet of 2.5-inch PVC pipe
 Ten 2.5-inch 90-degree PVC joints
 Four 2.5-inch PVC T-joints
 Four camera tripods
If you’re aren’t yet familiar with the different readers, antennas, and tags, flip
to Chapter 5, where I explain these in more detail.
The following list shows the tools that are nice to have, but that are not
entirely necessary. (I explain these in more detail in Chapter 7.)
 Lab-grade spectrum analyzer that can operate up to at least 1.5 GHz
 Lab-grade signal generator that can operate up to at least 1.5 GHz
 RF power meter with power head for frequencies up to 1.5 GHz and up
to 5 watts of power
141
Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab

 RFID racks
 Cyclotron or similar instrument to accelerate the products with variable
speed controller (Chapter 10 talks about ODIN technologies’ Cyclotron
and the benefits of using a Cyclotron instead of a loop conveyor.)
 RF attenuator (This device is attached to the cable between the antenna
and the reader and enables you to precisely control the power output.)
 Loop conveyor with variable speed motors and safety rails
Now, if you’ve got a great boss and a hefty budget, the following tools are the
icing on the cake:
 Lab-grade oscilloscope with 150 MHz bandwidth minimum
 RFID testing software
 Multimeter
 Forklift
 Server rack or cabinet
 Computers, routers, and spare monitors
 Anechoic chamber (see the sidebar, “Building an anechoic chamber”)
 Your own dedicated lab rat
Combining the must-haves and nice-to-haves with proper testing methodology
and procedures gives you a lab that’ll stand up to any lab in the commercial
world. Add some innovative testing software, and you can produce results in-
house that others in the commercial world pay hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars to get.
Setting Up Your Lab
After you gather the tools on your shopping list, you’re ready to set up your
lab. In the sections that follow, I walk you through the five steps of setting up
your world-class lab:
1. Find the perfect location.
2. Design the physical layout.
3. Set up the test equipment.
4. Build specific test equipment.
5. Develop and implement standardized test procedures.
The steps are laid out in a specific order to make setting up your lab as easy
as possible.
142
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

X-ray marks the spot: Find 
the perfect location
The first step in setting up a lab is deciding where to put it. Most companies
put a lab in either a warehouse or part of an office building. Both locations
have their own challenges.
Examining the ideal conditions
Before weighing the pros and cons of setting up a lab in a warehouse or office
building, it’s important to consider the common attributes for a good lab:
 A room or area that’s large enough to set up test equipment and antenna
stands next to each other, with up to 15 feet between the equipment and
the stands and 10 feet on all sides around the test area. Ideally, the area
is at least 30 feet by 45 feet and wide open. The bigger the better. With
ceilings, higher is better, too.
 Minimal metal in walls and no cabinets or tables with significant metal
content in the immediate area. (Metal studs are acceptable in plaster-
board walls if you’ve got a room that is 30 to 50 feet wide.)
 No metal buildings or sheds.
 No metal ceilings, roof structures, floor structures, or wall structures
within 30 feet of the perimeter of the test lab area.
 An area above and below the floor of the target lab area with the same
attributes as the lab location itself.
 A clean RF environment.
Taking AEN into account
Think of setting up your lab in the same way you’d think about deploying a
production RFID environment. Figure out how much ambient electromagnetic
noise (AEN) is in the proposed area and what to do if there’s a lot of AEN,
which might cause interference. Chapter 7 takes you through the details of a
Full Faraday Cycle Analysis (FFCA), which you need to perform before finaliz-
ing any lab location. You can either perform the analysis yourself with a spec-
trum analyzer or hire a firm to perform the analysis for you.
A laboratory environment needs to be much cleaner than a typical production
environment. If an existing hand-held system or a security or location system
is running over RF in a warehouse, it can usually work in concert with an
RFID system. For a laboratory setting, however, you can’t have any extraneous
noise if you want accurate results. If you find any AEN where you’re planning
the lab, you need to either move the lab or eliminate the source of AEN. If
you’re lucky enough to have an unlimited budget, you can buy anechoic mate-
rial or shielding and insulate the lab.
143
Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab

Considering power and network connectivity
A lab helps you create important data that will be useful in your production
environment. To deal with that lab data and eventually to collect production
data for analysis, make sure you have sufficient power and network connec-
tivity. An important long-term consideration is the ability to share data
between your production environment and your testing environment, so 
setting up a dedicated network for the lab is an ideal scenario.
I like to have a server cabinet in one corner of the lab that is close to the net-
work connects (or “drops”) that are built into the wall like electrical outlets.
From the server cabinet, you can network the lab from the servers to the
printers to the readers. Enclose the cabinet to protect the hardware from
dust, heat, and impact. Most IT folks like to make the RFID network its own
stand-alone network, separated from the regular corporate network, so there’s
no possible threat of intrusion.
Deciding between an office or a warehouse
When deciding whether to locate your lab in an office setting or in a ware-
house, you need to consider the amount and size of the equipment you’ll 
be using or testing:
 Office setting: If your lab is in an office setting, you probably can’t con-
struct a dock door portal and use a forklift, unless you’ve got a very for-
giving CEO and landlord. An office setting is best for testing the products
or SKUs in a static environment (one that doesn’t use the movement and
noise of the loop conveyor or Cyclotron), using frequency response
characterization (which I explain in Chapter 9 on tag testing protocol).
You can easily grid the floor and lay out a testing of readers and tags,
but you won’t have the benefit of validating your testing on a dock door
or conveyor.
 Warehouse: If you want to test full pallets, stretch-wrap machines, and
dock door configurations, consider putting your lab in a warehouse
environment. The perfect scenario is to set up a lab in a nicely built-out
portion of a warehouse. The build-out must be clean, open, and well-
finished, including finished walls and either carpeted or vinyl floors to
eliminate dust. The doors should be double-wide in case you want to
move a full pallet into the finished area as well.
For one Fortune 100 client, we built a clean testing environment in an
office-like setup within the warehouse and networked it with testing sta-
tions on dock doors, shrink-wrap stations, and conveyors out on the
warehouse floor. This is the ideal setup. The more individual components
of a production facility (dock doors, forklifts, shrink-wrap stations) you
can include in the testing environment, the better your information will
be as you move from testing to pilot to production.
144
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

If you’re looking for dedicated space for your lab in an office building or
industrial park, be sure you know who your neighbors are and what they do
before you sign a lease. For example, say that you find what seems like the
perfect environment: a great 5,000-square-foot flex space with a big built-out
clean front area and a large warehouse, dock door, and heavy power in the
back. However, you later discover that the tenants next door include an air-
plane radar manufacturer and a machine shop — the next thing you know
you’re feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys. To protect your company from
this scenario, make sure the facility goes through a 48-hour Full Faraday
Cycle Analysis and passes with no AEN before committing to your lease.
Physics eye for the lab guy: 
Design the physical layout
Although you may not be the person in your house picking out the curtains
(sorry, Honey — window dressings) to match the sofa, you need to be the
person designing the layout of the laboratory environment, which is the next
145
Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab
Building an anechoic chamber
An anechoic chamber is the bling-bling of the
RFID world. It’s a dedicated space where no RF
waves can come in from the outside, and none
of the waves your RFID equipment produces will
bounce or echo to confuse your results. If
you’re lucky enough to have the budget to build
one, you’ll be the envy of your RFID posse.
Building an anechoic chamber is easier than
you might think, but it’s definitely not cheap. A
typical anechoic chamber includes 3, 5, or 10
meters of testing area. If you can dedicate a
room roughly 20 feet long by 15 feet wide by at
least 10 feet high, you’re off to a good start. Here
are some general guidelines for constructing it:
 Build the walls out of plywood rather than
sheetrock.
 Line the outside of the plywood walls (and
ceiling) with RF shielding to keep out any
ambient electromagnetic noise (AEN) —
like radios, cell phones, alarm systems, and
the like. The shielding material is usually
metallic plates with electrical contact
between them. Aluminum or copper panels
make for the best shielding.
 Line the inside walls, ceiling, and floors with
absorbing material. This material can be
cone-shaped polyurethane integrated with
carbon or tiles.
 Cover the floor with ferrite tiles to further
absorb RF waves.
An anechoic chamber is a perfect environment
in which to test tags, readers, and antennas and
to find absolute data. It’s a great luxury to have,
but if you can’t afford one, many universities
and commercial companies will rent out time in
their chambers. Either way, just knowing the
term anechoic chamber makes you cooler than
the other side of the pillow.

step after finding the right location. Just as the secret to good home decor is
knowing the nuances of a color palette, the trick to designing a functionally
efficient lab is knowing how to preserve open space.
Drafting your plan on paper
On a piece of graph paper, create a homemade floor plan for initial design
and for follow-on experiments. Here are some general guidelines for creating
this plan on paper:
 Lay out the floor of the test lab in a 1 foot = 1⁄4 inch scale.
 Mark out power locations (and voltage) and network drops (connectivity
points).
 Based on available power, plan out your main testing floor space in the
middle of as much power as possible. If one end of the room has power
and connectivity on all three sides, use that as your main testing area.
Use the guidelines I mention earlier in this chapter to determine the size
of the space.
Creating a grid pattern on the testing floor
After you earmark a large area of open space to serve as your main testing
floor, you need to create the points of reference on the floor with a grid (like 
a giant version of your graph paper). This is where your 1-inch colored tape
comes in or where you put your painting skills to use. The best way to create
this grid is to follow these steps:
1. Decide what will be the dead center of the testing space.
2. To create the grid pattern, first lay out (using tape or paint) a set of
parallel lines off the center point.
I like to use 1 foot of separation between parallel lines. Making the lines
parallel to a wall also helps because you can keep the lines straight by
measuring an equal amount off the same wall at various points.
3. After you have a good set of lines running parallel in one direction,
lay down a set of perpendicular lines (exactly 90 degrees the other
way) and create those lines across your original set.
4. Go back to your center point and strike two lines from corner to
corner through the center of the grid so that you have lines at 45
degrees off center.
The final result looks like the pattern shown in Figure 8-1.
146
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

Setting up areas for computer monitors
The next order of business is setting up workbenches and areas for various
computer monitors. I say monitors because ideally you should have print-
and-apply machines, readers, and test equipment hooked up to those moni-
tors as well as to servers and desktop computers. Here are some general
guidelines for setting up these areas:
 Workbenches: These can be something as simple as folding banquet
tables or as sophisticated as built-in sturdy wood-framed workbenches
with shelves and tool storage areas. Your imagination — and your
budget — are the only limitations.
When setting up your workbenches, make sure that they are located
near ample power and situated along the edge of the lab so they don’t
take up any more floor space than necessary. If you can cluster your
workbenches in two areas — one near the server rack and the other at
the opposite end of the lab — two or more people can work at the same
time without tripping all over each other.
 Workstations: Set up the different workstations by category, such as
software/networking, hardware setup and configuration, and lastly a
dedicated testing area. If the four corners of your room all have ample
Figure 8-1:

Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab

power and connectivity, put the server rack in one corner with the soft-
ware/networking stations, put a reader setup and configuration area in
the corner with the least connectivity, put a SKU testing station in
another corner, and the last corner you can decide on as you discover
your specific needs.
 Bins, shelves, and other storage: Next, fill the walls along the edges with
bins, shelves, and other storage for tools and equipment. It seems like
you can never have enough storage, and some things, such as antennas,
require careful consideration when making storage areas. Figure 8-2 shows
a simple solution for keeping various types of antennas well organized
and protected. Cardboard shelves from an office supply store make per-
fect storage space for only a couple of dollars. If you want to protect cer-
tain storage areas from RF energy, you can build screens of any thin
metallic material; however a screening solution also creates reflection,
which may affect the rest of your testing environment, so be careful.
Set up the test equipment
After your lab is located, designed, and partially outfitted, it’s time to put all
that fancy electronic gear to work. The third step is setting up your lab gear.
Before you set up the test equipment, consider whether you’ll ever need to
move the gear:

 If you know something will be a permanent fixture in the lab, set it up
like a permanent fixture. Put it in a rack, tie down the cabling and wire
neatly, and protect it from impact and grime.
 If you know something will be used out on location (like spectrum
analyzers and signal generators), think about creating an area that is
analogous to a docking station for a laptop. Pick a spot where the gear
will be useful while in the lab but can quickly be removed and taken
afield. See the sidebar, “Protecting your gear on the go,” for details about
protecting gear if you need to move it often.
In the lab, deploy testing stations that enable you to do both scientific testing
and application testing:
 Scientific testing covers things like profiling RF interrogation zones out
of various antennas, determining the variability of tag types, and tag pro-
duction performance.
 Application testing covers things like understanding reader configura-
tions for a dock door and building mock portals.
For scientific testing, you need enough electricity to power several readers
and antennas on the very edge of your grid. For the application testing, you
need access to power and network connectivity.
Reader testing station
A reader test station is where you can test antenna patterns on the grid, cer-
tify the power output and bandwidth range, and in general play with your
readers while recording performance. Here are some tips for choosing a loca-
tion for the reader test station:
149
Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab
Protecting your gear on the go
Any equipment you think might be needed out
in the field, like signal generators and spectrum
analyzers, should be protected while en route.
The best bet is to buy a Pelican case and either
custom cut the foam or have a spray-in-foam
shop spray in foam so that the unit is well pro-
tected. Pelican cases can be checked baggage
on a plane, shipped via most overnight carriers,
and locked up when the gear is left in a ware-
house. Consider it a couple hundred dollars of
insurance for your costly lab gear. Buy the case
when you buy the electronics, and you’ll never
worry about how you’re going to get a case to
Waterloo, Iowa, in a day when you’re all the
way out in Alamo, Texas.

 The ideal location is near the network gear, so that you can store and
access important data easily.
 If one area of the lab has a concentration of power and network connec-
tivity, that’s where to put a server cabinet and create your reader test
station.
 To get the best test results, put the readers at the far end of your floor
grid if possible, as opposed to the middle. It doesn’t matter which end of
the room you choose, just as long as you can make use of the longest
distance from one end of your testing area to the other by putting the
reader at one end and a tagged object at the opposite end.
To set up the reader station, follow these steps:
1. Set up the hubs and connect them to one or two dedicated servers.
These servers are the control PCs for the readers.
2. With each reader, you get software to run the reader either as you
would in production or for test purposes. Install the software on the
reader server (a server that is dedicated to the readers and their con-
trol software).
3. Connect the hubs and servers so that if any of your readers need to be
controlled, they can all communicate via the one dedicated reader
server.
This allows you to connect multiple readers to the same server without
having to plug and unplug each one.
SKU testing station
If you start with the grid, the servers, and the readers as anchor points in
your lab, the next geographically located test station is the product or SKU
testing station. This station consists of a reader or tag testing appliance, a
single antenna, an antenna stand, an RF-friendly stand (made of dried wood
or plastic) for the product to be tested, and power access. The floor needs to
be measured, but being on the grid is not a requirement. Mark off the floor
with 1-inch increments, but a full grid is not necessary. If the station is close
enough to the server cabinet to run a couple of CAT-5 cables, that’s perfect.
Conveyor
If you have a conveyor, you should put it as far away from the static testing
area as possible. All that metal can have an unwelcome reflective effect on
your testing. Using a Cyclotron (described in Chapter 10) is a better solution,
but it still might cause enough noise to warrant separating it as far from the
test grid as possible. The ideal is a room that’s 75 feet long, which is big
enough so that a loop conveyor at one end has a minimal effect on testing at
the other end of the room.
150
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

Print-and-apply station
The last segregated area of your lab is the print-and-apply station. This station
requires relatively little power and only a few points of network connectivity.
You can run most print-and-apply solutions during other testing without
interference because print-and-apply machines are such low-power output
devices and are directionally focused.
As you begin to understand which areas need to be in close proximity to
each other, you can move the areas around to suit your needs. In general,
starting off with a lab design like the one shown in Figure 8-3 will get you off
to a good start.
Build specific test equipment
The RFID industry is so new that you can’t yet go down to your local Home
Depot and pick up a couple of RFID antenna racks; you have to build them
yourself. In the production environment, you have to think about protection,
durability, and other considerations, but in the lab environment, you need to
think about two things — portability and RF friendliness. Fortunately, the
solution is cheap and simple. In the words of The Graduate, “Plastics.”
You may wonder why PVC is on the list of must-have tools described earlier
in the chapter. The reason is that PVC is the perfect material to make antenna
racks, temporary portals, and conveyor stands. You can cut through it with a
$5 handsaw, and you can put it together and pull it apart like LEGO bricks. If
you add an assortment of connection joints, some plastic zip ties, and a bit of
heavy-duty Velcro, you’ve got the makings of most of your lab gear.

The process of building PVC antenna holders and racks is pretty self-
explanatory, so rather than give you step-by-step instructions, I’m just 
going to show you a picture of a design to hold a single antenna to give 
you the basic idea. Figure 8-4 shows the back of a PVC antenna mount on 
the testing grid.
You can make these PVC racks just about any shape or size that suits your
needs. The important thing to remember is that you are trying to simulate
the real-world environment. So if your conveyors are 12 inches off the floor,
your test stands should be 12 inches tall. And if they really are that tall, you
should let Mr. Claus know that you won’t have any problems passing OSHA
inspections, and the entire facility will be RFID-enabled by next Christmas
because of your way-cool lab.
Using the PVC material for testing apparatus does have one drawback: It can’t
hold a significant amount of weight. To test cases of items or heavy objects for
their RF suitability or for basic SKU testing, you need an RF-friendly material
that also strong enough to hold up things like a 30-pound case of SPAM or a
75-pound uninterruptible power supply (UPS). For this, nothing works like
good ol’-fashioned kiln-dried lumber. Lumber has minimal moisture content,
but for purposes of SKU testing, not enough to affect your results. And what-
ever liquid the lumber has is a consistent factor. Figure 8-5 shows a sturdy,
homemade, 2-x-2-foot SKU testing bench about countertop high.

Develop and implement standardized 
test procedures
When you’re done setting up the lab, it’s time to document your testing pro-
cedures. The purpose of documenting your testing procedures is to ensure
that any new lab rat you hire can perform a test and compare the results with
a test that someone else did six months or six years ago. In addition to being
able to compare testing results, documentation enables new folks to get up to
speed quickly on how things are done.
In your RFID lab, you can perform tests for an infinite number of purposes.
However, to start with, perform the following four tests to quickly address
some common issues:
 Antenna patterning test
 Reader performance test (for distance, speed, and accuracy)
 SKU test
 Tag characterization test
Antenna patterning and reader performance tests are performed in the area
of the lab with the floor grid. SKU testing and tag characterization can take

153
Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab

place in the area with the least amount of interference and likelihood of
reflection or standing waves.
The four tests you perform in the lab directly correlate to the real-world envi-
ronment. If you document your information well, you can take that data and
use it to design and select your final system.
Antenna patterning test
This simplest test, perhaps the most insightful for those new to RFID technol-
ogy, is to pattern an antenna and reader by following these steps:
1. Set up a reader with factory default settings and attach a single trans-
mit and receive antenna to the reader.
Mount the antenna to your PVC antenna stand or to a camera tripod at
the edge of the grid. The top of the antenna should be roughly 4 feet off
the ground, and if you dropped a plumb line straight down from the
front face of the antenna, you should be right on one of the grid lines.
See Chapter 10 for more on installing readers and antennas.
2. Mount an RFID tag on a piece of cardboard attached to a tripod or
PVC stand at the same height as the antenna that you set up in Step 1.
3. Start reading the tag at the grid line 1 foot away from the antenna.
Begin reading the tag directly in front of the antenna and then move
it in 6-inch increments to each side until the reader no longer regis-
ters a read.
The tag should stay one grid line away from the antenna the whole time,
but you move it away from the center line.
4. Record the location of the last successful read to get the outward limit
of the interrogation zone at 1 foot away.
5. Now bring the tag back to directly in front of the antenna, but move it
another foot away so that you’re on the 2-foot grid line. Move the tag
laterally along the grid line in 6-inch increments until you can’t get any
more reads, and then record the location of the last successful read.
6. Continue with each grid line until you can’t get a read directly in
front of the antenna or you run out of space.
7. Change the power settings on the reader and repeat Steps 3 through
6. Record the results and note the difference that varying the power
level has on creating an interrogation zone pattern.
When you’re done, you have a graphical representation of an antenna pattern.
The more places where you find that point between reads and no reads, the
more accurate your pattern will be. You may also notice that something in
your lab is distorting the perfect shape. If the shape of the antenna pattern is
not symmetrical, look for potential causes, like a metal server rack or metal
154
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

door frame. The only way to fix this is to remove the objects causing any
potential distortion. Figure 8-6 shows a lab test result compared with the
actual antenna field in a perfect environment.
This test gives you a good understanding of what the interrogation zone or
RF bubble will look like. With this knowledge, you will know what the pattern
will be in the real world. With the data from your antenna testing, coupled with
the RF path loss contour map discussed in Chapter 7, you can decide what
antenna you should use and what the power setting on the reader should be.
The antenna patterning test helps you design a much more accurate and
effective system than you’d get by trial and error.
Reader performance test
Reader performance testing is the Super Bowl of lab work. It’s exciting, it
changes with every new piece of hardware that comes out, and after a while,
you start to develop your own favorites. Chapter 10 gives you the complete
rundown on how to test reader performance. The reader performance testing
and the information about factors like connectivity and control discussed in
Chapter 10 help you pick the optimal reader for your needs.
SKU testing
SKU or product testing for the optimal tag and the optimal placement has
evolved into a science all its own. Here are the basic steps to SKU testing,
which are covered in much greater detail in Chapter 9:
1. Determine the five best locations to put a tag based on what you
observe about the item.

Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab

Is there a place on the case with nothing but air behind it, or some
Styrofoam packing material rather than an actual product? Are there
areas where the corrugated cardboard is double-thick, like where the
box is sealed? Those are the first two things to look for — airspace
behind where you’d affix the tag and extra thick cardboard. Refer to
Chapter 9 for additional tips on where to place tags.
2. After you determine your five test areas, figure out how many tags
you want to test in those locations.
At a minimum, you should try four tags in each location.
3. Set up a reader to separate the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)
band (902–928 MHz in most cases for U.S. applications) into individual
channels and report successful reads on each channel.
All the readers can do this, but it takes some software programming to
make the results meaningful, or a specific testing program.
4. Attach a single antenna to the reader and put it 1 foot away from the
product to be tested.
5. Record the number of successful reads divided by the number of
tries. (This gives you the probability of the item being read.)
If you don’t have the software or the programming expertise, an easy,
although much less scientific, way to test tags for their performance is
to set up the reader to record successful reads and read the item for
three minutes. Record the number of reads for each tag in each of the
five locations you identified in Step 1.
Some commercial testing applications automate the tag testing process
by breaking down the ISM band into 124 separate channels and then
reporting back the probability of success for each channel. ODIN tech-
nologies’ Trifecta software is the first software to automate this process
and is available as a Web service, so you don’t need to support another
full software application on-site. This is a much more scientific approach
than simply finding the number of reads over time.
6. Repeat Step 5 for each tag location; then repeat Steps 4 and 5 at a 3
foot and 5 foot separation from tag to antenna.
Figure 8-7 shows a screen shot from ODIN technologies’ Trifecta testing soft-
ware. The graph shows 50 of the 124 channels tested. The gray bars represent
successful tag wake-ups, and the black bars represent successful reads. Black
good, gray okay, nothing bad — got it? You can also see statistics of read suc-
cess. This testing program is a simple automated way of testing the success
of each tag and position. A program like this is particularly valuable if you
have hundreds of different SKUs to test. Commercial testing labs charge
between $1,000 and $3,000 per SKU depending on the quality of the testing
and the usefulness of the data. It is easy to see how an in-house lab with some
quality testing software can quickly pay for itself.
156
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

The SKU or product testing is one step toward deciding what your end system
will look like. Chapter 9 walks you through the specifics of tag selection and
testing, but you have a few additional decisions to make:
 Do you want to get the best price from the tag suppliers by standardizing
on one design and ordering in greater quantity?
 Do you need a tag that fits in with your print-and-apply machine?
 Do you want to use specialty tags for certain items?
The SKU testing gives you the knowledge you need to make these decisions.
Tag characterization test
Tag characterization is a relatively straightforward test that helps you deter-
mine the threshold of quality from various manufacturers. You need an atten-
uator for this test. Follow these steps to run the test:
1. Hook up a reader to a single antenna, through an attenuator, and
back into the reader.
2. Mount the antenna 2 feet away from a flat surface like your SKU test-
ing stand.

157
Chapter 8: Testing One, Two, Three: Developing Your Own Lab

You need to mount the antenna above the stand and point it toward 
the ground.
3. To characterize a certain type of tag, gather at least 100 of the same
type of tags.
4. Test the tags one at a time under the antenna for readability. Slowly
turn down or “attenuate” the signal until the tag can no longer be
read and record the results.
5. When you have complete data for 100 tags, set the antenna up on the
edge of your grid that’s furthest from the direction you will be posi-
tioning the tag, so you can get as far away from the reader as possible.
6. Test several of the tags, one at a time, that were of the highest attenua-
tion value and see how far they can be read and then repeat the
process for each of the different tag attenuation values.
The tag characterization test resolves one of the biggest issues you’re likely
to face if you use an automated print-and-apply solution: the lack of standard-
ized quality from tag vendors. For example, a print-and-apply machine might
be able to read a particular tag if it’s a few inches away from the antenna, but
might not be able to read it from a foot away or at a high speed because the
chip is poorly mounted to the antenna.
The only way to tell the good tags from the bad tags is to characterize the
quality of various tags and understand the lowest performance threshold
that is acceptable given your mandates. In other words, if you know a tag
attenuated to a certain point can’t be read beyond a foot, you want to set up
a verification station after your print-and-apply station (or work with the
print-and-apply vendor) attenuated down to the lowest threshold acceptable.
By using the tag characterization data to set up a verification station, you can
stop bad tags from being shipped out to your clients and not getting read. If
all your tags are read, you get paid quicker and with less hassle by folks like
the Department of Defense (DoD), Wal-Mart, Target, and others.
Additional tests
The four tests that I describe in this chapter give you great insight into the
performance and characteristics of RFID systems. You can add more tests as
you put your creativity to work and as you graduate up the learning curve.
Eventually, you will develop tests that are unique to your application or pro-
duction environment. If you’re tracking top-secret hard drives covertly, for
example, you may want to test how antennas perform when they are behind
sheetrock or how tags perform at different orientations. If you’re producing
roller skates, you may end up slicing up a standard tag and experimenting
with ways of affixing the tag onto the boot. Creativity and repeatability are
the keys to good experiments.

.C. Fields’ constant search for the 25-cent cigar is second only to
Linda Dillman’s search for a 5-cent RFID tag. Dillman, as the CIO of
Wal-Mart, has been hounded by suppliers implementing RFID who claim that
the only positive ROI comes with a 5-cent tag. Although this might be true for
companies that count their product margins in fractions of pennies, many
current RFID implementations demonstrate acceptable ROI using today’s
tags, which range in price from 22 to 50 cents each. The trick is knowing the
difference between tags and how they interact in your inventory environment
so that — regardless of price — you can make the right decision for your
organization.
Think of choosing the best tags for an RFID system as picking the right bat to
play a game of baseball. (Without a bat, there’s just not much point in play-
ing, but you can’t just go out and grab any ol’ hunk of wood.) You need to
evaluate the bat’s attributes, try it out in batting practice, and see how it fits
with your swing if you want to hit ’em over the fence. The same is true for
tags — you have to test them in their working environment to get successful
results from your RFID system.
The ideal RFID system automates any counting function such as shipping,
receiving, picking products for shipment, asset management, security, and so
on. It does this by capturing data without line of sight. Although RFID promises
to achieve this automated, non-line-of-sight communication, in many cases

this communication succeeds only through careful tuning of key system para-
meters, including tag selection and placement, reader selection and configura-
tion, interrogation antenna selection, and a thorough understanding of the
environment. This chapter deals with the tag-selection-and-placement parame-
ter, specifically with testing tags on difficult-to-read items.
In this chapter, you find out how the right tags help you get better read
ranges and rates and improve the efficiency of your RFID network. You also
discover why different products make tags behave in unique ways and the
implications of these unusual behaviors as you create your system architec-
ture. A little bit of understanding of tags goes a long way, whether you do the
work yourself or enlist a third party to do it for you.
Ready, Set, Test!
The biggest error many people make when setting off on an RFID program is
thinking that a single solution will work well for every situation. Unfortunately,
there is no silver bullet. RFID systems are always custom designed for both
the environment and the properties of the item to be tagged. Getting the right
tags for various products is a critical and ongoing process; you may find that
the optimal tags and their placement change as you change inventory and as
the technology evolves and prices change. The first step to finding the right
solution is to test the items that you will be tagging (or to have someone test
them for you). A good assortment of tags to test and a rigorous methodology
get you the answers you need to build a good RFID network. The two primary
ways of testing for proper tags and placement are
 Application testing (also known as trial and error) using a conveyor or
dock door.
 Scientific static testing to evaluate the way a product is affected in an RF
field.
A solid testing procedure, as in any data-gathering exercise, is required.
Figure 9-1 shows the three critical steps for incorporating tag testing into
your organization and the factors influencing those different steps:
 Product assessment: Determines the optimal areas to place a tag to be
tested, so you don’t need to cover every inch of every product with each
different tag. You can base this assessment on a tester’s experience using
a method like the RF pyramid I show later in the chapter, or you can use
an automated RF Visualizer to show a product’s various RF-friendly areas.
This step tells you where the best place to test is — essentially it helps
you find the sweet spot.
 Product testing: After determining the five or six sweet spots on the
product that look optimal for testing tags, you need to choose the tags
you plan to test, document the test locations, conduct the tests, and
160
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

then determine the best performing tag. For purposes of comparison,
you should record the performance measures specified in a universal
and scientific manner such as using the ODIN tag performance index (or
TPI) for each tag, location, and orientation. See “The ODIN tag perfor-
mance index” sidebar later in this chapter. In order to test tags effec-
tively, you need an RF-friendly location without ambient electronic
noise, testing hardware, and (to make life easy) testing software that
produces efficient and easy-to-understand results across the entire fre-
quency band.
 Employee training: Incorporates tag testing into your normal inventory
processes by making sure that you have a system in place and docu-
mented procedures that can be taught to end-users simply and con-
cisely. Manufacturing employees or packaging workers are the likely
recipients of your product-testing training, so keep their needs in mind
when designing your program. And create a user’s manual for your test-
ing process that appropriately addresses this intended audience.
Chapter 13 discusses user training in more detail.
Tag testing must isolate the performance of the tags for a given orientation
(vertical, horizontal, random) and location on the case (top, back, side). Tag
testing should not be a test of reader performance, antennas, or any other
variable. The tag is the only thing that should vary during the testing. Keep this
in mind when designing your testing methodology because the software on
readers can vary results greatly, and some automated methods don’t test
beyond one or two channels in the ISM UHF band. (There are 124 channels,
and you need to know the performance across the whole band.)
Recently, my company demonstrated the use of Trifecta for a client. Trifecta
is an ODIN technologies software tool designed to simply and accurately pro-
vide a tag performance index so tags can be compared universally across the
frequency band. I tested one of the client’s difficult-to-read SKUs, which was
attached to an item with a high water content. The client wanted to know

Chapter 9: Tag, You're It: Testing for Best Tag Design and Placement

why the RFID system was performing poorly. The problem turned out to be
that the tag was not positioned in the optimal location. The client assumed
that because the interrogation antenna had line of sight with the tag, he
would instantly achieve perfect performance. I explained that with difficult-
to-read objects, tag testing has to be done in order to be successful with
RFID. The software helped me locate the optimal placement and orientation,
illustrating that moving a tag even a few centimeters in one direction or
another can make a huge difference in performance. Furthermore, I used the
ODIN TPI to compare results from various locations and show that careful
testing (leading to better tag placement and orientation) could improve a 
30 percent successful-read result to a workable 82 percent result.
Looking at the Material Composition 
of the Items You’re Tagging
Before you begin the actual testing, you need to consider some of the para-
meters that impact the behavior of the tags and their response to the fre-
quency you’re using. Here are the four principal effects that material can
have on an RF signal and, therefore, on a tag:
 Absorption: Some materials absorb the energy of the direct wave propa-
gating out of the reader’s antenna. This situation is also known as loss, a
term accurately describing that, with absorption, there is less power
available to get a signal back from the tag.
 Reflection/refraction: Ideally, the tag receives a direct wave from the
interrogating antenna, but sometimes, material around the tag can
reflect or refract that direct wave. Then the tag receives the reflected or
refracted wave, which may look different than the original direct wave.
 Dielectric effects: When a dielectric material is close to the tag, the 
electric-field concentration can be multiplied and result in a detuning
effect on the tag’s antenna.
 Complex propagation effects: These effects exist because of two phe-
nomena that work together in your RFID system to interfere with its suc-
cessful communication. The phenomena are
• Standing waves, or waves different from the direct wave you’re
trying to get to the tag.
• Multi-pathing, which is caused by the standing waves and can
cancel out the direct wave altogether.
162
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

The direct wave going to the tag from the reader antenna is a uniform
wave. If another wave of the same size (a standing wave) is coming in
the opposite direction exactly half a wave ahead or behind the direct
wave, it will cancel out the direct wave.
Many materials being tagged today are packaged in corrugated cardboard
boxes. Cardboard is permeable to RF waves and, therefore, has little effect 
on the behavior of the RF waves. But the material makeup of what’s inside
the box has a direct impact on how the RF waves behave.
Examining RF transparent, reflecting, 
and absorbing materials
Objects can exhibit a wide range of behavior characteristics in relation to RF
that is dependent on their material composition. An object can be RF trans-
parent, RF reflecting, or RF absorbing. Most objects exhibit some combina-
tion of the three. The following list examines the behavior of two common
material types:
 Metallic: Metallic items are the most likely to be RF reflecting. The tag
does not absorb enough power from the reader because the metallic
item either shields or detunes the tag’s antenna from its resonance fre-
quency so that the antenna cannot absorb enough energy to power up.
Metal is a difficult item to tag, but tags placed directly on metal can work
well if they are specifically tuned. It is possible to use a metallic item as
a backplane, or part of the antenna itself.
 Liquid: Liquid materials — like water, shampoo, saline solution, and the
like — are RF absorbing. They absorb RF waves and eat up all the poten-
tial energy a tag needs. They reduce the strength of the original signal by
absorbing or dissipating the power, again causing the tag to have insuffi-
cient energy to power up and backscatter information to the reader.
However, not all liquids are created equal: Water reacts much differently
than something like oil, for instance.
Table 9-1 shows the behaviors of different types of materials and their effects
on an RFID communication system.

Different product attributes cause RF waves to behave differently in an RFID
interrogation zone. The material properties of an item — the amount or con-
tent of metal, liquid, cardboard, airspace, and so on that the item possesses —
all affect the way that the RF waves react around that item. The best way to
think of it is in terms of sound waves. In an all-metal room, for example, you
hear echoes and strange noises because the sound waves bounce off the
metal. In a sound studio with cushy material lining the walls, sound is dead-
ened as soon as it hits the walls. RF waves behave in a similar manner.
A combination of metallic and liquid materials can cause the items being
tagged to absorb, shield, and reflect RF waves in a variety of different ways.
For example, think of a case of salsa, a heavily liquid product stored in glass
bottles with metal lids. All sorts of funky things happen in the RF world when
you’re tagging salsa. That is, reflected waves bounce off the metal, waves
absorb into the liquid, and a general calamity of propagation effects make
tagging a real challenge.
What you need to be concerned with is how those RF waves behave around the
tag and how the materials close to the tag affect the waves’ behavior. Figure 9-2
illustrates how two different cases of product behave in an RF field. The prod-
uct on the left has a consistent and uniform behavior in the lines representing
the RFID reflection and is representative of a case of paper towels. The product
on the right is representative of a case with liquid absorbing the waves, glass
attenuating them, and metal caps reflecting them. A product like the one
shown on the right is much more challenging to tag because there are fewer
areas where the tag can effectively couple with the signal. The dips in the
lines around the case are called nulls, where there is little or no RF energy. A
tag placed near one of those nulls will not read effectively.
Using the RF friendliness pyramid to
understand the optimal spot for testing
I was fortunate enough to be part of the RFID Expert Group (REG) for AIM
Global (The Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility), and we
164
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

came up with the RFID friendliness pyramid as a way of representing proper-
ties of cases that contain various objects. Figure 9-3 shows the pyramid.
The RFID pyramid is useful for determining how things should be tagged and,
to a certain extent, where. The higher up the pyramid you go, the more stable
the RFID performance is. For example, a cardboard box full of bubble wrap,
which would be classified at the top of the pyramid, is easy to tag and read.
The peak of the pyramid implies that the material is RF-transparent and is
similar to reading a tag in free air.
You can also use the pyramid to help you determine the optimal location to
begin testing. In a typical case, you should be able to choose the top four or
five locations to test based on basic knowledge of the laws of electromagnet-
ism discussed in Chapter 5. If the object you want to tag is made up of many
items with various RF properties, you can rate the various parts of the object
based on their RF friendliness by using the pyramid.
To determine the best spot for testing, follow these steps:
1. Determine whether the outside packaging material is RF transparent.
If the packaging material is a corrugated cardboard box, it is RF trans-
parent. If the packaging contains metal, it’s not RF transparent. You need

to use packaging that is mostly RF transparent to get successful reads,
or you need to use tags specially made for metal.
2. If the packaging material is RF transparent, open the container and
visually inspect the contents.
What you’re likely to find is a mixture of reflective and absorbing materi-
als. For instance, if you open a case of deodorant, the label on the
deodorant may be metallic, surrounding the bulk of the product, which
is a liquid-based aluminum oxide material. The caps and bottoms are all
plastic and free space, and there may be some packaging material at the
top to protect them.
3. Determine where the contents fit on the RF pyramid.
For the deodorant example, the metallic labels would be in the lower-
right corner of the pyramid because they are likely to be very reflective.
The combination of liquid and aluminum would be in the middle near
the bottom because it is both absorbing and reflecting.
4. Rank eight or ten different areas of the object on their positions in the
RFID pyramid based on how close to the peak they are.
5. Start your tag testing by using the highest ranked (most RF-friendly)
areas.
For example, on the case of deodorant, start the testing with the plastic
caps or bottoms, near the top or bottom of the case. The top would also
likely have some air space and provide a good spot for placing a tag.
Anyplace there is extra cardboard material (like where the box top gets
folded over and glued on a typical case) is also likely to provide extra insula-
tion from any RF unfriendly material on the inside.
There is no silver bullet in RFID. Vendors who promise “RFID-in-a-box” or an
instant slap-and-ship solution are selling you short. Many people have made
the mistake of buying one of these solutions that may have reader x, tag y,
and a certain middleware component. When they install the system and slap
a tag somewhere on an item, particularly if the item is RF unfriendly, the
system doesn’t work. When this happens, people tend to blame the technol-
ogy and say that RF is immature. The truth is that the users do not have a
fundamental grasp of the physics of RFID and have not tailored a solution for
their needs. Only by first assessing the environment and then testing the
product to be tagged can you choose the right readers and tags.
Choosing a Tag to Test
Tags are not all created equal. In my testing of all the major tag manufactur-
ers, I’ve found a wide (and wild) variance in production quality from tag to
tag and from batch to batch. When I do any kind of tag testing, I make sure
166
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

that I’m using a normal tag — that is, a tag that’s squarely in the middle of the
known performance of the tag type, not one that performs poorly or one that
is extra-sensitive. To find out what average is, I use the link margin test devel-
oped at ODIN technologies labs to qualify tags as normal. Communications
link margin refers to the amount of power that can be removed from the RF
signal before communication is no longer interpretable.
Some tags couple with RF fields better than others. You can quantify a tag’s
RF coupling capacity and power efficiency by gradually reducing the strength
of a readers’ signal and recording the amount of power that must be removed
to disable the communications channel. This link margin test quantifies how
tags of the same type compare at extracting, consuming, and reflecting RF
power. Tags with high link margin thresholds require less power to operate
and therefore display superior read range and reliability.
To perform link margin testing, you need a device called a radial attenuator
or software that can reduce the power automatically coming out of the tag.
The radial attenuator is used to manually reduce the power in the receive
path of the reader. You connect it to the transmit (Tx) coax cable between
the circularly polarized interrogation antenna and the reader. This attenuator
reduces the amplitude of an RF signal without affecting the waveform’s
phase, frequency, or shape in a significant way. The result is a direct relation-
ship between attenuation and link margin: the higher the attenuation needed,
the larger the link margin and the stronger the tag.
To get a statistically significant result, you need to test 100 tags of each type.
It’s easiest if you set up an antenna a few feet above a table where you put
each tag to be tested — kind of like a big light hanging above an operating
table. After setting up your test system (the radial attenuator between the
interrogation antenna and the reader), follow these steps to perform the link
margin test for each tag:
1. Activate the reader and set the attenuator to its lowest output level.
2. Place a single tag in the field generated by the reader in autoread
mode.
3. Manually adjust the attenuator to increase its power drain on the
signal returning from the tag.
As the attenuation increases, the read rate gradually diminishes to a spe-
cific threshold, which you need to record for each tag.
4. When the tag no longer can be read, record the corresponding value
on the attenuator for the tag you’re testing.
Use a permanent felt-tip pen to number the tag and write down the tag
number and the attenuation value on your test record.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for all 100 tags.
167
Chapter 9: Tag, You're It: Testing for Best Tag Design and Placement

6. Calculate the average attenuation value and standard deviation for
the 100 tags tested.
The easiest way to track and analyze the data is to set up an Excel
spreadsheet with the numbers 1 through 100 in their own cells descend-
ing in a column. To the right of each number, put their corresponding
attenuation value. This enables you to highlight all the attenuation
values and use both the average function, =average(data cells), and
the standard deviation, =stdev(data cells). The average attenuation
value becomes the basis for selecting the tags to use in your application
testing.
7. Go back to your stash of tested tags and pull out a bunch of tags that
have a tested attenuation value that is the same as the calculated aver-
age. Also, record the standard deviation for the different tags you are
testing.
The higher the standard deviation, the lower quality the tags and the
more variability there will be in their performance.
These chosen few are your application test tags. Now you’re guaranteed
that you don’t have tags that are way better or way worse than the aver-
age tag you can expect.
Testing Tags in an Applications 
Test Facility
Many end users and integrators have developed applications test facilities.
Typically, these facilities include
 A circular conveyor equipped with multiple read stations: Cases of the
product being tested are tagged and carried around a conveyor at vari-
ous speeds. During their journey, the demonstration software provided
by the reader vendor records the total number of successful reads exe-
cuted by each reader. The test process repeats for each tag and each
position of interest to the client. Using this testing method is acceptable
only if you know (and duplicate) the exact setup where the product will
actually be read, which, based on the simple rules of physics, is almost
impossible to do. The configuration, reader type, antenna choice, con-
veyor type and construction, and software all affect read rates.
 The dock door simulation: Typically, four interrogation antennas are
mounted on a portal measuring about 10 feet x 10 feet. A pallet of tagged
product moves through the field, and the test equipment setup records
the total number of successful reads. More advanced labs have software
that depicts not only the total number of cases read but also where on
the pallet the cases were read, making pallet optimization more efficient.
168
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

Because no single standard reader setup, conveyor, or dock door configura-
tion covers every use, each application testing facility will be a little different.
A standardized testing process is difficult when there are so many different
random variables. These factors make application testing a poor way of test-
ing, and you should use it only for validation of other test results because a
battery of tests is more accurate than one specific test. Here’s another draw-
back: If you’re testing with your own setup, you can’t call your buddy at a dif-
ferent company and compare your results.
The sections that follow give you the lowdown on how to carry out tag test-
ing in a more scientific manner. In order to get the optimal performance when
using an application test, you should follow a structured process, even if you

The ODIN tag performance index (TPI)
In the past five years, the Auto-ID lab at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
has led the way in testing and design of RFID
systems, and ODIN technologies has extended
that research and testing into the commercial
world with the help of the current director of the
Auto-ID Labs, Dr. Daniel Engels. Both organiza-
tions and many end users have a mutual goal of
creating a common method for testing tag per-
formance and comparing results. ODIN tech-
nologies is leading the effort to create a
specification that the industry can talk about
with common vernacular. This specification is
called the tag performance index, or TPI.
The TPI is a method of gauging tag performance
via three critical performance measures across
all channels in a particular frequency band (124
channels can be isolated in the 902–928 MHz
band, for instance):
 Percent of successful reads
 Dispersion of reads across the ISM band
 Ratio of nulls, or poor performers, to suc-
cessful reads
After these measurements are taken, they are
entered into a simple formula that yields a TPI,
which can range from 0 to 100. The TPI is a
proxy for how well a tag will perform in a real
world situation. It is the only effective way of
knowing the effects of de-tuning by material
type on tag performance.
The TPI is useful for several reasons, but most
importantly, it identifies the threshold of perfor-
mance to meet particular application require-
ments. For instance, a retailer can use the TPI to
create a mandate for its suppliers. Rather than
issuing a non-scientific or non-measurable stan-
dard — such as, the pallet tag needs to be read
going through a ten foot dock door or on a 600 fpm
conveyor — the retailer can require that all cases
have a tag and tag placement combination TPI
measurement that is equal to or greater than 70.
The TPI can also allow tag manufacturers to
create a common way of comparing tag perfor-
mance across varying frequencies and chip
designs, and on differing products. The use of
this measurement will further promote packag-
ing designs with a known TPI specification.
The other methods used to test tags — appli-
cation testing and power attenuation — fall
short of creating a system that accounts for per-
formance across a wide band of frequency,
works in any country at any frequency, ignores
reader firmware and power, and is affordable
and accessible to all end-users. The TPI creates
a spec that economically allows users to test
multiple combinations and permutations and is
grounded in a very scientific methodology.

don’t have a full-scale lab. Using ISO methods 18046 and 18047 for confor-
mance measurements is helpful. The ISO method is important to make sure
that you can repeat your testing results and that you have a documented pro-
cedure. The problem with application testing, however, occurs when you
can’t really isolate one variable to be tested because you can never be sure
what might be causing the difference in performance between one test and
another.
Setting up the testing environment
If you have a large open area (either indoors or outside) with little or no
ambient electromagnetic noise (or AEN, as determined by the testing
methodology in Chapter 7), you can set up your tag testing environment in
that area. Here’s the equipment you need to set up the environment:
 A fixed-mount RFID reader and single circularly polarized antenna
attached to a tripod or antenna holder like the ones shown in Chapter 7.
The reader should be connected to 
 A tag testing software capable of characterizing the frequency
response at each channel in the band you are testing (most likely
902–928 MHz) loaded onto a controlling PC with software.
 A wooden or plastic table suitable for holding the items to be tested.
The table should be the same height as the interrogating antenna.
 A tape measure for marking out several distances.
Follow these steps to set up your test system:
1. Position the antenna and reader at least 25 feet from any obstructions
that may interfere with the interrogation zone.
2. Mount the antenna approximately 3 feet off the ground in a fixed 
location.
3. Mark off 1-foot measurements heading directly out from the antenna.
4. Position the table with the tagged product directly in front of the
antenna, 1 foot away.
You then move the tagged product sitting on the table out to 3 and 5 feet
to compare tag performance.
Carrying out the test
You measure the effect of different placements and tag types as they are
affected by the internal contents of the product, or SKU, you are testing. You
can do this in three ways:
170
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

 Use the tag testing software to gather a frequency response characteri-
zation (FRC), described in more detail later in the chapter, at the three
different distances — 1, 3, and 5 feet. Then calculate a tag performance
index (TPI) as discussed in the sidebar.
 Move the tagged object farther and farther away until it cannot be read
and then compare different distances with each other.
 Take reader threshold power measurements (explained below). This
helps overcome the issue of reader software, which can vary from
reader to reader.
Using the reader power threshold is a good way to determine the quality of
the tag and tag placement, but results can vary from reader to reader and
location to location. It is a good method if you can do all your testing at the
same time and only need to know relative performance, but keep in mind dif-
ferent readers will affect the results in different ways. To do this, start with
the maximum power and then monitor the percent of good reads as the
power is slowly and incrementally reduced:
 Record the power threshold value in dB at full power. Record the same
number of reads per minute — or if you are testing on a conveyor, reads
per pass — that you get for each successively lower dB increment.
Record the final dB value where you were able to get a successful read.
 In a given test, the best result is the lowest power level you can obtain
and still achieve accurate read results.
 Map out the results of your testing in a matrix (or table), which shows
the location of the tag and the results from the testing. I use the upper-
left corner as the 0 point on an x-y axis. This allows simple comparison
of data.
Frequency Response Characterization:
Testing Tags with Physics
A more scientific approach than a specific application test (described in the
preceding section) revolves around
 Understanding how an RFID reader interrogates (communicates with) 
a tag
 Being able to record performance of specific tags by using those commu-
nication principles that drive reader performance
 Eliminating all the variables that affect read results except the tag type
171
Chapter 9: Tag, You're It: Testing for Best Tag Design and Placement

RFID readers hop from frequency to frequency within the UHF ISM band
(902–928 MHz in the United States) using a pseudo-random sequence. (If
you’ve ever watched a physicist dance, that defines pseudo-random.) By hop-
ping randomly between frequencies, it’s unlikely that two readers will try to
communicate on the same frequency simultaneously, thereby avoiding inter-
ference. It’s kind of like when your spouse keeps your mother-in-law out of
the garage — no interaction means no interference.
However, due to the material properties of both the tags and the items 
(see the section “Looking at the Material Composition of the Items You’re
Tagging,” earlier in the chapter), each product/tag combination may have a
frequency preference. In fact, some product/tag combinations simply don’t
work in certain frequency channels. So identifying a combination that works
well across the entire RFID spectrum of choice is important, which is pre-
cisely what frequency response characterization does. Rather than relying 
on large pieces of hardware to move products through an interrogation field, 
frequency response characterization uses intelligent software to control the
single parameter that matters most in RFID: the radio frequency. (Hey, you
know it’s important because this variable constitutes half the acronym.)
It is possible to build such a software tool yourself if you understand the inter-
face of a signal generator, spectrum analyzer, or reader, and if you have experi-
ence with RFID readers and coding principles. However, it is much simpler to
invest in a commercially available tool like ODIN technologies’ Trifecta or to
have a certified test lab figure out the characterization of each of your prod-
ucts. If you decide to build a tool yourself, the critical component is the capa-
bility to isolate the reader’s performance and test it to statistical significance
over each channel in your chosen band. You can then compare the results from
each test at various distances to determine the best tag and location. Table 9-2
shows the results of an internal test across all the channels, comparing three
different tags.

Trifecta, from ODIN technologies, is an example of a commercially available
tool that can perform this type of test. It uses frequency response characteri-
zation to discover the perfect tag selection, position, and orientation. The
testing protocol consists of placing a stationary product in front of the inter-
rogation antenna connected to a Trifecta server. The user simply clicks a
button in the software to launch a test, which breaks down the RFID spec-
trum into 124 different channels, picks 50 channels at random, and issues 100
read commands on each channel. A few seconds later, the test is complete,
and Trifecta produces the statistical information shown in Figure 9-4, report-
ing the number of successful read cycles executed on each channel (lighter
gray bars) and the number of successful tag wake-ups (darker gray bars),
which quantifies tag performance across the entire RFID band.

Encoding and Applying Tags
After you determine which tag position is best for each of your SKUs, it’s time
to figure out how to encode and apply your tag to a case or pallet in your pro-
duction environment. This is an important question that impacts existing
business processes, physical layout, and information technology systems.
The next few sections detail some common approaches to encoding and
applying tags.
Tag and ship
RFID technology is foreign to most companies currently working to comply
with an EPC mandate. For this reason, many companies have opted to forego
any potential return on investment in pursuit of EPC compliance alone. As
such, Tag and ship represents a minimalist approach to RFID. It typically
involves little to no software integration with existing applications and trades
off a large capital investment (driven by hardware and software) for high
labor costs into the future.
Tag and ship often takes place in the staging area of a warehouse. Several
options exist for how pallets are unloaded, how tags are encoded and applied
to each case, and how pallets are rebuilt.
Your options for encoding tags are as follows:
 Preapplication: The most common method is to use an RFID-enabled
bar code printer to encode the data on the tag before it’s applied to a
case or pallet. These printers automatically test each RFID tag and write
the EPC data to the tag before it’s printed. This is by far the most reli-
able approach to tag encoding. It is important to select a printer that
uses a communications protocol that is compatible with the tag you
have selected (Class 0, 0+, or 1, for example).
 Post-application: You can use an RFID reader to encode data on the tag
after the tag has been applied to a case or pallet. This is risky, however.
Writing to RFID tags requires significantly more power and time than
reading them, and the materials in the field can have an adverse effect
on the reader’s ability to write to the tag. The time constraints can also
have an adverse impact on current conveyor speed.
You can apply tags in the following ways:
 Manual application: Many companies have opted to manually apply 
EPC tags to the products they ship to customers who require them,
especially when the product is shipped in small quantities. Beware:
Your SKU testing may reveal that some tag and product combinations
require high-precision application. I’ve worked with SKUs that show 
174
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

dramatically poorer performance based on a 1⁄2-inch difference in posi-
tion, and warehouse workers are not commonly known for this degree of
precision. Having tags applied manually is also sometimes referred to as
slap and ship for the imprecision of the method.
 Automatic application: For the tag/SKU combination that requires high
precision or for high-volume throughput, automatic applicators are the
right solution. They consistently place labels within a 1-mm target and
integrate tag-encoding functionality as well.
These are your choices for rebuilding pallets:
 The manual approach: Workers manually take cases off the pallet and
place them on the floor. Then they manually apply the tags and rebuild
the pallet.
 Reversible conveyor: Some companies manually depalletize products
onto a reversible conveyor (usually “S” or “U” shaped). After RFID tags
are encoded and applied (manually or automatically), the conveyor is
placed in reverse, and the pallet is rebuilt in the reverse order it was
loaded onto the conveyor. This reverse process makes sure that the
pallet is built the same way it was originally packed. To minimize the
required floor space, the conveyor can take on a zigzag shape like the
one shown in Figure 9-5, which I deployed at a warehouse in Texas.

Inline production application
Tag and ship (described in the preceding section) is labor-intensive, so
unless you ship products to your own warehouse, Tag and ship is merely a
cost of doing business with no tangible return on investment (ROI — for the
bean counters). The best way to begin testing and potentially realizing an
RFID-based ROI is for the tag application process to migrate upstream into
the production line. This technique offers the following benefits:
 Eliminates the need to break down and rebuild pallets in the warehouse
staging area
 Supports the possibility of automatically tracking work in process
 Helps create better controls for companies fulfilling orders from inven-
tory and then manufacturing to those order volumes
 May bring greater speed and accuracy to quality assurance and shipping
processes
Despite these rosy attributes, you have to overcome several challenges as
well:
 You must integrate an automated applicator into an existing production
line, which requires some space on the manufacturing line.
 It’s likely that you’ll have to tag every product coming off the line, unless
each line is reconfigured on a job basis (by running 1,000 cases at a time
for a Wal-Mart order, for example).
For this approach to make the most sense, it’s important to negotiate with
the customer who has issued the EPC mandate to tag full pallet loads of a few
SKUs only, rather than mixed pallets composed of many SKUs. Many compa-
nies have been successful in this approach. Although after just a few years,
all products are likely to have EPC tags affixed to them and this distinction
will become irrelevant.
Inline production software integration can occur on many different levels. The
primary system’s goal in a pilot situation, which inline application makes pos-
sible, is to gather valuable statistical data about the potential impact on stan-
dard warehouse operations. (For example, RFID might reduce picking time by
30 percent, streamline put away by 15 percent, and reduce order lead time by
12 hours.) Chapter 3 talks about the various business processes that may ben-
efit from an RFID system. Conducting a pilot RFID project provides a firm foun-
dation on which to base the business case for a more extensive rollout and
integration of RFID infrastructure with existing legacy software systems.
176
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

In Chapter 15, I walk you through a nine-step approach to business case
analysis. This analysis is much more accurate when supplied with real-world
data that you learn from first piloting an RFID program in-house. Rather than
installing RFID readers at all 30 dock doors in a warehouse, for example, you
can take a more measured approach. By installing one reader at a receiving
door and one on an outbound door, you can probe the potential of RFID and
EPC compliance without making a huge capital investment. This approach
also enables you to make the necessary adjustments to existing business
processes and give your executives the opportunity to become comfortable
with the large price tag of a full-scale deployment (usually several million dol-
lars by the time data integration is considered).
The Secrets of Read Success
Techies are renowned for feverishly scribbling down notes on napkins when
they have great new ideas, only to find them unreadable a day later when
pulled out of their jacket pocket. Don’t let this happen in your RFID deploy-
ment! Just because you’ve discovered the best tag and position for your
product does not mean that your reader system is properly configured to
read it. The following sections explore some common problems and tried-
and-true solutions to ensure maximum read success.
Avoiding cross talk
Cross talk occurs when tags are detected by two or more readers responsible
for monitoring different physical areas. This causes confusion when the data
must be correlated to a specific dock door. In general, cross talk is caused by
excessive signal strength, poor tuning of interrogation antennas, and poor
reader configuration. Reading the same tags from multiple dock doors is typi-
cally unacceptable and must be designed out of the system.
Readers have varying degrees of tunability, which refers to a designer’s ability
to program a reader’s performance characteristics. Fortunately, Generation
2.0 of the EPC protocol incorporates a special technology for a dense reader
environment and eliminates many issues around tenability. Unfortunately,
Gen 2.0 readers are not likely to be available until the end of 2005. In the
meantime, here are some ways you may be able to avoid cross talk:
 Adjust the power output. Readers often provide the capability to 
adjust power output, thereby tuning the shape of the field emitted by
interrogation antennas and preventing interaction with adjacent sys-
tems. Unfortunately, some materials require strong signal strength to
penetrate and read the inner cases of a pallet. In these instances, you
must use some other method to shape the field and avoid reader cross
talk.
177
Chapter 9: Tag, You're It: Testing for Best Tag Design and Placement

 Utilize reader triggering. This approach is more expensive and com-
plex. Generally, a light beam is used to detect motion through a dock
door. When motion is detected, the reader is activated, and the tag data
is captured. This approach eliminates unnecessary radiation in the envi-
ronment by powering down the field emitted by the reader when it’s no
longer needed. This technique typically adds $100 to $300 in hardware
costs and often involves integrating a programmable logic controller
(PLC).
 Use software to coordinate readers. In Chapter 11, I talk about the
attributes of various middleware providers. Some of these companies
are working on products to coordinate multiple readers, phasing their
transmit and receive timing so that readers in close proximity do not
interfere with each other. As of this writing, these products are not in a
production state, but they do hold promise of making dense reader
deployments easier.
Ensuring high-speed reads
Certain mandates require that tagged cases be readable on a conveyor at
speeds up to 600 feet per minute (fpm). This rapid rate can be particularly
challenging for difficult-to-read objects. Here are some ways that you may be
able to solve this problem:
 Tune the reader acquisition mode. Readers provide varying degrees of
control for how a read command can be structured. In a high-speed
application, it is important to ensure that the wakeup and read com-
mands are both issued rapidly, rather than just a few wakeups and many
reads.
 Change how the antennas are pointed. A common mistake is to have
antennas facing one another across a conveyor. Instead, they should be
pointing 25–45 degrees relative to the conveyor and in the direction of
conveyor motion. In this configuration, each case is in the field for a
longer time, providing more opportunity to execute a successful read
command.
Executing full pallet reads
Although no mandate currently requires 100 percent case reads on a pallet,
some internal business cases require it. It really is the next logical step for
178
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

RFID, but some products seem nearly impossible to read on a pallet. Here are
some suggestions on how to execute full pallet reads:
 Place tags on the outer cases of a pallet. When tagging cases, place the
tags on the outer cases (relative to where they are stacked on a pallet)
whenever possible. Also, try to leave an air gap between cases of prod-
uct to allow deeper penetration of RF into the pallet.
 Adjust antenna sequencing to focus RF power on challenging areas.
Most readers support four antennas to transmit their commands and
receive data back from RFID tags. These antennas are never active simul-
taneously; instead, they are multiplexed, or switched in a programmable
sequence. Readers provide varying degrees of flexibility for antenna
sequencing. Some provide a customizable order, repetition, and power
level for each antenna, making it possible to concentrate RF power on a
given corner of a pallet where penetration is consistently challenging.
 Tune the reader acquisition mode. In this situation, many tags are in
the field simultaneously and data collision becomes a potentially serious
problem. In this case, it’s important to issue many read commands for
every wakeup to ensure the data is correctly received.

magine that you had 12 months to find a partner and get married. Then
imagine that you could go to a spouse store and view a whole lineup of
potential mates, with all their good qualities listed beneath them. How easy
would it be to pick one for life? If you could walk in and say that you want a
blonde who speaks Italian and can cook Thai food, how do you think you’d
end up? How would you even know what attributes to start looking for in the
first place? And wouldn’t it bother you that none of their negative attributes
are listed? I bet you’d be bothered if your new mate turned into a giant green
ogre at every sunset. You’d at least want to know ahead of time that you
might need a bigger bed.
Although it may not be a permanent decision made “’til death do you part,”
choosing the right RFID reader is one of the most critical decisions for the
success of your RFID network. It is something that is largely underrated, par-
ticularly by those trying to sell a middleware solution. All readers, like all
spouses, are not created equal. If you need to comply with RFID by a certain
deadline, your first step is to find out what you like in a reader. This chapter
explains some of the practical attributes of RFID readers and what the impli-
cations of those attributes are for your system decision. I also jumpstart your

dating lessons by telling you how to avoid the bad readers and how to separate
the marketing gloss from the real world. The insight you gain in this chapter,
along with real-world examples, helps you understand how to make a buying
decision, what to look for, and how to test readers in your own environment.
Choosing a Hand-held, Mobile, 
or Fixed-location Reader
You can choose from three types of readers for your RFID network: hand-held,
mobile, or fixed-location. Many criteria enter into this decision, including
operating processes, system cost, read range, read rate, volume to be cov-
ered, and allowable physical locations of antennas. The operating process,
required read data, and cost of installation will strongly influence the type of
reader installation that you choose.
 Hand-held: Hand-held readers are acceptable if only one or two tags per
read location need to be read at a time or if the volume is prohibitively
large for fixed location readers. Using hand-held readers is similar to using
a bar code reader, but unlike bar code readers, hand-held RFID readers
don’t require the tag to be clearly visible. Unfortunately, no hand-held
readers with a high power output and long battery life are currently
available. The advantage of a hand-held is that you can clearly scan one
case or pallet at a time without interference from pallets close by.
 Mobile: A mobile reader located on a trolley or powered cart can be
moved throughout a facility to read all the facility’s contents economi-
cally. Hand-helds can augment this process for hard-to-read objects. The
benefit of a mobile solution, such as the ACCU-SORT mobile tagging sta-
tion, is that the printer, reader, and a bar code scanner can all be in an
easily movable solution that communicates over 802.11 back to the main
database. This one also has a middleware component incorporated and
can help companies get compliant quickly with an investment of less than
$100,000 in most instances, after proper physics testing and verification.
 Fixed location: Fixed-location readers may be located at all entry and
exit points in a facility, on conveyors, at sort stations, or anywhere there
is a choke point (a point where items must pass by). The benefit of a
fixed RFID reader is its ability to automatically count and capture data
without needing human involvement. I have set up fixed location readers
that have achieved better than 98 percent success rate of reading items
as they pass by on a conveyor. This type of automation and accuracy is
what makes RFID the cat’s meow.
After you have determined the type of reader to use, you’re ready to evaluate
it, as described in the next section.

Reading between the Lines: 
Critical Buying Criteria
Like a lot of people, I initially judged RFID readers by how far they could read.
But before long, I began implementing real-world deployments for clients and
found out what was really important. Because dock doors and conveyors aren’t
50 feet wide, having a reader that could read at 25 feet isn’t necessary. Dock
doors are, at most, 12 feet wide, meaning that readers have to read only 6 feet
(with antennas on both sides of the dock door) to cover most applications.
I clearly needed a new set of criteria for determining the difference between
readers. I’ve distilled the more practical criteria for you in the following list.
When you evaluate readers for your RFID system, follow these guidelines to
determine the best choice for your business:
 Determine all the costs involved: Cost is always a major concern in
business. In the case of RFID technology, more important than the pur-
chase price of a reader are the hidden costs associated with installing
and maintaining a reader network into the future.
 Test reader performance: As I point out in Chapter 9, various materials
interact with radio waves in vastly different ways. Fluids, for example,
absorb RF energy, whereas metals reflect it. Therefore, you need to
choose an RFID reader that interacts effectively with your product mate-
rial type(s) and environment. Just like an expensive FM radio may pick
up stations that a cheaper radio cannot, so too do RFID readers work
with varying degrees of success.
 Assess connectivity: With the state of technical specifications and soft-
ware systems in constant flux, the ability to update, maintain, and moni-
tor reader networks remotely is critical to long-term success. The bottom
line when you look at an RFID network is that you consider the entire
ecosystem, the many nodes of a highly distributed system. You need to
consider four key factors relating to the connectivity of distributed reader
networks and ease of deployment within an existing infrastructure.
Those four key factors are
• Network connectivity: How many ways can the reader send data to
the outside world — over an Ethernet port, via RS-232, wirelessly,
and so on.
• Manufacturer’s configuration software: What tools are added to the
reader to allow management and configuration via the various 
connection methods? Sometimes, the commands are very differ-
ent, depending on whether you’re issuing them through a Web
portal with a user-friendly interface or through the serial port 
connection with command line language.
183
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

• Manufacturer’s data export software: Some readers can filter and
smooth tag reads, whereas others will just export raw read data.
This capability ties into your middleware architecture, which is
explained in more detail in Chapter 10.
• Upgradeability: Check for features that help you upgrade. For exam-
ple, can you use the same reader if you decide to expand interroga-
tions zones and would rather talk to the main network wirelessly
over 802.11? Will the firmware allow upgrades to new protocols? 
(I introduce the protocols in Chapter 2.)
Because complex physics underlie an RFID reader network, it’s not very
effective to simply attach the hardware to an existing network manage-
ment system (NMS) or monitoring package. Many early adopters found
this out the hard way: their NMS reported that the reader was alive, but
it couldn’t determine that the readers wasn’t reading a single tag in the
interrogation zone. You need middleware (see Chapter 10) and a moni-
toring system (see Chapter 14) that can handle RFID data.
 Evaluate how well a reader can be fine-tuned: RFID systems must be
finely tuned to maximize the capability of reader systems with each
product at each location. Many people experience ghost or phantom
reads because their readers are improperly configured. If you’re subject
to one of the big mandates, your read rates must be 100 percent. After
you get a system up and running, it becomes painfully clear that control
over a large number of RF parameters is important. This ability to fine-
tune will give you the control you need.
The sections that follow examine these four key guidelines in more detail.
Consider all the costs involved
When considering the reader costs for your RFID network, you need to take
into account the costs associated with the purchase price, installation, and
maintenance of readers.
Purchase price
The purchase price of your hardware is the foundation for evaluating a
reader network’s cost. Although the cost may seem straightforward, many
reader manufacturers constantly revamp their pricing strategies, change
their volume discounts, and offer marketing incentives for brand name
clients. If you are a Fortune 500 client with brand-name recognition, put your
negotiating hat on before talking to these hardware guys, or use an integrator
with a lot of experience in buying large quantities of hardware.
Many reader manufacturers, particularly the newer venture-backed compa-
nies, are willing to literally give away readers to get a brand name client. In
addition to securing the client, they hope the big-name client gets used to
184
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

using its readers. Then, when the client rolls out beyond a one- or two-reader
pilot, manufacturers hope the client buys a bunch of its readers. Like many of
the dot.com companies of the ’90s, reader manufacturers figure that if they
give readers away at below cost, they will make it up in volume. That seems
to be the case for the earliest of success stories — Matrics — which had the
most marquee clients, including Wal-Mart, and which was purchased in 2004
by Symbol Technologies for $230 million.
Another interesting factor is the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC)
requirement that readers be sold with approved antennas. The law states
that at least one approved antenna must be sold with each reader. But reader
manufacturers mostly resell off-the-shelf antennas at a significant mark-up.
You can dramatically reduce the purchase price of RFID antennas by sourcing
antennas through a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM) such as
Cushcraft or Sensormatic. In some cases, you can cut antenna prices by as
much as 50 percent.
Installation costs
RFID readers require access to 110 volt AC power or a router set up for Power
over Ethernet (PoE). Bringing power to all the areas where you have readers
set up may increase costs significantly, depending on how extensively the
site is currently wired for power and network connectivity.
The reader’s design (or form factor) comes into play in the installation as well.
With one reader manufacturer, AWID, the reader and antenna are a single unit,
eliminating messy coaxial cables that are somewhat sensitive to their envi-
ronment. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Symbol uses fragile, quick-
disconnect terminal connectors to tie its antenna to the reader via coax cable.
Therefore with a reader like AWID, you can mount the reader anywhere there
is power and connectivity. But if you need a reader and antenna combination
in more areas, you need to purchase a multiplexer to add those additional
antennas. The Symbol reader requires more protection for the cable connec-
tions and works best in a dedicated RFID rack. These little implementation
issues add directly to cost when you consider an entire network of readers.
Maintenance costs
The on-going maintenance costs for RFID are still relatively unknown because
of a lack of data from manufacturers. Here are some of the most common
maintenance issues:
 Replacing readers: Reader failure often occurs because of conditions
like heat, humidity, or extreme cold.
 Upgrading for new protocols and standards
 Changing configurations
 Replacing damaged antennas
185
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

All the major reader manufacturers provide some on-going technical support.
For example, Alien requires attendance at its “RFID University” — with an
associated price tag of $5,000 per person — before it offers tech support.
ThingMagic relies on an outside party, Tyco, for support. If your maintenance
issue requires on-site support, most vendors charge $150–$250 an hour and
have a limited number of trained personnel.
You can minimize routine maintenance by taking these preventative measures:
 Place the reader — the most expensive and shock-sensitive component —
away from high-traffic areas such as conveyors, shrink-wrap machines,
or dock doors.
 Place antennas near high traffic areas in a specialized reader rack to
avoid potential damage.
If you’re forced to choose between putting either your reader or antennas in
harm’s way of forklifts, dock workers, or high-speed machinery, choose the
antennas because they’re relatively inexpensive ($100–300) compared with
readers ($700–$3,000).
Test reader performance
The good news is that just about every reader manufactured can read the 
6 feet or so required to read across a dock door. The bad news is that when
you inject other variables like speed and material, things get a little more
interesting.
Performing a basic distance test
To understand how each reader performs at various distances, you need to
set up a basic distance test. The distance test is an accurate way to measure
how distance affects a reader’s performance. You can perform this test by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Find an empty warehouse or outdoor location with little or no ambient
electronic noise (AEN).
To find out how to test for AEN, refer to Chapter 7.
The ideal test site for reader performance is in an anechoic chamber,
which is a closed room of 3, 5, or 10 meters that has no ambient elec-
tronic noise and does not reflect any RF waves. This is a pure test of how
well the reader propagates a wave in a vacuum. However, RFID readers
live and work in the real world, so you need to test them in the real
world, where you can put the quality of their electronics and sensitivity
of their receiver to the test.
186
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

2. Find an empty cardboard box and affix to it an RFID tag that matches
the protocol of the reader you want to test.
Class 1 tags always work better with Class 1–specific readers, and Class
0 tags always work better with Class 0 readers. For an introduction to
protocols, see Chapter 2.
3. Lay out a grid on the floor starting at the reader and moving away in
1-foot increments, marking on the ground every foot.
4. Set up the reader in the factory default setting (usually full power)
with a single antenna attached.
5. Mount the antenna 3 feet off the ground on either a PVC mounting
bracket (like the one shown in Chapter 8) or a camera tripod.
6. Put the cardboard box on the SKU (stock-keeping unit) testing table
(also described in Chapter 8) or a similar nonferrous stand.
7. Measure the number of reads over a 60-second time period at 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, and 12 feet away from the antenna.
8. Record the results from each reader tested and compare the numbers.
The top readers on the market today from a pure read range perspective are
from Alien and Symbol (when used with their own tags). The top readers from
a multi-protocol perspective are OMRON readers (when used with their own
antennas) and SAMSys. The Tyco/ThingMagic reader also does well in a multi-
protocol environment. But nearly all the major readers can read well at 6 feet,
so the read range is likely to have little to do with your buying decision.
The reader software may skew your results because numerous parameters
exist within each reader’s firmware that are germane to each reader. Tuning
these variables to represent identical settings is difficult. This disparity in
firmware and firmware settings is one of the difficulties in measuring reader
performance on an even playing field. What one manufacturer refers to as a
global scroll mode might be called setting 6 by another, and only intimate
knowledge of many readers enables you to find commonalities. With all the
major readers I’ve tested, I’ve found that every reader from any manufacturer
can read effectively out to 6 or 7 feet in a clean environment, giving a maxi-
mum theoretical dock door width of 14 feet.
Setting up a conveyor test
One of the most common locations of RFID readers is on the conveyor line.
Conveyors are everywhere — from production facilities, to distribution cen-
ters, to the back of stores. The constraint of having only a second or two to
read an object as it passes through an interrogation zone adds to the com-
plexity of designing the reader network.
187
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

The mandates from many major retailers and the Department of Defense (DoD)
have specific speed conditions associated with them. Wal-Mart, for instance,
requires that items be readable at 600 feet per minute (fpm) at a maximum of
6 inches of separation between each case. The easiest way to test this scenario
is to set up a conveyor at 600 fpm. But unless you’ve seen something moving
at 600 fpm, you probably don’t have an appreciation of how fast that really is.
You can effectively test for performance at a certain speed in two ways: using
a conveyor or simulating the speed of a conveyor with a Cyclotron.
 The conveyor method: Building a small conveyor that can reach that
kind of pedal-to-the-metal velocity is difficult and very costly. I know one
systems integrator who spent over $200,000 building a loop conveyor. The
best way to work around the velocity and acceleration issue, while main-
taining the purity of a conveyor system, is to build a loop conveyor that
can gradually build up to that speed. In order to keep cases of your prod-
uct from flying at all angles, you need to put rails up around the corners.
 ODIN technologies Cyclotron: A safer and easier way than building your
own loop conveyor is to use a product called the Cyclotron. After trying
to chop and trick out conveyor motors in order to exceed the 600 fpm
mandate and over-engineer a system, the ODIN technologies team
designed and built a device capable of accelerating cases of product up
to 1,200 fpm (twice Wal-Mart’s requirement) and called it the ODIN tech-
nologies Cyclotron. The Cyclotron safely accelerates cases of product
and holds them at a constant speed indefinitely without fear of toppling
cases or damaging the product. ODIN technologies is happy to share the
design with end-users so they can build their own device.
The Cyclotron is essentially a giant centrifuge that has a 3-x-3-foot
wooden or plastic pod at the end of an 8-foot axle made of wood or fiber-
glass. Rollers guide the axle as it spins around on a 4-x-4-foot tabletop.
This enables you to complete accurate, safe, and quiet speed testing in a
small area. A simple digital speedometer allows accurate calibration of
the device down to the tenth of a foot per minute. The ODIN labs have
both a conveyor and the Cylcotron, but the results and ease of use of
the Cyclotron have the conveyor collecting dust. Figure 10-1 shows a
line drawing of the Cyclotron.
Running a conveyor test
Here are the general guidelines for running a conveyor speed test:
 Set up the readers in their fastest polling mode and read at gradually
increasing speeds. I like to test at 400, 600, and 1,200 fpm. You should
employ high speeds to probe the upper threshold of reader performance.
 Test a baseline RF-friendly product, such as a cardboard box. For the
baseline test, tag an empty cardboard box with the same type of tag
used on each SKU and accelerate the box to the same speeds mentioned
previously.
188
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

 Test around your most RF-unfriendly items. If you have items with high
metallic or liquid content, test them on the Cyclotron or conveyor.
 Test your most representative or popular product.
 Measure at least 50 passes. You’re looking for high-integrity data. To
ensure that nothing unusual affects your test results, you need to com-
plete the test enough times to make your data statistically significant.
Conveyors come in all shapes and sizes. Rollers can be all metal, others made
of composite materials, and some can have rubber sections of treading. Some
tracks are just over 1 foot wide, whereas others can be 3 feet wide. The dis-
tance from one section of conveyor to another can vary by 10 or 15 feet. The
electrical noise generated by each one can be vastly different. As you can
see, there’s no one standard conveyor. Therefore, don’t try to compare results
of conveyor testing from one conveyor to another, particularly if you’re test-
ing different readers with various configurations, power outputs, and antenna
designs. Trying to talk to your peers or sister companies about conveyor
testing can lead you down a confusing path.
Test conveyors in your live environment to verify your scientific static test-
ing and use that testing to set a threshold for what level of performance you
need to achieve when you perform you static testing or define your required

tag performance index (TPI). For more information on the TPI, see the side-
bar in Chapter 9. Beyond that, the results are widely variable with multiple
dependencies — not something any pocket-protector-wearing scientist would
want to hang his slide rule on, that’s for sure.
Interpreting the results
The goal of performance testing is to compare each reader in a manner that
eliminates all variables except those that you’re examining. The distance test
validates that the readers you’re testing have some common baseline of per-
formance, maybe 6 or 7 feet on RF-friendly material. With that information,
your next challenge is to examine the conveyor test:
 Your control variables are the speed at which you’re testing and the
materials you’re testing — an RF-friendly material (your baseline), your
toughest product, and perhaps your most representative or popular
product.
 The dependent variable is the average number of successful read
cycles completed per pass because you’re testing the ability of the
reader and its electronics to very quickly interrogate tags.
You can accomplish experimental equivalency by dividing each reader’s raw
data by its own unique baseline data to normalize the SKU data generated 
by each reader. For example, reader x might successfully read bottled water
three times per pass but read an empty cardboard box (the baseline) six times
per pass. This would result in a rating of 0.5 for your bottled water testing 
(3 ÷ 6). This normalization is the only way to easily eliminate all firmware- and
software-related variables (for example, polling cycles and frequencies) and
compare each reader’s performance against its own unique baseline.
Make sure the same cases of product are tagged with the exact same tags 
for all materials and readers involved, effectively eliminating case and tag
variance as well.
ODIN technologies labs tested the performance of four EPC-compliant readers,
and the results are shown in Figure 10-2. This figure clearly illustrates the 
role of speed in readability. As speed increases (the y-axis), each data group
becomes shorter, indicating fewer reads per pass and diminished performance.
It’s interesting to note that both Alien and AWID exceed the 1.0 threshold at
400 fpm, indicating that these readers performed better communicating with
tags attached to paper products than they did in the baseline case. Taking
the data from the tests and presenting it in a simple graphical manner, as
shown in Figure 10-2, gives you an easy-to-read side-by-side comparison.
190
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

Figure 10-3 shows the same four readers, but this time the object being tested
is a metallic case. The change to a metallic SKU has a clear impact on the
results: Performance is negatively impacted for all manufacturers at all speeds.
Another significant finding is that Symbol offers superior performance when
metallic objects are involved, with Alien now ranked third. Again, the role of
speed is clear: Performance diminishes with increasing speed. The specific
results for your products will vary, but the testing protocol and presentation
will prove a useful factor in determining reader performance.
To get the best results, you have to figure out how to make the readers per-
form as close to each other as possible. This is more difficult than you might
think. For instance, the Symbol reader has only one basic acquisition mode,

which is analogous to Alien’s “Inventory” command, suggesting that Alien has
programmed more flexibility into its firmware. Although the inventory mode
works well in situations in which many tags are in the field simultaneously
(like a dock door or shelf), it is not preferred in conveyor applications in
which only one or two tags are in the field for a short period of time. The
likely reason for this limitation is that Symbol’s latest reader (AR-400) builds
on its predecessor (SR-400), which was designed exclusively for Class 0 tag
negotiation. The result of this limitation is a reduction in the total number of
reads per pass relative to other readers. Although the speed test protocol
cancels the effect of this issue by dividing reads per pass by each reader’s
own baseline, keeping these differences in mind is important. That’s because
the programmability and software is providing a perceived difference in per-
formance that needs to be normalized as accurately as possible.
Assess connectivity
An RFID reader is only as good as the data that it can send out. Therefore the
connectivity — how information gets from the reader to upstream applica-
tions is critical to the performance of your RFID network.
Choosing a connectivity type
While not exactly like deciding between blondes, brunettes, and redheads,
RS-232, RS-485, and Ethernet are still pretty sexy choices. When deploying an
RFID system, the choice of network connectivity for the RFID reader devices
is an important consideration.
Historically, RFID readers have tended to use serial communications for their
connectivity, with an equal reliance on RS-232 and RS-485. These days, most
manufacturers gravitate toward Ethernet, with several working toward or
implementing Power over Ethernet (PoE) and even 802.11 wireless connec-
tivity. Your connectivity choices are as follows:
 RS-232: The RS-232 protocol provides a well-known and reliable system
for short-range wired communications, but its limitations are rife:
• Communications speeds are low, ranging from 9600 bits per
second (bps) to 115.2 kilobits per second (Kbps) — think of slow
modems from way back in the ’80s.
• Cable length is restricted to 30 meters.
• There is no error-checking or error control.
• It is a point-to-point communications system, requiring individual
cables to be installed between each network device and the control
system. Because of this, it requires extra cabling, which drives up
the cost of deployment.
192
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

 RS-485: The RS-485 protocol is an improvement over RS-232 in the 
following ways:
• It allows significantly greater cable lengths (up to 1,200 meters).
• It handles higher speeds (up to 2.5 megabits per second [Mbps]).
• As a bus protocol, it allows multiple devices to be connected to the
same cable.
However, it requires special cabling, which can drive up the cost of an
RFID installation. But if you’re comparing RS-232 and RS-485, RS-485 wins
hands down.
 Ethernet: Since it has been available, Ethernet has been the connectivity
solution of choice for most RFID installers for many reasons:
• Many integration locations already have Ethernet infrastructures
in place, and its ubiquity ensures simpler installation and lower
integration costs.
• Its speed is more than sufficient for individual RFID readers.
• The reliability of the TCP/IP protocol over Ethernet ensures the
integrity of the data transferred.
The only shortcoming is that TCP/IP packets can travel only 100 meters
down a single CAT-5 cable.
Many manufacturers recommend the use of protocol translation (PT) devices
to convert from RS-232 and RS-485 to TCP/IP. This combines the lower devel-
opment costs associated with serial communications with the higher speeds
and reliability of Ethernet. RFID companies have traditionally used products
from a company called Moxa for this purpose, but any RS-232-to-TCP/IP con-
verter should work, and they generally cost under $100 each.
Many of today’s new readers have Ethernet connectivity. Symbol, Alien,
AWID, and SAMSys all have Ethernet connectivity in their latest readers. The
best connectivity arrangements in a reader provide RS-232 and RS-485 for
backward compatibility with previous models, while also containing both a
standard RJ-45 Ethernet port and a PCMCIA slot (like the one on the side of
your laptop that you can plug other devices like a wireless card into). The
PCMCIA slot can house an 802.11 Wi-Fi PCMCIA card. Figure 10-4 shows some
of the connectors and indicators that you might find on a new reader.
Although most previous-generation readers used serial communications for
their network connectivity, the current generation of readers provides access
to their systems over Ethernet. This is a significant advantage over serial
communications because serial line communications provide little flexibility
and slow communication speeds. Ethernet connectivity allows simpler instal-
lation and lower rollout costs, combined with greater ease of management
because all Ethernet-connected network units can be remotely monitored to
some degree.
193
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

Reader manufacturers supply antennas and 15–25-foot cables. Before you
purchase your reader and antennas, make sure you know exactly where each
one will be mounted so you can order cables of the proper length. Likewise,
you need to find out from the manufacturer how long the power cable is so you
can account for AC power if you use a standard outlet to power the reader.
Using the software for device configuration
Several manufacturers provide their own software, which interfaces with their
equipment. Although most of the provided software is not useful for produc-
tion deployments, it is useful for performing basic device configuration and
for providing a demonstration of the unit’s capabilities. If you’ll be configur-
ing and deploying the readers yourself, understanding the complexity of this
on-board software is important. Many manufacturers, like Alien and SAMSys,
require you to use command-line level controls for changing the configuration.
Other manufacturers, like Symbol and OMRON, have a very simple Web inter-
face that is easy for novice users, but at times not detailed enough for experi-
enced deployment teams.
For fully integrated deployments, you need to install RFID reader control 
software systems, such as Sun Microsystems’ EPC Information Server,
ConnecTerra’s RFTagAware, OATSystems’ Senseware, or GlobeRanger’s
iMotion suite. These systems provide a consistent interface to many types 
of readers, allow tags to be written to (commissioned), and eliminate the
need to write custom software to communicate with each type of reader.
Keep in mind that these demonstration programs are not production quality;
most of them are fragile, and system crashes are commonplace.

Some reader manufacturers provide a hidden supervisory mode in the
demonstration software that gives experienced users access to advanced 
features. This mode is not documented or supported by the manufacturers
because it makes it possible for inexperienced users to cause physical harm
to the system. However, if you or someone on your team is an experienced
software hack, this is where you can get to some really powerful commands.
Reducing cabling needs to save money
When implementing RFID solutions, all but one or two of the current-generation
RFID readers require separate electrical and network connectivity, and in the
case of RS-232 or RS-485 devices, custom cabling is necessary for connectiv-
ity. As you might have guessed, all these specialized cables that need to be
routed around a location can increase the cost of implementation significantly.
There are two possible solutions for reducing cabling requirements and
therefore costs; both solutions require Ethernet connectivity:
 Wireless connectivity: IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi connectivity eliminates the
need for a separate network connection but requires a local electrical
supply to power the units.
 Power over Ethernet: The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) stan-
dard permits power and network connectivity to be delivered over the
same physical CAT-5 cable but requires an upgrade of network gear to a
specialized PoE switch.
Neither solution is a panacea for connectivity and cabling requirements. PoE
is restricted to a maximum power output of 15.4 watts, a power level that can
be significantly reduced as it travels along lengthy Ethernet cables. This power
limitation requires more modest RFID tag reader power consumption to be
feasible. The good news, however, is that expensive electrical connections
will not have to be run at each reader station with PoE. Similarly, wireless
connectivity can also prove problematic: It requires a Wi-Fi infrastructure to
be installed, and the integration of Wi-Fi units into each RFID reader can drive
up the cost of each unit. But on the other hand, the cost of bringing CAT-5
cable to each reader location is eliminated, so once again, it’s a trade-off.
Real-world communications networks exist in most modern warehouses and
vary in type from wireless to CAT-3 (serial) to CAT-5 (Ethernet), with almost
all new installations using CAT-5. All readers will eventually support an Ethernet
network, and it is heartening to see that many manufacturers already support
this standard. If you like a particular reader that doesn’t support Ethernet,
ask the manufacturer whether Ethernet support is in the development timeline.
195
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

Evaluate how well the reader 
can be fine-tuned
When evaluating a reader for tuning capabilities, look for the following features:
 Forward compatibility with future tag protocols
 Tunability
 Flexible power output
 Clean RF output
 Antenna programmability
Forward compatibility with future tag protocols
Because the RFID industry is still developing, protocols are in flux — from
EPC standards to ISO standards. Thus, choosing an agile (multiprotocol and
multifrequency) reader to protect your investment against future changes to
standards and to avoid technology obsolescence is vital.
Many reader manufacturers claim forward compatibility with the newest 
generations of tag protocols, but only one or two readers have shown the
ability to read all the tags approved by Wal-Mart and the DoD (Class 0, 0+,
and 1) and to be forward compatible with the new Generation 2.0 protocol.
Symbol and SAMSys have readers for both Class 0 and Class 1 protocols 
and have proven compatibility since mid-2004. ThingMagic, Tyco, and
OMRON have all claimed compatibility, and I expect those readers to be 
compatible based on their claims.
When you purchase readers, make sure you get a guarantee in writing that
says the readers will be forward compatible with emerging standards. If the
reader ends up not being easily upgradeable via firmware, you want to make
sure that you get the reader manufacturer to pay for the cost of putting new
readers in. Most top-tier reader manufacturers are willing to make this guar-
antee and stand by their equipment.
Because most of these readers have some sort of a digital signal processor
(DSP) chip, which I cover in Chapter 5, there is reason to believe that all read-
ers could be software upgradeable. Find out if your chosen reader has a stan-
dard DSP from a popular chip manufacturer like Texas Instruments. These
manufacturers are more likely to offer upgradeable chips and support, so this
information can help you gauge the likelihood of the firmware being forward
compatible.
Tunability
When choosing a reader, you need to look at what parameters it enables you
to tune. The process of extracting maximum performance from any reading
196
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

device requires tunability that goes far beyond the functionality provided by
demonstration software. A host of parameters must be tuned to optimize
reader performance, including acquisition cycle design (which relates to the
timing and number of wakeup, read, and sleep commands included in each
acquisition cycle), acquisition frequency, and timing. For best performance,
each of these reader parameters should be configured for each unique SKU
and for the specific operating environment. However, you have to tune these
parameters to the common denominator.
Some manufacturers preset these parameters and package them in a single
command for use in their demonstration software. Alien, for example, provides
the ability to quickly capture data from any tag in the field through the Global
Scroll acquisition command. This mode is preferred in a fast-moving environ-
ment such as a conveyor application, in which no more than one or two tags
enter the field at a given time. The Global Scroll command allows for very fast
interrogation and response, so it can collect a small amount of information
very quickly. Conversely, the Inventory mode provides the ability to negoti-
ate hundreds of tags simultaneously by using an algorithm that efficiently
steps through all EPC numbers in the field. Though much slower, Inventory
mode makes reading all cases on a pallet possible by solving the problem of
data collision.
Both SAMSys and Matrics have systems that create custom configurations
based on polling rates, protocol choices, and other factors. Matrics creates
separate read-point classes. The classes are a configuration of each antenna
attached to an individual reader. Configuring the Matrics reader allows you to
set the following options:
 Antenna type allows you to choose from five different preset antenna
configurations, based on your specific usage need — AREA (long range),
SHELFv1 (existing short range shelf type), SHELFv2 (next-generation
short range shelf type), COMBINED1, or COMBINED2.
 Scan Period dictates how often the read point is to be checked for tags.
 Retry tells the reader how many times to repeat the read command each
time a scan is to be performed.
 Air interface — Read All, Class 0, or Class 1 — determines which 
protocol the reader should use.
 Gain designates (as a percentage) the antenna’s power setting.
The custom configuration options are more complex to understand and use
in an operational environment. However, they could result in a higher read
rate and great success after some experience with the settings. This is why
having your own testing laboratory or environment (covered in Chapter 8) 
is an important part of understanding the performance of each reader.

Flexible power output
“Supersize it” is the general mantra of everything in the United States — the
bigger, the better. As a guy who’s owned two Hummer H-1s, I feel the urge to
supersize on a regular basis. But in RFID, more is not necessarily better. The

Reader power and path loss
Understanding some of the parameters of a typ-
ical UHF reader will help you further appreciate
the proper reader network architecture. With an
understanding of some of the basic math behind
the physics, as well as some of the FCC guide-
lines that regulate the use of RFID, you can
properly tune your readers for optimal perfor-
mance. The maximum allowable power output
at each antenna on a reader in the United
States is 1 watt. This equates to
 Reader transmit power (Pr) of 30 dBm (an
adjustable variable in most readers and a
measurable one as well)
 Reader receiver sensitivity (Sr) is equal to
–80 dBm, or 10–11 watts
 Reader antenna gain (Gr) is equal to 6 dBi
This is the information half of what you need to
know, the second half is the tag component:
 The tag has a power requirement of –10
dBm, or 100 microwatts.
 The tag’s antenna has a gain (Gt) of only 
1 dBi.
 The tag’s antenna has a backscatter effi-
ciency (Et) of –20 dB.
Understanding these six components, coupled
with (pun intended) the known wavelength (λ)
of 915 MHz of 33 cm (about a foot), you can
determine the path loss of an RF field. Knowing
the path loss can help you optimize your read
zones. That’s why I go through path loss contour
mapping in Chapter 7. The following figure
shows how the tag power (Pt) is calculated in a
path loss. Knowing the tag power requirements
(100 microwatts) can help you calculate the
reader power (Pr) to optimize the distance of the
interrogation zone. This is critical in preventing
ghost or phantom reads.

experience from ODIN’s lab unequivocally — though counterintuitively —
indicates that many tagged objects have a maximum performance threshold
well below the maximum power output of a reader (1 watt at the antenna). 
In other words, you get better results trying to read things with less than full
power — kind of like going faster in second gear. This is due to the fact that
RFID tag backscatter can be drowned out by high-power transmissions on the
receiving side. So having a reader with flexible power output is critical to
achieving maximum performance.
Minimizing power output for each application to avoid unnecessary RF levels
in a facility where other readers are bound to be operating is also helpful
because you want to minimize the amount of RF noise in your environment
so that readers don’t interfere with each other. Proper power tuning is criti-
cal for an RFID network and should be given the utmost consideration when
deploying a system. As reader technology improves, so too will control over
variables like power.
Many reader manufacturers have a confusing power adjustment setting such
as “Power: 1–10,” with little or no explanation of what 1 is or how many deci-
bels each level accounts for. Using a spectrum analyzer and power meter can
be a valuable way of comparing relative signal strength. The small hand-held
units, such as the Rohde and Swartz portable hand-held spectrum analyzer
and an OMRON reader, are great for mobility in the field. As users become
more sophisticated in their understanding the tuning capabilities, the readers
will grow in sophistication.
Many issues attributed to “immature technology” are easily solved when
applying the laws of physics throughout the system design and installation.
Proper tuning prevents RF spillover from affecting adjacent systems, and as
the “Reader power and path loss” sidebar shows, mathematical formulas and
simple physics equations can help you understand this complex behavior.
Clean RF output
Along with the low-cost status of an EPC-compliant tag comes a simple timing
device used to synchronize with the carrier signal emitted by a reader. If this
signal is not constant phase (that is, if there are unwanted variances of the RF
wave because of poor quality equipment), the tag clock will fail, making it dif-
ficult to establish communication with the reader. Therefore it is important
that the RF emissions be as clean as possible.
More importantly, some RF signals generate splatter. Splatter occurs when the
RF power of a reader transmitter causes undesirable frequencies to be gener-
ated. This “dirty” signal can cause interference with equipment operating at
frequencies outside the RFID ISM band and break FCC compliance. Generally,
the quality of RF output is attributable to the quality of components used to
produce the reader.
199
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

Many readers are not being made in production volumes and, consequently,
have poorer than normal quality control. You want to ensure any reader you
test doesn’t produce splatter and is in compliance with FCC regulations.
Certifying all readers in the lab to make sure the reader and antenna combi-
nation complies with FCC rules Part 15 is critical to keeping your system legal
and safe. The best way to ensure compliance is to set up the reader and
antenna combination in the lab as it will be configured in the operating envi-
ronment and then test it. Follow these steps to test for FCC compliance:
1. Make sure the power setting is at the maximum allowable amount
(which should be 1 watt).
2. Set up your spectrum analyzer with a center frequency of 915 MHz
and a span of 50 MHz so that you can record all activity from 865 to
965 MHz.
3. Monitor the reader for 60 minutes and keep the hold lock ON in your
spectrum analyzer to record all the read points.
4. Look for any signals outside the 902–928 MHz range.
If you have any signals outside the 902–928 MHz band, you’ve got a non-
compliant system that needs to be sent back to the manufacturer.
Antenna programmability
In evaluating a reader, you also need to consider the programming capabili-
ties of its antennas so that you can control how an antenna array works. The
antenna acts as both the ears and the mouth of a reader — it transmits (talks)
a signal to tags and then receives (listens) for the response. Antennas are
critical to the RFID network and need to be carefully configured and set up.
The antennas of multiport readers go through a switching sequence called
multiplexing. No two antennas are ever active at the same time to prevent
interference and data collision. Some readers make it possible to program
this sequence, and others do not.
The advantage of sequence programmability is illustrated clearly in a portal
application in which cases stacked on a pallet must be read. Pallets of some
SKUs possess regions that are difficult to penetrate with RF radiation; tags in
these regions require additional time to power up and communicate with the
reader. As you develop your RFID program, conduct SKU testing that seeks to
discover these regions. You must then be able to focus RF power on those
regions and program the antenna sequencing pattern accordingly. So rather
than using the default mode that activates the antennas in the following
sequence:
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, . . .
It may become necessary to adjust the sequence to penetrate a difficult
region adjacent to antenna 3 as follows:
200
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, . . .
Always design the system for the most challenging use case.
Many readers build on this concept by making it possible to configure each
antenna individually. Matrics offers configuration parameters such as antenna
gain, the number of retries, the air protocol to use, and others. Alien takes
antenna control one step further by providing antenna duration control,
making it possible to adjust the amount of time one antenna is active relative
to another. These custom tuning capabilities will continue to evolve in read-
ers as people define the needs of their RFID network based on real-world
experience.
Installing a Reader and Antennas
After you select your reader and antennas (which you will probably buy from
a reseller or manufacturer), it’s time to let the fun begin. I suggest installing
the antennas and firing up the reader for the first time in a lab setting so you
have more control and less activity around while you try to figure out these
new pieces of equipment. You should also have a spectrum analyzer and net-
work analyzer available for fine-tuning and verification. (See Chapter 12 for
more on analyzers and the lab set-up.) The four basic steps to setting up your
reader and antennas are as follows:
1. Mount the reader.
2. Mount and connect the antennas.
3. Power up the reader.
4. Test the interrogation zone for RF path loss.
These steps are described in detail in the sections that follow.
One of the challenges of setting up the RFID infrastructure is mounting the
readers, antennas, and cabling in a warehouse or production environment. 
A simple solution for this is a specially designed RFID rack. Several manufac-
turers sell all-in-one RFID racks that hold the reader, antennas, cabling, 
indicator lights, and in some instances, an uninterruptible power supply
(UPS). These units protect the reader and antennas and allow you to build 
in certain features that are important to your business process. Figure 10-5
shows the inside and outside of a ruggedized RFID rack. The figure on the 
left shows the interior with the antenna mounting bar and the shelves for
readers, strobe lights, and the bottom compartment for a UPS. The figure 
on the right shows the rack with the protective cover in place.
201
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

Mount the reader
Most readers have holes on the edges of the outside casing or a soft material
you can drill directly through for mounting the readers to the desired surface.
If you use an RFID rack, you don’t have to worry about the hassle of finding a
safe place to mount the units. Mount the reader by screwing it directly to the
wall or plate that you fashion to hold it, making sure you screw it down in all
four corners.
When looking for a place to mount the reader, keep the following points 
in mind:
 Make sure that the reader is as far from harm’s way as possible.
Mounting the antenna above a dock door, for instance, keeps it in the
area of least activity; the downside is that it’s tough to get to if you need
to work on it.
 Mount the reader in as clean and dry a place and in as normal a tem-
perature as possible. Any extremes in heat, humidity, direct sunlight,
and so on have an adverse effect on the reader.
 When you mount the reader, make sure you allow at least six inches
of clearance all the way around the reader for ample air flow to cool
the unit and to allow cables to be easily connected.
In addition to understanding the sources of ambient electromagnetic noise
(AEN), gleaned from completion of the Full Faraday Cycle Analysis detailed 
in Chapter 7, you also need to consider more direct and immediate electromag-
netic interference on the reader (as opposed to on the RF waves emanating
Figure 10-5:
A rugged-
ized RFID
rack.
202
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

from the reader). Mounting the reader near generators, pumps, converters,
electronic scales, AC switching relays, computer terminals, and the like may
adversely affect the reader’s performance.
Don’t power up the reader yet. Powering some readers up without antennas
attached can overload the circuitry and literally fry the electronics of the
reader. Most new readers have circuit protection built in, but I’ve fried a
couple of the old ThingMagic readers in my time by carelessly disconnecting
the antennas before I powered the reader down. Thankfully, better reader
design keeps this from happening in most instances, but making sure you
keep antennas plugged in when the power is on is a good habit to get into.
Mount and connect the antennas
After you decide where you want your antennas and use the RF path loss con-
tour map (see Chapter 7) to lay out the design, you can mount the antennas.
Antennas generally come either with a material around the edges that’s
designed to be drilled through or with special mounting brackets attached 
to the back. You can mount antennas on anything from specially designed
ruggedized RFID racks to custom-welded angle iron to lolly columns that hold
up the ceiling. Remember that you want to protect the antennas from people
or machinery; they can’t be bumped, bashed, banged, or bothered with.
After the antennas are mounted around your interrogation zone, attach them
to the reader in sequential order. Many people ignore this important point and
just start screwing coax cables willy-nilly into random ports. Depending on
the type of reader you choose, you have either eight or four ports. If you have
eight ports, you most likely have both a transmit (Tx) and a receive (Rx)
port, and your antennas have two cables coming from each of them. If you
have four ports on the reader, the Tx and Rx ports are probably combined.
To connect them in sequential order, first connect antenna 1 to reader con-
nectors Tx1 and Rx1, then antenna 2 to reader connectors Tx2 and Rx2,
antenna 3 to the Tx3/Rx3 connectors, and antenna 4 to the Tx4/Rx4 connec-
tors last. Follow these steps to make the connections:
1. Attach the large ends of your antenna connector cables to the large
connectors on the antenna.
2. Attach the small ends of the cables to the corresponding connectors
on the reader (antenna 1 to reader connectors Tx1 and Rx1, and so on).
Power up the reader
Now the fun part: Fire up the reader and start reading. Powering up readers is
pretty much the same as booting up a computer. After the reader powers up, it
goes through a series of self-checks (you see the lights flashing on the outside
203
Chapter 10: Hooked on Phonics: Reader Testing, Selection, and Installation

of the reader while it does this). Make sure you have the right power supply.
Connect the power supply to the reader port for power and then plug the
power supply into a 24-volt DC power outlet. The reader’s power light should
come on. Depending on the reader, it may take a few seconds to a few min-
utes to boot up properly, but as soon as it does, you can start reading.
If you’ve done everything correctly and the power light is on, you can put a
tag in front of an antenna and get a visual verification by seeing a transmit/
receive or read signal. Here are the detailed steps:
1. Hold the tag directly in front of and at least 1 foot away from the
antenna.
At this point, you don’t want to move the tag around too much because
the reader may not be optimally configured. Just put the tag in front of
the antenna and look for the read light to flash on.
2. Check the validity of that signal light on the reader by connecting the
reader up to your laptop via either the RS-485 port on most readers 
or the Ethernet port. You can then start up the simple demo program
that comes with all readers to verify that the reader is actually gener-
ating good data.
3. When you’re satisfied that the system is working properly, organize
all the cables and permanently mount the cables with wire ties and
mounting brackets so they are neatly out of the way.
Running the cables along mounting brackets or enclosing them in pro-
tective piping is always a good idea.
Test the interrogation zone for RF path loss
Using the technique described in Chapter 7, set up the spectrum analyzer
and verify the strength of the RF field in your interrogation zone. By putting
your testing equipment to work after the installation, you can determine 
the overall area of your interrogation zone and configure it to read only
where you want it to. Knowing that a tag generally requires –10 dBm or 100
microwatts to power it up tells you where the outside edge of your interroga-
tion zone will be.
After you’re up and running in a stable state, try to connect to the reader via
its Ethernet connection and begin to investigate the other options that might
be available through the configuration GUI (graphical user interface). The
reader’s GUI often gives you access to different configuration options and
usually an intuitive interface for making and saving changes. Almost all the
top readers today (Alien, Matrics/Symbol, OMRON, SAMSys) have built very
intuitive GUIs.

A
ll you baseball fans out there probably know that the greatest baseball
team of all time, the 2004 Boston Red Sox, would not have been able to
pull off the best comeback in baseball history (down three games to none in
a best of seven series with the Yankees, they swept the National League
Champion Cardinals, and became the only team in baseball history to win
eight games in a row culminating in a world championship) with only their
starting pitchers. The key to their victory was having a great starting rotation,
a good closer, and strong middle relief pitchers. The exact same scenario
rings true in the RFID world. If you want to be the world champion of RFID
deployments, you have to look at the physics and infrastructure covered in
this book and have an end application that can turn the data into useful intel-
ligence. But you won’t be anywhere without the right middleware to connect
the infrastructure with the application.
Tag and reader physics solves only the problem of being able to capture RFID
data. To uncover the operational benefits of RFID — like reducing out-of-stock
situations or decreasing labor requirements in the receiving process — you
must process the incoming RFID data and intelligently integrate it into your busi-
ness applications. This is trickier than it might sound because you can’t just
link existing software applications to RFID readers and hope for the best. Why?

 First, not all of the incoming RFID data is valuable. Duplicate reads and
excess information must be filtered out so as not to bog down the net-
work and end up with confusing information inside your applications.
 Second, not all readers speak the same language. Building custom 
integration logic for each brand of reader will quickly eat up your RFID
deployment team’s time and budget.
 Lastly, different RFID information needs to be passed off to different
applications and data stores. For example, reads at the loading dock
may need to be passed off only to the plant’s local warehouse manage-
ment application, while demand stream information coming from a
retailer may need to be sent all the way up to the supplier’s enterprise
demand forecasting solution.
These capabilities are the heart and soul of a new breed of software called
RFID middleware, which Forrester Research defines as “platforms for manag-
ing RFID data and routing it between tag readers or other auto identification
devices and enterprise systems.”
This chapter takes you through the specific features and functions that RFID
middleware provides, as well as the various types of offerings that are cur-
rently on the market. I help you understand the different standards in the RFID
middleware world and show how to plan and implement the RFID middleware
solution that is right for your situation and current technical environment.
Filter, Smooth, Route: Understanding
What You Need Middleware to Do
The scope of what RFID middleware needs to do varies depending on whom
you talk to, but I walk you through the full list of functionality that a complete
end-to-end middleware solution should include. Many early RFID middleware
solutions focused on features like reader integration and coordination, elec-
tronic product code (EPC) track-and-trace tools, and baseline filtering capa-
bilities. But these are just a subset of the many features that complete RFID
middleware platforms must provide.
To stand the test of time as a complete solution, RFID middleware must include
a balanced combination of seven core capabilities. These capabilities —
starting from connectivity and moving up the stack — are as follows:
 Reader and device management: RFID middleware needs to allow users
to configure, deploy, and issue commands directly to readers through a
common interface. For example, users should be able to tell a reader
when to “turn off” if needed. In some instances, middleware vendors
206
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

offer plug-and-play-like capabilities that let deployment teams dynami-
cally sense a reader’s presence and link to it without having to write any
code. Integration with other Auto-ID technologies, like sensors and bio-
metrics, is also important.
 Data management: After RFID middleware captures EPC data from read-
ers, it must be able to intelligently filter and route the data to the appro-
priate destinations. Look for middleware that includes both low-level
logic (like filtering out duplicate reads) and more complex algorithms
(like content-based routing). Comprehensive solutions also offer tools
for aggregating and managing EPC data in either a federated (multiple
repositories of data) or central data source.
 Application integration: RFID middleware solutions need to provide the
messaging, routing, and connectivity features required to reliably inte-
grate RFID data into existing SCM, ERP, WMS, or CRM systems — ideally
through a services-oriented architecture.
In case you’re not familiar with these terms, that’s supply-chain manage-
ment (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), warehouse management
systems (WMS), and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. 
A services-oriented architecture is essentially a collection of services.
These services communicate with each other. The communication can
involve either simple data exchange or two or more services coordinat-
ing some activity, such as order placement or inventory control.
Middleware also needs to provide a library of adapters to popular WMS
and SCM applications like SAP or Manhattan Associates, as well as appli-
cation programming interfaces (APIs) and adapters for using standard
technologies like JMS, XML, and SOAP to integrate with other third-party
applications.
 Partner integration: Some of the most promising benefits of RFID will
come from sharing RFID data with partners to improve collaborative
processes like demand forecasting and vendor-managed inventory. This
means that RFID middleware must provide B2B (business-to-business)
integration features like partner profile management, support for B2B
transport protocols, and integration with a partner’s data over commu-
nications such as EDI, Web-based systems like AS2, or eventually a well-
engineered system specifically for EPC data.
 Process management and application development: Instead of just
routing RFID data to business applications, sophisticated RFID middle-
ware platforms actually orchestrate RFID-related end-to-end processes
that touch multiple applications and/or enterprises. Using inventory
replenishment as an example, if your system understands that you have
a certain amount of one item coming through the door and the receiving
process in the back of the store is tied to the point-of-sale data, you can
accurately know when the inventory level becomes critically low and
send a machine-generated message to the distribution center to order
more product, without needing human involvement.
207
Chapter 11: Middle Where? It’s Not Just about the Readers

Key process management and composite application development fea-
tures include workflow, role management, process automation, and UI
(user-interface) development tools. These specific tools help you create
solutions that fit in with your existing applications and reap the benefit
of machine-to-machine communication in a custom environment.
 Packaged RFID content: RFID middleware platforms that include pack-
aged routing logic, product data schemas, and integration with typical
RFID-related applications and processes like shipping, receiving, and
asset tracking are major assets. Why? No one wants to start from a blank
sheet of paper, and this content can give you a head start on your RFID
projects.
 Architecture scalability and administration: There’s no question that
RFID adoption is going to produce a lot of data, and RFID middleware 
is the first line of defense for reliably processing that data. This means
that RFID middleware platforms must include features for dynamically
balancing processing loads across multiple servers and automatically
rerouting data if (or should I say when) a server fails. These features need
to span all tiers of the architecture — even the devices that are located
near or on the actual readers. I explain the key tiers of a network a little
later in this chapter in “Piecing Together a Middleware Architecture.”
Exploring Middleware Vendors 
and Their Offerings
It’s no surprise that vendors are flocking to the RFID middleware market,
which is riddled with mandate-driven user companies whose RFID budgets
are increasing. But as is typical of most emerging markets, the vendor land-
scape is far from simple. There are small start-ups with unique solutions, big
companies with solutions only on paper (often called slide-ware or vapor ware),
and everything in between. RFID middleware vendors are crawling out of the
woodwork, although these vendors generally fall into one of five key segments.
To get the full range of functionality from your middleware (all the functions I
listed in the preceding section), you likely need to choose middleware from
multiple vendors and segments. Among the five segments, each brings differ-
ent expertise to the table:
 Reader vendors: You may be asking yourself, why don’t the readers
themselves provide these middleware features? Some of them do, and I
expect many more to do so in the future. But the middleware features
that readers provide are very basic and typically limited to things like
stripping out duplicate reads. To do more sophisticated filtering and
routing, you need more contextual information, like data from multiple
readers and business logic that may reside in existing business applica-
tions. This type of information is not available to individual readers that
are located on plant floors or in retail outlets.
208
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

 RFID pure plays: Vendors like ConnecTerra, GlobeRanger, and
OATSystems emerged out of the early pilots sponsored by the Auto-ID
Center. These vendors, along with some RFID hardware and software
veterans like RF Code and Savi Technologies, offer products that inte-
grate with RFID readers, filter and aggregate data, and even incorporate
business rules. Some vendors have come out of device management for
the Department of Defense, like Cougaar Software. These vendors are
still in their early stages, but their involvement in pilots and RFID stan-
dards development has turned them into valuable resources for practi-
cal RFID middleware know-how.
 Application vendors: Driven by RFID mandates, application vendors like
Provia Software, Manhattan Associates, RedPrairie, and SAP now offer
software ranging from RFID-enabled applications for warehouse and
asset management to more robust RFID middleware solutions with
reader coordination, data filtering, and business logic capabilities. Many

That’s no ordinary idiot — that’s a Savant
The crazy standards and terminology of RFID
can confuse even the most educated technical
gurus and RFID veterans. As you may know, the
Auto-ID Center at MIT was the breeding ground
of many of the early RFID standards. One of
those standards was called the Savant, which
the Auto-ID Center originally defined as “a data
router that performs operations such as data
capturing, data monitoring, and data transmis-
sion.” The Auto-ID Center envisioned these
Savants working together in a hierarchical
framework to manage EPC data throughout the
enterprise. Sounds pretty similar to the defini-
tion of RFID middleware that I just laid out, right?
It is. Much of the work that the Auto-ID Center
did to architect and define the Savant standard
is the basis for what we now consider to be
RFID middleware.
When the Auto-ID Center closed in October of
2003, EPCglobal, Inc., a joint venture between
EAN International and the Uniform Code
Council, Inc., carried forth the research com-
pleted by the Auto-ID Center. The previous work
on the Savant standard became a significant
input to efforts now underway and was spear-
headed by EPCglobal’s Software Action Group.
As of February 2005, EPCglobal’s Software
Action Group is currently working to define
standards for several RFID middleware func-
tions, including
 Capturing, securing, and accessing EPC-
related data.
 Obtaining filtered, aggregated data from
several sources. (This standard is some-
times referred to as the ALE standard.)
 Exchanging data and commands between
hosts and readers to do things like read
tags, write to tags, and kill tags.
 Configuring, provisioning, and monitoring
individual readers.
EPCglobal doesn’t actively use the Savant ter-
minology anymore. But because EPCglobal has
not officially published new standards for all
these functions, you still frequently hear the
term Savant used interchangeably with middle-
ware. You can find the latest information about
middleware standards and the Software Action
Group on the EPCglobal Web site, www.
epcglobalinc.org/action_groups/
sag.html.

application vendors like Provia Software and RedPrairie have tackled
this market by striking up relationships with specific middleware ven-
dors. Other vendors, like Manhattan Associates and SAP, have built their
own solutions.
 Platform giants: Vendors like Sun Microsystems, IBM, Oracle, and
Microsoft are extending their application development and middleware
technology stacks to handle RFID requirements. Each of these vendors is
working to amass RFID experience and bring a strategic RFID middleware
architecture — which leverages its standard application-development,
data-management, and process-integration products — to market. These
vendors bring unparalleled experience with highly scalable application
platforms to the table.
However, the platform giants are going about this in different ways. IBM,
for example, partnered with a start-up until it understood enough about
the market and is now producing its own piece of software that directly
competes with its former partner. Sun Microsystems took RFID as a
strategic initiative and began developing the software piece in 2002.
Microsoft has partnered with many companies in 2004 and opened up an
application lab to showcase those solutions built on the .NET platform.
 Integration specialists: Similar to the platform giants, integration spe-
cialists like webMethods, TIBCO Software, and Ascential Software are
adding RFID-specific features like reader coordination and edge-tier filter-
ing to their existing integration broker technologies. These vendors offer
extensive experience with high-volume data and process-integration sce-
narios and have an opportunity to capitalize on RFID adopters that have
already invested heavily in their integration broker technology.
It’s highly unlikely that any one vendor can solve all your RFID middleware
needs. Each type of vendor offers one or more pieces to the middleware
puzzle. The key is to assemble those pieces into a well-orchestrated solution
that fits into your existing architecture. In the next section, I help you do 
just that.
Piecing Together a Middleware
Architecture
To develop a network architecture for your middleware, you need to follow
three key steps:
210
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

1. Understand the RFID middleware architecture tiers.
2. Evaluate your existing middleware investments.
3. Prioritize your middleware needs according to your deployment plans.
In the sections that follow, I walk you through each step in detail, with tips for
customizing your architecture for your business and finding the middleware
and middleware vendors that meet your needs.
No more tiers: Grasping the many levels 
of a middleware architecture
One of the key reasons for the hubbub around RFID is that it gives you 
visibility into what’s going on across all points in your supply chain — from
the receiving dock, to the production line, to transportation vehicles, and
even to the retail store shelves. That’s a lot of data coming from a lot of
sources.
To process RFID data efficiently, middleware functionality can’t be confined to
a centralized data center somewhere in Nebraska. If it were, your network
would come to its knees very quickly. Instead, middleware needs to be dis-
tributed with the right level of logic placed at the right location, or tier, in 
the architecture. I find it easiest to think about an optimal RFID middleware
architecture in three tiers, as shown in Table 11-1.

Figure 11-1 illustrates one possible three-tier architecture, but every com-

architecture that can support the right level of logic at the right location.

Taking stock of existing 
investments and skills
Now that you understand the different tiers of a complete RFID middleware
architecture, it’s time to figure out how you’re going to cobble them all
together. To avoid overbuying, the first step is to identify which tiers, if any,
can be accomplished with technology that you already have inhouse. Chances
are, you’ve already made some investments in other types of middleware,

Chapter 11: Middle Where? It’s Not Just about the Readers

 Application servers: Examples include IBM’s WebSphere Application
Server, BEA’s WebLogic Application Server, and Oracle’s Application
Server.
 Integration brokers: Examples include TIBCO’s BusinessWorks,
SeeBeyond’s eGate Integrator, IBM’s WebSphere Business Integrator,
Microsoft’s BizTalk Server, SAP’s Exchange Integrator, and webMethod’s
Integration Platform.
 Data management and integration tools: Examples include Oracle’s
database, Microsoft’s SQL Server, IBM’s DB2 and/or WebSphere Product
Center, and data-integration tools from Ascential Software.
All these technologies can play a part in your RFID middleware architecture.
For example, existing integration servers — assuming they offer content-based
routing, data transformation, application integration, process management,
and good reliability and scalability features — can take on the middleware
responsibilities that are needed at the enterprise tier. These decisions should
be made after you have a good handle on what the infrastructure architecture
will look like so that you can define your interrogation zones, reader devices
(hand-helds, fixed portals, and so on) and communication and control needs.
Identifying what existing technologies you can use in your RFID middleware
goes hand-in-hand with identifying how you need to expand upon those exist-
ing technologies. Here are some tips for ensuring that the new pieces of your
architecture fit well with existing pieces and inhouse expertise:
 Research which RFID vendors your existing middleware providers
have partnerships with. These partnerships are clues to which solu-
tions will work well with your existing investments. Both TIBCO and
webMethods, for example, have partnerships with OATSystems, which
could provide the features needed at the edge and operational tiers.
Most of the other integration broker vendors have similar partnerships.
 Take stock of which technology skills your staff already has. Knowing
whether you are primarily a Java shop or a .NET (Microsoft) shop will
help you narrow down your choices of vendors because each vendor
tends to excel in one environment over the other. And, because most
RFID middleware tools are still quite immature, your staff is bound to
have to dive into the code and do some customizations.
 Demand real-world use cases of your chosen hardware solutions with
the various middleware players you are considering. In a rush to grab
market share, many middleware providers claim interoperability with all
hardware, readers, printers, and hand-helds. I’ve deployed most of the
major middleware vendors and found that every one of them has a chink
in the armor somewhere. You usually don’t find out about it until you try
to do the install. This is also why it is critically important to install a test
version in your or your partner’s lab.
214
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

If you’re not ecstatic about the investments you’ve already made in enter-
prise integration software from an EAI (enterprise application integration)
vendor or have been considering a switch for some time, now’s the time to
make some hard decisions. EAI tools from vendors like TIBCO, SeeBeyond,
and IBM can be a perfect fit to serve as the foundation for your enterprise
tier. An interesting way of looking at this is with some of the newer Web-
based integration companies like Grand Central as well. But make sure that
you’re happy with the EAI solution before you make it a cornerstone of your
multitiered RFID middleware architecture.
Early bird or late bloomer? Prioritizing
your middleware needs
RFID mandates — which each have unique requirements — have ignited
immediate demand for a wide spectrum of RFID middleware functionality and
have put the RFID middleware industry on the fast track. Still, standards
bodies like EPCglobal are constantly updating middleware standards, and
many of the vendors are working overtime and have adopted accelerated
product release schedules to stay current with changing standards and get
enterprise-class products to market as quickly as possible.
The bottom line: The market — and the products on the market — are 
constantly and rapidly evolving. This makes it absolutely essential to coor-
dinate your RFID middleware investments with your expected RFID rollout
timeframe. Understand the physics first and then design the middleware
solution around your infrastructure and rollout for best results. The middle-
ware space is only getting more and more competitive, so take your time and
make the right decision.
Every company should lay out a long-term multitiered RFID middleware archi-
tecture. But the path to reach that end state will vary, depending on whether
you’re an early adopter who must get started immediately or a company that
has more conservative RFID adoption timeframes:
 Early RFID adopters — particularly those that need to meet fast-
approaching deadlines from retailers like Wal-Mart, Target, and
Albertsons — should start with middleware products that have sophisti-
cated reader coordination and data management tools as well as appli-
cation features like EPC commissioning and track-and-trace tools. Also
look for middleware vendors that have a strong commitment to standards
because such a commitment not only ensures that your initial implemen-
tations hit the ground running but also offer the opportunity to integrate
with a more scalable platform as RFID deployments grow.
215
Chapter 11: Middle Where? It’s Not Just about the Readers

After immediate mandates or pressures to get a specific application of
RFID up and running are behind you, RFID adopters with large-scale RFID
deployment plans should look to larger vendors that can provide scal-
able infrastructure and integration features. These vendors will provide
the backbone for creating for a flexible, multitiered architecture that
supports high-volume data and process integration scenarios.
 Those with more flexible timeframes: Consider your long-term applica-
tion strategy. You have the luxury to plan several years out and create a
middleware strategy that is as scalable as your enterprise architecture
strategy. You also have the time to evaluate large-scale offerings from
some new players in the RFID space who are highly experienced in the
enterprise space — players such as SAP, Oracle, and PeopleSoft.
Getting the Most from 
Your RFID Middleware
With a complete RFID middleware architecture in place, you reap several
immediate and on-going benefits that result from all of middleware’s assorted
functionality, including the following:
 Minimized network traffic through intelligent filtering
 Lower reader-management costs through centrally coordinated readers
 Immediate visibility to pertinent RFID data through routing, filtering, and
track-and-trace tools
 Minimized on-going integration costs through standard APIs and
prepackaged application integration tools
Well-architected RFID middleware can also enable more strategic opportunities
that go way beyond these initial, rather obvious benefits — but only if you
know how to unlock those opportunities. I’ve alluded to these opportunities
a few times earlier in the chapter, but now it’s time to come right out and say it.
The conventional goal of RFID middleware is to intelligently pass RFID data
from readers to enterprise applications, which is a valid goal. But an arguably
more exciting application of RFID middleware is to serve as the foundation
for building new applications that take advantage of real-time, item-level data
216
Part III: Fitting an RFID Application into Your World 

and support new ways of doing business. The benefit of RFID comes from
changing existing business processes. To do this, you must leverage the abil-
ity of RFID to create rules and actions in a true machine-to-machine communi-
cation format. The system should be able to do everything from inventory
forecast cycles to creating pricing strategies.
Admittedly, RFID middleware alone can’t provide everything that’s needed 
to build this new breed of applications. For example, having a monitoring
system that is separate from the data function is a critical component to
keeping the RFID reader network healthy, as I explain in Chapter 14. But 
middleware can and will accelerate the innovation process.

Lessons from a real-life RFID middleware 
evaluation: Pick a deployment scenario
To assess the state of the RFID middleware
market and see how the vendors stack up
against each other, Forrester evaluated lead-
ing RFID middleware vendors using approxi-
mately 75 criteria that spanned everything 
from edge-tier features to enterprise-level
process management. Forrester included 13
RFID middleware vendors in the assessment:
ConnecTerra, GlobeRanger, IBM, Manhattan
Associates, Microsoft, OATSystems, Oracle, RF
Code, SAP, Savi Technology, Sun Microsystems,
TIBCO Software, and webMethods.
The results were so varied across vendors that
it was impossible to do one apples-to-apples
comparison. Instead, Forrester actually sepa-
rated the evaluation into two components: one
that prioritized features essential for early
adopters and one that focused on features most
important for supporting longer-term, high-scale
deployments.

tion of the RFID network. I help you plan for and
deploy your pilot and plan for its on-going impact on your
organization. Going through some of the exercises and
analyses in this part will help you decide on the scope
and timing of your RFID deployment.
You also find out how to set up your own laboratory so
that you can stay abreast of the latest technology, figure
out how specific technology will fit into your environment,
calculate the true cost of that technology, and generally

 Putting together a pilot project plan
 The seven factors of highly successful pilots
 Debriefing for de long run
I
’ve never been accused of being the best planner in the world, but I do
know that having a solid project plan and a capable project manager is
invaluable to the success of any critical technology project. Working through
the plan is where order and execution meet, and in the case of a successful
project, these are brought together by a person whose first career might
have been as drill sergeant at Parris Island. If you’ve been around your com-
pany or the technology world for a while, you may have taken part in other
major new IT initiatives or deployments. And now you’re participating in
planning and executing an RFID deployment. Congratulations!
In Chapter 1, I introduce the Four Ps, which outline the critical overall steps
for a successful RFID deployment. Remember that you need to accomplish
the first two Ps — planning and physics — before you begin a pilot deploy-
ment and then roll out to production. That’s because RFID fundamentally
changes the way that you count and capture inventory data. And beyond the
warehouse environment, this kind of fundamental technology change ripples
throughout your organization. The planning stage includes assessing your
business touch points, which I explain in detail in Chapter 3, and under-
standing the physics of radio frequency and RFID hardware, covered in 
Parts II and III.
Your first foray into RFID is an exciting event — the greatest learning experi-
ence you will undergo. With this in mind, this chapter guides you through 
the pilot and into production. Here, I explain how you put your planning and
physics knowledge to use in order to get the most out of your pilot, from cre-
ating specific milestones to conducting milestone debrief sessions. Looking
back at some of the metrics, the design hypothesis, and the results helps you

build an iterative process for redesign until the system is fully operational and
ready for production. Dress rehearsals provide the opportunity to experiment,
analyze, and correct any unforeseen problems before full RFID integration
and improve the probability of a successful full deployment.
Creating a Pilot Project Plan
This section provides you with a template and format for planning your RFID
pilot deployment project. By working from this template and format, you ben-
efit from established project management methods and get your RFID deploy-
ment off on the right foot.
A project plan that takes into account all the areas of business affected by the
RFID pilot deployment helps you track the project and keep it moving forward
smoothly. Your project plan can be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet that
has timelines and specific categories for the various areas impacted — like
facilities, IT, and business processes. If you are lucky enough to have a copy
of Microsoft Project (and if you know how to use it), your project plan can be
much more sophisticated than a simple spreadsheet. You can find details
about how to use Microsoft Project in Microsoft Project 2003 For Dummies by
Nancy Stevenson (Wiley).
One handy project communication tool I always push for is a project Web
site. Use the Web site to post the original project plan — including the risk
log — as well as any updates so that all team members and stakeholders can
access the information.
Any pilot project plan you set up must provide you with the mechanisms for
outlining the requirements and tasks for your RFID pilot deployment. In addi-
tion, the project plan keeps track of important milestones, lists project par-
ticipants and contributors, and serves as a communication tool used by all
members of the pilot project team. So, if you follow my advice in the upcom-
ing sections and don’t skimp on setting up the right pilot project plan, you
will develop an RFID pilot that will be successful and highly educational for
your team.
If your RFID pilot deployment is like most pilot projects, a number of players
have influence over, input to, or accountability for the project. This fact means
that you’ll be sharing the project plan among many people. And each person
looking at that project plan is likely to make additions, deletions, or comments.
Because your plan has this community aspect, it is critical to protect the plan
integrity by setting up a version control system (a mechanism to denote the
latest updated version) early on. The easiest version control system I’ve found
222
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

uses the file naming convention PROJECTNAME_DATE_VERSION. So you might
have a project plan filename that looks like SHANNON_02172003_1. Each person
who makes changes to the project plan updates the version number and the
date, and if there are multiple changes on the same date, the version number
goes up accordingly.
Start with your major tasks and timeline
No matter what project tools you decide to use (from a simple spreadsheet to
complex project management software), make sure that you include the fol-
lowing critical categories as primary headings in the plan:
 Procurement: This category indicates when you need to procure vari-
ous pieces of equipment, like readers and cabling, and what lead time is
associated with getting those items. So if you are custom making racks
to hold the readers and antennas, working back from ordering the raw
materials is critical.
 Facilities: You need to factor in changes to the facility that need to take
place before you start installing the readers or cabling data communica-
tion. Such changes may include adding power at the various interroga-
tion zones (where the RFID readers will be).
 Business: Identify what processes have to change after the system is
deployed. For example, you might want to specify that the receiving or
picking process changes and that training takes place so that employees
understand those changes. If you plan on using hand-held readers, you
may need to allocate a certain number of days for training on these
items. If your current processes involve rough handling of items, you
may need to ensure that those processes change so that RFID tags that
will be applied to those items aren’t damaged.
 Physical: Include all the things in the physical environment that need to
change — from forklift routes to conveyor sizes — in order to take
advantage of RFID.
 Systems: Critical to the success of RFID is having systems that can take
action on all this real-time serialized data. If you completed the neces-
sary planning, you know how to use the data as the RFID network 
creates it and what applications it will integrate with. Your project man-
agement tools need to break down the tasks involved in producing the
desired end result.
You can construct the project plan on a single worksheet with the five head-
ings just described. Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2 show examples of an Excel
spreadsheet work plan that tracks a pilot project. At the bottom of 
223
Chapter 12: From Pilot to Admiral: Deploying RFID Successfully

Figure 12-2, you can also see a section devoted to key milestones and where
they fall within the project. Important key milestones for an RFID pilot
deployment may include the following:
 Selecting the RFID team and assigning roles and responsibilities
 Understanding the details of any mandates or partner requirements
 Obtaining current metrics for measuring supply chain process and 
efficiency
 Becoming educated on RFID in general
Deliverable tracker
After you lay out the project tasks and timeline and document the critical
milestones of the plan, you can turn your attention to the dependencies and
deliverables associated with each of the sections. Outline the deliverables
and their due dates and then add this list to your project plan as a deliverable
tracker. In project-management lingo, the deliverable tracker is an explanation
of resources that are required to successfully complete the project.
A deliverable in an RFID pilot deployment can be anything from installing
cables at specific locations to training personnel on equipment operation.
Include the deliverable tracker in the same spreadsheet or Microsoft Project
file as your plan’s tasks and timeline. 
Figure 12-1:
The top half
of an Excel
spreadsheet
to track your
RFID pilot.
224
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

You can use the items on your deliverable tracker as checkpoints for your
pilot deployment. I recommend reconciling the deliverable tracker with the
overall project plan (timeline and milestones) on a weekly basis.
There’s always an issue with you: 
Tracking and resolving problems
A third component of your project plan is a mechanism to track any issues
(that is, problems) that may come up as your project progresses. Because our
friend Murphy is always rearing his head to enforce his law (and why don’t
Sully and Malone have a law like Murph does?), having an issue tracker in place
within your project plan is essential. A good issue tracker helps you quickly
resolve issues, get to the right people to take action, and know whether what
you’re doing is the right solution. The issues tracker explains the following:
 Who brought up the problem, in case resolving the problem calls for
further explanation or clarification.
 A definitive timeline to resolve the issue, which is essential for keeping
the project moving forward (a prime reason for having a project plan).
 A single person to take accountability for resolving the issue because,
after all, you want the issue resolved, and making someone responsible
for the resolution is key.
Figure 12-2:
The bottom
half of 
the project
work plan 
in Excel.
225
Chapter 12: From Pilot to Admiral: Deploying RFID Successfully

In the project document, include a page that you can use to track issues,
such as the one shown in Figure 12-3. To make sure that items are being acted
on and people are getting the support and information they need, the project
manager checks the issue tracker weekly. If problems linger in the issue
tracker for a number of weeks, the project manager knows that something
probably either requires higher-level attention or has the potential to jeopar-
dize success in the long run.
There is no I in team (but 
there is an M and an E)
A team roster is the final part of the project document that is critical to keep-
ing your RFID pilot deployment on track and well organized. This roster, as
the last sheet of the project plan, includes critical contact info for all involved
parties. Make sure your team roster includes names, departments or business
affiliations, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers or other such contact
information, and a description of each team member’s role in the project.
Having a complete roster ensures that the project manager can get ahold of
the right people at the right time.

Factors for a Successful Pilot Test
Having a beautifully constructed pilot project plan is a real plus, but other
not-so-easy-to-document factors can give you an extra boost toward accom-
plishing your pilot project goals. In fact, seven critical success factors can
help you deliver your RFID pilot deployment on time and within budget.
These seven factors (described in the upcoming subsections) are
 Clearly defined scope
 Experienced project manager
 Key executive support
 User involvement
 Specific measurements and metrics
 Risk mitigation
 Phased approach
Clearly defined scope
Projects tend to fail due to poorly defined requirements and scope creep.
(No, scope creep isn’t a guy who skulks around clutching a mouthwash
bottle.) Scope creep happens when the original, well-defined project gets
more and more requirements layered onto it — add another read station, send
data to more applications, and so on. To avoid leaving room for ambiguity in
your RFID pilot deployment plan, document the following aspects of your
pilot project:
 Scope: How much, for how long, and so on
 Requirements: What data to collect, what equipment to test, and so on
 Goals: For example, what percent of reads you require to be better than
the current system or specific results you are after, like eliminating two
jobs per shift.
Make sure that your project’s goals and timelines are realistic!
Have all these specifications well-honed before you turn the project over to
an experienced project manager and begin soliciting executive support. You
do much of the work to define the scope when you prepare your business
case for RFID deployment; see Chapter 15 for details.
227
Chapter 12: From Pilot to Admiral: Deploying RFID Successfully

The specification document you create is your road map to determining what
needs to be done and how you measure success. As you detail your require-
ments, think beyond the pilot deployment and consider scalability (that is, how
to adjust the system’s workable size) for the RFID system that will ultimately
roll out to different parts of your business. Always design with the end in mind.
Experienced project manager
The project manager is largely accountable for the success of your RFID pilot
deployment. Make sure that your company chooses a project manager with
the necessary skills and experience in project management methodology and
planning. The project manager’s ability to keep track of the plan and all the
players is crucial to long-term success.
After you recruit a kick-butt project manager and clearly define your project
scope, you have a suitable package to present to key executives for support
of the project.
Key executive support
In Chapter 15, I show you why it’s so important to assemble the right mix of
people to develop a winning approach. Be sure to assemble a cross-functional
project team with a shared vision for RFID deployment and foster cross-area
executive sponsorship and support. Present the project plan, timeline, and
metrics to key executives for sign-off and agreement before putting your plan
into motion.
User involvement
The entire corporation or agency must be engaged in the vision and execu-
tion of the pilot test or full RFID deployment. Obtaining input from key stake-
holders facilitates buy-in and helps you refine your pilot project’s scope,
requirements, and measures of success. Key stakeholders from your business
commonly include the manufacturing team, logistics, finance, and IT. Chapter
15 talks about building a team of these key players, and Chapter 16 offers
more tips for achieving company-wide support for an RFID project.
In some cases, you might also need to engage your suppliers and customers
because they, too, can help support the vision and execution of the RFID pilot
project by deploying their own RFID networks and either sending data back
to you in real time or shipping you products with RFID tags already on them.
228
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

Specific measurements and metrics
Defining the criteria for a successful RFID pilot deployment and telling how
you intend to measure results are imperative. Criteria for measuring the suc-
cess of your inventory management system can be as simple as collecting
data on the number of cases lost each month or as sophisticated as tracking
the average timeline through your entire distribution channel.
For your RFID pilot, document your “as-is” processes and establish specific
performance benchmarks under those existing processes. Then, during the
pilot deployment, measure the performance of your “to-be” processes and
compare against the benchmarks to determine whether you met your suc-
cess criteria.
Look to Chapter 14 for more information on establishing benchmarks and
defining system metrics.
Risk mitigation
During the initial project-planning phase, produce and maintain a risk log and
an associated action plan to mitigate each risk identified. For example, a
potential risk for an RFID pilot project is not being able to do anything with
RFID or EPC (electronic product code) data when your RFID network begins
producing that data in real time. An associated action plan might be to plan
which business applications receive data, create rules for what to do with the
data, and then measure the effectiveness against your existing systems.
Many people, when deploying an RFID pilot, set up an entirely separate stand-
alone system and compare its results with the results of the existing system.
This process is especially useful in security or asset-tracking scenarios in
which manual recording of property is fraught with human errors. A fully
automated RFID system compares quite favorably with the old-fashioned
manual systems.
Publish your risk/mitigating action log for use by your team and your stake-
holders. Knowing what action you plan to take should the worst happen
saves time and helps the pilot project team handle potential showstoppers.
Phased approach
You want to design your RFID pilot deployment test to minimize the impact
on your production environment while simulating your real operation. Using
a phased pilot approach — that is, a series of tests that grow in scale — can
help you achieve this goal.
229
Chapter 12: From Pilot to Admiral: Deploying RFID Successfully

Before you implement RFID for any asset tracking, shrink reduction, or secu-
rity pilot, be sure that you have accurate numbers for the current state of
affairs. Having an accurate baseline metric gives you something to compare
the RFID results to. In security applications, having your current system 
running alongside your pilot RFID system can’t provide an accurate baseline
because just knowing another system is monitoring behavior can make
people act differently and improve statistics.
Your series of tests, or pilot phases, might look something like this:
1. Set up an RFID interrogation zone at only one location. For example:
• A dock door zone that duplicates the work of your current bar
code scanning system: Let the RFID system run for one month and
reconcile your results with those of the bar code system.
• A shrink-wrap station zone that gauges accuracy of case-level
reads on a full pallet of product: Use the average read percentage
as data for your ROI analysis.
• An asset-tracking zone in which only one type of object is
tagged, such as laptop computers: Compare RFID data of that class
of objects (laptops) with sign-in and sign-out sheets, particularly
for secure areas, and reconcile the results.
I explain the general steps for setting up interrogation zones and training
users in Chapter 13.
2. Using your understanding of RFID physics, redesign that one interro-
gation zone until it’s right.
In your team meetings at the pilot stage, focus on the following areas:
• To make sure the technology works properly, compare various
components. How does a circularly polarized antenna compare 
to a linearly polarized antenna? What happens if you change 
the antenna angle by 45 degrees? What if you move the transmitting
antenna back a bit and leave the receiving one where it is? The
pilot helps you develop standard configurations that become
important in your production environment. A team member should
document all these technical attempts and changes so you can
look back as you do future deployments and know what expected
results of various changes should be.
• At the debrief sessions, you may have to address what business
processes need to be done differently and test those changes in
the pilot environment. For instance, say that one of your goals is
to get 100 percent case reads as pallets pass through a dock door.
If the technology is correctly set up and optimized and you’re still
not getting 100 percent, you can try changing the business
process. Making the forklift driver stop for 10 or 15 seconds may
give the system enough time to meet your goals.
230
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

At the pilot stage, if you decide to change some of your existing
business processes, it is critical to design the system so that those
changes can be incorporated and then communicated back to the
humans interoperating with the RFID network. This could be as
simple as setting up a red light/green light timer for the dock door
or a buzzer after the 10 or 15 seconds is up.
3. After you are successful with one dock door portal, conveyor, or
shrink-wrap station, start your next deployment or phase of the pilot
next to the first one.
Putting the two pilot deployments side by side enables you to understand
the challenges inherent in a multiple reader environment and helps your
team learn the nuances and importance of proper configuration and
setup of the readers.
By phasing the pilot, you gain more focus and control, using your measures of
success for gating (making the go-ahead decision to move on to the production
phase). In your final pilot phase, you move on to a live trial test — that is, a
production trial with live product and data.
Moving from Pilot to Production
Moving from a pilot into a production environment is the difference between
grade school and college, involving a lot more complexity, not as much con-
trol, a whole lot of unknowns, and the occasional embarrassing outbreak of
acne. After your successful completion of the pilot and initial deployment, the
project debrief is a critical step toward moving from pilot to full deployment.
Getting the most of your pilot data: 
The project debrief
For a project debrief, you need to follow these steps to cull the important
lessons from your pilot data:
1. Collect as much relevant data from the test as possible.
The most important data is, of course, how the RFID methodology com-
pares with what was being used before (bar code, manual systems, and
the like), but also includes things like setup time, equipment lead time,
costs associated with the project, and so on.
231
Chapter 12: From Pilot to Admiral: Deploying RFID Successfully

2. Organize the data in the categories you originally set out for the 
project plan.
For example, your IT category might show the impact of increased stor-
age needs, or another system to be added to a view in a network opera-
tions center.
3. Schedule the team together for a full-day working session. During this
session, the team evaluates
• How well the original goals of the RFID project were met
• What the next steps in the RFID process are: A valuable way to do
this is to incorporate the actual learned data into an ROI analysis.
Based on this analysis, rate the areas impacted the most from the
process, reassess potential benefits, and refine the next steps.
4. Present all the distilled and summarized information, including next
steps and their budgetary requirements, to senior management.
Trust me: CEOs like to have as much work done for them as possible.
Give them the good, the bad, the ugly, and what’s next for the project
and why.
After you understand how your enterprise is going to react to an RFID
system, you have a better understanding of what issues you should focus
your deployment on.
Tips for a successful production system
The goal for your production environment is to make the transition to RFID
as effective and low-maintenance as possible. The best way to do this is to
 Standardize your tag type.
 Limit the number of different readers you use to one or two. On rare
occasions, you may need three different kinds of readers to achieve opti-
mal results, but usually two different types can cover most applications.
If you design with the end in mind, you set up the readers to perform well 
in a system environment during your pilot. So at this stage, during your full
deployment, you are able to take two dock door configurations and set them
up next to each other with no interference issues, no ghost reads, and great
accuracy.

FID makes all transactions automatic, doesn’t it? In an ideal world, yes.
But then, in an ideal world, all the work is completed while you’re at
home having breakfast or bungee jumping out of a hot-air balloon.
By the time you get to your pilot or production deployment, you may be
tempted to think that you’re almost done, that the machines will be taking
over soon. Well, RFID enables more efficient operations, but we humans must
still know what those operations are and how to execute them. You have
come a long way, but setting up a pilot or production deployment is just
another step in the learning and implementation process that you have
undertaken.
Your pilot deployment is your opportunity to put the pieces together and see
how your efforts in the lab (see Chapter 8) pan out in your actual manufac-
turing environment. As I stress throughout this book, an understanding of
physics is the cornerstone of a solid foundation in RFID (see Part II). In this
chapter, you put that understanding to use in order to set up the equipment
correctly. A pilot is an iterative process: Based on what you discover during
your first pilot, you can continually redesign the system until you’re ready for
production rollout.
Chapter 12 explains how you move from pilot to production from a project
management perspective. This chapter explains the hands-on information
you need to set up equipment and processes so that you capture the neces-
sary data accurately and reliably. Your staff also needs to understand how to
use the RFID systems so that you achieve maximum benefit from RFID, so I
offer tips for training staff in this chapter, as well.

Configuring and Setting Up Tag Readers
Someday, readers will be completely self-configuring: They’ll automatically
know where to read tags, configure themselves for optimum performance,
and download all the right applications to properly handle the read data.
Until that day of RFID nirvana comes, however, you need an expert to locate
and configure readers manually by using sound principles of physics and a
deep understanding of the various types of hardware available.
If you’re in the pilot stages, focus on finding the right hardware and playing
with various configuration classes — one configuration for the dock door,
one for the conveyor, and so on. If you’re ready for full production deploy-
ment, you know from your pilot data what configuration classes to use for
various locations and what hardware is optimal for the entire planned RFID
network. You just need to carry out the implementation accurately.
Your staff relies on the readers being properly configured so that they (your
staff) can just do their jobs. So it is imperative that the readers — whether
fixed-location, mobile, or hand-held — are properly configured and ready for
use when the shift begins.
Before you begin
As I say throughout this book, you need to design with the end in mind.
That’s why proper reader configuration begins with the planning stages.
Before you begin setting up the actual interrogation zones, you and your RFID
team need to figure out the following:
 Where you want to set up interrogation zones to read tags (Chapter 3)
 Where and how power and network connections can be made avail-
able to the readers: In addition to actually installing cables, you need to
know how to protect cables connecting a reader to its antennas. You
need a plan to ensure that no one line of the power feed is overloaded.
Similarly, the network must not be overburdened with traffic, and the
use of Ethernet for network communication limits the maximum dis-
tance between repeaters or routers. (Chapter 3)
 Which tags you want to use (Chapter 5)
 The right reader for the required job (Chapter 10)
 The total area the readers need to cover: Basically, this means that you
need to know how many antennas you need to get the desired perfor-
mance, without interfering with other systems. (Chapter 10)
234
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

Stepping through a reader setup
Although each interrogation zone setup is unique, this section gives you a
general idea of the steps for putting the puzzle together and offers tips that
can help along the way. Here are the basic steps involved:
1. Mount the reader (see Chapter 10 for details).
2. Attach the reader antenna in the appropriate location and make sure
its orientation is correct.
When locating new antennas, take care to minimize potential RF interfer-
ence. Make sure directional antennas aren’t pointed directly at one
another, regardless of distance, unless their operation is synchronized
(that is, if you have configured the reader to cycle through the antennas
in a specific order or you are using software that coordinates the cycling
of antennas). Unsynchronized operation can lead to unpredictable
behavior due to tag confusion and reader interference. See Chapter 10
for more details about antenna setup.
If this is your first pilot setup, remember to check for differences
between your lab environment and your actual environment. Laboratory
environments are, by definition, experimental. These differences might
impact installation of the reader and antennas and might impact the RF
performance of the system. You may need to reevaluate the system in its
actual installation, which of course is what the pilot is all about.
3. Mark the correct location and orientation of the antenna by drawing
permanent lines on all the brackets (if possible).
By marking the correct setup, you can quickly identify and properly
orient an antenna, which is critical to the maintenance of the system.
Plywood templates may also be used to simplify the reorientation of the
antennas.
4. Run all the needed power and cables to the reader and power up the
reader once the antennas are connected.
5. Test the interrogation zone for path loss (see Chapter 10).
6. Tweak the reader’s configuration settings as needed.
Work from the settings you determined in the lab (see Part III). Although
you may be tempted to tweak the configuration as needed through trial
and error, it’s more effective to work from the laws of physics and the
known behavior of the frequency and system you are deploying.
Look out for configurations that leave overlapping interrogation pat-
terns from unsynchronized antennas. Such overlaps can cause unpre-
dictable system performance due to tag confusion.
235
Chapter 13: Getting Set to Administer and Maintain Your System

I discuss the details of configuration files and how to store them in
“Creating configuration classes,” later in this chapter.
7. Set up an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for each reader.
A UPS protects your data in the event of a power outage.
8. Your business process may require that, in order to take full advan-
tage of the capabilities of RFID systems, you set up a “verification
tunnel” to ensure that all tags on a pallet load or contained within a
reusable container are read.
To set up this tunnel, you need to find out what your system level perfor-
mance and hardware requirement is. For instance, Wal-Mart demands
read performance on a 10-foot wide dock door with varying antenna con-
figurations. Today those would be deployed over a Matrics AR-400 reader
(which is now being produced by Symbol Technologies). If you want to
verify that Wal-Mart can read your tagged items, you can build a stand-
alone 10-foot-wide portal and set up Wal-Mart’s configuration. To verify
performance, have your forklift driver go through this portal and receive
a visual cue, such as a red light or green light, to determine whether he
should load the pallet for shipment to Wal-Mart.
Verified reads may be checked against the manifest to ensure 100-percent
order delivery. This is a critical compliance step when the financial sys-
tems are integrated with the detailed delivery of products.
9. If you use hand-held and mobile readers, don’t forget to set up desig-
nated charge stations where users recharge the batteries on these
devices, and also upload any necessary data to the central system if
there is no wireless communication.
These charge stations must be both convenient and protected from
physical damage.
10. Set up and test monitoring systems for both the users and the system
administrator.
The only way that you can have 24/7 support within an RFID network is
to have the readers actively monitored and constantly checked for per-
formance. I explain monitoring in Chapter 14.
Creating configuration classes
When I say “creating configuration classes,” I’m not talking about teaching
RFID to your kids. I’m talking about creating a standard setup for the various
areas where you’ll set up RFID interrogation zones. During your pilot, you
determine how many configuration classes you need and what the right
setup is for each one.
236
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

To the extent possible, try to create a limited number of configuration classes
so that adding new interrogation zones to your RFID system is as simple as
identifying its class, pushing the configuration out to the reader, and adding it
to the monitoring system.
Configuration classes are stored in a database and look something like 
Table 13-1.

Chapter 13: Getting Set to Administer and Maintain Your System

Here are some tips for creating configuration files:
 Store the reader configuration file in a secured database that has limited
access.
 Develop the configuration file in a program that can interoperate with
any open database connectivity (ODBC) database because many moni-
toring, management, and middleware programs may end up accessing
the configuration files.
 Make sure you fully back up your configuration files to tape or disc once
a month, and do incremental back-ups at least weekly, but preferably
daily. Daily incremental back-ups are particularly important as you build
out your network and as things change daily.
Getting the Digits
One of the biggest benefits of RFID over bar codes is the capability to
uniquely number every item. Typically, you encode this number into each tag
just before applying the tags to objects.
Most of the deployments I have set up so far encode tags with an RFID label
printer. Zebra, Printronix, and Paxar bar code printers can have an RFID
module embedded in them that allows them to work as both an RFID label
printer and also as traditional bar code printer. The module broadcasts a spe-
cial command with a discrete number (usually an EPC number) through the
transmit (Tx) antenna, and that number is “written” onto the tag. Some of the
deployments have used the readers to directly commission (write to) the tags.
The operation is always controlled by some form of software — see Chapter
11 for more about the issues surrounding middleware features. Whether you
use an RFID label printer or write to the tags directly through the readers, the
technical aspect of sending a specific RF signal out the antenna with a write
command is always the same.
Unique item identification has tremendous benefits, but assigning and manag-
ing unique item-level identification can be burdensome and difficult if not
done properly. Having a numbering structure and a system for assigning num-
bers can simplify the allocation and management of unique numbers. The fol-
lowing sections explain proven methods for managing numbers.
A simple hierarchy for assigning numbers
All numbering schemes in use — whether for open RFID systems, such as the
ones that enable retailers and suppliers to share information, or for closed
systems, like the ones libraries use — rely on some sort of numbering hierar-
chy. All you need to do is understand the hierarchy so that you can use it to
your advantage in assigning unique identifiers to all your items.
238
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

The general identifier of the electronic product code (EPC) is a good example:
The general identifier EPC comprises three numbers whose combination
uniquely identifies an item. Those three numbers are the manufacturer
number, the product number, and the serial number. EPCglobal, the manager
of the general identifier EPC, assigns a unique manufacturer number (also
called an EPC Manager Number) to each of its member organizations. Each
member organization is free to assign a product number (also called an Object
Class) to each of that member’s products. Similarly, each member is free to
assign a serial number to each item manufactured by that member. Here’s how
you might take advantage of this hierarchy to uniquely identify an item:
 Assign the same product number to all products with the same proper-
ties. Thus, all 16-ounce blue bottles of Fabulous Fiber are assigned the
same product number. All 24-ounce bottles are allocated a different
product number. This is the basic approach used today by most product
manufacturers.
 Assign each item in a product line a unique serial number. In this way,
you can distinguish one 16-ounce blue bottle of Fabulous Fiber from
another bottle just like it.
Serial numbers are new to the fast-moving consumer goods market, but
they have been in wide use in the electronics, automotive, and aero-
space industries, among others, for a very long time.
Allocating unique numbers across 
many lines and locations
Because all products of the same type receive the same product number, the
serial numbers must be maintained in order to enable unique item identifica-
tion. When a product is manufactured on exactly one production line at
exactly one location, assigning unique serial numbers to every item manufac-
tured is straightforward. A central numbering allocation authority may be
used. Difficulties arise when multiple lines, potentially at multiple locations,
are used to manufacture the same product.
When multiple manufacturing lines are used to manufacture the same product,
a centralized numbering authority is more difficult to manage. The centralized
authority must be consulted every time an item is produced, requiring that it
be accessible over the network whenever production runs are in process. A
centralized authority that is always reachable and is able to assign numbers at
production speeds can efficiently use the numbering space. Additionally, care-
ful details must also be maintained about which line an item was produced on.
An always-accessible central numbering authority isn’t practical for many
companies. These companies can use an intelligent hierarchy imposed on the
serial number allocation to decentralize and make feasible the allocation of
unique serial numbers across all manufacturing lines.
239
Chapter 13: Getting Set to Administer and Maintain Your System

Here’s a simple example of a decentralized, hierarchical approach to allocat-
ing serial numbers. A range of serial numbers for each product is allocated to
each manufacturing facility. Within a facility, a range of numbers from those
allocated to the facility is allocated to each line producing a particular prod-
uct. In this way, the serial number is effectively subdivided into a facility
number, line number, and subserial number, in which the allocation hierarchy
is maintained between facility number and line number.
Remember to assign a line number for hand-applied tags that replace dam-
aged or nonfunctioning tags. You need to look at your business processes to
determine the best way to incorporate this.
Applying Tags to Objects
Eventually, all tags will be placed on products automatically, either on the
packaging prior to receiving it or on-line within your facility. Until then, tags
need to be manually placed on items.
When you apply tags to objects (or train staff to do so), you need to keep two
important factors in mind:
 Be sure you handle tags in a way that doesn’t put stress on the tag’s
connections and parts. Broken tags don’t communicate well (if at all)
and thus make your system less effective. See the sidebar, “Armor-plated
tags,” for details on emerging solutions to these vulnerabilities.
 Place the tag in the optimal spot on the object. During your testing (see
Part III), you determine where the tag antenna can best couple (communi-
cate) with the reader antenna. Some of the early adopters have already
started printing tag outlines on their case boxes so that workers applying
them know exactly where the tag goes and what the correct orientation is.
The following sections explain how you can work around these two factors as
you apply the tags.
Applying tags without breaking them
Manually manipulating tags always has the potential hazard of physically
damaging them. You can minimize the physical stress placed upon the tags
by always following these steps when applying tags by hand:
1. Place the label face down on a flat surface with the backing paper face
up; the face of the label is therefore down on the table or flat surface.
2. Peel the backing paper away from the label while keeping the label
flat on the surface.
240
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

3. Without bending or twisting the label, lift it from the flat surface.
Care must always be taken so as not to bend or twist the tags. Bending
or twisting a paper tag places stress on the connections between the
chip and the antenna. This stress may crack the connecting material,
often a conducting glue, or it may break the connection completely.
4. Position the label over the correct location on the object and
smoothly apply it to the surface.
Similar care must be taken when pressing the label onto its final resting
spot. Excessive pressure on the silicon chip can crack it, or, more likely,
damage the connections between the chip and the antenna.
North by northwest as the corrugation
travels: Orienting tags on objects
Your testing determines the best location and orientation to read a tag (see
Chapter 9). When you set up your pilot or production system, applying the
tag in just the right spot is particularly important so you know that the limit-
ing factor is not the tag or the tag placement. Linear antenna tags, such as a
simple and commonly used dipole antenna tag, which must be properly ori-
ented on the package to ensure readability, are especially vulnerable to mis-
reads caused by incorrect orientation.
241
Chapter 13: Getting Set to Administer and Maintain Your System
Armor-plated tags
With all the talk about nanotechnology, you’d
think someone could come up with chain mail
for RFID tags to keep them better protected from
cracking and breaking. Cracked connections
cause two difficulties:
 The first difficulty is decreased perfor-
mance for the tag. Although the tag might
still operate, it will harvest energy less effi-
ciently and communicate with the reader
less efficiently. Often, this means that the
tag is successfully commissioned or written
to, but when it gets to your verification
portal (or worse yet, your client’s), it may not
work at all.
 The second difficulty is that future shock or
vibration may extend the crack, eventually
completely breaking the connection.
Most of the tags in use today are vulnerable to
cracked connections because they’re made
using a flip-chip technology. In the flip-chip
process, the chip is “flipped” onto the antenna
inlay with a special adhesive, which is less
durable than a directly soldered connection. You
can find companies that make soldered con-
nections to antennas. There is even a company
called Appleton Industries that adds a special
high-durability coating to tags in an effort to
make them more durable.

When the tags are applied manually, a simple diagram illustrating the proper
tag location and orientation helps operators apply tags correctly. Figure 13-1
shows an example of how a box might be premarked for a production worker.
Sending Objects through Your Business
With the unique identifiers loaded into your tags and the tags applied cor-
rectly to the objects, you’re ready to see how the whole system works
together. During your pilot, you may need to assess and adjust your business
processes so that tagged objects are oriented correctly as they move through
your manufacturing line and to ensure that your equipment isn’t damaged.
Lining up tags and readers
As you send items through manufacturing, remember that some items, partic-
ularly metal-wrapped products, allow an item’s tag to be read from only a
single direction. This is truer for some tags than for others. Physics once
again rears its unwavering head.
You need to consider, in addition to the materials in your object, the physics
of your RFID equipment. For orientation-sensitive items such as linearly
polarized tags and readers, the orientation of the tag to the reader is crucial
to reading the tag reliably. A linearly polarized reader antenna can read a lin-
early polarized tag antenna only if both antennas are oriented in the same
plane. Practically, this means that if the reader antenna is oriented vertically,
the tag antenna must be oriented vertically as well. Linear tags that are 
oriented horizontally will not be read by vertically oriented linear reader

Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

antennas. In fact, if you take a linearly polarized antenna, hold a linearly
polarized tag in front of it, and rotate the tag 90 degrees, you can watch it dis-
appear as far as the reader is concerned. (Don’t worry; it will still be in your
hand or on the box, but the reader won’t see it. This is physics, not magic.) I
explain the rules of physics that govern this behavior in Chapter 5.
Here are some tips for ensuring that objects are properly oriented when pre-
sented to the reader antennas:
 If the boxes are stacked a particular way in the pallet, during your tag
testing, evaluate for a location that faces outward (usually the end of a
box). If you know the minimum performance threshold or use the ODIN
tag performance index (TPI) to determine the minimum threshold (for
example, a TPI of 70 percent may be required to meet your mandate),
you can try to test for a 70-percent result on the side of cases that face
outward on each pallet. See Chapter 9 for more on the ODIN TPI.
 On a conveyor belt, side application is usually the easiest way to ensure
correct read because the reader antennas are likely to be mounted along
the sides of the conveyor. Mounting tags on the top works for conveyor
alone but can be very difficult if you need to read cases on a stacked
pallet later in the process.
Just like the neonatal ward: 
Handle with care
As I mention earlier in this chapter, damage to either a tag’s chip or its con-
nections to the antenna renders the tag inoperable. For labels that are
located on the exterior of the packaging, the chip is vulnerable to impact
from neighboring items.
If you run your finger over a label tag, you can feel the chip through the
paper packaging as a very small bump, usually in the center of the tag. Being
very small, the chip is surprisingly resilient to breaks; however, it is not inde-
structible. Because the chip protrudes beyond the label (hence the bump), it
is vulnerable to
 Impacts from several angles. The impact from hitting a neighboring
item may be sufficient to break the chip.
 Being caught and twisted in conveyor belts and other equipment.
During your pilot, identify whether these vulnerabilities are affecting tags by
putting a series of pallets through an end-to-end test with your trading part-
ner. Where the pallets are loaded, record the condition of the RFID tags on
the cases (a digital camera up close works great for this) and then get to the
partner’s distribution center or store when your pallet arrives and record any
areas that might have been impacted in transit. You should be able to clearly
243
Chapter 13: Getting Set to Administer and Maintain Your System

identify areas on pallets and cases that have been rubbed, bumped, or torn
from a simple visual inspection.
If you want to get more involved than a simple visual inspection, some uni-
versities, such as Michigan State, have special equipment to simulate travel
in the back of a truck — bumps, rattles, shakes, and all.
To correct the problem, figure out how you can change business processes —
handling packages roughly should be at the top of the list of things to change.
This is not to say that packages need to be treated with kid gloves. Certainly
not. Just keep in mind that commercial from the 1980s in which gorillas throw
luggage around an airport baggage handling system — a perfect example of
the line being crossed while at the same time the rules of personal grooming
being violated.
School’s in Session — Training Your Staff
After you set up your system for a pilot or production deployment and make
sure it is configured properly, you need to train your staff to use the equip-
ment. Although they don’t need to be RFID experts, the people who interact
with the system on a daily basis must know how to do the following tasks
properly so that your RFID deployment is successful:
 Start the system (if it isn’t always on and operators need to start it 
manually)
 Use software applications (such as which buttons to push and when)
 Use the hardware (such as the point-and-shoot of hand-held readers)
 Apply tags to unlabeled items
 Orient tagged items as they move through your business so that the
system achieves the best read performance
All operators must be trained to use the system. Even the simplest and most
obvious of tasks, such as pushing a red button, may not be so simple or obvi-
ous while using the system.
In addition to knowing how to use the system, your staff must be supportive
of the system. Teaching them the personal benefits of an RFID system is just
as important as teaching them the benefits to the company.
Starting readers manually
Most fixed-location readers are either always attempting to read tags or begin
reading automatically when some event occurs, such as a dock door opening.
244
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

However, when a reading location is seldom used or otherwise requires that
the operator manually start the fixed-location readers, a simple, detailed
process must be in place to ensure that the readers are operating before the
operator expects tag reads to occur.
The best way to start a seldom-used reader is to have a terminal or worksta-
tion in close proximity to the reading station so that the operator simply
presses the Start button and waits for the green “working” light.
Most installations don’t have a co-located terminal and have a more complex
start-up process. The operators must be trained in the appropriate process.
In addition to the training, post the steps next to the reading location for
those times when a novice operator is the only one available. Typically, the
basic set of steps resembles the following process:
1. Make sure antennas are connected to the RFID readers.
2. Make sure the equipment is plugged into its power source.
3. Turn on the equipment (a special sequence may be required).
4. Check that the antennas are correctly oriented and have not been
moved.
5. Wait for the green “working” light.
6. Begin moving tagged objects through the read station.
Although ensuring that the equipment is plugged in may seem obvious, it is
surprisingly not when someone’s actually in the field trying to debug a non-
working system. You may have experienced this phenomenon in your own
home: Say your lamp is usually plugged in, but someone unplugs it in favor of a
drill, a fan, or some other device that for a short moment might be more impor-
tant. Of course, people rarely plug an appliance back in when they’re done, so
whoever tries to turn on the lamp later that day ends up scavenging the house
for a new light bulb before realizing the lamp was simply unplugged all along. In
the warehouse, it’s a little embarrassing to realize a reader is just unplugged
while you’re on the phone to your system administrator or technical support,
so remember to include Step 2 when you post the steps on the wall.
Identifying and responding 
to missed reads
Using an RFID system includes knowing when RFID reads are to occur and, if
the process requires it, verifying that the reads occurred. The operators must
be trained to identify a proper read, and the system must provide this feed-
back to the operator. For fixed-location readers, colored light stacks, such as
red, yellow, and green lights, provide usable feedback to the operators. Figure
13-2 shows just such a light stack in use. For hand-held readers, the ubiqui-
tous “beep” has proven effective.
245
Chapter 13: Getting Set to Administer and Maintain Your System

Regardless of the feedback, the operator must be trained on the process to
obtain the desired level of benefit from the system. For fixed-location readers,
the appropriate actions based on system feedback (or the lack of feedback)
may be to slow down, or even stop, the movement of tagged products until
the desired feedback occurs. Here’s how operators might respond when a
reader doesn’t produce the desired feedback:
 If the system is designed to allow multiple reads of an item moving
through a read zone, the operator must be trained to repeat a process
until reads are confirmed.
 If the system cannot handle multiple reads because, for example, a
tag’s location within or outside of a caged area is determined by the
number of reads, the operator must be trained not to repeat the reading
process. Another process, such as accessing a computer terminal, must
be used to verify reads or to reset the system so that the read process
can be repeated.
Reinforcing processes 
versus changing them
It’s human nature for people to always follow the simplest set of procedures
that achieves their ultimate goal. You’ll likely discover that operators will cir-
cumvent or ignore official procedures that get in the way of these simpler
operations.

Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

Perhaps the best illustration of official procedures being circumvented comes
from the use of bar codes on patients and medicines in the hospital. Nurses
scan the bar codes of the medicines they are to administer and then scan the
bar code on the wristband of the patient that is to receive the medicines. The
system verifies that the right patient is receiving the right drugs and notifies
the nurse if a potential error has occurred. This is a practical safety measure
that, when executed properly, eliminates medication errors within the hospi-
tal. However, practice does not always follow official process. In some hospi-
tals, it is common for the medication cart to remain in the hallway while the
nurse brings the drugs to the patient. In these instances, the nurse scans the
drugs at the table in the hallway and then scans the bar code on the patient’s
chart that is also in the hallway. Although this user-modified process greatly
decreases the likelihood of errors (compared to not using any bar code
system at all), the process still leaves room for error, making the system less
effective than it could be at catching human error.
Although not all process alterations have such potentially deadly conse-
quences, this example illustrates that human habits are hard to deny and
even harder to change. As you work through your pilot and production
deployments, evaluate whether operators use the system as your RFID team
has designed it. Some user-initiated processes cause a decrease in perfor-
mance, whereas other user-initiated process alterations yield more efficient
operations. You may be able to redesign the system to overcome the problem
in the process and take advantage of efficiencies that operators develop.
After all, RFID systems are supposed to increase the efficiency of their work,
not increase their workload.
When you can’t accommodate user-initiated process alterations by redesign-
ing the system, you need to retrain the operators. Remember to include in
this training the reasons why the official process improves efficiency. Also
consider making adherence to the official processes one of the performance
metrics for performance evaluations. Thus, following the official process
becomes a job requirement.
Explaining how RFID affects employees
Many employees and employee groups, such as worker’s unions, are afraid of
the impact RFID will have on jobs. And rightly so — a well-designed RFID net-
work can eliminate some human jobs (like orienting packages so the bar
codes are correctly positioned on a conveyor).
It’s up to company leadership and the RFID committee to make sure that the
workers affected by the RFID deployment understand exactly what is going to
happen to their jobs and how they benefit from the RFID deployment.

I
remember as a kid growing up, my mom would make cookies and she’d
let me have a few when I got home from school and maybe a couple after I
ate all my dinner, but that was it. Later, while Mom was watching TV, I would
sneak into the kitchen and climb up onto the counter to reach those cookies
on top of the fridge and add to my caloric energy store for a good night’s
sleep. What do cookies have to do with RFID? Well, not that much, except for
the need to monitor them. Mom just wasn’t very good at it, and, consequently,
Pops didn’t get any cookies by the time he got home. I don’t want you to be
like that with your RFID system because if you’re not very good at monitoring
it, Pops won’t pay the price. Your bottom line will.
This chapter gets you up to speed on how to keep an eye on all your RFID
readers. I explain the two basic types of monitoring. The first is simply check-
ing that your reader is active. The other type of monitoring focuses on the
behavior of your system. The goal of this type of monitoring is to devise ways
of measuring how readers are working and then, using these measurements,
detect, anticipate, and solve problems that arise with individual as well as
multiple readers at the site. In this chapter, you find out how to set up moni-
toring as you roll out your RFID system and how monitoring helps you keep
that system (and your bottom line) in good shape.

Why Monitor an RFID Station?
In a phrase — 24/7 — that’s what you need out of most RFID systems once
they are production. In the process of setting up an RFID system, you exam-
ine the physics of RFID and how various system components work together
in your environment. This analysis ensures that the antennas in an RFID sta-
tion are optimally positioned and aligned. A fully operational RFID system is
only a first step, however. After you have selected, tested, and installed an
RFID reader with its antenna array (the “station”), a relatively large number of
problems can arise. Here are some examples:
 A reader can be turned off for maintenance or simply because it is not
being used, and then be overlooked and remain off.
 A power failure can reset or wipe out the configuration of the reader.
 The antennas can be placed in a high-traffic area so that people or
machines (such as forklifts) regularly block their ability to read tags.
 A reader can fail to detect tags or begin to detect ghost or spurious tags
due to a hardware or software fault.
 The communication network between the reader and the middleware
(savant) can go down or become overloaded.
 The antennas can be improperly placed (they may have worked well for
your test cases, but fail to pick up tags in a production environment).
 Your site can be periodically (or constantly) flooded with radio fre-
quency traffic in the same bandwidth as your RFID system (normally
this would be 902 to 928 MHz). Hand-held barcode readers, as an exam-
ple, often collide with the RFID spectrum.
 A change in the structure of your facility (such as adding new walls,
building a new containment cage, adding or moving a conveyor, or
installing a mobile wrapping station) can interfere with one or more pre-
viously working RFID stations.
 The reader or one or more of its antennas may be defective. Equipment
defects often show up gradually over time.
 A reader software update by the vendor or new generation of tags can
cause unexpected problems in reading tags.
 A reader can be burned out when the antenna leads are disconnected
and power is still on.
 The strength of the antenna’s electromagnetic (EM) field can be insuffi-
cient to read outlier tags or can be so strong that it reads tags in a neigh-
boring RFID station (such as an adjoining bay door).
 Packages, pallets, containers, or other RFID tagged objects move too
quickly to be accurately read.
250
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

These problems arise in the ordinary operation of an RFID workstation, and
some of them arise on a more or less regular basis. Because every RFID sta-
tion encounters performance and operational errors at some point, you must
pay close attention to how the readers are working and know when any
reader shows some sign of anomalous behavior.
Setting Up Two Types of Monitoring
Monitoring systems come in two basic forms, and you need both to keep
your system running as smoothly as possible. The first form is basic status
monitoring, and the second is monitoring the behavior of your system.
 Monitoring the basic status: This monitoring is your first line of defense
in troubleshooting and preventing problems with your data. It includes
having a light or other simple feedback system in place so that operators
know whether a read is successful or unsuccessful and how to respond
to unsuccessful reads. In addition, the system administrator monitors the
basic status of the RFID network as a whole. Simple status-indicator
panels on the administrator’s computer desktop enable him or her to
monitor all read locations from a single location. The administrator
needs basic status information such as network connectivity, power to
the units, and which antennas are operating.
 Monitoring system behavior: You monitor system behavior by gather-
ing usage statistics, such as read rates and read accuracy. This data
about the system enables the administrator to understand how the
system behaves normally and to detect signs that something is awry.
Particularly when plotted over time, both sudden and gradual perfor-
mance decreases can be quickly identified.
Checking That a Reader Is Active
When a monitoring system first starts up, and also regularly throughout the
day, it must interrogate each reader, essentially asking the reader whether 
or not it is alive. If the reader does not respond, it has been turned off, is
unavailable through the network, or has suffered a fault in its internal soft-
ware. This section helps you weigh your options for checking readers over
the network. You also need to set up simple feedback for operators so that
they can effectively monitor whether the system is working in order to get
their jobs done.
Determining whether a reader is active is not associated with periodic behav-
ior over time (like monitoring behavior). Although you don’t normally expect
to see a pattern of unavailable readers, patterns of unavailability are often
251
Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

critically important when they emerge. Such patterns often mean that a
reader is suffering from a mechanical defect, that a site suffers from regular
power outages, or that the power cables for a reader are subject to damage
or accidental disconnection.
Choosing the right method
How do you determine if a reader is active? There are basically two ways.
The first is through the ping command, and the second is through the net-
work management capabilities of SNMP (Simple Network Management
Protocol).
Although the ping command is the simplest method, it has some serious
drawbacks. Foremost among them, ping cannot tell you whether the reader
is actually working. The ping command is equivalent to calling your friend
George on the telephone. If the telephone rings, you know that George’s tele-
phone is connected to the communications network, but you don’t know if
George is actually home or if the telephone handset is working. If George
picks up the phone and says “Hello,” well, then you know that the telephone
is connected, George is home, and the telephone is able to sustain a commu-
nication link between yourself and George. An equivalent approach is needed
for RFID readers. You need to know that the reader is connected (that is, it is
physically visible on the network) and that it is capable of communicating
with the outside world (that is, it is able to send messages; essentially, that
someone is home inside the reader!). To do this, turn to SNMP.
SNMP was introduced in 1988 and has evolved as the standard for network
management. Its ubiquity across nearly all families of network devices is due
to its relative simplicity and its sparse code requirements.
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a system as well
as applications layer service protocol that allows the easy exchange of status
and performance information between networked devices. SNMP is a compo-
nent of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (or TCP/IP). By
using SNMP, a system administrator (or a monitoring software system) can
determine whether a device is visible on the network and query the device.
By querying the device, an SNMP interface can determine not only that the
device is connected, but also that it can send and receive.
A simple human interface: Enabling 
operators to monitor the system
As long as we humans are running and monitoring RFID systems, we must
know how well the system is operating. Early detection of missed reads and
252
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

faulty or ill-functioning readers reduce operating costs and make the system
run smoothly. If you deploy an RFID network in warehouses, production
floors, and the like, workers who use the system in the course of doing their
jobs become your first line of defense in detecting problems with reads.
Because these workers may have little or no technical knowledge (and also
because you want to make their jobs simpler, not more complicated), you
need a simple interface that enables these workers to monitor whether the
system is working as it should.
The two simplest forms of feedback are sounds (beeps) and status lights.
 Sounds are very good for giving feedback on human-initiated actions,
such as reading a tag with a hand-held reader. Simple beeps provide
immediate feedback without the need for the operators to remove their
eyes from the task at hand. Fixed-location readers, in which the operator
actively monitors the activities, may also use sound as a feasible feed-
back. However, care must be taken not to overload the operator. A beep
indicating the read of every object is easily tuned out and ignored when
large numbers of objects are being identified.
 Status color highlights (or simply a “color light”) are very good for pro-
viding feedback when the operator is looking for it or when he may oth-
erwise be easily alerted by the presence of an alert color. When only
discrete read locations are used, a status light indicating that the read
location is in operation enables the operators to effortlessly determine
that they either should or should not be receiving proper reads from the
system. The status light on the reader equipment is not sufficient feed-
back because the readers could be located in protected areas that may
obscure or block their tiny status lights. Also, multiple readers may be
used to cover a particular read zone. Having the operator check each
reader is not effortless and is error-prone. Simple status lights can let
the operator know quickly whether all the readers in the area are work-
ing properly.
You have many options for attaching light or sound enunciators to readers.
Most readers have several dedicated I/O ports designed specifically for
adding motion sensors, lights, horns, and so on.
If you decide to use lights, include a single status light for each read zone.
Make it easy to see with peripheral vision and easy to interpret. The mental
image you should have for this status light is the large “X-Ray in Use” light
and sign commonly seen in hospitals. When the light is on, it is hard to miss,
and the sign tells you exactly what the light indicates. Make your status lights
this obvious. Table 14-1 lists some common status light systems that help
operators do basic monitoring and thus use the system effectively.

with antennas on both sides of the rack. In these configurations, any light
notification you set up should be clearly associated with its corresponding
dock door. Some racks have lights on the top of the rack, so a dock worker at
either dock door might see it flash and mistakenly think the reader is working
on his or her side.

Measuring and Interpreting 
System Behavior
Although determining whether a reader is visible and working is an important
factor in monitoring the health of an RFID system, it is not a sufficient mea-
sure of robustness and relative long-term stability. In order to gain a better
understanding of how a station or a collection of stations is performing, you
need insight into a station’s behavior.
Behavior analysis relies principally on a statistical analysis of a reader’s past
performance and an estimate of the reader’s short-term future behavior.
When you understand how a reader performs, you can begin to detect
unusual changes in this behavior, predict the failure of a reader, and deter-
mine the factors that might contribute to a loss in reader performance.
Although a wide variety of behavior measurements are available, this section
focuses on a small handful that are sufficient to build a reasonably efficient
monitoring system. They tell you when your readers are on line, when they
are working properly, when they are affected by some environmental stress,
when they are exhibiting abnormal behaviors, and when some emerging con-
dition exists that will cause a problem in the near future. In addition to helping
you find faulty equipment, these measures can help you evaluate vendors, rec-
ognize systemic equipment and network design or placement problems, and
alert you to emerging problems as your RFID system “settles in.”
Building a statistical monitoring approach
When monitoring an RFID system’s behavior, you need information from the
readers, which you can get through both nonintrusive monitoring and intru-
sive monitoring:
 Nonintrusive monitoring: Nonintrusive techniques analyze the informa-
tion that is normally available from a reader and place no additional
demands on the RFID system.
 Intrusive monitoring: You ask the reader to periodically provide infor-
mation that is not available by simply interrogating the tags. You do this
by issuing commands to the reader to tell something about its internal
operations.
In nonintrusive monitoring, you might check the status of a reader’s tag
detection. This status condition can be successful (the contents were recog-
nized) or unsuccessful (the response to a reader’s attempt to interrogate a
tag was not recognized). Intrusive monitoring can often give deeper insight
into an RFID system by providing a way of not only predicting failures, but
255
Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

also helping to establish a root cause analysis that can bring a failed reader
back on line in the shortest possible time. As an example, the ratio of suc-
cessful to unsuccessful responses over time is an indicator of how well the
reader is positioned or, following a decay curve, that the reader is suffering
an imminent hardware failure.
Deciding whether to use intrusive or nonintrusive techniques usually
depends on three factors:
 Availability of programming resources: Nonintrusive measurements
are often easy to come by. The Savant, or middleware systems, attached
to most readers usually provide counts of unique tag values and other
statistics, which can be retrieved using simple programming techniques
or, in some cases, are available as files without any additional program-
ming. In order to measure many of the metrics in an RFID reader, you
may need the services of a computer programmer skilled in embedded
systems and network protocols. If these skills are not available in your
organization, you need a budget to hire programmers with these skills.
 Availability of a comprehensive command language for the reader:
An RFID reader is a small computer in its own right. The actions of the
reader are controlled through its internal programs, which are written 
in its own programming language. The reader’s program language often
includes a series of commands that you can use to retrieve information
about how the reader is working. This is a “command language.” Many
reader command languages are very close to the basic machine instruc-
tions and involve cryptic syntax with brittle parameter lists. 
Accessing information about how the reader is working and what is hap-
pening at the bit level is only available through intrusive monitoring
techniques. This also means that using a reader’s command language
often requires highly specialized computer programming knowledge.
Command language programmers also run the risk of accidentally dis-
abling the reader, corrupting or destroying configuration data, or caus-
ing the reader to act in an unpredictable manner or to return the wrong
data.
Some more advanced readers that are connected through TCP/IP or
Ethernet networks strike a happy medium between the two extremes by
using a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server (such as Jetty) as a
way of communicating with the reader. An HTTP server (though still
requiring professional programming expertise) interrogates and com-
municates with the reader through a simple set of easy-to-use-and-
understand commands. In general, an HTTP interface simply taps into
data that is already available form the reader’s operation. In this sense,
HTTP monitoring tends to be a form of nonintrusive monitoring.
256
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

 The load on the reader during the busiest time of day: An intrusive
monitoring approach places a demand on the available computing
capacity of the reader. If this demand is too heavy, it can affect the abil-
ity of the reader to work properly under a heavy load. From experience,
this doesn’t happen often, and sometimes the valuable operating and
performance information derived from intrusive monitoring outweighs
the small probability that a rare spike in tag traffic will cause a problem.
On the other hand, if you have periods of very intense tag traffic, you
should consider approaches to nonintrusive monitoring.
In general, the statistical analysis, trend analysis, and visual representations
of nonintrusive values provide a wealth of monitoring information for a basic
RFID system. In many cases, you can also learn quite a lot from the simple
aggregation (summation) of tag counts and tag count failures by location, by
time of day, or by reader manufacturer type. From these statistics, the opera-
tions manager and the system user can gain a significant insight into how the
readers are working and where problems occur or where they are likely to
occur in the future.
Starting with data that’s easy to extract and use is the best approach to build-
ing your monitoring system. As you gain experience and discover any weak-
nesses in your monitoring approach, you can plan for a more in-depth analysis.
As you consider additional monitoring, remember that monitoring should be
goal-oriented. Collecting statistics and plotting reader transmissions without a
method of understanding what is happening in your enterprise is likely to
result in a static view of your equipment. A monitoring system must tell you
what is happening and, to some degree, what is likely to happen.
As a first step in developing your monitoring strategy, investigate the com-
mand language supplied with your reader and decide whether the added
investment in programming and the possible added load on the reader is
worth the investment in accessing additional operating information. You
should also consider whether a commercially available (off the shelf) RFID
monitoring system would best suit your business needs. These systems are
designed for minimum impact on your readers and can often provide a wide
spectrum of performance statistics.
Breaking data into time intervals
Before examining performance measurements (which are the metrics you 
use to evaluate how well a station — or a set of stations — works), you must
understand a simple but often overlooked property of these measurements:
Measurements have different values and hence different meanings at different
times. Generally, a given measurement might have one value in the morning
and another at night, or one value on Monday and another on Wednesday, or
one value during the beginning of the month and another toward the end of
the month. The variation of measurement values over time is a result of the
257
Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

recurring or cyclical nature of a behavior. Somewhat akin to the seasonal
changes in temperature, unemployment, or produce pricing models, the regu-
lar periodic behavior of an RFID station means that you need to consider
when as well as what when measuring performance.
In addition to the operational performance measurements discussed in this
chapter, you should also provide your monitoring system with some solid
statistical analysis capabilities. Understanding the nature of the data pro-
vided by a reader is critical for interpreting and effectively using the results
of each performance measurement. When you have captured a collection of
tag instances with their date and time values, you can begin to answer some
fundamental questions about the organization and distribution of the data.
To begin a statistical analysis, you need to group the data into small “buck-
ets” or intervals based on the time values. In this way, you have a count of
tag reads every two minutes (as an example). Eventually you will create a
table of two-minute counts over a few hours or days. As an example, Figure
14-1 illustrates how a collection on frequency counts for a reader at a particu-
lar site can be tabulated.
This is where statistics come into play. Some of the fundamental or descrip-
tive statistical measures you want to develop include the minimum and maxi-
mum frequency counts, the average value, the standard deviation of the 
data distribution (which is a measure of how compactly the data is gathered
around the mean), and the skew of the data (which indicates whether the
data has a bias, right or left, away from the mean). And, although you need 
to compute these measures for all the data in order to give yourself some
sense of the overall data properties, you want to use the time stamps to
break down statistics into more meaningful time frames, such as morning and
afternoon, for each day of the week. This emphasis on time, of course, is in
keeping with the fundamental time property of all your measurements.

Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

Please bear in mind that not every manufacturer’s RFID reader provides all
the information necessary to compute every measure. In some cases, you
need to use intrusive programming techniques to retrieve a required metric
(such as a failed read count). Also, in some cases, you may need to add the
time of day measure to a metric that is returned without a valid time stamp.
Measure 1: The average tag 
traffic volume (ATTV)
This measurement enables you to understand the typical flow of tags through
the station and anticipate the average volume of tags that pass through a sta-
tion in a given interval of time. To capture this flow, your monitoring system
captures the number of tags per time period (as an example, tags per minute
or tags per every five minutes). To compute this measurement, you need to
gather the following data from your readers:
 The time those tags were counted, which you then use to divide tag
counts into a time interval that you specify for the statistical analysis of
ATTV
 The tag count coming from the reader, which you may need to limit,
depending on how your readers work (I explain this in more detail a
little later in this section)
You want your monitoring system to collect enough data so that you get a
feel for the station’s tag volume behavior through the week. With this day-
by-day, 24-hour volume data in hand, you can use a spreadsheet program
such as Microsoft Excel to compute trends, discover periodic behaviors, 
and graph the flow of tags through the station. I discuss how you can use
ATTV as a foundation for more complex monitoring later in this section.
Because the number of tags read in each time interval can be very large, the
time interval determines the level of granularity you want to use in evaluating
this measurement.
If the time interval is too large, the final measurement doesn’t tell you very
much because too many reads over a large period of time obscure the pat-
terns of tag flow. On the other hand, if the time interval is too small, the fine
details similarly don’t allow you to see the patterns of tag flow.
Finding a good value for the time interval is generally not difficult, but does
require a bit of trial-and-error testing. Generally, you know you’ve found the
proper time interval when the patterns of reader activity begin to “make
sense.” A good starting point is five to ten times the sampling rate. Thus, if
you’re sampling every two minutes, a time interval of ten minutes would be a
good starting point.
259
Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

Tallying the tag count with your readers in mind
Although the tag count appears simple, your monitoring system needs to
account for the workings of the RFID reader itself. For example, as a package
moves on a conveyor, the transponder tag is activated and transmits its EPC
(electronic product code) value. But it doesn’t necessarily do this only once;
it might conceivably do this over and over again as it moves along the con-
veyor. Your monitoring system needs to be configured so that your monitor-
ing isn’t thrown off if the conveyor stops.
 For more sophisticated readers that send state changes along with a
tag’s information, you can calculate ATTV using a standard equation
that doesn’t need to be revised to accommodate your reader’s behavior.
After a tag is read, no more EPC values are sent even if the tag sits in
front of a reader for a long time. When the tag starts moving again and
leaves the reader’s detection zone, the reader sends a message telling
the listener (the middleware, as an example) that a state change has
occurred — the tag has moved out of range.
 For readers that continuously transmit tag values (or for readers that
are continuously interrogated by the Savant software, which results in
pretty much the same situation), the way tags move through the interro-
gation zone influences the average traffic volume measurement. Although
spikes, plateaus, and deep valleys in the tag count might conceivably
reveal much about the way material flows through your warehouse or
retail store, ignoring these irregularities in traffic has a significant impact
on the use of the traffic volume as a reliable metric, and you need to
account for it.
One easy way around this situation is to simply treat each time interval
as a bucket. When filled, all other tag counts are thrown away. When you
tally tag reads this way, you need to set a maximum number of counts
for the specified time period. As long as the total tag count is less than
or equal to the maximum number, your data reflects the actual number
of tags that move through the interrogation zone. When the tag count
hits the maximum number, the monitoring system stops counting.
Because the purpose is to develop a way of monitoring the activity of a
reader, the measurement need not be absolutely precise and analytical, as
long as it is consistent and reliable. So setting a maximum number of counts
doesn’t diminish the value of your monitoring system. One way to initially
begin using the bucket approach is to set the maximum count to about 80
percent of the estimated maximum possible during a single sampling period. 
Using ATTV to monitor whether a reader is active
The average volume measurement can also be interpreted as a measure of
whether a reader was actively reading tags during any time period. In this
case, you only need to know that at least one tag was interrogated. If you use
the bucket method and set the maximum number to one tag, the equation in
your monitoring system produces a series of 1s and 0s over the time period.
260
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

The 1s and 0s produce a Boolean array indicating whether or not a reader
was active during the time period. 
Note that this approach differs in purpose form the use of SNMP to determine
whether or not a reader is active. The SNMP will tell you whether or not the
reader is visible on the network and is working as far as the network of read-
ers is concerned. The average volume per time unit measures the functional
or operational activity of a reader – that is, whether or not a reader is capa-
ble of reading tags (a reader with a damaged or disconnected antenna will
still appear active to SNMP interrogation).
Measure 2: Read errors 
to total reads (RETR)
An error is a failure to interpret a returned signal from a transponder tag. By
measuring the errors against the total reads, you can see how well an RFID
station scans and recognizes tags and thus detect problems, such as
 A faulty tag, antenna, or network connection
 Improper placement of antennas
 Improper tag types for the kind of container material
 Signal interference in the range of RFID frequencies
 A low signal strength
 A frequency hop time that is longer than the tag time through the
antenna’s detection field
Read errors are associated with the number of times that an antenna must
probe the incoming container to properly detect the tag. To compute this
measurement, you need to collect the following data from your readers:
 The number of read errors
 The number of successful reads
 The time these reads occurred, so that you can evaluate the measure-
ment over different time periods
The error rate measure is the number of read errors over the time interval
(N) divided by the total number of reads (the number of successful reads
plus the number of read errors) in this time period. In effect, this is the per-
centage of errors in a given time period. A high percentage of errors is cause
for concern and investigation.
261
Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

Measure 3: Read error 
change rates (RECR)
In addition to the read error rate (which I discuss in the preceding section),
you need to know the change in this error rate. The rate or degree of change
in the error rate measures the stability of the RFID station.
If the read error rate fluctuates or increases steadily, some underlying prob-
lem must be interfering with the reader performance. These underlying prob-
lems often emerge over time and reveal a fault in either the design of the
station or in the hardware itself.
Two different types of methods can detect changes in the error rate — 
essentially, a simple method that detects a degree of change and a more com-
plex method that detects the rate of change:
 Degree of change: This simple method looks at the cumulative differ-
ence in the RETR values over time and answers the question, Are the
values, on average, steadily increasing or decreasing?
 Rate of change: Without delving into the statistics, this method may
bring back memories of plotting graphs in algebra class. This measure
involves plotting the values on x- and y-axes (in which x is the time inter-
val and y is the RETR value), finding a trend line through the values, and
then determining the slope of the trend line. With this measure, you
know whether the RETR values are increasing or decreasing and the rate
at which the change is moving up or down.
Measure 4: Actual versus predicted 
traffic rate (APTR)
Earlier in this chapter, I discuss the average tag traffic volume detected by a
reader across various time frames. (See “Measure 1: The average tag traffic
volume” for details.) As you collect this traffic information, various patterns
begin to emerge. For example:
 Warehouse bay door readers in your distribution centers have more or
less predictable tag volumes that change on different days of the week
or months of the year or even times of the day.
 RFID inventory tracking systems in retail stores often have even more
clearly defined periodic behaviors, corresponding to store hours, after-
work and weekend customer traffic patterns, and so forth.
262
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

From these historical observations, you can begin to detect anomalies in the
performance characteristics of your readers. Your system may use one of two
approaches to measure APTR:
 The simple method: One approach is simply to compute the ratio of the
average tags per interval against the actual tags per interval rate and
raise an alarm if the ratio is smaller or larger than expected.
 A more complex and slightly better method: I say better because this
method helps you both detect anomalies as well as predict problems. In
this method, your system forecasts the expected tag traffic over a short-
term period and then compares the actual to the forecast. For this
method, you need the following data:
• The time tags are read, which you then use to compare actual
reads in a time interval to reads forecasted for that time interval.
The time period is the time of day usually expressed in minutes
since midnight. This creates a continuous, increasing value that
can be used in the prediction process.
• The actual ATTV value for the reader during the forecasted time
period.
When you examine the data for this measure, an actual value that’s close to
the estimated value indicates that the system is running fine. If the actual
traffic is much larger or smaller than the expected traffic, you need to
investigate. First, determine whether your actual volume has changed —
that is, whether the change reflects what’s actually happening in your busi-
ness. Then, investigate whether the change reflects a problem with your
system. Both of these measures might be important, but a smaller than
expected outcome often indicates some problem with the reader.
Measure 5: Mean time between 
failure (MTBF)
The measures I explain earlier in this chapter are operational in nature; they
form the basic metrics that you can use to detect problems in your RFID
system as it is running in your organization. The mean time between failure
measure, however, is a conventional engineering metric and is part of a
strategic or global measure that measures the robustness and stability of 
a system.
MTBF is a high-level or strategic measure because it’s a measure of system reli-
ability and is designed to assess the performance of a large system of “things.”
In your case, these “things” are the components of your RFID system — the
readers, the antennas, and the underlying network. When you apply this mea-
surement to an RFID system, you measure how well this system of components
performs over time given its site deployment, ambient or environmental
threats, and the continuous flow of tag traffic.
263
Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

When you measure MTBF, you need to determine what a failure is exactly.
How you define a failure in turn determines how sensitive your monitoring
system is. You can basically steer your monitoring system toward one of the
following extremes:
 A very hard approach defines failure as a reader that is not operational.
 A softer approach defines failure as a decay in one or more performance
measurements below a certain threshold. Raising or lowering the thresh-
old provides a way of identifying problems based on varying ideas of
criticality or sustainability.
Generally speaking, the softer approach is a better way of looking at failure.
Because a reader “fails” when its performance crosses a threshold, it pro-
vides a form of early warning. This early warning is often sufficient to bring a
defective reader or network component back on line.
MTBF measures the expected failure rate over time based on the failures
rates of the individual components. To calculate MTBF, you need to deter-
mine or gather the following data:
 The lifetime: This is the total functioning life of the population and is mea-
sured as the activities in a time period times the length of the time period.
The population is the total number of readers that you are monitoring or
evaluating. Activities are the number of reads associated with the readers
over a specified time period. The lifetime is usually measured in hours.
 The number of components in your RFID system: Usually, when mea-
suring MTBF, a component is a reader. However, a component might also
be an antenna or a network server. Taken together (readers plus anten-
nas plus servers), these comprise the components in the system. Each
of these might have a failure rate.
 The quantity of each component: If the system consists of readers and
antennas, this is the number of readers and then the number of antennas.
With this information, the failure rate is associated with that component. The
MTBF rate is a measure of how many failures that component has had over
the measured life of the system.
What makes MTBF so interesting and so potentially important to a monitoring
system is its ability to fuse together the failure rates of a system with many
different components. Because an RFID system has many components — 
readers, antenna arrays, networks, and middleware or Savant servers — the
MTBF statistics provide a powerful way of predicting failure rates based on
the “weakest link.”
Here’s a simple example to help explain how to determine the variables for
and to calculate MTBF. Consider a calculation of MTBF solely for RFID readers.
The readers are the only components in the system. Suppose you have a
system with a total of 1,000 RFID readers operating over a 100-hour period,
and during this time, 10 readers fail. The lifetime is the 1,000 readers times 100
264
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 

hours — or 100,000. You have only a single component (the collection of read-
ers), and its failure rate during this time period was 10 units. If you plug these
values into a basic statistical equation for MTBF, this works out as follows:
mtbf

The units of measure in this case are hours divided by elements (or units) so
that the MTBF for a population of RFID readers is 10,000 hours per unit. If you
divide those hours by 24, you get an idea of how many days you can expect
your RFID system to run between failures — in this case, 416 days. Of course,
MTBF is a statistical measure that applies to a large population and is only a
rough measure of reliability. Like all statistical analyses, its applicability to a
particular RFID system depends on the accuracy and quantity of the underly-
ing data for each component in the system.
Monitoring as you expand 
your RFID network
The physics of an RFID system and the techniques used to develop a prelimi-
nary site assessment (see Chapter 7) provide a proven and controlled method
of placing reader stations and antennas. In practice, however, expect that subtle
changes in the operating environment, trade-offs between physics and practical-
ity, and the ambient signal capabilities in a working environment will have an
appreciable and noticeable effect on the actual capabilities of your system.
The monitoring system plays an important role when an RFID station is reconfig-
ured and redesigned because it provides rapid feedback on a reader’s new suc-
cess or failure rate in reading tags. Fine tuning your RFID system with a working
monitoring system enables you to quickly isolate problem areas, take advantage
of favorable antenna locations, and measure each increase in performance.
Setting up a monitoring system
After you understand what metrics you need to measure, you’re ready to set
up a monitoring system. You want to make sure that this monitoring system
is built based on the statistical equations in Table 14-2. Although explaining
the details of how to calculate statistical equations is beyond the scope of
this book, I do explain the basics of statistical notation in the sidebar, “Some
statistics basics,” and the preceding sections explain what these equations
calculate in basic terms.
I include these equations so that you can clarify how you want your program-
mers to build a monitoring system or how you want your monitoring vendor
to measure your system. But more on that in a moment. . . .

Some statistics basics
A full treatment of statistical methods is beyond
the scope of this book. If you are interested in
brushing up on your statistics, the Rice Virtual
Lab offers some basic introductory information
(www.ruf.rice.edu/~lane/rvls.html). 
In you addition, you may want to understand one
of the most frequently used symbols in statistics,
the sigma or summation symbol, because you
encounter this symbol in most of the statistical-
based measurements in this chapter.

The summation notation in this example is read,
“From 1 to N, sum the value of x”. In this example,
N indicates the number of elements in the distri-
bution, i is a counter or specifier for each value in
the distribution, and xi is one of the values in the
distribution. If we have a distribution {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
this expression selects each value and adds it to
the ongoing sum. The result is 15.

Chapter 14: Ping-Pong, the Tags Are Gone: How to Monitor Your RFID Network

Depending on your needs, the availability of programming resources, your
budget, and the capabilities of current off-the-shelf monitoring software, you
can use any of the following resources to build and monitor your system:
 Programmers, either in-house or consultants, who build a custom
monitoring system.
 Monitoring vendors, who are outsourcing partners and who supply
results to you: In this case, you need to tell your outsourcing partner
what you want to measure, and you can use the equations in Table 14-2
to define the nature of the monitoring system. See Chapter 17 for more
details on outsourcing.
 Third-party software: RFID is a new, emerging technology. As I write this
book, only a few monitoring systems are available, and these are often
associated with a single vendor. As the market expands, you should
expect to find monitoring systems, often developed by middleware ven-
dors, of various capabilities, sophistication, depth, and cost.
268
Part IV: Raising the Beams for Your Network 
A self-healing system
Because human intervention can create errors
and inconsistency, the ideal preservation for an
RFID system is a monitoring system that can self-
heal after it has detected anomalous behavior.
I’ve also stressed this in the design of ODIN tech-
nologies monitoring system because there aren’t
a lot of technology people to fix things where
warehouses tend to be — like Nome, Alaska or
Waterloo, Iowa. The reader configuration classes
are the basis for that type of self-healing system.
(As I explain in Chapter 13, configuration classes
are standard reader configurations that you can
roll out to a reader over your RFID network.)
Intelligent software is emerging that will allow
adjacent readers to configure each other based
on performance and RF analysis. ODIN tech-
nologies applied for one of the first patents in
2003 for such an automated design system. As
readers become more intelligent, the need for
specialized testing equipment, like signal gen-
erators and spectrum analyzers, will decrease.
As more sophisticated systems start to address
on-going reader maintenance issues, first the
machine will try to remediate any anomalous
behavior, and then a notification will be sent out
a system administrator.

business. It’s written for the long-repressed bean
counter in you. In this part, I help you figure out how to put
together a working RFID committee, develop a strategy, and
make a business case. I assume that you will need to go
through an investigation phase, submit something during
strategic planning cycles, and finally build a return-on-
investment (ROI) analysis. This part takes you through all
these steps and helps you decide whether to outsource.
This part may seem like it is just for senior managers and
business analysts, but everyone can benefit from under-
standing how to get buy-in, how to plan the pilot program,
and eventually how to deploy the RFID system.

ool new technology? Not cheap? Big strategic advantage? . . . Okay, I’ll 
do it! Unfortunately, in most organizations, it’s just not that easy. You
have to contend with the bean-counting police before you can actually start
having fun. That’s why, in this chapter, I explain how to put together an analy-
sis of this technology that any card-carrying CPA-, MBA-, CFO-type would be
proud of. 
A business case provides the overall business justification for the initial and
on-going commitment of time, resources, and funding for an RFID implementa-
tion. One of the major lessons I’ve learned from large implementation efforts
over the past 15 years is that the lack of a business case invariably leads to a
lack of success. RFID is here, and failure is clearly not an option!
A critical success factor to your business case is your ability to execute with
a rigorous and disciplined process. This chapter reveals a best-practice, nine-
step process that will set you up for a successful RFID business case and clar-
ify how to present it. For each of the nine steps, I define a purpose and tasks,
followed by some experience-based how-to-get-it-done discussion.
Finding the First-Round Draft 
Picks for Your RFID Team
Prior to the project kickoff, you need to establish a core team of players who
are already interested and motivated by what RFID can offer your business.

Look for people who are not only excited by the project, but who are also
capable of conceptualizing how RFID can transform your business and who
have the credibility within your organization to effectively evangelize the
message.
Successful team members need to be able to push themselves and others to
look far beyond the standard supply-chain-efficiency type of RFID benefits. A
successful team also needs a structure:
 Steering committee: This is a small group of three to five executives
who are the final budgetary decision-makers. The steering committee’s
role is to provide guidance and oversight to the project.
 Project lead: The project lead is a core team member who leads the
business case project. In addition to having the right leadership and
experience level, choose the project leader from the part of the business
that has the most to gain from RFID deployment. Usually the project lead
is someone in operations who will benefit from the RFID system or some-
one from IT who owns the system.
 Core team members: Like a great football team, you need players who
are proficient in different disciplines — from kickers to linemen. For some
companies, this step is akin to a puzzle wrapped up in an enigma, encir-
cled by a cruel riddle. But it doesn’t have to be that difficult — just use
some common sense. Choose your key draft picks from finance, security,
sales/brand management, information systems, and operations/logistics.
You might have leaders who are already skilled in the topic or have some
experience with the technology. You also need a technological guru who
will be the primary leader for all things technological. This person’s forte
is the bits, bytes, chips, tags, hardware, and software — not the business
processes. This person must understand the business, but doesn’t need
to be an expert. Understanding the business process is critical, however,
so make sure that you have one or two members who really understand
how things work on the manufacturing floor or in the warehouse.
Some companies are pressing for new structure here, such as a VP for
RFID. Do you really need that? The likely answer is no, not unless RFID is
going to be one of your core competencies. What you need is leadership,
not a new office with new costs, without the organizational power and
respect to make things happen.
 Extended team members: These individuals are normally brought in 
as required for specific steps or tasks over the course of the project.
Typically, extended team members are key to the build-out of quantifi-
able benefits and costs. An example of an extended team member is
someone from your customer service department who can provide the
kind of detailed data collection and analysis that’s necessary to estab-
lish credible benefits in the area of returns management.
Figure 15-1 shows a typical team structure, with the core team shaded in dark
gray.
272
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Many companies employ a consultant to lead them through the business
case effort, typically because no one in the company has the proper RFID and
business case process expertise and can be dedicated full-time to the RFID
business case effort. If, like most companies, you bring in a consultant, select
wisely. Make sure the consultant has experience doing RFID business cases 
in your industry. Be sure to review examples of his or her work as part of 
the selection process. If you look to some of the early adopters in the tech-
nology — the Wal-Mart top 100, for instance — many of the RFID leaders for
those companies have spoken with the press. Call or e-mail those folks and
ask whom they have worked with. Talk to some of the technology analysts
like Yankee Group, Forrester, IDC, ABI, or Gartner. Also look at consultants
who have been involved for a while with associations like AIM Global,
CompTIA, or the CEA.
Make your RFID implementation a company effort, not a departmental affair.
Cohesion is the key to a solid company-wide RFID program. If you fragment
your RFID effort, your implementation will fail. From every point of view, an
RFID implementation revolutionizes and touches almost every area within
the company. Because RFID has received so much press coverage, everyone
wants to know about it. If your company has an often-visited intranet or
portal, setting up a section specifically on RFID is a great way to keep every-
one from sales to operations up to date on the progress. If you have a project
timeline and milestones set up on the intranet, it’s also a great way to pub-
licly and collectively audit progress of the project.

Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

A Game Plan Is More Than Xs and Os —
Use a Proven Methodology
By using the methodology I describe in the following sections, you can
launch your company’s RFID initiative effectively. This methodology estab-
lishes a complete RFID business case story — what you want to do, why,
what it means to your business, what actions you need to take, what the
investment is, and when the investment is required.
To give you an idea of how you might work through this methodology, Figure
15-2 shows the nine steps over a ten-week project life cycle. Note that this is
an aggressive approach that assumes 
 A core team is already in place, and its members can each dedicate six
to nine hours per week to the business case.
 That a project lead or consultant is working on the business case 
full-time.
Part of the methodology I explain in this chapter is based on building out 
an Excel-based ROI (return on investment) model. For benefit and cost esti-
mates, coming up with low and high estimates is important. The variables 
for the low and high estimates should be based on the specific nature of the
method used to determine the benefit or cost, be it time, assumptions on
range of costs, or something else. While the various calculations and graphs

produced by the ROI model are vital to the business case, the strategic bene-
fits side of any RFID business case will prove to be the basis of any key decision-
making. In this chapter, you find out at what points your team needs to identify
strategic benefits and build elements of the ROI. In Chapter 16, you can 
find more details about strategic benefits and actually calculating the ROI
analysis.
To get the best results, the individuals on the RFID team must function like a
single unit. Efficient communication is the linchpin of an effective team,
which is why I recommend two types of meetings:
 A weekly two-hour core team session focused on project status, issues,
and collective review of work products (also called validation). Have this
type of meeting as you move through each step of compiling your busi-
ness case for RFID.
 An as-needed working session with core and extended team members
focused on specific tasks.
When planning these meetings, take into consideration that some steps I
cover in this chapter are more challenging and time-intensive than others
(refer to Figure 15-2). These steps typically require several iterations during
the weekly core team meetings in order to revise and finalize the work prod-
ucts and findings (in other words, the steps in the nine-step process are not
linear). Also, some require the full effort of the team, whereas others require
one or two people acting on their own. When the project is aggressively pur-
sued, it should take ten weeks.
Step 1. Refine the process 
and conduct team training
This step creates a solid foundation that enables everyone on your team to
work successfully through the rest of the steps. To create this foundation,
your team needs to accomplish the following tasks:
 Train the core and extended project team members. Training is pro-
vided by the consultant and consists of RFID training and business case
process training.
• RFID training consists of an overview of RFID tags, hardware, soft-
ware, and case studies for the core and extended project team
members. (See Chapter 5 for an overview on RFID readers and
tags; Chapter 6 includes case studies of common RFID applica-
tions). For technical team members, training also needs to include
an overview of RFID technology (see Part III).
275
Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

• Business case process training serves to educate team members
about the overall business case process and then delves into busi-
ness process concepts, issues/risk measurement, and best-practice
project management.
To help you get up to speed on the technology, research RFID online
(Chapter 19 lists sites that can get you started) and attend an educational
seminar. Preferably find a seminar that is vendor-neutral or a conference
with educational tracts and case studies. These seminars are real eye-
openers and generally cover a smattering of all RFID-related topics.
 Identify participants and roles for each step in the process. Determine
who is needed, how much of their time will be necessary, and when.
 Refine the process for the RFID business case and establish an agreed-
upon framework for an ROI model. For details on setting up and work-
ing through an ROI model, see Chapter 16.
 Review and finalize the objectives and deliverables. Examples of objec-
tives include establishing a recommended plan for RFID deployment and
assessing the business risks of RFID deployment. Examples of deliverables
include an executive level presentation and an implementation roadmap.
 Establish consensus on the business case methodology and assump-
tions (I’m going to assume you use the 9-step method in this chapter).
Before any meetings that involve people new to the project, send those folks
an overview e-mail that introduces RFID basics, the purpose and scope of the
project, and so on. An e-mail like this brings new extended team members up
to speed quickly before they participate in any meetings or workshops.
Step 2. Determine scope and assumptions
Now your team is ready to set the big picture for the RFID implementation in
the business case. To do so, here are the tasks that lay before you:
 Complete a scope statement that defines the RFID vision (the big picture
of how RFID affects the business). The statement also identifies business
units and processes included in the business case (or in-scope) and
those not included (or out of scope).
 Establish operational assumptions for the business case.
Completing the scope statement
You need to establish your scope statement right up front. (Later on, you’ll
likely need to fine-tune the scope.) The key elements of an effective scope
statement are as follows:
 Geography: Outline where the business case is focused (for example,
North America, Asia). Is it intended to be a scalable business case to
276
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

other geographies (that is, do you want to reuse the business case if you
acquire another company in Europe, for example)?
 Organizational coverage: Identify what parts of the business the RFID
will affect (for example, sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution,
information systems, finance, security).
 Not included in organizational coverage: List the parts of the business
that an RFID system won’t affect (for example, research and develop-
ment, sourcing).
 Products: List the specific products that you want to tag. Normally, 20
percent of a company’s products represent 80 percent of its sales. This
is the 20 percent that you want to have within scope.
Establishing the assumptions
Normally, a business case has about a half-dozen assumptions. Assumptions
are necessary to ensure a common understanding of how the RFID system
will be implemented and what processes will be affected. Here are several
examples of key assumptions:
 All RFID tagging is done at the unit, case, and pallet level.
You need to establish early in your business case what level of item
you’ll be tagging. For most retail consumer packaged-goods manufactur-
ers, tagging occurs at the case and pallet level. For others, such as phar-
maceutical manufacturers, you need to tag at the unit, case, and pallet
level. At this point in the process, the level you determine is like a
hypothesis. You’ll prove or disprove your hypothesis during the align-
ment of drivers, strategies, and enablers in Step 3.
 The business case planning horizon is five years. Planning beyond five
years is not viable with this rapidly changing technology.
 The operational RFID flow begins at the point of tagging in manufac-
turing, goes to the manufacturing distribution centers, and then out to
the trading partners.
 Tags are applied at the point of manufacturing or packaging (not
slapped on in the distribution centers).
Step 3. Determine drivers, 
strategies, and enablers
In this step, you identify and align the key drivers, strategies, and enablers. In
the most basic terms, the driver tells you why, the strategy tells you how, and
the enablers tell you what. Specifically,
 Drivers are external forces driving your business.
 Strategies are key RFID-related policies you’ll use to address the drivers.
277
Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

 Enablers are things you need to have or employ to achieve your strategic
goals for RFID success.
All the business case benefits and costs (which you determine later, in Steps
7 and 8) emanate from aligned drivers, strategies, and enablers. Keep in mind
that the better job you do in this step, the better grounded your business
case will be.
Completing a strong set of aligned RFID drivers, strategies, and enablers is an
iterative process. Here are the steps you need to work through in order to get
this task done:
1. Gather information about drivers, strategies, and enablers by review-
ing strategic business plans and/or interviewing senior management.
For key management interviews, be sure to prepare an interview guide
with introductory material. In Part VI, you can find good introductory
information about equipment vendors, general information on RFID, and
RFID standards and protocols. In addition, an effective interview guide
includes questions that elicit driver and strategy input and questions
that help determine overall project expectations.
2. Identify drivers based on your information.
You can likely isolate four to six external forces that drive your RFID
implementation. Drivers vary by industry, but most involve compliance,
product safety or integrity, and, of course, your customer.
3. Identify three to eight strategies for each driver.
Some strategies are likely in place already. Your team can discover and
compile those strategies through interviews with core team members
and other stakeholders and then link the strategies to drivers.
Strategies start with action words or verbs. This will probably be the
first time all your RFID-related strategies are articulated.
One of the overarching strategies is how much of an industry leader
your company wants to be. This impacts the road map that you develop
in Step 8, as well as how costs are incurred over time (Step 6). For more
about formulating an RFID strategy from a business perspective, see
Chapter 16.
4. Identify the enablers that you need to have or employ for RFID 
success.
Similar strategies usually have similar enablers, and you’ll likely find a
core of about a dozen enablers in your analysis. The statement of your
enablers will include nouns such as collaboration, infrastructure, applica-
tions, and so on.
5. Agree on a set of RFID drivers, strategies, and enablers.
278
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Table 15-1 shows an example of strategies and enablers that are aligned with
a driver. Notice how the alignment moves from left to right. The enablers in
the table represent some of the core enablers, so you can likely find a few
you’ll want to include in your own business case. Note how each strategy
aligns to the driver, and in parentheses, how each enabler aligns with the
strategies.

Step 4. Identify and assess business
processes and interfaces
In this step, you develop a high-level model of your company’s business
processes, which will help you determine how RFID will impact those
processes and the associated IS applications.
279
Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

Although I explain how you complete this step in more detail in Chapter 3,
the following steps give you an overview of how to create this model:
1. Referring to your list of in-scope business processes (refer to the ear-
lier section, “Step 2. Determine scope and assumptions”), construct a
high-level, as-is description of those processes.
For example, distribution, sales, marketing.
2. Map the RFID touch points (this is at the business process level, where
RFID will have an impact) within the processes.
3. Identify the applications associated with the touch points.
Think high-level here. Make sure you don’t go beyond an initial tentative
list of applications.
This step in the business case process is key because it sets the stage for one
of the top cost buckets for your business case: the cost of application inte-
gration. When you examine the applications associated with the touch points
in detail in Step 7, you determine what that cost will be.
Step 5. Identify complementary or 
competing business initiatives
Here, you establish one of your business case and implementation “radar
screens” by identifying what can be leveraged for success and what needs to
be closely monitored as competition for the RFID initiative. To accomplish
this goal, your team needs to do the following:
1. Gather information regarding existing initiatives by conducting addi-
tional interviews.
2. Classify the initiatives as complementary or conflicting with the RFID
initiative.
3. Develop a table or matrix for complementary initiatives, and another
for competing initiatives.
Within the complementary initiative matrix, identify actions to leverage
and assign core and project team members to either take action or moni-
tor. Within the competing initiative matrix, identify actions to mitigate and
assign core and project team members to either take action or monitor.
280
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Step 6. Identify strategic 
and economic benefits
This step is among the more time-consuming in the process (refer to Figure
15-2). The idea is to summarize the strategic impact and to estimate the
potential quantifiable benefits of RFID enablement.
In this step, your team needs to complete the following tasks:
 Determine the strategic (nonquantifiable) benefits of RFID employment.
 Quantify the expected process improvements associated with RFID
employment.
 Quantify the economic benefits for the expected process improve-
ments.
You can separate these tasks into two main categories: strategic benefits and
quantifiable benefits. In the following sections, I first define what the two
types of benefits are, and then I discuss a couple of typical examples and pro-
vide practical advice on how to capture each benefit effectively in the busi-
ness case model.
Determining the strategic benefits
Strategic benefits are the key, nonquantifiable benefits that you test with the
core team in order to get agreement on. You can’t quantify these, so you need
to articulate why they are important to your business.
Make sure you tie strategic benefits to your driver analysis, which you com-
pleted already. (See the earlier section, “Step 3. Determine drivers, strategies,
and enablers” for details.)
Here are three examples of strategic benefits that you might want to include
in your business case:
 Transforming business models and methods: Challenge the team to
envision how RFID can take the business to new levels. Ask how making
the whole supply chain transparent would enable the company to lever-
age accurate real-time customer data and thus generate revenue, miti-
gate risk, and reduce costs. Ask how real-time product sales visibility
would enable your sales force to have innovative targeting capabilities,
resulting in increased revenue generation and cost reduction.
 Reducing counterfeiting: Because most companies don’t want to dis-
cuss how counterfeiters have victimized them and at what cost to the
281
Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

brand, reducing counterfeiting is normally a strategic (nonquantifiable)
benefit. If you decide to quantify this benefit (using examples of the total
cost of counterfeiting incidents) but still present this among the strategic
benefits in your business case, there is a logic to follow in communicating
the anticounterfeiting benefit:
• The unique RFID tag prevents counterfeiting by providing a way to
authenticate the product as genuine.
• The RFID tag raises the bar for the counterfeiter, making activities
such as repackaging and relabeling more difficult to accomplish
and easier to detect.
• The unique RFID tag enables you to identify reimported product in
real time and to intervene.
 Diversion: Diversion (or rechanneling) is nearly impossible to quantify
until you have RFID in place. In your business case, you can state that
RFID enables you to identify and act on diverted product and prevents
expired returns and other unauthorized product from reentering the
supply chain.
The strategic benefits of RFID provide the basis of the business case. Strategic
benefits can account for up to two thirds of your overall RFID benefits.
Quantifying process and economic benefits
Quantifiable benefits are the key benefits that you can test and support with
calculations. To obtain these calculations, work with both the extended and
core teams.
One benefit you may want to quantify is supply-chain efficiencies — although if
you’re in a regulated industry, such as the pharmaceutical industry, you won’t
find much here. Here’s an overview of how to calculate this benefit, which you
can use as an example of how to quantify RFID’s timesaving benefits:
1. Find points in the supply chain at which you believe RFID will make a
positive difference.
You might look at inventory accuracy in your distribution centers, the
loading and unloading of trucks, and the counting associated with the
picking and packing process.
2. Find out how much time is currently spent on these activities.
3. For each activity determine a reasonable estimate on timesavings.
Use basic math to multiply the annual number of truckloads and orders
by the timesavings, and then by a fully loaded rate for the labor.
282
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

The benefit to supply-chain efficiencies will likely be modest. Don’t spend too
much energy on supply-chain efficiency if there already have been plenty of
initiatives in this area. Also, people can be very reluctant to agree to quantify
benefits that they have had difficulty coming through on in the past.
Another benefit you can quantify is reduced costs on expired returns. For
example, RFID can help if your company is reimbursing customers for returns
at a greater cost than the original purchase price. In a complicated supply
chain with a variety of discounts and contracts in place, RFID tagging at the
unit level can sort out when an item was bought and at what effective price.
The algorithm that figures these cost variations could be somewhat compli-
cated because of contracts and discounts.
If you challenge yourself, you can establish the logic for a benefit like reduced
costs of returns, and then with the help of an extended team member, sup-
port that benefit with numbers. Most quantifiable benefits take a good deal of
effort to calculate.
As you calculate ROI for quantifiable benefits, keep in mind that prices for
RFID tags will eventually drop. Depending on the cost of your items, it’s not
likely you’ll have a positive ROI if you are tagging at the unit level until tag
prices drop into the $.08–$.10 range. You can do some “what-if” analysis in
your ROI model by dropping the price of tags to find the tag price that gives
you a positive return on your investment.
For more on determining quantifiable benefits, see Chapter 16.
Conveying these benefits in the business case
After you collect the necessary information about strategic and economic ben-
efits, you need to convey that information in your business case. Table 15-2
shows how you might present the five benefit areas explained earlier in this
section. A level of impact and time to benefit is associated with each benefit:
 Level of impact: In Table 15-2, the level of impact takes three factors
into account: whether a benefit generates revenue, mitigates risk, or
reduces cost. Benefits that meet one factor are low-impact; benefits that
meet two or more factors are high-impact.
 Time frame: This indicates the time frame in which your business will
see benefit. Short term is three to five years; long term is five or more
years.
You may also add brief comments to describe how the benefit works, also
shown in Table 15-2. Benefits 1 and 2 are quantifiable and will feed directly
into the ROI model, as you see later in this chapter in “Step 9. Communicate
the business case.” For more details on calculating ROI, see Chapter 16.

Step 7. Develop investment requirements
Of course, your business case isn’t complete without information about what
your company needs to invest in order to get RFID up and running. Your team
needs to estimate the costs of hardware, software, implementation, integra-
tion, training, and support. In the ROI example in Chapter 16, I explain the
cost categories you need to address, and I discuss their key characteristics,
which will help you estimate accurately.
284
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Step 8. Develop an implementation 
road map
In this step, you determine the implementation plan in order to understand
the timing of the benefits and costs for the business case. The main tasks
involved in completing this step are
 Developing a pilot concept. Smaller, controlled projects that sequen-
tially test RFID technology, infrastructure, and collaboration with trading
partners.
 Develop a rollout concept. Following piloting, this is the path to produc-
tion for all products in scope.
 Apply benefits and costs according to the timing of the implementa-
tion road map.
Make sure you know when you need to be in compliance with any mandates.
If a customer or regulatory body requires you to be RFID-compliant in pro-
duction at the beginning of 2008, you need to plan around that event. Before
2008, you need to complete, at a minimum, a portfolio of pilot projects and a
limited rollout.
Deciding when to implement RFID
When deciding when to implement RFID, consider why you are toying with it
in the first place. There are three generally-normally-usually-almost-all-the-
time distinct reasons to implement RFID:
 Your company has been hit with a mandate to do so. For example, 
Wal-Mart insists that all cases be tagged. This creates a concrete dead-
line, and you need to look back 6–12 months from that deadline and 
plan accordingly so you that are live on the required date.
 You are convinced via an ROI study that your internal business process
will benefit in a tangible way from the adoption of RFID, so you want to
incorporate the technology as soon as possible to realize that ROI and
its strategic benefit. In this case, the timing can align with your normal
business planning cycle and fit in your strategic and budgetary process.
 You aren’t under a mandate but believe that you will sell more prod-
uct to a big retailer if you proactively tag your cases. This instance is
similar to the preceding example; however, you’ll probably start out by
just wetting your feet — to get tags on the minimal amount of products
and then evaluate to see whether the potential long-term impact is as
good as you might expect.
285
Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

Although you may believe that the ROI hurdle rate will be achieved in a year
or two (or simply feel like hunkering down under your desk and waiting for
this RFID phenomenon to pass), there are more reasons to act now than there
are to postpone the inevitable. A lot of those reasons center around creating
in-house expertise and understanding RFID’s impact on infrastructure and
business processes. You might need to change everything from packaging to
warehouse management systems. Beginning to understand the potential areas
for change today will help you plan over the next couple of years when ROI is
clearly positive or competitive factors in your industry dictate the use of RFID.
As you consider the timeframe for implementing RFID, you also need to
watch closely what your competition is doing. Are they deploying RFID or
simply playing with it? Have they gone to their customers with the promise of
being RFID-compliant? Does your industry do a lot of business with Wal-Mart,
the DoD, Target, or Albertsons?
Timing should be driven by ROI, competitive analysis, client requirements,
and potential economies of scale in infrastructure — like doing it when you
upgrade your enterprise resource planning (ERP) or warehouse management
system (WMS) applications.
Decide whether to implement the entire plan at once
You’ve heard the expression, “Think globally, act locally.” The same applies
to an RFID implementation, although in this case, it’s “Plan globally, imple-
ment locally.” Although I emphasize that RFID is a company-level project
throughout this book, the implementation is likely to take place in just one or
two warehouses or manufacturing facilities. I know you’re not a doctor (or
haven’t played one on TV), but think like a surgeon for a minute. You have a
patient who requires treatment in many different areas. As his surgeon, you
strategize a treatment plan that will eventually cover all his apparent ills —
but you can’t operate on them all at once. You might start by operating on
the knee, and then on a subsequent day, you might tackle the elbow. In simi-
lar fashion, your RFID implementation must be surgically precise.
Because logistics is usually the first part of the company to be confronted
with the RFID phenomenon, it is a logical place to pilot the technology. Some
companies start with read-only tags where the numbers are pre-programmed.
Although this strategy saves a step or two in a slap-and-ship process, it cre-
ates headaches later in data management. Read/write tags allow companies
to reach back way into the product life cycle and achieve the maximum bene-
fit from the technology. Starting with read/write tags a little at a time is usu-
ally your best bet when you go to an actual pilot deployment.
Step 9. Communicate the business case
The last step in the business case is quantifying the overall project and devel-
oping a framework for presenting it. You need to produce and include a
number of things in your business case:
286
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

 A written report of the RFID business case: Because you build your
story as you move through the first eight steps, your team doesn’t need
to revisit a lot of material at this point.
 A finalized ROI model to support the business case: The ROI model has
been developed along the last three steps of the process (see Chapter 16
for details on actually creating the ROI model). The business case is sup-
ported in detail by the information contained in the model.
For each quantifiable benefit and cost category, create a corresponding
worksheet within the model.
Figure 15-3 shows an example of a Summary worksheet, which shows the
flow of benefits and costs over time (incorporating the road map developed
in Step 8). It also shows pie charts depicting the breakout of benefits. Figure
15-3 is just one example of the various effective summary charts and graphs
that you can easily create at this point for your business case and presenta-
tion. Note that each benefit and cost worksheet feeds the Summary sheet.

Chapter 15: Making the Business Case

To prepare for your business case presentation, schedule at least two com-
prehensive sessions with the core team to refine the presentation material.
Specifically, you want to develop a project team presentation and an executive-
level presentation:
 Team-level presentation: Show a detailed view of the project work, and
include ROI model calculations. This presentation is normally used as
back-up information if you need to expand on any point during the 
executive-level presentations.
 Executive-level presentation: Prepare a one page executive summary.
Also include recommendations for the RFID implementation and a high-
level summary of project work.
For communicating the project, it’s always important to have a concise
PowerPoint presentation. Bringing this together is pretty simple if you do two
things:
 Create your presentation graphs and charts within the Excel-based
ROI model. Copy material from the model and paste it into your
PowerPoint presentation using the Paste Special and Enhanced Metafile
options.
 Build your PowerPoint presentation around the nine-step process.

Chapter 16
Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans
In This Chapter
 Making the case for RFID with strategic thinking
 Putting together an RFID ROI analysis
 Using ROI to expand your RFID network
 Viewing RFID as a competitive strategy
M
aybe you’re already convinced that RFID is the coolest technology on
the block, and because all the other kids are getting it, you just gotta
have it, too. (If you’re the kind of person who justifies another ham radio
antenna as an “investment” to your spouse in the event that UFOs land and
take out the phone grid, you know what I’m talking about.) Or maybe you’re
eyeing RFID suspiciously, as you nervously fiddle with your slide rule.
However you regard RFID, the best way to approach your deployment is with
good strategic thinking. CEOs, CFOs, and other C-type people are looking for
something that will have a positive impact on the organization before they
move forward. Coolness just won’t cut it. But you can’t pretend RFID will ride
away on some magic electromagnetic wave, either.
In Chapter 15, I mention that strategic benefits, as well as a thorough return-
on-investment (ROI) analysis, are the cornerstones of making a business case
for RFID. In this chapter, I focus on the overall strategic impact of the technol-
ogy. You find out the typical reactions that you might get from employees,
partners, and other important stakeholders and discover how to justify the
RFID deployment with proven strategic thinking. I walk you through a specific
ROI process for budgetary purposes and offer methods for assessing RFID’s
strategic benefits.

Just in Time to Justify: Overcoming
Skepticism with Strategic Thinking
“The bar code can do everything we need to do.”
Sound familiar? This sentiment sublimely expresses the feelings of many
practitioners who question the benefit of RFID and who believe that comply-
ing with their big retail partners has only a cost, not a value-added benefit 
for their own company. Other skeptics may not have enough information to
decide whether RFID is a worthwhile investment. The ROI analysis, which is
essential to implementing RFID successfully, may also engender a different
form of skepticism that you also need to overcome — pushing for implemen-
tation too fast by skipping the ROI study.
When it comes to justifying at the corporate level the insertion and applica-
tion of RFID technology, you’re likely to encounter (or experience) three
stages of skeptical behavior:
 Evasion: The company might not need to deploy this technology and
might be able to wait a few years. Another symptom of evasion is treat-
ing RFID like a scourge to pass to the newest executive in the firm
because the true benefit is unclear, and no one want to put his or her
name on a high-risk project.
 Denial: You might think that this technology won’t really be that widely
adopted, or that Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense (DoD) will back
off their mandates. In fact, you might decide that the best course of action
is to wait and do nothing. If you are the one with the task of deploying the
technology, you might be in denial about the need for a complex ROI
study. You might just say, “Hey, we don’t need a long, complicated ROI
study.
 Approximation: If you’re trying to figure out the impact on the organiza-
tion and you know that you are going forward with the technology, it
would certainly be easier to just guess at the size of the impact. “It’s a
really huge problem/opportunity/advantage, man.” (I wish I could meet
the person who infused the overworked term huge into our business
vocabulary.) The problem, of course, is that your budget or time alloca-
tion might turn out to be entirely wrong if you just approximate. “If we
don’t start slapping and shipping, we’re going to lose market share!”
Of course, recognizing the symptoms of skepticism helps, but to actually
overcome it and achieve the company-wide acceptance that your RFID
deployment needs, strategic thinking is your best bet. By thinking strategically,
you uncover the hard data and information that enables members of your
organization to make informed decisions and to communicate the rationale 
290
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

of your RFID deployment effectively. Some people make the mistake of associ-
ating an RFID deployment with other IT projects, like Y2K compliance, and
just estimate from there. This is a sure way of starting with faulty assump-
tions.
If you’re one of the company’s leaders, start thinking and focusing on a sensi-
ble business case and ROI analysis that give the senior leadership team a
reason to fulfill its destiny in a broad sense, but yet welcome the ability to
“surgically” apply the ROI in discrete, smaller areas and processes. If you 
are the one deploying the technology, welcome the “yardsticks” that a very
detailed ROI and strategic plan can offer, so that you know how to measure
success and failure.
Calculating ROI — A Tactical 
Approach to RFID
Return on investment (ROI) is the most talked-about topic in just about every
RFID conversation — and it’s unique to every company. Doing an ROI study
on RFID is a great way to become reacquainted with your company’s business
processes (BPs). In doing the analysis and performing the calculations, you
visit and revisit almost every process in the product life cycle.
As I mention in Chapter 15, completing the business case and calculating ROI
go together like the New York Yankees and overspending (did Steinbrenner
ever calculate an ROI on A-Rod?). To work through this process, you need 
to consider some primary areas within your company that will be greatly
impacted by an RFID implementation to understand how your business can
benefit strategically and economically. These areas range from the impact to
your legal department because of governmental compliance issues to chang-
ing the equipment and automation in the manufacturing process. Although
the impact of the technology is different for each area, the general areas to
look at include
 TREAD Act (Transportation Recall Enhancement & Accountability
Documentation), Homeland Security, international shipping (compliance)
 Customer requirements (compliance)
 Customer expectations (marketing)
 Customer value (marketing)
 Industrial risk (manufacturing)
 Internal efficiencies (supply chain and logistics)
In the sections that follow, I lead you through a simple, descriptive, easy-to-
understand ROI example. You pick up valuable tips on determining how RFID
291
Chapter 16: Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans

can help make your critical business processes more efficient. Fasten your
RFID-tagged seat belt — you won’t be able to stop until the ROI is completed!
Cha-ching! Finding ways 
to save with RFID
This is the section you’ve been waiting for — your chance to explain in num-
bers how RFID can save money and increase efficiency. To help you discover
potential ways to save money, this section explores a hypothetical company,
product, and ROI. If your company is like most of the ones that I’ve helped
comply with high-profile mandates, the first question the CEO or CFO asks is,
“What can we get out of it?” When the answer is, “You get to keep doing busi-
ness with your biggest customer,” the next question is usually, “Okay, how
can we get value out of it?” 
Suppose that you’re the owner of Acme Hose & Anvil Co., making hoses and
anvils for consumers, auto manufacturers, and pupils of Wile E. Coyote every-
where. The nature of all your products is that they’re hard to tag. You can’t
staple anything to them, bar codes tend to fall off them, and they’re hard to
store and ship. Labels were the only solution to product identification until
RFID came along.
For the ROI example in this chapter, here is some background information on
Acme and its hose division:
Annual sales
50,000,000 units
Annual gross revenue
$3,750,000,000
Logistics budget
Transportation
$300,000,000
Distribution
$100,000,000
Customer returns
$500,000
Average hose sales price
$75/each
Average shipping cost
$5/each
The following list shows some ways in which Acme can reduce its costs
through the implementation of RFID:
 Postponement, reduction, and elimination of labels
 Improved shipping accuracy (overage, short, and damage)
 Product age management
 Distribution center, warehousing, and inventory control savings
292
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

You can also discover other intangible savings. The following sections dis-
cuss these savings areas in detail.
Postponement, reduction, and elimination of labels
Most products require several types of labels for all kinds of reasons: visual
product identification, marketing (the pretty labels), processing expecta-
tions, and so on. This is often referred to as human-readable (the marketing
and text stuff) and machine-readable (the bar codes) data. For general pur-
poses, the three major sources of product labels are subject to modification
or elimination by the use of RFID:
 Manufacturing labels: Manufacturing labels can contain stock-keeping
units (SKUs), Product Numbers (PNs), in-the-clear text descriptions,
legal disclaimers, countries of origin, and other information.
 Distribution center (DC) and warehouse labels: DCs can add even more
product labels, enabling local less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation
processing to occur.
 Customer (dealer or retailer) labels: Customers might have their own
label requirements that cannot be accommodated by the manufacturer
at the time of production because the “build to stock or forecast” manu-
facturer does not yet know the final destination of the product. Such
data includes customer-specific PN and other regional warehousing
information. Such labels are occasionally applied by the manufacturer
whenever possible.
To determine whether RFID can help to either eliminate or reduce the label
workload, you first need to take a look at Acme’s costs:
$0.05 cost per label
$0.05 cost of application per label
$0.10 total per label
Acme ships and sells 50,000,000 hoses per year, so the total label cost for one
label per hose is $5,000,000. For our example, Acme currently applies three
labels to each hose, for a total cost of $15,000,000.
Now along comes the RFID tag. You can implant RFID tags in your hoses and
build the appropriate data into them as the hoses travel through the manu-
facturing and distribution processes. The manufacturer can eliminate at least
one label this way and postpone the printing of labels until the optimal time.
Through an RFID strategy of label application postponement, Acme can apply
one or two labels to the hose instead of three. For this example, assume that
you can eliminate one label from the process — that’s a $5,000,000 savings
and a big process gain.
293
Chapter 16: Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans

Michelin has followed a similar process and developed a very cost-effective
way to embed RFID tags in rubber tires. This example is a real-world applica-
tion based on today’s technology. Check out Figure 16-1 to see how the RFID
tag is built into the tire.
Newly developed RFID chips can store a significant amount of information —
enough to incorporate manufacturer, third-party logistics provider, and cus-
tomer data. With RFID tags, it pays for you to postpone printing and applying
labels until the last possible minute for the following reasons:
 You can add more comprehensive information.
 The tags have less chance of being damaged in the manufacturing
process.
Print-and-apply solutions are becoming more and more sophisticated as the
industry grows. With a print-and-apply RFID label, you can automatically apply
the RFID tag, a bar code, in-the-clear text, and graphic logos and images during
the manufacturing process — an all-in-one solution. See Chapter 9 for how-to
information about applying labels, so you can determine how you might be
able to save money in this area and ensure 100-percent accurate reads.
Improved shipping accuracy
Every company wants to improve on logistics. Nothing annoys a customer
more than receiving the wrong quantity of merchandise (especially if it’s a
shortage) or an incorrect product mix. RFID can help your business improve
significantly in this area.
Acme Hose currently spends $1,000,000 annually performing physical verifi-
cation of shipments, either through shipment sampling or a 100-percent
manual verification. Add another $250,000 in customer-assessed shipping
RFID tag

294
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

penalties for errors traceable to Acme. What you (and Acme) need is a sure-
fire way to ensure that the right stuff gets on the right truck in the right quan-
tity. Enter RFID.
One of the major challenges in the logistics industry is items that never make
it on an outbound truck even though the computer system says that the
items are indeed on the truck. This creates a tremendous downstream effect
because the inventory arrives at the store (according to the computer
system) but isn’t really there. The effect is magnified when the store orders
more of the item that never arrived when the system says it did. Then the
item actually shows up, along with all the extra ordered. Then the store has
to cut the price just to get rid of the extra. Whew! What a messs! RFID can fix
this nasty bullwhip effect by making sure that what crosses a dock door
(pallet, case, or item) is what is associated with a truckload. Here’s how:
1. When a shipment is built and staged, customer-specific shipment
information is added to the RFID tag on the item and/or pallet upon
which the item is placed.
2. Dock door RFID portals read the shipment as the forklift operator
loads the pallet onto the trailer.
See Chapter 6 for the lowdown on dock door portals.
3. The middleware or the warehouse management application compares
the information that the RFID portal reads with specific and detailed
customer order information. If a 100 percent match of quantity and
product type is not obtained, the portal sounds the alarm, and the
software will determine if there is either a product missing or an
extra product on the pallet. If no alarm sounds, the shipper has 100-
percent accuracy.
Customers have certain expectations about shipping accuracy, as well they
should. Assume that the following customers and original equipment manu-
facturers (OEMs) have these standards with respect to shipping accuracy:
Company
Acceptable Error Rates
OEM A
50 parts per million
OEM B
100 parts per million
OEM C
100 parts per million
OEM D
150 parts per million
CUST 1
500 parts per million
CUST 2
600 parts per million
With RFID, Acme can obtain less than 50 parts per million error rate in ship-
ping accuracy — a vast reduction in corrective costs (reshipments, premium
transportation charges, customer penalties, lost sales, and so on). A huge
295
Chapter 16: Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans

boost in customer satisfaction will also inevitably result. By complying to the
lowest common denominator in the universe of customers and OEMs, RFID
ensures compliance across all trading partners.
So by removing the current $250,000 in penalties mentioned earlier, adding
another $750,000 in reduced verification costs to that savings, out of the orig-
inal $1,250,000 in shipping verification and penalty costs, Acme can conserva-
tively estimate an 80 percent gain, or $1,000,000. Not too shabby, eh? You
might make a justification for eliminating all the shipping verification costs
and penalties, claiming 100 percent of these savings, but again, for this partic-
ular example, just estimate conservatively.
Product age management
Because certain hoses Acme sells have shelf lives, some products cannot
exceed customer or manufacturer age constraints before the customer
receives the product and the consumer buys it. Manufacturers and distribu-
tors in the food, pharmaceuticals, and other consumer product goods indus-
tries are sensitive to these requirements, too.
Age lot management is achieved by clustering similarly aged lots separately.
First-in, first-out (FIFO) techniques are employed on a lot basis to try to
ensure that older lots are shipped first. The warehouse management system
(WMS) usually considers age in its shipping designation logic. For example,
the following product lots are stored in an Acme DC:
Lot Name
Age
Lot A
72 weeks
Lot B
24 weeks
Lot C
40 weeks
The following OEMs have age constraints in receiving products from their
suppliers:
Company
Age Constraint
OEM A
52 weeks at time of shipment
OEM B
39 weeks at time of shipment
OEM C
26 weeks at time of shipment
OEM D
40 weeks at time of shipment
After an order from OEM A, the shipper’s WMS would logically try to ship Lot
A first. However, it can’t because OEM A requires the product to be less than
52 weeks old at time of shipment. In this case, the WMS would choose Lot C
because Lot C is older than Lot B and satisfies OEM A’s age requirement.
Additionally OEM C could only receive a shipment from Lot B and should not
be sent items from C and A.
296
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Such an age-management system appears easily workable but in fact is
fraught with exceptions and errors that creep in when human beings try to
comply with what the computer kindly suggests. Here are a few examples of
problems that might occur:
 Products from other lots get mingled with the target lot.
 The target lot can be split, with part of it conforming and part of it 
nonconforming.
 Entire lots can be mis-shipped.
Enter RFID to the rescue. Products’ ages are encoded in the RFID tag during
the manufacturing process. Just prior to shipment, an RFID read can deter-
mine whether the product is permissible for shipment based on an on-the-fly
calculation between product birth date and product ship date. Bingo, no
more age errors!
In the past, when out-of-age hoses were shipped to customers, Acme had to
rectify the situation by reshipping the product and using premium trans-
portation. So 50,000 hoses at twice the normal shipping rate ($10 instead of
$5 each) cost the company $500,000.
In addition to saving shipping costs related to out-of-age shipments, RFID can
help reduce waste, too. Acme scraps a fair quantity of hoses every year
because they are out of age. By using RFID to achieve 100-percent accuracy in
the age-management process, Acme can recover revenues to the tune of
$3,750,000. This is based on a 0.1 percent scrap rate, or 50,000 of 50,000,000
hoses. Here’s the math:
number of hoses scrapped × average sales price per unit = savings
50,000 × $75.00 = $3,750,000
The bottom line is that the 100 percent accuracy in the age-management
process saves the company $4,250,000:
$3,750,000 + $500,000 = $4,250,000
Distribution center, warehousing, and inventory control savings
Your company can realize gains within the four walls — that is, of a manufac-
turing or distribution facility — as follows:
 Eliminate the need to search for lost material.
 Eliminate time and expense to correct lost material problems through
movement validation — actually knowing where work-in-process or
inventory is at any time in the facility.
 Save time finding appropriate storage locations through better and
faster product ID with RFID.
297
Chapter 16: Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans

 Maximize product flow through cross-docking (shipping directly from
receiving without breaking down the pallet), thereby reducing pick-and-
stow costs (to pick the items from storage to fill an order and stow them
into storage when they come in).
 Achieve more efficient pick-and-stow patterns. Better use of task inter-
leaving with RFID-enabled product results in less deadheading in the
warehouse and more picks per hour.
 Reduce inventory requirements, cycle counting, wall to wall, location
surveys, and frequent inventories.
Because savings in this area are dependent on the type and method of DC
operation, use the most conservative estimate commonly accepted in the
logistics industry. For the Acme example, assume that the adoption of full
RFID in DCs and warehouses will bring a 1-percent savings in product han-
dling and storage operations budgets, or $1,000,000.
Intangible areas and gains to consider in your RFID analysis
The RFID savings area examples mentioned earlier pertain to the most obvious
and tangible product life cycle processes. The good news is that many other
“soft” or intangible areas also benefit from using RFID. Conservatively estimate
savings in these areas and add that to your overall company strategy and ROI.
All businesses struggle with weighting various intangible areas when it comes
to budget or strategy planning sessions. This is particularly true if a consult-
ing shop veteran or card-carrying MBA leads your strategy and planning
events. These folks love hard data and numbers, and if you can’t put a metric
on it, they don’t think it’s worth talking about. Yet, as any well-rounded exec-
utive knows, intangibles such as client satisfaction, employee morale, adher-
ence to a mission, and audacious goals can separate a good company from a
great company. Deploying an RFID network also has its share of intangible
strategic benefits:
 Improved customs accuracy: You can avoid customs penalties by having
correct country of origin data codes. Shipping delays for incorrect inter-
national shipping documentation can result in significant costs.
Gain estimate: 0.1 percent of transportation costs
 Segregation of rectified product: In some cases, OEMs and other
resellers won’t accept rectified product (product brought into confor-
mity). RFID can help by toggling a product rectified logical field to true or
false. In other words, the RFID tag can let you determine if the product is
in conformity or not.
Gain estimate: 0.01 percent of transportation costs
 More accurate plant-level homologation: OEMs can require that the
product they receive originates from only certified supplier plants —
such homologation is checked at receipt. Internally oriented homologa-
tions can also prescribe whether a certain product can be shipped to a
298
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

particular country, customer, or area. RFID can help by checking against
a customer versus plant database at shipment time, ensuring that no
errors are made.
Gain estimate: 0.05 percent of transportation costs
 Prevention of questionable product shipments: If your quality group
wants to make some last-minute checks on a product lot, it can ensure
that these products do not leave the DCs by coding the database against
which the shipment process runs. If a warehouser tries to load a trailer
with this product, the RFID portal alarm sounds and prevents the ship-
ment from closing. This prevents the company from expending money
and resources to fetch product back while in transit — or worse yet,
after having been received by a customer.
Gain estimate: 0.05 percent of transportation costs
 Automation of the customer return process: Most of what is verified
manually can be written into the RFID tag to speed processing.
Gain estimate: 30 percent gain in operational costs associated with returns
 Gray market control: Products identified with unremoveable and unkill-
able RFID tags can be easily identified if they stray from the mainstream
product flow into questionable domains. Thieves are less apt to steal
and remarket products that can be detected by electronic reads.
Gain estimate: 0.05 percent of gross revenue
 Technology team interest: This area is one that no dollar figure can be
put on, but like the credit card ad says — it’s priceless. RFID offers an
exciting new technology that the whole technology team can learn and
play with. In an environment in which cost cutting is the norm, any new
initiative can jump-start the morale of a tired tech team.

Chapter 16: Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans

Sometimes you can put hard numbers on intangibles, and sometimes you
can’t. When you can’t, you need to use an estimating technique everyone can
agree on. I’d like to share a technique with you that has worked for me many
times in the past. It’s called the halving process. Here’s how it works:
1. Assemble subject matter experts (SMEs) on the area in question.
For example, get your logistics guy, your finance gal, and your IT guru all
in the same room.
2. Describe in general terms what RFID can bring to the table and your
best guess as to fuzzy savings estimates in their respective areas.
3. From the SMEs’ knowledge of specific areas (such as purchasing,
legal, personnel, and so on), distill and superimpose their ideas on
sales and shipment data.
4. Examine the data developed by the SME team and discuss the resul-
tant savings estimates against annual business data.
On occasion, when challenged with a soft estimate, I respond by saying,
“Don’t like that number? Okay, let’s cut it in half.”
5. If necessary, halve the intangible estimate and then have another dis-
cussion with the SMEs on whether the figure is close to the truth.
6. Continue this halving process until all stakeholders can agree on the
number.
An extremely conservative estimate for an intangible gain is always better
than none at all.
Tallying up the estimated costs
When you calculate the costs of your RFID deployment, you need to address
a handful of cost categories. (Note that this task is Step 8 of the business case
methodology I outline in Chapter 15.) In the following list, I discuss each cate-
gory and its key characteristics, which will help you make more accurate 
estimates:
 Hardware (one-time cost): If our friends at ACME are setting up 15 inter-
rogation zones across their distribution center, they need to incorporate
these capital costs. These costs consist of tag applicators, door readers,
forklift readers, hand-held readers, and controllers. Assessing the touch
points (points where RFID will impact your business) is essential for
accurate hardware costing. (See Chapter 3 for details on determining
those touch points and Chapter 15 for details on how you organize your
team to complete this task as part of creating a business case.) Some of
the variables that you need to determine are what items you’ll tag, how
300
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

many you’ll tag, and specific distribution center information (number of
doors, forklifts, hand-held devices currently in use for bar code reading).
Use the following low and high estimates after you determine where you
plan to set up RFID interrogation zones (based on those touch points).
Component
Low Estimate
High Estimate
Tag applicators
$20,000
$100,000
Door readers
$1,500
$8,000
Forklift readers
$8,000
$10,000
Hand-held readers
$5,000
$6,000
Conveyors
$1,000
$7,000
Controllers
$2,000
$3,000
 Application integration (one-time cost): This is probably the most inac-
curate cost category in RFID business cases. The only way to make a rel-
atively accurate estimate is to analyze the list of potential applications
that require some degree of integration. (You create this list in Chapter
15.) First, determine how large the integration effort will be by designat-
ing each application as either Level 1 or Level 2:
• Level 1: These applications require 200 to 500+ total person days
of labor for average Level 1 application integration.
• Level 2: These applications require 50 to 200 total person days of
labor for average Level 2 application integration.
Here are some solid numbers to use, based on the labor required. For
each Class 1 application, use $300,000 for the low estimate and $725,000
for the high estimate. For each Class 2 application, use $100,000 for the
low estimate and $240,000 for the high estimate. These numbers assume
a standard internal and external mix of development resources.
 Software (one-time cost): Middleware is a necessary component for RFID
to work properly because it’s the engine that makes sense out of the
myriad RF reads throughout the supply chain. See Chapter 11 for a more
detailed discussion of middleware. For licensing costs, you can safely
plan for $200,000 for a low estimate and $450,000 for a high estimate.
 Training (one-time cost): The best gauge for RFID training for your com-
pany is the training you may have already conducted for a warehouse
management system implementation. As a general rule, use 6 hours of
training for your low estimate, and 10 hours of training for your high esti-
mate. You can then estimate the total cost by using this simple equation:
Training hours × Number of distribution center associates
× Average fully loaded rate
301
Chapter 16: Fitting RFID into Strategic Plans

 Tags (on-going cost): Tags are by far your largest RFID system invest-
ment, and they are an on-going cost. The first and most important deter-
mination that you need to make is how many tags you need over the
next five years. In “Step 3. Determine drivers, strategies, and enablers,”
you discover why you need to tag at either the unit, case, and pallet
level or at the case and pallet level. Now you need to do the math. For
each product, look at production numbers and sales forecast numbers
to understand how many tags will be required.
Because RFID tag costs will come down dramatically, the following table
shows how tag costs per unit might look over a five-year period. You can
use these cost estimates, along with the numbers of items you need to
tag, to determine what the on-going cost will be for five years.
Year
Low Estimate
High Estimate
2005
$.25
$.80
2006
$.14
$.60
2007
$.11
$.45
2008
$.10
$.25
2009
$.04
$.10
 Maintenance of readers and software (on-going cost): You need to pay
annual maintenance costs for the hardware and software, following the
first year you procure them. As a rule, maintenance costs 15 to 18 per-
cent of the initial procurement cost (licensing costs for software). Plan
on years 2, 3, 4, and 5 for these annual maintenance costs. You’ll likely
replace the hardware and software in the first five years.
 System maintenance and management (on-going cost): The RFID system
impacts your information system’s operating costs. Use $5,000 per month
for your low estimate and $30,000 per month for your high estimate.
 Data management (on-going cost): These costs turn out to be significantly
less than you might expect. Assume that each tag is scanned five times
between manufacturing and shipping out of the distribution center. Each
scan consumes 50 bytes (that is, 16 bytes for the electronic product code
[EPC] and 4 bytes for the time stamp, plus an extra 30 bytes for the loca-
tion, event, and so on). Assuming 100 million tags per year, this yields 500
million records (rows) and 25GB of raw storage per year for event data
(not including database overhead). Database overhead is generally 50 per-
cent, which yields 37.5GB per year of necessary disk storage for every 100
million tags read 5 times.

Putting together a costs/benefits analysis
After you account for all the business processes for applicability, both tangi-
ble and intangible, you have everything you need to put together an RFID
ROI. For the Acme example, you had to generate several assumptions here
and there to complete the picture. You now know how RFID will save Acme
$13,905,000.
Next, you need to net out the implementation costs and take another look at
your ROI position. Figure 16-2 shows an overall three-year costs/benefits pic-
ture, using the assumption that individual RFID tag costs will be $0.25 for the
first year, $0.15 for Year 2, and $0.10 for Year 3.
ROI as a tool for strategic expansion
As you understand the impact of the technology and get a handle on the spe-
cific costs, you need to include critical triggers for expansion in your ROI analy-
sis. Here are some points to consider when scaling up your RFID network:
 Start with one specific project at a time. If you adopt a measured
approach to RFID deployment, you can assimilate the technology 
and understand better its impact on your enterprise. After you under-
stand that one project well, you can start to look for other applications
in your world.
 Roll out the applications based on a known ROI or key business
metric related to impact. For example, you can base the timing of two
or three of these potential-use cases on ROI. In your ROI, a little analysis
will reveal the key drivers in the model (tag price, reader cost, and so
on), and you can set triggers for scaling up to those solutions when they
yield a positive ROI. So if you know the ROI is break even when, for
example, readers are less than $1,000 each or tags are less than $0.10,
you can start those projects, or at least put them in the budget, when
prices drop to those triggers.
One other critical component determines when and how you scale up your
RFID network — your partners. If your partners are also implementing the
technology, your benefits can be orders of magnitude higher by closely col-
laborating with them. The more of your suppliers, customers, and partners
you can share real-time data with, the more efficient and real-time your
processes can become. And one day you’ll get to that nirvana when the net-
work does all the work for you.

Tag and You’re It: RFID as 
a Competitive Strategy
Early adopters would say, “How can you not justify the adoption of RFID?”
Your business’s strategic focus will help you justify the significant investment
required. The well-known Harvard professor Michael Porter formulated a
strategic analysis for industry called the Five Forces model. These five forces
are
 Supplier power: This force includes variables such as supplier concen-
tration, how important volume is to a supplier, and so on.
 Threat of substitutes: Switching costs, buyer’s willingness to switch, and
the trade-off between performance and price are all examples of this
force.

 Degree of rivalry: Industry concentration and growth, product differen-
tiation, brand identity, fixed costs (money already invested, like for soft-
ware development or building a data center), and so on dictate the
degree of rivalry.
 Buyer power: Buyers’ ability to bargain, how informed buyers are, the
number of buyers, price sensitivity, product differentiation, substitutes
available, and so on are all part of this force.
 Barriers to entry: This force comprises the learning curve for propri-
etary products, access to inputs, government policy, economies of scale,
and more.
Figure 16-3 shows a diagram of Porter’s model. (For more information about
Porter’s model, go to www.quickmba.com/strategy/porter.shtml.)
Strategic leaders can apply Porter’s model to achieve an acute understanding
of the competitive context in which their companies operate. By so doing,
they can better and more accurately articulate the strategic value of RFID.
For example, an RFID implementation can
 Differentiate your company in a tightly competitive market: Low levels
of product differentiation within a market sector, whether perceived or
real, are often associated with higher levels of rivalry (competition).
RFID can then be seen as a definite differentiator — you have imple-
mented it, and your rivals have not or lag behind. You are the market
sector leader — hooray for you!

 Help a company that is losing market share: Suppose that your firm is
losing market position. According to Porter, this can also cause rivalry
intensification. Again, this is a great opportunity for RFID to make the
difference — if you adopt ahead of your competitors.
 Increase your company’s chances of surviving an industry shakeout:
Industry shakeouts can also warrant special and timely consideration
for an RFID implementation. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) founder
Bruce Henderson coined the Rule of Three and Four: A stable market
will not have more than three significant competitors, and the largest
competitor will have no more than four times the market share of the
smallest. For more about the Rule of Three and Four, visit
www.bcg.com/this_is_bcg/bcg_history/bcg_history_1976.jsp
Implications of the rule include the following:
• If there are a larger number of competitors, a shakeout is
inevitable.
• Surviving rivals will have to grow faster than the market.
• Eventual losers will have a negative cash flow if they attempt to
grow.
• All except the two largest rivals will be losers.
• The definition of what constitutes the “market” is strategically
important.
Armed with the preceding information, you can see how important an
RFID implementation can be in a closed industry, with just a few competi-
tors. Got a product that’s difficult to differentiate? Trying to convince
consumers that your product is not a commodity? You might want to
look at using RFID as your differentiator and come out on top of any
shakeout.
One of ODIN technologies’ clients was a small supplier to Wal-Mart who vol-
unteered to be part of the first 100 to comply. This move not only got the
attention of Wal-Mart’s RFID team but also put this company in favored status
with the buyers; this firm’s business with Wal-Mart has since tripled, and it is
achieving a positive ROI on its very simple entry-level RFID program.

What to Look for When
Considering Outsourcing
In This Chapter
 Letting someone else touch your RFID
 Finding the right firm for the job
 Investigating the dangers of outsourcing
 Ensuring quality and service from an outsourcer
O
ne of the scary things about RFID and the electronic product code (EPC)
is that 60,000 enterprises have to adopt the technology over a three-
year period. Those companies have no choice if they want to supply to Wal-
Mart, the Department of Defense (DoD), Target, Best Buy, and others. Many
more companies have read promising case studies about the technology and
want to adopt RFID for some benefit to their bottom line. With all these 
enterprises adopting RFID at essentially the same time, there are not enough
RFID experts in the world today to service even one percent of these firms
full-time.
Currently, the RFID industry is so new that only a few providers are able to
offer an outsource model. But in the coming years, the industry will evolve
with various delivery models, traditional outsourcing firms will get into the
RFID space, and specialty providers will focus on outsourcing only RFID.
Because timelines are short and experience is scarce, you might have no
choice but to turn your system over to an outsourcing company to install,
manage, administer, and monitor. Like giving your daughter away for the rest
of her life to some guy you met only a year or two ago, turning your RFID
system over to someone else comes with mixed feelings.
This chapter is here to help. First, you need to decide whether outsourcing is
truly right for your business and worth the risks associated with handing
over the keys to someone else. If you decide that outsourcing is what you
need, here I explain what role you should play at the various stages in the

project and walk you through the decision-making process for each stage,
including
 Outlining your needs for potential partners
 Choosing an outsourcing partner
 Negotiating the service level agreement (SLA) and contract
You also get all the inside secrets from me, a CEO who has been running out-
sourcing companies for most of his career — just promise not to tell anyone.
Why Outsource Your RFID Network?
Not everyone is a candidate for outsourcing. Step one is to evaluate why you
are considering outsourcing your RFID network to someone else. The pri-
mary reasons for outsourcing are
 Focusing on your core competency: What you do best likely isn’t set-
ting up and running RFID networks.
 Lacking resources: You cannot find and hire dedicated physics and
radio frequency experts to keep on staff full-time.
 Reaping tax benefits: By using an outsourcer for “off-balance-sheet”
financing, an RFID network becomes an operating expense, which has
the potential to limit corporate taxes.
 Increasing performance: Quality outsourcers have the best hardware,
software, and systems to optimize an RFID network and usually stay at
the forefront of new technology developments.
Identifying and Avoiding the Risks
Outsourcing is not always a bed of roses. Certain risks are involved with
allowing an outside firm to manage all or part of your critical infrastructure.
The risks can be broken down into four categories:
 Technology risks: RFID is a critical new technology that to many organi-
zations will become as important to their infrastructures as the Internet.
Outsourcing the critical component to the wrong partner can put you at
risk of technology obsolescence and leave key internal staff members
with no understanding of the technology.
308
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Education and regular reviews of milestones and benchmarks are your
best defense against failure. You can also limit the technology risk by
having one or two members of your team dedicated to keeping up with
the technology.
 Core business risks: If something happens to the outsourcing relation-
ship, the risk to your core business can be considerable. Imagine that
your RFID network goes down two years from now, when you are doing
most of your business with the Department of Defense, which then
refuses to accept any of your products. The time spent finding another
provider or fighting for attention when 60,000 other companies are look-
ing for help can be very expensive. This is why it is critical to look at the
history of the firm: Make sure that the firm you’re considering has been
around for a few years and also has a solid balance sheet.
 Business strategy and process risk: Balancing what is best for the com-
pany and what is best for the RFID network is usually not something that
the outsourcing provider considers. An example of this type of risk would
be if your busiest day of the year is the day after Thanksgiving, but that’s
the week when your outsourcer chooses to do a system upgrade and test.
The responsiveness of a vendor is critical, particularly when it comes time
to deliver new products or deploy new systems. Make sure that you put
these details in your contract — for instance, not allowing any system
upgrades or tests the last week of every month if that’s your busy week.
 Operational risks: With an outsourced relationship, you count on an
outside firm to help you meet your deadlines, be fully compliant with a
mandate, and not violate any federal regulations. These are tall orders,
particularly for people just learning about the technology themselves.
Make sure that your outsourcing partner has demonstrated the ability 
to execute for real-world clients. Look for real-world case studies.
Is Outsourcing Right for You?
I know it would be helpful to give you a couple of quick yes or no answers to
the outsourcing question, but like so many information technology (IT) deci-
sions, it’s not that easy. What I can give you is a decision process that might
help, however. Figure 17-1 shows the decision-making process that your team
should consider as you look at outsourcing versus using internal resources.
Although outsourcing is often done because of lack of inhouse talent, inhouse
knowledge to make the right decisions is critical. Chapter 15 introduces key
ways to educate your team.
309
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

Do your goals and timeline indicate 
a clear need to outsource?
The core competency and business objectives of your enterprise drive the
decision to outsource or not. After getting the team in place, educating your
team, and gathering critical data, you can often make a decision in the very
early going about whether you need to outsource. This is particularly true if
you are under a specific timeline, like a Wal-Mart deadline, and you do not
have existing internal resources with any RFID background.

For instance, if, after getting the team together, you find out that IT is having
difficulty keeping up with current projects or is in the middle of a new system
deployment, it becomes clear that outside expertise is needed. If this is the
case, you need to begin looking for a vendor to help you deploy, design, and
maintain the system.
The following sections clarify how your RFID team can determine what your
goals and timeline are and whether you have the resources to meet those or
have a clear need to outsource.
Defining your business goals and timeline
If you are considering outsourcing an RFID network, you need to determine
your strategic goals and business requirements — and to do that, you need
to know what is involved in the project. That’s why education of the team is
the key foundation. Sitting down with the RFID team and specifying the goals
of the RFID network will help you
 Determine the approach you want to take to outsourcing
 Decide between using internal resources or an outside firm
In order to figure out your approach and whether you can use internal
resources, the team needs to address the following questions:
 What is the goal of the RFID network? Example goals include slap-and-
ship compliance, full system integration, cost savings, and technology
advantage. Chapter 15 and 16 help you define what your goals are
beyond meeting a mandate. Those two chapters help you build a busi-
ness case and a return on investment (ROI) analysis. Or you might want
to start out with a slap-and-ship strategy and move to a full production
system a year or two down the road.
A production system implies that RFID readers are located at all critical
choke points within an enterprise — at the dock doors, on the conveyor
belts, at shrink-wrap stations, and so on. It further implies that data is
being gathered and integrated into a larger business intelligence or admin-
istration system. That system might be warehouse management, enter-
prise resource planning, inventory control, or other software. The bottom
line is that when an RFID network is fully integrated to a production level,
it is a key piece of the corporate infrastructure puzzle. If the extent of the
RFID implementation is one portal and only a small number of cases are
being tagged to meet a mandate, it’s not a production system.
 What’s the timeline? You need to know when the network needs to be 
in place. If you want to move from slap and ship to full production, the
team needs to decide when you’ll get to a full production system. If the
answer is that you won’t know until you get there, plan a hypothetical
date 24 months out and acknowledge that this date will be flexible. At
least having an initial date will help you work back to the design compo-
nent and help guide your decision-making process.
311
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

Can your business meet those goals in time?
Before you can decide to outsource your RFID network, you need to have a
good understanding of your business processes in the supply chain, or asset
management arena, and also the strengths and weaknesses of your IT and
operations groups.
Deciding who will be responsible for the RFID network and what their skills
and costs will be is a key driver. Usually, IT or the operations staff is responsi-
ble for administration of the RFID network. To make the outsourcing decision,
you will need accurate understanding of their capabilities so that you know
the level of service required from your outsourcing partner. Some questions
your RFID team likely needs to address include
 Will your business processes have to change if you outsource?
 Will you have to add access to your facilities or network for the out-
sourcing partner?
 What is the internal cost to perform the same operations that your out-
sourcer will produce? This can include everything from updating
firmware on the readers to replacing antennas.
 How much time will be spent going up a learning curve for your internal
team?
 What other projects could the staff dedicated to RFID be working on?
These are all questions that are likely to clarify whether internal or external
expertise should be used.
If, after initial discovery, you cannot make a definite decision either way,
more investigation is required. The next two critical decisions are based
around owning the network and running the system.
Do you need to run or own the system?
The corporate financing strategy should dictate whether owning the hardware
and software associated with an RFID network is critical. This is why I suggest
having a bean counter on the team. (See Chapter 15 for the lowdown on putting
together the team.) A representative from finance will drive this verdict. Here
are some considerations that can help you figure out the answer:
 Is it more cost effective to own the system? Usually, these types of deci-
sions are based on your corporation’s weighted average cost of capital
(WACC), or how much money costs you over time, versus what it will
cost to outsource the same function. Also take into account the differ-
ence between leasing the system (an operating expense that is taken out
before taxes) and capital expense (which is usually depreciated over
three years).
312
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

This choice is similar to one that you might make about buying or leas-
ing a car. Leasing the car means relatively little cash out of your pocket
to start with, similar monthly payments, but no value at the end of the
term; buying it means more money outlay upfront, usually a little more
each month, but an owned asset with some value to it at the end of the
loan term.
 How will the RFID network fit into your infrastructure? Deciding
whether you need to run the system is a more difficult analysis when
considering an RFID network. The difficulty comes in trying to under-
stand where an RFID network will fit into your corporate infrastructure
strategy in the long term.
If you are putting in a minimal system to meet one of the big mandates,
you might be tempted to decide for simplicity’s sake and ease of imple-
mentation to just let someone else handle this relatively small project.
Two years down the road, however, you might be trying to figure out
how to grow the network to include all your dock doors, forklifts, con-
veyor belts, and other key infrastructure — and be left trying to design
an expansive, comprehensive network around the initial deployment
that you don’t own or run. This will make integration into enterprise
resource planning (ERP) or warehouse management systems that much
more difficult. Always design with the end in mind.
 Can you afford the risks of switching providers? Many outsourcing
firms focus on business growth by making the switching costs high for
their users and “locking them in.” If you know that you’re going to inte-
grate your RFID network heavily into your IT backbone, you might not
want to outsource the data delivery. This would include the middleware
or reader interface layer (discussed in detail in Chapter 11). You might,
however, want to consider outsourcing the performance monitoring and
health of the network, which is one of the most complex components of
an RFID network.
 Would outsourcing only monitoring and performance work well for
your business? Outsourcing just the monitoring and performance com-
ponent has been a successful and proven strategy for IT projects ranging
from network connectivity to corporate firewalls. This strategy limits
your switching costs and keeps the control of the critical data under
your power. It allows you to benefit from the latest technology systems
and the best expertise, but limits your risk because you’re able to pull
the plug on your provider (or vice versa) without shutting down your
RFID capabilities. You also have the benefit of capitalizing the hardware.
Always be aware that making switching costs high is a primary goal of most
outsourcing firms. Switching costs are loosely defined as the pain of migrating
from one provider to another provider or back in house. The switching costs
can include downtime to the network, resources involved with migration plan-
ning, penalties for getting out of long-term contracts, and so on. The better a
firm is at making the switching costs high, the more assured it is of not losing
customers, even if its service level falls below industry averages.
313
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

If you don’t need to run or own the system, you’ve come to the last stage of
analysis: measuring three distinct areas of the business to compare outsourc-
ing versus keeping a function inhouse:
 Resource analysis
 ROI analysis
 Performance analysis
The following sections explain how to make these comparisons.
Analyzing your resources
The resource analysis is perhaps the fastest way to determine whether you
should outsource. It becomes more complicated with RFID, however, because
many enterprises are convinced that RFID is going to be an essential compo-
nent of the corporate infrastructure and want to maintain control over the
system and be empowered to make strategic choices based on internal
knowledge.
Before you opt for control, however, you need to answer a few key questions.
Can you meet your deadlines?
The biggest resource challenge to the early adopters is the deadline associ-
ated with deploying a system. Your existing IT department might be very anx-
ious to learn about and develop expertise with RFID, but you must balance
that desire against a DoD or Wal-Mart mandate that states that you need the
system up and running accurately in the immediate future.
Your analysis might clearly show that it would be more cost-effective to use
existing staff, but the timeline and other projects underway make that impos-
sible. The physics of RFID are very complex, and many early adopters saw
their project timelines double or triple in length after getting into the project,
particularly when they had only a trial-and-error process to work from.
If, after investigating internal resources, the timeline to compliance is leaning
you toward outsourcing, split your timeline analysis into two resource com-
ponents — planning and operations:
 Planning: Internal staff needs to be involved in the planning stage at the
start of the project to identify scope (what and how much you want to
accomplish), define project goals, set up deliverable deadlines, and so
on. Because outsourcing means bringing in new resources and team
members, the planning time will be more involved than if you were plan-
ning an internal project.
314
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

For the planning of an RFID network to tag and ship, you should allocate
three full months of 8–10 hours per week of involvement from dedicated
internal resources. For deployment of a fully integrated RFID network, a
good rule is to dedicate 20 man-hours a week for four months for each
facility involved in the project.
The time for internal resources will be spent creating the statement of
work (a detailed description of all the work to be performed), defining
and mapping business processes, deciding on location and number of
interrogation zones (where you will set up readers and antennas), updat-
ing senior management, verifying performance, and being the liaison
between corporate and partner entities such as Wal-Mart.
 Operations: The operations role required of your internal resources will
not actually be installing and setting up the systems because you’re rely-
ing on someone else for that. However, internal resources are still needed
for projects like wiring power, running cable, and planning the integration
with your IT systems. The lion’s share of the effort will be spent getting
the data from the RFID readers and converting it into something useful
for your business applications to use. This requires your internal staff to
understand how data is exported from the middleware (also called the
EPC information services or Savant, the piece that filters and smoothes
all the reader data) layer and if that middleware is included in the out-
sourcing arrangement.
Can internal staff handle the demands of RFID?
If you are one of the proactive thinkers investigating and deploying an RFID
network before you are required to, you have the luxury of beefing up inter-
nal resources to take ownership of the project. This has a number of advan-
tages. First, it keeps control and understanding on your side. This is critical
even if you decide to outsource so that you understand what is involved in
deployment and management. Secondly, it gives your internal staff an excit-
ing new technology to play with, a motivator that you might not want to over-
look. Giving employees new technology to work with can often be more
powerful than salary or stock options when it comes to job satisfaction.
Having the chance to work with RFID can breathe new life into a technology
organization that might have spent the last several years cutting costs,
people, and projects in order to weather a bad economy.
The most important issue that you need to consider is the IT staff’s current
utilization. As motivating as a new technology can be, if it’s another project
placed on top of someone who is already putting in 60-hour weeks, you could
have a recipe for disaster. Find out upfront how much flexibility your IT has
to take on new projects. For example, are other projects ending, or is there
allocation for new staffing? The answers will also help determine whether
your internal staff can handle the stress and excitement of a major new infra-
structure project.
315
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

If you decide to use internal staff to get up to speed on RFID, you should look
for folks with electrical engineering, physics, or computer science back-
grounds as a solid foundation for learning radio-frequency basics.
Money, money, money: Comparing 
outsourcing and internal costs
The second decision-making criterion is the ROI or cost-benefit analysis. In
Chapter 15, I talk about a very pragmatic approach to determining the return
on investment on an RFID project. The outsourcing ROI analysis is slightly dif-
ferent in that it assumes that you will deploy the RFID network. Now what
you are comparing is internal costs versus outsourcing costs. To figure out
the ROI analysis for the outsourcing model, you need to determine whether
you are going to own or lease the hardware, and how much of the infrastruc-
ture will be operating expense versus capital expense. This is where the CFO
on your team comes in handy. Taking the basic business case and adapting it
for outsourcing is a key project for the finance team.
Keep in mind, however, that although the ROI might not be greater for an out-
sourcing option, the risks might be lower, the timeline faster, or the impact
on other projects lessened. That is why the ROI analysis is only one of three
parameters (along with resources and performance) to consider at this stage
in the analysis.
To compare internal ROI and outsourced ROI, the statement of work and pro-
ject plan have to be available and detailed enough for your finance team to
see all the costs as well as how the costs differ from outsourcing versus
inhouse endeavors. In the analysis, look at four key components:
 Total project cost: This includes deployment time, certification, hard-
ware, software, business process reengineering, and so on. When consid-
ering internal resources, you need to include the significant time and
cost of training, education, and if necessary, recruitment of new employ-
ees with specific expertise.
 Annual maintenance costs: This is the most difficult to assess accurately
because RFID is such a new technology. However, if you outsource to a
reputable vendor, you will know exactly what the annual costs will be.
For internal purposes, you can choose a multiple of your typical IT main-
tenance costs. For example, if your TCP/IP network has an annual main-
tenance cost of 25 percent of total project costs, you might want to use a
multiple of 1.5 or 2.0 times that maintenance cost for the first couple of
years of an RFID network to account for new technology and a learning
curve.
316
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

 Risk-based costs: Considering what happens when things go bad is one
of the more esoteric components of an outsourcing analysis but one that
is important to try to quantify. An example of a risk-based cost is the
cost of keeping the system internal to the organization. Another example
is purchasing the hardware, software, and tools, and then having a pro-
tocol or standards change that renders all your technology obsolete. See
Chapter 2 for details on protocols and standards.
A risk-based cost that is easier to quantify is failure to comply with man-
dates because of poor RFID engineering. If product going to big retailers
does not have a tag on it when the systems go full production, the sup-
pliers will be assessed a penalty for each noncompliance case. It’s worse
with the DoD; those guys will just flatly refuse to accept a shipment that
is not readable from an EPC-compliant RFID system. These risk-based
costs can be put on the shoulders of an outsourcing partner.
 Management costs: No matter who does the project, internal resources
play a critical role in program and project management. If it’s out-
sourced, you will require 45–60 percent fewer resources than if the
entire project were deployed internally.
The four cost categories should be detailed over a five-year period, which
accounts for your expansion as the technology matures and the time value of
money (your corporate WACC that I mention earlier in this chapter).
Performance anxiety: Can you 
build a network that works?
The third and final criterion for deciding on an outsourcing option is whether
someone can do it better than you can. Although RFID is not a new technol-
ogy, today’s RFID and EPC systems are new applications of the technology.
The emergent nature of the RFID market means that not a lot of experienced
people are available for companies to hire internally. Many companies that
were lucky enough to have internal RFID experience have seen their experts
leave to start RFID-specific consultancies because their knowledge is so valu-
able in today’s marketplace. The lack of experience, coupled with the early
stage of products, has created a distinct performance advantage for people
with extensive RFID experience, specifically as it relates to today’s RFID read-
ers, antennas, and tags.
The handful of RFID-specific companies that have been around since the
early 2000s clearly have a significant advantage over firms started in 2004
and 2005. The older companies have experience with the hardware and with
actual deployments. The top companies have leveraged that experience to
317
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

create a scientific methodology as opposed to trial and error. With these
advantages, such companies can easily cut the deployment time in half and
greatly increase the performance of your network.
It is important to have an advantage in time and performance if you are under
an early mandate and have a short timeline to adopt RFID. If you’re not
required to have something up and running but are investigating RFID
because you feel it will be a strategic advantage or necessity in the near
future, you might not need the expertise of an experienced RFID expert
because working with RFID will only get easier.
The bottom line of the performance issue is that if time is a factor, you will
not be able to get up to speed quickly enough internally. And if you are trying
to get away with a minimalist slap-and-ship system, when you do evolve into
a pervasive RFID network, your design and ongoing maintenance costs will be
significantly higher because you did not start with the end goal in mind.
Finding the Perfect Match
If you’re planning to outsource your RFID network, two factors will make or
break your future:
 The partner you choose
 Your internal level of knowledge and how well you keep up with the
technology
Pay special attention to note the word partner: An outsourcing relationship
should go beyond a typical vendor/client affiliation. The RFID network, when
fully integrated into your business process, has the potential to completely
grind shipping and production to a halt if something goes awry. If you are
relying on an outsourcing partner to make sure that your RFID network is
healthy, trusting the right one is critical.
Unfortunately, matchmaker.com doesn’t have a section for RFID mates, but
the following sections can help.
Figuring out the RFP process
You find a vendor by creating a request for proposal (RFP). This can be an
arduous process, but it’s worth the trouble in order to develop the right rela-
tionship with the right partner. The following steps outline how the RFP
process works:
318
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

1. Work with internal staff and possibly a consultant to gather the infor-
mation about your business and your needs so that you can put
together a detailed RFP.
The data-gathering and discovery process that your RFID team has gone
through will help you glean a much better understanding of your corpo-
rate strengths and weaknesses relating to preparedness for an RFID 
network.
If you’ve already worked through the questions in the previous section,
“Is Outsourcing Right for You?,” you’ve done much of the work already. If
not, see that section for details.
Map out the various stages of the business process on large sheets of
paper where you can identify the locations of RFID interrogation zones
and where business processes might be changed. (Chapter 6 talks about
locations where you might put an RFID reader or interrogation zone.)
These maps are very helpful as you try to understand the long-term impli-
cations of the system. This process mapping can be seen in Figure 17-2. A
process map is a great visual foundation for an RFP.
2. Create a detailed RFP.
When you create the RFP, you put all the details that you’ve collected
about your needs and how much or how little you expect the partner to
do. By spelling out all these details, you’re much more likely to find a part-
ner that can meet those needs — and thus have a successful relationship.

3. Send the RFP to several different kinds of service providers.
I offer tips about this later in this chapter. The Web sites in Chapter 19
can also help you find reputable companies.
4. Evaluate the proposals that vendors send you.
In the next few sections, I explain what happens each step of the way.
Spelling out your needs in an RFP
The RFP should focus on both long- and short-term requirements so that
your partner can design a system from the start that will scale as your RFID
requirements grow. Table 17-1 offers a sketch of the components you need to
include, in the order you likely want to include them.
Table 17-1
Putting Together an RFP
Component
What It’s For
Organizational Overview
This helps vendors understand who will be involved
and where the focus is in the organization.
Required Deliverables
This is the meat of your RFP, where you outline tech-
nology requirements, monitoring and performance
management, support, and deployment locations.
Required Proposal Format
Making sure you hold vendors to the same format
makes an apples-to-apples comparison easier on
you, and also helps you determine which vendors
listen to your requests.
Request for References
A critical component to see who is full of marketing
fluff and who has actually done the work for real
paying clients. Check these thoroughly.
Mutual NDA 
You want legal protection as you share details about 
(nondisclosure agreement)
your business and ask potential partners to share
details about theirs.
Submission deadline
Set a reasonable deadline for submissions and hold
to it. Then give accurate expectations to the vendors,
when there will be a short list notification, and when
finalists will come in for oral presentations.
In the following sections, I explain the more complex components of the RFP
in more detail.
320
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Technology requirements
If the cost is the potatoes of an RFP, the technology is the meat. Technology
drives many of the other considerations, from selection to timing. Because
many of the specific technology components are covered in other places in
this book, I’ll give you just a few reminders for the various parts that make up
the technology section of an RFP:
 Product testing: What are the methodology and processes used to test
for optimal tags and tag placement on your products being tagged? There
should be a demonstrable use of scientific method and not just trial and
error. Ask to see examples of past reports as an appendix. Detail your
total number of products and how many you plan on tagging or testing. I
talk about testing the products for the right tags and placement in
Chapter 9.
 Site assessment(s): Make sure that a Full Faraday Cycle Analysis (see
Chapter 7 for details) is part of the evaluation. Ask to see examples of
past site assessments and see whether there is information that the
deployment team can use to help configure and tune the various hard-
ware. An RF path loss contour map (see Chapter 7) is usually used as a
design foundation.
 Hardware selection: Because there is no silver bullet for RFID, ask
whether the firms have experience with multiple hardware vendors so
that they can provide the best hardware for a specific location within
your RFID network. Ask what relationships the outsourcer has with vari-
ous hardware manufacturers; make sure that they have four or five com-
panies to choose from and also that the outsourcer has multiple
engineers certified through the various hardware products.
 Network design: This is critical for long-term success and for minimizing
ongoing maintenance costs. The RFID network should be designed with
a three-year time horizon in mind. In other words, what do you envision
the network looking like in three years? Today, it might have only one or
two readers set up, but you need to look to the future to figure out the
long-term vision. Key consideration should be given to understanding
communication needs such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, RS-485, and others.
 Hardware testing and certification: Because RFID readers and antenna
production is in limited quantities today, quality control isn’t at the level
of a mature industry. Therefore, ask the outsourcer to test every reader
in a controlled environment to ensure integrity of the RF signal compli-
ance with the rules of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
The vendor should be willing to sign off on accuracy of testing to protect
you from any liability associated with FCC compliance. See Chapter 8 for
details on testing.
321
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

 Hardware installation and on-site testing: Installing the readers is
tougher than most people think. The installation has to be flexible
enough to allow design and configuration flexibility yet durable enough
to withstand an industrial environment. Does the company make or have
access to well-designed RFID racks and enclosures? Ask to see pho-
tographs of recent installations.
 Software requirements: Chapter 11 details the middleware aspect of an
RFID system, but asking for successful deployment references is critical. I
once worked with a leading middleware company for six months with its
“mature” product and still couldn’t get it to work on the network that our
client designed. Demos and the real world are as different as night and
day. If a single outsource partner is going to handle physics, network
design, and middleware, that partner is likely to use someone else’s mid-
dleware. In response to the RFP, the partner might use the middleware
company’s installations as its own proven references. Find out what the
partner has done directly as well as how many people in the organization
are trained on the middleware that the partner will likely use.
 Forward compatibility: This is something many people focus on but few
address in an RFP. A key benefit of outsourcing is that someone else
shoulders the risk of technology obsolescence. Your RFP must clarify
that if the protocols, standards, or technology changes, your partner will
be responsible for making those changes to keep you up-to-date. This
will guarantee that your potential partner isn’t buying older hardware,
which might not be forward compatible.
 Security issues: Depending on your product and environment, security
can be a vital part of your decision. Consider the two forms of security:
• Technical security takes into consideration how things are
encrypted and password-protected.
• Operation security deals with the people. Look for a company that
does background checks on all employees and ask for the name of
the firm that performs the investigations if security is a genuine
concern.
The best proxy for in-depth due diligence is to find out whether the com-
pany has a U.S. government security clearance.
The gold seal of approval from a security perspective is if the company
has a U.S. Federal Facilities Clearance. If so, the company should have a
dedicated facilities security officer (FSO). Ask for the name of that person
and call the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) at
1-888-282-7682 to verify for yourself whether that person is in fact the FSO.
Monitoring and performance management
Monitoring the health and welfare of your RFID network becomes increas-
ingly important as the network expands and its importance to your business
process and decision-making increases. Outsourcing can give you better
access to the latest and greatest monitoring software. The performance 
322
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

monitoring is a critical part of the service level agreement (SLA, which I dis-
cuss later in this chapter). Make sure that when you put together your RFP,
you spell out the expectations of the SLA.
The level of monitoring and performance you require depends on the impor-
tance of your RFID system. If many of your outbound shipments require RFID
tags, make sure that you have a system that is up and running during your
normal production hours.
Up and running is a fuzzy phrase that can be defined in many ways. Chapter
14 details the best methods for monitoring a system. However, be keenly
aware of measuring performance instead of just measuring aliveness. If your
RFID network is critical to your business and you face penalties or nonpay-
ment for not having a valid RFID tag on each case, demand an SLA that sup-
ports at least 99 percent availability and notification within 15 minutes of any
issue. The RFP must clarify that any vendors will be required to provide a 99-
percent uptime level of service and will be expected to sign an SLA to enforce
penalties for nonperformance.
Technical support
Before you decide to let your precious RFID network into the hands of
another, you need to be assured that it will be taken good care of when some-
thing goes wrong. The support section of an RFP should be detailed and 
comprehensive.
From a support perspective, most IT projects benefit from having one throat
to choke — or as I like to say, one back to pat. This means that you should be
able to call a dedicated toll-free number if an issue arises. This is especially
important if you are not outsourcing performance monitoring and manage-
ment, which is by definition a reactive approach — that is, you have to wait
until something breaks and then decide how to react to it.
Support provided by the vendor should include
 Access to a toll-free (800) customer support number that is available
during your hours of operation (a single 8-hour shift or 24/7), regardless
of your or the outsourcing partner’s location. For outsourcing vendors
located outside the United States, make sure that support lines include
support in the language of your operations team.
 E-mail access to customer support.
 Scheduled maintenance windows that are outside your critical busi-
ness hours. Ask vendors to conduct system patches, upgrades, and fixes
during the scheduled window — unless there are security or system
risks, defined as Level 1 problems (see the upcoming Table 17-2).
 Support for all application software, including diagnostic services and
software patches.
323
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

 Support for system hardware, including diagnostic services and hard-
ware vendor contact assistance.
 Support for any third-party software, including diagnostic services,
software vendor contact assistance, and software patches.
Other support features that you might want your outsourcing partner to pro-
vide include
 The ability to catalog a knowledge base of resolutions for historical
reference: This can be a great resource that you can keep on hand
rather than having to wait for a response from support.
 Monthly call reports: Your outsourcing partner might send these out
electronically or make them available over the Web. The reports give
you the opportunity to review the call history for proactive management
of issues.
 A list of several groups and their associated roles: Typically, the four
groups available in customer support are system engineers, database
administrators, performance analysts, and project engineers. Within these
groups, individuals are sometimes divided into various tiers depending on
skill level (tier 1 being a trained call center person, up to a tier 3 individual
who might actually work on the systems in deployment or development).
 A Web-based portal: Some of the larger outsourcing firms make
resources available via a Web-based portal so that you can get to infor-
mation about your RFID network (such as trouble tickets and perfor-
mance metrics) anytime you want.
Even if a Web portal isn’t available, find out what the outsourcing com-
pany’s trouble-ticket or issue-tracking system looks like. It doesn’t have
to be an expensive brand-name system like Siebel, but it does have to
easily track the status of a specific case by trouble ticket number, quickly
add information to an existing case, and automatically escalate a problem
if it’s not solved in a certain amount of time.
Deployment location(s)
The RFP needs to include all locations contemplated for the initial and long-
term deployment. A company will price the first piece of business much more
favorably if it knows that it will deploy several more of the exact same sys-
tems in the near future.
Spelling out all your locations not only gives you better pricing, but also helps
your prospective vendors understand potential support issues associated
with varying time zones, different languages, and likely communication con-
straints. This also helps them to accurately gauge travel expenses and
response time to remediate support issues.
324
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Experience and references
Experience and reference customers are the key to seeing how successful the
outsource partner has been in real-world environments. This is the make-or-
break section of your RFP. Be sure to ask a potential outsourcing partner for
references. You also want the company to provide details about its RFID
experience.
Many an outsourcing provider will claim that all its clients are covered by
nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). Although this is certainly true in many
instances, at least one or two customers should be able to talk about the
vendor’s ability to provide a service. Beware of a company that doesn’t want
to provide references.
To assess the quality of an outsourcing partner, ask for details about the
senior leaders in the organization as well as the people who will be working
directly on your project. With RFID getting so much press, a lot of opportun
istic people have started RFID firms. To get a good idea of whether an out-
sourcing vendor is worth your time and money, I recommend asking the 
following questions:
 How long have key personnel been working with RFID? The best firms
have key personnel who have been in the business for decades, not
months. Look for chief scientists, VPs of engineering, and similar-level
positions to be held by people who have spent years with different
radio-frequency systems.
 Where did they get that experience? Many great practitioners have
come out of various government programs like NASA, think tanks like
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory or the MIT
Auto-ID Center, or specific educational programs like the Case Western
Physics Entrepreneurship Program. Also, several companies have a his-
tory in radio frequency — Texas Instruments, Motorola, Intermec, and
others — which are good breeding grounds for RF experiences.
 What does the company do besides make money? This is the touchy-
feely stuff that really does matter. Good people make good companies.
Asking this question in the RFP can give you some insight into how
Machiavellian a partner might be when dealing with you. Look for 
firms that are involved with standards bodies like the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), EPCglobal working groups, or other such bodies. Also,
companies that participate in associations and industry groups are
likely to be better connected and more on the pulse of the technology.
Lastly, if a company believes in taking care of all the stakeholders in its
area, whether by supporting local charities or by giving employees time
off to volunteer, it usually means that senior management values things
other than how high they can drive their stock price.
325
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

Selecting potential outsourcing partners
After you craft and then review your RFP to make sure it’s ready to send out,
you have to decide where to send it. The Web sites in Chapter 19 can help
you find specific companies. I recommend sending it to at least four or five
vendors; look at the big global firms as well as the small specialty shops.
Here, I offer more general advice:
 Know what to expect from small companies versus big companies.
Keep in mind that large companies need large contracts to pay the large
bills. IBM and Accenture have much greater overhead and administra-
tion costs than ODIN technologies or OATSystems. Therefore, the larger
companies are more likely to provide a higher level of service to the
clients who have contracted for multimillion-dollar deployments. A
$200,000 contract will not have any effect on the bottom line of a com-
pany like IBM, so expect its account managers to try and increase the
margin on smaller customers by charging for service calls, increasing
maintenance contracts, and other nickel-and-dime items. Another way
these big companies can justify taking on a small customer is to develop
a product for your deployment that they can reuse with other clients.
The small company/big company decision is largely a function of your
need to get personalized service and specific experience balanced with
your desire to have a company that is well recognized and financially
significant. Either way, reference customers hold the key to unlocking
the true service capability of the vendor.
 Find out who is backing the company. There are several types of compa-
nies in the RFID space today. Examining who makes up the company and
the board of directors is a good way to get insight into the goals of the
company. Look for firms that are made up of passionate RFID experts —
people who might have left large, stable companies to start their own
companies.
If you see a lot of venture capitalists and if the company was started
post-2003, it is likely comprised of opportunistic types looking for a 
profitable and fast exit. Such a company might not exist in a year or two.
The situation is similar to the many data-hosting companies started in
the late 1990s: These companies provided great customer service and
responsiveness, but as soon as they were sold to large conglomerates,
the service and innovation immediately degraded.
 Consider where RFID fits in terms of strategic importance and what
else the company might be doing in addition to RFID. Nobody ever got
fired for hiring Big Blue, but the RFID team lives somewhere down at the
bottom of the pecking order, after data hosting, blade servers, storage
systems, strategic consulting . . . well, you get the idea.
326
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Evaluating responses to your RFP
After you send out your RFP, companies that are interested in providing you
with services will respond with varying levels of detail by providing you a
proposal and cost breakdown. When you send out your RFP, remember to put
a deadline on the responses and then hold to that deadline. After all, if a com-
pany can’t keep to a reasonable deadline for an RFP response, how will it get
your project finished on time?
Here are some tips that can help you separate the good responses from the
bad:
 No references, no deal. If you get an RFP response back that doesn’t list
reference customers and contact names (assuming that you asked for
them), don’t bother looking at the rest of the proposal. Eliminate the
firm from your consideration unless you want someone learning RFID on
your dime.
 Come up with the cash. Always remember that companies have to be
self-sustaining. It is perfectly acceptable for a company to make a rea-
sonable profit and be able to pay their employees a fair wage.
 Scrutinize lowball bids. If you get a proposal back that is significantly
lower than the rest, the company is either exhibiting bad business and
might not be around in the near future, or it plans on sticking precisely
to the letter of the RFP and charging you extra for every minor change in
scope. Most IT professionals have learned the hard way that when Big
Company offers something for free, that same Big Company makes it up
(and then some) in other services. Watch out for this!
Sealing the Deal with an SLA
After you find an outsourcing partner you want to work with, you’re ready to
move on to the service level agreement (SLA), which clarifies to both parties
exactly what services will be provided and what penalties will be assessed
for noncompliance.
An outsourcing partner can be your knight in shining armor if you need to
meet a compliance deadline. But making sure that you take the time and
effort to lift up the visor and see what’s under the armor is your key to being
happy with the relationship. Creating a sound RFP will evolve into the foun-
dation for an accurate SLA.
327
Chapter 17: What to Look for When Considering Outsourcing

The SLA is the legal agreement that makes your partner sign on to all the things
promised in the response back from the RFP. In other words, if the outsource
partner claims 24/7 support in its RFP response, the SLA needs to spell out the
penalties the partner will pay if you cannot actually get service 24/7.
To get to an effective SLA, follow these steps:
1. List any metrics included in the RFP.
Metrics are simply items in your RFP that are measurable and concrete,
including time to respond to trouble tickets, definition of problem sever-
ity, e-mail or phone call acknowledgement of problems, and so forth.
2. Rank the order of importance of those metrics from most important to
least important.
3. Work with the finance and RFID team to figure out the effect of not
achieving the desired levels on the various metrics.
In other words, if the RFID network goes down and no cases are being
tagged and read, would you stop production or shipping? Would you be
charged a penalty from your customer? If the answer is yes, what does it
cost for every minute the production line is shut down, or how much of
a penalty will your customer charge you?
4. Take the costs of nonperformance and put them into contractual lan-
guage so that your provider absorbs those costs if the SLAs are not met.
5. Negotiate the SLA with the outsourcing provider.
Many outsourcing providers have a standard SLA. You can ask them to
send that back in their response to your RFP so you could see what they
are really willing to commit to versus what they say in their marketing
and sales pitches.
Drafting the initial SLA
The service level agreement sets the objectives and understanding of the
partnership. When you are outsourcing a key infrastructure component, it
really is a partnership — and like any partnership, you want to know what to
expect during the good times as well as the bad. After all, Shrek is about the
only one I know who was happy that the beautiful princess turned into an
ogre at midnight.
The implementation/deployment phase of the contract (to meet a deadline)
uses different metrics than the on-going performance and monitoring (after
you’re up and running). I suggest splitting the two phases into two separate
SLAs with specific penalties for failure.
328
Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Here’s what your SLA needs to accomplish:
 Set service-level benchmarks. In order to obtain the best service possi-
ble, keep in mind that you aren’t buying capacity or technology but
rather a service level. This means that you need a good understanding
of performance measures and metrics.
 Ensure good service with penalties. The best SLAs have significant
penalties for noncompliance to make sure that your outsourcing partner
takes the commitment to heart. SLAs that have no teeth offer very high
service levels and response time guarantees, yet no penalty for 
noncompliance.
Here are some tips for setting the right service levels:
• Use the same metrics for performance measures that you used in
the RFP’s technical section (read accuracy and response time, for
example).
• A good performance measure is a service that’s better than you
can do yourself or are getting now. For example, one of your per-
formance measures might be getting a 95-percent read success on
all outbound cases. For not meeting that performance level, you
might give them ten business days to fix it; and if they don’t fix it,
you may ask for a $5,000 penalty for each failure. This also
assumes that you are going to pay your outsourcer for a full main-
tenance contract to support this kind of service level.
• Make sure that the vendor’s performance is aligned with your
needs as an organization. Always keep the big picture in mind
when working through the details of an SLA. If your business goal
is better performance or technical advantage, your SLA should
also include incentives to encourage the vendor to meet those
goals.
 Ensure that your outsourcing provider creates and maintains back-up
files of your reader configuration and version. The configuration of
each reader is a valuable piece of information that your service provider
should store in a secure database that includes weekly tape back-ups in
case the server crashes.
If the SLA correctly scopes out the expectations of services, you should not
see any creep in the project costs.
When you articulate your support requirements, it is reasonable to expect
that the outsourcing company will offer different SLAs based on the severity
of the problem. Normally, problems are broken into three or four levels of
severity, which are outlined in Table 17-2. Note that you receive notification
only if performance monitoring is outsourced.

Part V: How to Speak Bean Counter 

Many firms, particularly those with large consulting arms, purposefully make
these components vague so that they can either sell additional services and
consulting or use the SLA as a lever to upgrade services and increase their
revenues. This happens fairly often with low bidders in the RFP process, par-
ticularly if they are big consulting or technology companies.
Negotiating an SLA with a vendor
After your team has sorted out the various RFP responses and put some met-
rics into a format for measuring performance and compliance, you are ready
to start the negotiating process.
First, you need to assemble your negotiating team. If your company has a
procurement expert, this is the time to get him or her involved. If not, legal
counsel is usually helpful — but plan on taking a week or two for legal review.
The members of your RFID team are also critical at the negotiating table
because they understand the core requirements from a technical, operations,
and business process perspective.
Smart vendors find as many contact points within an organization as possi-
ble, always working back channels for more information or to determine who
is making decisions. You can avoid this potentially confusing covert informa-
tion gathering by asking your team members to direct all inquiries from ven-
dors to the main point of contact in your firm. Also keep in mind that you
need to share as much information in the RFP as possible so that the poten-
tial vendors don’t have to covertly gather information. I never understand
why people are reluctant to share information when looking for a solution.
After all, you wouldn’t ask your doctor to guess what your symptoms are. A
technology partner needs to make the right diagnosis as well, so share all
you can — just make sure you’re protected under an NDA.
As you negotiate the contract and SLA, prioritize what the must-have compo-
nents are for you and try to separate them from the nice-to-haves. Then put
yourself in the vendor’s shoes. You find out plenty about your vendor from
the RFP process, so what do you think costs the most amount of time, money,
and effort? What things are relatively easy for the vendor to do? Don’t be
afraid to ask these questions directly. The answers are your levers in the
negotiation phases. Understanding what you need and what your vendor can
provide relatively easily will help you both achieve a win-win outcome. An
SLA negotiation should be the beginning of a great partnership, not the terri-
torial battle some lawyers like to make it. It is better to be cooperative than
adversarial.
A collaborative negotiating stance will ensure that the SLA is achievable and
enforceable. Sharing enough information for the vendors to make an ade-
quate decision is also critical.

W
hen you’re looking for a partner or trying to get started with a tech-
nology, the toughest part is often either getting hold of the gear, par-
ticularly tags, or finding someone who is reputable. In this chapter, I show
you some of the more reputable equipment companies and offer a bit of
street knowledge about each one.
If you work with a vendor and don’t get good service from the start, go to
someone else as soon as possible. The companies best able to keep their cus-
tomers happy are the ones with staying power. When you order hardware,
tags, or services, demand a written service level agreement (SLA) with penal-
ties for noncompliance. Although Chapter 17 focuses on outsourcing, many
of the guidelines for finding a good outsourcing partner apply to RFID equip-
ment vendors, too.
Alien Technology
Alien Technology Corporation, 18220 Butterfield Blvd., Morgan Hill, CA
95037; www.alientechnology.com; phone 408-782-3900
Alien is one of the leading companies in the passive RFID space. With signifi-
cant venture capital funding, it has done an excellent job of marketing itself
and achieving early market share. Alien hopes to be the premier provider of
low-cost UHF (ultrahigh frequency) tags by using a manufacturing process
called Fluidic Self Assembly to keep tag cost as low as possible. Alien was the
original standard for Generation 1.0 EPC Class 1 tags. Its readers provide a
wide range of options, from industrial readers for the supply chain to com-
pact reader engines suited for hand-helds and printers. Many printer and
hand-held manufacturers use Alien’s reader board in their products.

Word on the street: Alien has the cheapest tags and the fastest order time on
readers; however, its customer service and support model needs an overhaul.
One issue is that Alien requires new customers to attend Alien academy — at
a cost of $5,000 including a development kit — before they can get customer
support.
ACCU-SORT
ACCU-SORT Systems, Inc., 2800 Crystal Dr., Hatfield, PA 19440; 
www.accusort.com; phone 215-723-0981
For more than 30 years, ACCU-SORT has specialized in automatic identifica-
tion technology, including barcode scanners vision systems. Recently, it has
moved into RFID technologies.
The people at ACCU-SORT are print-and-apply specialists creating devices to
print machine-readable information (like bar codes) on a label and applying it
at high speeds. Their goal is to help clients streamline operations by manag-
ing materials and understanding data. They do not make RFID readers or tags;
rather, they take other companies’ hardware and incorporate it into their
industrial equipment. The ACCU-SORT’s FAST Tag RFID system incorporates
barcode scanning, RFID labeling, RFID tag reading/writing, controls, and data
management, including communications with the client’s warehouse manage-
ment system (WMS) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Word on the street: The company is building credible expertise around RFID
and dedicating specific resources. They have a mobile solution that is perfect
for most tag-and-ship types of solutions that take place in the warehouse.
This mobile solution also includes control software, eliminating the need for
a dedicated middleware piece. However, its control system, FAST Tag, is pro-
prietary and works optimally as part of the total ACCU-SORT solution. If
you’re already an ACCU-SORT client, this isn’t an issue. If you aren’t, it
appears you need to buy the whole system to get the maximum benefit.
Applied Wireless Identifications (AWID)
Applied Wireless Identifications Group, Inc., 382 Route 59, Section 292,
Monsey, NY 10952; www.awid.com; phone 845-369-8800
Applied Wireless Identifications, or AWID, has been in the wireless identifica-
tion business since 1997. The initial focus was proximity cards for security
systems and access control. In the early 2000s, Jeff Jacobsen, the former CEO
of Alien Technologies, was hired as its new president. Since then, AWID
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

moved to create an agile reader specifically for Wal-Mart suppliers. In early
2003, it released a self-contained very simple reader/antenna combination at
a low price point. It has added power over Ethernet (PoE) (see Chapter 9 for
details) and brought the lowest price on the market to the reader antenna
combination.
Word on the street: AWID started off with a technology lead when Wal-Mart
first released its mandate; however, it spent much of 2003–2004 toying with
venture capitalists and lost its technology dominance and market position. It
has a reader/antenna combination now at a street price of around $500, and
can add additional antennas to make it even more attractive. AWID’s funding
indecision, however, has put it a step behind the other key providers. They
are now trying to get back on their track of innovation.
FOX IV Technologies
FOX IV Technologies, Inc., 6011 Enterprise Dr., Export, PA 98203;
www.foxiv.com; phone 724-387-3500
FOX IV has focused its print-and-apply systems on tough environments over
the last 20 years. As a niche player, it has put smart engineers and designers
to work solving challenging problems. To FOX IV, RFID is just another challeng-
ing problem. It was the first print-and-apply company to pass EPCglobal’s cer-
tification for Class 1 and Class 0 tags in August of 2004.
Word on the street: FOX IV Technologies has proven itself to be a leader in
tough situations and has taken some interesting approaches to the print-and-
apply business. It tends to be more expensive than other print-and-apply 
vendors, however.
Impinj
Impinj, Inc., 501 N. 34th St., Seattle, WA 98103; www.impinj.com; phone
206-517-5300
Impinj is a highly innovative, venture-backed company that began life as a
chip maker with innovative design. The folks at Impinj had a solution looking
for a problem — RFID was made for them. They are providing integrated cir-
cuits (ICs) or chips for tag readers and also producing their own tags. Their
competitive differentiation is the ability to power up a chip and backscatter 
a signal using lower power than traditional RFID tags. This makes the tags
337
Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) Equipment Vendors

easier to read and helps create better-designed RFID networks because less
reader power means fewer opportunities for RF noise. In addition, the Impinj
engineers are designing readers for the generation 2.0 EPC protocol, which
also keeps to their standard of innovation.
Word on the street: Impinj has a very talented and focused team, with strong
partnerships among antenna and label manufacturers. Although their innova-
tions have increased tag performance, the question is whether their prices
will be competitive and whether this small company can keep up with produc-
tion volume. The craftsmanship and price tag of a Ferrari will never be like an
Oldsmobile, after all.
Intermec Technologies
Intermec Technologies Corporation, 6001 36th Ave. West, Everett, WA
98203; www.intermec.com; phone 425-348-2600
Intermec has been active in automatic identification technology (AIT) for
decades. It has a significant embedded client base that uses its barcode tech-
nology. It also has a proprietary RFID system and is moving toward compli-
ance with EPC and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) open
standards, but has been slow to do so. Intermec claims existing deployments
of RFID with manufacturing, food processing, security, and logistics in the
United States; retail and logistics in Europe; biohazard waste management in
Africa; and transportation systems in Japan. Intermec’s UHF readers and tag
systems are certified for operation in the United States at 915 MHz and 2.45
GHz, in Europe at 869 MHz (meeting narrowband requirements), and in Japan
at 2.45 GHz.
Word on the street: When IBM decided to get out of RFID several years ago,
Intermec purchased IBM’s RFID intellectual property. Consequently, Intermec
owns patents on everything from tag design to testing equipment. The com-
pany sat on the sidelines until the market matured before beginning to flex
those patents. Intermec royalty demands were also partially responsible for
slowing the process of an EPC protocol standard design. Thankfully they
have not claimed royalty requirement for Gen 2.0 tags, but are indicating that
they would require a royalty on Gen 2.0 reader design. Intermec’s focus on
previously developed intellectual property has left it behind the curve in
terms of performance and capabilities in today’s competitive marketplace,
but their ownership of intellectual property has given them a strong lever to
acquire or license other vendors’ technologies. They should emerge a formi-
dable provider in early 2006.

MARKEM
MARKEM Corporation, 150 Congress St., Keene, NH 03431;
www.markem.com; phone 603-352-1130
MARKEM, a marking technology company, has been in business for nearly
100 years. In late 2003, its scientists began experimenting with adapting their
existing print-and-apply solutions to RFID. They have developed several inno-
vative solutions centered around print-and-apply at line production speeds.
Word on the street: MARKEM has allocated some of its top technical staff to
the problem of applying and encoding RFID tags at line speed. Although the
volume and scale of their production is unknown, the early indications of 
performance are quite strong.
Symbol Technologies, Inc. 
(Formerly Matrics)
Symbol Technologies, One Symbol Plaza, Holtsville, NY 11742-1300;
www.symbol.com; phone 1-866-416-8545
Before its acquisition by Symbol Technologies in mid-2004, Matrics began as
an aggressive, venture-backed company with technology borne out of scien-
tists from the National Security Administration (NSA). It designs and manu-
factures EPC-compliant RFID readers and tags, focused on a proprietary Class
0 protocol. It has patented a unique approach to assembling tags (known as
PICA) that will increase tag output and reduce overall cost, including using a
very fast-drying, inexpensive adhesive.
Word on the street: The Matrics/Symbol agile reader is clearly one of the
best readers out there. However, in 2004, some orders took up to eight weeks
to process because of issues with ramping up the contract manufacturing
house. Matrics/Symbol’s AR-400 was the reader that Wal-Mart used in the first
phase of its RFID deployment in 2004. Matrics/Symbol tags, although only
Class 0, are well-designed, but large (giving better performance but less useful
placement options) and relatively more expensive than competitors’ tags. All
in all, these tags are a great choice for closed-loop systems, which explains
their great success with airport luggage systems. With Symbol purchasing
Matrics, look for the company to provide integrated bar code and RFID sys-
tems and be quickly compliant with Gen 2.0 solutions.

ODIN technologies
ODIN technologies; 12120 Sunset Hills Rd., Suite 410; Reston, VA 20190;
www.odintechnologies.com; phone 866-652-3052
ODIN technologies is the leading provider of specialized software and services
for the RFID infrastructure. Starting with expertise from MIT’s Auto-ID center
and growing over the years with experienced physicists and RF engineers,
ODIN has developed novel software to make the testing, deployment, and
management of RFID networks highly successful. ODIN technologies was the
first company to release software based on sound scientific methodologies
for testing tag selection and placement. It has also created a system to design
full RFID networks called FAS-D, the fully automated system design.
Because ODIN has had a background in the physics of RFID for many years, 
it’s uniquely qualified to understand how to manage, monitor and keep RFID
networks healthy. ODIN has the first monitoring and management system in the
RFID industry which actually looks at tag read performance over time, using
artificial intelligence, machine learning, and fuzzy logic in a patent-pending
solution designed for keeping RFID networks up and working properly 24/7 in
even the most remote locations.
Word on the street: ODIN technologies has worked with more of the Wal-Mart,
Target, and Department of Defense clients than any other firm in the market-
place on infrastructure testing, deployment, and monitoring. ODIN has a solid
reputation for deploying 100-percent accurate solutions and is often the exper-
tise behind many of the large consulting firms’ efforts (who subcontract their
work to ODIN). Its software products to test tags and monitor systems are the
only ones on the market taking into account the complex physics of RFID,
and are based on years of experience in the RFID space. ODIN also makes
inexpensive and well-engineered RFID racks.
OMRON electronics
OMRON Regional Management Center; One East Commerce Drive,
Schaumburg, IL 60173; www.omron.com; phone 847-884-0322
OMRON USA is a several hundred million dollar subsidiary of Japanese manu-
facturing automation giant OMRON — a $3 billion company. The company is
well known for its manufacturing automation and control devices, ranging
from optical label readers to high-speed fill-verification devices. OMRON has
been creating RFID devices, mostly in high frequency (HF), for more than a
decade and understands the physics of RF systems quite well.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

OMRON is using its deep knowledge of industrial automation to develop cut-
ting edge RFID solutions. The people in the U.S. division are spearheading the
RFID efforts for the global organization. They have recently introduced UHF
tags, readers, and antennas — all with proprietary technology and well
researched design.
Word on the street: OMRON started its reader strategy by licensing the
firmware and basic design from ThingMagic. Before production, it revamped
the inner working of the reader and beefed up the components, creating an
immediately optimized reader. OMRON’s R&D division in Japan has also cre-
ated very successful reader antennas and RFID tag designs and is looking to
release its own reader design in 2005. The tag designs have a novel chip attach-
ment process, using a crimping technology instead of adhesive, creating a
much more durable tag. With support around the globe, a CEO who has taken
personal interest in the RFID program, and great engineering with years of HF
RFID experience, OMRON is a serious force to be reckoned with in the RFID
marketplace.
SAMSys Technologies
SAMSys Technologies Inc., 2525 Meridian Parkway, Durham, NC 27713;
www.samsys.com; phone 1-888-483-6646
A pioneer in multiprotocol, multifrequency readers, SAMSys has historically
designed and deployed passive RFID readers (low frequency [LF], high fre-
quency [HF], and ultrahigh frequency [UHF]) that support EPCglobal standards
and other tag protocols and frequencies. Its innovative design flexibility has
won significant contracts with both U.S. and European providers. SAMSys
does not manufacture tags and has limited services, so all of its effort goes
into making the best reader hardware possible.
Word on the street: For multiprotocol control and flexibility of data manipu-
lation, the SAMSys reader is tough to beat. A savvy programmer can make the
SAMSys reader work quicker and better than its competitors. However, the
quality of the radio is slightly lower than some of the other readers, so if pure
distance is an issue, SAMSys may lose out. It is also the most expensive
reader on the market.
Texas Instruments (TI)
Texas Instruments Incorporated, 6550 Chase Oaks Blvd. Ms8470, Plano,
TX 75023; www.ti.com/rfid; phone 1-888-937-6536
341
Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) Equipment Vendors

TI brands its RFID group, not surprisingly, TI-RFid (Texas Instruments Radio
Frequency Identification Solutions). This group has significant experience in
LF and HF and waited for the protocol dust to settle before venturing into
UHF, but now it is going after the tag market with a vengeance.
Word on the street: TI has some very smart RFID folks working for it. Several
of these folks have been involved with the various standards groups, which
means they understand the direction the protocols are going and have a
jump on designing the chips. TI will have some of the first Generation 2.0 tags
available and has experience in high-capacity production to make sure they
can meet demand. The only lingering question is whether TI will lose this
fight to another competitor the way it lost the battle for the calculator to HP.
With strong expertise in chips and RFID tags, TI is a good bet as an early
winner. If TI focuses on more nimble innovation and cannibalizing its own
products, it has a fighting chance to be a long-term winner.
ThingMagic
ThingMagic, 1 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142; www.thingmagic.com;
phone 617-758-4136
ThingMagic is a small engineering start-up that was formed through early
involvement with the Auto-ID Center at MIT. It was one of the first producers
of an agile reader, and the first to use an Intel architecture coupled with a
Linux core. Its latest reader, the Mercury IV, claims to be capable of reading
all classes of tags and readers and has solid connectivity and very flexible
controls and interfaces. Its top sales and marketing guy is Kevin Ashton, the
former Procter & Gamble executive who was on loan to the Auto-ID Center as
its Director and has been in the EPC space since it started.
Word on the street: ThingMagic has several very talented engineers and
designers; however, its production capability and channel strategy is confus-
ing to many end users. The good news for end users is that you can get the
benefit of ThingMagic’s technology but the reliable scalability and proven
service of a large organization by going to companies to whom it has licensed
technology. Tyco/ADT is one company with the basic ThingMagic design, or
you can get an even better designed reader with some of the best antennas
on the market and great global reach by going to OMRON, who also uses the
basic ThingMagic technology foundation. Also noteworthy is the fact that a
large independent reader manufacturer has licensed the technology as well.

Ten Web Sites for 
Information on RFID
In This Chapter
 Finding information — free and otherwise — about RFID online
 Consulting the consultants online
 Finding a vendor that’s right for you
 Getting the techno-babble straight from the techno-nerds
N
avigating the choppy waters of the RFID Sea is bound to get you listing
in your cubicle, so here are ten (or so) Web sites that will be your bal-
last. Keep in mind that this industry is changing quickly, new companies are
being formed, older companies are being acquired, new products are being
developed, protocols are evolving — well, you get the picture. The Internet
can be as much a source of confusion as a source of information, but the fol-
lowing sites are bound to help keep you informed and up-to-date.
If you are considering using a consultant or outsourced firm, these sites are
also a great way to keep them honest and assess their levels of knowledge. A
little research will help you develop questions to ask a potential consultant
and give you the ability to easily compare the answers with industry stan-
dards and expectations. If “trust but verify” worked during the Cold War, it
most certainly will work for your RFID deployment.

RFID Journal Online
www.rfidjournal.com
If something that is only a few years old can be called the granddaddy of an
industry, this is it. RFID Journal Online was started by Mark Roberti back in
2002, after a stint as managing editor of Internet Week. The site has all original
content; it does not simply republish press releases or link to other sites.
Some useful content about the RFID industry is always available. It is simple
to navigate, has easy-to-understand headlines, and gives solid information.
The only drawbacks are the amount of prime real estate given to ads and the
logo that doesn’t link back to the home page.
The RFID Journal Web site business model is a combination of successful
advertising-driven revenue (you will notice a good number of ads) and sub-
scription. Readers who choose not to subscribe can access the majority of
the site and still glean a lot of useful industry information; subscribers get
access to key feature articles and message boards. The journal also runs an
annual conference called RFID Journal Live, and sponsors seminars and edu-
cational series. All in all, it’s a great site for keeping up on the latest news in
the industry. In fact, it’s my home page at the office.
EPCglobal
www.epcglobalinc.org
The EPCglobal Web site is the “father” site to the regional EPC (electronic
product code) organizations, like EPC US. You can get all the information
about standards and technology at the site. However, much of the content is
available for members only. This is particularly true of emerging standards
and participation in workgroup-developed information. In order to browse
the members-only sections, you need to subscribe to EPCglobal, which ranges
from a few thousand dollars all the way up to $200,000, depending on the size
of your organization.
The site is simple and easy to use, and the section that features position
papers is particularly informative. The only ads you have to suffer through
are about EPCglobal-specific events or programs.
For an introduction to EPC and EPCglobal’s role in standards, see Chapter 2.

IDTechEx
www.idtechex.com
The IDTechEx is a United Kingdom site set up and run by a group of RF profes-
sionals who also do consulting and trade shows/conferences. There is a heavy
push to buy their products and services, particularly the research and white
papers. The site does a nice job, however, of giving a global picture to the RFID
world, and addresses issues that are often overlooked in the United States.
The company has an extensive database of RFID case studies that is accessi-
ble only to subscribers. Subscription is several thousand dollars, however.
The revenue model is subscription and sales of Web journals and studies. This
makes for easy navigation because there are no distracting advertisements.
RFID Solutions Online
www.rfidsolutionsonline.com
RFID Solutions Online is part of the VertMarkets group of sites. The Vert
people have spent the past five or six years refining how they offer sites that
help businesses connect with solutions providers. The site is divided into a
searchable vendor section and a general RFID information section. The
vendor section allows you to find specific companies to meet your needs and
to request a quote directly. The home page publishes vendor-developed Web
sites that you can download for free — in exchange for your contact informa-
tion. The site’s editors are selective on the content they publish, so the infor-
mation on the site is usually valuable, although sometimes it is a little on the
salesy side.
RFID Exchange
www.rfidexchange.com
The RFID exchange is a newer Web site that is taking a comprehensive
approach to data gathering. Like the IDTechEx site, it’s a tool used to drive
consulting business, but it doesn’t sell research or white papers; rather, the
site aggregates white papers and presentations from other sources. It has
many white papers on the basics of RFID.
345
Chapter 19: Ten Web Sites for Information on RFID

The site could benefit from a more professional design and usability
makeover. For instance, when looking for a vendor, you have to browse
through many Web pages, each of which contains only a handful of vendors
listed in alphabetical order.
RFID Update
www.rfidupdate.com
RFID Update is a very user-friendly aggregation of weekly RFID stories. It also
offers a subscription-based e-mail service. It has an active bulletin board and
marketplace called RFID Talk that has real-world user issues and information.
The site makes its revenue from advertisers and has a large banner ad at the
top of each page.
Auto-ID Labs
www.autoidlabs.org
The Auto-ID Labs’ archive section is the best source for early research into
the whole RFID/EPC movement. Here you can find great research papers and
primers on the technology. A lot of the stuff is outdated and not so useful
because the technology has changed so quickly, but some of the info is very
helpful. This is a dot-org site and has no sponsorship or distracting ads to
deal with.
Tom Scharfeld is currently part of the research team at Auto-ID Labs. He
wrote his master’s thesis at MIT on the physics principles of RFID specific to
passive tags. This thesis is a great technical document for those wishing to
understand more about the science of RFID. You can find it by searching for
“Scharfeld” in the archives.
Auto-ID Lab @ Adelaide
http://autoidlab.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/
The eccentric Peter Cole, probably the world’s foremost expert on radio fre-
quency identification, leads the University of Adelaide lab and he serves as
the research Director for the Auto-ID Lab in Australia. The scientists at Auto-ID
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Lab @ Adelaide have vast experience in the physics of RFID tags and readers
and the development of RFID protocols. Peter is largely responsible for the
EPC protocol and for helping the MIT team develop its technology.
The Resource section, where all sorts of good technical information is
hidden, is the most useful section on the site.
The RFID Gazette
www.rfidgazette.org
Hear ye, hear ye; The RFID Gazette is printing all the news that’s fit to be
printed. This well organized aggregation site is designed around specific
industry verticals — like pharmaceutical or automotive. Using more than
moveable type, this publication does a nice job of providing a simple, easy-to-
use interface for finding news articles specific to an area that may interest
you. The categories, which you find on the navigation bar on the left, range
from Privacy to Conferences. Another handy feature is the organization of
archive articles by month, which makes so it easy to go back and find things
you found interesting or worthwhile when you first read them. Although the
lack of original content may be a drawback, the organization of the informa-
tion is a plus.
UCLA’s RFID@WINMEC site
www.wireless.ucla.edu/rfid/research
The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) has spawned an academic
movement to challenge the electronic product code (EPC) created at MIT and
to create a new middleware component. The site is the brainchild of UCLA
professor Rajit Gadh. The content is minimal at this time, but it does hold 
the promise of an interesting alternative view of the RFID world. And there
are no ads!
Slashdot
www.slashdot.org
And last but not least, this chapter wouldn’t be worth its salt if it didn’t pay
homage to one of the greatest Web sites in the technology world: Slashdot.

feedback and quick summaries of the major headlines.
The only drawbacks to the site are that the ads take up too much prime real
estate on the right side of the screen, and there is no easy search location for
finding out the Slashdot opinion on things.

Ten Tips from the Experts
In This Chapter
 Learning tricks of the trade
 Saving time on deployments
You know the old rule: Never buy a car from the first model year it was
built. The idea is that a new car, from any company, is going to have a
number of kinks to work out, and the only way to identify those issues is real-
world usage. Prototyping and lab testing of a car will never tell you what a
two-year-old child can do to the control knobs in the back seat, or how a
bored English Setter can find entertainment in the cargo area, or that after
ten thousand miles, that cheaper seal for the brake lights wasn’t such a good
idea. I could go on forever about gripes I’ve had with first-run cars, but you
get the point. The same thing is true in an RFID system and network deploy-
ment. The first-run systems always have room for improvement.
In this chapter, I’ve collected what I think are the best tips out there from
people who know. The handful of folks in this chapter have been doing RFID
deployments for years and have made many mistakes and created some
interesting shortcuts. I always say it’s okay to learn from mistakes, as long 
as they are someone else’s. Here’s your chance to learn from other people’s
mistakes to make your RFID deployment easier, faster, and more effective.
Chris Fennig, ODIN technologies
Buy a spectrum analyzer first, before you do anything else. You can buy a
good one dedicated for the frequency spectrum you’re deploying (such as
902–928 MHz) for around the price of two readers. It’s a great investment to
keep you from guessing what’s happening.

Get the right tag for your product. There are so many different types of pas-
sive RFID tags available now, with such a wide variance of price range, that it
is critical to make sure that you pick the right tag for the job. The right tag is
seldom the most expensive one, and you can save a significant amount of
money by taking the up-front effort to do proper product and tag testing. Even
if you farm out testing to an outside lab, the few thousand dollars to test your
products could save hundreds of thousands in tag cost in the long run.
Antennas and RF energy are cheap; don’t be stingy with them. The more
diverse your antennas are, and the closer you can get them to the near field
(that is, 33 centimeters away for UHF — see Chapter 4 for more details), the
better your read success will be. Items that are RF unfriendly, such as cases
of metal objects or liquids, also require more antennas than you might use.
There’s nothing wrong with putting four antennas on a conveyor instead of
two to make sure you get more accuracy.
Over-engineer your read zone. If you need to read halfway across a dock
door and it’s five feet, set up the reader to read six or seven feet, as long as
you aren’t broadcasting RF energy to read past your desired boundary and
cause potential interference with an adjacent zone.
Joe White, Symbol Technologies
(Formerly Matrics, Inc.)
Choose the correct RFID technology that best suits your application
because many options are available. Options include frequency selection —
125 KHz, 13.56 MHz (also known as HF), 860–960 MHz (also known as UHF),
2.45 MHz, and others, — regulatory environment, the type of product being
tagged, the read range requirements, and RF environment.
Try to make sure you turn the transmit power of the radio only to a level
that meets the application requirements and no more. It is tempting to
always turn the power as high as it will go, but doing so may actually reduce
performance due to RF noise interference or driving the radio into compres-
sion. (Compression is a state in which the RF noise floor exceeds what the
radio receiver is designed to handle, thus rendering the radio unable to
detect tag responses.)
Remember that UHF RFID has troubles with two types of products: liquids
and metal. Liquids provide too much RF attenuation and prevent the energy
from powering the tag, while metals ground the RF energy and prevent pow-
ering the tag.
350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Metal is not a good substance for passive UHF tags because it grounds the
energy needed to power the tag. If you wish to tag metal items, try placing 
1⁄4 inch of cardboard or Styrofoam between the metal object and the tag.
To ensure best tag performance when tagging cases of liquid items, try plac-
ing the tag on the case where there are air gaps either between items or
toward the top of the case. For example, when tagging a case of laundry
detergent, the tag performs best on the case, near the top, by the handle of
the detergent. This is where there’s the least amount of liquid to interfere
with the RF performance.
When tagging cases of products that prevent RF signal propagation, try plac-
ing the tag on the outside corner of the cases. In some instances, using two
tags on the case at opposite corners will work best.
Duncan McCollum, Computer 
Sciences Corporation (CSC)
I think that the best way to ensure RFID project success is to focus on one
problem and solve that well. After you have that first project success under
your belt — no matter how small — you can easily transfer what you learned
to the next project.
Too often, RFID projects fail because we try to solve all our problems with
RFID. Find a problem in your organization that is well defined, within your
control, and measurable. If RFID is the best solution for that problem (that’s
another way to fail, RFID is not the solution to every problem!), start small,
master the fundamentals of the technology, get an early win, and showcase
your solution to the rest of the organization.
A good example is tracking full pallets in and out of a distribution center.
Often, because a pallet in and pallet out scenario does not go through a sort
line where there are bar codes reading each case, pallets going through this
cross-docking scenario are often not counted as accurately as broken-down
pallets. This would be a great first case for RFID: All full pallets going in and
out without being broken down could go through an in-bound and out-bound
RFID portal.
It’s important to remember that we are dealing with a technology that is
developing at a very fast rate; the prudent course is to stay just behind the
edge of the adoption curve. That doesn’t mean doing nothing; that means 
getting involved, testing, and understanding so when you’ve got the right
solution you can move quickly — that’s competitive advantage!

Chapter 20: Ten Tips from the Experts

Dr. Daniel Engels, MIT Auto-ID Labs
People get into trouble when they set up two readers adjacent to each other
(on dock doors for instance) and the transmit antennas from each reader are
facing receiving antennas from the other reader. This creates something
called compression. By canting the antennas (making sure you know which
antennas are transmit and receive and positioning them with as much dis-
tance between them as possible), you avoid compression problems and
increase read performance.
If you’re having trouble reading tags, a good way to troubleshoot is to deter-
mine if it is a forward link issue (lack of power to the tag) or return link issue
(the tag is responding but not being heard). By separating the transmit anten-
nas from the receiving antennas, you can diagnose this problem. You need 
a reader that has a dedicated transmit (Tx) port and a dedicated receive 
(Rx) port.
 Forward link issues usually occur when there is a lack of power to the
tag due to signal attenuation, insufficient RF power, or poor quality tags
are being used. Try moving the transmit antenna close to the tag while
leaving the receive antenna stationary until there is a successful read.
Forward link problems are best solved by adjusting the power up, moving
the antennas closer, trying a more sensitive RFID tag, or providing for
more antenna diversity (antennas covering more of the area in the pro-
posed RFID interrogation zone — by going from two to four antennas, 
for instance).
 Return link limitations usually occur when the tag is getting enough
power (above –10 dBm) but the receiver is unable to hear the tag’s
backscatter (response). The following table lists the possible causes of
return link limitations and their solutions.

Dr. Patrick King, Michelin 
Tire Corporation
Make sure you create read zones with known outer boundaries. This will
help you avoid issues with phantom or ghost reads from other areas. The
easiest way of designing an outer boundary edge without a spectrum ana-
lyzer and signal generator is to put the tag you are using on an empty card-
board box and place it just past where you want to be able to read items.
Turn down the power on the reader until there are no more reads. Because of
a phenomenon called hysteris, you should also start the reader at its lowest
power and turn it up incrementally until you can read the tag. The two power
levels should match. If they don’t, go with the lower level.
In a dock door environment, try to angle the antennas slightly outward.
Most antennas will be mounted just inside the dock door. Angling them to the
outside will help avoid interference with adjacent doors.
To capture RFID tag reads in the order that they occur in a conveyor appli-
cation, angle the antennas on a 30- to 45-degree angle in the flow of the
conveyor. The middleware application that you use should allow you to set
parameters so that when a tag enters the field and is first read, it can be
recorded in that order in your application.
Steve Kowalke, ACCU-SORT Systems
For your first mandated implementation, don’t go overboard — unless you
have a great understanding of the technology. There’s no need to do a full
implementation, spend several hundred thousand dollars on middleware and
readers, and then find out after you are generating data that you’ve taken the
wrong approach.
353
Chapter 20: Ten Tips from the Experts

The best first step into the RFID foray is to do a simple solution. An easy way
that we at ACCU-SORT have solved the problem is to provide a mobile solu-
tion in the distribution center. This solution works when the pallet is going
out to Wal-Mart or Target. A dock worker can scan the bar code on each case,
and the mobile RFID station writes and records the tag and the EPC number.
A solution like this, and a verification portal, can be installed in a matter of a
month after completing a Full Faraday Cycle Analysis and proper SKU testing.
All in all, a compliance solution like this can cost under $75,000 and give you
a good first taste of what kind and how much data your system will generate.
Team Tag-IT, Texas Instruments
Be mindful of FCC requirements, particularly if you are an early adopter 
of the technology. Ask your vendors about FCC certification early in the
process — what type of certification do you need (such as a site license or
experimental license), if any, and how will you acquire it.
Keep FCC compliance in mind, too. We were tasked with installing a one-off
antenna system. There exists an off-the-shelf reader/antenna combination on
the market that has FCC approval and would probably work well for our
niche install. However, the price was a few hundred dollars more than we
budgeted to spend, so we decided to manufacture the antenna inhouse. It
worked exactly like the competitive model. But, after install, we received a
quote on FCC approval testing for just under $10,000. So much for that ROI.
Liberally resource your internal manpower early in the program. Employees
involved from the start often champion the program within the organization.
Have a change management procedure that communicates to your team
changes in the schedule, technology, scope, personnel, and specifications.
Know what the long lead items (equipment or label procurement, site
preparation, and so on) are as early as possible in the deployment. This
minimizes impact to your project plan.
As they say in the Boy Scouts: Be Prepared.
Kevin MacDonald, Lead RFID 
Architect, Sun Microsystems
Make sure there is a dedicated project manager from both sides. Your internal
team should have a single point of contact who knows your legacy architecture
and has a good grasp of your technology road map, and your RFID vendor
should have one person who can coordinate the physics, the networking, the
middleware design, and application integration.
354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Set up an RFID dashboard to avoid data overload. This is something as
simple as an HTML or PHP user interface that gives information back on your
RFID network. The dashboard could be set up to aggregate only pertinent
information from each RFID interrogation zone, each distribution center, or
some other collection of the RFID network. RFID can create a lot of erroneous
data if you start with bad data collection. Some manufacturers have stated
that one SKU tracked through seven locations can generate 4 tetrabytes of
data per year. The reality is, in the end, that the useful, relevant data is a very
small amount. For example, if you’re tracking the movement of a widget
through the supply chain, you may only want to know what average times are
in a particular location and what cases took extremely long times. That will
allow you to drill down into the process and figure out exactly what was
going wrong and, more importantly, what can be fixed.
The way to set up the dashboard is to take a dual approach of modeling the
data and creating sample reports. To get a model to work from, you need to
gather data coming from a sample slice of your operation for a period of time
that is long enough for problems to arise. If it’s a very high-volume operation,
this may be a week or two; if it’s lower volume, it may be only a couple of days.
From there, you can run sample reports to determine where useful data may
reside and how you can adjust your filtering so that the bandwidth and edge
data requirements don’t become overwhelming.
Mark Nelson, Savi Technology
There are five critical players in bringing an RFID deployment from a pilot to
a full-blown commercial run. Those five players are
 Analysis Coordinator: One person to work on a part-time basis with the
Pre-Run Analysis Team for requirements gathering
 Project Coordinator: One person to work as an operational contact
during the commercial run as an internal project coordinator
 Participant Solicitation: Encourages key supply chain partners such as
shipping lines, LSP, and factories and warehouses to participate in pro-
duction deployment
 User Feedback Committee: Provides on-going feedback from user group
on an ad-hoc basis
 Executive Review: Executive team members to set a review meeting at
conclusion for results presentation
In Chapter 12, you can find more details about working through a pilot
deployment to a production deployment. Chapter 16 offers more about
putting together an RFID team and making the business case to executives.

any people are touting RFID as a replacement for the bar code, which
is universally accepted and understood to have a standard. However,
this isn’t quite the truth: There are more than 200 different bar code stan-
dards. Similarly, although movement toward universally accepted standards
is helping RFID gain ground on the bar code’s turf, you’ll find a variety of RFID
standards for specific applications, such as animal tracking or access control
cards. These industry-specific applications lead vendors to develop RFID as
the market demands them, without any concern for interoperability with
other niche applications.
The emerging global supply chain and collaboration among international
partners has led to attempts to create one global standard within an RFID
network. Many issues remain, but the evolution is progressing much quicker
than the bar code industry did.
Although the bar code is still the most prevalent Auto-ID technology, the evo-
lution to an advanced replacement — RFID — has put the focus on standards
and protocols. In Chapter 2, I explain why RFID is the new King of the Hill 
in Auto-ID technologies. In this chapter, I show you some of the standards for
Auto-ID in order to help you keep tabs on your business needs or standards
you may want to become involved in and help shape.
EAN.UCC
EAN International and the Uniform Code Council (UCC), which is a member
organization of the EAN International, are responsible for the co-management

of the EAN.UCC System and the Global Standard Management Process (GSMP).
The EAN.UCC System maintains and sets standards for bar codes, electronic
data interchange (EDI) transactions sets, XML schemas, and other supply-
chain solutions. By administering the assignment of company prefixes and
coordinating the accompanying standards, EAN International and the UCC
claims to “maintain the most robust item identification system in the world.”
Although the main role of EAN.UCC is the assignment of bar codes and
unique numbers for enterprise products and locations, the EAN.UCC also has
two initiatives for “tracking and trace” and “data synchronization.” The GTAG
(Global Tag) initiative was launched jointly by EAN International and the UCC
in 2000 for tracking and tracing items. The GTAG initiative was designed to
allow for both short-term solutions and a marrying of business processes with
standards development. These standards cover both UHF RFID technology
(including air interface) and data structure. The air interface efforts of GTAG
have become part of another standard — ISO 18000-6.
Go to www.ean-ucc.org to get the lowdown on this group.
EPCglobal
EPCglobal is leading the development of industry-driven standards for the
electronic product code (EPC) to support the use of radio frequency identifi-
cation. EPCglobal is responsible for assigning blocks of numbers to its mem-
bers, and also has defined the EPC tag protocol, which covers data structure
written to the tag and the air-interface protocol. They have also worked to
develop a data exchange and dubbed it the EPC network. In addition to pro-
viding unique numbers for product definition, this organization has also
defined a framework for implementing an RFID solution. This framework
defines everything from the specifications of the RFID tag to the interfaces
that relate a unique number to an enterprise. This requires the definition of
repository functions and interfaces to devices and back-end systems. The
purpose of the EPCglobal framework is to provide the ability to “track and
trace” products through the supply chain. Find more information about
EPCglobal at www.epcglobal.com.
UCCnet
A subsidiary of the Uniform Code Council (UCC, a global standards organiza-
tion), UCCnet is a nonprofit organization providing an electronic foundation
for implementing industry-developed standards. UCCnet stores a registry, or
catalog, of item-level data and provides an engine that synchronizes data
between businesses using the UCCnet platform.
358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Companies called data pools provide connection and access to the GLOBAL
registry. For a company to be its own data pool, it must be certified by the
UCC. If your firm is like most companies, you’ll send data to a data pool part-
ner, which then connects to the UCCnet network. This is very similar to Value
Added Networks (VANs) and their relationships in EDI.
UCCnet’s purpose is to synchronize data between enterprises. Whereas the
EPCglobal organization maintains a registry of product numbers, UCCnet main-
tains the details associated with those numbers. As I mention in Chapter 2, 
you can’t tell much about a product by simply knowing its EPC number. 
Most retailers will eventually require suppliers to provide this detailed data 
so that retailers can validate goods received, automatically update inventories,
and reduce errors in invoices and payments.
The bottom line to suppliers is that if you are working with one of the giant
retailers, such as Wal-Mart, you need to adopt UCCnet to collaborate within
the supply chain. RFID data won’t likely be sent on its own dedicated net-
work; rather, RFID systems will leverage existing technology already widely
used by trading partners. Visit UCCnet at www.uccnet.org.
ISO/IEC JT1/SC17
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has partnered with
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to address standards for
identification cards and related devices. Joint Technical Committee 1,
Subcommittee 17 is working on this. SC17 includes the standards 10536,

ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31/WG4
ISO is also working with the IEC to focus on automatic identification and data-
capture techniques. JTC1/SC31 (Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee
31) is focusing on data capture. The big enchilada of this committee is the
use of RFID for item management, and the committee is focusing on the stan-
dards 15961, 15962, 15963, and 18000:
 ISO/IEC 15961 RFID for Item Management — Data Protocol:
Application interface: This standard addresses the common functional
commands and syntax features (for example, RFID tag-types, data-storage
formats, and compression technology). The standards for the air interface
protocols don’t affect standard 15961. Rather, 15961 goes hand-in-hand
with standard 15962, which addresses the overall data-handling protocol.
 ISO/IEC 15962 RFID for Item Management — Protocol: Data encoding
rules and logical memory functions: This standard addresses the inter-
face procedure that an RFID system uses to exchange information for
item management. It creates uniform and correct formatting of data, the
structure of commands, and the processing of errors.
 ISO/IEC 15963 RFID for Item Management — Unique Identification of
RF Tag: This standard addresses the numbering system, the registration
procedure, and the use of RFID tags. The standard is designed to address
quality control during the manufacturing process. It also addresses the
traceability of the RF tags during their manufacture and usable lifetimes
and the anticollision issues of having many tags in an interrogation zone.
 ISO/IEC 18000 RFID Air Interface Standards: ISO standard 18000 is
designed to create true global interoperability in how tags and readers
communicate, even at different frequencies. The goal of this standard is
to ensure that the air interface protocol is universal.
18000 has seven different parts. Part 1 is the system architecture for
RFID for item management, including integration with legacy systems
and interoperability. Parts 3 and 6 are the two critical sections of 18000.
Part 3 enumerates two different modes of operation, which are not inter-
operable although they are designed not to contend/interfere with each
360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

other. Mode 1 is based on ISO 15693 with improvements, and Mode 2
lays out a new high-speed communication option. Part 6 also defines
two kinds of operation, known as types A and B.
For more details on these standards and to stay up with the latest, you
can check www.iso.org for more information.
The ISO/IEC 18000 series of standards differ from the EPC standard and
actually coexists with it because the ISO standards deal with only the air
interface protocol and not the numbering structure or the physical
implementation of the tags and readers.
AIAG
The Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) is a professional organization
working on supply-chain issues in the automotive industry. Its mission is 
to propose industrial standards and provide guidelines to the automotive
industry. The RFID data standard that the AIAG defined for tires is called the
B-11 standard. It provides information about the manufacturer, tire size, type
(including Department of Transportation data), and additional optional infor-
mation. Because it has more information than just an identification number,
the tag must be able to carry more data that is currently defined by
EPCglobal. Check out www.aiag.org for more information.
Container Shipments
Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. government has
been concerned about the vulnerability of American ports. As a result, two
government initiatives ensure the safety of shipments arriving in U.S. ports:
the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Smart and Secure Tradelanes (SST).
Container Security Initiative (CSI)
CSI was announced in January 2002, and so far has been implemented at the
top 20 foreign ports whose exports collectively represent approximately two-
thirds of the volume of containers imported into the United States. The govern-
ments of these ports have already agreed to implement CSI.
CSI equips ports with four core capabilities that improve security:
 Establish security criteria for identifying high-risk containers based
on advance information.
 Prescreen containers at the earliest possible point.
361
Chapter 21: Ten (Or So) RFID Standards and Protocols

 Use technology to quickly prescreen high-risk containers.
 Develop secure and “smart” containers.
This fourth point is where RFID comes into play and where the CSI inter-
sects another government initiative: Smart and Secure Tradelanes (SST).
You can find more about CSI at www.customs.gov/xp/cgov/enforcement/
international_activities/csi/.
Smart and Secure Tradelanes
Industry is driving SST, which uses an open technology platform. These indus-
tries are working with U.S. Customs, the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration, Operation Safe Commerce, C-TPAT (Customs-Trade Partnership
Against Terrorism), and the Container Security Administration in order to
improve the security and productivity of cargo shipments.
The RFID-enabled seals that SST employs let you know automatically when a
cargo shipment has been tampered with by going “silent.” For this system to
work, all container seals in a given area are constantly logged and monitored:
If any seal suddenly stops responding, it can be flagged for action. Because
counterfeiting these seals is impossible, no one can remove a tag and replace
it with another.
Active RFID tag manufacturer Savi Technology (www.savi.com) developed
the SST technology with a grant from the Department of Defense. Since
receiving clearance to market the technology for civilian use, Savi has been
actively building support for the product within the container transport com-
munity. For more information, see www.savi.com/products/casestudies/

Absorption: A certain type of optical attenuation that converts energy waves
(such as RF waves) into a different form of energy (such as heat) by interact-
ing with the material properties of an object.
AEN: See Ambient electromagnetic noise.
ALOHA slot: This data transmission protocol was developed for one of the
early local area networks. Hailing from the University of Hawaii, it describes 
a method of transmitting data that avoids data collision.
AM: See Amplitude modulation.
Ambient electromagnetic noise (AEN): Radio signals present in a specific
location that need to be identified in order to determine the level of potential
interference with an RFID system.
American Standards Code for Information Interchange (ASCII): A binary, 
7-bit data encoding scheme comprising 128 codes used to represent all of the
upper- and lowercase Latin letters, numbers, punctuation, and so on.
Amplifier: This electronic device increases a signal’s transmitted power. You
typically use it in-line between a reader and an antenna if the antenna needs a
stronger signal.
Amplitude: The height of a wave.
Amplitude modulation (AM): A signal encoding technique that modifies the
amplitude of a radio wave (as opposed to its frequency) depending on the
behavior of the signal that it is transporting. By changing the amplitude of a
wave, an RFID tag can transmit a binary signal to the reader. The method of
changing the amplitude is known as amplitude shift keying, or ASK.
Analog signal: A signal that transmits continuous data, rather than discrete
data (like a digital signal).

Antenna gain: The ratio, usually expressed in decibels, of the power needed
for an antenna to produce the same field strength in a specific direction. The
higher the gain, the more powerful the energy output. Antennas with higher
gain will be able to read tags from farther away.
API: Application programming interface.
Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC): A specially designed chip for a
specific purpose — like RFID.
ASCII: See American Standards Code for Information Interchange.
ASIC: See Application-specific integrated circuit.
Asynchronous: Data that travels in a different time sequence (as in not back
and forth at the same time) or directional properties and does not share a
common clock source.
Attenuation: A reduction of the signal strength that is usually caused by some
other factor. For instance, liquid can attenuate the signal of an RFID tag so
that it can not send back a strong enough signal for the reader to read the tag.
Backscatter: The method of collecting inbound energy, changing the proper-
ties of that energy, and then reflecting it back to a receiving device (like an RFID
reader). Most passive RFID tags use backscatter technology to communicate.
Bandwidth: The number of bits per second transmitted across a channel (for
example, a T-1 transmits at 1.54 Mbps); or the range of frequencies a trans-
mission system operates within (such as 902–928 MHz).
Baud: The signaling speed of a communication device. This is sometimes
used synonymously with, and is usually equivalent to, bits per second.
Bend radius: The maximum amount a cable can be bent before serious signal
attenuation occurs. This is usually a functional characteristic of cable and
fibre. It’s important to know the bend radius as you wire up RFID antennas.
Bidirectional: A system that is capable of transmitting simultaneously both
forward and backward.
Bin: A value in binary notation.
Binary: A Base 2 counting scheme that has 0 and 1 as its primary digits. Also
known as digital.
Bit rate: Bits per second.
Bluetooth: An open wireless standard operating at a transmission speed of 1
Mbps that is used for short-range transmissions.

RFID For Dummies 

Bus: The parallel device that interconnects the components of a computer.
Capacitance: The ability, measured in farads, to store an electrical charge in
a circuit.
Capacitive coupling: The transfer of electromagnetic energy from one circuit
to another through mutual capacitance. This is important in RFID because a
tag, after it’s given a charge from a reader, couples with that reader and
stores that charge for a certain period.
Carrier frequency: The main frequency of a transmitter or RFID reader. This
frequency is modulated in order to transmit information.
Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD): The
access scheme used in Ethernet LANs, which formed the basis for many of
the early slot protocols used in RFID. A device that is ready to transmit data
first checks the channel for other data being transmitted. If the channel is
clear, it transmits its data. If two devices transmit simultaneously, a collision
occurs, and both devices abort the data transmission and then wait a
random amount of time before transmitting again.
Checksum: A small bit of code added to a data block to verify its complete
transmission. Often, an RFID microchip has a checksum that is checked
before and after data is transmitted from the tag to the reader to determine
whether the data has been corrupted or lost. One type of checksum is the
cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
Chip: See Integrated circuit or chip.
Circularly polarized antenna: A UHF reader antenna that broadcasts RF
waves in a circular pattern. Because of its design, it is less orientation-
sensitive — you don’t have to make sure the tag is in a perfect position in
order to be read — but it has a shorter read range than a linearly polarized
antenna, which is orientation-sensitive.
Close coupling smart card: A card that is similar to contact-based smart
cards and is characterized by extremely short read ranges.
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS): A form of integrated
circuit (IC) technology typically used in low-speed, low-power applications.
Compression: The process of eliminating redundant information from data in
order to reduce the size of transmitted data without losing data integrity.
CRC: See Cyclic redundancy check.
CSMA/CD: See Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection.
365
Appendix: Glossary of Electrical, Magnetic, and Other Scientific Terms

Cyclic redundancy check (CRC): A type of checksum function using a mathe-
matical technique for verifying the integrity of a data file to make sure that no
data has been lost or corrupted. In the EPC data structure, a CRC is returned
as the last block of data signifying a complete and successful read.
Decibel (dB): A logarithmic measure of the strength of a transmitted signal,
most commonly associated with sound waves, but used to measure various
types of waveform communication (like RF). Because it is logarithmic, a 20 dB
loss indicates that the received signal is one one-hundredth its original
strength.
Die: The silicon block onto which circuits are etched to create a chip.
Dielectric: A substance that is nonconductive, but that can sustain an 
electrical field.
Diode: A semiconductor device that allows current to flow only in a single
direction.

sive RFID surveillance. This surveillance uses simple electronic tags that can
be turned on or off. When an item is purchased at a store or checked out
366
RFID For Dummies 

from a library, the tag is turned off during checkout. If a tag hasn’t been turned
off, an alarm sounds when the item is carried through a gate area. EAS tags
have been widely used in the retail and pharmaceutical world for the past
twenty years.

enough additional information is sent along with transmitted data that a
receiver can both detect an error and actually fix it without requesting a
resend.

its frequency in order to take advantage of alternate channels.
367
Appendix: Glossary of Electrical, Magnetic, and Other Scientific Terms

Frequency hopping: A transmitting device’s continual shifting from frequency
to frequency within a specific bandwidth range in order to comply with the
requirements by certain standards bodies not to transmit on any one unli-
censed frequency band for more than a certain length of time. In the United
States, this is governed by the FCC Rules Part 15.

quency of an electromagnetic wave is modulated according to the behavior
of the signal that it is transporting.

a voltage is moved across it. This resistance is the combined effect of capaci-
tance, inductance, and resistance on a signal, measured in ohms (Ω), and 
representing the ratio of voltage to the flow of current allowed. According 
to Ohm’s law, voltage is the product of current and resistance at a given 
frequency.
Inductance: The property of an electric circuit by which a current flowing
through it is changed, measured in henrys (H) and represented by the 
character L.

to another by virtue of the inductance between the two circuits. Inductive
coupling may be deliberate and desired, as with an impedance matcher that
matches the impedance of a transmitter to an antenna to guarantee maximum
transfer of power, or it may be unplanned and unwanted.
Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands: The group of unlicensed,
unregulated frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum consisting of the
902–928 MHz range in the United States, or the 864–870 MHz range in Europe.

strate. Inlays are essentially unfinished RFID labels that are sold to label con-
verters who turn them into smart labels.
Integrated circuit or chip (IC): A microelectronic semiconductor device
made up of interconnected transistors and other electronic components.

often between an array of antennas.
ISM: See Industrial, Scientific, and Medical bands.
Lambda (λ): The representation for a single wavelength in electromagnetic
calculations.
Linear-polarized antenna: A UHF antenna that focuses the radio energy from

providing greater penetration through dense materials. Tags designed for use
with a linear-polarized antenna must be aligned with the reader antenna in
order to be read correctly.

decibels (dB).
Low-frequency (LF): The frequency bandwidth from 30 kHz to 300 kHz. Low-
frequency RFID tags typical operate at 125 kHz or 134 kHz. Low-frequency
RFID tags have to be read from within three feet, and their data transfer rate
is slow, but they are less susceptible to interference than UHF tags.
LSbit: Least significant bit.
LSbyte: Least significant byte.
Manchester encoding: A data transmission code in which data and clock 
signals are combined to form a self-synchronizing data stream.
Material dispersion: A dispersion effect caused by the fact that different

Microwave tags: A term that is sometimes used to refer to RFID tags that
operate at 5.8 GHz. These tags have a very high transfer rate and can be read
from as far as 30 feet away, but they are more expensive and consume more
power than other types of RFID tags. (Some people refer to any tag that oper-
ates above 415 MHz as a microwave tag.)

voltage. The voltage always opposes the change in the magnetic field produced
by the coupled coil.
Near-field communication: Communication between an RFID tag and reader
that occurs within one full wavelength of the reader, typically with low- and
high-frequency systems. The near-field signal decays as the cube of the dis-
tance from the antenna. See also Far-field communication.
Noise: Unwanted ambient electrical signals that cause unpredictable impair-
ment to RFID communications.

Path loss: The degradation of an RFID signal based on the inverse square law
for electromagnetic signals, caused by the concentration of the signal being
spread out over a greater receiving area.
Penetration: The ability of a radio frequency to pass through nonmetallic
materials. Low-frequency systems have better penetration than UHF systems.
Phantom read: The report of the presence of a tag that doesn’t exist in its
designated interrogation zone. Also called a phantom transaction or false read.

the same housing.
371
Appendix: Glossary of Electrical, Magnetic, and Other Scientific Terms

Transponder: A device that comprises a transmitter, a receiver, and a multi-
plexer in one; or a device that receives and transmits radio signals at a prede-
termined frequency range. After receiving a signal, a transponder rebroadcasts
it at a different frequency. An RFID tag is a classic example of a transponder.
UID: See Unique identifier.
Ultrahigh frequency (UHF): The frequency bandwidth from 300 MHz to 
3 GHz. Normally, RFID tags that operate between 866 MHz and 960 MHz can
send information faster and farther than high- and low-frequency tags. UHF
signals can’t pass through many items with a high water content, such as
fruit. UHF tags are more expensive than low-frequency tags, and they con-
sume more power.
Unique identifier (UID): A serial number that identifies a unique transponder.
The U.S. Department of Defense has also developed an identification scheme
called UID.
Wavelength: The distance between the same points on two consecutive waves.
The distance can be measured from the peak or trough of one wave to the
respective peak or trough of the next consecutive wave. Wavelength (λ) and
frequency (f) are always related by the speed of light (c), such that λ = c/f.
WORM (write once read many): A type of RFID tag that can be written to
only once, and subsequently can only be read. Usually associated with 
Class 1 EPC tags.
