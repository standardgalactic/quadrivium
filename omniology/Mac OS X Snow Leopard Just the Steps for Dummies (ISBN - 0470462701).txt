Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I wish to thank my family for their

My children had to give up their homework computer 
to become a Snow Leopard test machine, and my wife 
Christa provided unwavering support during an 
extremely challenging work schedule. 
I want to thank Bob Woerner and Wiley for bringing 
me on for this book, and the Wiley publishing team 
who helped put it all together. Paul Levesque and 
Virginia Sanders turned my cocktail napkin scribblings 
into something readable, and Dennis Cohen made 
sure that it was all technically accurate.

Contents at a Glance


M
ac users have always been a loyal group, and for good reasons. Since 
Apple first started producing Macintosh computers in the 1980s, the 
company has placed an emphasis on quality, ease of use, and stability. 
Modern Macs running the latest operating system, OS X, are among the 
most powerful and dependable personal computers you can buy, and 
they’re versatile enough to meet virtually any personal or professional need 
you may have.
About This Book
Macs are user friendly, but they’re still computers, so you must follow cer-
tain steps to complete tasks, like setting up an e-mail account, accessing a 
Wi-Fi hotspot, transferring music to an iPod, customizing the OS X interface, 
creating a network, and almost any other computer task you can imagine. 
This book provides the steps you need to get up and running quickly, with-
out having to pore through extra narratives or examples that you probably 
don’t need anyway. And because a picture is worth a thousand words, all the 
steps in this book are accompanied by figures that walk you visually through 
each task.
Why You Need This Book
Whether you’re new to Macs or you just want a handy quick reference to OS 
X Snow Leopard, this book helps you get to work quickly and efficiently. 
Each task covers a specific subject, and most steps take only a minute or two 
to follow. This book also provides crucial tips that you won’t find in your 
Mac’s built-in help system.
Conventions used 
in this book
➟ When you have to access a menu command, 
I use the ➪ symbol. For example, if you have 
to open the File menu and then choose Open, 
I say choose File➪Open.

Mac OS X Snow Leopard Just the Steps For Dummies
Part IV: Using Multimedia
A modern Mac running OS X Snow Leopard is one of the 
most powerful multimedia devices you can buy. With iLife 
programs that come bundled with new Macs, you can 
watch DVDs; manage and play your music library; send 
music to iPhones, iPods, and other MP3 players; organize 
and improve digital photos; and make your own movies.
Part V: Networking Your Mac
If you have more than one computer, you’ll probably 
want to connect those computers at some point so that 
they can share files, printers, Internet connections, and 
other resources. This part shows you how to set up net-
works between all your computers, even if some of those 
computers are Windows PCs.
Part VI: Extending Your Mac’s Capabilities
As powerful and versatile as most Macs are right out of the 
box, they can be even more so. In this part, I show you 
how to use Bluetooth peripherals with your Mac, and how 
to upgrade your Mac with more memory and storage. One 
chapter even shows you how to install the Microsoft 
Windows operating system on your Mac.
Get Ready To . . .
If you’re ready to fire up your first Mac or you’re a long-
time user and need quick steps to access advanced features, 
a task in this book is ready to help you.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized the chapters of this book into several basic parts:
Part I: Using OS X
The Mac OS X operating system is accessible and easy to use 
right out of the box. But if you want to customize the way 
OS X looks and behaves, the chapters in this part show you how. 
Chapters also show you how to manage system preferences 
and work with files and folders, which is especially helpful if 
you’re new to Macs.
Part II: Getting to Work in OS X
Macs aren’t all about iPods and movies. This part shows you 
how to use some of the handy programs that are included 
with OS X, as well as how to use productivity programs, such 
as word processors and presentation programs. I show you 
how to use and customize the OS X Dashboard, an innovative 
tool that gives you instant access to notepads, calculators, 
weather updates, sports scores, and more. And I show you 
how to clean up desktop clutter with another great OS X Snow 
Leopard feature called Spaces.
Part III: Going Online with Your Mac
If you’re like most people, the Internet is one of the main rea-
sons you use a computer in the first place. In this part, I show 
you how to browse the Web, exchange e-mail, chat, and even 
create your own Web pages.

Customizing OS X
A
pple is rightfully proud of the user interface design incorporated into 
the Macintosh OS X family of operating systems. The interface is easy 
to use, and it’s also easy to customize so that your Mac looks and behaves 
the way you want.
This chapter shows you how to customize various parts of the OS X inter-
face, including
 ➟ Desktop: You can change the color scheme of your Desktop or use a 
picture as your background.
 ➟ Display: You can also change the size of the Desktop display, use a 
custom screen saver, and adjust the way the clock appears.
 ➟ Dock: The OS X Dock normally resides at the bottom of the screen 
and gives quick access to your most commonly used programs. You 
can move the Dock, add or remove items, and change the way the 
Dock appears.
 ➟ Keyboard and accessibility: Mac OS X can accommodate most acces-
sibility needs, and you can change common keyboard shortcuts.
 ➟ Exposé: Switch quickly between programs with this OS X tool.
 ➟ Spaces: If you’re tired of constantly re-arranging your Desktop, create 
and easily move between multiple virtual workspaces using Snow 
Leopard’s Spaces feature.

shortcuts. If you see the yellow warning triangles, at least one 
shortcut must be changed.
 7. To disable a keyboard shortcut, remove the check mark 
next to it.
 8. Close the Keyboard & Mouse preferences pane to save 
your changes.
 
 If you’re unhappy with the keyboard shortcuts you’ve customized 
or if you’re using a pre-owned computer that was customized by 
someone else, open the Keyboard Shortcuts settings and click the 
Restore Defaults button. This restores all keyboard shortcuts back 
to their factory defaults.

Figure 1-9: Clicking and dragging application icons to the Dock
Figure 1-10: Removing an icon from the Dock
Add and Remove Dock Icons
 1. Double-click the desktop icon for your hard drive and 
then click Applications under Places in the Sidebar on 
the left side of the Finder. This action opens the 
Applications folder, as shown in Figure 1-9.
 2. Locate the icon for the program that you want to add to 
the Dock.
 
 In some cases — such as Apple iWork or Microsoft Office applica-
tions — you may need to open a subfolder to find a program’s 
icon. Look closely at the icon; if the icon looks like a folder, it’s 
a folder.
 3. Click and drag the program’s icon to the Dock, as 
shown in Figure 1-9. The place where you drop the icon 
on the Dock will be that icon’s location. (Keep in mind 
that applications must be to the left of the divider.)
 4. To launch an application from the Dock, simply click 
the appropriate icon. The application launches.
 5. To remove an icon from the Dock, click and hold the 
mouse button on the icon until a pop-up menu 
appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
 
 If you’re using a two-button mouse, simply right-click the 
Dock icon you want to remove instead of clicking and holding.
 6. While still holding down the mouse button, move the 
pointer over Remove from Dock and then release the 
mouse button. The icon disappears from the Dock.

Move and Hide the Dock

Move and Hide the Dock
 1. Open System Preferences and then click the Dock icon.
 2. In the Dock preferences pane, as shown in Figure 1-11, 
move the Size slider to change the Dock size.
 
 You can also change the Dock size at any time by clicking and 
dragging up or down on the thin vertical line near the right side of 
the Dock.
 3. If you want to use Dock magnification — a useful fea-
ture that magnifies icons when you hover the mouse 
pointer over them — place a check mark next to 
Magnification and adjust the slider as desired.
 4. Choose a Dock position by clicking the Left, Bottom, or 
Right radio buttons. Figure 1-12 shows the Dock on the 
left side of the screen.
 
 If you have a widescreen monitor, you may find that putting the 
Dock on the left or right side of the screen makes more efficient use 
of screen real estate.
 5. If you don’t like the bouncy feedback provided by Dock 
icons when you launch a program, remove the check 
mark next to Animate Opening Applications. An arrow 
still shows you when the program is launching.
 6. To automatically hide the Dock when it isn’t in use, 
place a check mark next to Automatically Hide and 
Show the Dock. To reveal the hidden Dock, simply 
move the mouse pointer to the bottom (or left or right, 
as appropriate) of the screen.

 2. To adjust settings for visual impairments, click the 
Seeing tab to reveal the Seeing settings, as shown in 
Figure 1-13.
 3. To enable VoiceOver — a basic screen-reader program 
built-in to OS X — select the On radio button below 
VoiceOver.
 
 If you aren’t happy with how VoiceOver sounds, click the Open 
VoiceOver Utility button. There you can change the voice, pitch, 
speed, and other characteristics of VoiceOver.
 4. To enable screen zooming, select the On radio button 
below Zoom. Press Option+Ô+= to zoom in on an area 
of the screen, and press Option+Ô+– to zoom back out.
 5. Use the settings below Display to change the appear-
ance and use of color on-screen.
 6. Click the Hearing tab to reveal audio options, as shown 
in Figure 1-14.
 7. If you can’t hear alert sounds from the computer, place 
a check mark next to Flash the Screen When an Alert 
Sound Occurs.

 9. To enable Sticky Keys, select the On radio button next 
to Sticky Keys. The Sticky Keys feature allows you to use 
modifier keys, such as Shift, Function, Control, Option, 
and Ô, without simultaneously pressing multiple keys.
 
 If you need Sticky Keys only occasionally, place a check mark next to 
Press the Shift Key Five Times to Turn Sticky Keys On or Off. This 
option gives you an easy way to quickly enable or disable Sticky Keys.
 10. To create a delay between when a key is first pressed 
and when it’s accepted by the computer, select the On 
option next to Slow Keys. Use the Acceptance Delay 
slider to change the length of the delay.
 11. Click the Mouse (or Mouse & Trackpad if you have a 
laptop) tab to open pointer device settings, as shown in 
Figure 1-16.
 12. If you want to use a numeric keypad in place of a 
mouse, select the On option next to Mouse Keys.
 
 If your keyboard doesn’t include a dedicated keypad — this is 
usually the case with laptops — you can purchase a USB (Universal 
Serial Bus) keypad at most computer and office supply stores.
 13. Use the Initial Delay and Maximum Speed sliders to 
fine-tune the behavior of the Mouse Keys feature.
 14. If the mouse cursor is too small, use the Cursor Size 
slider to change the size of the cursor. The Cursor Size 
slider works with Mouse Keys as well as a conventional 
mouse or trackpad.
 
 If you’re giving a presentation with your Mac and a digital 
projector, you may want to increase the size of the mouse cursor so 
that the cursor can be used as an on-screen pointer during the 
presentation.

Creating and 
Managing User 
Accounts
A
fter you get a new computer, you’ll probably want to customize it to fit 
your needs and personality. You may tweak the Desktop appearance, 
add favorite programs to the Dock, and set up e-mail and chat programs for 
your personal accounts. But what if your computer is shared by other 
people? 
The Macintosh operating system allows you to easily set up multiple user 
accounts on your computer, and this chapter shows you how. Personal user 
accounts have several advantages:
 ➟ Each user can customize the way the operating system looks and 
behaves without affecting other users.
 ➟ Users can set up and use their own e-mail and Internet accounts. 
Private files and communications stay private.
 ➟ User accounts can help prevent unauthorized persons from using the 
computer.
 ➟ Parents can control how their children use the computer.
 
 Most security and account-related settings require an administrator password. If you see 
a lock icon in the lower-left corner of a preferences pane, click it to enter your adminis-
trator account name and password.

Managing Files 
and Folders
C
onsider all the things for which you use your computer: You compose 
e-mail, browse the Internet, edit photos, play music, type memos, and 
more. Many of these tasks involve files that are stored on your hard drive.
The Macintosh operating system makes managing your files easy. The Mac 
OS X component that helps you browse and manage files is the Finder. The 
Finder runs at all times in the background, and you can open Finder win-
dows from the Dock or any time you double-click the icon for a hard drive 
or folder. The Finder lets you quickly perform basic tasks, like creating fold-
ers and moving or deleting files. The Finder also lets you perform more 
advanced tasks, such as customizing a file’s icon or changing the default 
program you use to open a file.
This chapter shows you how to manage files with the Finder. It also shows 
you how to use other OS X file management tools, including
 ➟ Spotlight: This is a powerful tool for searching files, programs, and 
even system settings.
 ➟ Trash: Deleted files are sent to the Trash. If you accidentally delete a 
needed file, you can usually recover it from the Trash.
 ➟ Burn folders: Back up important files to recordable CDs or DVDs by 
using Burn folders.
 ➟ Time Machine: Time Machine makes it easy to back up your entire 
computer on a regular basis.

 Recording errors are less likely to occur at slower burn speeds. Unless 
you’re in a hurry, choose the slowest burn speed possible.
Back Up Files to a CD
 1. In the Finder or simply on the Desktop (the menu bar 
at the top of the screen must say Finder), choose 
File➪New Burn Folder. A new Burn folder appears.
 2. Type a name for the Burn folder. The name will be the 
disc volume name when the disc is recorded.
 3. Click and drag files and folders to the Burn folder.
 4. To review the items in the Burn folder, double-click the 
folder to open it.
 5. To find out how much space will be required to store 
the files in the Burn folder, look at the Minimum Disc 
Size reading at the bottom of the Burn Folder window, 
as shown in Figure 3-15.
 
 Remember, most CDs can hold 700MB of data and most DVDs hold 
up to 4.7GB of data. To burn DVDs, your computer must have a 
SuperDrive or external DVD burner. Dual-layer DVDs can hold up 
to 8.5GB of data and require a dual-layer DVD burner. Most Apple 
SuperDrives produced since 2007 support dual-layer discs. 
 6. After you’re done adding files, click the Burn button in 
the top-right corner of the Burn Folder window.
 7. When you’re prompted to do so, insert a blank, record-
able disc of the appropriate size.

Back Up Your Computer 
with Time Machine
 1. If you have an external hard drive, connect it to your 
computer and prepare it for use, as I describe in 
Chapter 22.
 
 An external drive isn’t required for using Time Machine, but files 
that are backed up to an external drive will be safer in case a 
component inside your computer fails. Without an external hard 
drive, you must create a second partition on your internal hard 
drive to use Time Machine.
 2. Open System Preferences and then click the Time 
Machine icon.
 3. Next to Back Up To, click Select Disk.
 4. Select a drive to which you want backups to be saved, as 
shown in Figure 3-17.
 
 If storage space is a major concern, select the Automatically Delete 
Backups Older Than check box and then select a time frame. 
Shorter time frames use less disk space.
 5. Click Use for Backup to return to the main Time 
Machine preferences pane.
 6. If you have a folder containing large files that don’t need 
to be backed up, click Options, click the Add button (it 
looks like a plus sign) on the Do Not Backup tab that 
appears, and then browse to the desired folder. Select the 
folder and click Exclude, as shown in Figure 3-18.
 7. To start a backup immediately, click Back Up Now and 
then close the Time Machine preferences pane. Backups 
occur silently and don’t interfere with your other work.

 1. Click the Time Machine icon on the Dock.
 2. In the Time Machine screen that appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-19, click the arrows in the lower-right corner of 
the screen to move to earlier backups.
 
 You can also click a screen in the main window to jump directly to 
it. Each screen in the background represents a different backup 
time. You can also move through backups by clicking the graduated 
scale along the right side of the Time Machine screen.
 3. Use the Finder window and its Sidebar to browse to the 
file that you want to restore. If you can’t find the desired 
file, go back in time to an earlier backup.
 
 Click Only Show Changes to display only those files that have 
changed since the backup was performed. For example, if you 
edited a file yesterday, backups of that file from two or three days 
ago don’t contain your edits.
 4. When you find the file that you want to back up, select 
it and click Restore in the lower-right corner of the Time 
Machine window.
 
 Click Cancel if you want to close Time Machine without restoring a 
file.
 5. Check the restored file to make sure it’s the one you 
want. If the restored file has the same name as an item 
that’s currently on your computer, the restored file 
assumes the proper name and the existing file has 
(original) tacked onto its name, as shown in Figure 3-20.

Adjusting System 
Preferences
T
he Macintosh computer is known for its ease of use, but “easy” doesn’t 
mean simplistic. Beneath the friendly exterior of OS X is a powerful 
operating system that you can configure for almost any task, and it doesn’t 
hurt that you can use your Mac with a wide variety of peripheral hardware 
as well.
This chapter shows you how to configure the system software for your spe-
cific needs and hardware. Tasks show you how to take command of both 
the internal hardware in your Mac and the peripherals attached to it. Specific 
tasks include
 ➟ Internal components: Operating system tools help you make the 
most efficient use of your laptop’s batteries, decide which disk is used 
to boot the system, and update the OS X software.
 ➟ Peripherals: Your Mac can work with a variety of printers, monitors, 
keyboards, and audio devices. Configuring peripherals in OS X is easy.
The tasks in this chapter show you how to control your computer’s hard-
ware with OS X software tools. The final task also shows you more about 
the specifications and performance of your computer, which is important if 
you decide to make some upgrades. If you want to upgrade the actual hard-
ware of your Mac, see Chapter 22.

Save Energy with Power Settings
 1. Open System Preferences by choosing Apple➪System 
Preferences.
 2. Click the Energy Saver icon.
 3. If you have a laptop, choose Battery from the Settings 
pop-up menu and then choose a power saving profile 
from the Optimization pop-up menu.
 4. Adjust the sliders to change when the computer and 
monitor will go to sleep, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
 The monitor uses a lot of power, so it’s a good idea to let the display 
sleep after a few minutes of inactivity. This is especially true if you 
have a laptop running on battery power. When the computer 
sleeps, the hard drive, memory, and processor turn off.  
 5. If other computers on your network use printers or hard 
drives on your computer, select the Wake for Network 
Access check box. This allows network computers to use 
shared printers and resources even if your Mac has gone 
to sleep.
 
 If you have a portable Mac, review additional laptop-specific options 
such as whether to display the battery icon in the menu bar and 
whether you want the monitor to dim slightly before going to sleep.
 6. Click the Schedule button. If you want the computer to 
wake or start at a certain time each day, select the Start 
Up or Wake check box and then choose dates and times 
for automatic startup, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 7. If you have a laptop, choose Power Adapter from the 
Settings For pop-up menu and then repeat Steps 3–6 to 
adjust settings for when your computer is plugged in to 
wall power.

Update System Software
 1. Make sure that your computer is connected to the 
Internet and close all open applications.
 
 Look at the Dock and make sure that you quit all programs. 
Running programs have a small, bluish-white dot below their icons. 
You can’t quit the Finder, but you can quit everything else.
 2. Choose Apple➪Software Update. The Software Update 
application launches and checks the Internet for 
updates, as shown in Figure 4-3. 
 3. When a list of available updates appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-4, review each item and remove check marks 
next to items that you don’t want to update.
 
 If you’re not sure what an item is, click it once. A description of the 
update appears in the bottom section of the Software Update 
window. 
 4. Click the Install button at the bottom of the Software 
Update window to begin downloading the updates.
 5. Enter your administrator password in the dialog that 
appears and then click OK.
 6. Read and accept any license agreements that appear. 
After you accept all the agreements, a status window 
shows you the download progress of your updates.
 
 When you review the list of updates, look for ones that say they must 
be installed separately. These should be downloaded individually, 
which means you may have to run Software Update a couple of times. 
 
 Software Update runs automatically when you restart your Mac, but not 
when you sleep or hibernate the computer. If you don’t restart your Mac 
very often, manually run Software Update at least once a week to 
ensure that you get critical updates to OS X and your other software.

ersonal computers first became popular in the 1980s, well before the 
days of iPods and social networking Web sites. Why did people spend 
hundreds or even thousands of dollars on primitive computers like the 
Apple II, TRS-80, IBM PC, and early Macintosh? Even before digital multi-
media and the online world came into power, computers were powerful 
tools to help organize data, type reports, and store information.
Today, most people take it for granted that computers help them compose 
letters, track schedules, and manage contacts. And with a Mac, you really can 
take these things for granted because new Macintosh computers come with 
an array of free programs to help you accomplish common tasks. These 
handy programs live in the OS X Applications folder, and this chapter shows 
you how to use some of them. This chapter shows you how to

ou probably have some Windows-using friends who say things like, “I 
would use a Mac, but the programs I need aren’t available for OS X.”
Given this perception, it comes as a surprise to many people that, in fact, a 
lot of applications are available for OS X, including ubiquitous Microsoft 
Office applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. If you have work to 
get done, your Macintosh is up to the task.
Applications, such as word processors, spreadsheet programs, and presenta-
tion programs, are often called productivity programs. Apple offers its own 
suite of productivity programs — iWork. iWork is more affordable than 
Microsoft Office and includes Pages (a word processor), Keynote (a presenta-
tion program), and Numbers (a spreadsheet program).
This chapter shows you how to use iWork applications, but many of the 
basic techniques apply to Microsoft Office as well. To order iWork, visit your 
local Apple retailer or see www.apple.com/iwork. Tasks show how to cre-
ate and edit new presentations and word processing documents with iWork 
applications.
 
 Free trials of Apple iWork and Microsoft Office are pre-installed in the Applications fold-
ers of most new Macs. For more on using Microsoft Office applications for OS X, check 
out Microsoft Office 2008 for Macs For Dummies by Bob LeVitus (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Using Dashboard
C
omputers are supposed to be labor-saving devices, but it seems to take 
an awful lot of mouse clicks, menu commands, and keyboard inputs to 
get anything done. This is what makes computers less intuitive than, say, a 
car, where every important control is immediately at hand and critical infor-
mation is within your peripheral view.
The engineers at Apple must have been thinking about computer usability 
problems, too. When they released OS X version 10.4 Tiger, they included 
a new tool — Dashboard. Like the instrument panel in your car, the OS X 
Dashboard puts important information and tools within easy reach. Dashboard 
isn’t quite in peripheral view — if it was it would be in the way — but it is 
just a single mouse click or keypress away, and Dashboard doesn’t affect 
your other applications.
This chapter shows you how to open Dashboard and how to add and 
remove Dashboard items, which are also called widgets. Dashboard widgets 
covered in this chapter include

Open Dashboard
 1. To open Dashboard, simply click the Dashboard icon 
on the Dock. The screen dims slightly, and Dashboard 
widgets zoom into view, as shown in Figure 7-1. You 
can also open Dashboard by two additional methods:
 
• Double-click the Dashboard icon in the Applications 
folder.
 
• Press F12 on your keyboard (F4 on newer Apple 
keyboards).
 2. To change the way Dashboard opens, open System 
Preferences and then click the Exposé & Spaces icon.
 3. To create a hot corner for Dashboard, click the Exposé 
tab and then select Dashboard from one of the Active 
Screen Corner menus. (In Figure 7-2, the lower-right 
corner has been set to Dashboard.) Then, to open 
Dashboard, simply move the mouse pointer to the cor-
responding corner of the screen.
 4. To change the keyboard shortcut used for opening 
Dashboard, make a different selection in the Hide and 
Show menu.
 
 If you want to use a modifier key, such as Ô or Control, simply 
hold down that key (or keys) while making a selection in the Hide 
and Show menu.
 
 You can’t quit Dashboard like other OS X applications. To close 
Dashboard, simply click a blank area of the screen. Although a blue 
and white dot remains under the Dashboard icon on the Dock, very 
few of your computer’s resources are dedicated to Dashboard.

Add Items to Dashboard
 1. Open Dashboard.
 2. Click the plus sign in the lower-left corner of the 
Dashboard screen. A list of widgets appears along the 
bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 3. Click the arrow buttons on the far right or left of the list 
of widgets to scroll through the list.
 4. To add a widget, simply click the widget in the list. The 
new widget is plopped onto your Dashboard. In Figure 
7-4, the widget for showing movie times was added.
 5. Click and drag widgets to move them to new locations 
on the Desktop.
 6. To remove a widget from Dashboard, click the X button 
in the upper-left corner of the widget. You can always 
add the widget back later if you want.
 7. After you’re done adding, moving, and removing wid-
gets, click the X button in the lower-left corner of the 
screen, just above the horizontal list of widgets. The list 
disappears, and the X turns back into a plus sign.
 
 You can click and drag widgets to new locations at any time; the 
widget list at the bottom of the screen need not be visible when 
moving widgets. You need the widget list open only when you’re 
adding and removing widgets.
 
 Dashboard lets you add multiple copies of the same widget. So for 
example, you can have one clock showing local time and another 
showing GMT, or you can display weather widgets for multiple 
cities.

you live in Aurora, Colorado, enter Aurora and not Denver. This 
ensures that your weather report is as accurate as possible for your 
specific location.
 4. Choose whether you want the temperature to display in 
Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F) in the Degrees menu.
 5. If you want the weather outlook to display daily low 
temperatures as well as daily highs, select the Include 
Lows in 6-Day Forecast check box.
 6. Click Done and then check your weather outlook, as 
shown in Figure 7-7.
 7. For a compact display of the Weather widget, click the

Sending E-Mail and 
Browsing the Internet
P
ersonal computers have been available since the 1970s, but in the early 
years they were mainly used by businesses, gamers, and hardcore com-
puter geeks. With the advent of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, more 
people came to see personal computers as necessities. Today the computer is 
an indispensable tool for communication, information, and entertainment.
Your Macintosh is ready to communicate, entertain, and retrieve informa-
tion as soon as you take it out of the box. It comes with all the software 
applications you need to send and receive e-mail, browse the Web, or down-
load multimedia. Your Mac even comes with the hardware needed to con-
nect to the Internet in the form of AirPort and an Ethernet network adapter. 
(An Ethernet port is optional on some models.) If you need a modem for 
dial-up Internet, Apple sells one that plugs into your Mac’s USB port.
This chapter shows you how to get started with e-mail and Web browsing. 
In addition to the applications that come with OS X, this chapter also shows 
you how to download and use Firefox, a popular third-party Web browser.
 
 Before you can use e-mail and the Internet, you must have an Internet service account. 
These accounts are provided by Internet service providers (ISPs), of which many are 
probably in your area. If you don’t already have Internet service, check with your tele-
phone and/or cable company to see what services they offer, or look in the phone book 
under Internet Service. Once you are signed up, your ISP should provide specific instruc-
tions for connecting its service.

Figure 8-2: Bookmarking a Web page
Go Online with Safari
 1. Launch Safari by clicking the Safari icon on the Dock or 
by double-clicking its icon in the Applications folder. 
 
 The first time you launch Safari, you’re shown the Top Sites screen. 
Click a thumbnail on this screen to open a Web page. As you browse 
the Internet, Safari remembers your favorite Web sites and auto-
matically replaces the generic top sites with your personal favorites. 
Click the Top Sites button (it looks like a grid of squares) on the 
Safari toolbar to view the Top Sites screen. 
 2. Type a Web address — a uniform resource locator (URL) — 
in the address bar, as shown in Figure 8-1, and then 
press Return to visit the address.
 3. Use these buttons on the Safari toolbar to navigate Web 
pages:
 
• Back: Click the Back button to return to the previ-
ously viewed Web page.
 
• Forward: If you click the Back button, you can click 
the Forward button to return to the page you just left.
 
• Bookmark: Click this button (it looks like a Plus sign 
next to the Web address box) to bookmark a Web 
page. Edit the name of the bookmark and select a 
location from the pop-up menu, such as the 
Bookmarks bar, as shown in Figure 8-2. You can eas-
ily return to the bookmarked page by selecting it 
from the Bookmarks menu on the menu bar.
 
• Reload: Use this button — located on the right side 
of the Web address bar — to reload the current page. 
 4. To change the size of text on the screen, open the View 
menu and choose to make text either bigger or smaller.

 5. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
 6. In the General pane that appears, find the Home Page 
text box and enter the URL for the page you want to use 
as your home page, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
 The home page is the Web page that opens first whenever you

click Set to Current Page.
 7. Click the Security icon at the top of the pane to open 
Security preferences.
 8. Choose the Never option next to Accept Cookies if you 
don’t want to accept cookies from Web sites.
 
 Cookies are files that Web pages save to track your Web browsing 
habits. This may sound bad, but the real risks are minimal. Some 
Web pages may not function correctly when cookies are disabled.
 9. Close the preferences pane when you’re done adjusting 
Safari preferences.
 10. To browse anonymously, choose Safari➪Private 
Browsing.
 
 Private browsing stops Safari from remembering which Web pages 
you’ve visited. This setting is especially valuable if you’re using 
Safari on a public computer, such as in a library or school.
 11. To return to a Web page in History, choose a page from 
the History menu, or click the Show All Bookmarks but-
ton (it looks like an open book) on the far-left side of 
the Bookmarks bar and then choose History in the list 
that appears, as shown in Figure 8-4. Click a page in the

Using MobileMe
O
ne of the coolest things about the Internet is that anyone can publish 
photos, blogs, and other stuff for the whole world to see. If you’d like 
your own online home page, you’re going to need some online real estate 
on which to build it. Many different companies offer online server space, 
but such servers are often costly or difficult to use.
Apple offers online server space, too, and it’s much easier to use than many 
other online services. The Apple online service is MobileMe, and you can 
use MobileMe for both public and private purposes. On the public side, you 
can use MobileMe to publish photos, videos, calendars, and Web pages. On 
the private side, you can use MobileMe to archive important data, as well as 
synchronize your calendars, contacts, and e-mails between multiple Macs, 
PCs, iPhones, and other devices.
An individual MobileMe account costs about $100 per year. This price is 
close to what other online server space companies charge, but with 
MobileMe you get user friendliness and seamless OS X integration for no 
extra charge. You can also try MobileMe for free for 60 days. This chapter 
shows you how to get started with a MobileMe account and how to start 
using some popular MobileMe features.
 
 MobileMe is the successor to Apple’s earlier online service, .Mac. Apple transitioned .Mac accounts 
over to MobileMe accounts in 2008. MobileMe adds support for devices such as the iPhone, iPod 
touch, and even Windows PCs.

Web Designing 
with iWeb
N
ot so long ago, keeping in touch with distant friends and family meant 
writing letters, stuffing envelopes, and licking stamps. And if you 
wanted to share some favorite photos, you had to get expensive film dupli-
cates made by a photo processor.
The Internet has revolutionized the way people keep in touch. E-mail is one 
great way to communicate with distant relations, and you can also create 
your own Web site. When you create a Web page and put it online, anyone 
with Internet access can read your story and see your pictures. And you don’t 
have to be a trained Internet engineer to produce your own Web site, 
because Apple produces a good Web design program called iWeb. iWeb is 
bundled with new Macs, or you can purchase it as part of the iLife suite 
from your favorite Apple retailer.
This chapter shows you how to create and share Web content with iWeb. 
Tasks also show you how to create and share
 ➟ Web pages: On Web pages, you can share stories, blogs, and photo 
galleries on any subject that interests you.
 ➟ Podcasts: A podcast is like a mix between a blog and a radio or TV 
show. You can record your own podcasts, which can then be shared 
with others through iTunes.
 
 Your Web pages must be uploaded to a Web server before others can view them. This 
chapter assumes that you use MobileMe as your Web server. For more on creating and 
using a MobileMe account, see Chapter 9.

righted content and then click Continue when you’re 
sure that your Web site is in compliance with copyright 
laws.

side of the iWeb screen.
 4. Enter the URL for a YouTube video in the YouTube dia-
log that appears, as shown in Figure 10-7.

to copy them from a YouTube Web page that you visit in Safari or 
another Web browser.
 5. Click the Apply button to save the URL and add the 
YouTube widget to your site.
 6. Click and drag the YouTube movie window to a spot on 
the page where it doesn’t cover up other Web page

YouTube dialog box when you have the video window 
positioned where you want it on the page. 
 
 YouTube videos are copyrighted, so only add YouTube videos to 
your Web site if you have permission to do so. You can easily make 
your own movies using iMovie (see Chapter 16) and then upload 
your movies to YouTube. 
 
 You can add your iMovie videos directly to iWeb pages by clicking 
the Movies tab in the Media pane on the right. This avoids the 
YouTube step, but you use up your own MobileMe storage space 
and monthly transfer quota to host the video.

Chapter
Chatting on Your Mac
A
lthough the Internet has been in widespread use for only a little over a 
decade, its roots go all the way back to the late 1960s. One of the earli-
est uses for the Internet was live chat — distant parties typed messages to 
each other in real time. This chat tradition continues today and is made easy 
by instant messaging programs, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), MSN 
Messenger, ICQ, and Apple’s iChat. Not only does iChat give you access to 
the MobileMe network of chat users, but it can be configured to work with 
some other popular instant messaging networks as well. iChat also allows 
you to do screen sharing, which is sometimes used for online meetings or 
technical support. 
In addition to typed text messages, some chat programs now offer voice chat 
as well. Real time voice chat may not seem revolutionary to anyone who has 
ever used a telephone, but the free or nearly free cost of Internet-based voice 
chat appeals to anyone who has ever paid a long distance phone bill. iChat 
can be configured to work with popular voice networks, including Skype 
and Google Talk.
This chapter shows you how to chat via iChat. It also shows you how to 
configure iChat for use with the Google Talk voice networks. Finally, this 
chapter also shows you how to use two third-party chat programs — Skype 
and Adium. Skype is a popular Voice Over IP (VOIP) service, and Adium 
can be used with many of the most popular instant messaging networks, 
including AOL Instant Messenger, MSN, ICQ, Yahoo!, and more.

Using iTunes, iPods, 
and iPhones
M
ore than almost any other company in recent years, Apple has come 
to be identified with digital music. The iPod has emerged as the 
world’s most popular and identifiable MP3 player, and iTunes revolution-
ized online music sales at a time when downloadable songs looked like they 
might be litigated out of existence. Apple’s iPhone packages the best iPod 
technology into a full-featured mobile phone.
iPods, iPhones, and iTunes get along just fine with Windows PCs, but 
because you have a Macintosh, the integration couldn’t be more simple. No 
matter what iPod you have — ranging from a tiny iPod nano to a full size 
(yet still compact) iPhone — it is recognized instantly when you connect the 
device to your Mac. And because iTunes is the program for synchronizing 
music and movies to an iPod or iPhone, it goes without saying that your 
Mac already has the necessary software to sync your device. This chapter 
shows you how to quickly and easily use an iPod or iPhone with your Mac.
Of course, you don’t need an iPod to use iTunes. Even if you have no MP3 
player at all, iTunes is a great program for storing, organizing, and playing 
songs, videos, audio books, podcasts, and other multimedia files. This chap-
ter shows you how to manage and play your multimedia library with 
iTunes. 
 
 To ensure you have the latest version of iTunes, run Software Update, as described in 
Chapter 4, or visit www.apple.com/itunes or choose iTunes ➪ Check for 
Updates.

 When you start to import music, iTunes begins playing the imported 
songs. The import occurs slightly faster if you stop playback.
 7. To locate the imported songs, click Music under Library 
in the iTunes Source pane and then browse the list of art-
ists or albums to find the songs, as shown in Figure 12-2.

Working with Third-
Party MP3 Players
W
hen it comes to MP3 players, Macs and iPods seem to go hand in 
hand. But lots of MP3 players are made by companies other than 
Apple, and if you’re reading this chapter, you probably have one of these 
third-party players.
Because you have one of these players, you may be wondering whether it’s 
compatible with your Mac, especially if the player’s instructions only tell 
you how to use it with a Windows PC. Fortunately, most MP3 players can 
be used with a Mac, although you probably can’t use iTunes for copying 
media files and playlists directly to the player. Instead, you’ll have to use the 
Finder. This chapter shows you how to
 ➟ Connect a third-party MP3 player to your Mac.
 ➟ Copy music files to the MP3 player.
 ➟ Create folders on the MP3 player in which to organize media.
 ➟ Delete music from the MP3 player.
 
 The steps in this chapter apply to most third-party MP3 players, but it’s possible that your 
particular player is uniquely incompatible with your Mac. Some players require propri-
etary software in order to access directories and copy files to the player. If you can’t 
seem to follow the steps in this chapter with your MP3 player, check the manufacturer’s 
Web site for special instructions or information regarding Mac compatibility. A few third-
party players actually support iTunes. If you connect the player to your computer and it 
appears in the Devices list in iTunes, you should be able to use iTunes (see Chapter 12) 
to manage media on the player.

Figure 13-2: A list of some iTunes-compatible players
Connect the MP3 Player to Your Mac
 1. Connect the MP3 player to your Mac’s Universal Serial 
Bus (USB) port.
 2. Look for the player’s icon to appear on your Desktop as 
an Untitled disk volume, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
 If the MP3 player doesn’t appear, make sure the unit’s power is 
turned on.
 3. Before disconnecting the MP3 player from your USB 
port, drag its icon to the Trash icon on the Dock to 
unmount the volume. When the MP3 player’s icon no 
longer appears on the Desktop, you can safely discon-
nect the MP3 player from the USB port.
Check for iTunes Compatibility
 1. To see whether your MP3 player is compatible with 
iTunes, first check the player’s documentation.
 2. If the documentation is unclear, visit this Web site:
 
 http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2172
 
 This page lists some iTunes-compatible players, as 
shown in Figure 13-2.
 3. Visit the manufacturer’s Web site for OS X downloads 
for your MP3 player.
 
 Although some third-party MP3 players may work with iTunes, 
keep in mind that most non-iPod MP3 players can’t play AAC files. 
This means that songs purchased from the iTunes Store won’t work 
in most third-party MP3 players. For other music, convert it to MP3 
format before copying it to a third-party MP3 player.

 2. Launch iTunes and find a song that you’d like to copy 
to the MP3 player. Select only one song for now. Click 
and drag the song to the MP3 player in the Source pane. 
If the file copies successfully, you’re done. Otherwise, 
continue to the next step.
 
 If you’re not sure whether a song’s format is compatible with your 
MP3 player, select the song in iTunes and press Ô+I. An Info 
window opens, showing you information about the song, including 
the file format. MP3 files should be compatible with any MP3 
player, but AAC files are usually compatible only with iPods. 
 3. Choose File➪Show in Finder, as shown in Figure 13-3. 
Finder opens, showing the song you selected, as shown 
in Figure 13-4. 
 
 iTunes usually organizes songs into folders and subfolders by artist 
and album. You may notice that other songs on the same album can 
be found in the Finder window when you open it from iTunes as 
described here. 
 4. Arrange the Finder so that both it and the MP3 player’s 
icon are visible.
 5. Click and drag the songs to the MP3 player’s icon, as 
shown in Figure 13-4. A progress window displays the 
file copying progress.
 
 You can also use the Finder to copy files from your MP3 player to 
your hard drive; simply drag and drop files from the player to a 
hard drive folder to copy them. If some of the files are in WMA 
format, you must download and install Windows Media Player or 
Flip4Mac, as described in Chapter 14.

 5. Use the Finder to copy files into the new folder, as 
described in the preceding section.
 6. Unmount the MP3 player and disconnect it from the 
USB port.
 7. Test the MP3 player to make sure that audio files placed 
in subfolders are recognized and play properly. Some 
MP3 players may not be able to play files that are 
placed in subfolders.
 
 Many MP3 players can be used as thumb drives in a pinch. That is, 
if you have some files, such as PowerPoint presentations or Pages 
documents, and you need to quickly copy those files to another 
computer, you can copy the files to the storage area on an MP3 
player and then connect the MP3 player to the other computer to 
retrieve the files.

Watching Videos 
and DVDs
A
stroll around your local electronics store reveals a lot of cool digital 
gadgets, including TVs, stereo systems, and DVD players. Thankfully, 
you don’t need any of those things because you have a Mac. Most new Macs 
come with built-in DVD player hardware and software.
Of course, DVDs aren’t the only kinds of videos that you’ll want to watch on 
your Mac. You can also download videos from the Internet, and you can 
watch videos recorded by a digital camera or camera phone.
This chapter shows you how to watch DVDs on your Mac as well as how to 
watch other types of video. This chapter focuses on three specific programs:
 ➟ DVD Player: As the name implies, this program allows your Mac to 
play movie DVDs.
 ➟ QuickTime: QuickTime Player is a popular program from Apple that 
allows you to watch videos in various formats, including MPEG and 
QuickTime video.
 ➟ Flip4Mac: This free program works as a plug-in for QuickTime and 
allows you to watch most Windows Media Video (WMV) on your Mac.

Viewing, Organizing, 
and Improving 
Pictures
I
t’s hard to imagine now how anyone ever got by without digital cameras. 
Back in the days of film cameras, photo processing was expensive and 
slow, and if you wanted to improve the quality of your photos, you had to 
just shoot a lot of (expensive) pictures and become a better photographer.
A digital camera won’t make you a great photographer, but it will definitely 
make your life easier. Not only can you snap many photos without worrying 
about processing fees, but you can also quickly copy your digital images to 
your computer, where they can be easily reshaped, retouched, and shared 
with others via e-mail or the Internet.
This chapter shows you how to organize your photos with iPhoto, a pro-
gram included free with your Mac. In addition to organizing photos, iPhoto 
can also make basic edits and improvements to photos. This chapter also 
introduces you to Adobe Photoshop, a more advanced photo editing pro-
gram. The full version of Photoshop costs about $700, but Photoshop 
Elements is available for less than $100 and offers most of the photo editing 
features you’ll need for day-to-day use.
 
 If you need an online home for sharing your digital photos with others over the 
Internet, check out Chapter 9.

Making Movies
A
pple has been a pioneer in digital video for over a decade. In the 
1990s, Apple helped develop the IEEE-1394 FireWire interface, a high-
speed data bus that allows high-quality digital video to be transferred 
quickly between digital camcorders and computers. Apple also pioneered 
software that helps you turn your raw video footage into a great movie with 
titles, music, and special effects.
Many new Macintosh computers come with a FireWire port, and all new 
Macs have iMovie pre-installed. The iMovie application allows you to 
import video from a digital camcorder, assemble a movie with only the 
scenes you want, add sound and video effects to your movie clips, and 
export your finished movie for viewing over the Internet. And if your Mac 
has a SuperDrive, you can also burn your movie straight to DVD.
This chapter shows you how to make movies with your digital camcorder 
and iMovie. I take you through tasks that show you how to create a new 
movie project, capture video from your camcorder, and turn your footage 
into a great movie. The tasks in this chapter also show you how to export 
your finished movie in a Web-friendly format or burn it to DVD.
 
 The latest versions of iMovie support most modern camcorders, including high-definition 
cameras and those that record video onto flash memory, hard drives, or DVDs. For more 
on making movies and working with iMovie, check out Digital Video For Dummies, 4th 
Edition, by Keith Underdahl or iMovie and iDVD For Dummies by Dennis Cohen (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.).

 6. Change the length of the transition using the Duration 
field. The default duration for most transitions is half a 
second. In Figure 16-14, the duration has been changed 
to 1.0s, or one second. 
 
 If you aren’t happy with the style of the transition, click the 
Transition pop-up menu and choose a different transition.
 7. Click Done to close the Inspector and apply your 
changes. 
 8. To remove a transition, click the transition in the Project 
browser and press Delete.
 
 For best results, use transitions sparingly and conservatively. 
Transitions should be used only between major scene changes, not 
between every single clip. Choose transitions that don’t distract 
from the actual video content of your movie. Also, be aware that 
transitions sometimes add time to your movie, which can become 
troublesome if you have a carefully timed soundtrack.

Networking 
Wirelessly with 
AirPort
N
ext to the World Wide Web, few technologies have revolutionized per-
sonal computing in recent years as much as wireless networking. With 
Apple’s emphasis on ease of use, it comes as no surprise that Macs were 
among the first computers to take advantage of networking with no strings 
attached.
AirPort is Apple’s name for its wireless networking products. AirPort gear is 
fully compatible with most other Wi-Fi (also called 802.11Wi-Fi) network-
ing technologies. Your AirPort-equipped MacBook can access the Internet 
through public hotspots and Wi-Fi–equipped Windows PCs can connect to 
your Apple AirPort access point.
This chapter shows you how to configure an AirPort access point to create 
your own wireless network. It also shows you how to connect various 
computers — Windows PCs, Macs, and even iPhones — to a wireless access 
point. This chapter even shows you how to create a wireless ad hoc computer-
to-computer network.
 
 The steps for connecting a computer (whether a Mac or Windows PC) to a wireless access 
point are the same regardless of whether the access point is an Apple AirPort unit or 
another type of Wi-Fi access point. See Chapter 20 for more on setting up wireless net-
work security. For even more on wireless networking, check out Michael E. Cohen’s 
AirPort & Mac Wireless Networks For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

 If the Base Station isn’t detected, click the AirPort icon on your Mac’s 
Title bar and choose Turn AirPort ON in the menu that appears. Make 
sure that the status light on the Base Station is shining solid green. If the 
light is amber or flashing, wait a few more seconds. If after a minute it 
still doesn’t shine solid green, unplug the Base Station for a few seconds 
and then plug it back in. When the light shines solid green, click Try 
Again in the AirPort Setup Assistant. You can also configure the Base 
Station by using an Ethernet-connected computer if the Base Station is 
connected to the same network. 
Figure 17-2: Setting up a new AirPort Base Station
Configure an AirPort Base Station
 1. Connect an Ethernet cable between your broadband 
modem and the AirPort Base Station, if needed.
 
 See the owner’s manual that comes with your Base Station for more 
information on cable connections. Whatever cables you connect, the 
power cord should be the last cable you connect.
 2. Plug in the power cable for the Base Station and wait 
until the status light turns solid green.
 3. Open the Applications folder on your Mac and then 
open the Utilities subfolder.
 4. Double-click the AirPort Utility icon, as shown in 
Figure 17-1.
 5. If your AirPort Base Station appears on the left, select it 
and then click Continue. Otherwise, click the Manual 
Setup button, as shown in Figure 17-2.
 6. Enter a Base Station name and password. You’ll use this 
password when you change Base Station settings.

Figure 17-4: Determining the Internet setup
 8. Enter a name in the Wireless Network Name text box, as 
shown in Figure 17-3.
 
 If you’re adding the Base Station to an existing wireless network, 
the name of the wireless network should be the same as the rest of 
your network. If you’re creating a new network, enter a unique, 
personalized name for the network. 
 9. Choose a security format and enter a network password 
twice. Computers that connect to the wireless network 
must use the correct name and password.
 
 WPA and WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) are the best types of 
security, but older computers and devices (such as game consoles) 
may support only WEP (Wired Equivalency Protocol). Use the high-
est level of security that’s supported by the equipment you own. 
See Chapter 20 for more on wireless network security.
 10. Click Continue and choose whether the AirPort Base 
Station connects to a router or modem. Select the first 
option (as shown in Figure 17-4) if your network 
already has a router or modem that uses Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Otherwise, select the 
I Do Not Use DHCP option and accept the default 
DHCP settings.
 11. Click Continue, verify the setup details, and click 
Update.
 12. After the Base Station restarts and the Congratulations 
screen appears, click Quit. Setup is complete.
 
 The steps described here are the same whether you have an 
AirPort Express or AirPort Extreme Base Station.

 Rearrange your hardware so that interference sources aren’t physi-
cally close to your AirPort access point or your computer.
Troubleshoot a Wireless Connection
 1. Double-check that the AirPort Base Station is turned on, 
and that AirPort is enabled on your Mac, as described 
earlier in this chapter.
 2. Check the signal strength by looking at the AirPort icon 
on the Menu bar. Four bars indicate a strong signal; 
fewer bars mean the signal is weak.
 3. Check to see whether the network is closed. If it’s 
closed, you need to manually enter the network name 
(also called the SSID) and select the security level, as 
shown in Figure 17-15. Network names are case sensi-
tive. See the task called “Access a Closed Wireless 
Network,” earlier in this chapter, for steps.
 4. Connect an Ethernet cable between the AirPort Base 
Station and your computer and then follow the steps I 
describe in the “Configure an AirPort Base Station” task 
to make sure that the access point is configured 
properly.
 5. Make sure that your computer is configured to work 
with DHCP, as I describe in Chapter 18.
 6. Check that your DSL or cable modem is connected 
properly to the WAN (wide area network) or modem 
port on your AirPort access point, as I describe in 
Chapter 18.
 7. If you’re trying to network wirelessly with a Windows 
PC, check that your Mac’s workgroup name is properly 
set, as I describe in Chapter 19.
 8. Look for devices that may cause Wi-Fi signal interfer-
ence, such as microwave ovens or 2.4GHz cordless 
telephones.

Sharing Resources
T
he number one reason to set up a network is to share stuff among your 
various computers. This “stuff” usually includes files, Internet connec-
tions, and printers. Sharing these resources is easy, as is accessing shared 
resources on other network computers.
Before you can share anything, your Mac must be properly connected to the 
network. Chapter 17 shows you how to connect your Mac to a wireless net-
work, and this chapter shows you how to connect to a wired Ethernet net-
work. Ethernet networks aren’t quite as convenient as wireless networks, but 
they offer greater reliability, security, and speed. Most modern Macs include 
adapters for connecting to Ethernet networks. (Some models, such as the 
MacBook Air, require an external Ethernet adapter.)
This chapter shows you how to share printers, files, and Internet connec-
tions with the network after you set it up. The tasks in this chapter also 
show you how to access shared resourced on other networked computers. 
This chapter shows you how to network mainly with other Macintosh com-
puters, although many of the principles apply to Microsoft Windows com-
puters as well. See Chapter 19 for more on networking with Windows PCs.
 
 Sharing Internet connections, as I describe in this chapter, is usually necessary only if you 
have dialup Internet access. For example, if you access a dialup Internet service with the 
modem in your Mac, you can share that connection with the rest of your network if you 
want. If you connect to the Internet with a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL), 
the external modem for that service should be connected to the WAN (wide area net-
work) port on your network’s router.

 If you want to access an Internet connection that’s shared by another 
computer (see the task “Share an Internet Connection,” later in this 
chapter), follow the steps here to configure your network connection. 
The Internet sharing server behaves like a Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) server.
Figure 18-2: The TCP/IP tab
Connect to an Ethernet Network
 1. Connect an Ethernet cable between the Ethernet port on 
your Mac and a local area network (LAN) port on your 
Ethernet switch, hub, or router.
 
 If you need to buy new networking hardware, a router is the easi-
est to configure and provides the greatest flexibility.
 2. Restart your Mac and then open System Preferences 
from the Apple menu.
 3. In System Preferences, click the Network icon.
 4. In the list on the left, select Ethernet, as shown in Figure 
18-1, and then click the Advanced button.
 5. On the TCP/IP tab, as shown in Figure 18-2, choose the 
Using DHCP option from the Configure IPv4 pop-up 
menu.
 6. If a numeric IP address isn’t listed next to IP Address 
(as shown in Figure 18-2), click the Renew DHCP Lease 
button.
 7. Click OK and then Apply to apply your changes.
 
 To connect two computers together directly without using a hub or 
router, you might need to use a special Ethernet cable — a cross-
over cable. Crossover cables are available at most computer retail-
ers. Keep crossover cables clearly marked because they don’t work 
for connecting a computer to a hub or router. Many newer Macs can 
connect directly to each other with a regular network cable; check 
your Mac’s documentation to see whether it has self-configuring 
ports.

Set an IP Address Manually
 1. Open System Preferences from the Apple menu and 
then click the Network icon.
 2. In the list on the left, select Ethernet and then click the 
Advanced button.
 3. On the TCP/IP tab, choose the Manually option from the 
Configure IPv4 pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 18-3.
 
 If your network uses a router or other DHCP server, but you still 
need to assign an Internet Protocol (IP) address manually, choose 
the Using DHCP with Manual Address option from the Configure 
IPv4 pop-up menu instead.
 4. Type an IP address for your computer in the IPv4 
Address field, as shown in Figure 18-4.
 
 On a typical home network, the IP address starts with 192.168.0. 
The final segment can be any number between 0 and 255. Each 
computer on the network must have a unique IP address. Check the 
documentation for your router or server software to see if the IP 
address should be in a specific range. 
 5. Enter a Subnet Mask, which in almost all cases is 
255.255.255.0.
 6. In the Router field, enter the IP address for the router or 
server computer on the network. If you don’t have a 
router, enter the IP address for the computer that con-
nects to the Internet.
 7. Click Apply and then close System Preferences.
 
 Usually you don’t need to set an IP address manually. Only set it 
manually if a network administrator has instructed you to do so, in 
which case you should be provided with a specific IP address to use.

t’s no secret that a majority of PCs in the world run Windows. You may 
even have some Windows PCs of your own. If so, there’s no reason why 
your Macs and PCs can’t live together. Setting up a network between 
Windows PCs and Macs takes only minutes; and after configuration, you 
can easily share files, printers, Internet connections, and other resources 
between the two. This chapter shows you how to network your new Mac 
with Windows PCs as well as with Macs running Mac OS 10.2 or earlier. 
Unless noted otherwise, the steps here assume that you have
 ➟ Windows XP or later: If you have an older version of Windows, you

 When you access a Windows hard drive from a Mac, the Mac OS 
leaves system file fragments called resource forks on the Windows 
hard drive. These files are unnecessary for the Windows operating 
system and can be deleted safely after the Mac has disconnected 
from the Windows PC. See the task on cleaning up resource forks 
later in this chapter for steps to get rid of resource forks.

onnecting your computer to a network brings added convenience to 
your electronic life. Networks let you share files and printers, and they 
allow you to connect easily to the Internet. The Internet is the world’s largest 
network, so every time you connect to it, you’re networking.
But with the added convenience of networking come some dangers. With 
networks, unsavory persons can steal your identity, violate your privacy, 
access your sensitive files, and infect your computer with viruses. You can 
avoid these dangers by taking some simple precautions, and this chapter 
shows you how. This chapter shows you how to
 ➟ Create and use network locations. Network locations allow you to 
quickly switch to a higher level of security when needed, such as when 
you connect to a public Wi-Fi hotspot.
 ➟ Guard against intrusion with a firewall. Firewalls block unwanted 
network and Internet intrusion into your computer.
 ➟ Keep unauthorized users off your wireless network. By changing 
and hiding your SSID (Service Set Identifier), setting up WEP (good) 
or WPA (better) encryption, and fine-tuning your wireless transmitter 
power, you can prevent neighbors and passers-by from accessing your 
network and using your Internet connection.
 ➟ Encrypt files. OS X includes tools to help you encrypt your most 
sensitive files for added protection.

 WPA encryption requires Macintosh OS version 10.3 or later. For 
Windows PCs, handheld devices running Palm OS or Windows 
Mobile, wireless media players, wireless print servers, and other 
Wi-Fi devices, support for WPA depends on the manufacturer of the 
wireless networking adapter. Check the documentation for each 
respective device to make sure that WPA is supported. If any 
wireless device on the network doesn’t support WPA, use WEP until 
you can upgrade the offending unit.
 2. Double-click the AirPort Utility icon, as shown in Figure 
20-13, to launch the utility.
 
 If the AirPort Utility isn’t installed in your Applications:Utilities 
folder, you can install it from the AirPort setup disc that comes with 
your AirPort Base Station.
 3. Select the desired Base Station in the list on the left and 
click the Manual Setup button.
 4. Enter the password for the Base Station and then 
click OK.
 5. In the Base Station configuration pane that appears, 
click AirPort to bring AirPort settings to the front.
 6. Click the Wireless tab.
 7. On the Wireless tab, choose either WPA or WPA2 
Personal from the Wireless Security pop-up menu, as 
shown in Figure 20-14. WPA2 is more secure but it 
might not be supported by some older hardware.
 
8. Type a WPA password in the Wireless password field and 
verify it. The password should be 8–64 characters long.

 12. Fill in the Network Name field, as shown in Figure 
20-16.
 13. Choose WPA2 Personal from the Wireless Security 
pop-up menu.
 
 WPA2 is more secure than WPA, but some early WPA devices don’t 
support WPA2. If you have some older computers or devices that 
can’t connect to a WPA2 network, try using WPA instead. 
 14. Enter the password in the Password field.
 15. Click the Join button to join the network.
 
 If you’re joining a WPA-encrypted network at your workplace or

Connecting to 
Bluetooth Devices
I
f you’ve been using computers for a while, you’re probably familiar 
with (and sick of) the resulting rats nest of wires when computers and 
peripherals are connected. These wires are messy, inconvenient, and prone 
to loss or breakage. Bluetooth is a technology that reduces the clutter and 
inconvenience of wires by connecting devices wirelessly. Wireless cell 
phone headsets are the most common Bluetooth devices, but other 
Bluetooth peripherals include keyboards, mice, handheld computers, 
GPS antennas, and more. You can even create wireless networks between 
computers using Bluetooth, although the short range of Bluetooth (usually 
less than ten meters) makes it best suited for peripherals.
All modern Macs come with Bluetooth technology built-in. (If yours doesn’t, 
you can easily add an external Bluetooth adapter.) This chapter shows you 
how to
 ➟ Make your computer discoverable by other Bluetooth devices, an 
important step in connecting Bluetooth devices.
 ➟ Enable Bluetooth networking so that you can create a temporary 
Bluetooth network with another computer.
 ➟ Create and manage connections — called partnerships — between your 
computer and Bluetooth devices.
 
 Although iPhones have Bluetooth, they work only with select Bluetooth headsets. As of 
this writing, iPhones don’t support Bluetooth networking or file transfer.

Upgrading Your Mac
You’ve probably heard people scoff at the seemingly high price of new 
Macintosh computers. But Apple packs almost every new Macintosh 
with a lot of standard features that would be costly options on most 
Windows PCs. These features include built-in wireless networking, 
Bluetooth, IEEE-1394 FireWire, and enough RAM (random access memory) 
to ensure good computer performance. If you check the price of a Windows 
PC that contains all these features, you might find that the Macintosh is 
actually the better bargain.
Of course, no matter how full-featured your Mac is, you might want a little 
more storage space, screen real estate, or extra RAM to improve the perfor-
mance and utility of your computer. This chapter shows you how to
 ➟ Connect to a second monitor. The second monitor may simply be 
another monitor to give you more on-screen Desktop space, or it may 
be a multimedia projector.
 ➟ Add external storage space. If you work with video or need lots of 
storage space, you can easily attach an external USB or FireWire hard 
drive to your computer. An external hard drive is especially useful as a 
backup location for Time Machine. (See Chapter 3 for more on using 
Time Machine.)
 ➟ Upgrade your computer’s memory. The easiest way to improve the 
performance of your computer is to install more RAM. Upgrading the 
RAM in most Macs is easy, but adding RAM to the Mac mini does 
pose a bit of a challenge, which is why there’s a separate task covering 
just that model.

Figure 22-2: An external drive’s icon on the Desktop
 
 Before you disconnect an external hard drive from your Mac, drag the 
drive’s icon to the Trash to properly unmount the drive from your 
computer.
Add External Storage
 1. Purchase an external hard drive that’s compatible with 
the Macintosh operating system.
 2. Connect the external drive to your computer’s FireWire 
or USB port, as appropriate.
 
 USB hard drives are more common, but FireWire (IEEE-1394) hard 
drives usually offer better performance. If you plan to use the 
external drive for video editing, choose a FireWire drive.
 3. If the drive is formatted using the FAT32 file system 
(check the drive’s documentation), but you don’t plan to 
use the drive with any Windows PCs, open your Mac’s 
Applications folder and then open the Utilities folder. 
Double-click the Disk Utility icon, select the external 
hard drive in the list of drives, and click Erase. Choose 
Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the Format pop-up 
menu, as shown in Figure 22-1, and click the Erase but-
ton in the lower-right corner. Follow the instructions 
on-screen to erase and reformat the hard drive.
 
 Formatting erases all data on the drive. Reformatting the drive 
using the Mac OS Extended file system makes the drive perform 
more efficiently in OS X, but after you do this, you can’t connect the 
drive directly to a Windows PC. Stick with the FAT32 file system if 
you plan to routinely switch the drive back and forth between your 
Mac and a Windows PC.
 4. When formatting is complete, the drive’s icon appears 
on your Desktop, as shown in Figure 22-2. Double-click 
the icon to browse the drive.

Install More RAM
 1. Shut down your computer, unplug it, and remove the 
battery (if applicable).
 2. Purchase the correct type of RAM for your computer.
 
 The owner’s manual for your Mac should tell you the exact format, 
capacity, and type of RAM that should be used in your computer. 
Only use RAM that’s positively identified as being compatible with 
your specific Mac.
 3. Locate the RAM slot on your computer:
 
• Intel-based laptops: Remove the access panel and 
L-bracket inside the battery compartment. 
 
• iMacs: Open the RAM access panel on the back of the 
chassis.
 
• Mac Pros: Remove the side cover for the computer 
case and locate the RAM slots on the motherboard.
 4. Release the RAM module retention clips on the old 
RAM, as shown in Figure 22-3. Pivot the RAM module 
up and remove it from the slot.
 5. Carefully insert the new RAM module, as shown in 
Figure 22-4, making sure that the connector pins and 
plastic guides line up perfectly.
 6. Secure the retention clips and reassemble your 
computer.

Upgrading RAM in a Mac mini
 1. Shut down your Mac mini and unplug it from wall 
power.
 
 If your Mac mini is still covered by warranty, you should have the 
RAM upgraded by a professional. Opening the Mac mini is a complex 
operation, and if you damage anything, your warranty will be void. 
 2. Set the Mac mini upside-down on a clean work surface, 
and use a flat screwdriver or putty knife to carefully pry 
the white plastic bottom of the case away from the 
metal case surround, as shown in Figure 22-5. Work 
your way around the case, prying slowly and patiently. 
 3. When the base is loosened from the surround, turn the 
Mac mini over and lift off the case cover to expose the 
computer. 
 4. Disconnect the two-pin cable connector, as shown in 
Figure 22-6.
 5. Remove a screw at each corner of the bracket that holds 
the DVD drive and hard drive. In Figure 22-6, a screw-
driver is on one of the screws. Put the screws in a safe 
place so you don’t lose them. 
 
 One of the four screws is longer than the others. Make yourself a 
diagram of the computer and make notes to help you remember 
where the longer screw belongs.

 6. Gently take off the AirPort antenna, as shown in Figure 
22-7. Set the AirPort antenna out of the way but leave it 
attached.
 
 Be careful not to unplug the AirPort antenna wire from the mother-
board. It’s difficult to re-attach. 
 7. Carefully rotate the DVD and hard drive assembly up 
and set it down out of the way, as shown in Figure 22-8.
 
 It isn’t necessary to disconnect the ribbon cable attaching the DVD 
and hard drive assembly to the motherboard, but take care not to 
put any strain on the ribbon cable. 
 8. Open the RAM module retention clips, as shown in 
Figure 22-8, and lift the old modules out of the com-
puter. Handle the RAM modules only by the edges. 
 
 Intel-based Mac minis use laptop-style 200-pin DDR2 PC5300 
SO-DIMMs. For best performance in Intel-based Mac minis, use 
either a single RAM module or two matching modules of the same 
size and speed. 
 9. Insert your new RAM modules into the RAM slots. Make 
sure the modules are fully seated in the slots; press them 
down until the retention clips can be snapped back in 
place.
 10. Replace the DVD and hard drive assembly and secure 
the four screws in the correct holes. 
 11. Reconnect the two-pin connector shown earlier in 
Figure 22-6 and put the AirPort antenna back in place. 
 12. Inspect the computer to ensure that everything else is 
still connected properly and then snap the cover back in 
place.

Installing and Using 
Windows Programs
N
ot so long ago, writing about Microsoft Windows in a book about 
Macs would’ve been like school on Saturday: no class. But OS X now 
includes a powerful feature called Boot Camp, which allows you to install 
and run Microsoft Windows on any Macintosh computer that has an Intel 
processor chip.
“Why would I want to install Windows on a perfectly good Mac?” might be 
your first question. In most cases, installing Windows will be a matter of 
need rather than want. Many software companies still develop products only 
for Windows, and you may need to run some of those programs for your 
work or personal needs. To install Windows on your Mac, you need
 ➟ A Macintosh computer running OS 10.5 Leopard or better, and an 
Intel processor chip.
 ➟ A bare minimum of 10GB of free hard drive space for the Windows 
installation. More space may be needed (I recommend at least 
20GB), depending on the requirements of the Windows programs that 
you want to install.
 ➟ A Microsoft Windows installation disc. It must be a single disc full 
version (upgrade discs won’t work) of 32-bit Windows XP (with SP2) 
or Windows Vista. As of this writing, 64-bit versions of Windows 
aren’t supported by Boot Camp.
This chapter shows you how to install and run Windows on your Mac. 
Remember, even though you’ll be running Windows on stable Macintosh 
hardware, the Windows installation will still be susceptible to Windows 
viruses and bugs.

AirPort Apple’s name for 802.11b/g Wi-Fi 
networking technologies. AirPort Extreme is 
equivalent to (and compatible with) 802.11g.
Alias A clickable desktop icon that launches a 
specific program or file. An alias is analogous to 
a shortcut icon in Microsoft Windows.
Apple menu Click the Apple icon in the upper-
left corner of the OS X screen to open this 
menu and access important OS X functions like 
System Preferences, shutdown commands, and 
more.
Bluetooth A technology that allows devices 
(most commonly cell phones or headsets) to 
easily connect to each other wirelessly. All new 
Macs come with built-in Bluetooth radios and 
software.
Boot Camp A component in OS X Snow 
Leopard that allows you to install Microsoft 
Windows on a Macintosh computer with an 
Intel processor.
Dashboard Part of Mac OS X that gives you 
quick access to sticky notes, a calculator, a 
dictionary, a units and measures converter, 
weather and stock reports, and other handy 
tools. Click the Dashboard icon on the Dock 
to open the Dashboard.
Disk Image A virtual disk that can contain files 
and folders. Disk Images can be burned to CD 
or DVD, and software downloads frequently 
come inside of a disk image.
Dock A toolbar normally located at the bottom 
of the OS X screen with buttons for launching 
your favorite programs. The Trash and minimized
program windows are also on the Dock.
Cool Mac OS X Lingo
Ethernet A port that connects your computer 
to a wired Ethernet network or to a broadband 
Internet modem. Ethernet isn’t as convenient 
as wireless AirPort networking, but Ethernet 
is faster and less prone to intrusion by 
unauthorized users.
Exposé An OS X feature that lets you quickly 
see all open windows on your computer. Click 
a window’s silhouette in Exposé to switch to 
that window.
FileVault An OS X tool for encrypting sensitive 
files on your computer.
Firewall A security program that protects your 
computer from unauthorized intrusion over a 
network. OS X has a built-in firewall.
Firewire Also called IEEE-1394, this is a high-
speed port technology developed by Apple 
in the 1990s. Firewire is most often used with 
digital video cameras, but it’s also used for 
external hard drives and other peripherals. 
Most modern Macs have Firewire ports.
Front Row A simple menu giving quick access 
to your iTunes Library, your iPhoto picture 
collection, videos, the DVD player, and more. 
Press the Menu button on your Apple Remote 
to access Front Row.
MobileMe A service offered by Apple which 
includes Web-accessible e-mail accounts, photo 
and Web page hosting, and even online storage 
space for file exchange and backup. MobileMe 
was formerly known as .Mac.
Spaces A component of OS X that helps you 
arrange multiple workspaces that you can open 
or close depending on the kind of work you 
plan to do.
Spotlight A search tool in OS X that searches 
everything on your computer, including e-mails, 
Web pages, and files.
SuperDrive A drive capable of recording CDs 
and DVDs. Using a SuperDrive, you can burn 
your own movie DVDs, as well as data DVDs for 
backing up large files.
System Preferences Like the Control Panel in 
Microsoft Windows, this is where you access 
system settings on your Mac. You can access 
System Preferences from the Apple menu or 
the Dock.
Time Machine A powerful feature in OS X that 
helps you quickly restore your computer to an 
earlier state or recover older versions of files if 
you encounter a problem.
Trash Deleted files go to the Trash, where they 
can be recovered if needed (unless the Trash has 
been emptied). You also unmount removable 
discs and drives by dragging them to the 
Trash. The Recycle Bin in Microsoft Windows is 
modeled after the OS X Trash.
USB Short for Universal Serial Bus, this port 
allows you to easily attach input devices, 
cameras, iPods, printers, and many other 
peripherals to your computer.
Widget A simple little program that resides on 
the OS X Dashboard. OS 10.6 Snow Leopard lets 
you easily create your own Dashboard widgets.
Windows File Sharing An OS X feature that 
allows you to easily network and share files 
with computers running Microsoft Windows.
