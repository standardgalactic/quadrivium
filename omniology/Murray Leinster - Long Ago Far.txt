CHAPTER 1
THE sky was black, with myriads of stars. The ground was white. But it was not really ground at all, it
was ice that covered everything—twenty miles north to the Barrier, and southward to the Pole itself, past
towering mountains and howling emptiness and cold beyond imagining.
The base was almost buried in snow. Off to one side of the main building a faint yellowish glow was the
plastic dome of the meteor-watch radar instrument. Inside Brad Soames displayed his special equipment
to a girl reporter flown down to the Antarctic to do human-interest articles for not-too-much-interested
women readers.
All was quiet. This seemed the most unlikely of all possible places for anything of importance to happen.

There was one man awake, on stand-by watch. A radio glowed beside him—a short-wave unit, tuned to
the frequency used by all the bases of all the nations on Antarctica—English, French,  Belgian, Danish,
Russian. The stand-by man yawned. There was nothing to do.
"There's no story  in my work,"  said  Soames  politely. "I work  with  this  wave-guide  radar.  It's  set  to
explore the sky instead of the horizon. It spots meteors coming in from space,  records  their height and
course and speed, and follows them down until they burn up in the air. From its record we can figure out
the orbits they followed before Earth's gravity pulled them down."
The girl reporter  was  Gail  Haynes.  She  nodded,  but  she  looked  at  Soames  instead  of  the  complex
instrument. She wore the multi-layer cold-weather garments issued for Antarctica, but somehow she did
not look grotesque in them. Now her expression was faintly vexed.  The third person  in the dome  was
Captain Estelle Moggs, W. A. C., in charge of Gail's journey and the public-relations angle generally.
"I just chart the courses of meteors," repeated Soames. "That's all. There is nothing else to it."
Gail shook her head, watching him.
"Can't you give me a human angle?" she asked. "I'm a woman. I'd like to be interested."
He shrugged, and she said somehow disconsolately:
"What will knowing the orbits of meteors lead to?"
"Finding out some special meteor-orbits," he said drily, "might lead to finding out when the Fifth Planet
blew itself  up.—According  to  Bode's  Law  there  ought  to  be  a  planet  like  ours  between  Mars  and
Jupiter. If there was, it blew itself to pieces, or maybe the people on it had an atomic war."
Gail cocked her head to one side.
"Now, that promises!" she said. "Keep on!"
"There ought to  be  a  planet  between  Mars  and  Jupiter,  in  a  certain  orbit,"  he  told  her.  "There  isn't.
Instead, there's a lot of debris floating around. Some is as far out as Jupiter. Some is as far in as Earth.
It's mostly between Mars and Jupiter, though, and it's hunks of rock and metal of all shapes  and  sizes.
We call the big ones asteroids. There's no proof so far, but it's respectable to believe that there used to
be a Fifth Planet, and that it blew itself up or was blown up by its inhabitants. I'm checking meteor-orbits
to see if some meteors are really tiny asteroids."
"Hmmm," said Gail. She displayed one of those surprising, unconnected bits of information a  person  in
the  newspaper  business  picks  up.  "Don't  they  say  that  the  mountains  on  the  moon  were  made  by
asteroids falling on it?"
"It's at least possible that the moon was smashed up by fragments of the Fifth Planet," agreed  Soames.

"In fact, that's a more or less accepted explanation."
She looked at him expectantly. "I have to think of my readers," insisted Gail. "It's interesting enough, but
how can  I make  it something they'll be  concerned  about?  When the moon was  smashed,  why wasn't
Earth?"
"It's assumed that it was," Soames told her. "But on Earth we have weather, and it happened a long, long
time  ago,  back  in  the  days  of  three-toed  horses  and  ganoid  fish.  Undoubtedly  once  the  Earth  was
devastated  like  the  moon.  But  the  ring-mountains  were  worn  away  by  rain  and  snow.  New
mountain-ranges rose up. Continents changed. Now there's no way to find even the traces of a disaster
so long past. But the moon has no weather. Nothing ever changes on it. Its wounds have never healed."
Gail frowned in concentration.
"A bombardment like that would be something to live through," she said vexedly. "An atomic war would
be trivial by comparison. But it happened millions and millions of years ago. We women want to  know
about things that are happening now!"
Soames opened his mouth to speak. But he didn't.
The flickering, wavering, silver-plated wave-guide tube of the radar suddenly steadied. It ceased to hunt
restlessly among all places  overhead  for a  tiny object  headed  for Earth.  It  stopped  dead.  It  pointed,
trembling a little as if with eagerness. It pointed somewhere east of due south, and above the horizon.
"Here's a meteor. It's falling now," said Soames.
Then he looked again. The radar's twin screens should have shown two dots of light, one to register the
detected object's height, and another its angle and distance. But both screens were empty. They showed
nothing at all. There was nothing where the radar had stopped itself and where it aimed. But all of the two
screens glowed faintly. The graph-pens wrote wholly meaningless indications on their tape. A radar, and
especially a  meteor-tracking  radar,  is an instrument of high precision.  It  either  detects  something  and
pin-points its place, or it doesn't, because an object either reflects radar-pulses or not. Usually it does.
The radar  here,  then,  gave an impossible reading.  It  was  as  if it did not receive  the reflections of the
pulses it sent out, but only parts of them. It was as if something were intermittently in existence, or  was
partly real  and  partly not.  Or  as  if the radar  had  encountered  an almost-something which was  on the
verge of becoming real, and didn't quite make it.
"What the—"
The inter-base radio screamed. At the same  instant the twin radar-screens  flashed bright all over.  The
twin pens of the tape-writing machine scrambled crazy lines on the paper. The noise was monstrous. A
screaming, shrieking uproar such as no radio ever gave out. There was horror  in it. And what Soames
could not know now was that at this same instant the same sound came out of every radio and television
set in use in all the world.

The noise stopped. Now a bright spot showed on each of the meteor-watch  radar's  twin screens.  The
screen indicating height said that the source of the dot was four miles high. The screen indicating line and
distance said that it bore 167° true, and was eighty miles distant.  The radar  said  that  some  object  had
come into being from nothingness, out of nowhere.  It  had  not arrived.  It  had  become.  It  was  twenty
thousand feet high, eighty miles 167° from the base, and its appearance had been accompanied by such a
burst of radio-noise as neither storm nor lightning nor atomic explosion had ever made before.
And the thing which came from nowhere and therefore was quite impossible, now moved toward the east
at roughly three times the speed of sound.
All manner of foreign voices came startledly out of the inter-base radio speaker, asking what could it be?
A Russian voice snapped suspiciously that the Americans should be queried.
And the wave-guide radar followed a large object which had come out of nowhere at all.
The sheer  impossibility of the thing was  only part  of the problem  it presented.  The radar  followed  it.
Moving eastward, far away in the frigid night, it seemed  suddenly to  put on brakes.  According  to  the
radar, its original speed was close to mach 3, thirty-nine miles a minute. Then it checked swiftly. It came
to a complete stop. Then it hurtled backward along the line it had followed. It wabbled momentarily as if
it had done a flip-flop four miles above the ground. It dived. It stopped dead in mid-air for a full second
and abruptly began to rise once more in an insane, corkscrew course which ended abruptly in a headlong
fall toward the ground.
It dropped  like a  stone.  It  fell for long, long seconds.  Once  it wavered,  as  if it made  a  final effort to
continue its frenzy in the air. But again it fell like a stone. It reached the horizon. It dropped behind it.
Seconds  later  the ground trembled  very,  very slightly. Soames  hit  the  graph-machine  case.  The  pens
jiggled. He'd made a time-recording of an earth-shock somewhere.
Now he read off the interval between the burst of screaming static and the jog he'd made by striking the
instrument. Earth-shock surface waves travel at four miles per second. The radar had said the thing which
appeared  in  mid-air  did  so  eighty  miles  away.  The  static-burst  was  simultaneous.  There  was  a
twenty-second interval between the static and the arrival of the earth-tremor  waves.  The static  and  the
appearance  of something from nowhere  and  the point of origin of the earth-shock  matched  up.  They
were one event. The event was timed with the outburst of radio noise, not the impact of the falling object,
which was a minute later.
Soames  struggled  to  imagine  what  that  event  could  be.  The  inter-base  radio  babbled.  Somebody
discovered that the static had been on all wave-lengths at the same time. Voices argued about it.
In the radar-dome Captain Moggs said indignantly:
"This is monstrous! I shall report this to Washington! What was that thing, Mr. Soames?"

Soames shrugged.
"There isn't anything it could be," he told her. "It was impossible. There couldn't be anything like that."
Gail cocked her head on one side.
"D'you mean it's something new to science?"
Soames realized how much he liked Gail. Too much. So he spoke  with great  formality. The radar  had
tried to detect and range on something that wasn't there. The nearest accurate statement  would be  that
the radar had detected something just before it became something the radar could detect, which did not
begin to make sense.
Planes didn't appear in mid-sky without previously having been somewhere else; it wasn't a plane. There
could be meteors, but it wasn't a meteor because it went too slowly and changed course and stood still in
the air and went upward. Nor was it a missile. A ballistic missile couldn't change course, a rocket-missile
would show on the radar.
He looked at his watch.
"Six minutes and  a  half from the static,"  he said  grimly. "Eighty miles. Sound  travels  a  mile every  five
seconds. Let's listen. Ten seconds—eight—six—four—"
Now the wave-guide radar had gone back  to  normal operation.  Its  silver-plated  square  tube  flickered
and quivered and spun quickly in this direction and that, searching all the sky.
There was  a  booming  sound.  It  was  infinitely  low-pitched.  It  was  long-continued.  It  was  so  low  in
frequency that it seemed more a vibration of the air than a sound.
It died away.
"It's a  concussion-wave,"  said  Soames  soberly.  "It arrived  four hundred  odd  seconds  after  the  static.
Eighty miles.... A noise has to be pretty loud to travel so far! A ground-shock has to be rather sharp to
be felt as an earth-tremor at eighty miles. Even a spark has to be very, very fierce to mess up radio and
radar  reception  at  eighty  miles....  Something  very  remarkable  happened  down  yonder
tonight—something somebody ought to look into."
Gail said quickly, "How about a spaceship from another world?"
"It would have come in from outer space," said Soames. "It didn't."
"A  secret  weapon,"  said  Captain  Moggs  firmly.  "I  shall  report  to  Washington  and  ask  orders  to
investigate."
"I wouldn't," said  Soames.  "If you ask  orders  you promise  to  wait  for  them.  If  you  wait  for  orders,

whatever fell will be covered by snow past discovery by the time your orders come."
Gail looked at him interestedly, confidently.
"What will you do, then?"
"I think," said Soames, "we'll find it and then report.
"You were planning a cosey little article on Housewives of the Antarctic; The Care and Feeding of One's
Penguin Husband. Right?"
Gail grinned suddenly.
"I see. Yes."
"We take off in the 'copter," said Soames. "We start out ostensibly to  gather  material for an article on
Can  This  Penguin  Marriage  Be  Saved.  But  we'll  be  blown  off  course.  We'll  find  ourselves  quite
accidentally where the radar said there was the great-grandfather of static  bursts,  with a  ground-shock
and a concussion-wave to boot. We may even be blown farther, to where something dived  downward
for four or five miles and vanished below the horizon."
Captain Moggs said uneasily:
"Most irregular. But it might be wise."
"Of course," said Soames. "It's always safer  to  report  something you've  found than not find something
you've reported."
"We start at sunrise," said Captain Moggs authoritatively.
Soames went back to the radar. As he looked at it, it picked out something rather smaller than a marble
at a height of seventy-nine miles and followed that unthinkably ancient small wanderer of space down to
its spectacular suicide by fire at a height of thirty-four miles.
He went painstakingly over the radar. It worked perfectly. The taped record of its observations carried
the story of all that Gail and Captain Moggs had seen when he saw it. Machinery may err, but it does not
have delusions. It would have to be  subject  to  systematic  hallucination to  have reported  and  recorded
what this radar insisted was the truth.
When dawn came, he went out to the helicopter's hangar. There was a supply-plane on the runway, but
the  helicopter  belonged  at  the  base.  He  found  himself  excessively  conscientious  in  his  check-over.
Though he hated to admit it, he knew it was because Gail would be in the plane.
When he  headed  back  toward  the  main  building  one  of  the  geophysics  gang  beckoned  to  him.  He

followed to the small, far-spaced hut—now snow-buried to its eaves—in which the seismograph ticked
away to itself.
"I think I'm going crazy," said the geophysics man. "Did you ever hear of a ground-shock starting inside
out?"
He pointed to the graph-paper that fed very, very slowly past the seismograph's pens. The recording did
look odd.
"If  you  put  your  hand  just  under  the  surface  of  the  water  in  a  bathtub,"  said  the  geophysics  man
harassedly, "and jerk it downward, you get a hollow that spreads out with a wave behind it. It's the exact
opposite  of dropping  a  pebble  into  water,  which  makes  a  wave  that  spreads  out  with  a  hollow—a
trough—behind  it.  But  except  for  that  one  way  of  making  it,  all  waves—absolutely  all
wave-systems—start  out with a  crest  and  a  trough behind it. Everywhere,  all the time, unless you do
what I said in a bathtub."
"I'm a shower man, myself," observed Soames. "But go on."
"This," said the geophysics man bitterly, "is like a bathtub wave. See? The ground was jerked away, and
then pushed back. Normal shock-waves push away and then spring back! An ice-crack, a rock-slide, an
explosion of any sort,  all of them make  the same  kind of waves!  All  have  compression  phases,  then
rarefaction phases, then compression phases, and so on. What—" his voice was plaintive—"what in hell
is this?"
"Are  you  saying,"  Soames  asked  after  a  moment,  "that  ordinary  earth-tremors  record  like
explosion-waves, but that you'd have to have an implosion to make a record like this?"
"Sure!" said the geophysics man. "But how can you have an implosion that will make an earth-shock? I'm
going to have to take this whole damned wabble-bucket apart to find out what's the matter with it! But
there's nothing the matter! It registered what it got! But what did it get?"
"An implosion," said Soames. "And if you have trouble imagining that, I'm right there with you."
He went back to the main building to get Gail and Captain Moggs. They went out to the 'copter hangar
together.
"I've talked to the radar and  loran operator,"  said  Soames.  "I explained that  you wanted  to  see  some
crevasses from the air, and I'd be wandering around looking for them on the way to the rookery. He will
check on us every fifteen minutes, anyhow."
The 'copter  went up the long, sloping, bulldozed snow-ramp.  Soames  checked  his radio  contact.  He
nodded. The engines hummed and roared and bellowed, and the ship lifted deliberately and floated away
over the icy waste.

The little helicopter was very much alone above a landscape which had never known a growing thing.
Soames kept in radar contact and when he was ready he told the base,  "I'm going down  now,  hunting
crevasses."
He  let  the  'copter  descend.  The  waste  was  featureless,  then  and  for  a  seemingly  interminable  time
afterward.
 Then
 his
 estimated
 position
 matched
 the
 site
 of
 the
static-earth-shock-concussion-wave-occurrence.  There  seemed  nothing  about  this  part  of  the
snow-desert which was different from any other part. No. Over to the left. A wind-pattern showed in the
snow. It was already being blown away; its edges  dulled. But it was  rather  far from a  probable  thing.
There  were  lines—hollows—where  gusts  had  blown  at  the  snow's  surface.  They  were  spiral  lines,
tending toward a center. They had not the faintest resemblance to the crater of an explosion which might
have made an earth-shock.
Soames took a camera out of its place in the 'copter. Gail stared down.
"I've seen something like that," she said puzzledly. "Not a  picture.  Certainly not a  snow-field.  I think it
looks like a diagram of some sort."
"Try  a  storm-wind  diagram,"  said  Soames  drily.  "The  way  a  cyclone  ought  to  look  from  directly
overhead. The meteorology boys will break down and cry when they see this picture!"
He took pictures. The shadows of the wind-made indentations would come out clearly in the film.
"Unless," said Soames, "unless somebody got a snap of a whirlwind touching a snow-field and bouncing
up again, this will be  a  photographic  first. It's  not an explosion-pattern,  you'll notice.  Wind and  snow
weren't thrown away from the center. They were drawn toward it. Momentarily. It's an explosion inside
out, an implosion-pattern to be more exact."
"I don't understand," said Gail.
"An explosion," said Soames grimly, "is a bursting-out of a suddenly present mass of gas. An implosion is
a bursting-in of a suddenly present vacuum. Set off a firecracker and you have an explosion.  Break  an
electric bulb and you have an implosion. That pattern behind us is an implosion-pattern."
"But how could such a thing be?"
"If we knew," said Soames wrily, "maybe we'd be running away. Maybe we should."
The 'copter droned on and on and on. The ice-sheet continued unbroken.
"There!" cried Gail, suddenly.
She pointed.  Blowing snow  hid  everything.  Then  there  was  a  hole  in  the  whiteness,  a  shadow.  The

shadow stirred and an object too dark to be snow appeared. It vanished again.
"There's a sheltered place!" said Gail, "and there's something dark in it!"
Soames pulled the microphone to his lips.
"Calling base,"  he said  briefly. "Calling  base....  Hello!  I'm  well  beyond  the  last  radar-fix.  I  think  I'm
bearing about one seven oh degrees  from base.  Get  a  loran fix on me. Make  it quick.  I may have to
land."
He listened, pressing a button to activate the loran-relay which would transmit a signal on signal from the
base,  so  the  bearing  and  distance  could  be  computed  back  at  base.  It  was  wiser  to  have  such
computations done aground. He readied the camera again.
Gail looked through the 'copter's binoculars. The peculiar shadow—hole—opening in the blowing snow
reappeared.  Something in it looked  like a  missile, only it was  bright metal and  much too  large.  It  lay
askew on the ice. A part of it—a large part—was smashed.
"Spaceship?" asked Gail, "do you think that's it?"
"Heaven forbid!" said Soames.
There  was  movement.  One—two—three  figures  stared  up  from  beside  the  metal  shape.  A  fourth
appeared. Soames grimly took pictures. Gail gasped suddenly:
"They're not men!" she said  shakily. "Brad,  they're  children! Queerly  dressed  children, with bare  arms
and legs! They're out there on the snow! They'll freeze! We've got to help them!"
"Calling base,"  said  Soames  into the microphone.  "I'm landing.  I  have  to.  If  I  don't  report  in  twenty
minutes come with caution—repeat with caution—to see what's happened. I repeat. If I do not report in
twenty minutes come with caution, caution, caution to see what is the matter."
The 'copter made a loud, loud noise as it went skittering down toward the object—and the children—on
the ice.
CHAPTER 2
THE snow-mist  blew aside  and  there  was  plainly a  ship lying partly crushed  upon  the  snow.  Half  its
length was smashed, but he could see that it had never flown with wings. There weren't any.
"It looks like a spaceship," said Gail breathlessly.

Soames spoke between set teeth.
"That would finish things for all of us!"
And it would,  without  any  qualifications.  On  a  world  already  squabbling  and  divided  into  two  main
power-groups and embittered neutrals; on a world armed with weapons so deadly that only the fear  of
retaliation kept the peace.... Contact with a farther-advanced race  would not unite humanity, either for
defense or for the advantages such a contact might reasonably bring. Instead,  it would detonate  hatred
and suspicion into madness.
A higher civilization could very well tip the scales, if it gave one side weapons. The world outside the Iron
Curtain  could  not  risk  that  the  Iron  Curtain  nations  become  best  friends  of  possible  invaders.  The
communist leaders could not risk letting the free  nations make  alliance with a  higher technology and  a
greater science. So actual contact with a more-advanced race would be the most deadly happening that
could take place on the world as it was today.
Soames jumped out. He looked at the ship and felt sick. But he snapped a quick photograph. It had no
wings and had never owned any. It had been probably a hundred feet long, all bright metal. Now nearly
half of it was crushed or crumpled by its fall. It must have been brought partly under control before the
impact, though, enough to keep it from total destruction. And Soames, regarding it, saw  that  there  had
been  no propellers  to  support  it or  pull it through the air.  There  were  no  air-ducts  for  jet-motors.  It
wasn't a jet.
There were no rockets, either. The drive was of a kind so far unimagined by men of here and now.
Gail stood beside Soames, her eyes bright. She exclaimed, "Brad! It isn't cold here!"
The children looked at her interestedly. One of the girls spoke politely, in wholly unintelligible syllables.
The girls might be thirteen or  thereabouts.  The boys  were  possibly  a  year  older,  sturdier  and  perhaps
more muscular than most boys of that age. All four were wholly composed. They looked curious but not
in the least alarmed, and not in the least upset, as they'd have been had older companions been injured or
killed in the ship's landing. They wore brief garments that would have been quite suitable for a children's
beach-party in mid-summer, but did not belong on the Antarctic ice-cap at any time. Each  wore  a  belt
with moderately large metal insets placed on either side of its fastening.
"Brad!" repeated Gail. "It's warm here! Do you realize it? And there's no wind!"
Soames swallowed. The camera hung from his hand.  It  either was  or  it could  be  a  spaceship  that  lay
partly smashed  upon the ice.  He  looked  about  him with a  sort  of  total  grimness.  There  was  a  metal
girder, quite separate  from the ship, which had  apparently  been  set  up  slantingly  in  the  ice  since  the
landing. It had no apparent purpose.
Captain Moggs said peremptorily:
"Children! We insist on speaking to your parents! At once!"

Gail moved forward. Soames saw, now, a small tripod near the ship. Something spun swiftly at its top. It
had plainly been brought out from inside the strange vessel. For a hundred yards in every direction there
was no wind or snow. More than that, the calm air was also warm. It was unbelievable.
"Do you hear me?" demanded Captain Moggs. "Children!"
Gail said in a friendly fashion, smiling at the girls:
"I'm sure you don't understand a word I say, but won't you invite us to visit?"
Her tone and manner were plainly familiar to the children. One of the two girls smiled and stood aside for
Gail to enter the ship. Soames and Captain Moggs followed.
It was quite as bright inside the ship as out-of-doors. There were no lights. It was simply bright. A part of
the floor had buckled upward, and the rest was not level, but the first impression was of brilliance and the
second was of a kind of simplicity which was bewildering. And there was a third. It  was  of haste.  The
ship seemed to have been put together with such urgent haste that nothing had been done for mere finish
or decoration.
"I want to speak to the parents of these children!" said Captain Moggs firmly. "I insist upon it!"
"I suspect,"  said  Soames  grimly,  "that  in  the  culture  these  children  came  from,  the  proper  place  for
parents is the home. This is a child-size spaceship, you'll notice."
The size of the door and chairs proved it. He saw through a crumpled, open doorway into the crushed
part of the ship. There was machinery in view, but no shafts or gears or power-leads. He guessed it to be
machinery because it could not be anything else. He saw a  dented  case  of metal, with an opened  top.
The boys  had  apparently  dragged  it into the relatively  undamaged  part  of  the  ship  to  work  upon  its
contents. He could see coils of bare  metal, and  arrangements  which might have been  inductances.  He
took a sort of forlorn pride in guessing that the thing was some sort of communication-device.
There was a board with buttons on it. It might be a control-board, but it didn't look like it. There was a
metal box with a transparent plastic front. One could see cryptic shapes of metal inside. Two bright-metal
balls mounted on a side-wall. They had holes in them, about the right size for the hands of children like
these to enter. There was a two-foot, carefully machined spiral of metal, intruding into and lessening the
living-space of the ship. These things had functions he could not even guess at. He found himself resentful
of things which were obviously the developments of science, and he could not even guess what they were
for.
But alien? He looked at the boys. They were human children. They had absolutely nothing of strangeness
about  them. Their hair, their eyes  and  eyelashes  were  normal. Their noses.  Their  lips.  Their  teeth.  In
every respect they were as human as he was, or Gail.
He looked to the most urgent problem of the moment. He snapped pictures, before anything else.

One of the boys turned to the dented metal case. He began to arrange  its contents  in a  somehow  final
fashion. Soames guessed that it had been damaged in the landing, and they'd made a repair.
The  second  boy  touched  Soames'  elbow  and  showed  him  the  box  with  the  clear  plastic  front.  He
touched it, and an image appeared in the plastic. It was an image of the landscape outside. He shifted the
box,  and  the  landscape  image  flashed  sidewise.  He  touched  another  control.  The  landscape  flowed
swiftly toward  the  viewer.  It  raced.  Presently  the  ground  seemed  to  drop  away  and  Soames  found
himself staring at a picture which showed the ice-sheet and the sky and—very far away—the dark blue
line which was the sea, now a hundred miles distant.
The boy nodded and made delicate adjustments.  Then Soames  looked  at  an image of the Gissell Bay
base from which he and the others had set out an hour before. It was a remarkably clear image. Soames
could even see the supply-plane waiting on the runway until it was time for take-off. He knew unhappily
that the box was something which was not a radar, but performed all the functions of one and so many
others that it was a different thing entirely.
Then Gail said:
"Brad! Look at this!"
She held out two necklaces that the girls had given her. She showed him the ornaments at their ends. One
was a  very tiny horse.  It  was  beautifully done,  and  obviously from life. The head  was  larger  than  an
ordinary horse's head would be. The body was lightly built. Each of its tiny feet had three toes.
Gail watched Soames' face.
"You see? How about this?"
The ornament of the other necklace was a tiny metal fish. It had fins and a tail, but no scales. Instead, its
body was  protected  by bony armor.  It  was  a  ganoid fish, like a  sturgeon.  But it was  not a  sturgeon,
though sturgeons are now the main representatives of what once were innumerable ganoid species.
Soames  shook  his head,  then spoke  to  Gail and  Captain  Moggs.  "The ship  was  built  for  children  to
operate, I can't imagine why. But there's nothing like a weapon in view. I'm going to call Base before they
get alarmed."
He made a report which sounded as if there were some minor trouble with the 'copter and he'd landed. It
did not check with his last call speaking insistently of caution, but he couldn't help it. Other bases were on
the same wave-length. He said he'd call back. He intended to call for help—in handling the matter of the
children—as soon as it would seem plausible that he needed help to get off the ground again.
But he felt shaky, inside. The radar-report and the static  and  earth-shock  and  concussion-wave  of the
night before  had  been  improbable  enough. But this was  more  incredible still. The children's  ship must
have appeared in the middle of all those unlikely phenomena.  It  was  reasonable  for it to  have crashed
amid such violence. But where had it come from, and why?

They were human and they were members  of a  culture beside  which the current  culture on Earth was
barbaric. It could not be an Earth civilization. On a world where for thousands of years men had  killed
each other untidily in wars, and where they now prepared  to  destroy  themselves wholly in a  final one,
there was no possibility of such a civilization existing in secret. But where was it?
Soames stood by the 'copter, staring bemusedly at the ship. The two boys came out. They went briskly
to the shattered part of the ship and picked up a metal girder neatly matching the one that leaned absurdly
where it was fixed in the icy surface. By the ease  of their movements, it could  not be  heavy. It  would
have to be aluminum or magnesium to be so light. Magnesium alloy, at a guess.
One boy held it upright by the slanting beam. The other produced a small object Soames could not see.
He bent over the ice and moved his hand to and fro. The new girder sank into the ice. They slanted it to
meet the one already fixed. They held it fast for a moment. They went back  to  the wrecked  ship. The
second girder remained fixed, like the first one.
Soames went to look. The metal beam was deeply imbedded in the ice which somehow did not chill the
air above it.
He heard a small sound. One of the boys, the one in the brown, tunic-like shirt, swept something across
the plating of the crumpled vessel. The plating parted like wet paper. Soames watched in a sort of neither
believing nor unbelieving detachment. A whole section of plating came away. The boy in the brown tunic
very  briskly  trimmed  plating  away  from  a  strength-member  and  had  a  third  metal  beam.  Whatever
instrument he used, it cut metal as if it were butter.
Both boys brought the third beam to where the others leaned to form a tripod. But this third bit of metal
was curved. They lowered it, and the boy in the brown  tunic matter-of-factly  sliced through the metal,
took out a V-shaped piece, and obviously made the rest of the metal whole once  more.  They raised  it
again, the boy moved his hand over the ice, it sank into it, they held it a moment only, and went off to the
ship.
Soames went numbly to see what had happened. He picked up scraps of the trimmed-away metal.
Soames  puzzled over  the metal scraps.  They did not look  cut.  They had  mirror-bright  surfaces,  as  if
melted apart. But there'd been no flame....
The boys reappeared with the dented case that Soames guessed was a communication device  of some
sort. They carried it to the new tripod. One of them carried, also, a complicated structure of small rods
which could be an antenna-system to transmit radiation of a type that Soames could not conceive of.
Captain Moggs came towards him from the 'copter.
"I called Base," she said. "Two snow-weasels will start here  within the hour.  Another  'copter  is due  in
from an advanced observation post at any moment. It will be sent here as soon as it arrives."
Soames wondered numbly just how indiscreet  she'd  been,  in a  short-wave  conversation  that  could  be
picked up by any of the other-nation bases that cared to  listen in. But, just then,  Gail came  out of the

ship.
"Brad," she said anxiously, "what are the boys doing?"
Soames  knew  only  too  well.  If  the  dented  case  contained  a  communicator,  which  would  use  so
complicated an antenna as lay ready for use, there could only be one answer. And there could  be  only
one thing for him to do, considering everything.
"They're shipwrecked. They're setting up something to signal for help with. They've landed on a world of
rather primitive savages and they want somebody to come and take them away."
"It mustn't be permitted!" said Captain Moggs firmly. "The ship must be examined! In our modern world,
with the military situation what it is...."
Soames looked at her ironically.
He had metal scraps in his hand, those he'd picked up to examine as a savage might examine sawdust.
There was a threadlike extension of metal from one scrap. He twisted it off and put it on his sleeve. He
struck a light with his cigarette lighter. He touched it to the fibre of metal. There was a burst of flame. His
sleeve was singed.
"Mostly magnesium," he said detachedly. "It's possible that they don't think of fire as a danger. They may
not use fire any more. We don't light our houses with open flames any longer. They may not use flames at
all. But I'm a savage. I do."
He sorted through the bits of silvery metal. Another morsel had a wire-like projection. He saw the boy
with the green tunic laying something on the snow, from the ship to the tripod.
"A power-line," he said appalled. "They've got to signal nobody knows how far, with nobody can guess
how much power in the signal. And they use power-leads the size of sewing-thread!  But of course  the
people who built this ship would have superconductors!" Then he said, "I may be committing suicide, but
I think I ought to, rather than let ..."
He moved forward. His throat was dry. He struck his lighter and touched the flame to the thread of metal
on the second scrap. It flared. He threw the whole piece  just as  all the flammable alloy caught fire. In
mid-air it became a ball of savage white incandescence that grew larger and fiercer as it flew. It was a full
yard in diameter when it fell upon the dented case the boys had brought here.
That burst into flame. The new-made tripod  caught.  Flame leaped  thirty feet  into the air.  Soames  was
scorched and blinded by the glare. Then the fire died swiftly and snow-white ash-particles drifted down
on every hand.
The boy  in the brown  tunic cried  out fiercely. He  held out his hand with the thing that  had  cut  metal
glittering in it.

Soames faced the fourteen-year-old grimly. The boy's face was contorted. There was more than anger in
it. The boy in the green tunic clenched and unclenched his hands. His expression was purest horror. One
of the girls sobbed. The other spoke in a tone of despair so great and  grief so  acute  that  Soames  was
almost ashamed.
Then the boy in the brown tunic spoke very, very bitterly to  the girl who'd  evidently said  something to
restrain him. He turned his eyes from Soames. He went into the ship, stumbling a little.
The whole air of the three remaining children changed utterly. They had  been  composed  and  confident
and  even  zestful.  They'd  acted  as  if  the  wrecking  of  their  ship  were  an  adventure  rather  than  a
catastrophe. But now they were dazed by disaster. First one of the girls, and then the second boy, and
then the other girl went despairingly into the ship.
Soames looked at Gail. The boy  in the brown  tunic had  pointed  at  him with the object  that  cut metal
plates in half. He'd been stopped, most likely, by the girl's grief-stricken words. Soames had a profound
conviction that the boy could easily have killed him. He had an equally strong conviction that it could have
been a low price to pay for preventing the rest of these children's race from finding Earth.
"I suppose," said Gail, "that you feel pretty badly."
"I'm a  savage.  I've  destroyed  their signalling device.  I may have kept  their civilization from destroying
ours. I feel like a murderer," he told her grimly. "And of children, at that. With luck, I may have kept them
from ever seeing their families again."
After a long time Gail said with a curiously mirthless attempt at humor:
"Do you know,  this is the biggest news  story  that's  ever  happened?  And  do  you  know  that  nobody
would believe it?"
"But this," said Captain Moggs firmly, "is a matter of such military importance that nothing must be  said
about it at all! Nothing!"
Soames made no comment, but he didn't think the matter could be kept secret.
They waited. The children stayed in the ship.
After a very long time the children appeared  again. The girls' faces  were  tear-streaked.  They brought
small possessions and placed them neatly in the snow. They went back for more.
"At a guess," said Soames, "that super-radar of theirs has shown them a 'copter on the way. They know
they can't stay here. I've made it impossible for them to hope to be found. They've got to let themselves
be taken away and they want to keep these things."
The bringing-out of small objects ended. The boy in the brown tunic went back in the ship.

When he re-emerged, he said something in the bitterest of bitter voices. The girls turned  their backs  to
the ship. The girl with brown eyes began to weep. The boy in the green tunic shifted the small tripod to a
new position. As he carried it, the calmness and the warmth of the air changed remarkably. There was a
monstrous gust of icy wind, and warm calm, and another gust. But when he put the tripod  down  again
there was only calm once more.
Soames heard the droning of another 'copter, far away.
The boy  in the green  tunic held out his  hand.  It  had  the  glittering  tiny  object  in  it.  From  a  fifty-foot
distance,  he swept  his hand from one  end  to  the  other  of  the  wrecked  ship.  Flame  leaped  up.  The
magnesium-alloy vessel burned with a brightness that stung and dazzled the eyes. A monstrous, a colossal
flaming flare leaped and soared ... and died.  Too  late,  Soames  fumbled for his camera.  There  was  no
longer a wrecked ship on the ice. There were only a few, smoking, steaming fragments.
When the second 'copter landed beside the first, the four children were waiting composedly to be taken
away.
CHAPTER 3
THE world's  affairs went on as  usual. There  were  the  customary  number  of  international  crises.  The
current diplomacy preferred blackmail by threat of atomic war.
Naturally, even Antarctica could be used to create turmoil. The population of the continent was confined
to the staffs of research-bases established during the International Geophysical Year. In theory the bases
were an object-lesson in co-operation for a  constructive  purpose,  which splendid  spirit of mutual trust
and confidence must spread through the world and some day lead to an era of blissful and unsuspicious
peacefulness.
But that time was not yet.
There'd been an outburst of static of an unprecedented kind.
It had  covered  the globe  on all wave-lengths,  everywhere  of absolute  maximum  volume.  It  had  used
millions of times as much power as any signal ever  heard  before.  No  atom  bomb  could  have made  it.
Science and governments, together, raised three very urgent questions. Who did it? How did they do it?
And, why did they do it?
Each major nation suspected the others. Scientific progress had become the most urgent need  of every
nation, and was expected to be the end of all of them.
At Gissell Bay, however, the two 'copters came droning in, and settled down, and Gail and Soames and
Captain Moggs got out, and instantly picked up a boy or a girl and hurried to get them out of the bitter
cold.

The staff reacted immediately to the children. They tried to be reassuring. They tried to  find a  language
the children could  understand.  They  failed.  Then  when  the  children  spoke  slowly  and  carefully,  they
searched at least for familiar root-sounds. They found nothing. But certainly the children felt themselves
surrounded by people who wished them well.
The base photographer developed and printed Soames' pictures. The design of the ship was  clear  and
the children before it gave it scale. The interior pictures were not so good, wrongly focused. Still, there
was plenty to substantiate Soames' report.
Aside from the pictures  there  were  the things  the  children  had  selected  to  be  brought.  There  was  a
cooking-pot. Its substance conducted heat in one direction only. Heat could enter its outside surface, but
not leave it. Heat could leave its inside surface, but not enter it. Consequently, when the lid was on, the
outer surface absorbed heat from the air around it and the inner surface released it, and the contents of
the pot boiled merrily without fuel, while the outside became coated with frost.
Some of the physicists went about  in a  state  of shock,  trying to  figure out how  it  happened.  Others,
starry-eyed, pointed out that if the cooking-pot had been a pipe, it could be submerged under a running
river, yield live steam by cooling off the water  that  flowed past  it, and  that  water  would regain normal
river  temperature  in  the  course  of  a  few  miles  of  sunlit  flow.  In  such  a  case,  what  price  coal  and
petroleum? In fact, what price atomic power?
The small tripod went up outside the base's main building. Instantly the spinner began  to  turn, the wind
ceased. In minutes the air ceased to be biting. In tens of minutes it was warm. Meteorologists, refusing to
believe their senses, explored the boundaries of the calm area.  They came  back,  frost-bitten,  swearing
that there was a drop of eighty degrees beyond the calm area, and a rise of temperature beyond the cold
belt. The tripod-spinner  was  a  different application  of the principle of the cooking-pot.  Somehow  the
spinning thing made an area that heat could enter but not leave, and wind could not blow through. If the
device could be reversed, deserts would become temperate zones. As it was, the Arctic  and  Antarctic
could be made to bloom. The gadget was an out-of-doors heat-pump.
There was the box with the plastic sheet in it. One of the boys, very composed, operated it. On request,
he opened it up. There was nothing in the case but a few curiously shaped bits of metal. The thing was
too simple to be comprehensible when one did not know the principle by which it worked.
The same trouble showed up with every device examined.
These were important matters. Captain Moggs visibly grew in her own estimation. She commandeered a
supply plane and took off immediately for Washington with the news of the event she'd witnessed, prints
of  Soames'  photographs,  and  samples  of  the  children's  possessions  which  could  be  carried  on  her
person.
Back at the base the most urgent problem was communication with the children. So Gail began gently to
teach the taller girl some few English words. Very shortly she greeted Soames anxiously when he came to

see how the process went.
"Her name," said Gail, "is Zani. The other girl—the one with blue eyes—is Mal, and the boy in the brown
tunic is Fran and the one in the green is Hod. She understands that there's a language to be learned. She's
writing down  words  in some  sort  of  writing  of  her  own.  She  was  bewildered  when  I  handed  her  a
ball-point pen, but she understood as soon as I demonstrated. They must write with something else.
"But—what  happens  next?  What's  going  to  happen  to  the  children?  They've  no  friends,  no  family,
nobody to care what happens to them! They're in a terrible fix, Brad!"
"For which I'm responsible," said Soames grimly, "and about which I'm already jittering."
"I'm responsible too!" said Gail quickly. "I helped! What are you worrying about?"
"They burned up their ship," said Soames more grimly still. "Why?"
She shook her head, watching his expression.
"They treated us like harmless savages in the beginning," he said.  "Then I destroyed  their only hope  of
getting in touch with their families and friends. So  one  of the boys  destroyed  their ship. But the others
knew, and got ready for it by bringing some possessions out of it. Why?"
"I'm not sure ..." said Gail.
"If we'd captured their ship intact," Soames  told  her,  "we'd  have studied  it. Either we'd  have come  to
understand it, so we could build one too, or if we couldn't—being savages—we'd have given up entirely.
In either case the children wouldn't matter to us. They'd simply have been castaways. As it is, they've got
us where they want us. I suspect they've got some trinkets to trade with us, as we might offer beads to
bushmen. Let them or help them signal to their families, they'll say, and their parents will make us all rich."
Gail considered. Then she shook her head.
"It won't work. We've got newspapers and news broadcasts. People will be too scared to allow it."
"Scared of four children?" demanded Soames.
"You don't realize what newspapers are," Gail said with a trace of wryness. "They don't live by printing
news.  They  print  'true'  stories,  serials.  'True'  crime  stories,  to  be  continued  tomorrow.  'True'
international-crisis suspense stories, for the next thrilling chapter read tomorrow's paper or tune in to this
station! That's what's printed and broadcast, Brad. It's what people want and insist on. Don't you realize
how the children will be served up in the news? 'Creatures From Space in Antarctica! Earth Helpless!'"
She grimaced. "There won't be any demand for human-interest stories by Gail Haynes, telling about four
nicely-raised children who need to be helped to get back to their parents. The public wouldn't like that so
much.
"You'll see," Gail continued, "I'm very much afraid, Brad, that presently you and I will be the only people

in the world who don't think the children had better be killed, for safety. You did the right thing for us, in
not letting them signal to their families. But you don't  need  to  worry  about  too  much sympathy for the
children!"
"And I got them into it," said Soames, morosely.
"We did," insisted Gail. "And we did right. But I'm going to do what I can to keep it from being worse for
them than I can help. If you'll join me—"
"Naturally!" said Soames.
He went moodily away. He was unaware of Gail's expression as she looked after him. She turned slowly
to the girl with her.
He found the other three children. They were the center of an agitated group of staff-members, trying to
communicate by words and gestures, while the children tried not to show disturbance at their vehemence.
A cosmic-particle specialist told Soames the trouble. Among the children's possessions there was a coil
of thread-fine copper wire. Somebody had snipped off a bit of it for test, and discovered  that  the wire
was superconductive.  A superconductor  is a  material which  has  no  electrical  resistance  whatever.  In
current Earth science tin and  mercury and  a  few alloys could  be  made  into superconductors  by being
cooled below 18° Kelvin, or four hundred odd degrees Fahrenheit below zero. Above that temperature,
superconductivity did not exist. But the children's  wire was  a  superconductor  at  room  temperature.  A
thread  the size of a  cobweb  could  carry  all the current  turned  out by Niagara  without  heating  up.  A
heavy-duty  dynamo  could  be  replaced  by  a  superconductive  dynamo  that  would  almost  fit  in  one's
pocket. A thousand-horse-power motor would need to be hardly larger than the shaft it would turn. It
would mean ...
"Let 'em alone!" snapped  Soames.  "They couldn't  tell you how  it  was  made,  even  if  they  could  talk
English! Give them a chance to learn how to talk! They've had a bad time anyhow."
He took the boys and the other girl away. He led them to his own quarters. He whistled for his dog, Rex,
and  showed  the  children  how  to  play  with  him.  They  began  to  relax  and  enjoy  the  fun  heretofore
unknown to them.
Soames  left his quarters  and  held his head.  There  was  much  to  worry  about.  For  example,  Captain
Moggs in Washington, there to pass on information perfectly calculated to bring about confusion. And at
the base itself a completely natural routine event took place to make the confusion twice confounded.
The  director  of  the  Gissell  Bay  base  made  his  normal,  regular,  short-wave  report  to  the  scientific
organization which controlled and co-ordinated the base's activities and  kept  it supplied  and  equipped.
The  Gissell  Bay  director  was  an  eminent  scientist.  He  talked  comfortably  to  an  even  more  eminent
scientist in the capital of the United States. Naturally, the static scream was mentioned in Washington. As
naturally, the discovery of a crashed spaceship came up. It was important. It should be reported. It was.

The Gissell Bay director went into details about the children and about the gadgets they'd selected to be
salvaged when they destroyed their ship. A complete account preceded Captain Moggs to Washington,
but not to the military. She was in charge of that angle.
The  eminent  scientist  in  Washington  naturally  discussed  the  report  with  other  scientists  who  would
naturally be  as  much  concerned  as  himself.  Later  in  the  morning,  one  of  those  scientists  received  a
reporter. The reporter asked various routine questions. In all innocence, the scientist who had been told
by the scientist who had been told by the director at Gissell Bay, told the reporter.
And therefore, as Captain Moggs rode toward the Pentagon she did not notice  the headlines,  but they
had already been seen in the Pentagon.
"Spaceship Lands in Antarctica!
Alien Life Forms Aboard
Scientists Alarmed."
No newspaper would spoil a good story by underplaying it. Wire services wasted no time. There were
other similar headlines all over the United States.
It should be added that the first editions of the first newspapers  to  print the story  did mention that  the
invaders were in appearance like human children, but somehow  it did not sound  plausible. Also,  other
sorts of descriptions were more exciting. The description of children as invaders was classed as a guess.
Then as a bad guess. Then as something so preposterous that it wasn't worth relating. Anyhow the point
of the story  was  that a  ship from off the Earth had  landed,  with intelligent beings in it, equipped  with
marvellous devices. And marvellous devices would naturally—in the state of the world at that time—be
weapons. So rewrite men expanded the news service dispatches by the sound business-like rule that the
public is entitled to get what it wants. The public likes to be scared.
A lieutenant-general greeted Captain Moggs at the Pentagon.
"This business  is true?" he demanded.  "A spaceship  from off  Earth  has  landed?  It  had  a  crew?  The
crew's still alive? Hell and damnation! What weapons have they got?"
Captain Moggs stammered but managed to give answers. They did not give an impression of a properly
complete investigation of the landing of an alien spaceship. In particular, her statement  that  the crew  of
the ship was human children simply did not register.
"Hah!" said the lieutenant-general, bitterly. "Nothing to go on! You, Captain whatever-your-name-is, you
were there when the ship was found, you say.  Very  well. Keep  your mouth shut. Get  a  plane and  go
back."
He addressed  his men, "Bring up  all  their  stuff,  the  stuff  they  brought  from  their  ship.  Get  the  stray
unburned parts of their ship. Get our guided missile men set to work on them and find out how the drive
worked. They ought to come  up with something! Round up some  special-weapons  men to  investigate
those fragments too. See what they've got! Work from these pictures  until we've  got the samples." He

swung back to Captain Moggs. "You go back and bring those aliens and everything that can be brought!
Bring  everything!  And  in  the  meantime,"  he  looked  around  his  office,  "a  lid  goes  on  this!  Top
secret—top-top secret! The newspapers have to be choked off. Deny everything!"
He waved his hand. She left the office.
Her plane was barely south of Virginia when a spokesman for the Pentagon assured a news conference
that the Defense  Department  had  no information about  an alleged  non-terrestrial  spaceship  landing  in
Antarctica.  The newspaper  reporters  pulled newspapers  from their  pockets.  The  Pentagon  had  been
denying things right  and  left,  in  obedience  to  orders.  Now  the  newspapers  printed  reproductions  of
United Nations  records,  showing that at  the request  of the  Defense  Department  four  United  Nations
passports had been issued. The records said that the passports were for Jane and John Doe, and  Ruth
and Richard Roe, who obviously could not enter the United States without proper documents. The UN
information on those persons was: birthplace, unknown; nationality, unknown; age, unknown; description,
not  given;  race,  unknown;  occupation,  unknown.  And  all  the  newspapers  carried  headlines  about
"SPACESHIP CREW US-BOUND." Or:
"Take Us To Your President"—Aliens
Spaceship Crew Demands Top-Level Conference.
Ultimatum Hinted At
It was  not,  of course,  exclusively an American affair. The London  Times  pointed  out the  remarkable
amount of detailed  speculation  in the air,  as  compared  with the minute amount of admitted  facts.  But
elsewhere:  Pravda  insisted  that  the  aliens  had  refused  to  enter  into  discussions  with  America  after
learning of its capitalistic social system and  tyrannical  government.  Ce  Soir  claimed  exclusive  private
information  that  the  crew  of  the  spaceship—which  was  twelve  hundred  metres  long—were  winged
monsters of repellant aspect. The official newspaper  in Bucharest,  to  the contrary,  said  that  they were
intelligent reptiles. In Cairo it was believed and printed that the spacecraft was manned by creatures  of
protean structure, remarkably resembling legendary djinns.
There were  other  descriptions,  all attributing monstrous  qualities and  brutally aggressive  actions  to  the
aliens.
And at Gissell Bay the staff became  rather  fond of four young people  whose  names were  Zani, Fran,
Hod and Mal, because they had been very well brought  up by their parents  and  were  thoroughly nice
children.
They were tense, and they were desperately anxious and uneasy. But they displayed a resolute courage
that made moderately decent people like them very much. Most of the research-staff wanted very badly
to ask them questions, but that was impossible, so they studied the rather fuzzy photographs of the inside
of the ship—the base photographer had run off several sets of extra prints—and poked helplessly at the
things the children had brought with them, and racked their brains to imagine how such things work. The
spinning thing atop  the tripod  made  it quite pleasant  to  be  out-of-doors  around  the Gissell Bay base,
though there were forty-mile winds and thermometers read ten below zero two hundred yards from the

thing Hod had set up. The cooking-pot boiled merrily without fuel, with an increasingly thick layer of frost
on its outside. The thing Soames had called a super-radar allowed a penguin rookery to be watched  in
detail without disturbing the penguins, and Fran obligingly loaned his pocket instrument—the one that cut
metal like butter—to the physicists of the staff.
He had to show them how to use it, though. It was a flat metal case about the size of a pocket cigarette
lighter. It had two very simple controls, and a highly ingenious gimmick which kept it from turning itself on
by accident.
In an oblique fashion, it was a heat-pump. One control turned it on and intensified or diminished its effect.
The other controlled the area it worked on. In any material but iron, it made heat flow together  toward
the center of its projected field. Pointed at a  metal bar,  the heat  from both  ends  flowed to  the center,
where the pocket device was aimed. The center became intensely hot. The rest went intensely cold.  In
seconds a bronze bar turned red-hot along a line a hundredth of an inch thick. Then it melted, a layer the
thickness of tissue-paper turned liquid and one could pull the bar apart or slide it sidewise to separate it.
But one needed to hold the bar in thick gloves, because liquid air could drip off if one were not careful.
And it did not work on iron or steel.
Soames took Fran with Mal and Hod, to the improvised schoolroom where Gail labored to give Zani a
minimum vocabulary of English words. Rex went happily along with the others.
Zani greeted  the dog  rapturously.  She  got down  on the floor with him and  tussled  with him, her face
beaming.
Soames' mouth dropped open. The other children hadn't known there was such a thing as a dog. They'd
had to learn to play with Rex. But Zani knew about dogs and how to play with them on sight.
"I suppose," said Gail, not knowing of Soames' astonishment, "Zani will help me teach the other children
some words."
But the boy Hod had picked up the ball-point pen Gail had needed to show Zani the use of.  He  didn't
need to be shown. Without a  glance at  it, he began  to  write.  A moment later  he read  off, slowly and
clumsily and from the completely cryptic marks he'd made, the English words that Gail had taught Zani.
Fran and Mal joined him. They painstakingly practiced the pronunciation of words Gail had taught Zani
but not them.
It was another development that did not make sense.
CHAPTER 4
CAPTAIN  MOGGS  landed  and  went  directly  to  the  main  building  of  the  base.  The  children  were
playing with Rex.

"Children," she said with authority, "go inside and pack up. We are going back to the United States."
The girl Mal seemed to understand and went to tell the others.
Captain Moggs came upon Soames, feverishly making up bundles of objects the children had brought out
of their ship before Fran—in the brown tunic—had burned it. Captain Moggs said approvingly:
"You must have anticipated  my orders!  But I thought it unwise to  tell you by radio  on the  inter-base
wave-length."
Soames said curtly:
"I don't know anything about your orders. They're refuelling your ship now. We need to get it aloft with
Gail and the kids inside of fifteen minutes.
"We were clearing away a snow-weasel to  take  to  the woods,"  he growled.  "Not  the woods,  but the
wilds. We've got company coming."
"Impossible!" said Captain Moggs. "I have top-level  orders  for this whole affair to  be  hushed up.  The
existence of the children is to be denied. Everybody is to deny everything. Visitors cannot be permitted!
It's absolutely unthinkable!"
Soames grinned mirthlessly.
"It's six hours since the French  asked  if they might come  over  for a  social call. We  stalled  them. The
English suggested a conference about the extrawd'n'ry burst of static the other  night. They were  stalled
off too. But just about an hour ago the Russians pulled their stunt. Emergency S.O.S. One of their planes
with engine trouble. Can't get home. It's heading this way for an emergency landing, convoyed by another
plane. Can you imagine us refusing permission for a ship in trouble to land?"
"I don't believe it's in trouble!" said Captain Moggs angrily.
"Neither do I," said Soames.
He passed a wrapped parcel to one side.
"They must be acting on orders," he said  coldly. "And we  don't  know  what their orders  are.  Until we
realized you'd get here first, we were making ready to take the kids off in a snow-weasel. If we kept to
soft  snow,  no  plane  could  land  near  them.  It's  just  possible  somebody  could  claim  the  kids  asked
protection from us decadent, warmongering Americans, and they might be equipped to shoot it out. We
aren't."
Some of the base specialists appeared to help Soames carry the parcels to the transport.
Gail  appeared,  muffled  up  for  travel.  Fran  and  Zani  were  with  her,  similarly  clothed.  They  carried

garments for the others.
Captain Moggs fled to the communications room to demand radio contact to Washington. But the radio
was busy.  The French,  having been  stalled  off  when  they  suggested  a  visit,  were  now  urged  to  call
immediately. The English, similarly  put  off,  were  now  invited  to  drop  in  for  tea.  As  Captain  Moggs
sputtered, the radio went on to organize a full-scale conference on common observational problems, plus
a seminar on Antarctic scientific research in general. It  would be  a  beautiful example of whole-hearted
co-operation among scientific groups of different nationalities. It should set  a  charming example for the
rest  of the world.  But members  of the staff, arranging this swift  block  of  possible  trouble-making  by
unwelcome visitors, wore  the unpleasant  expression  of people  who are  preparing  to  be  very polite to
people attempting to put something over on them. It was notable  that  the few sporting weapons  at  the
base were passed out to those who could use them most effectively if the need arose.
The transport's fuel-tanks were topped. The remaining two  children struggled into flying garments.  The
boy Hod took down the small tripod with its spinning thing on top. Instantly the area about the base main
building became bitter cold. The children climbed into the transport after Gail.
Soames, swearing, climbed in after a still expostulating Captain Moggs. He did not like the idea of leaving
while any chance of trouble stayed behind. But as a matter of fact, his leaving with the others  removed
nearly the last chance of it.
It was, though, the rational thing to do.
Representatives of the other nations would land at the American base, and assure themselves that there
were no extraterrestrials in hiding nor any signs of a spaceship anywhere about. And there would result a
scientific conference that would do  some  good.  The extraordinary  burst  of static  would be  discussed,
with no conclusion whatever. But the Americans would be  able  to  make  an agreement  on methods  of
observation with the other bases so that observations in the future would yield a  little more  information
than had been secured before.
Gail kept a quasi-maternal eye on the children until they dozed off. But she watched Soames' expression,
too.  She  and  Soames  and  Captain  Moggs  rode  in the passenger  section  of the transport  a  few seats
behind the children.
"I wish I could understand," said Gail, in a low tone to Soames. "The other children know everything I've
taught Zani, and there's been no way for them to know! They know things they weren't  in the room  to
learn, and Zani didn't have time to tell them! Yet it doesn't seem like telepathy. If they were telepaths they
could exchange thoughts without speaking. But they chatter all the time!"
"If  they'd  been  telepaths,"  said  Soames,  "they'd  have  known  I  was  going  to  burn  their  signalling
apparatus. They could have stopped me, or tried to, anyhow."
Captain Moggs had paid no attention. Now she asked, "Why does the public insist on details of matters

the military think should be kept secret?"
"Because," said Gail briefly, "it's the public that gets drowned by a tidal wave or killed by a  cyclone.  If
strangers from space discover Earth, it's the public that will suffer."
"But," said Captain Moggs querulously, "it is necessary for this to be kept secret!"
"Unfortunately," said Soames. "The story broke before that decision was made."
He thought how inevitable it was that everybody should see the situation from their own viewpoint only.
Captain  Moggs  from  the  military;  Gail  had  a  newspaper-woman's  angle  tempered  with  feminine
compassion. And he was fascinated by the innumerable possibilities the technology of the children's race
suggested. He  yearned  for a  few days  alone with some  low-temperature  apparatus.  The hand-tool  of
Fran's bothered him.
He told Gail.
"What has low temperature to do?" she asked.
"They've got some wire that's a  superconductor  at  room  temperature.  We  can't  have superconductors
above 18° Kelvin, which is colder than liquid hydrogen. But a superconductor acts like a magnetic shield,
no, not exactly. But you can't  touch  a  magnet to  one.  Induced  currents  in the superconductor  fight its
approach.  I'd  like to  know  what happens  to  the magnetic field. Does  it cancel,  or  bounce,  or  what?
Could it, for instance, be focussed?"
"I don't see ..."
"Neither do I," said Soames. "But I've got a  hunch that  the little pocket  gadget  Fran  carries  has  some
superconductor in it. I think I could make something that wouldn't be his instrument, at all—it would do
different things—but that gadget does suggest some possibilities I fairly ache to try out."
"And I," said Gail, with a faint smile, "I want to try to write something that nobody would print. I'd like to
write the real story as I see it, the children from a viewpoint nobody will want to see."
He looked at her, puzzled.
"My syndicate wants a story about the children that nobody will have to think about. No recognition of a
problem  in  plain  decency  with  the  children  considered  as  human  as  they  are,  but  just  a  story  that
everybody  could  read  without  thinking  anything  but  what  they  wanted  to.  They're  nice  children.
Somebody raised them very well. But with most people nowadays thinking that if children aren't ill-bred
they're frustrated...."
She made a helpless gesture as the plane bellowed onward.

Presently the moon shone on Fran's face. He moved in his sleep. After a  little he opened  his eyes  and
gasped a little. He  looked  startledly  around,  an instinct of anyone waking in a  strange  place.  Then he
turned back. He saw the moon.
He uttered a little cry. His face worked. He stared at the misshapen, incompletely round  companion of
Earth as if its appearance had some extraordinary, horrifying meaning for him. His hands clenched.
Behind him, Gail whispered:
"Brad! He's—horrified! Does that mean that he and the other children need to signal to someone ..."
"I doubt  it very much," said  Soames.  "If his parents  and  companions  had  landed  on the moon,  and  I
stopped him from signalling to them, he might look hopefully at it, or longingly, but not the way he does."
Fran touched the other boy, Hod. Hod waked, and Fran spoke to him in an urgent whisper. Hod jerked
his head about and stared at the moon as Fran had done. He made a little whimpering noise. Then Mal
made a bubbling sound, as from a bad dream. She waked. Then Zani roused and began to ask what was
obviously a question, and stopped short. They spoke to each other in hushed voices in that unintelligible
language of theirs.
"I've got an idea," said Soames in a flat, unbelieving tone. "Let's see."
Soames went forward and into the pilot's compartment. He came back with binoculars. He touched Fran
on the shoulder and offered them. Fran stared up at him with dazed eyes, not really attending to Soames
at all. He looked back at the moon.
He focussed the binoculars. They were excellent glasses. The ring-mountains at the edge of sunshine on
the moon were  very,  very distinct. He  could  see  those  tiny speckles  of light  on  the  dark  side  of  the
terminator which were mountain-tops rising out of darkness into the sunshine. There was Aristarchus and
Copernicus and Tycho. There were the vast, featureless "mares,"—those plains of once-liquid lava which
had  welled  out  when  monstrous  missiles  the  size  of  counties  buried  themselves  deep  in  the  moon's
substance. The moon could be seen as battered; shattered, devastated; destroyed.
Soames touched Fran's shoulder again and showed him how one looked through the binoculars.  Fran's
hand shook as he took them. He put them to his eyes.
Zani put her hands over her eyes with a little cry. It was as if she tried to shut out the sight that Fran saw.
Mal began to cry quietly. Hod made little gasping noises.
Fran lowered the binoculars. He looked at Soames with a terrible hatred in his eyes.
Soames went back to Gail, leaving the binoculars with the children. He found himself sweating.
"When," asked Soames harshly, "were the mountains on the moon made?  It's  an interesting question.  I
just got an answer. They were made when there were three-toed horses and many ganoid fishes on the
earth."

"The children knew  the moon when it—wasn't  the way it is now," he said  with some  difficulty.  "You
know what that is! Ring-mountains sometimes hundreds  of miles across,  splashings of stone  from  the
impact of asteroids and moonlets and islands of rock and metal falling from the sky. The mares are where
the moon's crust was punctured and lava poured out. The streaks are where up-flung stuff was  thrown
hundreds of miles!
"It was a guess," said Soames. "But it's not a guess any longer. There  was  a  Fifth Planet,  and  it either
exploded or was blown to bits, heaven knows how!  But the moon was  bombarded  by the wreckage,
and so was Earth! Mountain-ranges fell from the sky right here on this world, too. There was destruction
on Earth to match that on the moon. Perhaps here and there some place remained undestroyed, an acre
here, perhaps a square mile a thousand miles away. Some life survived, and now it's all forgotten. There
are rains and winds and frost. Earth's scars wore away through millions of years. We  don't  even know
where the wounds were! But there were people in those days!
"And they were civilized," continued Soames.  "They had  superconductors  and  one-way  conductors  of
heat. They had reached the point where they didn't need fire any more, and they built ships of magnesium
alloy. They saw the Fifth Planet when it flew apart. They knew what must happen to Earth with the whole
solar system filled with a planet's debris. Earth would be smashed; wrecked; depopulated, made like the
moon is now! Maybe they had ships that went to other planets, but not enough to carry all the race. And
the only other  planets  they could  use  were  the inner ones,  and  they'd  be  smashed  like the  Earth  and
moon? What could they do? There might be one or two survivors here  and  there,  bound  to  lapse  into
savagery because they were so few. But where could the civilized race go?"
Gail made an inarticulate sound.
"They might," said Soames in a flat voice, "they might try to go into the future; into the time beyond  the
catastrophe, when Earth would have healed its wounds. They might send someone ahead to see if it were
possible. Yet if they sent one ship first—with everyone left behind doomed to die—if they sent one ship
first, it's reasonable that they'd give children the chance of survival. It's even reasonable that they'd send
two boys and two girls...."
"They—had a transmitter," Gail said, as if breathing hurt her. "You destroyed it. They meant to signal, not
for help as we thought, but for their people to join them. M-maybe now they're hoping to get the material
and the power to build another transmitter. Since everything they use is so simple, the boys  might have
been taught how. They were taught to repair the one they had! They did repair it! Maybe they can make
one, and hope we'll help them! They'd have been especially trained...."
"Nice, isn't it?" asked  Soames.  "They were  sent  here  in  some  fashion  to  make  a  beachhead  for  the
landing  of  their  people.  A  civilization  that's  starkly,  simply  doomed  unless  it  can  migrate.  No  mere
conquest, with tribute to be paid to it. It has to take over a whole planet! It has to take  over  Earth,  or
die!" He winced. "And the kids, now, think of their parents  as  waiting for mountains to  fall upon  them
from the sky, and I've doomed them to keep on waiting. Now the kids must be hoping desperately that
they can get us to give them the means to save everything and everybody they care about, even though
we're destroyed in the process! Isn't it pretty?
"If anybody else finds out what we know, the children will be hated as nobody was ever  hated  before.

They'll be known for the deadly danger they are. We're primitives, beside their civilization! We'll have to
fight, because there's no room for the population of another whole world, here! There's no food for more
people! We can't let them come, and they must die if they don't come, and the children must be here to
open the way for them to come in hordes.
"The children mustn't be  allowed  to  build  anything  we  don't  understand  or  that  might  let  them  open
communication with their people. If they try, they'll be trying to serve their own race by destroying  this.
And they'd  have to  destroy  us and—" his voice was  fierce—"I'm not going to  let anything happen  to
you!"
Gail's cheeks were white, but a trace of color came  into them then.  Yet  she  looked  remorseful as  she
glanced forward to where the children murmured hopelessly together.
CHAPTER 5
THE jet transport got new flight orders  while it was  in the air over  South  Carolina.  There  was  a  new
attitude  toward  their  ship  and  its  occupants  among  the  military  men  and  the  political  heads  of
governments. The new attitude was the result of mathematics.
It was the burst of static screaming, three whole seconds long, which made the matter  something much
more than a thing to maneuver with and make public pronouncements about. In every nation it eventually
occurred  to  somebody  to  compute  the  power  in  that  meaningless  signal.  It  was  linked  with  the
appearance of the children's ship—which nobody really believed had contained children—and therefore
it was artificial. But the power, the energy involved was  incredible.  The computations  went to  defense
departments and heads of state. They reacted. And in consequence the jet-plane was ordered to change
course and head west.
After many hours the transport landed. A hillside rose before it. A vast, grass-covered area lifted up. It
was a great door. The transport rolled deliberately into a  monstrous,  windowless,  artificial cavern,  and
the hillside closed behind it.
This was a base, too, but not like the one at Gissell Bay. The existence of this one would be denied. It
was hoped that it would be forever unused for its designed purpose. Soames never saw any part of it that
he was not supposed to see. Nobody ever mentioned to  him any function it could  perform  except  the
hiding of children from a spaceship that happened to have crashed on Antarctica. But he guessed that if
atomic war should ever burst on Earth, that rockets rising from this place and others like it would avenge
the destruction done to America.
Presently  Gail  and  the  children  were  installed  in  a  remarkably  ordinary  small  cottage,  and  Soames
frowned. They'd arrived at the village by elevator  from a  tunnel hundreds  of feet  underground,  but the
village in which the cottage stood looked exactly like any other  remote  and  sleepy  settlement.  Soames
began a protest against Gail being so isolated and so  much alone.  But, unsmilingly, he was  shown that

there  was  an electrified fence,  with guards,  and  another  a  mile  beyond,  and  a  third  still  farther,  with
watch-posts  beyond  that.  Nobody  would  intrude  upon  the  village.  But  from  the  air  it  would  look
perfectly  commonplace.  There  was  no  indication  at  all  of  shafts  from  deep  underground  to  what
appeared an ordinary country general store. There was no sign of tunnels from the different houses to that
merchandising mart.
Soames went off to be assigned other quarters. He wanted to work on some items that had come into his
mind during the last hours of the flight. He'd guessed, to Gail, that the children came out of remotest time.
There was evidence for it, but it need not be true. So he'd made a test.
When the children had breakfasted he drew on a sketch-pad a diagram of part of the solar system. A dot
for the sun, and a circle with a dot on it for Mercury, the innermost planet. Another dot on a  circle for
Venus, the second world out. A third circle and a dot for Earth and its orbit, and beside the dot indicating
Earth he drew a crescent, for the moon.  Alongside the dot  standing for Mars  he drew  two  crescents,
because Mars has two tiny moons.
The children discussed the diagram. Zani ended it with a decisive remark in the language they used. Fran
drew a fifth circle, placed a dot to indicate a fifth planet, and put four crescents  beside  it, then drew  a
sixth circle with a large dot and drew twelve crescents beside that.
Soames drew a deep breath. The twelve-moon planet was certainly Jupiter, which is now next out from
the sun after Mars. The number of moons made it unmistakable. But Fran  put a  Fifth Planet,  with four
moons, where now there is only planetary debris, the asteroids.
The  diagram  quite  distinctly  proved,  to  Soames'  satisfaction,  that  the  hypothetical  Fifth  Planet  had
existed, with four moons, and that the children had come out of time rather than across  space.  And he
was now grimly sure about the reason for the children's coming to Earth of here and now.
Bombardment from space is not unknown. In 1914 there was a meteoric fall in Siberia which knocked
down every tree for fifty miles around. A few thousand years earlier, eight or ten,  Canon  Diablo crater
was formed in Colorado by a missile from the heavens  which wiped  out all life within a  thousand-mile
radius. Earlier still a much larger crater was formed in Canada, and there are yet traces of an even more
remote monster-missile landing in South Africa. The ring-mountain there is largely worn away, but it was
many miles across.
The situation  of  the  children's  race  amounted  to  an  infinitely  speeded-up  bombardment  instead  of  a
millennial sniping from the sky. The Fifth Planet was newly shattered into bits. Its fragments plunged upon
Earth and moon as they had weeks earlier battered Mars, and  as  fortnights later  they would devastate
Venus and plunge upon Mercury.  Jagged  portions  of the detonated  planet  filled the sky  of Earth with
flames.
The ground shook continuously. With a mad imprecision of timing, mountain-ranges plummeted out of the
sky at utterly unpredictable  times and  places.  Anywhere on Earth,  at  night-time, living creatures  might
look upward and see the stars blotted out in irregularly-shaped, swiftly enlarging areas which would grow
until  there  was  only  blackness  overhead.  But  that  could  not  last.  It  turned  abruptly  to  white-hot

incandescence as the falling enormity touched atmosphere, and crashed down upon them.
No living thing which saw the sky all turned to flame lived to remember it. Not one survived. Obviously!
They were turned to wisps of incandescent gas, exploding past the normal limits of Earth's air. Some may
have seen such plungings from many miles away and died of the concussion. The ground heaved in great
waves which ran terribly in all directions. Vast chasms opened in the soil, and flames as of hell flowed out
of them. Seashores were overwhelmed by mountainous tidal waves, caused by cubic miles of seawater
turned to steam when islands fell into the ocean at tens of miles per second.
This was what happened  to  Earth in the time from which the children came.  Perhaps  their elders  had
foreseen it in time to take some measures, which would be the children's ship. But that ship had been built
very hastily. It could have been begun before the bombardment started, or it could have been completed
only near the end, when asteroids already plunged into defenseless  Earth and  it heaved  and  writhed in
agony.
Humans caught in such a cosmic trap would be in no mood to negotiate or make promises, if any sort of
beachhead to the future could be set up.  They would pour  through and  the world  of the present  must
simply dissolve into incoherence. There could be no peace. It was unthinkable.
The investigation-team from the East arrived to learn from Soames all about the landing of the ship.
He told them, giving them the tape from the wave-guide radar and speaking with strict precision of every
event up to  the moment of his arrival at  Gissell Bay with  the  children  and  their  artifacts.  He  did  not
mention telepathy or time-travel because they seemed so impossible.
When the military men wanted information about instantly available super-weapons, he told them that he
knew nothing of weapons. They'd have to judge from the gadgets  the children had  brought.  When the
public-relations men asked briskly from what other planet or solar system the spaceship had come, and
when a  search-ship  might be  expected,  looking for the children, he was  ironic. He  suggested  that  the
children might give that information if asked  in  the  proper  language.  He  didn't  know  it.  But  the  two
physicists were men whose names he knew and respected. They listened to what he said. They'd look at
the devices from the ship and then come back and talk to him.
He went back to his brooding. The children had travelled through time. Everything pointed to it, from the
meteor-watch radar to the children's reaction at sight of the pock-marked moon and their knowledge that
there should have been a Fifth Planet, to which they assigned four moons.  It  had  happened.  Positively.
But there was one small difficulty. If time-travel were possible, a man travelling about in the past might by
some accident kill his grandfather, or his father, in which case he could not be born, and hence could not
possibly go  back  in  time.  But  if  he  did  not  go  back  in  time  he  would  be  born  and  could  face  the
possibility  of  preventing  his  own  existence—if  time-travel  was  possible.  But  this  was  impossible,  so
time-travel was impossible.
On a  higher technical level, there  is just one  law of nature  which seems  infallibly  true,  since  its  latest
modification to allow for nuclear energy. It is the law of the conservation of mass and energy. The total of
energy and matter taken together in the universe as a whole, cannot change. Matter can be converted to

energy and doubtless energy to matter, but the total is fixed for all time and for each instant of time. So, if
a ship could move from one time-period to another, it would lessen the total of matter and energy in the
time-period it left, and increase the total  when—where—where-when  it arrived.  And this would mean
that the law of the conservation of mass and energy was wrong. But it wasn't. It was right.
Soames  tried  to  reconcile  what  he  had  to  accept  with  what  he  knew.  He  failed.  He  provisionally
conceded that the children's  civilization did something which in his frame of reference  was  impossible.
They had other frames of reference than his. He tried to find their frame of reference in something simpler
than time-travel. He picked one impossible accomplishment and tried to duplicate it, then to approach it,
then to parallel it. He  scribbled  and  diagrammed and  scowled  and  sweated.  He  had  no real  hope,  of
course. But presently he swore abruptly and stared at what he had drawn.
He'd begun a second set of diagrams when the two physicists of the investigation-team came back. There
was a short man and a thin one. They looked dazed.
"They are children," said the thin man in a very thin voice, "and they are human children, and their science
makes us ridiculous. They are centuries ahead of us. I could not understand any device they had. I could
not imagine how any of them worked."
"It is impossible to talk at a distance," said Soames.
"What do you mean?" asked the thin man, still numb from what he'd seen.
"Sound diminishes as the square of the distance," Soames explained. "You can't make a  sound—unless
you use a cannon—that can be heard ten miles away. It's impossible to talk at a distance."
"I feel crazy too," said the short man, "but there are telephones."
"It's not talking at a distance. You talk to a microphone at a few inches. Someone  listens to  a  receiver
held against his ear.  You don't  talk to  the man, but the  microphone.  He  doesn't  listen  to  you,  but  a
receiver. The effect is the same as talking at a distance, so you ignore the fact that it isn't. I've played a
game with the things the children brought. I won it, one game."
Both men listened intently.
"I've been pretending," said Soames, "that I'm a  member of the kids'  race,  cast  away  like they are  on
Earth. As a castaway I know that things can be done that the local savages—us—consider  impossible.
But I need special materials to do them with. My civilization has provided  them. They don't  exist here.
But I refuse to sink to barbarism. Yet I can't reconstruct my civilization. What can I do?"
The thin physicist suddenly raised his head. The short man looked up.

"I'll take what materials the savages of Earth can supply," said Soames. "I'll settle for an approximation.
And in practice, as a castaway in a savage environment, I'll wind up with a civilization which isn't that of
the savages, and isn't of my own race, but in some ways is better than either because it's tailored to fit the
materials at hand and the environment I'm in."
The short physicist said slowly:
"I think I see what you're driving at. But it's just an idea...."
"I  tried  it  on  that  one-way  heat  conductor,"  said  Soames.  "I  can't  duplicate  it.  But  I've  designed
something that will mean nearly but not quite what their cooking-pot does. Take a look at this."
He spread out the completed diagram of the first thing he'd worked on. It was quite clear. He'd helped
design the meteor-watch radar at Gissell Bay, and his use of electronic symbols was normal. There was
only one  part  of the device  that  he'd  needed  to  sketch  in  some  detail.  The  thin  physicist  traced  the
diagram.
"You've designed a coil with extremely low self-induction—"
"Not low," corrected Soames. "Negative. This has less than no self-induction. It feeds back to instead of
fighting an applied  current.  Put  any current  in it, and  it  feeds  back  to  increase  the  magnetism  until  it
reaches saturation. Then it starts to lose its magnetism and that feeds back a counter-emf which increases
the demagnetizing current until it's saturated with opposite polarity. You get an alternating magnet, which
doesn't evolve heat because of its magnetic instability, but absorbs heat trying to maintain its stability. This
thing will absorb heat from anywhere—the air, water, sunlight or what have you—and  give out electric
current."
The two scientists stared, and traced the diagram again, and stared at each other.
"It—should!" said the thin man. "It—it has to! This is magnificent! It's more important than one-way heat
conduction! This is ..."
"This is not nearly as convenient as a pot that gets cold on the outside so  it can  get hot on the inside,"
observed  Soames.  "From a  castaway's  standpoint  it's  crude.  But  this  is  what  can  happen  from  two
civilizations affecting each other without immediately resorting to murder. You might try it."
The two physicists blinked. Then the short man said uneasily:
"Can we do it?"
The thin man said more feverishly than before:
"Of course!  Look  at  that weather-making  thing! We  can't  duplicate  it exactly,  but  when  you  think—
There's no Hall effect in liquids. Nobody ever tried to find one in ionized gases. But when you think—"
The short man gulped. Then he said:

"You won't change the temperature, and to make an equation—"
They talked to each other, feverishly. They scribbled. They almost babbled in their haste. When the other
members of the investigating-team arrived, they had the look of men who walk on clouds.
The  military  men  were  not  happy.  They  were  empty-handed.  They  could  not  even  get  statistical
information from the children.
They had no useful information. Fran's pocket instrument was cryptic, and held no promise as a weapon.
They could not hope to duplicate what Soames had called a super-radar. The cooking-pot, if duplicated,
might  by  modification  supply  power  for  ships  and  submarines,  or  even  planes.  But  there  were  no
weapons. None.
The public-relations men were frightened. The children's  coming must produce  a  financial panic.  All of
Earth's civilization was demonstrably out of date. Earth technology was so old-fashioned that instantly its
obsolescence was realized, our economic system must fall apart.
Only the two physicists beamed at each other. They'd learned no scientific facts from the children or their
equipment, but they'd picked up a trick of thinking from Soames.
By that time it was night. Soames went again to the surprisingly ordinary cottage that Gail occupied with
the four children.
"I've had quite a day," said Gail tiredly. "And I'm worried; for the children. For you. For myself. I'm—I'm
terrified, Brad!"
He put out his hands. He steadied her. Then, without intending it, he held her close. She  did not resist.
She cried heart-brokenly on his shoulder from pure nervous strain.
Suddenly Captain Moggs appeared. Gail was immediately composed and remote. But one hand, holding
Soames' sleeve, still quivered a little.
"It's dreadful!" said Captain Moggs. "You'll never be able to believe what's happened! The Russians have
pictures of the spaceship! The pictures Mr. Soames took! They know everything! They must have gotten
the pictures when their planes landed at Gissell Bay! But how?"
Soames could have answered, and quite accurately. Some enterprising member of the Russian scientific
team had been left alone in the developing-room at the base.
"They gave copies of the pictures to the UN assembly," wailed Captain Moggs. "All of them! They say
they are pictures of the alien ship which landed—and they are—and they say that we Americans took the
crew to the United States—which we did—but they say we're now making a treaty with the non-human

monsters who came in the ship! They say that we're selling out the rest of humanity! That we're making a
bargain to betray the world to horrors out of space, in return for safety for ourselves! They demand that
the United Nations take over the ship and its crew."
Soames whistled softly. The charge was just insane enough to be credited. There was no longer a ship,
too, and the children were far from monsters.  So  there  was  no way to  convince anyone that  America
even made an honest attempt to satisfy or answer the complaint. The matter of the children and their ship
had been  badly  handled.  But there  was  no way to  handle it well.  The  coming  of  the  children  was  a
catastrophe any way you looked at it.
"There was nothing to be done," mourned Captain Moggs, "but state the facts. Our  delegation said  the
ship crashed on landing, and its occupants needed time to recover from the shock and to develop some
way to  communicate with us.  Our  delegation  said  a  complete  report  hadn't  even  been  made  to  our
government, but that one will be prepared and made public immediately."
Gail looked up at Soames in the darkness. He nodded.
"That report," said Soames. "That's us. Particularly you."
"Yes," said Gail confidently. "You write the technical side, and I'll do a human-interest story for the UN
that will make everybody love them!"
Soames felt more than usually a scoundrel.
"Hold it," he said unhappily. "It's all right to make the kids attractive, but not too much. Do you remember
why?"
Gail stopped short.
"They don't  come  from a  comfortably distant  solar  system," said  Soames,  more  unhappily  still.  "They
come from Earth, from another time, where there are mountains falling from the sky. And the children's
families have to stay right where they are until flaming islands turn their sky to flame and crash down on
them to destroy them. Because we can't let them come here."
Gail stared up at him, and all the life went out of her face.
"Oh, surely!" she said with bitterness. "Surely! That's right! We can't afford it! I don't know about you or
the rest of the world, but I'm going to hate myself all the rest of my life!"
CHAPTER 6
SOAMES, remembering Rex, got two puppies for the children next morning. He was inside the cottage
when Captain Moggs turned up. He watched Mal and Hod, outside on the lawn, playing with the two

small dogs. Zani sat at a table indoors, drawing. Gail had shown her pictures of cities and provided her
with paper and soft pencils. Zani grasped the idea immediately. She drew, without remarkable  skill but
with a certain pleasing directness. Now she drew a city while Gail hovered near.
"I reported to Washington of your willingness to work on the report, Mr. Soames," said Captain Moggs
with gratification. "Your status has been clarified. The papers are on the way here now."
Soames started a little. From where he stood, he could watch Mal and  Hod  out of a  window,  and  by
turning his eyes he could see Zani. She could see nothing that went on where Mal cuddled  one  puppy,
girl-fashion, while Hod played in quite another fashion with the other. The window was behind Zani.
Soames had not been too attentive. He realized it.
"What's that, Captain?"
"Your  status  is  clarified,"  said  Captain  Moggs,  authoritatively.  "You  have  been  appointed  a  civilian
consultant. You had no official status before. The bookkeeping problem was serious. Now  you have a
civil service status, a rating, an assimilated rank and a security classification."
Soames  turned  again  to  watch  the  children  out-of-doors.  Fran  came  around  from  the  back  of  the
cottage. He carried something in his hands. It was a white rabbit. He'd brought it to show Mal and Hod.
They put down the puppies and gazed at it in amazement, stroking its fur and talking inaudibly.
Soames looked  swiftly at  Zani. Her  pencil had  ceased  to  make  strokes  upon  the paper.  She  had  the
expression of someone watching absorbedly, though her eyes were on the paper before her.
Gail stirred, and Soames made a gesture to her. Puzzled, she came to his side. He said quietly:
"Watch the kids outside and Zani at the same time."
Fran  retrieved  the rabbit  and  went away  with it,  to  give  it  back  to  its  owners.  Zani  returned  to  her
drawing. The two children outside went back to the puppies. One small dog sprawled triumphantly over
the other  with an expression  of bland  amiability on his face.  For  no reason  at  all,  he  began  to  chew
meditatively on the other puppy's ear. His victim protested with no indignation at all.
Zani, with her back to the scene, giggled to herself. The two children outdoors separated the puppies to
play with them again, individually.
"Zani knew," said Soames under his breath. "She knew what the others saw."
"It happens all the time," said Gail in a similar low tone. "I've noticed, since you pointed it out. But they
aren't telepaths! They talk to each other constantly. If they were telepaths they wouldn't need to."
Captain Moggs exclaimed. She'd gone to look at Zani's drawing:

"Really, Gail, the child draws very nicely! But do you think she should waste  time on pictures  like this,
when it's so important that she and the others learn English?"
Gail said quietly:
"She's drawing pictures of her own world.  That's  a  city like her people  build. I thought it would be  a
good idea to get such pictures from her."
Gail went to  look  at  the drawing, at  which Zani labored  with a  young girl's complacent  absorption  in
something she  knows  will  be  approved  by  a  grown-up  when  it's  done.  With  a  gesture,  Gail  invited
Soames to look. He did.
Zani had drawn the sky-line of a city, but it was an odd  one.  There  were  tall buildings, but their walls
were draping, catenary curves. There were splendid towers and soaring highways, which leaped across
emptiness to magnificent landings. There were groups of structures with no straight line visible anywhere.
"Interesting," said Soames. "That kind of building has been suggested as ultra-modern architecture. They
don't have an external steel frame. There's a central mast from which all the floors are hung. They have to
be braced by cables, which make catenary curves like suspension-bridges on end."
Zani went on with her drawing. Gail said:
"It isn't fantasy, then. Look at this. It's a—maybe you'll call it a car. Only it looks like a sled. Or maybe a
motorcycle."
She showed him a finished sketch. With a childish directness, yet a singular effect of direct observation,
Zani had drawn a vehicle. It did not have wheels. It rested on what looked like two short, thick runners
like skids.
"This isn't fantasy, either," said  Soames.  "There've  been  wheelless vehicles built lately. They're  held an
inch or so above the ground by columns of air pouring out. They ride on cushions of air. But they have to
have perfect highways. It isn't likely that a child would draw them if she hadn't seen them."
In silence, Gail showed other sketches. A man and  woman in costumes  somehow  related  to  those  the
children had worn at the beginning. There was a picture of a group of people.
"Odd," said Soames. "Everybody wears a belt like the children have on now. Everybody. As if it were
official."
He glanced  at  Zani.  She  wore  a  belt  over  American-style  young-girl's  clothing  today.  The  belt  was
neither leather nor plastic nor anything that could have a name put to it. It had two round and two square
medallions placed two on each side of the fastening, which was not a buckle. The others wore the same.
Soames puzzled over it for a moment.
Gail offered him another sheet of paper.

"I'm going to tear this up when you've seen it."
It was a landscape, sketched in with surprisingly bold strokes of the soft pencil. The time was night. Near
the bottom of the picture there was a city of the strange,  catenary-curve  architecture.  It  was  drawn  so
small, though, that most of the picture was black sky. But there was a blazing light upon the city, and it
came from something monstrous and jagged and incandescent and vast, plunging upon the city from the
sky, trailing flames behind it.
"And this," said Gail, very quietly.
It was a picture of a crater, a ring-mountain, the scene of the impact of something terrible  and  huge. It
was a chasm with circular, broken rocky walls. There was a fallen tree in the foreground, near the spot
from which the sketch seemed to have been made.
"You're right not to show anyone else those drawings," said Soames. "The kids are in a bad enough fix as
visitors of a superior race. If it should be realized that they're not here by accident, but somehow to open
a way for invasion by the population of a whole planet, well, you can just imagine ..."
Zani giggled suddenly, and he jumped. But her eyes were on the paper before her. Soames glanced out
the window. Mal had toppled over, and one of the puppies had climbed valiantly on her back and was
pulling with all his tiny might at a puppy-mouthful of her hair. His tail wagged vigorously the while. Hod
laughed, and Mal giggled, and inside the cottage Zani—who could not see what had happened—giggled
with them.
"She couldn't see it, but she knew what happened," said Soames. "I suspect this place  is so  top-secret
that it's a breach of security to remember it outside. If anybody notices that little trick  the kids  can  do,
they'll be suspected of casually inspecting high-secrecy stuff while drawing pictures or  playing with little
dogs."
Soames returned to his quarters. He set to work upon the highly necessary task of pretending that he was
a castaway  from the children's  civilization in order  to  improvise conveniences  that  as  a  castaway  he'd
consider crude, but as an aborigine amazing.
From time to time, though, he wondered sardonically about the public-relations program on the children.
He'd prepared a complete report about the ship, telling in detail about its arrival and adding everything he
could infer about the civilization that had made it, except its location on the Earth of aeons  ago  and  its
imminent doom. Gail had written what she considered the best human-interest story of her life about the
children. Neither report  was  asked  for.  Nobody  knew  where  either was  to  be  sent.  Soames  guessed
sardonically at a change of policy somewhere.
But the problem justified worry, the simple, relatively insignificant problem of the children here and now,
with all thought of flaming skies and upheaved earth put firmly aside.

The children had  to  be  revealed.  But the world  would automatically assume  that  the crew  of an alien
spaceship  must  be  in  some  fashion  monsters.  But  four  nicely  raised  children?  Space-travellers?
Spaceships  navigated by boys  and  girls who liked to  play  with  puppies?  Such  innocuous  persons  to
represent the most deadly danger the modern world had faced?
But they did represent it. There was no way out of the fact. And somehow the facts had to be put across.
The public-relations counsellors who had interviewed the children pointed  out the means.  They got the
job.
The advance publicity was thoroughly professional. The spaceship's company was to be revealed in the
most stupendous broadcast of all time. For the second time in history, a trans-Atlantic relay patrol would
form two relay-channels from North America to Europe. It would reach  Japan  via the Aleutians and  a
relay-ship, by wire from Japan to all Asia and—again relayed—to Australia. South Africa would get the
coverage by land-wire  down  the continent from the Pillars of Hercules.  The Mediterranean  basin,  the
Near East, Scandinavia, and even Iceland would see the spectacle.  Detailed  instructions were  given to
Gail to give to the children.
The very top feminine TV personality of America would serve as hostess, substituting for Gail, who must
try to  make  the  children  understand.  Miss  Linda  Beach  could  establish  a  personal  contact  with  any
audience. One had only to watch her to respond to her charm, her wholesomeness, her adroit sincerity.
She had  sold  soap,  automobiles,  vitamin tablets  and  dessicated  soup.  Obviously, she  was  the perfect
saleswoman for the children out of space.
"I hope the professionals know what they're doing," Soames had said to Gail. "I'm a simple soul who'd
be inclined to tell the truth without trimmings. It might not be easy, and it might not be comfortable, but it
would be fact."
A small fast transport came to get the children and Gail and Soames. It took off.
Soames took a seat beside Fran. He took out a pencil and a pad of paper. He drew a sketch of a boy
flying a kite, and added a close-up drawing of the kite. He drew a boy walking on stilts, and a drawing of
how stilts were made. Soames hadn't actually seen a boy walking on stilts for years, and it might now be
a lost art, but Fran showed interest. Soames drew a bicycle with a boy on it, and then modified the bike
into a motorcycle. He hoped his sketches would strike Fran as interesting, if primitive, things a boy might
do for his own satisfaction.
Fran was intrigued. Presently he took the pencil and made sketches of his own. A boy with a belt like his
rode something which vaguely resembled  a  sledge  or  a  motorcycle.  He  made  a  detailed  drawing of a
runner. This  was  an  air-sled,  such  as  Zani  had  pictured  in  more  elaborate  form.  Fran  sketched  the
air-column generator, and it was utterly simple and a boy of fourteen could make it. After painful scrutiny
Soames realized that it was a ram-jet engine which would start itself and operate in still air. In the modern
world, it would make gas-turbine engines practical for locomotives and motorcars.
The transport  landed.  A motorcycle  escort  surrounded  the car  with drawn  curtains which  carried  the
children from Idlewild into New York. In time the car dived down into the freight entrance  of the new

Communications Building on 59th Street. Secret  Service  men had  cleared  all corridors  so  the children
reached their dressing-rooms unseen.
Linda Beach appeared an hour later and began the rehearsal.
The children gathered the purpose of the thing by watching the monitors.  They chattered  together,  and
the  girls  went  pleasantly  through  what  was  expected  of  them.  Hod  seemed  quite  numb,  and  Fran
scowled. But he was more gracious when he saw Soames going through similar antics.
The rehearsal ended. There was  another  long wait.  This was  to  introduce  the children—from a  totally
unknown and superior civilization—to a world which considered them strangers from space, when they
were actually from a much more improbable homeland. The world was waiting to see this. Time dragged.
All over the world people were waiting to get a first glimpse of creatures whose coming might mean the
end of the world.
Presently it began.
The show, naturally, opened with a tremendous fanfare of trumpets, played from tape.
Then Linda Beach appeared. She introduced Gail and Soames and Captain Moggs.
This broadcast was supposed to be strictly informative. It was, however, produced with the attitude and
the technique and the fine professionalism of specialists in the area of subconscious selling. So  it put its
audience—the vast majority of it—into the exact  mood  of people  who surrender  themselves to  mildly
lulling make-believe. When Captain Moggs told of the finding of the ship, her authoritative manner and
self-importance made people feel, without regard to their thoughts, that she was an un-funny comedian.
The audience remembered with decreasing concern that some interesting monsters were supposed to be
in the show later and that they were waiting to see them.
The introduction of the children was a disappointment, but a mild one.  When they were  produced  and
identified, the television-watching syndrome was fully developed. There was a feeling, of course, that the
show fell down in interest and that it did not live up to its advance publicity. But the television audience is
used to that. Its members continued to watch with slightly dulled eyes, listening with partly attentive ears,
automatically waiting for a  commercial when it could  get some  beer  or  an  equivalent  without  missing
anything.
Even when tumult and confusion began; when Linda Beach tried to hold the show together in the teeth of
uproar behind her, the tranquillized state of the audience continued. When Linda Beach's  necklace  was
snatched from her neck it seemed intended to be funny.
It wasn't  until the very end  that anything occurred  really  to  break  the  mood  professionally  produced
shows are designed to achieve. That occurrence  startled  the viewers  out of their semi-comatose  state,
just as blatant obscenity or intolerable profanity would have done. Linda Beach,  in fine sincerity and  in
tribute to the children, made a statement which was utterly explosive. When the show ended, people all
over the world were roused and horrified and enraged.

Only small children, waiting in space-helmets and with ray-guns ready, complained aggrievedly that there
hadn't been any monsters. The adults felt that there had been. That there were.
They hated the children with a strictly personal hatred based on panic combined with shame.
CHAPTER 7
SOAMES' rehearsed part in the broadcast was finished after he and Gail and Captain Moggs had  told
the story of the finding of the ship. Their narratives were deftly guided by Linda Beach's questions.
Soames wanted to get out of sight. He was sunk in gloom. It was a show instead of what he would have
considered a presentation of the facts, though nearly everything said had been factual. He left the studio.
In  an  uninhabited  room  he  found  himself  staring  out  a  window,  down  at  the  crowd  before  the
Communications Building.
It  was  a  restless  crowd,  now.  The  ground-floor  plate-glass  windows  had  been  filled  with  television
screens, and those near them could see the broadcast and hear it through out-door  loud-speakers.  But
this crowd was a special one, in that it hadn't gathered to see the broadcast but extraterrestrial monsters,
in the flesh or fur or scales or however they might appear. It now knew that the monsters had arrived and
there was no chance of seeing them direct. It had been harangued  by orators  and  people  who already
began to call themselves humanity-firsters. It felt cheated.
There were a large number of teen-agers in the crowd.
At the window, Soames recognized the oddity of the crowd below him. An ordinary,  curiosity-seeking
crowd  would contain a  considerable  percentage  of women.  This did not.  There  were  shouting voices
which Soames heard faintly. They were orators declaiming assorted emotional opinions about  monsters
from space, obviously in the belief that they were beyond dispute and  needed  to  be  acted  on at  once.
There was competition among these  orators.  Some  had  bands  of supporters  around  them to  aid their
effectiveness  by  applause  and  loud  agreement.  Soames  saw,  too,  at  least  one  hilarious  group  of
college-age boys who might have been organized by a college humor magazine. They waved cardboard
signs. "Space-Monsters Go Home!"
The unattended monitor set, placed around some corner in a corridor, gave out an excellently modulated
reproduction of the program going on the air. An Italian physicist asked questions about the qualifications
of such young children as space navigators. Soames listened abstractedly. He knew unhappily that if the
children weren't  convincing as  visitors from space,  they'd  be  much less  plausible in their true  roles  as
fugitives out of time.
The collegians surged here and there, making a demonstration in favor of mirth. There were also youthful
members of less innocuous groups, swaggering, consciously ominous members of organizations known as

the Maharajas and the Comets and the Toppers. Members of these groups eyed members of other such
groups with challenging, level gazes.
Voices harangued. Collegians attempted to  sing what must have seemed  to  them a  deliciously satirical
song. But it did not please the non-collegian Maharajas or Comets or the Toppers.
A Russian scientist took over on the broadcast. He had been flown to the United States especially for the
occasion. He asked elaborate and carefully loaded questions. They had  been  prepared  as  propaganda
stumpers by people who in their way were as skilled in public relations as  the producers  of this show.
Linda  Beach  applied  the  charm  which  had  sold  soap,  vitamins,  automobiles  and  dessicated  soup.
Soames heard the exchanges from the monitor set.
Outside, in the street, a brick suddenly fell among the collegians. More bricks fell among those engaged
in an impromptu meeting of Humanity Firsters. Police whistles blew.  A plate-glass  window crashed.  A
collegian suddenly had a bloody face and a flying wedge of Maharajas scornfully cut through the formerly
singing group, wielding belts and bludgeons for the honor of having started  a  riot on 57th  Street.  They
fought past the college crowd and into a band of the Comets. There they found a  rumble ready-made.
Haranguing orators  found themselves jostled.  Fights broke  out among members  of  groups  which  had
come to stage demonstrations against extraterrestrials. The fighting spread to individuals.
Police-car sirens wailed. Squad-cars came careening out of uptown-traffic streets and converged on the
tumult. The sirens produced violent surgings of the crowd. There was  a  wild rush in this direction  as  a
siren sounded from that, and then an equally wild rush in another direction still as blazing headlights and a
moving  howl  came  from  elsewhere.  Rushing  figures  surged  against  the  doors  to  the  lobby  of  the
Communications Building.
Members of the Toppers  and  the Comets  and  the Maharajas  and  other  fanatics rushed  up the stairs.
There was a sign "On the Air" lighted from behind outside the studio in which the world-wide broadcast
was in progress. There was a door. They opened it.
The  watching  world  heard  the  racket  as  a  former  Nobel  prize-winner's  stilted  questions  about  the
children were drowned out. This was not a  planned  invasion. It  was  a  totally chaotic  rushing-about  of
people who'd been half hysterical to start with, who had been crushed in a senselessly swaying mob, had
been pushed bodily into a building-lobby jammed past endurance, and escaped into a maze from which
they'd blundered into a studio with a broadcast going on. Stagehands and necktie-less persons rushed to
throw them out. But the noise grew greater while Linda Beach tried gamely to cover it up.
It was not easy. In fact, it was impossible. One of the Toppers found himself cornered by two stagehands
and dashed triumphantly across that sacrosanct space, the area  in a  camera's  field of vision. He  raced
behind Linda Beach, then smiling pleasantly and talking at the top of her voice to cover the noise behind
her. The Topper  snatched  as  he went by.  Linda Beach  staggered,  and  her  necklace  broke,  and  this
particular juvenile delinquent plunged into the crowd  by the doorway  and  wormed  his way through to
lose himself in the crush outside.
But now the cops from the squad-cars were at work.

The lobby began to be partially cleared. Fugitives from panic came down into the street where they were
commanded to get moving and keep moving. They did.
And Soames arrived at the studio. He'd fought his way there with a sort of white-hot  passion,  because
Gail  was  where  this  lunatic  mob  might  trample  her.  He  raged,  and  then  he  saw  her  standing  with
precarious composure out of the way of everything.
Fran  dragged  fiercely at  his arm.  His eyes  burned.  He  thrust  something  upon  Soames  and  frantically
repeated the one word of his scanty English vocabulary which seemed to fit. The word was, "Try! Try!
Try!" He reached around Soames' waist and linked a belt about him.
Soames had  the abrupt  conviction that he was  going mad.  He  stood,  himself, in the studio  where  the
tumult was now almost ended. But he looked up at himself from the level of his own breast. Also he was
down in the lobby of the Communications Building, mingling with the thinning mob there, allowing himself
to be shepherded out into the street. There he was surrounded by people taller than himself. That part of
his awareness reached the open air and  moved  swiftly westward.  That part  of him put his hand in his
pocket—but Soames had nothing to do with the action—and  felt things there.  There  was  a  chain with
sharp-edged, faceted things on it. There was a belt with shaped metallic objects fastened to it....
"Try!" cried Fran desperately. "Try!"
And suddenly Soames  realized.  He  heard  the street-sounds  through someone  else's  ears.  He  saw  the
street through someone else's eyes. Simultaneously he saw himself in the studio  through someone  else's
eyes, Fran's. And this explained the behavior of the children with puppies and English lessons and items
of information which all of them seemed to know when one knew. The children were not telepathic. They
could not read each other's minds. But someone or all of the decorative squares and circles on their belts
enabled them to  share  each  other's  sense-impressions.  They were  both  broadcasters  and  receivers  of
sensory impressions. And therefore it was because Soames had Mal's belt about him that he could  see
what Fran  saw,  and  hear  what Fran  heard,  and  also  he  saw  and  heard  and  felt  what  an  oily-haired
member of the Toppers  saw  and  heard  and  felt with  Hod's  belt  in  his  pocket  beside  Linda  Beach's
necklace, snatched from her neck even before the camera.
But there was no sign that the oily-haired person saw or heard or felt what Soames did. Perhaps because
he was not wearing the belt, but only had it crumpled together in his pocket.
"Right!" said Soames harshly. "I'll get it back!"
He plunged toward the studio door. There had been Secret Service men assigned to guard the children.
Soames caught one of them by the shoulder.
"The kids have been robbed," he snapped in the Secret Service man's ear. "Secret device! We've got to
get it back! I can do it! Come along!"
The Secret Service man instantly followed him. And Soames tore through the scared people still aimlessly
wandering about. He plunged down the stairs. A squad-car cop moved to check his rush, and the Secret

Service man panted an identification and a need. The cop abandoned all other matters and followed, too.
Soames needed to close his eyes to see what the Topper saw. He blinked them shut while he ran three
paces. The Topper walked, now. He'd been joined by two friends. Soames heard his voice, he even felt
the motions of his lips and tongue in speech. He boasted that he'd snatched the beads off Linda Beach's
neck, and got a fancy belt one of those funny-dressed kids was wearing.
Half a  block.  Two  more  of the Toppers  joined  the  bragging  snatcher.  They  also  heard  of  his  grand
achievement. The Topper  drew  his loot  partly from his pocket  to  prove  his boast.  They looked,  and
swaggered, and whooped to others of their fellowship.
Soames pelted around a corner, turning it without warning. The Secret Service man and  the cop  lost a
dozen paces. Soames raced ahead. There was a cluster of late-teen-age boys on the sidewalk of Eighth
Avenue. They wanted to see the loot.
Soames plunged into them. Without a word, he tackled and bore to the ground the one in whose pocket
Hod's belt and Linda Beach's necklace still reposed.
Their reaction was instant. The Toppers were in a close group. Soames hit it and fell to the ground atop
one of their number. The others instantly attacked him as if by reflex action.  They stamped  and  kicked
viciously.
But there was a cop and a Secret Service man on the way. They struck. The Toppers turned to fight and
fled instead at the sight of two adults already administering punishment to those within reach and coming
on to reach others.
The two officers pulled Soames to his feet. In seconds he'd been badly battered.  He  pulled Hod's  belt
out from the pocket  of the snarling, now-pallid  member of the Toppers,  who  was  half-strangled  and
shaken. He got the necklace. Numbly, he felt again and found a stray stone or two.
"All right," he said thickly. "I got it. I'll get back to the kids with it."
The cop took the Topper. Soames and the Secret Service man got back to the studio. The show was still
on. Soames exhaustedly handed Hod his belt, and stripped off the other belt that Fran had put on him.
He gave it back to Fran. Fran's eyes still burned, but he regarded Soames with definite respect. Perhaps
there was even liking. And Soames held up the recovered necklace for Linda Beach to see, though she
was then still before the camera.
She was a seasoned performer. Without blinking an eye she changed what she was saying, called on Gail
to  have  the  children  demonstrate  the  devices  they'd  brought  from  the  wrecked  ship,  and  came  to
Soames. She counted the stones swiftly, and asked questions.
He  told  her.  It  would  come  out,  necessarily.  The  children  had,  built  into  their  belts,  devices  which
produced an effect on the order of telepathy. But it was not telepathy. Undoubtedly the devices could be
turned on or off. Turned on, they linked together the senses of those who wore them, not the minds, but

the senses. Each saw what the others saw, and heard what the others heard, and felt with the rest.  But
thoughts were not shared. Such a device would not be  confusing if one  were  used  to  it, and  two  men
working together could co-operate with a thousand times the effectiveness of men without them. Children
playing together could have a degree of companionship otherwise impossible. And four children upon a
desperate voyage, without adults to  reassure  them, would need  this close  linkage with their fellows. It
would give them courage. They could be more resolute.
Linda  Beach  went  back  to  camera-position  and  waited  until  the  demonstration  of  the  pocket
metal-cutting device, by Fran, was ended. Then she signalled for her own camera and  definitely put on
the  charm.  She  showed  the  necklace.  She  said  it  had  been  stolen.  She  said  that  the  children  were
telepaths,  and  by the reading of the criminal's mind he had  been  tracked  down  through  the  crowded
streets outside the studio, and her necklace recovered.
It  is  always  better  to  say  something  that  is  not  quite  the  truth  but  is  perfectly  understandable  than
something  which  is  true  but  bewildering.  This  is  a  cardinal  rule  in  television.  Never  bewilder  your
audience! So Linda Beach did not bewilder her audience by accurate statement. She told them something
they would understand. It made the children convincingly more than merely ordinary children.
It shocked her world-wide audience out of that bemused condition the professionalism of the broadcast
had produced. It lifted them out of their seats, those who were seated. It tended to lift the hair of the rest,
those who realized that monsters from space  who could  read  human minds were  utterly invincible and
infinitely to be dreaded. No matter what the children looked  like, now,  they had  been  declared  on an
official fact-revealing broadcast to be extraterrestrial monsters who could read human minds!
It raised hell.
Once said, it could not be withdrawn. It could be denied, but it would be believed. In higher echelons of
government all over  the world  it  produced  such  raging  hatred  of  the  children  and  the  United  States
together as made all previous  tensions seem  love-feasts  by comparison.  In Russia it was  instantly and
bitterly believed that all Soviet military secrets were now in process of being plucked from Russian brains
and given to  the American military. Rage  came  from helplessness  in the face  of such an achievement.
There could be no way to stop such espionage, and military action would be hopeless if the Americans
knew all about it before it was tried. In more  tranquil nations there  was  deep  uneasiness,  and  in some
there was  terror.  And everywhere  that men hated  or  stole  or  schemed—which  was  everywhere—the
belief that everybody's secrets were open to the children filled men with rage.
Of all public-relations  enterprises  in human history, the world-wide  broadcast  about  the  children  was
most disastrous.
Soames and Gail could realize the absurdity of the thing, without any hope of stopping or correcting it.
They went swiftly back to the hidden base in the Rockies. Soames stayed to have certain minor injuries
attended to. Also he needed to get in touch with the two physicists who had seen the children and known
despair,  but  who  now  played  at  being  castaways  with  gratifying  results.  In  part  he  was  needed  for
endless, harassing consultations with people who wanted  urgently to  disbelieve everything he said,  and

managed to hold on to a great deal of doubt.
Meanwhile there came about a sullen and infuriated lessening of international tension.  No  nation would
dare plan a sneak attack on America if it could be known in advance. And nobody dared make threats if
the United States could know exactly how much of the threat was genuine.
Captain Moggs flew busily back  and  forth between  the east  and  the hidden missile base  to  which the
children had been returned. She informed Soames that the decorated belts had been taken away from the
children. One of them had been opened up and the round  and  square  medallions on it examined. One
decoration was undoubtedly the case for the sensory-linkage apparatus. There was a way to  turn it on
and  off.  It  contained  a  couple  of  eccentrically  shaped  bits  of  metal.  That  was  all.  Duplicated,  the
duplicates  did nothing whatever.  The other  medallions seemed  to  contain  apparatus  for  purposes  yet
unguessed-at. One actually had a minute moving part in it. But what it did was past imagining.
Captain Moggs said authoritatively:
"It will take time but we'll find out what it does. Of course right now all research is concentrated on the
telepathic  device.  It  will  be  developed  and  before  long  we  will  be  thoroughly  informed  about  the
weapons  and  the councils of other  nations.  It  will be  magnificent! We'll no longer  have  reason  to  be
apprehensive of attack, and we can evaluate every military situation with absolute precision!"
"Dammit!" snapped  Soames.  "The gadgets  aren't  telepathic!  They  don't  transmit  thoughts!  They  only
exchange sensory  information! And there's  no danger  of the children finding out anything by telepathy
when they can only share the sensations of someone wearing a special device! What would they do with
military information if they had it?"
Captain Moggs  looked  mysterious. She  departed,  and  Soames  again cursed  bitterly the situation he'd
happened  to  create.  But still he did not see  how  he  could  have  done  otherwise  than  to  destroy  the
children's high-power signalling device when they would have used it back on Antarctica. Yet he was not
happy about the consequences of his act.
He found time to get in touch with the physicists who'd come out to the Rocky Mountain base.  They'd
found a few others who could put themselves into the mental state of castaways who knew that a given
device could be made, and then tried to make something which wasn't it but had some of its properties.
In a  way it  was  deliberate  self-deception,  but  it  was  deliberate  to  circumvent  a  natural  habit  of  the
educated  mind. A trained  man almost invariably tries  to  see  what can  be  done  with what he has  and
knows, instead of imagining what he wants and then trying to make something more or less like it, even if
he has to look for the knowledge he will need. It took a particular type of mind to use Soames' trick. It
was  necessary,  for  example,  to  imagine  limitations  to  the  operation  of  a  desired  device,  or  one's
starting-point became mere fantasy. And nothing could be made from fantasy.
But  Soames  found  frustration  rampant  even  among  the  men  who  were  most  successful  with  the
fantasy-trick. There were new devices. They were triumphs. They were plainly the beginnings of progress
of a brand-new kind, not derived wholly from the present, and certainly not imitative of the children's. But
the devices couldn't be used. Their existence couldn't be  revealed.  Because  anything of unprecedented

design  would  seem  to  have  been  learned  from  the  children,  and  the  United  States
insisted—truthfully—that so far it had learned nothing from them. But nobody would believe it if a spate
of astonishing technological improvements began to appear in the United States.
Dislike of America rose to new heights anyhow. But presently some trace of suspicion began to appear in
the actions of the anti-American nations. Before the broadcast, a dirty trick  had  been  prepared  against
America. It developed and succeeded. It was not discovered until too late. Somebody tried another one.
It wasn't anticipated or stopped. A very lively and extremely tempting idea  occurred  in quarters  where
the United States was much disliked. But nobody dared quite believe it—yet.
Then Fran disappeared. He vanished as if into thin air.  At one  moment he was  in the heavily guarded
surface area over the hidden base in the Rockies. The next moment he was gone. Three separate lines of
electrified fence protected  the area  from intrusion, with sentries  and  watching-posts  besides.  But Fran
disappeared as if he'd never been. It was not easy to imagine that  he'd  run away.  His English was  still
very limited. His ignorance of American ways was abysmal. He couldn't hope to hide and find food while
accomplishing anything at all. On the other hand, for him to have been kidnapped out of the top-secret
base was unthinkable. Yet if he had ...
Soames got transportation to the Rocky Mountain installation.
He was shocked when he saw Gail.
CHAPTER 8
SHE smiled faintly in the darkness after they'd paused on the way to the cottage, and after Soames had
released her.
"When this is all over, we'll have our life together, you know that, don't you?"
"I'm glad," she said quietly, "that you feel the way you do. I'm thinner. I'm not very pretty just now. But
it's because I'm worried, Brad."
He muttered angrily. He felt that infuriated rage which was appropriate because something worried Gail.
"I told the children you were coming," Gail added. "I think they'll be glad to see you. I've  an idea  Fran
especially liked you, Brad."
"No word of him?"
"N-no," said Gail in an odd tone.
"Did  he  run  away?"  demanded  Soames.  They  were  walking  through  a  soft-warm  dusk  toward  the
cottage where Gail stayed with the children.

Gail said in a low tone:
"Careful! The idea of telepathy is alarming. Everything's overheard, Brad. The children are watched every
second. I even think there are microphones...."
Soames scowled.
"It's security," said Gail. "It would be taking too big a gamble to risk  that  the children can  only receive
sensory impressions and only through those little devices in their belts. Nobody's been able to make the
belt-devices do more than that, but they can't be sure...."
"They took the belts away!" insisted Soames.
"Yes. But it doesn't seem enough. You destroyed their signalling device. But you don't feel safe. They've
taken the devices, but they still don't feel sure that the children can't do more.
"And, I thought it was wise to  tell Captain  Moggs  about  us.  To  explain why you might want to  come
back  here.  They  know  I'm  rather  protective  of  the  children.  An  explanation  for  you  to  come  back
seemed wise. The children aren't popular since they've been thought able to read minds. So I wanted you
to be able to come back without anybody suspecting you of friendly feelings for them."
"I'd have come back on account of you," growled Soames. "So it mustn't appear that anybody wants to
be decent to them, eh?" Then he said abruptly, "About Fran...."
"He ran away," said Gail with a hint of defiance. "I'll tell you more later, maybe."
They reached the cottage, and Soames reminded himself that anything he said  would very probably  be
overheard and recorded on tape. They went inside. The boy Hod, and the younger girl Mal lay on their
stomachs  on the floor,  doggedly working at  what would be  lessons.  Zani sat  in  a  chair  with  a  book
before her and her hand seemingly shielding her eyes. Her expression was abstracted.
As they entered, Hod made a clicking sound in his throat. Zani put one hand quickly in her pocket and
opened her eyes. They had been closed. The book was a prop to hide something.
Soames had a flash of insight. He'd worn a belt with a built-in quasi-telepathic device just once and for
the briefest of times. While he wore it, too, he'd been fiercely intent upon the use of it to recover another
such device that had been looted in the broadcast studio during the most disastrous of all public-relations
enterprises.  He'd  had  no  time  for  experiment;  no  time  to  accustom  himself  to  the  singular  feeling  of
seeming to inhabit more than one body at a time. He'd had no opportunity to explore the possibilities of
the device. But he'd worked out some angles since.
And because  of it, he knew  intuitively what Zani had  been  doing when he arrived.  With closed  eyes,
hidden by her hand,  she'd  been  receiving something that  came  from  somewhere  else.  The  two  other
children had kept silent. Hod clicked his tongue as a warning of Gail's and Soames' approach. And Zani

put her hand in her pocket quickly and opened her eyes. She'd put something away. And Soames knew
with certainty  that she'd  been  receiving a  message  from Fran,  in  the  teeth  of  merciless  watching  and
probably microphonic eavesdropping on every word.
But the children's belt with the sensory-transmitters and receivers had been taken from them.
Little Mal said politely:
"Fran." A pause. "Where is?"
"I'd like to know," Soames told her.
"That's almost the only thing they're ever questioned about, nowadays," said Gail. "As a security measure
only Captain Moggs and enlisted personnel without classified information, and the police who're hunting
for Fran, are allowed to talk to them."
"Fran's been gone—how long? A week? Over?" Soames scowled. "How can he hide? He  knows  little
English! He doesn't even know how to act so he won't be spotted if he walks down a street!"
Gail said with an odd intonation:
"I'm afraid he's in the wilds somewhere. He won't know how to get food. He'll be  in danger  from wild
animals. I'm terribly afraid for him!"
Soames looked at her sharply.
"How'd he get away?"
"He roamed around, like boys do," said Gail. "He made friends, more or less, with the children of a staff
sergeant's family. It was thought there could be no harm in that. And one morning he left here apparently
to go and play with them, and they didn't see him, and he hasn't been seen since."
Hod was on his stomach again, doggedly working over a book, murmuring English words as  he turned
the pages from one picture to another. Mal and Zani looked from the face of Soames to that of Gail, and
back again.
"They understand more than they can speak," said Gail.
Soames searched the walls of the room. Gail had said microphones were probable. He looked intently at
Zani. He duplicated her position when he'd entered and her actions, the quick movement of her hand to
her pocket and the opening of her eyes. She tensed, staring at him. He shook his head warningly and put
his finger to his lips.
She caught her breath and looked at him strangely. He settled down to visit. Gail, with the air of someone

doing something that did not matter, had the children display their English. Their accent was good. Their
vocabularies  were  small. Soames  guessed  that  Gail  drilled  them  unceasingly  in  pronunciation  so  they
wouldn't acquire so many words that they could be expected to answer involved questions. It was a way
to postpone pressure upon them.
But it was not a good idea for Soames to have too parental or  too  solicitous an attitude.  He  said  with
inner irony:
"I'm disappointed in Fran. He shouldn't have run away. He made some sketches for me, of things boys
his age  make,  at  home.  I  wanted  to  get  more  such  pictures  from  him.  Hmmm....  Did  he  leave  any
sketches around when he disappeared?"
Gail shook her head.
"No. Every scrap of paper the children use  is gathered  up every  night, for study.  They don't  like it. It
disturbs them. Actually, I believe language experts are trying to find out something about their language,
but they feel like it's enmity. They're jumpy."
"And with reason," said Soames. He stirred. "I'm disappointed. I'll go talk to the people who're hunting
Fran. Walk back with me to the store, Gail?"
Gail rose. Zani stared at Soames. She was pale. He nodded to her again.
Gail and Soames went out into the now fully fallen night. Soames said gruffly:
"We'd better walk closer together.
"When we're married," he said abruptly, "I doubt  we'll hide many things from each  other.  We'd  better
start  being  frank  right  now.  The  kids'  belts  may  have  been  taken  away,  but  they've  got
sensory-transmission gadgets just the same. Zani was using one when we went in the cottage."
Gail's footsteps faltered. "Wh-what are you going to do?"
"Give some  good  advice,"  said  Soames.  "Tell the kids  you know  about  it. Point out that  the Security
people have three of the four belts, and they can wear them and pick up communications. Sooner or later
they will and the kids will be caught. If Fran talks aloud they can pick up and identify his voice. If Zani
writes, and looks at what she's written so he can read it through her eyes, her hand or her dress in what
she  sees  could  identify  her.  I'm  telling  you  to  remind  Zani  that  communication  by  those  sensory
transmitters  can  be  overheard.  Sooner  or  later  it  will  be.  She  must  work  out  ways  to  avoid  being
identified. If they think more people of her race have landed, that's all right. But it may be  bad  if she's
caught communicating with Fran."
Gail said nothing for a long time.

"That's—that's all?"
"Just about. I'm Fran's antagonist in one matter only. I'll do anything I can to keep him from calling all his
race to come here. I hate it, but I'll do it. Outside of that, I feel that he's here through my fault. I do not
want him to be psychologically vivisected by people who want everything he knows, and  won't  believe
there are limits to it. So long as he's at large, there probably won't be frenzied questioning of the others."
"The—things in the belt are very simple," said Gail unsteadily, "and the children were scared and jumpy
when they were taken away. So Fran told me, and he'd picked up some scraps of metal. Copper, it was.
And I watched for him."
Soames said nothing.
"He took a straw," said Gail, "and used it as a sort of blowpipe. He could direct the flame of a candle I
made for him. It would be heat-treatment?"
Soames nodded, in the darkness.
"It would. A pattern of heat-treatment might give a metal all sorts of properties we haven't guessed  at."
He added sardonically, "And it could be so simple that a boy could remember and do it!"
"He made six communicators," said Gail. "I insisted on six. And then I chose two at random for safety's
sake, I suppose. And he and the other children hid theirs. I tried these two. They work. One is for you.
Of course."
She fumbled something into his hand. It was tiny; hardly larger than a match.
"You push in the end. It works as long as you push it."
Soames pressed on one end where there was something that felt like the head of a pin. It probably was.
It gave a  little, and  instantly he saw  what Gail saw  and  felt what she  felt, his hand  clasping  hers.  He
released the tiny object and again was only himself.
"Turn yours off," he said harshly. "Remind the kids that this sort of thing can be intercepted."
"I'll tell them," said Gail.
"They're much worse off than they were," he told her. "A little while ago  all the world  wanted  to  learn
from the kids. Now it's afraid they'll learn from it, about  the people  in it. I think everybody'd  be  quite
willing to forego all possible benefits from their coming, if only something would happen to them."
"But they can't pry into secrets!" protested Gail. "You know they can't read minds! They can't!"
"But they have the reputation and have to suffer for it," said Soames.

They were then very close to the pseudo general store. Gail put her hand lightly on Soames' arm. "Brad,
please be careful."
He went into the store. He went through to the stock-room  behind,  pressed  a  button,  and  an elevator
door  opened  in  a  rather  surprising  manner.  He  stepped  inside  and  the  elevator  lowered  him  three
hundred feet into the earth.
On the way out from the East he'd sunk into gloomy meditation about the situation of the children and for
that matter of the world, since their arrival. Fran had an urgent mission he felt he must perform at any risk.
He couldn't do it on the missile base.
Fran felt the hatred surrounding all of them from the conclusion of the broadcast. He knew that nobody,
anywhere, would help him do something he had to do. So he fled in order to try somehow to  send  the
signal Soames had prevented from beside the wrecked spaceship.
But why must Fran send it? Why hadn't an automatic device been used? Something which could  be  so
ruggedly built that it could not possibly smash....
And suddenly there was an explanation.
Up to  this moment Soames  had  doggedly accepted  the idea  that  the children came  out  of  a  past  so
remote that numbers of years simply had no meaning. The evidence was overwhelming even though the
law of the conservation of mass and energy denied the possibility of time-travel. Now, abruptly, Soames
saw the infinitely simple answer. Time-travel was possible, provided certain conditions were met. Those
conditions would at first instance inevitably produce a monstrous burst of static and an implosion to cause
an earth-shock and a concussion wave audible at  eighty miles distance.  Once  communication between
time-frames had been established, however ...
The flight of Fran  instantly became  something so  much more  alarming than mere  danger  to  Fran,  that
there was only one thing Soames could possibly do. He'd said he was not Fran's enemy. But he must do
anything to keep Fran from carrying out the mission he'd been sent to accomplish.
So when Soames got out of the elevator from the village store, he went directly to a security officer.
"I'm worried about the boy Fran, who ran away," he observed. "Can you tell me what happened?"
"I'd like somebody to tell me!" said the security officer morbidly. "If he ran, he had wings on his shoes.
And now he's out he's got me scared! You know those telepathic gadgets in the belts the children wore?
We took 'em away. We opened one of 'em up, but we left the others in working order. We tried them.
When two men wear them, with both turned on, they sort of half-way read each other's minds. Each man
knows what the other is doing and seeing. But one man by himself can't do a thing. Two men can do a
lot. It's been suggested that if they knew the trick of it, three men could do all the telepathy they wanted,
read minds and all that. We haven't found out the trick, though."

Soames nodded, marvelling at the ability of the human race to find reasons to believe anything it wanted
to, whether for sweet vanity's sake or for the sake of scaring itself to death.
"When we first got the belts from the kids," pursued the security officer, "we figured there might be some
other folks of the kids' race on Earth, figuring on ways to get 'em loose. We had a belt worn night and
day. Nothing. So we stopped monitoring. Then this Fran  got away  and  we  started  monitoring all over
again, trying to  pick  up any working of belts  like  these  that  we  didn't  know  about.  And  we  started
picking up stuff right away!"
Soames stared. Zani'd been using one such instrument.
"A man's got one  of those  belts  on," said  the security man, frowning, "and it's  like he didn't.  Nothing
happens at all. But after maybe hours, maybe a day or  two,  suddenly,  with his eyes  closed,  he sees  a
page of outlandish writing. The kind of writing those kids do. It can't be photographed, because it's only
inside your head that you see it. You can't make sense of it. The alphabet isn't ours. The words are the
language they talk among themselves. I figure there's a ship somewhere, broadcasting a call to the kids.
The call's printed. If the kids had their belts on, and turned on, they could read it. But we got their belts.
So this Fran, he broke away to try to make some kind of way to answer that call!"
Soames said nothing. But he was unhappily amused, at himself as well as the security officer. He'd gone
to some pains to tell Gail how the children might communicate with Fran without being caught at it. But
they knew.  They'd  produced  this  theory  of  a  hovering  ship  of  space,  broadcasting  to  Earth  to  four
children hidden somewhere on it. There was no ship. There was only Fran, desperate to perform the task
he'd been sent here to do, keeping in touch with the other three children by a tiny unit he'd made out of
scrap copper and a straw and a candle-flame. And it was so natural that the fact wasn't guessed!
"How's he managing to  eat?"  asked  Soames.  "He's  no money and  next to  no English, and  he doesn't
know how to act...."
"He's smart!" said the security officer grimly. "He's hiding by day. At night.... People don't usually tell the
cops  about  a  bottle  of milk missing from their doorsteps.  A grocer  doesn't  report  one  loaf  of  bread
missing from the package left in front of his store before daybreak. He'd pick a loaf of bread today, and
a bottle  of  milk  tomorrow.  Sometimes  he'd  skip.  But  we  figured  it  out.  We  got  every  town  in  five
hundred miles to  check  up.  Bread-truck  drivers  asked  grocery  stores.  Any bread  missing?  Milk-men
asked  their customers.  Has  anybody  been  pinching your milk? We  found where  he was,  in  Bluevale,
close to the Navajo Dam, you know. We set cops to watch. Almost got him yesterday morning. He was
after a loaf of bread. A cop fired five shots at him, but he got away. Dropped the loaf of bread, too."
Soames  wanted  to  be  sick.  Fran  was  possibly  fourteen  years  old  and  desperate  because  his  whole
civilization depended on him to save them from the destruction falling out of the sky. He was a fugitive on
a strange world.
Then Soames' mouth went dry  as  he realized.  Fran  had  been  shot  at  in Bluevale, which was  near  the

Navajo Dam. The Navajo Dam generated almost as much electric power as Niagara.
"I had a hunch," said the security officer with some grimness, "the kid got past three electric fences, and
we don't know how. He must know plenty about electricity. So I began to wonder if he might be hoping
to answer that broadcast signal with a signal of his own. He was in Bluevale. We checked up. A roofer
lost some sheet copper a couple of days ago. Somebody broke in a storehouse and got away with forty
or fifty feet of heavy-gauge copper wire. A man'd have stolen the whole roll. It would be only a kid that'd
break off as much as he could carry. See?
"He's getting set to make something, and we know he's near Bluevale. He'll need tools. I've got Bluevale
crammed with cops and plainclothesmen. That whole town is one big trap for that kid right now. And the
cops will shoot! Because we don't know what that kid will make. If those kids had something that'll read
your mind, made by grownups, maybe he'll make something that'll burn it out! He looks  human, but he
came out of space from Godknowswhere. Maybe he'll make deathrays!"
Soames  swallowed.  He  knew  what Fran  would want to  make.  A  mere  local  projector  of  deathrays
would be  trivial beside  the consequences  of  what  Fran  was  desperately  resolved  to  do  for  his  own
people.
He heard himself say something relatively soothing.
"Maybe," he observed, "he's not that dangerous. You're worried about how he passed those  electrified
fences. He used stilts. He knew about them. They interested  him. So  he must have made  a  pair  some
seven or eight feet high, and learned to walk on them. And then he simply went to a tree near the fence,
climbed up it and mounted the stilts, and  then walked  to  the fence and  stepped  over  it. At his age  he
wouldn't realize the danger. He'd do it and worm his way past watchers.... He could have done that!"
The security officer swore.
"Yes! Dammit, yes! We should've watched him closer."
"I want to get back East," said Soames.
"When do you want to head East?" asked the officer.
"Now," said Soames. "We've got a project started that's more or less linked to the kids'  gadgets,  even
though we don't understand them. The sooner I can get back, the better."
The security officer used  the telephone.  He  found there  was  a  plane due  to  take  off shortly.  Soames
could get passage on that plane, not to the East,  but to  a  military airfield outside  Denver  where  a  cab
could be had to take him to the commercial airport to make connections East.
Before starting on this trip he'd suspected that he might need to  take  part  in the search  for Fran.  He'd
cleaned  out his bank  account  and  had  the cash  in  his  pocket.  In  half  an  hour  he  was  on  board  the
outbound plane.

In  two  hours  Soames  was  in  Denver.  In  three  he  was  lost  beyond  all  discovery.  He'd  taken  an
inter-urban bus instead of a plane out of Denver, and gotten off at a tiny town  whose  name he did not
even notice. During the night, with closed eyes and in a silent hotel room in the little town, he pressed one
end of the miniature device that Fran had made and Gail had given him.
He felt a queer sensation. He inhabited two bodies at once. It was eerie. The other body did nothing. It
only breathed  and  waited.  Someone  at  the  hidden  base  from  which  he  had  come  wore  one  of  the
children's belts and patiently waited to eavesdrop on any communication that might be  made  by similar
devices.
Soames waited for morning. Very early, again with closed eyes and with his body made comfortable so
that he felt no distinct sensation from it, he pressed the end of the miniature instrument. He saw writing of
the kind the children used for memoranda  about  their English lessons.  He  released  the turn-on  switch,
which was  probably  the head  of a  pin.  He  turned  on  a  light.  He  opened  a  notebook.  Its  first  page
showed two sketches. One was of the runner of a boy-made air-sled. Fran had sketched it for Soames
on the plane headed for New York and the disastrous broadcast. The other was a sketch of a  boy  on
stilts. Soames had drawn that for Fran. Nobody but Soames  would have looked  at  such drawings for
Fran to see through his eyes. They were at once a call and an identification of Soames as a person using
a device like a tiny copper firecracker, with the head of a pin where a fuse would belong.
He turned on the device again while looking at the sketches. He felt that he shared the physical sensations
of two other bodies, no, three. He was momentarily convinced of a third. All three now kept their eyes
tightly closed. All three saw only through his eyes, saw rough sketches which would have meaning only to
two. Soames felt that he heard a smothered noise which only he would have known  was  a  suppressed
giggle.
Then he felt one of the other bodies shaking hands with itself. That would be  Fran,  acknowledging the
message of the drawings that only Soames would know about. He shook hands with himself for Soames
to experience. Then he patted his knee as one would pat a dog, and scratched his knee as one scratches
a dog, as he did with Rex on Antarctica. He had identified himself. There was the stirring of another  of
the bodies  with which Soames  was  linked. That  would  be  the  security  officer,  wearing  a  belt  which
brought him these sensations. He could have no idea, however, who was communicating with whom, and
pattings and scratchings would have no meaning at  all. He  could  only know  that  the weird  experience
stopped when someone shook hands with himself and that was all.
But Soames  rose  and  dressed  with many forebodings.  Fran  would  not  meet  him.  Soames  had  given
warning of traps and close hunting. But Fran would not meet him. It looked bad.
He bought a second-hand motorcycle at ten o'clock in the morning. He knew motorcycles. By three  in
the afternoon he threaded through the traffic of Bluevale. To him, on the watch  for such matters,  there
seemed  an unusual preponderance  of men on the streets  of  that  small  town.  Fran  wouldn't  notice  it.
Soames  did.  But  he  wasn't  noticed.  He'd  bought  a  leather  jacket  and  a  cap.  He  rode  a  battered
motorbike. He didn't even faintly resemble Fran.
He rode casually through Bluevale and  along the wide,  smooth  highway to  the much smaller village of
Navajo Dam—at the edge of the big lake the dam had backed up behind it—and then at a leisurely pace

along the same  highway as  it went over  the crest  of that  massive structure.  The lake  to  his right rose
within feet of the highway. To the left there was a chasm, with a winding truck-road going down to  the
generator buildings at the dam's foot.
Soames jittered. He  went two  miles on and  into forest,  dragging the motorcycle  out of sight from the
road.  He  made  himself  as  comfortable  as  possible,  to  avoid  transmitting  any  information  about  his
whereabouts.  He  stuffed his ears  to  mute the sounds  of open  country.  From  four o'clock  to  eight,  at
irregular intervals, he turned on the sensory-linkage device for a  second  or  two  at  a  time. He  came  to
recognize the physical sensations of the man who, back in the hidden missile base, wore a child's belt and
monitored  for  sensory  communications.  Between  seven  and  eight  the  identity  of  that  man  changed.
Someone else took the place of the first.
At ten o'clock there was the briefest possible sensation of a third body. Soames knew it was Fran.  He
shook hands with himself, quickly. Fran would recognize it as a greeting. Soames had contrived a way to
offer argument, but he only felt a boy's small, smooth hands shaking each other in reply,  and  Fran  was
gone out of communication.
He did not come back.
At midnight Soames got his motorcycle out of the woods and  onto  the highway. He  rode  slowly back
toward Bluevale. He stopped at a hot-dog stand outside the town and waited there for another signal.
At one, nothing had happened. Soames was close enough to the town to have heard any tumult, certainly
any shots.
At two and three—nothing.
At four o'clock, without warning, there was a flash of intolerably vivid blue-green light. It came from the
chasm below the Navajo Dam. The lights across the dam's  curving crest  went out.  The street-lights  of
Bluevale and  the little  village  of  Navajo  Dam  went  out.  The  world  went  dark,  while  a  mountainous
blue-green flame shed intolerably bright light toward the stars.
It went out, too.
Soames, cold with fear, pressed the end of the sensory device. He  felt pain,  lancing, excruciating pain.
He heard Fran's voice gasping hopelessly:
"Try! Try! Try!"
He felt Fran's body turn in pain, and he saw that Fran's eyes looked up at stars, and the stars were cut
off at one side by the curving bulk of the monstrous concrete dam.
Soames shook hands with himself. He let go the button. He started the motorcycle. He raced toward the
dam. He  did not again press  on the sensory  device  until he'd  gone  frantically  through  the  village  and

hair-raisingly down the truck-road to the generator buildings. There he cut off the motor,  and  he heard
men's voices, profane and agitated and alarmed. He saw the small flickerings of flashlights.
He found Fran,  crumpled on the ground and  trying desperately  not to  make  sounds  of pain.  Soames
knew where the hurt was. He'd experienced it as Fran did. He'd guessed its cause and seriousness. He
knew he had to move quickly.
He put Fran swiftly on the saddle behind his own on the motorcycle. He gave the motorcycle all the gas it
would take and went racketing up the truck-road from the chasm below the dam.
He made it. The motorcycle, its lights turned  off, was  across  the dam and  streaking  for the first curve
beyond before the flickerings of car headlights began to show on the road from Bluevale.
Fran held on fiercely. But presently Soames felt the quiverings behind him. He  stopped  the motorcycle
where the road was empty. Fran ground his teeth and stared at him defiantly in the reflected light of the
now functioning single headlight.
"If I were you," said Soames, not expecting to be understood, but speaking as one man to another, "If I
were you I wouldn't be ashamed of crying. I feel pretty much like it myself, from relief that your signalling
device blew out."
CHAPTER 9
THE color of the blue-green flame which had flared so  fiercely outside  the generator-buildings  was  no
mystery at  all. It  was  the color  of vaporized  copper,  the same  coloring found in burning driftwood  in
which copper nails have rusted. Its cause was  no mystery, either.  There'd  been  a  gigantic short-circuit
where the main power-leads left the dynamo-rooms to connect with cross-country power lines.
Soames and Fran knew directly, and some few security officers guessed, that Fran had caused the short.
There was melted-down, cryptic metal below the place where the short appeared. Fran had undoubtedly
placed it. How he escaped electrocution the security officers did not try to figure out. But they knew he'd
tried to do something with apparatus that burned itself out without operating, and that he'd tumbled down
a ten-foot drop while fleeing from the searing green arc, and even that  he'd  appealed  for help with the
words, "Try! Try! Try!" And they knew that somebody had helped him get away from the scene of his
exploit and injury. But they didn't know how, nor that it was Soames.
Soames was assumed to be on his way East to confer  with a  group  of scientists who now had  added
certain  skilled  instrument-makers  to  their  number  and  triumphantly  worked  themselves  to  twitching
exhaustion.
Fran's part in the affair was naturally a secret. Lights and power in five Colorado counties went off and
stayed off. Local newspapers printed indignant editorials.

Theirs was a strictly local view. In high official quarters the feeling was quite different. The reaction there
was more like paralyzed horror. Fran was known to be behind the breakdown of the plant. He'd caused
it by trying to tap  its lines for a  monstrous  amount of power.  He'd  been  trying to  signal to  so  great  a
distance  that tens  of thousands  of kilowatts  were  required.  He'd  failed, but the high brass  knew  with
absolute certainty that he'd tried to signal to his own race. And to the high brass this meant that he'd tried
to summon a space-fleet with invincible weapons to the conquest of Earth.
So there were two directives from the highest possible policy-making levels. First, Fran must be caught at
any cost in effort, time, money, and man-power. Second, the rest of the world must not know that one of
the four spaceship's crew members was at large.
So the hunt for Fran intensified to a merciless degree.
Soames headed north. He wore a leather jacket, and he rode a battered, second-hand motorcycle, and
on the saddle behind him an obvious kid brother rode, leather-jacketed as Soames was,  capped  as  he
was,  scowling as  Soames  did,  and  in all ways  imitating his  elder.  Which  was  so  familiar  a  sight  that
nobody noticed Fran at all. He was visibly a tough younger brother of the kind of young man who goes in
for battered  motorcycles  because  he can't  afford  anything  better.  Naturally  no  one  suspected  him  of
being a telepathic monster, a creature of space, or the object of a desperate search.
It was helpful that Soames was not missed at first and was not searched for. It was a full day  after  the
Navajo Dam breakdown before anybody thought to have him check on the melted-down apparatus.  It
was two days before anybody was concerned about him, and three before flights out of Denver had been
checked futilely for his name.
But on the fourth day  after  a  green  flame reached  up toward  the sky,  Soames  and  a  silent, scowling,
supposed younger brother occupied a fishing-shack on the shores  of Calumet Lake.  They were  seven
hundred miles from Denver, and the way they'd come was much longer than that. They were far removed
from the tumult of the world. They'd made bivouacs in the open on the journey,  and  this would be  the
first time they'd settled anywhere long enough to take stock.
"Now," said Soames, as sunset-colorings filled the sky beyond  the lake's  farther  edge,  "now we  figure
out what we're going to do. We ought to be able to do something, though I don't yet know what.  And
first we act the parts we're playing. We came here to catch some fish. You shouldn't be able to wait. So
we go out and catch fish for our dinner."
He led the way to a tiny wharf where a small boat lay tied. He carried fishing-rods and bait.
He untied the boat and rowed out to the middle of the lake. He surveyed his surroundings and dropped
anchor. He baited a hook, with Fran watching intently.
Soames handed him the rod. Fran waited. He imitated Soames' actions when Soames began to fish. He
watched his line as closely as the deepening dusk permitted.
"Hmmm," said  Soames.  "Your ankle's  doing all right. Lucky it was  a  wrench  instead  of a  break  or  a

sprain.  Four  days  of riding and  no walking have fixed it pretty  well. It's  fairly  certain  nobody  knows
where you are, too. But where do we go from here?"
Fran listened.
"You came out of time," said  Soames  vexedly. "But time-travel can't  be  done.  The natural law of the
conservation of matter  and  energy requires  that  the total  of substance  and  force  in the cosmos,  taken
together, be the same at each instant that it was in the instant before and the one after. It's self-evident.
That rules out travelling in time."
He jerked at his fishing-rod. He did not hook his fish.
"I don't think you understand me," he observed.
"No," said Fran matter of factly.
"It doesn't matter," Soames told him. "I'm saying that you can't put a gallon of water in a full keg of wine.
And you can't, unless you draw off wine as fast as you add water. Unless you exchange.  So  you can't
shift an object from time-frame A to time-frame B without shifting a corresponding amount of matter and
energy from time-frame B to time-frame A. Unless you keep the amount of matter and energy unchanged
in  each.  Unless  you  exchange.  So  you  came  to  here  and  now  from  there  and  then—your  home
time-frame, let's say—by a process of swapping. By transposition. By replacement.  Transposition's  the
best word. The effect was time-travel but the process wasn't, like a telephone has the effect of talking at
a distance but the method is distinctly something else."
Fran jerked his fishing-rod. A nine-inch lake-trout flapped in the boat's bottom.
"I'm supposed to be teaching you how to fish!" said Soames.
He watched as Fran rather gingerly extracted the hook and rebaited as he'd seen Soames do.
Soames continued, "Your ship was transposed from your time into mine. Simultaneously, gram molecular
weight for gram molecular weight, something had to be transposed into yours. Since you were to come
into my time twenty thousand  feet  high and  there  was  nothing else  handy to  be  transposed  into  your
time—why—air had to leave here and turn up there. To make up the mass and energy of your ship and
you and the other children."
As if to indicate that he listened, Fran said:
"Zani, Mal and Hod."
"Right!" Soames jerked his rod and brought up a fingerling which he silently unhooked  and  threw  back
overboard. "Considering the thinness of the air where you came out, maybe half a cubic mile of it had to
transpose into your time to let your ship come into this."

He dropped the line overboard again.
"Which means that there was an implosion of anywhere from a quarter to half a cubic mile of vacuum. It
made an earth-shock and  a  concussion  wave,  and  it battered  your ship until it went out of control.  It
would seem to make sense that the tumult and the shouting would appear  here,  where  plain force  was
operating  without  much  guidance,  but  not  in  your  time  where  the  machinery  and  the  controls  were
operating. Your people had  to  handle more  energy there—and  consequently  acted  upon  more  energy
here—than my people could produce with all the engines now on Earth hooked together."
He fished, frowning thoughtfully.
"I suspect," said Soames, after a long interval, "that with machinery and controls at this end as well as the
other, instead of at one end only, that time-transposition would be a fairly tranquil process. It would be
under accurate control. It'd probably need infinitely less power. A ship would vanish from your time and
simultaneously a mass-and-energy equivalent would take its place. And a ship would appear in this time
and simultaneously a mass-and-energy equivalent would vanish to appear in your time. But I think it must
have been because the whole business was done from one end that the business was so spectacular, with
lightning,  earthquake,  and  all  the  rest.  With  equipment  at  both  ends,  there  should  be  no  static,  no
earth-shock, no concussion, nothing but a very peaceful transfer."
Soames' expression became sardonic.
"Which I am prepared to prevent at any cost," he added. "Yet I've  some  responsibility to  you,  Fran.  I
think I'm getting an idea of a kind of bluff that we might pull off, if we could get the other kids safe away.
It would be a bluff, and the biggest in history. But we might just get away with it...."
Fran caught a three-quarter-pound lake-trout. Soames caught one  weighing half a  pound.  They caught
two smaller ones before full darkness fell. Then Soames put up his fishing-rod and  picked  up the oars.
He began to row toward the shore.
"I'll show you how to clean and cook the fish," he observed. "I think you'll like the flavor."
He pulled hard on one oar, and swung the boat around, and caught one of the small piles of the wharf.
Fran climbed up and Soames handed him the fish.
He followed Fran shoreward toward the rickety little week-end cottage  he'd  rented.  There  he showed
Fran how fish with scales are cleaned, and then how they can be cooked over an open fire.
After Fran had gone to bed, it occurred to Soames that he hadn't heard the news of the world for four
days. On the run, as he and Fran had been, they hadn't seen a newspaper or heard a  news  broadcast.
Now Soames turned on the small radio that went with the fishing cottage, to give advance information on
the weather.
News came on immediately. It was all bad.

The United States  had  shown  no  signs  of  having  profited  by  the  telepathic  powers  of  Fran  and  his
companions. No spies were seized. A submarine installation that could lob missiles into New York from
the  edge  of  the  hundred-fathom  line  was  not  depth-bombed.  There  were  other  failures  to  act  on
information obtained through the children. No nation could imagine another allowing spies to operate if it
could detect them.
So a raging guess began to spread among the anti-American peoples of the world. The guess  was  that
the broadcast  was  a  lie. Nobody  doubted  the  landing  of  a  spaceship,  of  course.  The  static  and  the
earth-shock were evidence, and the Russians had  photographs.  But the children were  too  suspiciously
like  human  children.  They  could  be  child  actors,  coached  to  impersonate  aliens  who  could  not  be
produced. And there was an easy answer to the question of why the true aliens weren't revealed. They
could be dead. Earth's atmosphere might be fatal to them. They could have died of some infection against
which they had no defense.
The politicians and the rulers of the world suspected  the United States  of bad  faith and  trickery.  They
were not certain. But there were ways of making sure.
When Soames tuned in to the news at Calumet Lake, the United States had been forced to use a veto in
the United Nations for the first time. A resolution passed, calling on the United States to  turn over  "the
crew  of an extraterrestrial  space  vessel"  to  a  committee  to  be  appointed  by  the  UN  assembly.  The
United States vetoed it. Ironically, with Fran run away and not found again, the United States could not
have complied with the resolution in any case.
But the veto lent plausibility to  suspicions.  There  was  intensified distrust.  The Nato  countries  asked  to
share  in technical information obtained  from outer  space.  There  wasn't  any. They  asked  to  study  the
devices salvaged by the children. This could  have been  done,  but recent  political developments  inside
Nato made it certain that anything one particular nation learned would immediately be known to Russia.
This was to be avoided if possible.
The mess went farther. South America was so deeply suspicious of the colossus of the north that various
Latin nations sought engagements by European countries to defend them against aggression by the United
States. There had been two great concentrations of military power on Earth. Russia headed one group of
nations, and the United States the other. Now it looked  like there  would soon  be  three.  Russia would
head one. A second would be a group detached from the United States. The third would be the United
States standing alone.
It was an absolutely perfect set-up for flaming total war to be begun at any instant.
The news Soames picked up on a cheap radio on a Calumet Lake fishing shack was enough to make any
man heartsick.
When Fran waked in the morning, an unsmiling Soames greeted him.
"We're going to ride again, Fran. I'm going to make a long-distance call."

They rode two hundred miles before noon, and Soames got silver from a filling-station where he bought
gas. At one of the out-of-door phone-booths lately a part of the American scene, he put through a call to
New York. He got the tall physicist who'd come West to the hidden missile base.
"This is Soames," he said very distinctly. "I've got a tip for you. Pretend that you want to make something
like the gadget that stops winds and warms places. You know the thing."
The tall physicist's voice babbled.
"I know!" said Soames bitterly, "I'm supposed  to  be  dead  or  a  traitor  or  something. But listen to  me!
You're a castaway and savages snipe at you. You want to make something like the thing that stops wind,
but you want it to stop arrows instead. It's quite a job. Perhaps the only useful thing you've  got on this
savage world is a way to make magnetic fields with minus self-induction. That's got to stop the arrows.
You can assume the arrowheads are metal. Do you follow me?"
A pause. Then a tinny voice, singularly calm and astonished at the same time:
"Why—yes! A very interesting approach! In fact, we've got some very surprising results lately. One
of them will fit in beautifully! Yes! Beautifully!"
"If you make it designed for large enough areas," said Soames, "you'll know where to  use  it, and  how.
And—" Soames' voice was  sardonic  indeed,  "If you do  get it, this is one  thing that  shouldn't  be  kept
secret! Get it broadcast! Get it everywhere! Give it to the Russians and the Greeks and the Chinese and
the French and everybody else! Understand? The more who know about it the better."
The tinny voice said:
"We just developed a thing to refine metals in situ.... An induction furnace that sets up the heating
field at almost any distance from the  elements  that  handle  the  power.  It  will  fit  in  perfectly!  Of
course! Certainly! This is magnificent, Soames!"
"If you can get it working and in production before hell breaks loose," said Soames, "you may deserve
well of the republic."
"Where are you, Soames? We need you on several matters—"
Soames hung up. His call, of course, could be traced. He'd travelled two hundred miles so that tracing it
would do no good. He returned to where Fran dangled his legs from the back saddle of the motorbike,
and they headed back to Calumet Lake for a few more days of peace and quiet.
CHAPTER 10

SOAMES made his long-distance call on a Monday, when war  seemed  likely to  come  perhaps  within
hours. All day Monday the tension continued.  Traffic jams became  the normal thing outside  the larger
cities, which would be logical targets for long-range missiles. Every means of travel away from the great
population centers was loaded far beyond capacity.
On Tuesday afternoon national guard troops had been called out in ten states to keep traffic moving.
At Calumet Lake, however, there was no notable change. Soames and Fran still went fishing. In the boat
Fran sometimes shut his eyes and pressed the end of one of the tiny sensory-perception communicators
he had made. He turned it on for no longer than a second at a time. If he made contact with one of the
other children he was prepared to speak swiftly—so they could hear his voice as he did—to assure them
that he was safe and to ask for news of Zani and Mal and Hod, and Gail. He could  do  it very quickly
indeed. Soames had insisted on only instants of communicator-use.
"Maybe those gadgets can be directionally spotted," he said. "Security wants you, Fran. If there's a way
to get a directional fix on you, they'll find it! So, make it short!"
On Thursday morning all broadcasts broke off to report that the DEW line of radars across Canada had
reported objects in the air moving across the North Pole toward the United States. America clenched its
fists and waited for missiles to strike or be blasted by counter-missiles, as fate or chance might determine.
Twenty minutes later a correction came. The radar-detected objects had not been  missiles, but aircraft
flying in formation. They'd  changed  course  and  returned  to  their  bases.  They  were  probably  foreign
fighter-planes patrolling far beyond their usual range.
Soames had held his breath with the rest of the country.  He  was  just beginning to  breathe  freely again
when Fran came running from the week-end-shack. His eyes shone.
"I  got—"  he  swallowed—"Zani.  I  said"—he  swallowed  again,  "we  will  come."  He  added:  "Our
language."
Soames looked at him sharply.
"Maybe you do read minds. Was anybody listening in? Anybody else beside Zani?"
"Two men," said Fran. "Two. They talked. Fast. English."
"One man would be a monitor," said Soames grimly. "Two means a directional fix. Let's go!"
By that night they were hundreds of miles from Calumet Lake.
The highways were crowded with the people who'd evacuated the cities. The high population of remote
places was a protection for Soames and Fran. He worried, though, about Gail, her situation, and that of
the three other children, was far from enviable. In the present increasing confusion and tension they were
hardly likely to have any improvement in their state.
"I think," Soames told Fran reflectively, "that at night, and with the kind of disorganization that seems to

be increasing, you can get away with talking to the kids again. Nobody'll try a  parachute  drop  in these
mountains  in  the  darkness."  They  were  then  a  hundred  miles  south  of  Denver.  "They  couldn't  get
organized  before  daybreak,  and  I  doubt  that  they  could  block  the  highways.  See  if  you  can  make
contact, eh? And find out how they're getting along?"
Fran  nodded.  He  moved  so  that the heat  of  their  fire  would  not  fall  on  him,  to  tell  that  he  camped
out-of-doors. He found a place to lie down in comfort, so that there would be no distracting sensation.
He closed his eyes. Soames saw him press the end of his tiny communicator and release it quickly. After
an instant's pause he pressed it again. He held the communicator on for several seconds,  half a  minute.
He released it and sat up.
"You try," he said in a puzzled fashion. "You try!"
Soames closed his eyes. He  pressed  the little pin-head  button  at  the end  of the instrument which was
hardly larger than a match-stick. He felt the sensations of another body. That other body opened its eyes.
Soames saw who it was, Gail's face was reflected in a mirror. She was pale. Her expression was drawn
and harried. But she smiled at her reflection, because she knew Soames would see what she saw.
He spoke, so she'd hear his voice as he did.
"Gail!"
He felt a hand—which was her hand—spill something on a levelled surface before her. It smoothed the
spilled stuff. It was face-powder, spread on a dressing-table top. A finger wrote.  She  looked  down  at
what was written there.
"Help Fran," he read. "You Must!"
He felt her hand swiftly smoothing the message away. Rage swept over him. Instantly he knew what had
happened. Fran's escape  from Calumet Lake  had  proved  that  he knew  that  his communications were
intercepted and directionally analyzed. Therefore the other children were no longer a means by which he
might be trapped. So their communicators had been taken away from them for the second time, and now
they were watched with an unceasing closeness. Every glance, every word, every gesture was noted.
"This has to be quick," said Soames coldly, for her to hear. "I would help him, but he'd  want to  get in
touch with his people."
Gail opened her eyes again. Her image in the mirror nodded.
"And if he did," said Soames as coldly as before, "they'd come here and conquer us. And I'd rather that
we killed each other off than that the most kindly-disposed of conquerors enslaved us."
He felt her hand again smoothing the spilled face-powder. She wrote in it. He knew what she had written
before she dropped her eyes to it. He couldn't believe it. She'd written three words, no, two words and a

numeral. Soames felt an almost physical shock. He was incredulous. If this was true ...
Then he felt a hand closed firmly on Gail's shoulder. Captain Moggs spoke, authoritative and  stern  and
reproachful:
"Gail! How could you! You have one of those horrible telepathic things too! This  is  a  very  grave
matter, Gail!"
Then the contact was broken. Captain Moggs had snatched away Gail's communicator.
Raging, Soames took Fran and left that spot which was undoubtedly pin-pointed by now. As they sped
away  he  tried  to  consider  the  meaning  of  the  two  words  and  the  numeral  which  was  completely
unbelievable at first thought.
Shortly after sunrise he bought a  two-day-old  newspaper.  It  was  the latest  he could  find for sale.  He
rode a certain distance and stopped where the highway made an especially dramatic turn and there was a
turn-out for tourists to park in while they admired the view. He stopped there and deliberately read the
news affecting war and peace and the children and therefore Gail. At the end he folded  the newspaper
painstakingly and with careful self-control tore it to bits. Then he said angrily:
"Fran, a question it never occurred to me to ask you before."
He posed  the question.  Fran  could  have answered  it with two  English words  and  a  numeral, and  the
same words and numeral that Gail had used. But he didn't have the words. Especially, he did not have
the number. Fran's way of writing numbers was  as  complex as  the system used  in ancient Rome,  and
Soames had no key. It took a long time to  grasp  the quantity Fran  had  in mind. Then Soames  had  to
make sure he had it right.
Then, abruptly,  he knew  that it was  true.  He  knew  why  it  was  true.  It  increased  his  anger  over  the
situation and the treatment of Gail and the children.
"According to this paper," he said icily, "my fellow-countrymen have decided to pay a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind, and to sell you down the river. They suggest an international UN committee to
receive custody of you children. That committee could then set  to  work  on you to  find out where  you
came from, why, and when you are likely to be searched for. Now, you know and so do I that part of
what they found out they wouldn't  accept.  Time-travel is impossible. So  when you children told  them
where you come from they wouldn't believe it. They'd try to pry back behind what they'd consider a lie.
They'd use different techniques of inquiry. They'd use inhibition-releasing drugs. They'd ..."
Fran's expression did not change. Yet it was not passive.
"Which will not happen," said Soames in sudden fury, "except over my dead body! Gail feels the same
way. So let's go! We've got to plan a really king-size monkey-wrench to throw into these works!"

He stepped on the motorbike pedal. He swung on down the winding mountain road for the lowlands. He
went into a relatively small town. He bought a pup-tent, pliers, a small camp-stove; a camp-lantern; food;
blankets; matches.
They went back into the foothills and settled down to the strangest scientific conference  in history. The
scene  of  the  conference  was  a  remote  and  strictly  improvised  encampment  by  the  side  of  a
briskly-flowing trout-stream. They fished. They talked. They drew diagrams at each other.
Fran's  English had  improved  remarkably,  but this was  a  highly  technical  discussion.  It  was  two  days
before Soames had the information he needed firmly in his mind. He  made  a  working drawing of what
had to  be  built. He  realized that the drawing itself was  a  simplification of  a  much  more  sophisticated
original device. It was adapted to be made out of locally available materials. It was what Fran had made
and tried at Navajo Dam.
"Which," said Soames, frowning, "proved not to work. You didn't realize the local resources. This thing
works, obviously, because a terrifically strong electric field is cut off abruptly and collapses instantly. The
original apparatus—the one I burnt—no doubt had a very fine gimmick to  break  a  heavy current  flow
without making an arc. The trouble at Navajo Dam was that it did arc—and how! That was a mess!"
He paused, considering. Since Soames was not looking at him, Fran regarded him with infinite respect.
"The problem,"  said  Soames,  thinking  hard,  "is  a  glorified  job  of  turning  off  an  electric  light  without
making a spark at the switch. That's all. It doesn't matter how long the current flows. The thing is that it
must stop instantly. So we turn the whole business inside out.
"Instead of making a terrific steady current and cutting it off, I'm going to start with it not flowing and use
a strobe-light pack. Every amateur photographer has one. They give a current of eight hundred amperes
and twenty-five hundred volts for the forty-thousandth of a second. The juice doesn't flow long enough to
burn anything out. It cuts itself off. There's nothing to maintain an arc.
"The really tricky part," he said uncomfortably, "may be  the stealing of a  helicopter.  But I guess  I can
manage it."
He left Fran  fishing and  went  down  to  the  nearest  town  again  to  buy  eccentric  items  of  equipment.
Copper  foil. Strobe-light  packs,  two  of them. He  could  use  foil instead  of  large-area  heat-dissipating
units,  because  the  current  would  flow  so  briefly.  He  would  get  a  terrific  current,  of  course.  Two
strobe-light packs in series would give him four million watts of power for part of the wink of an eyelid.
When he got back to the camp, Soames called to Fran. "We've got to get to work. I don't think we've
got much time. I had hopes of a castaway-gadget coming up, but it hasn't."
He began  to  assemble  the device  which would substitute  for the  larger,  heavier,  much  more  massive
apparatus he'd destroyed on the Antarctic ice-sheet. The work went swiftly. Soames had re-designed the
outfit, and a man can always build a  thing of his own design more  easily than something from another
man's drawings.

Before sunset the thing was done. Fran was very respectful. This apparatus was less than a quarter  the
size of the one his own people had prepared for the same purpose. And it was self-powered, too; it was
independent of outside power-supply.
"I'd like to talk to your people about this," said Soames grimly. "I do think things can  be  transposed  in
space, and this should work that way as well as in time. But starting at one end has me stymied."
He abandoned the pup-tent and equipment.
"Either we won't need them," he said, "or we won't be able to use them."
The battered, ancient motorcycle took them into the night. Soames had studied  road-maps  and  he and
Fran had discussed in detail the route to Navajo Dam—using stilts to cross electrified fences—from the
hidden missile base. Soames was sure that with Fran's help he could find the pseudo-village where Gail
and the children remained. It would call for a  helicopter.  But before  that  there  was  a  highly necessary
operation which would also go best with a helicopter to help. So when they left that pup-tent camp they
headed  toward  a  very minor, local airfield where  Soames  had  once  landed.  It  had  hangars  for half  a
dozen cheap private planes and for two helicopters used mostly for crop-dusting.
At the airfield Soames laid the motorcycle beside the edge of the clear area, and left Fran with it, to wait.
He moved quietly through the darkness toward close-up buildings with no lights anywhere except in one
room reserved for a watchman.
Fran  waited,  breathing  fast.  He  heard  night-insects  and  nothing  else.  It  seemed  a  horribly  long
time—before he heard the grinding noise of a motor being cranked. It caught immediately. There was a
terrific roaring tumult inside a building. The large door of a hangar tilted and  went upward,  and  a  door
opened from the watchman's lighted room and he came shouting outside.
The roaring of motors changed. The door of the hangar was quite open. A bellowing thing came moving
out, whirling huge black vanes against the sky. It boomed  more  loudly still, and  lifted, and  then drifted
with seeming clumsiness across the level airfield while the night watchman shouted after it.
Fran turned on the motorcycle  headlight as  he'd  been  told,  and  picked  up the apparatus  Soames  had
made to use strobe-light packs in. The 'copter swept toward him, six feet above-ground. It came down
and Fran swarmed up into its cabin. Then the motors  really thundered  and  the 'copter  climbed for the
sky.
Soames drove without lights and headed southward.
A transcontinental highway appeared below. It was plainly marked by the headlights of more than usually
heavy traffic on it. He followed that highway.
Fran rode in a sort of stilly rapture. Soames said:

"Not worried, Fran?"
Fran shook his head. Then, boy-like, he turned on the transistor radio to show his nonchalance. A voice
spoke. He'd have shifted to music but Soames caught a word or two.
"Hold it!" he commanded. "Put it so I can hear!"
Fran raised the volume and held the small radio so Soames could hear it above the motor-noise.
What he heard, at this moment, was the official United States broadcast announcing the ending of all real
menace of atomic attack. By a fortunate freak of fate, somebody in authority realized that  it was  more
important to get the news out than to make a professionalized production of it. So a tired but confident
voice said very simply that American technicians seemed to have solved the problem  of defense  attack
by  atomic  bombs  and  guided  missiles.  There  had  been,  the  voice  said  steadily,  recent  marked
improvements in electric induction furnaces. The basic principle of an induction furnace was the evolution
of heat in the material it was desired to melt, instead of merely in a container for the stuff that was to be
melted. Within the past four days  induction furnaces  of a  new type  had  proved  able  to  induce heat  in
chosen objects up to miles. It had been expected to smelt metal ore in the veins in which it was  found,
and to make mines yield their product as metal without digging up and puttering with useless  rock.  But
now this apparatus had been combined with radar.
When a radar detected a missile or an enemy plane, the broadcast said carefully, an induction furnace of
the new type was turned upon the plane or missile. The effect was exactly that of enclosing the missile in
a burning blast-furnace. It melted. The most careful tests assured America, then, that any city protected
by radar-controlled remote-induction furnaces was safe against atomic attack and its dread destruction.
And at  the time of this broadcast,  every  major  center  of population  in the United States  was  already
protected by the new defense-system. The cities which had been  most vulnerable were  now the safest
places  in  the  nation.  And  it  was  found,  added  the  contented  voice,  that  atomic  bombs  were  not
detonated by the induction fields. The induced currents seemed to freeze firing mechanisms. It appeared
impossible to design a detonating device which would blow up a bomb before it melted.
The broadcast ended in a matter-of-fact statement that plans for the defense-system had been given to all
the allies of the United States, that London was already protected and Paris would be within hours, and
that within days the nations which were not allies would be assisted to establish defenses, so that atomic
war need not be feared in the future.
Soames listened with an odd expression on his face.
"That," he said, "started out as a gadget for a castaway to stop arrows that savages were sniping at him
with. I'm very pleased."
There was no more for him to say. The pleasure  he felt, of course,  would be  the only reward  he was
likely to get. At the moment he was bent upon an enterprise his fellow-Americans would have regarded
with horror.

Far,  far  below  and  surrounded  by  the  blackness  of  tree-covered  ground  in  starlight,  there  was  an
irregular shape of brightness. It was miles long. It reflected the stars.  It  was  the flood-control  reservoir
behind the Polder Dam. There was no power-plant here. This reservoir merely took the place  of some
hundreds of thousands of acres of timbered-off forest which once had controlled floods more effectively.
Without a word, Soames slanted the 'copter down. Presently it hovered delicately over the dam's  crest
and at  its very center.  It  touched.  The rotor  ceased  to  whirl. The motor  stopped.  There  was  a  great
silence.
Fran  scrambled  down.  Soames  swung  after  him.  Together,  they  set  up  the  device  which  was  a
time-transposition unit, with its complicated small antenna aimed out at the waters of the reservoir.
"I've gambled," said Soames, "that we understand each other. Now you pull the string."
There was a cord which would discharge the strobe-packs  through the apparatus  itself. The discharge
would  cease  with  absolute  abruptness.  The  packs  would  then  recharge  themselves  from  the  special
batteries included in the device.
Fran pulled the cord.
There was no noise except a small and inadequate "snap." It  seemed  that  nothing happened.  But there
was suddenly a hole in the surface of the reservoir. It was a large hole.
Something came up out of it. It glittered in ghostly fashion in the starlight. It rose up and up and up. It was
a cylinder with a rounded top and a diameter of fifty feet or so. It rose and rose, very deliberately. Then a
rounded lower end appeared. It floated in the air.
Fran jerked the cord again. Another hole in the lake. Another round metal thing rising slowly, one would
even say peacefully into the starlight. Fran, grinning happily, jerked the cord again and yet again....
There were eight gigantic shining cylinders in the air when he stopped and stood back, his eyes shining. A
vast metal thing floated ponderously near. A port opened and  a  voice called down  in the language the
children used among themselves. Fran spoke back, remembering to turn on his sensory communicator.
Fran talked briskly as  if to  himself. But it was  standard  sensory-communication  practice.  After a  long
time he turned to Soames.
"My people say—" a pause—"thank you—" another pause, "and ask for Zani and Mal and Hod."
"Tell them to  make  a  column of themselves and  float right here,  going up to  ten thousand  feet  or  so.
Radars will pick them out. Planes will come in the night to see what they are. They'll guess. I doubt very
much that they'll attack. Tell your people simply to keep them worried until we come back."
Fran zestfully swarmed back into the helicopter. Soames told him:
"Turn off your communicator. You'll be listened in on. But maybe the monitoring men are having their hair

stand on end from the welter of communications from the ships!"
Fran wriggled with excitement as the 'copter rose once more.
Soames had an odd feeling that all this could not be true. But it was, down to the last least detail which
had made it thinkable for him to defy all his fellow-men to keep faith with four children whose lives and
errand he'd interfered with. The matter had been a very natural oversight, at first.
Of course Soames had assumed that the children's civilization had been one of very millions of people. A
small city cannot establish or maintain a great technological civilization. He had been right. He'd assumed,
even, that Fran's  people  were  able  to  travel between  planets.  Again he'd  been  right. But the thing he
hadn't thought of was that the development  of transposition  in time—and transposition  in space  would
come later—wouldn't  occur  to  anybody  unless there  was  absolutely no other  possible  solution  to  the
problem the Old  Race  faced.  They wouldn't  have tried  to  solve it until the Fifth Planet  burst  and  the
doom of the world they lived on was self-evident. They wouldn't have worked at it until they realized that
Venus and Mercury were due to be shattered after Earth, just as Mars was bombarded before it.
So the struggle to escape through time was begun in the fifty-ninth minute of the last hour. Cities struggled
to build time-ships and get a pioneer vessel through to future time. Asteroids plunged down upon them,
wiping  them  out.  Cities  struggled  on,  passing  to  each  other—to  the  thinning  number  of  those  who
remained—such solutions to such problems as they developed. But there were fewer and fewer....  The
city  from  which  the  children  came  had  fallen  in  ruins  from  earth-shocks,  and  only  a  fraction  of  its
population continued frantically to labor on....
But Soames hadn't thought of this. It was Gail who found it out from the children with her. And she'd told
Soames that he must help Fran at any cost, and told the reason in two words and a number. Speaking of
Fran's people, she'd told Soames,
"Only 2,000 left."
It was true.  It  checked  with the number of ships that  came  through to  modernity. Only two  thousand
people remained of Fran's race. They could not conquer two billions of humankind. They could not rule
them. They could only take refuge among them, and share what knowledge they could with them.
Fran leaned happily against Soames' shoulder. The 'copter swung away from a broad wide valley.
Fran pointed. Two valleys came together here. He, who had come away from the missile base on foot,
was an authority on how to get back to it in a helicopter.
The 'copter flew on.
Fran said:

"There!"
And there were small lights, the color  of kerosene  lamps. But they were  not lamps, but electric  lights.
Soames sent the 'copter sweeping toward the remarkably convincing Rocky Mountain village. The ship
barely cleared an electrified fence, the last of three. But if there were sentries who might have fired on it,
they had  already  heard  of the arrival of a  fleet of alien spaceships.  Nothing so  human as  a  helicopter
could be an enemy when an invading fleet from who-knows-where was just reported....
The 'copter settled to ground with a whistling noise. Soames cut off the motors.  Then Fran  was  calling
joyously, and Zani squealed from a window, and Hod came tumbling out of a window and Mal popped
out of nowhere and came running. There were shouts in the village. Then Gail was coming, also.
"Pile aboard!" commanded Soames. "Your families are here, kids, and they're waiting for you. And, Gail,
there's going to be the most thoroughly scared gang at the UN  and  elsewhere  that  you ever  saw,  now
that what they think's a space-fleet is actually here! We've been decent to the kids, and they think they
haven't, so we'll hold out for authority to argue...."
A door slammed. Fran said happily:
"Let's go!"
Motors  boomed.  The  helicopter  lifted.  It  rushed  over  the  village,  bellowing.  Tree-branches  thrashed
violently in the down draught. It swept splendidly away down a valley leading to another valley and under
a precipitous  cliff and  down  more  valleys.  There  was  a  place  where  eight  silvery  spacecraft  floated
composedly above the Earth, with the few survivors of a great civilization peering out, waiting for dawn
so they could see a new world, a fresh world healed of all scars, waiting....
Soames pulled Gail to him. "I've got to make friends with these people,  Gail!" His voice trembled  with
excitement. "You see? They've got a wonderful science, but we've got to get to work on it! They need a
modern viewpoint! That time-transposing system they've used to save their lives, it's bound to work as a
space-transposer  too!  I've  got  to  work  it  out  with  their  engineers!  We've  got  to  get  enough  power
together  to  send  some  sort  of  miniature  transposer  out  to  Centaurus  and  Aldebaran,  and  then  have
regular interstellar transposition routes and a spate  of worlds  for everybody  to  move to  who feels like
it.... Taking what these people have, and adding our stuff to it ... we'll really go places!"
They swept  over  the reflecting waters  which were  the reservoir  behind the  Polder  Dam.  Fran  spoke
aloud,  for  someone  somewhere  else  to  hear.  He  spoke  again.  He  was  using  his  own,  home-made
sensory communicator. Then he suddenly touched Soames' arm.
"My people say—" pause "you talk for them." He grinned. "Let's go!"
And the 'copter touched solidity and  a  great  silvery cylinder touched  very delicately close  by,  and  the
children ran, squealing, to be with people they'd  feared  they would never  see  again. And Soames  and
Gail walked a little bit diffidently toward the same opened, lowered door. There were some rather nice
people waiting for them. They'd raised fine children. They needed Soames and Gail to help them make

friends.
Somehow it did not occur to Soames that he was the occasion, if not the cause, that on this one day and
within hours, the danger of atomic war on Earth was ended, and the human race was headed for the stars
instead of annihilation. But it was  true.  The people  of the Old  Race,  of course,  would not try to  rule
Earth. They were too few. They wouldn't want to go to another planet and be alone. Again they were too
few. They were the last survivors of a very magnificent civilization, but they could not maintain it unless
they shared it with the people of Earth of now. They could only join the sprawling younger branch of the
human race as citizens.
But humans, now, had a new destiny. With Gail close beside him, Soames waited for the greetings of the
children and their parents to end. He looked at Gail. Her eyes were shining.
Soames felt very good. It was a perfect solution to the troubles of Earth, both past and future.
The stars were waiting.

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
     http://www.gutenberg.net
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
