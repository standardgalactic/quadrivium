About the Author
Dan Gookin has been writing about technology for 20 years. He has con-
tributed articles to numerous high-tech magazines and written more than 
100 books about personal computing technology, many of them accurate.
He combines his love of writing with his interest in technology to create
books that are informative and entertaining, but not boring. Having sold more
than 14 million titles translated into more than 30 languages, Dan can attest
that his method of crafting computer tomes does seem to work.
Perhaps Dan’s most famous title is the original DOS For Dummies, published
in 1991. It became the world’s fastest-selling computer book, at one time
moving more copies per week than the New York Times number-one best
seller (although, because it’s a reference book, it could not be listed on the
NYT best seller list). That book spawned the entire line of For Dummies
books, which remains a publishing phenomenon to this day.
Dan’s most recent titles include Laptops For Dummies; Buying a Computer For
Dummies, 2006 Edition; Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies, 2nd Edition;
Power Excel & Word; and eBay Photos That Sell. He also maintains the vast
and helpful Web site www.wambooli.com.
Dan holds a degree in communications and visual arts from the University of
California, San Diego. He lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoys
spending time with his four boys in the gentle woods and on the temperate
blue lakes of Idaho.

Introduction
T
hings change quickly in the computer industry, so it’s time for another
revision and update to this classic book, now in its 10th edition. I’ve done
some major work here, shuffled things around, and tidied up all the text so
that PCs For Dummies can give you the answer to the ever-burning question
“How does a computer turn a smart person like you into a dummy?”
You don’t have to love a computer. Some folks do, most don’t. The reason is
simple: Computers are not easy to use. True, a computer is easier to use now
than it was 10 years ago, but some things remain cryptic. The help files are
mystifying. Technical support isn’t even in English any more! So, you’re left
feeling numb and cold and wondering why no one bothers to sit down and
explain things to you in plain human terms. Well, wonder no more!
This book explains the basics of your computer, the PC — how it works, what
does what, and all that stuff you want to know or maybe didn’t realize you
wanted to know. Honestly, computers really aren’t that difficult to use or
understand. It’s just that it has taken an author like me and a book like this
one a while to get the word out.
Between this book’s yellow and black covers you’ll find friendly, helpful infor-
mation about using your PC. This book uses friendly and human — and often
irreverent — terms. Nothing is sacred here. Electronics can be praised by
others. This book focuses on you and your needs. In this book, you’ll discover
everything you need to know about your computer without painful jargon or
the prerequisite master’s degree in engineering. And, you’ll have fun.
What’s New in This Edition?
I’ve done my homework! I’ve sat with beginners and observed how they use
their computers. I’ve made notes about what was obvious to them — stuff I
no longer need to write about. I also noted stuff that ’most everyone who
uses a computer doesn’t know. Even so-called experts have difficulty with
some basic computer concepts. So, armed with my new knowledge and
understanding of computer users, I sat down at the word processor, cracked
my knuckles, winced in pain, waited a few minutes for the pain to subside,

and then set about recrafting this book with a newfound emphasis and enthu-
siasm for the first-time computer user — as well as the old hand who may
still find some things befuddling.
This edition of PCs For Dummies is specific to any personal computer running
the Windows XP operating system, either the Home or Pro edition. If you
have an older version of Windows, you have, honestly, an outdated PC, and I
strongly urge you to get a new PC with Windows XP and enjoy the benefits of
using your new, more powerful computer.
Here are a few of the new topics covered in this edition:
 Brand-new and highly detailed information on home computer network-
ing, including Internet connections and the ever-popular wireless net-
working options.
 Basic information on understanding what a computer is and how it works.
 Key information on the essence of a file. Truly, by understanding the file,
you really get hold of the entire computer software concept.
 Updated information on broadband (high-speed) modems.
 Detailed data on the USB port.
 More information on PC setup and configuration.
 General up-to-date and current information on all aspects of PC technol-
ogy, hardware, and software — stuff too numerous to mention here, so
why not just start reading the book already?
As in years past, I present all the information in this book in a sane, soothing,
and gentle tone that calms even the most panicked computerphobe.
Where to Start
This book is designed so that you can pick it up at any point and start 
reading — like a reference. It has 31 chapters. Each chapter covers a specific
aspect of the computer — turning it on, using a printer, using software, or
kicking the computer, for example. Each chapter is divided into self-contained
nuggets of information — sections — all relating to the major theme of the
chapter. Sample sections you may find include
 Turning the darn thing off
 Where’s the power cord?
 Stop, printer! Stop!
2
PCs For Dummies, 10th Edition 

 Testing the network
 Disposing of a CD or CD-R
 Downloading a file from the Internet
You don’t have to memorize anything in this book. Nothing about a computer
is memorable. Each section is designed so that you can read the information
quickly, digest what you have read, and then put down the book and get on
with using the computer. If anything technical crops up, you’re alerted to its
presence so that you can cleanly avoid it.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book is a reference. Start with the topic you want more information
about; look for it in the table of contents or in the index. Turn to the area of
interest and read the information you need. Then, with the information in
your head, you can quickly close the book and freely perform whatever task
you need — without reading anything else.
Whenever I describe a message or information on the screen, it looks like this:
This is a message onscreen.
If you have to type something, it looks like this:
Type me
You type the text Type me as shown. You’re told when and whether to press
the Enter key.
Windows menu commands are shown like this:
Choose File➪Exit.
This line means to choose the File menu and then choose the Exit command.
The underlined letters are shortcut keys, which can be pressed instead of
using the mouse to choose a menu item: Press the Alt key to activate the
menu, and then press the underlined keys — F and then E, in this example.
Key combinations you may have to type are shown like this:
Ctrl+S
3
Introduction

This line means to press and hold the Ctrl (control) key, type an S, and then
release the Ctrl key. It works just like the way pressing Shift+S on the key-
board produces an uppercase S. Same deal, different shift key.
What You Don’t Need to Read
Lots of technical information is involved in using a computer. To better insu-
late you from this information, I have enclosed this type of material in side-
bars clearly marked as technical information. You don’t have to read that
stuff. Often, it’s just a complex explanation of information already discussed
in the chapter. Reading that information only teaches you something substan-
tial about your computer, which is not the goal here.
Foolish Assumptions
I make some admittedly foolish assumptions about you: You have a computer,
and you use it somehow to do something. You use a PC (or are planning on it)
and will use Windows XP, either the Home or Pro version, as your PC’s operat-
ing system, or main program. This book doesn’t cover any previous versions
of Windows.
This book refers to the menu that appears when you click or activate the Start
button as the Start button’s menu. The All Programs menu on the Start panel is
referred to as All Programs, though it may say Programs on your screen.
I prefer to use the Windows Control Panel in Classic view, but I prefer to use
the Start button’s menu in the newer, Windows XP view. (This topic is cov-
ered in Chapter 5.)
Icons Used in This Book
This icon alerts you to needless technical information — drivel I added
because I just felt like explaining something totally unnecessary (a hard habit
to break). Feel free to skip over anything tagged with this little picture.
This icon usually indicates helpful advice or an insight that makes using the
computer interesting. For example, when you’re pouring acid over your com-
puter, be sure to wear a protective apron and gloves and goggles.
4
PCs For Dummies, 10th Edition 

This icon indicates something to remember, like you kept the refrigerator
door open when you left the house this morning or check your zipper before
you step before a large audience.
This icon indicates that you need to be careful with the information that’s pre-
sented; usually, it’s a reminder for you not to do something.
Getting in Touch with the Author
My e-mail address is listed here in case you want to write me on the Internet:

Yes, that is my address, and I respond to every e-mail message. I cannot, how-
ever, troubleshoot or fix your PC. Remember that you paid others for your
technical support, and you should use them. I am open to answering ques-
tions directly related to this book.

Part I
Introducing the PC

In this part . . .
Just about anyone can recognize a computer. Comput-
ers are common enough now that even someone
stomping through a junkyard and searching for the left
front end of a 1988 Subaru would be able to recognize one.
But, do you know what a PC really is?
There’s more to a computer than just a consumer gadget
that you can quickly assemble and “be up and running in
no time.” Despite advances in technology and strides
toward making things “user-friendly,” the computer
remains a highly technical device. If you’re going to get
the most from your computer, you’ll have to be formally
introduced. That’s what you’ll find in this part of the book.

Chapter 1
Computer? PC? What’s That?
In This Chapter
 Understanding computer basics
 Learning about I/O
 Discovering hardware and software
 Getting to the know the operating system
 Knowing that your PC will not explode
G
uess what? The salespeople lied! They told you that a computer was easy
to use. They said that you would be on the Internet in no time. They
explained how computer programs are so simple and helpful now that you don’t
need to take classes or — heaven forbid — buy a book! Yep, them’s all lies!
In the great rush to make computers a consumer commodity — right up
there with toaster ovens and cell phones — the people who sell computers
had to spin these great yarns. Sadly, most people believe the tall tales. And
it’s possible to squeak by and use a computer with minimal knowledge of
what’s going on. But you know better.
If you’re naturally smart, if you have an IQ that would make Einstein blush, or
if you’re an alien visitor to Earth and you find all this computer stuff as easy
as understanding the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit, phooey on you! Otherwise,
my guess is that you’ve discovered that computers are indeed complex and
intimidating and can make you feel like a dummy.
This chapter introduces you to the concept of the computer — basic informa-
tion that should be necessary to completely understand the beast you may
consider buying, have just purchased, or perhaps owned for years. After
reading this chapter, you stand a better chance of knowing what it’s all about.
Computers at Their Most Dumb
Most gizmos are rather simple: A toaster heats bread; a microwave oven
heats water or the water inside of things; a car provides transportation; a

telephone allows you to talk with someone else, from across the globe to sit-
ting across the table. The purpose of any device can be boiled down to the
simplest description. But what about a computer?
It has been said that computers defy description. At one time, the computer
was considered the ultimate solution for which there was no problem. But
that’s not quite correct. The computer is a simple beast. It does basically one
thing: It takes input and then modifies that input to create some form of
output (see Figure 1-1). The enormous potential of that simple activity, how-
ever, is what makes the computer seem like such a complex device.
To help you grasp the notion of what a computer does, you should under-
stand three basic computer concepts:
 I/O
 Processing
 Storage
This section expands on these ideas, giving you a distillation of what you could
have learned in a computer science class, if you had bothered to take one.
I/O
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
—Hamlet, Act I, Scene III
No one would accuse a computer of being a reliable moocher, but it’s
obsessed over the two letters I and O. It’s IO as in “I owe,” not as in Io, the
third-largest moon of Jupiter.
IO is commonly written as I/O, and it stands for Input and Output, which are
the two things a computer does best. In fact, I/O is pretty much the only thing
a computer does. You get this whole I/O concept down, and you’ve tackled
the essence of what a computer is and what it can do.
INPUT
OUTPUT
Figure 1-1:
What a
computer
does at its
simplest
level.
10
Part I: Introducing the PC 

 The devices connected to your computer are divided into input and
output camps. There are input devices and output devices.
 Input devices are things used to send information to the computer. The
keyboard and mouse are two input devices, as are a scanner and a digi-
tal camera.
 Output devices are things the computer uses to show its output, such as
the screen and printer.
 Some devices can do both input and output, such as a hard drive and a
modem. The computer can use those devices to supply input as well as
send output to those devices.
 Don’t let terms like hard disk and modem bother you! If you’re curious,
you can look them up in the index. Otherwise, keep reading and nod
occasionally like you really get it. If anything, that will impress someone
else who’s watching.
Processing
If a computer did no processing, it would essentially be like plumbing: Water
would come into the system, churn around in a few pipes, and then go out of
the system. The water would be the same before, during, and after the jour-
ney. But with a computer, you have the added element of processing, which
means doing something to the input so that you get something else as output.
 Processing is handled by a gizmo inside the computer called (logically
enough) a processor.
 The processor doesn’t really know what to do with all that input. Telling
the computer what to do is the job of software. The topic of software is
covered later in this chapter.
 It’s amazing when you think of it: Computer input is all digital. Yet with the
proper processing, the output can be anything from a poem to a graphical
image to a symphony. That’s all thanks to the power of processing.
Storage
The final part of the computer equation is storage, which in a computer is
referred to as memory. The storage is necessary on the most basic level
because the processor needs a place to perform its magic — a scratch pad
for mad doodles, if you will.
On a modern computer, storage comes in two forms: temporary and long-term.
11
Chapter 1: Computer? PC? What’s That?

RAM is the temporary storage, where the processor does its work, where pro-
grams run, and where information is stored while it’s being worked on. RAM
is the microprocessor’s playground, its wood shop, its den.
Disk drives provide long-term storage. The disks also allow information to be
saved and recalled for later use — like a closet or storage unit. Disk storage is
the place where things go when the microprocessor isn’t directly working on
them — but from where stuff can be retrieved later, if need be.
 All computers need storage.
 RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory. It’s often just called
memory.
 RAM is also known as temporary storage.
 Disk drives come in a wide variety of types: removable and nonremov-
able, and with various names and numbers attached. Because of their
variety, disk drives are generally referred to as long-term storage.
 Another term for disk drives is disk memory, though I don’t prefer that
term because it’s easy to confuse it with RAM.
 Don’t get all hung up on these terms. Computer jargon, such as RAM and
disk drive, is explained later in this book.
 The computers on the Apollo moon missions had lots of storage for
their day. This was so that the astronauts wouldn’t have to manually
type in the programs the computer needed to run. Even so, there was a
lot more typing and programming going on in the capsule than you
would imagine.
The World of Hardware and Software
A computer system is a blend of two different things: hardware and software.
Like other famous pairs — Astaire and Rogers, sweet and sour, pickup and
redneck — hardware and software must go well together to create the full
computer system.
Hardware is the physical part of a computer — anything you can touch and
anything you can see. The computer console, the monitor, the keyboard, the
mouse — that physical stuff is hardware.
Software is the brains of the computer. It tells the hardware what to do.
In a way, it helps to think of hardware and software like a symphony orches-
tra. For hardware, you have the musicians and their instruments. The 
12
Part I: Introducing the PC 

software is the music. As with a computer, the music (software) tells the
musicians and their instruments (hardware) what to do.
Without software, hardware just sits around and looks pretty. It can’t do any-
thing because it has no instructions, and nothing telling it what to do next.
And, like a symphony orchestra without music, that can be an expensive
waste of time (especially at union scale).
No, you must have software to make the computer go and complete the com-
puter system. In fact, it’s software that determines your computer’s personality.
 If you can throw it out a window, it’s hardware.
 If you can throw it out a window and it comes back, it’s a cat.
 Computer software is nothing more than instructions that tell the hard-
ware what to do, how to act, or when to lose your data.
 Computer software is more important than computer hardware. Like the
master and the slave, it’s the software that tells the hardware what to
do. This is especially important to note when first buying a computer
because most people dwell on the new computer’s hardware rather than
on the software controlling that hardware.
 Without the proper software, your computer’s hardware has nothing to
do. That’s when the computer magically transforms into a boat anchor.
The computer’s operating system
The most important piece of software inside a computer is the operating
system. It has several duties:
 Control the computer’s hardware.
 Manage all the computer software.
 Organize the files and stuff you create on the computer.
 Interface with you, the human.
Doing all these things is a major task. Be thankful that computer designers
have seen to it that only one program does all these things! The operating
system is no slacker.
On PCs, the most common operating system is Windows. Other operating
systems are available, all of which do the things just listed and can handily
control the PC’s hardware, but Windows dominates the marketplace. This
book assumes that Windows is your PC’s operating system.
13
Chapter 1: Computer? PC? What’s That?

How the operating system does its various jobs is covered elsewhere in 
this book.
 The hardware is not in charge! Software must rule the computer’s roost.
And the big bully among all the software programs is the operating
system.
 The computer’s most important piece of software is its operating
system. It’s the computer’s number-one program — the head honcho,
the big cheese, Mr. In Charge, Fearless Leader, le roi.
 The computer hardware surrenders control of itself to the operating
system mere moments after you turn the computer on. See Chapter 4 for
information on turning the computer on and off.
 The operating system typically comes with the computer when you buy
it. You never need to add a second operating system, although operating
systems do get updated and improved from time to time.
 When you buy software, you buy it for an operating system, not for your
brand of PC. So, rather than buy software for your Dell or IBM, you look
in the Windows section of the software store.
Other software
The operating system isn’t the only software you use on your computer. If
you’re a typical computer user, you’ll most likely obtain dozens, if not hun-
dreds, of other programs, or computer software, to help customize your com-
puter and get it to do those things you want it to do.
Computer software is known by several different names. In addition to soft-
ware, you find:
Applications: This category of software is used for productivity or to create
things. Applications are the software that does the work.
Programs: Anything that is a “computer program” is also software, but this
category includes software that may or may not be used for productivity or
to produce output, such as a computer game or CD-playing program.
Utilities or tools: These programs are designed to help you run the computer
or work with the hardware. For example, you may use a tool to optimize the
performance of your computer’s disk drives.
Part IV of this book goes into more detail on computer software.
14
Part I: Introducing the PC 

The stuff you make
You use software to control your computer hardware, and the result is that
you produce something. That something — whether it’s a document, a piece
of music, a video, graphical art, whatever — is stored on the computer in a
unit called a file.
The operating system is what tells the various applications and programs
how and where to save the stuff you create — your files. The operating
system helps keep things organized and offers rules for naming and help 
for finding all those files.
This book covers files and their organization in Chapter 21.
The PC (As in PCs For Dummies)
The kind of computer you have, or will soon have, is a PC, which is why this
book is titled PCs For Dummies. There are many varieties of computers, from
large supercomputers to small handhelds. The largest category by far, how-
ever, is the PC.
PC stands for personal computer. The design of the PC is based on its earliest
ancestor, the IBM PC. Back then, PCs were referred to as microcomputers. And
though many, many microcomputers were available, the IBM PC proved the
most popular and successful.
Specifically, a PC today is any computer that can run the Windows operating
system. There are subtle differences between the PC’s hardware from one
manufacturer to the next, but, universally, if the computer runs Windows, it’s
a PC. (Note that this doesn’t include cars, sewing machines, or heart–lung
machines that also may run Windows.)
 In the big picture, what a PC specifically is not is a Macintosh. If you
have a Macintosh — any shape or variety — you should get the book
Macs For Dummies, a well-written tome by my friend David Pogue.
 If you have a laptop PC, I highly recommend getting the book Laptops For
Dummies, a well-written tome by my friend Dan Gookin.

Chapter 1: Computer? PC? What’s That?

The Most Important Question: 
Will Your PC Explode?
I can happily inform you that, no, your computer will not explode. Not under
normal circumstances anyway. But if you’re culturally literate, it’s entirely
possible that you could believe the PC capable of spontaneous combustion,
despite its never happening in real life.
Anyone who’s ever seen an old episode of TV’s Star Trek or any Irwin Allen
television show from the 1960s knows that computers are capable of explod-
ing, and doing so in a quite dramatic fashion. When given the most subtle yet
illogical directions, the typical TV computer fidgets and heats up, and eventu-
ally explodes in a shower of sparks and chunky debris.
In real life, computers die a much more silent death. The typical dead PC
simply refuses to turn on when the switch is thrown. Oh, sure, sometimes the
power supply may go “poof!” But that is so nondramatic compared to some-
thing like the exploding war computers of Eminiar VII in Star Trek Episode 23.
Now, although your computer will not explode — or even blow up — I do
admit that they can be much more friendly. I would love to say that the com-
puter is really rather easy to understand, but it’s not. Even folks who readily
take to computers discover new and useful things every day. Of course, you
already have taken a giant stride into making the computer more of a friend
than a potential powder keg: You have this book, which starts off with this
friendly chapter, a pleasant introduction to the PC.
 If you don’t already own a PC, I can recommend a great book: Buying a
Computer For Dummies, written by yours truly and available from Wiley
Publishing, Inc. It covers the basics of the PC, how to select one just
right for you, and how to set it up for the first time.
 Computers aren’t evil. They harbor no sinister intelligence. In fact, when
you get to know them, they’re rather dumb.

In This Chapter
 Recognizing different types of PCs
 Looking at the basic PC hardware
 Finding things on the console
 Locating PC connectors, holes, and jacks
 Using helpful symbols and colors
You would think that 25 years after the dawn of the computer revolution,
most folks would know what a computer looks like. They don’t. Most
commonly, people think that the monitor is the computer. It’s not! Silly. So,
how can you tell what’s the computer and what’s just a lowly peripheral?
Why, you read this here chapter, of course!
Of the two parts of a computer system, hardware and software, it’s the hard-
ware that gets the most attention — despite the software being more impor-
tant. This chapter provides you with the bird’s-eye — or, rather, nerd’s-eye —
overview of what is a PC and where you can find interesting and useful things
on that device.
Variations on the Typical PC
There is no such thing as a typical PC, just as there is no such thing as the typi-
cal car. Though PCs and cars all have common parts, the arrangement and
design are different from manufacturer to manufacturer. Here’s a quick overview
of the various types of PCs available and what they’re officially called:
Mini-tower: The most popular PC configuration, where the computer sits
upright on a desktop or tucked away out of sight below the desk.
Desktop: Once the most popular PC configuration, with a slab-like console
lying flat on the desktop with the monitor squatting on top.

Desktop (small footprint): A smaller version of the desktop, typically used in
low-priced home systems. The footprint is the amount of desk space the com-
puter uses.
Tower system: Essentially a full-size desktop standing on its side, which
makes this PC tall, like a tower. Towers have lotsa room inside for expansion,
which makes them the darlings of power-mad users. Towers typically sit on
the floor, often propping up one end of the table.
Notebook/laptop: A specialty type of computer that folds into a handy, light-
weight package, ideal for slowing down the security checkpoints in airports.
Laptop PCs work just like their desktop brethren; any exceptions are noted
throughout this book.
Choosing the proper PC system depends on your needs. Power users love the
expandability of the tower, or maybe mini-tower. Folks on the go love laptops.
Small-footprint desktops can fit on any desk. (Just remember that the amount
of clutter you have always expands to fill the available desk space.)
Your Basic PC Hardware
Figure 2-1 shows a typical computer system. The big, important pieces have
been labeled for your enjoyment. It’s important that you know which piece is
which and what the proper terms are.

things.
18
Part I: Introducing the PC 

Console: The main computer box is the console, though it may also be called
the system unit (geeky) or the CPU (incorrect). It’s a box that contains your
computer’s soul: electronic guts plus various buttons, lights, and holes into
which you plug the rest of the computer system.
Monitor: The monitor is the device where the computer displays information,
its output.
Keyboard: It’s the thing you type on; it’s the primary way you communicate
with the computer, with input.
Mouse: No rodent or pest, the computer mouse is a helpful device that lets
you work with graphical objects that the computer displays on the monitor.
Speakers: PCs bleep and squawk through a set of stereo speakers, either
external jobbies you set up, as shown in Figure 2-1, or speakers built into the
console or the monitor. Pay more money and you can even get a subwoofer
to sit under your desk. Now, that will rattle your neighborhood’s windows.
Printer: It’s where you get the computer’s printed output, also called hard copy.
You may find, in addition to these basic items, other things clustered around
your computer, such as a scanner, a digital camera, a game pad (or joystick),
an external disk drive, a high-speed modem, and many, many other toys — er,
vital computer components.
One thing definitely not shown in Figure 2-1 — and something you will never
see in a computer manual and especially not in advertisements — is the gan-
glia of cables that lives behind each and every computer. What a mess! These
cables are required in order to plug things into the wall and into each other.
No shampoo or conditioner on Earth can clean up those tangles.
 Ensure that you know where the console, keyboard, mouse, speakers,
monitor, and printer are in your own system. If the printer isn’t present,
it’s probably a network printer sitting in some other room.
 Silly but true: Most beginners (and anyone who doesn’t know better)
believe the monitor to be “the computer.”
 Chapters in Part II of this book go into more detail on the individual
computer components just introduced and illustrated in Figure 2-1.
 CPU stands for central processing unit. It’s another term for the com-
puter’s microprocessor (see Chapter 6). Even so, some folks foolishly
refer to the console as the CPU. Boy, are they wrong!
19
Chapter 2: The Nerd’s-Eye View

Looking About the Console
That console, that main box that really is your computer system, doesn’t
stand alone. Into the console you plug every other gizmo that you use as part
of the computer system. To accommodate them, the console has many, many
holes into which those things plug. Not only that, the console has doors and
slots so that you can access important things inside the console directly.
Topping everything off like nuts on a sundae, the console has interesting but-
tons to press and switches to throw. This section mulls it all over.
 Try to find on your own PC the things mentioned in this section. Get to
know their locations as well as their official computer names.
 Not every console is the same. Use this section as a general guide.
Major points of interest 
on the console, front
The front of the console is for you, dear computer user. That’s where you
interact with the computer system directly, by adding or removing disks,
observing lights, punching buttons, and perhaps even plugging one or two
special items into the PC’s tummy.
Use Figure 2-2 as your reference as you go hunting for the following items:
CD-ROM or DVD drive: Like a music or video player, your computer digests
CDs and DVDs through a slot or tray on the front of the console. Some com-
puters may have a dual CD/DVD drive, and others may have one of each.
Read more about this in Chapter 8.
Future expansion: Some spots on the console’s nose may look like they’re
CD-ROM or disk drives, but they’re not! They’re simply blanks that cover
holes — holes you can use for adding things to your computer someday.
Floppy drive: This slot eats floppy disks. Some software comes on floppy
disks, and you can use these disks to move files from one PC to another. Not
every PC sold today comes with a floppy drive.
Air vents: Okay, this one isn’t impressive, but most consoles sport some type
of air vent on the front. Don’t block the air vents with books or sticky notes!
The thing’s gotta breathe.
20
Part I: Introducing the PC 

The secret panel: Some PCs, especially home models, have a secret panel or
door that pops open. Behind it, you can find connectors for joysticks, micro-
phones, headphones, or other handy items you may need to plug and unplug
from time to time. Having the secret panel is handier than having to reach
around behind the computer and fumble for plugs and holes.
Buttons and lights: Most of a computer’s buttons are on the keyboard. A few
of the more important ones are on the console, and these buttons on fancier
PCs are accompanied by many impressive tiny lights. These buttons and
lights include the following:
 Power button: It’s no longer a plain on–off button — it’s the power
button, and it can do more than just turn the computer off or on. See
Chapter 4 for the details.
 Reset button: Rare, but still found on some computers is a button that
forces the computer into a restart during times of woe. Consider it a plus
if your PC has such a button.

Chapter 2: The Nerd’s-Eye View

 Sleep button: This rare button is designed specifically to put the com-
puter into a coma and suspend all activity without turning the computer
off. On some PCs, this button and the power button are the same.
 Disk drive lights: These lights flash when the hard drive, floppy drive,
or CD-ROM drive is working. On a hard drive, the light is your reassur-
ance that it’s alive and happy and doing its job. On all other types of
drives (with removable disks), the light indicates that the computer is
using the drive.
Other fun and unusual things may live on the front of your console, most of
which are particular to a certain computer brand.
 The front of the console may also boast a brand label or manufacturer’s
tattoo.
 Some newer computers have stickers that show the secret Windows
installation number or proclaim such nonsense as “I was built to run
Windows 3D” or “A Pentium Wazoo lurks inside this box.”
 For more specific information on the connectors lurking behind a secret
panel, see the section “The I/O panel,” later in this chapter.
 Don’t block the air vents on the front of the console. If you do, the com-
puter may literally suffocate. (It gets too hot.)
 A hard drive light can be red or green or yellow, and it flickers when the
hard drive is in use. Don’t let it freak you out! It’s not an alarm; the hard
drive is just doing its job.
Things of note on the console’s rump
The console’s backside is its busy side. That’s where you find various con-
nectors for the many other devices in your computer system: a place to plug
in the monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers, and just about anything else that
came in the box with the PC.
Use Figure 2-3 as a guide for finding the following important things on the
back of your PC’s console. Note that some things may look different, some
may be missing, and some newfangled things may not be listed here.
Power connector: This thing is where the PC plugs into a cord that plugs into
the wall.
Fan: Air gets sucked in here, blows around inside the console to keep things
cool, and then puffs out the vents.
22
Part I: Introducing the PC 

Voltage switch: Use this item to switch power frequencies to match the speci-
fications for your country or region.
Expansion slots: These slots are available for adding new components on
expansion cards to the console and expanding your PC’s hardware. Any con-
nectors on the expansion cards appear in this area, such as the audio and
video connectors on a DVD expansion card.
Vents: The breathing thing again.
I/O panel: Aside from the power cord, and anything attached to an expansion
card, the rest of your PC’s expansion options and plug-in type things are
located in a central area I call the I/O panel. Details of what you can find there
are covered in the next subsection.

Chapter 2: The Nerd’s-Eye View

The I/O panel
To either help keep all the connectors in one spot or just create the most
intensely cable-crammed location on the console, your PC most likely has an
I/O panel, normally found on the console’s rear. This is where you add vari-
ous expansion options to the PC as well as plug in the standard devices
shown way over in Figure 2-1.
Use Figure 2-4 as your guide for what’s what. The items you find on your PC’s
I/O panel may be labeled with text, or they may include the symbols listed in
Table 2-1.
Keyboard connector: The keyboard plugs into this little hole.
Mouse connector: It’s generally the same size and shape as the keyboard
connector, although this hole has a mouse icon nearby to let you know that
the mouse plugs in there.
USB port: Plug snazzy devices into these Certs-size Universal Serial Bus
(USB) slots. See Chapter 7 for more information about USB.
Serial, or COM, ports: PCs have at least one of these ports, named COM1. A
second one is called COM2.
Video/VGA connector: Your PC’s monitor plugs into this hole, which looks
like the serial port, but it has 15 holes rather than 9. A second, digital monitor
connector may be available for plugging in LCD monitors. Also, these connec-
tors may be located on an expansion card rather than the I/O panel.
SPDIF In/Out: These connectors are used to attach the fiber optic cable,
used for digital audio. Audio coming into the computer plugs into the In hole;
the sound the computer generates goes out the Out hole.

Part I: Introducing the PC 

Microphone jack: The computer’s microphone plugs into this hole.
Line-in jack: This jack is where you plug in your stereo or VCR to the PC for
capturing sound.
Speaker/sound-out jack: It’s where you plug in your PC’s external speakers or
headphones, or where you hook up the PC to a sound system. (Also check
the “secret panel” on the front of the console for a headphone connector.)
Dial-up modem: This is where you connect your PC’s modem to the phone
jack in the wall. If two phone or modem holes are on the I/O panel, the
second one is for a telephone extension. Note that this is not where you con-
nect a broadband (DSL or cable) modem.
Ethernet (network) connector: This is where you plug in a local area network
(LAN) connector, or where you attach a broadband modem to the PC. Not
every computer has one of these connectors.
Printer port: The PC’s printer plugs into this connector.
IEEE ports: These ports are used for many things, similar to the USB ports.
They may be labeled IEEE, 1394, or FireWire. A smaller version of the port
may be labeled DV, for Digital Video.
Not pictured in Figure 2-4 but available on many PCs are the following 
connectors:
S-Video Out: If your PC sports a DVD drive, the S-Video connector allows you
to connect an S-Video-happy TV to your PC.
Joystick port: A port used for older-style joysticks, though most all PC joy-
sticks now sold plug into the USB port.
The good news? You connect all this stuff only once. Then your PC’s butt
faces the wall for the rest of its life and you never have to look at it again
(well, unless you add something in the future).
 The keyboard and mouse connectors are different! Be certain that you
plug the proper device into the proper hole, or else the keyboard and
mouse don’t work!
 See Chapter 7 for more information on these holes and what plugs 
into them.
 See Chapter 13 for more on modems.

Helpful hieroglyphics and hues
Even though most PC connectors are different, manufacturers have a set of
common colors and symbols used to label the various holes, connectors, and
ports on the console’s butt. They’re listed in Table 2-1 to help you find things,
in case the need arises.

here’s nothing difficult about setting up a computer. A child could do it.
Well, a child with an IQ of about 240. Or maybe just a child who’s lucky.
They say if you get a big enough hammer . . . and hammering away will even-
tually get you something, but something more akin to modern art than a truly
functional computer.
This chapter is about setting up your computer — specifically, what goes
where and also how various things plug into each other. It can really be as
easy as inserting the proverbial Tab A into the primordial Slot B — especially
when you know exactly where Tab A is and how it fits into Slot B.
 This chapter covers basic computer setup. Turning the computer on is
covered in Chapter 4.
 See Chapter 7 for additional information on what do to next, specifically
after adding USB, IEEE, or other expansion options to your computer.
Setting Up Your PC
Your computer runs faster when you take it out of the box.

Unpack the boxes
Computers can come in one, two, or multiple sets of boxes. If you’re lucky,
one of the boxes says “Open me first.” Open that one first. Otherwise,
attempt to locate the box containing the console. Open that one first.
Be sure to look through everything. Sometimes, manufacturers stick impor-
tant items inside boxes inside boxes, or tucked away between pieces of pack-
ing material. Look over everything.
Open other boxes as well to be certain that you have all the pieces necessary
for your computer system. (Refer to Chapter 2 for a review of the pieces.) If
you’re missing anything, call someone!
 Keep the packing slip, warranty, sales receipt, and other important
pieces of paper together.
 Don’t fill out the warranty card until after the computer is set up and
running fine. (If you have to return the computer, the store likes it best if
you have not filled in the warranty card.)
 Keep the boxes and all the packing material. You need them if you have
to return the computer. Also, the boxes are the best way to ship the
computer if you ever have to move. Some movers don’t insure a com-
puter unless it’s packed in its original box.
 Your computer may have come with a roadmap or flow chart type of dia-
gram that tells you how to set everything up. If so, follow those instruc-
tions first and use the instructions here as suggestions.
Set up the console first
The console is the main computer box, the locus of all the PC’s activities, so
it’s best if you set it up first. Put it on the desktop or location where you
imagine you’ll soon become the computing maven you’ve always dreamed
that you would be.
Don’t back the console up against the wall just yet. You need to start plugging
things into the console’s back. Not until everything is connected to the con-
sole do you want to push it back up against the wall. (Even then, leave some
room so that you don’t crimp the cables.)
 The console needs to breathe. Don’t set up the computer in a confined
space or inside a cabinet where there’s no air circulation.
 Avoid setting the console by a window where the sun will heat it up. Com-
puters don’t like to operate in extreme heat — or cold for that matter.
 A computer by a window also makes a tempting target for a smash-and-
grab thief. 
30
Part I: Introducing the PC 

A General Guide to Plugging Things 
into the Console
All major parts of your computer system plug directly into the console, which
means that once you have the console set up, the next step in assembling your
computer is to unpack other pieces parts and hook them into the console.
Don’t plug anything into the wall just yet! Even so, as you begin to set up your
computer system and attach various gizmos, ensure that those devices with
an on–off switch have the switch in the Off position.
This section covers the basics of connecting many popular things to the con-
sole. Use this information when you first set up the computer, as well as later
when you expand or add to your computer system.
Unless you read otherwise, it’s okay to plug in most computer gizmos while
the computer is on. There are some exceptions to this rule, so carefully read
this section!
Audio
The PC uses the tiny mini-DIN connector for standard audio. Most computer
audio gadgets — speakers and microphones, for example — use this connec-
tor. If not, you can buy an adapter at any audio store or Radio Shack.
 PC speakers connect to the Line Out, speaker, or headphone jack on the
console.
 Microphones connect to the microphone connector.
31
Chapter 3: Insert Tab A into Slot B
It’s a PC, not an oven or a refrigerator
Your PC wants to operate in just about the same
temperatures as you, the human, enjoys. Most
computers list their happiest operating temper-
atures on the case somewhere. Generally
speaking, temperatures between 40 and 80
Fahrenheit (4 to 27 Celsius) are best for a com-
puter. When it gets too hot, the computer starts
to act funny and may spontaneously restart
itself. When temperatures get too cold, the
computer may not even start!
Also avoid humidity, which can really gum up a
computer. I’ve heard from readers in tropical
climes who’ve reported mold growing inside
PCs — the humidity was that bad! If you’re
going to compute where it’s humid, do so in an
air-conditioned room!

 The Line In connector is used to connect any non-amplified sound
source, such as your stereo, VCR, phonograph, Victrola, or other sound-
generating device.
 Yes, the difference between the Line In and microphone jack is that Line
In devices aren’t amplified.
 Be sure to check the front of the console for another spot to plug in the
headphones. It’s much more handy than using the connector on the back.
 If your PC has DVD audio, be sure to plug the speakers into the DVD
card’s output, not the standard audio output on the I/O panel.
IEEE, 1394, FireWire
On a PC, the IEEE port is used primarily for connecting audio or video
devices to the computer, most notably a digital videocamera. Even so, exter-
nal disk drives and scanners are available, which you can also use with the
IEEE port.
Generally speaking, most PCs don’t come with an IEEE port, so the USB port
is used instead. Even so, you can add an IEEE port to your PC by installing a
simple expansion card.
32
Part I: Introducing the PC 
Know your computer cables
Unless your computer system is a wireless
gizmo, the devices in it connect to the console
by using a cable. The cable is known by which
hole, or port, it plugs into, as well as the cable’s
length. For example, USB cables plug into USB
ports and come in varying lengths.
The ends of a computer cable are configured so
that you cannot plug the cable in backward.
Generally, the connector for the console is one
shape, and the connector for the gizmo is
another shape. There are exceptions, in which
case it doesn’t matter which end of the cable
plugs in where.
Some cables are permanently attached to their
devices: The mouse and keyboard have such
cables, for example. Other cables are separate.
That just means that you must remember to plug
in both ends.
Extra cables, if you need them, can be pur-
chased at any computer or office supply store
or over the Internet. As a suggestion, measure
the distance for which you need a cable and
then double it to get a cable of the proper
length. For example, if it’s 2 feet between your
console and where you want a microphone, get
a 4-foot cable.

You can plug any IEEE device into the computer at any time. The computer or
the device can be on or off when you plug things in or remove them. Be sure
to check with the device’s documentation for any exceptions to this rule.
 There are two types of IEEE connectors: small and large. The small one
is used specifically with digital video and is often labeled DV. Be sure to
look for one of these in the secret panel on the front of the console (if
the console has such a panel).
 IEEE devices require an IEEE cable, which may or may not come with 
the device.
 See Chapter 7 for more information on all things IEEE.
Keyboard and mouse
The PC keyboard plugs into the keyboard port on the back of the console.
The mouse plugs into the mouse port. Note that the two ports look identical,
but they are different. Don’t plug the keyboard or mouse into the wrong port
or else neither device works.
 If you’re using a USB keyboard or mouse, plug the keyboard or mouse
into any USB port.
 Some USB keyboards and mice come with a tiny adapter, designed to
convert the USB port into a keyboard or mouse port connector.
 Don’t plug the keyboard or mouse into the keyboard or mouse port
while the computer is on. It may damage the keyboard, mouse, or com-
puter. This warning doesn’t apply when plugging a keyboard or mouse
into a USB port.
Modem
A dial-up modem connects to the phone company’s wall jack by using a stan-
dard telephone cord. (The cord probably came with the PC.) It works just like
plugging in a telephone, and you leave the cord connected all the time. (The
modem “hangs up” after a connection, just like a telephone.)
You can use the modem’s second phone jack, if available, to connect a real
telephone to the computer so that you can use the phone when the computer
isn’t on the line. The second phone jack is labeled Phone and may have a
telephone symbol by it. (The first jack is labeled Line.)
33
Chapter 3: Insert Tab A into Slot B

There are also external dial-up modems, which connect to either the USB
port or the serial port. You still need a telephone cord to connect the exter-
nal modem to the phone company’s wall jack. Note that external modems
have on–off switches.
 Broadband modems — either cable, DSL, or satellite — plug into the
computer’s networking jack. See “Network,” later in this chapter.
 Be careful not to confuse the modem’s jack with the networking jack.
They look similar, but the networking jack is slightly wider.
Monitor
The monitor plugs into the VGA, or graphics adapter, jack on the back of the
console. The plug goes in only one way. If you have a digital monitor, find and
use the digital jack. Some digital monitors come with a digital-to-VGA adapter
if your console lacks a digital jack.
If the console has two VGA connectors, you want to use the one on an expan-
sion card rather than the one on the console’s I/O panel.
Network
Plug the network, or Cat-5, cable into the network jack on the back of the con-
sole. This is how you connect your PC to a network, or how you connect to a
broadband modem.
Another name for the network jack is RJ-45. It’s similar in size to the modem’s
jack, so try not to confuse them.
Part III of this book covers computer networking.
Printer
Plug your computer’s printer into the printer port. The standard PC printer
cable has two distinct ends, only one of which can be plugged into the con-
sole. The other plugs into the computer.
If you’re using a USB printer, use any USB port to connect the printer to the
console.
34
Part I: Introducing the PC 

 For printers with both printer and USB options, use the USB option.
 If you use a standard printer cable, be sure to get a bidirectional cable.
It’s often necessary for the printer software to work properly.
 Printers can also be accessed via the computer network. See Part III of
this book for more information on networking.
Optical audio
Newer PCs sport SPDIF connectors that allow you to use digital audio devices
with the computer. The digital audio devices must also have SPDIF connec-
tors, and you must use special (and not cheap) fiber optic cable to connect
these high-end toys.
 Plug optical audio input into the computer’s SPDIF In connection. To use
the computer’s optical audio output, plug the cable into the SPDIF Out
connector.
 Be careful not to bang, touch, or taunt the clear glass ends of the optical
cable. Better cables come with little protective caps that you can keep
on the ends when the cable isn’t connected.
 Optical audio is optional.
 SPDIF stands for Sony/Philips Digital Interconnect Format. It’s also writ-
ten S/PDIF or S/P-DIF.
S-Video
The S-Video connector is designed to send video output from the computer to a
monitor or television screen, or to any video gizmo that has S-Video input. You
can, for example, connect the console to a large-format TV to play a computer
game. You can do this rather than hook up a standard monitor to your PC.
 S-Video is for video output only; it doesn’t transmit any audio.
 See Chapter 10 for more information on computer monitors.
Serial
The serial, or COM, port isn’t as popular as it once was, though you may still
find external modems or mice that connect to this port. Otherwise, you can
leave it alone.
35
Chapter 3: Insert Tab A into Slot B

 COM is short for communications.
 When you have two serial ports, the first is COM1 and the second is
COM2.
 Another term for the serial port is RS-232.
USB
USB devices plug into the USB port — any USB port, though some devices
specifically want to be connected to the console or to a powered USB hub.
USB cables have two different ends, dubbed A and B. The A end is flat and
exists on the console or the back of any USB hub. The B end is trapezoidal in
shape and plugs into the USB device. Most USB cables are of the A-B variety.
A-A extension cables also exist, so try not to confuse them.
 You’ll probably add your digital camera or scanner to the console by
using a USB cable.
 Many USB devices act as hubs and provide even more USB connectors
for even more gizmos.
 USB cables come in a variety of lengths, but the cables are never longer
than 3 or 4 meters. Any longer and the signal may be compromised.
 Newer USB devices are generally faster and better than the original USB
standard. These newer devices are referred to as high-speed or USB 2.0
devices, and they require a USB 2.0 port. Most PCs come with this port,
though an older PC can add the port by adding an internal expansion card.
 USB devices can be connected or disconnected whether the power is on
or off. If the power is on, the computer instantly recognizes the device
and makes it available.
 Some USB devices should not be unplugged until the computer is done
using them. See Chapter 7 for more information on that, as well as other
details on using USB.
Wireless gizmos
Just because the gizmo says that it’s wireless, don’t think that it means wire-
free. For example, a wireless keyboard or mouse may not connect to the con-
sole by using a wire, but a wireless transmitter is wired to the console, to
either the USB, IEEE, or keyboard/mouse ports. Beyond that point, however,
it has no more wires.
Wireless networking is more or less truly wireless. The networking adapter
on the console has a tiny antenna — no wires. But the rest of the network
36
Part I: Introducing the PC 

will, at some point, require a wire or two. See Chapter 19 for wireless net-
working nonsense.
Plugging Stuff into the Wall
The last thing you need to do, after plugging your computer components into
the console and setting them all up, is to plug all those gizmos into the wall.
The things need power!
The mighty power strip
You may have noticed that you have far many more devices that need to be
plugged in than you have available sockets in the wall. No problem! That’s
why power strips were invented! The idea is to plug everything into a power
strip and then plug that single power strip into the wall, as illustrated in
Figure 3-1.
Wall socket

Monitor

Figure 3-1:

37
Chapter 3: Insert Tab A into Slot B

Follow these steps:
1. Ensure that all your gizmos with on–off switches are in the Off position.
2. Ensure that the power strip is in the Off position.
3. Plug everything into the power strip.
4. Turn your gizmos to the On position.
Now you’re ready to turn on the computer system, which is done by turning
the power strip on. But not yet! The official on–off information is in Chapter 4.
See that chapter for more information, though I highly recommend finishing
this entire chapter before you plow ahead.
 Most power strips have six sockets, which is plenty for a typical com-
puter system. If not, buy a second power strip, plug it into its own wall
socket, and use it for the rest of your computer devices.
 Try to get a power strip with line noise filtering. Even better, pay more to
get a power strip that has line conditioning! That’s super nice for your
electronic goodies.
 I recommend the Kensington SmartSockets power strip. Unlike cheaper
power strips, the SmartSockets lines up its sockets in a perpendicular
arrangement, which makes it easier to plug in bulky transformers.
 Don’t plug one power strip into another power strip; it’s electrically
unsafe!
 Don’t plug a laser printer into a power strip. The laser printer draws too
much juice for that to be effective — or safe. Instead, you must plug the
laser printer directly into the wall socket. (It says so in your laser
printer’s manual — if you ever get around to reading it.)
The UPS power solution
UPS stands for uninterruptible power supply, and it’s the best thing to have
for hooking up your computer system to the wall socket. Basically, a UPS is a
power strip combined with a battery to keep your computer running when
the power goes out.
The notion behind a UPS is not to keep computing while the power is out.
Instead, the UPS is designed to keep your basic computer components — the
console and monitor — up and running just long enough for you to save your
work and properly shut down the computer. That way, you never lose any-
thing because of a power outage.
38
Part I: Introducing the PC 

Figure 3-2 illustrates the proper way to set up your computer system with a
UPS and power strip. Note that some UPS systems also have non-battery-
backed-up plugs so that you can plug everything into the UPS directly. Just
be sure to plug the monitor and console into the battery-backed-up sockets.
 Ignore what it says on the box: A UPS gives you maybe five minutes of
computer power. Be like Stan and save your stuff to disk, and then shut
down Windows and turn off the computer. You can print, scan, modem,
or do whatever when the power comes back on.
 Leave the UPS on all the time. You need to turn it off only when the
power is out and the computer has been properly shut down.
 In addition to emergency power, a UPS provides higher levels of electri-
cal protection for your equipment. Many models offer surge, spike, and
dip protection, which keep your PC running smoothly despite any nas-
ties the power company may throw your way.
39
Chapter 3: Insert Tab A into Slot B
Surges, spikes, and lightning strikes
The power that comes from the wall socket into
your computer isn’t as pure as the wind-driven
snow. Occasionally, it may be corrupted by
some of the various electrical nasties that,
every now and then, come uninvited into your
home or office. Here’s the lowdown:
Line noise: Electrical interference on the power
line, most commonly seen as static on the TV
when someone uses the blender.
Surge: A gradual increase in power.
Serge: Some guy from Europe.
Spike: A sudden increase in the power, such as
what happens when lightning strikes nearby.
Dip: The opposite of a surge; a decrease in
power. Some electrical motors don’t work, and
room lights are dimmer than normal. This is also
known as a brownout.
Power outage: An absence of power coming
through the line. People in the 1960s called this
a blackout.
If possible, try to get a power strip with surge
protection for your computer. You have a price
to pay, but it’s worth it. For an even better power
strip, find one with both surge protection and
noise filtering or line conditioning.
The most expensive form of protection is spike
protection. That causes the power strip to lay
down its life by taking the full brunt of the spike
and saving your computer equipment.
Note that spikes come through not only the
power lines, but also the phone lines. So, if light-
ning strikes are a common occurrence in your
area, get a power strip with phone line protec-
tion, as well as network protection if you’re
using a broadband modem.
For more information about nasty things that
can walk into your house through your wall
sockets, contact your electrical company. It
may offer its own solutions to help you keep
your valuable electronics safe, such as power
protection right at the breaker box.

Using the UPS (a short play)
A large boom is heard. The lights flicker and then go out. ROGER is left sitting in
the dark, but his computer is still on. The UPS beeps once every few seconds.
FELICIA rushes in.
FELICIA: The power is out! The brioche I put in the toaster oven is
ruined! Did you lose that urgent doodle you were creating in Paint?
ROGER: No, darling, I’m still working on it. See? Our UPS has kept the
computer console and monitor on during this brief outage.
FELICIA: Oh! That explains the beeping.
ROGER: Yes, the UPS beeps when the power has gone out. It does that
just in case I don’t notice the pitch darkness we happen to be in.
FELICIA: Well, hurry up and print your doodle!

ROGER: Nay! I shan’t print. Printing can wait, which is why I did not con-
nect the printer to the UPS. It’s as powerless as the toaster oven.
FELICIA: What can you do? Hurry! The UPS battery won’t last forever!
ROGER: Relax, gentle spouse. I shall save to disk, thus. [Ctrl+S] Now I
may shut down the computer, assured with the knowledge that my
doodle file is safely stored on the internal hard drive. There. (He turns off
the computer and monitor. He shuts off the UPS and the beeping stops.)
Now we can weather the storm with peace of mind.
Two hours later, after the power is back on, FELICIA and ROGER are sipping wine:
FELICIA: Honey, you sure are smart, the way you used that UPS.
ROGER: Well, I’m just thankful I read Dan Gookin’s book PCs For
Dummies, published by Wiley. I think I shall buy more of his books.
FELICIA: Who knew that we could find such happiness, thanks to a com-
puter book?

ome would find a computer frightening enough without knowing that the
evil device has no true on–off switch. Some of the most evil computers in
all of fiction seem to figure this one out right away. Just as Our Hero realizes,
“Hey! It’s a computer — I’ll just unplug it,” the wicked computer is one step
ahead. “You cannot unplug me!” the computer says in its tinny, mechanical
voice, “I’ve hooked myself directly into the power system. Bwa-ha-ha!”
Although your computer may not have a big red on–off switch, it does have a
power button. You use that button to turn the PC on and off. You can also use
that button for other purposes as well because the computer actually lets
you define what it is the power button does. That’s supposed to be friendly,
not scary! Even so, I’ve devoted this entire chapter to the sole topic of turn-
ing the computer on and then turning it off again.
How to Turn On Your PC
When everything is plugged in and ready to go (refer to Chapter 3), you turn
on the computer this way:
1. Turn on everything but the console.
2. Turn on the console last.

Or, if everything is plugged into a power strip, just turn on the power strip.
If the console and monitor are plugged into a UPS (which should be kept on
all the time) and everything else is plugged into a power strip, do this:
1. Turn on the power strip, which turns on all the computer’s external
devices, or peripherals.
2. Press the monitor’s power button to turn it on.
3. Press the console’s power button to turn it on.
Success is indicated by your computer system coming to life; you can hear
the fan and disk drives whir and warble into action, and various lights on the
console, keyboard, and other devices may flash at you or glow softly. The
scanner and printer may creak their weary bones into action. Get ready to
start computing!
 By turning the console on last, you allow time for the other devices in
the computer system to initialize and get ready for work. That way, the
console recognizes them and lets you use those devices in your com-
puter system.
 Not all computer devices have their own on–off switches. For example,
some USB scanners and USB disk drives use the USB port’s power. To
turn these devices off, you must unplug the USB cable (though that’s not
necessary unless the device is behaving improperly).
 You don’t have to turn everything on when the computer starts. For
example, if you don’t plan on printing, there’s no need to turn the printer
on. In fact, you don’t need to turn on most printers until you’re ready to
print, anyway.
 Some devices can be left on all the time. For example, your printer may
have a special low-power mode that allows you to keep it on all the time,
yet it uses very, very little energy. It’s often better to keep such devices
on all the time than to turn them on or off several times a day.
 It’s generally a good idea to keep the DSL or cable modem on all the time.
 Also see the later section “Should You Leave the Computer On All the
Time?” for information on keeping your computer on all the time.
 The largest button on the front of the monitor turns it on. Some older
models may have the on–off switch in back. Indeed, many computer
devices have their switches in the back, usually next to where the power
cord attaches.
 When something doesn’t turn on, check to see whether it’s plugged in.
Confirm that all the cables are properly connected.
44
Part I: Introducing the PC 

The PC Setup program
At some point during the startup process, you see a message on the monitor
about pressing a certain key, or keyboard combination, to enter the PC’s
Setup program. Pay attention to those keys!
You don’t always need to run or access the PC Setup program, but it’s good
to know how to get there when you do — for example, when you’re adding
more memory to the PC, updating some types of hardware, or disabling
chipset features — technical stuff, and rare, but often necessary.
 Write down on this book’s Cheat Sheet the keys used to access the PC
Setup program.
 Common keys to press for getting into the PC Setup program include Del
or Delete, F1, F2, F10, F11, and the spacebar.
 The PC Setup program is part of your computer’s hardware. It’s not part
of Windows.
 One feature of the PC Setup program is that you can apply a system
password for your computer. Although I strongly recommend using
passwords on the Internet and for your computer accounts, I recom-
mend against setting a system password in the PC Setup program. Unlike
with those other passwords, if you forget the system password, there’s
nothing you can do and your computer is pretty much useless.
Trouble in Startup Land!
Hopefully, Windows starts right up and you get on with your work. You may
experience a few unwelcome detours along the way.
45
Chapter 4: Computer On, Computer Off
Ignore these other terms for “starting a computer”
Any of the following terms is roughly equivalent
to “starting the computer.” Use them at your
own risk, usually in the presence of a licensed,
high-tech professional.
Cold start Cycle power Hard start
Power on Power up Soft boot Warm boot
Boot Reboot Reset Restart

The most common warning happens when you leave a floppy disk in the PC’s
floppy drive. You see a message displayed regarding a “non-system” disk —
something scary like that. Anyway, remove the floppy disk from drive A 
and press the Enter key on the keyboard, and the computer starts along its
merry way.
For other startup problems, such as starting in the oddly named Safe mode,
please refer to my book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
Here Comes Windows!
Starting a computer is a hardware thing. But the hardware is dumb, remem-
ber? It needs software to keep things hopping, and the most important piece
of software is your computer’s operating system. For most PCs, that operat-
ing system is Windows. So, after starting your computer’s hardware, the next
thing you have to deal with is Windows.
Log in, mystery guest
The first time you run Windows on your PC, you do some extra setup and
configuration. After that, you may also find that you have to log in and iden-
tify yourself. This is done first of all as a security measure (especially if
you’ve applied a password to your account), but also to keep your stuff 
separate from anyone else who may use the same computer.
Choose your account from the list and, optionally, type a password if you’re
prompted to do so. Figure 4-1 shows a typical friendly Windows login screen.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click on your account name or the cute picture by your account.
If you don’t have an account name, you can use the Guest account, if it’s
present. (Refer to a book more specific to Windows for information on
setting up accounts.)
2. Enter your password into the box, if one appears.
Carefully type your password into the box.
3. Click the green arrow or press the Enter key to have Windows check
your password.
46
Part I: Introducing the PC 

If everything goes well, you next see Windows main location, its home plate,
its lobby, which is called the desktop. Keep reading in this section. If you goof
up your password, try again. You can use the Password Hint link to remind
you of your password — but you must type a password to get into the system!
 The login screen shown in Figure 4-1 is the Welcome screen. There’s also
a more terse version of the same thing, a screen that simply lists blank
spots for a user name and password. You must type your password into
a Password box and then click the OK button to log in.
 The word login comes from the word log, as in a list of activities or expe-
riences. The login is just like entering your name in a log.
 It’s possible to avoid the login screen. If the computer has only one
account and that account lacks a password, the Welcome screen doesn’t
appear. I don’t recommend this technique, however, because passwords
are important. Future versions of Windows will demand that all users —
even only users — log in. You may as well get used to it now.
Figure 4-1:
Let us in, the
users beg.
47
Chapter 4: Computer On, Computer Off

Welcome to the desktop
Windows pretty face is something called the desktop, or the main starting
place for doing anything in Windows. A typical desktop is shown in Figure 4-2.
Believe it or not, that’s your instinctive, intuitive, friendly, ready-to-use com-
puter staring at you in the face. You’ve made it.
What you do next depends on the reason you bought your computer. This
book has some ideas in it, but remember that this book is a reference, not a
tutorial. As such, the reference for turning on your computer is all done.
Turning the Computer Off (Shutdown)
In the past 100 or so years that society has been electrified, there’s really
been no easier operation than turning something off. That is, unless the thing
you’re turning off is a computer. Leave it to the computer industry to make
something like turning off a PC as illogical as possible.
Figure 4-2:
Why it’s
called a
desktop, the

48
Part I: Introducing the PC 

It’s not just a question of turning the computer off, but in which way to turn
the computer off: All the way? Temporarily? Or just a weensy bit? Mix in
some jargon and the fact that the computer doesn’t have an on–off switch
(no, it’s a power button), and you have the reason that more pages in this
chapter are devoted to turning a PC off than to turning the darn thing on.
Your options for turning off the PC
Here are your choices for turning off the computer, from not turning it off at
all to an angry tug on the power cord. See the subsections that follow for the
details:
Keep the computer on all the time: A viable option, given the glut of other
choices. See the section “Should You Leave the Computer On All the Time?”
toward the end of this chapter.
Log Off: A way to tell Windows that you’re done without having to turn the
computer off and then on again.
Stand By: The computer slips into a special, power-saving Sleep mode, like
going into a low-power coma.
Hibernate: The computer does turn itself off, but when you turn it back on it
again, it comes back to life much faster. Think “suspended animation.”
Restart: You turn the computer off and on again in one step, mainly when
installing or upgrading software or sometimes to fix minor quirks — like slap-
ping Windows upside its head.
Shut Down: The one real option that turns the darn thing off.
Yank the power cord out of the wall: This method is satisfying, but not 
recommended.
Log yourself off
I’ll be honest: No one does this. Or, if they do, it’s infrequently. Although mul-
tiple people can use the same computer, rare is the time that you really need
to log off. In fact, if you’re the only one using your computer, you can merrily
skip this entire section; don’t bother ever logging off.
49
Chapter 4: Computer On, Computer Off

By logging off, you allow users on the same PC to get in and use their accounts
to, well, do whatever. But by logging off, you ensure that your computer ses-
sion has properly ended, and you save time over restarting the computer.
Here’s how to log off and let someone else use the computer:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Click the Log Off button at the bottom of the Start panel.
That just may be it, or you may see the Log Off Windows dialog box, as
shown in Figure 4-3. If so, do Step 3:
3. Click the Log Off button.
As the computer logs you out, you’re prompted to save any unsaved files,
and any open programs or windows are closed. You’re done for the day. Time
for someone else to use the PC.
If you see the Switch User button (refer to Figure 4-3), you can use it to quickly
log out and let someone else log in. This option is faster than logging out in
that it doesn’t require you to save your stuff or close your programs. When
you return (log in again), all your stuff is waiting for you just as you left it.
Another quick way to log out and lock the computer is to press the Win+L key
combination. The Win key is the Windows key on your keyboard; L stands for
Lock. To unlock the system and get back in, just log in to Windows as you nor-
mally would. Many users use this Win+L trick when they step away from the
computer to ensure that no one nearby snoops at stuff while they’re gone.
Please stand by (Sleep mode)
Stand By mode, also known as Sleep or Suspend mode, was designed as an
energy-saving measure. What it does is to place your PC into a special low-
power mode — almost like the computer is asleep (hence the name). The
Figure 4-3:
Get outta
here, you
bum!
50
Part I: Introducing the PC 

monitor goes blank, the hard drive spins down, and the computer sits there
not doing anything other than saving electricity.
To put your PC into Stand By mode, comply with these steps:
1. Save your work!
This step is important: You must save your documents or files to disk
before putting the PC into Stand By mode. If you want to be extra safe,
close your programs. You may lose data if a power outage occurs while
the computer is quiescent.
2. Click the Start button.
3. Click the Shut Down button at the bottom of the Start panel.
The Turn Off Computer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
4. Click the Stand By button.
The computer then appears to have turned itself off, but it’s really just
resting. Don’t be fooled!
You wake the computer up by pressing a key on the keyboard or jiggling the
mouse. The PC comes back to life, all refreshed and rested and resuming
operations where you left off.
Sleep mode is controlled through the Power Options icon, in the Windows
Control Panel. That’s where you can set options to automatically put the PC
into Sleep mode or to control which parts of the PC sleep and which don’t.
Cybernation hibernation
Rather than turn off your computer, you should consider using Hibernation
instead. It’s really better than turning the computer off, especially if you’re
always in a hurry. Here’s how:
Figure 4-4:
Options for
turning off
your PC.
51
Chapter 4: Computer On, Computer Off

1. Click the Start button.
2. Click the Shut Down button at the bottom of the Start panel.
You see the famous Turn off computer dialog box (refer to Figure 4-4).
But — what? No Hibernate button!
3. Press and hold the Shift key.
Either Shift key activates the Hibernate button, which is inexplicably in
the same place as the Stand By button. Fine. Keep holding that Shift key!
4. Click the Hibernate button.
The computer’s hard drive churns for a few seconds, and then it shuts off.
Yes, the computer is really off.
Wiggling the mouse or slapping the keyboard doesn’t wake up the PC. To
unhibernate, punch the console’s power button. Unlike in a normal startup,
the computer quickly jumps to life and returns to its former state — and
restores things the same as they were the last time you used the PC.
 Not every PC can hibernate.
 If you don’t see the Hibernate option in Step 3, your PC may not have it.
Check with the Windows Control Panel to be sure; open the Power
Options icons and check that dialog box for a Hibernate tab.
 Hibernation saves electricity, in that the computer is really turned off,
and time, in that it takes less time to turn the computer on again.
 If you have a PC with multiple operating systems — a multiboot system —
you have to select Windows XP from that menu first. After that, Windows
unhibernates and restores things to the way they were.
Restarting Windows
You need to reset or restart Windows in two instances. Windows tells you to
restart after you install something new or make some change, or whenever
Something Strange happens. For some reason, a restart clears the computer’s
head, and things return to normal.
Here’s how to restart Windows:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Click the Shut Down button at the bottom of the Start panel.
The Turn Off Computer dialog box appears (refer to Figure 4-4).
3. Click the Restart button.
52
Part I: Introducing the PC 

Windows shuts itself down — almost as though it were turning the computer
off. But, just at the moment the system would have turned off, it starts back
up again — a restart.
 If any files are unsaved, you’re asked to save them before shutting down.
 As the computer shuts down, you may encounter various End Now
dialog boxes. These are stubborn programs that refuse to quit. If you see
any, click the End Now button to expedite the restart process.
 Windows may initiate a restart on its own; or, when upgrading, you may
have to click a button in a window to restart the computer.
 Remember to remove any floppy disks from drive A before restarting. If
you leave a disk in there, the computer tries to start itself from that disk,
which is dumb, but no one ever said that computers are smart.
Turning the darn thing off
Yes, these steps really work:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Click the Shut Down button at the bottom of the Start panel.
You see the Turn Off Computer dialog box, as shown earlier in this chap-
ter, in Figure 4-4.
3. Click the Turn Off button.
After a spell and a fashion, the computer turns itself off.
If you had any unsaved documents or files, Windows asks you to save them
before it fully shuts down.
After turning off the console, go ahead and turn off the other components in
your computer system: monitor, scanner, and other external devices. Or, if
you have a power strip, simply flip its switch to turn everything off.
If you have a UPS, however, do not turn it off; you want to leave it on so that
its battery remains charged.
 Some stubborn programs may require you to deliberately shut them
down. That’s fine. Do so properly; avoid using artillery, if possible.
 If the computer shuts down and then immediately restarts, you have a
problem. Refer to your dealer or computer manufacturer for assistance,
or check out my other PC book, Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies,
published by Wiley.

Chapter 4: Computer On, Computer Off

Power Button, What Is Your Function?
Yes, it’s true that the PC no longer has an on–off switch — it has a power
button. So what’s the big deal? The big deal is that the power button is pro-
grammable. You can tell the computer what to do when you press the power
button, from “do nothing” to “turn off the computer.” The choice is up to you.
Normally, pressing the power button is the same as shutting down Windows;
when you press the power button, the computer automatically carries out
the steps shown in the preceding section. But that’s just one of five potential
things the power button can do. To see them all, comply with these steps:
1. Open the Windows Control Panel.
See Chapter 5 for information on opening the Control Panel.
2. Double-click the mouse on the Power Options icon to open it.
The Power Options Properties dialog box appears.
3. Click the Advanced tab.
Look for this text in the dialog box: “When I press the power button on
my computer.” A drop-down list below that text has options that tell the
computer what to do when you press the power button. You see up to
five choices:
• Do nothing. This option effectively disables the power button;
press it and nothing happens.
• Ask me what to do. Pressing the power button displays the Turn Off
Computer dialog box, as shown earlier in this chapter, in Figure 4-4.
• Stand by. The computer goes into Stand By mode.
• Hibernate. The computer hibernates.
• Shut down. The computer shuts down.
For example, if you want the computer to just shut down when you
press the power button, choose the option that reads Shut Down.
4. Select a function for the power button.

Not all computers have programmable power buttons, and often the selec-
tion of power button functions is limited by the computer’s design. Don’t be
disappointed if your PC lacks some of the abilities of others, or even lacks the
ability to assign a function to the power button.
54
Part I: Introducing the PC 

Regardless of which settings you make from the preceding list, when you
press and hold the power button for about two or three seconds, it instantly
turns the computer off. Remember this trick, but use it only in times of des-
peration. Otherwise, shut down the PC properly, as described in this chapter.
Some PC cases do have a true on–off button in addition to a power button.
This button is on the back of the console and is labeled | and O, for on and
off, respectively. Use this button rather than the power button only in times
of dire emergency.
Should You Leave the Computer On 
All the Time?
I’ve been writing about computers for over 20 years now, and this debate has
yet to be settled. Should you leave your computer on all the time? Does it
waste electricity? Is it better for the PC to be on all the time — like the refrig-
erator or Darth Vader night light? Will we ever know the truth? Of course not!
But people have opinions.
“I want to leave my computer off 
all the time”
Hey, I’m with you.
“I want to leave my computer on 
all the time”
I say Yes. If you use your computer often, such as for a home business, or you
find yourself turning it on and off several times during the day, just leave it on
all the time.
The only time I ever turn my computers off is when I’ll be away for longer
than a weekend. Even then, I just hibernate the computers (well, those com-
puters that have the hibernation feature) rather than turn them off.
Does this waste electricity? Perhaps, but most computers have Stand By
mode and save energy when they’re not being used. Modern PCs don’t use
55
Chapter 4: Computer On, Computer Off

that much electricity, and having one on all the time doesn’t raise your elec-
trical bill significantly, not like a Jacuzzi or a time machine.
Also, computers enjoy being on all the time. Having that fan going keeps the
console’s innards at a constant temperature, which avoids some of the prob-
lems that turning the system off (cooling) and on again (heating) cause.
What should you do? Do whatever you feel like doing! I keep my computers
on all the time mostly because I use them all the time and it’s easier for me to
have immediate access to them than to wait for the dumb things to start up
all the time.
 If you use your PC only once a day (during the evening for e-mail, chat,
and the Internet, for example), turning it off for the rest of the day is fine.
 Most businesses leave their computers on all the time.
 Whatever you do with your PC, it’s always a good idea to turn the moni-
tor off when you’re away. Some monitors can sleep just like PCs, but if
they don’t, turning them off can save some electricity.
 If you do leave your computer on all the time, don’t put it under a dust
cover. The dust cover gives the computer its very own greenhouse effect
and brings the temperatures inside the system way past the sweltering
point, like in a sweaty Southern courtroom drama.
 Another good idea: Turn off the computer during an electrical storm.
Even if you have spike protection or a UPS, don’t let that nasty spike of
voltage into your computer during a lightning storm. Unplug the com-
puter. And remember to unplug the phone line. You can’t be too careful.

S
oftware rules the PC’s roost, and the O Supreme One of all software in
your computer is the operating system, the main program that controls
all the other programs. It would be impressive if the operating system were
evil or twisted in some dramatic manner. But, it’s not. No, the operating
system is merely in charge because some program has to be. Besides, the
operating system is too busy minding the computer’s hardware and obeying
your every whim to turn to the dark side.
This is a hardware book, yet a lot of the hardware things this book discusses
relate directly to Windows. Because software is in charge of the hardware,
and Windows is in charge of all the software, this chapter covers some of the
more important places in Windows you need to visit to manage or adjust
your computer’s hardware.
For more information on the various parts of Windows, including the desk-
top, taskbar, and system tray — and their individual pieces parts — please
refer to this book’s companion PCs For Dummies Quick Reference (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).

The Desktop
Windows main screen is the desktop. That’s where the actual windows
appear, those that frame the programs you run or show you a list of files or
icons. The desktop can also have its own icons, such as shortcut icons to
programs, files, or folders you often use. It can also be splashed with a fancy
picture or background.
Figure 5-1 shows a typical Windows XP desktop. You can see various icons
on either side of the screen, a pretty background, plus the Start button and
taskbar on the bottom of the screen. (The Start button and taskbar are cov-
ered later in this chapter.)

58
Part I: Introducing the PC 

 The desktop is merely the background on which Windows shows you its
stuff — like an old sheet you hang from the wall to bore your neighbors
with by showing your Cayman Islands vacation slide show.
 Icons are tiny pictures representing files or programs on your computer.
See Chapter 20 for more information on icons.
 You can change the desktop wallpaper to any image. See Chapter 10.
 Also see Chapter 10 for information on changing the size of the desktop,
or its resolution.
 The desktop is called a desktop for traditional reasons. Several genera-
tions of computers ago, it really did look like a desktop, complete with
paper pad, clock, glue, scissors, and other desktop-y things.
Taming the Taskbar
The desktop is more like a corkboard where you pin icons than a place where
you can grab hold of Windows and strangle it, if the desire is there. If you
really want to wrap your paws around Windows, you must notice the taskbar.
The taskbar is typically located on the bottom of the desktop, as shown in
Figure 5-2. Four important areas are noted in the picture, though the Quick
Launch bar may not be visible on your PC’s taskbar.
You use the taskbar to control the windows on the screen; it allows you to
quickly switch between those windows, or tasks, by clicking a window’s
button. The taskbar is also home to the Start button, which is where you
really control Windows, as well as other doodads covered throughout the
remainder of this chapter.
The System Tray, or Notification Area
The tiny tub on the opposite end of the taskbar from the Start button (refer
to Figure 5-2) displays the current time and day, and also wee little icons that
represent special programs running in Windows. The location is called the
system tray, or notification area.

Chapter 5: Places to Go, Things to See in Windows

 You can see more information about the special programs by either
double-clicking or right-clicking their wee icons.
 Some icons display pop-up bubbles with messages in them as various
things happen in windows.
 There’s no way to completely disable the system tray. You can hide
icons, but you cannot turn the entire thing off without buying a special
utility to do so. (I don’t recommend doing so.)
The Start Button
The Start button is where you start a number of activities in Windows. It truly
is the place to go when you want to start a program, start some activity,
adjust the way Windows works, or even shut down the computer.
The Start button lives on one end of the taskbar, usually in the lower-left
corner of the desktop. Clicking the Start button with the mouse displays the
Start button menu. That’s where the fun — or anguish — starts!
 You can also pop up the Start button menu by pressing the Win key on
your computer’s keyboard. If your computer doesn’t have a Win key,
press Ctrl+Esc to pop up the Start button menu.
 You make the Start button menu go away by pressing the Esc key on the
keyboard.
The Start button menu
You use the Start button menu to start programs as well as get at key loca-
tions elsewhere in Windows. Figure 5-3 shows an example of what the menu
may look like.
Important things to find on the Start button menu are listed in the figure.
Note that the Start button menu can be customized, so what you see on your
screen may look different from what’s shown in the figure.
 To customize the Start button menu, right-click the Start button and
choose Properties from the pop-up menu. Click the Customize button in
the dialog box that appears, and you can find many options for adjusting
how the Start button menu looks and behaves.
 Figure 5-3 shows the Windows XP Start button menu. A Classic Start
menu is available, which looks different. This book assumes that you
have the Windows XP Start button menu, as shown in Figure 5-3.
60
Part I: Introducing the PC 

The All Programs menu
All the programs — software and applications — installed on your computer
are on the Start button menu’s All Programs menu. Clicking that item displays
a pop-up menu full of choices — in fact, the menu is so full that it may fill
more than one column of options on the screen.
The All Programs menu is organized into programs and submenus. To run a
program, click its icon or name on the menu. Or, you can see more programs

organized into the many submenus by clicking a submenu name. Note that
there are submenus on submenus for extra added craziness.
 Chapter 23 has more information on the All Programs menu.
 The All Programs menu may be called More Programs in some versions
of Windows XP.
 The Programs submenus are rather slippery. They pop up and disappear
as your mouse roves over them. Be careful! Accessing them can be aggra-
vating if you’re a sloppy mouse mover or your mouse is too sensitive.
 Refrain from beating your mouse into the table when it behaves 
erratically.
The Control Panel
One important place to know in Windows, especially in regard to your PC
hardware, is the Control Panel. The Control Panel is a special window that
lists icons relating to many aspects of your computer’s hardware, software,
and general configuration.
To display the magical Control Panel window, do this:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Click the Control Panel menu item on the right side of the Start button
menu.
If you don’t see the Control Panel item on the Start button menu, open the My
Computer icon on the desktop. Click to choose Control Panel from the list of
Other Places on the left side of the window. Or, you can click the downward-
pointing arrow on the Address bar and select Control Panel from the drop-
down list.
Figure 5-4 shows a typical Control Panel window, chock full of icons. Later
chapters in this book cover what many of those icons do.
Note that Figure 5-4 shows the Control Panel in Classic view, which is what I
prefer and how this book references things. It’s faster than using Category
view. To switch to Classic view, click the mouse on the text “Switch to Classic
View” on the left side of the window.
62
Part I: Introducing the PC 

Networking Control
If you plan to put your PC on a network or use a broadband (cable or DSL)
Internet connection, you need to know where Networking Central is in
Windows. It’s a sneaky Window named Network Connections.
To display the Network Connections window, click the Start button and
choose Network Connections from the Start button menu. Sadly, this option
may not appear on the Start button menu, in which case you do this:
1. Open the Control Panel.
Refer to the preceding section.
2. Open the Network Connections icon.
There’s your window, which is covered in more detail in Part III of this
book.
Another networking place to know is the My Network Places window, which
can be accessed by opening the My Network Places icon on the desktop or
choosing My Network Places from the Start button menu. The window displays
Figure 5-4:
The Control
Panel.
63
Chapter 5: Places to Go, Things to See in Windows

various network connections available to your computer, on either the local
area network or the Internet. Again, more information on this window is in
Part III.
Places for Your Stuff
Windows has places where you can store your stuff — the files you create.
The big name here is the file system. That includes all the disk drives on your
computer, as well as the stuff you store on those disk drives. The whole sub-
ject is tossed around in Part IV of this book. For now, consider knowing these
three important places:
My Computer: This main icon details all the disk storage in your computer,
as well as any network drives you’re using or a scanner or digital camera. You
display the My Computer window by opening the My Computer icon on the
desktop or accessing it from the Start button menu.
My Documents: This is your home place for the stuff you save on the 
computer — the things you store or create. The window is accessed by open-
ing the My Documents icon on the desktop or via the Start button menu.
Recycle Bin: This icon is on the desktop. It represents File Hell — or that
location where files are sent when you delete them. It’s more like File Limbo
in that it’s possible to recover files from the Recycle Bin when you change
your almighty mind.
Getting Windows to Help You
Windows is huge! To document the entire operating system would require not
only a single book — a fat book — but, rather, multiple fat volumes of that
book. Not even Microsoft sells such a book. Instead, what it did was put all its
documentation and helpful information on the computer itself. It’s called the
Windows Help system.
To access the Windows Help system, you press the F1 key on the keyboard. I
know: F1? What’s up with that? Felp? “F any 1 can help me?” I just don’t get it,
but that’s the key to use.
Pressing F1 in the midst of doing anything in Windows displays helpful infor-
mation about what you’re doing.
64
Part I: Introducing the PC 

To get general help, choose the Help and Support command from the Start
button menu, and you see the Help and Support Center. There, you can type
a question or pick a topic to search for help, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Note that Windows may dial in to the Internet to complete your help
request. This is normal (and you notice it only if you have a dial-up Internet
connection).
The help engine is its own program. When you’re done using help, remember
to quit: Click the X Close button in the upper-left corner of the window.

T
here’s more to your computer hardware than just its
keyboard and monitor. You may touch the keyboard
and mouse, you may look at the monitor, and occasionally
you may slap the printer, but a computer system is more
than those physical things. If you plan on getting as much
as possible from your computer, you’ll need to know the
details — the guts. That’s the stuff that lurks inside the
console, and the real names for all those doodads, gad-
gets, gizmos, and other hardware that make up your com-
puter system. In this part of the book, you’ll find out how
to name, use, adjust, and abuse all that stuff.

eneath the console’s sleek, 21st century exterior lies a tangled chaos of
electronic enigma. It’s a tropical jungle of twisty, vine-like cables con-
necting various circuit boards to power supplies and disk drives, tossed in
with a high-tech salad of circuits, transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other
components, many of which are sharp and pointy. Scary? Not really, but it
isn’t exactly inviting.
Despite the forbidden and complex nature of the console’s innards, it’s not a
forbidden place. Most computer consoles open easily, and that’s for a reason:
Sometimes, you need to get in there to add new stuff to your PC. It’s rare, but
it happens. When it does, you have this chapter as a reference to tell you
what’s what and, most importantly, how not to electrocute yourself.
A Look Around, Inside the Console
You don’t have to open up the computer console — nope, not ever. You have
plenty of options for expanding your computer system without opening the
case. Even so, I highly recommend that you become familiar with the internal
configuration of your computer, or at least have a passing knowledge of
what’s what and what’s where, and its proper name.

Your PC’s innards
Figure 6-1 highlights the important things to note inside your PC’s console.
The figure shows a sideways view, as though you took off the right side of the
console and looked inside. (The left side of the image shows the front of the
console.)
Missing from Figure 6-1 are the myriad cables that festoon the console’s
abdomen. Also, the detail on the motherboard is a bit sparse, and the typical
PC’s console is a lot less roomy. And, if you’ve owned the computer for a
while, some dust is in there too — maybe even cat hair!
The three main parts of the console’s tummy are
 The disk drive cage
 The power supply
 The motherboard
The disk drive cage is a contraption used to hold internal disk drives, a
CD-ROM, a DVD, a hard drive, plus maybe a floppy drive. The cage also has
room for even more disk drives (the so-called “future expansion”), usually
right behind some knock-out panels on the console’s front.

Part II: Computer Guts 

The power supply feeds the console that all-important stuff called electricity.
You can read more about the power supply in the section “The Source of PC
Power,” at the end of this chapter.
Finally, the motherboard is the computer’s main circuitry board. It’s impor-
tant, so it’s talked about later in this chapter, starting with the section “The
Mother of All Boards.”
Everything inside the PC’s case is a modular component. That term means
that individual pieces can be replaced without having to toss out the entire
console. (Modularity is one of the keys to the PC’s success over the years.)
Opening the case (if you dare)
You don’t have to go inside the console if you don’t want to. Instead, return
the console to your computer dealer or fix-it person whenever work needs to
be done. But, if you have even the slight inclination toward fixing things, or
you just have a lot of life insurance, it’s okay to open up the console to add or
replace things inside.
Here are the general steps I recommend for opening the console:
1. Turn off the computer.
Refer to Chapter 4.
2. Unplug the console; remove the power cord.
Turning the console off isn’t enough. You really need to unplug the
power cord. Unplugging other cables isn’t necessary unless you need to
do so to move the console around.
3. Move the console away from the wall or locate it in a place where you
have room to work.
4. Open the console’s case.
The steps for opening the case depend on the case. Some cases require
a screwdriver and the removal of several screws. Other cases may just
pop off or swing open.
Now you’re ready to work inside the console. Refer to Figure 6-1 and try to
find things — but look at all ’dem cables! What a nightmare!
 Never plug the console in when the case is open. If you need to test
something, close the case!
 Typically, you open the case to do one of three things: Add more
memory; add an expansion card; or replace the PC’s battery.
71
Chapter 6: Inside the Box

 While you work in the console, try to keep one hand touching the case
or, preferably, something metal, like the disk drive cage. That way, your
electric potential is the same as the console’s, and you reduce the
chances of generating static electricity — which can damage your 
computer.
Closing the case
When you’re done doing whatever motivated you to open the console, close
it up! Check to ensure that all the wires have been reconnected and that your
internal operations are all wrapped up and no tools or screws are left loose
inside the case.
Reattach the lid or cover, and then plug the console back into the power
cord. Turn the computer on and pray that it still works.
 It may be a good idea not to screw on the case until you’re certain that
the upgrade was successful.
 See Chapter 15 for specific information on updating your PC’s hardware.
The Mother of All Boards
The computer’s largest circuitry board is the motherboard. It’s where the
computer’s most important electronics exist. The motherboard is home to
the following essential PC components, many of which are illustrated earlier
in this chapter, in Figure 6-1:
 Microprocessor
 Chipset
 Memory
 Battery
 Expansion slots
 I/O connectors
 Electronic goobers
The microprocessor, chipset, battery, and expansion card items all have their
own sections in this chapter. Refer to them for more information. Computer
memory is a big deal, so it’s covered exclusively in Chapter 9.
72
Part II: Computer Guts 

The I/O connectors are simply places on the motherboard where the con-
sole’s I/O panels are plugged in. There’s also a connector where the disk
drives plug in, as well as a power connector for electricity from the power
supply. The electronic goobers are those miscellaneous pieces of technology
that engineers put on the motherboard to look impressive.
 The motherboard is the main piece of circuitry inside your PC.
 Though many computer chips can be on the motherboard, the main chip
is the microprocessor. The motherboard exists to support that one chip.
The Microprocessor
At the heart of every computer beats the microprocessor. That’s the com-
puter’s main chip — the computer’s muscle.
Note that the microprocessor is not the computer’s brain. Software is the
brain. The microprocessor is just hardware, and it does only what the soft-
ware tells it to do.
The microprocessor’s job is really rather simple: It can do basic math, it can
fetch and put information to memory, and it does all the input/output (I/O)
stuff, which you didn’t read about in Chapter 1. The key to the microproces-
sor’s success is that, unlike your typical brooding teenager, the microproces-
sor does things very fast.
 When your jaw is tired, you can refer to the microprocessor as the
processor.
 Another term for a microprocessor is CPU. CPU stands for central pro-
cessing unit.
 Modern PC microprocessors run very hot and therefore require special
cooling. You notice inside the PC that the microprocessor wears a tiny
fan as a hat. That helps keep the thing cool.
Naming a microprocessor
A long time ago, in an economy far, far away, computer microprocessors were
named after famous numbers, like 386 and 8088. The trend now is toward
microprocessor names, but not human names, like John or Mary. No, now
microprocessors are named after potential science fiction heroes or pharma-
ceuticals. Here’s a smattering:
73
Chapter 6: Inside the Box

Pentium: The premium microprocessor, developed by industry leader Intel.
Celeron: A less-expensive version of the Pentium and often used in low-end,
or home, PCs.
Athlon: An imitation Pentium from Intel rival AMD. The Athlon is just as good
as the Pentium, though less expensive.
Duron: The Celeron imitation, from AMD.
Other names or numbers may be used along with the main names just listed.
Those suffixes aren’t worth noting because the computer industry changes
them too often for anyone to care. The only important yardstick used to
judge a microprocessor (aside from price) is its speed, which is covered in
the next subsection.
 The two most popular types of Pentium chips that are now sold are the
Pentium 3 and Pentium 4. The Pentium 4 is the newer, better one of the
two.
 The Pentium also has some higher-end siblings: the Itanium and Xeon
microprocessors, used exclusively in high-end server computers.
 Intel is the world’s leading manufacturer of computer microprocessors.
The company developed the 8088, which dwelt in the bosom of the first
IBM PC.
 Another way to describe a microprocessor is by which type of socket on
the motherboard it plugs into. This information is important only to
those folks who choose to build their own PCs.
 Little difference exists between a true Intel and a non-Intel microproces-
sor. As far as your PC’s software is concerned, the microprocessor is the
same no matter who made it. I must note, however, that computer
gamers prefer AMD microprocessors.
The measure of a microprocessor
Microprocessors are gauged by two factors: their muscle power and how fast
they go.
Microprocessor muscle is measured in bits — specifically, how many bits at a
time the chip can toss around. For a typical PC microprocessor, that’s either
32 bits or 64 bits, and 32 bits is the most common.
It helps to think of bits in a microprocessor like cylinders in a car: The more
you have, the more powerful the engine. Or, a better example is lanes on a
freeway: The more you have, the quicker that larger chunks of data (traffic)
can move around.
74
Part II: Computer Guts 

Current microprocessor speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz), or billions of
cycles per second. The higher the value, the faster the microprocessor, with
average speeds between 2.0 GHz (slower) and 4.0 GHz (faster).
Sadly, speed isn’t really a realistic gauge of how fast a microprocessor does
its microprocessing. Speed is a relative thing when it comes to computers,
but even so, a Pentium running at 2.4 GHz is slower than a Pentium running
at 3.0 GHz — not that you would notice.
“Okay, wise guy, so which microprocessor
lives in my PC?”
It’s not easy, after you get home, to confirm that your PC has the micro-
processor you bought. Even if you crack open the case, you can’t really see
the microprocessor because it’s wearing that little fan hat — and even if you
peeled off the hat, the numbers and names printed on the chip may not be of
any use to you.
One way to discover which type of microprocessor dwells in your PC’s
bosom is to use Windows. The System Properties dialog box shows a brief
microprocessor and RAM summary, similar to the one shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2:
The System
Properties
dialog box.
75
Chapter 6: Inside the Box

To summon the System Properties dialog box, press Win+Break on your key-
board (that’s the Windows key plus the key labeled Break or Pause Break).
You can also open this dialog box by opening the System icon in the Control
Panel.
In Figure 6-2, you can see that the PC sports a Pentium 4 microprocessor run-
ning at 3.00 GHz. The computer sports 1GB of RAM. That jibes with what I
paid for, but not every computer’s System Properties dialog box is quite as
explicit.
 Not every System Properties dialog box displays information as com-
plete as that shown in Figure 6-2. When Windows doesn’t really know, it
may say something vague, as in “x86 Family.”
 One of my favorite microprocessor snooper programs is CPU-Z. Here’s
the Web site:
http://www.cpuid.org/cpuz.php
 See Chapter 9 for more information on RAM.
“Can I upgrade my PC’s microprocessor?”
Some computers are sold with the idea that you can upgrade later to a faster
microprocessor. That is true: In many PCs, you can buy a new CPU, remove
the old one, and plug in the new one. Boom! You get instant speed. But I don’t
recommend doing this.
To truly take advantage of newer technology, you really need more than a
new microprocessor. What you need is a new motherboard, some new
memory, and, while you’re at it, new disk drives. Otherwise, the power of
the new CPU gets lost in the old CPU’s antique circuitry.
Another issue is cost. Individually, microprocessors are expensive, especially
the newest, best ones. It’s just easier to buy yourself a whole new computer
than to worry about an upgradeable microprocessor.
Expansion Slots
Your computer’s abilities can be expanded in a number of ways. One of the
most direct ways to add extra circuitry or options to the computer is to plug
an expansion card directly into the motherboard via one of the expansion
slots. The idea is that you can expand your system by adding options not
included with the basic PC.
76
Part II: Computer Guts 

The number and type of slots available in your computer depend on the size
of the console’s case as well as on the motherboard’s design. Some home sys-
tems and most laptops have no expansion slots. That keeps the price down
on the home systems, and, well, laptops are too petite to worry about hulking
expansion cards. Mini-desktop PCs typically have from three to five expan-
sion slots, and those hulking tower PCs can have up to eight expansion slots.
Expansion slots come in three delicious flavors:
ISA: The most ancient type of expansion slot is the ISA, which stands for (get
this) Industry Standard Architecture. That’s because it never really had a
name until another, better type of expansion slot came along. ISA slots hang
around to be compatible with older expansion cards. Most PCs have one or
two ISA expansion slots for compatibility reasons.
PCI: The PCI slot is the most common form of internal expansion for a PC (for
a Macintosh too, but that’s not the subject here). Chances are good that if
you buy an expansion card, it’s a PCI card.
AGP: The final expansion slot is the AGP, or Accelerated Graphics Port. This
special type of slot takes only video expansion cards, usually the nice spendy
ones that do all sorts of amazing graphics. Not every PC has this type of slot,
and if your PC does, it has only one of them.
The backsides of most ISA and PCI cards stick out the rear of the console; the
card’s back replaces the metallic slot cover to reveal special connectors or
attachments for the expansion card.
Having expansion slots in your PC is a good thing, but not entirely necessary.
Most of the goodies available via expansion cards can also be added to the
computer by using external USB or IEEE devices.
 If given the choice, choose a PCI expansion card over an ISA model.
 Small-footprint PCs have the fewest expansion slots. Tower computer
models have the most.
 For more information on video expansion cards, see Chapter 10.
 Expansion cards are sometimes called daughterboards. Get it?
Motherboard, daughterboard? I’m looking forward to auntboard or 
perhaps secondcousinboard.
 Most expansion cards come squirming with cables. This mess of cables
makes the seemingly sleek motherboard look more like an electronic
pasta dish. Some cables are threaded inside the PC; others are left hang-
ing limply out the back. The cables are what make the internal upgrad-
ing and installation process so difficult.

Tick-Tock Goes the Clock
One piece of hardware that’s native to all PCs but not exactly visible on the
motherboard is the internal clock. The clock is battery operated, which
enables it to keep track of the time, day or night, whether the PC is plugged
in or not.
The computer displays the current time — as it believes it to be — on the
system tray on the taskbar. If you point the mouse at the time and hold the
mouse still, the current day and date pop up. But there’s more to the clock
than that nifty trick.
The computer uses the internal clock to not only track the time and to sched-
ule things, but also to time-stamp files. That way, you can determine which
files are created when, sort your stuff, and do other time-related things.
 Windows displays a date-and-time icon on the system tray on the
taskbar. (Refer to Chapter 5.)
 The date-and-time format is based on your country or region. You can
change that display by going to the Control Panel and opening the
Regional and Language Options icon.
“My clock is all screwy!”
Computers make lousy clocks. A typical PC loses about a minute or two of
time every day. Why? Who knows!
Generally speaking, the clock runs slow or fast because of all the various things
going on inside the computer. The more that goes on, the more the clock is
wrong. Especially if you put your computer to sleep, or “hibernate” it, the clock
can get really nuts. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more hibernation information.)
On the positive side, the computer’s clock is well aware of daylight savings
time: Windows automatically jumps the clock forward or backward, and does
so without having to know the little ditty “Spring forward, fall back.” Or is it
the other way around? Whatever — the computer knows and obeys.
What do you do if the clock is wrong? Why, set it, of course. Keep reading!
Setting the clock
To set the date and time on your PC, double-click the time on the taskbar:
Click-click. The Date and Time Properties dialog box magically appears, as
shown in Figure 6-3.
78
Part II: Computer Guts 

Manipulate the controls in the Date and Time Properties dialog box to change
or set the date or time.
For example, type 10:00 AM if it’s 9:58 AM or so. Then, when the telephone
time lady (or whoever) says that it’s 10 o’clock, click the Apply button in the
Date and Time Properties dialog box. That action sets the time instantly.
Click OK when you’re done.
Internet time to the rescue!
One way to tame the wild computer clock is to have the computer itself auto-
matically synchronize the time with one of the many worldwide time servers.
A time server is a computer designed to cough up accurate time information
for any computer that checks in on the Internet.
To configure your PC to use a time server and synchronize itself with time on
the Internet, open the Date and Time Properties dialog box, as described in the
preceding subsection. Then click the Internet Time tab (refer to Figure 6-3).
Put a check mark by the option Automatically Synchronize with an Internet
Time Server. Optionally, choose a time server from the drop-down list.
Windows automatically adjusts the PC’s clock whenever you’re connected to
the Internet. There’s nothing else you need to do — ever!
Boring Details about Your PC’s Battery
All computers have an internal battery, which is part of the motherboard. Its
primary purpose is to help the PC’s clock keep time even when the computer
is off or unplugged.
Figure 6-3:
The Date
and Time

Chapter 6: Inside the Box

A typical PC battery lasts for about six years, possibly more. When it dies,
you know because the computer’s date and time are way off, or perhaps the
PC even has a message telling you that the motherboard’s battery needs
replacing. You can get the replacement at any Radio Shack.
 Yes, you have to open the console’s case to get at the battery. Don’t
expect it to be easy to find, either!
 The PC’s battery may also be used to back up special system informa-
tion, such as the number of disk drives, memory configuration, and
other trivia the computer needs to know all the time, but may not
remember otherwise.
 The motherboard’s battery is in addition to any other batteries in the
computer, such as the main battery used to power a laptop.
The Chipset
Rather than refer to the various and sundry computer chips on the mother-
board as The Various And Sundry Computer Chips On The Motherboard,
computer scientists have devised a single descriptive term. All those chips
are called the chipset.
The chipset is what makes up your computer’s personality. It contains
instructions for operating the basic computer hardware: keyboard, mouse,
networking interface, sound, and video, for example.
Different chipsets are available depending on what types of features the com-
puter offers. For example, some motherboards may come with advanced
graphics in the chipset or maybe wireless networking. Sadly, there’s no easy
way to tell based on the chipset’s weirdo names or numbers; you must refer
to the chipset’s documentation to see what you’re really getting. (Even then,
the info is really only interesting to diehard computer nerds.)
 Different PCs use different chipsets, depending on which company man-
ufactured the motherboard.
 An older term for the chipset, particularly the main ROM chip in a PC, is
BIOS. BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. There’s a BIOS for the
keyboard and mouse, one for the video system, one for the network, and
so on. Altogether, they comprise the chipset. (See Chapter 9 for more
info on ROM.)

The Source of PC Power
Lurking inside your PC’s console is something that does no thinking and isn’t
used for data storage. That’s the power supply. It does several wonderful
things for Mr. Computer:
 Brings in electricity from the wall socket and converts it from wild AC
current into mild DC current
 Provides electricity to the motherboard and everything living on the
motherboard
 Provides juice to the internal disk drives
 Contains fans that help keep the inside of the console cool
 Contains or is directly connected to the PC’s power button
The power supply is also designed to take the brunt of the damage if your
computer ever suffers from electrical peril, such as a lightning strike or
power surge. In those instances, the power supply is designed to die, and to
sacrifice itself for the good of your PC. Don’t panic! You can easily replace the
power supply and discover that the rest of your PC is still working fine.
 Thanks to the fans, the power supply is the noisiest part of any PC.
 Power supplies are rated in watts. The more internal hardware stuff
your PC has — the more disk drives, memory, and expansion cards, for
example — the greater the number of watts the power supply should
provide. The typical PC has a power supply rated at 150 or 200 watts.
More powerful systems may require a power supply upward of 300 watts.
 One way to keep your power supply — and your computer — from
potentially going Poof! (even in a lightning strike) is to invest in a surge
protector, or UPS. Refer to Chapter 3 for details.

 Adding even more USB ports
 Making use of the IEEE port
O
ne key to the PC’s success over the past 25 years is its expandability.
You can not only expand a computer on the inside of the console (via
the expansion slots), but you can also add a nearly infinite number of gadgets
to your computer system on the outside of the console. That’s done by plug-
ging the gizmo into one of the computer’s basic ports, as discussed in this
chapter.
What Is a Port?
Perhaps you’ve been on the port side of a ship, looking out a porthole at a
seaport and seeing people with portable computers? If so, you’ve used the
word port about as much as you could, except for the peculiar way the word
port is used when it comes to computers.
In the computer world, a hardware port is a place on the computer where infor-
mation can be sent or received or both. Often, it’s called an I/O port because
it’s used for both input and output. Information flows out of the computer
through the port, and into the computer from whatever gizmo is attached to
the port.
For technological as well as historical reasons, the typical PC has a variety 
of ports. There are specific ports, such as the printer port, mouse port, and
keyboard port. Then there are general ports, such as the serial, USB, and 

IEEE 1394 and FireWire ports. The rest of this chapter covers what is what
and how each port is best used.
 Also refer to Chapter 3 for information on plugging things into the vari-
ous PC ports.
 On the software side, port means something else! It refers to rewriting a
program to be compatible with another computer, operating system, or
computing platform.
Legacy Ports
When the PC was first designed, external thingamajigs were attached to the
console by using specific and aptly named ports. If you wanted to attach a
keyboard, mouse, or printer, for example, you would use a specific keyboard,
mouse, or printer port.
Since that time, those older, or legacy, ports have been gradually phased out
on a PC, and replaced by the versatile USB port. For example, you can now
have a PC where the mouse, keyboard, and printer plug into the USB port.
But on most PCs, those older ports still exist and are still used just as they
were on the first IBM PC.
Mouse and keyboard
The mouse and keyboard ports are designed specifically for what they do:
The mouse plugs into the mouse port, and the keyboard into the keyboard
port. And, despite the fact that both ports look alike, they are unique, and
strange things happen when you connect things improperly.
Some wireless keyboards and mice still use the traditional keyboard and
mouse ports. You plug the wireless base station into the keyboard or mouse
port (or both), and then you can use the wireless keyboard and mouse.
The printer port
It should be no surprise that the computer’s printer can plug into the printer
port. But you probably didn’t know that the port was originally called the
LPT port. LPT was an IBM acronym-thing for Line Printer. It may also be
called a PRN port, which is how the word printer looks when your computer’s
keyboard is broken.
84
Part II: Computer Guts 

I highly recommend using the USB connector (covered later in this chapter),
rather than the traditional printer port and printer cable, to connect your
PC’s console to a printer. It’s just better.
In the old days, you could use the printer port to add an external device to
the computer, scanner, or disk drive. The device was daisy-chained on the
printer port, as illustrated in Figure 7-1. This technique is no longer neces-
sary; it’s easier and better to use the USB port to add an external device to
the console.

Chapter 7: The Basic Ports
The magical KVM switch
KVM is an acronym for keyboard, video, and
mouse. The KVM switch is a box you can use to
attach a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse to
two (or more ) computers. That way, you can
use two computers without having to buy each
one its own keyboard, monitor, or mouse. Often,
people use the KVM switch so that they can use
their current computer as well as access an
older computer or second computer system.
Alas, there’s no inverse-KVM switch, or a
device that lets a single computer have two key-
boards, monitors, and mice attached so that two
people can use a single computer at the same
time. That is possible with the Linux and Unix
operating systems, but not with Windows.

Folks with two computers often use something called an A-B switch to share
a single printer between those two computers. A-B switches are still available
today, though the better solution is to network the computers and the printer,
which also works better in sharing a high-speed Internet connection. See 
Part III of this book for the details.
The serial port
The original PC’s serial port was at one time the versatile port. Unlike with
the other legacy ports, you could plug in a variety of devices to the serial
port: printer, mouse, modem, and scanner, for example. That function has
been taken over by the faster and easier-to-use USB port, which is covered
starting in the next section.
 The serial port is also known as the COM or COM1 port. Some old-timers
may call it the RS-232C port.
 Modern serial ports use a 9-pin connector, though some serial devices
may use the older 25-pin connector. If so, you need to buy a 9-to-25 con-
verter, either a tiny box-like gizmo or a 9-to-25 pin cable.
 Serial ports are used with dial-up modems. High-speed modems — cable,
DSL, and satellite — plug into the PC’s network adapter. See Part III of
this book.
King USB
The most versatile port on your PC is the USB, where the U stands for univer-
sal and means that this port can be used to plug in an entire universe of
peripherals, often replacing the function of many other individual ports on
the computer.
The variety of USB devices is legion. Here’s just a sampling of what you can
plug into a USB port: monitors, speakers, joysticks, scanners, digital cameras,
videocameras, Webcams, floppy drives, CD and DVD drives, hard drives, flash
drives, media card readers, networking gizmos, tiny fans, lamps, time
machines — and the list goes on and on. More and more USB devices are
appearing every day.
The best news about USB? It’s easy. Just plug the gizmo in. Often, that’s all
you need to do!
 USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. Say “you S bee.”
 USB ports, as well as USB devices, sport the USB symbol, as shown in
the margin.
86
Part II: Computer Guts 

 Refer to Chapter 2 for information on finding the USB port on your PC’s
console.
 If your PC lacks a USB port, you can buy a USB expansion card. It costs
about $20. Be sure to get a USB 2.0 expansion card. (The reasons are
explained in the nearby sidebar, “USB version number nonsense.”)
Connecting a USB device
One reason the USB port took over the world is that it’s smart. Dumb things
never take over the world. Witness the Tablet PC. But I digress.
Adding a USB device to your computer is easy. Often, all you need to do is
plug it in — and you don’t need to turn off the computer first. When you plug
a USB device into the console, Windows instantly recognizes it and config-
ures the device for you.
Note that in some cases you must install software first before you initially
plug in some USB devices. After that, you can attach and detach the devices
almost at will. There’s one exception, and that goes for USB storage devices,
which is covered in the later section “Removing a USB device.”
Where’s the power cord?
Another advantage of USB is that many types of USB devices don’t require a
separate power cord. Instead, they use the power supplied by the USB ports
themselves. These are known as USB-powered devices.
87
Chapter 7: The Basic Ports
USB version number nonsense
Two versions of USB are available: the current,
fastest version of USB 2.0, which includes the
High Speed USB standard and the older version,
USB 1.1. Most newer PCs have the USB 2.0
standard, which means that they can handle all
USB devices, whether they’re the older 1.1 type
or the newer High Speed USB type.
Older PCs may have only the USB 1.1 type,
which means that some USB disk drives may
not work on those systems. You know instantly
when this happens because Windows pops up
an error message stating that it’s unable to read
the USB 2.0, or High Speed USB, gizmo. The
solution? Go out and buy your PC a USB 2.0
expansion card.

Some folks find it uncomfortable that USB-powered devices lack an on-off
switch. That’s okay; it’s fine to leave the device on, as long as you keep the
computer on. But, if you really, really want to turn the gizmo off, simply
unplug the USB cable.
 USB devices that require lots of power, such as printers and certain
external disk drives, also have their own power cords.
 USB gadgets that require power may insist on being plugged into a USB-
powered hub. That means the USB connection must be made either
directly to the computer itself or to a USB hub that supplies power. See
the section “Expanding the USB universe,” later in this chapter, for infor-
mation on powered versus unpowered hubs.
Removing a USB device
This is cinchy: To remove a USB device, just unplug it. That’s it! Well, unless
that device is a disk drive of sorts. In that case, you must officially unmount
the drive before you unplug it.
Why bother? Because some program may be using the drive. If you yank out
the drive while the computer is busy writing information to it, you lose not
only the file being updated or created, but also possibly other information on
the drive. Therefore, you should always be sure that you properly unmount
the drive. Here’s how:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
Or, somehow display the contents of the My Computer window.
2. Locate the category heading Devices with Removable Storage.
Choose View➪Arrange Icons by➪Show in Groups if you cannot find the
Devices with Removable Storage area.
3. Click to select the removable disk.
In many cases, the disk has a generic icon associated with it, though
some USB gizmos may sport a unique icon.
4. Choose File➪Eject from the menu.
5. Unplug or detach the USB disk drive.
Note that the icon may not disappear from the My Computer window until
the device is detached.
If you see an error message, the disk drive is either busy or being used. You
have to wait and try again. If the error is persistent, you should turn off the
computer. Detach the device. Then restart the computer.
88
Part II: Computer Guts 

A shortcut method of unmounting a USB disk drive is to find the Safely
Remove Hardware icon on the system tray. When you click that icon, a pop-
up list of removable disk drives appears. Choose your drive from the list, and
Windows attempts to unmount that drive. A pop-up bubble appears and tells
you that the drive can be safely removed upon success.
 Always properly remove your USB disk drives!
 USB disk drives include those flash memory drives, such as jump drives
or keychain USB disk drives. Digital camera media cards are also
included in the lot.
 I recommend plugging any external disk drives on your PC into the UPS.
That way, Windows doesn’t complain when the power goes out and the
external disk drive suddenly becomes unavailable.
Expanding the USB universe
There never seems to be enough USB ports when you need them. Fortunately,
when you need more USB ports, you can quickly add them by plugging a USB
hub into your computer system.
A USB hub allows you to greatly expand your PC’s USB universe. A typical
expansion hub, as shown in Figure 7-2, connects to your PC’s USB port. But
then it turns around and instantly provides even more USB ports for those
devices that need them.

Chapter 7: The Basic Ports

 If one hub isn’t enough, buy another! You can connect hubs to hubs, if
you like. As long as the cables fan out from the PC and nothing loops
back on itself, it all works.
 Using hubs, you can expand your PC’s USB universe to the maximum
127 USB devices. You’ll probably run out of desk space before that.
 Note that some USB devices prefer to be plugged directly into the con-
sole. These types of devices say so on their boxes and in the manuals.
 A hub that also plugs into the wall socket is known as a powered USB
hub. (The console is also a powered USB hub.) This type of hub is neces-
sary for some USB devices to operate.
 An example of an unpowered hub is a keyboard that has USB ports on it.
Those ports are designed to connect non-USB powered devices, such
as mice.
 The first hub (your PC) is the root hub.
IEEE, or the Port of Many Names
A second type of versatile port is called IEEE 1394, but it’s more commonly
known by the frightening moniker FireWire. It may even have other names, or
even new names by the time this book goes to print. One thing is for certain:
You say “Eye triple E” not “Ieeeee!” as in “My pants are on fire!”
IEEE and USB 2.0 are very similar. Both are high-speed ports. Both allow you
to expand your computer. Both can be used to add disk drives or high-speed
scanners. Both can be plugged in and unplugged without having to turn the
PC on or off. Both have hubs you can use to expand the system.
On the PC, the IEEE is best used for digital video. If you have a videocamera
with a mini-DV connection, often labeled DV on the camera, IEEE is the best
way to get that video information into your PC. Beyond that situation, any-
thing IEEE can do, you’re better off doing with USB on a PC.
The only sad news is that most PCs don’t come with an IEEE port standard.
Even so, you can easily add IEEE ports to your computer by installing an inex-
pensive expansion card. Even then, why bother? For now, USB is just a better
option.
 Even if you don’t have IEEE, most digital videocameras have a sec-
ondary USB connection that works just fine.
 IEEE uses its own, unique cables, which aren’t the same as USB cables.
90
Part II: Computer Guts 

 If an external disk drive has two IEEE connectors, you can use either
one. The second connector allows you to daisy-chain on a second IEEE
device.
 Both ends of the standard IEEE cable are the same. But for digital video,
you need an IEEE cable with one standard end and one DV end.
 Some IEEE ports are marked by the FireWire symbol, as shown in the
margin.
 Unlike USB cables, IEEE cables are quite expensive. Maybe that’s when
you pronounce it “Ieeeee”?
 Another term for IEEE is I-Link. Officially, the standard is known as the
High Performance Serial Bus.

o disk drives spin because they’re happy? Computer scientists tell us
that happiness could be a reason, though it’s probably more logical to
assume that the tiny motor inside the disk drive is responsible for all the
spinning. I’m still up in the air about it. What I do know is that disk drives are
an important component of your computer system. No PC is sold without at
least one type of disk drive, and most often two or three types. What those
types are and other hardware aspects of your PC’s disk drives are covered in
this chapter.
The Big Spinning Deal with Disk Drives
Disk drives are necessary in a computer system, to provide for long-term
storage. Information saved on a disk drive stays there, even when the com-
puter’s power is off.
 The drive is the device that reads the disk. The term disk drive is often
used to describe only the drive.
 The disk is the thing that contains the data — the media inside the drive.
 Refer to Chapter 1 for more information on how disk drives are neces-
sary to a computer system.

No, you don’t have to read 
this disk drive history
Sometimes, it makes no sense why the PC needs to have three (or more) dif-
ferent types of disk drives. Wouldn’t just one do? Perhaps. But things may
make sense to you after reviewing this wee bit of personal computer history.
Once, there were these two caveman, Og and Gronk. Now fast-forward to the
late 1970s, during the dawn of the personal computer age. Back then, perma-
nent storage for a personal computer was provided by cassette tape.
I’m serious: cassette tape. You can stop laughing now.
Cassette tape was slow, awkward, and unreliable, but cassette recorders were
far cheaper than those early monster floppy disk drives. And those floppy
drives were way, way cheaper than the hulking primitive hard drives of the era.
Eventually, the price of floppy disk drives dropped from about $800 a unit
to $100. Hard drives dropped in price as well, while increasing in capacity.
Things weren’t cheap, but ample storage was available for most PC users.
At the time of the first IBM PC, floppy drives were standard in personal com-
puters. Hard drives were rare. In fact, it was the second-generation IBM PC,
the IBM PC/XT computer, that came with a hard drive in addition to a floppy
drive. The hard drive held a whopping 10MB of data.
In the early 1990s, another type of disk drive joined the floppy and hard drives
on personal computers. The CD-ROM drive was used to read data CDs, just as
a musical CD player tooted out musical CDs. The CD, or compact disc, pro-
vided computer users with reliable, removable, high-capacity data storage —
but the storage was “read only,” which means that it wasn’t possible to create
your own CD.
Eventually, the high-capacity DVD drive joined the CD drive. About that time,
around the year 2000, computer CD and DVD drives could create those disks
as well as read their data.
The most recent development isn’t a disk drive at all. Flash memory drives
are all solid state — no moving parts. They’re found primarily in digital cam-
eras, though they can be used on PCs for backup storage or to help move
large files between PCs.
94
Part II: Computer Guts 

Over the years, there were other disk standards as well. Some of these pro-
vided stopgap measures, until more practical or inexpensive solutions came
around. Of all the types of disk drives, the ones that survived and are still in
use now are the floppy drive, hard drive, CD or DVD drive, and flash memory
drive.
Typical disk drives found in a PC
Of the entire dang doodle history of long-term, permanent storage, the follow-
ing rabble are most likely to be the common disk drives found in a standard PC:
 Floppy drives: A floppy drive eats floppy disks, which, sadly, store only a
puny 1.44MB of information. That was enough space 10 years ago. Now,
it’s useless, which is why floppy drives are being phased out of the PC’s
design.
 Hard drives: The PC’s primary long-term storage device is the hard
drive. This drive stores many gigabytes of information, more than enough
for Windows, your software, and all the data you can create and take
from the Internet. Unlike other types of drives, the hard drive cannot be
removed from the computer.
 CD/DVD, or “shiny media,” drives: These drives can eat computer data
discs and music CDs or videos. Some drives can only read the discs.
Other drives can read and write to the discs. Sometimes the CD and DVD
drives are separate, and sometimes they’re included as the same unit.
If your PC is typical, it should have one of each: floppy drive, hard drive, and
CD or DVD drive. Sometimes, you may find a single CD drive, sometimes you
may see both a CD and a separate DVD drive, or you may have a CD/DVD
combo.
Though flash memory drives are popular, they aren’t readily sold with PCs
today. A few models sport them, but mostly you need to buy a special adapter
or reader, which is covered later in this chapter.
No matter what, all disk drives of all types that are connected to your com-
puter show their smiling icon faces in the My Computer window, as shown in
Figure 8-1. To see that window, open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
(Refer to Chapter 5.)
95
Chapter 8: Disk Drives Me Crazy

Ask Mr. Science: How Does 
a Disk Drive Work?
Glad you asked, Billy!
Disk drives have two parts: the disk, where information is recorded, and the
drive, which spins the disk. The drive also contains hardware that controls
how information is read from and written to the disk.
In a hard drive, the actual disk is a chunk of metal coated with magnetic
oxide — the same stuff used to record on cassette tape or videotape. The
magnetic oxide stores electronic impulses by orienting its magnetic particles
in one direction or another.
Most hard drives contain multiple disks, or platters, as shown in Figure 8-2.
They’re all hermetically sealed — in an airtight environment. That way, the
hard drive can be extra precise without having to worry about contaminants
or nasty particles in the air.
Rather than magnetic oxide, CD and DVD drives use a thin, metal foil sand-
wiched between two plastic disks. The metal has tiny pits in it, which are
detected by a laser beam.
Figure 8-1:
Your PC’s
assortment

flavors.
96
Part II: Computer Guts 

It’s the drive’s job to spin the disk, which allows the information on the disk
to be read, or information to be written, to the disk. On a hard drive, reading
and writing are done by a doohickey called the read-write head. CD and DVD
drives use a laser beam to read information. To create a CD or DVD, a sec-
ondary and more powerful laser is used to burn tiny pits into the recordable
disc’s surface.
The final part of the disk drive is the interface, or wires through which infor-
mation is sent to and from the computer’s motherboard and the microproces-
sor. On a PC, the ATAPI interface is used inside the console. External disk
drives use another interface — typically, USB. (Refer to Chapter 7.)
 ATAPI stands for AT Attachment Packet Interface, as though that clears
up anything. You lose no points if you fail to remember that term.
 Floppy disks use Mylar for their disk material, also coated with magnetic

chip instead. See the section “This Just In: Flash Memory Drives,” at the

Disk Drive ABCs
Each disk in your PC’s system is assigned a letter of the alphabet. This is how
Windows recognizes the disk. It doesn’t say “The CD drive.” No, Windows
knows a drive by a letter of the alphabet, such as D or E or something else.

Chapter 8: Disk Drives Me Crazy

Windows uses the letters A through Z to identify disks in your computer
system. This system is remarkably similar to the letters in our own, English
alphabet.
On just about every PC, the first three letters are consistently assigned:
 Drive A is always the computer’s floppy drive.
 Drive B isn’t used. It was historically the PC’s second floppy drive, but
letter B is just skipped over.
 Drive C is always the computer’s primary hard drive, the one from which
Windows was started.
After drive C, the drive letters can be wildly inconsistent from PC to PC.
Typically, drive D is the CD or DVD drive, but that’s not always the case.
Here’s the twisted logic Windows uses to assign drive letters after C:
 If any additional hard drives are in the console, they’re given drive letters
D, E, and onward, one letter for each extra hard drive beyond drive C.
 Any internal CD or DVD drive is given the next drive letter after the last
hard drive has been given a letter. So, if the only hard drive is C, the CD
drive gets drive D. If the last hard drive is drive F, the CD drive gets G.
And, if there’s a separate DVD drive, it gets the next letter.
 The order in which drive letters are given to the CD or DVD drives
depends on the order in which the computer finds the drives when the
computer starts up.
 Yes, sometimes Windows gets confused and may assign a letter to your
CD drive before assigning a letter to an internal hard drive. Don’t ask
me why.
 Any external disk drives are given letters as the system finds them when
the computer starts up. Each disk drive is given the next letter in the
alphabet.
 After the computer starts adding any disk drive, such as plugging in a
USB flash memory drive, it results in that drive being given the next
letter in the alphabet.
Disk drives on the network can be added to your computer system. When
you add the drive, however, you get to choose which drive letter it uses, from
any of the available (unused) drive letters.
98
Part II: Computer Guts 

 Because each PC assigns disk drive letters differently, never assume that
you know which letters belong to which drive when you use a new com-
puter. For example, the CD drive isn’t always drive letter D. That’s why
installation manuals are often vague about which disk drive to insert the
CD into.
 Make a note of your PC’s disk drive assignments on this book’s Cheat
Sheet.
The Little You Need to Know
about Floppy Disks
There’s no reason for you to use floppy disks with a PC any more. They’re too
pathetic to hold data and, generally, are way too unreliable for me to recom-
mend them for backups or anything else.
 If you’re using a floppy disk with your computer, consider buying a flash
disk drive and memory card reader instead. See the sections on flash
disk drives later in this chapter.
 If your computer has a floppy disk, then it’s always drive A.
 The floppy drive uses a specific icon in Windows, as shown in the
margin.
 The only time I’ve seen floppy disks used is to create a restore disk for
antivirus or backup software. In instances like that, follow the instruc-
tions on the screen or in the manual, and they tell you what to do.
Remember that creating the floppy disk is optional. Hopefully, those 
program writers will think of some other way to do their stuff and not
use floppy disks any more.
 This book’s companion, PCs For Dummies Quick Reference (from the
Wiley Publishing empire), contains more information on floppy disks, if
you really need to know.
Driving a Hard Disk
The hard disk is the primary place for storing stuff on your computer. It’s
your main source of permanent storage. On nearly every PC, the hard drive is
given letter C and referred to as “drive C” or “the C drive.”
99
Chapter 8: Disk Drives Me Crazy

Hard drives are measured by how much information they can store. This
value is specified in gigabytes, or billions of bytes, and abbreviated GB. (See
Chapter 9 for more information on what a byte is.)
The typical PC hard drive stores anywhere from 20GB to 100GB of informa-
tion, which is plenty of storage for Windows and many other programs, and
lots of room for you to lose your stuff.
Hard drives use the hard drive icon (as shown in the margin) inside
Windows.
 The hard drive is where Windows lives, where you install software, and
where you keep the stuff you create or save on your computer. That’s
what the hard drive is designed for.
 Most PCs have one physical hard drive installed inside the console.
 Extra hard drives can be added to your PC, to give you even more stor-
age. You can generally add a second internal hard drive to the console,
plus nearly unlimited external hard drives via the USB port.

Part II: Computer Guts 
Which disk is the boot disk?
The boot disk is the disk drive that contains the
computer’s operating system, or the software
that controls the hardware. Normally, when a
PC starts, it looks for the operating system first
on the floppy drive and then on the hard drive.
The PC looks on the floppy drive for historical
reasons: The original IBM PC didn’t have a hard
drive, and the thing was started by using a
floppy disk. The computer still does that and, in
fact, if you neglect to remove a floppy disk from
drive A, the computer displays an error mes-
sage as it fails to find software on that startup
disk. (Remove the floppy disk and press Enter to
fix that problem.)
The PC can also boot, or start itself, from the
CD-ROM. That’s normally done to run disaster
recovery software. Some PCs may prompt you
to “boot from the CD-ROM” if you leave a
startup CD (or bootable CD) in the CD-ROM
drive when the computer starts. If so, answer
the prompt or just ignore it so that the computer
continues to load software from the hard drive.
You can control which disk drives are used to
start, or boot, the PC by using the PC Setup pro-
gram. When the computer first starts, read the
screen and press the keys that are indicated to
enter the PC Setup program. On one of that pro-
gram’s menus, you can tell the computer which
disk (or disks) to use to start the PC.

 A single physical hard drive can be divided into multiple logical hard
drives. This division is done by partitioning the drive. For example, to
Windows, a single 100GB hard drive could be two 50GB logical disk
drives, C and D. Partitioning is not a beginner’s duty, and it’s generally
done only when installing a new hard drive or setting up a secondary
hard drive.
CD and DVD Kissin’ Disk Drive Cousins
Your PC has at least a CD drive. It may also have a separate DVD drive. Or, as
is most common recently, the computer has a combination drive that eats
both CD and DVDs. Both drives are similar in many ways.
The typical CD or DVD drive is read-only. That term means that information
can only be read from the disc; you cannot use the read-only drive to create a
CD or DVD. You may find the drives labeled by using the acronym ROM, where
the RO stands for Read-Only. (The M is for memory, but it should really be S,
for storage.)
CDs are used in the PC world for installing new programs on your computer.
CDs may also simply contain lots of data, such as the Encarta Encyclopedia.
DVDs are similar, though they store many times the amount of information
as CDs. Even so, most new software comes on CDs rather than on DVDs.
The computer’s CD and DVD drive can also be used to play musical CDs or
watch movies on your computer — though I’m certain that this is not the real
reason that you bought a PC in the first place.
 The CD-ROM drive reads both computer and musical CDs.
 The DVD drive reads both computer and video DVDs.
 You can also call it a DVD-ROM drive, though no one important uses
that term.
 A single DVD drive can read both DVDs and CDs. So, if all you have on
your computer is a DVD drive, it’s really a DVD/CD drive.
 CD stands for compact disc. The British spelling is used for historical
reasons, mainly that Shakespeare is rumored to have burned his first
folio to a CD.
 DVD is an acronym for digital versatile disc. Or, it may be digital video disc.
 Both CD and DVD drives use similar icons in Windows. The icon may
change appearance, depending on which type of disk is in the drive.
101
Chapter 8: Disk Drives Me Crazy

 A typical CD holds up to 640MB of information. A typical music CD can
store up to 80 minutes of music.
 DVD technology is now capable of storing 4GB of information on a disc.
Some future versions of DVDs are rumored to be able to hold more than
17GB of information.
CD and DVD drives that create 
CDs and DVDs
Some CD and DVD drives are designed to not only read from the discs but also
create them. The type of CD drive that can create CDs is called CD-R or, often,
CD-R/RW. The letters R and RW represent the two recordable CD formats.
On the DVD side, the drive names get weird because there are many record-
able DVD formats. The two most popular, however, are DVD-R and DVD+R.
Others are listed in the nearby sidebar, “Types of recordable CD and DVDs.”
You need to buy the proper discs to create your own CDs or DVDs. For CDs,
I recommend any CD-R. Avoid CD-RWs because they tend to be expensive
and, often, multiple CD-Rs are better than a single CD-RW. (More on that in
Chapter 24.)
For the DVD, ensure that you buy the proper disc for your drive. If the drive
eats only DVD-Rs, don’t buy DVD+R disks, or vice versa.
 The drive must say CD-R/RW or DVD-R or +R for it to be a recordable
drive. Plain old CD and DVD drives cannot be used to create CDs or DVDs.
 You can get a combination CD/DVD drive that can record to both disk
formats. It’s often called the SuperDrive, though it’s really just a combi-
nation CD-R/RW and DVD-R (or +R) drive. If your PC lacks one of these,
you can easily add an external USB version of the drive.
 Sony makes a versatile DVD drive that can record to multiple DVD for-
mats. It can also record to CDs.
About the speed rating (the X number)
CDs have speed ratings measured in X. The number before the X indicates
how much faster the drive is than the original PC CD-ROM drive (which plays
as fast as a musical CD player). So, a 32X value means that it’s 32 times faster
than the original PC CD-ROM drive.
102
Part II: Computer Guts 

A recordable CD-R/RW drive has three Xs in its rating:
 The first is the drive’s write speed, or how fast a CD-R can be written to.
 The second X is how fast the drive can rewrite to a CD-RW.
 The final X indicates how fast the drive can be read from.
High write and read speeds on a CD drive are especially important if you plan
on importing lots of music discs. The higher the speed, the less time it takes
the computer to read all the music from the drive. (See Chapter 24 for more
information.)
Which drive is which?
Upon inspection, it’s not exactly clear which disk drive could be the CD and
which is the DVD. You have to look closely.
CD drives have the CD logo on them. If it’s a recordable drive, it also has the
word Recordable and maybe even RW.
103
Chapter 8: Disk Drives Me Crazy
Types of recordable CDs and DVDs
Don’t expect to find any sanity behind the vari-
ous recordable CD and DVD disk formats. Here’s
a more or less complete list, with my comments:
CD-R: The disk can be written to once.
Information can be written one little bit at a time
or all at once. For a musical CD, the music can
only be copied over all at once. Note that there
are different types of CD-R discs, one for music
and one for data. Buy the right one!
CD-RW: This disk works just like a CD-R, though
it can be completely erased and used again.
These discs cost more than CD-Rs, and the CD
drive must be capable of working with CD-RW
disks.
DVD-R: The most popular DVD recordable
format, compatible with both computers and
home-movie DVD players.
DVD-RW: An erasable version of the DVD-R
format. As with a CD-RW, these recordable
DVDs can be completely erased and recorded
to again.
DVD+R: The second most popular DVD record-
able format, much faster than DVD-R but not as
compatible.
DVD+RW: The fully erasable version of the
DVD+R format.
You need to buy the proper discs for your drive;
some drives are very specific about which discs
they can write to, though other drives may be
compatible with multiple formats. It should say
so on the box or spool. Also be on the lookout
for DVDs that allow recording on both sides of
the disc. It should say so on the package.

DVD drives have the “DVD” logo on them. If you don’t see the DVD logo, your
PC has a mere CD-ROM drive.
Inserting a CD or DVD
Generally speaking, the disc is always inserted label side up. Aside from that,
how you stick the disc into the drive depends on how the drive eats discs:
Tray type: The most popular type of CD-ROM or DVD drive uses a slide-out
tray to hold the disc. Start by pressing the drive’s eject button, which pops
out the tray (often called a drink holder in many computer jokes). Drop the
disc into the tray, label side up. Gently nudge the tray back into the com-
puter. The tray slides back in the rest of the way on its own.
Slide-in type: Another type of disk drive works like the CD player in most
automobiles; the drive is merely a slot into which you slide the disc: Pushing
the disc (label side up) into the slot causes some gremlin inside the drive to
eventually grab the disc and suck it in all the way. Amazing.
When the disc is in the drive, you use it just like any other disk in your 
computer.
 When you insert the disk upside down (label side down), the drive can’t
read it and most likely simply ejects the disk automatically.
 An exception to the label-side-up rule is a DVD with data recorded on
both sides. For example, some DVD movies have the TV version on one
side and the wide-screen, or letterbox, version on another. If so, make
sure to put the proper side up in the drive.
 Some CDs are clipped. That is, they aren’t round discs, but, rather, are
business card size or some other special shape. These discs work fine in
the tray type of CD-ROM/DVD drive, but don’t insert them into the slide-
in type of drive.
Ejecting a CD or DVD
Follow these steps to eject a disc from the CD-ROM or DVD drive:
1. Open the My Computer window.
2. Click to select the CD-ROM or DVD drive icon.
3. Choose File➪Eject from the menu.
The disc spits from the CD-ROM drive.
104
Part II: Computer Guts 

You may be tempted to eject the disk by punching the eject button on the
front of the drive. Don’t! If Windows is using the drive, you see an ugly error
message on the screen when you try to eject a disc this way.
In times of urgency, such as when the computer is locked up (or turned off),
you can eject a CD or DVD by pushing a bent paper clip into the tiny hole
(the “beauty mark”) on the front of the CD/DVD drive. That action manually
ejects the disc when the computer is too stupid to do it by itself.
This Just In: Flash Memory Drives
Thanks to the versatility of the USB port, flash memory drives have become
popular for the PC. They’re called by many names: jump drive, Flash Drive,
memory stick, SmartMedia, and on and on. They all use the same type of
memory chip, and they all universally plug into a USB port for instant recog-
nition by Windows.
Flash memory drives come in a variety of formats, shapes, and sizes. The
capacity of a flash memory drive depends on how much you pay for it.
Storage ranges from a handful of megabytes (MB) on up to several gigabytes
(GB) of storage — which is great for such a tiny, portable drive.
To use the flash memory drive, just plug it into one of the PC’s USB ports.
Some drives, such as those used in digital cameras, may require a media card
reader, which plugs into the USB port. You then stick the memory card into
the media reader.
The memory card “mounts” itself in the My Computer window, which gives
the drive a drive letter, and instantly you have access to the flash memory
card, just as you do any other disk drive in your computer system.
To eject the drive, refer to Chapter 7, the section “Removing a USB device.”
 Most flash memory drives require USB 2.0. Older PCs may not have this
type of USB port, but you can easily add USB 2.0 via an expansion card.
 Do not remove a flash memory drive while the computer is using it!
 Flash memory works by using a special flash memory chip. The chip
doesn’t require power to maintain its contents, so you can remove a
flash memory drive from the PC and its data stays intact because the
flash memory drive isn’t damaged.

M
emory is one of the computer’s basic resources. The more you have,
the happier the computer seems to be. Not having enough memory is
like trying to put too many people into a bus: It’s cramped, hot, and smelly;
nothing gets done quickly; and you can really tell who had tacos for lunch.
But, when you have enough memory, it’s like swimming in the ocean — with
no jellyfish or sharks. And free tacos. But, I digress. More memory is better.
This chapter tells you why.

What Is Memory?
If your computer were a sport, memory is the field on which competition
would take place. Memory is where the action is.
Software is in charge. It tells the microprocessor what to do. But, the micro-
processor is only a minicalculator. It’s fast, but, like the absent-minded pro-
fessor, the microprocessor doesn’t remember much. It has some storage, but
not a lot.
To provide those Elysian Fields upon which the microprocessor can dance
and play, your computer comes with memory. The microprocessor uses the
memory for storage, but it can also manipulate the contents of memory.
That’s basically how your programs work with data: The data is stored in
memory, and the microprocessor manipulates the contents of memory.
 All computers need memory.
 Memory is to computers as legal pads are to human beings: It’s where
information is jotted down and saved for later.
 The more memory in your PC, the better. With more computer memory,
you can work on larger documents and spreadsheets, enjoy applications
that use graphics and sound, and boast about all that memory to your
friends.
 The term RAM is used interchangeably with the word memory. They’re
the same thing. (In fact, RAM stands for Random Access Memory, in case
you have been working any crossword puzzles lately.)
How computer memory works
Memory in your computer is used for storage — fast and changeable storage
because all memory is accessible by the microprocessor. The software you
run tells the microprocessor how to interact with memory, what to store in
memory, and what to do with the stuff stored in memory.
Whenever you create a document with your word processor, each character
you type is placed in a specific location in memory. After the character is
stored, the microprocessor doesn’t need to access it again, unless you’re
editing, searching or replacing, or doing something active to the text.
After you create something in the PC’s memory, you save it to disk. When you
need to access the information again, it’s opened up and loaded back into
memory from disk. After the information is there, the microprocessor can
again work over it.
108
Part II: Computer Guts 

 Turning off the power makes the contents of memory go bye-bye. The
memory chips themselves aren’t destroyed, but the chips require elec-
tricity in order to maintain their contents.
 Computer memory is fast. The microprocessor can scan millions of
bytes of memory — the equivalent of Shakespeare’s entire folio — in
fractions of a second, which is far less time than it took you to even
trudge through Hamlet in the 11th grade.
 Your disk drives provide long-term storage for information. This type of
storage is necessary because computer memory is lost when the power
is turned off or when you restart Windows.
 When you open a file on disk, the computer copies that information from
disk into the computer’s memory. Only in memory can that information
be examined or changed. When you save information back to disk, the
computer copies it from memory to the disk.
 Always save your stuff to disk. Make it your mantra: “Save! Save! Save!”
Chips off the old block
Memory dwells on the PC’s motherboard, and sits very close to the micro-
processor for fast access and ready dispatch. Memory comes in the form of
tiny chips, called DRAM chips. They’re permanently attached to teensy-
weensy memory expansion cards, called DIMMs.
Figure 9-1 shows what a DIMM looks like, though in real life a DIMM is slightly
smaller than what’s shown in the figure. A DIMM also has chips on both
sides, which is why it’s a DIMM, or Dual Inline Modular Memory thing, and
not a SIMM, or Single Inline Modular Memory thing.
Each DIMM card contains a given chunk of RAM, measured in one of the magi-
cal computer memory values of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 megabytes —
or, perhaps even values of 1, 2, or 4 gigabytes.

Chapter 9: Memories . . . Like a PC Full of RAM

Each of those memory slots that the DIMM cards are plugged into is a bank of
memory. So, a PC with 512MB of RAM may have four banks of 128MB DIMMs
installed or two banks of 256MB DIMMs.
 DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It’s pronounced
“dee-ram,” and it’s the most common type of memory chip installed
in a PC.
 Other types of memory chips exist, each with a name similar to DRAM,
such as EDORAM or NIFTYRAM or DODGERAM. Most of these are merely
marketing terms, designed to make one type of memory sound spiffier
than another.
Here a Byte, There a Byte, 
Everywhere a Byte-Byte
Memory is measured by the byte. A byte can store a single character. For exam-
ple, the word frog is 4 bytes long and requires 4 bytes of computer memory
storage. The word prince is 6 characters long and requires 6 bytes of memory
to store. I would put a joke in here about a toad being 2 bytes away from a
prince, but I’m just not being that clever this afternoon.
Bytes, however useful, are puny. Although the experimental hobby comput-
ers of the 1970s may have had 256 or 1,000 bytes, PCs now have many times
110
Part II: Computer Guts 
Boring details on RAM, ROM, and flash memory
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It
refers to memory that the microprocessor can
read from and write to. When you create some-
thing in memory, it’s done in RAM. RAM is
memory and vice versa.
ROM stands for Read-Only Memory. The micro-
processor can read from ROM, but it cannot
write to it or modify it. ROM is permanent. Often,
ROM chips contain special instructions for the
computer — important stuff that never changes.
For example, the chipset on the motherboard is in
ROM (refer to Chapter 6). Because that informa-
tion is stored on a ROM chip, the microproces-
sor can access it. The instructions are always
there because they’re not erasable.
Flash memory is a special type of memory that
works like both RAM and ROM. Information can
be written to flash memory, like RAM, but it isn’t
erased when the power is off, like RAM. Sadly,
flash memory isn’t as fast as RAM, so don’t
expect it to replace standard computer memory
any time soon.

that amount. So, rather than waste time talking about millions or billions of
bytes, handy abbreviations and swanky computer jargon are used to refer to
a specific quantity of memory, as shown in Table 9-1.

1,099,511,627,776 bytes
Although it’s handy to say “kilobyte” rather than mouth out “1,024 bytes,” it’s
hard to visualize how much data that really is. For comparison, think of a
kilobyte (KB) as about a page of text from a novel. One megabyte (MB) of
information is required in order to store one minute of music on a CD or as
much text information as in a complete encyclopedia.
The gigabyte (GB) is a huge amount of storage — 1 billion bytes. The terabyte
(TB) is 1 trillion bytes, or enough RAM to dim the lights when you start the PC.
A trilobite is an extinct arthropod that flourished in the oceans during the
Paleozoic era. It has nothing to do with computer memory.
Other trivia:
 The term giga is Greek, and it means giant.
 The term tera is also Greek. It means monster!
 A specific location in memory is an address.
 Hard disk storage is also measured in bytes.
 A PC running Windows XP requires at least 256MB of memory in order to
work well.
 A typical hard drive now stores between 40 and 100 gigabytes of data. At
the high end, some hard drives hold 500GB, or nearly half a terabyte of
information. Gadzooks!
 Bytes are composed of 8 bits. The word bit is a contraction of binary
digit. Binary is base 2, or a counting system that uses only ones and
zeroes. Computers count in binary, and their bits are grouped into clus-
ters of eight, for convenient consumption as bytes.

Some Memory Q&A
I can be anywhere — shopping at the grocery store, volunteering at some
civic function, or leaving the local strip bar — and it doesn’t matter where I
am, yet people stop and ask me questions about computer memory. Over the
years, I’ve collected the questions and have distilled the lot into the several
subsections that follow. This section should cover up any loose ends or
random access thoughts you may have about computer memory.
“How much memory is in 
my PC right now?”
This information may be a mystery to you, but it isn’t a secret to your com-
puter. The System Properties dialog box shows you how much memory lives
inside the beast: Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop and
choose Properties from the shortcut menu that appears. The System
Properties dialog box appears (refer to Figure 6-2, over in Chapter 6).
The amount of memory (shown as RAM) appears right beneath the type of
microprocessor that lives in your PC. In Figure 6-2, it says that the computer
has 1.00GB of RAM — plenty. Click the OK button to close the dialog box.
112
Part II: Computer Guts 
Why the magical numbers?
Computer memory comes in given sizes. You
see the same numbers over and over:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096,
and so on.
Each of these values represents a power of
two — a scary mathematical concept that you
probably slept through in high school. To quickly
review: 20 = 1, 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8 and on up to
210 = 1024, and so on, until you get a nosebleed.
These specific values happen because com-
puters count by twos — ones and zeros — the
old binary counting base of song and legend.
So, computer memory, which is a very binary-
like thing, is measured in those same powers of
two. RAM chips come in quantities of 64MB or
256MB, for example, or maybe 2GB.
Notice that, starting with 1024, the values take
on a predictable pattern: 1024 bytes is really 1K;
1024K is really 1M, and 1024M is 1G. So, really,
only the first 10 values, 1 through 512, are the
magical ones.

“Do I have enough memory?”
Not if you forgot that you asked that same question in the preceding edition
of this book.
“Does my PC have enough memory?”
Knowing how much memory is in your PC is one thing, but knowing whether
that amount is enough is entirely different!
The amount of memory your PC needs depends on two things. The first, and
most important, is the memory requirement of your software. Some pro-
grams, such as photo-editing programs, require lots of memory. It says right
on the box how much memory is needed. For example, the Photoshop photo-
editing program demands 192MB of RAM.
To test your PC’s memory, you need to make the computer very busy. You do
this by loading and running several programs simultaneously. I’m talking about
big programs, like Photoshop or Word or Excel. While all those programs are
running, switch between them by pressing the Alt+Esc key combination.
If you can easily switch between several running programs by using Alt+Esc,
your PC most likely has plenty of memory. But, if you press Alt+Esc and the
system slows down, you hear the disk drives rumbling, and it takes a bit of
time for the next program’s window to appear, your PC could use more
memory.
Close any programs you have opened.
 Generally speaking, all PCs should have at least 256MB of RAM, which is
what you need, at minimum, to run Windows XP.
 One sure sign that your PC needs more memory: It slows to a crawl,
especially during memory-intensive operations, such as working with
graphics.
 Not enough memory? You can upgrade! See the section “Adding More
Memory to Your PC,” at the end of this chapter.
“Will the computer ever 
run out of memory?”
Nope. Unlike the hard drive, which can fill up just like a closet full of shoes
and hats, your PC’s memory can never really get full. At one time, back in the
113
Chapter 9: Memories . . . Like a PC Full of RAM

dark ages of computing, the “Memory full” error was common. That doesn’t
happen now, thanks to something called virtual memory.
“What is virtual memory?”
Windows uses a clever technique to prevent your computer’s memory from
ever becoming full: It creates virtual memory.
Virtual memory is a fake-out. It lets the computer pretend that it has much
more memory than it has physical RAM. It does that by swapping out vast
chunks of memory to the hard drive. Because Windows manages both
memory and hard drive storage, it can keep track of things quite well, by
swapping chunks of data back and forth. Et, voilà! You never see an “Out of
memory” error.
Alas, there’s trouble in paradise. One problem with virtual memory is that
the swapping action slows things down. Although it can happen quickly and
often without your noticing, when memory gets tight, virtual memory takes
over and things start moving more slowly.
 The solution to avoiding the use of virtual memory is to pack your PC
with as much RAM as it can hold.
 Windows never says that it’s “out of memory.” No, you just notice that
the hard drive is churning frequently as the memory is swapped into
and out of the disk drive. Oh, and things tend to slow down dramatically.
 You have no reason to mess with the virtual memory settings in your
computer. Windows XP does an excellent job of managing things for you.
“What is video memory?”
Memory used by your PC’s video system is known as video memory.
Specifically, memory chips live on the video adapter card. Those memory
chips are used specifically for the computer’s video output and help you see
higher resolutions, more colors, 3-D graphics, bigger and uglier aliens, and
girlie pictures that your husband downloads from the Internet late at night
but says that he doesn’t.
As with regular computer memory, you can upgrade video memory if your PC’s
video card has room. See Chapter 10 for more information on video adapters.
Shared video memory is used on some low-end computers to save money.
What happens is that the computer lacks true video memory, but instead
borrows some main memory for use in displaying graphics. This is fine for
simple home computers, but not nearly good enough to play cutting-edge
games or to use photo-editing software.

Adding More Memory to Your PC
The best thing you can do for your PC is to add more memory. It’s like adding
Geritol to your computer’s tired blood. Bam! More memory provides an instant
boost to the system.
Adding memory to your computer is LEGO-block simple. The only difference
is that the typical LEGO block set, such as the Medieval Castle or Rescue
Helicopter set, costs less than $100. Your computer, on the other hand, may
cost 5 to 20 times that much. Adding memory isn’t something to be taken
lightly.
Upgrading memory involves five intricate and tedious steps:
1. Figure out how much total memory you need.
Your PC should have at least 256MB, which is enough to run Windows
XP. After that, you can upgrade the RAM to 512MB, 1,024MB, 1GB, 2GB of
RAM — or more!
2. Figure out how much memory you can install.
This step is technical. It involves knowing how memory is added to your
computer and in what increments. If you have an empty bank of memory,
this step is quite simple. But, if your PC doesn’t have any empty memory
banks, it can be complex — and expensive. Better leave this task to your
dealer or computer guru.
3. Buy the memory.
Don’t get cheap on me! You may think that you’re prudent for saving
money, but cheap memory is bad memory.
4. Pay someone else to plug in the chips and do the upgrade.
Oh, you can do it yourself, but I would pay someone else to do it.
5. Gloat.
After you have the memory, brag to your friends about it. Heck, it used to 
be impressive to say that you had 640K of RAM. Then came the “I have 4
megabytes of memory in my 386” or “I’m swimming in 8 megabytes of
memory in my 486.” Now? Anything less than 256MB and your kids roll 
their eyes at you.
Now, for a shocker: You may think that upgrading from 512MB to 1GB RAM
requires the addition of only 512MB of more memory. Wrong! It all depends
on how the memory is now configured on the motherboard, as shown in
Figure 9-2.

Part II: Computer Guts 

Suppose that your PC has four memory slots and each has only a 128MB
DIMM in it. Therefore, to upgrade, you have to ditch all those DIMMs and buy
either four 256MB DIMMS (the cheapest option) or two 512MB DIMMS (the
next cheapest) or one single 1GB DIMM (the most expensive option, but the
most logical for future expansion).
 Before you buy memory, check to see how the memory is configured on
the motherboard. Open memory banks are a good thing.
 My favorite place to get memory chips online is Crucial, at www.crucial.
com. The Web site asks a series of questions and then provides memory
solutions to solve your problems exactly.
 If you want to try upgrading memory yourself, go ahead. I know that
Crucial, as an example, provides a well-written booklet for doing the
upgrade as part of the memory it sells. When in doubt, however, I
strongly recommend having someone else do it.

I
t may look like a TV, but it’s really called the monitor, and it’s the main
gizmo through which the computer communicates with you, the human.
In a way, the monitor is really the computer’s face. Its gentle and quizzical
expressions tell you how the computer is doing, and it presents you with the
information you requested or shows you the stuff you’re working on. When
you get angry, the monitor also makes a great target.
This chapter helps you to understand what the computer monitor is, how it
works, how to adjust things, and how to speak about the monitor in intelli-
gent terms — or, really, anything other than “That TV Thing.”
Some Terms to Know
Computer jargon is infamous and confusing enough, but monitors seem to be
a special case. That’s because three terms are used to describe similar things:
monitor, screen, and display. Fortunately, they aren’t complex technical terms,
though it’s still easy to confuse them:
 The monitor is the box.
 The screen is the part of the monitor on which information is displayed.
 The display is the information that appears on the screen.

Sadly, most people use these terms interchangeably, as in “My screen says
that the computer doesn’t like me” or “My monitor says that the computer
doesn’t like me” or even “The display is showing how much the computer
doesn’t like me.” They all describe the same thing: that the computer loathes
your presence.
Your PC’s Graphics System
The monitor may get all the attention, but it’s really only the visible half of
what I call your Computer’s Graphics System. It has two components:
 The monitor
 The graphics adapter
The monitor is the dumb part. All it does is display information. The monitor
lives outside the console, so it gets more attention than the true brains of the
operation, the graphics adapter.
It’s the graphics adapter that tells the monitor what to display and where,
plus how many colors to use and the overall resolution of the image. It’s the
graphics adapter that determines your PC’s graphics potential.
Figure 10-1 illustrates the monitor/adapter relationship. The graphics adapter
can be a separate expansion card, as shown in the figure, or its circuitry can
be part of the chipset on the motherboard. A cable then connects the moni-
tor to the console. The monitor, of course, plugs into the wall for power.
120
Part II: Computer Guts 
Aren’t there supposed to be USB monitors?
One feature of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) is
that it can be used to attach a monitor to your
computer, effectively replacing the graphics
adapter. Although it’s something that the USB port
is capable of doing, the reality is that the USB
standard is too slow and performance suffers.
Although USB monitors seem to be in the same
league with Bigfoot and true tax reform, a USB
gizmo lets you attach an external monitor to
your laptop. The gizmo plugs into the USB port
and then allows you to plug a PC monitor into
the gizmo’s standard monitor connector. Sadly,
this is not a USB monitor solution — it’s just a
trick for using two monitors (or a video projec-
tor) on a laptop.

 Your PC needs both a monitor and a graphics adapter.
 The graphics adapter is also known as a video card.
 If your PC has more than one monitor (and it can, you know), it must
have one graphics adapter for each monitor or a special graphics adapter
that supports multiple monitors. (The dual-monitor thing is possible only
with Windows XP Pro.)
Two types of monitors: LCD and CRT
PC monitors come in two different flavors, each of which is known by a popu-
lar TLA (three-letter acronym): LCD and CRT.
 The CRT monitor is the traditional, glass-screen, television-set-like 
monitor.
 The LCD monitor is the newer, flatter type of computer screen.
Between the two, the LCD monitor is better, though it’s more expensive.
Traditional CRT monitors are quite cheap, but they are heavier and bulkier
and use more electricity, and they’re harder on the eyes than LCD monitors. 
If you have a choice, get an LCD monitor.

Chapter 10: Minding Your Monitors

There are two exceptions where a CRT monitor is better. The first comes with
computer graphics. A CRT monitor is better able to emulate true colors than
an LCD. The second exception is computer games, where CRT monitors dis-
play the images faster than an LCD.
 CRT stands for cathode ray tube. Note that it’s cathode ray tube, not
catholic ray tube.
 LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It isn’t a hallucinogenic.
 Be aware that some CRT monitors are advertised as “flat screen.” This
term isn’t misleading: The glass on the front of the monitor is indeed
flat, and it provides a better viewing surface than the traditional convex
glass. But it’s not an LCD monitor.
 All LCD monitors are flat.
Glorious graphics adapters
The most important half of the computer’s graphics system is the graphics
hardware itself, known as the graphics adapter. It’s the circuitry that runs the
monitor and controls the image that the monitor displays.
Graphics adapters come in various price ranges and have features for artists,
game players, computer designers, and regular Joes like you and me and
guys named Joe. You should look for three key things in a graphics adapter:
 The amount of memory
 Whether it has a GPU
 The type of adapter
PC graphics require special memory that’s separate from the computer’s
main memory. This memory is known as video RAM, or, often, VRAM. The
more memory, the more colors and high resolutions and fancier tricks the
graphics adapter is capable of.
Graphics adapters can have from 0M (no memory) up to 512MB and beyond.
In the case of graphics adapters, more isn’t necessarily better. Only if your
applications demand more memory, or can take advantage of the extra video
memory, is the price worth it. Otherwise, a typical PC has between 16MB and
128MB of video RAM.
Those 0MB graphics adapters “share” video memory with main memory.
Obviously, for anyone interested in playing games or creating computer
graphics, it’s a bad deal.
122
Part II: Computer Guts 

Another measure of a graphics adapter’s muscle is whether it has its own
microprocessor, or graphics processing unit (GPU). That microprocessor is
specially geared toward graphical operations, and, by having it, the graphics
adapter takes a load of work away from the PC’s main microprocessor and
things really fly on the screen.
Finally, there’s the way the graphics adapter plugs into the motherboard. The
best models use the AGP port, which gives them direct access to the micro-
processor and system memory. Low-end graphics adapters are often included
with a PC’s chipset. Even so, it’s possible to install a better graphics adapter
and use the PC Setup program to disable the cheesy adapter that’s built into
the motherboard.
 The more memory the graphics adapter has, the higher the resolutions
it can support and the more colors it can display at those higher 
resolutions.
 Two popular models of GPUs are available: the Radeon and the GeForce.
Both are approximately equal in power and popularity.
 Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on the AGP expansion slot.
 Many graphics adapters are advertised as supporting 3-D graphics.
That’s okay, but they work only if your software supports the particular
3-D graphics offered by that graphics adapter. (If so, the side of the soft-
ware box should say so.)
 If your PC has a DVD drive, you need a graphics adapter capable of pro-
ducing the DVD image on the monitor. A graphics adapter typically has
an S-Video Out port on it, which lets you connect a TV to the computer
for watching things on a larger screen.
 Graphics adapters were once known by various acronyms in the PC
world. The most popular acronym was VGA, which stands for Video
Gate Array (not Video Graphics Adapter, as is commonly believed).
Other acronyms exist, with some incorporating VGA into their alphabet
soup. The names are primarily for marketing reasons and have no signif-
icance for PCs in general.
Getting to Know and Love Your Monitor
A PC’s monitor is really a peripheral. It’s separate from the console. In fact,
you don’t need to have the same brand of computer and monitor. You can
mix and match. You can even keep your old PC’s monitor with a new console
you may buy — as long as the monitor is in good shape, why not?
Despite all the features and technical mumbo-jumbo, all monitors serve the
same function: They display information that the computer coughs up.
123
Chapter 10: Minding Your Monitors

The physical description
Each monitor has two tails (refer to Figure 10-1). One is a power cord that
plugs into the wall. The second tail is a video cable that connects to the
graphics adapter port on the back of the console. The graphics adapter port
is also known as the VGA port.
You usually find the monitor’s on–off button on the front of the monitor, most
likely near the lower-right corner or maybe on the monitor’s right side. (It’s a
total bias against left-handed people, and part of the larger adroit conspiracy.)
Additional buttons adorn the front of the monitor, which you use to control
the monitor’s display. These buttons may be visible, like a row of ugly teeth,
or they may be hidden behind a panel. The section “Adjusting the monitor’s
display,” later in this chapter, discusses what they do.
Some monitors display a message when the monitor is turned on and the PC
is not (or the monitor isn’t receiving a signal from the PC). The message may
read No Signal or something like that, or it may urge you to check the con-
nection. That’s okay. The monitor pops to life properly when you turn on the
console and it receives a video signal.
All the technical information 
you need to know
Lots of technical nonsense is used to describe a monitor’s abilities. Of that
pile of jargon, only the following terms are really necessary:
 Size: Monitors are judged by their picture size, measured on a diagonal,
just like TVs. Common sizes for PC monitors are 15, 17, 19, and 21
inches. The most common size is 17 inches, though I love the 19-inch
monitors and absolutely swoon over the 21-inch monsters! Oooooooo!
(That’s me swooning.)
 Dot pitch: This term refers to the distance between each dot, or pixel,
on the screen (as measured from the center of each pixel). The closer
the dots, and the tinier the dot pitch value, the finer the image.
 Interlace/non-interlacing: You want a monitor that’s non-interlacing,
which means that the image appears on the monitor in one swipe rather
than two. An interlacing monitor flickers, which makes your eyeballs
go nuts.
Other aspects of the display — such as resolution, colors, and video
memory — are all part of the graphics adapter hardware, not the monitor.
These terms are covered elsewhere in this chapter.
124
Part II: Computer Guts 

Oh, and other terms, ugly and verbose, are used to describe a monitor. Most
of them are marketing terms, which don’t do you any good after you own the
monitor.
Adjusting the monitor’s display
In the early days, you were lucky if your PC’s monitor had contrast and
brightness knobs. The adjustments you can make to your monitor now are
endless. Sometimes, you make adjustments using a row of buttons that adorn
the front of your monitor and look almost like a second keyboard. At other
times, you use a combination of generic buttons, similar to the annoying way
digital clocks are set.
Generally, the buttons on your monitor are of two types. The first type has a
menu button and then two or four control buttons adorned with arrows or
plus and minus symbols. Pressing the menu button pops up an onscreen dis-
play, such as the one shown in Figure 10-2. You use the buttons on the monitor
(up, down, plus, and minus) to manipulate the menu and adjust the monitor.
The second type, often hidden behind a flap or door, has specific buttons
with icons that adjust specific things, as shown in Figure 10-3. The idea is to
use these buttons to adjust what the icons represent. Sometimes, you have to
press more than one button to make a specific adjustment.

 This is one area of the PC that I really wish they would standardize.
 The onscreen information appears over any other image displayed on
the monitor. Don’t let it freak you out.
 Use the buttons to adjust the image size to make full use of the monitor’s
display area.
 Monitors may also display frequency information (31 kHz/60 Hz, for
example) when they change screen modes, such as when you play a
game and the screen changes to another resolution.
 Most monitors also have a Save or Store button, which remembers the
settings you have entered and makes them permanent. Use it.
Adjusting the Display in Windows
The graphics adapter controls the monitor, and software rules over the
graphics adapter. Which software? Specifically, a thingie called a video driver
controls the graphics adapter. But lording it over the video driver is the oper-
ating system. Windows gives you plenty of options for adjusting the display
and what you see on the screen. This section mulls over several interesting
and useful examples.
Summoning the Display 
Properties dialog box
You tweak the display in Windows through the Display Properties dialog box.
Here’s how you muster it:
1. Right-click the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The Display Properties dialog box appears, ready for action, as shown in
Figure 10-4.

Part II: Computer Guts 

You can also summon the Display Properties dialog box by opening the
Display icon in the Control Panel, but in nearly a dozen years of using
Windows, I have rarely done that.
Some Display Properties dialog boxes may have custom tabs for your display
adapter. For example, some versions of the ATI adapter may add tabs for
doing special things with that graphics adapter. I don’t cover those things
here, mostly because ATI doesn’t send me any free stuff.
To preview any changes made in the Display Properties dialog box, click the
Apply button. Your monitor may blink or flicker, and Windows asks whether
everything is okay. Click the OK button if it is.
Adjusting the display size
(resolution) and colors
The monitor’s physical dimensions cannot change, but you can set the
amount of stuff you see on the screen by adjusting the monitor’s resolution.
That’s the number of dots, or pixels, the monitor displays. Each pixel can be a
different color, and, altogether, thousands of them on the monitor’s screen
create the image you see. The resolution is the number of pixels measuring
horizontally by vertically.
To set the screen’s resolution, you use the Settings tab in the Display
Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-4:
The Display
Properties
dialog box.
127
Chapter 10: Minding Your Monitors

The Screen Resolution slider sets the display resolution, measured in pixels
horizontally and vertically. The larger the numbers, the more information is
displayed. Smaller values yield less information, but make everything appear
bigger.
Use the preview window in the upper center of the dialog box to get an idea
of how the new resolution affects the display.
The Color Quality area determines how many colors are available at a spe-
cific resolution. The colors range from 16 (which is pretty dern ugly) to the
highest rating, also known as 32 bits.
 The resolution and color settings are related. Higher resolutions have
fewer colors, so you may want to set the color setting first and then see
which resolutions are available for that setting.
 You need only the highest color settings if you plan to use graphics
applications, such as photo editing.
 Higher resolutions work best on larger monitors.
 Some LCD monitors allow only selected resolutions, such as 800 x 600 or
1024 x 768.
 The maximum number of resolution and color settings depends on the
graphics adapter and not on the monitor size. The more video RAM the
graphics adapter has, the more options are available.
 Some computer games automatically change the monitor’s resolution to
allow the games to be played. This change is okay because the resolu-
tion should return to normal after playing the game.

Changing the background (wallpaper)
The background, or wallpaper, is what you see when you look at the desktop.
It can be a solid color, or it can display any graphics image stored on your
hard drive or found on the Internet. This process is all handled on the
Desktop tab in the Display Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-6.
To use a solid color, choose (None) from the top of the scrolling Background
list and then select a color using the Color button. Yes, you can choose from
only 20 colors; I hope you can find something to match your drapes.
Images are more fun than solid colors, and Windows gives you a host of
image files to choose from on the Background scrolling list. You can click to

Making things easier to see
If you have trouble seeing small things, adjust
your display so that they appear as big as pos-
sible: Choose a low resolution, such as 800 x 600
or even 640 x 480. Take advantage of the various
View➪Zoom commands available in applica-
tions, which greatly enlarge the text or subject
matter.
You can also direct Windows to use larger icons
on the display. In the Display Properties dialog
box, click the Appearance tab and then click the
Effects button. In the Effects dialog box, put a
check mark next to the Use Large Icons option.
Click OK.

select an image and then see how it looks in the preview window, at the top
of the dialog box. If you can’t find the image you’re looking for, use the
Browse button to go fetch one from a specific location on the disk.
If the image doesn’t quite fill the screen, you can use the Position button to
adjust it. Choose Tile to have the image pattern replicate to fill the screen; the
Stretch option forces an image to resize itself and cover the whole desktop.
 The Browse dialog box works just like the Open dialog box. See Chapter 21.
 To set an image from the Web as your wallpaper, right-click the image
and choose the Set As Background command from the pop-up menu.
 Creating your own wallpaper is easy. You can do so in the Windows Paint
program, or you can use a scanned image or a shot from a digital camera.
Adding a screen saver
The screen saver is an image or animation that appears on the monitor after a
given period of inactivity. After your computer sits there, lonely and feeling
ignored, for 30 minutes, for example, an image of a fish tank appears on the
monitor to amuse any ghosts in the room.
To set a screen saver, you use the Screen Saver tab in the Display Properties
dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-7. Choose a screen saver from the drop-
down Screen Saver list. Use the Settings button (if it’s available) to adjust the
screen saver’s action. The preview window shows you what the screen saver
looks like teensy; use the Preview button to see what the screen saver looks
like full-screen.
Figure 10-7:
Select a

Part II: Computer Guts 

One key setting is the Wait box, which tells Windows how many idle minutes
pass before the screen saver kicks in.
Make your settings and then click the OK button. If you don’t touch the mouse
or keyboard after the given amount of Wait time, the screen saver appears on
your monitor.
 A safe key to press for switching off the screen saver is Ctrl. Unlike other
keys on your keyboard, this key doesn’t mess with any application that
appears after the screen saver vanishes.
 A cool way to switch off the screen saver is to pound your desk with
your fist. That jostles the mouse and deactivates the screen saver.
 Beware of downloading screen saver files from the Internet. Although
some of them are legitimate screen savers, most of them are invasive ads
or programs that are impossible to uninstall or remove. If you download
this type of screen saver, you’re pretty much stuck with it. Be careful!
 The problem the original screen savers tried to prevent was known as
phosphor burn-in. It can still happen on monitors now, but only if the
same image is displayed for months. LCD monitors are not susceptible
to phosphor burn-in.
Putting the monitor to sleep
As an alternative to using a screen saver, you can take advantage of your PC’s
power-management abilities and simply turn the monitor off after a given
amount of time. To make it happen, click the Power button at the bottom of the
Display Properties dialog box, on the Screen Saver tab (refer to Figure 10-7).
Doing so displays the Power Options Properties dialog box.
Look for the Turn Off Monitor option in the Power Options Properties dialog
box. Set a time interval after which the PC automatically shuts off the moni-
tor. If you don’t want the monitor shutting itself off, choose Never.
Click OK to close the Power Options Properties dialog box.
 If you’re using a screen saver, set the value greater than the time after
which the screen saver kicks in.
 I forgo the screen saver and merely choose to turn off my monitor after
an hour of inactivity.
 You can also get to the Power Options Properties dialog box by opening
the Power Options icon in the Control Panel.

Chapter 10: Minding Your Monitors

Taking a Picture of the Screen
It’s possible in Windows to capture information on the screen just like taking
a picture. It’s technically called a screen dump, where dump is an ancient
computer term for copying raw information from one place to another, a
pouring out of the old bit bucket, as it were.
Pressing the Print Screen key takes a snapshot of the desktop. Click! All that
graphical information — whatever you see — is saved as a graphics image in
the Windows Clipboard. You can then paste the image into any program that
can swallow graphical images, such as Windows Paint or Microsoft Word.
To see how this process works, follow these steps:
1. Press the Print Screen key.
2. Start the Windows Paint program.
Find it on the Start panel by choosing Programs➪Accessories➪Paint.
3. Choose Edit➪Paste in the Paint program.
The desktop image is pasted into the Paint program, ready for editing,
saving to disk, or printing and framing.
To print the image after it’s been pasted, simply use the program’s File➪Print
command. I know that’s a lot of steps, but it finally puts meaning into the
key’s name, Print Screen.
 On some keyboards, the Print Screen key is labeled PrtSc.
 If you press the Alt+Print Screen key combination, only the frontmost, or
“top,” window is copied to the Clipboard.
 Note that you cannot capture a frame from a DVD movie by using the
Print Screen key.

n every great adventure story, the hero generally has a sidekick. The side-
kick isn’t as great as the hero, and it can be argued that the hero could
easily accomplish his labors without the sidekick, but the sidekick becomes
a vital part of the story. The sidekick is the plucky comic relief. The sidekick
comes in handy every so often, and perhaps even saves the day, which more
than justifies his contrivance as a plot device.
In the land of computers, on the mesa of Input Devices, your computer key-
board is the hero. Its sidekick is the mouse. You use the keyboard and mouse
together to create interesting things, take care of business, or just tell the
computer what it can do with itself. It may not be utterly heroic, but it’s the
subject of this chapter.
Your PC Needs Its Keyboard
Forget about talking to the computer. Yes, on those futuristic science fiction
TV shows, they talk to the computer. They have to! There isn’t a keyboard in
sight! But, you — you have to peck away at the keys to make your intentions
known to Mr. Computer.

 The keyboard is the computer’s standard input device. Refer to Chapter 1
for more information on computer input.
 Okay, I lied: You can dictate to the computer. See Chapter 14 for informa-
tion on computer speech recognition.
The standard PC keyboard
The typical PC keyboard layout is shown in Figure 11-1. It’s known as the
Enhanced 104-key keyboard. Yes, it has 104 keys on it. You can count them
yourself, if you don’t believe me and you have the time.
Four main areas are mapped out on your PC’s keyboard, as shown in 
Figure 11-1:
Function keys: These keys are positioned on the top row of the keyboard.
They’re labeled F1, F2, F3, and on up to F11 and F12.
Typewriter keys: These keys are the same types of keys you would find on an
old typewriter: letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols.
Cursor-control keys: Often called arrow keys, these four keys move the text
cursor in the direction of their arrows. Above them are more cursor-control
keys — the six-pack of Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down.
Numeric keypad: Popular with accountants, bank tellers, and airline ticket
agents, the numeric keypad contains calculator-like keys. This keypad also
doubles as a cursor keypad; the Num Lock key determines its behavior.

Part II: Computer Guts 

The keyboard shown in Figure 11-1 is typical and boring. More exciting key-
board models exist, some ergonomically designed keyboards and others with
even more buttons on them. You read about those variations throughout the
following sections.
 The cursor is the blinking goober on the screen that shows you where
the stuff you type appears. As though cursor isn’t weird enough, the
blinking doodad is also called an insertion pointer.
 See the section “The Lock sisters,” later in this chapter, for more infor-
mation on the numeric keypad’s duplicity.
Shifty keys
Four keys on your keyboard are modifier keys. These keys work in combina-
tion with other keys to do various interesting and unbelievable things:
 Shift
 Ctrl or Control
 Alt or Alternate
 Win or Windows
You hold down a shift key and then press another key on the keyboard. What
happens then depends on the shift key you pressed and how the program
you’re using reacts to the key combination.
135
Chapter 11: The Keyboard and Mouse Chapter
“Must I learn to type to use a computer?”
The short answer: No, you don’t need to learn
to type to use a computer. Plenty of computer
users hunt and peck. In fact, most programmers
don’t know how to type, but that brings up an
interesting story: A computer software devel-
oper once halted all development and had his
programmers learn how to touch-type. It took
two whole weeks, but afterward, they all got
their work done much faster and had more time
available to break away and play those all-
important computer games.
As a bonus to owning a computer, you can have
it teach you how to type. The Mavis Beacon
Teaches Typing software package does just
that. Other packages are available, but I per-
sonally love the name Mavis Beacon.

 The Shift key is used to make capital letters or to access the punctuation
and other symbols on the number keys and other keys. This is how you
can create the %@#^ characters that come in handy for cursing in comic
strips.
 The Ctrl and Alt keys are used in combination with other keys as short-
cuts for menu commands. For example, if you hold down the Ctrl key and
press S (Ctrl+S), you activate the Save command. Holding down the Alt
key and pressing the F4 key (Alt+F4) closes a window on the desktop. You
press and hold the shift key, tap the other key, and then release both.
 When pressed by itself, the Win key pops up the Start menu thing.
Otherwise, the Win key can be used in combination with other keys to
do various things on the desktop. For example, Win+E summons the
Windows Explorer program, and Win+D displays the desktop.
 Even though you may see Ctrl+S or Alt+S with a capital S, it doesn’t
mean that you must press Ctrl+Shift+S or Alt+Shift+S. The S is written in
uppercase simply because Ctrl+s looks like a typesetting error.
 Don’t be surprised if these shift keys are used in combination with each
other. I have seen Shift+Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Alt. Just remember to press and
hold the Shift keys first and then tap the letter key. Release all the keys
together.
 Some manuals use the notation ^Y rather than Ctrl+Y. This term means
the same thing: Hold down the Ctrl key, press Y, and release the Ctrl key.
The Lock sisters
The three Lock sisters are special keys designed to change the way other
keys on the keyboard behave:
Caps Lock: This key works like holding down the Shift key, but it produces
only capital letters; it doesn’t shift the other keys like a typewriter’s Shift
Lock key would do. Press Caps Lock again, and the letters return to their
normal, lowercase state.
Num Lock: Pressing this key makes the numeric keypad on the right side of
the keyboard produce numbers. Press this key again, and you can use the
numeric keypad for moving the text cursor.
Scroll Lock: This key has no purpose in life. Some spreadsheets use it to
reverse the function of the cursor keys (which move the spreadsheet rather
than the cell highlight). Scroll Lock does little else that’s significant or
famous.
136
Part II: Computer Guts 

When a lock key is on, a corresponding light appears on the keyboard. The
light may be on the keyboard or on the key itself. That’s your clue that a lock
key’s feature is turned on.
 Caps Lock affects only the keys A through Z; it doesn’t affect any other
keys.
 If you type This Text Looks Like A Ransom Note and it looks like tHIS
tEXT lOOKS lIKE a rANSOM nOTE, the Caps Lock key is inadvertently
turned on. Press it once to return everything to normal.
 If you press the Shift key while Caps Lock is on, the letter keys return to
normal. (Shift kind of cancels out Caps Lock.)
Specific keys from Any to the bizarre
Your computer keyboard is a virtual playground of buttons — some famous,
some mysterious, and some non-existent. The following rundown of what’s
important ignores what’s not:
Ha-ha. There is no Any key on the keyboard. The old message once read,
“Press Any key to continue” and the programmer thought he was being gen-
erous, but people still did look for that elusive Any key.
When the computer asks you to press the Any key, press any key on the key-
board. Specifically, press the spacebar.
The Break key does nothing. Why is the key named Break? Why not call it the
Brake key? Wouldn’t that make sense? Who wants a computer to break,
anyway?
The Break key is the same as the Pause key. In fact, Break is really the
Alt+Pause key. See the Pause key description later in this section.

Strange keyboard abbreviations
The keys on the keyboard are only so big.
Therefore, some words have to be scrunched
down to fit on the key cap. Here’s your guide to
some of the more oddly named keys and what
they mean:
Print Screen is also known as PrScr or Print
Scrn.
Page Up and Page Down are written as PgUp
and PgDn on the numeric keypad.
Insert and Delete appear as Ins and Del on the
numeric keypad.

This is the keyboard’s most popular key; you press Enter to end a paragraph
in a word processor. In a dialog box, pressing the Enter key is the same as
clicking the OK button.
A second Enter key can be found on the numeric keypad. It’s there to facili-
tate the rapid entry of incorrect numerical values. Both Enter keys work 
identically.
The one key that says “Hey! Stop it!” to Windows is the Escape key, labeled
Esc on your keyboard. Pressing the Esc key is the same as clicking Cancel or
No Way in a dialog box. This key closes most, but not all, windows, just to
keep you guessing.
Whenever you need help in Windows, whack the F1 key. F1 equals help —
there’s no way to commit that to memory.
Honestly, the Pause key doesn’t work in Windows. Some games may use it to
pause the action, but it’s not a consistent thing.
This is the forward slash key. It’s used as a separator and also to denote divi-
sion, such as 52/13 (52 divided by 13). Don’t confuse it with the backslash key.
The backslash (\) leans to the left. This character is used in pathnames,
which are complex and not discussed in this book.
Allow me to end the mystery: This is the System Request key. It does nothing.
Ignore it.

Part II: Computer Guts 
Know your ones and zeroes
On a typewriter, the lowercase letter L and the
number 1 are often the same. In fact, my old
Underwood upright lacks a 1 key altogether.
Unfortunately, on a computer, a big difference
exists between a one and a little L.
If you’re typing 1,001, for example, don’t type
l,00l by mistake — especially when you’re work-
ing with a spreadsheet. The computer gags.
The same holds true for the uppercase letter O
and the number 0. They’re different. Use a zero
for numbers and a big O for big O things.
Sometimes, zero is displayed with a slash
through it, like this: Ø, or maybe with a dot in the
middle. That’s one way to tell the difference
between O and 0, but it’s not used that often. A
better indication is that the letter O is often fatter
than the symbol for zero.

This booger is the Context key. It lives between the right Windows and Ctrl
keys. Pressing this key displays the shortcut menu for whatever item is
selected on the screen. It’s the same as right-clicking the mouse when some-
thing is selected. Obviously, this key is next to useless.
The Tab key is used in two different ways on your computer, neither of which
generates a diet cola beverage. In a word processor, you use the Tab key to
indent paragraphs — just like an old typewriter’s Tab key. In a dialog box, you
use the Tab key to move between the various graphical gizmos.
Use Tab rather than Enter when you’re filling in a form in a program or dialog
box or on the Internet. For example, press the Tab key to hop between the
First Name and Last Name fields.
 The Tab key often has two arrows on it — one pointing to the left and
the other to the right. These arrows may be in addition to the word Tab,
or they may be on there by themselves to confuse you.
 The arrows move both ways because Shift+Tab is a valid key combina-
tion. For example, pressing Shift+Tab in a dialog box moves you “back-
ward” through the options.
 The computer treats a tab as a single, separate character. When you
backspace over a tab in a word processing program, the tab disappears
completely in one chunk — not space by space.

Chapter 11: The Keyboard and Mouse Chapter
For those forced to do math on the computer
Clustered around the numeric keypad, like
campers roasting marshmallows around a fire,
are various keys to help you work with numbers.
Especially if you’re dabbling with a spreadsheet
or other number-crunching software, you find
that these keys come in handy. Take a look at
your keyboard’s numeric keypad right now, just
to reassure yourself.
What? You were expecting a ×_or ÷ key? Forget
it! This is a computer. It uses special oddball
symbols for mathematical operations:
 + is for addition.
 – is for subtraction.
 * is for multiplication.
 / is for division.
The only strange symbol here is the asterisk, for
multiplication. Don’t use the little x! It’s not the
same thing. The / (slash) is okay for division, but
don’t waste your time hunting for the ÷ symbol.
It’s not there.

Special keys on special keyboards
If 104 keys on the keyboard just aren’t enough, you can venture out and buy
special keyboards that sport even more keys. Or, perhaps your computer
came with that type of keyboard. Typically, this type has a row of buttons
along the top, right above the function keys. These buttons carry out specific
tasks, such as connecting to the Internet, scanning images, sending e-mail, or
adjusting the computer’s sound volume.
Specialty keyboard buttons are nonstandard: They don’t come with the typi-
cal PC keyboard and must be supported by using some special program run
on the computer. That program controls the keys and their behavior. If the
keys don’t work, it’s a problem with the special program and not anything
that Windows or your computer is doing wrong.
Controlling the Keyboard in Windows
When you press and hold any key on the keyboard, eventually that key
repeats itself, like a machine gun. Press and hold the A key, and eventually
you see a whole slew of AAAAAAAAAAAA. . . . (That’s so that you can easily
type dialogue when your characters are falling off a cliff.)
The pause, or delay, before a key repeats is the repeat delay. The rapidity at
which the key’s character (or function) repeats is the repeat rate. Both these
items are set by using the Keyboard Properties dialog box (see Figure 11-2).
To get there, open the Control Panel and then open the Keyboard icon.
Figure 11-2:
Control the

Part II: Computer Guts 

Use the mouse to manipulate the sliders in the dialog box to set the rates,
and then test out the rates in the text box that’s provided. Click the OK or
Apply button only when you’re happy.
If the computer’s keyboard has specialty buttons (refer to the preceding sec-
tion), an extra tab may appear in the Keyboard Properties dialog box. That
tab is used to assign commands or duties to the various extra buttons.
Proper Typing Attitude
Sister Mary Serious had a point about sitting up properly and not letting your
wrists droop in typing class. Posture and position are important when you’re
using a computer keyboard, especially if you do so quite a bit. That’s because
many humans run the risk of something called repetitive stress injury (RSI).
Here are several things you can do to avoid RSI and keep your computing
experience a pleasant one:
Get an ergonomic keyboard: Even if your wrists are as limber as rubber tree
plants, you may want to consider an ergonomic keyboard. That type of key-
board is specially designed at an angle to relieve the stress of typing for long —
or short — periods.
Use a wrist pad: Wrist pads elevate your wrists so that you type in a proper
position, with your palms above the keyboard, not resting below the spacebar.
Adjust your chair: Sit at the computer with your elbows level with your wrists.
Adjust your monitor: Your head should not tilt down or up when you view
the computer screen. It should be straight ahead, which doesn’t help your
wrists as much as it helps your neck.
 Ergonomic keyboards cost a little more than standard keyboards, but
they’re well worth the investment if you type for long hours, or at least
want to look like you type for long hours.
 Some mouse pads have built-in wrist elevators. They’re great for folks
who use mouse-intensive applications.
 Many keyboards come with adjustable legs underneath for positioning
the keys to a comfortable angle. Use these legs.

Chapter 11: The Keyboard and Mouse Chapter

A Mouse You Can Put Your Hand On
After modem jokes, more computer mouse jokes are told than anything else.
And, like the modem jokes, none of the mouse jokes is worth repeating. In fact,
having a mouse with your computer is so common that the silly thing doesn’t
really need much explaining any more; hence, no more funny jokes about
Mildred thinking that it’s a foot pedal or Dave using the mouse upside down.
The PC needs a mouse
Your computer’s mouse is an input device. Although the keyboard (another
input device) can do almost anything, you need a mouse in order to control
graphics and graphical whatnots on the screen — especially in an operating
system like Windows.
 Your PC may have come with a specific mouse, but you can always buy a
better replacement.
 The plural of computer mouse is mice. One computer has a mouse. Two
computers have mice.
The basic, generic computer mouse
A typical computer mouse is shown in Figure 11-3, though what you see there
is only one style of mouse. The variety is truly endless. Even so, nearly all
computer mice have the same basic parts.
Mouse body: The mouse is about the size of a bar of soap. You rest your
palm on its body and use your fingers to manipulate the mouse buttons.
The two main buttons: The standard PC mouse has a minimum of two but-
tons, left and right. The left button, which falls under your right hand’s index
finger, is the main button. The other button is the right button.
The wheel button: A popular addition to the standard PC mouse is the
center, or wheel, button. This button can be pressed like the left and right
buttons, and it can be rolled back and forth. Some wheels can even be tilted
from side to side.
The mouse finds its home to the right of the keyboard (for more right-handed
people). It needs a clear swath of desk space so that you can move the mouse
around; an area about the size of this book is typically all you need.
142
Part II: Computer Guts 

Optical versus mechanical
You use the mouse by moving it around on your desktop. The movement is
detected internally by the mouse, either mechanically or optically.
The mechanical mouse houses a hard rubber ball that rolls as the mouse is
moved. Sensors inside the mouse body detect the movement and translate it
into information that the computer interprets.
The optical mouse uses an LED sensor to detect tabletop movement and then
send off that information to the computer for merry munching.
Of the two types, optical mice are better. They last longer and they’re easier
to clean. Also, optical mice don’t need a mouse pad, which is necessary for a
mechanical mouse’s ball to get proper traction. An optical mouse can work
on any nonreflective surface.
Computer gamers, always the exception, prefer mechanical mice when play-
ing games. Mechanical mice are more responsive, whereas optical mice have
a tendency to jump when moved quickly.
Cordless mice
The latest rage in computing is wireless, and computer mice have been minus
their tails for years (long before the farmer’s wife wielded that carving knife).
There are two types of wireless mice:
Figure 11-3:
A typical
computer
mouse.
143
Chapter 11: The Keyboard and Mouse Chapter

The infrared (IR) wireless mouse: This type of mouse requires a line of sight
to work; the mouse sends bursts of IR light to the base station, which picks
up the signals the same way your TV remote transmits information to the TV
set. Like the TV remote, however, if the mouse’s batteries are low or some-
thing is blocking the line of sight, the remote mouse doesn’t work. In that
case, say “Stupid mouse!” and throw it out the window.
The radio frequency (RF) wireless mouse: Unlike IR wireless mice, the RF
variation works without the mouse being able to see the base station. In fact,
you can hide the base station behind the PC (or a pile of manuals and sticky
notes).
Cordless mice require power, which comes in the form of batteries. They
must be replaced or recharged occasionally, or else the mouse doesn’t work.
The best solution for this problem is a recharging cradle; the cordless mouse
is stored in the cradle when it isn’t being used. That makes the mouse easier
to find and keeps the thing charged.
Other mouse species
Of all computer peripherals, the mouse is the chameleon. Mice come in more
types than varieties of Baskin-Robbins ice cream.
The most common alternative mouse is one with more buttons on it. The
extra buttons can be programmed to do specific things, such as navigate the
World Wide Web or turn pages when you’re reading a document. How many
buttons? The typical button-ified mouse may have five buttons. The most I’ve
ever seen, however, is 57 buttons. (I kid you not.)
A popular mouse variation is the trackball, which is like an upside-down
mouse. Rather than roll the mouse around, you use your thumb or index
finger to roll a ball on top of the mouse. The whole contraption stays station-
ary, so it doesn’t need nearly as much room and its cord never gets tangled.
This type of mouse is preferred by graphic artists because it’s often more
precise than the traditional “soap-on-a-rope” mouse.
Another mouse mutation enjoyed by the artistic type is the stylus mouse, which
looks like a pen and draws on a special pad. This mouse is also pressure sensi-
tive, which is wonderful for use in painting and graphics applications.
Finally, there are those cordless 3D mice, which can be pointed at the com-
puter screen like a TV remote. Those things give me the willies.
144
Part II: Computer Guts 

Basic Mouse Operations
The computer’s mouse controls a graphical mouse pointer or mouse cursor
on the screen. When you move the mouse around by rolling it on your desk,
the pointer on the screen moves in a similar manner. Roll the mouse left, and
the pointer moves left; roll it in circles, and the pointer mimics that action;
drop the mouse off the table and your computer bruises. (Just kidding.)
Here are some of the more basic mouse operations:
Point: When you’re told to “point the mouse,” you move the mouse on the
desktop, which moves the mouse pointer on the screen to point at something
interesting (or not).
Click: A click is a press of the mouse button — one press and release of the
main button, the one on the left. This action makes a clicking sound, which is
where this maneuver gets its name. Clicking is often done to select something
or to identify a specific location on the screen.
Right-click: This action is the same as a click, though the right mouse button
is used.
Double-click: This one works just like the single click, though you click twice
in the same spot — usually, rather rapidly. This is most commonly done in
Windows to open something, such as an icon. Both clicks must be on (or
near) the same spot for the double-click to work.
Drag: The drag operation is done to graphically pick something up on the
screen and move it. To do that, you point the mouse at the thing you want to
drag and then press and hold the mouse’s button. Keep the mouse button
down, which “picks up” the object, and then move the mouse to another loca-
tion. As you move the mouse (and keep the button down) the object moves.
To release, or drop, the object, release the mouse button.
Right-drag: This action is the same as a drag, but the mouse’s right button is
used instead.
Many of these basic mouse operations can be combined with keys on the
keyboard. For example, a Shift+click means pressing the Shift key on the key-
board while clicking the mouse. A Ctrl+drag means pressing and holding the
Ctrl key while you drag an object with the mouse.
 The best way to learn how to use a computer mouse is to play a com-
puter card game, such as Solitaire or FreeCell (both of which come with
Windows). You should have the mouse mastered in only a few frustrat-
ing hours.

Chapter 11: The Keyboard and Mouse Chapter

 You don’t need to squeeze the mouse; a gentle grip is all that’s necessary.
 Press and release the mouse button to click.
 If you double-click your mouse and nothing happens, you may not be
clicking fast enough. See the section “‘Double-clicking doesn’t work!’”
later in this chapter.
Dinking with the Mouse in Windows
In Windows, the mouse is controlled, manipulated, and teased by using the
Mouse icon in the Control Panel. Opening that icon displays the Mouse
Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-4, where you can make mousy
adjustments.
Note that the Mouse Properties dialog box may look different from Figure 11-4
and what you see elsewhere in this book. It all depends on which mouse your
PC uses. Although some tabs are generically the same, some are specific to
the mouse hardware.
This section covers some of the more helpful things you can do in the Mouse
Properties dialog box in Windows.
Figure 11-4:

“I can’t find the mouse pointer!”
The Pointer Options tab in the Mouse Properties dialog box, as shown in
Figure 11-5, contains a number of options to help you locate a lonely or lost
mouse pointer. These options can come in handy, especially on larger dis-
plays or when the mouse pointer is floating over a particularly busy desktop.
 The Pointer Trails option displays a comet trail of mouse pointers as
you move the mouse about. Jiggling or circling the mouse makes lots of
visual racket, which allows you to quickly locate the mouse pointer.
 The Ctrl Key Location option allows you to find the mouse pointer by
tapping either Ctrl key on the keyboard. This action makes a radar-like
circle appear, by zeroing in on the cursor’s location.
 You can also employ the Snap To option, which specifically jumps the
mouse pointer to the main button in any dialog box that appears
(though I find this option annoying).
“Double-clicking doesn’t work!”
If you can’t seem to double-click, one of two things is happening: Either you’re
moving the mouse pointer a little bit between clicks or the double-click rate is
set too fast for human fingers to manage.
Figure 11-5:
Ways to find
a wayward
mouse.
147
Chapter 11: The Keyboard and Mouse Chapter

The double-click rate is set in the Mouse Properties dialog box, on either the
Buttons or Activities tabs. On one tab or the other you find the Double-Click
Speed area. Practice your double-clicking on the tiny folder icon off to the
right. Use the Slow-Fast slider to adjust the double-click speed to better
match your click-click timing.
“I’m left-handed, and the buttons are
backward!”
Where is that left-handed class action suit, anyway?
In Windows, you can adjust the mouse for southpaw use on the Buttons tab,
as shown earlier, in Figure 11-4. Put a check mark by the box labeled Switch
Primary and Secondary Buttons. That way, the “main” mouse button is under
your left index finger.
 This book and all manuals and computer books assume that the left
mouse button is the main button. Right-clicks are clicks of the right mouse
button. If you tell Windows to use the left-handed mouse, these buttons
are reversed. Keep in mind that your documentation doesn’t reflect that.
 Left-handed mice are available that are sculpted to fit your left hand
better than all those right-hand-oriented biased mice on the market.
 No setting is available for ambidextrous people, wise guy!

O
nce upon a time, computers were coupled with a common peripheral
called a printer. The printer’s job was to print, or to get that electronic
stuff out of the computer and down on paper. After all, showing someone a
piece of paper is far easier than lugging around your computer and monitor
(or even a laptop) all day. The printer’s job was simple, and it was a humble
device. But that was then.
Computer printers now often do much more than just print. The current rage
is the all-in-one, or a combination device that not only prints, but can also be
used as a scanner, photocopier, and maybe even a fax machine. Despite its
many talents, the thing is still referred to as a printer, and it’s basic printing
that is the subject of this chapter.
The Printer’s the Thing
The basic duty of your PC’s printer is to print. Yeah, it may also scan, copy,
and do the dishes. But, at the heart of the thing is a gizmo that puts ink to
paper and gives you what the computer nerds call hard copy, something you
can show the world.

Printer categories
Several categories of computer printer exist, depending on how the ink 
gets splattered on the paper as well as on the printer’s features. Here’s the
short list:
 Inkjet
 Laser
 Photo
 All-in-one
 Impact
The inkjet, photo, and all-in-one printers all use the same basic method for
putting ink on paper: Tiny balls of ink are spewed directly onto the paper.
Because the teensy-tiny ink balls stick to the paper, this type of printer needs
no ribbon or toner cartridge; the ink is jetted out directly, which is how the
printer gets its name.
Laser printers are found primarily in the office environment, where they can
handle the high workload. The printer works like a photocopier: The differ-
ence is that the computer creates the image and etches it by using a laser
beam rather than using a mirror and the magic moving bar of light you see
whenever you try to photocopy your face.
Impact printers are the traditional printers of yesterday’s computers. The
two popular types are dot-matrix and daisy-wheel. Impact printers are slower
and noisier than the other types of printers. These printers use a ribbon and
some device that physically bangs the ribbon onto the paper. Because of
that, impact printers are primarily used now in printing invoices or multicopy
forms. They’re not practical for home use.
 Inkjet printers are by no means messy. The ink is dry on the paper by
the time the paper comes flopping out of the printer.
 A laser printer that can print in color is known as a color laser printer.
The regular (noncolor) laser printer uses only one color of ink — usu-
ally, black.
 Low-end inkjet printers cost less because they’re dumb; they contain no
internal electronics to help create the image. Instead, the computer is
required to do the thinking, which slows things down a tad. When you
pay more for an inkjet printer, the smarts are usually included with the
printer.
 High-priced printers offer a higher-quality output, faster speed, more
printing options, the ability to print on larger sheets of paper, and other
amazing options.
150
Part II: Computer Guts 

A look around your printer
Take a moment to examine your printer and look for some handy things, as
labeled in Figure 12-1:
Paper feed: The paper feed is where you store the paper that the printer
eventually prints on. For more information, see the section “Feeding your
printer, Part II: Paper,” later in this chapter.
Manual/envelope feeder: Fancier printers may have a special slot, tray, or
foldout-thing used to manually feed special papers or envelopes. It may be
hidden on your printer, and it’s not shown in Figure 12-1, so look around a bit
to see whether your printer has such a deal.
Paper output tray: The printed paper comes out and is stacked up in the
output tray. If the paper comes out face up, be sure to see the section
“Printing in reverse order,” later in this chapter.
Control panel: Refer to the next subsection for the details.
Ink/toner replacement: Printers don’t go on printing forever. At some point,
you need to stuff the thing with more ink. Be sure that you know how to open
the printer to find where the ink goes. Also see the section “Feeding your
printer, Part I: Ink,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 12: More than a Mortal Printer

The mighty printer control panel
Every printer has a control panel somewhere on its body. The fancy models
have LCD screens that display lots of text: Printer jammed, I’m out of
paper, or You’re plagiarizing, for example. Less fancy printers may have
only a couple of buttons. Either way, two important buttons to find or fea-
tures to access on the control panel are
 On-Line or Select
 Form Feed
The purpose of the On-Line or Select button is to tell your printer whether to
ignore the computer. When the printer is offline or deselected, the computer
can’t print. The printer is still on, which is good because you may need to
access features or do things that you otherwise cannot do while the thing is
printing.
The Form Feed button is used to eject a page of paper from the printer. For
example, if you stop printing and only half a page is printed, you can use the
Form Feed button to eject the rest of that page. Or, you can press the Form
Feed button whenever you want the printer to spit a blank page at you.
 The computer can print only when the printer is online or selected.
 You take the printer offline if, for example, you have to unjam it or want
to eject a page of paper. Sometimes, you have to turn the printer off
when it jams.
 If your printer seems to lack a control panel, it’s probably controlled via
a software control panel in Windows. This is the printer’s feature and
not a part of Windows, so refer to the printer’s manual for instructions.
 Printers with larger LCD control panels often use menu buttons to help
you choose the online or form-feed options.
 All-in-one printers have additional buttons on the control panel for
making copies and scanning, for example. A companion program in
Windows probably allows for even greater control over the printer’s abil-
ities. Note that such programs are specific to your printer, and not a part
of Windows itself.
 Keep your printer’s manual handy. For example, I put my printer’s
manual right beneath the printer, where I can always find it. You may
never read the manual, but if your printer suddenly pops up and dis-
plays Error 34, you can look up what Error 34 is and read how to fix
it. (The voice of experience is talking here.)
152
Part II: Computer Guts 

Feeding your printer, Part I: Ink
This may be the 21st century, but mankind is still printing with ink and paper,
just like the Chinese were hundreds of years ago. The type of ink and how it’s
stored depend on which type of printer you’re using.
Inkjet printers, which include photo and all-in-one models, use ink cartridges.
Laser printers use a powdery ink substance, called toner, that also comes in a
cartridge. Either way, you spend lots of money replacing the ink in your printer.
Replace an ink cartridge by first removing the old cartridge. Carefully unwrap
the foil around the new cartridge. Remove any tape or covering, per the pack-
age’s instructions. Then insert the ink cartridge into the printer, again follow-
ing the instructions for your specific ink printer. Put the old cartridge into the
new cartridge’s box and properly dispose of it or have it recycled.
Laser printers require drop-in toner cartridges. They’re easy to install and
come with their own, handy instructions. Just don’t breathe in the toner or
else you’ll die. Some manufacturers sell their cartridges with return envelopes
so that you can send the old cartridge back to the factory for recycling or
proper disposal.
All printers use black ink or toner. Color printers also use black, plus three
other inks or toners: magenta, cyan, and yellow. Photo printers add two more
colors, another flavor each of magenta and cyan.
Sometimes, the colors in an inkjet printer come three to a cartridge. Yes, that
means that if only one color of ink goes, you must replace the entire cartridge.
That’s why I recommend, in my book Buying a Computer For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.), getting a printer with separate cartridges for each ink color.
 Make a note of what type of inkjet cartridges your printer uses. Keep the
catalog number somewhere handy, such as taped to your inkjet printer’s
case, so that you can always reorder the proper cartridge.
 Yes, they make money by selling you ink. That’s why the printer is cheap.
It’s the old “give away the razor and sell them the blade” thing all over
again.
 Several online and mail-order dealers offer cheap prices on ink and toner
cartridges, better than you find locally or in an office supply superstore.
 If the ink cartridge has nozzles, you can refill it on your own. Refill kits
are sold everywhere, and they’re cheaper than continually buying new
cartridges. However, the kits work best if the cartridge has nozzles. If the
cartridge is just a storage bin, you’re better off buying a new one.
153
Chapter 12: More than a Mortal Printer

 Always follow carefully the instructions for changing cartridges. Old 
cartridges can leak and get messy ink all over. I suggest having a paper
towel handy and putting the used cartridge in a plastic baggie while you
walk to the trashcan.
 CMYK is an abbreviation for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, the
common ink colors used in inkjet printers.
 You don’t always have to print in color with an inkjet printer! You can
also just print in black ink, which saves the (often spendy) color car-
tridge from running low. The Print dialog box (covered later in this chap-
ter) often has an option that lets you choose whether you want to print
with color or black ink.
 When the laser printer first warns you that Toner [is] low, you can
get a few more pages from it by gently rocking the toner cartridge. Rock
it back and forth the short way (not end to end), which helps redistrib-
ute the toner dust.
 Buy rubber gloves (or those cheap plastic gloves that make you look like
Batman) and use them when changing an ink or toner cartridge.
 Another option for an empty laser printer toner cartridge is recharging.
You can take it to a special place that cleans the old cartridge and refills
it with fresh new toner. This process works and is often cheaper than
buying a whole new cartridge.
 Never let your printer toner get low or ink cartridges go dry. You may
think that squeezing every last drop of ink saves you money, but it’s not
good for the printer.
Feeding your printer, Part II: Paper
Next to consuming ink, printers eat paper. Fortunately, paper isn’t as expen-
sive as ink, so it doesn’t bankrupt you to churn through a ream or two. The
only issue is where to feed in the paper. Like feeding a baby, there is a right
end and a wrong end.
The paper goes into a feeder tray either near the printer’s bottom or sticking
out the top.
Laser printers require you to fill a cartridge with paper, similar to the way a
copy machine works. Slide the cartridge all the way into the printer after it’s
loaded up.
Confirm that you’re putting the paper in the proper way, either face down or
face up. Note which side is the top. Most printers have little pictures on them
154
Part II: Computer Guts 

that tell you how the paper goes into the printer. Here’s how those symbols
translate into English:
 The paper goes in face down, top side up.
 The paper goes in face down, top side down.
 The paper goes in face up, top side up.
 The paper goes in face up, top side down.
This info helps you when you’re loading things such as checks for use with
personal finance software. If the printer doesn’t tell you which way is up,
write Top on a sheet of paper and run it through the printer. Then draw your
own icon, similar to those shown above, that help you orient the pages you
manually insert into the printer.
Always make sure that you have enough printer paper. Buying too much isn’t
a sin.
Types of paper
There’s really no such thing as a typical sheet of paper. Paper comes in differ-
ent sizes, weights (degrees of thickness), colors, styles, textures, and, I
assume, flavors.
The best general-purpose paper to get is standard photocopier paper. If you
want better results from your inkjet printer, getting specific inkjet paper
works best, though you pay more for that paper. The higher-quality (and
spendy) inkjet paper is really good for printing colors; the paper is specially
designed to absorb the ink well.
At the high end of the spectrum are specialty papers, such as photographic
papers that come in smooth or glossy finishes, transparencies, and iron-on 
T-shirt transfers. Just ensure that the paper you get is made for your type of
printer.
 Some printers are capable of handling larger-size paper, such as legal or
tabloid sizes. If so, make sure that you load the paper properly and tell
your application that you’re using a different-size sheet of paper. The
File➪Page Setup command is responsible for selecting paper size.
 Avoid thick papers because they get jammed inside the printer. (They
can’t turn corners well.)
155
Chapter 12: More than a Mortal Printer

 Avoid using erasable bond and other fancy dusted papers in your printer.
These papers have talcum powder coatings that gum up the works.
 Don’t let the expensive paper ads fool you: Your inkjet printer can print
on just about any type of paper. Even so, the pricey paper does produce
a better image.
 My favorite type of inkjet paper is laser paper. It has a polished look to it
and a subtle waxy feel.
Setting Up Your Beloved Printer
Printers are one of the easiest devices to set up and configure. After freeing
the printer from its box, and from various pieces of tape and evil Styrofoam,
locate the printer’s power cable. Then locate the printer cable, the one that
connects the printer to the console.
A-ha! The printer didn’t come with a printer-to-console cable, did it? It doesn’t.
You have to buy one extra. I recommend getting a USB cable if the printer is
USB-happy. Otherwise, buy a standard, bidirectional PC printer cable. Refer
to Chapter 3 for information on plugging things in.
Refer to the printer’s instruction sheet to see whether you first need to install
software before turning the printer on. Otherwise, turn the printer on. A USB
printer is instantly recognized and configured by Windows.
Printers using the traditional printer cable, or network printers, require more
work. See the section “Manually adding a printer,” later in this chapter.
Most printers, like computers, can now be left on all the time. The printer
automatically slips into a low-power sleep mode when it’s no longer needed.
However, if you don’t print often (at least every day), it’s perfectly fine to turn
off your printer.
 I recommend placing the printer near the console, about an arm’s 
length away.
 Some USB printers demand to be directly connected to the computer,
not plugged into a USB hub.
 You can connect a number of printers to a single computer. As long as
the computer has a second printer port or uses another USB port or
even the network, multiple printers work fine.
156
Part II: Computer Guts 

Windows and Your Printer
The printing action in Windows happens inside the Printers and Faxes
window (see Figure 12-2). To get there, open the Printers and Faxes icon
inside the Control Panel. Or, more quickly, you can choose the Printers and
Faxes command from the Start button’s menu (though it may not be there).
The Printers and Faxes window lists all printing devices attached or available
to your computer. Here’s a smattering of what you may see:
The default printer: This is the printer Windows uses automatically — the
primary, or first, printer — which Windows calls the default printer. You can
always spy this printer because of the check mark in a circle.
The fax machine: This icon represents your PC’s fax modem — if you have
one. Sending a fax works just like printing.
A shared printer: Printers with the sharing hand icon are connected to your
PC, but are available for use by others on the network.
Figure 12-2:
The Printers
and Faxes
window.
157
Chapter 12: More than a Mortal Printer

A network printer: Printers with plumbing beneath them exist elsewhere on
the network. You can use them just like any other printer, but it’s a walk to
get your document after it prints.
The printer icon is generic. All printers appear in the Printers and Faxes
window using the same icon, so you cannot really tell what type of printer it
is by looking at its icon in the window.
Manually adding a printer
Your printer was probably set up when you first ran your computer. Windows
asks about the printer, and you answer a few questions, and then it’s done.
But when you need to add another printer, especially a non-network or non-
USB printer, more work is involved. It’s not difficult — just heed these steps:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes folder.
Refer to the preceding section.
2. Choose File➪Add Printer from the menu.
The Add Printer Wizard starts.
3. Click the Next button and follow the wizard’s directions.
The steps that follow vary, depending on your printer. Here are my
words of wisdom to help you through the rest of the wizard:
• Let the network administrator worry about connecting network
printers.
• Don’t bother with the Plug and Play option; Windows has already
recognized any Plug and Play printers.
• The printer is most likely connected to the first printer port, code
named LPT1.
• If your printer came with its own CD, you may need to install pro-
grams from that CD to begin or finish the printer installation. Refer
to the documentation that came with the CD.
4. The final installation step is to print a test page on your printer.
When the printer is connected properly and everything is up to snuff,
you see that gratifying test page print.
You can now start using that printer. Its icon appears in the Printers and
Faxes window.
158
Part II: Computer Guts 

Setting the default printer
When your PC is connected to, or has access to, multiple printers, you can
pick and choose which one you want to print on each time you go to print
something. The option to choose a printer is available in any Print dialog box,
as covered in the following section.
When you don’t choose a printer, Windows uses what it calls the default
printer. To set one of the printers as the default, follow these steps:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes window, as covered earlier in this chap-
ter, in the section “Windows and Your Printer.”
2. Click the printer you plan to use most often.
3. Choose File➪Set As Default Printer.
The tiny check mark on the printer’s icon confirms that you’ve set the default
printer.
You can change the default printer at any time by repeating these steps.
Basic Printer Operation
Under Windows, printing is a snap. All applications support the same print
command: Choose File➪Print from the menu, click OK in the Print dialog box
(see Figure 12-3), and — zit-zit-zit — you soon have hard copy.
Figure 12-3:
A typical
Print 
dialog box.
159
Chapter 12: More than a Mortal Printer

The Print dialog box shown in Figure 12-3 is typical for most programs. To
print the entire document, just click the Print button. Otherwise, you can use
the settings in the dialog box to change what and how you print.
For example, you can choose another printer from the list of available print-
ers. Or, you can set the number of pages to print (Page Range) and the
number of copies printed.
The Print dialog box may sport a Properties, Settings, or Options button that
lets you set other, more specific aspects of printing and control how the
printer works. For example, options to set whether printing happens in color
or grayscale, determine how to render graphics, and choose which paper
tray to use can be found by clicking an Options or Properties button.
 The common keyboard shortcut for the Print command is Ctrl+P.
 Rather than waste paper, consider using the File➪Print Preview command
instead. That command displays a sneak peek of what’s to be printed so
you can examine the printers output before wasting a sheet of paper.
 Many applications sport a Print toolbar icon. If so, you can click that
button to quickly print your document.
 The Print toolbar icon doesn’t summon the Print dialog box. It just
prints the entire document. To summon the Print dialog box, you must
use Ctrl+P or choose File➪Print from the menu.
“Where do I set my margins?”
The Print dialog box is only concerned with printing, not with formatting. Setting
margins, paper size, and other aspects of what is to be printed is handled else-
where in a program, usually in a Page Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4:
The Page
Setup 
dialog box.
160
Part II: Computer Guts 

To access the Page Setup dialog box, choose File➪Page Setup from the menu.
As with the Print dialog box, each application’s Page Setup dialog box is dif-
ferent, with commands not always in the same location.
 The Page Setup dialog box is where you set things like margins, paper
size, and so forth — not in the Print dialog box.
 Two options worth looking at in the Page Setup dialog box are Portrait
and Landscape. Portrait is the normal way documents print; Landscape is
printing “sideways,” or with the long edge of the paper on top.
 Use the Page Setup dialog box to choose between Letter, Legal, and a
number of other paper sizes. Be sure to stock the printer with that same
size of paper as well.
 Note that printers cannot print on an entire sheet of paper. There’s usu-
ally a small margin around the sheet or just on one end of the paper,
where no printing can take place. That’s the part of the page that’s held
by the printer’s paper-feeding mechanism, and its size and location vary
from printer to printer.
Printing in reverse order
When you have a printer that spits out its sheets of paper face up, notice that
the sheets are always in reverse order. That is, Page 1 is on the bottom of the
stack, and the last page is on the top. Rather than constantly reshuffle your
pages, why not let the computer do the work?
Most programs give you the ability to print in reverse order. For example, in
Microsoft Word, you click the Options button in the Print dialog box. In the
next dialog box that appears, put a check mark by the item labeled Reverse
Print Order. Click the OK button and then click the Print button to have your
document print perfectly.
Printing in reverse order isn’t a printer feature; it’s part of the program you
use. Some programs have that feature, and others don’t.
Stop, printer! Stop!
The most frustrating printer experience you can have is wanting the dumb
thing to stop printing. It happens. Often.
The easiest way to stop printing is to look on the printer’s control panel for a
Cancel button. Click that button, and all printing stops. Oh, a few more lines
may print and a half-written page gets ejected from the printer, but that’s it.
161
Chapter 12: More than a Mortal Printer

If you have an older printer (or just a cheap one) without a Cancel button, 
do this:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes window.
2. Open your printer’s icon.
The printer’s window is displayed, similar to what’s shown in Figure 12-5.
3. Click to select the document you want to cancel.
4. Choose Document➪Cancel from the menu.
Or, if you want to cancel all pending documents, choose Printer➪
Cancel All Documents.
5. Wait.
It may take a few moments for the last bit of text to print. But, seriously, if the
printer continues to spew out pages at this point, just turn it off. Wait a few
seconds, and then turn it back on again.

T
ime was that the computer modem was an obscure peripheral. I’m not kid-
ding! With the dawn of the Internet, and the popularity of the Web and
e-mail, the once neglected modem moved from an optional extra to a vital part
of every computer. The big deal is communications. In fact, it’s the modem that
brought the world of the Internet to the desktop computer, and that’s what
helped bring more desktop computers into homes and the workplace.
Modems are no longer considered optional components in a PC. Not only
that, modems are so common that they now sport first names: dial-up, DSL,
cable, and satellite. Obviously, modems are important; hence, this whole
chapter covers the big deal with modems.
What Does a Modem Do?
The main reason for having a modem now is to get your computer connected
to the Internet. In fact, that would be the cheap description: The modem is
the box through which your PC yells at the Internet and from which the
Internet yells back. Simple enough.

The modem’s secret job, the one it would have if it were a superhero, is trans-
lator. What it does is transform the crude language of ones and zeroes inside
the computer into something that can be sent out over the phone lines, over
your cable TV wire, or even straight up into outer space. Then, at the other
end of the line, another modem retranslates those signals into information
the computer can understand, and — long story short — you have two com-
puters talking with each other.
The modem does its job so well that it doesn’t even have any buttons on it,
other than maybe an on–off switch (if that). Modems do, however, have
lights. The lights let you know that the computer is on, connected, transmit-
ting information, and other various things.
 Modem is a combination of two words: modulator and demodulator. No
one really cares about the further, technical details.
 As with all PC hardware, you need software to control the PC’s modem.
Modem software is now mainly used to get the modem to connect with
the Internet.
 High-speed modems don’t modulate or demodulate any more. Those
modems communicate entirely with digital signals.
 It’s still possible to use dial-up modems as they were used through-
out the early part of PC history: You can use your modem to dial into
another PC, as long as that PC is set up with a modem to answer the
phone and provide software to give you something to do. Various online
BBS and personal systems still exist in many cities, though the number
is rapidly dwindling. The telecommunications program in Windows is
called HyperTerminal, and it can be found on the Start button’s All
Programs➪Accessories➪Communications menu.
Types of Modem
On TV and in the movies, they typically show the old acoustic coupler type of
modem, the kind in which you would rest a telephone handset. One is shown
in the popular movie WarGames. It’s a great visual, but those modems were
horrible! They picked up too many sounds from the room, and, because the
phone company stopped making standard telephones, few phone handsets
would fit into the old acoustic couplers. Thank goodness those days are over.
The modems of today are difficult to recognize on sight. I can’t really provide
a generic description. Some are expansion cards dwelling inside the com-
puter, and others are uninspired beige or gray boxes sitting outside the com-
puter. There are, however, two distinct modem categories:
 Dial-up
 Broadband
164
Part II: Computer Guts 

Dial-up is the traditional type of modem that uses the telephone system.
Broadband includes all high-speed modems, whether they’re cable, DSL, or
satellite modems. These are discussed in this section.
The traditional dial-up modem
Dial-up modems are called such because they use standard telephone lines to
transmit and receive information. That’s the way modems worked for years,
and it was the only type of modem available to personal computer users until
cable and DSL came around in the late 1990s.
Nearly all PCs sold come with a dial-up modem preinstalled. The modem cir-
cuitry is either part of the chipset on the motherboard, or it dwells in an
expansion slot, with its circuitry living on an expansion card. This type of
modem is known as an internal modem because it dwells inside the PC’s
bosom. External dial-up modems are available as well, which live in a box 
outside the console, though they’re rapidly becoming more rare.
Whether internal or external, dial-up modems assume one of the PC’s serial
or COM ports. That’s the interface through which the modem communicates
with the rest of the computer.
The advantages of a dial-up modem are that you can use them anywhere that
you have telephone service. Simply plug the modem into the wall, and you
can make phone calls with the computer just as you can yourself. No extra
charges apply (well, other than long distance or other standard phone fees).
Also, dial-up is the least expensive way to get on the Internet.
The disadvantage of a dial-up modem is that it’s slow when compared to
other ways of accessing the Internet.
 Computer geeks may refer to a dial-up modem as being narrowband,
which is play on the term broadband (for faster modems).
 The plain old telephone system modem is also known as a POTS modem.
POTS stands for Plain Old Telephone System.
Faster than a speeding phone bill:
Broadband modems
High-speed modems fall under the category of broadband modems. These
modems use a special means to connect to the Internet at top speeds. Their
only downside is that you must live in an area that provides broadband ser-
vice and you pay more for access than you do with a dial-up modem.
165
Chapter 13: The Mighty Morphin’ Power Modem

Three common broadband services are available: cable, DSL, and satellite.
Each comes with its own type of modem.
Cable: This type of modem is the fastest you can buy, often faster than the
computer can keep up with! The only downside is that when more of your
neighbors begin using their cable modems, the overall speed decreases. But
at 2 a.m., your cable modem smokes!
DSL: This type of modem gives you fast access by taking advantage of unused
frequencies in existing phone lines. The modem hooks up to the phone line,
but all other phones on that line require special filters. This type is easy to
install and, next to cable, gives you the fastest connection speeds.
Satellite: Combined with an outdoor antenna and a subscription to the satel-
lite service, this is one of the fastest modem options available. Try to get a
satellite modem that provides both sending and receiving abilities. Avoid
satellite service that is “download only.”
Regardless of the broadband service, you pay more for the extra speed than
you do with dial-up. First, you pay for the modem itself (though many are
“free”). This isn’t bad because DSL modems cost about $100 and most cable
companies rent their modems. Satellite modems, however, are spendy
because they also include the satellite dish and its hardware.
Second, you have to pay the company that provides the service: your phone
company for DSL, your cable company for cable, and your satellite company
for a satellite modem. They may offer various speed levels at different prices;
the faster the speed, the more you pay. But if you use the Internet a lot, it’s
worth it!
 Broadband is synonymous with high-speed Internet access.
 DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. It has variations, such as ADSL and
other something-DSL options. Your phone company knows more about
this matter than I do. Basically, everyone calls it DSL, no matter what.
Modem speed
Modem speed is measured in kilobits per second. That’s kilobits, not kilobytes.
To give you an idea of how fast that is, 100 kilobits is about as much informa-
tion as you see on a line of text in this book. If this book were appearing on
166
Part II: Computer Guts 

your screen through your modem, one line per second, you would have a
connection that flies by at 100 kilobits per second, or 100 Kbps.
The slowest modem you can buy now is a dial-up model that whizzes out
information at 56 Kbps. That modem can transmit approximately 14 pages of
printed information every second.
The fastest modem you can buy (or rent) is a cable modem that whizzes
along at 5,000 Kbps, also written as 5 Mbps (megabits per second). That’s
many, many pages of information per second, or enough speed to display a
real-time video image with sound.
 A modem’s speed rating is for comparison purposes only. Rarely do
modems crank out information as fast as they’re rated. It happens, but
rarely. For example, a 56 Kbps dial-up modem usually chugs along at
about 48 Kbps. That’s normal.
 Values over 1,000 Kbps may be written as 1 Mbps, or 1 megabit per second.
Sometimes, the M and K are written in lowercase: kbps and mbps.
 For dial-up modems, the connection speed is displayed by Windows
whenever the modem connects. You can also point the mouse at the tiny
modem icon on the system tray to see your connection speed.
 You can gauge your broadband modem speed online by visiting a site
such as www.dslreports.com.
167
Chapter 13: The Mighty Morphin’ Power Modem
What’s a null modem?
A null modem isn’t a modem at all. In fact, it’s
either a tiny adapter or a cable that works like a
standard serial port (COM) cable, but with its
wires reversed. Also called twisted pair, a null
modem is designed to connect two computers
for direct communications.
For example, if you’re moving files from an older
PC to a newer system and the older system
lacks network access or a CD-R (both of which
make transferring files easier), you can pur-
chase a null modem cable at an office supply
store along with file transfer software and use
them to send files between the two systems.

Installing a Modem
Setting up a modem is so easy that most elected officials can do it in a matter
of days. You can do it faster, of course, an individual who is unused to making
decisions in committee.
Connecting the modem to the console
Modems are easy to connect to the computer: Dial-up modems connect to
the telephone jack on the wall; broadband modems connect to the network
port, or RJ-45 jack. For more details, refer to Chapter 3.
 Cable, DSL, and satellite modems are external, so they all must be
plugged into a wall socket somewhere. As a suggestion, I recommend
plugging them into a UPS, which helps keep their signals going during
intermittent power outages.
 Generally speaking, broadband modems are left on all the time. There’s
no point in turning them on or off. In fact, doing so may cause the broad-
band service to phone you up to see whether everything is okay.
 Be sure to put the filters, or “dongles,” on each phone that shares the
line with the DSL modem. If you don’t, you have difficulty hearing phone
conversations on that line.
Telling Windows about 
your dial-up modem
Windows automatically recognizes USB and certain internal modems. For
external modems and those few unruly internal modems, you must manually
set things up. That’s done by opening the Phone and Modem Options icon in
the Control Panel and then clicking the Modems tab.
To manually add a new modem, click the Add button on the Modems tab in
the Phone and Modem Options dialog box. That runs one of the Windows
wizards; work through the wizard to have it detect and install your modem.
My advice is to not have the wizard automatically detect your modem; just
select it from the list of manufacturers and models or use the CD that came
with the modem.
168
Part II: Computer Guts 

After installation, the modem is ready for use in Windows. Its name appears
on the list of modems in the Phone and Modem Options dialog box.
 The best way to use a modem is with its own phone line. Just about
every house or apartment can have a second line added without having
to pay for extra wiring. If so, have your phone company hook up that
line and use it for your modem. Why? Because —
 You can’t use your phone while your modem is talking. In fact, if some-
body picks up another extension on that line, it garbles the signal and
may lose your connection — not to mention that the human hears a
horrid screeching sound. Also see the section “Dialing Rules from Here
to Eternity,” later in this chapter.
 If Windows ever seems to lose track of your modem, restart your PC.
Often, that helps Windows find a lost modem. If you have an external
dial-up modem, turn it off and then on again, and Windows may sud-
denly find it.
Telling Windows about your 
broadband modem
Broadband modems are really more of a networking thing than a modem
thing. As such, the broadband modem is configured when you set up your
computer for the Internet. The best place to look for that information is in
Chapter 18.
Dialing Rules from Here to Eternity
When you think about it, the telephone system is rather smart. Witness that
there’s no Enter key on your telephone. The phone system is smart enough
to know when you dial a local, long distance, or even international number. It
just knows!
169
Chapter 13: The Mighty Morphin’ Power Modem
The universal broadband modem fix
Broadband modems are fairly robust and reli-
able, but they do occasionally go down. An easy
and simple fix is to turn your modem off, wait,
and then turn it back on again. Often, that sup-
plies the kick necessary to get the modem up
and running.

A dial-up modem also needs to know about dialing local and long distance
numbers. But, unlike the telephone, your modem needs to be instructed
about certain things so that it can properly deal with them. This section pro-
vides some hints and helpful examples.
Setting a location for your dial-up modem
Your modem needs to know a little bit about how to dial phone numbers.
Even if you don’t plan to dial any other number than the one you use to con-
nect to the Internet, it’s a good idea to follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Phone and Modem Options icon.
2. If no location is entered, click the New button to create a new loca-
tion; otherwise, select the current location and click the Edit button.
Either way, a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 13-1 appears.
3. Type a name for your location.
My favorite name is “In my chair,” but most folks put “Home” or “Office”
or “Las Vegas Office” for when they’re supposed to be working but are
really gambling.
Figure 13-1:
Set dial-up
modem
rules here.
170
Part II: Computer Guts 

4. Fill in the rest of the material on the General tab, as necessary.
Choose your country or region and enter the area code for your loca-
tion’s phone number or the area code for the line you’re dialing out on
(if your locality has more than one area code).
Optionally, enter the numbers to disable call waiting, if you have call
waiting on the modem’s phone line. Specify Tone or Pulse.
If you plan to phone more than just your ISP with the modem, you may
want to enter information on the Area Code Rules tab in the Location
dialog box. If you plan on staying put, you’re pretty much done now.
5. Click OK.
You need to specify only the most basic information for your dial-up modem,
especially if you plan to keep the computer in one spot and only dial into the
Internet.
Laptop computers are an exception to the one-location rule. For information
on properly configuring a laptop computer to dial from multiple locations,
refer to my best-selling tome Laptops For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.),
available at fine bookstores all over, as well as at Barnes & Noble.
Dealing with call waiting
Call waiting is a handy feature to have for humans, but it can knock a com-
puter’s modem offline faster than you can clear a room by saying “I’m with
Amway.” Technically, the call waiting tone is what disrupts the modem 
connection.
The best way to disable call waiting is described in the preceding subsec-
tion’s Step 4: Put a check mark by the item labeled To Disable Call Waiting.
Then specify the proper code for your area, either *70 or 70#, or 1170 for
pulse dialing.
You don’t need to worry about call waiting when you’re using a broadband
modem.
Another way to deal with call waiting is to use software that lets you hear
who’s calling you while you’re online. Visit www.callwave.com or
www.buzme.com for more information on that type of product.
171
Chapter 13: The Mighty Morphin’ Power Modem

Dealing with “local” long distance
Phone companies seem to delight in forcing us to dial our own area codes for
local long distance. To deal with this situation, use the Area Code Rules tab 
in the Edit Location dialog box (refer to Figure 13-1). Click the New button to
display the New Area Code Rule dialog box, and then fill in the items required
for dialing area codes that are required for your part of the country. That’s 
it — well, at least until the next time they change the rules.

T
he hills are alive, with the sound of PC. . . .
Way back when, computer manufacturers often debated whether their new
machines should have a speaker. Even the cheapest speakers added cost to
the product. In the end, the voice of the users spoke the loudest: They
wanted computers that made sound!
The early PCs had speakers and simple sound-generation hardware. Later, at
about the time of the multimedia craze of the early 1990s, PCs came with
built-in synthesizers and quite fancy sound-generating circuitry. That’s all
pretty standard on PCs now, as well as quality stereo speakers and those all-
important subwoofers. This chapter covers the whole spectrum of PC sound
in as quiet a manner as possible.
Your PC Can Make Noise
Your PC makes noise by using a sound system composed of many parts, both
hardware and software. In a way, the sound system is similar to the video
system: The speakers, like the monitor, are only the external parts. Much
more goes on inside the console, as discussed in this section.

Noisy hardware
A PC includes sound-generation hardware on its chipset, which comes soldered
to the motherboard. The sound hardware includes the ability to process and
play digitally recorded sounds, CD music, as well as an on-board synthesizer for
generating music. For most folks, it’s about all you really need in order to use
the computer, play games, listen to music, and have some fun.
More advanced sound hardware can be added to any PC via an expansion
card. This sound upgrade is necessary only for diehard audiophiles, people
who are composing their own music or are using their PCs as the heart of
their audio studios. Otherwise, the sound hardware that comes on the
chipset is just hunky and dory for everyone.
 The standard for PC audio is the SoundBlaster series of audio cards,
manufactured by Creative Labs. Nearly all PC sound hardware is now
Sound Blaster compatible.
 Standard PC sound is sampled at 16 bits. All you need to know is that 16
bits is a great rate, much better than 8 bits. Yes, 32 bits are available, but
are necessary only for those interested in high-end audio work.
 If your PC lacks expansion slots, you can upgrade your audio by adding
an external, USB sound device, such as the Sound Blaster Audigy
system. This is one way to add better sound to a laptop computer.
Speakers here and there
Most PCs come with a tiny, awful internal speaker. It’s a backup. It exists just
in case you don’t connect external speakers to the system. That way, in an
act of typical computer desperation, the thing can meekly bleep at you. Sad,
but true.
On the other hand, your PC most likely came with external stereo speakers. If
not, or if the quality was just too crude for your refined tastes, you can
upgrade the speakers to include a subwoofer or maybe even surround sound.
Golly! The things you can spend money on these days. . . .
Figure 14-1 illustrates a typical PC speaker setup. Note that the left and right
speakers are positioned on the left and right sides of the monitor as you’re
facing the monitor.
174
Part II: Computer Guts 

In Figure 14-1, the sound output from the console goes first to the subwoofer
and then to the left and right speakers. Sometimes the sound goes into one of
the speakers first, and then into the subwoofer. And, sometimes the left
speaker is wired directly to the right speaker (or vice versa). In other words,
there is no standard for connecting speakers. Typical.
One step beyond the left-right-subwoofer speaker configuration is Dolby sur-
round sound, similar to the sound setup for a home theater. In that configura-
tion, left, right, and center speakers are by the computer. Behind it, you have
left and right surround speakers. A subwoofer completes the system.
The Dolby surround sound is necessary only when both the PC’s hardware
and software support it. There are two standards: Dolby 5.1, which supports
five speakers and one subwoofer; and Dolby 6.1, which adds a sixth speaker,
rear-center.

Chapter 14: Sounds Like

 Any cheap-o set of stereo speakers works on a PC. If you enjoy listening
to music on the computer, I would pay more and get a nicer set of speak-
ers and a subwoofer.
 Run your speakers electrically rather than through batteries. If your speak-
ers didn’t come with an AC power adapter, you can usually buy one.
 I recommend getting speakers that have a volume control, either on the
left or right speaker. Another bonus: a mute button on the speaker. Note
that some high-end speaker systems have a remote control that has the
volume and mute buttons on it.
 Speakers built into the PC’s monitor are typically terrible.
 Subwoofer? It’s a speaker box, typically sitting on the floor beneath your
PC. It amplifies sounds at the low end of the spectrum. Subwoofers give
oomph to the bass in music, and for games, they truly add emphasis to
the horde of football players sacking your quarterback.
 Refer to Chapter 3 to find out where exactly the speakers plug in.
 If you have a DVD expansion card on your PC, be sure to plug the speak-
ers into that card.
 Refer to my book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.) if you’re having trouble hearing sounds from your PC.
Microphone options
Any cheesy microphone works on a PC. If sound quality is important to you
and you’re using your PC as a digital audio studio, you have to spend money
on microphones and mixers and all that. But if that’s not you, any old micro-
phone does the trick.
 Two popular types of microphones are used on a PC: condenser and
dynamic. Condenser mics can be plugged right into the PC’s mic jack.
Dynamic microphones require amplification and may work when plugged
into the Line In jack, but may require a pre-amplifier for them to work best.
 If you plan to use voice over the Internet or dictation, get a microphone-
headset combination. That way, you can chatter without having to mess
with holding the microphone or setting up a mic stand near your PC.
Having Fun with Sound in Windows
If you have time to waste, you can turn your serious business computer into
a goofy business computer by adding sounds to Windows. This is one area
where you can waste eons of time. Of course, keep in mind that this is
Important Computer Configuration, not something you’re having fun with.
176
Part II: Computer Guts 

The types of files that contain noise
Sound recorded on a computer is merely raw data — digital information
recorded on a hard drive as opposed to analog information you find on a cas-
sette tape. Like other data, sound is kept in a file. Three primary types of
audio files are used for the PC: WAV, MP3, and MIDI.
WAV: This is a basic wave, or audio, file, which simply contains a digital
sound sampling. Most sounds you hear in Windows, or even sounds you
record yourself, are WAV files, pronounced “wave” files.
MP3: These special compressed WAV files take up less space on disk. A typi-
cal MP3 file occupies 1MB of disk space for every minute of sound contained
inside. These files contain mostly audio tracks from CDs or other sound
sources; any type of sound can find its way into the MP3 format.
MIDI: This synthesized music file format doesn’t contain sound. Instead, the
MIDI (“MIH-dee”) files contain instructions that are read by the sound hard-
ware’s synthesizer, which then plays back the song as a musician would read
sheet music.
You can find other sound file formats, such as AU and AIFF and too many
more to mention. The three in the preceding list are the most popular with
Windows.
 Windows keeps its sound files in the My Music folder, which you find
inside the My Documents folder. See Chapter 21 for more information on
folders.
 MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It’s the standard for
electronically generated music.
 Software exists to record sounds as well as convert the sounds from one
file format to another. One useful and free program I can recommend is
Audacity, a free digital audio editor:
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
 By the way, sound files take up huge amounts of room on a disk. That’s
why most digitized sounds are limited to short bursts, like golf swings
and grunts.
Playing sounds in Windows
Playing any sound file in Windows is easy: Just double-click to open the file.
The sound plays in the Windows Media Player program. Use the controls in
Media Player to start, stop, and repeat the audio files you open. Media Player
works just like a stereo or CD player, and the buttons are labeled the same.

 See Chapter 24 for information on creating playlists of music in Media
Player.
 A great alternative to Media Player is the MUSICMATCH Jukebox pro-
gram, available from www.musicmatch.com.
The Windows sounds playground
You can assign sounds to various events, actions, or things you do inside the
Windows operating system. The playground where that happens is the Sounds
and Audio Devices Properties dialog box, found on any Control Panel near you:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Sounds and Audio Devices icon.
2. Click the Sounds tab.
The dialog box sports a scrolling list of events, which are various things
done by Windows or your applications. You can apply a specific sound
to any of those events so that when such-and-such an event takes place,
a specific sound is played.
For example, the Critical Stop event — a bad one in Windows — is high-
lighted in Figure 14-2. The sound associated with that event appears on
the Sounds drop-down list as Windows XP Critical Stop.wav. That’s
the WAV file that plays when Windows stops critically.
3. Select an event to assign a sound to.
For example, select the New Mail Notification, which is the sound that
plays when Outlook Express picks up new e-mail.
Figure 14-2:
Assigning

178
Part II: Computer Guts 

4. Test the current sound, if any.
To test the sound, click the Play button.
5. Assign a new sound.
To assign a new sound to an event, click the Browse button. That lets
you “go out on disk” to seek out a specific sound.
You can also choose from one of the preselected sounds on the Sounds
drop-down list (where Windows XP Critical Stop.wav appears in
Figure 14-2).
6. Click the OK button when you’re done assigning sounds.
Windows comes with various sound schemes. Each one has a whole set of
assigned sounds, specific to the theme of the sound scheme. That way, you
can select a whole symphony of sounds at one time by choosing a scheme
from the Scheme drop-down list.
You can create your own, personalized sound scheme by saving your particu-
lar favorite sounds as their own scheme. To do this, after assigning your indi-
vidual sounds, click the Save As button in the Sounds and Audio Devices
Properties dialog box, on the Sounds tab. Give the scheme a name and then
click OK. That way, you can instantly recover your favorite sounds by choos-
ing that same scheme again.
 To remove a sound from an event, choose (None) from the top of the
Sounds drop-down list.
 If you can’t find an event on the list, you cannot assign a sound to it.
 The Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog box is used to assign
sounds to events — specifically, WAV files. Windows isn’t equipped to
play MIDI or MP3 files for certain events.
 The best source for sounds is the Internet, where you can find Web page
libraries full of sound samples. Go to Google (www.google.com/) and
search for “Windows WAV file sounds” to find them.
 See the section “Recording Your Own Sounds,” later in this chapter, for
more information about recording sounds.
Adjusting the volume
Determining how loud your PC plays sounds is done in two places. The first
place is a hardware place: the sound volume knob on your PC’s speakers or
on the subwoofer — though that’s only when such a knob exists.
The second spot for adjusting the volume is the Volume icon, found on the
system tray. It looks like a tiny speaker.
179
Chapter 14: Sounds Like

To set the volume, click the Volume icon once. Use the slider in the pop-up
window to increase (up) or decrease (down) the volume. Or, just click the
slider bar to get an idea of how loud the sound is set now.
To mute the sound, click to put a check mark in the Mute box.
Click anywhere else on the desktop to make the pop-up window go away.
If the Volume thingy doesn’t appear on the system tray, open the Control
Panel’s Sounds and Audio Devices icon. Click the Volume tab and click to put
a check mark next to the option labeled Place Volume Icon in the Taskbar.
Using the master volume control
To specifically control the volume or individual sound-producing devices,
you need to use what I call the master volume control, as shown in Figure
14-3. It’s where you can set the volume for various types of sound sources in
Windows, mute specific sources, or adjust stereo settings. It’s powerful and
mysterious, like that special flavor ingredient that makes you crave KFC.
The master volume control displays a whole window full of squeaking and
squawking things in Windows, each with its own volume setting slider and
Mute button. Set things individually as you see fit.
For example, if you detest having MIDI music play while you’re on the
Internet (or anywhere), just mute that one item. All other sounds in your
system continue to play, but MIDI sounds are muted.

Part II: Computer Guts 

 Yes, I know that the window is named Play Control in Figure 14-3, but I
prefer calling it the master volume control. Someday, Microsoft will see
the light and agree with me on this subject.
 Use the Options➪Properties command to set which sound-producing
devices in your PC appear in the volume master control window.
Recording Your Own Sounds
Thanks to the sound input jacks on the PC’s console, you can use your com-
puter to record any type of sound. All you need is a patch cable to connect a
sound-producing device to the audio inputs on your PC.
 To record your own voice, plug a microphone into the Mic In or ampli-
fied line-input jack.
 To record from any other device, plug it into the Line In or unamplified
input jack.
On the software side, you need a program that lets you record from the sound
circuitry inputs. I recommend the Audacity program (mentioned earlier in
this chapter). Windows also has a silly little program that does this, named
Sound Recorder.
Recording software on the computer works just like using a tape recording in
the real world. To record, you prepare the sound source or get ready at the
microphone, and then you click a Record button on the screen (generally, a
red dot). To stop recording, click the Stop button (a black square). To hear
the sound, use the Play button (a triangle).
Save your work to disk by choosing the File➪Save As command, just as you
would with any file in any application.
 I say that Sound Recorder is silly because it lets you record only one
minute of sound at a time. To record for longer than a minute, refer to
this Web page: www.wambooli.com/help/pc/sound_recorder/.
 Sound files are huge! Although playing and collecting sounds is fun, be
aware that they occupy lots of disk space.
Getting the PC to Talk and Listen
Sound. Speakers. Microphone. Perhaps the day you can actually yell at the PC
and have it be moved by your passion isn’t too far away. Until then, consider
this section on the state of the PC’s cybernetic mouth and ears.

Can it talk?
Your PC is more than capable of speaking. The sound card can be programmed
to emulate the human voice, usually by running some voice utility that came
with the sound card. Sadly, if your PC lacks such a program, few other good
alternatives are available.
Windows XP comes with a speech program named Narrator. Rather than a
toy, however, Narrator is designed to be a tool to assist the visually impaired
with using a computer. To run Narrator, from the Start panel choose the
Programs command and then Accessories➪Accessibility➪Narrator. The pro-
gram starts, and begins by immediately reading the window it starts in. To
close Narrator, keep closing its windows until it’s gone.
Does it listen?
Some programs let you talk to your PC. You talk, and the program fairly accu-
rately interprets your speech as text right on the screen. The technology has
been available for about 10 years now, yet it’s still crude, in my opinion.
Eats till Vera crew din Maya pinion.
The biggest problem with dictation is that you must train the computer to
understand your voice. It requires — at minimum — three hours of reading
aloud into the computer while it analyzes your speech patterns. (That’s a long
time; keep a glass of water handy.) On the plus side, the more you train the PC,
the better it gets at interpreting your speech. Do you have the time to invest?
 Speech recognition software is included with Microsoft Office XP and
Office 2003. The programs add two new icons on the Control Panel:
Speech and Text Services. Each one controls how the PC communicates,
either by reading text or accepting audio input.
 Another popular dictation package is Dragon Naturally Speaking, at
www.scansoft.com.
 Dictation works best with a headset microphone.
 People who get the most from dictation software spend at least 9 to 12
hours training the computer to understand them.
 For a fast typist, such as myself, talking software doesn’t really work. I
find talking mode and typing mode to be two different things. Also, I
change my mind a lot, which means that I’m always editing my own text
as I write it, something the dictation software is rather poor at.

T
he success of the original IBM PC was due to its openness. The PC’s soft-
ware and hardware documentation were available to anyone who wanted
it. By publishing the “specs,” IBM encouraged lots of folks to make new hard-
ware and write new software for its fledgling machine. The results paid off,
and the PC has since become the most popular computer hardware and soft-
ware platform ever.
The PC’s expandability continues to this day. Thanks to its internal expansion
slots and versatile expansion ports, like USB, you can continue to add new
goodies to your basic computer system. This chapter covers some of the
more popular options, or peripherals, that you can have on your PC.
The Wide, Wide World of Peripherals
Peripheral refers to anything outside the main. For example, the peripheral
nervous system is made up of all the nerves in your body outside your brain
(which is called the central nervous system). Peripheral vision includes things
you can see without looking directly at them. And, peripheral nervous vision
is what first-time buyers get when they enter the computer store. On a com-
puter, however, a peripheral is any accessory or auxiliary equipment you may
buy and connect to the computer.

The variety of peripherals you can buy for your computer is endless. Common
peripheral items include scanners, disk drives of all types, digital cameras,
videocameras, and numerous other toys you can connect to the typical PC.
 All peripherals are hardware.
 Many devices that were once considered peripheral are now considered
part of the basic computer system: The mouse and modem, for example,
were once optional peripherals.
 Peripherals enable you to expand your computer system without having
to buy a totally new computer. You can add these extra hardware
devices yourself or have a guru, computer consultant, or some other
overpaid individual do it for you.
 Although the word peripheral refers to things outside a computer, you can
also add peripherals internally — inside the PC’s console. (In a way, periph-
eral refers to anything beyond what comes standard in the computer.)
Installing a peripheral
The hardware side of adding a peripheral is cinchy. Most peripherals sit out-
side the PC. All you need to do to connect them is find the proper hole and
plug the thing in.
Granted, you need to follow other instructions when adding a peripheral, but
plugging the thing into the proper port is usually part of the action.
Because peripherals can also live inside the PC, installing one may involve open-
ing the console and plugging in an expansion card. Again, this process isn’t that
tough, but it’s not the sign of a PC wimp if you pay someone else to do it.
 Most peripherals plug into standard connectors on the back of every PC.
Refer to Chapter 3.
 USB peripherals are the easiest by far to install. You don’t even need to
turn off your PC: Just plug in the cable, and you’re on your way. Refer to
Chapter 7 for the details.
Telling Windows about your new hardware
The yin and yang of your computer are hardware and software. You normally
cannot add hardware to the computer without having to do some kind of soft-
ware addition or adjustment as well. Fortunately, with Windows XP, the soft-
ware is the easy part; Windows often instantly recognizes new software and
sets things up for you automatically.
184
Part II: Computer Guts 

Regardless of Windows automatic detection, please read the installation
instructions that come with any new hardware. Sometimes, nothing else is
required, and sometimes, you need to first install special software. How do
you know for certain? Read the instruction sheet!
 The Windows capability to instantly recognize new peripherals is known
as plug and play.
 The software that controls your hardware is a driver. When someone
says “Windows needs a new driver,” he’s not insulting you as the com-
puter operator.
“Windows is stupid and doesn’t 
recognize my new peripheral!”
In some cases, Windows plays dumb and refuses to recognize new hardware.
It could mean that the hardware wasn’t properly set up, that the hardware is
broken, or, most likely, that you’re installing something that doesn’t grab the
computer’s attention directly, such as an external dial-up modem.
When Windows refuses to recognize the new hardware, you should run the
Add Hardware Wizard. Open the Control Panel and then double-click the Add
Hardware icon to run the wizard.
As the wizard runs, read the screen. It’s important advice! Click the Next
button or select options as necessary. In mere moments, your new hardware
should be up and running, and everything is groovy.
The Big Decision point in the Add Hardware Wizard is whether to let Windows
look for the new hardware or select it yourself from a list. Sometimes, it’s
tempting to taunt Windows: “Go ahead! Find that hardware! I dare you to find
it! I double-dog dare you!” At other times, plucking the device from a list on
your own is easier and quicker.
Popular Peripherals
With each edition of this book, the list of popular peripherals grows shorter.
It’s not that fewer peripherals are being made, it’s that more and more things
that were once considered peripherals are now standard features on most
computers.
For peripheral motivation, you need go no further than your local computer
or office supply store. There, you find inspiration lining the aisles, and if not,
you can peruse the remaining sections of this chapter for enlightenment.
185
Chapter 15: Even More Hardware!

External disk drives
You can easily expand your system’s storage: Just plug in another disk drive!
Adding a CD-R, CD-RW, hard drive, DVD, media card reader, or multiple com-
binations of each one is a snap.
The best way to add external storage is via the USB port. (If your PC lacks a
USB port, buy a USB expansion card for $20 and you’re in business!) With the
USB port, you can add as many external storage devices as your credit card
can afford.
One major bonus for external storage devices is that they can survive your
current computer setup. For example, my external FireWire hard drive may
outlive my current computer and end up plugged into next year’s model. 
That way, I don’t have to copy over my software; instead, I just plug in the
FireWire drive.
It’s live, and it’s living 
on top of your monitor!
An interesting toy to add to your PC is a videocamera. These little mechani-
cal eyeballs perch near your PC, usually on top of the monitor. You can use
them to record movies or single images or to send live images over the
Internet — it all depends on the software that comes with the camera.
 If you want one of those cameras that sends pictures to the Web, you
want a Webcam. I have such a device in my office, which you can view by
visiting www.wambooli.com/fun/live/.
 Note that a difference exists between a cheap little monitor-top video-
camera and a digital videocamera used to create movies. I’m not sure
what the technical differences are, but pricewise, one is about $50 and
the other is about $200 (and up).
 Make sure that the software you need is included with the camera. For
example, videoconferencing is possible only with the proper software.
The camera is just a device; you need software to play with it.
Scan this, Mr. Spock!
Scanners are nifty little devices that work like photocopiers. Rather than
make a copy, the scanner converts the image into a graphics image that’s
then stored in your computer. From there, you can modify the image, save it
186
Part II: Computer Guts 

to disk, add it to a document, or send it off as an e-mail attachment. That’s
the big picture.
Figure 15-1 illustrates the typical computer scanner, not because you may be
unfamiliar with what it looks like, but more because I really like that illustration.

Chapter 15: Even More Hardware!
“I have some money, and I want to 
upgrade my hardware”
Your computer should last you a good four to six
years. At that time, the components start to go:
First, the hard drive, and then other things as
well. Also, after that length of time, the new
technology that’s available is so much better
than your current computer that it just makes
sense to buy something new. In the mean-
time, you can upgrade some of your computer’s 
components — if you have the money.
The first thing to upgrade is memory. Adding
more memory to a PC improves its performance
no matter how much memory you have already.
Computers just love memory, and the bottom
line is always “more is better.”
The second thing to upgrade is the hard drive.
Rather than replace your PC’s existing hard
drive, install a second internal drive or add an
external USB drive. The extra capacity can be
used for storing greedy files, such as music,
video, and graphics.
The last thing to spend money on is the micro-
processor. Though you can upgrade most PCs’
microprocessors, it’s not really cost effective.
Again, the price of a new computer is often
better than forking over a paycheck for the CPU
alone.
For more information on upgrading, refer to my
book Buying a Computer For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.). That book not only tells you
how to upgrade your computer, but also
explains how to buy a computer correctly in the
first place so that you don’t have to worry about
upgrading it later.

You should consider a few important points when getting a scanner. Here’s
the short list:
 Scanners are judged by their resolution, which is measured by the number
of dots per inch (dpi) the scanner can read. The higher the dpi resolu-
tion, the better the scanned image.
 If you plan on scanning film negatives or transparencies, be sure to get a
scanner with a negative/transparency adapter.
 Scanners come with software. You usually get three packages. The first
is a utility that lets you use the scanner to scan in an image. The second
is typically some type of photo-editing program, such as Adobe
Photoshop Elements. The third is an OCR program, which is used to
translate written documents into editable text.
 OCR stands for optical character recognition.
 Typical scanner prices range from $50 to more than $1,000. You pay
more for higher-quality scanners, but those are used mostly by graphics
professionals. Also, high-priced scanners contain options like sheet feed-
ers (for law offices or other outfits that need to scan in large quantities
of text).
 Don’t let anyone fool you into believing that adding a scanner can turn
your PC into a photocopier. True, you can scan an image and then print
that image. But the process takes more time than it would to drive to the
copy store and make a few copies. (Well, maybe not that long, but scan-
ning and printing aren’t the fastest things the PC does.)
Everyone say “megabyte!” 
(Digital cameras)
The latest PC craze is the digital camera. These wonderful toys not only have
come down drastically in price, but the quality of the images they take is also
rivaling traditional cameras.
Digital cameras range in price from you-don’t-want-it cheap to well over
$1,000 for professional setups. The average price for a decent digital camera
is between $200 and $800.
Look for three things in a digital camera: resolution, image storage, and how
the image gets transferred from the camera to your computer.
Resolution: The ready gauge of a digital camera’s resolution is the MP, or
megapixel. For example, a 3MP camera can shoot high-quality images that
can be enlarged to the photo-quality 8 x 10 inches. Higher MP values can
188
Part II: Computer Guts 

shoot higher-resolution images that can be enlarged even more. Lower MP
values, although they can take pictures okay for e-mail, just don’t look good
when they’re enlarged.
Image storage: For “digital film,” most cameras use a digital media card capa-
ble of storing many megabytes of pictures. You can remove and replace the
card — just like film — which allows the camera to take an infinite number of
pictures.
Beaming the image to the computer: The most important thing to consider
when selecting a digital camera is how the image is transferred from the camera
into the computer. Most cameras use a special cable (such as a USB cable)
that you use to send the images to the computer. Or, they may employ a device
that reads the memory card and mounts it like a disk drive on your PC.
Here are some other digital camera points to ponder:
 Avoid any digital camera with a resolution of less than 3MP. Likewise,
unless you’re a professional, don’t bother paying for anything over 6MP.
 Most cameras use LCD viewfinders, which means that you must hold
them away from your face to get an image, like those camcorders that
have LCD viewfinders — same thing.
 Beware of digital cameras with too many confusing and poorly labeled
dials and buttons.
 I prefer using a digital camera that operates using standard batteries.
That way, I can find extra batteries easily. Cameras that use special
rechargeable batteries don’t have such a fast turnaround time (but may
save on battery cost in the long run).
 Buy a few digital media cards so that you always have a spare or three.

’T
was not long ago that the realm of networking was
best left to those geeks at the office who were paid
to know such things. They knew the wires. They knew the
gizmos. They knew the secret commands and could find
the printers and connect to the hard drives. Their white
lab coats were their priestly robes; their clipboards,
sacred tablets. Their utterings were hallowed, their time
was precious. Offerings were made, of chips and pizza. 
All praise the network geek! Om!
Networking today isn’t the big deal it once was. Sure, the
office may still have networking mysteries, such as “Where
is the Exchange server, what is it, and why do I need it?”
But, for basic networking, well, Grandma had to do that
when she hooked up the Internet to her wireless DSL
router and surprised everyone after she sent e-mail from
the back porch while watching Dr. Phil. If Grandma can do
it, so can you. The chapters in this part of the book
explain how it’s done.

omputer networking is just like kindergarten: It’s all about learning to
share with others. You can color in kindergarten, and with a computer
network, you can share a color printer. You may also learn about your ABCs
in kindergarten, and when you share disk drives on a network, you use letters
of the alphabet — all the way up to Z!
Networking makes no sense when you have only one computer. If you have
only one computer and you use a broadband modem — you need to network!
Otherwise, most folks find that they have more than one computer in the
home or office. It just makes sense to use a network so that those computers,
like kids in kindergarten, can share stuff and be nice to each other — well, at
least share stuff.
This chapter provides an overview of basic computer networking using PCs
and Windows.
The Big Networking Picture
Computer networking is about communications. More than that, it deals with
sharing resources. That sounds good. But, what is a resource?

A resource is something a computer uses to get work done. Just about any
component in the computer can be viewed as a resource, but the main
resources are computer memory and disk storage. From reading this book,
you may know that having enough of each one is ideal for any computer.
What networking brings to the PC table is the ability to share certain
resources between several computers. By using a network, you can share
these resources:
 Disk storage
 Printers
 Modems (Internet access)
Regardless of where the disk drives are located, and which computer is con-
nected to the printer or modem, networking allows all those resources to be
shared equally by each computer connected to the network.
The network itself, like everything else in the computer, is a combination of
hardware and software. The hardware is what physically connects the com-
puters and allows communications to take place. The software controls the
hardware, by giving the operating system access to the network and giving
you access to those resources on other computers.
Here are some important network terms to familiarize yourself with:
Ethernet: Many types of networks are available, in different hardware and
software varieties. The networking done on PCs, and described in this part of
the book, is referred to as Ethernet. This networking standard dictates that a
certain type of hardware be used and that certain software rules be obeyed.
The specifics of Ethernet aren’t really important to understanding the whole
networking ball of wax. Just be sure that you say it properly: “EE-thur-net.”
LAN: When you connect a group of computers to form a network, it’s called
local area network, or LAN. You pronounce LAN like land, but without the d at
the end, like how Aunt Minnie pronounced “Land sakes!”
Peer-to-peer network: A network that simply connects computers together 
is known as a peer-to-peer network. In that scheme, no single computer is in
charge; each computer is “on the network,” just like any other computer. Peer-
to-peer contrasts with another scheme called client-server. In that setup, there’s
one main computer, called the server (or a computer that merely runs special
server software). Servers aren’t typically found on peer-to-peer networks,
and this book doesn’t cover using servers or installing server software.
194
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

Networking Hardware
You need, on the hardware side, three different pieces to create the physical
network. Each computer must have a networking adapter, you need wires in
order to connect the adapters, and there’s a central location, or hub, where
all the wires are connected to complete the network. Figure 16-1 illustrates
how the network looks; this section provides the details.

Chapter 16: Basic Painless Networking

Saint NIC
To connect your PC to the network, it must have proper Ethernet networking
hardware. That hardware is called a network information card, or NIC. It may
also be known as an Ethernet card or a network adapter. The circuitry may
indeed be on a separate expansion card, but on most newer PCs, the hard-
ware comes as part of the chipset on the motherboard.
There are two types of NICs. The first is the traditional one, which uses the
RJ-45 adapter. (Refer to Table 2-1, in Chapter 2, for identification.) The second
type is the wireless NIC. Wireless networking is covered in Chapter 19.
 Adding a NIC to a PC is easy; they’re cheap, and you can find one at any
office supply store.
 Get a NIC that configures at 10 or 100 Mbps (megabits per second). The
faster, the better.
Network hoses
Unless you go wireless, you need wires to connect the computers, thus creat-
ing the network. The wire you use is a cable known as CAT 5, or Category-5,
networking cable. One end of the cable plugs into your computer, into the
NIC, and the other plugs into a central location, or hub (covered in the next
subsection).
 Cat 5 cable comes in a variety of lengths and in several bright and cheer-
ful colors.
 Cat 5 networking cable contains eight different wires.
 You can also use Cat 5 networking cable with your telephone system.
 You can get creative in wiring your home or office with networking
cable. I crawled under my house to wire it all up, and I used the attic and
outside walls. You can also buy “raceways” and connectors and boxes if
you don’t want to tear up your walls. (Unless you’re into such things,
though, I recommend having an electrician do it for you.)
 It’s possible — and rather convenient — to run networking cable through
your home’s heating ducts. If you choose to do it this way, be sure that
you buy special high-temperature cable, rugged enough to stand being
inside a heating duct. It’s called plenum cable, and it ain’t cheap.
 Yes, heating ducts are filthy.
 If wiring drives you batty, be smart and go with a wireless type of net-
work, as described in Chapter 19.
196
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

Hubs, switches, and routers
All the network wires from each PC’s NIC shoot back to a central location, 
the heart of the network. At that location is a box into which all the network
wires plug, effectively connecting all the computers. That box is known as a
hub, as shown earlier, in Figure 16-1.
A hub is basically a dumb box that contains the proper wiring to allow your
computer’s networking hardware and software run the network. Sure, you
could just try tying all those cables into one huge knot, but that has been
proven not to work. And, soldering all the wires together seriously slows
down network speed. No, a hub is the thing.
For a bit more money, you can buy a smarter version of a hub, called a switch.
It does the same thing as the hub, but it contains more brains and allows
your networking to run faster and more efficiently.
The smartest type of hub you can buy is a router. It’s quite sophisticated and
has the brains to not only manage hundreds of networked computers but
also deal with Internet traffic.
Which should you get? Easy: If you have only two computers and speed isn’t
an issue, get a hub. If you want better performance, get a switch. If the net-
work is connected to the Internet, a router is a must.
The Software Side of Networking
Fortunately, Windows XP has the best networking software of any version of
Windows, especially with regard to setting up and configuring the basic peer-
to-peer network, as discussed in this book. Thankfully, there’s nothing else
you need to buy.
The NIC software (driver)
If you’ve just installed networking hardware in your PC, refer to the documen-
tation that came with the NIC. You may need to install some software, to help
the computer recognize and use the NIC. Or, there may be software that’s
used to diagnose and troubleshoot. In any event, that software must be
installed before you configure the network on your computer.
If the NIC came with your PC or the software is on the motherboard, you’re
ready to go.
197
Chapter 16: Basic Painless Networking

Setting up the network configuration
Windows most likely has automatically configured networking for you. Just to
be sure, why not check on things in the Network Connections window? To get
there, open the Control Panel and then open the Network Connections icon.
The screen you see may look something like Figure 16-2.
If you see a Local Area Connection icon in the window, as shown in Figure
16-2, you’re all set up and ready to go — though I recommend that you con-
tinue reading the next several subsections, to better familiarize yourself with
some networking jargon and to know where the bodies are buried. That helps
you out later, if the need arises.
If you don’t see a Local Area Connection icon or you see only dial-up connec-
tions, you need to configure the networking software in Windows. Locate the
area on the left side of the screen that says Network Tasks. Then click the link
in the area that says Set Up a Home or Small Office Network. That runs a
wizard or two; follow the directions on the screen.
When you’re done, the network should be running. Note that for a network to
be working, you must have at least two computers connected properly and
on speaking terms. See the section “Testing the Network,” at the end of this
chapter, for more information.
 If your PC has more than one network adapter (NIC), you see an icon for
each connection in the Network Connections dialog box.
 If you have any dial-up connections, they appear in a separate area in
the Network Connections window and are dial-up.
 Note the helpful Network Troubleshooter in the See Also pane.

A networking connection’s 
Properties dialog box
To get your hands dirty with the software side of networking, you need to see
the Properties dialog box for your Network Connection icon. This is the place
to go for confirming network settings and for changing the network’s configu-
ration. Especially when you first set up a network, it’s a good idea to know
where and how to see this particular Properties dialog box. Here’s the skinny:
1. Open the Network Connections window.
Refer to the preceding subsection.
2. Right-click your networking icon.
The icon is shown in the margin.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
You see a Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-3. Here’s a refer-
ence to what’s what:
• The official name for your NIC appears atop the General tab.
• Three types of items are listed in the middle of the dialog box:
Clients, Services, and Protocols.
• The Client for Microsoft Networks is what allows you to do peer-to-
peer networking with other Windows computers on the network.
It’s necessary.
Figure 16-3:
A con-
nection’s

199
Chapter 16: Basic Painless Networking

• The File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks service lets
you access and share network disk drives and printers.
• The Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) thing governs Ethernet. It’s a set of
rules and such.
• I recommend putting a check mark by the item Show Icon in
Notification Area When Connected. See the subsection “The little
networking guys,” later in this chapter.
4. Close the Properties dialog box when you’re done poking around.
Generally speaking, you rarely need to mess with the settings in the Properties
dialog box, but it’s good to know where the thing is in case the need arises —
especially for troubleshooting. The following subsection also makes use of the
dialog box.
The little networking guys
If you heeded my advice earlier in this chapter, you notice the Little
Networking Guys icon on the system tray part of the taskbar. Those guys
appear when the network is connected, and they flash during periods of net-
work activity.
 Point the mouse at a connection, and a pop-up bubble gives you a quick
network summary.
 You can click the Little Networking Guys icon to see the connection’s
Status dialog box (see the next subsection).
 Right-click the icon and choose Open Network Connections from the
pop-up menu to see that window displayed.
 Note that if you have two network connections, you see two networking
guys, one for each connection.
Checking your IP address
Just as every house on your street as its own, unique street address, each
computer on the network must have a unique IP address. Two houses with
the same address would lead to confusion, like on the TV show Desperate
Housewives. Ditto for your network, but without the gratuitous sex.
The IP address can be either manually entered or assigned by a single com-
puter on the network or a router. To check the IP address, follow these steps:
200
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

1. Open the Network Connections window.
2. Double-click to open your Network Connections icon.
The connection’s Status dialog box appears. The General tab tells you
some information about the connection. Primarily, you can determine
that the network is up and good because it says Status: Connected
and the Activity area indicates information both sent and received.
3. Click the Support tab.
On the Support tab, you find the IP Address listed. It’s one of those
dotted numbers, like 10.0.1.1 or something similar. You also find two
other important values listed:
• The subnet mask, which helps Ethernet find local computers on
the network.
• The default gateway, which is required when your LAN is also con-
nected to the Internet. The gateway is usually the IP address of the
router.
4. Click the Close button.
IP addresses that start with 192.168 or 10.0 are used for the local network
only. Other IP addresses are used on the Internet and can be assigned only by
an ISP or some outfit with the authority to assign those numbers. Otherwise,
the IP address you see with starts out with 192.168 or 10.0.
Manually assigning an IP address
In most situations, the IP address is assigned for you automatically, or dynam-
ically. This happens when you use a router to connect your network and the
router has been configured to deal out IP addresses. It also happens when
you use Internet connection sharing, as covered in Chapter 18. It may also
happen if you just have one computer connected to a broadband modem.
When it doesn’t happen, you must manually assign an IP address to each
computer in the network.
To manually assign an IP address, you use the network connection’s
Properties dialog box. Here’s the nitty and the gritty:
1. Open the Network Connections window.
2. Right-click your networking icon and choose the Properties command
from the pop-up menu.
3. On the General tab, click the item labeled Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
4. Click the Properties button.
The TCP/IP Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-4.
201
Chapter 16: Basic Painless Networking

If you have a network computer that hands out IP addresses or you’re
using Internet connection sharing (see Chapter 18) or you have a router
that assigns IP addresses or you have a computer running the DHCP pro-
gram, you can choose the option labeled Obtain an IP Address
Automatically; skip to Step 8.
5. Type an IP address for the computer. Type 10, press Tab, type 0, press
Tab, type 0, press Tab, and then type a number.
Each PC on your network must have a unique IP address.
6. Enter 255.0.0.0 as the Subnet mask.
7. Leave everything else alone.
8. Click OK and close any other open dialog boxes or windows.
The most important part of these steps is to ensure that no two PCs on the
network use the same IP address. If they do, the network doesn’t work.
Setting Your Computer’s Network 
Name and Workgroup
All computers on the network must have a network name. For Windows 
peer-to-peer networking, they must also all belong to the same workgroup.
Figure 16-4:
The TCPI/IP

Part III: Networking Nonsense 

Here’s how to check or assign the computer’s name as well as the work-
group name:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Click the Computer Name tab.
4. Type a description for your computer in the Computer Description
text box.
The description helps further identify the computer when its icon is
shown in a networking window.
5. Click the Change button.
6. Enter or change the computer’s name (if necessary).
7. Enter a new workgroup name.
I use single names, all caps. The name must be the same in order for all
computers in a workgroup to see each other. Changing this name also
affects other computers on the network that are connected to your PC.
8. Click OK to set the new names in the Computer Name Changes dialog
box.
9. Click OK to close the System Properties dialog box.
203
Chapter 16: Basic Painless Networking
Getting the MAC address
Along with a computer’s IP address, another
unique number given to each computer using
Ethernet is something called the MAC address.
Unlike the IP address, however, the MAC
address is a unique number assigned to your
networking hardware, the NIC. No two NICs
have the same MAC address, which is done pri-
marily as a security measure.
To view the MAC address used on your PC’s NIC,
open the Network Connections window and
double-click to open the Network Connections
icon. Click the Support tab and then the Details
button. The Network Connections Details box
lists the MAC address as the “physical address.”
It shows up as six pairs of values separated by
hyphens. Values include the numbers 0 through
9 and the letters A through F.
You may need to know this value when you’re
configuring a router or doing other networky
things.
MAC stands for Media Access Control, or it
could be short for McCarthy, depending on
whom you know.

For a small network, names are just for show. Even so, it helps to know which
computer you’re dealing with on a network. That’s why I gave my computers
names rather than silly numbers or cryptic things that only I would understand.
 The computer’s network name cannot be the same as another computer
on the network.
 Workgroups are just a way to divide a large network into more manage-
able chunks. Even if you have a dozen computers, it’s okay to keep them
all in the same workgroup.
 After you assign your computer a name, don’t change it. That could
screw up connections made by other computers on the network.
 Don’t bother messing with multiple workgroup names if you’re network-
ing PCs only in your house or small office. Trust me — it’s too much of a
hassle.
Testing the Network
The network is working when your computer can “see” other computers on
the network. To view them, open the My Network Places icon on the desktop.
The My Network Places icon may also exist on the Start button’s menu.
In the My Network Places window, locate on the left side the pane that says
Network Tasks. On the list, you find text that reads “View workgroup comput-
ers.” Click that text to see all the other computers on the network and in your
workgroup. They should appear similar to what you see in Figure 16-5.
Figure 16-5:
Other
computers

workgroup.
204
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

Note that the name of the window is the same as the workgroup name. In
Figure 16-5, the workgroup is named Cat. Three computers are present. The
computers are listed by their description first and then by the computer
name in parentheses.
If you don’t see any computers listed, check the following:
 Ensure that each PC has its own unique IP address.
 The subnet mask for each PC needs to be the same as well.
 All PCs need to be in the same workgroup.
 Check the network connections.
 Ensure that the hub, switch, or router is turned on.
 Go to another computer and check its My Network Places window to see
whether the problem is one way or both ways.
 Restart Windows.
 Run the Network Troubleshooter, as mentioned in the section “Setting
up the network configuration,” earlier in this chapter.

H
ooking your PC into a network expands greatly the fields on which you
can compute. No more are you limited to using your own PC’s
resources. Remember how Ed vanished into his office with the new color
printer? Well, as soon as that sucker was up and on the network, everyone
could use it. Poor Ed! Ha!
Networking is about communications and sharing resources. After the net-
work is up and running, it’s resource shopping-spree time. Windows provides
ample tools for using resources on the network, for grabbing and using net-
work disk drives and printers, as well as for sacrificing your PC’s own disk
drives and printers. This chapter tells you how all that is done.
Networky Places in Windows
Windows has several ways of letting you peek at the network and view which
network resources are available. This section tells you what’s what and
where the bodies are buried.

Shared files in the My Network 
Places window
The main networking window thing in Windows is called My Network Places.
It’s an icon on the desktop, or on the Start button’s menu, that opens a
window also called My Network Places, as shown in Figure 17-1.
When your PC first starts, Windows goes out on the network and identifies 
all other Windows computers on the network. It then gathers a list of shared
resources that are available on each network computer. The My Network
Places window shows you a summary of any shared folders on those 
computers.
The shared folders appear as folder icons, but with “plumbing” below them.
The shared folder name is then given, followed by the word on and then the
network computer’s description. The network computer’s name appears in
parentheses.
Opening a shared folder allows you to view and access files inside that folder —
just like in Windows — but the files actually exist on another computer on
the network.
 Windows XP automatically puts all shared folders up for display in the
My Network Places window. Any new resources that are made available
appear in the window as though by magic.
Figure 17-1:
The My
Network
Places
window.
208
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

 Shared folders on your own computer also show up in the My Network
Places window. They appear as regular folder icons, minus the plumbing.
 You can assign a drive letter to any shared folder, to make that folder
part of your own PC’s disk system. See the section “Mapping in a net-
work drive,” later in this chapter.
 You can open the icons in the My Network Places folder. Opening an icon
for a folder causes Windows to access the network and then report the
contents of that folder. But, on your computer, you see the folder’s con-
tents displayed just as though it were a folder on your own computer.
 The View Network Connections item in the Network Tasks panel opens
the Network Connections window, another handy networking place in
Windows. Refer to Chapter 16 for more information.
 You can save favorite Internet locations — specifically, FTP sites — in
the My Network Places window. This is done by clicking the Add a
Network Place link on the Network Tasks panel, on the left side of the
window. That’s all I have to say about that here.
 The My Network Places folder is named the Network Neighborhood in
other versions of Windows. Both terms refer to the same thing.
Shared printers
In addition to looking for shared folders on the network, Windows scourers the
network for any printers marked “up for grabs.” Unlike the folders, however, the
shared printers don’t show up in the My Network Places window. Instead, they
show up in the regular Printers and Faxes window, as shown in Figure 17-2.
Figure 17-2:
Shared
printers

here.
209
Chapter 17: Abusing the Network

To view the Printers and Faxes window, open the Control Panel and then
open the Printers and Faxes icon.
Printers elsewhere on the network appear as printer icons with network
plumbing beneath them. Printers directly attached to your computer also
show up, but without the plumbing (refer to Figure 17-2).
 Refer to Chapter 12 for more information on printers and printing.
 See the section “Sharing a printer,” later in this chapter, for information
on sharing printers attached to your computer. See the section “Using a
network printer,” near the end of this chapter, for info on using network
printers.
Network computers and 
their shared resources
Windows lets you see only those resources available for sharing on the net-
work, and you don’t have to share anything you don’t want to. To get a quick
view of what’s available from each computer, you can use the My Network
Places window to browse through the computers on your workgroup and see
what’s available for sharing. Follow these steps:
1. Open the My Network Places icon on the desktop.
2. Locate the Network Tasks area, on the left side of the window.
3. Choose the View Workgroup Computers task.
A window appears that lists all computers in the workgroup. For most
small offices and home networks, that should include all computers on
the network (refer to Chapter 16).
4. To see which resources are being shared on a specific computer,
double-click to open that computer’s icon.
For example, Figure 17-3 shows the resources being shared from the
computer Ming on the network; three folders and one printer are being
shared. Those aren’t the entire contents of that computer’s hard drive —
just what the user has elected to have shared.
5. Click the Up button on the toolbar to return to the workgroup
window.
The window now shows all computers up on the network in the same
workgroup.
210
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

6. Click the Up button again.
The topmost network level is the Microsoft Windows Network level. On
this level, all workgroups on the network appear. That should just be
one workgroup for a small or home office.
7. Click the Up button one last time.
The final location is called Entire Network and includes some globe-and-
mouse icons. I have no idea what they are and how they’re used.
8. Close the window.
Wise move.
Doing Network Things in Windows
Here’s a list of fun things you can do on a PC network. Keep in mind the basic
network mantra as you review these sections: “Networking is about sharing.”
 Several of these subsections assume that you know about finding spe-
cific places in Windows: Refer to Chapter 5 for finding some locations.
 See Chapter 21 for information on folders if the concept is new to you.
 The only thing you can share that’s not mentioned here is a modem or
high-speed Internet connection. Refer to Chapter 18 for information spe-
cific to that chore.

Chapter 17: Abusing the Network

Sharing a folder on the network
If you want others on the network to have access to a folder on your com-
puter, you share the folder. This makes the folder — and its contents (all files
and subfolders) — available to all other computers on the network. Here’s
how to share a folder:
1. Select the folder you want to share.
Click the folder’s icon once to select it.
2. Choose File➪Sharing and Security.
The Sharing tab in the folder’s Properties dialog box appears, similar to
what you see in Figure 17-4.
3. Click to put a check mark by the option labeled Share This Folder on
the Network.
4. Optionally, click the item labeled Allow Network Users to Change 
My Files.
Checking this item allows full access to the folder and its files. If you
don’t check this item, the folder appears as read-only to other users on
the network.
Figure 17-4:
A disk
drive’s
Properties
dialog box.
212
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

5. Optionally, change the share name.
The share name is the same as the folder’s name, but remember that it
can be vague; I have many folders named book on my computer. In this
case (refer to Figure 17-4), I would change the share name from book to
the specific name of the book that its contents represent.
6. Click OK.
The folder is now shared.
Icons for shared folders appear with the graphical “sharing hand” beneath
them, as shown in the margin. On other computers on the network, the
shared folder appears in the My Network Places window or can be seen by
opening your computer’s icon inside the workgroup folder.
 Don’t share an entire disk drive. This is a security risk; Windows warns
you when you try to do so.
 If you’re unable to share a folder, it may be protected. You see a check
mark by the option labeled Make This Folder Private in the folder’s
Properties dialog box (refer to Figure 17-4). Remove that check mark to
share the folder.
 If you cannot remove the Make This Folder Private check mark (it’s
dimmed), check the parent folder’s Properties dialog box, and so on and
so on, until you find the main folder that was originally marked as pri-
vate. Removing that private status allows the subfolders to be shared.
 Windows XP uses the Shared Documents folder for things that really
need to be shared on the network. My advice is to merely share that
folder and then copy into it things you want shared on the network. To
share the Shared Documents folder, open the My Computer icon on the
desktop. The Shared Documents folder can be found inside.
Sharing a printer
Sharing a printer connected to your PC works just like sharing a folder:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes folder.
It’s inside the Control Panel.
2. Click to highlight the printer you want to share.
3. Choose File➪Sharing from the menu.
The printer’s Properties dialog box appears, with the Sharing tab selected.
213
Chapter 17: Abusing the Network

4. Click to select the item labeled Share This Printer.
5. Optionally, give the printer a name.
For example, name it Color Laser to let everyone know that you’re finally
sharing your darn precious color laser printer.
6. Click the OK button.
As with sharing a folder, the printer’s icon appears with the sharing hand
beneath it. In other Printers and Faxes windows all across your network, that
shared printer appears, ready to roll. (Unlike in previous versions, Windows
XP automatically locates shared printers and instantly installs their drivers.)
Accessing a network folder
You access a folder elsewhere on the network just as you would access any
folder on your PC’s disk system. The difference is that you need to browse to
the folder, which takes some extra steps.
The key to browsing to a network folder is My Network Places. Either open
that icon on the desktop or choose it from a drop-down list in a folder
window or in the Open or Save As dialog boxes.
After displaying the contents of the My Network Places window, you can then
choose any folder window shared on the network. Figure 17-5 shows the
window’s contents as seen from an Open dialog box. The folders shown 
there are all shared folders from other computers on the network.
214
Part III: Networking Nonsense 
What about network printers?
Network printers, or printers with their own
networking cards, don’t need to be connected
directly to any PC. To access the network printer,
however, you must have software installed on
each computer by using the installation program
that came on a CD with the printer. Unlike print-
ers directly connected to Windows XP com-
puters, network printers don’t have the brains 
to announce their presence and share their 
drivers.

 You can also get to the My Network Places window by clicking the icon
on the left side of most Open or Save In dialog boxes (refer to Figure 17-5).
 After you open a shared folder from the My Network Places window, you
see its contents just as you would in a local folder on your own hard drive.
Mapping in a network drive
If you find accessing a folder on another computer (as described in the pre-
ceding subsection) tedious, you can opt instead to map that folder to your
local disk drive system. This choice provides easy, quick, and consistent
access to the folder’s contents, just as though the folder were another disk
drive inside your PC.
To map a folder, follow these steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon.
You can pull this trick in any folder; I chose the My Computer folder
because that’s where the mapped folder’s drive icons show up.
2. Choose Tools➪Map Network Drive.
The Map Network Drive dialog box shows up, as depicted in Figure 17-6.
Figure 17-5:
Finding a
shared
folder.
215
Chapter 17: Abusing the Network

3. Choose a drive letter for the networked drive.
You can give the network drive any unused drive letter. Be clever here.
For example, if you mapped in a folder full of MP3 files, give it drive
letter M. Otherwise, the drive letter choice doesn’t really matter.
The drive letter you assign is personal to your computer. It doesn’t
affect any other computer on the network.
4. Select the network folder to map to that letter.
If you have recently accessed the folder, you can choose it from the Folder
drop-down list. Otherwise, use the Browse button, which opens a special
window to My Network Places, where you can select a network folder.
5. Ask yourself, “Do I always want to use the network drive?”
If so, put a check mark by the item labeled Reconnect at Logon. That
way, Windows always maps in the folder to that specific drive letter
every time you start your computer. Otherwise, the mapping is forgotten
when you log out.
6. Click the Finish button.
Windows opens that folder and shows you its contents.
Back in the My Computer folder, however, you see the mapped folder as a
disk drive icon, complete with plumbing (as shown in the margin). Accessing
that network folder is as easy, and the same as, using the drive letter on your
own PC.
Using a network printer
Because Windows XP automatically spies and loads network printers, all you
have to do to use one is choose it from the drop-down list in a Print dialog
box. Refer to Chapter 12 for more information on printing.

Unsharing a folder
To remove the magical sharing properties from a folder, repeat the steps in
the subsection “Sharing a folder on the network,” earlier in this chapter. This
time, however, remove the check mark to share the folder on the network.
Click OK, and the folder is unshared and the sharing hand vanishes from
beneath its icon.
Disconnecting a mapped network drive
To remove a mapped network drive, open the My Computer window and 
click to select Mr. Disk Drive with Plumbing. From the menu, choose File➪
Disconnect. The drive is unmapped.
Unsharing a printer
Unsharing a printer is as simple as sharing one: Repeat the steps in the sub-
section “Sharing a printer,” a little earlier in this chapter, but click to choose
Don’t Share This Printer. The little hand goes away, and the printer is, once
again, all yours!

Your Network and the Internet
In This Chapter
 Accessing the Internet at high speed
 Understanding broadband modems
 Hooking up a broadband modem
 Sharing the modem connection
 Using a firewall
I
t probably surprised you, as it surprises most people. When you get a high-
speed modem — cable, DSL, satellite, or other broadband connection —
even though you may have only one computer, you need networking hard-
ware to hook up the thing. That’s because the net part of Internet stands for
networking. The Internet itself is merely a huge network of computers, all of
them hooked up with hardware and using software in nearly the same way as
a local area network (LAN) in a small business or home office.
You can also use, beyond the broadband modem thing, your existing local
area network to share a single dial-up modem and that computer’s network
connection. It’s very similar to the broadband Internet connection, which is
why both those things are covered in this single chapter.
The Broadband Internet Connection
You’ve seen the advertisements where they compare the various high-speed,
or broadband, Internet connections. There’s the one that claims how DSL is
slower than cable. That’s true, but what they don’t tell you is that cable’s
speed is not guaranteed. Whatever. My point is that one thing they univer-
sally don’t tell you is that in order to connect to the broadband modem, you
need a PC with a networking card.
They say that it takes a minimum of 20 minutes for any Windows computer
connected to the Internet to be attacked by a worm or virus. Trust me, the
bad guys are really out there, and they aggressively want to take over your
computer, especially if you have a broadband connection.

You can do two things to protect yourself. The first is to use a router and con-
figure it as described in this chapter. The second thing to do is configure and
use firewall software, also described in this chapter. Don’t wait! Do it now!
Types of broadband modems
Three popular types of broadband modems are available:
 Cable
 DSL
 Satellite
Cable: This option is the fastest and cheapest. If you live in an area serviced
by a TV cable company, you should check into its Internet offerings. The cable
modem plugs into the cable jack on the wall — just like you plug in a TV.
For speed, cable cannot be beat. The downside, however, is that the speed
isn’t guaranteed. If more folks in your neighborhood start using their cable
modems, your speed rapidly decreases. Fortunately, that rarely happens,
which means that cable is still the best deal around.
DSL: The Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, connection is the second-fastest
option available for a high-speed Internet connection. The speed you get is
chosen ahead of time and is offered in given increments, such as 128 Kbps,
384 Kbps, 512 Kbps, and other, faster speeds.
The speed values used by a DSL connection are listed twice. The first is the
sending speed, and the second is the receiving speed. So, you can pay for a
connection that has a slower sending speed and a higher receiving speed if
you don’t plan on sending lots of information.
The DSL speed available to you depends on your location; DSL connections
can be made reliably only within a certain radius of the telephone company’s
main office. Yes, you pay more for the higher speeds.
Satellite: The satellite connection is the only broadband connection available
for remote locations. It’s not as popular as cable or DSL, plus you have more
equipment to buy. It’s really only an option when you need speed and nothing
else is available.
I would recommend a bidirectional satellite connection. Avoid those that are
download-only and require a dial-up connection for uploading.
220
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

Above all, be sure to check in the Yellow Pages under Internet for additional
high-speed Internet connections not listed here, but that may be offered in
your area.
 Modem speed is measured in kilobits per seconds, or Kbps. Refer to
Chapter 13 for more information on modem speed.
 Some cable companies may offer minimum speed guarantees — at a pre-
mium price.
 A DSL connection with the same sending and receiving speeds is called
bidirectional. If you have a 768 Kbps bidirectional DSL line, you’re both
sending and receiving information at 768 Kbps.
 DSL is a generic term. Specific types of DSL connections are denoted by
a letter prefixing DSL. For example, there’s ADSL, VDSL, and SDSL. No
need to know the specifics.
Connecting the broadband 
modem to your PC
Some broadband modems are available at the computer store along with dial-
up modems, paper shredders, and, occasionally, computer books written by
Dan Gookin. Other modems are available from broadband service providers.
Sometimes you rent them, sometimes you buy them, and sometimes the
phone company forgets to bill you.
221
Chapter 18: Your Network and the Internet
Broadband connection options 
you don’t want to read about
An up-and-coming broadband option, soon to
be popular all over the world (or so they say), is
wireless. This isn’t the current type of wireless
networking you get at Starbucks. Nope, it’s
wide-area wireless networking. It means that
you don’t even need a modem to connect to the
network — just a wireless NIC and all the right
passwords and stuff. Chapter 19 has more infor-
mation on wireless networking.
The other, remaining broadband options are the
scary ones used mainly by businesses. The T1
line, or fractional T1, is where a networking con-
nection is wired directly into your home or office
from the phone company’s network. The speed
is guaranteed, but it’s not as fast as cable, and
it’s terribly expensive. Even faster and more ter-
rible and awfully more expensive is the T3 line.
And then you can mix in fiber optic connections,
and pretty soon you start getting into telepathy
and subspace and technologies not yet invented.
These issues are addressed in this book’s pub-
lishing contract, but not anywhere in reality.

If the cable or phone company doesn’t install your broadband modem for
you, you have to do it. The instructions come with the modem, and it’s really
a simple thing to do.
Before installing your DSL modem, you need to attach your dongles! The dongle
is a line filter — a gizmo. You attach it to the phone jack on the wall and then
plug your telephone, fax machine, dial-up modem, answering machine, caller ID
box, or anything but the DLS modem into the dongle. You must do this, or else
the feedback from the DSL modem makes using your telephone difficult.
Cable modem users don’t have to worry about the dongle.
If the modem came with specific setup instructions, follow them first.
Otherwise, use these directions as a guide:
1. Plug the modem into the cable connector for a cable modem; for a
DSL modem, plug the modem into any standard phone jack.
2. Plug the modem into the networking jack on the back of your PC.
If you have a local area network, things hook up differently. See the sec-
tion “Sharing the broadband connection,” later in this chapter.
Some modems plug into an Ethernet-to-USB adapter, and the USB
adapter then plugs into the computer.
If you’re following my advice and using a router, plug the modem into the
router, and then plug your PC into the router. See the sidebar “Advice for
setting up a router,” later in this chapter, for more information.
3. Plug the modem into the wall socket.
I highly recommend that you plug the modem into a UPS to keep it pow-
ered on during brief outages. Refer to Chapter 3 for more information on
UPS (the power supply, not the delivery company).
4. Turn the modem on, if possible.
Some modems don’t have power switches; plugging them in is the same
as turning them on.
Check the lights on the modem after you turn it on. The lights are good for
telling you that
 The modem is on and receiving power.
 The modem is receiving a signal from the Internet.
 The modem is sending or receiving information.
 The modem isn’t screwed up.
Refer to the modem’s guide for more information on what the lights mean.
Note that it may take a few moments for the lights to provide proper feed-
back; don’t be to quick to assume that something is wrong.
222
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

 Yes, leave a broadband modem on all the time.
 Refer to Chapter 4 for information on leaving the PC on all time.
 Don’t put a dongle between the DSL modem and the telephone wall jack!
The DSL modem doesn’t work if you do so.
 If you have two or more phone lines, the dongles need to go on only the
phone line that shares the DSL connection.
Telling Windows about 
the broadband modem
The best way to complete the software side of your broadband modem setup
is to refer to the information sheet or CD provided by your Internet Service
Provider (ISP). It’s specific.
When you’re using a broadband connection with an existing local area net-
work in your home or office, see the following subsection. Otherwise, if it’s
just you, your PC, and the broadband modem, follow these general steps:
1. Open the Network Connections window.
You can get to this window by choosing Network Connections from the
Start button’s menu or by opening the Network Connections icon in the
Control Panel.
2. On the left side of the Network Connections window, in the Network
Tasks area, click the link labeled Create a New Connection.
The New Connection Wizard appears.
3. Click the Next button.
4. Choose Connect to the Internet and then click the Next button.
5. Choose Set Up My Connection Manually, unless you have a CD from
your ISP, and then click the Use the CD I Got from an ISP option.
If you have a CD, skip to Step 8.
6. Click the Next button.
7. Choose the option required for your connection, depending on
whether you need to log in.
Some broadband connections require you to log in, and others are “on”
all the time. Choose the proper option on the screen.

That’s pretty much it — except for one more important thing you must do
and do quickly: Get a firewall. See the section “The Importance of a Firewall,”
later in this chapter.
Sharing the broadband connection
There’s no reason that only one computer on your network should have
access to the broadband modem. After all, aren’t networks about sharing and
love and all that?
Here’s the secret: Broadband modems can plug directly into your network hub,
switch, or router, to make the modem instantly and equally accessible to all
computers on the network. Figure 18-1 illustrates how simply this can be done.

Part III: Networking Nonsense 

Plug the broadband modem into the hub, switch, or router, just as you would
plug in any computer. For fastest results, use a switch, not a plain old dull
hub. My best advice is to use a router; see the nearby sidebar, “Advice for
setting up a router,” for important details. Also, if you use a hub or a switch,
you need to run the Internet Connection Sharing Wizard on all your comput-
ers. This step isn’t required when you use a router.
After setting things up, run the New Connection Wizard as described in the
preceding subsection. This must be done for each computer on the network,
but, fortunately, it needs to be done only once.
Sharing a Dial-Up Internet Connection
Though a dial-up connection isn’t as spiffy as a broadband connection, you
can still share that Internet access with other PCs on your computer network.
For one, you needn’t worry about dialing out on a line already used by some-
one else in your house. If the line is in use, the second computer simply “piggy-
backs” onto the modem through the network and accesses the Internet.
225
Chapter 18: Your Network and the Internet
Advice for setting up a router
A router is a smart type of Ethernet hub, one that
helps make decisions regarding where infor-
mation goes and offers protection from the
wiles of the Internet for computers on a local
area network. My advice is to use a router even
if you have only one computer connected to a
broadband modem.
As a bonus, consider getting a router with fire-
wall protection. That fixes two problems with
one solution. There are many such routers. I
personally use the NETGEAR line.
Routers are often configured by accessing the
router’s Web page. (Yes, it has its own Web
page.) From the Web page, you can further con-
figure the router or assist in its automatic con-
figuration. You want to tell the router to block
unwanted incoming traffic while still allowing
the computers on your local network to access
and use each other’s resources.
Also direct the router to assign local IP
addresses to each computer on the network.
(Refer to Chapter 16 for information on IP
addresses.) It’s usually done via a feature
named DHCP. That’s a good thing!
Take note of the router’s own IP address. You
want to enter it in each PC’s network setup
window, by entering the router’s IP address as
the gateway for your network. If you have diffi-
culty with this part, call your ISP’s tech support
line, and someone there can help you. (After all,
you pay the ISP for this type of support.)
Most of what a router does is technical, so don’t
let it bother you if you can’t understand half the
options. Most of the time, the default or stan-
dard setup is best.

To share a dial-up connection, follow these steps on the Windows XP com-
puter with the dial-up modem and existing dial-up Internet connection:
1. Open the Network Connections window.
2. Click to select a dial-up connection to share.
3. Choose File➪Properties from the menu.
4. Click the Advanced tab in the connection’s Properties dialog box.
5. Put a check mark by the option labeled Allow Other Network Users to
Connect through This Computer’s Internet Connection.
6. Put check marks next to the two options below that one.
These items together allow other computers on the network to access
and control the Internet connection.
7. Click OK, and the connection is now shared.
Other Windows computers on the network (not Windows XP systems, but,
rather, earlier versions of Windows) need to configure the Internet Connection
Wizard so that they know to use another PC’s modem to dial out and connect
to the Internet. After that’s all set up, whenever another computer tries to
access the Internet, it forces the shared modem computer to dial out, make
the connection, and then share the connection throughout the network.
Windows XP computers automatically sense a shared Internet connection.
Note that privacy is still enforced with a shared connection. Despite getting
information into one computer through another, the first (sharing) computer
cannot access or interpret the information that’s flowing through.
To disable sharing, reverse the steps to uncheck the check box. To temporarily
disable the connection, you can simply unplug the modem from the phone line.
Testing the Internet Connection
To see whether the Internet connection you’ve set up is working, simply run
an Internet program. For example, start the Internet Explorer Web browser.
Type the address for Yahoo! on the Address bar:
http://www.yahoo.com/
Press Enter, and within seconds you should be able to see the Yahoo! home
page on the Internet. If not, or if you get some error message, something is
wrong with the connection. Phone up your ISP for technical support.

Part III: Networking Nonsense 

The Importance of a Firewall
A firewall is a safety device. For a building, the firewall is created from special
slow-burning material, rated in hours. For example, a three-hour firewall theo-
retically takes three hours to burn through — and that helps protect a build-
ing from burning down before the fire department shows up.
On a computer with an Internet connection, a firewall is designed to restrict
Internet access, primarily to keep unwanted guests out. The firewall effectively
plugs holes through which bad guys could get in and mess with your PC.
 The Internet wasn’t designed with security in mind. Back in the original
days, scientists were open about their systems and didn’t feel the need
to protect their computers from other Internet users.
 Especially if you have a broadband connection, your PC is most vulnera-
ble to attack. You must get a firewall.
 The best firewall protection is the black hole. That is, a computer on the
Internet can probe your broadband modem and get the same response
as though no computer were attached to the modem. To test for this
condition, as well as test for weaknesses in your firewall, use ShieldsUP,
from Gibson Research:
http://grc.com/
Installing the Windows XP firewall
Windows XP comes with limited firewall security, available through your
Internet connection. Follow these steps to set it up:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Network Connections icon.
2. Right-click your ISP’s or dial-up Internet connection icon and choose
Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Click the Advanced tab in the Properties dialog box.
4. Click the Settings button to access the Windows Firewall dialog box.
The Windows Firewall dialog box appears.
5. Click to select On (recommended).
6. Click the Exceptions tab.
The Exceptions are things you want to allow through the network —
stuff that’s okay. Normally, the firewall blocks everything — which is
secure, but not very efficient or friendly.
227
Chapter 18: Your Network and the Internet

7. Put a check mark by File and Printer Sharing.
That step allows other computers to access your computer to share files
and the printer.
8. Put a check mark by SmartFTP.
That action allows you to use the FTP program to send and receive files
on the Internet.
9. Remove all other check marks.
Only if you really know what a program does or use it enough should
you put a check mark there.
10. Click OK, and the firewall is set.
The Windows firewall isn’t that bad, especially if you have Windows XP SP 2
release. If you don’t, or you’re reluctant to update, get a third-party firewall.
In fact, you can disable the Windows firewall if you use a third-party firewall.
Unlike other things in the PC, you get no benefit from running two firewalls 
at once.
Third-party firewalls
The advantages of a third-party firewall are that, well, they’re far more robust
and capable than what Windows offers. For example, Zone Alarm, from Zone
Labs, monitors both incoming and outgoing requests for the Internet and
offers e-mail protection. I highly recommend it: www.zonelabs.com.
Other third-party solutions exist. If you enjoy the Norton stuff, consider getting
the Norton Personal Firewall or the Norton Internet Security programs (www.
symantec.com). Another fine firewall is available from Kerio Technologies
(www.kerio.com).
 The key to running a firewall is to forbid access to your PC from random
computers on the Internet while still allowing computers on the local
network full access. That may be tricky to set up, but it’s the configura-
tion you want.
 Windows may tell you that “no firewall is detected” when it starts,
despite the fact that you have a third-party firewall installed. Ignore
those messages.
 You have no reason to run a third-party firewall if you’re using a router
that has built-in firewall protection. A single firewall is enough.
 Your ISP can be a great resource if you want more information or recom-
mendations on this subject.

In This Chapter
 Understanding 802.11
 Getting a wireless NIC
 Setting up a wireless network
 Using the base station
 Connecting to the wireless network
 Hunting for wireless networks
I
f the entire 20th century was about getting everything wired, the 21st cen-
tury is beginning to undo that trend. The buzzword everywhere is wire-
less. Wireless keyboard and mouse. Wireless phones. Wireless this and that.
At the top of the heap is wireless computer networking, which has been her-
alded as the biggest improvement to computers since the switch from steam
to electrical power in the late 18th century.
Hardware-wise, wireless networking is a piece of cake; no wires means an
easier setup. The software side? Ha! Configuring your wireless network is,
well, different, as you discover while reading through this chapter.
 This chapter refers to some basic networking concepts common to both
wireless and wired networks. Refer to Chapter 16 for more information
on networking basics.
 The information in Chapter 17 (and somewhat in Chapter 18) on using
the network applies equally to wireless and wired networks.
 Wireless networking is a Big Issue with PC laptops. For details on that
topic, please see my book Laptops For Dummies, published by the same
malicious people who brought you this friendly tome.

Wireless Basics
It’s true that shouting at someone is a type of wireless technology. But, as
you’ve probably learned, shouting at a computer does little or no good. Wires
virtually guarantee that a signal gets through. But, wireless?
If you understand the basics of computer networking, wireless networking
isn’t all that different. You have some terms to know, standards to obey, and
various ritual dances and chants. This section discusses those and other
wireless networking basics.
The ABGs of wireless networking
Computers would just go nuts without standards. There are acronym standards,
number standards, standards with cute names, plus various fruit-flavored
standards. For networking, the standard is Ethernet. For wireless networking,
the standard is 802.11, which is properly pronounced, “eight oh two dot
eleven,” or, to save time you can omit the dot: “Eight oh two eleven.”
At this point, there are two versions of the 802.11 standard, called B and G
and written as 802.11b and 802.11g, respectively. The 802.11b standard is
older and more common. The 802.11g standard is newer and faster and
becoming more common every day.
What happened to 802.11a? Well, you may see that standard listed on some
wireless networking adapters, but it’s really an antique now. Letters C through F
also existed at one time, but they never caught on. You’re left with only 802.11b
and 802.11g.
What’s the point?
The point is — and this is important — that for all your wireless networking
hardware to work, it must all be on the same standard.
For example, if the wireless networking adapter on all your computers, lap-
tops, and routers is 802.11b, you’re okay. If they all use 802.11g, you’re still
okay. But, if they mix it up between 802.11b and 802.11g, you’re screwed.
 Some wireless networking adapters cover both popular standards. This
is often specified as 802.11b/g. The adapter costs more, but you get an
adapter that works in just about any wireless networking situation.
 The multiple standard wireless adapters may also be compatible with
the old 802.11a standard, in which case they’re labeled as 802.11 a/b/g.
230
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

 The long name of 802.11 is IEEE 802.11, the same IEEE group that created
the 1394, or FireWire, port.
 There are also 802.11h and 802.11i standards, though they’re not com-
monly implemented or available as wireless networking adapters.
Behold, the wireless NIC
Wireless networking requires its own wireless NIC, or network information
card. This card is either an expansion card you add to your PC’s mother-
board or a special adapter that plugs into the USB port.
The wireless networking card adheres to one or more of the wireless net-
working standards, either 802.11b or 802.11g, or both. As long as that stan-
dard matches all the other computers and wireless networking apparatuses
in your home or office, you’re set!
 I recommend getting a wireless adapter with an external antenna. For
some reason, the antenna makes picking up the wireless signal all the
more easier — especially if the antenna is directional (can be moved).
 Laptops equipped with built-in wireless networking rarely have an exter-
nal antenna; the antenna is there — it’s just inside the laptop’s case.
 Yes, you can have both a wireless and standard NIC inside your PC.
The wireless network setup
Setting up a wireless network is done just like setting up a wired computer net-
work. Each computer must be equipped with a wireless networking adapter, and
all adapters must support or use the same standard, either 802.11b or 802.11g.
At the center of the network is a wireless hub, or router, also known as a base
station. It serves the same function as a hub does in a wired network: The base
station is responsible for receiving the wireless transmissions and sending
them on to the other computers in the network.
Figure 19-1 shows a sample wireless network setup, which looks disturbingly
like Figure 18-1, over in Chapter 18, mostly because the only real difference is
the lack of wires. Note that most wireless hubs or routers have the ability to
let you connect wire-based networks as well, so you can share your network
between existing wired connections and wireless ones.
231
Chapter 19: Look, Ma: No Wires!

To connect broadband Internet to your wireless network, simply plug the
broadband modem into the wireless router. Most routers come with a con-
nection specifically designed for the broadband modem, so making this addi-
tion is a cinch.
What’s left over is making the connection on the software side. See the sec-
tion “Hooking into a Wireless Network,” later in this chapter.
Setting up the base station
The wireless base station requires a little more setup than a wired base sta-
tion. Here are some things you may want to configure on the base station, per

the instructions that came with it and using the base station’s controlling
program installed on your PC:
 Set a Service Set Identifier, or SSID, for your wireless network. This is the
name by which the wireless network is known.
 You have the option of making the SSID name visible or invisible. If secu-
rity is an issue, make the name invisible. That way, the base station
doesn’t broadcast the name, and only computers that know the name
can connect to the wireless network.
 Set the encryption for the network, known as the WEP, or Wired
Equivalent Privacy. Make sure that you note the password! It’s a long
string of numbers and letters, and you must enter it exactly to access
the network.
 You may hear or read that the password is optional. My opinion: It’s not.
Don’t compromise your network by omitting the password. In fact,
Windows XP may not even connect to a wireless network that lacks a
password.
 Optionally, configure the base station to allow connections only from
known computers. You specify this by listing the MAC address of the
wireless Ethernet adapter in each PC. Refer to Chapter 16 for informa-
tion on getting the MAC address.
 Tell the wireless router to provide IP addresses dynamically for all com-
puters on the network. This is also known as DHCP; refer to Chapter 16
for information on configuring the NIC to accept a dynamic IP address.
 If the base station offers firewall abilities, enable them.
 The base station may also serve as a router. Refer to Chapter 18 for
more information.
The most important pieces of information you need are the wireless net-
work’s SSID or name and the long, cryptic password you need in order to
access the network. I recommend that you write those things down and keep
them in a safe place.
“How far does the signal go?”
The 802.11 wireless networking standard uses radio signals to send and
receive information. Because of that, you don’t need to set up your network
so that all the computers have a direct line of sight to the base station. It’s
completely possible to have the wireless hub in one room and use a wireless
computer in another — though there are exceptions.
233
Chapter 19: Look, Ma: No Wires!

The key to the wireless network is the base station. Your PC’s wireless NIC
must be able to access the base station directly in order for that computer to
be on the network. The base station may advertise that it can broadcast its
signal up to 300 feet away — but that’s only under ideal conditions, like on
the barren wastes of the moon.
Amazingly enough, things like walls can greatly decrease the reception of a
base station’s wireless signal. In fact, a standard wood-and-plaster wall can
cut a wireless networking signal in half — or more. If the walls are brick or
metal, no signal may get through at all.
If you’re having any problem with your wireless signal, try moving either the
PC or the base station. Also, adjusting the directional antenna on the base
station or PC may help.
 Most offices that use wireless networking keep a base station in every
room that has wireless computers. The base stations are then hard-
wired together to help build the network.
 I mount my base stations high up, either near or on the ceiling where
there is little interference from other things in the room. Even setting a
book down in front of a base station may disrupt the signal enough to
disconnect a remote computer from the network.
Hooking into a Wireless Network
You have to be deliberate when you use wires to connect a network. One wire
can go into only one plug at a time. But, with wireless networking, you often
have a choice of which wireless network you want to connect to.
For example, if you’re in a high-tech yet densely populated part of town, you
may discover that dozens of wireless networks are set up, each of which is
detected by your computer. Some are closed or password protected, and
others may be open. This section tells you how to scan for a wireless network
or how to hook into one specific network, if that’s all you want to do.
Connecting to your own wireless network
Follow these steps to connect your wireless PC to a wireless network.
Remember that what you’re really connecting to is the base station that pro-
vides the central access point for all the other wireless computers in the net-
work. Here’s what you do:
234
Part III: Networking Nonsense 

1. Open the Network Connections window.
You can get there by double-clicking the Network Connections icon in
the Control Panel.
2. Right-click the wireless network connection’s icon.
3. Choose View Available Wireless Connections from the pop-up menu.
The Wireless Network Connection dialog box shows up, as depicted in
Figure 19-2. This dialog box lists any and all wireless networks that are
within range of your laptop and compatible with your wireless network-
ing protocol.
If your wireless networking gear supports more than one protocol, you
see every matching protocol appear in the window.
In Figure 19-2, one network shows up as available. Its name is KITTY,
which is the network’s SSID.
4. Select the wireless network’s name (if you have more than one).
5. Enter the password twice.
You should have written down the password when you first configured
the wireless base station. Or, if you’re in a cybercafé or other remote
location, the password is provided for you. Yes, you have to type that
sucker twice, which can be a real pain, especially for those 128-character
passwords.
6. Click the Connect button.
If everything goes well, you see the little networking buddies appear in
the notification area, plus a pop-up bubble alerting you to the wireless
networking connection (see Figure 19-3). You’ve made it!
Figure 19-2:

Chapter 19: Look, Ma: No Wires!

If the preceding steps don’t work, you can try a back-door approach to finding
and accessing any available wireless networks. In the Network Connections
window, right-click your Wireless Network Connection icon and choose
Properties from the pop-up menu. Then click the Wireless Networks tab in
your network connection’s Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 19-4.
Using the Wireless Networks tab may be necessary when switching from one
wireless connection to another. The bottom part of the dialog box (labeled
Preferred Networks) is used to store connection information about various
networks so that you don’t have to toil with the same connection information
again and again.
Scanning for wireless networks
Your wireless network adapter came with a host of software, most of which
you can cheerfully ignore. One program that’s quite handy and often comes

with the wireless NIC is a scanning tool. Often, this tool is much better than
the simple, primitive programs Windows offers.
Figure 19-5 shows a network scanning tool that came with my laptop PC’s
wireless networking hardware. It shows five available networks. Two are sup-
pressing the SSID, or network name. The two Linksys networks have no pass-
word; encryption is disabled. (Such a thing is typical when people set up
wireless networking: They forget to rename the wireless hub, and they don’t
apply password protection.)

What is Bluetooth?
Bluetooth is the name of a wireless gizmo stan-
dard, which can be confused with wireless net-
working, although the only similarity between
the two is the wireless part.
The Bluetooth standard allows for various
gizmos or PC peripherals to wirelessly commu-
nicate with each other over short distances. For
example, you could buy a Bluetooth expansion
card and allow your PC to talk wirelessly with
compatible Bluetooth peripherals, such as a
keyboard, a mouse, a printer, or even a monitor.
Theoretically, you could use a Bluetooth MP3
music player with your PC and then take it into
your Bluetooth-enabled car and hear the music
in the car.
Although Bluetooth has been around a while, it’s
not really popular on the PC. Someday, it may be
an interface worth knowing about and using,
but for now it’s just one of many wireless solu-
tions for adding peripherals to your PC.
All Bluetooth devices sport the Bluetooth
symbol, which I would illustrate in this book if
computer companies weren’t so uptight about
their trademarks.

Wireless utilities, such as the one shown in Figure 19-5, can also be used to
scan for and connect to available wireless networks. Often, these utilities are
far easier to manage than what Windows offers.
 These wireless scanners usually sport an icon in the notification area.
The icon generally offers feedback regarding the signal strength of the
wireless network.
 Scanning for unprotected wireless networks is known as war driving,
often because a guy in a car with a laptop can do it and get free Internet
access when unprotected wireless networks are found.

 Viewing filename extensions
 Understanding icons
 Saving files to disk
E
very day, millions of people sit down at a computer and go about their
work. They do e-mail. They process words. They browse the Internet.
They play games. Some work may be done. Because computers have become
easier to use over the past few years, it’s relatively easy for anyone to sit
down at a computer and do something. Even so, the computer remains a mys-
terious and often frustrating device for most people.
The problem with computers is that the software is so easy to use that no
one bothers taking that extra bonus step of understanding how things work.
Despite your ability to get work done, you really need to know a few software
basics to get the most from your computer. I’m serious! It all starts with the
knowledge unfolded in this chapter, the nucleus of all software: the file.
Do You Know What a File Is?
I would guess that 80 percent of everyone who uses a PC doesn’t have the
slightest idea what a file is. Yes, there is a File menu. You save files to disk
and you open files on disk. But, only when you truly understand what a file is
can you begin to really appreciate your computer and start to take control of
the beast.

Presenting the file
A file is a chunk of information stored in a computer. The word file is used
because, in an office setting, information is traditionally stored on paper and
those papers are grouped into files, stored in a file cabinet. The same analogy
applies to computer files, though I don’t think that the comparison has been
successful.
When you think of a file, don’t think of a paper file at all. Instead, the file is a
container. The container can be very small or very large. Unlike a printed
sheet of paper, a file can contain a variety of stuff. The container keeps that
stuff together and separate from other containers, which also contain stuff
separate from other containers.
 A file is really nothing more than a container, a place to hold a chunk of
information stored in a computer.
 I think file is a bad choice for describing something stored in a com-
puter. Had I been one of the computing pioneers, I would have called it a
container or holder or even made up a word using flowery Greek or Latin.
The problem with file is that it’s ambiguous and doesn’t adequately
describe the nature of the “container o’ stuff” inside a computer. Also, 
as with many computer terms, file is used as both a noun and a verb.
What’s in a file?
On the atomic level, all the information in a file is binary, or just a series of
ones and zeroes, like this:
1100010011011110111001011010010110111001100111100001
Boring! Computers can do miraculous things with ones and zeroes, however,
so — categorically speaking — there are really three types of files:
 Documents
 Programs
 Data files
These types describe the contents of the file, or how the ones and zeroes are
interpreted by the software you use.
A document includes any file you’ve created. It can be a true text document,
such as a to-do list, a chapter of a novel, or a note to Jimmy’s teacher explain-
ing that his skin condition isn’t contagious. Documents can also be sound
files, graphics images, or any other type of information the computer can
create, store, or seize from the Internet.
242
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Program files contain instructions for the computer’s microprocessor; they
tell the computer what to do. Note that programs are also files. Even the
operating system, which is a program, is also a file. In fact, the operating
system consists of many files.
Data files include all other files on disk that aren’t exactly programs or docu-
ments. These include support files for programs, temporary files, and other
random stuff that must be saved inside the computer.
Everything stored inside the computer is a file. There are files you create,
program files you buy, program files that are part of the operating system,
and data files that make up just about everything else. Everything is a file!
Describing a file
Just as people are different, so are files. People are described by how they
look and act and by their given names. People also have birthdays and live in
certain places. The same is almost entirely true for files, though files don’t
usually get moody or care whether other files think that they’re fat.
All files stored inside the computer have various attributes, or specific ways
of describing the files and keeping each file unique and separate from the
other files. Five of these attributes help you not only identify what the file is
but also keep each file unique:
 Name
 Size
 Date and time
 Type
 Icon
All files have a name, or filename. The name describes the file’s contents or
gives you a clue to what the file will be used for. The name is given to the file
when it’s created. This is true for all files.
Files have a physical size. They occupy storage space inside memory, and they
also occupy storage space on disk. Some files are tiny, some can be quite large.
When a file is created, the operating system slaps it just like a doctor slaps a
human baby. But a file doesn’t breathe, and it lacks a butt, so what’s slapped on
it is a date-and-time stamp. This stamp helps keep your files organized and
allows you to sort through your files based on their creation dates and times. A
second date-and-time stamp is applied to a file whenever it’s updated, changed,
or modified. (The original creation date and time remain the same.)
243
Chapter 20: Files: The Key to Understanding Software

Finally, each file has a type, which is closely related to the file’s icon you see
in Windows. The file type depends on the file’s contents, and each program
that creates a document assigns that file a specific type and related icon. This
is a big topic, so it’s covered later in this chapter, starting with the section
“File Types and Icons.”
 The size of a file is measured in bytes, just like memory. Refer to Chapter 9
for more information on bytes.
 A file can be zero bytes in size, in which case the file exists, but lacks
any contents.
 The largest a file can be is 4GB. Rarely, however, do files get that big.
 The date-and-time stamp is one reason that the PC has an internal clock.
It also explains why it’s important to keep the PC’s clock up to date.
Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on setting the clock.
 Additional attributes are used to describe files — for example, whether 
a file is a system file, hidden, read-only, compressed, archived, and a
bunch of other trivial things. The operating system keeps track of all
that stuff.
Files dwell in folders
Another description of a file, missing from the list in the preceding section, is
that files are all stored on disk in containers called folders. Again with the file
cabinet metaphor! Will they ever learn?
The folder helps keep files organized, which allows you to separate files into
groups for similar things. Using folders is one key way to keep from going
insane when you use the computer — just as using a closet or cupboard is a
way of keeping stuff around the house organized.
Folders are a big part of organizing and using files, so they’re covered by
themselves, in Chapter 21. That chapter also covers the Windows Explorer
program, mentioned in this chapter.
Slap a Name on That File
All files need to have names, and it’s good that the computer affords you the
opportunity to name your files. If things were up to the computer, files would
be named like car license plates, but without the optional wildlife or histori-
cal themes.
Because the computer lets you, the human, name the files, you can get as flow-
ery and creative as you were when you named the dog or your motorcycle or
244
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

that comet you discovered. Have fun! Be playful! This section reviews the
basics for naming files.
Choosing the best name
Be clever when you name a file! Naming stuff is one thing humans are good at.
I’m referring to older humans, of course. If 2-year-olds were in charge of
naming things, all animals would be called “dog.”
You name a file when you’re saving it to disk, which happens in the Save As
dialog box (see the section “Using the Save As dialog box,” later in this chap-
ter). When naming a file, be brief and descriptive. Try using only letters, num-
bers, and spaces in the name. For example:
Agenda
Chapter 16
Trip to Branson
2006 May Expense Report
Places in Town to Dump Toxic Waste
Each of these examples is a good filename, which properly explains the file’s
contents.
 Upper- or lowercase doesn’t matter. Although capitalizing Pocatello 
is proper, for example, Windows recognizes that filename the same 
as pocatello, Pocatello, POCATELLO, or any combination of upper- and 
lowercase letters.
 Though case doesn’t matter in a filename, it does matter when you’re
typing a Web page address.
 The file’s name reminds you of what’s in the file, of what it’s all about —
just like naming your car Ticket Magnet tells everyone what the car is all
about.
 You can rename a file at any time after it has been created. See Chapter 22
for information on the Rename command.
 All the rules for naming files in this and the following subsections also
apply to naming folders, though folders are covered in Chapter 21.
Official file-naming rules
Here’s the law when it comes to naming files in Windows. All this stuff is
optional reading; as long as you stick with the simple rules in the preceding
subsection, this stuff is merely trivia.
245
Chapter 20: Files: The Key to Understanding Software

Characters: Files can be named using any combination of letters and num-
bers, plus a smattering of symbols.
Length: Technically, you can give a file a name that’s over 200 characters
long. Don’t. Long filenames may be very descriptive, but Windows displays
them funny or not at all in many situations. Better to keep things short than
to abuse long-filename privileges.
Forbidden characters: Windows gets angry if you use any of these characters
to name a file:
* / : < > ? \ | “
These symbols hold a special meaning to Windows. Nothing bad happens if
you attempt to use these characters. Windows just refuses to save the file —
or a warning dialog box growls at you.
Use periods sparingly: Although you can use any number of periods in a file-
name, you cannot name a file with all periods. I know that it’s strange, and I’m
probably the only one on the planet to have tried it, but it doesn’t work.
Spaces: Filenames can contain spaces. Try not to start a filename with a
space, though, because it’s difficult to see. It’s common in computerland to
use the underscore (or underline) character rather than a space.
Numbers are okay: Feel free to start a filename by using a number. You can
even use symbols, though not the forbidden characters just listed. I mention
this because there are rumors out there about not starting a filename with a
number. Poppycock.
File Types and Icons
Who knows what evil lurks inside a file? Well, honestly, no one does! A file by
itself knows nothing of its contents. In fact, the best the operating system can
do is to guess about a file’s contents. Most of the time, it makes a good guess.
The system used to determine the stuff of a file’s guts, however, isn’t that solid.
The key is something called the filename extension. That extension is used 
by Windows to help identify not only the file’s contents (it’s type), but also
which program created the file and which icon is displayed on the screen.
This section mulls all this over.
246
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

The supersecret filename extension
The filename extension is a secret bit of text added to a filename when the file
is first created. The filename extension is applied by the program used to
create the file. It tells the operating system three things:
 The type of file that’s created — document, graphics, or sound, for
example
 The program that created the file
 Which icon to use to represent the file
It’s the extension that offers a clue to what’s inside a file, and the operating
system relies heavily on that extension.
Filename extension details
The filename extension is the last part of a filename, usually hidden from
view. It starts with a period, which is then followed by one to four characters.
For most files, the extension is three characters long.
For example, the .doc filename extension is used by Microsoft Word to iden-
tify Word documents. The extension is pronounced “dot dock,” with the dot
or period followed by DOC, which is short for document.
Web page files use the .HTM or .HTML filename extension.
Graphics files have a number of filename extensions, depending on the graph-
ics file type: JPG, GIF, TIFF, and PNG, for example.
Note that it’s common to write the extension without the leading period,
though in a filename the period and extension are there. For example:
Chapter 20.DOC
The name of this chapter’s document file on disk is Chapter 20.DOC. You
may see only Chapter 20 on the screen, but the DOC part is there.
 There are gazillions of common filename extensions.
 Most program files in Windows use the EXE extension, where EXE stands
for executable file.
247
Chapter 20: Files: The Key to Understanding Software

 A full list of filename extensions is maintained on the Internet, at this
Web page:
www.filext.com
 A filename extension is created by the program used to create the file.
The extension is added automatically, and it’s necessary in Windows. As
the computer operator, it helps if you know about extensions, but
beyond that, don’t mess with them.
How to see or hide a filename extension
You can tell Windows whether you want the filename extension displayed
when you view a list of files. Most beginners prefer to hide the extension; old-
time PC users like to see the extension. Either way, showing or hiding the
extension is done in the same place. Abide by these steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
The window you see displayed is the Windows Explorer program, which
is used to examine files and stuff stored in your computer. (Read more
on that in Chapter 21.)
2. Choose Tools➪Folder Options.
3. Click the View tab in the Folder Options dialog box.
4. Locate the item on the list that says Hide extensions for known
file types.
5. Put a check mark there to hide the extensions, or remove the check
mark so that Windows displays the extensions.
Or, if the item is already set the way you like, you’re just dandy.
6. Click OK to close the Folder Options dialog box.
7. Close the My Computer window.
If you elect to show the extension, refer to the next subsection for important
information on renaming extensions.
Keep in mind that it’s Windows job to maintain filename extensions. You
should really never mess with them, whether you see them or not.
Don’t rename the extension
If you have configured Windows to display filename extensions (refer to the
preceding subsection), be careful when you assign a file a new name by using
the Rename command: You must not rename the extension!
248
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

The filename extension is just an extra appendage on a filename. It’s utterly
possible to rename the extension — or delete it. But, when you do so, you
deny Windows the opportunity to know what’s really in the file. It really
messes things up!
Fortunately, Windows warns you when it comes time to rename a file and you
either forget to keep the same filename extension or type a new one. When
that happens, use the Rename command again, and carefully edit the name
so that you keep the file’s original extension.
See Chapter 22 for more information on renaming files.
Icons
Windows is a graphical operating system, and, as such, it uses icons, or tiny
pictures, to represent files. The picture supposedly relates directly to the
type of file as well as to the program that created the file. After reading the
previous subsections, you should recognize that both those attributes are
directly related to the filename extension.
Figure 20-1 shows a file as Windows displays it; a graphical icon representing
a Word document appears, along with the full filename, including the .DOC
extension.
Each filename extension, or file type, sports a unique icon in Windows, as you
discover while you use Windows.
Creating Files
Files are created by using programs — software. Specifically, the software
that creates stuff is called an application. For example, you use the word pro-
cessing application Microsoft Word to create text documents, brochures,
novels, plays, and left-wing manifestos.
Figure 20-1:

Chapter 20: Files: The Key to Understanding Software

The good news is that it’s easy to create things with a computer and the
proper software. The bad news is that the computer happily and repeatedly
loses anything you create — until you save that something to disk.
Saving to disk is important! Nothing is truly created until you save!
It doesn’t matter how long you worked to create the thing — the document,
image, or whatever: Until you’ve used the Save command, that information
exists only in the wispy gossamer of the computer’s fickle imagination (also
known as RAM). Pull the plug and — POOF! — that stuff is gone for good.
To avoid disaster you must save your stuff to disk. Your tool for doing so is
the Save command.
The Save command
Windows has two Save commands: Save and Save As. Both exist on the 
File menu.
The first time you save your stuff to disk, the Save As command is used (even
if you choose File➪Save). Save As directs Windows to give the file a name and
save it on a specific disk drive and in a specific folder. The Save As command
creates the file.
After your stuff is saved to disk with Save As and the new file is created, you
use the plain Save command to update the file. So, after initially saving, you
work a little bit, and then you use the Save command, File➪Save, to update
the file on disk. It works this way until you’re done, when you save one last
time before quitting the program.
 The Save command can also be accessed from the Save button on a tool-
bar or by pressing Ctrl+S on the keyboard.
 If your stuff hasn’t yet been saved, using the Save command is the same
as the using Save As command.
 You can also use the Save As command specifically to save a file with a
new name or in a new location.
 After a file has been saved, the file’s name appears on the title bar (at
the top of the window).
Using the Save As dialog box
The first time you save your stuff to disk, a Save As dialog box appears. The
purpose of this dialog box is, obviously, to save your precious work to disk,
250
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

or permanent storage. That way, you always have a copy of your stuff handy
for future use.
The Save As dialog box is also the place where you assign your stuff a file
name and set the file in a specific folder on a specific disk drive. (Folders are
covered in Chapter 21.)
Figure 20-2 shows the typical Save As dialog box. It contains a lot of controls
specifically designed to baffle the new computer user. What you need to find
specifically is the text box, near the bottom, labeled File Name. That’s where
you type the name of the file you’re saving.
Here’s how the Save As dialog box works on the simplest level:
1. Type a name for your file.
Refer to the file-naming rules earlier in this chapter. Be clever. Be
descriptive. Be brief.
2. Click the Save button.
The file is safely stored on your hard disk.
Trust me: The file is saved to disk. There’s no need to confirm this. Had there
been an error, Windows would promptly inform you.
If the Save button doesn’t work, you probably used a forbidden character in
the filename or used the name of a file that has already been saved. The more
polite programs tell you specifically the booboo you’ve made. Ruder programs
just don’t let you click the Save button.
Figure 20-2:
The typical
Save As
dialog box.
251
Chapter 20: Files: The Key to Understanding Software

Additional controls in the Save As dialog box allow you to select a specific
disk drive and folder for your stuff. I recommend that you read Chapter 21,
on folders, before you attempt to do that.
 The Save As dialog box appears only the first time you save your stuff to
disk; from that point on, the Save command merely resaves a file to disk.
 Not every Save As dialog box looks like the one shown in Figure 20-2.
Some are very complex, depending on the program. Also, when saving
some types of files, additional dialog boxes may appear and prompt you
for more input about the file being saved.
 To save the file in a specific folder, open that folder in the main part of the
Save As dialog box. (Open the folder by double-clicking with the mouse.)
 You can also choose a specific folder (or disk drive) from the Save In
drop-down list.
 Click the New Folder button to create a new folder for your stuff. Refer to
the section “Let There Be Folders,” in Chapter 21, for more information.
 If you’ve directed Windows not to display the filename extension, you
don’t see the extension used in the Save As dialog box. On the other
hand, if the extensions are visible, you see them as shown in Figure 20-2,
where it says (in very tiny letters) “.rtf” after the filename.
 The Save As Type drop-down list directs the program to save the file as a
specific file type. This tool can be used to override the program’s normal
file type and save your stuff in a specific type. For example, you can use
this option to save a Word document in the plain text (TXT) file type.
Mess with the option only when you know that you want to save the file
as a different type.

tuff happens, and on your PC, you soon discover that it happens quite
a bit! If you do any work at all with your computer, you soon discover
yourself buried hip deep in files. Files everywhere! Files you created, files you
downloaded from the Internet, and files that seem to grow like freckles on a
redhead. What to do, what to do?
The solution to the file flood is a wee bit of organization. It comes from the
concept known as a folder, which is the first step in organizing your stuff.
Even programs and Windows itself use folders for organizing things, which
makes the folder the equivalent of the California Closet or extra bonus garage
shelving — what everyone with a lot of stuff needs. This chapter explains
how it’s all done.
The Folder Story
Folders exist to organize your files, which continues with the office metaphor
that computers use — the one I totally dismiss in Chapter 20. Folders are
merely containers for files. Folders keep files of similar types together, or
they allow you to organize files by project, date, or however you want to use
them to keep your stuff sane.

Yes! Sanity is the key! Without folders, files would litter the hard drive like
pieces of a casino after a Las Vegas demolition. The typical PC hard drive
now stores between 10,000 and 50,000 files. Imagine finding your one file!
Heck, it would take you a week to scroll through the list. I won’t even go into
the madness of duplicate filenames and how sluggish the computer would
behave any time you saved or opened anything on disk. Yech!
No, folders are the key to organizing files on your computer’s hard drive.
Windows uses them. You should use them as well.
 A folder is a storage place for files.
 Refer to Chapter 20 for information on files. It’s very important!
Understanding files is the key to using software on your computer.
 All files stored on your computer’s hard drive are kept in folders. The
folders keep files together — like barbed wire keeps prisoners, vicious
animals, and kindergartners from wandering off.
 Folders appear in Windows using the folder icon, as shown in the
margin. To open the folder, double-click it with the mouse. This action
displays the folder’s contents in a window — the folder window.
 Folders hold files. They can also hold other folders. Folders within fold-
ers! Just like those Russian matryoshka dolls.
 Folders may also be referred to as directories. This term is merely a
throwback to the old days of DOS (which is a throwback to the days of
Unix, which King Herod used).
Famous Folders throughout History
Whether you like it or not, all your computer’s disk drives are organized into
folders. Disk drives exist to store files, and files must be stored in folders.
Beyond that, some specific and aptly named folders are available on your PC
when you run the Windows operating system. This section mulls over the lot
of them.
The root folder
Every disk — even the stupid floppy disk — has at least one folder. That one
folder — the main folder on the disk — is the root folder. Like a tree (and this
isn’t a dog joke), all other folders on your hard drive branch out from that
main, root folder.
The root folder doesn’t have a specific icon. Instead, it uses the icon for the
drive that the root folder is on. So, the root folder on drive C has the same
icon as drive C. You can see those icons in the My Computer window.
254
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

 The root folder is simply the main, or only, folder on a disk drive.
 The root folder is like the lobby of some grand building: It’s merely a
place you pass through to get to somewhere else. Where else? Why,
other folders, of course!
 The root folder may also be called the root directory.
The subfolder
When one folder exists inside another, it is said to be a subfolder. This term
has nothing to do with underwater naval vessels or hoagy-like sandwiches.
For example, you may be told to open the My Documents folder. Then, you
may be told to open the My Pictures subfolder. That simply means that My
Pictures is the name of a folder within the My Documents folder — a folder
within a folder.
 In addition to holding files, folders can hold more folders.
 No limit exists on the number of subfolders you can create. You can
have a folder inside a folder inside a folder, and so on. If you name the
folders well, it all makes sense. Otherwise, it’s just like a badly organized
filing cabinet, though without the smell of booze.
 A subfolder can also be called a child folder.
 The parent folder is the folder that contains the subfolder. So, if Windows
is a folder inside the root folder, the root folder is the parent folder and
Windows is the child folder.
 Yes, parent folder and child folder are terms rarely used. And the people
said “A-men!”
The My Documents folder
The root folder is for the computer itself; humans don’t use it. Instead,
Windows offers a place for your stuff on the computer (a home plate, as
it were), where you can save the files you create or make numerous new fold-
ers to keep your stuff organized. That place, that famous folder, is the My
Documents folder.
The My Documents folder is your personal folder in Windows, where you can
freely and wantonly store your stuff.
Because the My Documents folder is so important, you have many easy ways
to get to the folder and display its contents: You can open the My Documents
icon on the desktop; choose My Documents from the Start button’s menu;
255
Chapter 21: Organizing Your Compu-Junk

click the My Documents button on the left side of any Open or Save As dialog
box; plus many, many more wonderful and confusing ways.
 Use the My Documents folder as the main place for storing the stuff you
create or collect in your computer.
 Also make use of folders to organize your stuff within the My Documents
folder. This topic is covered throughout the rest of this chapter.
 The My Documents folder is generally found on drive C, where Windows
dwells. If your PC has other hard drives, you can also use them to store
your stuff. In that case, it’s okay to use the root folder on those drives.
Oh, my — my folders
The My Documents folder contains some pre-made folders to help you get
into the notion of organizing your stuff. Here’s a sampling of some of the
other folders — subfolders — you may find there:
My Pictures: This is the folder where many graphics applications yearn to
save the images you create. See? It’s organization in action, and you haven’t
even done anything yet!
My Music: This folder is used by many audio programs — specifically,
Windows Media Player — for storing the various music files you save on
your PC.
My Videos: Getting the hint? The My Videos folder is used to store video files
on a computer. Already, you can smell the organization happening: If you
want to save a video file, you choose the My Documents folder, open the My
Videos folder, and then save the file there. Celebration organization!
My Goodness: During the course of your Windows travels, you may find other
folders created in the My Documents folder, either by some program or by
yourself. Use the folders for the specific documents they describe. And, if
things don’t go into folders, consider creating the popular Misc or Junk folder.
Famous Yet Forbidden Folders
In addition to needing folders for your stuff, your computer needs folders for
the stuff Windows uses and folders for your applications. These are what I
call the forbidden folders; don’t mess with them!
 Though you may someday poke around inside a forbidden folder, don’t
mess with anything there.
256
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

 Use the My Documents folder, or any of its subfolders, to store your
stuff. Don’t store your stuff in a forbidden folder.
 Delete only those folders you created yourself, such as any folder in the
My Documents folder. Don’t mess with anything elsewhere, such as in
the Windows or Program Files folders.
 Mess with a forbidden folder only if you’re specifically directed to do so.
 The root folder of the hard drive is considered forbidden.
The Windows folder
Windows itself lives in the Windows folder, which may be named WINNT on
some computers. This folder contains many files and a heck of a lot of sub-
folders, all of which comprise the Windows operating system and its support
programs. Touch ye not the files that lurketh there!
You may occasionally hear the Windows folder (and its subfolders) referred
to by their official corporate name, the system folders.
The Program Files folder
The software you use on your PC also has its own home plate, called the
Program Files folder. Within that folder are numerous subfolders, one each
for the various programs installed on your computer — or perhaps one gen-
eral folder for all programs from a specific vendor. Oh, bother — why not
take a look?
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Open the drive C icon.
This step displays the root folder for drive C.
3. Open the Program Files folder.
The Program Files window appears and shows you all the folders for all
the software installed on your PC.
Look, but don’t touch.
4. Close the Program Files window.
See how each program lives in its own folder? Those folders may even have
subfolders for further organization. For example, the Adobe folder may con-
tain a subfolder for the Adobe Acrobat Reader program and then another
folder for some other Adobe product you may have on your PC.
257
Chapter 21: Organizing Your Compu-Junk

Other folders, mysterious and evil
The computer’s C drive is chock full of folders. What do they do? I don’t
know! I don’t think anyone knows, but that’s not the point. The point is to use
only the My Documents folder and those subfolders you create inside My
Documents. Any other folder is considered hands-off.
Don’t mess with any folder you didn’t create yourself! You can look, but don’t
do anything else!
The Windows Explorer Program
One of the duties of an operating system is to help you organize the stuff you
create. It’s Windows job to put files on the hard drive, organize the files into
folders, and keep track of all that stuff. Furthermore, Windows presents the
file and folder information to you in a simple manner, which allows you to
control your files and folders without the necessity of a second brain. The
tool you use to help manipulate those files and folders is a program called
Windows Explorer.
Note that Windows Explorer isn’t the same program as Internet Explorer,
though they’re both similar in appearance.
Running the Windows Explorer program
Windows Explorer is one of the easiest programs to run. My favorite way to
start it is to press Win+E on the keyboard. You can also right-click the My
Documents or My Computer icon on the desktop and choose Explore from
the pop-up menu. The Windows Explorer program is shown in Figure 21-1.
In Figure 21-1, Windows Explorer displays the files and folders found in the
My Documents folder. You can see My Documents up on the title bar, which
tells you which folder you’re viewing. The contents of the folder appear on
the right; toolbars and other information are on the top and left sides of the
window.
If you don’t see the toolbar in the Windows Explorer window, choose View➪
Toolbars➪Standard Buttons. You may also want to choose Address Bar from
the Toolbars submenu.

Opening a folder
Any time you double-click a folder icon, the Windows Explorer program runs
and displays the contents of that folder, as shown in Figure 21-1.
When you open a file, also by double-clicking it, the program that created the
file runs and displays the file’s contents. Well, it may not be exactly the pro-
gram that created the file: For example, graphics files may be displayed in a
“viewer” program, not the exact program that created the image.
When you open a program file, the program runs.
Opening a folder inside a folder window displays that folder’s contents; the
window changes to reflect the opened folder’s contents. You can configure
Windows so that each folder opens into its own folder window. To do so,
heed these steps:
1. In the folder window, choose Tools➪Options.
The Folder Options dialog box appears.

2. On the General tab, click to choose the option labeled Open Each
Folder in Its Own Window.
3. Click OK.
Don’t forget to close all those open folder windows when you’re done with
them.
Viewing the tree structure
The whole mess of folders on your hard drive is organized into something
the computer nerds call the tree structure. It can be seen on the left side of
the Windows Explorer window, titled Folders, as shown in Figure 21-1. If you
don’t see that list, click the Folders button on the Explorer toolbar. Or, you
can choose View➪Explorer Bar➪Folders from the menu.
You manipulate the tree structure by using the mouse to quickly navigate to a
specific folder in your computer system — if you know where to go. Just click
a folder to display its contents on the right side of the window.
You click the + (plus sign) by a folder to open it up and reveal any subfolders.
Click the – (minus sign) by a folder to close that “branch” of the tree structure.
Not viewing the tree structure
When the Folders panel is hidden, the Windows Explorer program displays a
list of tasks for your files and folders, as shown in Figure 21-2. These tasks
provide links to things to do with the files in the folder, other places to go,
and similar tasks.
The tasks that are displayed vary, depending on the type of folder that’s
viewed or whether a file is selected and what type of file it is.
Note that each task panel can be displayed or hidden by clicking the up or
down chevrons (see the margin).
Viewing the files in a folder
The Views button, on the far right side of the Windows Explorer toolbar, dis-
plays a menu that controls how icons are displayed in the window:
Filmstrip: Best for previewing graphics files (available only in folders config-
ured for viewing graphical images).
260
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Thumbnails: Also good for viewing graphics files; previews the images inside
the files in a tiny window instead of displaying the file icon.
Tiles: Displays large icons to represent the files stored in a folder.
Icons: Displays smaller icons to represent files.
List: Displays files in a list, with a very small icon and then the filename.
Details: Allows you to see detailed information about the files in a folder, dis-
played in columns.
If you have oodles of time to waste, click the button and choose a different
view. (I like Large Icons view, but my friend Julia detests it.)
 These options can also be chosen from the View menu.
 Details view is best for finding out information about the files in a folder.
It lists information such as file size, date and time, file type, and other
bonus goodies.

Let There Be Folders
I can’t leave the folder chapter without a few key words on creating folders.
Hopefully, this task will be something you do routinely as you organize the
stuff on your PC’s hard drive.
Creating a folder is easy. Remembering to use the folder is the hard part. The
following steps create a folder named Stuff in the My Documents folder on
drive C:
1. Double-click the My Documents icon on the Windows desktop.
If the folder appears messy, choose View➪Arrange Icons➪By Name from
the menu. This step alphabetizes the folder’s contents.
2. Choose File➪New➪Folder.
The new folder appears. Its name is New Folder, but note that the name
is selected. It means that you can type a new folder name immediately.
3. Type Stuff.
The folder is named Stuff, which is what you type at the keyboard. That
name replaces the insipid New Folder as the folder’s name.
4. Press Enter to lock in the name.
The new folder is ready for use.
You can double-click the new folder’s icon to open it. A blank window
appears because it’s a new folder and has no contents. See Chapter 22 for
information on copying or moving files into the folder.
 Be clever with the name! Remember that this folder will contain files and
possibly other folders, all of which should relate somehow to the
folder’s name.
 Generally speaking, folders are manipulated like files. After creating a
folder, you can rename it, move it, copy it, delete it, or make a shortcut
to the folder. See Chapter 22 for those details.
 A special type of folder is the compressed folder, also known as a zip file.
For more information on that type of folder, refer to my Web site and
look for the E-Doc on archiving:

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Using the Open Dialog Box
As you use your computer, you often find yourself digging through folders
with the Open command, off to fetch a file somewhere on disk. For example,
you want to open that document you worked on yesterday, the one that con-
tains the secret plans for invading Finland.
To retrieve a file formerly saved to disk, you use the Open command. It’s on
the File menu, or you can click an Open command button on a toolbar (if
such a button is available). The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+O — O for Open.
The Open command displays the Open dialog box, which is used for fetching
files formerly saved to disk.
Figure 21-3 shows a typical Open dialog box, used by most programs in
Windows. The following steps explain how this dialog box is used:
The main part of the Open dialog box lists files — just like a Windows Explorer
window. In fact, you can even change the view (refer to the section “Viewing
the files in a folder,” earlier in this chapter).
If you see the file you want in the main part of the Open dialog box, click it
with the mouse. That selects the file and highlights it in the dialog box. Then,
you click the Open button. Windows obeys your command by fetching the file
you selected from disk and opening it in a window on the screen. You can then
do whatever you want with the file’s contents: look, edit, modify, print —
whatever.
Figure 21-3:
The typical
Open
dialog box.
263
Chapter 21: Organizing Your Compu-Junk

When you don’t see the file you want, you use various gizmos in the dialog
box to browse through other disk drives and folders. I recommend doing
these things to help hunt down that wayward file:
 Click the My Documents button (on the left side of the Open dialog box),
which displays the contents of the My Documents folder.
 Double-click to open any folder displayed on the file list.
 If you want to go back up to the preceding folder, click the handy Up One
Level button (as shown in the margin).
 Choose another folder from the Look In drop-down list, at the top of the
dialog box.
 Choose another disk drive from the Look In drop-down list and start
browsing through folders on that drive.
When you find your file, open it!
I hope that now you can appreciate properly naming files and folders — and
using those folders to organize your stuff. Don’t sweat it if you’ve misnamed
things. You can easily rename files and folders, as covered in Chapter 22.
 At the bottom of the dialog box is a drop-down list, labeled Files of Type.
It helps you narrow the kinds of files displayed on the Open dialog box’s
list. For example, in Figure 21-3, All Picture Files is selected, so any
graphics file appears on the list. To narrow the list, a specific file type
can be chosen.
 Note that not every program can open every type of file. Programs work
best on the files they create themselves.
 The Browse dialog box is similar to the Open dialog box. It appears
whenever you click a Browse button to hunt down a file for Windows.
 When you’re really stuck finding a file, use the Windows Search com-
mand. See Chapter 22.

 Making a file shortcut
 Deleting and undeleting files

Your files represent the stuff you create on your computer. As such,
they’re very important to you. The operating system understands this,
and it gives you a smattering of tools to control, manipulate, and maintain
your files. Control is the issue here! Like nuclear fuel or a room full of kinder-
garteners, your files must be contained. This chapter describes the tools 
you need to use to control your files.
Working with Groups of Files
Before you can mess with any file, you must select it. As with clogging, you
can select files individually or in groups.
To select a single file, click its icon once with the mouse. This step selects 
the file, which appears highlighted onscreen, similar to what’s shown in
Figure 22-1. The file is now ready for action.

 Clicking a file with the mouse selects that file.
 Selected files appear highlighted in the folder window.
 File manipulation commands — Copy, Move, Rename, and Delete, for
example — affect only selected files.
Selecting all the files in a folder
To select all the files inside a folder, choose Edit➪Select All from the menu.
This command highlights all files in the window — including any folders (and
all the folders’ contents), and marks them as ready for action.
You can also use the Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut to select all files in a folder.
Selecting a random smattering of files
Suppose that you need to select four icons in a folder all at once, similar to
what’s shown in Figure 22-2. Here’s how to do that:
1. Click to select the first file.
Point the mouse at the file’s icon and click once.
2. Press and hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard.
Either Ctrl (control) key works; press and hold it down.
Figure 22-2:
A random
smattering
of files is
selected.
Figure 22-1:
The icon
(file) on the
right is
selected.
266
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

3. Click to select the next file.
By holding the Ctrl key, you can select as many files as your clicking
finger desires. (Otherwise, by clicking one file, you would unselect any-
thing already selected.)
4. Repeat Step 3 until you have selected all the files you want.
Or, until your clicking finger gets sore.
5. Release the Ctrl key when you’re done selecting files.
Now you’re ready to manipulate the selected files as a group.
To deselect a file from a group, just Ctrl+click it again.
Selecting a swath of files in a row
To select a queue of files, such as those shown in Figure 22-3, pursue these
steps:
1. Choose View➪List from the menu.
2. Click to select the first file in your group.
3. Press and hold the Shift key.
Either Shift key on the keyboard works.
Figure 22-3:
A group of
files in a
row is
selected.
267
Chapter 22: File Control

4. Click to select the last file in your group.
By holding down the Shift key, you select all the files between the first
click and second click, as shown in Figure 22-3.
5. Release the Shift key.
The files are now ready for action.
This file selection technique works best in List view. It works in other file
views as well, though not as predictably.
You can take advantage of various file sorting commands to arrange the files
in the list. Use the View➪Arrange Icons By submenu to choose how the files
line up. For example, you can sort the files alphabetically, by size, by date, or
by flavor.
Lassoing a group of files
Another way to select files as a group is to lasso them. Figure 22-4 illustrates
how to do it by dragging over the files with the mouse.
To lasso the files, start by pointing the mouse above and to the left of the
icon horde you want to rope. Holding down the mouse button, drag down
and to the right to create a rectangle surrounding (“lassoing”) the file icons,
as shown in Figure 22-4. Release the mouse button, and all the files you have
lassoed are selected as a group. A vocal “Yee-ha!” is considered appropriate
in this circumstance.
Figure 22-4:
Lasso a
group of
files with
the mouse.
268
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Selecting all but a single file
This handy trick is one I use all the time. For example, if I want to select all
files in a folder except for one file (or folder), here’s what I do:
1. Click or Ctrl+click to select the file or files you don’t want selected.
2. Choose Edit➪Invert Selection from the menu.
Now, all the selected files are unselected, and all the unselected files are
selected — and ready for action!
This trick beats having to select all the files and try to hunt for those you
didn’t want selected in the first place.
Mixing selection techniques
Working with groups of files is something you do often, so one of the tech-
niques in the previous subsections can, hopefully, help you select files fast
and easily. If not, keep in mind that you can mix and match techniques.
Suppose that you need to lasso two groups of files. If so, lasso the first 
group and then press and hold the Ctrl key to lasso and include the second
collection.
You can Shift+click to select a swath of files in a row and then go back and
Ctrl+click to remove specific files from that list.
Or, you can lasso a group of files you don’t want to select and then choose
Edit➪Invert Selection to unselect those files and select everything else.
When you select a folder, you’re selecting all the files and subfolders within
that folder. Be careful!
Unselecting stuff
To unselect a file, simply click anywhere in the folder (but not on an icon).
That action unselects any and all selected files in the folder. Or, you can close
the folder window, in which case Windows immediately forgets about any
selected files.
269
Chapter 22: File Control

Files Hither, Thither, and Yon
Files don’t stand still. You find yourself moving them, copying them, and
killing them off. If you don’t do those things, your hard drive gets all junky
and, out of embarrassment, you’re forced to turn off the computer when
friends come over.
Moving or copying files to another folder
Files are moved and copied all the time. Moving a file happens when you
transplant it from one folder to another folder. Copying happens when you
duplicate a file, by keeping the original in its place and making an exact copy
elsewhere.
Windows has about a dozen different ways to copy and move files. It may
have more, but I’ve lost count. Rather than bore you with every possible
alternative, here’s the way I prefer to move or copy a file or group of selected
files:
1. Select the files or folders you want to move or copy.
2a. For moving, choose Edit➪Move to Folder from the menu.
2b. For copying, choose Edit➪Copy to Folder from the menu.
The Move Items or Copy Items dialog box appears. Both work similarly,
though only the Move Items dialog box is shown as an example in 
Figure 22-5.
Figure 22-5:
The Move
Items 
dialog box.
270
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

3. Choose the destination folder from the scrolling list.
The scrolling list works like the tree structure thing, as covered in
Chapter 21.
4. Click the Move or Copy button.
The files are moved or copied from their current location to the folder
you selected.
The Copy command makes file duplicates, and the Move command moves
the files.
 If the destination folder doesn’t exist, you can create it: Click to select
the parent folder and then click the Make New Folder button. Give the
new folder a name and then choose it as the destination.
 To move or copy files or folders to another disk drive, simply choose
that drive’s letter from the list.
 Moving folders moves all the files and subfolders inside that folder. Be
careful when you do this: Windows may lose track of the documents pre-
viously opened in those folders.
 The popular My Documents folder is at the top of the list of folders in
the dialog box.
 Rather than copy a file, consider creating a shortcut instead. See the
section “Creating shortcuts,” later in this chapter.
Moving or copying files 
with cut-and-paste
In Windows, where everything is like kindergarten anyway, you cut and paste
files to move or copy them.
Moving a file is a cut-and-paste operation.
Copying a file is a copy-and-paste operation.
Here’s how it’s done:
1. Select the files you want to move or copy.
2a. To move the files, choose Edit➪Cut.
2b. To copy the files, choose Edit➪Copy.
271
Chapter 22: File Control

If you cut, the files appear dimmed in the window, which means that
they have been chosen for cutting. Nothing is wrong; keep moving on
with the next step.
3. Open the folder where you want the files moved or copied.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The files are moved or copied.
Windows remembers which files were cut or copied until you cut or copy
something else — so be methodical here. Don’t put off pasting!
 You can also use the handy keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+C for Copy, Ctrl+X
for Cut, and Ctrl+V for Paste.
 To cancel the operation, simply press the Esc (escape) key before you
paste the files. This action restores the cut files to a nondimmed state.
 Don’t eat the paste.
Moving or copying files 
can be such a drag
Perhaps the easiest way to move or copy a file is to have both the file’s
window and the destination window open on the desktop at the same time.
To move, simply drag an icon from one window to the other. To move a
group, select the icons and then drag them from one window to the other.
Copying files involves dragging their icons, but when you do, press and hold
the Ctrl key on the keyboard. You notice a small + (plus sign) appear by the
mouse pointer as you drag the icons. It’s your clue that the files are being
copied (duplicated).
When you’re dragging between folders on different disk drives, Windows
always elects to copy rather than move the files. To override this, press the
Shift key as you drag the files; the Shift key enforces the move operation, by
moving the files rather than copying them.
Duplicating a file
To make a duplicate, simply copy a file to its same folder. Use any of the tech-
niques for copying files that I cover earlier in this chapter.
272
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

The duplicate is created with the prefix Copy of and then the rest of the file-
name. That’s your clue that the file is a duplicate of the original stored in the
same folder.
Copying a file to a removable disk
For some reason, people have a hang-up with copying files to a floppy disk or
to any removable disk. It’s quite simple to do. Here’s how:
1. Ensure that a disk is in the drive, ready to accept the file.
Or, in the case of a digital memory card, ensure that the drive is
mounted in the card reader.
2. Select the files to copy.
3. Choose File➪Send To, and select the removable disk from the sub-
menu.
The Send To submenu lists all available removable disk drives to which
you can send the file — even a recordable CD or DVD, if your PC is
blessed with such hardware.
The files are copied to the drive as soon as you choose the command.
Always make certain that a disk is in the drive and that the disk is ready to
accept files before you copy.
 Do not remove the disk until the files have all been copied!
 Note that the options on the Send To submenu may be subtly different
on your computer; scan the menu carefully for your removable disk
drive.
 To copy files to another hard drive, use the Move or Copy commands,
covered earlier in this chapter.
 Be sure that you properly unmount a digital media card before you
remove it from the drive. Refer to the section “Removing a USB device,”
in Chapter 7.
 See Chapter 24 for more information on writing disks to a CD-R.
Creating shortcuts
A file shortcut is a 99 percent fat-free copy of a file. It enables you to access
the original file from anywhere on a computer’s disk system, but without the
273
Chapter 22: File Control

extra baggage required to copy the file all over creation. For example, you
can create a shortcut to Microsoft Word on the desktop, where you can
always get to it — much quicker than using the Start panel.
Making a shortcut is done the same way as copying and pasting a file, as dis-
cussed in the section “Moving or copying files with cut-and-paste,” earlier in
this chapter. The difference is that, rather than use the Paste command, you
choose Edit➪Paste Shortcut.
 To quickly create a shortcut on the desktop, right-click an icon and
choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut) from the pop-up menu.
 If no Edit➪Paste Shortcut command is available, right-click the mouse
on the destination. When a Paste Shortcut item appears on the pop-up
menu, use it.
 A shortcut icon has a little arrow in a white box nestled into its lower-
left corner (see the margin). This icon tells you that the file is a shortcut
and not the real McCoy.
 Shortcuts are often named Shortcut to, followed by the original file’s
name. You can edit out the Shortcut to part, if you like. Refer to the
section “Renaming files,” earlier in this chapter.
 Have no fear when you’re deleting shortcuts: Removing a shortcut icon
doesn’t remove the original file.
Deleting files
Part of maintaining the disk drive closet is the occasional cleaning binge or
spring-cleaning bustle. This task involves not only organizing files and folders
by moving and copying them, but also cleaning out the deadwood — remov-
ing files you no longer want or need.
To kill a file, select it and choose File➪Delete. Or, you can press the Delete
key on your keyboard to delete any selected files. Or, if you can see the
Recycle Bin icon on the desktop, drag the files with the mouse and drop them
right on the Recycle Bin icon. Phew! The file is gone.
 Windows may warn you about deleting a file. Are you really sure? You
probably are, so click Yes to delete the file. (Windows is just being
utterly cautious.)
 You can delete folders just like files, but keep in mind that you delete the
folder’s contents — which can be dozens of icons, files, folders, jewelry,
small children, widows, and refugees. Better be careful with that one.
274
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

 Never delete any file or folder unless you created it yourself.
 Programs aren’t deleted in Windows, they’re uninstalled. See Chapter 23.
Undeleting files (Files of the Undead!)
If you just deleted the file — and I mean just deleted it — you can choose the
Edit➪Undo command (Ctrl+Z). That gets it back.
If Edit➪Undo doesn’t do it, or undo it (or whatever), take these steps:
1. Open the Recycle Bin on the desktop.
2. Select the file you want recovered.
3. Choose File➪Restore from the menu.
The file is magically removed from Recycle Bin limbo and restored
afresh to the folder and disk from which it was so brutally seized.
4. Close the Recycle Bin window.
Windows has no definite time limit on how long you can restore files; they
can be available in the Recycle Bin for months or even years. Even so, don’t
let the convenience of the Recycle Bin lull you into a false sense of security.
Never delete a file unless you’re certain that you want it gone, gone, gone.
 Choose View➪Arrange Icons➪by Date Deleted from the Recycle Bin’s
menu to display files in the order they departed (by date). That way, it’s
cinchy to find any recently deceased files you may want back.
 Files deleted by pressing Shift+Delete on the keyboard are permanently
deleted. They aren’t stored in the Recycle Bin and cannot be recovered.
That’s why you should use only the Shift+Delete command to seriously
remove files you no longer want.
Renaming files
Windows lets you rename any file or folder at any time. You may want to do
this to give the folder a better, more descriptive name, or you could have any
number of reasons to give an icon a new name. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Click the icon once to select it.
2. Choose File➪Rename from the menu.
The file’s current name is highlighted or selected — just like selected
text in a word processor.
275
Chapter 22: File Control

3. Type a new name or edit the current name.
4. Press the Enter key to lock in the new name.
Note that all files must have a name. If you don’t give the file a name (you try
to leave it blank), Windows complains. Other than that, here are some file
renaming points to ponder:
 Before pressing the Enter key (refer to Step 4), you can press the Esc key
to undo the damage and return to the file’s original name.
 Windows doesn’t let you rename a file with the name of an existing file;
no two items in the same folder can share the same name.
 If you have hidden the filename extensions, it may appear that two files
share the same name. Note, however, that such files are of two different
types and have two different icons.
 You can undo the name change by pressing the Ctrl+Z key combination
or choosing Edit➪Undo from the menu. You must do it immediately after
the booboo occurs in order for it to work.
 The keyboard shortcut for renaming files is F2. I prefer using this key to
choosing the menu item because my hands need to be on the keyboard
to type the new filename anyway.
Windows lets you rename a group of icons all at once. It works the same as
renaming a single icon, though when the operation is completed, all the
selected icons have new names plus a number suffix. For example, you select
a group of icons and choose the File➪Rename command or press the F2 key.
Type Picture as the group filename. Each file in the group is then given the
name Picture (1), Picture (2), and so on, up to the last file in the group,
Picture (24), for example.
Finding Wayward Files
Losing track of your files in Windows is no big deal. Unlike losing your glasses
or car keys, Windows sports a nifty Search Companion. Lost files are found
almost instantly. Even the Amazing Kreskin couldn’t find things faster!
To find a file in Windows, use the Search Companion, which is part of any
Windows Explorer window. To use the Search Companion, abide by these
steps:
1. In any folder window, click the Search button.
Or, choose View➪Explorer Bar➪Search. The Search Companion appears
on the left side of the window.
276
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

2. Click to select the item titled All Files and Folders.
The other options sound good, but this choice gives you the most flexi-
bility, as shown in Figure 22-6.
3. Type all or part of the file’s name.
4. Type a word or phrase in the file.
Don’t bother filling in the Word or Phrase box if you’re searching for a
graphics file, an audio or MP3 file, a video file, or a program.
5. Select the folder to look in.
To search all your computer’s hard drives, choose Local Hard Drives
from the list.
To search only one hard drive, select it from the list.
To search a specific folder, such as the Windows or My Documents
folder, select it from the list.
The rest of the settings, hidden in Figure 22-6, are optional. You’re now
ready to search.
Figure 22-6:

Chapter 22: File Control

6. Click the Search button.
This action sends Windows off on a merry chase to locate the file you
have requested. One of two things happens when it’s done:
No dice: A message tells you that there are no results to display. Oh,
well. Try again: Click the Back button.
Eureka! Any files matching your specifications are listed on the right
side of the window.
The found files appear on a list. You can double-click a found file to open it.
Or, if you want to know which folder the file was hiding in, right-click the file’s
icon and choose Open Containing Folder from the pop-up menu.
Be sure to close the Search Results window when you’re done.
 If your keyboard has a Windows key, you can press Win+F, where the F
means Find. This action summons the Search Companion window.
 In any folder window, you can press Ctrl+E to display the Search
Companion.
 The book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.)
contains many more Search Companion options and variations for find-
ing just about any file based on its type, size, or date.

T
he PC hardware may be dumb, and the operating system may be in
charge, but to get any work done on your computer, you need software.
Specifically, you need those workhorse applications that transform your
whimsical musings into something substantial, by using the power of the
computer’s hefty I/O muscle to convert your keystrokes and mouse move-
ments into something wonderful and new — or stagnant and rotten, depend-
ing on whether you love your work.
I find the main problem with software to be the terminology. Just how many
words are there for a computer program? Software is the big term. Computer
program is technical, though more technical is executable. Then there are the
applications and the software suites. No matter what jargon, this chapter
covers the job of setting up and using those programs on your PC.
Software Installation Chores
Software is what makes your computer do the work. But the program itself
doesn’t magically jump from the mostly empty software box and into your
computer. It requires work on your behalf. This isn’t anything technical. In

fact, it’s so easy that few software boxes even bother to contain instructions.
When that’s the case, you can start reading here:
1. Open the software box.
You need a knife or scissors to remove the shrink wrap and potential
transparent seal over the box flap.
Try not to rip up the box. You want to keep it intact, either for long-term
storage or in case the store lets you return the software. Most stores
don’t. When they don’t, you can try reselling the software on eBay.
2. Savor the smell of the industrial plastic odor of the box’s insides.
3. Locate the installation disc or discs.
If you have more than one, note in which order they’re used; the discs
should be numbered, and you want to start with the first disc, which
should also be labeled INSTALL.
Sometimes, a DVD is included, which means that if your PC has a DVD
drive, you can use that single DVD, rather than multiple CDs, to install
the program.
In addition to the installation disc, you may have other discs, bonus pro-
grams, supplements, and libraries of clip art. You don’t need to install
everything, but you should find the Install disc.
4. Scour the box for printed information.
Specifically, you want to find a Read Me sheet or Getting Started booklet.
You may have a manual in the box. It’s a joke. Gone are the days when
computer software came with manuals. The manual is now “on the disk,”
in the form of a help file, which isn’t very helpful.
If installation instructions are in the box, follow them.
5. Insert the installation disc into the drive.
6. Start the installation program.
If you’re lucky, the installation program runs automatically when you
insert the CD into the CD-ROM drive.
If the installation program doesn’t start automatically, you need to run it
yourself. You can do this by opening the Add/Remove Programs icon in
the Control Panel. Use the dialog box that’s displayed to help you hunt
down your program.
7. Obey the instructions on the screen.
Read the information carefully; sometimes, they slip something impor-
tant in there. My friend Jerry (his real name) just kept clicking the Next
button rather than reading the screen. He missed an important notice
saying that an older version of the program would be erased. Uh-oh!
Poor Jerry never got his old program back.

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

8. Choose various options.
The software asks for your name and company name, and maybe for a
serial number. Type all that stuff in.
Don’t freak if the program already knows who you are. Windows is kinda
clairvoyant in that respect.
When you’re asked to make a decision, the option that’s already selected
(the default) is typically the best option. Only if you know what’s going
on and truly care about it should you change anything.
You can find the serial number inside the manual, on the CD-ROM case,
on the first disc, or on a separate card you probably threw away even
though I told you to keep everything in its original box. Don’t lose that
number! I usually write the serial number down inside the manual or on
the software box itself.
9. Files are copied.
Eventually, the installation program copies the files from the installation
disc to your hard drive for full-time residence.
If asked, replace one CD with another. This process may go on for some
time.
10. It’s done.
The installation program ends. The computer may reset at this point.
That’s required sometimes when you’re installing special programs that
Windows needs to know about. (Windows is pretty dumb after it starts.)
Start using the program!
Granted, the preceding steps are vague and general. Hopefully, your new soft-
ware comes with more specific instructions. Refer to the sidebars nearby for
important information on some commonly asked installation questions.
281
Chapter 23: Software, Programs, Applications
How do I quit all other programs?
Many installation programs ask you to “quit all
other programs” before you proceed with
installing the new software. The reason is that
installation is monitored to make uninstalling
easier. Having other programs run “in the back-
ground” can disturb this process. Also, because
some programs require the computer to be reset
after installation, if you haven’t yet saved your
data, you’re out of luck.
To make sure that no other programs are run-
ning, press the Alt+Tab key. If Windows switches
you to another program or window, close it. Keep
pressing Alt+Tab until the only program you see
is the installation program. That way, you’re
assured that all other running programs have
closed. (And there’s no need to close any back-
ground applications or other processes.)

You must have administrator privileges to install new software on your com-
puter. This is fine; most users set themselves up as administrators anyway.
Also, if more than one person uses your computer, be sure that you install
the software for everyone to use.
Running a Program
After the software gets into your PC, the next thing you want to do is run that
program. As with other things in Windows, there are many different, strange,
and potentially useful ways to run your programs in Windows. This section
describes some of the more popular methods.
Finding a program on the Start menu
All new software you install should set itself up on the Start button’s menu,
on the All Programs submenu. In fact, if the software did things properly,
Windows displays a pop-up bubble on the Start button that says “New soft-
ware installed” (or something similar) and highlights the new program’s 
location.
To run your program, obey these steps:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose All Programs to pop up the All Programs menu.
282
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 
How do I disable my antivirus software?
The better antivirus programs constantly moni-
tor your computer to check for new viruses. So,
whenever you install new software, the
antivirus software may stand up and say “What
a minute!” and prevent the installation. The only
way around this problem is to temporarily dis-
able the antivirus software.
The easiest way to disable antivirus software is
locate the antivirus program’s tiny icon on the
system tray. Right-click that icon and choose the
Disable command from the pop-up menu. After
doing so, you may proceed with installation.
Remember, however, to reenable the antivirus
software after installing the new program. One
way to do that is to restart Windows, which most
new programs require after installation anyway.

3. Click your program’s icon on the menu.
This step runs the program; the Start menu thing goes away, and your
program’s window appears on the screen.
4. If the program cannot be found, locate the program’s submenu and
then go back to Step 3.
Some programs may be buried on submenus and even more submenus.
It all depends on how the All Programs menu is organized.
Yeah, the All Programs menu can be a mess! You can organize that menu, but
that’s really the topic of another book.
Be careful when you use the mouse to navigate through the various sub-
menus; they can get “slippery.”
It’s possible to accidentally move a submenu or program icon from the All
Programs menu. When this happens, immediately press Ctrl+Z on the key-
board. That’s the Undo command’s keyboard shortcut, and it should restore
whatever damage you have done.
The program itself isn’t installed on the All Programs menu. What you see
there is merely a shortcut icon, or tiny copy of the program. The program
itself is most likely located in its own subfolder in the Program Files folder 
on drive C. (Refer to Chapter 22 for more information on shortcut files.)
Accessing recent programs
Every time you run a program in Windows, it appears on the Start button’s
menu, on the left side, in an area I cleverly refer to as the Recently Used
Programs list. Figure 23-1 shows you where the list is, and keep in mind that
this is my kids’ computer, which explains why the list is full of games.
Choose any program on the list to immediately run it again — no wading
through the All Programs menu required! Note that programs fall off that list
as you run new programs.
To set the number of recently run programs appearing on the Start menu,
follow these steps:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose the Properties command from the pop-up surprise menu.
The Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box whisks into existence.
283
Chapter 23: Software, Programs, Applications

3. Click the Customize button.
I’m assuming that you have selected the Start menu option, not the
Classic Start menu, which is used only by people with bad body odor
problems.
The Customize Start Menu dialog box appears.
4. Enter the number of recently used programs to appear on the list (in
the middle of the dialog box).
Setting the number to zero eliminates the list.
5. Click OK, and then click OK again to close the other dialog box.
Putting your program in the pin-on area
If you prefer to have your program appear right on the Start menu, where it’s
most handy, consider adding the program to the pin-on area, as shown in
Figure 23-1. Programs “pinned” to the Start button’s menu stay there come
hell or high water or so-called computer expert nephews visiting from Ohio.

284
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

To add any program to the pin-on area, right-click the program’s icon and
choose the Pin to Start Menu command from the pop-up menu.
You can click any program icon, even a program on the Recently Used
Programs List or a program icon found on the All Programs menu.
Remember: Right-click.
Creating a desktop shortcut icon
When a program installs itself on your computer, it sets up a command or
even a submenu full of commands on the Start button’s All Programs menu.
The program may also create a shortcut icon on the desktop, which allows
you even faster access to the program. Well, it allows access any time you 
see the desktop.
If you enjoy having shortcut icons on the desktop, you can add any program
(or folder or file) to the desktop as a shortcut. Here’s how:
1. Locate the file you want to place on the desktop.
It can be a shortcut icon or the original file, program, or folder. It can
even be a program on the All Programs menu.
2. Right-click the file’s icon to display the pop-up shortcut menu.
3. Choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut).
The shortcut file is created, and its icon appears on the desktop.
Putting an icon on the Quick Launch bar
Another handy place to put frequently used programs is on the Quick Launch
bar, which is where the Quick Launch bar gets its name. If it were the Quick
Lunch bar, you would put sandwiches down there, not program icons.
The easiest way to put a program icon on the Quick Launch bar is to drag the
program’s shortcut icon from the desktop and onto the Quick Launch bar.
Refer to the preceding subsection for information on creating a desktop
shortcut icon.
Uninstalling Software
To remove any newly installed program, you use an uninstall program. This
program isn’t a feature of Windows. Each software program comes with its
own uninstall feature. Or, at least you hope it does.
285
Chapter 23: Software, Programs, Applications

Uninstall programs are usually on the Start button’s All Programs menu, right
by the icon used to start the program. For example, in Figure 23-2, you see a
trio of icons installed on a submenu when I added the IconCool Editor pro-
gram to my PC. The command to uninstall that program is called, remarkably,
Uninstall. This type of setup is common for most programs.
If your software lacks an obvious uninstall program, you can attempt to use
Windows to rid yourself of it: Open the Control Panel’s Add or Remove
Programs icon to witness for yourself the glory that is the Add or Remove
Programs Properties dialog box, proudly depicted in Figure 23-3.
The list of programs that Windows knows about and can uninstall is listed in
the dialog box (refer to Figure 23-3). Click one of those programs, the one you
want to uninstall, and then click the Change/Remove button. Continue read-
ing instructions on the screen to uninstall the program.
 Do not attempt to uninstall any software by deleting it from your hard
drive. You should never delete any file you did not create yourself. (You
can, however, delete any shortcuts you create.)

Remove
Programs
dialog box.

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

 Some stubborn programs don’t fully remove themselves. If you have
tried everything, feel free to remove the program by deleting its icon or
folder. Do not, however, delete any program or file installed in the
Windows folder or any of its subfolders.
Updating Your Software
After a novel is written, it’s finished. Subsequent reprints correct a few mis-
spellings, but that’s about it. Software, on the other hand, is never finished.
It’s too easy to change. Most software packages are updated about once
every year or two, and sometimes more often.
The reason that software is updated used to be to fix problems or to intro-
duce new features. But, honestly, the main reason for new versions of pro-
grams appearing now is to make more money for the software developers.
Upgrading means that everyone who owns the software may buy a new 
version and generate revenue for the company. Yep, it’s greed.
My advice: Order the update only if it has features or makes modifications
you desperately need, or if the update is for security reasons. Otherwise, if
the current version is doing the job, don’t bother.
 Consider each upgrade offer on its individual merits: Will you ever use
the new features? Do you need a word processor that can print upside-
down headlines and bar charts that show your word count? Can you
really get any mileage out of the intranet version when you’re a sole user
sitting at home?
 Here’s something else to keep in mind: If you’re still using Doodle
Writer 4.2 and everybody else is using DoodleWriter 6.1, you may have
difficulty exchanging documents. After a while, newer versions of pro-
grams become incompatible with their older models. If so, you need to
upgrade.
 In an office setting, everybody should be using the same software ver-
sion. (Everybody doesn’t have to be using the latest version, just the
same version.)
What about upgrading Windows?
Upgrading Windows is a big deal. Why? Because everything else in your com-
puter relies on Windows. Therefore, it’s a major change, and something to
think long and hard about.
287
Chapter 23: Software, Programs, Applications

Often, the newer version of Windows has many more features than the older
version. Do you need those features? If not, don’t bother with the update.
After a time, you may notice newer software packages coming to roost on the
newest version of Windows. The new stuff is better than your current stuff,
so you need to upgrade if you want to take advantage of it.
Where does this leave you? Don’t bother updating Windows! Just wait until you
buy a new computer, and that PC will have the newest version of Windows,
all preinstalled and set up nicely.
What about patching or 
updating Windows?
Occasionally, Microsoft comes out with patches, security updates, or other
fixes to Windows. It makes these fixes available automatically over the
Internet, or you may opt to manually select an update by using the Windows
Update program.
At one time, I was against applying the Windows updates, mostly because the
updates were risky and could cause your PC to stop working. Lately, how-
ever, Microsoft has gotten better about its updates. I now recommend apply-
ing all updates to Windows whenever they come out. You can configure
Windows XP to do this automatically:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Automatic Updates icon.
3. Choose the Automatic option in the Automatic Updates dialog box.
4. Click OK and, optionally, close the Control Panel window.
Note that if your PC is on a broadband modem connection, you can have the
updates downloaded any time of the day, as long as the PC is turned on all
the time. Otherwise, you want to have the updates happen whenever your PC
is connected to the Internet.
You can also manually update by running the Windows Update program:
Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪Windows Update. This com-
mand connects you to the Internet, where you can choose which updates you
want to apply to your PC.

 Copying files to a CD-R
 Burning a CD-R disc
 Labeling CD-R discs
 Modifying a CD-R data disc

 Using Windows Media Player to collect and manage music
 Burning a music CD
W
hen the CD drive first became an option on the PC, one question was
universal: “How can I write to the thing? I want to make my own CDs!”
At the time, computer users were familiar with floppy disks — removable and
writable media. But CDs, they said, could be written to only by huge, com-
plex, and expensive machines. In fact, there were only three such machines
on the entire planet. Writing to a CD? Ha! It was a pipe dream.
My, how things have changed!
Today, any teenager with a properly equipped computer can produce more
CDs in a day than the local music store sells in a week. Computers can easily
create CDs, for storing either data or music. It’s easy. This chapter tells you
how it’s done.
Making Your Own Data CD
Yes, you can make a CD, which doesn’t involve crystals, nuclear power, or 
an insane laboratory assistant named Craig. You need three only things:
 A CD-R disc specifically designed for storing computer data
 A CD drive capable of writing to a CD-R disc
 Software to make it all happen

The CD-R discs, you have to buy. The CD drive must come with your com-
puter, though external CD-R drives are plentiful and cheap. The software also
comes with Windows, though better software exists on the Internet or up on
the shelf at the Software-O-Rama.
Got all that stuff? You’re ready to burn!
 CD-R discs are cheap. Buy ’em by the hundreds.
 Some CD-R discs are better than others. Although a pal of mine says that
any old CD-R will do, I stick with the brands I know and use those special
high-speed disks. My data is important to me, so I don’t mind paying
extra.
 CD-R drives are generally also capable of using CD-RW discs. They’re
called CD-R/RW drives.
 For more information on creating CD-RW discs, see the section “A few
words about CD-RW,” later in this chapter.
Mounting the CD-R
Just as floppy disks must be formatted, roads must be paved, and babies
must be properly swaddled in diapers, CD-R discs must be prepared for use.
Windows handles this task automatically. It’s known as mounting the disc.
Here’s the 411:
1. Put a blank CD-R disc into the drive.
Windows XP is smart enough to recognize the disc and asks you what to
do with it, as shown in Figure 24-1.
290
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 
What to put on the CD-R?
The burning burning question is “What kind of
data should you put on a CD-R?” Obviously, you
don’t want to use a CD-R like a removable hard
drive. That’s because the disc can be used only
once. When it’s full, it’s done! It cannot be erased.
Therefore, I recommend using CD-R data discs
for archiving.
For example, when I’m done writing a book, I
archive all the text documents, figures, pictures,
— even the contract — on a CD-R disc. Though
the files may not equal the disc’s full 600MB
capacity, that’s fine; it’s an archive. With the files
safely saved on the CD-R, I can delete them
from my hard drive and make that space avail-
able for something else. And, if I ever need the
files again, they’re handy on the archive CD.
I also use CD-Rs to send files in the mail that are
too big to send by e-mail. (How big? Anything
larger than 10MB is too big for e-mail.)

2. Select the option Open Writable CD Folder Using Windows Explorer.
3. Click OK.
Windows mounts the CD-R.
You can now use the CD-R just as you can use the hard disk.
 Your computer may automatically recognize the CD-R and mount it with-
out interrupting you. Groovy.
 If the CD-R drive doesn’t recognize the disc, the disc could be defective.
Fetch another.
 If you’re running other CD-R burning software, it takes over and does I-
don’t-know-what, but probably something similar to what Windows XP
does.
 If you’re using software other than Windows, ensure that you create a
standard CD, one that can be read by any PC.
 Some CD-R discs can hold up to 700MB of data or 80 minutes of music. It
usually says on the CD-R case, so look when you buy.
Copying files to the CD-R
After mounting the CD-R, you can work with it just like you work with the
hard drive: Copy files to the CD-R drive’s window. Create folders, even sub-
folders. Rename and manage files as you normally would.
Figure 24-1:
A blank 
CD-R is
detected.
291
Chapter 24: Making Your Own CDs

The trick here is that nothing is written to the CD-R until you direct Windows
to burn information to the disc. So, technically (and rather sneakily), you’re
merely messing with an image of what the CD-R will eventually look like; noth-
ing is burned to the disc yet.
 Avoid saving files directly to the CD-R. Instead, save the file first to the
hard drive, preferably in the proper folder. After that, you can save a
copy of the file to the CD-R. Only after the CD-R has been successfully
written should you consider deleting the original files on the hard drive,
if at all.
 The fewer times you write to the CD-R disc, the more data the disc can
hold. Writing to the disc a little bit at a time consumes extra space
because of the overhead required to keep track of the file information.
 Note that Windows updates its File➪Send To submenu to include the
CD-R drive, which allows for the quick right-click copying of files and
folders.
Burning the CD-R
As files are prepared for the CD-R disc, Windows pops up a message on the
system tray, as shown in Figure 24-2. This is your reminder that files are wait-
ing to be burned to the CD-R.
292
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 
Making sure that the CD-R drive 
is up to writing a CD-R disc
If you’re having trouble mounting a CD-R, check
to ensure that Windows is set up to properly use
the CD-R drive for disc recording. Heed these
steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click the CD-R drive icon in the My
Computer window.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4. In the CD drive’s Properties dialog box,
click the Recording tab.
If you see no Recording tab, either you don’t
have a CD-R drive or it may be defective.
Return it to your dealer. Note that some
DVD/CD-RW drives may not have the
Recording tab but can still record.
5. Put a check mark by the option Enable CD
Recording on This Drive.
6. Click the OK button.
7. Close the My Computer window.

By clicking in the bubble (refer to Figure 24-2), you can see the CD-R drive’s
window. Or, you can open the CD-R drive’s icon in the My Computer window.
The CD-R drive’s window displays a list of icons prepped for burning. Each
icon is flagged with a straight-to-hell arrow, as shown in the margin.
To burn the files-in-waiting to the CD-R disc, choose File➪Write These Files to
CD. This action starts the CD Writing Wizard.
Work through the wizard and answer the questions as best you can; fear 
not — nothing is that difficult. In fact, most of your time is spent waiting 
for the files to burn, so get a cup of coffee or catch up on your e-mail.
When the files have all been burned, the disc is automatically ejected from the
drive. It’s now ready to use, and readable on any PC, just like any other CD.
 The speed at which the information is written to the CD-R is based on
the drive’s (hardware) speed rating. The first value in the rating is the
speed at which data is written to disc.
 Note that one available option when the CD Writing Wizard is done
allows you to create another CD with the same information on it. This
feature is handy for making duplicates of your CD backups.
Labeling the CD-R (or not)
I highly recommend labeling all removable disks, even digital media cards.
Even if you name things only A or B, that’s fine because it helps you keep
track of things.
Label your CD-R after it’s been written to. That way, you don’t waste time
labeling what could potentially be a bad disc (one that you would throw
away). I use a Sharpie to write on the disc. Write on the label side; the other
side is the one containing your important data. You don’t want to write on
that.
Figure 24-2:
Files are
awaiting the
flames.
293
Chapter 24: Making Your Own CDs

Do not use a label on your CD-R. Only if the label specifically says that it’s
chemically safe for a CD-R should you use it. Otherwise, the chemicals in the
standard type of sticky label may damage the disk and render the information
that’s written to it unreadable after only a few months.
Messing with files on a burnt CD-R
Some CD-burning software may finish the task after the disc is ejected. But,
with Windows, you can continue to burn files to a CD-R until it’s absolutely
full. (In other words, no “final burn” occurs, as it does with some CD-writing
software.)
For example, if you want to add more files to the CD-R, you can do so — if the
disc has room. The files appear in the CD-R’s window; existing files on the CD-
R appear as normal, and the files waiting to be burned appear with the little
arrow on them, as shown in Figure 24-3.
Note the Details listing in the lower-left corner of the CD-R disc’s window. It
tells you how much space is still available (Free Space) on the disc. In
Figure 24-3, it shows 237MB — plenty of room!
You can also manipulate the files already on the CD. You can rename and
even delete files. Note, however, that messing with those files consumes 
disc space.
Figure 24-3:
Files on the
CD and
waiting to
be burned.
294
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Unlike with a regular disk drive, information is never really erased from a 
CD-R. So, when you rename a file, Windows simply covers up the old name
and creates a new one — which uses disc space. Similarly, when you delete 
a file from a CD-R, the space used by the file isn’t recovered. Keep this in
mind if you change anything already burned to the disc.
A few words about CD-RW
CD-RW discs work just like CD-R data discs. All the information in the previ-
ous sections applies to CD-RW discs just as it applies to CD-Rs. The main dif-
ference is the addition of a command used to reformat the CD-RW disc and
start over.
To reformat the CD-RW, open its window (from the My Computer window),
and then choose File➪Erase This CD-RW. This command starts the CD
Writing Wizard, which you work through, and eventually it wipes the disc
clean.
After reformatting the CD-RW disc, you can use it over again — which is the
advantage of the CD-RW over the CD-R (which cannot be reformatted).
 Most CD-R drives double as CD-RW drives.
 CD-RW discs are different from CD-R discs. It says CD-RW on the label,
and the disc is more expensive, which is most obvious when you try to
taste this disc.
 CD-RW discs may not be readable in all CD drives. If you want to create a
CD with the widest possible use, burn a CD-R rather than a CD-RW disc.
 Erasing, renaming, or moving a file after it has been burned to a CD-RW
disc wastes disc space, just as doing so on a CD-R disc wastes space. If
possible, try to do your file manipulations before you burn the files to
the disc.
 It’s often said that CD-RW discs are best used for backing up data
because they can be reused over and over. However, on a disc-per-disc
basis, it’s cheaper to use CD-R discs instead.
 The speed at which the drive rewrites the CD-RW disc is the middle
number in the drive speed rating-thing.
Disposing of a CD or CD-R
Sure, you can just toss a CD or CD-R into the trash. That’s okay — in most
places. Some communities classify a CD as hazardous, and it must be prop-
erly disposed of or sent off for recycling.
295
Chapter 24: Making Your Own CDs

If you don’t want anyone else to read the CD-R, you probably don’t want to
throw it away intact. The best solution is to destroy the CD-R by getting a
paper shredder that can also handle CDs.
Some folks say that you can effectively erase a CD-R by putting it in a
microwave oven for a few seconds. I don’t know whether I trust or recom-
mend that method. And, don’t burn a CD-R; the fumes are toxic.
Burning a Music CD
Creating the music CD involves three steps:
1. Collect the music or sound files from their sources.
2. Manage the files inside the media software.
3. Write selected files to a music CD.
The first step is to use your media software to collect the music you want to
burn to a CD. The music can be downloaded from the Internet, copied from
an existing CD, or entered using the PC’s sound input from any audio device.
The music files are saved on disc and managed by your media software.
Next, you create playlists, or collections of the songs you have stored on disk.
For example, you can collect a smattering of road tunes and create a playlist
of those songs — like building your own album on your computer.
296
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 
What about DVD-R/RW and the 
zillion other DVD formats?
Sadly, Windows doesn’t support burning DVDs
as it does burning CDs. The reason is most likely
that there are about half a dozen recordable
DVD standards, and Microsoft would rather sit
out the battle to see who wins. Even so, most
PCs that come with recordable DVD drives also
come with special software that lets you make
your own DVDs.
There are now two popular recordable DVD
standards: DVD-R and DVD+R, known commonly
as minus and plus standards. There are also sim-
ilar DVD-RW and DVD+RW standards. Aside
from minor technical differences, you really need
to know only that DVD-R is more compatible with
home movie DVD players, yet the DVD+R format
is faster.
Future editions of this book will document how
to create your own DVDs as this technology
matures and is fully supported by Windows.

Finally, you simply copy one of your playlists to the CD-R disc. The media
software then converts the music files and burns the CD-R.
This section details these steps in Windows Media Player. Note that your 
version of Media Player may have subtly different options than those I have
outlined.
 I’m particularly fond of the MUSICMATCH Jukebox program as a great
alternative to Windows Media Player. Look it up on the Web, at www.
musicmatch.com.
 You use specific CD-R discs for recording music, which are often cheaper
than the computer data CD-Rs. If you plan to create music only, consider
buying some of these cheaper discs.
 It’s assumed that you own whatever music it is that you’re copying and
that you’re using the copies for only your personal use. Making a copy 
of a commercial CD or copyrighted music and distributing it without
paying for it is theft.
Collecting tunes
Copying music from a CD into the computer is cinchy to do in Windows
Media Player. Follow these steps:
1. Insert a music CD into your CD-ROM drive.
This step automatically runs Windows Media Player. If not, from the
Start panel, choose Programs➪Windows Media Player.
In a few moments, information about the CD appears in the Media Player
window. (The Internet may even be called up; this isn’t necessary, so
cancel the operation. Be warned, though, that it’s a persistent calling, so
consider giving in and connecting anyway.)
2. Click the Copy from CD button.
It’s on the left edge of the Media Player window, as shown in Figure 24-4.
3. Click to select the tracks you want to copy from the CD.
4. Click the Copy Music button.
It’s in the upper part of the Media Player window, just above the
Composer column. (It appears as Stop Copy in Figure 24-4.)
Note that it takes a little time to copy over the tracks to the hard drive. That’s
because the CD-ROM can read from disc many more times faster than it plays
the music — that’s the last X (multiple) in a CD-ROM drive’s speed rating.
297
Chapter 24: Making Your Own CDs

After the songs are copied, they appear in the Media Library. Click the Media
Library button. Then, in the Media Library tree structure, you find the album
and its copied tracks listed under Audio\Album. Click to select the album
title, and you find the copied tracks on the right side of the window.
Creating a playlist
Before you can burn the music CD, you must create a playlist in Windows
Media Player. The playlist is a collection of tunes, which doesn’t necessarily
have to be copied to a CD. For example, if you want, you can create a playlist
of all your favorite afternoon songs or driving tunes or cleaning-the-house
music. A playlist is merely a collection of songs that Media Player can play.
For creating a music CD, however, you probably want to assemble several
dozen songs specific to the kind of CD you want to burn. For example, I can
create my list of show tune highlights so that I can sing in the car and pre-
tend that I’m on Broadway.
To create a playlist in Windows Media Player, follow these simple sample
steps:
1. Click the Media Library button on the left edge of the Media Player
window.
2. Click the New Playlist button.
Figure 24-4:
A file is

a CD to the

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

3. Type a descriptive name for the playlist.
4. Click OK.
The new playlist is placed in the My Playlists part of the Media Library
tree, on the left side of the Media Player window.
The next step is to add music tracks to the playlist. The music tracks
can be found under the Audio branch of the Media Library tree. They’re
in the All Audio, Album, Artist and Genre branches.
5. Click an audio source in the Media Library tree.
For example, I clicked one of my show tunes albums. The list of songs I
copied from that CD appears on the right side of the Media Player
window.
6. Click to select a song, or Ctrl+click to select several songs.
7. Click the Add to Playlist button.
8. Choose your playlist from the drop-down menu.
If it doesn’t appear, choose the Additional Playlist command; choose
your playlist in the dialog box and click the OK button.
9. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 to collect the songs you want in your
playlist.
10. Click to highlight your playlist in the Media Library tree.
On the right side of the Media Player window, you find all the songs you
copied into that playlist.
After the playlist is created, listen to the songs. Confirm that they’re what you
want.
To remove a song from the playlist, click to highlight the song and then click
the Delete Media button; choose Delete from Playlist from the Delete Media
button’s menu.

Chapter 24: Making Your Own CDs
How an MP3 player fits into the picture
Beyond making your own CDs, it may be time to
invest in a portable digital music player, also
known as an MP3 player. (The term iPod is also
used, though iPod refers specifically to the
portable music player made by Apple Computer.)
The MP3 player may have come with its own soft-
ware, or it may work directly with Windows
Media Player. Either way, the idea is to connect
the player to the computer and then use the
music software to update the portable player.
This works just like creating a musical CD, though
the portable media player contains lots of storage
for thousands and thousands of songs.

The songs play and are recorded to CD in the order they appear on the
playlist. To rearrange the songs, use the up- or down-arrow buttons just
above the list.
A playlist can contain many more songs than you eventually end up copying
to CD; the CD need not contain all the songs on the playlist.
Burning a music CD
Burning a music CD is a snap after you have created a playlist in Media
Player. Here are the steps to take to burn your music CD:
1. Insert the CD-R into the drive.
If Windows attempts to open it or displays the “What the heck do I do
now?” dialog box, just cancel out of the operation.
2. Click the Copy to CD or Device button on the left edge of the Media
Player window.
3. Ensure that you have your playlist selected on the left side of the
window.
In Figure 24-5, it’s the PCs for Dummies Sample Playlist, though my
editor tells me that the For should be capitalized. Like, whatever.
Figure 24-5:
A playlist 
is being
prepared to

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

4. Ensure that each title you want to copy has a check mark by its name.
If you don’t want to copy a specific track, remove the check mark.
Remember that you don’t have to copy them all.
Keep an eye on the amount of time used by the songs you have selected
to copy. Media Player lets you know if you have too many files to copy
over. When that happens, you must unselect some songs to make room
for others.
5. Ensure that the CD-R drive is chosen on the right side of the window.
It says CD Drive (G:) in Figure 24-5.
6. Click the Copy Music button.
It’s in the upper-right corner of the Media Player window.
After clicking the Copy Music button, Windows dutifully copies the
tracks you have selected to the CD-R disc. First, the tracks are converted
into the proper CD format one at a time. Then, the files are copied over
to the CD-R.
When the operation is complete, the disc is ejected and is ready to be played
in any CD player. The disc’s name is the same as the playlist you copied over.
 Some older CD players may not be able to read the CD-R music disc.
 The speed at which you can write to the CD-R drive is the writing speed.
That would be the first number in the drive’s speed rating. So, if you
have a 40X–16X–48X drive, it creates a 40-minute music CD in only 1
minute.
 Unlike with data CD-Rs, you cannot add more music to a CD-R after it has
been burned once.
 Not all sound files can be copied to an audio CD. MIDI files, for example,
must be converted into WAV files to be recorded to a CD-ROM. Special
software is required in order to make this conversion. Also, some WAV
files may be recorded in a low-quality format that makes them incompat-
ible with CD audio. Again, the files must be converted by using special
software.

t’s information! It’s communications! It’s entertainment! It’s shopping! It’s
research! It’s the future! It’s a colossal waste of time! Yes, it’s software too!
It’s the Internet, and it’s practically indescribable. What began as a method
for scientists and researchers to exchange information from remote locations
has grown into a way for teenagers to type text messages at each other
though they live next door. Truly, the Internet is one of the most remarkable
things humans ever developed.
This chapter provides an introduction to the one computer concept that
most likely doesn’t need an introduction: the Internet. Even if you think that
you already know everything, consider giving this chapter a skim. The
Internet is ever changing, and there’s always a chance that you may learn
something new.
What Is the Internet?
The Internet is composed of hundreds of thousands of computers all over the
world. The computers send information. They receive information. And, most
important, they store information. That’s the Internet.

Some common misconceptions 
about the Internet
The Internet is a piece of software or program you buy. Although you use
software to access the Internet and you need software to send or retrieve
information from the Internet, the Internet itself isn’t a software program.
The Internet is a single computer. The Internet consists of all the computers
connected to the Internet. Whenever your computer is “on” the Internet, it’s
part of the Internet.
Bill Gates, AOL, the government, or something or someone else owns the
Internet. The Internet began as a military project run by the government.
Large corporations and communications companies now supply most of the
resources for the Internet. No lone person can own the Internet, just as no
lone person can own the oceans.
The Internet can be turned off. Although your connection to the Internet
may “go down” and parts of the Internet occasionally fail, because of its
decentralized organization the Internet can never be turned off or cease to
exist. After all, the military originally designed the Internet to survive a
nuclear war. It’s not going down.
Getting information from the Internet
The information on the Internet is next to useless unless you can access it.
So, the whole idea behind getting on the Internet is to access all that informa-
tion and take advantage of the Internet’s communications abilities.
To use the Internet, you must connect your computer to some other com-
puter already on the Internet. That’s usually done through an ISP, or Internet
Service Provider, which is covered later in this chapter. But, just connect-
ing to the Internet doesn’t allow you to access any information. For that, 
you need specific Internet software, such as a Web browser. You can also
exchange information via e-mail, which people use more than they use 
the Web.
 Chapter 26 is about the World Wide Web and using a Web browser.
 Chapter 27 covers e-mail.
304
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

How to Access the Internet
Getting on the Internet is no ordeal. Yet, like many rites of initiation, it takes
some time and organization. The good news is that it’s tough only the first
time. After that, all this stuff is a snap. The bad news is, of course, that it is
tough the first time.
Five things you need in order 
to get on the Internet
You need five things to access the Internet, four of which you probably have
and one of which you have to go out and get:
 A computer
 A modem
Rare is the PC without a modem. If yours is one of the rare ones, mull
over your modem options, as covered in Chapter 13.
 Internet software
Windows comes with nearly all the software you need.
 Money
This item is perhaps the toughest thing to come by. Access to the
Internet costs money: You subscribe to it, just like with cable TV. Expect
to pay anywhere from $5 to more than $100 a month to get on the
Internet, depending on the type of service and various options you need.
The average cost is less than $20 a month.
 An Internet Service Provider, or ISP
This item is the thing you need to go out and get. Just as the cable com-
pany provides you with cable TV, an ISP is the outfit that provides you
with Internet access. Obtaining an ISP is a big deal, so it’s covered in the
next subsection.
In some situations, you may not need any of these things. For example, if you
work for a large company, it may already give you Internet access through the
network at your office. Ditto for universities and some government installations.
And, you can always find free Internet access at a community library near you.
305
Chapter 25: Your Basic Internet Introduction

 Though I hate using acronyms, ISP is becoming popular enough that I
feel I must. Not only is it easier to type, but many people also now say
“ISP” and don’t even know that it stands for Internet Service Provider.
 Though no one owns the Internet, an ISP is necessary in order to pro-
vide access to it. Sure, they could give away access, but that makes for a
bad business plan.
 You can find ISPs by looking in the Yellow Pages, under Internet. I recom-
mend using a local ISP because the tech support for those national ISPs
tends to be iffy at best.
 The S in ISP stands for service. You pay them a fee, and they provide you
with Internet access and service. That means technical support: some-
one you can phone for help, classes, software — you name it. The more
support, the better the ISP.
 Though the Internet isn’t a program, you need special software in order
to access the Internet and to send or retrieve information.
Configuring Windows for the Internet
Setting up your PC to access the Internet isn’t all that hard, if you have these
three things:
 A silver bowl
 A ceremonial knife — preferably, bejeweled
 An unblemished goat
No. Wait. You needed those things in the old days. Now, all you need is some
information from your ISP, and the New Connection Wizard does the rest.
Odds are good that if you chose a decent ISP, someone there can provide you
with a Getting Started booklet or CD that has all the information you need to
set up Windows for the Internet. That’s your first, best option. Otherwise,
you need the following specific information from your ISP:
 For a dial-up modem, the phone number to call
 For a broadband modem, the modem’s IP address, the DNS address, and
possibly a gateway address
 Your ISP’s domain name — the blorf.com or yaddi.org thing
 Your Internet login ID and password
 Your Internet e-mail name, address, and password (if it’s different from
your login ID and password)
 The name of your ISP’s e-mail server, which involves the acronyms POP3
or SMTP.
306
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

The information listed here is necessary to run the New Connection Wizard in
Windows. Heck, there may even be more information. Keep it for future use!
To run the New Connection Wizard, heed these steps:
1. From the Start button’s menu, choose All Programs➪Accessories➪
Communications➪New Connection Wizard.
2. Read. Obey. Answer the wizard’s questions by using the information
provided by your ISP.
3. Click the Next button to continue working through the wizard.
4. Click the Finish button when you’re done.
After the wizard completes its interrogation and you click the Finish button,
your Internet connection information is saved as an icon in the Network Con-
nections folder (as shown in the margin). It means that you’re ready to go.
 Refer to Chapter 18 for more information about the Network
Connections folder, networking, and the Internet.
 You need to run the New Connection Wizard only once.
 I lied: If you change or add ISPs or switch from a dial-up to broadband
connection, you need to run the New Connection Wizard again.
 Never toss out the booklet or sheet of information your ISP gives you!
You need those numbers.
 Your Internet login ID and password are different from the user ID and
password you use to get into Windows. You need a different ID and pass-
word for each system you access.
 111,111,111 × 111,111,111 = 12,345,678,987,654,321.
Connecting to the Internet
Connecting to the Internet is cinchy: Simply run any Internet program on
your computer. Windows is smart enough to connect automatically. If you
have a broadband connection, Windows merely starts using that connection.
Otherwise, Windows directs the modem to dial into the ISP and make the
connection manually.
Hello, Internet
Here’s how you connect to the Internet most of the time:
307
Chapter 25: Your Basic Internet Introduction

1. Start your Web browser.
The Web browser software that comes with Windows is Internet Explorer.
Double-click the Internet Explorer icon on your desktop or choose All
Programs➪Internet Explorer from the Start button’s menu.
For a broadband or always-on connection, such as through a local-area
network, ta-da! You’re on the Internet. That’s it. That’s all you need to
do. As they say at the end of a French movie, Fin!
For dial-up modems, the madness continues:
2. Fill in the connection dialog box (if it appears).
If you see a Connect dialog box, as shown in Figure 25-1, fill it in. Use the
information provided by your ISP, though most of the information may
already be there. Click the Dial button to connect.
3. Wait while the modem dials.
Doh-dee-doh.
4. You’re connected!
When a dial-up connection is established, a new, itty-bitty icon appears on
the system tray, looking like the graphic shown in the margin. That’s your
Connected to Whatever teensy-weensy icon indicator telling you that you’re
online with the Internet and ready to run your Internet software.
Figure 25-1:
Dialing in to

308
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

 For several reasons, you may always have to manually enter your pass-
word. The first is that you’re using a laptop, which doesn’t save your
Internet password, for security reasons. The second is that you didn’t
properly log in to Windows with a password-protected account. The
third is that, for some reason, Windows forgets your password and
forces you to reenter it (perhaps for security reasons).
 For other Internet Connection problems, woes, and worries, refer to my
book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.),
available only in bookstores with good-looking employees worldwide.
Not connecting to the Internet
You don’t always have to connect to the Internet. For a broadband connec-
tion, you’re online all the time anyway, so it isn’t such a big deal. But, for dial-
up modems, don’t feel compelled to connect just because the connection
seems to automatically dial itself — especially when the computer starts.
 To cancel the connection, click the Cancel button when you see it dialing.
 Why is your computer connecting to the Internet? Most likely, it’s
because some program or Windows itself is requesting information.
Canceling that request isn’t a problem, nor does it mess things up.
Programs can wait until you want to connect to the Internet to conduct
their business. Dammit! You’re in charge!
Doing Something on the Internet 
(Using Internet Software)
After you have made the connection to your ISP, you’re ready to run any or
all of your Internet software. Fire up your Web browser, e-mail package, chat
room, or any of a number of applications designed for fun and folly on the
Internet.
 As long as you have an Internet connection, you can run any program
that accesses information on the Internet.
 Yes, you can run more than one Internet program at a time. I typically
have three or four of them going. (Because the Internet is slow, I can read
one window while waiting for something to appear in another window.)
 You can also stay on the Internet while using an application program,
like Word or Excel. Just don’t forget that you’re online.
 Close your Internet programs when you’re done with them.
309
Chapter 25: Your Basic Internet Introduction

Adios, Internet!
To wave bye-bye to the Internet, simply close all Internet programs. That’s it!
For a broadband connection, you’re done. In fact, you don’t even have to
close your Internet programs because the connection is active all the time.
For dial-up, you want to disconnect. After closing the last open Internet pro-
gram’s window, you see a Disconnect dialog box. Click the Disconnect or
Disconnect Now button.
If you don’t see the Disconnect dialog box, double-click the wee Connection
icon on the system tray. That displays the connection’s Status dialog box;
click the Disconnect button there to hang up.
 Dial-up connections must always disconnect from the Internet. Do not
forget!
 Sometimes, the connection may drop automatically, especially if you
haven’t done anything on the Internet for a while.
 Your ISP may sport an idle-time disconnection value. After a given
amount of time, the ISP may just hang up on you if it thinks that you’re
not alive.
 Keep track of how much time you have spent online by viewing the
Status dialog box; double-click the connection icon on the system tray.
This information is important when you eventually spend several more
hours on the Internet than you intended. View the time. Exclaim “My
goodness, that’s a long time!” and then click Close.

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 
Nasty programs!
The Internet may be a thriving community and full
of information, but it’s not exactly the safest place
to be. Because just about anyone can get on the
Internet, and because the Internet is an open
system, lots of bad guys are prowling out there.
They make nasty programs and can do nasty
things to your computer if you’re not careful.
Perhaps you have heard the words: spam, spy-
ware, viruses, worms, or pop-ups. These are all
nasty or annoying things that can make the
Internet less fun to use. Fortunately, you have
ways to prevent disaster and thwart the bad
guys. Your ISP should be your biggest source of
help in this area. You can also check out my
book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies
(Wiley) for more information on dealing with
nasty things on the Internet.

If you’re just starting out on the Internet, you should know about and use two
basic Internet concepts: The first is the World Wide Web, and the second is
e-mail.
The World Wide Web — or “the Web” — is directly responsible for making the
Internet as popular as it is today. The Web introduced pretty graphics and
formatted text to the Internet, which propelled it from its ugly all-text past.
And, e-mail is the most compelling reason to use the Internet. Something
about the instant nature of electronic communications makes some folks live
for e-mail.
Chapters 26 and 27 cover the Web and e-mail. They’re the two things you
waste time, er, spend time doing on the Internet more than anything else.

T
he Internet existed for many years before everyone and his aunt joined
the party. The main reason behind the surge in use was the World Wide
Web. Before the Web, information was available on the Internet, but not really
easy to get to. What the Web did was present the information on the Internet
in a magazine-like format, with pictures, fancy text — and lots of advertising!
Because the Web is on a computer, and not printed on paper, it has anima-
tions, games, and all sorts of fun and frivolity.
Honestly, the Web isn’t that hard to use; just about anyone can figure things
out, and you don’t really need a book to help you. Even so, I’m compelled to
write this chapter, which contains a quick review of basic Web operations
and then concentrates on some Web issues you may not be aware of. Oh, and
it has lots of tips.
Welcome to the Web
The chief piece of software used to access information on the Internet is a
Web browser, or browser, for short. It’s used to view information stored on
Web sites throughout the Internet.

The most popular Web browser is Internet Explorer, or IE. It comes with
Windows, and it’s your key to viewing the World Wide Web. Other Web
browsers are available, some that boast more features or are faster than IE.
They all work pretty much the same.
Starting Internet Explorer
Open the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop to start your Web browser.
(Note that the icon is also found in numerous other places in Windows; it’s
ubiquitous.)
If you’re not already connected to the Internet, after starting Internet
Explorer, you are (refer to Chapter 25). Soon, the Internet Explorer main
window fills with information from the World Wide Web, such as the Web
page shown in Figure 26-1.

Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

The first Web page you see in the Web browser’s window is the home page.
It’s merely your starting point on the Web, and it can be changed. (See the
section “There’s no place like home page,” later in this chapter.)
Touring the Internet Explorer window
You should notice a few things in the Web browser window:
Toolbar: You find, below the menu bar, a series of buttons. You use these but-
tons to visit various places on the Web and do basic things with your Web
browser. If you don’t see this bar, choose View➪Toolbars➪Standard Buttons
from the menu.
Busy thing: The far right end of the button bar has what I call the busy thing.
The busy thing becomes animated when your Web browser is busy doing
something, which usually means that it’s waiting for information to be sent
from the far-flung parts of the Internet. That’s your signal to sit, wait, and be
patient; the Web is busy.
Address bar: This box holds the addresses of the pages you visit, and it’s
also an input box where you can type Web page addresses and other com-
mands. If you don’t see this box, choose View➪Toolbars➪Address bar from
the menu.
Links bar: This handy toolbar lists popular places you like to visit on the
Web. See the section “Using the Links folder and Links toolbar,” later in this
chapter, for the details on using this handy toolbar.
Web page: The Web browser displays a page of information on the Web —
the Web page itself. In Figure 26-1, you see the Wambooli page, which is my
own Web page (http://www.wambooli.com).
Status bar: This final chunk of information attached to the Web browser
window often tells you important things or displays useful information. To
view it, choose View➪Status Bar.
The Web browser shows you how simple it is to view information on the
Internet. In its window, you see graphics and text — almost like reading a
magazine — and more; keep reading.
 The busy thing is busy a lot. It’s often said that the World Wide Web
should be World Wide Wait.
 If you have trouble seeing the text on a Web page, consider changing the
text size. Choose View➪Text Size from the menu and then choose a
larger or smaller size from the submenu.
315
Chapter 26: It’s a World Wide Web We Weave

 Web pages can be wider and often longer than what you see displayed in
your browser’s window. Don’t forget to use the scroll bars! Better still,
maximize the browser window to get the full-screen effect.
 The thing you type in the Address box is officially known as a URL (“you
are ell”). It’s an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator. Essentially, it’s a
command you give the Web browser to go out and find information on
the Internet.
Closing Internet Explorer
After you’re done browsing the World Wide Web — meaning that it’s 4 a.m.
and you need to get up in 90 minutes to get ready for work — you should
close Internet Explorer. This task is easy: Choose File➪Close from the menu.
Closing Internet Explorer doesn’t disconnect you from the Internet. If you’re
using a modem connection, you must manually disconnect if Windows doesn’t
automatically prompt you. Refer to Chapter 25 for more information on dis-
connecting from the Internet.
Visiting a Web page
The Web is divided into billions of locations called Web sites. These are sources
of information built by companies, communities, individuals, time travelers,
and others. The Web site itself is often divided into Web pages, like pages in a
magazine. Using the Web is all about viewing those Web pages by using your
computer’s Web browser.
There’s no place like home page
The Internet has two types of home pages. The first is the page you first see
when you start your Web browser. You can quickly return to this page, the
home page, by clicking the Home button on the Web browser’s toolbar.
The beauty of a home page is that you can change it. Your home page can be
any Web page on the Internet — or even a blank page, if you like.
To set a home page, follow these steps:
316
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

1. Visit the page you want to call home.
For example, my Web page is at www.wambooli.com. Type that in the
Address box to visit that page.
2. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
The Internet Options dialog box appears; click the General tab, if neces-
sary, so that it looks like Figure 26-2.
3. In the Home page area (in the top part of the dialog box), click the Use
Current button.
4. Click OK.
The new home page is now set. And, you can change it again at any time.
After all, it’s your home page!
Note that you can also set the home page to be blank, if that’s what you desire.
The other home page? That’s a personal page you create, your electronic
home on the Internet. Many ISPs offer you a place to create this home page.
Refer to your ISP for more information. And, yes, your personal home page
can also be the Web browser’s home page.

Chapter 26: It’s a World Wide Web We Weave

Typing a new Web page address
The most common way to visit one of the estimated three billion pages of
information on the World Wide Web is to type that Web page’s address into
your Web browser’s Address bar. Suppose that you want to visit the popular
Yahoo! Web portal. Its address is written like this:
http://www.yahoo.com/
Use the mouse to select any text already on the Address bar; press the
Backspace key to delete that text.
Type http, a colon, two forward slashes, www, a period, yahoo, another
period, and com. (Don’t type a final period at the end of the address.)
Double-check your typing and then press the Enter key. Soon, the Yahoo! Web
page appears in the browser’s window.
If something goes wrong: The most obvious reason for something going wrong
is that you mistyped the address. Double-check it! Everything must be exact.
Upper- and lowercase mean different things. Use the forward slash (/), not
the backslash (\). Go ahead and edit the address if you can, or just start over
and type it again.
 If the Web page doesn’t load, you may see some type of error message.
The first thing you should do is try again! The Web can be busy, and
often when it is, you get an error message.
 If you get a 404 error, you probably didn’t type the Web page address
properly. Try again: Just click the green arrow by the word Go on the far
right end of the Address bar.
 Web page addresses are often listed without the http:// part.
 Technically speaking, the http:// part is required if the Web page
address doesn’t begin with www (and quite a few are like that).
 If the URL starts with ftp:// or gopher://, you’re required to type
those commands.
Clicking a Web page link
The automatic way to visit a Web page is to click a Web page link. It appears as
underlined text on a Web page, often colored blue (though that’s not a hard-
and-fast rule). The clear sign that you have found a link is that when you point
at it, the mouse pointer changes to a pointing hand, as shown in the margin.
318
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

To use the link, click it once with the mouse. The Web browser immediately
picks up and moves off to display that Web page — just as though you had
typed the address manually.
 It’s called the Web because nearly every page has a link to other pages.
For example, a Web page about the end of the world may have links to
other Web pages about Nostradamus or the guy who walks around with
a sandwich board that says “Doom is near.”
 Not all links are text. Quite a few links are graphical. The only way to
know for certain is to point the mouse pointer at what you believe may
be a link. If the pointer changes to a pointing hand, you know that it’s a
link you can click to see something else.
 Links can appear anywhere on a Web page.
 Link is short for hyperlink — another bit of trivia to occupy a few dozen
neurons.
Navigating the Web
Using the Web is often like becoming engrossed in an encyclopedia or dis-
tracted by multiple articles in a newspaper. The folks who make Web browser
software understand this distraction, so they have created a number of ways
for you to not become lost or to retrace your steps as you surf the Web. Here
are some handy tools you can use:
To return to the Web page you were just ogling, use your browser’s Back
button. You can continue clicking the Back button to revisit each Web page
you have gawked at, all the way back to the first page you saw 18 hours ago.
If you really need to dig deep, click the down arrow by the Back button. A list
of the last several Web pages you have visited appears.
If you need to return to where you were after going back, use the Forward
button. Back. Forward. It’s like playing the game Sorry! with a sadistic 
8-year-old.
If you accidentally click a link and change your mind, click the Stop button.
The Internet then stops sending you information. (You may need to click the
Back button to return to where you were.)
The browser’s Refresh button serves a useful purpose in the world of ever-
changing information. Refresh merely tells the Internet to update the Web
page you’re viewing.
319
Chapter 26: It’s a World Wide Web We Weave

Here are the reasons for clicking the Refresh button:
Web page not found: Don’t give up too easily! The Internet can lie; click the
Refresh button and give that Web page another try.
Changing information: Some Web pages have updating information on them.
Clicking the Refresh button always gets you the latest version of the Web page.
Missing pictures: Occasionally, a graphical image may not appear. In that
case, a blank icon shows up, to tell you that the image is missing. Often, click-
ing the Refresh button works some magic that causes the image to reappear.
Accidentally clicking the Stop button: Oops! Click Refresh to unstop and
reload the Web page.
Finding Things on the Web
The Web is like a library without a librarian. It doesn’t have a card catalog,
either. And, forget about finding something on the shelves: Web pages aren’t
organized in any fashion, nor is the information in them guaranteed to be
complete or accurate. Because anyone can post anything on the Web, well,
anyone does.
Engines for searching
You find something on the Web by using a search engine. It’s a Web page that
features a huge catalog of other Web pages. You can search through the cata-
log for whatever you want. Results are displayed, and you can click links to
eventually get to the Web page you want. It’s all very nifty.
My main search engine these days is Google, at www.google.com. I admire it
for its simplicity and thoroughness. Simply type what you’re looking for in
Google’s sole text box. Click the Google Search button. After a few moments,
Google displays a new page full of findings — Web pages on the Internet that
more or less match what it is you’re looking for in one way or another.
When the search engine finds more than one page of information, you see a
Next 20 Matches link (or something similar) at the bottom of the page. Click
that link to see the next list of Web pages that were found.
Google isn’t the only search engine, though I believe that it’s probably the
best. I have listed a variety of others in Table 26-1.

Tips for a successful Web search
The more information you give in the Search text box, the more accurate the
Web page results. Avoid using small words (such as the, of, and, but, with, and
for) and put the most important words first.
Suppose that you want to find a MIDI file of the theme from the old “Dragnet”
TV show. Type this line:
Dragnet theme MIDI
If words must be found together, enclose them in double quotes, such as
“Gilligan’s Island” theme MIDI
or
“Toro riding lawnmower” repair
This search finds only Web pages that list the words Toro riding lawnmower
together in that order.
If the results — the matching or found Web pages — are too numerous, click
the link (near the bottom of the page) that says Search within results.
That way, you can further refine your search. For example, if you found several
hundred pages on Walt Disney World but are specifically looking for a map of
the Animal Kingdom, you can search for “Animal Kingdom map” within the
results found for Walt Disney World.
321
Chapter 26: It’s a World Wide Web We Weave

We All Have Our Favorites
Often, you find some Web place you love and want to visit again. If so, drop a
bookmark on that page. That way, you can visit it at any time by selecting the
bookmark from a list.
To drop a bookmark, use the Ctrl+D command — D for drop.
This command places the bookmark on the Favorites menu in Internet
Explorer. That way, you can revisit the Web page by plucking it from the
Favorites menu. It’s a walk in the park, minus the bunions.
 Never fear to add a Web page to your Favorites! It’s better to add it now
and delete it later than to regret not adding it in the first place.
 If you forget to drop a bookmark, use the drop-down list on the Address
bar’s Back button to locate a Web site you have visited recently. Or, you
can use the History list; see the section “History 101,” later in this chapter.
 I really wish that Microsoft would call favorites by their proper name:
bookmarks. Every other Web browser uses bookmarks instead. That
name is just so much more descriptive than favorites.
Organizing your Favorites
The Favorites menu can get messy quickly. The solution to that, or to any
mess on the computer, is to organize. You can organize your Favorites menu
by deleting unwanted bookmarks or by creating submenus and sub-sub-
menus full of Web pages you have visited. It’s all quite easy.
To organize the Favorites menu in Internet Explorer, choose Favorites➪
Organize Favorites. The Organize Favorites dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 26-3.
Figure 26-3:
The
Organize
Favorites
dialog box.
322
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

To move a selected bookmark into a folder, you can drag and drop the book-
mark with the mouse or use the Move to Folder button.
To create a new folder, click the Create Folder button. The New folder appears,
named New Folder, though you can type a new name for it at that time.
Rename a bookmark by selecting the bookmark and then clicking the Rename
button. This is a good idea, especially for long bookmark names, which make
the Favorites menu very wide. For example, I changed the quite long name of
my 235-character local weather Web page to read only “Weather,” which is all
I need to know when choosing that site from the Favorites menu.
And, of course, to delete unwanted bookmarks, select them with the mouse
and click the Delete button.
 I try to keep on the Favorites menu only as many bookmarks as will fit
on the screen. If I open the Favorites menu and it starts to scroll off the
screen, I know I need to go in and do some organizing.
 Create folders for specific categories of bookmarks: News, Weather,
Sports, Music, Movies, Fun Stuff, Computer Reference, or whatever
you’re into.
 You can use submenus to further organize your topics.
 Feel free to delete any favorites that Microsoft preinstalled on the
Favorites menu. Those bookmarks are from companies that paid money
to have their products advertised there.
Using the Links folder and Links toolbar
One special folder that comes already set up inside the Internet Explorer
Favorites menu is the Links folder. The items that appear in that folder also
appear on the Links toolbar in Internet Explorer, which makes those links
even handier to get at.
To make the Links toolbar appear, choose View➪Toolbar➪Links from the
menu. The toolbar displays whatever links are saved in the Favorites\Links
folder. That’s where I put my most favorite Web pages: news, weather,
Wambooli, and shopping, for example. They appear right on the Links 
toolbar, as shown in Figure 26-1.
Subfolders in the Links folder appear as menus on the Links toolbar.
323
Chapter 26: It’s a World Wide Web We Weave

History 101
Internet Explorer remembers every Web page you have visited today, yester-
day, and sometimes for the past several weeks. Many people like this feature;
it lets them review where they have been and revisit those places. Many more
people despise this feature because it lets anyone else snoop on where they
have been on the Internet.
Looking at the History list
To see the History list, click the History button on the Internet Explorer tool-
bar. The History panel appears on the left side of the Internet Explorer window.
The panel is divided into areas by date: Today, Last Week, 2 Weeks Ago, and 
3 Weeks Ago, similar to what’s shown in Figure 26-4.
Beneath each date are folders representing the Web sites you have visited.
Open a folder to view the list of individual pages.
Close the History list when you’re done with it: Click the X (close) button in
the History panel, or just click the History button on the toolbar.
 To revisit a page, simply choose it from the History list. For example,
open the Last Week item, choose the Scandinavian Puns Web site, and
choose an individual page from the site you visited last week.
 The keyboard shortcut for the History list is Ctrl+H.
Figure 26-4:

panel.
324
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Clearing the History list
Often, history doesn’t reflect kindly on you. Fortunately, Internet Explorer
offers several ways to delete, if not rewrite, your history:
 To remove a page or Web site from the list, right-click that item. Choose
Delete from the pop-up shortcut menu.
 To clear all items from the History list, choose Tools➪Internet Options.
In the Internet Options dialog box, on the General tab, click the Clear
History button. Click OK.
 To disable the History list, choose Tools➪Internet Options to display the
Internet Options dialog box. On the General tab, locate the History area.
Reset the Days to Keep Pages in History option to zero, which disables
the Internet Explorer History feature. Click OK.
Printing Web Pages
To print any Web page, choose File➪Print from the menu. No tricks.
Some Web pages, unfortunately, don’t print right. Some are too wide. Some
are white text on a black background, which doesn’t print well. My advice is
to always use the Print Preview command to look at what’s printing before
you print it. If you still have trouble, consider one of these solutions:
 Consider saving the Web page to disk; choose File➪Save As. Ensure that
you choose from the Save As Type drop-down list the option labeled
Web Page, Complete. Then you can open the Web page file in Microsoft
Word or Excel, or any Web page editing program, and edit or print it
from there.
 Use the File➪Page Setup program to select landscape orientation for
printing wider-than-normal Web pages.
 Use the Properties button in the Print dialog box to adjust the printer.
These settings depend on the printer itself, but I have seen printers that
can reduce the output to 75 or 50 percent, which ensures that the entire
Web page prints on a single sheet of paper. Other options may let you
print in shades of gray or black and white.

Nothing perks up your Internet day like getting fresh e-mail. Ahhhh, people
care enough about me to write! I’m loved!
This chapter deals with e-mail, which can be an obsession for some folks. In
fact, if you’re like most people, you probably run both your Web browser and
e-mail program at the same time. That way, you don’t “miss anything” while
you’re on the Internet.
 This book assumes that you have Outlook Express (Version 6), the
e-mail package that comes free with Windows.
 Outlook Express is not the same program as Outlook, which is another
e-mail program distributed with Microsoft Office. Outlook Express is also
not the only e-mail program available. A popular alternative, and a
favorite of mine, is Eudora: www.eudora.com.
 If you haven’t yet set up e-mail accounts on your computer, the first time
you run Outlook Express it starts a wizard that walks you through the
necessary steps.

Starting Outlook Express
Start Outlook Express by opening the Outlook Express icon on the desktop (as
shown in the margin). You may also find the icon on the Quick Launch bar.
If you aren’t already connected to the Internet, starting Outlook Express con-
nects you. If not, refer to Chapter 25 for information on connecting to the
Internet.
You cannot send or receive e-mail unless your computer is connected to the
Internet.
The main screen
The first thing Outlook does is check for new mail. See the section “Reading
e-mail,” later in this chapter, if you really can’t wait to get started. Outlook
also sends any mail you have waiting.
Figure 27-1 details the Outlook Express screen. It consists of three parts:
Folders list
Contact list
Message summary
Figure 27-1:
Outlook
Express,

program.
328
Part IV: The Softer Side of Computing 

Folders list: In the upper-left area of the window is the list of folders where
sent, received, trashed, and filed mail goes.
Contact list: In the lower-left area is a list of contacts, people with whom you
may normally communicate.
Message summary: On the right is a home page of sorts for messages, news-
groups, and stuff. You may or may not see this screen. Instead, you can con-
figure Outlook Express to display your Inbox whenever you switch it on: Click
to put a check in the box by the option When Starting, Go Directly to My
Inbox Folder.
The inbox
The opening screen for Outlook Express is something you really don’t want
to see. No, you want to get that mail! Click the Inbox link to see any old or
new messages you have received.
When you go to the Inbox (see Figure 27-2), the right side of the screen splits
into two parts. The upper-right part shows the queue of e-mail in the Inbox.
Bold text indicates unread mail; normal text indicates read mail (and the
open/closed envelope icon confirms this information).
Figure 27-2:
The Outlook
Express
Inbox view.
329
Chapter 27: Basic E-Mail

The lower-right part of the window shows a preview of the message’s contents.
Between the left and right sides of the window is a separator bar. You can
drag that bar with the mouse, to make either side larger. My advice is to drag
the separator bar to the left, to make the Inbox and preview windows larger.
Closing Outlook Express
To close Outlook Express when you’re done, close the program’s window. Or,
choose File➪Exit from the menu.
If Outlook Express is the last Internet program you close, dial-up connections
are prompted to disconnect from the Internet. If you’re finished, disconnect!
Composing and Replying to E-Mail
The reason you use an e-mail program like Outlook Express is to both com-
pose e-mail and — you hope — receive e-mail. Remember: To get e-mail, you
must first send some.
This section assumes that you’re using Outlook Express as your e-mail pro-
gram. Other e-mail programs behave similarly.
Sending e-mail
To create a new message in Outlook Express, click the Create Mail button.
The New Message window appears, as shown in Figure 27-3. Your job is to fill
in the blanks — four of them:
To: To whom are you sending the message? Type the person’s e-mail address
in the To field. Important things to note:
 Don’t put spaces in an e-mail address. If you think that it’s a space, it’s
probably an underline or a period.
 You must enter the full e-mail address: zorgon@wambooli.com. Note the
single exception: If you have e-mail nicknames set up, you can type the
nickname rather than the full e-mail address in the To field. (See the sec-
tion “The Valued Address Book” later in this chapter, for information on
nicknames.)
 You can type more than one address in the To field. If so, separate each
with a semicolon or comma, as in
president@whitehouse.gov, first.lady@whitehouse.gov
330
Part IV: The Softer Side of Computing 

Cc: The carbon copy field is used to send a copy of the e-mail to another
person, as sort of a For Your Information type of thing. People whose e-mail
addresses are put in the Cc field receive the message, but they know that the
message wasn’t directly intended for them.
Subject: Type the message’s subject. What is the message about? It helps if
the subject is somehow related to the message (because the recipients see
the subject in their Inboxes, just like you do).
The message: The last thing to fill in is the contents. Type the message!
When you’re done composing your e-epistle, check your spelling by clicking
the Spelling button. Your message is scanned, and potential misspelled words
are flagged. Select the properly spelled word from the dialog box — the same
drill you go through with your word processor’s spell check feature.
Review your message! Spell checking doesn’t check for grammatical errors or
potentially offensive outrageous statements. Remember that you can’t recall
e-mail after it’s sent!
Finally, you send the message. Click the Send button, and it’s off to the Internet,
delivered cheaper and more accurately than by any post office on earth.
If you don’t want to send the message, close the New Message window. You’re
asked whether you want to save the message. Click Yes to save it in the
Drafts folder. If you click No, the message is destroyed.
Figure 27-3:
The New
Message
window.
331
Chapter 27: Basic E-Mail

 You can start a new message by pressing Ctrl+N or choosing File➪New➪
Mail Message from the menu bar.
 If you type the wrong e-mail address, the message bounces back to you.
It isn’t a bad thing; just try again with the proper address.
 An e-mail message is sent instantly. I sent a message to a reader in Aus-
tralia one evening and got a reply from him in fewer than 10 minutes.
 Please don’t type in ALL CAPS. To most people, all caps reads like
YOU’RE SHOUTING AT THEM!
 Spell checking in Outlook Express works only if you have Microsoft Word
or the entire Microsoft Office package installed. Otherwise, you cannot
spell-check in Outlook Express.
 Be careful what you write. E-mail messages are often casually written,
and they can easily be misinterpreted. Remember to keep them light.
 Don’t expect a quick reply from e-mail, especially from folks in the com-
puter industry (which is ironic).
 To send a message you have shoved off to the Drafts folder, open the
Drafts folder. Then double-click the message to open it. The original New
Message window is then redisplayed. From there, you can edit the mes-
sage and click the Send button to finally send it off.
 Also see Chapter 28, which covers e-mail file attachments.
Reading e-mail
To read a message, select it from the list in the Inbox. The message text
appears in the bottom of the Outlook Express window, as shown earlier, in
Figure 27-2. You can read any message on the list like this, in any order;
selecting a new message displays its contents in the bottom part of the
window.
Of course, you’re not stuck viewing the message in the crowded jail of the
Outlook Express multiple-window inferno. No, if you like, you can open a mes-
sage window by double-clicking the message in the Inbox. A special message-
reading window opens, similar to the one shown in Figure 27-4.
Because the message has its own window, you can resize or drag around the
message anywhere on the screen. And, you can open more than one message-
reading window at a time, which helps if you need to refer to more than one
message at a time (those he-said-she-said things, for example).
The message-reading window also has two handy buttons: Previous and Next.
332
Part IV: The Softer Side of Computing 

Click the Previous button to read the previous message in the Inbox, the one
before the current message.
Click the Next button to read the next message in your Inbox. If you’re read-
ing the last message in the Inbox, clicking the Next button makes an annoying
sound.
As with a Web page, if you have trouble seeing the text in an e-mail message,
choose View➪Text Size from the menu and choose a larger or smaller size
from the submenu.
After reading e-mail
After reading a message, you can do one of many things to it.
To print an e-mail message, choose File➪Print from the menu. The Print
dialog box appears; click OK to print. You can also print a message by click-
ing the Print button on the toolbar.
To send an answer or follow-up to an e-mail message, click the Reply button.
Figure 27-4:

vidual mail

333
Chapter 27: Basic E-Mail

Note that Outlook Express does several things for you automatically:
 The sender’s name is automatically placed in the To field. Your reply
goes directly to the sender without your having to retype an address.
 The original subject is referenced (Re) on the Subject line.
 Finally, the original message is quoted for you. This feature is important
because some people receive lots of e-mail and may not recall the train
of the conversation.
Type your reply and then click the Send button to send it off.
Forwarding a message is the same as remailing it to someone else. To forward
a message, click the Forward button. The forwarded message appears quoted
in the body of the new message. Type any optional comments. Fill in the To
field with the address of the person to whom you’re forwarding the message.
Finally, click the Send button to send it off.
To delete the message you’re reading, click the Delete button. Poof! It’s gone.
(To be accurate, the message is merely moved into the Deleted Items folder
on the left side of the Outlook Express window.)
 You don’t have to do anything with a message after reading it; you can
just keep it in your Inbox. There’s no penalty for that.
 You can edit the quoted text when replying to or forwarding a message.
The quoted text isn’t “locked” or anything. I typically split up quoted
text when I reply to e-mail — even delete chunks — so that I can address
topics individually.
 Use the Reply All button when you reply to a message that was carbon-
copied to a number of other people. By clicking Reply All, you create a
reply that lists everyone the original message was sent to so that they
can all read the reply.
 You can use the Forward button to resend bounced e-mail messages to
the proper address. The forwarding keyboard command is Ctrl+F. Just
type the proper address and maybe an explanation of how you goofed or
something, and click the Send button to send it off again.
 Deleted mail sits in the Deleted Items folder until you clean out that folder.
To clean it out, choose Edit➪Empty Deleted Items Folder from the menu.
The Valued Address Book
Whenever you get e-mail from someone new, or whenever you learn a friend’s
new online address, you should note it in the Outlook Express Address Book.
Not only does the Address Book let you keep the addresses in one spot, but
you can also easily recall an address for sending mail later.
334
Part IV: The Softer Side of Computing 

Adding a name to the Address Book
You can add an e-mail name to your Address Book in one of two ways: manu-
ally or automatically.
Manually adding names: To manually add a name to your Address Book,
choose File➪New➪Contact from the menu. Outlook then creates a new
Address Book entry (as shown in Figure 27-5), which you fill in.
The dialog box has many tabs and gizmos for you to work, but you need to fill
in only four items on the Name tab: First, Last, Nickname, and E-Mail Addresses.
The Nickname item is optional, though it can be handy. For example, you can
type goober rather than your brother’s full e-mail address in the To field of a
new message. Outlook Express recognizes the shortcut and replaces it with
the proper, full e-mail address.
After filling in the four fields (or more, if you’re entirely bored), click the Add
button and then click OK.
Automatically adding names: To automatically add a name to the Address
book, display an e-mail message from someone whose name you want to add.
Choose Tools➪Add to Address Book➪Sender from the menu. Outlook
instantly adds the name to the Address Book.
Click the Addresses button on the toolbar to display the Address Book window.
From there, you can edit or manage the entries in your Address Book.
Figure 27-5:

Chapter 27: Basic E-Mail

Using the Address Book 
when sending a message
The Address Book really comes in handy when you’re creating a new message.
With the New Message window on the screen, click the To field’s button, as
shown in the margin. A special Address Book window appears, as shown in
Figure 27-6.
To add someone to the To field, select that person’s name and click the To
button; likewise for the Cc or Bcc fields. To select more than one e-mail address
at a time, press and hold the Ctrl key and then Ctrl+click to select the names.
(Release the Ctrl key when you’re done selecting.)
When you’re done, click OK, and the message’s To, Cc, and Bcc fields are
already filled in for you.
Creating a group
Often, you want to send e-mail to more than one person — for example, all
the folks on your Jokes, Sappy Stories, Family, or whatever lists. By creating a
group, you can save yourself some time spent typing all those addresses over
and over.
Figure 27-6:
Select

e-mail to.
336
Part IV: The Softer Side of Computing 

To create a group, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Address Book to open the Address Book.
2. Choose File➪New Group.
A dialog box appears, where you can create the group.
3. Type a name for the group.
Be clever and descriptive. The Jokes group can be named Jokes. The
people you send messages to regarding your nude quilting group can be
named Nude Quilters.
4. Add members to the group.
Use the Select Members button to pick whom you want to be in the
group. This action displays another dialog box, from which you can cull
your list of e-mail contacts and add them to the group: Select the names
and addresses from the left side of the window and use the Select button
to add them to the group on the right side.
5. Click OK when you’re done adding members.
6. Click OK to close the group’s Properties window.
7. Close the Address Book window.
You’re ready to use the group.
To send a message to the group, type the group’s name in the To, Cc, or Bcc
field. The message is then sent to that group of people automatically.
You can also click the To button, as described in the preceding section, to
choose a group from the list in your Address Book.

Chapter 27: Basic E-Mail
Putting Bcc to work
The sneaky Bcc field is used to blind carbon-
copy a message, which involves sending a copy
of a message to someone and having that
person’s name not appear in any copy of the
e-mail. That way, you can clue people in to a
message without having its true recipients
know the names of everyone else who received
the message.
To access the Bcc field, choose View➪All
Headers from the New Message window’s
menu. The people in the Bcc field receive a
copy of the e-mail message just like everyone
else; however, the people in the To or Cc fields
don’t see the Bcc field names listed.

Remember that you must always have a name in the To field; if you don’t
want to put anyone specific there, just use your own e-mail address.
By the way, putting the group in the Bcc field is a wonderful idea; see the
nearby sidebar “Putting Bcc to work” for more information.
A great way to use Bcc is when you send a message to several people. For
example, when sending out That Latest Joke, just put everyone’s name in the
Bcc field and put your own name in the To field. That way, everyone gets the
joke (or not, as the case may be), and they don’t see the huge stack-o-names
at the start of the e-mail message.

 Finding files and programs on the Internet

 Receiving a file with your e-mail
 Sending a file with your e-mail
T
he Internet was borne of the need to fling files far and wide between the
early steam-powered computers of the past century. Thank goodness, it’s
much easier to do today. You can send a file to anyone by adding an attach-
ment to your e-mail. You can fetch files either through e-mail messages or by
grabbing them from Web pages. Or, you can venture into the mysterious
waters of FTP. This chapter tells you the details.
Grabbing Stuff from a Web Page
The Internet is brimming with files and programs just waiting for you to seize
a copy. Work some magic, and the file is piped into your PC just as though
you had copied it from a CD-ROM (though not as fast). You can grab files, pro-
grams, fonts, graphics — just about anything and everything you want. And,
it’s as cinchy as clicking your mouse.
 Copying a file to your computer is known as downloading. When some-
one sends you a file over the Internet, you download it. (Think of the
other computer as being on top of a hill; it may not be, but it helps to
think of it that way.)
 Sending a file to another computer is known as uploading.
 Complaining to your best friend over a beer is known as unloading.

Saving an entire Web page to disk
To save an entire Web page to disk, choose File➪Save As in Internet Explorer.
A Save Web Page dialog box appears, similar to the Save As dialog box in any
other application. Use the dialog box to save the Web page to disk.
 Saving a Web page saves an HTML file to disk. That file contains the for-
matting instructions for the Web page. (It’s basically a text file, though
not that readable.)
 You can view the Web page offline by using Internet Explorer; the saved
Web page opens and is displayed just as though you were connected to
the Internet.
 You can also view saved Web pages by using a Web page editor, such as
FrontPage. Business applications, such as Microsoft Word and Excel, can
also be used to view Web pages.
 I know many people who save Web pages for reading later, offline. In
fact, saving a fun Web page for reading during a long airplane flight is a
great way to spend your time.
Saving an image from a Web page
To save an image from a Web page to your PC’s hard drive, right-click the
image and choose Save Picture As from the pop-up menu. Use the Save As
dialog box to find a happy home for the picture on your hard drive.
 Nearly all images on the Web are copyrighted. Although you’re free to
save a copy to your hard drive, you’re not free to duplicate, sell, or dis-
tribute the image without the consent of the copyright holder.
 To set the image as your desktop wallpaper, choose Set As Background
from the pop-up menu after right-clicking the image.
 If you point the mouse at a picture long enough, an image toolbar
appears. The buttons are, from left to right, Save the Image to Disk, Print
the Image, Send the Image As an e-Mail Attachment, and Open the My
Pictures Folder.
Saving text from a Web page to disk
Most Web pages display plain text. You can copy that text and save it to disk
just as you would copy text from one application and paste it into another.
Here’s how:
340
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

1. Select the text you want to copy.
Drag the mouse over the text, which highlights it on the screen. The text
is now selected.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Start any word processor.
You can start Notepad, WordPad, or your word processor, such as
Microsoft Word.
4. Paste the text into your word processor.
Ctrl+V or Edit➪Paste.
5. Print. Save. Whatever.
Use the proper menu commands to save or print or edit the text you
copied from the Web page.
Getting Software from the Internet
The Internet is a great repository of software, various programs for free or
nearly free, which you can download to your computer for use, tryout, or just
because. This section covers downloading software from the Internet.
 A repository is a location where things are stored.
 A suppository is medicine you eat, but not with your mouth.
Searching for programs
The first step to getting software from the Internet is to find it. Many soft-
ware companies have a direct Internet presence, so by merely finding their
Web pages, you can visit the download area and see which files they have 
up for grabs.
You can also use a search engine to locate files, or, specifically, you can use file-
searching engines to find things. Two examples are the C|NET Shareware.com
(www.shareware.com) and IT Pro Downloads (http://itprodownloads.com)
sites. Use these sites just like search engines: You can search for files of a
specific type, or you can browse by category to see what’s available.
341
Chapter 28: Files to Here, Files from There!

Creating a Downloads folder
Because downloads need a place to be saved on your computer, I recom-
mend creating a special Downloads folder for them. That way, you can always
keep your downloaded programs and files together and quickly locate a
downloaded file if you ever need to reinstall it.
Follow these steps to create a special Downloads folder:
1. Open the My Documents icon on the desktop.
2. Choose File➪New➪Folder.
3. Name the folder My Downloads.
Or, just name it Downloads if the entire My prefix-thing bugs you.
Whenever you download a file, use the Save As dialog box to browse to the
My Downloads folder and save your downloaded file there.
 Keep a copy of the program’s registration number in the Downloads
folder, in case you eventually buy the software. Most registration num-
bers are e-mailed. When you receive that e-mail, choose the File➪Save
As command to save a copy of the message in the Downloads folder.
 It’s okay to delete a file from the My Downloads folder after the file’s pro-
gram has been installed. I don’t do it, however, because I like to keep
everything in case I need to reinstall it again.
 Another folder, found in the Windows folder, is named Downloaded
Program Files. This folder is used for updates to Internet Explorer, and
its contents aren’t for you to play with.
Downloading a file from the Internet
To download a file, simply click the proper link or wait for the download to
start automatically. This instruction is apparent whether you’re using a file
search engine or downloading a program from a developer’s Web site; click-
ing the link starts the downloading process.
After the download begins, you see a File Download dialog box, as shown in
Figure 28-1. Click the Save button. Do not click the Open button! The Save
button lets you save the file on your hard drive, which is where you want it. 
If you click Open, Internet Explorer attempts to run the program over the
Internet, which is probably not what you want, not to mention slow and a
high security risk. Click Save instead!
342
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Clicking the Save button displays the Save As dialog box. Use it to browse 
to the Downloads folder (which you may have created in the preceding 
subsection).
Rename the file. In the Save As dialog box’s File Name box, type a new, more
descriptive name for the file. Be sure not to rename the EXE or ZIP filename
extension (if it’s visible).
For example, rename the file DSLST45.ZIP to DSL Speed Test 45.ZIP. That’s a
much more memorable name than the original name. There’s nothing wrong
with renaming a file you’re saving on your computer.
Click the Save button, and the other computer on the Internet begins sending
your computer the file.
While the file is downloading, feel free to go off and do something else on the
Web; you don’t have to sit and watch the file download — but you must stay
connected to the Internet. If the connection drops, you have to start over and
redo everything.
To find out what to do after the file is downloaded, see the next section.
Figure 28-1:
The File
Download
dialog box.
343
Chapter 28: Files to Here, Files from There!
How long does it take to download a file?
Honestly, the progress meter you see when a
file is being downloaded is for entertainment
value only; no one really knows how long it
takes to download a file. If the Internet is busy,
it may take longer than estimated — even for a
fast modem. Consider the time that’s displayed
as only a rough estimate.

Installing and using downloaded software
Two things need to happen after you successfully download a file. These two
things depend on the type of file you have downloaded.
If you just saved to disk a regular EXE or program file, you should run it:
Double-click its icon in the Downloads folder, which runs the installation or
Setup program and gets you going. Follow the instructions on the screen.
If the file is a zip file, you have more work to do. Zip files open as compressed
folders in Windows XP, so your first step is to open the compressed folder
and see what lies inside. Hopefully, you see a README document that you
can open and view to see what to do next.
If you see no README document, your job is to extract all the files from the
compressed folder archive, to copy them into their own folder on the hard
drive. Right-click the Compressed Folder icon and choose Extract All from
the pop-up menu. Then, use the Extraction Wizard to determine a folder in
which the files are extracted.
For example, create a new folder in the C:\Program Files folder for a program
or utility you just downloaded.
After extracting the files from the Compressed Folder archive, check to see
whether it has a Setup or Install program you then have to run to complete
installation.
 Downloading the file is free. If the file is shareware, however, you’re
expected to pay for it if you use it.
 Even though the file was downloaded, if you don’t want it, you have to
uninstall it as you would uninstall any program (refer to Chapter 23).
Look, Ma! It’s an E-Mail Attachment!
E-mail attachments are fun — fun to send and fun to receive. They’re a conve-
nient and popular way to send files back and forth on the Internet.
This section covers sending and receiving e-mail file attachments by using
the Outlook Express (OE) e-mail program that comes with Windows. The
steps described are similar for other e-mail programs. (Refer to Chapter 27
for more basic information on e-mail.)
344
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 

Grabbing an attachment 
with Outlook Express
The secret of attachments in Outlook Express is the paper clip icon. When
you see the paper clip icon next to the message subject in the Inbox, it indi-
cates that the e-mail message has one or more files attached to it. Yee-haw!
When you read the message, you see an Attach Header line appear on the
regular list of From, Date, To, and Subject. That header appears by the file or
files attached to the message.
Attachments aren’t anything until you open them. To open an attachment,
double-click its icon by the Attach heading. A warning dialog box may
appear; my advice is to always save the attachment to disk; choose that
option and click OK. Then, use the Save Attachment As dialog box to save 
the file to a memorable place on your computer’s hard drive.
An exception for attached files is graphics files. They appear as images below
the message body itself. You don’t have to do anything; the images just show
up. (If not, the images that were sent aren’t proper Internet graphics files,
such as JPEG or PNG.)
With the attachment saved, you can reply to or delete the message as you
normally would.
 I save my attachments in the My Documents folder. After looking at them
or examining their contents, I then shuffle them off to the proper folder.
 To save multiple attachments at one time, choose File➪Save
Attachments. You can then use the Save Attachments dialog box to save
them all at once to a folder on the hard drive.
 Even if Outlook Express displays graphics files directly in your message,
you may still want to choose File➪Save Attachments to save them to disk.
 Don’t open attachments you weren’t expecting, especially program files —
even if they’re from people you know. Just delete the message. Or, if
you’re using antivirus software (which I highly recommend), the antivirus
program may alert you to the nasty program’s presence even before you
open the e-mail.
 For more information on fighting nasty programs on the Internet, refer to
my book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 At some point, you may receive a file that your PC cannot digest — a file
of an unknown format. If so, the dreaded Open With dialog box appears.
Quickly, ignore it! Choose Cancel. Then respond to the e-mail and tell the
person that you can’t open the file and need to have it re-sent in another
format.
345
Chapter 28: Files to Here, Files from There!

Sending an attachment in Outlook Express
You attach a file in Outlook Express by — can you guess? — clicking the big
paper clip Attach button in the New Message window. Yup, it’s that easy.
Start by creating a new message or replying to a message. (Refer to Chapter 27
for the details.) When you’re ready to attach a file, click the Attach button or
choose Insert➪File Attachment from the menu.
Use the Insert Attachment dialog box to find the file you want to attach. It
works exactly like an Open or Browse dialog box. After finding and selecting
the file, click the Attach button.
The file you attach appears on a new line in the New Message window, right
below the Subject line.
To send the message and the file, click the Send button. And it’s off, on its
merry way. . . .
346
Part IV: The Soft Side of Computing 
Things you don’t need to know about FTP
FTP is one of those ubiquitous three letter
acronyms (TLAs) that litter computer jargon like
empty Pabst cans at a NASCAR race. It stands
for File Transfer Protocol, and it’s also a verb that
generically means “to send files hither and
thither on the Internet.” For example, when you
grab a file from the Web, as described in this
chapter, your PC is really using FTP to get the file.
You can also use specific FTP programs if all
you want is to get files. Just as there are Web
servers on the Internet — computers that dish
up Web pages — there are FTP servers, or
computers that just list a host of files. You can
use your Web browser to access an FTP server,
or you can use specific FTP software, such as
SmartFTP, from www.smartftp.com.
Theoretically, using FTP is just like working with
files in Windows. The difference is that rather
than copy files between one disk drive and
another, you copy them from one computer to
another over the Internet. Also, some FTP
servers require a password for access, and that
seems to bewilder some folks.
The only real reason to mess with FTP any more
is when you plan to create your own Web page.
In that case, you need an FTP program, or to use
FTP as part of your Web page creation program,
to get the Web page from your computer onto
the Internet. That’s a whole other book, so I
think I’ll stop writing about FTP right here.

 Sending a message with a file attached takes longer than sending a regu-
lar, text-only message.
 You should ensure that the recipient of a message can read the type of
file you’re sending. For example, sending a Word file to a WordPerfect
user may not meet with the results you want.
 Note that some folks cannot receive large files. Sometimes, the limit is
5MB, but I have seen it as low as 1MB. The alternative? Burn a CD-R and
send the files through the regular mail. (Refer to Chapter 24 for informa-
tion on burning CD-Rs.)
 Send JPEG or PNG pictures. Any other picture format is usually too large
and makes the recipient wait a long time to receive the message.
 You can send more than one file at a time — just keep attaching files.
 Or, rather than send several small files, consider putting them all in a
compressed folder and just sending the single compressed folder
instead.
 Don’t send file shortcuts; send only originals. If you send a shortcut, the
people receiving the file don’t get the original. Instead, they get the 296-
byte shortcut, which doesn’t help.
 Try not to move or delete any files you attach to e-mail messages until
after you send the message. I know that it sounds dumb, but too often,
as I wait for my e-mail to be sent out (while I’m not busy), I start cleaning
files. Oops!

M
aking up lists is a fun, if perhaps useless, exercise.
Remember the old chestnut “Ten books you would
want to have on a desert island”? It’s just a mental exer-
cise. I mean, if you were really stranded on a desert island
and someone else were proud of the fact that they had
these 10 books with them, wouldn’t you want to strangle
that person? I know folks who have their lists of “10 desert
island CDs” and “10 desert island friends.” But, folks, it’s
not about the desert island — it’s about creating lists,
which is what you will find in this part of the book.

 Buying too much software
 Buying incompatible hardware

 Not backing up files
 Opening or deleting unknown things

 Replying to spam

S
ure, you can make a gazillion mistakes with a computer, whether it’s
deleting the wrong file or dropping the color laser printer on your toe. But
I have narrowed the list to ten. These are the day-to-day operating mistakes
that people tend to repeat until they’re told not to, or they read about it here.
Not Properly Shutting Down Windows
When you’re done with Windows, shut it down. Choose the Turn Off Computer
command from the Start panel, click the Turn Off button, and wait until your
PC turns itself off.
 Don’t just flip the power switch when you’re done.
 Refer to Chapter 4 for detailed PC shutdown instructions.

Buying Too Much Software
Your PC probably came out of the box with dozens of programs preinstalled.
(No, you’re not required to use them; refer to Chapter 23, the section about
uninstalling software.) Even with all that software preinstalled, don’t over-
whelm yourself by getting more software right away.
Buying too much software isn’t really the sin here. The sin is buying too much
software and trying to learn it all at once. The buy-it-all-at-once habit probably
comes from buying music, where it’s okay to lug home a whole stack of CDs
from the store. You can listen to several CDs over the course of a few days.
They’re enjoyable the first time, and they age well. Software, on the other
hand, is gruesome the first day and can take months to come to grips with.
Have mercy on yourself at the checkout counter and buy software at a mod-
erate rate. Buy one package and figure out how to use it. Then, move on and
buy something else. You learn faster that way.
Buying Incompatible Hardware
Whoops! Did you forget to notice that the new keyboard you bought was for 
a Macintosh? Or, maybe you thought that you were getting a deal on that
FireWire scanner, and, lo, your PC doesn’t have a FireWire port. The biggest
disappointment: You buy a new AGP expansion card, and all you have avail-
able are PCI slots.
Always check your hardware before you buy it! Especially if you’re shopping
online — if you’re not sure that the hardware is compatible, phone the dealer
and ask those folks specifically.
Not Buying Enough Supplies
Buy printer paper in those big boxes. You will run out. Buy extra paper and a
variety of papers for different types of printing (drafts, color, high-quality,
and photo, for example). Buy a spool of 100 CD-Rs. Get a few extra media
cards. Keep extra printer ink cartridges on hand. You get the idea.
352
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Not Saving Your Work
Whenever you’re creating something blazingly original, choose the Save com-
mand and save your document to the hard disk. When you write something
dumb that you’re going to patch up later, choose the Save command too. The
idea is to choose Save whenever you think about it — hopefully, every few
minutes or sooner.
Save! Save! Save!
You never know when your computer will meander off to watch wrestling on
TV while you’re hoping to finish the last few paragraphs of that report. Save
your work as often as possible. And, always save it whenever you get up from
your computer — even if it’s just to grab a Fig Newton from the kitchen.
Not Backing Up Files
Saving work on a computer is a many-tiered process. First, save the work to
your hard drive as you create it. Then, at the end of the day, back up your
work to an external disk drive, a removable disk, such as a CD-R, or a flash
memory drive. Always keep a duplicate, safety copy of your work somewhere
because you never know.
At the end of the week (or month), run a backup program. I know that this
process is a pain, but it’s much more automated and easier to do than in
years past. I recommend checking out the Dantz Retrospect Backup software
and using it to back up your important stuff to a CD-R. You’ll be thankful!

Opening or Deleting Unknown Things
Computers have both hardware and software rules about opening or deleting
unknown items. On the software side, I have a rule:
Delete only those files or folders you created yourself.
353
Chapter 29: Ten Common Beginner Mistakes

Windows is brimming with unusual and unknown files. Don’t mess with ’em.
Don’t delete them. Don’t move them. Don’t rename them. And, especially,
don’t open them to see what they are. Sometimes opening an unknown icon
can lead to trouble.
On the hardware side, don’t open anything attached to your PC unless you
absolutely know what you’re doing. Some hardware is meant to open. New
console cases have pop-off and fliptop lids for easy access. They make
upgrading things a snap. If you open a console, remember to unplug it! It’s
okay to open your printer to undo a jam or install new ink or a toner car-
tridge. Even so, don’t open the ink or toner cartridges.
Other hardware items have Do Not Open written all over them: the monitor,
keyboard, and modem.
Trying to Save the World
Avoid that hero instinct! People new to PCs and fresh on e-mail somehow feel
emboldened that they’re personally responsible for the health, safety, and
entertainment of everyone else they know on the Internet. Let me be honest:
If you’re just starting out, be aware that those of us already on the Internet
have seen that joke. We have seen the funny pictures. We know the stories.
And, everyone has already sent us that e-mail saying that if you send it to
seven people you know, somehow Bill Gates will write you a check for $4,000.
Please don’t be part of the problem. Telling others about viruses and real
threats is one thing, but spreading Internet hoaxes is something else. Before
you send out a blanket e-mail to everyone you know, confirm that you’re
sending the truth. Visit a few Web sites, such as www.truthorfiction.com,
www.ciac.org/ciac/, and www.vmyths.com. If the message you’re spread-
ing is true, please include a few Web page links to verify it.
Thanks for being part of the solution, and not part of the problem!
Replying to Spam E-Mail
Don’t reply to any spam e-mail unless you want more spam. A popular trick is
for spammers to put some text that says “Reply to this message if you do not
want to receive any further messages.” Don’t! Replying to spam signals the
spammers that they have a “live one,” and you then get even more spam.
Never, ever, reply to spam!
354
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Opening a Program Attached 
to an E-Mail Message
You can receive photos via e-mail. You can receive sound files. You can
receive any types of documents. You can even receive zip file archives or
compressed folders. These files are all okay to receive. But, if you receive a
program (EXE or COM) file or a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file, do not open it!
The only way to get a virus on a PC is to run an infected program file. You can
receive the file okay. But, if you open it, you’re dead. My rule is “Don’t open
any EXE file you’re sent through e-mail.”
 Zip files (compressed folders) are okay to receive. You can open them
and see what’s in them. If they contain programs you’re unsure of, just
delete the whole deal. You’re safe.
 If you have to send a program file through e-mail, write or phone the
recipient in advance to let the person know that it’s coming.
 When in doubt, run antivirus software and scan the file before you open it.
 Some types of viruses can come in Microsoft Word documents. Antivirus
software may catch these viruses, but in any case, confirm that the sender
meant to send you the file before you open it.

Ten Things Worth Buying 
for Your PC
In This Chapter
 Mouse pad and wrist pad
 Antiglare screen

 More memory
 Larger, faster hard drive
 Ergonomic keyboard
 Uninterruptible power supply
 USB expansion card
 Scanner or digital camera
 Portable digital music player
I
’m not trying to sell you anything, and I’m pretty sure that you’re not
ready to burst out and spend, spend, spend on something — like another
computer (unless it’s someone else’s money). Still, there are some toys — or,
shall I say, companions — worthy of your PC’s company. Here’s the list of
items I recommend. Some are not that expensive, and I don’t sell any of them
on my own Web site!
Mouse Pad and Wrist Pad
If you have a mechanical (not optical) mouse, you need a mouse pad upon
which to roll it. Get one; the varieties are endless — plus, the mouse pad
ensures that you have at least one tiny place on your desktop that’s free of
clutter for rolling the mouse around.
A wrist pad fits right below your keyboard and enables you to comfortably
rest your wrists while you type. This product may help alleviate some 

repetitive-motion injuries that are common to keyboard users. Wrist pads
come in many exciting colors, some of which may match your drapery.
Antiglare Screen
Tawdry as it may sound, an antiglare screen is nothing more than a nylon
stocking stretched over the front of your monitor. Okay, they’re professional
nylons in fancy holders that adhere themselves to your screen. The result is
no garish glare from the lights in the room or outside. An antiglare screen is
such a good idea that some monitors come with them built-in.
Glare is the number-one cause of eyestrain while you’re using a computer.
Lights usually reflect in the glass, either from above or from a window. An
antiglare screen cuts down on the reflections and makes the stuff on your
monitor easier to see.
Some antiglare screens also incorporate antiradiation shielding. I’m serious:
They provide protection from the harmful electromagnetic rays spewing out
of your monitor even as you read this page! Is this necessary? No.
Keyboard Cover
If you’re klutzy with a coffee cup or have small children or spouses with peanut-
butter-smudged fingers using your keyboard, a keyboard cover is a great
idea. You may have even seen one used in a department store: It covers the
keyboard snugly, but still enables you to type. It’s a great idea because, with-
out a keyboard cover, all that disgusting gunk falls between the keys. Yech!
In the same vein, you can also buy a generic dust cover for your computer.
This item preserves your computer’s appearance, but has no other true
value. Use a computer cover only when your computer is turned off (and I
don’t recommend turning it off). If you put the cover on your PC while the PC
is turned on, you create a minigreenhouse, and the computer gets way too
hot and could melt. Nasty. This type of heat build-up doesn’t happen to the
keyboard, so the keyboard cover on all the time is okay — cool, in fact.
More Memory
Any PC works better with more memory installed. The upper limit on some
computers is something like 4GB of RAM, which seems ridiculous now, but
who knows about two years from now? Still, upgrading your system to 512MB
358
Part V: The Part of Tens 

or 1GB of RAM is a good idea. Almost immediately, you notice the improvement
in Windows and various graphics applications and games. Make someone
else do the upgrading for you; you just buy the memory.
Larger, Faster Hard Drive
Hard drives fill up quickly. The first time, it’s because you have kept lots of
junk on your hard drive: games, things people give you, old files, and old pro-
grams you don’t use any more. You can delete those or copy them to CD-Rs
for long-term storage. Then, after a time, your hard drive fills up again. The
second time, it has stuff you really use. Argh! What can you delete?
The answer is to buy a larger hard drive. If you can, install a second hard
drive and start filling it up. Otherwise, replace your first hard drive with a
larger, faster model. Buying a faster model is a great way to improve the per-
formance of any older PC without throwing it out entirely.
Ergonomic Keyboard
The traditional computer keyboard is based on the old typewriter keyboard
(the IBM Selectric, by the way). Why? It doesn’t have to be. No mechanics
inside the keyboard require the keys to be laid out in a staggered or cascad-
ing style. Repetitive typing on this type of keyboard can lead to various ugly
motion disorders (VUMDs).
To help you type more comfortably, you can get an ergonomic keyboard,
such as the Microsoft Natural Keyboard. This type of keyboard arranges the
keys in a manner that’s comfortable for your hands, keeping everything lined
up and not tweaked out, like on a regular computer keyboard.
Get a UPS
The uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a boon to computing anywhere in
the world where the power is less than reliable. Plug your console into the
UPS. Plug your monitor into the UPS. If the UPS has extra battery-backed-up
sockets, plug your modem into it too.
 Chapter 4 has information on using a UPS as well as using a power strip.
 Using a UPS doesn’t affect the performance of your PC. The computer
couldn’t care less whether it’s plugged into the wall or a UPS.

Chapter 30: Ten Things Worth Buying for Your PC

USB Expansion Card
USB is the thing to have for expanding your PC. If your computer lacks a USB
port, you can buy a USB expansion card.
My advice: Get a 4-port USB PCI card. (Sorry about all the acronyms and
jargon.) Four ports are plenty. I prefer the Belkin line of products. Refer to
Chapter 7 for more USB information.
Scanner or Digital Camera
Scanners and digital cameras are really the same thing, just in different boxes.
A scanner is a flat-bed-like device used for scanning flat things. A digital camera
is a portable scanner with a focused lens, which lets it “scan” things out in
the non-flat real world. Both gizmos do the same thing: Transfer some image
from the cold harshness of reality into the fun digital world of the computer.
If you already have a manual camera, getting a scanner is a great way to start
your computer graphics journey. You can easily scan in existing photos and,
after they’re digitized, store them in the computer or e-mail them off to
friends. (Refer to Chapter 28.)
Digital cameras are also great investments, though they’re more expensive
than scanners. The future of photography is digital, so buying one now or
later is probably on your list of things to do before you die.
Portable Digital Music Player
In case you haven’t heard or read it somewhere, the CD player is dead. In
fact, music pundits are saying that music CDs will soon be a thing of the past.
The next and final resting place for all your music will be your computer. The
portable extension of that music will be a digital music player, also known as
an MP3 player.
The most popular digital music player is the Apple iPod. Though the iPod is
an Apple product, it’s fully compatible with your PC, including the popular
iTunes music program. Other digital music players exist as well. Ensure that
the one you get has enough storage for all your music, is compatible with
your PC, and has a handy way of talking with the computer as well as
recharging its battery.

I
don’t consider myself a computer expert or genius or guru, though many
have called me all those names. I’m just a guy who understands how com-
puters work. Or, better than that, I understand how computer people think.
They may not be able to express an idea, but I can see what they mean and
translate it into English for you. Given that, here are some tips and sugges-
tions so that you and your PC can go off on your merry way.
Remember That You Control 
the Computer
You bought the computer. You clean up after its messes. You feed it CDs when
it asks for them. You control the computer — simple as that. Don’t let that
computer try to boss you around with its bizarre conversations and funny
idiosyncrasies. It’s really pretty dopey; the computer is an idiot.

If somebody shoved a flattened can of motor oil in your mouth, would you 
try to taste it? Of course not. But stick a flattened can of motor oil into a CD
drive, and the computer tries to read information from it, thinking that it’s a
CD. See? It’s dumb.
You control that mindless computer just like you control an infant. You must
treat it the same way, with respect and caring attention. Don’t feel that the
computer is bossing you around any more than you feel that a baby is boss-
ing you around during 3 a.m. feedings. They’re both helpless creatures, sub-
ject to your every whim. Be gentle. But be in charge.
Realize That Most Computer Nerds 
Love to Help Beginners
It’s sad, but almost all computer nerds spend most of their waking hours in
front of a computer. They know that it’s kind of an oddball thing to do, but
they can’t help it.
Their guilty consciences are what usually make them happy to help begin-
ners. By passing on knowledge, they can legitimize the hours they while away
on their computer stools. Plus, it gives them a chance to brush up on a social
skill that’s slowly slipping away: the art of talking to a person.
 Always be grateful when you’re given help.
 A great place to get help online is my Wambooli Forums, where real, live
nerds really do help beginners. See for yourself, at
http://forums.wambooli.com/
 Beware of Bogus Nerds. These people don’t love computers, but went to
some sort of school to learn a few by-rote tricks. They may not be help-
ful or know anything about computers, other than what they’re told. You
can detect Bogus Nerds because they lack the enthusiasm of True Nerds,
the ones who help you.
Use Antivirus Software
It’s a sad statement, but to really enjoy your computer, you have to invest 
in some antivirus software. You really need the protection such a program
offers — even if you’re careful. Every PC that’s running Windows and con-
nected to the Internet is at risk. There are no exceptions.
362
Part V: The Part of Tens 

I recommend Norton AntiVirus. It’s the leader of the pack and very efficient.
The McAfee virus protection program is also a good choice. But I don’t rec-
ommend Web-based antivirus scanners. Get a real program. Pay money for it.
If your data is important, it’s worth the cost.
 Yes, pay the money and buy the annual subscription to keep your
antivirus software up to date.
 Some antivirus programs come with other Internet security software as
well, including spyware protection and perhaps a firewall. Yes, those
things are worth the cost.
 There’s no need to run two antivirus (or spyware or firewall) programs
at once. One program is enough to do the job.
 For more information on nasty things that can happen to your PC and
how to prevent them, refer to one of my favorite books — because I
wrote it — Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Understand That Upgrading Software
Isn’t an Absolute Necessity
Just as the models on the cover of Vogue change their clothes each season
(or maybe I should say “change their fashions” each season), software com-
panies issue perpetual upgrades. Should you automatically buy the upgrade?
Of course not! If you’re comfortable with your old software, you have no
reason to buy the new version. None!
The software upgrade probably has a few new features in it (although you
still haven’t had a chance to check out all the features in the current version).
And, the upgrade probably has some new bugs in it too, making it crash in
new and different ways. Feel free to look at the box, just as you stare at the
ladies on the cover of Vogue. But don’t feel obliged to buy something you
don’t need.
Don’t Ever Reinstall Windows
A myth floating around tech-support sites says that the solution to all your
ills is to reinstall Windows. Some suspect tech-support people even claim
363
Chapter 31: Ten Tips from a PC Guru

that it’s common for most Windows users to reinstall at least once a year.
That’s rubbish.
You never need to reinstall Windows. All problems are fixable. It’s just that
the so-called tech-support people are lazy and resort to a drastic solution as
opposed to trying to discover what the true problem is. If you press them,
they will tell you what’s wrong and how to fix it.
In all my years of using a computer, I have never reinstalled Windows or had
to reformat my hard drive. It’s not even a good idea just to refresh the bits on
the hard drive or whatever other nonsense they dish up. There just isn’t a
need to reinstall Windows ever. Period.
Refer to my book Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies (Wiley) for all the 
various solutions you can try instead of reformatting your hard dive or 
reinstalling Windows.
Perfectly Adjust Your Monitor
I don’t have much explaining to do here. Keeping the monitor turned up too
brightly is bad for your eyes, and it wears out your monitor more quickly.
To adjust a CRT monitor to pink perfection, turn the brightness (the button
with the little sun) all the way up and adjust the contrast (the button with the
half moon) until the display looks pleasing. Then, turn the brightness down
until you like what you see. That’s it!
Unplug Your PC When You 
Upgrade Hardware
Newer PCs don’t have a flippable on-off switch, like the older models do.
When you open the case to upgrade or add an expansion card, your belly (if
it’s like my belly) may punch the power-on button, and, lo, you’re working in
a hazardous electrical environment. To prevent that, unplug the console
before you open it for upgrading.
You don’t need to unplug the console or even turn off the PC when you add a
USB or FireWire device. (You do need to unplug it if you add a USB expansion
card, however.)
364
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Subscribe to a Computer Magazine
Oh, why not? Browse the stacks at your local coffeehouse-slash-music-store-
slash-bookstore. Try to find a computer magazine that matches your tastes.
 One magazine that seems to be worthy for computer beginners is
SmartComputing. Look for it in a magazine stand near you.
 What sells me on a magazine are the columns and the newsy stuff they
put up front.
 Some magazines are all ads. That can be great if you like ads, or it can be
boring.
 Avoid the nerdier magazines, but I probably didn’t need to tell you that.
Shun the Hype
The computer industry is rife with hype. Even if you subscribe to a family-
oriented computer magazine, you still read about the latest this or the next-
biggest-trend that. Ignore it!
My gauge for hype is whether the thing that’s hyped is shipping as a standard
part of a PC. I check the ads. If they’re shipping the item, I write about it.
Otherwise, it’s a myth and may not happen. Avoid being lured by the hype.
 When hype becomes reality, you read about it in this book.
 Former hype I have successfully ignored: Pen Windows, push technology,
Web channels, Shockwave, Microsoft Bob, Windows CE, and tablet PCs.
 Hype that eventually became reality: USB, CD-R, shopping on the Web
(or e-commerce), DVD drives, digital cameras, and home networking.
Don’t Take It So Seriously
Hey, simmer down. Computers aren’t part of life. They’re nothing more than
mineral deposits and petroleum products. Close your eyes and take a few
deep breaths. Listen to the ocean spray against the deck on the patio; listen
to the gurgle of the marble Jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom.
365
Chapter 31: Ten Tips from a PC Guru

Pretend that you’re driving a convertible through a grove of sequoias on a
sunny day with the wind whipping through your hair and curling over your
ears. Pretend that you’re lying on the deck under the sun as the Pacific
Princess chugs south toward the islands with friendly, wide-eyed monkeys
that eat coconut chunks from the palm of your hand.
You’re up in a hot air balloon, swirling the first sip of champagne and feeling
the bubbles explode atop your tongue. Ahead, to the far left, the castle’s
spire rises through the clouds, and you can smell Chef Meisterbrau’s awaiting
banquet.
Then, slowly open your eyes. It’s just a dumb computer. Really. Don’t take it
too seriously.
