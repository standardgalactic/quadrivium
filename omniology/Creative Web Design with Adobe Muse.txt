Introduction
Why use Adobe Muse?
Not everyone has the aptitude for building websites using code alone. Typically, the design of 
the site will be created in Adobe Photoshop (or its equivalent), which is then handed over to 
the web developer to break down and reconstruct using HTML and CSS. Th is is fi ne if your 
budget supports it but, for many people, this is not an aff ordable option. Muse gives us the 
ability to build a site straight from the design concept.
Muse is a totally visual web-design tool. Th ere is no coding needed to put together fully 
functional websites. Everything is created in a drag and drop environment, Muse handles the 
code side of the operation, making the design and construction process a whole lot easier for 
those of us who think CSS is a cable TV channel and Javascript is the receipt you get at the 
coff ee shop. 
Th e visual approach used in Muse will be familiar to anyone who has used a desktop pub-
lishing application such as Quark, Adobe InDesign or even Microsoft  Publisher. Th e toolset 
in Muse is minimal and easy to get to grips with, even if you haven’t used similar applications. 
Th e fundamental page composition is created using either a text frame or a rectangle. Th e 
latter can be simple shapes fi lled with color, or contain images and even embedded HTML 
code for video and other rich content. Th e rest is determined by styling options and widgets: 
predefi ned slideshows, menus, forms and presentations.
Who is the book for?
Th e book is aimed at anyone using Muse for the fi rst time who wants to get stuck in and work-
ing from the outset. Rather than looking at the program’s features and commands individually, 
the content is project-based, taking you through the process of putting together a website 
from start to fi nish. It is, in fact, based on a working website I created for a local business, Th e 
Brighton Cake Company, so it is also testament to the program’s powerful capabilities. Th e live 
site can be found at www.brightoncakecompany.co.uk. 
Th ere may be diff erences between the version we’re creating here and the live version, this, 
of course, is one of the downsides of the static printed page versus the ever-evolving Internet. 
Any major design changes to the site or updates to Muse itself will be detailed on the book’s 
companion website.
Th ere may also be slight changes to some of the design elements used here, com-
pared to the live version, mainly for reasons of intellectual property and privacy but these 
will be few and far between and are, on the whole, inconsequential to the overall project.
How to use this book
Th e book is designed primarily to be worked through in a linear fashion, as it runs through 
from the basics of using Muse up to producing a fully working site. Th ink of it as a route-map, 
rather than an atlas; using only the tools and techniques required for the job at hand. It can, 
however, also be used as a reference book; the chapter intros give an overview of what we’ll 
be doing and there’s the index, of course. Th e format is laid out in a step-by-step style with a 
screen capture or illustration, along with a caption explaining what’s going on.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
Although I’ve attempted to incorporated as many of features of Muse as possible into the site 
to demonstrate them in context, there are a few that I simply could not shoehorn in without 
totally disrupting the design and some that were released too late during the writing of the 
book to be incorporated. For this reason I have placed a chapter at the end of the book with 
examples of using the features individually.
Keyboard shortcuts
Th roughout the book I use a mixture of menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to show 
how to switch tools and invoke the various features, as some people prefer using one or the 
other, or sometimes both. It is, however, worth learning the keyboard shortcuts as it can help 
immensely to speed up the workfl ow! 
Th e keyboard shortcuts are given for both the Mac and PC platforms where applicable. Th e 
format I use is the modifi er, Cmd and Opt for the Mac, Ctrl and Alt for the PC, followed by the 
associated keystroke. For example, invoking the Place command would be listed like so: File > 
Place (Cmd+D/Ctrl+D). If the keystroke is the same for both platforms, it is just shown in black, 
Shift, Tab, etc. Th is gives the commands a little more distinction from the rest of the text.
Accompanying website
All the necessary fi les for putting the example website together are available from the book’s 
accompanying website www.creativemu.se. Also, with Adobe’s soft ware subscription model, 
its applications are being updated far more regularly than before. I want to make sure you’re 
kept as up-to-date as possible, of course, so I’ll be posting details and tutorials about any new 
features and changes, along with any other signifi cant news, as and when they happen.

Introducing 
Adobe Muse

B
efore we jump in and start building our websites we’ll need to familiarize 
ourselves with Muse and its features. Much of the interface and toolset will 
be recognizable to you if you’ve used any of Adobe’s applications before. There 
are a few differences, of course. In this chapter we’ll take an overview of the 
application’s features.

The Welcome Screen
As with most of the Creative Cloud appli-
cations, when we fi rst launch Muse, the fi rst 
thing we see is the  Welcome screen.
On the left  we have the options to create a 
new site and also to open any recent sites we 
have been working on, this is empty at the 
moment, as we’re yet to create any.
On the right are links to online learning 
resources and to interact with the Muse 
community. Th ese all require an active 
Internet connection; as this is a web-design 
program, it’s highly likely you already have 
one of those, of course!
We can also choose to prevent the dialog from opening each time by checking the box in the bottom-left  corner. 
Th e dialog will remain visible until we choose an action but will no longer show when Muse is launched. Th is is 
personal preference, of course; I prefer not to have it showing. If you later decide you do want it showing, it can 
be toggled in the program preferences. It’s also possible to start new sites and open recent ones from the menus.
We’ll be approaching the program as though it has only just been installed. This way we start at the same level, 
regardless of your previous experience. It’s well worth following from the beginning, even if you have used the 
program before; there’s always something that you might have missed.
Creating a new site
Th e next step is to start off  our new site 
project. To do this we can click the Create 
New > Site button. Th is opens the  New Site 
dialog; we can also invoke this by  choosing 
Create New > Site if we opted to not display 
the welcome dialog.
Here we can choose the initial layout type 
from Desktop, Tablet or Phone. Each pre-
set has a default set of values based on the 
standard sizes for their respective devices. 
Th ese can also be set manually, of course 
and will not be overridden when reselect-
ing the preset.
We would generally have an idea of the 
layout beforehand and could set the values 
up now. For the purposes of this chapter, however, we’ll leave the 
dialog at its defaults; they can be edited at any time once we are 
in the main working area. Clicking OK takes us into the Plan mode. 
It’s also possible to bypass the dialog altogether by holding 
Opt/Alt when clicking the option to start a new site on the wel-
come dialog.

using the New 
Site dialog.

Plan mode is where the layout of the site is created and controlled. Th is has two sections, the site map at the top 
and the master page view at the bottom. When we create a new site, we always start with a Home page and a Master 
page (named A-Master by default). If you’ve worked with Adobe InDesign, the concept of master pages will be 
familiar; these generally contain the site assets that are going to be consistent across the site. Th ese will oft en be 
the header and footer components, site navigation and background color or pattern. Many sites will only need one 
master, whereas others may have several, depending on the design. It’s also possible to create master pages that 
inherit only certain traits of their peers, such as the footer elements, giving us more design options, whilst keeping 
the overall theme and ease of use.
We can open several sites at once, they appear as tabs at the top of the workspace. Th is can be useful if we want to 
copy previously used elements from one site to another. Do bear in mind that this may decrease the performance 
of the program.
Once we start creating pages, we can choose the order in which they appear, add and remove pages and also 
organize the pages at diff erent levels to create a hierarchy; Muse can automatically generate the site navigation 
based on this layout. All this will become clear as we progress through the chapters.
 Master page indicators
The blue labels display the currently assigned master page on the 
site pages, and the inherited master(s) for the master pages.

Design mode
 Design mode is where the page building happens. All text, images and special content (Photoshop buttons, rectan-
gles, widgets, and embedded HTML) is created here. To open a page into this view, we double-click its thumbnail 
in the Plan mode. Th e screenshot below shows a master page in the workspace.
Unlike other Creative Cloud programs, the toolset in Muse is minimal and resides at the top of the window, 
rather than being within the workspace itself. Below the toolbar is the Control panel. Th is displays the settings and 
options relating to the currently selected object in the design. 
Just below the Control Panel is the tab area. As with the Plan mode, we can have several pages open at once, each 
being represented by a tab with the page title. In Muse, windows cannot be separated from the tab bar, as they can 
in other applications.
Th e main workspace has three areas. Th e lighter gray area is the application background. Th e darker gray repre-
sents the browser fi ll: the area around the page content that stretches to fi ll the window when the page is viewed in 
the web browser. Th e white area is the page or master page content. 
Around the workspace are the rulers, the measurements are in pixels. Th e rulers can be toggled on and off  from 
the View menu and the View Options menu in the Control panel, or by right-clicking on the rulers themselves.
Th e large fl oating dock on the right contains panels with the settings for each tool and object. Some mirror those 
available in the Control panel and top-level menus, others can only be accessed from the panel. Th e individual 
panels can be moved between sections in the dock and toggled on or off  but cannot be dragged out independently. 
Th e whole dock can be collapsed down to a single column of icons to free up space.

Preview mode
Preview mode displays the currently active 
page rendered as it will appear in the browser. 
Everything works as  it should, including site 
navigation and any externally referenced page 
content such as embedded video. 
Th e initial page generation can be a little 
slower than it is when viewed in a browser, par-
ticularly when navigating the site for the fi rst 
time or if the content has changed since the last 
view. Subsequent previews will be much faster.
Publish mode
Technically, this is not a window view and is 
only applicable to Muse trial sites and if you 
choose to fully host the site through Adobe.
A standalone Muse subscription comes with 
one trial site, subscription to the full Creative 
Cloud edition has fi ve sites.
When selected, a dialog appears with the 
existing live or trial site details, or the option 
to create a new site. Once published, the live 
version of the trial site is displayed in a new 
browser window.
Manage
Again, this is only available for trial sites and 
live sites hosted by Adobe. Clicking the Man-
age option opens a browser window and logs 
in to the  Muse Dashboard.
Th is gives you access to, amongst other 
things, hosting details such as space and band-
width use, site reports and also access to the 
in-browser editing system.

Designing the 
master page

W
e’re ready to start designing the website. Before we begin, however, we’ll 
need to have an idea of not only what it’s going to look like but also

Designing the master page
Planning the site
The initial site layout
It’s likely that your client may already have a website, as was the case with Th e Brighton Cake Company; they had 
used one of the many online out-of-the-box services (Figs. 1, 2 & 3). Whilst this meant that they could quickly 
have a presence on the web without having a site professionally built for them, these online resources can oft en be 
restrictive in the way they are put together. What it meant, however, is we had something to work with at the start 
of the process. Th is is good because, as designers, we can get a feel of how the client wants the color schemes and 
general content. We won’t always have this luxury, of course!
fi g 1. Th e landing page
fi g 2. Product gallery
fi g 3. Information about the company’s 
wedding cake service.
As with any type of design, communication between the designer and their client is paramount. This ensures that 
he or she is getting the site they want but are also aware of the limitations of what is possible, either within Muse 
or more generally on the web itself.
Once we have an idea of the basic structure and the colors the client wants, we can move on to putting our new 
site together. Th e fi rst step is generally to sketch out a rough idea on paper – oft en the back of an envelope – before 
we transcribe it onto something more formal to show the client. Th is is the  wire-frame model. Th e site’s layout is 
represented as a series of boxes, sometimes drawn freehand but more oft en placed on a grid. 
If, like me, your freehand drawing skills are lacking, there are many applications available to aid the wireframing 
process. Th ere are many free web-based and desktop tools out there. You could also use Muse itself to create the 
wireframe mock-ups, of course.
Once the wire-frame has been defi ned, a more complex preview can be created, most likely in a graphics appli-
cation such as Adobe Photoshop. Th is time we would be using draft  versions of images and proper text, whether 
that’s Lorem Ipsum place-holder text or the actual text being used for the site. Th is enables color schemes and 
typefaces to be tested out in readiness to create the fi nal version.

13
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
Normally, at this stage, we would slice up the fl at design and pass the images over to a web-developer to code 
everything in to the working site. Not with Muse at hand, of course. Once we have our images we can start building 
the site straight onto the page. If you have Photoshop CC, it’s well worth using its Generator feature to output the 
images. It’s far easier than using the traditional slice tool.
Sketching on graph paper makes it easier to transfer 
the design to the grid-based web layout.
Muse can be used as a wireframing tool as well!

The  site properties
With the basis of the site design drawn out 
and translated into its component images 
we can begin to construct it in Muse. As 
we saw in the introduction, we can do this 
either from the welcome screen or from 
within  the program by selecting New Site 
from the File menu (shortcut: Cmd+N/
Ctrl+N). Th is opens the  New Site dialog.
Th e content in our site design has been 
made to the standard 960 pixel width, so we 
can leave the dimensions at their defaults; 
the height can be controlled visually once 
we’re in the design module. It’s worth not-
ing at this stage that the width and height 
settings only determine the width of the 
content area, not the entire site.
Below the page dimensions is the  Sticky 
Footer option. Th is prevents the footer 
from fl oating up the page where the brows-
er’s height is greater than the page content. 
Th is is especially useful when setting up 
the site for mobile devices as it maintains 
a uniform layout. Th e option can be set 
independently for each version of the site, if 
we need the pages to behave diff erently on 
each. Generally, we’d leave it enabled. 
We’ll set the number of columns to 3, 
as this suits our layout. As we do, Muse 
automatically sets the  column width in 
accordance to the width of the page and the 
size of the  gutter. Th e default 20 pixel gut-
ter is a little wide, so we’ll drop that to 15. 
Again, Muse updates the column width.
Th e margins, as in most publishing appli-
cations, determine the off set amount of the 
content relative to the page width. Th is 
won’t be evident in our design as the con-
tent is fl oating on the background and can 
be left  at the default of 20 pixels. Be more 
mindful of the margins when designing 
sites with a page content background that’s 
diff erent to the browser fi ll.
Save your work!
Now would be a good time to save our new site. From 
the File Menu choose Save. We’ll name it Brighton Cake 
Co.muse. It’s also worth noting that Muse autosaves as 
we progress, so if the program crashes, or there’s a pow-
er-cut, we will rarely lose too much of our work. It’s also good practice 
to manually save as we go along, just in case!
 Padding determines how much space is left  
between the top and bottom of the browser 
window, again, we’ll leave this at the 
defaults.  Center Horizontally makes sure 
the content is in the middle of the browser 
at all times.
Now we have the basics of the layout set 
up, we can click OK accept the settings and 
close the New Site dialog. We’re now taken 
into the Plan mode where we can begin set-
ting up the default master page and start 
working on the content.
960px is a good width 
for a basic website.
Designing the master page
Preparing the new site
!

15
When we fi rst enter the  Plan mode in Muse, 
it looks a little sparse. We have a single 
thumbnail representing the  Home page in 
the site layout area and an, as yet, undefi ned 
master page. Th e default master is named 
A-Master and is applied to the home page 
(denoted by the blue label below the page 
name). Neither pages have any content 
at the moment, so they appear blank. Th e 
order in which we start working on the 
site depends on personal preference. I tend 
to start by setting up the master page ele-
ments, this gives me a better feel of how the 
pages will look before I move on to creating 
the site layout. You may decide to do this 
the other way round. Th ere is no right or 
wrong approach.
 To start editing the page, double-click its 
thumbnail. Th is brings us into the  Design 
mode. Th is will look familiar to anyone 
who’s used a desktop publishing applica-
tion. Th e page content is represented by the 
rectangle in the center, as we would expect 
to fi nd with a print-design layout. We can 
see the guides and margins we set up in the 
New Site dialog. 
Th ere’s one big diff erence between a 
layout in Muse and a traditional DTP 
application. Muse uses a fl exible layout: 
we can adjust the size of the page and the 
distance between the page and the top and 
bottom of the browser window. Th is can 
be done initially within the master page 
to set the site standard but can be altered 
on a page-by-page basis to suit the con-
tent of each. All this is done visually by 
dragging the horizontal guides on the left  
of the window. We’ll  look at this in more 
detail as we progress through the chapter.

Th e default browser fi ll is an drab shade of 
gray. To change this, go to the Control Panel 
at the top of the window and click  Browser 
Fill. Th is opens the Browser Fill options 
panel.  Currently it’s set to a solid fi ll. We 
also have the option to use a gradient. Th is 
site uses a graphic background fi ll. Click 
the folder icon next to where it says Image. 
A fi le browser dialog opens. Navigate to 
where you saved the assets for the chapter. 
Select the light-stripes.jpg fi le. Click Open.
Th e   Fitting type is already set to Tile in the 
example, this fi lls the background with an 
image that tiles both horizontally and ver-
tically. Th is is what we need here but we 
have several other options to choose from, 
depending on the layout we want: 

O  Original size displays the image you 
select once on the page at its original 
dimensions, and aligns the image based 
on the selected Position option.

O  Tile Horizontally repeats the image in a 
single row across the page. Its alignment 
is defi ned by the Position selector.

O  Tile Vertically does the same as Tile 
Horizontally but creates a single column 
of tiled images.

O  Scale To Fit displays the chosen image 
proportionally to fi t the browser back-
ground. Th is can result in gaps around 
the image, depending on its ratio and 
starting position. 

O  Scale To Fill displays the chosen image 
so it always fi lls the browser background. 
Areas around the edges of the image may 
be clipped, so it’s important that nothing 
of importance is placed there.
Th e Scrolling option at the bottom of the 
panel determines whether the background 
image will scroll with the page if it’s too 
large for the browser window, or remain 
fi xed, while the page content scrolls above 
it. With a patterned background like this, 
we can leave it checked. Fixed backgrounds 
can aff ect the site’s performance, particu-
larly with photographs and large amounts 
of page content.
You can choose how 
your background

 `Here’s how the page looks so far. We now 
have the striped background fi lling the 
browser fi ll area, with the white page area 
in the center; this won’t be fi lled in the fi nal 
version but we’ll keep it solid for now, as it 
acts as a guide to assist with the alignment 
of the page elements.
 `Th ere are two control guides at the top 
of the workspace. Th is fi rst guide sets the 
 top of the page. Th is sets the amount of 
space between the top of the visible con-
tent and the edge of the browser window 
area (where we see the browser fi ll in our 
design). Th e default is 36px – as it was set 
in the padding section of the site properties 
– which is enough breathing space, so we’ll 
leave it where it is.
'HˉQHWKHKHDGHU
Now we’ll set the    Header guide to defi ne the 
area where the header elements be placed. 
Th e height of header design is 200px and 
we’ll need a margin between the header and 
the page content. Drag the guide down to 
220px. Th is gives us an initial gap of 20px. 
We can always alter it at a later time, of 
course; Muse will automatically shift  the 
content of the pages accordingly. 

18

Add the header images
Choose File >   Place (keyboard shortcut 
Cmd+D/Ctrl+D). Again, this will be famil-
iar to InDesign users. A fi le dialog opens 
up. Browse to the Chapter 2 Assets folder 
and select logo.png. Click Open. Th is has 
loaded the  Place tool with the fi rst part of 
our header graphic. We can see a small rep-
resentation of it hanging off  the cursor. Th e 
dotted right-angle on the left  of the cursor 
represents the top corner of the image to be 
placed. Th is helps us to position the graphic 
element if it’s an irregular shape.
 `Click once to set the image down; this 
places our logo graphic at full size. Click 
inside the image’s bounding box with the 
Selection tool (V). Drag the image up to 
the top of the content area until it snaps 
into place; the horizontal guide turns red to 
show it’s aligned to the top of the page. 
Now drag it toward the center of the page. 
When we hit dead center we not only see a 
red guide to tell us we are at the center, we 
also see these two blue bars with pixel val-
ues. Th ese indicate that the object is equally 
positioned between two other objects – the 
center column guides in this instance.
 `Next we’ll add the ribbon graphic that will 
eventually hold the site’s main navigation 
menu. 
Go to File > Place. Select the fi le ribbon.
png to load it into the Place tool. Click once 
as we did before to set it down at full size 
on the page. Again, don’t worry about the 
positioning at the moment, we’ll be looking 
at a quick way to align objects in the next 
section.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
The alignment tools
We’re going to align the ribbon to the logo. 
Grab the Selection tool if it’s not already 
active. Click once on the logo image. Now 
hold down the Shift key and click the rib-
bon image. Release Shift. Both items are 
now selected. It’s important that we do this 
in the correct order.
 `Go to the Control panel. Click Align to 
open the  Alignment options panel – the 
same options are also available in the 
docked panel set. We have the usual align-
ment tools available to us. Before we start, 
however, we need to tell Muse what we 
want the objects to align to – the logo in 
this instance.
Click the Align to button to open its 
options. Select Align to Key Object. Th e 
key object is the fi rst item in a multi-se-
lection, hence the importance of selecting 
the objects in order. A heavy dotted frame 
appears around the logo.
 `Click the  Align Horizontal Centers button 
in the  Align Objects section of the Align-
ment options panel. Th e ribbon snaps into 
place, in line with the logo.
 `Now click the  Align Vertical Centers but-
ton to bring the ribbon up to the center of 
the logo. We can deselect the objects now 
by clicking away from them on the page, or 
by going to Edit > Deselect All.

20

 `Finally, for this stage of the design, we 
need to change the order of the objects to 
bring the logo in front of the ribbon. Click 
the logo image to select it again. Now go to 
Object > Bring to Front. We can also right-
click and choose Arrange > Bring to Front 
in the menu that appears.
Build the footer
Th e footer is where the company’s brief 
mission statement appears, as well as at-a-
glance contact details and social media 
links. We’ll start by increasing the min-
imum page size: drag the   Bottom of Page 
guide down to 650px. Th is will give us 
some breathing space when it comes to 
building the page content. 
The Rectangle tool
Grab the Rectangle tool (M). Position the 
cursor on the intersection of the far left  of 
the browser area (not the page edge) and 
the Bottom of page guide. Click and drag 
out a frame with a height of 210px over to 
the right of edge the browser area. As we 
hit the right edge we see a red guide appear. 
Th is denotes that the rectangle will always 
display at 100% width; the live guide display 
also shows this.
 `Next, we’ll set the color of the footer rec-
tangle. We’ll be using the same color as the 
header ribbon so make sure it’s visible in the 
window. Open the   Fill options. Click the 
 Fill Color swatch to open the color picker. 
Click the Sample Color tool. Now click on 
the header ribbon to sample its color.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Th e color is a little strong and could be 
distracting. We could choose a lighter ver-
sion of the color, of course, but I decided 
to reduce the Opacity instead. Set the  Fill 
Opacity to 50. Th is gives us a soft er pastel 
shade and allows a little of the background 
texture to show through as well. Close the 
panel by clicking the Fill link again.
 `Rectangles in Muse always have a 1 pixel 
black stroke set by default. We don’t need it 
here. We can do this by setting the Stroke 
value to 0.
 `Now let’s create the decorative divider. 
Make sure the  Rectangle tool is selected. 
Drag out a rectangle from one side of the 
browser area to the other as before, mak-
ing sure the red guides appear to denote it’s 
100% width. Set the height to 21px.
 `Grab the Selection tool (V). Hold Shift to 
constrain the direction of movement. Now 
click and drag the rectangle down until it 
snaps into place above the box we just cre-
ated. Th e red guide we can see here is where 
the rectangle is straddling the Footer guide.
 `Now we’ll style the divider. Open the Fill 
options on the Control panel. Click the 
image folder to show the fi le dialog. Select 
the dot.jpg fi le. 
Although the rectangle is the same height 
as the graphic, we’ll set the  Fitting to  Tile 
Horizontal. Th is way, if we decide to make 
the band wider at any point, we’ll still only 
get one row of dots. We can leave the posi-
tion pin where it is. As before, we also need 
to remove the default stroke by setting its 
value to 0.

22

Create the footer content
Our fi rst text frame is going to be the com-
pany’s brief introduction. Grab the   Text 
tool (shortcut: T). Position the cursor on 
the left -hand page margin, a little way down 
from the divider – around the same distance 
as is between the Bottom of Page guide and 
the base of the content area. Click and drag 
the bounding box out to meet the opposite 
corner of the fi rst column; it should snap 
into place as we near it. Release the mouse 
to set the text frame in place.
 `Th e text for the fi rst panel in the footer is 
in the chapter’s Assets folder (About us.rtf). 
Open it up in TextEdit or Notepad. Copy 
the text to the clipboard. Now go back to 
Muse. Click the cursor inside the fi rst text 
frame. Now go to Edit > Paste to populate 
the box. We need to style the text, of course. 
As we’ll see in the next section, Muse gives 
us a lot of control over the formatting of 
text on the page. 
 `Before we move on to adding the footer 
content, we need to make a couple of fi nal 
adjustments. We need to move the  Footer 
guide up to include a margin area, as we did 
with the header. Th e top of the divider is at 
427px. Move the guide up to 408px to give 
us the same 20 pixel margin as the header.
 `We also have some space below the footer. 
Th is means there will be a gap between the 
footer and the bottom of the browser win-
dow. Drag the  Bottom of browser guide up 
to meet the   Bottom of Page guide.

Select the Text panel from the docked panel 
set. Th e fi rst thing we’ll look at is the font 
options. Click the drop-down menu at the 
top. Here, the list of typefaces is broken 
down into three categories. 
 Web Safe fonts are installed by default 
on every computer platform, so it’s 
assumed that if you use a typeface from 
this set, it will be rendered the same for 
everyone visiting the website. Th e prob-
lem with this is we don’t have much in 
the way of variety, so the design options 
are fairly limited. 
 System fonts installed on your com-
puter. Whilst they can all be used in 
your Muse designs, there’s no guaran-
teed that the visitor will have the font 
installed and it may be substituted for 
a diff erent typeface. Th is can ruin the 
site’s layout. For this reason, when sys-
tem fonts are used, they’re converted to 
images when you publish the site. Th is 
keeps the design true to the original 
but can result in slower loading times 
if they’re used liberally, not to mention 
the detrimental eff ect to search-engine 
ranking; image-based text won’t be read 
by search engines. You should also avoid 
system fonts where text might need 
to be selected and copied by the user, 
such as addresses and phone numbers. 
If you do need to use a system font, it’s 
best to keep it minimal for headings.
 Web fonts have been created to over-
come the limitations of the two previous 
methods of using text on the web. Rather 
than being installed on the computer, 
web fonts are downloaded when the 
page is opened and cached so we can 
create rich typography-oriented sites 
that are rendered in real-time.

Styling text
As well as the fonts themselves, Muse has 
many design-based layout features for text. 
Th ere are the usual size, weight and style 
settings, along with the alignment options, 
including Align Justifi ed. We also have 
great positional control with tracking, lead-
ing, fi rst line indent, space before and aft er 
and indent options.
We also have the option to create para-
graph and character styles. Th is gives us 
much greater control, as we can change the 
style of headings and body text once and 
have the changes refl ected right across the 
site. Styles can also be set to use web stand-
ard features such as heading tags for search 
engine optimization and additional format-
ting options like subscript and superscript 
and other such display styles. We’ll be look-
ing at these features in more depth later on 
in the book.
 `Now we have an overview of using type, 
let’s apply styling to the text we just added. 
We’ll start off  by adjusting the heading. 
Highlight the words About Us. We’ll be 
using the web-standard Georgia typeface 
for the footer, so select it from the font 
menu – I’m using the settings in the docked 
panels here but, as before, we could also use 
the font options in the Control panel. I’ve 
set the size to 18pt and the weight to bold.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Next we’ll set the color of the text. For 
this we’ll use the chocolate brown from 
the company logo. Scroll up or zoom out if 
you can’t currently see the header graphic. 
Click on the color swatch to open the color 
picker. Use the Sample Color tool to select 
the brown from the logo.
 `Whilst we have the picker open, we can 
create a new swatch preset. Th is will save 
time when we need to use this color else-
where in the site and will also enable us to 
change every instance where the color is 
used in a single action.
Click the New Swatch icon in the bot-
tom-right corner to create a new swatch. 
At present it’s named with the color value. 
We can change this. Double-click the new 
swatch to open the Swatch Options dialog. 
Click into the Swatch Name fi eld. Type in 
Chocolate Brown. As we do, the Name with 
Color value box is automatically unchecked. 
Click OK to save the changes. Th is will 
make it easier to fi nd later on. Th e swatch 
preset is site-wide so the new color will be 
available for other design elements, too.
 `Th e last bit of styling we’ll do to the head-
ing is to add a buff er space below to give it 
a little separation from the body text. We’ll 
do this by adjusting the  Space After setting 
in the Text panel. A value of 8px is adequate 
here; the body text below is pushed down so 
there’s no need to create a separate text box 
to achieve the same result.

26
 `Now for the body text. As with the head-
ing, we’ll start by selecting the whole of the 
text. Go back to the Text panel. Th e list in 
the font menu now has an additional sec-
tion titled Recently Used Fonts. As we’ve 
only used Georgia so far, it’s the only one 
showing up. Click it to apply the typeface to 
the selected text. 
 `Th e color will be the same as the header. 
We can now pick it from the Swatch panel. 
Select the  Chocolate Brown preset we cre-
ated earlier in the chapter.
2
 `Th e default font size of 14px suits the text 
here so we’ll leave it there. We can add a 
hard return to create a separate paragraph 
for the bottom line of the text, just to make 
it cleaner.
Create a paragraph style
Before we move on to the rest of the footer 
content, we can take a look at creating para-
graph styles based on the text we’ve already 
created. First let’s set a style for the header.
Highlight the header text again; it doesn’t 
need to be the whole line, as we’re only sam-
pling the styling we used.
Open the  Paragraph Styles panel; if it’s 
not visible, choose Window > Paragraph 
Styles to display it. Currently the only  
entry is the default [None] item. Click the 
 New Style icon in the bottom-right cor-
ner. A new entry named Paragraph Style 
appears in the list.

 `Obviously we need to change the name to 
something a little more descriptive; it might 
be the only style we have now but aft er 
designing a sites, we could very easily have 
dozens of diff erent styles defi ned.
Double-click on the new style to open 
the  Style Options dialog box. Here we can 
change the style name and set the paragraph 
tag. For now, we’ll only set the name. Footer 
Headings is a decent enough description. 
Th e rest of the dialog shows us the style 
details. We can see the associated size, 
color, font and the Space Aft er setting we 
applied. Th is is information only and can-
not be edited.
Click OK to save the name change. Now 
repeat the process using a sample of the 
body text. We can call this Footer Body,  in 
line with our naming convention.
 `Create another text frame aligned to the 
top of the previous frame. Drag the side 
handles until they snap to the center col-
umn guides to set the width. Open up the 
fi le Contact Us.rtf. Copy the contents into 
the new frame as we did before. Th e squig-
gly red lines under words that are seen as 
potential spelling errors highlighted by the 
built-in spell-checker. Highlight the Con-
tact Us heading. Go over to the Paragraph 
Styles panel. Click the Footer Headings 
style. Th is applies the same attributes as the 
previous heading. We can select the tele-
phone number and the email and apply the 
Footer Body style.

28
We can make the email address a hyperlink, 
of course. Select just the email address. Go 
to the Edit menu and select Copy (or press 
). Muse will automatically 
check to see if it can resolve the address 
from an internal site link. If it can’t fi nd one, 
it asks us to press Enter and it will generate a 
new external link.
 Muse has recognized that we are creating 
an email link and has added the necessary 
HTML  mailto prefi x to enable browsers to 
launch the computer’s default mail client 
when the link is clicked. We have a problem, 
however; although the link’s typeface has 
been retained, Muse has used the default 
link colors – bright blue for an unvisited 
link, – overriding our custom paragraph 
style. We’ll need to create a new link style 
for email links.
 Like paragraph and character styles, 
hyperlink styles are set globally. Curiously, 
however, they are not found alongside the 
others. Instead we need to open the  Hyper-
link Options panel in the Control panel and 
click the  Edit Link Styles button. We can 
make the same changes by choosing File 
> Site Properties and clicking the Content 
tab.

Here’s the  Content panel open in the  Site 
Properties window. Currently we only see 
the default style and its associated settings. 
We’ll leave that as it is. Click the New Style 
icon just below the styles list. We now have 
an entry named [Default Link Style] copy. 
Th is is misleading as it’s not a copy, it’s a new 
style. We can rename this by double-click-
ing the name. Name it Footer Email. 
 Let’s look at the settings we have to control 
the link appearance in more detail. Th ere 
are four potential states. Th e fi rst is  Normal. 
Th is determines how the link appears on 
the page, without the visitor having hovered 
over it or previously visited it. 
Th e fi rst setting is the link state’s color. 
Th is opens the color picker. We’ll make 
it a slightly darker brown so it stands out 
without being too blatant: the swatch 
next to our custom swatch is good.
Th e next setting determines if the link 
is bold or not. Th is has three states. Th e 
default, denoted by a square, is to use 
the existing styling of the original text. 
Clicking on it gives us a check mark. 
Th is means the link will always be bold, 
regardless of the original styling. Click-
ing again clears the box. Th is tells Muse 
never to make the link bold. Generally, 
we’ll stick with the default setting of 
inheriting the original style.
Following on we have settings to make 
the text to italics and to set its underline 
styling. Again, these each have the same 
three options as the bold state. We’ll 
leave the italics set to inherit. Th e default 
setting for the underline style is to always 
underline, which we’ll use here.

 `Now we have styled the Normal state, we can go through the rest 
of the settings to fi nish off  the custom link style. Next in the list is 
the   Hover state. Th is, as we would expect, determines how the link 
will appear when a visitor hovers their cursor over it. We’ll keep 
our email link simple by setting the Hover style to the same color as 
before but take away the underline so it’s visibly doing something 
when the cursor is over it. To do this, we click once on the under-
line setting.
 `Th e next state is  Visited. For standard page links it’s useful to set 
a diff erent style for this, as it lets the visitor know that they have 
previously used the link. For mail links, however, it’s not really nec-
essary. We’ll set the styling the same as the Normal state, so we just 
need to change the color.
 `Th e fi nal state is  Active. Th is determines the appearance of the link 
when it’s clicked. As it’s only seen in one instance, let’s make it a little 
more noticeable. I’ve sampled the Mint Green from the row of dots 
in the footer – it’s a good time to create another custom swatch, too 
– as that will be a good contrasting accent to show the visitor they’ve 
clicked the link. I’ve also turned the underline off  to match the 
hover state.
 `Click OK to save the changes. Although we had the email selected 
when we created the new style, it hasn’t been applied because Muse 
doesn’t know we wanted it assigned to the link. To do this, go back 
to the Hyperlink Options in the Control panel. Click the  Text Link 
Style drop-down and choose the new Footer Email style. 
Be careful with your styles!
It’s tempting to want to drastically change the appearance of the different link states by making them italic or 
bold, or both. Remember that in doing so, you are increasing the size of the type, so it may well force both the 
link and any surrounding elements onto a new line, which isn’t at all pretty!

Links don’t need to be text-based, of course, they can be applied to almost any of the design elements in Muse; 
we’ll be seeing this in action later in the book. The next part of the project is to add some social media buttons 
into the contact section. Muse has a great feature for doing this called Place Photoshop Button. This allows us to

Working with Photoshop buttons
We’ll start by creating the Facebook button. Go to File >   Place 
Photoshop Button or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+B/Ctrl+B. A 
fi le dialog opens. Browse to the Chapter 2 assets folder. Find the 
Facebook.psd fi le. Click Open. Instead of giving us an image on the 
Place gun as we had when we added graphic elements before, the 
Photoshop Import Options dialog box appears.
Th e PSD fi le has four layers, each of which can be assigned to a 
particular link state; the drop-down menus next to each state show 
us the names of the layers. I’ve used the same colors for the Rollover 
and Mouse Down states as we set for the email link. Th e Normal 
and Active states are the same as we need it to show the correct 
colors by default. Click OK to apply  and close the dialog.
 `We’re back to the standard Place gun with the Facebook button 
loaded. I’ve saved the buttons at their correct size so we can click 
once underneath the text to add it to the page. I’ve left  a reasonable 
margin between the text and the buttons here. Th e edge of the icon 
is aligned the left  side to the edge of the text frame. Repeat the pro-
cess for the Twitter and Pinterest buttons. We can use the Spacing 
guides to make sure the buttons are equally distributed.
 `We need to tell Muse where these buttons will link to, of course! 
We’ll start with the Pinterest button, as it’s currently selected. Th e 
URLs are listed in the Social Media Links.rtf fi le in the Chapter 2 
assets folder. Select the link text and copy it to the clipboard. Now 
go up to the Control panel and click the Hyperlink drop-down. 
Paste the Pinterest link in to assign it to the button. Repeat this for 
Facebook and Twitter buttons.
Open the Hyperlink options in the Control panel. Enable the 
option Open the link in a new window or tab; this ensures that the 
visitor doesn’t leave the site. We can also add some tooltip text. Th is 
appears when you hover over the button. Something like Find us on 
Facebook!, Twitter, etc.

decorative font; it’s a good opportunity to take a look at working with the   web fonts available to us through the 
Muse and Creative Cloud subscription.
Working with Web Fonts
Select the   Text tool. Draw out a text frame 
at the bottom of the fi nal column, spanning 
its entire width. Click  Add Web Fonts in the 
font menu of the Text panel. A new window 
appears, it may take a short time to populate 
at fi rst as it needs to create the cached list 
of fonts.
At the top of the window is the fi lter bar. 
Here we can narrow down the list of fonts 
by name; this is a wildcard search, so terms 
like Script, Regular, etc. all work. We can 
also narrow the list by category. Next we 
have two buttons: the fi rst displays type-
faces for headings, the second is for body 
text. Th e check mark at the end fi lters the 
font or fonts that are currently selected.
 `To add the font, Alex Brush in this instance, 
simply click the entry in the main window 
and click OK. A message appears to tell you 
that it’s been added to the Web Fonts menu 
(this can be turned off  if it becomes annoy-
ing). Open the font list again and there’s our 
chosen font ready to use. Click the entry to 
make it the active font.
 `Go to the Text panel. Set the font size to 
35. Open the Swatch presets and select the 
Chocolate Brown preset. We want the slogan 
to butt against the right of the frame, so set 
the Alignment to Right by clicking its but-
ton. Now we can type in the slogan: Cakes 
made with love x.
Nudge the text frame with the Selection 
tool by pressing Left and Right Arrow keys, 
so the slogan is sitting on the very bottom of 
the text frame.

should really add some more pages to our site plan. We can also take the opportunity to see how the master will 
look when viewed as a web page. Just in case anything goes awry, save the site before we move on (we’ve also 
been doing this periodically during the design process, of course!).
Preview the page
Click the  Preview mode button at the top of 
the Muse window. A progress bar appears as 
it gathers the components together in order 
to render them as a working web page. Th is 
may take a little while the fi rst time as it has 
to cache the components; subsequent pre-
view renders will be a lot faster, depending 
on how much is changed in between. We 
can see how the footer extends to fi ll the 
width of the browser. It looks a little odd as 
we still have the white content but we’ll be 
removing that.
Add new pages
Go back to the Plan mode. We can see the 
Home page thumbnail has now updated to 
refl ect the work we’ve done on the master 
design. We’ll add some more pages to the 
site, based on the draft  layout.
Hover over the Home page thumbnail. 
We see three plus signs and a cross appear 
around it. Th e plus signs give us the option 
to add pages to the left , right or below the 
currently selected page, the cross, as you’d 
expect, will delete the page.
Th e position in the Plan mode determines 
how the pages appear on the navigation 
menus by default, this can be overridden, 
of course. We’ll add a new page to the right 
by clicking the right-hand button. Th e new 
page automatically assumes the design 
of the master page. Th e page title is high-
lighted so we’ll change it to Our Cakes, as 
this will be the fi rst page in the menu.

Add a navigation bar
Go back to the Design mode so we can 
carry on editing the master page. Go to the 
docked panels. Select the  Widget Library 
panel. We can see fi ve main categories. 
Click the arrow next to the Menus item to 
open the list if it’s not already visible. We 
have two options:  Horizontal and Vertical.
Click and drag the Horizontal menu 
widget over to the page. Don’t worry about 
the positioning for now, we just needed to 
place it on the design fi rst.
Here’s the default menu, it’s already been 
populated with the current page structure. 
We also have an Options panel that gives us 
control over some of the design elements 
and options of the menu widget. 
 `Create three more pages to the right in 
the same way: Name them Our Services, 
Information and Contact Us. We also need 
three pages beneath the Our Cakes page. 
Th ese will become the sub-menus for the 
product galleries. To do this, click the plus 
sign beneath the Our Cakes thumbnail. To 
create the rest, add two more to the right of 
that. Th is gives us the sub-page hierarchy. 
We’ll name these pages Wedding cakes, Sea-
sonal cakes and Celebration cakes.
 `Grab the Selection tool. Click and drag 
the menu up to the header graphic. Now 
use the left  handle to stretch the menu 
across until it snaps to the edge of the con-
tent area. Do the same for the right edge. 
Th e width  of the boxes changes to create 
equally sized  items, leaving the text cen-
tered within them. Th is is controlled by the 
menu widget’s Option panel. We’ll look at 
this in more detail next. Use the top and 
bottom handles to stretch the height to 
match the ribbon.

The  Menu Widget settings
Menu Type: this determines how the menu will dis-
play the pages of the site. 

O Top Level Pages only displays the main pages of 
the site (at the top of the hierarchy).

O All Pages shows the top navigation level and all 
sub-level pages as drop-down items, depending on 
how they are arranged in the Plan mode.

O Manual lets us choose which links to pages or 
anchor tags to add. Page links are not automati-
cally created and need to be added, along with the 
label text or image, for each item. New items are 
created by clicking the plus icons in the same way 
as adding pages in the Plan mode. 
Direction: this can be set to Horizontal or Vertical. We 
can alternate between them at any time.
Edit Together: when this is enabled any change to a 
single item, text color for instance, will be applied to 
all elements of the menu uniformly. Disable this if 
you want to edit the items individually.
Item Size

O Uniform Size sets every item to the same width, 
regardless of the size of the label. 

O Uniform Spacing sets the individual items to have 
varying widths, dependent on the label size.
Show Left Icon: this is disabled by default. When 
enabled a graphic element can be added to the menu 
items. Th is could be an image or have a fi ll color.
Show label: this, as the name suggests, determines if 
the item’s text label appears or not. We would want to 
turn it off  if we were using image-based menu items.
Show Right Icon: this is similar to the Show Left  Icon 
item and has three settings

O Off – the icon is never displayed

O On – the icon is always displayed. Th e icon style is 
manually defi ned.

O Submenus Only – if the site has a hierarchy set 
up and the Menu Type is set to All Pages or Man-
ual, the right-hand icon will be displayed. Th is is 
a downward-facing arrow by default but can be 
edited.
Parts Positioning controls how the items within each 
menu item are aligned. 

O Horizontally; Center Aligned is the default setting. 
Text labels and icons are aligned in line along the 
horizontal center of the menu.

O Horizontally; Top Aligned sets the text labels and 
icons to be aligned in line to the top of the menu.

O Vertically; Center Aligned sets the text labels and 
icons to be aligned in line down the vertical center.

O Vertically; Left Aligned sets the text labels to be 
center aligned at the top of the menu item, icons 
are placed beneath the text label and left -aligned 
to the menu item.

The navigation menu is in place but we need to make some changes. The website design doesn’t include the 
home page as a standard menu item, instead, we’ll add the link into the logo. We also need to change the 
appearance to something more suitable. All this is completely under our control, of course. We’ll need to take a 
structured approach to this, however.
Style the menu
Th e objects in the menu object are arranged 
hierarchically, the fi rst component in the 
tree being the menu itself. Th e next item to 
be selected appears as a tooltip as we hover 
the cursor over it. In this case, it’s the menu 
item; click once to select it. Th e currently 
selected item is shown in the Selection Indi-
cator in the far left  of the Control panel.
It’s worth making a point to remember 
this, as it’s very easy to fi nd yourself work-
ing on the wrong object!
 `Th e fi rst thing we’ll do is remove the back-
ground fi ll; we only want the text labels 
fl oating on the ribbon.
Click the Fill swatch in the Control panel 
to open the color picker. Click the top-left  
swatch (None). Th is removes the fi ll leav-
ing us with just the text. It’s not particularly 
clear at the moment, of course, as it’s white 
on yellow.
 `As these are buttons, we need to change 
the background for each of their states. 
Click where it says normal to the right of 
the object name in the Control panel. Th is 
gives us a list of the menu states. Click  Roll-
over. Set the color for this to None as we did 
in the previous step. 
Repeat this for the remaining two states. 
It seems like we’re only changing this one 
item, this is because it’s the selected item; 
the rest will follow suit due to the Edit 
Together option being set in the widget’s 
options. Th e changes will be apparent when 
the site is previewed.

 `With the background removed for the 
menu button states, we need to make the 
text clearer. We’ll begin by changing the 
color so we can see the menu items prop-
erly. Click the fi rst menu item a couple of 
times until the Label item is showing as 
selected in the Selection Indicator.
Open the Text panel. Click the color 
swatch to open the color picker. We’ll use 
the Chocolate Brown preset for the normal 
state. As before, all the menu headings are 
changed in unison.
 `Next, we’ll change the remaining menu 
button states. Click the Normal state link in 
the Control panel to open the States panel. 
Select the Rollover item. Set the color to 
the Mint Green preset. It’s a little faint now 
but will be more visible once we change the 
typeface and weight. 
Leave the Mouse Down as it is but change 
the Active state to green as well; we need to 
show the visitor which page they are cur-
rently viewing.
 `Now for the typeface. Choose the Nor-
mal menu state again. Go back to the Text 
panel. Click the font dropdown menu. 
Click  Add Web Fonts as we did previously. 
We want a sans serif font so we can click 
the fi lter option at the top of the window 
to narrow the choice. Cabin is a good clean 
font and has several weights available. Click 
OK to add it. 
Go back to the font menu. Hover over the 
entry for Cabin. A sub-menu appears giv-
ing us the weights and styles. Choose Bold. 
Finally, set the size to 24px. Check the other 
states to make sure they have followed suit.

us to still retain the current layout. In the interest of not over-complicating the process this early on, I decided to 
change the site design, moving the logo to the left  of the site, with the menu items following. Th e technique for 
adjusting the layout whilst keeping the current design is explained in chapter 7.
Whilst we try to stick to the design we have agreed with the client, unlike print design, sometimes it’s just not 
technically possible to achieve the exact layout we want. Th e menu issue here highlights this perfectly. Although it 
is possible to work around the problem, it’s oft en better to take the easy option and prevent further complications 
later on down the line.
Menu display options
Th e fi rst thing we need to do is remove the 
home page entry from the menu, as we’ll be 
using the site logo as the link to navigate 
back. Go back to the Plan mode (Cmd+M/
Ctrl+M). Right-click the Home page’s 
thumbnail to open its contextual menu. 
Open the  Menu Options sub-menu. Choose 
 Exclude From Menus.
 `Go back to the master page in the Design 
mode (Cmd+I/Ctrl+I). We can see that the 
menu no longer contains the home page. 
We’ll have to make a few changes, of course, 
but it’s going to be better in the long-term.
2
 `First, we’ll move the logo over to the left  of 
the page. Grab the Selection tool (V). Click 
the logo image to make sure it’s active. Hold 
down the Shift  key to constrain the move-
ment. Now drag the image across to the left  
so it aligns to the left -hand page guide.

 `Let’s change the size of the menu to fi t 
alongside the logo. Click the menu widget 
to make it active. Drag the middle-left  han-
dle over to the right of the logo image. A 
smart guide will appear to show when the 
edges meet. Th e menu items  are automat-
ically spaced proportionately, so we don’t 
need to make any further adjustments.
Image-based page link
With the menu set up we can make the logo 
into a link to the home page. Make sure it’s 
the active object; it will display as Image 
Frame in the Selection Indicator. Go to the 
Hyperlink menu. Select Home from the list 
of internal links.
Open the Hyperlink options panel. Make 
sure that the option to open the link in a 
new window is unchecked; we don’t want it 
branching off . We can also add  a tooltip to 
further notify the visitor that the  image is a 
link to the home page.
 `We need to have some kind of indication 
that the image is a live link. We could cre-
ate a new version of the logo incorporating 
a rollover state, of course, but we can also 
apply eff ects directly in Muse.
Select the Rollover state in the Control 
panel. Click the Eff ects item to open its 
options panel. Click the third item tab to 
select the  Glow settings. Enable Glow by 
clicking its checkbox. We’ll use our Mint 
Green preset for the color. 
Set the Opacity to 65 and the Blur value 
to 15. Th is gives us a subtle halo around the 
logo that will display when the visitor hov-
ers over it.

40
Add sub-menus
Currently, we can only see the top level 
of menu items. Our Cakes has three sub-
pages, so we’ll need to enable them. Click 
any of the menu items to make it active. 
Click the blue arrow button to open the 
Options panel. Change the Menu Type to 
All Pages. Enable the Show Label option. 
Set it to Sub-menus only.
 `If the sub-menus aren’t visible, we can 
open them by clicking on the Our Cakes 
menu item. On the live page, they will be 
displayed when we hover over the item.
Th e default sub-menu style doesn’t match 
the style we’ve set up. We’ll need to alter 
them individually. 
 `We can give ourselves a helping hand with 
styling the menus by defi ning a paragraph 
style based on the main menu items.
Click to select one of the menu labels. 
Open the Paragraph Styles panel. Click the 
New Paragraph Style icon at the bottom. 
Th e style details dialog opens. We’ll name 
this Main Menu.
 `To apply the style we need to select the 
menu item object of one of the sub-menus. 
Go over to the Paragraph Styles panel. 
Click the Main Menu style. All three menus 
now have the same typeface, size and color. 
Note that the style only aff ects the text, we’ll 
need to adjust the menu frames separately.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Although we have the correct typeface and 
color, the bold style of the main menu is a 
little too much for the sub-menus. Right-
click the Main Menu paragraph style. Select 
Duplicate Style. Double-click the duplicate 
style’s label. Change its name to Sub Menu.
 `Go to the Text panel. Select Cabin Regular 
from the font menu. Set the size to 20. Th is 
looks much better.
Notice how the new style label now has a 
plus sign next to it. Th is is warning us that 
the style has been altered. Right-click the 
style’s label again. Select 5HGHˉQHVW\OH to 
set the changes.
 `We need to change the width of the 
sub-menu items. Click to select one of 
the sub-menu items. Click and drag the 
right-middle handle out to 160. Th is gives 
us plenty of space for the page names to sit 
centered in their frames.
 `We also need to change the background 
color. Th is will be the same as the main 
menu’s background. Click one of the menu 
items to make sure it’s still active. Open the 
Fill color picker. Use the Sample Color tool 
to sample the menu color. Create a preset  
named Warm Yellow
 `Th e sub-menu states need to be altered 
as they are still set to the default values. 
Start by setting the Fill to Warm Yellow for 
the three remaining states. Now change 
the text color for the Rollover and Mouse 
Down states to Mint Green. Th e Active state 
should remain as Chocolate Brown.

 `We only need to use the sub-menus for 
the cakes pages so we’ll tell Muse not to use 
the main entry as a link.
Go to the Plan mode (Cmd+M/Ctrl+M). 
Right-click the thumbnail for Our Cakes. 
Go to the Menu Options sub-menu. Unlike 
the Home item, which we removed com-
pletely, we still want the item visible, so 
select Include Page without Hyperlink. 
 `We’ve almost fi nished designing the mas-
ter page. Th ere are a few things to do before 
we start to create the site’s page content.
Switch back to the Master in Design 
mode (Cmd+I/Ctrl+I). First we’ll remove the 
fi ll and stroke from the page content area. 
Grab the Selection tool (V). Click anywhere 
inside the white area. Page will be displayed 
as the current item in the Selection Indica-
tor. Go to the Fill color picker. Select the No 
Fill option. Now set the Stroke to 0.
Protect the design layout
It’s easy to accidentally move an object on the page without realising and if we’re working on a live template,  
this could disrupt the whole site. We can prevent this from happening by locking the design’s objects in place. 
7KLVFDQEHGRQHRQDQLQGLYLGXDOEDVLVZKHQZHDUHKDSS\ZLWKWKHLUSRVLWLRQE\ˉUVWVHOHFWLQJWKHREMHFW\RX
want to lock then going to the Object menu and choosing  Lock (Cmd+L/Ctrl+L). We can also lock every object 
at the same time by going to Edit > Select All (Cmd+A/Ctrl+A), then using the lock command.
 `Currently, the sub-menus have a 1 pixel 
black stroke applied. Th is works well as a 
divider but is too bold for our site. Select 
the Normal state. Open the Stroke options 
panel. Click the chain icon to unlink the 
Stroke values. Th is allows us to alter them 
individually. Set the top value to 4 pixels; 
change the rest to 0. Go to the Stroke color 
picker. Set the color to white. Repeat this for 
the remaining states.

preview every now and again, rather than relying on how it’s seen in Design mode, as any mistakes in the design 
or setup will be easier to spot. We’re now ready to begin creating the site content.
The completed master page

Creating the 
site content

W
ith the master page complete, we can set about designing the site content 
based around it. Muse has some great built-in features for creating feature 
rich, interactive content. We’ll be making good use of them in the following chapter.

46
Creating the site content
The home page
3
We’ll start by setting up the home page. This is going to act as both a product showcase and a source of news 
about the company. We’ll be using the built-in widgets to create a rotating display to draw visitors in, providing 
a direct link to the individual product galleries. We’ll also create a section for upcoming events, news and a live 
feed from the company’s Twitter account.
Build a slide presentation
Th e fi rst element we’ll create is the rotat-
ing product slide presentation using one of 
the built-in widgets. Rather than the preset 
slideshows, we’ll use a   Composition widget. 
Th is allows us to combine images, text and 
active elements on the slides.
Go to the Widget Library panel. Open up 
the Compositions list. We have several pre-
sets to choose from. We’ll be working from 
scratch so choose the Blank. Click and drag 
it over onto the page. Don’t worry about the 
exact positioning, we can alter that next.
 `Th e widget’s panel automatically expands 
out to a default size. Notice how the footer 
also drops down to accommodate it.
Th e basic Composition widget comprises 
two sections: the main area, referred to as 
the target, where the slide content is placed, 
and the three triggers below; these allow the 
visitor to select the targets manually, even if 
they are set to automatically cycle. Th e plus 
sign next to the last trigger can be clicked 
to add a new target and trigger. Coinciden-
tally, the widget has three targets by default, 
which is also the number of categories in 
the cake company’s product range, so we 
don’t need to make any changes as yet.
Th e widget options panel also opens 
up to show the controls we have over the 
widget’s behaviour; we’ll look at them in 
more detail on the next page. 

47
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
The  Composition widget settings
Th e fi rst setting is Position. Th is has three options and 
determines how the objects will be displayed:

O Stacked is the default setting of the basic preset. 
All targets are placed on top of each other and dis-
played according to the transition setting.

O Scattered allows the targets to be placed inde-
pendently of each other on the page. Th is is the 
mode used by the Tooltip preset.

O Lightbox hides the targets initially and displays 
them on a semi-opaque overlay when the trigger 
is activated.
Show target determines how the targets will be 
activated. Th is has two options: On Click and On 
Rollover. Th e latter is not available in Lightbox mode.
Hide Target sets the display behavior of the tar-
get areas, enabling you to show or hide the content. 
Again, these are not available in Lightbox mode. Th is 
setting has four options:

O None keeps the activated target visible.

O On Click hides the target when the trigger
is clicked.

O On Rollout hides the target as soon as the cur-
sor leaves the trigger. Again, this is used with the 
Tooltip preset.

O On Rollout of Trigger and Target is similar to 
Rollout except the target also remains visible if 
the cursor is over it. Th is is used for creating pop-
ups that have their own interactive items, such
as buttons.
Transition controls how the target content will be dis-
played, replaced and hidden. Th is has three modes:

O Fading causes the content to fade in and out 
between the target content.

O Horizontal sets the content to slide in from the left  
or right, depending the whether the next slide is 
before or aft er the current target.

O Vertical sets the content slides in from the top or 
bottom of the target area.
Transition Speed controls the rate at which the tar-
gets are displayed. Th e arrows increase or decrease 
the amount in half-second increments or we can type 
in an arbitrary amount.
When Auto Play is enabled the targets will auto-
matically cycle round when the page is loaded. Th e 
time delay between slides can be set in half-second 
intervals or entered manually. Ordinarily, when a 
composition is set to auto play the slides will be dis-
played in the order in which they were set up. We can 
randomize the order by checking the 6KXIˊH option. 
Hide All Initially prevents the targets from showing 
when the page is loaded, leaving only the triggers 
visible. Th is is mainly used for pop-up items such as 
tooltips but can be enabled for any of the Composi-
tion styles.

48
3
Creating the site content
Enable Swipe can be activated to allow the target content to be controlled by swiping on a touch-screen device 
such as the iOS and Android tablets and phones. It’s an idea to leave this enabled in case visitors are viewing the 
desktop version on a mobile device.
By default, the target content is the top-most object in the composition object; moving the target over the triggers 
will hide them beneath. Triggers on Top forces the triggers to sit above the target content. Th is lets us have thumb-
nails and buttons that display above the target area if the design demands it.
Th e next section is Parts. Here we have the option to show the navigation (previous and next) and close buttons. 
As with the other widget components, these can be placed anywhere on the page.
Th e fi nal section is Editing. Th ese options are solely used during the creation process:

O Show lightbox parts while editing toggles the display of the target areas, enabling us to edit the content and also 
see the design layout without needing to switch between the Design and Preview modes each time.

O Show all in Design Mode shows every component of the composition without the need to click their targets. 
Th is is used primarily when creating pop-ups and other incidental items to aid in creating the layout.
 `Let’s begin creating our product display. 
Grab the Selection tool. Make sure that the 
overall Composition is the active object. 
Click and drag it over so the top-left  cor-
ner aligns to the left  page margin and the 
Header guide. 
At this stage we can’t increase the size of 
the composition as it takes its dimensions 
from the largest target object.
 `Grab the Selection tool. Click to select the 
target object. Drag the right-middle handle 
over to the next column guide. Th is gives 
us a two-thirds span for the product slides. 
Th e height of the slides will be determined 
by the target content.
We’ll leave the background fi ll for the 
time being as it helps with the positioning 
of the content.  

49
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
Add the slide content
Go to File > Place (Cmd+D/Ctrl+D). Navi-
gate to the Assets folder. We can load the 
place gun with multiple images. For the fi rst 
slide we need wedding-cake.png, confetti.
png and wedding-cakes-heading.png.  We 
can select them all by holding Cmd/Ctrl and 
clicking each in turn. 
When we click Open, the cursor shows 
the thumbnail of the fi rst image we selected 
– the confetti here – along with a number 
in brackets denoting the number of images 
that we loaded, 3 in our example. 
 `Click once in the area to the right of the 
widget. Th e confetti image is placed onto 
the page. Th e cursor now shows the next 
image in the place gun. Click again to place 
this. Click once more to set down the fi nal 
image.
At the time of writing it’s not possible 
to place multiple images at their full size 
(using the single click method) directly 
onto a widget target.
 `Th e Selection tool is already active aft er 
placing the images. Click and drag the 
heading text image  over to the widget. Th e 
boundary of the target turns blue to denote 
that we are adding items to it. Align the top-
left  corner of the bounding box to the left  
corner of the target. 

50
 `Drag the cake image over to the widget, 
aligning the top-right corner to the right 
corner of the target. Th e height of the target 
expands to accommodate it. Lastly, drop in 
the confetti image.
 `We need to change the stacking order of 
the image objects ( sometimes referred to as 
the Z order) as the confetti is the front-most 
image and should be in the background.
Make sure the confetti is still the active 
object. Go to the Object menu. Select 
Send to back. Th is is relative to the target 
container of the Composition widget so 
it remains visible on the slide but is now 
behind the other items.
 `Next we’ll create the caption text. Grab 
the Text (T) tool. Click and drag out a text 
frame beneath the heading text. Make it 
fairly large, we’ll adjust the dimensions 
once the caption is added. Type in the cap-
tion text as shown, or copy and paste from 
captions.rtf in the Assets folder.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Now let’s style the text. Select the whole 
block of text. Go to the Text panel. Set the 
typeface to Georgia. Set the size to 20pt. 
Change the Alignment to Centered. Lastly, 
set the color to Chocolate Brown. Create a 
new paragraph style named slide captions so 
we can quickly apply it to the other slides.
 `Switch to the Selection tool. Use the han-
dles on the text frame to fi t it closer to the 
text. As we bring the bottom of the frame 
up, a dashed line appears just below the last 
line of text. Th is indicates the minimum 
height of the frame. 
Although it’s not relevant here, if we 
were creating a design with closely adjacent 
objects, we would need to pay attention to 
the height marker, as it could aff ect the lay-
out when it’s published.
 `We need to reposition the caption text. 
Click and drag inside the frame. We can use 
the   Smart guides to make sure the caption is 
aligned horizontally with the heading and 
also vertically to keep it centered.

52

Creating the site content
 `To add a little interaction to the slides, 
we’ll create a link to the product galleries by 
means of a  Call to Action button.
Go to File >   Place Photoshop Button 
(Cmd+B/Ctrl+B). Open the call to action.psd 
fi le. Th e Photoshop import options dialog 
opens. Th e Normal and Rollover states are 
already set by the layer names. We just need 
to set the Mouse Down and Active states by 
choosing the layers from the drop-down 
menus. Click OK to load the place gun.
 `Position the cursor over the target area, 
roughly in the position we want the button. 
Click once to place the button. Now click 
and drag the image into place; we can use 
the Smart guide to align with the center of 
the text. Th e  Spacing guides can be used to 
set the vertical spacing equal to the spacing 
between the caption and the heading.
 `We’ll need to set the button as a link, of 
course. Open the hyperlink drop-down 
menu. Find the link Our cakes: Wedding 
cakes; sub-pages are prefi xed with the par-
ent page and a colon.
Open the Hyperlink options panel. Make 
sure that it’s not set to open in a new win-
dow. Add some text for the tooltip. I’ve used 
Jump to our gallery of wedding cakes.

53
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Th at’s the fi rst slide completed. Currently, 
the triggers are hidden beneath the tar-
get area. Click the blue arrow to open the 
widget options panel. Enable the  Triggers 
on Top option. Click the fi rst trigger to 
make it the active object. Now hold Shift 
and click the other two. Drag the triggers 
down below the target area so we can work 
with them until the remaining slides are 
complete.
 `Click the second trigger to activate its tar-
get. Repeat the steps we used to create the 
previous slide. Th is time use the images and 
text for the celebration cakes. Remember to 
set up the Call to Action button’s link. Click 
the third trigger. Now add the Seasonal 
cakes slide content.
 `Now that we have the three slides set up, 
we can remove the gray backgrounds. Make 
sure the target object is active by clicking 
an area of blank space. Open the Fill Color 
panel. Set the Fill to none. Th ere’s also a sin-
gle pixel Stroke. Remove that by changing 
its value to 0. Repeat this for each of the 
remaining slides.

54

 `With the slide design for each target con-
tainer complete, we can style the triggers. 
Th ese will be used as both navigation and 
indicators of the currently displayed slide 
in the sequence. Rather than using images, 
we’ll use the inbuilt styles. 
Start by selecting the fi rst trigger with the 
Selection tool. Th e wedding cake slide will 
be displayed.
 `Begin by making the trigger square by 
dragging right edge in slightly. Select the 
Active state from the Control panel or  the 
States panel. Open the Fill Options panel. 
Set the color to Chocolate Brown. Th is 
defi nes the style of the trigger that displays 
for the currently active slide.
 `We could leave the trigger square but that 
doesn’t fi t with the theme. Go to the Control 
panel. Change the Corner Radius value to 
20. Th is changes our square to a circle.
Let’s stop at this point and create a 
graphic style for the circle shape. Th at way 
we can quickly apply the style to all three 
triggers. Open the  Graphic Styles panel. 
Click the New Style icon. Double-click the 
style’s label to open its properties. Change 
the name to Trigger Active. Click OK to 
apply.
Creating the site content

55
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Select the trigger’s Normal state. Click 
the Trigger Active style we just created; the 
colored circle style is applied. We don’t want 
to change the original style. Right-click the 
style label. Select Duplicate Style. Rename 
this Trigger Normal.
Go to the Fill panel. Change the color to 
the Mint Green preset. Th e plus appears to 
tell us the style has been changed. Click  the 
5HGHˉQH6W\OH icon or right-click the style’s 
label and select 5HGHˉQH 6W\OH from the 
menu.
 `Now we’ll style the Rollover state. Select it 
in the States panel. Apply the Normal style 
to give it the default look. Duplicate the 
style and rename as we did before; this time 
we’ll call it Trigger Rollover.
We’ll add a stroke to the circle that will 
appear as we hover over the trigger. Set the 
Stroke value to 4. Set the Stroke color to 
Chocolate Brown. Redefi ne the style to pre-
serve it. Finally, set the Mouse Down state 
to the same style by clicking off  it and rese-
lecting it. 
 `Select the second trigger object. Change it 
to a square. Go through each state setting 
them to the associated style presets. Do the 
same for the third trigger.
Th e circles are a bit too big. Select the fi rst 
trigger. Hold Shift. Now select the other 
two. We can now scale all three at once 
by clicking and dragging the bottom-right 
handle. A size of 30 is OK. While we have 
the triggers selected, we can move them 
into position. Here, I’ve placed them at the 
center of the slide, just below the target area.

56
3
Set the  Autoplay
With all the elements in place, we can set up 
the autoplay options for the Composition 
widget. Open the options panel by click-
ing the blue arrow; it’s a good idea to select 
the main composition or target fi rst, as that 
gives the panel more space.
Start by changing the Transition to Hori-
zontal. Th is makes the slides look more 
dynamic as they change. Leave the tran-
sition speed at its default of 0.5 seconds. 
Enable Autoplay. We can leave the rest of 
the settings as they are.
Test the presentation
Now’s a good time to test the slides. Switch 
to Preview mode (Cmd+P/Ctrl+P). All being 
well, the page should load and the slides 
should start to rotate; they shift  to the left  
when autoplaying. 
As the slides change, the triggers also 
move, alternating between the active and 
normal states. If we hover the cursor over 
the trigger, we see the stroke we applied to 
the Rollover state. Clicking any of the trig-
gers will stop the autoplay and go directly to 
the associated slide. Th e chosen target will 
shift  in from the left  if it’s before the cur-
rently active target, or from the right if it 
comes aft er in the sequence.
Creating the site content

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
Add the information panels
To complete the home page, we’ll add the 3 
information panels to the right of the slides. 
Th ese will contain static text as well as the 
company’s latest Twitter tweet. We’ll begin 
by creating and styling the containers.
 Grab the Rectangle tool (M). Position 
the cursor at the intersection of the Header 
guide and the third column margin. Click 
and drag the box across to the right page 
margin and down to a height of 176 pixels.
 `Go to the Fill panel. Choose Mint Green 
for the Fill color. We don’t want the con-
tainers to be too obtrusive so we’ll lower the 
Opacity to 20. Th is defi nes the space with-
out overpowering the design.
 `We’ll round off  the corners to keep with 
the design theme. Change the Corner Radius 
to 10. Th ere’s already a 1 pixel stroke, which 
looks good. All we need to do is change the 
Stroke color. Set this to Chocolate Brown.
 `It’s likely that we’ll use a similar box style 
elsewhere on the site, so before we continue, 
we’ll create a new graphic style for the con-
tainer. Go to the Graphic Styles panel. Click 
the New Style icon. Double-click the style 
label. We’ll name this Container. Click OK.

58

 `Although we created a style for the boxes, 
we can quickly add the next two by copying 
the original. Grab the Selection tool. Hold 
down the Opt/Alt key. Now click and drag 
on the rectangle to make a copy. Repeat this 
for the third box. Make sure the boxes are 
aligned to the left  column margin. Don’t 
worry about the spacing for the moment.
 `We’ll set the bottom of the last box to be 
parallel with the bottom of the slide trig-
gers. Click and drag the rectangle vertically 
until the thicker blue guide appears to show 
that the two objects are aligned; we can 
hold the Shift key down as we move it to 
constrain the movement.
 `Now we can adjust the spacing between 
the boxes. Ensure the bottom box is still 
selected. Hold the Shift key. Now click the 
two other boxes to add them to the selec-
tion. Access the Align settings in the Control 
panel or the Align panel. We’ll use the Dis-
tribute Vertical Centers option here – the 
second to last icon in the Distribute Objects 
section – to set the vertical spacing equally.
Since we know this is where the boxes 
will remain, we can use this opportunity 
to lock them to the page (Cmd+L/Ctrl+L). 
Th is will prevent any accidental movement 
when we start adding the content.
Check your locked objects
When copying and pasting objects, it’s important to ensure that none of the items are locked, as they will not 
be included in the selection. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to unlock items individually, it must be done at 
page level. The command for this is under the Object menu:  Unlock All on Page (Opt+Cmd+L/Alt+Ctrl+L). 
To avoid going through the process of locking the items again, if we undo (Cmd+Z/Ctrl+Z) the Unlock All 
command immediately after copying the objects to the clipboard, the objects will return to their previous state and the 
copied data will still be retained.

 Embedding HTML code
Th e fi nal box is a little diff erent. Here we’ll 
be displaying the latest tweet from the

create embedded HTML code that draws 
the information into the page. To stream-
line the process here, I’ve created a text fi le

your own embed code by visiting www.

Muse. Go to the Object menu. Select   Insert 
HTML. Paste the code into the HTML win-

Add the page description
Go back to the Plan mode. Double-click the  
Wedding cakes page thumbnail to open the 
page in Design mode. We’ll start with the 
page header and caption.
Open the fi le Gallery page text.rtf. Select 
and copy the wedding cake section of the 
text. Paste it into Muse to create a new text 
frame. Use the Selection tool to position it 
against the left  margin of the fi rst column 
and the Header guide. Resize the frame so 
it spans the column width.
 `Select the Wedding cakes heading. Go 
to the Paragraph Styles panel. Click the 
Footer Headings style to apply it to the text. 
We’ll increase the size a little as it needs to 
be more prominent. Open the Text panel. 
Set the size to 24.
As we’ll be using this again, we’ll create a 
new paragraph style. Duplicate the current 
style. Rename it to Page caption header.
 `Now for the caption body. Select the text 
in the two paragraphs. Apply the Footer 
Body preset. As this is a larger block of text, 
we’ll set the Alignment to -XVWLˉHG. Click 
the Align Justify icon in the Text panel.
Create a new style preset named Page 
caption body. Now highlight the company 
name on the fi rst line. Set its style to Italic. 
Th e plus sign appears next to the style but 
we’ll ignore it, as we need to retain the 
changes we’ve made.
The next set of pages we’ll be creating is the product gallery. We’ll be using another of the widgets included with 
Muse here, this time it’s the  Slideshow widget. This is similar to the Composition widget we used for the home

Build the slideshow
Th e   Slideshow widget has little in the way 
of styling options, so we’ll create a back-
ground for both the thumbnails and the 
hero (main) image.
Grab the Rectangle tool. Draw out a 
frame to the right of the caption we just cre-
ated, leaving a gap roughly twice the width 
of the column margin, over to the right 
edge of the page. Align it to the Header 
guide. As yet we don’t know exactly how 
high the frame needs to be so bring it down 
to around double the height of the caption.
 `We can use the same style for the frame 
background as we did for the boxes on the 
home page. Go over to the Graphic Styles 
panel. Click the Container style. Th is gives 
us the low-opacity green background with 
rounded corners.
 `Create another rectangle beneath the 
caption, leaving a reasonable amount of 
space below the text. Align the bottom of 
the frame with the main frame. Apply the 
Container style to this frame as well. Th is 
will be the background area for the block of 
thumbnail images.

The slideshow settings
Now to add the Slideshow widget itself. Go 
to the  Widget Library. Open the Slideshow 
folder. Click and drag the  Basic preset over 
to the page. 
By default there’s a sample image with cap-
tion, navigation and counter. Th e options 
panel is very similar to that of the Compo-
sition widget, so I’ll skip the full breakdown 
of its features and deal only with the set-
tings specifi c to the slideshow.
 `We’ll defi ne the height of the hero image 
and its frame by the size of the thumbnail 
panel. We’ll need to add some images, of 
course. Before we import them, we’ll make 
some changes to the settings.
First, we’ll set the New Hero option to  Fit 
Content Proportionally. Th is ensures that 
the whole image will be visible to begin 
with. Next, turn off  the Captions and the 
Counter. All we need is the navigation but-
tons. Finally, enable Thumbnails, as they’re 
not currently visible.
Import the images
 `With the options set, we can add the fi rst 
batch of images. Th ere will be eight images 
per page. Click the Add Images icon. 
Browse to the Wedding Cakes in the Assets 
folder. Open the Page 1 folder. Select all the 
images inside the folder. Click Open. Muse 
will begin importing the images. Aft er a 
short time, we see them appear as thumb-
nails. Th ese will automatically replace the 
sample images. If we add images at a later 
stage, they will be appended.

Position the thumbnails
Click on the thumbnails until the Th umb-
nail Container shows as the active object in 
the Control panel. Drag the container onto 
the panel we created. Leave a fairly gen-
erous border. Now drag out the right side 
of the container to the opposite side of the 
panel, leaving an equal border. Th is sets the 
boundary width for the thumbnails.
 `We want two columns of four thumb-
nails. Click the fi rst thumbnail to make it 
active. Go over to the Transform panel. Set 
the Width to 120 and Height to 80. As we 
do, the rest of the thumbnails change size 
to match.
Drag the bottom of the thumbnail con-
tainer’s frame up to meet the bottom of 
the thumbnails to remove the excess space 
that’s pushing the footer down.
 `Now we have the height of the thumb-
nail frame, we can alter the backgrounds 
to match. Select the rectangle behind the 
thumbnails. Drag it down to make an equal 
border at the bottom. 
Do the same with the hero image frame, 
aligning it with the thumbnail background.

Set the hero image size
With the thumbnails in place we can con-
centrate on the hero image. Click the 
current full size image until the hero Image 
is the active object. We’ll start by lining up 
the bottom of the image with the base of 
the thumbnails to give us the border size to 
work from. Drag the frame to the top-right 
corner, leaving the same border around the 
whole frame. We’re setting the dimensions 
of the image frame here, not the image size, 
as this will cause the images to display with 
a uniform size as much as possible.
 `Although we set the hero image to fi t the 
frame proportionately, resizing the frame 
has not altered the photo. Go to the Object 
menu. Select Fitting >  Fit Content Propor-
tionately. Th e photo’s dimensions change 
to make the best use of the frame; in  this 
case, it’s fi lled the vertical space.
 `We’ll need to do this for the rest of the 
photos in the set, of course. Click each of 
the thumbnails in turn to make the image 
active. Click the hero image to make sure 
it’s the active element before using the Fit 
command again, otherwise it will apply it 
to the thumbnail instead.

 `Th e next task is to style and position the 
navigation objects. We’ll be using simple 
text items here. Select the Next object with 
the Selection tool. Stretch it out as we’re 
going to need space to add the word Next 
behind the chevron. 
Now double-click inside to activate the 
text label. Type the text in. Now do the same 
for the Previous object, adding the word 
Previous in front of the chevron. Select the 
whole text. Change the text color to Choco-
late Brown. Both objects use this color.
 `We don’t want the background color. Grab 
the Selection tool again. Select the Previous 
button. Go to the Fill panel. Set the Fill to 
None. Again, both objects change together.
 `Move the Next item just below the bot-
tom of the outer hero frame so its chevron 
aligns with the column guide. Now position 
the Previous item next to it, leaving a little 
space in between the two.
Overcome the limited button styling

Create a  breadcrumb trail
Since we are having three pages of wed-
ding cakes, we’ll need a way of navigating 
between them. We could have another set 
of sub-menus hanging off  the main navi-
gation but that could look untidy. Instead, 
we’ll use another menu widget to create a 
breadcrumb trail navigation.
Go to the Widgets Library. Drag a   hori-
zontal menu over to the page. Place it in the 
area under the thumbnails; we’ll fi ne-tune 
the position later.
 `By default the menu is set to include 
the top-level pages. We don’t want this, of 
course. Set the Menu Type to Manual in the 
Options panel. Th is gives us full control 
over the menu content.  We’re left  with a 
single item.
Drill down to select the text item of the 
menu. Change it to Page 1. Select the whole 
text. Now set the color to Chocolate Brown.
 `Th e menu will be text only so we need to 
remove the background. Use the Selection 
tool to make the menu item active. Make 
sure the Normal state is selected. Go to the 
Fill panel. Set the Fill to None.
Switch to the Rollover state. Remove the 
background as before. Go to the Text panel. 
Set the color to Mint Green. Do the same for 
the Mouse Down state.
We need to indicate which page we’re 
on. Switch to the Active state. Remove the 
background. Keep the brown text color but 
make the text bold.

 `We want the menu label text to be aligned 
to the left  edge of the thumbnail box. We 
could reposition the menu as it is, with the 
edge of its frame overhanging the content 
area but there’s a tidier way.
Click to select the Label item of one of the 
menu items. Go to the Text panel. Select the 
Align Left icon. All three items shift  over to 
the left . We can now position the menu to 
butt against the column guide.
 `Although we have the three menu items, 
they are not yet linked to anything. Use the 
Selection tool to make the Page 1 menu 
item active. Go to the Hyperlink menu. 
Choose the internal link Our Cakes: Wed-
ding cakes. Go to the Hyperlink Options. 
Set the tooltip to Wedding cakes: Page 1.
When we click away from the menu, Page 
1 is emboldened to show that it’s the cur-
rent page. We’ll need to create the other two 
pages to be able to link to them, of course.
 `Th e last part of the menu styling is to 
alter the spacing. Drag the right edge of the 
frame over to the left . We want a small gap 
in between the items. A width of around 
180px gives us good spacing.

Replace slideshow content
 `We have the additional pages but the 
content is just a copy of the original at 
the moment. Th ere’s currently no way of 
automatically replacing the images in the 
slideshow, so we’ll have to do this in two 
stages.
Select the last thumbnail in the set (bot-
tom-right) to make it active; new content 
is always added aft er the currently selected 
image. Open the Options panel. Click the 
folder to bring up the fi le dialog. Browse to 
the Page 2 folder. Select the eight images. 
Click Open. Th e new images will be added.
 `Th e last thumbnail of the original set is 
still selected. Hold Shift. Now click each of 
the fi rst thumbnails in turn to add them to 
the selection. 
Once they’re all selected, press the Delete 
or Backspace key. Th is removes the selected 
items, shift ing the new set up to fi ll their 
place. As the new images were appended, 
there’s no need to alter the thumbnails or 
the hero images as they take on the previ-
ous attributes.
 `Th at’s the second set of images in place. 
Th e only adjustment we need to make 
is to shrink the thumbnail container to 
its original height, as it was stretched to 
accommodate the additional thumbnails 
and has pushed the footer down. Click and 
drag the bottom of the frame up to the base 
of the thumbnails. Th e footer will return to 
its original position.
Go through the previous steps for the

from the page 3 folder.

Duplicate the widgets
As we already have pages defi ned for the 
other product galleries we’ll use a diff erent 
method to replicate the slideshows. 
Go to one of the wedding cake pages. 
Grab the Selection tool. Position the cur-
sor adjacent to the top-right corner of the 
hero frame. Click and drag down towards 
the area just below the thumbnail container. 
A blue box appears as we do; everything 
within the box will be selected. Stay to the 
right of the page menu, we don’t need that 
selected as the other galleries are only going 
to be single pages.
Go to Edit > Copy (Cmd+C/Ctrl+C) to 
copy the selected objects to the clipboard.
 `Go back to Plan mode. Double-click the 
Seasonal cakes page thumbnail to open it in 
the Design mode.
Go to back to the Edit menu. Select Paste 
in 
Place 
(Opt+Shift+Cmd+V/Alt+Shift+ 
Ctrl+V). Th is places all the objects in exactly 
the same position on the page they were 
copied from.
Open the Gallery pages text fi le again. 
Select and copy the Seasonal cakes section.  
Delete the existing text from the page cap-
tion. Replace it with the copied text. Now 
exchange the images for the fi les in the Sea-

Repeat this process for the Celebration

nail containers are landscape, the images are clipped and are not always displayed at a good viewpoint. It is 
possible to adjust them manually, however. We can scale them to zoom in on the detail or reposition the con-
tent. The method for doing this is described over the page. To apply it to our slideshow thumbnails, we simply 
select each thumbnail in turn to adjust it.

The next page is Our Services. As well as revisiting previous techniques and styles here, we’ll be looking at some 
of the more powerful effects and tools available in Muse for working with images and text. We’ll create a mon-
tage of images showing the detail of some of the cakes to add a highlight to the page. We can rotate the images 
RQWKHˊ\ZKLFKJLYHVXVJUHDWHUˊH[LELOLW\DVZHGHVLJQWKHSDJHLQWKH0XVHZRUNVSDFH
 `We’ll begin by setting the text. Open the 
fi le Services text.rtf. Select and copy the 
body text.
Come back to the page and paste it in. 
We’ll use the same styles for the heading 
and body that we used for the gallery pages.
Create a frame template
We’ll create a frame template to hold the 
images. Grab the Rectangle tool (M). Hold 
Shift to constrain the proportions to a 
square. Click and drag out a frame, around 
220 pixels is a good size.
 `Set the Stroke color to white. Set the size 
to 10. Th e default position for a stroke is 
centered to the edge of the object. Go to the 
Stroke options. Set the Position to Inside by 
selecting the middle icon.
 `Set the Fill color to something with a 
strong contrast. I’ve used dark green here. 
Th is is just so we have a better visual guide 
for aligning the image content. We can 
change it once the images have been added.
 `Th e fi nal part of the frame template is to 
add a small drop shadow. Go to the Effects 
panel. Select the Drop Shadow tab. Click the 
Shadow checkbox to enable to eff ect. We’ll 
keep most of the default settings apart from 
the distance. Lower that to 2. Th is gives us a 
subtle separation from the background.

create a graphic style with these attributes. 
Go to the  Graphic Styles panel. Click the 
New Style icon.  Double-click the style label 
to open the properties dialog. We’ll name 
it Frame.
 `Grab the Selection tool. Hold down Opt/

duplicate. Do this twice more. For now, 
we’ll space them out to make it easier to add 
the images.
 `We’ll start adding the images. Go to File

Services Images folder. Select the face cake 
image. 
Click Open to load the place gun. Posi-

the green fi ll of the fi rst frame. Click and 
drag the corner of the image as you are 
placing it, until its width covers the frame’s 
interior.
Using the Crop tool
Grab the  Crop tool (C). Drag the bottom 
handle of the image up. As we do the image 
turns translucent so we can see the frame 
beneath. 
Rather than scaling the image, however, 
we’re trimming it down to the size of the 
frame. Bring it just inside the border. We 
can tell if it’s gone too far as we’ll start to see 
the green fi ll.

 `We want to zoom in on the detail in these 
photos. Hover the cursor over the image, 
a circle appears in the center. Click once. 
Th e frame turns brown, showing us the 
full area of the image. Click and drag the 
bottom-right corner. Again, the image goes 
translucent as it expands. 
If we hold down Opt/Alt as we drag, the 
image resizes from its center. Th e display by 
the cursor tells us the current percentage of 
the image’s full size – around 42% works 
well here. When we release the mouse, only 
the area within the frame is shown.
 `Once we’ve resized the image, we can click 
and drag inside the frame to position it. We 
can also press the Arrow keys on the key-
board to nudge it for more accuracy.
 `Th e last thing we’ll do is group the photo 
and its frame. Th is will enable us to move 
and rotate it as a single object. Grab the 
Selection tool. Click away from the image 
frame to deselect it. 
Now click inside the frame again to 
select the visible image frame. Hold Shift 
down. Click the border. We now have both 
selected. Go to Object >   Group (Cmd+G/
Ctrl+G) to combine the objects.
 `Repeat the previous steps to add in the 
remaining images. Zoom in to highlight 
the particular details of each. Remember 
to group each pair of objects aft er creating 
them.

Rotating images
Now we can start putting the images into 
position. We’ll start with the face cake. 
Use the Selection tool to select the group. 
Hover the cursor just outside of one of the 
frame’s corners. Th e cursor will change to a 
circular arrow. When we click and drag, the 
image rotates clockwise if we drag down or 
counter-clockwise if we drag up.
 `Rotate and reposition the rest of the 
images. We can have them overlapping for 
the scattered eff ect. We can also change 
their stacking order here, moving the third 
image beneath the fi rst. Either select the 
fi rst image, then go to Object >   Bring to 
Front, or select the third image and choose 
Object >   Send Backward. We can also right-
click the image and use the Arrange menu 
item.
 `Th e cropping and rotation is rendered 
live in the browser. Th is means that occa-
sionally, we’ll get slight misalignments. 
Th is could result in seeing the green back-
ground. 
Use the Selection tool to select one of the 
rectangles. Change its Fill color to white. 
Now go to the Graphic Styles panel. Click 
the 5HGHˉQH 6W\OH icon. All four image 
frames will now have white backgrounds, as 
they share the style. Any inaccuracies in the 
live version should now be invisible.

Many of the effects and transformations in the design are generated in real time, via the CSS code that Muse

Create a page divider
Let’s move on to the testimonials section 
mentioned in the caption body. We’ll begin 
by creating a divider between the top and 
bottom sections of the page. 
Grab the Rectangle tool. Position the 
cursor just below the bottom of the upper 
content but above the Footer guide. Draw 
out a frame of 860px wide by 2px high. 
Use the Selection tool and Smart guides to 
reposition it in the center of the page, leav-
ing a reasonable amount of space from the 
bottom of the images and text.  
 `Set the Rectangle’s Fill color to Warm 
Yellow. Set the Stroke value to 0. Go to 
the   Effects options panel. Select the Bevel 
panel. Check the  Bevel option to enable it. 
Th e defaults are too much. Leave the Opac-
ity at 75. Set the Blur to 2.  Leave the Angle 
at 45. Set the Distance to 2. Th is gives us a 
subtle raised eff ect.
 `Select the Text tool. Draw out a text frame, 
again it needs to be above the Footer guide. 
Add the text What our customers are say-
ing. We’ll use the Footer Heading paragraph 
style here. Drag the frame out to accommo-
date the text on a single line, if it’s too large.  
Set the Alignment to Center so we can use 
the Smart guides to align it to the page. 
Now click and drag the frame to the 
center of the page. We can use the  Spacing 
guides to create the same amount of vertical 
spacing as we have between the horizontal 
rule and the upper content – the amount of 
space (in pixels) is temporarily displayed as 
you drag each element on the page.

 `Go back to the Services.rtf fi le. Select and 
copy the fi rst quote. Paste it onto the page. 
Position the edge of the frame against the 
left  page margin. Leave an adequate margin 
below the heading.
 `Next, we’ll set up the background style. 
Go to the Graphic Styles panel. Choose the 
Container style. We’ll make the background 
completely opaque for the quotes. Go to 
the Fill Options panel. Increase the Opacity 
to 100. Create a new graphic style named 
Quotes container.
 `Th e frame is a little tight around the text. 
We can adjust this by adding space around 
the text. Go to the Text panel. Set the  Space 
Before value to 6. Set the  Space After to 6. 
Change the  Right Margin to 8. Th is gives 
the text some breathing space. We’ll need to 
update the style settings with the 5HGHˉQH
Style icon.
 `We’ll use the Footer Body style as the basis 
for the quote style. Select it from the Para-
graph Styles panel. Th e text is too small so 
increase the size to 16. Click the New Style 
icon to create a new paragraph style. We’ll 
call it Testimonials.

80
 `Grab the Selection tool. Drag the right 
edge of the text frame across to the right 
until the quote only spans two lines. Th is 
will be adequate for the majority of the 
quotes.
 `Th e next part of the quote box is to have 
a speech balloon to the left  of the text. Go 
to File > Place (Cmd+D/Ctrl+D). Open the 
talk-bubble.png fi le. Click once to drop it 
onto the page. Th e position isn’t important.
 Wrap text around an image
We want the text and the image to interact 
so the text fi ts to the edge of the balloon. 
If we were to drag the image onto the box, 
it would simply cover the text. If we were 
to set the balloon as the background fi ll 
it would appear beneath the text. Instead, 
we’ll use the text-wrapping feature. To do 
this we must paste the image into the text 
frame. Go to Edit > Cut. Th is copies the 
image to the clipboard and removes it from 
the page.   Double-click the text frame to 
make it active. Position the text cursor at 
the beginning of the top line. Go to Edit 
> Paste. Th e balloon now pushes the text 
content aside.
 `Switch back to the Selection tool. Drag 
the bottom-right corner of the balloon’s 
frame to scale it down. Around 70% is a 
good size. Go to the  Wrap panel. Currently 
the Wrap is set to Inline; the image behaves 
like a piece of text. We want the whole cap-
tion to butt against it. Click the  Left Wrap 
icon. Th e balloon is now positioned fl ush 
with the text. We’ll need to adjust the width 
of the frame again but we have a couple of 
adjustments to make fi rst.

 `We need to add a margin between the bal-
loon and the text. Th is is done by increasing 
the  Right Offset setting. A value of 8 is 
good.  We can also use negative values. Th is 
lets us off set the image outside of the frame 
for eff ect. Set the  Top Offset to -10. Now set 
the  Left Offset to -8. Th is sets the balloon to 
hang off  of the left  corner.
 `Drag out the right edge of the container 
to set the text to two lines again. We’ll add a 
drop-shadow as we did with the photos. Go 
to the  Shadow section of the Effects panel. 
Click to enable it. Change the Distance to 2. 
Remember  to update the style aft erwards.
 `Double-click the library item. Name it 
Quote Container. Library items are stored 
globally so we could use the item in any 
site we create. Th is can quickly become 
cluttered. Name the newly created folder 
Brighton Cake Co so we know where to 
come looking for a particular object.
Create a library item
Up to now we’ve used custom styles to 
defi ne the formatting and appearance of 
page elements. Th ese only let us describe 
the attributes of a single element at a time. 
We could use individual styles to defi ne the 
component parts of our quote object but we 
would still have to recreate them piece by 
piece. Th ere’s a better way. Muse has a fea-
ture called the  Library, which provides the 
ultimate control over saving and applying 
styles. We can add complex, reusable ele-
ments that we simply drag onto the page, a 
little like widgets.
Right-click the quote container. Select 
 Add to Library from the menu. A folder is 
created containing the new item. 

82

Reusing a library item
When we click the new item we created, we 
get a thumbnail view of it in the window 
above. To add a new instance to the page 
we simple drag the thumbnail or the item 
name onto the page content. A preview 
with plus sign appears under the cursor. 
Release the mouse to drop the new item.
 `Move the new quote object into position 
below the original. We’ll place this one 
aligned to the right edge of the page con-
tent. Th e original text was stored when we 
created the library item. Double-click the 
text to make it active. Select the entire block 
of text. 
Go back to the text fi le. Select and copy 
the next quote. Paste it into the container to 
replace the old text. Use the Selection tool 
to pull the left  edge in a little to fi x the wid-
owed text at the end of the sentence.
 `Add the remaining quotes in the same 
way, alternating from left  to right down the 
page.  Stretch or contract the containers to 
suit the text. I’ve also increased the spacing 
between the containers to 60px to avoid 
them looking too cluttered.
As a fi nal touch, we can select the peo-
ple’s names and set the style to Italics. Th is 
separates them from the rest of the text.
Your site vs the rest of the world

 `We’ll start with the page heading. Grab 
the Text tool. Draw out a reasonably wide 
text frame, aligned to the Header guide. Use 
the Selection tool to drag the frame so it 
aligns to the center of the fi rst page content 
column; a vertical red guide appears when 
we hit the center.
 `Go back to the Text tool if you swapped to 
the Selection tool. Click inside the frame. 
Type in Information. Go over to the Para-
graph Styles panel. Apply the Page Heading 
style. Tidy the frame by dragging the bot-
tom handle up until we see the minimum 
size marker.
Add an Accordion widget
Go to the  Widget Library. Click the Panel 
section to expand it and see the list of Panel 
widgets. Drag the   Accordion widget over to 
the page. Leave a space below the heading 
around the same height as the text frame. 
Align the left  edge of the widget to the left  
column center. Now drag the right side of 
the widget frame over to the center of the 
right column.
The Information page is going to be a little different in style to the previous pages. The focus will be on a single 
information panel in the center, rather than the separate text and image combination we’ve been using so far.
We’ll be using another widget available in Muse, called the Accordion panel. This is a series of individual sections 
that collapse when the next is displayed. Accordion panels encapsulate a great deal of visual content into a small 
area of screen real estate.

Style the accordion panels
Th e default accordion has three sections, 
fi lled with Lorem Ipsum placeholder text. 
We’ll start by styling the headings. Th ese are 
similar to the labels inside menu items, and 
they also have four states. Use the Selection 
tool to select the fi rst label. Active is the 
state for the currently visible panel.
 `Apply the Footer Heading style. We need 
to alter the style slightly, as the Space Aft er 
setting is increasing the height of the label. 
Set it to 0. Now drag the bottom of the label 
frame up as far as it will let you. 
Duplicate the style. Name it Label Active. 
Click the  5HGHˉQH 6W\OH icon to keep the 
new settings.
 `Next, we’ll change the Active label state’s 
background. Go to the Fill panel. Set the 
color to Warm Yellow. Lower the Opacity to 
60. Finish off  by setting the Stroke to 0.
 `Go to the States panel, or use the States 
menu next to the Selection Indicator in 
the Control panel. Select the Normal state. 
Click the Label Active paragraph style to 
apply it. We don’t want the text to be bold 
here, so uncheck it in the text options of the 
Text panel. Duplicate the style. Name this 
one Label Normal. Remember to redefi ne 
the style settings. 
Set the fi ll and stroke as we did with the 
previous state. Notice how the two remain-
ing labels change as they are also in the 
Normal state.

 `Select the Rollover state. Change the Fill 
color to Mint Green. We’ll leave the Opacity 
at 60. Mouse Down follows suit so we don’t 
need to alter that.
 `Currently, the labels have no separation. 
We’ll create a divider by updating the Stroke 
width for the bottom of the label container.
Go to the Control panel. Set the Stroke 
color to Chocolate Brown. Open the Stroke 
options. Click the link icon in the center to 
unlink the four sections. Change the bot-
tom Stroke value to 3. Now set the Stroke 
Alignment to Outside by clicking the third 
icon. Repeat this for the remaining states.
 `Now we have the look of the labels set up, 
we can change the heading names. Dou-
ble-click the fi rst label text. Change it to 
Menu and ingredients. Do the same for the 
other two. Set the second label to Portion 
guide. Th e last label is Pricing and delivery.
 `Th e panel content area has a thin white 
stroke. Th is acts as padding. We don’t need 
this as we want to be able to fi ll the con-
tent area all the way to the edges. Click in 
the white area to select the Content Area 
object. Set the Stroke to 0.
Populate the panels
We can begin adding our panel content. 
Click the Menu and ingredients header to 
open the panel. We don’t need the sam-
ple text so use the Selection tool to select 
it, making sure the text frame is the active 
object, then press Backspace or Delete to 
remove it.

 `Each of our panels will have a banner 
image as a heading. Go to File >   Place. 
Select the fi le ingredients banner.jpg. Click 
Open to load the place gun.
As we hover over the content area, its 
border turns blue. Th is tells us we’re within 
the confi nes of the widget. Position the 
cursor in the top-left  corner. Click once to 
place the image at full size.
 `Even though the banner image’s dimen-
sions are far greater than the content area, 
Muse has automatically resized it to fi t the 
width. We can press the Arrow keys to make 
any small adjustments in the positioning, if 
required. Make sure that the top and left  
edges of the image frame are aligned to the 
edges of the content area.
 `Next, we’ll add the caption text area. We’ll 
need to create some space, though. Select 
the Content Area object with the Selec-
tion tool. Drag the bottom of its frame 
down to open it up a little. At this stage, we 
don’t know how large it needs to be; we can 
always resize it later.
 `Open the text fi le information panels.rtf. 
Select and copy the fi rst paragraph under 
Caption (beginning At Th e Brighton Cake 
Company). Come back to Muse. Paste the 
text to load it into a text frame.
Drag the text frame up so it meets the 
bottom of the banner image. Now stretch it 
out to the left  and right edges of the panel.

 `We need to add some styling, of course. 
Use the justifi ed Page caption body style as 
the basis. Go to the  Text panel. Set the  Left 
Margin,  Right Margin,  Space Before and 
 Space After values to 10. Th is gives us a 
nice border area for the caption.
Create a new paragraph style. Name it 
Info panel captions.
 `Go back to the text document. Select and 
copy the text under the Details heading. 
Paste it onto the page as before. Stretch the 
frame out so the left  and right edges line up 
with the caption text.
We’ll use the rounded green container 
frame for the text background. Go to the 
Graphic Styles panel to apply it.
 `Apply the Footer Body style as the basis 
for the detail text. Again, we’ll make some 
changes. Set the values of left  and right 
margins to 10. 
We can’t use space before and aft er here 
as it will apply to every line-break. Instead, 
we’ll use the old-fashioned method, adding 
a carriage return above and below the fi rst 
and last lines. Create a new paragraph style 
named Info panel details.
 `We’ll embolden the cake types’ text to 
draw attention. Highlight each in turn, set-
ting the style to Bold.
Th e fi nal task is to close up the gap at the 
bottom of the panel where the text pushed 
it down. Grab the Selection tool. Make sure 
the Content Area object is selected. Now 
drag the bottom of the frame up. Leave a 
gap of around the same distance as we have 
between the detail panel and the caption.

 `Th e next panel is the Portion guide. Click 
its label to open it. Delete the sample text as 
we did before. Th e image for this section is 
portion banner.jpg.
When we place the image, it only fi lls 
half the width. Th is is because it’s taller and 
Muse has inserted it proportionately. All we 
need to do is drag the right edge over. Th e 
image is automatically scaled up to fi t. Th e 
content area snaps into position around the 
image when we release the mouse.
 `Make some space below the image. Copy 
and paste the next caption onto the page. 
Align it to the bottom of the image. Stretch 
the frame out to the full width of the panel. 
Now apply the Info panel caption paragraph 
style we created.
Simulating tables
Muse doesn’t support tables, which would 
have been ideal for this panel, so we’ll need 
to create the detail section in a diff erent way 
in order to divide the information into sep-
arate columns.
Start by creating a fairly large rectangular 
frame in line with the edges of the text and 
with the same distance from the caption 
as we did in the previous panel. We won’t 
know exactly how tall to make the frame 
until the text is in place but, because it’s just 
a background, we can adjust it later. Now 
apply the Container style.

 `Go back to the information panels text 
fi le. Copy and paste the fi rst set of data, 
including the heading, into the frame area. 
Use the Selection tool to position the text 
frame so it lines up to the top-left  corner of 
the container frame.
 `Start by applying the Info panel details 
style. Th is gives us a 10 pixel margin on the 
left . To add a margin at the top, hold Shift 
and press the Down Arrow once on the key-
board. Th is nudges the frame by 10 pixels. 
Select the heading text and set it to bold.
 `To complete this panel, use the Selection 
tool to drag the bottom of the container up 
to the text, leaving around a 10 pixel mar-
gin. Now we can drag the content area up, 
again, leaving a small margin before the 
third label.
 `We can add a vertical dividing line using 
a selective stroke on the text frame. Set the 
Stroke color to Chocolate Brown. Now open 
the Stroke options. Set the Stroke Loca-
tion to Inside. Click the link to unlink the 
strokes. Set the right Stroke’s value to 1. 
Drag the right edge of the frame to the left  
to shrink it to the correct size.
 `Repeat the steps to add the rest of the 
infomation. We’ll need to vary the widths 
of the frames slightly to fi t the text. As the 
data is split into two blocks of three, we can 
align the far right frame to the right edge 
of the container. Remember not to add the 
stroke to the end frame.

 `Th e fi nal panel is the pricing and delivery 
information. Th is is set up similarly to the 
fi rst panel, so I’ll just run through the spe-
cifi cs of the layout.
Start by clicking the Pricing and delivery 
label to open the panel. Delete the example 
text. Place the banner image fi le delivery.jpg 
at the top of the panel.
 `Copy and paste the body text onto the 
page. Use the Info panel details paragraph 
style to style the text. Now apply the Con-
tainer graphic style.
Resize the container to align with the 
caption text. Add a carriage return at the 
top and bottom of the text. Make the para-
graph section headers bold.
Finally, use the Selection tool to change 
the height of the content area.
 `Extend the content area to accommodate 
the caption and details. Copy and paste the 
caption text from the Pricing and delivery 
section of the text fi le. Apply the Info panel 
captions paragraph style.
 `Th e last thing to do is remove the gray 
stroke from around the accordion widget 
itself. Make sure the accordion is the active 
object. Now set the Stroke width to 0.
Navigating the object levels
If you want to select an item that’s buried beneath page elements, you can hold Cmd/Ctrl and click over the 
area to drill down. If there’s only one object clicking again will toggle between the objects. If you are several 
objects down the hierarchy, pressing Esc will take you back an object at a time. This is often easier than trying 
to select them with the cursor.

 `To start, we’ll create the heading on the 
page. Although it’s easy to create it from 
scratch, we can use a quick cheat and copy 
the heading from the Information page. If 
we use  Edit > Paste in Place (Opt+Shift+C-
md+V/Alt+Shift+Ctrl+V) it will be added in 
exactly the same position with the styling 
already applied. All we have to do is change 
the text to Contact Us.
Add a basic contact form
Go to the Forms section of the   Widget 
Library panel. Drag the  Simple Contact 
preset over to the page. It’s more effi  cient to 
start with this and add what we need, than 
to remove the unwanted sections.
As with the other widgets, the options 
panel opens up as we place the form. We’ll 
look at this in depth on the next page.
 `We’ll begin by adding a background for 
the form. Create a rectangle styled with the 
Container graphic style. Align the left -hand 
side with the heading. Bring the top of the 
container up to the base of the heading. 
Now hold Shift and press the Down Arrow 
key 6 times to create a margin of 60px – the 
same as the panels on the information page. 
Stretch the right side of the container over 
to the middle column’s margin guide. Posi-
tion the form widget with a 20px margin at 
the top and left  to the container.
The page contains the company’s contact details. Here we’ll be using yet another of the built-in widgets, the Con-
tact Form widget. This gives us a stylish way of adding a way for visitors to get in touch with the company with all

can make it as simple or detailed as we want, depending on the type of information we require back. We’ll also be 
taking a look at the social media widgets section. Here we have several buttons and panels for including Twitter 
likes, Facebook comments, and other useful sharing options.

Th e Form widget’s settings diff er from most of the oth-
ers as they are split between the overall form settings 
and the individual elements. We’ll look at the main set-
tings fi rst.

O Form name has two functions. Th e fi rst is used to 
distinguish between forms that exist on the same 
site. Th e second creates the subject line for the email 
that’s sent to the site owner. Th e name is initially 
taken from page name but can be changed to any-
thing. Here I’ve altered it to Contact via website.

O Email to is the email address where the submitted 
form is sent. Here I’ve set it to the company’s default 
email address sales@brightoncakecompany.co.uk.

O After Sending determines what happens when the 
form is submitted. Th e default is to stay on the page; 
a confi gurable message appears next to the submit 
button to acknowledge the form has been sent. We 
can also choose to display another page, a thank you 
message, for instance. Clicking the option gives us 
a choice of the site’s current pages and history. We 
can also enter one arbitrarily. We’ll use the default.

O Standard Fields are presets for the common fi elds 
we might have in a form, when enabled they are 
inserted into the form. Each has its own specifi c 
validation built in. BC CAPTCHA inserts the anti-
spam fi eld where the visitor is required to enter the 
sequence of letters which appears in the box above. 
Currently, this is only available when the site is 
hosted on the Adobe hosting servers.

O Add Custom Fields adds unique fi elds to the form 
allowing us to request information that’s not 
included in the presets. We have two options here: 
Single Line Text adds a plain fi eld the same as the 
default name and email fi elds. Multiline Text is the 
same as the default message fi eld, to gather longer 
data submissions.

O Edit together is the same as the other widgets, giving

Styling the form
Form elements can be styled in the same 
way as the other page content. Select the 
Name form fi eld item with the Selection 
tool. If we look at the States Panel we see 
that the element has fi ve states. Th e fi rst of 
these is Empty. Th is is the default look of 
the fi eld when the page fi rst loads.
 `We’ll style the labels fi rst. Click the Label 
item to select it. Use the Footer body style 
here. Change the Weight to Bold. All the 
labels now have this style.
I’ve also created a new paragraph style 
named Form labels. Th is prevents any 
unwanted changes if we decide to change 
the properties of either.
 `Next, we’ll change the look of the Empty 
fi eld state. Click the name’s text entry box 
to select it. Open the Fill options panel. Set 
the color to Warm Yellow. 
Lower the Opacity to around 40. We’ll 
leave the text color at its default gray. Set the 
Stroke color to Chocolate Brown.
 `Th e Non Empty state, as the name sug-
gests, is the look of the fi eld once the visitor 
has entered text. For this we’ll use the same 
yellow but increase the Opacity to 70.
Th is is enough to distinguish it, whilst 
keeping it subtle. Set the Text color to Choc-
olate Brown. Th e Stroke color is carried 
over from the previous state.

 `Th e next state is the Rollover. Th is is the 
same as the menu items and links. Th e fi eld 
changes as the cursor is hovered over it. 
Here we’ll use a watered down version of 
Mint Green. Set the Opacity to 40. 
Change the text style back to Italic. Again, 
set the Stroke color to Chocolate Brown.
 `Aft er the Rollover state comes Focus. Th is 
is the look of the fi eld when it’s selected, 
either via a click or tab. Here we’ll make it a 
darker version of the green. Set the Opacity 
to 70. Make sure the text style is Normal.
 `Now we have the fi elds styled as we want 
them, we can change the look of the submit 
button. Begin by setting the label. 
We can use the Form label style but we’ll 
need to make couple of changes. Set the 
Alignment to Center. Now change the Lead-
ing to 110%. Th is places it on the vertical 
center.
 `Th e fi nal state is Error. Th is is used to high-
light a problem when the form is submitted. 
Th is could be a mandatory fi eld that’s been 
left  blank, failed fi eld validation, etc. 
Th e default is to highlight both the fi eld 
and label text in red, as well as placing a red 
stroke around the fi eld. Th is works well so 
the only thing we’ll change is the Opacity of 
the fi eld color. Set it back to 40.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Th e Sumbit button has four states. Th ese 
are almost the same as menu items. Select 
the Normal state. Change the Fill color to 
Warm Yellow with an Opacity of 40. Set the 
Stroke color to Chocolate Brown. Th is is 
retained on all but the Submit in Progress 
state.
 `Next we have the Rollover state. Change 
the Fill color to Mint Green, changing the 
Opacity to 70. We’ll also use this for the 
Mouse Down state as we don’t need a sepa-
rate visual appearance for this.
 `Th e fi nal state is Submit in Progress. Set 
the Fill color to Warm Yellow with an Opac-
ity of 40. 
Leave the text at its default style. You’ll 
notice that there’s an extra text fi eld next to 
the button. Th is has its own states showing 
the progress of the submission. We’ll look 
at this next.
 `Click the text frame next to the button. We 
now have four more states showing. Ignore 
Normal. Select Submit in Progress. Apply 
the Footer body preset. Change the text 
style to Italic. Do the same for the Submit 
Success state. Change this to Footer body as 
well. Keep the style set to Normal.
Th e fi nal state is Submit Error. Th is is set 
to red, which is OK. Th e default caption is 
a little frightening, so we’ll alter it to the 
friendlier Sorry, there’s been an error sub-
mitting the form. Please try again later.

96
 `Now we have the form elements styled, we 
can add the necessary fi elds specifi c to the 
client’s request.
Open the Options panel. Enable the Cell 
Phone Number, Home Phone Number and 
BC  CAPTCHA options. Now click the Sin-
gle Line Text option twice. Th e fi elds will 
appear on the page. We’ll need to do some 
tidying up, of course.
 `Click the Home Phone Number item, 
making sure the entire Form Field object is 
selected. Drag it up between the Email and 
Message fi elds. Use the Spacing guides to set 
the correct distance. 
Th e form fi elds don’t automatically move 
to accommodate changes, so we’ll need to 
move the other items around ourselves. For 
now we can just move the Message fi eld out 
of the way.
 `Next we need to customize the two sin-
gle line fi elds we added. Th e fi rst is going 
to be for the visitor’s location. Click the 
Label item to change the text. For some 
reason Muse creates these items with a very 
large gap between the label and the input 
fi eld. Use the Selection tool to move them 
together. Th e presets have a 7px gap.
Do the same with the second item. Th is 
will be for the visitor’s post code (zip code 
for the US).
 `Do the same with the Cell Phone Number 
item. I’ve renamed it to Mobile Phone as this 
is a UK site.

 `To save a little space on the form we’ll 
place the post code fi eld next to the loca-
tion, since neither item’s information 
should be that wide. To do this we need 
to fi rst disable the Edit Together setting in 
the Form Options panel. Otherwise all the 
fi elds will resize at the same time.
Click the Location input fi eld. Drag the 
right edge in to shrink it down. I’ve used a 
width of 226px. Do the same for the Post 
Code fi eld. Th is time set it to 100px. Move 
both into position, side-by-side under the 
Mobile Phone fi eld.
 `Move the Message fi eld up beneath the 
Location and Post Code fi elds. Now move 
the CAPTCHA fi eld beneath the Message.
Th e last item is the Submit button. My 
preference is to have it aligned to the right 
of the form with a slightly larger gap than 
the rest of the items.
 `To fi nish the styling we need to alter the 
background container. Th e form width is 
more than enough so we’ll make the back-
ground narrower. Click and drag the right 
edge across to create an equal margin. 
Now drag the base of the frame up to 
just below the bottom of the submit button. 
Th is will also allow us more room to have 
information on the right hand side.
Testing the form
When we preview the form within Muse it’s not possible to actually submit the form data, we get an error 
dialog. The validation still works, however. This is useful for testing purposes, as we (or the client) don’t want 
to end up with tens of unwanted email messages. The form will work when previewed in the browser or when 
it’s published, of course.

 `We need to change some of the form 
elements’ settings to determine if they are 
required or not. We can’t change the Name 
and Email fi elds, but we need to make visi-
tors aware that they are required. 
Click the Name item to make it active. 
Open the Options panel to see the settings 
related to that fi eld. Enable the Message 
Text item.
 `Select the entire form and open the 
Options panel again. Enable the Edit 
Together option. Click the Required text 
box. Change the text to an asterisk and 
color it red. Set the Alignment to Left. 
Now move the frame over to the end of 
the fi eld’s label.
 `Enable the message text for the email fi eld. 
Th e size and color is already set as we are 
now adjusting the text boxes together. All 
we need to do is replace the text and move 
it into position, aligned with the fi eld above.
 `We don’t need the phone numbers to be 
mandatory so skip them. Make sure the 
Location, Post Code and Message fi elds are 
set to required. Enable their message text 
fi elds and adjust them accordingly. Th e 
CAPTCHA fi eld is mandatory by default, so 
add an asterisk to that, too.
 `As a fi nal step we’ll add a legend to the 
form. Grab the Text tool. Draw out a text 
frame at the bottom of the form area. Type 
in * Required fi elds. Apply the Footer body 
style. Change the color to red. Align the text 
to the left  edge of the form fi elds and the 
bottom of the Submit button.

Draw out a fairly large text frame. Type

it lines up with left  edge of the heading text.
 `Copy and paste the next line onto the page. 
Use the same settings as before but change 
the size to 14px. Stretch the frame to the 
same width as the previous text. Position it 
parallel with the top of the cake’s stand.

the form container. 
Stretch the frame out to the center of the 
right column. We see the red guide appear 
indicating that the text frame is aligned

 `Double-click inside the text frame to bring

 `Th e next box we’ll create is for a Google

Again, Muse has a built-in widget for this,

Start by drawing out a text frame below 
the previous box with an equal width. Leave 
a reasonable gap between the two.
 `Type in How to fi nd us for the heading. Go 
to the Paragraph Styles panel. Set the Con-

Selection tool to select the text frame itself. 
Apply the Container Graphic style.
Add a live map
Now to add the map. Go to the Social sec-
tion in the   Widget Library panel. Click and 
drag the  Google Maps widget over to the 
text frame. Th e initial size is far too large 
for our design. It does highlight an issue, 
though: the map is going to be too small 
when we scale it to fi t the container. Th is 
lets us see more of the surrounding area.
 `We’ll scale the map to better fi t the design. 
Drag the right side in, around a third larger 
than the container size will suffi  ce. 
Drag the bottom of the frame down so 
it’s just above the bottom of the form’s 
container, leaving space for the lower mar-
gin. Th e widget will refresh itself once we 
release the mouse.

We don’t want the map pointing to Adobe, 
of course. Click the map widget to select it. 
Open the Options panel. For the address we 
simply enter the company’s post code: BN2 
6TN. As soon as we press enter, the map is 
updates to display the new location. 
Th e pin information box is too wide to fi t

we’ll change the distance to zoom in closer 
on the area. A value of 15 is good.
 `Since we had to make the text frames 
wider, the page is biased to the right. We

Grab the Selection tool. Click and drag

Increase the header margin
Before we move on, we’ll make a couple of 
changes to the A-Master page. Go back to 
Plan mode. Double-click the A-Master page 
to open it in the Design mode.
Th e fi rst change is an adjustment to the 
space between the header and the content. 
We can do this by dragging the header 
guide down. It doesn’t need to be much, just 
enough to add more separation. Just below 
the bottom of the cake menus is ample.
Add a footer site map
Next, we’ll add a site map to the footer. Th is 
is useful for both search engine optimiza-
tion, and provides visitors with a secondary 
method of navigating the site.
Create a text frame in the third column of 
the footer. Stretch it to span the width of the 
column. We can align the bottom of the text 
frame to the base of the icons.
 `Open the text fi le sitemap.rtf in the Assets 
folder. Select and copy the entire block of 
text. Double-click inside the text frame we 
just created. Paste the text.
Highlight the heading. Apply the Footer 
Headings style. Now highlight the rest of 
the text. Apply the Footer Body style.
 `All we need to do now is convert the 
text to links. Highlight home. Go to the

the desktop and mobile layouts are uploaded. The code detects the visitor’s device and loads the relevant version. 
Mobile layouts should not be confused with responsive websites, however; Responsive layouts use style rules 
and called media queries to rearrange the layout dynamically.
In this chapter we’ll be working with the Phone layout, as this requires the most thought about how the site needs 
to be altered to suit the space restrictions. Mobile sites, especially layouts designed to display on phones, are gen-
erally pared down from their desktop counterparts, providing only the most useful information in an easily read 
and accessible way. As we’ll be largely working with the same content elements as we did with the desktop version, 
I’ll concentrate more on the implementation here, rather than the technical side of constructing the pages; unless 
there’s something new to discuss, of course.
Set up the workspace
Go to the Plan mode. Click the Phone tab 
in the Control panel. We see the Add Phone 
Layout dialog box. First is the Copy From 
menu. Th is gives us the option of None, 
where we would start with a completely 
fresh site, or our current desktop site. We 
want to base the mobile site on our current 
content, so we’ll choose the Desktop option.
 `We now have three options. Th e fi rst is to 
copy the site plan; uncheck this. Although 
we’re creating the mobile version with the 
same styling as the desktop version, we 
won’t be creating an exact replica, so we 
don’t want every page  ported over.
Note: copying the site plan only generates 
the page hierarchy; the page content is not 
imported from the desktop version.
 `We need to keep the Copy Page Attributes 
enabled, otherwise the dialog defaults to 
creating a blank site.
Check the  Copy Browser Fill option. A 
warning appears to tell us that the fi ll won’t 
be visible unless the page content is trans-
parent. Our site is based on fl oating content 
so we can go ahead and keep this option.

 `When we click OK Muse creates a new site 
plan for the Phone layout. We have a mas-
ter page and a home page, as we did when 
we fi rst began the desktop version. Th e only 
diff erence is we start off  with our striped 
background, rather than the plain gray. We 
could have chosen a blank site and set the 
fi ll manually, of course, but choosing to 
import the fi ll saved us a few extra clicks.
The master page
As before, we’ll start by designing the site 
master page. Double-click the A-Master 
page thumbnail to open it in the Design 
mode. Th ere’s no diff erence in the work-
space other than the page dimensions, of 
course, we still have all the same tools and 
formatting options as before.
 `As we borrowed the site properties from 
the desktop version, the home page is still 
set to be excluded from the menu. We need 
to make it available on the mobile layout. 
Right-click on the Home page thumbnail. 
Set the Menu Options to Include Page with 
Hyperlink.
Add the navigation
Th e fi rst step involves creating the nav-
igation. Th is needs to be as compact as 
possible, whilst keeping its functionality. A 
good way to collapse a lot of information 
into a small amount of space is to use the 
Accordion widget.
Go to the Widgets library. Drag the 
 Accordion over to the page. Use the Selec-
tion tool to align it to the top and stretch 
it out to fi ll the width of the content area. 
Remove its default stroke by setting the 
value to 0.

 `We only need one panel to accommodate 
the menu. Click the fi rst label to select it. 
Press Delete or Backspace to remove it 
from the widget. Do the same with the sec-
ond panel. We’re left  with the single panel.
 `Highlight the sample text frame in the 
content area and delete it. We don’t need 
the panel background so set its Fill to none. 
Th ere’s also a stroke applied. Change its 
value to 0.
 `Go to the Widgets Library. Open the 
 Menus section. We need a   vertical menu 
here, so drag it over to the empty content 
area in the accordion panel widget. Make 
sure it’s within the panel boundaries; the 
edges of the content area turn blue.
We can leave the menu settings at their 
default values. Click-drag the handles of the 
Menu widget to expand it, until it fi lls the 
entire content area of the Accordion. Now 
expand the menu frame to fi ll the whole 
width of the panel.
 `Th at’s the basics of the menu set up. We 
need to make a change to the accordion’s 
settings before we continue.
Select the accordion widget. Open its 
Options panel. Check the  Can Close All 
setting. If we don’t enable this, the menu 
would always be visible.

Style the menu bar
Th e next stage is to style the header and 
menu items. We’ll begin by dragging the 
bottom of the label frame down to increase 
its height. Bring it down to the Header 
guide. Th is will be suffi  cient space for 
someone to tap the menu button, without 
the menu bar encroaching too far into the 
content space.
 `Set the Fill color of the label to Warm Yel-
low. We’ll also remove the default stroke 
and replace it with a single line at the bot-
tom; this will help distinguish the menu 
and page content from the header. Set the 
Stroke width to 2px. Change the Stroke 
Location to Outside.
 `Go to the Paragraph Styles panel. Click 
the Main Menu style to set the font to the 
same style as the desktop menu. Change the 
text Alignment to Right. We’ll need to move 
the text away from the edge, so set the Right 
Margin value to 10. 
 `Create a new paragraph style named 
Mobile menu header. Th is will prevent any 
accidental changes to the desktop version. 
Grab the Text tool. Click to select the label 
text. Change it to Menu.

 `Touch devices don’t display the states in 
the same way as the desktop version; they 
cannot detect the visitor’s fi nger hovering 
over a button, for instance. To show that 
our menu has been activated (and subse-
quently deactivated) we’ll use the Active 
state. Select it in the States panel. Change 
its Fill color to Mint Green.
 `We can create a Graphic style here to 
apply to the menu items. Click the Normal 
state to make it active. Now click the New 
Style icon. Rename it Mobile menu. Th is 
stores the style attributes. All we need to do 
then is change the active state to green aft er 
applying the style.
 `Expand the menu (if it’s not open already) 
by clicking the accordion label. Drill down 
until the Menu Item is the active element. 
Click the Mobile menu graphic style to 
apply it. 
Change the Active menu state Fill to 
Mint Green. Now apply the Main Menu 
paragraph style. 
 `Now go to the States panel. Select the 
Rollover State. Click the Trash icon at the 
bottom of the panel to remove the state set-
ting. Do this for the remaining two items. 
Th is is a good technique to quickly unify 
the style of each state.
Keep tabs on your initial states
When you preview or publish the site, the initial state of the accordion, along with other widgets is taken from 
their current state in the design module. This isn’t always a problem, the accordion on the information page

the company name and logo. Place the fi le 
Mobile logo.png. It’s saved in the correct 
dimensions so click once to place it at its 
original size.
Position the logo vertically centered and 
on the left  side of the header, 10 pixels from 
the edge.
 `Everything looks great, until we open 
the menu. Because the image is a png with 
transparency, we see the whole of the green 
background.
Th ere is no way of selectively chang-
ing the accordion’s area without altering 
its content as well, so we’ll need to use a 
workaround.
 `Th e only part of the header we really need 
to see change is the area under the menu 
text. Th e rest can stay yellow. Grab the Rec-
tangle tool. Draw out a box aligned to the 
left , the same height as the header.
Resize the rectangle, expanding it out 
to the right, stopping just before the menu 
text, leaving an equal margin area. 
 `Remove the rectangle’s stroke. Now set 
the color to Warm Yellow. Go to the Object 
menu. Select Send Backward to move the 
box behind the logo.
Th is will keep the main part of the header 
yellow, as well as preventing the menu from 
opening by tapping any part of the bar.

Create the footer
 `Th e next part of the Phone layout involves 
designing the footer. Start by dragging the 
 Footer guide up. We’ll make it fairly wide 
for now, it can be adjusted later.
 `Grab the Rectangle tool. Draw out a nar-
row (21px) frame across the full width of 
the content area for the divider band we 
used on the desktop version. Align its top 
edge to the footer guide.
Remove the stroke and change the Fill to 
the dot image, horizontally tiled. Make sure 
the Footer option is enabled in the Control 
panel.
 `Create another rectangle frame for the 
footer area. Remove the stroke. Change the 
Fill color to Warm Yellow. As with the desk-
top version, we’ll drop the Opacity to 50%. 
Again, make sure it’s set as a footer item.

Pop-up information panels
Instead of having the company’s mission 
statement and contact details listed directly 
in the footer area, which would either take 
up a lot of space or be too small to read 
properly, we’ll create pop-up panels using a 
widget. Th is will give the mobile site a more 
app-like feel.
Go to the Widgets library. Drag a  Blank 
Presentation widget onto the page. Don’t 
worry about the placement just yet. Make 
sure it’s set as footer item. You can right-
click and select Footer Item from the menu 
that appears.
 `Open up the Options panel. Change the 
settings to the following (options not listed 
should be disabled):
Position: Scattered
Show target: On Click
Hide target: On Click
Transition: Fading
Transition Speed: 0.5 seconds
Hide All Initially: On
Triggers On Top: On
 `Click the left  trigger to make it active. 
Now select its target. Position the target 
container to align its top to the top of the 
footer divider. Drag the left  edge to be in 
line with the edge of the header logo. Now 
drag the right edge in to create an equal 
margin. We won’t adjust the height as we 
don’t yet know how much space we need 
for the content.
 `We’ll only need two buttons. Click on one 
of the triggers to select it. Now press Delete 
or Backspace to remove it from the widget.

116

 `Now we’ll set the position of the triggers. 
Click and drag the fi rst trigger to align with 
the left  edge of the target. Leave a small gap 
below the footer divider.
Do the same with the second trigger, 
aligning it to the right edge of the target. 
We can use the Smart guides to match the 
vertical position.
 `We’ll set up the left -hand button fi rst. Th is 
will be the company’s mission statement. 
Go to File > Place. Select the image about-
us-button.jpg. Click once to place it into the 
trigger frame. Th e image will be scaled to 
fi t. Use the cursor keys to nudge the image 
frame into position if necessary. 
 `To make it look more like a button we’ll 
add a rounded stroke. Make sure the 
object’s state is Normal. Change the Stroke 
color to Mint Green. Set the Stroke width to 
2. Now change the corner radius to 10. Set 
the location to Inside.
Make sure the states are all the same by 
selecting each remaining state in turn and 
clicking the Trash icon in the States panel.
 `Click the second trigger to activate its 
target area. Resize and position the frame 
as we just did. As we used the Scattered 
option, we’ll be able to set the height of the 
content independently.

the Slide Caption paragraph style.
 `Select the trigger item. Set the Fill to None. 
Remove the stroke by setting its value to 0. 
Set the other states to match. We can fi nish 
off  by fi ne-tuning the position of the label.
 `Now we’ll add the Contact panel. Place 
the  fi le contact-us-button.jpg into the right-
hand trigger. Add the green border as we 
did for the About us button.
 `We can make a duplicate of the About 
us label by holding Opt/Alt and dragging 
with the Selection tool. Change the text to 
Contact us. Now position it inside the right 
trigger. Finish off  by removing the stroke 
and background from the trigger.

The About Us panel
Let’s create the content for the two panels. 
We’ll start with the About us section. Click 
the trigger to make sure we’re selecting 
the correct object. Open the fi le About us 
mobile.rtf. Select and copy the whole block 
of text. Paste it into Muse. Use the Selection 
tool to drag it into the target area. Stretch 
the text frame out to fi ll the panel.
 `Highlight the heading text. Apply the Page 
caption heading style. Change the Align-
ment to Center. Set the Space Before value 
to 10 to create a margin at the top. Create 
a new paragraph style named Mobile info 
heading.
 `Now highlight the body text. Apply the 
Contact info box large style. Change the 
Alignment to -XVWLˉHG. Set the right margin 
to 10 to match the left . Create a new para-
graph style named Mobile info body.
Th e text has pushed the target panel 
down over the footer. We’ll be changing the 
style of the panel next.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Th e next step is to style the panel itself. 
Select the target container inside the Pres-
entation widget. Apply the Container style 
from the  Graphic Styles panel. 
We need to change the transparency as 
the panel will be overlaying the page con-
tent. Set the Opacity to 100.
 `To add a little more separation for the 
panel we can add a light drop shadow. Open 
the Effects settings. Select the Drop Shadow 
tab. Click to enable the shadow. Change the 
Opacity to around 35. Leave the rest of the 
settings at their defaults. 
Create a new graphic style named Mobile 
info panel.
 `Lastly, we need to reposition the panel. 
Make sure the target is the active object. 
Press the Up Arrow key to nudge the panel 
so it sits just above the top of the divider 
bar.
Even though the panel is in the content 
area, because we have the composition 
widget set as a footer item, it will always 
appear in this position relative to the page 
when viewed in a mobile browser.

120
The Contact Us panel
Now we’ll set up the Contact us panel. Click 
its trigger to make the object active. As we 
have the new panel style, we can apply it 
now so we have an idea of the space we have 
to place our buttons. Nudge the panel up a 
little by pressing the Up Arrow key a few 
times, as we did previously.
 `Create a text frame at the top of the panel. 
Drag it out to span the entire width. Type 
in Contact us. Now apply the Mobile info 
heading style. Th e height of the text frame 
will automatically expand to accommodate 
the text.
 `Now we’ll create the fi rst button. Draw 
out a large rectangle just below the heading. 
Stretch the width out, leaving a generous 
gap either side.
 `Set the Fill color to Warm Yellow. Increase 
the Stroke value to 4 to create a border. 
Change the Stroke color to Chocolate 
Brown. Set the Corner Radius to 10. Create 
a new graphic style named Big button.

 `Go to File > Place. Open the Email.png 
fi le.  Position the cursor just inside the top 
stroke of the button. Click and drag the 
graphic out to meet the inside of the bottom 
stroke. Add some space between the image 
and the text.
 `Hold Shift and click the text to add it to 
the selection. Drag the label and its graphic 
so they’re centered on the button.
 `Hold Shift again. Now click on the button 
to add it to the selected items. Hold Opt/Alt 
as well and drag the items down to create a 
duplicate of the whole button. Leave a large 
gap between the two. We need to ensure 
there’s enough separation to make it easy 
to press on the device so the visitor doesn’t 
activate the wrong button in error.
 `Select the email icon and delete it by 
pressing Delete or Backspace. Replace it 
with the Telephone.png image.
Double-click the text frame. Change the 
label to Call us. We’ll need to nudge the 
frame back a little with the Left Arrow Key 
to line the labels up.

Set up an  email link
We have our buttons so now we’ll set them 
up to perform the relevant action when 
they’re pressed.
Select the button rectangle. Open the 
Hyperlink menu in the Control panel. 
Type (or select the link from the list if it’s 
still there) sales@thebrightoncakecompany.
co.uk. Press Enter/Return to apply. Muse 
will automatically convert the link to an 
email link.
Set up a  phone link
Click the second button’s rectangle. Go 
back to the Hyperlink menu. Th is time, 
enter the company’s cell phone number: 
07954440092. Make sure there are no 
spaces or the link won’t work.
When we hit Enter/Return, Muse adds 
the tel: prefi x. Th is will prompt the mobile 
device to ask the visitor if they want to call 
the number; assuming the visitor’s device is 
capable of doing so, of course.
 `To fi nish off  the contact panel we’ll add 
the company’s business hours. We’ll need to 
add some space at the bottom of the panel 
so click and drag the bottom handle down 
a little. Draw out a text frame with a width 
equal to the button.
 `Set the paragraph style to Label Normal. 
Change the Leading to 120%. We can either 
type out the text here or, to speed things up, 
copy and paste the text from the desktop 
contact page.
Don’t forget to nudge the target object 
up to account for the additional space we 
added for the text.

In Preview mode Muse off ers us four preview sizes that correspond to popular cell phone screen dimensions,, so 
we can see how the mobile site will appear on a cross-section of devices. Left  to right we have the Phone layout 
preview using the Apple iPhone 4, the iPhone 5, the Samsung Galaxy SIII and the Nokia Lumia preview options. 
Th e preview size options will no doubt change or be added to over time, as new devices appear on the market.

 `Having completed designing the A-Mas-
ter page for the Phone layout, we can begin 
working on the mobile site content. Before 
we do, however, we need to hide the info 
panel, otherwise it will be shown on every 
page as the page fi rst loads.
Select the Composition widget. Open its 
Options panel. Uncheck the setting Show 
lightbox parts while editing. Th e panel will 
no longer be visible in the Design mode. It 
will still show and hide when the site is pre-
viewed and published.
The home page
Go back to the site plan. Double-click the 
home page thumbnail to open it in the 
Design mode. We’ll start by creating the 
slideshow; it will need to be slightly diff er-
ent for this version, of course.
Go to the Widget library. Drag the Blank 
Composition widget over to the page. It’s 
far too wide at present.
 `Click inside the target area to select it. 
Stretch the frame out to fi t the width of the 
page. Make sure it aligns right to the edge. 
Butt the top of the target up against the  
bottom of the header. Leave the height as 
it is for now.

Deciding on content height
We have to make a decision on height of the  
slideshow. If we make it too tall, the bottom 
of the content may not be visible on smaller 
screens. On the fl ip-side, if we make it too 
short, there’s will be a lot of blank space on 
devices with larger screens. Th is is why it is 
important to test the Phone layout as we are 
designing it, using Preview mode.
Looking at the iPhone 4 preview, it seems 
like we can add a little extra to the target 
area but we need to take the browser frame 
elements into account. Any larger and we’ll 
lose the bottom of the slides.
Th e triggers won’t be visible on smaller 
devices but since the slides will automati-
cally cycle, this isn’t too much of a problem. 
 `Delete two of the triggers. Highlight the 
remaining trigger. We’ll keep the trigger 
size the same but resize the trigger con-
tainer to make it square. Now we can use 
the graphic styles we defi ned for the trig-
gers on the desktop version.
Open the States panel. Set each with the 
corresponding style preset. Apply the same 
style to format the triggers for the Rollover 
and Mouse Down states.
 `Click the plus sign next to the trigger to 
create a new instance. Do this once more to 
create the third.
Click the middle trigger to make it active. 
Move it into the center using the Smart 
guides. Now move the two either side, leav-
ing ample space to be tapped by fi nger or 
thumb. In the sample project, they are 70 
pixels apart.
We’ll need to adjust the margin above the 
footer but we can do that later.

126

 `Now we can create the slide content. We’ll 
be using the same images as we did in the 
desktop version. Click the fi rst trigger to 
make it active.
Begin by placing the wedding cake image 
into the right side of target area. Scale it 
down to leave a small border at the top right 
and bottom.
 `Now place the fl ourished text and the 
confetti background. Remember to send 
the confetti object to the back so it displays 
behind the cake.
Now we’ll add the call to action but-
ton. Go to File > Place Photoshop Button 
(Cmd+B/Ctrl+B). Open call to action.psd. 
It’ll need to be a bit smaller than the desk-
top version so scale it down and move it 
into position centered vertically in the tar-
get and aligned to the center of the text.
 `Select the target container of the Com-
position widget. Remove the stroke and 
set the Fill to None. We now have the same 
transparent slide as we do on the desktop 
version. Repeat the process for  the next 
two target containers to fi nish setting up 
the composition.
A shortcut to place the button in exactly 
the same position is to copy it from the fi rst 
slide, then use Edit > Paste in Place on each 
of the others. We’ll return to set up the links 
from the buttons once we have added the 
rest of the pages in the Phone layout, using 
Plan mode.

 `Open the widget Options panel. Set the 
Transition to Horizontal. Enable Autoplay. 
Make sure Enable swipe is also checked. 
Th is allows the visitor to change the slides 
by swiping left  or right, as well as using the 
trigger buttons.
 `We’ll address the margin between the con-
tent and the footer. Go back to the A-Master 
page, either by going to the site plan, or by 
switching to its tab if it was left  open.
Drag the Footer guide up by a small 
amount to apply some separation. Go back 
to the home page to see the diff erence this 
has made.
 `Return to the master page, enable light-
box parts in the widget’s options. When we 
check the composition object’s hierarchy, 
it’s already at the top level. Th is is because 
the object order is made on a page-by-page 
basis. 
As far as Muse is concerned, the master 
content should be at the bottom level by 
default. Th is makes sense, of course, and is 
generally not a problem.
Fixing layout issues
Now that we have some page content it’s 
a good idea to see how our footer content 
looks. Go to Preview mode. Click either 
of the buttons to open its panel. We have a 
problem! Th e panel appears below our page 
content when  it should be overlaying it.

Working with layers
To rectify the problem with the info pan-
els, we’ll make use of Muse’s ability to work 
with content on layers. Open the Layers 
panel by clicking its tab in the docked panel 
set. Or choose Window > Layers.
Th e concept of layers may be familiar to 
you if you’ve used Adobe InDesign, Adobe 
Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. If you 
haven’t used them, imagine building the 
content on a series of stacked clear acetate 
sheets that can be hidden and reordered at 
any time.
Here we have a single layer, which con-
tains all of the master content. We can also 
see that the widgets have a sub-level hierar-
chy. We can drag the layers and sub-layers 
around to change their position – this is the 
same as using the Arrange commands from 
the Object menu, except it’s more visual. 
Th e Layers panel also lets us see and alter 
an object’s lock state and switch between 
the currently selected object.
 `To bring the panels to the front we fi rst 
need to create a new layer. Click the New 
Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers 
panel. Our new layer appears at the top 
of the stack as Layer 2. Currently it has 
no content, so there isn’t an arrow icon to 
expand the layer.
 `Muse lets us change the layer name and 
its label color. Th is is useful as there’s no 
thumbnail indication of  its content. 
Double-click the Layer 2 label to open 
the Layer Options dialog. Change the name 
to Info panels. We’ll leave its color as red; 
we’ll see why the color is important in due 
course. We can also set the overall visibilty 
of the layer and also lock all elements on the  
layer simultaneously. Click OK to apply.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Now we have our new layer, we can move 
our panel content. As with any applica-
tion, there are a few ways to do this. We’ll 
use the Object menu here. Start by clicking 
the Composition widget’s label at the top 
of Layer 1. Go to the Object menu. Select 
 Move To Layer > Info panels. We could also 
click and drag the object by its name onto 
the desired layer.
Aft er a brief pause, the widget disappears 
from Layer 1. Th e new layer now has an 
arrow next to the layer name, indicating 
the layer contains content. When we open 
it up, there’s our composition widget. Note 
that the widget’s frame border is now red. 
Th is tells us which layer the object is on. All 
the elements of the widget will also display 
a highlight border in red.
 `Set the widget option back to not display-
ing the lightbox parts to hide the panels. Go 
back to the home page. Th e Info panels layer 
is still at the top but we have no access to 
the content. Th is is because it’s part of the 
master page. Layer 1 is now for the content 
of the home page – here, it’s just the compo-
sition widget.
 `Switch to Preview mode again. When 
we click the info buttons, the panels now 
appear above the page content. Our slide-
show remains live, of course, and will keep 
cycling beneath the panel.
Although layers aren’t always essential 
in the creation of sites in Muse, there are 
times when a particular layout or effect is 
not possible without them. They can also 
be useful in the design process, as they give 
us the ability to hide parts of the content 
selectively if we’re working on a particu-

Now that we have sorted the problem with 
the panels we can continue on with the page 
content. Go back to the site plan. Click the 
plus sign on the right of the home page to 
create a new page. Name this Our cakes.
 `Double-click the new page to open it in 
the Design mode. We’ll begin by adding the 
page title heading. Grab the Text tool. Draw 
a text frame across the width of the page, 
leaving a small margin beneath the header.
 `Apply the Mobile Type style to the head-
ing text Our cakes. Th e style attributes 
center the text and create a margin below 
the header.
 `Instead of having separate pages for the 
cakes, we’ll create a tabbed panel with a sec-
tion for each type of cake. Each of these will 
have a short description along with a cut-
down slideshow.
Start by dragging the   Tabbed Panels 
widget over to the page. Align it to the far 
left  against the bottom of the text frame. We 
can leave the default settings.

 `Before we style the panels, we’ll remove 
two of the tabs. Drill down to the current tab 
object until the Selection Indicator displays 
the word Tab. Press Delete or Backspace. 
Do the same for the next tab. We’re left  
with a single set of a tab and its correspond-

 `Highlight the placeholder content in the 
content area of the panel and delete it. We’ll 
leave the width as it is for now, as the slide-
show widget will stretch it out to begin with.
 `Click the tab object to make it active. 
Make sure the active state is selected. Set the 
Fill color to Warm Yellow. Go to the Stroke 
settings. Set the Stroke color to Chocolate 
Brown. Enable the Corner Radius for the top 
left  and right corners to round off  the tab. 
 `Set the paragraph style to Sub Menu. Go

Choose Cabin Bold. Drag the bottom of 
the tab frame down to make it make a little 
taller. I’ve set it to 40px here.

 `Select the Rollover state of the tab. Change 
its color to Mint Green. Set the top corners

Do the same for the Normal state, setting 
the Fill to yellow. Th e Mouse Down state 
stays the same as the Rollover state.
 `Click the content area to make it active. 
Make sure the Normal state is selected as 
this dictates the style of the other states. Set 
the Fill color to Mint Green and lower the 
Opacity to 40%. 
Finally, go to the Stroke Width fi eld and 
type in 0. Th is overrides the individual 
settings, removing the default stroke com-
pletely.
Create the slideshow
Expand the  Slideshows section of the 
Widget Library. Drag the Blank Slideshow 
widget over into the content area. Leave 
a small margin on the left -hand side and 
below the tab.
We need to make some changes to 
the settings: set New Hero to Fit Content 
Proportionately. Make sure Autoplay is 
enabled. Uncheck all the options in the

Although the accordion widget should have been stretched to the full width of the page, at the time of writing

That’s the mobile site completed, which also concludes the overall design process. There is the tablet layout to

n this chapter we’ll be focusing on improving the ranking order of the 
site in the search results. As we’ll see, Muse has some great behind-the-
scenes tools for managing Search Engine Optimization (SEO), without the 
need to get buried in the code.

 Search Engine Optimization ( SEO) is one of the most talked-about things in the world of web-design, and with 
good reason. There’s no point spending time crafting a website, whether it’s for yourself or for your client, only to 
have it fail to appear in web searches.
It’s far beyond the scope of this book to explain every nuance of SEO, of course, that would easily be a book in 
itself, and I am not an expert on the subject. In this chapter we’ll be looking at the key concepts and how they 
DUHLPSOHPHQWHGLQ0XVH0DQ\DUHKDQGOHGDXWRPDWLFDOO\VXFKDVJHQHUDWLQJDVLWHPDS[POˉOHZKHQDVLWHLV
exported or published, and adding the detection code that redirects to the mobile layouts of a site. Others we 
need to spend a little time adding and tweaking our content.
Th ere are many things to consider when optimizing a site. Below is a list of the topics we’ll be covering.

O Page titles: the title that appears in the tab or window header of the browser.

O Site description and metadata: used for search-engine reference and displays in the search results for the site.

O Page URL structure: used for better site indexing.

O Content and adding keywords: helps search-engines fi nd relevant search terms on the site.

O Internal linking: makes it easier for search engines to index the site.

O Linking to social media: visitors posting links to the site will generate incoming traffi  c.

O Image titles: fi le naming and text descriptions to boost search engine visibility.
Although much of what we’ll be looking at here would generally be applied during site-building process, I felt it 
would be better explained separately to avoid too much information overload.
Setting the page titles
By default, Muse names the page titles 
based solely on the names we give them 
in the site plan. Th is is OK but it’s better to 
have a direct association, both for search 
engine crawling and visual identifi cation.
If we preview the site in the browser, 
there is no immediate indication of the 
site’s owner or company. It’s obvious if it’s 
the only site open in the browser, but peo-
ple oft en have more than one tab open at 
a time.
Muse gives us two ways of setting the 
page titles. Both are accessible from the 
Plan mode and also within the Design 
mode, depending on preference. It is easier 
to perform overall page-level amendments 
from the Plan mode, though.

The concepts and practicalities

145
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `We’ll begin by looking at setting the titles 
on an individual basis. Open the desktop 
site in the Plan mode. Right-click the Home 
page thumbnail. Select  Page Properties to 
bring up the Page Properties dialog box. 
If we were in the Design mode, we could 
choose Page > Page Properties. Click the 
Options tab to open it.
Here we see options to set the page name. 
Th is is how it appears in the site naviga-
tion; although in this instance the page is 
excluded from the menus. Beneath is the 
page title. Currently, this is set to be the 
same as the page name and is not an edit-
able fi eld.
 `Uncheck the box beneath the  page title: 
Same as Page Name. We can now edit the 
Page Title fi eld. Most sites have the name of 
the company as part of the title, oft en sep-
arated by a colon, hyphen or vertical line 
(oft en referred to as a pipe), which is my 
preference. 
It’s best to keep the title concise and 
relevant to the content. I’ve retained the 
original page name here; we could set it to 
anything, of course. Welcome would  be a 
good alternative. Click OK to apply.
 `When we preview the page in the browser 
again we can see how the page title provides 
a more descriptive title in the browser win-
dow. Th e company name will also picked be 
up by the search engines when they index 
the site, making the site more discoverable.
We could repeat this for every page in 
turn but there’s a better way. Since we want 
the company name on each page, we can 
have Muse append the title text automati-
cally. We’ll look at this strategy next. 

146
5
 `Right-click the master page thumbnail 
and select the Page Properties option from 
the menu that appears. Select the  Metadata 
tab. At the bottom of the window are two 
fi elds. Th e one we’re interested in is the Page 
Title Suffi  x. Anything placed in this fi eld 
will automatically be added to every page 
title on the site.
Type in the company name preceded by 
the vertical bar and a space – remember to 
add the space at the beginning, too, other-
wise there will be no separation from the 
page name. Click OK to apply.
 `We’ll need to go back to the home page 
properties and remove the title suffi  x we 
added. We can do this by simply checking 
the Same as Page Name option again.
When we preview the site in the browser, 
every page, including the two gallery pages 
we omitted from the menu, now have the 
company name appended to the name in 
the browser’s tab/title bar.
 `We’re still able to change the page names 
individually. For example, I decided to 
insert the word page to the name of the 
three wedding cake galleries. Muse still 
appends the text we set on the master page. 
Doing this doesn’t aff ect the name on the 
navigation menu, of course.
Before or after?
There is debate over which side of the separator the page name should be. I prefer to have the company/site

in the browser tab. It’s also good practice to keep the page titles short and descriptive. There is little or no 
difference in how search engines interpret the title, other than the order in which it appears in the results.

Add the page description 
Th e next task is to add a description for 
the page content. Th is is an important 
part of the SEO process, as it provides the 
search-engines with information about the 
site that can be matched to the search terms 
people are using.
Th e descriptions are created on a page-
by-page basis. We’ll begin with the home 
page. Open the page properties. Th is time 
click the Metadata tab.
 `Open the text fi le description metadata.
rtf. Copy and paste the paragraph under the 
Home heading into the  Description fi eld in 
the dialog box. Click OK to apply.
 `Do the same for the rest of the pages, using 
their respective paragraphs in the text fi le.
Th e rule of thumb with the description is 
to keep it short, with as much relevant con-
tent about the page as possible. Try to avoid 
simply duplicating the text for each page. 
Here I’ve made the text as unique as possi-
ble, with the exception of the three wedding 
cake pages,  
Th ere’s an unoffi  cial limit of around 160 
characters; there’s no penalty for using 
more but the resultant snippet in the search 
results will be truncated.
What, no keywords?
Although Muse provides a space for entering keywords in the metadata dialog, there is little point in spending 
time entering them. Google and most other search engines no longer use keywords metadata as part of the

Amend the URL structure
Another method that search engines use to 
index the site is by the page  fi lenames. As 
with the titles, Muse uses the page names to 
generate the fi lename. 
Open the home page properties. Click 
the Options tab. We see the fi lename is 
index.html. Th e option to change it is dis-
abled, however. Th is is intentional: Index 
is the default page that web browsers look 
for when you type in the site address, if it 
wasn’t present, we would have to specify the 
start page each time, so Muse prevents us 
from altering it.
 `Most of the fi lenames can be left  as they 
are, since they adequately describe the con-
tent. Th e only alteration I wanted to make 
was to  insert the word gallery into the 
names of the image slideshows. Th is adds 
another useful keyword into the mix.
Setting the fi lename is the same as we did 
with the titles: uncheck the Same as page 
name option. Type in the new name sepa-
rated with hyphens. 
Click OK to apply the changes. Muse 
automatically updates the site content links 
with the new page name. Repeat this for the 
remaining gallery pages.

Content and  keywording
Th e most prominent data to be picked up by search engines is the site content itself. Writing copy that’s relevant, 
and scattered with a healthy amount of keywords helps ensure the site is indexed correctly, of course. It’s worth 
going through the site a couple of times to see if there’s anything that could be changed in order to raise the page’s 
profi le. Ask a friend to throw some ideas at you; they may come up with a few terms and synonyms you didn’t 
think to include. 
It’s worth noting that pushing the content too hard can have a negative eff ect. Overuse of keywords can be seen 
by search engines as spamming, as can intentionally placing misleading or irrelevant content. At best this would 
send you down the rankings. At worst, the site could be permanently excluded from the search results. Having text 
that reads “Come to the Brighton Cake Company. We make great cakes, eat our cakes, enjoy our cakes”, apart from 
sounding a little crass, clearly overuses the word cakes and could be marked down as a result. 
If we paraphrase the text with something like “At the Brighton Cake Company we take pride in our beautifully 
designed creations and know that you will fi nd them just as delicious to eat as they are to behold”, we now have a 
sentence with similar intent, without cramming in the same word repeatedly.
When somebody searches Google for a site like ours, that short sentence now potentially yields the terms Brighton, 
cake, beautiful(ly), design(ed), creations, delicious, eat and behold – depending on who’s doing the searching, of 
course. It’s also important to think about the company’s demographic: who is the target audience for the company’s 
services? Using plenty of synonyms in the copy helps to make sure you appeal to as wide an audience as possible. 
Keep that thesaurus nearby!
Create heading styles
As well as rich content, search engines 
pick up on headings, particularly if they’re 
explicitly defi ned using  HTML tags. We can 
do this right inside the Muse workspace.
Open the fi rst wedding cake gallery 
in design mode. Th e specifi c page isn’t 
strictly necessary but seeing the position 
and prominence of the text helps us decide 
how to set the tags. Th e page headings are  
obviously the most important. Go to the 
Paragraph Styles panel. Double-click the 
Page Caption Header to open the Paragraph 
Styles Options.
Use the menu next to the Paragraph Tag 
section to select Headline (h1).  H1 is used 
to defi ne the most important information 
on the page. All instances of the heading 
across the site will now use this header tag.

150

 `As well as the main headline tag, we 
have  fi ve more sub-heading tags. Th ese 
are hierarchical,  H2 being of second-most 
importance to H1 and so on.
Th e next level we’ll defi ne is the Footer 
Headings style, since it’s used not only for 
the footer but also in the information boxes 
on the home page and elsewhere on the site.
Double-click its label to open the set-
tings. Set the Paragraph Tag menu to 
Subhead (h2).
 `Th ere are additional opportunities where 
we can apply paragraph tags to paragraph 
styles we’ve set up previously. Th e styles 
applied to the accordion labels, Label active 
and Label Normal, can be set to H3. 
We also have a rogue heading style, Con-
tact info box heading, on the contact page. 
We can set this to H2 as we did with the 
footer heading.
 `We must not forget our mobile site, of 
course. Th ere are fewer styles to set there 
but they’re still just as relevant to search 
engines as they are on the desktop version.
Set Mobile info heading to H1. We can 
also add the tab and accordion titles. Th ese 
use the desktop style of Sub Menu. Set this 
paragraph tag to H3 as well. Click OK to 
save your changes and close the dialog box.

 `We’ll start with setting a style for italics. 
Open the fi rst wedding cakes page. High-
light the italicized company name. Go over 
to the  Character Styles panel. Create a new 
style. Double-click its label to open the 
Character Style Options. Set the name to 
Italics. Now drop down the Span tag pick-
list and select Emphasis (em). 
Although this has no visible eff ect on 
the page, behind the scenes, the code is 
changed to alter the way the style is applied 
by wrapping the characters with the <em> 
HTML tags.
 `Th e same technique can be applied for 
emboldened text. We’ll use the content of 
the information page to defi ne the style.
Highlight the word Lemon at the start 
of the ingredients list. Create a new char-
acter style as before. Double-click to open 
its properties. Name the style Bold. Open 
the span pick-list. Set this to Important 
(strong). In the background this will now 
have the HTML tag of <strong>, which will 
have a better chance of being indexed by 
search engines.
 `All that we need to do now is go through 
the remainder of the site highlighting the 
text and applying the styles where required.
Th ere’s no guarantee that doing this will 
have a huge impact on the statistics but it’s 
certainly worth putting the time in.
&UHDWHVW\OHVWRGHˉQHNH\SKUDVHV
To further help search engines pick up on keywords and phrases within the text, we can use character styles to 
defi ne particular types of HTML tag, which draw attention to the content using the same strategy as the heading 
tags. Th ere are several to choose from, some have more specifi c uses. Here we’ll be looking at the two most com-
monly used: Italics and Bold (in HTML this translates to  <em> and  <strong>).

 `Adding links to the text may require a 
slight rewrite in order to make the link 
relevant. Here, I’ve edited the intro to the 
wedding gallery so I can place a link to the 
contact page.
It can be useful to set an entire section 
of the text as the link, rather than just the 
page name. Th is gives it more of a sense of 
purpose to the visitor, as well as squeezing 
in some more valuable keyword content to 
be indexed.
 `We can also add more content in order 
to make linkable text. I’ve tacked on a sen-
tence about ingredients and portion sizes so 
we can guide the visitor to the information 
page. Th e more oft en a page is visited, the 
more potential it has to feature higher in the 
search result rankings.
Remember to duplicate the new version 
and to copy it to the rest of the wedding 
cake pages.
 `Links can also be more concise, of course. 
We can create links to the diff erent types of 
cake wherever they are mentioned in the 
text. Th ey are all useful for both the search 
engines and for guiding the visitor around; 
people may pay more attention to inline 
links whilst they are reading the text.
Once applied across the rest of the site, 
including the mobile version, we should be 
able to generate better page views.
Internal  linking
Internal linking is the practice of setting up hyperlinks to other pages within the site. Having additional links 
makes it easier for search engines to crawl the site and, since links are what search engines provide, it helps them 
to build up a more comprehensive map of the site. We’ve already provided internal links with the site map in the 
footer and the call to action buttons on the home page slides but we can go further. We can also place links in the 
body text to guide both the search engines and our visitors to relevant areas of the site.

Using  VRFLDOPHGLDWRJHQHUDWHWUDIˉF
A good way of bringing traffi  c to the site is to give people the option to link the pages to social media. We already 
have the social media buttons in the footer but they may only be a one-way street; there’s no guarantee that visitors 
will share the site in return. 
Muse has built-in button widgets to most of the popular social media sites. We only need to put the buttons on 
certain pages; there’s no point in posting a  Facebook like to the contact page or having people adding the informa-
tion page to  Pinterest. We’ll add them to the home page and the cake galleries.
 `Open the Desktop layout of the home 
page in Design mode. Go to the Widget 
Library. Expand the Social section. Drag 
the Pinterest widget over to the page. Place 
it just below third info box, aligning it to the 
left  corner of the box.
Th ere’s no setup for required for this 
version of the widget, it simply creates an 
overlay on the page showing the available 
images the visitor can pin.
 `Next we’ll add the Facebook like button. 
Drag it over to the page. Line it up with 
the Pinterest button, leaving a small gap 
between the two.
By default the button only shows whether 
or not the individual person has liked the 
page. Open its Settings panel. Change the 
layout to Button count. Th is will now show 
the total number of likes. Leave the URL as

ingly, using the phrases delightful seasonal 
cakes and spectacular celebration cakes.

Targeting your demographic
It’s well worth pausing to think about where your site is going to get its biggest audience,  and not cluttering 
the page with too many buttons and links. Our cake company may do really well on Pinterest, as there is a 
large community of makers and crafters, predominantly female, who could be more interested in the content. 
Places such as Google Plus might not necessarily reach the intended audience. Muse makes it so easy to

are getting the most visitor interaction. Take care to remove the social media buttons that are not being used by visitors, 
particularly if they have a counter attached, as the Facebook and Twitter buttons do.

 `To add a description to an image, right-
click on the image frame (one of the home 
page images here) and select Edit Image 
Properties from the menu. Th e Image 
Properties dialog box appears, displaying 
two fi elds. Th e fi rst is the  tooltip, this shows 
when the cursor is hovered over the image. 
We can use this for a brief description.
Th e second is our alt text. We can write a 
short description of the image here, includ-
ing as many keywords as possible, of course. 
Keep the sentence fairly short and relevant 
to the image it’s describing.
 `We’ll continue adding descriptions to 
all the main images on the site, including 
the site logo and heading banners on the 
information panels. Th ere’s little point in 
repeating myself and listing them all here; 
I’ve added everything to a text fi le named 
image descriptions.rtf in the assets folder.
When it comes to adding the descrip-
tions to the slideshow images, remember to 
duplicate the text on the thumbnails as well 
as the hero images. Unfortunately, Muse 
doesn’t do this automatically.
Adding descriptions to image content
One part of a website that oft en gets overlooked when it comes to search engine optimization is its images. Th e 
fi rst thing we’ll look at here is the  alt text. Th is serves several purposes: if an image doesn’t download properly, or 
in certain situations where the visitor may have disabled images in the browser, the alt text is shown in the place-
holder.  Th e text is also used to describe the image when screen-readers are used, oft en by the visually impaired. 
Lastly, the text is indexed by search engines, so we are able to sprinkle a few keywords in to help get our site seen.
Just like the fi le names of the pages themselves, the names of the images are also indexed by search engines. It’s 
easy to select a batch of images from a folder to add to a slideshow but not really pay any attention to their fi le-
names. Th ere are tens of thousands of pictures on the web named IMG_xxx.jpg and the like, but far fewer, if any, 
called seasonal-cake-easter-chicken.jpg! Th e key assets for the site are already named but we’ll see here what needs 
to be done if we rename a fi le aft er it’s been placed.

I mentioned using keywords for image fi lenames in the introduction to this section. Th is would normally be done 
before they are added to the page, of course. It’s easy to forget to do this, or miss the odd fi le in a large batch when 
you’re under pressure to fi nish the site. 
Th ere are two ways of renaming fi les: the fi rst is to simply remove the image from the page and replace it with 
the correctly named fi le. Th is is OK if they’ve been placed as a whole with no adjustments but if we’ve cropped, or 
adjusted the image, or it’s a single instance within a large slideshow, it can be a lot of work to remove and restore 
it in the layout, as well as needing to add the image properties text descriptions and tooltips again. It’s much more 
effi  cient to rename the fi le that’s currently in use and update its asset details.
 `To illustrate this I’ve kept the original 
fi le names of the four images on the Our 
Services page. Open the Assets panel by 
choosing Window > Assets or by clicking 
the Assets tab in the docked panel set.
If we click to activate the fi rst images, it 
will be highlighted in the list. We can see 
this is called A6556997-Edit.jpg: not the 
most common of search terms. 
 `Right-click on the fi le in the list. Select 
Reveal in Finder (or Windows Explorer 
for Windows). Th is will take you to the 
fi le location in the site’s asset folder on the 
computer. Rename the fi le to fl oral-face-
cake-with-butterfl ies.jpg.
 `When we return to Muse, the item in the 
Assets panel still shows the original fi le 
name with a red warning icon. Th is indi-
cates that it cannot fi nd the original fi le. 
Th ere is no automatic link between the two.
Search engine optimization

157
C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `To fi x this, right-click on the asset again. 
Select   Relink. Browse to the folder where 
the fi le is stored. Select the newly renamed 
fi le. Click Open. Th is updates the asset link. 
We now see the item in the Asset panel 
with its new name. Th e red warning icon is 
no longer displayed.
 `We can change the fi lenames outside of 
Muse, of course. If we do this before open-
ing the site project, we may see a warning 
dialog to tell us there are missing fi les. We 
will also see them in the Asset list with the 
question mark symbol. We simply repeat 
the previous step to relink the fi le(s).
It is possible to multi-select batches of 
fi les to relink but they will not be actioned 
as a whole; a new fi le dialog will appear 
for each fi le. Th is can become confusing if 
there are many instances. If the wrong fi le 
is chosen, the asset will be replaced with it.
That more or less wraps up this chapter. It’s worth going over the site and its assets again to 
ensure that we’ve covered every possible angle. There is much more to learn about search-en-
gine optimization in general, of course; there are numerous books on the subject and a wealth of 
information on the web. Links to useful resources can be found on the book’s accompanying website. 
In the next chapter we’ll be nearing the conclusion of the project, where we will be looking at publishing the site 
to the web and setting up access so the client can edit sections of the site themselves.

Publish to Adobe hosting
Th e most seamless way to publish the site is 
to publish it directly to the Adobe hosting 
servers. To do this we simply need to click 
the Publish button in the Control panel 
or select File > Publish. Th e fi rst time this 
is invoked, we’re presented with a blank 
canvas. Th ere are fi elds for the site name 
with additional options for selecting the 
publish location and data center; these 
are generally left  to the defaults, as Muse 
handles them automatically.
 `Th e name we give the site here sets the 
trial site’s URL, which determines how it 
will be accessed before we assign its fi nal 
domain name. 
All trial sites published in Muse have a 
URL with a  sub-domain of Business Cata-
lyst, we’re sharing it with everyone else, so 
the name must be unique. I’ve used bright-
oncakeco; this will need to be altered for 
the trial site you publish, of course. As we 
enter the name, the URL is automatically 
updated. If the name we chose is already in 
use, Muse will append a number suffi  x.
 `Click OK to start the publish process. Th e 
fi rst thing Muse will do is create the tem-
porary site on the Adobe hosting servers 
– an email massage will be sent to the email 
address associated with your  Adobe ID to 
confi rm this.
Once that’s done, the site pages and assets 
for both the desktop and mobile versions 
will start to upload. Th is may take a while in 
the fi rst instance, since all of the site’s assets 
and fi les must be published.
We’ve reached the point where we can publish the completed site to the web for all to see. There are two ways

uploading them manually using a separate FTP application. We’ll be looking at both methods here.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
Third-party hosting
If you or your client already have a hosting 
plan with a third-party hosting provider, 
you can publish the site there instead. 
Choose File >   Upload to FTP host (key-
board shortcut: Opt+Cmd+F/Alt+Ctrl+F). 
We have a slightly more complex dialog 
here than with the Publish dialog box.
 `Assuming everything goes well, the web 
version of the site will open in the default 
browser. Muse also displays a Publish Com-
plete message to confi rm the site has been 
published. Here we have the options to 
invite people to be in-browser editors and 
also to associate a domain name with the 
site – more on this later in the chapter.
Both of these tasks can be done through 
the Adobe Muse Dashboard, so we could 
turn the dialog off  by checking Don’t show 
again, if this message becomes irritating.
 `Aft er the site has been published initially, 
the dialog options change for subsequent 
uploads. Th e default Publish To option for 
trial sites in Muse is set to use the .busi-
nesscatalyst.com sub-domain. Th is can be 
changed, of course. We can also choose to 
publish to a sub-folder of the domain.
Th ere is a new Upload menu. Th is deter-
mines which fi les will be published to the 
site. Th ere are two options. Th e fi rst, and 
default setting, is Only modifi ed fi les. Th is 
is only uploads the fi les that have changed 
since the last time we published the site. 
Th is is the quickest method. Th e second 
is All fi les, which publishes everything, 
overwriting everything on the site. Th is is 
helpful when you have made a great deal of 
changes and want to update the entire site 
on the host servers.

162

 `Th e Host Directory fi eld is generally left  
blank, as the majority of hosting companies 
work on a single site per domain basis. 
Some hosting providers, such as Dream-
hosts, use sub-folders to defi ne individual 
sites, so we would enter the folder name 
in this fi eld, brightoncakeco, for example. 
Check with your hosting provider for their 
specifi c setup details.
Th e next two fi elds are for the hosting 
account’s FTP login details.
 `Th e Upload option is the same as we have 
for publishing to Adobe hosting servers. As 
there is no direct link to a third party host, 
we always have both options; the fi rst pub-
lish operation is always All fi les, of course.
Th e  Store Credentials option tells Muse to 
save the site details, including the login, to 
avoid having to type it in each time. Click 
OK to save your changes and begin the 
upload process.
 `Th e fi rst fi eld,  Domain Name, is required 
for associating the site to the Typekit fonts, 
the sitemap.xml fi le Muse generates for 
search engines and also to query the host’s 
ability to run PHP scripting for the forms.
We would normally have a domain name 
associated with the hosted space but if the 
site’s domain name has not been registered 
yet, this fi eld will accept a placeholder name 
in the interim.
Th e  FTP Host fi eld is the address where 
Muse will upload the site. Again, this is usu-
ally a derivative of the site domain but the 
IP address can also be used.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Something to bear in mind if you’re 
uploading the site to a third-party host is 
form compatibility. Aft er uploading to my 
host, I had the following dialog. I expected 
to see  the warning about the CAPTCHA 
fi eld, since it’s currently only supported on 
Muse sites hosted on the Adobe hosting 
servers.
Th e second warning is because I’m using 
the company’s current domain name, which 
is being hosted on a non-supported plat-
form; it’s unlikely that this would happen 
with a standard hosting platform. Again, 
if you have questions, you would need to 
consult your hosting provider for specifi c 
details about your hosting account.
 `Aft er a short time, the entire site is cre-
ated within the folder we specifi ed. As 
before, Muse will display a warning about 
the CAPTCHA fi eld in the form if it’s not 
removed beforehand.
Export as HTML
Choosing  Export as HTML (Cmd+E/Ctrl+E) 
doesn’t upload the site, instead it outputs the 
HTML fi les and assets to a custom-named 
folder on your computer. 
You might use this option if you are 
unable to connect directly to your server 
through Muse. Th is might be due to com-
pany fi rewall restrictions, in which case 
you can use a separate FTP application to 
upload the fi les. You could also copy the 
fi les to CD or USB to send on to someone 
to upload the fi les themselves.
Click the location folder icon to change 
the destination. Be sure to create or spec-
ify a folder as Muse doesn’t create one by 
default. Click OK to start the export process.

to host, so you will need to read the documentation on their site or contact them directly to get details about 
your hosting account.
The Muse  dashboard
Th e only way to open the site management 
tool from within Muse is to click  the Manage 
button in the Control panel. A new tab or 
window opens in your default browser. Th is 
is the site management dashboard. Th e left  
column displays navigation to access areas 
of the dashboard, and on the right is an 
at-a-glance  analytics and statistics display.
 `In the middle section of the dashboard 
we have the web hosting information. Th is 
tells us what hosting plan we are using. In 
this case it’s Free Site, the standard package 
we get with either the 30 day trial or paid 
subscription of Muse. Th e Site Plan section 
displays a button marked:   Launch Site. 
At present our site is private; the only 
way it can be seen is if we send somebody 
the trial site’s URL. Th is is fi ne all the way 
through the design and testing phase when 
we can show the client the site’s progress but 
no good when we want the world to see it.
 `Clicking the Launch Site button opens 
the Launch Site dialog box. We can see 
how many site hosting credits we have left . 
I have 4 out of the 5 that come with the full 
Creative Cloud subscription. 
At the time of this writing, a standalone 
subscription to Muse includes one site 
hosting credit. Additional sites can be pur-
chased separately, by entering a credit card 
and paying a monthly fee.  Click the Launch 
Site button.

 `Another dialog appears to confi rm that it’s 
now live. Currently, although the site is now 
visible on the web, the trial site is still using 
the same .businesscatalyst.com sub-domain 
address. Our next task is to assign a regis-
tered domain name.
Th is part of the setup can only be done if 
you have a domain name to add, of course. 
You’ll need to register a domain name with 
a site registrar and pay a yearly fee to use it, 
when  setting up your own sites.
 `Clicking the  Add a Domain button opens 
the Associate Existing Domain dialog box, 
that contains a single fi eld where we enter 
the domain name. Th is will need to be 
pre-registered with a domain registrar.
 As the company already has a registered 
domain name, I’ll be using it here. Th e 
www prefi x can be omitted. Clicking Save 
adds the domain.
 `Once the domain name has been added, 
the  nameserver details need to be set up 
so the domain points to the site. A dialog 
appears with the DNS information for the 
Adobe hosting servers. 
Information on how to set up the  DNS 
records for some of the popular domain 
hosting companies can be accessed by 
clicking the read more link in the dialog. 
Alternatively, you can refer to the support 
section of your domain registration compa-
ny’s website. Click Close.
 `Our new domain appears in the list of 
domains associated with the site. Note that 
we have two versions of the company’s 
domain name: the fi rst has the www prefi x, 
this is the  primary URL. Th e second is a 
redirect. Th is allows visitors to get to the site 
both with and without the www prefi x. Th e 
remaining entries are the internal addresses 
used by the Adobe hosting servers.

166
 `Th e default error page provided by the 
server is generally plain and unfriendly, 
and in some cases has no links back to the 
site content; this can be confusing and may 
result in losing page traffi  c. 
We can create a custom 404 page that fi ts 
the theme of the site, with all the navigation 
included, so visitors can fi nd their way back 
to the content they want to view. Even if the 
requested page no longer exists, it’s likely 
that the content may have moved to a new 
page during a site redesign. 
Design the 404 page
Muse doesn’t have a built-in method of 
creating custom  404 pages, so we need to 
be a little creative. We’ll begin by creating 
a new page to the top level of the site plan. 
I’ve added it to the right of the contact page. 
Name the page 404. We don’t want the page 
showing up on the menu, of course. Right-
click its thumbnail and select  Exclude Page 
From Menus.
Although visitors will usually navigate the site using the top-level menus or links in the footer, they may also 
bookmark pages to return to the site later. This is not a problem until the page name changes or it’s removed 
completely. When this happens, the site displays an error page, commonly known as a ‘404’ page, as that’s the 
server error code for a page not found.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Th e page will be similar to the Th ank You 
page we created earlier in the book. Open 
the new page in Design mode. Go to File > 
Place. Open the image page-not-found-png. 
Resize the image and position it so its frame 
aligns to the outer page margins and sits on 
the Footer guide.
 `We’ll start by adding the heading text. 
Grab the Text tool. Change the typeface 
to Alex Brush. Set the Size to 72. Set the 
color to white. Change the text Alignment 
to Center. Draw out a text frame next to the 
cake stand. Type Oh dear!
 `Now we’ll add the text for the error mes-
sage. Draw out another text frame below 
the heading. Change the typeface to Geor-
gia. Set the Size to 20px. Type out the text: 
Th ere’s something missing. 
Please see the menus or the sitemap below to 
fi nd the page you were looking for.
Th at’s the page completed. Before we move 
on, we must publish the site again. Th is 
ensures that the image and CSS styles are 
present on the site.

 `Click  Site Manager on the sidebar. We 
now see a few more settings. Select  System 
pages. We have two options here. Click the 
404 Page Not Found link. Th is takes us to 
the admin page for the default 404 page.
Import the page code
We need to replace the current page content 
with the page we just created. Go back to 
Muse. Make sure the 404 page is open. Go 
to File >  Preview Page in Browser.
We need the raw HTML code for the 
page. To do this we need to display the 
page source. Th is varies from browser to 
browser; for Safari go to the Develop menu 
and select Show Page Source. Highlight the 
entire block of code by pressing Cmd+A/
Ctrl+A. Right-click in the window and select 
Copy to save it to the clipboard. 
Enable online editing
We need to make a change in the Muse 
Dashboard to allow us to add the page 
content. Click the  Manage link in the Con-
trol panel to launch the Muse Dashboard 
in the browser. Hover over your name on 
the right of the toolbar. Choose My Details. 
Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Now 
check the box next to  Enable online content

Although the option mentions that it’s 
incompatible with Muse, this is only a 
warning that any changes made in the con-
sole will not be synchronised with the local

Add a  site user
Adding site users is done via the Muse Dash-
board, which can be launched from within 
Muse either from the Manage option on 
the toolbar, or by selecting   Add In-Browser 
Editing User from the File menu. Users can 
also append /admin to the site address in 
the browser. From here we can either click 
the Invite customers link from the dash-
board, which takes us directly to the setup 
panel, or from the Admin Users section of 
the Site Settings menu (shown here). Th is 
option shows us all users of the site, cur-
rently this is only the site designer.
 `Click the  Invite Admin User button. A new 
panel opens containing the setup details. 
First we have the email address, this must 
be valid as it’s where the user’s invitation is 
sent. Th is is followed by the person’s fi rst 
and last name, which will be how the user 
appears in the console. We can also add the 
person’s cell phone number, this is optional.
Th e fi nal section is the  User Roles. Th is 
determines what the person can do both on 
the site and within the admin console. Th e 
Users role has been designed to allow most 
site editing functions and access to the site’s 
visitor and usage statistics. If you’re adding 
another designer to work on the site, use 
the Administrators role.
One sought-after feature when creating sites is giving the client the ability to edit the content. Although Muse

or Drupal, it does allow the client to alter text and replace images across the site, via the Muse Dashboard, using 
any browser with an Internet connection. Here we’ll be looking at how to set up site users and how the editing 
system works.
Check your custom URLs
It’s important to make sure the default site domain address is valid, as that is where the link in the email invi-
tation will lead. If the custom domain has not fully registered, or is still pointing to another host, the person 
won’t be able to sign up. If in doubt, we can remove the custom domain temporarily using the site domain 
management tools; the link will be set to use the original trial site address.

Apart from having the dashboard inter-
facebar at the top and a new bar at the 
bottom, there appears to be no diff erence 
between this and the normal view of the 
live site.

Change the  text
We’ll begin by editing the content of the 
What’s new section. Use the Edit button 
or click inside the blue rectangle. Th e Edit 
Content dialog with the text from the text 
frame appears in front of the rendered site.
We can amend or change the text as we 
see fi t, although care needs to be taken as to 
how much text is added. Th e way these text 
frames are constructed means that the text 
spills out, rather than pushing the content 
down as it does when you edit the site in 
the Muse workspace. Th is can be remedied 
by changing the layout, of course.
It’s in our interest as designers to instruct 
new users that they should attempt to 
match the amount of new content to avoid 
layout problems.
 `Click the Update button to apply the 
changes. Th e content of the text frame 
updates to display our new text. Th is won’t 
show up on the live site yet, however, what 
we see here is a cached version of the page, 
we can make as many alterations as we like 
before publishing the changes.
Replace an  image
Th e next change we’ll make is the image in 
the What’s new section as it was only rel-
evant to the original text. Th is highlights 
one of the constraints of the editing system, 
we’re not able to remove image frames, only 
change them. 
Click the Edit button or click the image. 
Th is time, instead of an Edit Content dia-
log box, the Edit Image dialog box appears. 
From here we can either choose one of the 
existing images on the site, or upload one 
from the computer. Th e cropped face works 
well. Click Update to apply the changes.

 `Th e Events section also needs amending. 
Th e original content is made up of two 
frames. Click to edit the top frame. Don’t 
delete the existing text, though.
Currently, there’s no way of adding a style 
to text within the Edit Content dialog box. 
We can, however, use the existing styles 
applied to page content. Highlight the date. 
Now replace the text with Cake Classes. 
Although we don’t see any diff erence now, 
when we update it, the text frame will 
inherit the bold styling. Add the remainder 
of the text and click Update. 
 `Th e only thing we can do with the second 
block of text is delete its content. Again, this 
will need to be altered in Muse to allow for 
proper editing by the user.
Click Update apply the changes. Th e sec-
ond block is gone and we can see the Bold 
style has been applied to the sub-heading. 
Th is workaround works with almost all the 
text styles, including pre-defi ned paragraph 
and character styles.
Publishing the changes
Before we can move on to edit more of 
the site we need to publish the current 
changes – Muse will warn us if we attempt 
to navigate away from the page or close the 
browser window. Click the Publish button 
at the bottom of the page. Aft er a short time 
a panel will display a message confi rming 
that the changes are live.
We can click the Preview mode button on 
the toolbar to make sure the changes were 
applied to the site.

Edit alternate versions
As well as the main desktop pages, we can 
also edit the mobile versions of the site. To 
switch to the phone layout, use the Devices 
menu at the top of the window. Th e desk-
top site is replaced with a rendering of the 
alternate phone layout. Th e editing process 
is the same as for the desktop site, just roll 
over the images and text to highlight them.
 `A feature of In-Browser Editing is that we 
can roll over sub-elements of widgets and 
choose whether to edit the sub-element or 
click it to see the associated content. Since 
they have editable text and also need to be 
clicked to activate them, we need to be able 
to make the distinction.
Th e menu has been set up using a widget, 
when we hover over the item, we now have 
two choices: edit and click. Choosing Click 
activates the menu as it would if we were 
navigating the page in a browser,  choosing 
Edit opens the text editor enabling us to 
alter the label text.
Update changes in Muse
When changes are made on the live website, 
they need to be refl ected in Muse to avoid 
future confl icts. As soon as we reopen the 
site in Muse, it detects if any changes were 
made using In-Browser Editing. If there are, 
the Review and Merge Changes dialog box 
appears,  allowing us to review and merge 
or discard the alterations.
Th e item in question is highlighted on 
the page. We can also choose to see the 
change in place by checking Preview on 
page. Th e menus on the Merge and   Merge 
into Muse buttons allow us to step through 
each change or to use the chosen option for 
all remaining items.

Adding a ‘favicon’
As a fi nal garnish to the newly published 
site, we’ll create the icon that sits next to the 
address in the browser, known as the  fav-
icon. Without setting one up the browser 
uses its default image, in Safari’s case, this 
is a blue globe.
 `Select File >  Site Properties. Click the 
folder icon next to Favicon image at the bot-
tom of the Layout panel. Browse to select 
the fi le favicon.png. Th e image  appears in 
the square to the left . Th is is its actual size. 
Click OK to set the changes.
If you search the web for the term 
Favicon, you’ll fi nd many free Favicon gen-
erators online that enable you to upload a 
square image fi le and then download the 
resized image that you can add to the site.
 `Click the   Publish button to upload the 
latest version of the site. When the browser 
opens we can see our new icon next to the 
address. Although it’s not essential to do 
this, it does look a lot nicer than the browser 
default and it does help to distinguish the 
site from others in your bookmarks.
Favicons also appear in the browser’s tab 
when the visitor has more than one page 
open at a time, also helping to distinguish 
the site.
So that’s the site live and ready to be seen by the world. All that remains is to make sure people know about 
it. Search-engine optimization works but it’s going to need help. Word-of-mouth, business cards and links from

At the beginning of the book we encountered a problem when setting up the main navigation menu. Initially, I 
wanted the site logo in the middle, the idea was to represent the ribbon around a cake with a centerpiece. This 
caused problems with the way the site loaded its pages, so I opted to alter the design. Here we’ll look at a method 
of changing the layout of the menu without affecting the sitemap.
Add a  new master page
We’ll begin by creating a duplicate of the 
master page. Th is way we don’t aff ect the 
current layout whilst we’re working. We’ll 
also be able to quickly switch between the 
layouts later.
Right-click the master page on the site 
plan. Select  Duplicate Page. Rename the 
copy B-Master.
 `Since this is only a  placeholder, we don’t 
need to upload the page itself. Right-click 
the page thumbnail. Uncheck the Export 
Page item. We can also remove its hyper-
link by selecting the option:  Include Page 
without Hyperlink.
Create a dummy page
Create a new page between Our Services 
and Information. Name this page Home 
Icon. Th e name is not really relevant as it 
will be covered but it needs to space out the 
menu items enough to accommodate the 
logo without it overlapping the labels.
The left-overs

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Now we can edit the page template. Open 
the B-Master page in Design mode. Use the 
Selection tool to move the logo into the 
center of the page; hold Shift to constrain 
the horizontal movement. 
 `Click the menu to select it. Drag the left  
handle over to align with the left  page con-
tent guide. As we do, the menu spacing 
expands to fi t the space. Th e dummy page 
item is hidden beneath as we had arranged 
the logo to appear above the other page ele-
ments when we fi rst created the menu.
 `Once we’ve previewed the new menu 
design to make sure it works we can apply 
the master to the pages. Th ere are a couple 
of ways to do this: we can drag the B-Mas-
ter thumbnail onto the page thumbnail or 
right-click the page thumbnail and select 
from the Masters sub-menu. Th e pages 
update as we do so.
You’re still the master
Working with multiple master pages is great for trying out different layouts. Remember to update the 404 page if

One of the major features in Muse is called scroll effects. Scroll effects allow you to make items move and have 
items moving independent of one another and at different speeds in relation to the speed the page is being 
scrolled. This gives us a huge amount of scope for creating interactive design elements and effects. In this section 
we’ll be looking at the concept behind scroll effects and some of their practical uses.
The Scroll Effects panel
Object movement and other eff ects are 
controlled using the   Scroll Effects panel; 
fi ll settings are handled individually. Th ere 
are four separate sections in the panel. Th e 
fi rst is for motion (shown here), the second 
allows us to control the object’s opacity. Th e 
third section is used to control slideshow 
content. Th e last section is for integrating 
Adobe Edge Animations, where the scroll 
motion controls the animation content to a 
limited extent.

O Initial Motion: this determines the 
behaviour of the object before the page 
has scrolled past the key position. Th ere 
are four arrows to set the movement 
direction. Each direction block has a 
value to its right. Th is controls the speed 
in relation to the page scroll. A value of 
1x means the object moves at the same 
speed as the scroll movement. Setting 
a value lower than 1x means the move-
ment will be slower, e.g. 0.5x will move 
at half the speed of the page scroll. Sim-
ilarly, setting a value higher than 1 will 
mean the object moves faster than the 
scroll: 2x being twice that of the scroll 
movement. A value of 0 means the 
object will be fi xed in position and does 
not move as the page scrolls.

O Key position (not labeled): this defi nes 
the actual position on the page which 
diff erentiates the settings in the Initial 
Motion from the settings applied in the 
Final Motion. In other words its relative 
position in the Design mode. We can set 
the value numerically here in the panel 
or visually by dragging the T-Handle 
guide on the page. For example, if we 
set the value to 180px, the object will 
move at the speed and direction defi ned 
by the Initial Motion setting to arrive at 
that position when the key position is 
scrolled to the top of the browser win-
dow (see illustration on the facing page). 
Since the speed setting is constant, the 
higher the speed setting, the further 
away from the key position our object 
begins. To move it off  the visible por-
tion of the page here would require us to 
increase the scroll speed.

O Final Motion: this determines the behav-
iour of the object aft er the page  reaches 
and scrolls past the key position. Th e set-
tings are applied in the same way as the 
Initial Motion.
The Scroll Effects 
panel determines how 
objects interact with 
the page as it scrolls.

This is a basic 
example to 
demonstrate the 
mechanics of scroll 
motion.  The square 
has been given the 
motion settings 
shown on the 
opposite page. The 
key position and the 
object’s position on 
the page have been 
marked with guides 
and text. Note the 
T-handle guide line 
extending up to the 
180px marker. 
When previewed in the browser, 
the square is displayed offset from 
its starting position. This is roughly 
twice the distance, as we have set 
the speed to 2x the scroll speed.
As we scroll down the page, the 
square moves up at twice the speed 
of the scroll. When the key position 
marker is at the top of the browser, 
the square reaches its set position. 
Once we begin to scroll past the 
key position, the Final Motion 
setting comes into effect, in this 
case, the box moves over to the left 
at three times the scroll speed.
Misplaced positioning
The confusing part of setting up scroll effects is the apparent shift in position of the object, in comparison to

would be in the correct position in relation to the rest of the static page elements, it’s simply that the page has 
to move up further to allow for the effect.

Scroll effect mechanics

Create a ‘sticky’ menu
Normally, when the page is scrolled up, the 
header content, which includes the Menu 
widget, disappears off  the screen. Using 
 scroll eff ects, we can create a menu that 
starts to scroll off  the page but sticks to the 
browser window when it reaches the top. 
Th is is useful if we have a large header that 
we don’t want taking up space.
We’ll begin by creating a new master 
based on the central logo version of the 
menu. Right-click the B-Master thumbnail. 
Select Duplicate Page. Name this C-Master.
 `We need to make some changes to the 
menu. Open the new master page in design 
mode. Go to the   Layers panel. Click the 
 New Layer icon at the bottom. Name the 
layer Menu. Make sure it’s at the top of the 
stack as we need it to display above the rest 
of the site content.
 `We’ll group the menu and the ribbon 
image together. Th is makes it easier to have 
them scrolling in unison. Grab the Selec-
tion tool. Click and drag a selection over 
the right edge of the ribbon so it picks up 
the end of the Contact Us menu entry. 
Go to the Object menu. Select  Group 
(keyboard shortcut Cmd+G/Ctrl+G). Don’t 
worry that the menu is now in front of the 
logo, we’ll sort that out next.
 `Right-click the new grouped object to dis-
play the menu and choose the option Move 
to Layer. Select Menu. Now select the logo 
image frame and move that to the menu 
layer. Th e logo now appears above menu.

 `Make sure the menu group is the active 
object. Go over to the Scroll Effects panel. 
Enable the Motion checkbox.
We want the menu to travel up at the 
same speed as the page scroll, so we’ll set 
the initial motion to up and its speed to 1x; 
make sure the horizontal movement is set 
to 0x. As the menu needs to stop when it 
hits the top of the browser, the  Key Position 
needs to be the same as the top of the menu 
itself. Drag the T-handle down to the top of 
the group’s frame, or set the value numeri-
cally, in this case, it’s 72px.
Lastly, we need to freeze the menu in 
position at the top of the window, to do this 
we set the Final Motion values to 0x.
 `Th e master page currently isn’t tall enough 
to scroll, which is necessary for scroll eff ects 
to work. Go back to the Plan mode. Cre-
ate a new page named Scroll test based on 
the C-Master page. Set the Menu Option to 
Exclude Page From Menus.
Open the  Page Properties. Set the Min 
Height value to 2000px. Th is will ensure 
there is plenty of space to scroll the page 
without needing to add content to space it 
out. Click OK to apply the setting. 
 `Open the new page in Design mode. We 
don’t see any change, apart from the footer 
no longer being visible. 
When we test the page in Preview mode 
and start scrolling down, the menu moves 
to the top of the browser window with 
the other page content. When the top of 
the menu widget (which is also the key 
position) reaches the top of the browser 
window, it stops. If we continue scrolling 
the logo disappears, revealing the Home 
link beneath. If we scroll back up, the logo 
moves back into place and the menu moves 
down, stopping at its initial location.

Flying items onto the page
We saw how we can use scroll eff ects to 
recede the menu to give us more page space. 
We can also use it to fl y page items onto the 
page to add interactivity to the design.
To demonstrate this, I’ve imported some 
of the original site content to the Scroll test 
page. Th e home page content is static, as it’s 
intended to be seen at the start. Below it, 
I’ve pasted in the content from the Our Ser-
vices page. We’ll use diff erent scroll eff ects 
to control how the elements are displayed.
 `We’ll start by having the four images 
moving into position: the top row will drop 
down, the bottom row will emerge from the 
right side of the page.
Select the top-left  image. Go to the   Scroll 
Effects panel. Enable the motion checkbox. 
Click the down directional arrow. Set the 
speed to 3x. 
 `Th e images need to be in place before 
the section heading is too far up in the 
browser. Remember that the menu is now 
fi xed at this point, so we need to take that 
into account. We can use the static page ele-
ments as a cue here.
Drag a  Horizontal guide down from the 
ruler to sit at the top of the social media 
buttons. Make a note of the Y position, it’s 
830px in the example. Set the  Key Position 
value to match; its T-Handle will now be 
resting level with the guide.
Th e image needs to continue scrolling 
with the page once it’s in position, so we can 
leave the default setting for Final Motion as 
Up at 1x speed.

 `Click the top-right image. Enable motion. 
Set everything the same as the previous 
image, apart from the  Initial Motion speed. 
Set this to 8x. Th is will drop the image 
down faster than the left  side but it  will still 
arrive at the same time. Th is gives the ani-
mation a bit of variety.
 `Now for the bottom row of images. 
Select the bottom-left  image. Enable scroll 
motion. Th is time set the Initial Motion 
direction to Left at 3x speed. We’ll have the 
images hitting their fi nal positions slightly 
later than the top row. Set the Key Position 
to 850px. Th e  Final Motion setting remains 
at its default of upward motion at 1x speed.
 `Select the bottom-right image. Th is time 
we’ll alter the way it travels. Th e previous 
image will slide in diagonally, as the page 
is moving up at the same time as the object 
is moving horizontally. To have the image 
slide in at 90˚ we need to alter the Initial 
Motion slightly. Set the horizontal move-
ment to Left at 8x, to be diff erent from the 
previous image. Set the vertical movement 
to Up at 0.5x speed. Th is will match the 
speed of the scroll, keeping the movement 
more or less level. Th e remainder of the set-
tings are the same as before.

lacking is the ability to control the acceleration of the movement, which would give us even more scope in

Change an item’s opacity
We just saw how we can use scroll eff ects 
to move items on a page, in this section 
we’ll look at how the opacity of items can be 
changed as the page moves.
Select the text item What our customers 
are saying. Go to the   Scroll Effects panel. 
Click the second button to open the Opac-
ity controls; check the Opacity checkbox to 
enable them. As with the motion control 
settings, we see the T-Handle extending 
away from the text frame. 
 `Th e settings are similar to those of the 
motion panel. Instead of direction and 
speed, however, we have position and per-
centage fi elds. Th e fi rst setting is for the 
initial opacity of the object. By default this 
is 0%, so when the page is previewed, the 
text frame is hidden.
Just as we have the  Key Position setting to 
defi ne the fi nal position for scroll motion, 
the key setting here determines the object’s 
opacity when the value we set is at the top of 
the browser: 100% in the example. Th e sec-
ond opacity setting controls the visibility of 
the object as we scroll past the key position.
 `Like scroll motion, we need to plan where 
on the page our objects will be at their full 
visibility. In this example, they’ll be fading 
in at the bottom of the page. Although the 
layout of the settings in the panel suggests 
we set the initial opacity fi rst, I fi nd it it’s 
best to set the key position then adjust the 
start and fi nish opacity aft erward. 
Set the  page at the position we want the 
text to be fully visible. Drag the   Key Posi-
tion guide to the top of the window. In this 
case, it’s just below the images in the slide-
show. Make sure the key position opacity 
value is 100%.

C r e a t i v e  w e b  d e s i g n  w i t h  A d o b e  M u s e
 `Th e next step is to set the initial opacity. 
Th is needs to remain at 0%. Th e distance 
from the key position determines the speed 
at which the transition occurs, the greater 
the amount, the longer the object takes to 
fade in/out and vice versa.
Drag the Fade Position 1 guide of the 
T-handle up, I’ve set it to 660px, which 
gives a short but noticeable fade. If you’re 
applying the same transition  to several 
items, it’s always a good idea to make the 
distances easier to calculate.
 `Th e second opacity guide sets the visibility 
of the object aft er reaching the key position. 
We want it to remain at 100% so make sure 
this is the current value. Since there’s no 
transition required, we can set the position 
of the second guide to the same value as the 
key position, 760px in the example.
 `Now to set the fade for the comment 
boxes.  Select the top-most box. Move it 
into the position we want it at 100% opacity. 
Adjust the settings as before, using a 100px 
fade transition. We could set the remaining 
boxes by eye but since they’re uniformly 
spaced, we simply need to use the settings 
from the fi rst, adding the diff erence, 106px 
in this case, to the key position and off -
setting the initial opacity by -100px. Th e 
second opacity setting will be the same as 
the key for each in this example. 
Position is everything
It’s important to take the browser window’s height into account whenever you’re using scroll effects, especially

the objects fade in just as they emerge at the bottom of the window. If we were to stretch the window to twice 
its current height, however, the objects would only begin to appear when they were roughly half-way up the 
page. Conversely, if we were to view the page in a shorter window, we might not see the effect at all. We also need to have

Create a new property
To set up our site for analytics, we need to 
create a new profi le (known as a property) 
with your Analytics account. To do this, 
go to the Admin section, select the account 
to create the site under, in the example it’s 
Client sites. Click Select a property then 
 Create new property.  
Set the  tracking type
Th e next part of the setup is to defi ne the 
type of tracking and the site details. Make 
sure the Website property is highlighted. 
At the time of writing, Universal Analytics 
is still in beta, so we’ll go with the Classic 
version here. Th is still off ers everything we 
need to be able to track our site visitors. We 
can always change it at a later date.
Add the  site details
Th e next section is for the name of the site. 
Th is is how it’s identifi ed in the list of sites in 
the Analytics account, Brighton Cake Com-
pany here. Next is the site URL. Th is would 
normally be the primary address. I’m using 
the Muse trial site address in the example 
as the company’s domain name has not yet 
transferred over. We’ll set the Industry Cate-
gory to Food and Drink. Finally we have the 
Reporting Time Zone. I’ve set it to United 
Kingdom as the company is based here.
Although Muse Dashboard has its own site statistics pages, if you’re publishing to a third-party host, or just 
want an alternative, you’ll need to use a different strategy for tracking page metrics. The most popular system is

Ctrl+C to store a copy on the clipboard.
Set up the tracking code
Go back to Muse. Open the Plan mode. 
Right-click the A-Master page. Select  Page 
Properties. Click the  Metadata tab. Right-
click inside the HTML for <head> window. 
Select Paste (or press Cmd+V/Ctrl+V) to 
paste the copied code. Click OK.
Th is applies the code to every page with 
the currently selected master page. Remem-
ber to do the same for the alternate master 
pages as well.
Test the account
Now that the code is in place we can repub-
lish the site. It will take time to show up a 
full set of statistics, of course. 
To demonstrate that it’s already doing 
its job, I took a snapshot of the real-time 
monitor in the Reporting section of Ana-
lytics, just aft er publishing the site. We can 
see that there’s one active visitor (that’s me) 
and that two pages have been viewed, along 
with my location.

In this section we’ll be looking at another recent feature in Muse: the State Button widget. States can only be 
applied to a single element, so if we create a button with a graphic background and text, although the links go 
to the same place, the rollover state for the background and text are independent of each other; we’ll either see 
the text change, or the background, depending on where the cursor is. The State Button acts as a container; we 
can drag a group of items, each with their own rollover states, into the widget. When we move the cursor onto the 
button, all the object’s states change in unison.
Use a  scratch page
We’ll start by creating a scratch page. Go 
to the site plan. Create a new page named 
Scratch. Right-click its thumbnail. Deselect 
Publish Page. Select Exclude From Menus. 
We’ll use the A-Master template here.
Create a composite button
Open the scratch page. Grab the Rectangle 
tool. Draw out a rectangle. Set its Fill color 
to Warm Yellow. Set a 10px Stroke. Enable 
rounded corners at a Radius of 30px. Set 
the Stroke color to Mint Green. Th is will be 
the basis of our button.
Switch to the Text tool. Draw out a text 
frame inside the button so it fi ts just inside 
the stroke. Set the font to PT Sans regular. 
Set the color to Chocolate Brown. Type in 
Click Me!. Now increase the size to fi t the 
button. In this example, it’s 45px.
Create a new rectangle to the right of the 
text. Hold the Shift key to constrain the 
shape to a square. Drag it out to match the 
height of the text. Set the color to Chocolate 
Brown. Remove the stroke. Set the Corner 
Radius to its maximum of 100. Th is turns 
the square to a circle.

 `Th at’s the button graphic completed. 
Now we’ll set the Rollover states for each 
element. Click the background rectangle. 
Go to the States panel. Select the Rollover 
state. Change the Stroke color to Chocolate 
Brown. 
Th e Mouse Down state updates automat-
ically to match the settings of the Rollover 
state. Leave the Active state settings as is.
Add the State widget
Go to the Composition section of the 
Widgets Library. Drag the   State Button 
widget over to the page. Start by scaling it 
up to just larger than our button.
 `First we need to remove the placeholder 
content. Click the circle. Press Delete or 
Backspace. Do the same for the text. 
Go to the States panel, make sure the 
Normal state is selected. Change the Fill 
color to None. Select the Rollover state. 
Click the Trash icon to clear the remaining 
states.
Create the combined item
Th e widget is not visible but the State Button 
container is still where we left  it. Select all 
the items in our button. Don’t group them, 
though. Drag them down onto the widget, 
its frame will highlight as we move over it. 
Release the mouse to drop them into the 
state widget container. When previewed, all 
the items change in unison.
 `Click the text frame. Select its Rollover 
state. Change the color to Mint Green. Now 
do the same for the circle.
When we preview the page, we see diff er-
ent results, depending on the placement of 
the cursor on the button.

Preparing the library item
We’ll use the button we created in the pre-
vious section. Before we start, we’ll need to 
make some changes. Go to the  Swatches 
panel. Right-click the Chocolate Brown 
color preset. Select  Duplicate Swatch to cre-
ate a copy. Do the same for the Mint Green 
and Warm Yellow presets.
 `Double-click the duplicate Warm Yellow 
swatch to open the  Swatch Options dialog. 
Rename the swatch Color 1. Click OK to 
apply the change. Do the same for the Mint 
Green and Chocolate Brown copies, naming 
them Color 2 and Color 3 respectively.

as a single entity, in order to reuse them later. This is incredibly useful, of course, but there is a whole lot more to 
the Library and the way we can use the items we store there. In this section we’ll create a truly universal library 
item that can be set to adapt to the look of the site its placed in. We’ll also see how items can be shared and 
imported, both privately and publicly.
 `Now we need to change the colors in the 
button to the new presets we created. Th e 
reason for this will become apparent later 
in the section. 
Click through the elements, changing 
the background, stroke and text colors to 
use the swatches named Color 1, Color 2, 
and Color 3. Remember to reset the color 
swatches for the button’s states, too.

 `Click the button background to make it 
the active object. Go to the   Graphic Styles 
panel. Create a new style named Button 
Lozenge. Note the style settings showing the 
new colors we applied. Do the same for the 
circle item, name it Button Circle.
 `Select the text item. Go to the Paragraph 
Styles panel. Create a new style named But-
ton Text. Again, we see the new color preset 
in the settings.
Add to the  library
 `Go to the Library panel. Click the  Create 
folder button. Name it Buttons. Click the 
button object to select it. Press Esc to make 
sure the active item is the State Button by 
referring to the Selection Indicator. 
Highlight the folder we created. Now 
click the Add selected item(s) icon to add it 
into the library. Name it Lozenge Button. It’s 
now stored in the buttons folder.
Creating your library structure
If there are currently no items in the Library, adding a new item will automatically create a parent folder to 
contain it. This will be named Untitled, as will the new item within it. Both can be renamed, of course. Once the 
library has one or more folders, we see a list in the sub-menu so we can choose the destination. If we don’t

Adaptive library items
Th e true power of library items is the ability 
to reuse them in new sites. Go to File > New 
Site (Cmd+N/Ctrl+N). Click OK to accept 
the default settings. Open the Home page 
in Design mode. If we look at the Library 
panel we see both the cake company folder 
and the Buttons folder we just created.
 `To demonstrate how library items can 
adapt, we’ll create a color scheme for our 
new site. Go to the Swatches panel. Pick a 
warm orange. Click the Add swatch icon. 
Open its options dialog. Name it Color 1, 
as we did before. Ensure the name is exactly 
the same, case included, as the swatch name 
we assigned on the main site. 
Create two more, a fi ery orange for Color 
2 and fi nally a midnight blue for Color 3.
 `Grab the Text tool. Draw out a text frame 
on the page. Set the font to something other 
than the one used for the original button, 
I’ve used the web font Source Sans Pro light. 
Set the size to 45px. Set the color to Color 3.
Create a new paragraph style. Name it 
Button Text, again making sure it matches 
the name we used for the button exactly. 
Th e sample text frame can be deleted.
 `Go back to the Library panel. Drag the 
Lozenge button over to the page. Although 
it looks the same in the library, as soon as 
we place it down, its colors and type face 
change to use the font and color attributes 
that are specifi c to the current site.
As long as we maintain a naming con-
vention from site to site, the button will 
automatically adapt to the scheme. With 
this on board we have a huge scope for 
making reusable site assets.

 Exporting and importing
Library items can be exported as packaged 
fi les to share with other people, and as a 
backup. Highlight the folder or individual 
asset you want to export. Click the  Export 
selected item(s) as a Muse Library icon. Th e 
Export Library Items dialog box appears. 
Th e default fi le name is always the parent 
folder, regardless of whether we choose a 
single item or the entire folder.
 `To open a library item in Muse, we can 
either double-click the fi le – the suffi  x is 
.mulib and is associated with Muse – or 
click the   Import Muse library icon. Here I’ve 
imported a library I downloaded from the 
Muse Exchange page.
Each item is self-contained, retaining 
its color palette and styles. If any of these 
match those of the destination, they’ll be 
overridden, just like the behaviour we saw 
with the button.
Library items: caveat
Library items can contain bitmap images 
as well as shapes and text, of course. It’s 
important to note that the source image fi les 
themselves won’t be included in the export 
fi le by default. If we look at the   Assets panel 
we see that all the components of the icon 
are missing. Although this will not aff ect 
the site when it’s published, as Muse uses 
the cached versions. It does mean that the 
images cannot be edited by the recipient.
Make your libraries self-supporting
To get around the problem of missing images, we can either send the originals separately, or we can embed 
them into the asset; this must be done before it’s added to the library. To embed an asset, go to the Assets 
panel, right-click the asset’s entry. Select   Embed link. This instructs Muse to save the original asset, both
