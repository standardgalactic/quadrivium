Why Global Events

.ajaxStart()
.ajaxStop()
.ajaxSend()
Global Events
Called when the first Ajax request begins
Called when the last Ajax request ends
Executes before each Ajax request begins

.ajaxSuccess()
.ajaxComplete()
.ajaxError()
Global Events
Called after each Ajax request is successful
Called after each Ajax request completes
Called after each Ajax request has an error
