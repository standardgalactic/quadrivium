It is time to set minds at ease by raising the "specter" of 
"genetic determinism" and banishing it once and for all. 
According to Stephen Jay Gould, genetic determinists 
believe the following: 
 
"If we are programmed to be what we are, then these traits 
are ineluctable. We may, at best, channel them, but we 
cannot change them either by will, education, or culture." 
 
If this is genetic determinism, then we can all breathe a sigh 
of relief: There are no genetic determinists. I have never 
encountered anybody who claims that will, education, and 
culture cannot change many, if not all, of our genetically 
inherited traits. My genetic tendency to myopia is canceled 
by the eyeglasses I wear (but I do have to want to wear 
them); and many of those who would otherwise suffer from 
one genetic disease or another can have the symptoms 
postponed indefinitely by being educated about the 
importance of a particular diet, or by the culture-borne gift 
of one prescription medicine or another. If you have the 
gene for the disease phenylketonuria, all you have to do to 
avoid its undesirable effects is stop eating food containing 
phenylalanine. What is inevitable doesn't depend on 
whether determinism reigns, but on whether on not there 
are steps we can take, based on information we can get in 
time to take those steps, to avoid the foreseen harm.

the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. This 
essay is adapted from Freedom Evolves, to be published in 
February by Viking. 
There are two requirements for meaningful choice: 
information and a path for the information to guide. 
Without one, the other is useless or worse. In his excellent 
survey of contemporary genetics, Matt Ridley drives the 
point home with the poignant example of Huntington's 
disease, which is "pure fatalism, undiluted by environmental 
variability. Good living, good medicine, healthy food, 
loving families, or great riches can do nothing about it." 
This is in sharp contrast to all the equally undesirable 
genetic predispositions that we can do something about. 
And it is for just this reason that many people who are likely, 
given their family tree, to have the Huntington's mutation 
choose not to take the simple test that would tell them with 
virtual certainty whether they have it. But note that if and 
when a path opens up, as it may in the future, for treating 
those who have Huntington's mutation, these same people 
will be first in line to take the test.  
 
Gould and others have declared their firm opposition to 
"genetic determinism," but I doubt if anybody thinks our 
genetic endowments are infinitely revisable. It is all but 
impossible that I will ever give birth, thanks to my Y 
chromosome. I cannot change this by either will, education, 
or culture -- at least not in my lifetime (but who knows 
what another century of science will make possible?). So at 
least for the foreseeable future, some of my genes fix some 
parts of my destiny without any real prospect of exemption. 
If that is genetic determinism, we are all genetic 
determinists, Gould included. Once the caricatures are set 
aside, what remains, at best, are honest differences of 
opinion about just how much intervention it would take to 
counteract one genetic tendency or another and, more 
important, whether such intervention would be justified. 
 
These are important moral and political issues, but they 
often become next to impossible to discuss in a calm and 
reasonable way. Besides, what would be so specially bad

about genetic determinism? Wouldn't environmental 
determinism be just as dreadful? Consider a parallel 
definition of environmental determinism: 
 
"If we have been raised and educated in a particular cultural 
environment, then the traits imposed on us by that 
environment are ineluctable. We may at best channel them, 
but we cannot change them either by will, further education, 
or by adopting a different culture." 
 
The Jesuits have often been quoted (I don't know how 
accurately) as saying: "Give me a child until he is 7, and I 
will show you the man." An exaggeration for effect, surely, 
but there is little doubt that early education and other major 
events of childhood can have a profound effect on later life. 
There are studies, for instance, that suggest that such dire 
events as being rejected by your mother in the first year of 
life increases your likelihood of committing a violent crime. 
Again, we mustn't make the mistake of equating 
determinism with inevitability. What we need to examine 
empirically – and this can vary just as dramatically in 
environmental settings as in genetic settingsis whether the 
undesirable effects, however large, can be avoided by steps 
we can take.  
 
Consider the affliction known as not knowing a word of 
Chinese. I suffer from it, thanks entirely to environmental 
influences early in my childhood (my genes had nothing -- 
nothing directly -- to do with it). If I were to move to China, 
however, I could soon enough be "cured," with some effort 
on my part, though I would no doubt bear deep and 
unalterable signs of my deprivation, readily detectable by 
any native Chinese speaker, for the rest of my life. But I 
could certainly get good enough in Chinese to be held 
responsible for actions I might take under the influence of 
Chinese speakers I encountered. 
 
Isn't it true that whatever isn't determined by our genes 
must be determined by our environment? What else is 
there? There's Nature and there's Nurture. Is there also 
some X, some further contributor to what we are? There's 
Chance. Luck. This extra ingredient is important but 
doesn't have to come from the quantum bowels of our atoms 
or from some distant star. It is all around us in the causeless 
coin-flipping of our noisy world, automatically filling in the 
gaps of specification left unfixed by our genes, and unfixed 
by salient causes in our environment. This is particularly 
evident in the way the trillions of connections between cells 
in our brains are formed. It has been recognized for years 
that the human genome, large as it is, is much too small to 
specify (in its gene recipes) all the connections that are 
formed between neurons. What happens is that the genes 
specify processes that set in motion huge population growth 
of neurons -- many times more neurons than our brains will 
eventually use -- and these neurons send out exploratory 
branches, at random (at pseudo-random, of course), and 
many of these happen to connect to other neurons in ways 
that are detectably useful (detectable by the mindless 
processes of brain-pruning).  
 
These winning connections tend to survive, while the 
losing connections die, to be dismantled so that their parts 
can be recycled in the next generation of hopeful neuron 
growth a few days later. This selective environment within 
the brain (especially within the brain of the fetus, long 
before it encounters the outside environment) no more 
specifies the final connections than the genes do; saliencies 
in both genes and developmental environment influence 
and prune the growth, but there is plenty that is left to 
chance. 
 
When the human genome was recently published, and it 
was announced that we have "only" about 30,000 genes (by 
today's assumptions about how to identify and count genes), 

 
3
not the 100,000 genes that some experts had surmised, there 
was an amusing sigh of relief in the press. Whew! "We" are 
not just the products of our genes; "we" get to contribute all 
the specifications that those 70,000 genes would otherwise 
have "fixed" in us! And how, one might ask, are "we" to do 
this? Aren't we under just as much of a threat from the 
dread environment, nasty old Nurture with its insidious 
indoctrination techniques? When Nature and Nurture have 
done their work, will there be anything left over to be me? 
 
Does it matter what the trade-off is if, one way or another, 
our genes and our environment (including chance) divide 
up the spoils and "fix" our characters? Perhaps it seems that 
the environment is a more benign source of determination 
since, after all, "we can change the environment." That is 
true, but we can't change a person's past environment any 
more than we can change her parents, and environmental 
adjustments in the future can be just as vigorously addressed 
to undoing prior genetic constraints as prior environmental 
constraints. And we are now on the verge of being able to 
adjust the genetic future almost as readily as the 
environmental future.  
 
Suppose you know that any child of yours will have a 
problem that can be alleviated by either an adjustment to its 
genes or an adjustment to its environment. There can be 
many valid reasons for favoring one treatment policy over 
another, but it is certainly not obvious that one of these 
options should be ruled out on moral or metaphysical 
grounds. Suppose, to make up an imaginary case that will 
probably soon be outrun by reality, you are a committed 
Inuit who believes life above the Arctic Circle is the only 
life worth living, and suppose you are told that your 
children will be genetically ill-equipped for living in such an 
environment. You can move to the tropics, where they will 
be fine -- at the cost of giving up their environmental 
heritage -- or you can adjust their genomes, permitting them 
to continue living in the Arctic world, at the cost (if it is 
one) of the loss of some aspect of their "natural" genetic 
heritage. 
 
The issue is not about determinism, either genetic or 
environmental or both together; the issue is about what we 
can change whether or not our world is deterministic. A 
fascinating perspective on the misguided issue of genetic 
determinism is provided by Jared Diamond in his 
magnificent book Guns, Germs, and Steel(1997). The 
question Diamond poses, and largely answers, is why it is 
that "Western" people (Europeans or Eurasians) have 
conquered, colonized, and otherwise dominated "Third 
World" people instead of vice versa. Why didn't the human 
populations of the Americas or Africa, for instance, create 
worldwide empires by invading, killing, and enslaving 
Europeans? Is the answer ... genetic? Is science showing us 
that the ultimate source of Western dominance is in our 
genes? On first encountering this question, many people -- 
even highly sophisticated scientists -- jump to the 
conclusion that Diamond, by merely addressing this 
question, must be entertaining some awful racist hypothesis 
about European genetic superiority. So rattled are they by 
this suspicion that they have a hard time taking in the fact 
(which he must labor mightily to drive home) that he is 
saying just about the opposite: The secret explanation lies 
not in our genes, not in human genes, but it does lie to a 
very large extent in genes -- the genes of the plants and 
animals that were the wild ancestors of all the domesticated 
species of human agriculture. 
 
Prison wardens have a rule of thumb: If it can happen, it 
will happen. What they mean is that any gap in security, 
any ineffective prohibition or surveillance or weakness in 
the barriers, will soon enough be found and exploited to the 
full by the prisoners. Why? The intentional stance makes it 
clear: The prisoners are intentional systems who are smart, 

 
4
resourceful, and frustrated; as such they amount to a huge 
supply of informed desire with lots of free time in which to 
explore their worlds. Their search procedure will be as good 
as exhaustive, and they will be able to tell the best moves 
from the second-best. Count on them to find whatever is 
there to be found.  
 
Diamond exploits the same rule of thumb, assuming that 
people anywhere in the world have always been just about 
as smart, as thrifty, as opportunistic, as disciplined, as 
foresighted, as people anywhere else, and then showing that 
indeed people have always found what was there to be found. 
To a good first approximation, all the domesticable wild 
species have been domesticated. The reason the Eurasians 
got a head start on technology is because they got a head 
start on agriculture, and they got that because among the 
wild plants and animals in their vicinity 10,000 years ago 
were ideal candidates for domestication. There were grasses 
that were genetically close to superplants that could be 
arrived at more or less by accident, just a few mutations 
away from big-head, nutritious grains, and animals that 
because of their social nature were genetically close to 
herdable animals that bred easily in captivity. (Maize in the 
Western Hemisphere took longer to domesticate in part 
because it had a greater genetic distance to travel away from 
its wild precursor.) 
 
And, of course, the key portion of the selection events that 
covered this ground, before modern agronomy, was what 
Darwin called "unconscious selection'' -- the largely 
unwitting and certainly uninformed bias implicit in the 
behavior patterns of people who had only the narrowest 
vision of what they were doing and why. Accidents of 
biogeography, and hence of environment, were the major 
causes, the constraints that "fixed'' the opportunities of 
people wherever they lived. Thanks to living for millennia 
in close proximity to their many varieties of domesticated 
animals, Eurasians developed immunity to the various 
disease pathogens that jumped from their animal hosts to 
human hosts -- here is a profound role played by human 
genes, and one confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt -- and 
when thanks to their technology, they were able to travel 
long distances and encounter other peoples, their germs did 
many times the damage that their guns and steel did. 
 
What are we to say about Diamond and his thesis? Is he a 
dread genetic determinist, or a dread environmental 
determinist? He is neither, of course, for both these species 
of bogeyman are as mythical as werewolves. By increasing 
the information we have about the various causes of the 
constraints that limit our current opportunities, he has 
increased our powers to avoid what we want to avoid, 
prevent what we want to prevent. Knowledge of the roles of 
our genes, and the genes of the other species around us, is 
not the enemy of human freedom, but one of its best friends.
