Preface
Ordinary differential equations is a wide mathematical discipline which is closely related to
both pure mathematical research and real world applications. Most mathematical formula-
tions of physical laws are described in terms of ordinary and partial differential equations,
and this has been a great motivation for their study in the past. In the 20th century the
extremely fast development of Science led to applications in the ﬁelds of chemistry, bi-
ology, medicine, population dynamics, genetic engineering, economy, social sciences and
others, as well. All these disciplines promoted to higher level and new discoveries were
made with the help of this kind of mathematical modeling. At the same time, real world
problems have been and continue to be a great inspiration for pure mathematics, particu-
larly concerning ordinary differential equations: they led to new mathematical models and
challenged mathematicians to look for new methods to solve them.
It should also be mentioned that an extremely fast development of computer sciences
took place in the last three decades: mathematicians have been provided with a tool which
had not been available before. This fact encouraged scientists to formulate more complex
mathematical models which, in the past, could hardly be resolved or even understood. Even
if computers rarely permit a rigorous treatment of a problem, they are a very useful tool
to get concrete numerical results or to make interesting numerical experiments. In the ﬁeld
of ordinary differential equations this phenomenon led more and more mathematicians
to the study of nonlinear differential equations. This fact is reﬂected pretty well by the
contributions to this volume.
The aim of the editors was to collect survey papers in the theory of ordinary differential
equations showing the “state of the art”, presenting some of the main results and methods
to solve various types of problems. The contributors, besides being widely acknowledged
experts in the subject, are known for their ability of clearly divulging their subject. We are
convinced that papers like the ones in this volume are very useful, both for the experts and
particularly for younger research fellows or beginners in the subject. The editors would
like to express their deepest gratitude to all contributors to this volume for the effort made
in this direction.
The contributions to this volume are presented in alphabetical order according to the
name of the ﬁrst author. The paper by Agarwal and O’Regan deals with singular initial and
boundary value problems (the nonlinear term may be singular in its dependent variable
and is allowed to change sign). Some old and new existence results are established and
the proofs are based on ﬁxed point theorems, in particular, Schauder’s ﬁxed point theo-
rem and a Leray–Schauder alternative. The paper by De Coster and Habets is dedicated to
the method of upper and lower solutions for boundary value problems. The second order
equations with various kinds of boundary conditions are considered. The emphasis is put
v

vi
Preface
on well ordered and non-well ordered pairs of upper and lower solutions, connection to
the topological degree and multiplicity of the solutions. The contribution of Došlý deals
with half-linear equations of the second order. The principal part of these equations is rep-
resented by the one-dimensional p-Laplacian and the author concentrates mainly on the
oscillatory theory. The paper by Jacobsen and Schmitt is devoted to the study of radial
solutions for quasilinear elliptic differential equations. The p-Laplacian serves again as a
prototype of the main part in the equation and the domains as a ball, an annual region,
the exterior of a ball, or the entire space are under investigation. The paper by Llibre is
dedicated to differential systems or vector ﬁelds deﬁned on the real or complex plane. The
author presents a deep and complete study of the existence of ﬁrst integrals for planar poly-
nomial vector ﬁelds through the Darbouxian theory of integrability. The paper by Mawhin
takes the simple forced pendulum equation as a model for describing a variety of nonlinear
phenomena: multiplicity of periodic solutions, subharmonics, almost periodic solutions,
stability, boundedness, Mather sets, KAM theory and chaotic dynamics. It is a review pa-
per taking into account more than a hundred research articles appeared on this subject. The
paper by Srzednicki is a review of the main results obtained by the Wa˙zewski method in
the theory of ordinary differential equations and inclusions, and retarded functional dif-
ferential equations, with some applications to boundary value problems and detection of
chaotic dynamics. It is concluded by an introduction of the Conley index with examples of
possible applications.
Last, but not least, we thank the Editors at Elsevier, who gave us the opportunity of
making available a collection of articles that we hope will be useful to mathematicians
and scientists interested in the recent results and methods in the theory and applications of
ordinary differential equations.

A survey of recent results for initial and boundary value problems

1. Introduction
The study of singular boundary value problems (singular in the dependent variable) is
relatively new. Indeed it was only in the middle 1970s that researchers realized that large
numbers of applications [7,11,12] in the study of nonlinear phenomena gave rise to singular
boundary value problems (singular in the dependent variable). However, in our opinion, it
was the 1979 paper of Taliaferro [20] that generated the interest of many researchers in
singular problems in the 1980s and 1990s. In [20] Taliaferro showed that the singular
boundary value problem
y′′ + q(t)y−α = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = 0 = y(1),
(1.1)
has a C[0,1] ∩C1(0,1) solution; here α > 0, q ∈C(0,1) with q > 0 on (0,1) and
 1
0 t(1 −t)q(t)dt < ∞. Problems of the form (1.1) arise frequently in the study of nonlin-
ear phenomena, for example in non-Newtonian ﬂuid theory, such as the transport of coal
slurries down conveyor belts [12], and boundary layer theory [11]. It is worth remarking
here that we could consider Sturm–Liouville boundary data in (1.1); however since the ar-
guments are essentially the same (in fact easier) we will restrict our discussion to Dirichlet
boundary data.
In the 1980s and 1990s many papers were devoted to singular boundary value problems
of the form
y′′ + q(t)f (t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = 0 = y(1),
(1.2)
and singular initial value problems of the form
y′ = q(t)f (t,y),
0 < t < T (< ∞),
y(0) = 0.
(1.3)
Almost all singular problems in the literature [8–10,14–18,21] up to 1994 discussed posi-
tone problems, i.e., problems where f :[0,1]×(0,∞) →(0,∞). In Section 2.1 we present
the most general results available in the literature for the positone singular problem (1.2).
In 1999 the question of multiplicity for positone singular problems was discussed for the
ﬁrst time by Agarwal and O’Regan [2]. The second half of Section 2.1 discusses multi-
plicity. In 1994 [16] the singular boundary value problem (1.2) was discussed when the
nonlinearity f could change sign. Model examples are
f (t,y) = t−1e
1
y −(1 −t)−1
and
f (t,y) = g(t)
yσ −h(t),
σ > 0
which correspond to Emden–Fowler equations; here g(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1) and h(t) may
change sign. Section 2.2 is devoted to (1.2) when the nonlinearity f may change sign. The
results here are based on arguments and ideas of Agarwal, O’Regan et al. [1–6], and Habets

4
R.P. Agarwal and D. O’Regan
and Zanolin [16]. Section 3 presents existence results for the singular initial value problem
(1.3) where the nonlinearity f may change sign.
The existence results in this paper are based on ﬁxed point theorems. In particular we
use frequently Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem and a Leray–Schauder alternative. We begin
of course with the Schauder theorem.
THEOREM 1.1. Let C be a convex subset of a Banach space and F :C →C a compact,
continuous map. Then F has a ﬁxed point in C.
In applications to construct a set C so that F takes C back into C is very difﬁcult and
sometimes impossible. As a result it makes sense to discuss maps F that map a subset of C
into C. One result in this direction is the so-called nonlinear alternative of Leray–Schauder.
THEOREM 1.2. Let E be a Banach space, C a convex subset of E, U an open subset of
C and 0 ∈U. Suppose F :U →C (here U denotes the closure of U in C) is a continuous,
compact map. Then either
(A1) F has a ﬁxed point in U; or
(A2) there exists u ∈∂U (the boundary of U in C) and λ ∈(0,1) with u = λF(u).
PROOF. Suppose (A2) does not occur and F has no ﬁxed points in ∂U (otherwise we are
ﬁnished). Let
A =

x ∈U: x = tF(x) for some t ∈[0,1]

.
Now A ̸= ∅since 0 ∈A and A is closed since F is continuous. Also notice A ∩∂U = ∅.
Thus there exists a continuous function μ : U →[0,1] with μ(A) = 1 and μ(∂U) = 0. Let
N(x) =

μ(x)F(x),
x ∈U,
0,
x ∈C\U.
Clearly N :C →C is a continuous, compact map. Theorem 1.1 guarantees the existence
of an x ∈C with x = Nx. Notice x ∈U since 0 ∈U. As a result x = μ(x)F(x), so x ∈A.
Thus μ(x) = 1 and so x = F(x).
□
To conclude the introduction we present existence principles for nonsingular initial and
boundary value problems which will be needed in Sections 2 and 3. First we use Schauder’s
ﬁxed point theorem and a nonlinear alternative of Leray–Schauder type to obtain a general
existence principle for the Dirichlet boundary value problem
y′′ + f (t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = a, y(1) = b.
(1.4)
Throughout this paper AC[0,1] denotes the space of absolutely continuous functions on
[0,1], ACloc(0,1) the space of functions absolutely continuous on each compact subinter-
val of (0,1) and L1
loc(0,1) the space of functions which are L1 integrable on each compact
subinterval of (0,1).

THEOREM 1.3. Suppose the following two conditions are satisﬁed:
the map y

(1.5)
and
the map t

holds. In addition suppose there is a constant M > |a| + |b|, independent of λ, with |y|0 =
supt∈[0,1] |y(t)| ̸= M for any solution y ∈AC[0,1] (with y′ ∈ACloc(0,1)) to
y′′ + λf (t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = a, y(1) = b,
(1.8)λ
for each λ ∈(0,1). Then (1.4) has a solution y with |y|0 ⩽M.

(1.8)λ.

Now the nonlinear alternative of Leray–Schauder type guarantees that N has a ﬁxed point,
i.e., (1.10)1 has a solution.
(II) Solving (1.4) is equivalent to the ﬁxed point problem y = Ny where N is as in
(1.11). It is easy to see that N :C[0,1] →C[0,1] is continuous and compact (since (1.9)

2. Singular boundary value problems
In Section 2.1 we discuss positone boundary value problems. Almost all singular papers in
the 1980s and 1990s were devoted to such problems. In Theorem 2.1 we present probably
the most general existence result available in the literature for positone problems. In the
late 1990s the question of multiplicity for singular positone problems was raised, and we
discuss this question in the second half of Section 2.1. Section 2.2 is devoted to singular
problems where the nonlinearity may change sign.
2.1. Positone problems
In this section we discuss the Dirichlet boundary value problem

y′′ + q(t)f (t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = 0 = y(1).
(2.1)
Here the nonlinearity f may be singular at y = 0 and q may be singular at t = 0 and/or
t = 1. We begin by showing that (2.1) has a C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) solution. To do so we
ﬁrst establish, via Theorem 1.3, the existence of a C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) solution, for each
m = 1,2,..., to the “modiﬁed” problem
y′′ + q(t)f (t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = 1
m = y(1).
(2.2)m
To show that (2.1) has a solution we let m →∞; the key idea in this step is the Arzela–
Ascoli theorem.

Then (2.1) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y > 0 on (0,1) and |y|0 < r.

Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be chosen so that 1
n0 < ε and let N0 = {n0,n0 +1,...}. To show (2.2)m,
m ∈N0, has a solution we examine

To show (2.10)m has a solution for each m ∈N0 we will apply Theorem 1.3. Consider the

where 0 < λ < 1. Let y be a solution of (2.11)m

Also there exists tm ∈(0,1) with y′ ⩾0 on (0,tm) and y′ ⩽0 on (tm,1). For x ∈(0,1) we

This together with (2.9) implies |y|0 ̸= r. Then Theorem 1.3 implies that (2.10)m has a
solution ym with |ym|0 ⩽r. In fact (as above),
1
m ⩽ym(t) < r
for t ∈[0,1].
Next we obtain a sharper lower bound on ym, namely we will show that there exists a
constant k > 0, independent of m, with
ym(t) ⩾kt(1 −t)
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.15)
To see this notice (2.6) guarantees the existence of a function ψr(t) continuous on [0,1]
and positive on (0,1) with f (t,u) ⩾ψr(t) for (t,u) ∈(0,1) × (0,r]. Now, using the
Green’s function representation for the solution of (2.10)m, we have

Now it is easy to check (as in Theorem 1.3) that

r(0) = k0; otherwise
Φ′
r(0) = ∞. In either case there exists a constant k1, independent of m, with Φ′
r(0) ⩾k1.
Thus there is an ε > 0 with Φr(t) ⩾1
2k1t ⩾1
2k1t(1 −t) for t ∈[0,ε]. Similarly there is
a constant k2, independent of m, with −Φ′
r(1) ⩾k2. Thus there is a δ > 0 with Φr(t) ⩾
1
2k2(1 −t) ⩾1
2k2t(1 −t) for t ∈[1 −δ,1]. Finally since Φr(t)
t(1−t) is bounded on [ε,1 −δ]
there is a constant k, independent of m, with Φr(t) ⩾kt(1 −t) on [0,1], i.e., (2.15) is true.
Next we will show
{ym}m∈N0
is a bounded, equicontinuous family on [0,1].
(2.17)
Returning to (2.12) (with y replaced by ym) we have

(2.18)
Now since y′′
m ⩽0 on (0,1) and ym ⩾1
m on [0,1] there exists tm ∈(0,1) with y′
m ⩾0 on
(0,tm) and y′
m ⩽0 on (tm,1). Integrate (2.18) from t (t < tm) to tm to obtain

On the other hand integrate (2.18) from tm to t (t > tm) to obtain

(2.20)
We now claim that there exists a0 and a1 with a0 > 0, a1 < 1, a0 < a1 with
a0 < inf{tm: m ∈N0} ⩽sup{tm: m ∈N0} < a1.
(2.21)
REMARK 2.1. Here tm (as before) is the unique point in (0,1) with y′
m(tm) = 0.
We now show inf{tm: m ∈N0} > 0. If this is not true then there is a subsequence S of
N0 with tm →0 as m →∞in S. Now integrate (2.19) from 0 to tm to obtain

12
R.P. Agarwal and D. O’Regan
as m →∞in S. This contradicts (2.15). Consequently inf{tm: m ∈N0} > 0. A similar
argument shows sup{tm: m ∈N0} < 1. Let a0 and a1 be chosen as in (2.21). Now (2.19),
(2.20) and (2.21) imply

Note I is an increasing map from [0,∞) onto [0,∞) (notice I(∞) = ∞since g > 0 is

now establishes (2.17).
The Arzela–Ascoli theorem guarantees the existence of a subsequence N of N0 and a
function y ∈C[0,1] with ym converging uniformly on [0,1] to y as m →∞through N.
Also y(0) = y(1) = 0, |y|0 ⩽r and y(t) ⩾kt(1 −t) for t ∈[0,1]. In particular y > 0 on
(0,1). Fix t ∈(0,1) (without loss of generality assume t ̸= 1

We can do this argument for each t ∈(0,1) and so y′′(t)+q(t)f (t,y(t)) = 0 for 0 < t < 1.
Finally it is easy to see that |y|0 < r (note if |y|0 = r then following essentially the argu-
ment from (2.12)–(2.14) will yield a contradiction).

THEOREM 2.2. Let E = (E,∥· ∥) be a Banach space and let K ⊂E be a cone in E. Also
r,R are constants with 0 < r < R. Suppose A:ΩR ∩K →K (here ΩR = {x ∈E: ∥x∥<
R}) is a continuous, compact map and assume the following conditions hold:
x ̸= λA(x)
for λ ∈[0,1) and x ∈∂EΩr ∩K
(2.26)
and
there exists a v ∈K\{0} with x ̸= A(x) + δv
for any δ > 0 and x ∈∂EΩR ∩K.
(2.27)
Then A has a ﬁxed point in K ∩{x ∈E: r ⩽∥x∥⩽R}.

THEOREM 2.3. Let E = (E,∥· ∥) be a Banach space, K ⊂E a cone and let ∥· ∥be
increasing with respect to K. Also r,R are constants with 0 < r < R. Suppose A:ΩR ∩
K →K (here ΩR = {x ∈E: ∥x∥< R}) is a continuous, compact map and assume the
following conditions hold:
x ̸= λA(x)
for λ ∈[0,1) and x ∈∂EΩr ∩K
(2.28)
and
∥Ax∥> ∥x∥
for x ∈∂EΩR ∩K.
(2.29)
Then A has a ﬁxed point in K ∩{x ∈E: r ⩽∥x∥⩽R}.
PROOF. Notice (2.29) guarantees that (2.27) is true. This is a standard argument and for
completeness we supply it here. Suppose there exists v ∈K\{0} with x = A(x) + δv for
some δ > 0 and x ∈∂EΩR ∩K. Then since ∥· ∥is increasing with respect to K we have
since δv ∈K,
∥x∥= ∥Ax + δv∥⩾∥Ax∥> ∥x∥,
a contradiction. The result now follows from Theorem 2.2.
□
REMARK 2.3. In Theorem 2.3 if (2.28) and (2.29) are replaced by
x ̸= λA(x)

and
∥Ax∥> ∥x∥
for x ∈∂EΩr ∩K.
(2.29)⋆
then A has a ﬁxed point in K ∩{x ∈E: r ⩽∥x∥⩽R}.
Now E = (C[0,1],| · |0) (here |u|0 = supt∈[0,1] |u(t)|, u ∈C[0,1]) will be our Banach
space and
K = y ∈C[0,1]: y(t) ⩾0,t ∈[0,1] and y(t) concave on [0,1].

A standard argument implies A:K →C[0,1] is continuous and completely continuous.
Next we show A:K →K. If u ∈K then clearly Au(t) ⩾0 for t ∈[0,1]. Also notice that

so Au(t) is concave on [0,1]. Consequently Au ∈K so A:K →K. Let

We ﬁrst show
y ̸= λAy
for λ ∈[0,1] and y ∈K ∩∂Ω1.
(2.43)
Suppose this is false, i.e., suppose there exists y ∈K ∩∂Ω1 and λ ∈[0,1) with y = λAy.
We can assume λ ̸= 0. Now since y = λAy we have

To see this let y ∈K ∩∂Ω2 so |y|0 = R. Also since y(t) is concave on [0,1] (since y ∈K)

Now Theorem 2.3 implies A has a ﬁxed point ym ∈K ∩(Ω2\Ω1), i.e., r ⩽|ym|0 ⩽R.
In fact |ym|0 > r (note if |ym|0 = r then following essentially the same argument from
(2.45)–(2.48) will yield a contradiction). Consequently (2.40)m (and also (2.39)m) has a
solution ym ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1), ym ∈K, with
1
m ⩽ym(t)
for t ∈[0,1], r < |ym|0 ⩽R
(2.51)
and (from Theorem 2.4, note ym ∈K)
ym(t) ⩾t(1 −t)r
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.52)
Next we will show
{ym}m∈N0
is a bounded, equicontinuous family on [0,1].
(2.53)
Returning to (2.45) (with y replaced by ym) we have

for x ∈(0,1).
(2.54)
Now since y′′
m ⩽0 on (0,1) and ym ⩾1
m on [0,1] there exists tm ∈(0,1) with y′
m ⩾0 on
(0,tm) and y′
m ⩽0 on (tm,1). Integrate (2.54) from t (t < tm) to tm to obtain

On the other hand integrate (2.54) from tm to t (t > tm) to obtain

We now claim that there exists a0 and a1 with a0 > 0, a1 < 1, a0 < a1 with
a0 < inf{tm: m ∈N0} ⩽sup{tm: m ∈N0} < a1.
(2.57)
REMARK 2.5. Here tm (as before) is the unique point in (0,1) with y′
m(tm) = 0.
We now show inf{tm: m ∈N0} > 0. If this is not true then there is a subsequence S of
N0 with tm →0 as m →∞in S. Now integrate (2.55) from 0 to tm to obtain

R.P. Agarwal and D. O’Regan
as m →∞in S. This contradicts (2.52). Consequently inf{tm: m ∈N0} > 0. A similar
argument shows sup{tm: m ∈N0} < 1. Let a0 and a1 be chosen as in (2.57). Now (2.55),
(2.56) and (2.57) imply

The Arzela–Ascoli theorem guarantees the existence of a subsequence N of N0 and
a function y ∈C[0,1] with ym converging uniformly on [0,1] to y as m →∞through
N. Also y(0) = y(1) = 0, r ⩽|y|0 ⩽R and y(t) ⩾t(1 −t)r for t ∈[0,1]. In particular
y > 0 on (0,1). Fix t ∈(0,1) (without loss of generality assume t ̸= 1

We can do this argument for each t ∈(0,1) and so y′′(t) + q(t)[g(y(t)) + h(y(t))] = 0 for
0 < t < 1. Finally it is easy to see that |y|0 > r (note if |y|0 = r then following essentially
the argument from (2.45)–(2.48) will yield a contradiction).
□
REMARK 2.6. If in (2.36) we have R < r then (2.25) has a solution y ∈C[0,1]∩C2(0,1)
with y > 0 on (0,1) and R ⩽|y|0 < r. The argument is similar to that in Theorem 2.6
except here we use Remark 2.3.
REMARK 2.7. It is also possible to use the ideas in Theorem 2.6 to discuss other boundary
conditions; for example y′(0) = y(1) = 0.
REMARK 2.8. If we use Krasnoselski’s ﬁxed point theorem in a cone we need more that
(2.31)–(2.34), (2.36) to establish the existence of a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with
y > 0 on (0,1) and r < |y|0 ⩽R. This is because (2.43) is less restrictive than |Ay|0 ⩽|y|0
for y ∈K ∩∂Ω1.
THEOREM 2.7. Assume (2.31)–(2.34) and (2.36) hold. Then (2.25) has two solutions
y1,y2 ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y1 > 0, y2 > 0 on (0,1) and |y1|0 < r < |y2|0 ⩽R.
PROOF. The existence of y1 follows from Theorem 2.5 and the existence of y2 follows
from Theorem 2.6.

To see this we will apply Theorem 2.7 with q =

so there exists R > 1 with (2.36) holding. The result now follows from Theorem 2.7.
2.2. Singular problems with sign changing nonlinearities
In this section we discuss the Dirichlet singular boundary value problem

y′′ + q(t)f (t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = 0,
(2.62)
where our nonlinearity f may change sign. We ﬁrst present a variation of the classical
theory of upper and lower solutions in this section so that (2.62) can be discussed in its
natural setting. We assume the following conditions hold:

(2.66)
THEOREM 2.8. Suppose (2.63)–(2.66) hold. Then (2.62) has a solution y (here y ∈
C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1)) with α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽β(t) for t ∈[0,1].
PROOF. To show (2.62) has a solution we consider the problem

y′′ + q(t)f ⋆(t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = 0.
(2.67)
Theorem 1.4 guarantees that (2.67) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1). The result of our
theorem will follow once we show
α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.68)
We now show
y(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.69)
Suppose (2.69) is not true. Then y −β has a positive absolute maximum at t1 ∈(0,1). As
a result (y −β)′(t1) = 0 and (y −β)′′(t1) ⩽0. However since y(t1) > β(t1) we have
(y −β)′′(t1) = −q(t1)f t1,β(t1) + rβ(t1) −y(t1) −β′′(t1)

a contradiction. Thus (2.69) is true. Similarly we can show
α(t) ⩽y(t)
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.70)
Our result follows.

In general if we construct an upper solution β and a lower solution α to (2.62), usually
it is difﬁcult to check (2.66). As a result it is of interest to provide an alternative approach
and to provide conditions that are easy to verify in applications.

From Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem we know that (2.76) has a solution yn0 ∈C[0,1] ∩
C2(0,1). We ﬁrst show
yn0(t) ⩾αn0(t),
t ∈[0,1].
(2.77)
Suppose (2.77) is not true. Then yn0 −αn0 has a negative absolute minimum at τ ∈(0,1).
Now since yn0(0) −αn0(0) = 0 = yn0(1) −αn0(1) there exists τ0,τ1 ∈[0,1] with τ ∈
(τ1,τ2) and
yn0(τ0) −αn0(τ0) = yn0(τ1) −αn0(τ1) = 0

(yn0 −αn0)′′(t) < 0
for a.e. t ∈(τ0,τ1).

Thus (2.80) holds, so we have

Now proceed inductively to construct yn0+2,yn0+3,... as follows. Suppose we have yk

the boundary value problem

Now Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem guarantees that (2.86) has a solution yk+1 ∈C[0,1]∩

α(t) ⩽αk+1(t) ⩽yk+1(t) ⩽yk(t)

Thus for each n ∈{n0 + 1,...} we have

We can do this argument for each t ∈(0,1) and so y′′(t)+q(t)f (t,y(t)) = 0 for t ∈(0,1).
It remains to show y is continuous at 0 and 1.
Let ε > 0 be given. Now since limn→∞yn(0) = 0 there exists n1 ∈{n0,n0 +1,...} with
yn1(0) < ε
2. Since yn1 ∈C[0,1] there exists δn1 > 0 with
yn1(t) < ε
2
for t ∈[0,δn1].
Now for n ⩾n1 we have, since {yn(t)} is nonincreasing for each t ∈[0,1],
α(t) ⩽yn(t) ⩽yn1(t) < ε
2
for t ∈[0,δn1].
Consequently
α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽ε
2 < ε
for t ∈(0,δn1]
and so y is continuous at 0. Similarly y is continuous at 1. As a result y ∈C[0,1].

it is false. Then α −β would have a positive absolute maximum at say τ0 ∈(0,1), so
(α −β)′(τ0) = 0 and (α −β)′′(τ0) ⩽0. Now α(τ0) > β(τ0) and (2.90) implies

Let εn = ρn (and n ⩾n0) and let λ be as in Lemma 2.13. From (2.96) there exists k0 > 0
with
q(t)f (t,y) ⩾k0
for (t,y) ∈(0,1) ×

y ∈(0,∞): y ⩽λ(t)

q(t)f (t,y) + α′′(t) ⩾k0 + α′′(t) > 0
for (t,y) ∈(0,1) × {y ∈(0,∞): y ⩽α(t)}. Thus (2.74) and (2.90) hold.
THEOREM 2.14. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (2.71), (2.73), (2.91) and (2.96)
hold. Then (2.62) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1).
If in (2.96) we replace
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 with

2n+1 then (2.74) and (2.90)
also hold. We combine this with Corollary 2.12 to obtain our next result.
THEOREM 2.15. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (2.71), (2.73), (2.95) and (2.96)
(with

y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1).
Looking at Theorem 2.14 we see that the main difﬁculty when discussing examples is
the construction of the β in (2.91). Our next result replaces (2.91) with a superlinear type
condition. We ﬁrst prove the result in its full generality.

Let m0 ∈{1,2,...} be chosen so that ρm0 < ε and without loss of generality assume m0 ⩽

yn0(t) ⩽M

(2.102)
Suppose (2.102) is false. Now since yn0(0) = yn0(1) = ρn0 there exists either
(i) t1,t2 ∈(0,1), t2 < t1 with αn0(t) ⩽yn0(t) ⩽M for t ∈[0,t2), yn0(t2) = M and

Essentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 2.9 (from (2.82) onwards) completes the
proof.

Similarly we have the following result.
THEOREM 2.17. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (2.71), (2.73), (2.74), (2.93),
(2.98) and (2.99) hold. In addition assume there exists
M > sup

with (2.100) holding. Then (2.62) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) ⩾α(t)

Then (2.62) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) ⩾α(t) for t ∈[0,1].
PROOF. The result follows immediately from Theorem 2.16 once we show α(t) ⩽M for
t ∈[0,1]. Suppose this is false. Now since α(0) = α(1) = 0 there exists either
(i) t1,t2 ∈(0,1), t2 < t1 with 0 ⩽α(t) ⩽M for t ∈[0,t2), α(t2) = M and α(t) > M
on (t2,t1) with α′(t1) = 0; or
(ii) t3,t4 ∈(0,1), t4 < t3 with 0 ⩽α(t) ⩽M for t ∈(t3,1], α(t3) = M and α(t) > M
on (t4,t3) with α′(t4) = 0.

Next we present some examples which illustrate how easily the theory is applied in
practice.
EXAMPLE 2.2. Consider the boundary value problem
y′′ + Atγ y−θ −μ2 = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = 0
(2.107)
with A > 0, θ > 0, γ > −2 and μ ∈R. Then (2.107) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1)
with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1).
To see this we will apply Theorem 2.20. We will consider two cases, namely γ ⩾0 and
−2 < γ < 0.
Case (i). γ ⩾0.
We will apply Theorem 2.20 with
q(t) = 1,
g(y) = Ay−θ
and
h(y) = μ2.
Clearly (2.71), (2.73), (2.98) and (2.99) hold. Let
n0 = 1,
ρn =

A
2(n+1)γ (μ2 + 1)

and
k0 = 1.
Notice for n ∈{1,2,...},

q(t)f (t,y) ⩾
A
2(n+1)γ ρθn
−μ2 =

so (2.96) is satisﬁed. Finally notice for c > 0 that

g(u) = ∞.
Thus there exists M > 0 with (2.105) holding. Existence of a solution is now guaranteed
from Theorem 2.20.
Case (ii). −2 < γ < 0.
We will apply Theorem 2.20 with
q(t) = tγ ,
g(y) = Ay−θ
and
h(y) = μ2.

R.P. Agarwal and D. O’Regan
Clearly (2.71), (2.73), (2.98) and (2.99) hold. Also as in Case (i) there exists M > 0 with
(2.105) holding. Let
n0 = 1,
ρn =

and
k0 = 1.
Notice for n ∈{1,2,...},

where μ2 ⩾1. Then (2.108) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) > 0 for t ∈
(0,1).
To see that (2.108) has the desired solution we will apply Theorem 2.14 with
q ≡1,
ρn =

and
k0 = a;
here a > 0 is chosen so that a ⩽1

(2.71) and (2.73) hold. Notice for n ∈{1,2,...},
1

In the literature nonresonant results [19] have been presented for nonsingular Dirichlet
problems, i.e., for (1.2) when qf is a Carathéodory function. Next, by combining some of
the ideas in [19] with those above, we present a nonresonant theory for the singular problem
(2.62). It is worth remarking here that we could consider Sturm Liouville boundary data
in (2.62); however since the arguments are essentially the same (in fact easier) we will
restrict our discussion to Dirichlet boundary data.
The results here rely on the following well-known Rayleigh–Ritz inequality.
THEOREM 2.22. Suppose q ∈C(0,1) ∩L1[0,1] with q > 0 on (0,1). Let λ1 be the ﬁrst
eigenvalue of
y′′ + λqy = 0,

We begin with our main result (in fact a more general result will be presented at the end of
this section; see Theorem 2.26)).

f (t,u)


 ⩽a0u + b0uγ + hε(t) for t ∈(0,1) and u ⩾ε;
(2.112)
here λ1 is the ﬁrst eigenvalue of (2.109). Then (2.62) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1)
with y(t) ⩾α(t) for t ∈[0,1].
PROOF. For n = n0, n0 + 1,... let en, θn, fn and gn be as in Theorem 2.9. Without loss
of generality assume ρn0 ⩽mint∈[ 1
3 , 2
3 ] α(t). Fix n ∈{n0,n0 + 1,...}. Let tn ∈[0, 1
3] and
sn ∈[ 2
3,1] be such that
α(tn) = α(sn) = ρn
and
α(t) ⩽ρn
for t ∈[0,tn] ∪[sn,1].
Deﬁne
αn(t) =

ρn
if t ∈[0,tn] ∪[sn,1],
α(t)
if t ∈(tn,sn).
We begin with the boundary value problem
y′′ + q(t)g⋆
n0(t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = ρn0;
(2.113)
here

n0(t,y) =

⎩
gn0
t,αn0(t) + rαn0(t) −y,
y ⩽αn0(t),
gn0(t,y),
αn0(t) ⩽y ⩽M,
gn0(t,M) + r(M −y),
y ⩾M,
with r :R →[−1,1] the radial retraction deﬁned by
r(u) =
u,
|u| ⩽1,
u
|u|,
|u| > 1,
and M(⩾sup[0,1] αn0(t)) is a predetermined constant (see (2.117)). From Schauder’s ﬁxed
point theorem we know that (2.113) has a solution yn0 ∈C1[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) (notice from
(2.112) that for any constants r1 > 0, r2 > r1, ∃hr1,r2 ∈L1
q[0,1] with |f (t,u)| ⩽hr1,r2(t)
for t ∈(0,1) and r1 ⩽u ⩽r2). Exactly the same analysis as in Theorem 2.9 guarantees
that
yn0(t) ⩾αn0(t),
t ∈[0,1],
(2.114)

A survey of recent results for initial and boundary value problems
45
and so
α(t) ⩽αn0(t) ⩽yn0(t)
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.115)
Next we show
yn0(t) ⩽M
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.116)
Now (2.112) (with ε = min[0,1] αn0(t)) and the deﬁnition of g⋆

(2.117)
Consequently (2.116) holds and so we have
α(t) ⩽αn0(t) ⩽yn0(t) ⩽M
for t ∈[0,1].
Next we consider the boundary value problem
y′′ + q(t)g⋆
n0+1(t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = ρn0+1;

Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem guarantees that (2.118) has a solution yn0+1 ∈C1[0,1] ∩
C2(0,1). Exactly the same analysis as in Theorem 2.9 guarantees
α(t) ⩽αn0+1(t) ⩽yn0+1(t) ⩽yn0(t)
for t ∈[0,1].
(2.119)
Now proceed inductively to construct yn0+2,yn0+3,... as follows. Suppose we have yk for
some k ∈{n0 + 1,n0 + 2,...} with αk(t) ⩽yk(t) ⩽yk−1(t) for t ∈[0,1]. Then consider
the boundary value problem
y′′ + q(t)g⋆
k+1(t,y) = 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = ρk+1;

Now Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem guarantees that (2.120) has a solution yk+1 ∈
C1[0,1] ∩C2(0,1), and essentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 2.9 yields
α(t) ⩽αk+1(t) ⩽yk+1(t) ⩽yk(t)
for t ∈[0,1].
Thus for each n ∈{n0 + 1,...} we have
α(t) ⩽yn(t) ⩽yn−1(t) ⩽··· ⩽yn0(t) ⩽M
for t ∈[0,1].
Essentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 2.9 (from (2.89) onwards) completes the
proof.

REMARK 2.10. In (2.72) it is possible to replace

2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 with 0 ⩽t ⩽1 −
1
2n+1 or
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 −
1
2n+1 and the result in Theorem 2.23 is again true; the minor adjustments
are left to the reader.
Next we discuss the lower solution α in (2.74). Suppose (2.96) holds. Then the argu-
ment before Theorem 2.14 guarantees that there exists a α ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1), α(0) =
α(1) = 0, α(t) ⩽ρn0 for t ∈[0,1] with (2.74) holding. Combine with Theorem 2.23 to
obtain our next result.
THEOREM 2.24. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (2.96), (2.110), (2.111) and
(2.112) hold. Then (2.62) has a solution y ∈C[0,1]∩C2(0,1) with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1).
If in (2.96) we replace
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 with
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 −
1
2n+1 then once again (2.74)
holds.
THEOREM 2.25. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (2.110), (2.111), (2.112) and
(2.96) (with
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 replaced by
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1−
1
2n+1 ) hold. Then (2.62) has a solution
y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1).
EXAMPLE 2.4. Consider the boundary value problem
y′′ +

Atκy−θ + a0y + b0yγ −μ2
= 0,
0 < t < 1,
y(0) = y(1) = 0
(2.121)
with A > 0, κ > −1, θ > 0, 0 ⩽γ < 1, 0 ⩽a0 < π2, b0 ⩾0 and μ ∈R. Then (2.121) has
a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1) with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,1).

48
R.P. Agarwal and D. O’Regan
To see this we will apply Theorem 2.24 with
q = 1
and
f (t,y) = Atκy−θ + a0y + b0yγ −μ2.
Clearly (2.110) and (2.111) hold. In addition (2.112) is immediate with hε(t) = Atκε−θ +
μ2; note λ1 = π2. We will consider two cases, namely κ ⩾0 and −1 < κ < 0.
Case (i). κ ⩾0.
Let
n0 = 1,
ρn =

A
2(n+1)κ(μ2 + 1)
1/θ
and
k0 = 1.
Notice for n ∈{1,2,...},
1
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽1 and 0 < y ⩽ρn that we have
q(t)f (t,y) ⩾
A
2(n+1)κρθn
−μ2 =


−μ2 = 1,
so (2.96) holds.
Case (ii). −1 < κ < 0.
Let
n0 = 1,
ρn =

1/θ
and
k0 = 1.
Notice for n ∈{1,2,...},
1

q(t)f (t,y) ⩾Atκ

ρθn
−μ2 = n

μ2 + 1

−μ2 ⩾

μ2 + 1

so (2.96) holds.
Existence of a solution is now guaranteed from Theorem 2.24.
If one uses the ideas in [19, Chapter 11] it is possible to improve the result in Theorem
2.23.
THEOREM 2.26. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (2.72), (2.74), (2.110) and

here λ1 is the ﬁrst eigenvalue of (2.109). Then (2.62) has a solution y ∈C[0,1] ∩C2(0,1)
with y(t) ⩾α(t) for t ∈[0,1].
PROOF. Proceed as in Theorem 2.23 and obtain a solution yn0 of (2.113) with

Next we show
yn0(t) ⩽M

(2.124)
where M (⩾sup[0,1] αn0(t)) is a predetermined constant (see below). Notice (2.123) (with

REMARK 2.11. We can replace (2.72) and (2.74) in Theorem 2.26 with (2.96).
3. Singular initial value problems
In this section we discuss the singular initial value problem

y′ = q(t)f (t,y),
0 < t < T (< ∞),
y(0) = 0,
(3.1)
where our nonlinearity f may change sign. We ﬁrst present a variation of the classical
theory of upper and lower solutions. We will assume the following conditions hold:
⎧
⎨
⎩
there exists β ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with
β ∈AC[0,T ],β(0) ⩾0, and
q(t)f

t,β(t)

⩽β′(t) for t ∈(0,T ),
(3.2)
⎧
⎨
⎩
there exists α ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with
α ∈AC[0,T ],α(t) ⩽β(t) on [0,T ],α(0) ⩽0
and q(t)f

t,α(t)

⩾α′(t) for t ∈(0,T )
(3.3)
and
q ∈C(0,T ] ∩L1[0,T ]
with q > 0 on (0,T ].
(3.4)
Let

f t,α(t) + rα(t) −y,
y ⩽α(t),
where r : R →[−1,1] is the radial retraction. Finally we assume
f ⋆:[0,T ] × R →R
is continuous.
(3.5)
THEOREM 3.1. Suppose (3.2)–(3.5) hold. Then (3.1) has a solution y (here y ∈C[0,T ] ∩
C1(0,T ] with y ∈AC[0,T ]) with α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽β(t) for t ∈[0,T ].
PROOF. To show (3.1) has a solution we consider the problem

y′ = q(t)f ⋆(t,y),
0 < t < T,
y(0) = 0.
(3.6)

52
R.P. Agarwal and D. O’Regan
Now Theorem 1.4 guarantees that (3.6) has a solution y ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with y ∈
AC[0,T ]. The result of our theorem will follow once we show
α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.7)
We now show
y(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.8)
Suppose (3.8) is not true. Then since y(0) ⩽β(0) there exists t1 < t2 ∈[0,T ] with
y(t1) = β(t1),
y(t2) > β(t2)
and
y(t) > β(t)
on (t1,t2).
Thus
y(t2) −y(t1) =

i.e., y(t2) < β(t2), a contradiction. Thus (3.8) is true. A similar argument shows
α(t) ⩽y(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.9)
Our result follows.
□
Again because of the difﬁculties encountered with checking (3.5) it is of interest to
provide an alternative approach and to present conditions that are easy to verify in applica-
tions.
Our main result can be stated immediately.

Notice αn+1(t) ⩽αn(t),t ∈[0,T ], for each n ∈{n0,n0 +1,...} since {ρn} is a nonincreas-
ing sequence. We begin with the initial value problem
y′ = q(t)g⋆

From Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem we know that (3.15) has a solution yn0 ∈C[0,T ] ∩
C1(0,T ]. We ﬁrst show
yn0(t) ⩾αn0(t),
t ∈[0,T ].
(3.16)
Suppose (3.16) is not true. Then there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with
yn0(τ1) = αn0(τ1),
yn0(τ2) < αn0(τ2)
and
yn0(t) < αn0(t)
for t ∈(τ1,τ2).
Of course
yn0(τ2) −αn0(τ2) =

(3.17)
We now claim
(yn0 −αn0)′(t) ⩾0
for a.e. t ∈(τ1,τ2).
(3.18)
If (3.18) is true then (3.17) implies
yn0(τ2) −αn0(τ2) ⩾0,
a contradiction. As a result if we show (3.18) is true then (3.16) will follow. To see (3.18)
we will show
(yn0 −αn0)′(t) ⩾0
for t ∈(τ1,τ2) provided t ̸= tn0.

we have gn0(t,x) ⩾f (t,x) and gn0(t,x) ⩾f (

Consequently (3.18) (and so (3.16)) holds and now since α(t) ⩽αn0(t) for t ∈[0,T ]
we have
α(t) ⩽αn0(t) ⩽yn0(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.19)
Next we show
yn0(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.20)
If (3.20) is not true then there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with
yn0(τ1) = β(τ1),

τ1 <

2n0+1 < τ2.
Case (i).
T
2n0+1 ⩽τ1.
Since gn0(t,x) = f (t,x) for (t,x) ∈(τ1,τ2) × (0,∞) we have

Combine to obtain

Thus (3.20) holds, so we have
α(t) ⩽αn0(t) ⩽yn0(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].

Next we consider

Now Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem guarantees that (3.21) has a solution yn0+1 ∈
C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ]. We ﬁrst show
yn0+1(t) ⩾αn0+1(t),
t ∈[0,T ].
(3.22)
Suppose (3.22) is not true. Then there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with
yn0+1(τ1) = αn0+1(τ1),
yn0+1(τ2) < αn0+1(τ2)
and
yn0+1(t) < αn0+1(t)
for t ∈(τ1,τ2).
If we show
(yn0+1 −αn0+1)′(t) ⩾0
for a.e. t ∈(τ1,τ2),
(3.23)
then as before (3.22) is true. Fix t ∈(τ1,τ2) and assume t ̸= tn0+1. Then

Case (i). t ⩾

Then since gn0+1(t,x) = f (t,x) for x ∈(0,∞) we have

Consequently (3.23) is true so
α(t) ⩽αn0+1(t) ⩽yn0+1(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.24)
Next we show
yn0+1(t) ⩽yn0(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.25)
If (3.25) is not true then there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with
yn0+1(τ1) = yn0(τ1),
yn0+1(τ2) > yn0(τ2)
and
yn0+1(t) > yn0(t)
for t ∈(τ1,τ2).
Notice also since gn0(t,x) ⩾gn0+1(t,x) for (t,x) ∈(0,T ) × (0,∞) that

Now proceed inductively to construct yn0+2,yn0+3,... as follows. Suppose we have
yk for some k ∈{n0 + 1,n0 + 2,...} with αk(t) ⩽yk(t) ⩽yk−1(t) for t ∈[0,T ]. Then
consider the boundary value problem

y′ = q(t)g⋆
k+1(t,y),
0 < t < T,
y(0) = ρk+1;

y ⩾yk(t).
Now Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem guarantees that (3.26) has a solution yk+1 ∈C[0,T ]∩
C1(0,T ], and essentially the same reasoning as above yields
α(t) ⩽αk+1(t) ⩽yk+1(t) ⩽yk(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.27)
Thus for each n ∈{n0,n0 + 1,...} we have
α(t) ⩽yn(t) ⩽yn−1(t) ⩽··· ⩽yn0(t) ⩽β(t)
for t ∈[0,T ].

Deﬁne a function y :[0,T ] →[0,∞) by y(x) = zk(x) on [ T

y is well deﬁned and α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽yn0(t)(⩽β(t)) for t ∈(0,T ). Fix t ∈(0,T ) and let
m ∈{n0,n0 + 1,...} be such that

We can do this argument for each t ∈(0,T ). It remains to show y is continuous at 0.
Let ε > 0 be given. Now since limn→∞yn(0) = 0 there exists n1 ∈{n0,n0 +1,...} with
yn1(0) < ε
2. Since yn1 ∈C[0,T ] there exists δn1 > 0 with
yn1(t) < ε
2
for t ∈[0,δn1].
Now for n ⩾n1 we have, since {yn(t)} is nonincreasing for each t ∈[0,T ],
α(t) ⩽yn(t) ⩽yn1(t) < ε
2
for t ∈[0,δn1].
Consequently
α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽ε
2 < ε
for t ∈(0,δn1],
and so y is continuous at 0. Thus y ∈C[0,T ].

false. Then there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with

let n ∈{n0,n0 + 1,...} and associated with each n we

Then an argument similar to the one before Theorem 2.14 guarantees that there exists a
α ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ], α(0) = 0, α > 0 for t ∈(0,T ], α(t) ⩽ρn0 for t ∈[0,T ] with
(3.13) and (3.30) holding. We combine this with Corollary 3.3 to obtain our next result.
THEOREM 3.4. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (3.10), (3.11), (3.31), and (3.32)
hold. Then (3.1) has a solution y ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,T ].
Looking at Theorem 3.4 we see that the main difﬁculty when discussing examples is the
construction of the β in (3.31). Our next result replaces (3.31) with a growth condition.
We ﬁrst present the result in its full generality.
THEOREM 3.5. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (3.10)–(3.13) hold. Also assume

[0,T ].

Without loss of generality assume G(ρn0) < ε. Let en, θn, fn, gn and αn be as in Theo-

Essentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 3.2 implies that (3.15) has a solution yn0
with yn0(t) ⩾αn0(t) ⩾α(t) for t ∈[0,T ]. Next we show
yn0(t) < G−1(M)
for t ∈[0,T ].
(3.36)

Suppose (3.36) is false. Then since yn0(0) = ρn0 there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with
ρn0 ⩽yn0(t) ⩽G−1(M)
for t ∈(τ1,τ2),
with
yn0(τ1) = ρn0
and
yn0(τ2) = G−1(M).

Consequently vn0(τ2) < M so yn0(τ2) < G−1(M). This is a contradiction. Thus (3.36)
holds and so
α(t) ⩽αn0(t) ⩽yn0(t) < G−1(M)
for t ∈[0,T ].

Essentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 3.2 (from (3.21) onwards) completes the

α(t) for t ∈[0,T ].
PROOF. This follows immediately from Theorem 3.5 once we show
G−1(M) > α(t)
for each t ∈[0,T ].
Suppose this is false. Then since α(0) = 0 there exists τ1 < τ2 ∈[0,T ] with
0 ⩽α(t) ⩽G−1(M)
for t ∈(τ1,τ2),α(τ1) = 0 and α(τ2) = G−1(M).
Notice (3.30) implies
α′(t) ⩽q(t)f

t,α(t)

for t ∈(τ1,τ2),
so we have
α′(t)
g(α(t)) ⩽q(t)

for t ∈(τ1,τ2).
Integrate from τ1 to τ2 to obtain

Thus v(τ2) < M, so α(τ2) < G−1(M), a contradiction.

THEOREM 3.7. Let n0 ∈{1,2,...} be ﬁxed and suppose (3.10), (3.11), (3.32) and (3.33)
hold. In addition assume there is a constant M > 0 with (3.38) holding. Then (3.1) has a
solution y ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with y(t) > 0 for t ∈(0,T ].
Next we present some examples which illustrate how easily the theory is applied in
practice.
EXAMPLE 3.1. The initial value problem

y′ = tθy−α + yβ + A,
0 < t < T (< ∞),
y(0) = 0
(3.39)
with θ > −1, α > 0, β > 0 and A > 0 has a solution y ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with y(t) > 0
for t ∈(0,T ] if

and
C =

if θ ⩾0,

if −1 < θ < 0.
To see this we will apply Theorem 3.7. We will consider two cases, namely θ ⩾0 and
−1 < θ < 0.
Case (i). θ ⩾0.
We will apply Theorem 3.7 with
n0 = 1,
q = 1,
g(y) = T θy−α,
h(y) = yβ + A,
together with

Clearly (3.10) and (3.11) hold. Also for n ∈{1,2,...},

have

so (3.32) is satisﬁed. From (3.40) there exists M > 0 with

Existence of a solution to (3.39) is now guaranteed from Theorem 3.7.
Case (ii). −1 < θ < 0.
We will apply Theorem 3.7 with
n0 = 1,
q = tθ,
g(y) = y−α,
h(y) = T −θ
yβ + A

,
together with
ρn =

and
k0 = 1.
Clearly (3.10), (3.11) and (3.38) (as in Case (i)) hold. Also for n ∈{1,2,...},
T
2n+1 ⩽t ⩽T
and 0 < y ⩽ρn we have
q(t)f (t,y) ⩾tθy−α ⩾T θ
ραn
= n ⩾1,
so (3.32) is satisﬁed. Existence of a solution to (3.39) is now guaranteed from Theorem 3.7.
EXAMPLE 3.2. The initial value problem

y′ = tθy−α + yβ −A,
0 < t < T (< ∞),
y(0) = 0
with θ > −1, α > 0, β > 0 and A > 0 has a solution y ∈C[0,T ] ∩C1(0,T ] with y(t) > 0
for t ∈(0,T ] if (3.40) holds.
The proof is essentially the same as in Example 3.1 with

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
71
Introduction
The premises of the lower and upper solutions method can be traced back to Picard. In
1890 for partial differential equations [79] and in 1893 for ordinary differential equations
[80], he introduced monotone iterations from a lower solution. This is the starting point of
the use of lower and upper solutions in connection with monotone methods.
Independently, some of the basic ideas of the method appeared in the study of ﬁrst order
Cauchy problems made in 1915 by Perron [78] and in its extension to systems worked by
Müller [72] in 1926. These authors deduced existence of solutions together with their local-
ization between lower and upper solutions, i.e., ordered functions that satisfy differential
inequalities. A good account of this theory can be found in Szarski [100] or Walter [101].
This approach is however limited to the Cauchy problem.
The major breakthrough was due to Scorza Dragoni in 1931. In two successive pa-
pers [94] and [95], this author introduced lower and upper solutions for the boundary value
problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = A, u(b) = B,
i.e., he considered functions α, β ∈C2([a,b]) such that α ⩽β and
α′′ ⩾f (t,α,α′),
α(a) ⩽A, α(b) ⩽B,
β′′ ⩽f (t,β,β′),
β(a) ⩾A, β(b) ⩾B.
As for the Cauchy problem, he proved existence of a solution u and its localization between
the lower and the upper solutions
α ⩽u ⩽β.
Section 1 describes the present evolution of these basic ideas.
In 1972, Amann [5] associated a degree to a pair of strict lower and upper solutions. The
introduction of degree theory was essential to deal with a larger class of problems such as
multiplicity results. An outline of this approach is given in Section 2.
Another important step was due independently to Chang [17,18] and de Figueiredo and
Solimini [38]. In 1983 and 1984 respectively, they pointed out that between lower and
upper solutions the related functional has a critical point which is a minimum. This was
the starting point of results relating lower and upper solutions with the variational method.
Section 3 presents basic results in this direction.
Recent results that extend the old idea of Picard to use lower and upper solutions with
monotone methods are discussed in Section 4.
Throughout the paper we consider two basic problems, the periodic problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(0.1)
and the Dirichlet problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.
(0.2)

C. De Coster and P. Habets
Although the method applies to a larger class of boundary value problems, we restrict
attention to these two, in order to keep our work within a reasonable length. We also choose
to describe only basic results and to select a small number of applications. A more thorough
description of the method will appear in [33].
The type of nonlinearities f :D ⊂[a,b] × Rn →R (n = 1 or 2) we consider are
Carathéodory functions, which means they satisfy the Carathéodory conditions:
(a) for a.e. t ∈[a,b], the function f (t,·) with domain {z ∈Rn | (t,z) ∈D} is continu-
ous;
(b) for all z ∈Rn, the function f (·,z) with domain {t ∈[a,b] | (t,z) ∈D} is measur-
able.
If further, for some p ∈[1,∞], the Carathéodory function f satisﬁes
(c) for all r > 0, there exists h ∈Lp(a,b) such that for all (t,z) ∈D with |z| ⩽r,
|f (t,z)| ⩽h(t),
we say that f is an Lp-Carathéodory function or that it satisﬁes an Lp-Carathéodory con-
dition. The lower and upper solution method was ﬁrst developed for continuous nonlin-
earities. The generalization to Lp-Carathéodory function is by no means trivial and brings
a better understanding of the fundamentals of the method. This is why we adopted this
framework as long as it does not imply an overwhelming technicality.
In this paper, we use the following notations:
C([a,b]) is the set of continuous functions u:[a,b] →R;
C0([a,b]) is the set of functions u ∈C([a,b]), so that u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0;
C1([a,b]) is the set of differentiable functions u:[a,b] →R so that u′ ∈C([a,b]);
C1
0([a,b]) is the set of functions u ∈C1([a,b]), so that u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0;
L2(a,b) is the set of measurable functions u:[a,b] →R such that
∥u∥L2 =
 b

u(t)


2 dt
1/2
∈R;
H 1
0 (a,b) is the set of functions u ∈C0([a,b]), with a weak derivative u′ ∈L2(a,b);
W 2,1(a,b) is the set of functions u ∈C1([a,b]), with a weak second derivative u′′ ∈
L1(a,b);
given α and β ∈C([a,b]), we write α ⩽β if α(t) ⩽β(t) for all t ∈[a,b];
given α and β ∈C([a,b]), we deﬁne [α,β] = {u ∈C([a,b]) | α ⩽u ⩽β};
N0 = N \ {0}, R0 = R \ {0}.
Given u ∈C([a,b]), we deﬁne the Dini derivatives
D+u(t) = liminf
h→0+
u(t + h) −u(t)
h
,
D+u(t) = limsup
h→0+
u(t + h) −u(t)

D−u(t) = liminf
h→0−

h
,
D−u(t) = limsup
h→0−

.
Considering a function u:[a,b] →R, its periodic extension on R is the function u:R →R
deﬁned from u(t) ≡u(t + b −a).

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems

1. Well ordered lower and upper solutions
1.1. A derivative independent periodic problem
Consider the derivative independent periodic problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(1.1)
where f is an L1-Carathéodory function. Solutions of (1.1) are in W 2,1(a,b) so that it is
natural to look for lower and upper solutions which are in this space or at least which are
piecewise W 2,1. This motivates the deﬁnitions we present here. To simplify the notations,
we extend f (t,u) by periodicity, i.e., f (t,u) = f (t + b −a,u) for all (t,u) ∈R2.
DEFINITIONS 1.1. A function α ∈C([a,b]) such that α(a) = α(b) is a lower solution
of (1.1) if its periodic extension on R is such that for any t0 ∈R either D−α(t0) < D+α(t0),
or there exists an open interval I0 such that t0 ∈I0, α ∈W 2,1(I0) and, for a.e. t ∈I0,
α′′(t) ⩾f

t,α(t)

.
A function β ∈C([a,b]) such that β(a) = β(b) is an upper solution of (1.1) if its peri-
odic extension on R is such that for any t0 ∈R either D−β(t0) > D+β(t0), or there exists
an open interval I0 such that t0 ∈I0, β ∈W 2,1(I0) and, for a.e. t ∈I0,
β′′(t) ⩽f

t,β(t)

.
Notice that the condition D−α(t0) < D+α(t0) cannot hold for all t0 ∈[a,b]. In practical
problems it only holds at a ﬁnite number of points. Further the “natural” lower and upper
solutions are often more regular than needed in Deﬁnitions 1.1. For example, a lower so-
lution α will often be produced as the solution of some auxiliary problem so that it will be
in W 2,1(a,b) and satisfy for a.e. t ∈[a,b]
α′′(t) ⩾f

t,α(t)

,
α(a) = α(b), α′(a) ⩾α′(b).
The following theorem is the basic existence result of the lower and upper solutions
method for solutions of the periodic problem (1.1).
THEOREM 1.1. Let α and β be lower and upper solutions of (1.1) such that α ⩽β,
E =

(t,u) ∈[a,b] × R | α(t) ⩽u ⩽β(t)

(1.2)
and f :E →R be an L1-Carathéodory function. Then the problem (1.1) has at least one
solution u ∈W 2,1(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).

PROOF. We consider the modiﬁed problem

Claim 1. The problem (1.3) has at least one solution. Let us write (1.3) as an integral
equation
u(t) =

where G(t,s) is the Green’s function corresponding to the problem
u′′ −u = f (t),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).

is completely continuous and bounded. By Schauder’s theorem, T has a ﬁxed point which
is a solution of (1.3).
Claim 2. All solutions u of (1.3) satisfy on [a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).
Let us assume on the contrary that, for some t0 ∈[a,b]
min
t

u(t) −α(t)

= u(t0) −α(t0) < 0.
Extending the functions by periodicity, we have then
u′(t0) −D−α(t0) ⩽0 ⩽u′(t0) −D+α(t0)
and by deﬁnition of a lower solution u′(t0) −α′(t0) = 0. Further, there exists an open
interval I0, with t0 ∈I0, α ∈W 2,1(I0) and for almost every t ∈I0

□
Theorem 1.1 furnishes two kinds of information. It is an existence result but it gives also
a localization of the solution. In the following example, such a localization provides an
asymptotic estimate on the solution.
EXAMPLE 1.1. Consider the problem
ϵu′′ =

u −|t|
3,
u(−1) = u(1), u′(−1) = u′(1),
where ϵ > 0 is a parameter. Let k = ϵp with p ∈]0,1/4[,
α(t) = 1 −

(|t| −1)2 + k2
and
β(t) =

t2 + k2.
If ϵ is small enough, these functions are lower and upper solutions and we deduce from
Theorem 1.1 the existence of a solution u such that α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t) on [−1,1]. This
implies an asymptotic estimate
u(t) = |t| + O

ϵp
.
Notice also that in this example β′(−1) ̸= β′(1) and α is not differentiable at t = 0.
Another illustration of Theorem 1.1 is the following.
EXAMPLE 1.2. Consider the problem
u′′ = 1
√t u2 + q(t),
u(0) = u(2π), u′(0) = u′(2π),
where q ∈L1(0,2π) is such that
¯q + (2π)3/2∥˜q∥2

with ¯q = 1

 2π

q(t)dt and ˜q(t) = q(t) −¯q.

76
C. De Coster and P. Habets
Let us prove this problem has a solution u. We deﬁne w to be a solution of
w′′ = ˜q(t),
w(0) = w(2π), w′(0) = w′(2π),
and α(t) = w(t) −w(0). Hence, we have ∥α′∥∞⩽∥˜q∥L1 and for all t ∈[0,2π], |α(t)| ⩽
∥˜q∥L1t. We compute then
α′′ −1
√t α2 −q(t) ⩾−1
√t ∥˜q∥2
L1t2 −¯q ⩾−∥˜q∥2
L1(2π)3/2 −¯q ⩾0,
which proves α(t) is a lower solution. If c is a large enough positive constant then β(t) =
α(t) + c ⩾α(t) is an upper solution and existence of a solution follows from Theorem 1.1.
REMARK. Theorem 1.1 depends strongly on the ordering α ⩽β. In case this ordering is
not satisﬁed, the result does not hold as such. Consider for example the following problem.
EXAMPLE 1.3. From Fredholm alternative, it is clear that the problem
u′′ + u = sin t,
u(0) = u(2π), u′(0) = u′(2π)
has no solution. However
α(t) = 1
and
β(t) = −1
are lower and upper solutions.
REMARK. Another remark of the same type is that the result is no longer true if we allow
for α angles with opening from below. This is the case in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1.4. Consider the problem
u′′ = 1,
u(−1) = u(1), u′(−1) = u′(1).
It has no solution although α(t) = t2 −1 is almost a lower solution (i.e., α′′(t) = 2 > 1,
α(−1) = α(1)), β(t) = 1 is an upper solution (β′′(t) ⩽1, β(−1) = β(1), β′(−1) = β′(1))
and α(t) < β(t). Clearly, Theorem 1.1 does not apply here since D−α(1) > D+α(1) =
D+α(−1) which means that α is not a lower solution.
In applications it is often useful to use the maximum of lower solutions and the minimum
of upper solutions. Although it is probably true, it is not obvious with our deﬁnition that
such functions are lower and upper solutions. However, we can prove the existence of
solutions between such maximum and minimum.
THEOREM 1.2. Let αi (i = 1,...,n) be lower solutions and βj (j = 1,...,m) be upper
solutions of (1.1), α := max1⩽i⩽n αi and β := min1⩽j⩽m βj be such that α ⩽β. Deﬁne E

from (1.2) and let f :E →R be an L1-Carathéodory function. Then the problem (1.1) has
at least one solution u ∈W 2,1(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).
PROOF. Consider the modiﬁed problem
u′′ −u = ¯f (t,u) −γ (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(1.6)
where γ (t,u) is deﬁned in (1.4) and
¯f (t,u) =

f (t,u),
if α(t) < u < β(t),
max1⩽j⩽m f t,minβj(t),u,
if β(t) ⩽u.
First, we prove as in Theorem 1.1 that problem (1.6) has a solution. Let us show next that
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t)
on [a,b]. Extend α and u by periodicity and assume by contradiction that mint(u(t) −
α(t)) < 0. It follows that, for some t0 and i ∈{1,...,n}, we have mint(u(t) −α(t)) =
u(t0) −αi(t0) = mint(u(t) −αi(t)) < 0. A contradiction follows now as in the proof of
Theorem 1.1. Finally, u ⩽β follows from the same argument.
□
The next result concerns existence of minimal and maximal solutions between lower and
upper solutions.
THEOREM 1.3. Let α and β be lower and upper solutions of (1.1) such that α ⩽β. De-
ﬁne E from (1.2) and let f :E →R satisfy an L1-Carathéodory condition. Then the prob-
lem (1.1) has a minimal and a maximal solution in [α,β], i.e., solutions umin and umax
such that
α ⩽umin ⩽umax ⩽β
and any other solution u of (1.1) with α ⩽u ⩽β satisﬁes
umin ⩽u ⩽umax.
PROOF. Notice ﬁrst that solutions of (1.1) are ﬁxed points of the operator

78
C. De Coster and P. Habets
where G(t,s) is the Green’s function of (1.5). Deﬁne then the set
S = {u | u = T u, α ⩽u ⩽β}.
From Theorem 1.1, S ̸= ∅. Further S is compact as T is completely continuous. Consider
next the family of sets
Fx = {u ∈S | u ⩽x},
where x ∈S. This family has the ﬁnite intersection property as follows from Theorem 1.2.
Hence, it is known (see [60, Theorem 5.1]) that there exists
umin ∈

x∈S
Fx,
which is a minimal solution.
Similarly, we prove existence of a maximal solution.
□
The structure of the set of solutions is richer if f is nondecreasing with respect to u. In
such a case, we have a continuum of solutions as follows from the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.4. Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3 hold and f is nondecreasing with
respect to u. Then the set of solutions u of (1.1) with umin ⩽u ⩽umax is such that for any
t0 ∈[a,b] and u∗∈[umin(t0),umax(t0)] there exists one of them with u(t0) = u∗.
PROOF. Let t0 ∈[a,b] and u∗be such that umin(t0) ⩽u∗⩽umax(t0). Choose ϵ > 0 large
enough so that umax −ϵ ⩽umin + ϵ and deﬁne
α1(t) = max

umin(t),umax(t) −ϵ

,
β1(t) = min

umax(t),umin(t) + ϵ

.
Observe that umax −ϵ and umin + ϵ are respectively lower and upper solutions of (1.1). By
Theorem 1.2, the problem (1.1) has a solution u1 such that, for all t ∈[a,b],
umin(t) ⩽u1(t) ⩽umin(t) + ϵ,
umax(t) −ϵ ⩽u1(t) ⩽umax(t).
In case u∗∈[umin(t0),u1(t0)] we deﬁne
α2(t) = max

umin(t),u1(t) −ϵ/2

,
β2(t) = min

u1(t),umin(t) + ϵ/2

and obtain from Theorem 1.2 a solution u2 such that on [a,b]
umin(t) ⩽u2(t) ⩽umin(t) + ϵ/2,
u1(t) −ϵ/2 ⩽u2(t) ⩽u1(t).
If u∗∈]u1(t0),umax(t0)], we proceed in a similar way. This deﬁnes a sequence of solutions
(uk)k that satisﬁes |uk(t0) −u∗| ⩽ϵ/2k−1. Next, from Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, there is a

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
79
subsequence (ukn)n such that, for some u ∈C([a,b]), ukn converges to u in C([a,b]). It
follows then that u is a solution of (1.1). Further, we have u(t0) = limn→∞ukn(t0) = u∗. □
Existence of a continuum of solutions depends strongly on the nondecreasingness of f .
Such a continuum does not exist in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1.5. Consider the problem
u′′ = u3 −u2,
u(0) = u(T ), u′(0) = u′(T ).
Notice ﬁrst that α(t) = −2 and β(t) = 2 are lower and upper solutions. Also, it is straight-
forward from a phase plane analysis that this problem has only two solutions, u1 = 0 and
u2 = 1, which are between α and β.
Notice also that solutions between lower and upper solutions are not necessarily ordered
as shown in the example that follows.
EXAMPLE 1.6. The piecewise linear problem
u′′ = minu + 2,max−u,u −2,
u(0) = u(2π), u′(0) = u′(2π),
is such that u1(t) = sin t and u2(t) = −sint are nonordered solutions which lie between
the lower solution α(t) = −3 and the upper one β(t) = 3. In this problem, it follows from
the phase plane analysis that the minimal and maximal solutions are respectively umin(t) =
−2 and umax(t) = 2.
1.2. A priori bounds on the derivatives
Consider the problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(1.7)
Here the Nemitskii operator reads N(u) := f (·,u,u′) and therefore the ﬁxed point prob-
lem associated to (1.7) is deﬁned now on C1([a,b]). Lower and upper solutions will give
a priori bounds on u. In order to apply the Schauder Fixed Point theorem or degree theory
we shall also need a priori bounds on the derivative u′. In some cases, the special structure
of the nonlinearity f gives this information. In others, this follows from a Nagumo con-
dition. The following example shows that in any case some condition is necessary since
the existence of solutions does not follow from the existence of ordered lower and upper
solutions.

C. De Coster and P. Habets
EXAMPLE 1.7. Consider the problem
u′′ =

1 + u′22
u −p(t)

,
u(0) = u(T ), u′(0) = u′(T ),
(1.8)
where p is a continuous function such that p(t) = 2 on [0,T/3[, p(t) ∈[−2,2] on
[T/3,2T/3[ and p(t) = −2 on [2T/3,T ]. For such a problem we deﬁne lower and up-
per solutions from Deﬁnitions 1.2 below. It follows that α = −3 is a lower solution and
β = 3 an upper one. However, it can be proved using elementary methods that if T > 0 is
large enough, (1.8) has no solution (see [33,50]).
To illustrate how a priori bounds on the derivative can follow from the structure of the
equation, consider the periodic problem for a Rayleigh equation
u′′ + g(u′) + h(t,u) = 0,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(1.9)
PROPOSITION 1.5. Let h:[a,b] × [−r,r] →R be a Carathéodory function such that for
some h0 ∈L2(a,b), for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ∈[−r,r], we have |h(t,u)| ⩽h0(t). Then
there exists R > 0 such that for every function g ∈C(R), any solution u of (1.9) with
∥u∥∞⩽r satisﬁes ∥u′∥∞< R.
PROOF. Deﬁne R :=
√
b −a ∥h0∥L2 + 1 > 0. Let then g ∈C(R) be given and u be a
solution of (1.9) with ∥u∥∞⩽r. Multiplying (1.9) by u′′ and integrating we obtain

Now it is easy to see that for some t0 ∈[a,b], u′(t0) = 0 so that for all t ∈[a,b]

□
In case the equation does not have any special structure, a priori bounds on the derivative
can still be obtained for nonlinearities which do not grow too quickly with respect to the
derivative. For continuous functions, Nagumo conditions describe such a control. A typical
result is the following.
PROPOSITION 1.6. Let E ⊂[a,b] × [−r,r] × R and let ¯ϕ :R+ →R+
0 be a continuous
function that satisﬁes

¯ϕ(s) = +∞.

and every solution u of
u′′ = f (t,u,u′)
(1.12)
such that ∥u∥∞⩽r, we have ∥u′∥∞< R.
REMARK. A function f :E →R is said to satisfy a Nagumo condition if (1.11) holds.
PROOF. Deﬁne R > 0 to be such that
 R

¯ϕ(s) > 2r
(1.13)
and let u be a solution of (1.12) such that (t,u(t),u′(t)) ∈E on [a,b]. Observe that there
exists τ ∈[a,b] with |u′(τ)| ⩽2r/(b −a). Assume now there exists an interval I = [t0,t1]
(or [t1,t0]) such that u′(t0) = 2r/(b −a), u′(t1) = R and u′(t) ∈[2r/(b −a),R] on I. We
have then

¯ϕ(u′(t))

⩽


u(t1) −u(t0)


 ⩽2r,
which contradicts (1.13).
In the same way, we prove that, for any t ∈[a,b], u′(t) > −R and the result follows. □
REMARKS. In the above proof we do not use the divergence of the integral in (1.10) but
rather the fact that for some R > 0,
 R
2r

s ds
¯ϕ(s) > 2r.
In case ϕ(s) = 1 + sp, condition (1.10) implies that p ⩽2. However this condition still
holds if ϕ(s) = s2 ln(s2 + 1) + 1.
A fundamental generalization of this result concerns one-sided Nagumo conditions. This
applies to problems where some a priori bound on the derivative of solutions is known at
the points a and b. For the periodic problem we can extend the solution by periodicity and
consider an interval [¯a, ¯a + b −a] so that u′(¯a) = u′(¯a + b −a) = 0.
PROPOSITION 1.7. Let E ⊂[¯a, ¯b] × [−r,r] × R, k ⩾0 and let ¯ϕ :R+ →R+
0 be a contin-
uous function that satisﬁes (1.10). Then there exists R > 0 such that for every continuous

we have ∥u′∥∞< R.
PROOF. The proof follows the argument of the proof of Proposition 1.6.
□
REMARK. Condition (1.14) is called a one-sided Nagumo condition.
The above result still holds for other such conditions. We can consider any of the fol-
lowing:
(a) f (t,u,v) ⩾−¯ϕ(|v|) for all (t,u,v) ∈E, u′(¯a) ⩾−k and u′(¯b) ⩽k;
(b) sgn(v)f (t,u,v) ⩽¯ϕ(|v|) for all (t,u,v) ∈E and |u′(¯a)| ⩽k;
(c) sgn(v)f (t,u,v) ⩾−¯ϕ(|v|) for all (t,u,v) ∈E and |u′(¯b)| ⩽k.
Such assumptions apply for problems of the type
u′′ ± (2 + sin t)(u′)m + h(t,u) = 0,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
with m ⩾0.
The Nagumo condition implies the function f at hand is L∞-Carathéodory. Hence this
condition has to be extended so as to deal with Lp-Carathéodory functions which are not
L∞-Carathéodory.
PROPOSITION 1.8. Let E ⊂[a,b] × [−r,r] × R, p, q ∈[1,∞] with 1

proof of Proposition 1.6, t0 < t1 (or t0 > t1) such that u′(t0) = 2r/(b −a), u′(t1) = R and

Assumption (1.16) is a Nagumo condition. Similar one-sided conditions can also be
worked out for the Carathéodory case.

THEOREM 1.10. Let α, β ∈C([a,b]) be lower and upper solutions of the problem (1.9)
such that α ⩽β. Let E be deﬁned by (1.2), g ∈C(R) and let h:E →R be an L2-
Carathéodory function. Then problem (1.9) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,2(a,b) such
that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).

Claim 1. Deﬁne ρ = max{∥α∥∞,∥β∥∞} + 1. Then every solution u of (1.18) satisﬁes

where G(t,s) is the Green’s function of
u′′ −C(t)u = f (t),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
Observe that there exists R0 > 0 such that T0(C1([a,b])) ⊂B(0,R0). Hence,
deg

I −T0,B(0,R0)

= 1
and by the properties of the degree, we prove easily that (1.18) with λ = 1 has a solution.
Claim 4. The solution u of (1.18) with λ = 1 is such that α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t) on [a,b].
Extend α and u by periodicity. Let t0 ∈[a,b[ be such that
u(t0) −α(t0) = min
t

u(t) −α(t)

< 0.
From the deﬁnition of lower solution there exists an open interval I0 such that t0 ∈I0,

which follows as g(α′(s)) −g(u′(s)) is small and C(s)(α(s) −u(s)) > α(s) −u(s) ⩾k
for some k > 0. This contradicts the minimality of u −α at t0.
In a similar way we prove that u ⩽β. Hence u is also a solution of (1.18).
□
A similar result is easy to work out for the general problem (1.7) in case a one-sided
Nagumo condition is satisﬁed. Here we work the case of a continuous function f . The key
of the proof of this generalization is to use an appropriate modiﬁed problem.
THEOREM 1.11. Let α, β ∈C([a,b]) be lower and upper solutions of the problem (1.7)
such that α ⩽β. Let
E =

(t,u,v) ∈[a,b] × R2 | α(t) ⩽u ⩽β(t)

,
(1.19)
ϕ :R+ →R be a positive continuous function satisfying (1.10) and f :E →R a continu-
ous function which satisﬁes the one-sided Nagumo condition (1.14) (with ¯ϕ = ϕ). Then the
problem (1.7) has at least one solution u ∈C2([a,b]) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).

C. De Coster and P. Habets
PROOF. Consider the modiﬁed problem
u′′ = λf t,γ (t,u),u′ + ϕ|u′|u −λγ (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(1.20)
where γ (t,u) is deﬁned by (1.4). Choose r > 0 such that

Claim 1. Every solution u of (1.20) with λ ∈[0,1] is such that −r < u(t) < r. Assume
there exists t0 such that u(t0) = mint u(t) ⩽−r. This leads to a contradiction since then
0 ⩽u′′(t0) = λf t0,α(t0),0 + ϕ(0)u(t0) −α(t0) + (1 −λ)ϕ(0)u(t0) < 0.
Similarly, we prove that u(t) < r.
Claim 2. There exists R > 0 such that every solution u of (1.20) with λ ∈[0,1] satisﬁes
∥u′∥∞< R. The claim follows choosing R > 0 from Proposition 1.7, where ¯ϕ(v) = (1 +
2r)ϕ(v), k = 0 and ¯a is such that u′(¯a) = u′(¯a + b −a) = 0.
Claim 3. Existence of solutions of (1.20) for λ = 1. Let us deﬁne the operators

where Dom L = {u ∈C2([a,b]) | u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b)}. Observe that L has a com-
pact inverse. Hence, we can deﬁne the completely continuous operator
Tλ(u) = L−1Nλ(u).
From degree theory, we have that
deg(T0,Ω) = deg(T1,Ω),
where
Ω =

u ∈C1([a,b]) | ∥u∥∞< r, ∥u′∥∞< R

.
Using the Odd Mapping theorem (see [69]), we compute that
deg(T0,Ω) ̸= 0
and the problem (1.20) with λ = 1 has a solution u.

87
Claim 4. The solution u of (1.20) with λ = 1 is such that α ⩽u ⩽β. This claim fol-
lows as the corresponding argument in the proof of Theorem 1.10. As a consequence, u
satisﬁes (1.7).
□
The following theorem considers the case of Lp-Carathéodory nonlinearities.
THEOREM 1.12. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be lower and upper solutions of (1.7) such
that α ⩽β. Deﬁne A ⊂[a,b] (respectively B ⊂[a,b]) to be the set of points where α
(respectively β) is differentiable. Let p, q ∈[1,∞] with 1
p + 1
q = 1, ψ ∈Lp(a,b) and
ϕ ∈C(R+,R+
0 ) be such that (1.15) holds (with ¯ϕ = ϕ). Let E be deﬁned from (1.19) and
suppose f :E →R is an Lp-Carathéodory function that satisﬁes the one-sided Nagumo
condition (1.17) (with ¯ϕ = ϕ and ¯ψ = ψ). Assume there exists N ∈L1(a,b), N > 0, such
that for a.e. t ∈A (respectively for a.e. t ∈B)


⩾−N(t)

respectively f

(1.21)
Then the problem (1.7) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,p(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).
PROOF. The proof proceeds in several steps.

where γ is deﬁned from (1.4), χA and χB are the characteristic functions of the sets A
and B. It is clear that ωi are L1-Carathéodory functions, nondecreasing in δ, such that
ωi(t,0) = 0 and |ωi(t,δ)| ⩽2N(t).
We consider now the modiﬁed problem
u′′ −u = ¯f (t,u,u′) −ω(t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(1.22)

C. De Coster and P. Habets
Step 2. Existence of a solution of (1.22). This claim follows from Schauder’s theorem.
Step 3. The solution u of (1.22) is such that α ⩽u ⩽β. Let us assume on the contrary
that for some t0 ∈R
min
t

u(t) −α(t)

= u(t0) −α(t0) < 0.
Then, as in Theorem 1.1, there exists an open interval I0 with t0 ∈I0, α ∈W 2,1(I0) and,
for a.e. t ∈I0
α′′(t) ⩾f

t,α(t),α′(t)

.
Further u′(t0) −α′(t0) = 0 and for t ⩾t0 near enough t0


u′(t) −α′(t)


 ⩽α(t) −u(t).
As ω1 is nondecreasing and ¯f (t,α(t),α′(t)) ⩽f (t,α(t),α′(t)),
u′(t) −α′(t) =

ds < 0.
This proves u(t0) −α(t0) is not a minimum of u −α which is a contradiction.
A similar argument holds to prove u ⩽β.
Step 4. The solution u of (1.22) is such that ∥u′∥∞< R. Observe that, for all
(t,u,v) ∈E,

From Proposition 1.9, every solution u ∈[α,β] of (1.22) satisﬁes
∥u′∥∞< R.
Hence |f (t,u(t),u′(t))| ⩽N(t) and the function u is a solution of (1.7).
□
REMARK. Notice that the condition (1.21) is satisﬁed in case f does not depend on u′ or
if α, β ∈W 1,∞(a,b).
EXAMPLE 1.8. Existence of a solution to problem

u(0) = u(1), u′(0) = u′(1),

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
89
where 1 ⩽a < 3/2, follows from Theorem 1.12. Notice that here Theorem 1.11 does not
apply.
1.4. Derivative dependent Dirichlet problem
Dirichlet boundary value problems
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(1.23)
can be studied in a similar way. To this end, we adapt accordingly the deﬁnitions of lower
and upper solutions.
DEFINITIONS 1.3. A function α ∈C([a,b]) is a lower solution of (1.23) if
(a) for any t0 ∈]a,b[, either D−α(t0) < D+α(t0), or there exists an open interval I0 ⊂
]a,b[ such that t0 ∈I0, α ∈W 2,1(I0) and, for a.e. t ∈I0,
α′′(t) ⩾f

t,α(t),α′(t)

;
(b) α(a) ⩽0, α(b) ⩽0.
A function β ∈C([a,b]) is an upper solution of (1.23) if
(a) for any t0 ∈]a,b[, either D−β(t0) > D+β(t0), or there exists an open interval I0 ⊂
]a,b[ such that t0 ∈I0, β ∈W 2,1(I0) and, for a.e. t ∈I0,
β′′(t) ⩽f

t,β(t),β′(t)

;
(b) β(a) ⩾0, β(b) ⩾0.
A typical result is then the following.
THEOREM 1.13. Assume α and β ∈C([a,b]) are lower and upper solutions of prob-
lem (1.23) such that α ⩽β. Deﬁne A ⊂[a,b] (respectively B ⊂[a,b]) to be the set
of points where α (respectively β) is derivable. Let p, q ∈[1,∞] with
1
p + 1
q = 1,
ϕ ∈C(R+,R+
0 ) and ψ ∈Lp(a,b) be such that (1.15) holds (with ¯ϕ = ϕ). Let E be de-
ﬁned in (1.19) and suppose f :E →R is an Lp-Carathéodory function that satisﬁes the
Nagumo condition (1.16) (with ¯ϕ = ϕ and ¯ψ = ψ). Assume there exists N ∈L1(a,b),
N > 0 such that, for a.e. t ∈A (respectively for a.e. t ∈B),
f

t,α(t),α′(t)

⩾−N(t)

respectively f

t,β(t),β′(t)

⩽N(t)

.
Then the problem (1.23) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,p(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).

C. De Coster and P. Habets
PROOF. The proof of this result follows the lines of the proof of Theorem 1.12 and is left
to the reader as an exercise.
□
Notice that a similar result using one-sided Nagumo conditions can be worked out pro-
vided some a priori bound on the derivative of solutions is known at the points a and b
(see Proposition 1.7). These a priori bounds are valid, for example, in case the lower or the
upper solution satisﬁes the boundary conditions.
1.5. A derivative independent Dirichlet problem
Dirichlet boundary value problems
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(1.24)
can be studied for more general nonlinearities than L1-Carathéodory functions. For exam-
ple, the problem
t(1 −t)u′′ = 1,
u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0,
has the solution u(t) = t lnt +(1 −t)ln(1 −t) which is in C0([0,1])∩W 2,1
loc (]0,1[) but not
even in C1([0,1]). This generalizes to the linear problem
u′′ = h(t),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.
(1.25)
In case
h ∈A := h | (s −a)(b −s)h(s) ∈L1(a,b),
problem (1.25) has one and only one solution in
W 2,A(a,b) :=

which reads

where G(t,s) is the corresponding Green’s function. Further, we have

b −a ∥h∥A,
where ∥h∥A =
 b

h(s)


ds (see [53,33]).
In order to deal with nonlinear problems, we consider A-Carathéodory functions
f :E ⊂[a,b] × R →R. These are Carathéodory functions such that for any r > 0

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
91
there exists h ∈A so that for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ∈R with (t,u) ∈E and |u| ⩽r,
|f (t,u)| ⩽h(t).
Notice that if g :R →R is continuous, the function
f (t,u) =
g(u)
t(1 −t)
is an A-Carathéodory function. Observe also that L1(a,b) ⊂A, so that this deﬁnition
generalizes the classical L1-Carathéodory conditions on f .
We can now state the main result for (1.24).
THEOREM 1.14. Assume that α and β are lower and upper solutions of (1.24) such that
α ⩽β. Let E be deﬁned from (1.2) and f :E →R be an A-Carathéodory function. Then
the problem (1.24) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,A(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).
PROOF. We consider the modiﬁed problem
u′′ −u = f

t,γ (t,u)

−γ (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(1.26)
where γ is deﬁned by (1.4).
Claim 1. The problem (1.26) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,A(a,b). Deﬁne the oper-
ator T :C([a,b]) →C([a,b]) given by
(T u)(t) =

where G(t,s) is the Green’s function associated with
u′′ −u = f (t),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.
We can prove that T is completely continuous and bounded (see [53,33]). Hence by
Schauder Fixed Point theorem, T has a ﬁxed point u which is a solution of (1.26)
in W 2,A(a,b).
Claim 2. Any solution u of (1.26) satisﬁes α ⩽u ⩽β. Observe ﬁrst that α(a) ⩽u(a) ⩽
β(a) and α(b) ⩽u(b) ⩽β(b). Next, we argue as in Theorem 1.1 to obtain the result.
Conclusion. From Claim 2, the function u, solution of (1.26), solves (1.24).

EXAMPLE 1.9. Consider the boundary value problem
u′′ + |u|1/2 −1
t = 0,
u(0) = 0, u(π) = 0.
It is easy to see that β(t) = 0 is an upper solution and α(t) = t ln t
π −t is a lower solution.
Hence we have a solution u such that for all t ∈[0,π]
t ln t
π −t ⩽u(t) ⩽0.
Notice that, in this example, the function f (t,u) is not L1-Carathéodory.
If we want more regularity, we need more restrictive conditions on f . For example, we
have the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.15. Assume that α and β are lower and upper solutions of (1.24) such that
α ⩽β. Let E be deﬁned from (1.2) and let f :E →R satisfy a Carathéodory condition.
Assume that there exists a measurable function h such that
 b
a (s −a)h(s)ds < ∞and for
a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ∈R with (t,u) ∈E,


f (t,u)


 ⩽h(t).
Then the problem (1.24) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,A(a,b)∩C1(]a,b]) such that for
all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽β(t).
PROOF. Existence of a solution u ∈W 2,A(a,b) follows from Theorem 1.14. Further
u(t) =
 b
a
G(t,s)f s,u(s) ds,
where G(t,s) is the Green’s function corresponding to (1.25). It is now standard to see that
u ∈C1(]a,b]).
□
1.6. Historical and bibliographical notes
The method of lower and upper solutions applied to boundary value problems is due to
Scorza Dragoni in 1931. In a ﬁrst paper [94], this author considers the boundary value
problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = A, u(b) = B,

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
93
where f is bounded for u in bounded sets. The basic assumption is the existence of func-
tions α, β ∈C2([a,b]) such that
α′′ = f (t,α,α′),
α(a) ⩽A, α(b) ⩽B,
β′′ = f (t,β,β′),
β(a) ⩾A, β(b) ⩾B.
The same year [95], he improves his result assuming that the functions α and β satisfy
differential inequalities. In these papers, the method of proof already uses an auxiliary
problem, modiﬁed for u /∈[α(t),β(t)], whose solution is proved, from a maximum princi-
ple type argument, to be such that α ⩽u ⩽β. The basic ideas are already set.
The introduction of angles in lower and upper solutions has been used by Picard [80]
in 1893. This idea was rediscovered by Nagumo [74] in 1954 who worked with maximum
of lower solutions. A ﬁrst order condition, similar to D−α(t0) < D+α(t0), was used by
Knobloch [64] in 1963.
In 1938, Scorza Dragoni [96,97] already considers L1-Carathéodory functions f . Such
an assumption is also made by Epheser [40] in 1955. More recently, we can quote Jack-
son [58], Kiguradze [62] (see also [63]), Gudkov and Lepin [46], Habets and Laloy [47],
Hess [55] (see also Stampacchia [99]), Fabry and Habets [41], Adje [1], Habets and
Sanchez [51], De Coster and Habets [31,32]. These papers present a variety of deﬁnitions
of lower and upper solutions which are strongly related and there is no obvious reason to
choose one rather than the other. Our choice, Deﬁnitions 1.1 and 1.2 (see [29,31,32]), tends
to be general enough for applications and simple enough to model the geometric intuition
built into the concept.
Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are variants of the basic results of the theory. This last result can
be found in [35] for the parabolic problem.
Theorem 1.3 deals with extremal solutions. Existence of extremal solutions for the
Cauchy problem associated with ﬁrst order ODEs were already studied by Peano [77]
in 1885 and Perron [78] in 1915. Using a monotonicity assumption, Sat¯o [89] worked
in 1954 elliptic PDEs in relation with lower and upper solutions. The monotonicity as-
sumption was deleted in 1960 for parabolic problems by Mlak [71] and in 1961 for elliptic
PDEs by Akô [2]. The proof used here is inspired by the recent paper of Angel Cid [22].
For a classical proof, we refer to Akô [2] or Schmitt [92] in case of C2-solutions. Such
proofs use maxima of lower solutions and minima of upper ones as in Theorem 1.2.
As far as the structure of the solution set is concerned, i.e., Theorem 1.4, we refer to [90]
and [2].
A priori bounds on the derivative of solutions were already worked out by Bernstein [11]
in 1904. Nagumo [73], in 1937, generalized these ideas introducing the so-called Nagumo
condition which is both simple and very general. This is why it has been widely used since
then. Basically, it is our Proposition 1.6. In 1967, Kiguradze [61] (see also Epheser [40]
in 1955) observed that, for some boundary value problems, the Nagumo condition can be
restricted to be one-sided conditions. Proposition 1.7 introduced such a condition. In the
same paper, Kiguradze extended the Nagumo condition so as to deal with W 2,1-solutions as
we did in Propositions 1.8 and 1.9. It seems that we have to wait for Knobloch [64] in 1963
to consider the periodic problem. In 1954, Nagumo [74] pointed out that the existence of
well ordered lower and upper solutions is not sufﬁcient to ensure existence of solutions of

94
C. De Coster and P. Habets
a Dirichlet problem. Example 1.5 presented here for the periodic problem is adapted from
Habets and Pouso [50].
Theorem 1.10 extends a result of Habets and Torres [52] avoiding the assumption α,
β ∈W 1,∞(a,b). Theorem 1.11 is due to Mawhin [70] and Theorem 1.12 is the counterpart
for the periodic problem of a result of De Coster [28].
Rosenblatt [88] already noticed in 1933 that Dirichlet problems can be studied for more
singular nonlinearities than Lp-Carathéodory functions. In 1953, Prodi [86] used lower
and upper solutions for such singular problems. Theorems 1.14 and 1.15 follow Habets
and Zanolin [53] and [54], where the Dirichlet boundary value problem is investigated
with another deﬁnition of lower and upper solutions.
2. Relation with degree theory
2.1. The periodic problem
In order to use degree theory, we need to reinforce the notion of lower and upper solution.
DEFINITIONS 2.1. A lower solution α of
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(2.1)
is said to be a strict lower solution if every solution u of (2.1) with u ⩾α is such that
u(t) > α(t) on [a,b].
Similarly, an upper solution β of (2.1) is said to be a strict upper solution if every
solution u of (2.1) with u ⩽β is such that u(t) < β(t) on [a,b].
The classical way to obtain lower and upper solutions in the case of a continuous func-
tion f is described in the following propositions.
PROPOSITION 2.1. Let f :[a,b]×R2 →R be continuous and α ∈C2([a,b]) be such that
(a) for all t ∈[a,b], α′′(t) > f (t,α(t),α′(t));
(b) α(a) = α(b), α′(a) ⩾α′(b).
Then α is a strict lower solution of (2.1).
PROOF. Let u be a solution of (2.1) such that u ⩾α and assume, by contradiction, that
min
t
u(t) −α(t) = u(t0) −α(t0) = 0.
We have u′(t0) −α′(t0) = 0; in case t0 = a or b, this follows from assumption (b). Hence,
we obtain the contradiction
0 ⩽u′′(t0) −α′′(t0) = f t0,α(t0),α′(t0) −α′′(t0) < 0.
□
Using the same argument we obtain the corresponding result for upper solutions.

PROPOSITION 2.2. Let f :[a,b]×R2 →R be continuous and β ∈C2([a,b]) be such that
(a) for all t ∈[a,b], β′′(t) < f (t,β(t),β′(t));
(b) β(a) = β(b), β′(a) ⩽β′(b).
Then β is a strict upper solution of (2.1).
If f is not continuous but L1-Carathéodory, these last results do not hold anymore. Even
the stronger condition
for a.e. t ∈[a,b],
α′′(t) ⩾f

t,α(t),α′(t)

+ 1
does not prevent solutions u of (2.1) to be tangent to the curve u = α(t) from above. This
is, for example, the case for the bounded function
f (t,u) :=
⎧
⎨
⎩
−1,
u ⩽−1,
−u2+sint
1+sint ,
−1 < u ⩽sint,
−sint,
sint < u,
if we consider α(t) ≡−1, u(t) ≡sint, a = 0 and b = 2π. This remark motivates the
following proposition.
PROPOSITION 2.3. Let f :[a,b] × R2 →R be an L1-Carathéodory function. Let α ∈
C([a,b]) be such that α(a) = α(b) and consider its periodic extension on R. Assume that
α is not a solution of (2.1) and for any t0 ∈R, either
(a) D−α(t0) < D+α(t0) or
(b) there exist an open interval I0 and an ϵ0 > 0 such that t0 ∈I0, α ∈W 2,1(I0) and for
a.e. t ∈I0, all u ∈[α(t),α(t) + ϵ0] and all v ∈[α′(t) −ϵ0,α′(t) + ϵ0],
α′′(t) ⩾f (t,u,v).
Then α is a strict lower solution of (2.1).
PROOF. The function α is a lower solution since clearly it satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1.2. Let u
be a solution of (2.1) such that u ⩾α. As α is not a solution, there exists t∗such that
u(t∗) > α(t∗). Extend u and α by periodicity and assume, by contradiction, that
t0 = inf

t > t∗| u(t) = α(t)

exists. As α −u is maximum at t0, we have D−α(t0) −u′(t0) ⩾D+α(t0) −u′(t0). Hence,
assumption (b) applies. This implies that α′(t0) −u′(t0) = 0 and there exist I0 and ϵ0 > 0
according to (b). It follows we can choose t1 ∈I0 with t1 < t0 such that α′(t1) −u′(t1) > 0
and for every t ∈]t1,t0[
u(t) ⩽α(t) + ϵ0,


α′(t) −u′(t)


 < ϵ0.

C. De Coster and P. Habets
Hence, for almost every t ∈]t1,t0[, we can write
α′′(t) ⩾f t,u(t),u′(t),
which leads to the contradiction

 t0

α′′(t) −f t,u(t),u′(t)dt ⩾0.
□
In the same way we can prove the following result on strict upper solutions.
PROPOSITION 2.4. Let f :[a,b] × R2 →R be an L1-Carathéodory function. Let β ∈
C([a,b]) be such that β(a) = β(b) and consider its periodic extension on R. Assume that
β is not a solution of (2.1) and for any t0 ∈R, either
(a) D−β(t0) > D+β(t0) or
(b) there exist an open interval I0 and an ϵ0 > 0 such that t0 ∈I0, β ∈W 2,1(I0) and for
a.e. t ∈I0, all u ∈[β(t) −ϵ0,β(t)] and all v ∈[β′(t) −ϵ0,β′(t) + ϵ0],
β′′(t) ⩽f (t,u,v).
Then β is a strict upper solution of (2.1).
REMARK. Notice that Propositions 2.3 and 2.4 apply with nonstrict inequalities α′′(t) ⩾
f (t,α(t),α′(t)) and β′′(t) ⩽f (t,β(t),β′(t)). Hence, even if f is continuous, these propo-
sitions generalize Propositions 2.1 and 2.2.
The relation between degree theory and lower and upper solutions is described in the
following result which completes Theorem 1.12.
THEOREM 2.5. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be strict lower and upper solutions of (2.1) such
that α ⩽β. Deﬁne A ⊂[a,b] (respectively B ⊂[a,b]) to be the set of points where α
(respectively β) is differentiable. Let p, q ∈[1,∞] with 1
p + 1
q = 1, ψ ∈Lp(a,b) and
ϕ ∈C(R+,R+
0 ) be such that (1.15) holds (with ¯ϕ = ϕ). Let E be deﬁned from (1.19) and
suppose f :E →R is an Lp-Carathéodory function that satisﬁes the one-sided Nagumo
condition (1.17) (with ¯ϕ = ϕ and ¯ψ = ψ). Assume there exists N ∈L1(a,b), N > 0, such
that for a.e. t ∈A (respectively for a.e. t ∈B) (1.21) is satisﬁed. Then

W 2,p(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b]
α(t) < u(t) < β(t).
PROOF. Deﬁne R > 0 as in the proof of Theorem 1.12 and consider the modiﬁed prob-
lem (1.22). This problem is equivalent to the ﬁxed point problem
u = T u,
where T :C1([a,b]) →C1([a,b]) is deﬁned by

Observe that T is completely continuous. Further there exists 
R large enough so that Ω ⊂
B(0, 

R ). Hence we have, by the properties of the degree,
deg

I −T ,B(0, 
R )

= 1.
We know that every ﬁxed point of T is a solution of (1.22). Arguing as in the proof of
Theorem 1.12, we see that α ⩽u ⩽β and ∥u′∥∞< R. As α and β are strict, α < u < β.
Hence, every ﬁxed point of T is in Ω and by the excision property we obtain
deg(I −T,Ω) = deg(I −T ,Ω) = deg

I −T ,B(0, 
R )

= 1.
Existence of a solution u such that for all t ∈[a,b],
α(t) < u(t) < β(t)
follows now from the properties of the degree.
□
In case we consider a derivative independent problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(2.5)
we can simplify this theorem deﬁning T on C([a,b]) rather than on C1([a,b]).
THEOREM 2.6. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be strict lower and upper solutions of (2.5) such
that α ⩽β. Let E be deﬁned from (1.2) and suppose f :E →R is an L1-Carathéodory
function. Then

In particular, the problem (2.5) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,1(a,b) such that for all
t ∈[a,b]
α(t) < u(t) < β(t).
The proof of this theorem repeats the argument used in the proof of Theorem 2.5.
These theorems can be used to obtain multiplicity results. We present here such a the-
orem where, for simplicity, we assume the nonlinearity not to depend on the derivative.
Such a restriction is by no means essential.
THEOREM 2.7 (The Three Solutions theorem). Let α1, β1 and α2, β2 ∈C([a,b]) be two
pairs of lower and upper solutions of (2.5) such that for all t ∈[a,b],
α1(t) ⩽β1(t),
α2(t) ⩽β2(t),
α1(t) ⩽β2(t)
and for some t0 ∈[a,b],
α2(t0) > β1(t0).
Assume further β1 and α2 are strict upper and lower solutions. Let E be deﬁned
from (1.2) (with α = min{α1,α2} and β = max{β1,β2}) and suppose f :E →R is an L1-
Carathéodory function. Then, the problem (2.5) has at least three solutions u1,u2,u3 ∈
W 2,1(a,b) such that for all t ∈[a,b],
α1(t) ⩽u1(t) < β1(t),
α2(t) < u2(t) ⩽β2(t),
u1(t) ⩽u3(t) ⩽u2(t)
and for some t1, t2 ∈[a,b],
u3(t1) > β1(t1),
u3(t2) < α2(t2).

For any λ ∈[0,1], we consider then the homotopy Tλ = λT + (1 −λ)T .
Claim 1. If λ ∈[0,1] and u is a ﬁxed point of Tλ, we have u ⩾α1. This follows from the
usual maximum principle argument as in Claim 2 of the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Claim 2. If λ ∈[0,1] and u is a ﬁxed point of Tλ, we have u ⩽β2. Notice that u solves

u′′(t) −u(t) ⩾f t,β2(t) −β2(t) ⩾β′′
2(t) −β2(t),
i.e.,
u′′(t) −β′′
2(t) ⩾u(t) −β2(t) > 0,
which contradicts the fact that t0 maximizes u −β2.
Claim 3. If λ ∈[0,1] and u ∈
Ω1,1 is a ﬁxed point of Tλ, we have u < β1. Assume there
exists t0 ∈[a,b] such that u(t0) = β1(t0). We deduce from Claims 1 and 2 that α1(t) ⩽
u(t) ⩽β2(t) for all t ∈[a,b] so that u solves (2.5). As further β1 is a strict upper solution,
the claim follows.
Claim 4. deg(I −T,Ω1,1) = 1. Observe that T is completely continuous. Further there
exists R large enough so that Ω1,1 ⊂B(0,R) and T (C1([a,b])) ⊂B(0,R). On the other

hand, we know from the usual maximum principle argument (see the proof of Theorem 1.2)
that ﬁxed points u of T are such that α1 ⩽u ⩽min{β1(t),β2(t)}. Hence we deduce from
Claim 3 that u < β1. Now we can deduce from the properties of the degree,
deg(I −T ,Ω1,1) = deg

I −T ,B(0,R)

and using the above claims
deg(I −T,Ω1,1) = deg(I −Tλ,Ω1,1) = deg(I −T ,Ω1,1) = 1.

α1 −k < ¯u1 < β1,
α2 < ¯u2 < β2 + k,
α1 −k < ¯u3 < β2 + k
and there exist t1, t2 ∈[a,b] with
¯u3(t1) > β1(t1),
¯u3(t2) < α2(t2).

and there exist t1, t2 ∈[a,b], with
u3(t1) > β1(t1),
u3(t2) < α2(t2).
We know that solutions u of (2.6) are such that
α1 ⩽u ⩽β2,
i.e., they are solutions of (2.5). Next, from Theorem 1.3, we know there exist extremal
solutions umin and umax of (2.5) in [α1,β2]. The claim follows then with u1 = umin, u2 =
umax and u3 = ¯u3.
□
Observe that in this theorem u1 ⩽min{β1,β2} and u2 ⩾max{α1,α2}.
EXAMPLE 2.1. Consider the problem
u′′ + sin u = h(t),
u(0) = u(2π), u′(0) = u′(2π).
(2.7)
Let h ∈C([0,2π]) and write ¯h =

and
α1 = −3π

β2 = 3π
2 + w.
Using Theorem 2.7 and the estimate ∥w∥∞⩽π
6 ∥˜h∥L1 (see [44] or [33]) we ﬁnd three
solutions of (2.7)
u1 ∈]α1,β1[,
u2 ∈]α2,β2[
and
u3 ∈]α1,β2[,
with u3(t1) ⩾β1(t1) and u3(t2) ⩽α2(t2) for some t1 and t2 ∈[0,2π]. Notice then that u1
might be u2 −2π but u3 ̸= u1 mod 2π. Hence, this problem has at least two geometrically
different solutions.
2.2. The Dirichlet problem
In this section, we consider the Dirichlet problem

C. De Coster and P. Habets
where f is an Lp-Carathéodory function. To focus on the main ideas and avoid technical
difﬁculties we restrict our analysis to derivative independent nonlinearities. Problem (2.8)
is equivalent to the ﬁxed point problem
u(t) = (T u)(t) :=
 b

G(t,s)f s,u(s)ds,
(2.9)
where G(t,s) is the Green’s function corresponding to (1.25).
In this section, we consider the degree of I −T for an open set Ω of functions u that lie
between the lower and upper solutions α and β. If we allow α and β to satisfy the boundary
conditions, the set
Ω =

u ∈C0

[a,b]

| ∀t ∈]a,b[, α(t) < u(t) < β(t)

,
might not be open in C0([a,b]). A way out is to impose some additional conditions on the
functions u at these boundary points. To this end, for u, v ∈C([a,b]), we write u ≻v or
v ≺u if there exists ϵ > 0 such that for any t ∈[a,b]
u(t) −v(t) ⩾ϵe(t),
where e(t) := sin(π t−a
b−a ). We can then work with the space C1

In our case, this approach does not seem to be simpler and as the solutions are anyhow
in C1
0([a,b]), we choose to work in the more usual space C1
0([a,b]).
DEFINITIONS 2.2. A lower solution α of (2.8) is said to be a strict lower solution if every
solution u of (2.8) with α ⩽u is such that α ≺u.
An upper solution β of (2.8) is said to be a strict upper solution if every solution u
of (2.8) with u ⩽β is such that u ≺β.
A ﬁrst result concerns lower and upper solutions which are C2.
PROPOSITION 2.8. Let f :[a,b] × R →R be continuous and α ∈C([a,b]) ∩C2(]a,b[)
be such that
(a) for all t ∈]a,b[, α′′(t) > f (t,α(t));
(b) for t0 ∈{a,b}, either α(t0) < 0
or α(t0) = 0, α ∈C2(]a,b[ ∪{t0}) and α′′(t0) > f (t0,α(t0)).
Then α is a strict lower solution of (2.8).

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
103
PROOF. From the assumptions, α is a lower solution of (2.8). Let then u be a solution
of (2.8) such that α ⩽u and assume, by contradiction, that for any n ∈N0, there exists
tn ∈[a,b] such that
u(tn) −α(tn) < 1
n sin

π tn −a
b −a

.
(2.11)
It follows there exists a subsequence of (tn)n that converges to a point t0 such that u(t0) =
α(t0). If t0 ∈]a,b[, we have u′(t0) = α′(t0). On the other hand, if t0 = a, we know that
α ∈C2([a,b[) and we deduce from (2.11) that
u(tn) −u(a)
tn −a
⩽
α(tn) + 1
n sin(π tn−a
b−a ) −α(a)
tn −a
.
This implies u′(a) ⩽α′(a). As further u −α is minimum at t = a, we also have
u′(a) ⩾α′(a). Hence, u′(a) = α′(a). A similar reasoning applies if t0 = b so that in
all cases u′(t0) −α′(t0) = 0. Finally, we obtain the contradiction 0 ⩽u′′(t0) −α′′(t0) =
f (t0,α(t0)) −α′′(t0) < 0.
□
In a similar way, we can write
PROPOSITION 2.9. Let f :[a,b] × R →R be continuous and β ∈C([a,b]) ∩C2(]a,b[)
be such that
(a) for all t ∈]a,b[, β′′(t) < f (t,β(t));
(b) for t0 ∈{a,b}, either β(t0) > 0
or β(t0) = 0, β ∈C2(]a,b[∪{t0}) and β′′(t0) < f (t0,β(t0)).
Then β is a strict upper solution of (2.8).
Notice that an upper solution β such that
β′′(t) < f (t,β(t))
on ]a,b[,
β(a) ⩾0,
β(b) ⩾0
is not necessarily strict. Consider for example the problem (2.8) deﬁned on [a,b] = [0,2π]
with
f (t,u) =
0,
if u ⩽0,
7u/t2,
if 0 < u ⩽t3,
7t,
if u > t3.
The function u(t) = 0 is a solution and β(t) = t3 is an upper solution that satisﬁes β′′(t) <
f (t,β(t)) on ]0,2π], β(0) = u(0) and β′(0) = u′(0).
In the Carathéodory case, we can use the following propositions.
PROPOSITION 2.10. Let f :[a,b] × R →R be an L1-Carathéodory function. Assume
that α ∈C([a,b]) is not a solution of (2.8) and that

(a) for any t0 ∈]a,b[, either D−α(t0) < D+α(t0)
or there exist an open interval I0 ⊂[a,b] and ϵ0 > 0 such that t0 ∈I0, α ∈W 2,1(I0)
and for a.e. t ∈I0 and all u ∈[α(t),α(t) + ϵ0 sin(π t−a
b−a )],
α′′(t) ⩾f (t,u);
(b) either α(a) < 0
or α(a) = 0 and there exists ϵ0 > 0 such that α ∈W 2,1(a,a + ϵ0) and for a.e.
t ∈[a,a + ϵ0] and all u ∈[α(t),α(t) + ϵ0 sin(π t−a
b−a)],
α′′(t) ⩾f (t,u);
(c) either α(b) < 0
or α(b) = 0 and there exists ϵ0 > 0 such that α ∈W 2,1(b −ϵ0,b) and for a.e. t ∈
[b −ϵ0,b] and all u ∈[α(t),α(t) + ϵ0 sin(π t−a
b−a )],
α′′(t) ⩾f (t,u).
Then α is a strict lower solution of (2.8).
PROOF. Notice ﬁrst that α satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1.3 and therefore is a lower solution.
Let u be a solution of (2.8) such that u ⩾α. Arguing by contradiction as in Proposi-
tion 2.8 there exists a sequence (tn)n that satisﬁes (2.11) and converges to a point t0 such
that u(t0) = α(t0) and u′(t0) = α′(t0).
As α is not a solution, we can ﬁnd t∗such that u(t∗) > α(t∗). Assume t0 < t∗and deﬁne
t1 = max{t < t∗| u(t) = α(t)}. Notice then that u(t1) = α(t1) and u′(t1) = α′(t1) and ﬁx
ϵ0 > 0 according to the assumptions. Next, for t ⩾t1 near enough t1

which contradicts the deﬁnition of t1. A similar argument holds if t0 > t∗.

Strict upper solutions can be obtained from a similar proposition.

β′′(t) ⩽f (t,u).
Then β is a strict upper solution of (2.8).
We can study cases where f satisﬁes a one-sided Lipschitz condition in u.
PROPOSITION 2.12. Let f :[a,b] × R →R be an L1-Carathéodory function such that,
for some k ∈L1(a,b;R+), for a.e. t ∈[a,b], all u1, u2 ∈R,
u1 ⩽u2 ⇒f (t,u2) −f (t,u1) ⩽k(t)(u2 −u1);
Let α (respectively β) be a lower (respectively upper) solution of (2.8) which is not a
solution and assume
(a) either α(a) < 0 (respectively β(a) > 0)
or α(a) = 0 (respectively β(a) = 0) and there exists an interval I0 = [a,c[ ⊂[a,b]

PROOF. We prove the proposition for a lower solution α.
Let u be a solution of (2.8) such that u ⩾α and assume by contradiction, as in
Proposition 2.8, that for all n ∈N0 there exists tn ∈[a,b] such that (2.11) holds and
that the sequence (tn)n converges to some t∗∈[a,b] which satisﬁes u(t∗) = α(t∗) and
u′(t∗) = α′(t∗). Deﬁne t0 = min{t ∈[a,b] | u(t) = α(t) and u′(t) = α′(t)}. If t0 ̸= a, we
can ﬁnd an interval I0 such that for a.e. t ∈I0

and t1 ∈I0 with t1 < t0. Notice that u(t1) > α(t1). On [t1,t0[ the function w = u −α
veriﬁes

w(t1) > 0, w(t0) = 0, w′(t0) = 0.
Deﬁne then v to be the solution of
v′′ = k(t)v,
v(t1) = 0, v′(t1) = 1.
As v is positive on ]t1,t0[, we have the contradiction

If t0 = a we deﬁne t0 to be the maximum of the points t ∈[a,b] such that for all s ∈
[a,t], u(s) = α(s) and u′(s) = α′(s). As α is not a solution, t0 < b and a similar argument
applies to the right of t0.
□
As in the periodic case, we associate with lower and upper solutions some sets Ω which
are such that if T is deﬁned from (2.9), the degree of I −T on such a set is 1.
THEOREM 2.13. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be strict lower and upper solutions of the
problem (2.8) such that α ≺β. Deﬁne E from (1.2) and assume f :E →R is an L1-
Carathéodory function. Then, for R > 0 large enough,
deg(I −T,Ω) = 1,
where Ω = {u ∈C1
0([a,b]) | α ≺u ≺β, ∥u∥C1 < R} and T :C1
0([a,b]) →C1
0([a,b]) is
deﬁned by (2.9). In particular, the problem (2.8) has at least one solution u ∈W 2,1(a,b)
such that
α ≺u ≺β.

PROOF. We consider the modiﬁed problem


,
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(2.12)
with γ (t,u) deﬁned from (1.4). This problem is equivalent to the ﬁxed point problem
u = T u,
where T :C1

(T u)(t) :=

and G(t,s) is the Green’s function corresponding to (1.25). Notice that T is completely
continuous and for R large enough, T (C1
0([a,b])) ⊂B(0,R). Hence by the properties of
the degree
deg

I −T ,B(0,R)

= 1.
We know that any ﬁxed point u of T is a solution of (2.12). Arguing as in the proof of
Theorem 1.1 we prove that α ⩽u ⩽β and as α and β are strict α ≺u ≺β. Hence, every
ﬁxed point of T is in Ω ⊂B(0,R) and using the excision property we obtain
deg(I −T,Ω) = deg(I −T ,Ω) = 1.
Existence of the solution u follows now from the properties of the degree.
□
It is easy to deal with A-Carathéodory functions if we reinforce the notion of strict lower
and upper solutions imposing that these functions do not satisfy the boundary conditions.
THEOREM 2.14. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be strict lower and upper solutions of the prob-
lem (2.8) such that
α(a) < 0 < β(a),
α(b) < 0 < β(b)
and
∀t ∈]a,b[, α(t) < β(t).
Deﬁne E from (1.2) and assume f :E →R is an A-Carathéodory function. Then,
deg(I −T,Ω) = 1,
where
Ω =

and T :C0([a,b]) →C0([a,b]) is deﬁned by (2.9). In particular, the problem (2.8) has at
least one solution u ∈W 2,A(a,b) such that, for all t ∈[a,b],

108
C. De Coster and P. Habets
α(t) < u(t) < β(t).
The proof of this result is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.13.
2.3. Non well-ordered lower and upper solutions
We already noticed in Example 1.3 that the method of lower and upper solutions depends
strongly on the ordering α ⩽β. On the other hand, lower and upper solutions α, β satis-
fying the reversed ordering condition β ⩽α arise naturally in situations where the corre-
sponding problem has a solution. As a very simple example, we can consider the linear
problem
u′′ + 2
3u = sint,
u(0) = u(2π), u′(0) = u′(2π).
The functions α = 3
2 and β = −3
2 are lower and upper solutions such that α ⩾β. Notice,
however, that the unique solution u(t) = −3 sint does not lie between the lower and the
upper solution. As we shall see, the reason for this example to work is that the “nonlin-
earity” f (t,u) = sint −2
3u “lies” between the two ﬁrst eigenvalues of the problem. As a
ﬁrst approach we consider the following result which concerns a nonresonance problem
using a bounded perturbation of the linear problem at the ﬁrst eigenvalue. To simplify, we
consider a derivative independent problem.
THEOREM 2.15. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be lower and upper solutions of (2.5) such
that α  β. Assume f :[a,b] × R →R is an L1-Carathéodory function and for some
h ∈L1(a,b) either
f (t,u) ⩽h(t)
on [a,b] × R
or
f (t,u) ⩾h(t)
on [a,b] × R.
Then, there exists a solution u of (2.5) in
S := u ∈C[a,b] | ∃t1,t2 ∈[a,b], u(t1) ⩾β(t1), u(t2) ⩽α(t2).

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
109
Claim. There exists k > 0 such that for any r ⩾2(b −a)2, solutions u of (2.14), which
are in S, are such that ∥u∥∞⩽k. Consider the case f (t,u) ⩽h(t) on [a,b] × R. Let
u ∈S be a solution of (2.14) and let t0, t1 and t2 ∈[a,b] be such that
u′(t0) = 0,
u(t1) ⩾β(t1) ⩾−∥β∥∞
and
u(t2) ⩽α(t2) ⩽∥α∥∞.
Extending u by periodicity, we can write for t ∈[t0,t0 +b −a], and therefore for all t ∈R,
u′(t) = −
 t0+b−a

u(t) = u(t1) +

u′(s)ds ⩾−∥β∥∞−∥h∥L1(b −a) −∥u∥∞

Hence, we have
∥u∥∞⩽2

∥α∥∞+ ∥β∥∞+ ∥h∥L1(b −a)

=: k.
A similar argument holds if f (t,u) ⩾h(t).
Conclusion. Consider the problem (2.14), with r > max{k,2(b −a)2}. It is easy to see
that α1 = −r −2 and β2 = r + 2 are lower and upper solutions. Recall that r ⩾∥α∥∞+
∥β∥∞so that α1 < α < β2 and α1 < β < β2.
Assume β is not a strict upper solution. There exists then a solution u of (2.14) such
that u ⩽β and for some t1 ∈[a,b], u(t1) = β(t1). As further α  β, there exists t2 ∈[a,b]
such that α(t2) > β(t2). It follows that α(t2) > u(t2), u ∈S, and we deduce from the claim
that ∥u∥∞⩽k. Hence, u is a solution of (2.5) in S.
We come to the same conclusion if α is not a strict lower solution.
Suppose now that β1 = β and α2 = α are strict upper and lower solutions. We deduce
then from Theorem 2.7 the existence of three solutions of (2.14) one of them, u, being such
that for some t1, t2 ∈[a,b], u(t1) > β(t1) and u(t2) < α(t2). Hence, u ∈S and from the
claim ∥u∥∞< k. This implies that u solves (2.5) and proves the theorem.
□
Such a result can be used if we assume some asymptotic control on the quotient
f (t,u)/u as |u| goes to inﬁnity. We can generalize further assuming different behaviours
as u goes to plus or minus inﬁnity. This is worked out in the following theorem.

110
C. De Coster and P. Habets
THEOREM 2.16. Let α and β ∈C([a,b]) be lower and upper solutions of (2.5) such
that α  β. Let f :[a,b] × R →R be an L1-Carathéodory function such that for some
functions a± ⩽0, b± ⩾0 in L1(a,b),
a±(t) ⩽liminf
u→±∞
f (t,u)
u
⩽limsup
u→±∞
f (t,u)
u
⩽b±(t),
uniformly in t ∈[a,b]. Assume further that for any p, q ∈L1(a,b), with a+ ⩽p ⩽b+ and
a−⩽q ⩽b−, the nontrivial solutions of
u′′ = p(t)u+ −q(t)u−,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(2.15)
where u+(t) = max{u(t),0} and u−(t) = max{−u(t),0}, do not have zeros. Then the prob-
lem (2.5) has at least one solution u ∈S, where S is deﬁned from (2.13).
PROOF. Step 1. Claim. There exists ϵ > 0 so that for any p, q ∈L1(a,b), with a+ −ϵ ⩽
p ⩽b++ϵ and a−−ϵ ⩽q ⩽b−+ϵ, the nontrivial solutions of (2.15) do not have zeros. If
the claim were wrong, there would exist sequences (pn)n, (qn)n ⊂L1(a,b), (tn)n ⊂[a,b]
and (un)n ⊂W 2,1(a,b) so that a+−1/n ⩽pn ⩽b++1/n, a−−1/n ⩽qn ⩽b−+1/n and
un is a solution of (2.15) (with p = pn and q = qn) such that ∥un∥C1 = 1 and un(tn) = 0.
Going to subsequences we can assume, using the Dunford–Pettis theorem (see [12]),
pn ⇀p,
qn ⇀q
in L1(a,b),
un →u
in C1[a,b],
tn →t0.
It follows that a+ ⩽p ⩽b+, a−⩽q ⩽b−, u is a solution of (2.15) and u(t0) = 0, which
contradicts the assumptions.
Step 2. The modiﬁed problem. Let us choose R > 0 large enough so that
a+ −ϵ ⩽g+(t,u) = f (t,u)
u
⩽b+ + ϵ,
for u ⩾R,
a−−ϵ ⩽g−(t,u) = f (t,u)
u
⩽b−+ ϵ,
for u ⩽−R
and extend these functions on [a,b] × R so that these inequalities remain valid. As f is
L1-Carathéodory, there exists ℓ∈L1(a,b) such that
f (t,u) = g+(t,u)u+ −g−(t,u)u−+ h(t,u)
and


h(t,u)


 ⩽ℓ(t).

r (t,u)u−+ hr(t,u) = 0,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(2.16)
Step 3. Claim. There exists k > 0 such that, for any r > k, solutions u of (2.16), which
are in S, are such that ∥u∥∞< k. Assume by contradiction, there exist sequences (rn)n and
(un)n ⊂S, where rn ⩾n and un is a solution of (2.16) (with r = rn) such that ∥un∥∞⩾n.
As un ∈S, there exist sequences (t1n)n and (t2n)n ⊂[a,b] such that un(t1n) ⩾β(t1n)
and un(t2n) ⩽α(t2n).
Consider now the functions vn = un/∥un∥∞which solve the problems

Going to subsequence, we can assume as above

t1n →t1,
t2n →t2.
It follows that v satisﬁes (2.15) and by assumption has no zeros. Hence, we come to a
contradiction since v(t1) ⩾0 and v(t2) ⩽0 which implies v has a zero.
Conclusion, We deduce from Theorem 2.15 that (2.16) with r > max{k, ∥α∥∞,∥β∥∞}
has a solution u ∈S and conclude from Step 3 that u solves (2.5).
□
In the previous theorem we control asymptotically the nonlinearity using the func-
tions a±, b±. Next we impose some admissibility condition on the box [a+,b+]×[a−,b−]
which is to assume that for any functions (p,q) ∈[a+,b+] × [a−,b−], the nontrivial so-
lutions of problem (2.15) do not have zeros. Such a condition implies the nonlinearity
does not interfere with the second eigenvalue λ2 = 4( π
b−a)2 of the periodic problem, i.e.,
(−λ2,−λ2) /∈[a+,b+] × [a−,b−]. This remark can be made up considering the second
curve of the Fuˇcík spectrum. The Fuˇcík spectrum is the set F of points (μ,ν) ∈R2 such
that the problem

u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),

The following proposition relates the admissibility of the box [a+,b+] × [a−,b−] with the
Fuˇcík spectrum.
PROPOSITION 2.17. Let (μ,ν) ∈F2 and p, q ∈L1(a,b). Assume that for some set I ⊂
[a,b] of positive measure
p(t) ⩾−μ,
q(t) ⩾−ν,
for a.e. t ∈[a,b],
p(t) > −μ,
q(t) > −ν,
for a.e. t ∈I.
Then, the nontrivial solutions of problem (2.15) have no zeros.
PROOF. Assume there exists a nontrivial solution u which has a zero. Extend u by pe-
riodicity and let t0 and t1 be consecutive zeros such that u is positive on ]t0,t1[. Deﬁne

0 < −v(t1)u′(t1) ⩽0.
Hence t1 −t0 ⩾
π
√μ and we only have equality in case p(t) = −μ on [t0,t1]. Similarly,
we prove the distance between two consecutive zeros t1 and t2 with u negative on ]t1,t2[
is such that t2 −t1 ⩾π
√ν with equality if and only if q(t) = −ν on [t1,t2]. It follows that
b −a ⩾t2 −t0 ⩾π
√μ + π
√ν = b −a.
This implies t2 −t0 = b −a, p(t) = −μ on [t0,t1] and q(t) = −ν on [t1,t2] which contra-
dicts the assumptions.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
113
Existence of several solutions can be obtained using non-well-ordered lower and upper
solutions. The following result complements Theorem 2.16.
THEOREM 2.18. Let α1 and α2 ∈C([a,b]) be lower solutions of (2.5) and β ∈C([a,b])
be a strict upper solution such that α2  β, α1 ⩽α2 and α1 ⩽β. Assume f :[a,b] × R →

limsup
u→+∞
f (t,u)
u

that
α1 ⩽u1 < β,
u2 ∈S
and
u1 ⩽u2,
where S is deﬁned in (2.13) with α = α2.

Claim 1. Every solution of (2.17) is such that u ⩾α1. This follows from the usual
maximum principle argument as it is used, for example, in the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Claim 2. There exists k > 0 so that for any r > max{∥α1∥∞,∥α2∥∞,∥β∥∞} and any
solution u ∈S of (2.17), we have ∥u∥∞< k. As u ∈S, there exist t0 and t1 such that
u(t0) = min
t∈[a,b]u(t) ⩽u(t1) ⩽α2(t1) ⩽∥α2∥∞.
Further, we deduce from the asymptotic character of f that there exists ˆb+ and h ∈L1(a,b)
such that, for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ⩾α1(t),
fr(t,u) ⩽ˆb+(t)u + h(t).

and the claim follows from Gronwall’s lemma.
Conclusion. Consider the problem (2.17) for
r > max

∥α1∥∞,∥α2∥∞,∥β∥∞,k

,
where k is given in Claim 2.
It follows from Theorem 1.3 that there exists a solution u1 of (2.17) which is minimal in
[α1,β]. Hence, α1(t) ⩽u1(t) ⩽r which implies this solution solves also (2.5).
Next, we can apply Theorem 2.15 to obtain a solution u2 ∈S of (2.17). From Claim 1,
u2 ⩾α1, and from Claim 2, u2 ⩽k < r. Therefore u2 is a solution of (2.5).
Finally, notice that if u2  u1, u1 and u2 are upper solutions of (2.17) and we deduce
from Theorem 1.2 the existence of a solution u3 with α1 ⩽u3 ⩽min{u1,u2} which con-
tradicts u1 to be minimal.
□
REMARK. We can drop the assumption α1 ⩽α2, but this needs additional work as in the
proof of Theorem 1.2.
Dirichlet problem (1.24) can be investigated along the same lines. For example, we
can consider the problem of interaction with Fuˇcík spectrum and write a result similar to
Theorem 2.16.
THEOREM 2.19. Assume α and β ∈C1([a,b]) are lower and upper solutions of (1.24)
such that α  β. Let f :[a,b] × R →R be an L1-Carathéodory function such that for

u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
where u+(t) = max{u(t),0} and u−(t) = max{−u(t),0}, do not have interior zeros. Then

2.4. Historical and bibliographical notes
In 1972, Amann [5] proved a degree result for boundary value problems with strict lower
and upper solutions. He considered the associated ﬁxed point problem u = T u together
with the set Ω of functions u that lie between strict lower and upper solutions and proved

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
115
deg(I −T,Ω) = 1. Until recently, such results were only obtained for continuous nonlin-
earities.
A study of the Carathéodory case for a Dirichlet problem with f independent of u′ can
be found in De Coster [27], De Coster, Grossinho and Habets [29], Habets and Omari [48]
and De Coster and Habets [30]. The derivative dependent case for a Rayleigh equation
is worked out in [52]. Our approach follows these papers. Theorem 2.14 which considers
A-Carathéodory functions can be found in [42].
For the periodic problem we present here the counterpart of similar results for the Dirich-
let problem. Theorem 2.5 extends [87], avoiding the assumption α, β ∈W 1,∞(a,b).
The abstract idea used in the Three Solutions theorem (Theorem 2.7), goes back to
Kolesov [66] in 1970 and Amann [4] in 1971. The ﬁrst one who proved such a result with
degree theory seems to be Amann [5] in 1972 (see also [6]). Extensions were also given
by Shivaji [98] and Bongsoo Ko [65]. Our result, Theorem 2.7, improves all these in the
special case of ODE and extends them to the Carathéodory case. It extends [32] by relaxing
the order relations between αi and βi.
In 1972, Sattinger [91] presented as an open problem the question of existence of a
solution for the problem
−u = f (x,u),
in Ω,
u = 0,
on ∂Ω,
(2.18)
in presence of lower and upper solutions which does not satisfy the ordering relation
α ⩽β. A ﬁrst important contribution to this question was given by Amann, Ambrosetti and
Mancini [8] in 1978. They consider (2.18) assuming the nonlinearity f (x,u) is a bounded
pertubation of λ1u, where λ1 is the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Laplacian. In 1994, Gossez and
Omari [45] assumed some asymptotic control on the nonlinearity so that f (t,u)
u
remains,
within small perturbations, between the two ﬁrst eigenvalues of the linearized problem.
They prove then existence of a solution in presence of a lower and an upper solution with-
out any order relation. More recently, Habets and Omari [48] extended this work providing
a general nonresonance condition with respect to the second curve of the Fuˇcík spectrum
as in Theorems 2.16 and 2.19. They obtain an existence and localization result in presence
of a lower and an upper solution satisfying the reversed order α > β. Such a condition
did not appear in previous works. In [34], this last result was extended by cancelling the
reversed order condition as in Theorem 2.19. In [34] the results were obtained for a general
elliptic problem. The parabolic case can be found in [35] and the results for the periodic
ODE in [36].
3. Variational methods
3.1. The minimization method
Another approach in working with lower and upper solutions is to relate them with varia-
tional methods. Consider for example the problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(3.1)

116
C. De Coster and P. Habets
where f is an L1-Carathéodory function. It is well known that the related functional
φ :H 1

u 
→

t,u(t)

dt,
with F(t,u) =
 u
0 f (t,s)ds, is of class C1 and its critical points are the solutions of (3.1).
A ﬁrst link between the two methods is that existence of a well ordered pair of lower
and upper solutions α and β, implies the functional φ has a minimum on the convex but
noncompact set [α,β]. This minimum solves (3.1).
THEOREM 3.1. Let α and β be lower and upper solutions of (3.1) with α ⩽β on [a,b]
and E be deﬁned from (1.2). Assume f :E →R is an L1-Carathéodory function. Then the
functional φ is minimum on [α,β], i.e., there exists u with α ⩽u ⩽β so that
φ(u) =
min
v∈H 1
0 (a,b)
α⩽v⩽β
φ(v).
Further, u is a solution of (3.1).
PROOF. Consider the modiﬁed problem
u′′ = f

t,γ (t,u)

,
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(3.2)
where γ (t,u) is deﬁned from (1.4), and deﬁne the functional

t,u(t)

dt,
where 
F(t,u) =

ds.
Claim 1. ¯φ has a global minimum u which is a solution of (3.2). It is easy to verify that
¯φ is of class C1 and its critical points are precisely the solutions of (3.2). Moreover ¯φ is
weakly lower semicontinuous and coercive. Hence the claim follows.
Claim 2. α ⩽u ⩽β. Assume mint(u(t) −α(t)) < 0 and deﬁne t0 = max{t ∈[a,b] |
u(t) −α(t) = mins(u(s) −α(s))}. We proceed now as in the proof of Theorem 1.1 and
obtain that for any t ⩾t0, near enough t0,
u′(t) −α′(t) =
 t
t0

u′′(s) −α′′(s)

ds =
 t
t0

f

s,α(s)

−α′′(s)

ds ⩽0.
This contradicts the deﬁnition of t0.
Conclusion. Notice that if u is such that α ⩽u ⩽β, the difference ¯φ(u) −φ(u) is a
constant independent of u. Hence, both functionals are minimized together between α
and β so that the theorem follows from the previous claims.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
117
EXAMPLE 3.1. Consider the problem
u′′ = λf (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(3.3)
where f :[a,b] × R →R is an L1-Carathéodory function such that f (t,0) = 0,
f (t,R) ⩾0 for some R > 0 and there exists μ ∈H 1
0 (a,b), 0 ⩽μ ⩽R that satisﬁes
 b
a F(t,μ(t))dt < 0 with F(t,u) =
 u
0 f (t,s)ds. Then, we can prove the existence of
Λ ⩾0 such that for all λ ⩾Λ, (3.3) has, beside the trivial solution, at least one nontrivial
nonnegative solution.
We just have to observe that α = 0 is a lower solution, β = R is an upper solution and
φ(μ) < 0 for λ large enough. Hence, for such values of λ, there exists u ∈[0,R] which
solves (3.3) and minimizes φ on [0,R], i.e.,
φ(u) =
min
v∈H 1
0 (a,b)
0⩽v⩽R
φ(v) ⩽φ(μ) < 0 = φ(0).
This last inequality implies u ̸≡0.
The method applies to other boundary value problems such as the periodic problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(3.4)
Here, the associated functional reads

with F(t,u) =

per(a,b) = {u ∈H 1(a,b) | u(a) = u(b)}. For this prob-
lem, we can write an equivalent of Theorem 3.1.
THEOREM 3.2. Let α and β be lower and upper solutions of (3.4) with α ⩽β on [a,b]
and E be deﬁned from (1.2). Assume f :E →R is an L1-Carathéodory function. Then the
functional φ deﬁned by (3.5) is minimum on [α,β], i.e., there exists u with α ⩽u ⩽β so
that
φ(u) =
min
v∈H 1
per(a,b)
α⩽v⩽β
φ(v).
Further, u is a solution of (3.4).
PROOF. The proof of this result follows the argument of the proof of Theorem 3.1.
□
As an application of Theorem 3.1, consider the problem
u′′ + μ(t)g(u) + h(t) = 0,
u(0) = 0, u(π) = 0.

C. De Coster and P. Habets
THEOREM 3.3. Let μ, h ∈L∞(0,π) and suppose μ0 = essinfμ(t) > 0. Assume g :R →

Then the problem (3.6) has two inﬁnite sequences of solutions (un)n and (vn)n satisfying

PROOF. Step 1. Claim. For every M ⩾0 there exists β, an upper solution of (3.6), with
β(t) ⩾M on [0,π]. First observe that, if g is unbounded from below on [0,+∞[, we have
a sequence of constant upper solutions βn →+∞. In the opposite case, we can assume
there exists K ⩾0 such that g(u) ⩾−K for u ⩾0.
Given M > 0, we can choose d so that

We deﬁne then β to be the solution of the Cauchy problem
u′′ + ∥μ∥∞

g(u) + K

+ ∥h∥∞= 0,
u(0) = d, u′(0) = 0.
(3.7)
Assume there exists t0 ∈]0,π] such that β(t) > M on [0,t0[ and β(t0) = M. Notice that
on [0,t0], β′(t) ⩽0 and ∥μ∥∞(G(β(t))+Kβ(t))+∥h∥∞β(t) ⩾0. From the conservation
of energy for (3.7), we have

i.e.,
0 ⩽−β′(t) ⩽d

It follows that for any t ∈[0,t0],
d −β(t) ⩽d
2π t0 ⩽d
2 ,
which leads to the contradiction β(t0) ⩾d
2 > M. Hence, the claim follows.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
119
In a similar way, we prove the following.
Claim. For every M ⩾0 there exists a lower solution α of (3.6) such that α(t) ⩽−M
on [0,π].
Step 2. Claim. There exist a sequence of positive real numbers (sn)n with sn →+∞
and z ≻0 such that φ(snz) →−∞. Deﬁne z to be a C1-function such that 0 < z(t) ⩽1
on [0,π], z(0) = 0, z(π) = 0, z′(0) > 0, z′(π) < 0 and z(t) = 1 on [ϵ,π −ϵ] for some
ϵ > 0. Choose (sn)n a sequence of positive real numbers with sn →+∞and G(sn)
s2n
→+∞.
Recall that the assumptions imply G(u) ⩾−K(u2 +1), for some K > 0. We compute then
φ(snz) =

It follows that φ(snz) →−∞.
Step 3. Claim. There exist a sequence of negative real numbers (tn)n with tn →−∞and
z ≻0 such that φ(tnz) →−∞. The argument is similar to Step 2.
Step 4. Conclusion. By Step 1, we have α1,β1 lower and upper solutions of (3.6) with
α1 ⩽β1. Hence, we obtain from Theorem 3.1 a solution u1 of (3.6) such that α1 ⩽u1 ⩽β1.
From Step 2, we have z and s1 such that s1z ⩾u1 and φ(s1z) < φ(u1). Moreover, Step 1
provides the existence of an upper solution β2 with u1 ⩽s1z ⩽β2. Now, by Theorem 3.1,
we have a solution u2 of (3.6) satisfying
u1 ⩽u2 ⩽β2
and
φ(u2) =
min
v∈H 1
0 (a,b)
u1⩽v⩽β2
φ(v) ⩽φ(s1z) < φ(u1).
It follows that u2 ̸= u1.
Iterating this argument and reproducing it in the negative part, we prove the result.

3.2. The minimax method
The minus gradient ﬂow
One of the main techniques in variational methods uses the deformation of paths or surfaces
along the minus gradient (or pseudo-gradient) ﬂow. In this section, we study the dynamical
system associated with such a ﬂow.
We shall deﬁne the minus gradient ﬂow using the following assumptions:
(H) Let f :[a,b] × R →R, (t,u) 
→f (t,u) be an L1-Carathéodory function, locally
Lipschitz in u. Let also m ∈L1(a,b) be such that m > 0 a.e. in [a,b] and f (t,u) −
m(t)u is decreasing in u.
Now, let us deﬁne on H 1

0([a,b]) is continuous. We call the minus gradient ﬂow the local semi-dynamical system
deﬁned on C1
0([a,b]) by u(t;u0).
We could have deﬁned the minus gradient ﬂow in X = C0([a,b]) or H 1
0 (a,b). However,
such choices are not suitable in our context. We have to work with sets such as {u ∈X |
u ≺β} and {u ∈X | u ≻α}, where α and β are lower and upper solutions that satisfy the
boundary conditions. With the C0([a,b]) or the H 1
0 (a,b)-topology, these sets have empty
interior which creates major difﬁculties.
A ﬁrst result shows that the solutions of (3.13) are deﬁned for all t ⩾0.
PROPOSITION 3.5. Let assumptions (H) be satisﬁed and u(t;u0) be the minus gradient
ﬂow deﬁned for some r ∈R. Then for any u0 ∈C1

DEFINITION 3.1. Let u(t;u0) be the minus gradient ﬂow deﬁned for some r ∈R. A non-
empty set M ⊂C1
0([a,b]) is called a positively invariant set if
∀u0 ∈M, ∀t ⩾0,
u(t;u0) ∈M.

is positively invariant. Also, unions and intersections of positively invariant sets are posi-
tively invariant.
To investigate the positive invariance of the cones Cα and Cβ deﬁned by (3.15)
and (3.16), we need the following lemma.
LEMMA 3.6. Let assumptions (H) be satisﬁed. Assume α ∈W 2,1(a,b) is a lower solution
of (3.1). Then for all u ⩾α, we have KNu ⩾α, where K and N are deﬁned by (3.12).
PROOF. Let u ⩾α, set w = KNu −α and observe that w satisﬁes

It follows that w ⩾0.

PROPOSITION 3.7. Let assumptions (H) be satisﬁed and u(t;u0) be the minus gradient
ﬂow deﬁned for some r ∈R. If α ∈W 2,1(a,b) is a lower solution of (3.1), the set Cα
deﬁned by (3.15) is positively invariant. Similarly, if β ∈W 2,1(a,b) is an upper solution
of (3.1), the set Cβ deﬁned by (3.16) is positively invariant.
PROOF. If the claim is wrong, we can ﬁnd u0 ∈Cα and t1 > 0 so that for all t ∈[0,t1[,
u(t;u0) ∈Cα and u(t1;u0) ∈∂Cα.
Let w(t) = u(t;u0)−α, deﬁne a(t) = ψr(φ(u(t;u0))) and observe that for all t ∈[0,t1[

Non-well-ordered lower and upper solutions
The ﬁrst result of this section providesPalais–Smale type sequences from non-well-ordered
lower and upper solutions. As usual, this gives a solution of (3.1) with the help of a Palais–
Smale type condition.
PROPOSITION 3.8. Let assumptions (H) be satisﬁed. Suppose α and β ∈W 2,1(a,b) are
lower and upper solutions of (3.1) and α  β. Deﬁne Cα and Cβ from (3.15) and (3.16),

PROOF. Let us ﬁx δ ∈]0,1[ and deﬁne E = φc−δ ∪Cα ∪Cβ. Observe that E is positively
invariant. Deﬁne A(E) = {u0 ∈C1
0([a,b]) | ∃t ⩾0, u(t;u0) ∈E}. Obviously, this set is
open and positively invariant.
Consider a path γ ∈Γ so that c ⩽maxs∈Tγ φ(γ (s)) ⩽c + δ.
Claim. There exists u0 ∈γ (Tγ ) \ A(E). Assume by contradiction that for every s ∈Tγ ,
γ (s) ∈A(E), i.e., that for every s ∈[0,1], γ (s) ∈A(E).
Let us prove ﬁrst that in such a case there exists T ⩾0 such that for all s ∈[0,1],
u(T ;γ (s)) ∈E. For any s ∈[0,1], we can ﬁnd ts ⩾0 such that u(ts;γ (s)) ∈E. As-
sume next that for every n ∈N, there exists sn ∈[0,1] such that u(n,γ (sn)) /∈E. Go-
ing to a subsequence, we can assume sn →s∗∈[0,1] and, using the contradiction as-
sumption, there exists ts∗⩾0 such that u(ts∗;γ (s∗)) ∈E. As E is open, for all n large

126
C. De Coster and P. Habets
enough u(ts∗;γ (sn)) ∈E which leads to a contradiction as E is positively invariant and
u(n;γ (sn)) /∈E.
Notice now that u(T ;γ (·)) is in Γ and such that φ(u(T ;γ (·))) ⩽c −δ on Tγ which
contradicts the deﬁnition of c.
Conclusion. By construction of A(E) and as φ(u(·;u0)) is decreasing, we have for all
t > 0, u(t;u0) ∈φ−1([c −δ,c + δ]) \ (Cβ ∪Cα). Hence, u satisﬁes

In order to obtain existence of solutions of (3.1), we need to prove that the sequence
(u(tn;u0))n converges towards such a solution. This holds true in case we assume a Palais–
Smale condition.
THE PALAIS–SMALE CONDITION. For every (un)n ⊂H 1

φ(un) is bounded
and
∇φ(un)

there exists a subsequence that converges in H 1
0 (a,b) to some function u such that
∇φ(u) = 0.
It is known that, under our assumptions, the Palais–Smale condition is easy to verify
if φ(u) is coercive or more generally if the Palais–Smale sequences (un)n are bounded
in H 1
0 (a,b).
Our next result is an existence result that uses the Palais–Smale condition.
THEOREM 3.9. Let assumptions (H) be satisﬁed. Suppose α and β ∈W 2,1(a,b) are lower

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
129
A four solutions theorem
This section deals with a problem (3.1) which has the trivial solution u = 0. We consider
assumptions which imply existence of lower and upper solutions αi, βi so that
α1 ⩽β1 ⩽0 ⩽α2 ⩽β2.
The Three Solution theorem (see Theorem 2.7 for the periodic case) will provide three
solutions, two one-sign ones u1 ∈[α1,β1] and u2 ∈[α2,β2] and a third one that can be the
zero solution. The difﬁculty is to obtain a third nontrivial solution. Here such a result is
obtained assuming the slope f (t,u)
u
crosses the two ﬁrst eigenvalues.
THEOREM 3.10. Let assumptions (H) be satisﬁed and assume:
(i) there exist λ > λ2 =
4π2
(b−a)2 and δ > 0 such that for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ∈[−δ,δ],
f (t,u)
u
⩽−λ;
(ii) there exist μ < λ1 =
π2
(b−a)2 and R > 0 such that for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ∈R
with |u| ⩾R,
f (t,u)
u
⩾−μ.
Then the problem (3.1) has at least three nontrivial solutions ui such that u1 ≺0, u2 ≻0
and u3 changes sign.
PROOF. Claim. There exists α1 ≺0 which is a lower solution of (3.1). Let h ∈L1(a,b) be
such that h ⩾0 and for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ⩽0,
f (t,u) < −μu + h(t).
Deﬁne then α1 to be the solution of
u′′ = −μu + h(t),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.
As μ < λ1 and h ⩾0 we have α1 ≺0 and
α′′
1(t) = −μα1(t) + h(t) > f

t,α1(t)

,
α1(a) = 0, α1(b) = 0,
i.e., α1 is a lower solution.
Claim. There exists β2 ≻0 which is an upper solution of (3.1). We construct β2 as we
did for α1.
The modiﬁed problem. Consider the modiﬁed problem
u′′ = ¯f (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(3.19)

¯f (t,s)ds. As usual, it is easy to see that every solution of (3.19) satisﬁes
α1 ⩽u ⩽β2 and is a solution of (3.1).
Existence of the solutions u1 and u2. Deﬁne ϕ1(t) = sin(π t−a
b−a ) and let us ﬁx ϵ > 0
small enough so that ϵ < min{δ/4,λ −λ2}, −4ϵϕ1 ≻α1 and 4ϵϕ1 ≺β2. It is easy to see
that β1 = −ϵϕ1 and α2 = ϵϕ1 are respectively upper and lower solutions of (3.1) but are
not solutions. This follows from
β′′
1(t) = ϵλ1ϕ1(t) < f t,−ϵϕ1(t) = f t,β1(t),
α′′
2(t) = −ϵλ1ϕ1(t) > f

t,ϵϕ1(t)

= f

t,α2(t)

.
Using Assumption (H) and Proposition 2.12, they are strict upper and lower solutions.
Theorem 3.1 applies then with α = αi and β = βi, which implies the existence of solutions
u1 ∈Cβ1 and u2 ∈Cα2.
Existence of a third nontrivial solution. Observe that as ¯φ is coercive, it satisﬁes the
Palais–Smale condition. Hence we can apply Theorem 3.9 with α = α2 and β = β1. This
proves the existence of a solution u3 ∈C1
0([a,b]) \ (Cβ1 ∪Cα2), i.e. u3 ̸= u1 and u3 ̸= u2.
The main problem is to prove that u3 is not the trivial solution. To this aim, we prove that
c = ¯φ(u3) < 0 = ¯φ(0).

Hence c ⩽−ϵ3
2 (b −a) < 0. This implies the third solution u3 is nontrivial.
Claim. The function u3 changes sign. Assume u3 ⩾0 and deﬁne η = max{τ ⩾0 | u3 −
τϕ1 ⩾0}. Observe ﬁrst that
u′′
3 −m(t)u3 = f (tu3) −m(t)u3 ⩽f (t,0) = 0,
u3(a) = 0,
u3(b) = 0.
As u3 ̸= 0, we deduce from the maximum principle that u3 ≻0 which implies that η > 0.
Let us assume now that η < δ. We can ﬁnd then t0 ∈[a,b] such that u3(t0) −ηϕ1(t0) = 0,
u′
3(t0) −ηϕ′
1(t0) = 0 and for t close enough to t0

This contradicts the minimality of u3 −ηϕ1 for t = t0. It follows that u3 ⩾δϕ1 ≻α2 which
contradicts the localization of u3.
We prove in a similar way that u3 cannot be negative. Therefore u3 changes sign.
□

An additional solution can be obtained by combining variational methods and degree the-
ory. Here we impose that the slope −f (t,u)

small values of u.

(b−a)2 and R > 0 such that for a.e. t ∈[a,b] and all u ∈R

⩾−μ.
Then the problem (3.1) has at least four nontrivial solutions ui such that u1 ≺0, u2 ≻0
and u3, u4 change sign.
PROOF. As in the proof of Theorem 3.10, we choose strict lower solutions αi and strict
upper solutions βi such that
α1 ≺−δϕ1 ≺β1 = −εϕ1
and
α2 = εϕ1 ≺δϕ1 ≺β2,
where ε ∈]0,δ[. As in Theorem 1.3, we can prove the problem (3.1) has two solutions u1 ≺
β1 and u2 ≻α2 such that u1 is the maximum solution in [α1,β1] and u2 is the minimum
solution in [α2,β2]. Moreover we can prove as in the proof of Theorem 3.10 that
u1 ≺−δϕ1
and
u2 ≻δϕ1.
Consider now the modiﬁed problem
u′′ = ¯f (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(3.20)

satisﬁes u1 ⩽u ⩽u2 and is a solution of (3.1). As in the proof of Theorem 3.10, we see

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems

that the problem (3.20) and hence (3.1) has a third solution u3 ̸= 0, which changes sign
and is such that
¯φ(u3) = inf
γ ∈Γ max



where Γ and Tγ are deﬁned in (3.17) with φ replaced by ¯φ. Assume by contradiction
that the only solutions of (3.20) are u1, u2, u3 and 0. As u1 −1 is a strict lower solution
of (3.20) and u1 is the only solution in Cu1−1 ∩Cβ1, by Theorem 3.1, u1 minimizes ¯φ
on a C1
0([a,b])-neighbourhood of this point. It is also a minimizer on some H 1
0 (a,b)-
neighbourhood as follows from Theorem 8 in [38]. Similarly, u2 is a local minimizer of ¯φ
in H 1
0 (a,b). By [7], there exists r > 0 such that
deg

I −KN,B(u1,r)

= 1
and
deg

I −KN,B(u2,r)

= 1,
where K, N are deﬁned from (3.12) with f replaced by ¯f and m = 0.
Suppose ¯φ(u1) ⩾¯φ(u2); a similar argument holds if ¯φ(u2) > ¯φ(u1). We can prove
(see [37]) that there exists γ > 0 such that
inf
 ¯φ(u) | ∥u −u1∥H 1
0 = γ

Hence, by the Mountain Pass theorem [57], u3 is of mountain pass type and there exists
r > 0 such that

= −1.
Moreover, as KN(H 1
0 (a,b)) ⊂B(0,R) for some R > 0,
deg

I −KN,B(0,R)

= 1.
Let us prove next that for r > 0 small enough

Consider the homotopy

u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.

Hence, for every ϵ > 0, we can ﬁnd r > 0 small enough such that if u ∈∂B(0,r) is a
solution of (3.21), we have

u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,

using properties of the degree, we can write

This proves existence of an additional nontrivial solution u4 of (3.20). Recall that such a
solution lies in [u1,u2] and from the deﬁnition of u1 and u2, u4 /∈Cβ1 ∪Cα2. Arguing as
in Theorem 3.10, we prove then that this solution changes sign.
□
3.3. Historical and bibliographical notes
As we mentioned in the introduction, existence of a minimum of the related functional
between a lower and an upper solution was noticed independently by Chang [17,18] and
de Figueiredo and Solimini [38]. Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 provide such a result respectively
for the Dirichlet and the periodic problem.
De Figueiredo and Solimini [38] noticed that under certain conditions, the minimum
obtained between the lower and the upper solution is valid in the H 1
0 -topology. More re-
cently Brezis and Nirenberg [13] pointed out the interest of this result and extended it to
nonlinearities with critical growth.
Application to the existence of sequences of solutions as in Theorem 3.3 is due to Omari
and Zanolin [76]. Proposition 3.4, which considers a prescribed mean curvature problem,
is adapted from Habets and Omari [49].
The idea to combine invariant sets in C1 with variational methods is worked out in Sec-
tion 3.2. This gives a new point of view on the relation with variational methods. This
goes back to Chang [17,18]. Developments of this idea can be found in [10,19,26,56,67,
68]. The study of the Dirichlet problem with nonordered lower and upper solutions as in
Theorem 3.9 presents an alternative to the result of [24]. The Four Solutions theorem and
the Five Solutions theorem (Theorems 3.10 and 3.11) are known results and can be found,
with another proof, in [56].

4. Monotone methods
4.1. Abstract results
Let Z be a Banach space. An order cone K ⊂Z is a closed set such that
for all u and v ∈K, u + v ∈K,
for all t ∈R+ and u ∈K, tu ∈K,
if u ∈K and −u ∈K then u = 0.
Such a cone K induces an order on Z:
u ⩽v
if and only if
v −u ∈K.
We write equivalently u ⩽v or v ⩾u. The cone is said to be normal if there exists c > 0
such that 0 ⩽u ⩽v implies ∥u∥⩽c∥v∥.
The following theorem gives conditions for an increasing sequence (αn)n to converge to
a ﬁxed point of an operator T .
THEOREM 4.1. Let X ⊂Z be continuously included Banach spaces so that Z has a nor-
mal order cone. Let α and β ∈X, α ⩽β,
E = {u ∈X | α ⩽u ⩽β}
(4.1)
and let T :E →X be completely continuous in X. Assume the sequence (αn)n deﬁned by
α0 = α,
αn = T αn−1,
(4.2)
is bounded in X and for all n ∈N
αn ⩽αn+1 ⩽β.
Then the sequence (αn)n converges monotonically in X to a ﬁxed point u of T such that
α ⩽u ⩽β.
PROOF. Claim. The sequence (αn)n converges in X. The sequence (αn)n is increasing and
included in E. As the set A = {αn | n ∈N} is bounded in X, T (A) is relatively compact
in X. Hence, any sequence (αnk)k ⊂(αn)n has a converging subsequence in X and there-
fore in Z. As the order cone is normal and the sequence is monotone, the sequence itself
converges in Z, i.e., there exists u ∈Z so that
α ⩽u ⩽β
and
αn
Z
→u.

136
C. De Coster and P. Habets
It follows that all such subsequences converging in X have the same limit u, which implies
αn
X
→u.
Next, we deduce from the continuity of T that u is a ﬁxed point of T .
□
A similar result holds to prove the convergence of decreasing sequences (βn)n.
THEOREM 4.2. Let X ⊂Z be continuously included Banach spaces so that Z has a nor-
mal order cone. Let α and β ∈X, α ⩽β, E be deﬁned by (4.1) and T :E →X be com-
pletely continuous in X. Assume the sequence (βn)n deﬁned by
β0 = β,
βn = Tβn−1,
(4.3)
is bounded in X and for all n ∈N
βn ⩾βn+1 ⩾α.
Then the sequence (βn)n converges monotonically in X to a ﬁxed point v of T such that
α ⩽v ⩽β.
As a corollary we can write the following result which deals with maps T that are
monotone increasing, i.e., u ⩽v implies T u ⩽T v.
THEOREM 4.3. Let X ⊂Z be continuously included Banach spaces so that Z has a nor-
mal order cone. Let α and β ∈X, α ⩽β, E be deﬁned by (4.1) and let T :E →X be
continuous and monotone increasing. Assume T (E) is relatively compact in X and
α ⩽T α
and
Tβ ⩽β.
Then, the sequence (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by (4.2) and (4.3) converge monotonically
in X to ﬁxed points umin and umax of T such that
α ⩽umin ⩽umax ⩽β.
Further, any ﬁxed point u ∈E of T veriﬁes
umin ⩽u ⩽umax.
PROOF. Claim 1. The sequence (αn)n converges in X to a ﬁxed point umin of T such that
α ⩽umin ⩽β. As T is monotone increasing, we prove by induction that for any n ∈N,
αn ⩽αn+1 ⩽β. Hence, (αn)n ⊂E and since T (E) is relatively compact in X the sequence
(αn)n is bounded in X. The claim follows now from Theorem 4.1. Recall that T is com-
pletely continuous as T (E) is relatively compact.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
137
Claim 2. The sequence (βn)n converges in X to a ﬁxed point umax of T such that umin ⩽
umax ⩽β. Using Theorem 4.2 with α = umin, we prove, as for Claim 1, existence of a ﬁxed
point umax such that umin ⩽umax ⩽β.
Claim 3. Any ﬁxed point u ∈E of T veriﬁes umin ⩽u ⩽umax. Since α ⩽u ⩽β, we
deduce by induction αn = T αn−1 ⩽T u = u ⩽Tβn−1 = βn. The claim follows now by
going to the limit.
□
4.2. Well-ordered lower and upper solutions
The periodic problem
Consider the periodic boundary value problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(4.4)
where f is a continuous function.
Our aim is to build an approximation scheme, easy to compute, that converges to solu-
tions of (4.4). To this end, given continuous functions α and β, and M > 0, we consider
the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by
α0 = α,
α′′
n −Mαn = f (t,αn−1) −Mαn−1,
αn(a) = αn(b), α′
n(a) = α′
n(b)
(4.5)
and
β0 = β,
β′′
n −Mβn = f (t,βn−1) −Mβn−1,
(4.6)
βn(a) = βn(b), β′
n(a) = β′
n(b).
The approximations αn and βn are “easy to compute”, in the sense that for every n, the
problems (4.5) and (4.6) are linear and have unique solutions which read explicitly
αn(t) =
 b

G(t,s)

u′′ −Mu = f (t),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(4.7)

138
C. De Coster and P. Habets
Clearly this does not avoid numerical difﬁculties such as those related to stiff systems. This
will be the case if we have to pick M very large.
The following theorem proves the convergence of the αn and βn.
THEOREM 4.4. Let α and β ∈C2([a,b]), α ⩽β and E be deﬁned from (1.2). Assume
f :E →R is a continuous function, there exists M > 0 such that for all (t,u1), (t,u2) ∈E,
u1 ⩽u2
implies
f (t,u2) −f (t,u1) ⩽M(u2 −u1)
and for all t ∈[a,b]
α′′(t) ⩾f

t,α(t)

,
α(a) = α(b), α′(a) ⩾α′(b),
β′′(t) ⩽f

t,β(t)

,
β(a) = β(b), β′(a) ⩽β′(b).
Then the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by (4.5) and (4.6) converge monotonically in
C1([a,b]) to solutions umin and umax of (4.4) such that
α ⩽umin ⩽umax ⩽β.
Further, any solution u of (4.4) with graph in E veriﬁes
umin ⩽u ⩽umax.
PROOF. Let X = C1([a,b]), Z = C([a,b]), K = {u ∈Z | u(t) ⩾0 on [a,b]} be the order
cone in Z and E be deﬁned from (4.1). Deﬁne the operator T :E →X by
T u(t) =
 b
a
G(t,s)

f

s,u(s)

−Mu(s)

ds,
where G(t,s) is the Green’s function of (4.7). This operator is continuous in X and
monotone increasing. Further, T (E) is relatively compact in X, α ⩽T α and β ⩾Tβ. The
proof follows now from Theorem 4.3.
□
REMARK. Notice that the assumption α and β ∈C2([a,b]) is not restrictive. If these func-
tions are lower and upper solutions with angles, the ﬁrst iterates α1 and β1 satisfy the
assumptions of the theorem and are such that α ⩽α1 ⩽β1 ⩽β.
Next, we consider a derivative dependent problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(4.8)
As above, given α, β ∈C1([a,b]) and L > 0, we consider the approximation schemes
α0 = α,
α′′
n −Lαn = f (t,αn−1,α′
n−1) −Lαn−1,
(4.9)
αn(a) = αn(b), α′
n(a) = α′
n(b)

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
139
and
β0 = β,
β′′
n −Lβn = f (t,βn−1,β′
n−1) −Lβn−1,
(4.10)
βn(a) = βn(b), β′
n(a) = β′
n(b).
Such problems lead to a major difﬁculty. A straightforward application of the previous
ideas would be to assume that for any u1, u2, v1 and v2,
u1 ⩽u2
implies
f (t,u2,v2) −f (t,u1,v1) ⩽L(u2 −u1).
This would mean that f does not depend on derivatives.
The next theorem works out the difﬁculty. It is however weaker than Theorem 4.4 since
it does not give maximal and minimal solutions. Its proof relies on the following maximum
principle (see [6] or [85]).
PROPOSITION 4.5 (Maximum Principle). Let p, q ∈L1(a,b) be such that the ﬁrst eigen-
value λ1 of
−u′′ + pu′ + qu + λu = 0,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
satisﬁes λ1 < 0. Assume u ∈W 2,1(a,b) is a nontrivial function such that
−u′′ + pu′ + qu ⩾0,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) ⩽u′(b).
Then u > 0 on [a,b].
In general, we shall use the case where p = 0 and q > 0 are constants.
THEOREM 4.6. Let α and β ∈C2([a,b]) and E be deﬁned from (1.19). Assume f :E →R
is a continuous function, there exists M ⩾0 such that for all (t,u1,v), (t,u2,v) ∈E,
u1 ⩽u2
implies
f (t,u2,v) −f (t,u1,v) ⩽M(u2 −u1),
(4.11)
there exists N ⩾0 such that for all (t,u,v1), (t,u,v2) ∈E,


f (t,u,v2) −f (t,u,v1)


 ⩽N|v2 −v1|
(4.12)
and for all t ∈[a,b]
α′′(t) ⩾f t,α(t),α′(t),
α(a) = α(b), α′(a) ⩾α′(b),
β′′(t) ⩽f

t,β(t),β′(t)

,
β(a) = β(b), β′(a) ⩽β′(b).

Finally, let L > 0 be such that
L ⩾M + N2

N2 + 4M
(4.13)
and for all t ∈[a,b]
f t,α(t),α′(t) −f t,β(t),β′(t) + Lβ(t) −α(t) ⩾0.
Then, the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by (4.9) and (4.10) converge monotonically
in C1([a,b]) to solutions u and v of (4.8) such that
α ⩽u ⩽v ⩽β.
REMARKS. (a) The function w = β −α ⩾0 satisﬁes
−w′′ + N|w′| + (M + 1)w = h(t) ⩾0,
w(a) = w(b), w′(b) ⩾w′(a).
Hence, using the maximum principle we can prove that, if α ̸= β, our assumptions imply
α < β on [a,b]. Also if u is a solution of (4.8) such that α ≨u ≨β, we have α < u < β.
(b) It is clear from Remark (a) that the assumptions on L are satisﬁed if L is large enough
so that the theorem applies for any values of M and N which satisfy the assumptions (4.11)
and (4.12).
(c) The conditions on L are immediately satisﬁed with L = M if the function f does
not depend on the derivative u′ (i.e., N = 0).
(d) If α or β is a solution of (4.8), we have αn = α for all n ∈N or βn = β for all n ∈N.
PROOF OF THEOREM 4.6. The proof uses Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 with X = C1([a,b]),
Z = C([a,b]) and K = {u ∈Z | u(t) ⩾0 on [a,b]} as the order cone in Z. Let E be deﬁned
from (4.1). The operator T :E →X, deﬁned by


−Lu(s)

where G(t,s) is the Green’s function of (4.7) with M = L, is completely continuous in X.
With these notations, the approximation schemes (4.9) and (4.10) are equivalent to (4.2)
and (4.3).
A: Claim. Let L > 0 satisfy (4.13). Then the functions αn deﬁned recursively by (4.9)
are such that for all n ∈N,
(a) αn is a lower solution, i.e.,
α′′
n(t) ⩾f

t,αn(t),α′
n(t)

,
αn(a) = αn(b), α′
n(a) ⩾α′
n(b),
(4.14)
(b) αn+1 ⩾αn.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems

The proof is by induction.
Initial step: n = 0. The condition (4.14) for n = 0 is an assumption. Next, w = α1 −α0
is a solution of
−w′′ + Lw = α′′
0(t) −f t,α0(t),α′
0(t) ⩾0,
w(a) = w(b), w′(a) ⩽w′(b).
Hence, we deduce (b) from the maximum principle.
Inductive step – 1st part: assume (a) and (b) hold for some n and let us prove that
α′′
n+1(t) ⩾f t,αn+1(t),α′
n+1(t),
αn+1(a) = αn+1(b), α′
n+1(a) ⩾α′
n+1(b).
Let w = αn+1 −αn. We have
−α′′
n+1 + f (t,αn+1,α′
n+1)
= f (t,αn+1,α′
n+1) −f (t,αn,α′

⩽M(αn+1 −αn) + N|α′
n+1 −α′
n| −L(αn+1 −αn)
= (M −L)w + N|w′|.
On the other hand, w satisﬁes
−w′′ + Lw = h(t),
w(a) = w(b), w′(b) −w′(a) = A,
(4.15)
with h(t) := α′′
n(t) −f (t,αn(t),α′

Since h is non-positive and

for all x ∈R, we obtain (M −L)w + N|w′| ⩽0 if M −L + N

L ⩽0, which follows
from (4.13).
Inductive step – 2nd part: assume (a) and (b) hold for some n and let us prove that
αn+2 ⩾αn+1. The function w = αn+2 −αn+1 satisﬁes (4.15), where
h(t) := α′′
n+1(t) −f t,αn+1(t),α′

and
A = 0.
From the previous step h(t) ⩾0 and the claim follows from the maximum principle.
B: Claim. Let L > 0 satisfy (4.13). Then the functions βn deﬁned recursively by (4.10)
are such that for all n ∈N,
(a) βn is an upper solution, i.e.,
β′′

,
βn(a) = βn(b), β′
n(a) ⩽β′

The proof of this claim parallels the proof of Claim A.

The proof of the claim is by induction.
Initial step: α1 ⩽β1. The function w1 is a solution of (4.15) with h = h0 ⩾0 and A = 0.
Using the maximum principle, we deduce that w1 ⩾0, i.e., α1 ⩽β1.
Inductive step: Let n ⩾2. If hn−2 ⩾0 and αn−1 ⩽βn−1, then hn−1 ⩾0 and αn ⩽βn.
First, let us prove that, for all t ∈[a,b], the function hn−1 is nonnegative. Indeed, we have
hn−1 = f (·,αn−1,α′
n−1) −f (·,βn−1,β′
n−1) + L(βn−1 −αn−1)

Recall that wn−1 is a solution of (4.15) with h(t) = hn−2(t) ⩾0 and A = 0. Hence, we
can proceed as in the proof of Claim A to show that hn−1 ⩾0. It follows then from the
maximum principle that wn is nonnegative, i.e., αn ⩽βn.
D: Claim. There exists R > 0 such that any solution u of
u′′ ⩽f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
with α ⩽u ⩽β satisﬁes ∥u′∥∞< R. We deduce from the assumptions that
u′′ = f (t,u,u′) + h(t)
where h(t) ⩽0 and f (t,u,u′) + h(t) ⩽maxE |f (t,u,0)| + N|u′|. The proof follows now
using Proposition 1.7.
E: Claim. There exists R > 0 such that any solution u of
u′′ ⩾f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
with α ⩽u ⩽β satisﬁes ∥u′∥∞< R. The proof repeats the argument of Claim D (See the
remark that follows Proposition 1.7).
F: Conclusion. We deduce from Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 that the sequences (αn)n and
(βn)n converge monotonically in C1([a,b]) to functions u and v which are solutions
of (4.8) such that α ⩽u ⩽β and α ⩽v ⩽β. Further, as αn ⩽βn for any n, we have
u ⩽v.
□
REMARK. Notice that with a little additional work we can reduce problems to cases where
Theorem 4.6 applies. For example, it does not apply to problem
u′′ −u + (u′)2 = sin t,
u(0) = u(2π), u′(0) = u′(2π),
as (4.12) is not satisﬁed. However, we can work it out as follows. Notice ﬁrst that this
problem satisﬁes a Nagumo condition. Next, we know that lower and upper solutions,
α and β ∈[−1,1], of problems that satisfy such a Nagumo condition have a priori bounded
derivatives: ∥α′∥∞and ∥β′∥∞⩽R. We can modify then the equation for |u′| ⩾R so that
the same Nagumo condition is satisﬁed for the modiﬁed problem together with (4.12). It
follows then that the approximations deﬁned from (4.9) and (4.10) satisfy the same bounds
and that convergence of the approximations holds.
The Dirichlet problem
As in the periodic case, we can work with the Dirichlet problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(4.16)
where f is a continuous function.
The following result paraphrases Theorem 4.4.

THEOREM 4.7. Let α and β ∈C2([a,b]), α ⩽β and let E be deﬁned from (1.2). Assume
f :E →R is a continuous function, there exists M ⩾0 such that for all (t,u1), (t,u2) ∈E,

Then the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by

converge uniformly and monotonically to solutions umin and umax of (4.16) such that
α ⩽umin ⩽umax ⩽β.
Further, any solution u of (4.16) with graph in E veriﬁes
umin ⩽u ⩽umax.
PROOF. The proof of this theorem repeats the argument of Theorem 4.4.

In case of derivative dependent equations
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(4.17)
approximation schemes similar to (4.9), (4.10) do not work. Here we have to work out a
generalization as in the following theorem. Notice that we use lower and upper solutions
that verify the boundary conditions.
THEOREM 4.8. Let α and β ∈C2([a,b]), α ⩽β and let E be deﬁned from (1.19). As-

Finally, let K0 ∈C([a,b]) be such that K0(a) > 0 and for all t ∈[a,b], K0(t) = −K0(b +

[a,b], we have
α(t) ⩽u(t) ⩽v(t) ⩽β(t).
PROOF. The above result can be proved adapting the proof of Theorem 4.6.
□
4.3. Lower and upper solutions in reversed order
Consider the periodic boundary value problem
u′′ = f (t,u),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
(4.18)
where f is a continuous function.
In Section 4.2, we have built an approximation scheme for solutions of (4.18) based on
the maximum principle. Here, we consider a similar approach based on the antimaximum
principle. Given continuous functions α and β, and M > 0, we consider the sequences
(αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by
α0 = α,
α′′
n + Mαn = f (t,αn−1) + Mαn−1,
(4.19)
αn(a) = αn(b), α′

n + Mβn = f (t,βn−1) + Mβn−1,

βn(a) = βn(b), β′
n(a) = β′
n(b).
If M is not an eigenvalue of the periodic problem, i.e., M ̸= ( 2nπ
b−a)2 with n ∈N, the func-
tions αn and βn, solutions of (4.19) and (4.20), can be written explicitly

where G(t,s) is the Green’s function of the problem
u′′ + Mu = f (t),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(4.21)
The next theorem indicates a framework to obtain convergence of the αn and βn to
extremal solutions of (4.18). To prove this result we need the following antimaximum
principle.
PROPOSITION 4.9 (Antimaximum Principle). Let q ∈]0,
π2
(b−a)2 ]. Suppose u ∈C2([a,b])
is a solution of
u′′ + qu = f (t),
u(a) −u(b) = 0, u′(a) −u′(b) = A,
(4.22)
where A ⩾0 and f ∈C([a,b]), f (t) ⩾0. Then u ⩾0 on [a,b].
PROOF. Claim 1. If f ̸≡0, solutions u of (4.22) are one-signed. Let t0 be a zero of u.
Extend u by periodicity, deﬁne v(t) = sin√q(t −t0) and compute
u′(t0)sin√q(b −a) ⩾(u′v −v′u)|b
t0 + (u′v −v′u)|t0+b−a
b
=
 t0+b−a
t0
f (s)sin √q(s −t0)ds > 0.
If q =
π2
(b−a)2 , this is contradictory. If q ̸=
π2
(b−a)2 , this implies u′(t0) > 0 and u cannot be a
periodic function.

Claim 2. If f ̸≡0, any one-signed solution of (4.22) is positive. Direct integration of
(4.22) gives
q
 b
a
u(s)ds =
 b
a
f (s)ds + A > 0.
Hence, we have u(t) > 0.
Claim 3. If f (t) ≡0, u(t) ⩾0. We deduce from a direct integration that
u(t) = A cos√q( a+b
2
−t)
2√q sin √q( b−a
2 )
⩾0.
□
THEOREM 4.10. Let α and β ∈C2([a,b]), β ⩽α and
E :=

(t,u) ∈[a,b] × R | β(t) ⩽u ⩽α(t)

.
Assume f :E →R is a continuous function, there exists M ∈]0,
π2
(b−a)2 ] such that for all
(t,u1), (t,u2) ∈E,
u1 ⩽u2
implies
f (t,u2) −f (t,u1) ⩾−M(u2 −u1)
and for all t ∈[a,b]
α′′(t) ⩾f t,α(t),
α(a) = α(b), α′(a) ⩾α′(b),
β′′(t) ⩽f t,β(t),
β(a) = β(b), β′(a) ⩽β′(b).
Then the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by (4.19) and (4.20) converge monotonically
in C1([a,b]) to solutions umax and umin of (4.18) such that
β ⩽umin ⩽umax ⩽α.
Further, any solution u of (4.18) with graph in E veriﬁes
umin ⩽u ⩽umax.
PROOF. Let X = C1([a,b]), Z = C([a,b]), K = {u ∈Z | u(t) ⩾0 on [a,b]} be the order
cone in Z and
E = {u ∈X | β ⩽u ⩽α}.

where G(t,s) is the Green’s function of (4.21), is continuous in X and monotone increasing
(see Proposition 4.9). Further, T (E) is relatively compact in X, β ⩽Tβ and α ⩾T α. The
proof follows now from Theorem 4.3, where α and β have to be interchanged.
□
Next, we consider the derivative dependent problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
(4.24)
As above, given α, β ∈C1([a,b]) and L > 0, we consider the approximation schemes
α0 = α,
α′′
n + Lαn = f (t,αn−1,α′
n−1) + Lαn−1,
(4.25)
αn(a) = αn(b), α′

and
β0 = β,

n + Lβn = f (t,βn−1,β′
n−1) + Lβn−1,
(4.26)
βn(a) = βn(b), β′
n(a) = β′
n(b).
The following result is a counterpart of Theorem 4.6.
THEOREM 4.11. Let α and β ∈C2([a,b]), β ⩽α and
E :=

(t,u,v) ∈[a,b] × R2 | β(t) ⩽u ⩽α(t)

Assume f :E →R is a continuous function, there exists M ∈]0,
π2
(b−a)2[ such that for all
(t,u1,v), (t,u2,v) ∈E,
u1 ⩽u2
implies
f (t,u2,v) −f (t,u1,v) ⩾−M(u2 −u1),
there exists N ⩾0 such that for all (t,u,v1), (t,u,v2) ∈E,

Then, the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n deﬁned by (4.25) and (4.26) converge monotonically
in C1([a,b]) to solutions u and v of (4.24) such that
β ⩽v ⩽u ⩽α.
PROOF. The proof uses Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 with X = C1([a,b]), Z = C([a,b]) and
K = {u ∈Z | u(t) ⩾0 on [a,b]} as the order cone in Z. Let E be deﬁned from (4.23). The

tinuous in X. With these notations, the approximation schemes (4.25) and (4.26) are equiv-
alent to (4.3) and (4.2).
A: Claim. Let L > 0 satisfy (4.27). Then the functions αn deﬁned recursively by (4.25)
are such that for all n ∈N,
(a) αn is a lower solution, i.e.,
α′′

,
αn(a) = αn(b), α′
n(a) ⩾α′
n(b),
(4.28)
(b) αn+1 ⩽αn.
The proof is by induction.
Initial step: n = 0. The condition (4.28) for n = 0 is an assumption. Next, w = α0 −α1
is a solution of
w′′ + Lw = α′′
0(t) −f t,α0(t),α′
0(t) ⩾0,
w(a) = w(b), w′(a) ⩾w′(b).
Hence, we deduce (b) from the antimaximum principle (Proposition 4.9).
Inductive step – 1st part: assume (a) and (b) hold for some n and let us prove that
α′′
n+1(t) ⩾f

t,αn+1(t),α′

αn+1(a) = αn+1(b), α′

Let w = αn −αn+1 ⩾0. We have

On the other hand, w satisﬁes
w′′ + Lw = h(t),
w(a) = w(b), w′(a) −w′(b) = C,
(4.29)
with h(t) := α′′

Hence αn+1 is a lower solution.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
151
Inductive step – 2nd part: assume (a) and (b) hold for some n and let us prove that
αn+2 ⩽αn+1. The function w = αn+1 −αn+2 satisﬁes (4.29), where
h(t) := α′′
n+1(t) −f

t,αn+1(t),α′
n+1(t)

and
C = 0.
From the previous step h(t) ⩾0 and the claim follows from the antimaximum principle
(Proposition 4.9).
B: Claim. Let L > 0 satisfy (4.27). Then the functions βn deﬁned recursively by (4.26)
are such that for all n ∈N,
(a) βn is an upper solution, i.e.,
β′′
n(t) ⩽f t,βn(t),β′
n(t),
βn(a) = βn(b), β′
n(a) ⩽β′
n(b),
(b) βn+1 ⩾βn.
The proof of this claim parallels the proof of Claim A.
C: Claim. αn ⩾βn. Deﬁne, for all i ∈N, wi = αi −βi and

−f

t,βi(t),β′

+ L

αi(t) −βi(t)

.
The proof of the claim is by induction.
Initial step: α1 ⩾β1. The function w1 is a solution of (4.29) with h = h0 ⩾0 and C = 0.
Using the antimaximum principle (Proposition 4.9), we deduce that w1 ⩾0, i.e., α1 ⩾β1.
Inductive step: Let n ⩾2. If hn−2 ⩾0 and αn−1 ⩾βn−1, then hn−1 ⩾0 and αn ⩾βn.
First, let us prove that, for all t ∈[a,b], the function hn−1 is nonnegative. Indeed, we have
hn−1 = f (·,αn−1,α′
n−1) −f (·,βn−1,β′
n−1) + L(αn−1 −βn−1)
⩾−M(αn−1 −βn−1) −N|α′
n−1 −β′
n−1| + L(αn−1 −βn−1)
= (L −M)wn−1 −N|w′
n−1|.
Recall that wn−1 is a solution of (4.29) with h(t) = hn−2(t) ⩾0 and C = 0. Hence, we
can proceed as in the proof of Claim A to show that hn−1 ⩾0. It follows then from the
antimaximum principle (Proposition 4.9) that wn is nonnegative, i.e., αn ⩽βn.
D: Claim. There exists R > 0 such that any solution u of
u′′ ⩽f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
with β ⩽u ⩽α satisﬁes ∥u′∥∞< R. We deduce from the assumptions that
u′′ = f (t,u,u′) + h(t),
where h(t) ⩽0 and f (t,u,u′) + h(t) ⩽maxE |f (t,u,0)| + N|u′|. The proof follows now
using Proposition 1.7.

152
C. De Coster and P. Habets
E: Claim. There exists R > 0 such that any solution u of
u′′ ⩾f (t,u,u′),
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b),
with β ⩽u ⩽α satisﬁes ∥u′∥∞< R. The proof repeats the argument of Claim D but uses
the remark following Proposition 1.7.
F: Conclusion. We deduce from Theorems 4.2 and 4.1, where α and β have to be in-
terchanged, that the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n converge monotonically in C1([a,b]) to
functions u and v such that β ⩽v ⩽α and β ⩽u ⩽α. Further Claim C implies v ⩽u. □
4.4. A mixed approximation scheme
In this section, we consider a derivative independent Dirichlet problem
u′′ = f (t,u,u),
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.
(4.30)
Here we write the nonlinearity so that f (t,u,v) is nonincreasing in u and nondecreasing
in v. We work out an approximation scheme which provides only bounds on the solutions.
However, we shall give assumptions which imply these bounds to be equal, so that they are
solutions.
Let us introduce the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 4.1. Functions α and β ∈C([a,b]) are coupled lower and upper quasi-
solutions of (4.30) if
(a) for any t ∈[a,b], α(t) ⩽β(t);

and f :E →R be an L1-Carathéodory function such that f (t,u,v) is nonincreasing in u
and nondecreasing in v. Assume α0 and β0 are coupled lower and upper quasi-solutions
of (4.30). Then, the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n, deﬁned for n ⩾1 by
α′′
n = f (t,αn−1,βn−1),
αn(a) = 0, αn(b) = 0,
β′′
n = f (t,βn−1,αn−1),
βn(a) = 0, βn(b) = 0,
converge in C1([a,b]) to functions umin and umax. The pair (umin,umax) is a solution
of (4.31) such that
α0 ⩽umin ⩽umax ⩽β0.
Moreover, any solution (u,v) of (4.31) with α0 ⩽u ⩽β0, α0 ⩽v ⩽β0 is such that
umin ⩽u ⩽umax,
umin ⩽v ⩽umax.
PROOF. Let X = C1([a,b]) × C1([a,b]), Z = C([a,b]) × C([a,b]), K = {(u,v) ∈Z |
u ⩾0,v ⩽0} and E = {(u,v) ∈X | α0 ⩽u ⩽β0, α0 ⩽v ⩽β0}. We deﬁne T :E →X,
(u,v) 
→T (u,v), where T (u,v) is the solution (x,y) of
x′′ = f (t,u,v),
x(a) = 0, x(b) = 0,
y′′ = f (t,v,u),
y(a) = 0, y(b) = 0.
Next, we verify that T is continuous, monotone increasing, T (E) is relatively compact in X
and
(α,β) ⩽T (α,β),
(β,α) ⩾T (β,α).
Now, Theorem 4.3 applies with α = (α0,β0) and β = (β0,α0), and the claims follow.
□
Notice that if u is a solution of the given problem (4.30), then (u,u) is a solution of the
auxiliary problem (4.31), whence umin and umax are bounds on solutions of (4.30). The fol-
lowing proposition proves, under appropriate assumptions, convergence of the sequences
deﬁned in Proposition 4.12 to the unique solution of the given problem (4.30).
THEOREM 4.13. Suppose the assumptions of Proposition 4.12 hold. Assume moreover
(i) there exists ϵ > 0 such that α0 ⩾ϵβ0;

Then, the functions umin and umax deﬁned in Proposition 4.12 are equal, i.e., are solutions
of (4.30).
PROOF. From assumption (i), we deduce
ϵumax ⩽umin ⩽umax.
Let s0 = sup{s | sumax ⩽umin}. It is obvious that s0 ∈[ϵ,1] and that s0umax ⩽umin. From
the deﬁnition of s0, we deduce the existence of t0 ∈[a,b] such that
umin(t0) −s0umax(t0) = 0,
u′
min(t0) −s0u′
max(t0) = 0.
If t0 ̸= b, we also have t1 > t0 such that u′
min(t1) −s0u′
max(t1) = 0.
Assume now that s0 < 1. Hence, we can write
s0u′′
max = s0f (·,umax,umin) ⩾s0f

A similar argument holds if t0 = b. Hence s0 = 1 and umax = umin.

4.5. Historical and bibliographical notes
The idea of associating to a pair of well-ordered lower and upper solutions, monotone
sequences of lower and upper solutions converging to solutions is far older than the theory
presented here. It goes back at least to Picard whose contribution can be found in two
“mémoires”, the ﬁrst one [79] in 1890 and the second one [80] in 1893. In [80], the author
considers the problem
u′′ + f (t,u) = 0,
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
(4.32)
in case f (t,·) is increasing. He exhibits then a function α0 such that
α′′
0 + f (t,α0) > 0,
on ]a,b[,
α0(a) = 0,
α0(b) = 0,
i.e., a lower solution, and considers the iterations
α′′
n + f (t,αn−1) = 0,
αn(a) = 0, αn(b) = 0.

The lower and upper solutions method for boundary value problems
155
At last he observes that the sequence (αn)n is increasing and converges to a solution u
of (4.32) greater than α0. This gives an approximation process to compute the solutions
of (4.32) that we will call the ﬁrst monotone approximation scheme. Theorems 4.4 and 4.7
are very close to this approach.
In [79], Picard introduces a second monotone approximation scheme. He studies an el-
liptic Dirichlet problem in the opposite situation where f (t,·) is decreasing. His main
result gives bounds on the solutions of (4.32). Under appropriate assumptions on f , he
deﬁnes α0 = 0 and considers, for n ⩾1, the solutions αn and βn of the following problems
β′′
n + f (t,αn−1) = 0,
βn(a) = 0, βn(b) = 0,
α′′
n + f (t,βn) = 0,
αn(a) = 0, αn(b) = 0.
Here αn ⩽βn, (αn)n is increasing and (βn)n is decreasing. Hence the sequences (αn)n and
(βn)n converge pointwise respectively to functions u and v with u ⩽v. The author proves
in 1898 in case of ODE [83] and in 1900 for the PDE [84], that the convergence is uniform
and that the limit functions u and v satisfy
u′′ + f (t,v) = 0,
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0,
v′′ + f (t,u) = 0,
v(a) = 0, v(b) = 0.
Moreover the solution z of (4.32), which is unique under the given assumptions, is such
that
u ⩽z ⩽v.
At last, Picard provides in 1894 [81] (see also [82]) an example of a problem (4.32)
such that u ̸= v which shows that this second approximation scheme does not necessar-
ily converge to a solution of (4.32). This method is described in Proposition 4.12 and
Theorem 4.13 which come from [20].
Following Chaplygin [16], the Russian school studies the monotone iterative methods
extensively. In 1954, Babkin [9] considers the problem (4.32) under assumptions on f (t,u)
which imply the uniqueness of the solutions of (4.32). In his approach, he considers two
approximation sequences. Starting from lower and upper solutions α0 and β0 ⩾α0, these
approximations are obtained (for n ⩾1) as solutions of the linear problem
−α′′
n + Kαn = f (t,αn−1) + Kαn−1,
αn(a) = 0, αn(b) = 0,
−β′′
n + Kβn = f (t,βn−1) + Kβn−1,
βn(a) = 0, βn(b) = 0.
The main assumption to prove that the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n are monotone and con-
vergent is to choose K > 0 such that the function f (t,u)+Ku is increasing in u so that the
corresponding differential operator satisﬁes a maximum principle such as Proposition 4.5
(see [6] or [85]). The observation that the limits of the sequences (αn)n and (βn)n are
extremal solutions was noticed in 1962 by Courant and Hilbert [25].

C. De Coster and P. Habets
One important step is due to Kantorovich [59] in 1939. He observes that the ﬁrst ap-
proximation scheme, used for the Cauchy problem associated with ODE as well as for
other boundary value problem, has a common structure related to positive operators. He
then develops an abstract formulation of the method. In 1959, Collatz and Schröder [23]
give an abstract formulation of the second monotone approximation scheme. These two
abstract formulations have been uniﬁed in 1960 by Schröder [93] who shows that the sec-
ond scheme can be reduced to the ﬁrst one. Our ﬁrst section takes into account such an
abstract formulation.
The study of the monotone iterative methods for nonlinearities depending on the deriv-
ative was initiated in 1964 by Gendzhoyan [43] who considers the problem
u′′ + f (t,u,u′) = 0,
u(a) = 0, u(b) = 0.
Starting from lower and upper solutions α0 and β0 ⩾α0, he deﬁnes sequences of approxi-
mations (αn)n, (βn)n as solutions of
−α′′
n + l(t)α′
n + k(t)αn = f (t,αn−1,α′
n−1) + l(t)α′
n−1 + k(t)αn−1,
αn(a) = 0, αn(b) = 0,
−β′′
n + l(t)β′
n + k(t)βn = f (t,βn−1,β′
n−1) + l(t)β′
n−1 + k(t)βn−1,
βn(a) = 0, βn(b) = 0,
where k(t) and l(t) are functions related to the assumptions on f . Here also, the con-
vergence is monotone and gives approximations of the solution together with some error
bounds. Our Theorems 4.6 and 4.8 simplify considerably this approach. These can be found
in [21].
All the above-quoted papers consider the usual order α ⩽β for the lower and upper
solutions. The monotone iterative method was also developed in case lower and upper
solutions appear in the reversed order, i.e., α ⩾β. We can ﬁrst quote the paper of Omari
and Trombetta [75] in 1992. They consider problems such as
−u′′ + cu′ + f (t,u) = 0,
u(a) = u(b), u′(a) = u′(b).
The key assumptions are that the function f (t,u) −λu is nondecreasing in u for some
λ < 0 and that this λ is such that the operator −u′′ + cu′ + λu is inverse negative on the
space of periodic functions, i.e., that an antimaximum principle holds (see Proposition 4.9
[75]). Theorem 4.10 is a particular case of the results in [75]. The Neumann problem
was considered by Cabada and Sanchez [15]. We also refer to [14] for other results in
this direction. Recently Cherpion, De Coster and Habets [21] worked out an approach of
derivative dependent problems very much along the lines of Theorems 4.6 and 4.8. This
result is Theorem 4.11.

Preface
In this part of the book we deal with the half-linear second order differential equation

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ + c(t)Φ(x) = 0,
Φ(x) := |x|p−1 sgnx, p > 1,
(HL)
where r,c are continuous functions and r(t) > 0. The investigation of solutions of (HL)
has attracted considerable attention in the last two decades, and it was shown that solutions
of this equation behave in many aspects like those of the Sturm–Liouville equation

r(t)x′′ + c(t)x = 0
(SL)
which is the special case of (HL) when p = 2. The aim of this part is to present the substan-
tial results of this investigation. We show similarities in qualitative behavior of solutions
of (HL) and (SL), we also point out phenomena where properties of solutions of (HL)
and (SL) (considerably) differ. Note that the term half-linear equations is motivated by the
fact that the solution space of (HL) has just one half of the properties which characterize
linearity, namely homogeneity (but not additivity).
The investigation of qualitative properties of nonlinear second order differential equa-
tions has a long history. Recall here only the papers of Emden [95], Fowler [102], Thomas
[211], and the book of Sansone [206] containing the survey of the results achieved in the
ﬁrst half of the last century. In the ﬁfties and the later decades the number of papers devoted
to nonlinear second order differential equations increased rapidly, so we mention here only
treatments directly associated with (HL). Even if some ideas concerning the properties of
solutions of (HL) can already be found in the papers of Bihari [20,21], Elbert and Mirzov
with their papers [85,176]are the ones usually regarded as pioneers of the qualitative theory
of (HL). In later years, in particular in the nineties, the striking similarity between oscil-
latory properties of (HL) and (SL) was revealed. On the other hand, in some aspects, e.g.,
the Fredholm-type alternative for solutions of boundary value problems associated with
(HL), it turned out that the situation is completely different in the linear and half-linear
case, and that the absence of additivity of the solution space of (HL) brings completely
new phenomena.
This part of the book is divided into four chapters. In the ﬁrst one we present a brief
survey of the basic properties of solutions of (HL). A particular attention is devoted to
the existence, uniqueness, Sturmian theory and to some elementary half-linear differential
equations. Then we turn our attention to the oscillation theory of half-linear equations.
First we deal with nonoscillatory equations and nonoscillation criteria (Chapter 3B), and
in Chapter 3C we deal with their oscillation counterparts. We also present some related
165

166
Half-linear differential equations
results concerning asymptotic behavior of nonoscillatory solutions and properties of some
distinguished solutions of (HL). In the last chapter we deal with boundary value prob-
lems associated with (HL) (in this part of the qualitative theory of (HL) we can see the
biggest difference between linear and half-linear second order differential equations), and
with equations related to (HL), in particular, with partial differential equations with p-
Laplacian, quasilinear equations and half-linear difference equations.
Comparing our treatment of half-linear differential equations with Chapter 3C of the
recent book [3] (this chapter is devoted to the oscillation theory of (HL), there are some
common points, but the most part of our presentation differ from that of [3]. More precisely,
the treatment analogous to Sections 1.3, 1.4, 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 3.4 and the whole Chapter 3D
are missing in [3]. On the other hand, [3] devotes more space to particular (non)oscillation
criteria, to forced half-linear equations and to equations with deviated argument. Moreover,
the parts which overlap here and in [3] are presented from a different point of view.
I would like to thank Prof. Mariella Cecchi and Prof. Mauro Marini from the University
of Florence, who prepared the section devoted to the asymptotics of nonoscillatory solu-
tions of (HL) (Section 6), and to Assoc. Prof. Jaromír Kuben for his help with the LATEX
elaboration of the text. My special thanks belong to my colleague Dr. Pavel ˇRehák, who
read the whole text, for numerous helpful suggestions and comments to the ﬁnal version of
this text.

CHAPTER 3A
Basic Theory
In this chapter we deal with the basic properties of solutions of the half-linear second order
differential equation

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ + c(t)Φ(x) = 0,
Φ(x) := |x|p−1 sgnx, p > 1.
(0.1)
We suppose that the functions r,c are continuous and r(t) > 0 in the interval under consid-
eration. In the ﬁrst section we deal with the existence and the unique solvability of (0.1).
Then we present the basic oscillatory properties of (0.1), in particular, we show that the
linear Sturmian oscillation theory extends almost verbatim to half-linear equations. In Sec-
tion 3 we show basic differences between second order linear and half-linear equations.
The last section of this chapter deals with some special half-linear equations.
1. Existence and uniqueness
1.1. First order half-linear system
Consider the Sturm–Liouville linear differential equation

r(t)x′′ + c(t)x = 0
(1.1)
which is a special case p = 2 in (0.1). Then, given t0,x0,x1 ∈R, there exists the unique
solution of (1.1) satisfying the initial conditions x(t0) = x0, x′(t0) = x1, which is extensible
over the whole interval where the functions r,c are continuous and r(t) > 0. This follows,
e.g., from the fact that (1.1) can be written as the 2-dimensional ﬁrst order linear system
x′ =
1
r(t)u,
u′ = −c(t)x
and the linearity (hence Lipschitz property) of this system implies the above mentioned
statement concerning the existence and unique solvability of (1.1). On the other hand, if
we rewrite (0.1) into the ﬁrst order system (substituting u = rΦ(x′)), we get the system
x′ = r1−q(t)Φ−1(u),
u′ = −c(t)Φ(x),
(1.2)
where q is the conjugate number of p, i.e., 1
p + 1
q = 1, and Φ−1 is the inverse function
of Φ. The right hand-side of (1.2) is no longer Lipschitzian in x,u, hence the standard
167

168
Half-linear differential equations
existence and uniqueness theorems do not apply directly to this system. Moreover, it is
known that the so-called Emden–Fowler differential equation
x′′ + p(t)|x|α−2x = 0,
α > 1,
(1.3)
(which looks similarly to (0.1)) admits the so-called singular solutions (see Section 14.2
and, e.g., the books [127,178]), i.e., solutions which violate uniqueness and continuability
of solutions of (1.3).
1.2. Half-linear trigonometric functions
In proving the existence and uniqueness result for (0.1), the fundamental role is played
by the generalized Prüfer transformation introduced in [85]. Consider a special half-linear
equation of the form (0.1)

Φ(x′)
′ + (p −1)Φ(x) = 0
(1.4)
and denote by S = S(t) its solution given by the initial conditions S(0) = 0, S′(0) = 1.
We will show that the behavior of this solution is very similar to that of the classical sine
function. Multiplying (1.4) (with x replaced by S) by S′ and using the fact that (Φ(S′))′ =
(p −1)|S′|p−2S′′, we get the identity [|S′|p +|S|p]′ = 0. Substituting here t = 0 and using
the initial condition for S we have the generalized Pythagorian identity


S(t)


p +


S′(t)


p ≡1.
(1.5)
The function S is positive in some right neighborhood of t = 0 and using (1.5) S′ =

1−Sp = dt in this neighborhood, hence

(1.7)
The formula (1.6) deﬁnes uniquely the function S = S(t) on [0,πp/2] with S(πp/2) = 1
and hence by (1.5) S′(πp/2) = 0. Now we deﬁne the generalized sine function Sp on the
whole real line as the odd 2πp periodic continuation of the function
Sp(t) =

S(t),
0 ⩽t ⩽πp
2 ,
S(πp −t),
πp
2 ⩽t ⩽πp.
The function Sp reduces to the classical function sin in case p = 2 and in some literature
(e.g., [73]) this function is denoted by sinp t. We will skip the index p by Sp if no ambiguity
may occur.
In addition, we introduce the half-linear tangent and cotangent functions tanp and cotp
by
tanp t = Sp(t)
S′p(t),
cotp t =
S′
p(t)
Sp(t).
The function tanp is periodic with the period πp and has discontinuities at πp/2 + kπp,
k ∈Z. The function cotp is also πp periodic, with discontinuities at t = kπp, k ∈Z. By
(1.4) and (1.5) we have
(tanp t)′ =
1
|S′p(t)|p = 1 + |tanp t|p,
(1.8)
(cotp t)′ = −|cotp t|2−p
1 + |cotp t|p
.
Hence (tanp t)′ > 0, (cotp t)′ < 0 on their deﬁnition domains and there exists the inverse
functions arctanp, arccotp which are deﬁned as inverse functions of tanp and cotp in the
domains (−πp/2,πp/2) and (0,πp), respectively. From (1.8) we have
(arctanp t)′ =
1
1 + |t|p ,
1.3. Half-linear Prüfer transformation
Using the above deﬁned generalized trigonometric functions and their inverse functions,
we can introduce the generalized Prüfer transformation as follows. Let x be a nontrivial
solution of (0.1). Put
ρ(t) =
p

and let ϕ be a continuous function deﬁned at all points where x(t) ̸= 0 by the formula
ϕ(t) = arccotp
rq−1(t)x′(t)
x(t)
,
where q is the conjugate number of p, i.e., 1
p + 1
q = 1. Hence

rq−1(t)x′(t) = ρ(t)S′

(1.9)

r1−q(t)ρ(t)S′ϕ(t) = ρ′(t)Sϕ(t) + ρ(t)S′ϕ(t)ϕ′(t).
(1.10)
Similarly, applying the function Φ to both sides of the second equation in (1.9), differenti-

1.4. Existence and uniqueness
Since the right-hand side of the last system is Lipschitzian in ρ, ϕ, the initial value problem
for this system is uniquely solvable and its solution exists on the whole interval where r,c
are continuous and r(t) > 0. Hence, the same holds for (0.1). This statement is summarized
in the next theorem.
THEOREM 1.1. Suppose that the functions r,c are continuous in an interval I ⊆R and
r(t) > 0 for t ∈I. Given t0 ∈I and A,B ∈R, there exists a unique solution of (0.1)
satisfying x(t0) = A, x′(t0) = B which is extensible over the whole interval I. This solution
depends continuously on the initial values A,B.
REMARK 1.1. The half-linear Prüfer transformation and the resulting existence and
uniqueness theorem are presented in [85]. Another pioneering work in the theory of half-
linear equations is the paper of Mirzov [176]. In that paper, the ﬁrst order system
u′
1 = a1(t)|u2|λ1 sgnu2,
u′
2 = a2(t)|u1|λ2 sgnu1
(1.13)

Half-linear differential equations
171
is considered, where λ1,λ2 > 0 and λ1λ2 = 1. Comparing with (1.2), system (1.13) is
slightly more general since the function a1 (in contrast to the function r1−q in (1.2)) can
attain zero values. First, using Bellman’s lemma [17, p. 46], Mirzov proves that the trivial
solution (u1,u2) ≡(0,0) is the only solution satisfying the zero initial condition u1(t0) =
0 = u2(t0), and that under the assumption of local integrability of the functions a1,a2 every
solution of (1.13) is extensible over the whole interval where the integrability assumption
is satisﬁed. Then, under the assumption that the functions a1,a2 do not change their signs,
the Sturmian type theorem with respect to both components is proved using essentially the
same method as described in the next section.
2. Sturmian theory
In this section we establish the basic oscillatory properties of half-linear equation (0.1).
In particular, we show that the methods of the half-linear oscillation theory are similar
to those of the oscillation theory of Sturm–Liouville linear equations (1.1), and that the
Sturmian theory extends verbatim to (0.1).
2.1. Riccati equation
Let x be a solution of (0.1) such that x(t) ̸= 0 in an interval I. Then w(t) = r(t)Φ(x′(t))
Φ(x(t))
is a
solution of the Riccati-type differential equation
w′ + c(t) + (p −1)r1−q(t)|w|q = 0,
(2.1)
where q is the conjugate number of p, i.e., q =
p
p−1. Indeed, in view of (0.1) we have
w′ = (rΦ(x′))′Φ(x) −(p −1)rΦ(x′)|x|p−2x′
Φ2(x)
= −c −(p −1)r|x′|p
|x|p
= −c −(p −1)r1−q|w|q.
REMARK 2.1. (i) Using the above Riccati equation (2.1) one can derive the ﬁrst equation
in (1.12) as follows. From (1.9) we have
w = r(t)Φ(x′(t))
Φ(x(t))
= Φ(S′(ϕ(t))
Φ(S(ϕ(t)) =: v

ϕ(t)

.
The function v = Φ(S′)/Φ(S) satisﬁes the Riccati equation corresponding to (1.4). This

Multiplying this equation by |S(ϕ(t))|p and using (1.5) we get really the ﬁrst equation in
(1.12).
(ii) Sometimes it is convenient to use a more general Riccati substitution
v(t) = f (t)r(t)Φ(x′(t))
Φ(x(t))
,
where f is a differentiable function. By a direct computation one can verify that v satisﬁes
the ﬁrst order Riccati-type equation
v′ −f ′(t)
f (t) v + f (t)c(t) + (p −1)r1−q(t)f 1−q(t)|v|q = 0.
(2.2)
The application of this more general Riccati substitution in the oscillation theory of (0.1)
will be shown in Chapter 3C.
(iii) If we consider a slightly more general half-linear equation
r(t)Φ(x′)′ + b(t)Φ(x′) + c(t)Φ(x) = 0,
(2.3)
the Riccati substitution w = rΦ(x′)/Φ(x) leads to the equation
w′ + c(t) + b(t)
r(t) w + (p −1)r1−q(t)|w|q = 0.
(2.4)
Multiplying this equation by exp{ t b(s)
r(s) ds} =: g(t) and denoting v = gw, Equation (2.4)
can be written in the same form as (2.1)
v′ + c(t)g(t) + (p −1)r1−q(t)g1−q(t)|v|q = 0.
The same effect we achieve if we multiply the original equation (2.3) by g since then this
equation can be again written in the form (0.1).
2.2. Picone’s identity
The original Picone’s identity [190] for the linear second order equation (1.1) was estab-
lished in 1910. Since that time, this identity has been extended in various directions and
the half-linear version of this identity (proved in [115]) reads as follows.

In the particular case when r = R, C = c, y is a nonzero solution of the equation
L(y) = 0 and w = RΦ(y′)/Φ(y), then (2.5) reduces to the identity

a certain quadratic function.

2.4. Roundabout theorem
This theorem relates Riccati equation (2.1), the energy functional (2.11) and the basic oscil-
latory properties of solutions of (0.1). The terminology Roundabout theorem is motivated

Half-linear differential equations
175
by the fact that the proof of this theorem consists of the “roundabout” proof of several
equivalent statements.
Equation (0.1) is said to be disconjugate on the closed interval [a,b] if the solution x
given by the initial condition x(a) = 0, r(a)Φ(x′(a)) = 1 has no zero in (a,b], in the
opposite case (0.1) is said to be conjugate on [a,b].
THEOREM 2.2. The following statements are equivalent.
(i) Equation (0.1) is disconjugate on the interval I = [a,b]. (0.1) has at most one.
(ii) There exists a solution of (0.1) having no zero in [a,b].
(iii) There exists a solution w of the generalized Riccati equation (2.1) which is deﬁned
on the whole interval [a,b].
(iv) The energy functional F(y;a,b) is positive for every 0 ̸≡y ∈W1,p
0
(a,b).
PROOF. (i) ⇒(ii): Consider the solution ˜x of (0.1) given by the initial condition ˜x(a) = ε,
r(a)Φ(˜x′(a)) = 1, where ε > 0 is sufﬁciently small. Then, according to the continuous
dependence of solutions of (0.1) on the initial condition, disconjugacy of (0.1) on [a,b]
implies that this solution is positive on this interval.
(ii) ⇒(iii): This implication is the immediate consequence of the Riccati substitution
from Section 2.1.
(iii) ⇒(iv): If there exists a solution w of (2.1) deﬁned in the whole interval [a,b], then
by integrating the reduced Picone identity (2.7) with x ∈W 1,p
0
(a,b) we get

since x(a) = 0. This means that F(x;a,b) ⩾0 over W 1,p

x(t) ≡0.
(iv) ⇒(i): Suppose that F > 0 over nontrivial y ∈W 1,p

(a,b) and (0.1) is not dis-
conjugate in [a,b], i.e., the solution x of (0.1) given by the initial condition x(a) = 0,
r(a)Φ(x′(a)) = 1 has a zero c ∈[a,b]. Deﬁne the function y ∈W 1,p
0
(a,b) as follows
y(t) =
x(t),
t ∈[a,c],
0,
t ∈[c,b].
Then by (2.12)
F(y;a,b) = F(y;a,c) = F(x;a,c) = 0
which contradicts the positivity of F.
□

176
Half-linear differential equations
REMARK 2.2. Similarly to the linear case, two points t1,t2 ∈R are said to be conjugate
relative to (0.1) if there exists a nontrivial solution x of this equation such that x(t1) =
0 = x(t2). Due to Theorem 2.2, disconjugacy and conjugacy of (0.1) on a bounded interval
I ⊂R can be equivalently deﬁned as follows. Equation (0.1) is said to be disconjugate
on an interval I if this interval contains no pair of points conjugate relative to (0.1) (i.e.,
every nontrivial solution has at most one zero in I), in the opposite case (0.1) is said to
be conjugate on I (i.e., there exists a nontrivial solution with at least two zeros in I).
In Section 7 we will show that using the concept of the principal solution of (0.1), this
equivalent deﬁnition applies also to unbounded intervals.
2.5. Sturmian separation and comparison theorems
The Roundabout theorem shows that the linear Sturmian theorems extend verbatim to half-
linear equation (0.1). Indeed, the following theorem follows from the equivalence of (i) and
(ii) in Theorem 2.2. We will prove it by using an alternative method.
THEOREM 2.3. Let t1 < t2 be two consecutive zeros of a nontrivial solution x of (0.1).
Then any other solution of this equation which is not proportional to x has exactly one
zero on (t1,t2).
PROOF. Among several possible methods of the proof we choose that one based on the
Riccati substitution and the resulting equation (2.1). Let w = rΦ(x′)/Φ(x), then w is a
solution of (2.1) which is deﬁned on (t1,t2) and satisﬁes w(t1+) = ∞, w(t2−) = −∞.
Suppose that there exists a solution ˜x of (0.1), linearly independent of x, which has no
zero in (t1,t2) and let ˜w = rΦ(˜x′/˜x). Since ˜x(t1) ̸= 0, ˜x(t2) ̸= 0 (otherwise ˜x would be a
multiple of x), we have ˜w(t1) < ∞, ˜w(t2) > −∞. Hence the graph of ˜w has to intersect
the graph of w at some point in (t1,t2), but this contradicts the unique solvability of (2.1)
(which follows from the fact that the function c + (p −1)r1−q|w|q is Lipschitzian with
respect to w).
□
The Sturmian separation theorem also justiﬁes the following deﬁnition of oscillation
and nonoscillation of (0.1) which is the same as in the linear case. Equation (0.1) is said
to be nonoscillatory (more precisely, nonoscillatory at ∞), if there exists T0 ∈R such that
(0.1) is disconjugate on [T0,T1] for every T1 > T0, in the opposite case (0.1) is said to be
oscillatory.
According to Theorem 2.3, the above deﬁnition is correct, in the sense that oscillation
of (0.1) means oscillation of its every nontrivial solution (i.e., the existence of a sequence
of zeros of this solution tending to ∞). Note also that similarly to the linear case, if the
functions r,c are continuous and r(t) > 0 in an interval [T,∞), then according to the
unique solvability of the initial value problem associated with (0.1), the sequence of zeros
of any nontrivial solution of (0.1) cannot a have a ﬁnite cluster point.
Along with (0.1) consider another equation of the same form

R(t)Φ(y′)
′ + C(t)Φ(y) = 0,
(2.13)
where the functions R,C satisfy the same assumptions as r,c, respectively, in (0.1).
The next statement is an extension of well-known Sturm comparison theorem to (0.1).

Half-linear differential equations
177
THEOREM 2.4. Let t1 < t2 be consecutive zeros of a nontrivial solution x of (0.1) and
suppose that
C(t) ⩾c(t),
r(t) ⩾R(t) > 0
(2.14)
for t ∈[t1,t2]. Then any solution of (2.13) has a zero in (t1,t2) or it is a multiple of the
solution x. The last possibility is excluded if one of the inequalities in (2.14) is strict on a
set of positive measure.
PROOF. Let x be a solution of (0.1) having zeros at t = t1 and t = t2. Then by (2.12) we
have F(x;t1,t2) = 0 and according to (2.14)
FRC(x;t1,t2) :=
 t2
t1

R(t)|x′|p −C(t)|x|p
dt ⩽0.
(2.15)
This implies, by Theorem 2.2, that the solution y of (2.13) given by the initial condi-
tion y(t1) = 0, y′(t1) > 0 has a zero in (t1,t2] and by Theorem 2.3 any linearly inde-
pendent solution of (2.13) has a zero in (t1,t2). Finally, suppose that the ﬁrst zero of y
to the right of t1 is just at t2, i.e., y(t1) = 0 = y(t2). Let v = RΦ(y′)/Φ(y) be the so-
lution of the Riccati equation associated with (2.13). Then, since limt→t1+[x(t)/y(t)] =
limt→t1+[x′(t)/y′(t)] = x′(t1)/y′(t1) exists ﬁnite, we have

Similarly limt→t2−v(t)|x(t)|p = 0. This implies FRC(x;t1,t2) ⩾0 (in view of (2.7) with
R,C,v instead of r,c,w respectively), but this contradicts to (2.15) since FRC(x;t1,t2) <
0 if one of inequalities in (2.14) is strict on an interval of positive length.
□
We will employ the same terminology as in the linear case. If (2.14) are satisﬁed in a
given interval I, then (2.13) is said to be the majorant equation of (0.1) on I and (0.1) is
said to be the minorant equation of (2.13) on I.
2.6. Transformation of independent variable
Let us introduce the new independent variable s = ϕ(t) and the new function y(s) = x(t),
where ϕ is a differentiable function such that ϕ′(t) ̸= 0 in some interval I where we con-
sider Equation (0.1). Then d
dt = ϕ′(t) d
ds and hence this transformation transforms (0.1) into
the equation of the same form

where ϕ−1 is the inverse function of ϕ. In particular, if
ϕ(t) =
 t
T
r1−q(τ)dτ,
T ∈I,
(2.17)
then the resulting equation (2.16) is the equation of the form (0.1) with r(t) ≡1.
Observe that if
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, then (2.17) transforms an unbounded interval
[T,∞) into the interval [0,∞) which is of the same form as [T,∞). If  ∞r1−q(t)dt < ∞
then the interval [T,∞) is transformed into the bounded interval [0,b), b =
 ∞
T r1−q(t)dt.
This fact, coupled with the remark about cluster points of an oscillatory solution of (0.1)
given below Theorem 2.3, shows why some (non)oscillation criteria and asymptotic for-
mulas for solutions of (0.1) substantially depend on the divergence (convergence) of
 ∞r1−q(t)dt.
2.7. Reciprocity principle
Suppose that the function c in (0.1) does not change its sign in an interval I and let u =
rΦ(x′). Then by a simple computation one can verify that u is a solution of the so-called
reciprocal equation

c1−q(t)Φ−1(u′)
′ + r1−q(t)Φ−1(u) = 0,
(2.18)
where Φ−1(s) = |s|q−1 sgns, q =
p
p−1, is the inverse function of Φ. The terminology
reciprocal equation is motivated by the linear case p = 2. The reciprocal equation to (2.18)
is again the original equation (0.1)
If t1 < t2 are consecutive zeros of a solution x of (0.1), then by the Rolle mean value
theorem u has at least one zero in (t1,t2). Conversely, if ˜t1 < ˜t2 are consecutive zeros of u,
then u′ = −c(t)x and hence also x has a zero in (t1,t2). This means that (0.1) is oscillatory
if and only if the reciprocal equation (2.18) is oscillatory. This fact we will refer to as the
reciprocity principle.
2.8. Leighton–Wintner oscillation criterion
In this section we formulate a simple oscillation criterion for (0.1). Even if we will devote a
special chapter to oscillation criteria for (0.1), we prefer to formulate this criterion already
here. In the linear case p = 2, this criterion was proved ﬁrst by Leighton [146] under the
addition assumption c(t) ⩾0. This restriction was later removed by Wintner, see, e.g.,
[208].

PROOF. According to the deﬁnition of oscillation of (0.1), we need to show that this equa-
tion is not disconjugate on any interval of the form [T,∞). To illustrate typical methods
of the half-linear oscillation theory, we present here two different proofs.
(i) Variational proof. We will ﬁnd, for every T ∈R, a nontrivial function y ∈

(T,∞) such that
F(y;T,∞) =

The function which satisﬁes (2.20) can be constructed as follows
y(t) =

where T < t0 < t1 < t2 < t3 will be speciﬁed later. Denote
K := F(y;t0,t1) =
 t1

r(t)|y′|p −c(t)|y|pdt.
Then by a direct computation we have

Since the function g(t) =
 t3
t r1−q(s)ds(
 t3
t2 r1−q(s)ds)−1 is monotonically decreasing on
[t2,t3] with g(t2) = 1 and g(t3) = 0, by the second mean value theorem of integral calculus
there exists ξ ∈(t2,t3) such that
 t3
t2
c(t)gp(t)dt =
 ξ

c(t)dt.
Using this equality, we have
F(y;t0,t3) = K −

Let ε > 0 and t1 > t0 be arbitrary. The second condition in (2.19) implies that t2 can be cho-
sen in such a way that  ξ
t1 c(t)dt > K +ε and the ﬁrst condition in (2.19) implies that t3 > t2
can be taken such that ( t3
t2 r1−q(t)dt)−1 < ε. Summarizing these estimates, we have
F(y;t0,t3) ⩽K −(K + ε) + ε ⩽0,
hence (0.1) is oscillatory by Theorem 2.2.

180
Half-linear differential equations
(ii) Proof by the Riccati technique. Suppose, by contradiction, that (2.19) holds and (0.1)
is nonoscillatory. Then there exists T ∈R and a solution w of Riccati equation (2.1) which
is deﬁned in the whole interval [T,∞). By integrating (2.1) from T to t we get
w(t) = w(T ) −

The second condition in (2.19) implies the existence of T1 > T such that we have w(T ) −

Denote G(t) =

G′(t)
Gq(t) ⩾(p −1)qr1−q(t).
By integrating this inequality from T1 to t we get

Letting t →∞we have a contradiction with the ﬁrst condition in (2.19).

3. Differences between linear and half-linear equations
The basic difference between linear and half-linear equations has already been mentioned
at the beginning of this chapter, it the fact that the solution space of (0.1) is only homo-
geneous but not additive. In this subsection we point out some other differences (some of
them are more or less consequences of this lack of the additivity of the solution space).
3.1. Wronskian identity
If x1,x2 are two solutions of the linear Sturm–Liouville differential equation (1.1), then
by a direct differentiation one can verify the so-called Wronskian identity
r(t)

x1(t)x′
2(t) −x′
1(t)x2(t)

≡ω,
(3.1)
where ω is a real constant. We have no half-linear version of this identity. More pre-
cisely, the above identity (3.1) can be regarded as an identity W(x1,x′
1,x2,x′
2) := r(x′
1x2 −
x1x′
2) = ω along solutions x1,x2 of (1.1). Elbert [86] showed that for p ̸= 2 there exists no
function of 4 variables W(x1,x2,x3,x4) which is constant along solutions of (0.1), with
the properties:

Half-linear differential equations
181
(i) W is continuously differentiable with respect to each variable.
(ii) W is not identically constant on R4.
(iii) W has antisymmetry property W(x3,x4,x1,x2) = −W(x1,x2,x3,x4).
This result was proved using the generalized Prüfer transformation, we refer to [86] for
details. The absence of a Wronskian-type identity implies that we have also no analogue
of the linear reduction of order formula: given a solution ˜x of (1.1) with ˜x(t) ̸= 0 in an
interval I, then
x(t) = ˜x(t)
 t
ds
r(s)˜x2(s)
is another solution of (1.1)
3.2. Transformation formula
Let h(t) ̸= 0 be a differentiable function such that rh′ is also differentiable and let us
introduce a new dependent variable y which is related to the original variable x by the
formula x = h(t)y. Then we have the following (linear) identity which is the basis of the
linear transformation theory (see [5,32,183])
h(t)

r(t)x′′ + c(t)x

=

r(t)h2(t)y′′ + h(t)

r(t)h′(t)
′ + c(t)h(t)

y.
(3.2)
In particular, if x a solution of (1.1) then y is a solution of

R(t)y′′ + C(t)y = 0
with R = rh2 and C = h[(rh′)′ + ch]. Since the function Φ is not additive, we have
no half-linear analogue of this transformation identity. This has the following important
consequence. Many oscillation results for linear equation (1.1) are based on the so-called
trigonometric transformation which reads as follows. Let x1,x2 be two (linearly indepen-
dent) solutions of (1.1) such that r(x1x′
2 −x′
1x2) = 1 and let h =

x2
1 + x2
2. Then we have
the identity (which can be veriﬁed by a direct computation)
h(rh′)′ + ch = 1
rh2 .
This means that the transformation x = h(t)y transforms (1.1) into the equation
 1
q(t)y′
′
+ q(t)y = 0,
q(t) =
1
r(t)h2(t).
(3.3)

182
Half-linear differential equations
Equation (3.3) can be solved explicitly and y1 = sin(
 t q(s)ds), y2 = cos(
 t q(s)ds) are
its linearly independent solutions, in particular, (3.3) and hence also (1.1) is oscillatory if
and only if
 ∞
dt
r(t)[x2
1(t) + x2
2(t)] = ∞
for any pair of linearly independent solutions x1,x2 of (1.1). This fact is used in proofs
of many oscillation results for (1.1), see [192,208] and references given therein. Since
half-linear version of the transformation formula (3.2) is missing, analogous results for
half-linear equation (0.1) are not known.
3.3. Fredholm alternative
Consider the linear Dirichlet boundary value problem associated with (1.1)

r(t)x′′ + c(t)x = f (t),
t ∈[a,b]
x(a) = 0 = x(b).
(3.4)
It is well known that if the homogeneous problem with f (t) ≡0 has only the trivial solu-
tion, then (3.4) has a solution for any (sufﬁciently regular) right-hand side f (the so-called
nonresonant case). If the homogeneous problem has a solution ϕ0, problem (3.4) has a
solution if and only if
 b
a
f (t)ϕ0(t)dt = 0.
In particular, the problem
x′′ + x = f (t),
x(0) = 0 = x(π),
(3.5)
has a solution if and only if
 π
0 f (t)sin t dt = 0.
Now consider the half-linear version of the boundary value problem (3.5)
Φ(x′)′ + (p −1)Φ(x) = f (t),
t ∈[a,b],
x(0) = 0 = x(πp),
(3.6)
where the generalized πp is given by (1.7). A natural question is whether
 πp
0
f (t)sinp t dt = 0
(3.7)
is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for solvability of (3.6). This problem attracted con-
siderable attention in last years, see [73] and the references given therein. It was shown
that (3.7) is sufﬁcient but no longer necessary for solvability of (3.6). We will deal with
this problem in more details in the last chapter.

4. Some elementary half-linear equations
In this section we focus our attention to half-linear equations with constant coefﬁcients
and to Euler-type half-linear equation. The results presented here are essentially contained
in the paper of Elbert [88]. This Elbert’s paper deals with system (1.2) (with constant
coefﬁcients or coefﬁcients corresponding to the generalized Euler equation), but results
can be easily reformulated to equations of the form (0.1).
4.1. Equations with constant coefﬁcients
Before passing to half-linear equations with constant coefﬁcients, consider the equation
r(t)Φ(x′)′ = 0.
(4.1)
The situation is here the same as in case of linear equations. The solution space of this
equation is a two-dimensional linear space and the basis of this space is formed by the
functions x1(t) ≡1, x2(t) =
 t r1−q(s)ds, where q =
p
p−1 is the conjugate number of p.
Now, consider Equation (0.1) with r(t) ≡r > 0 and c(t) ≡c. This equation can be
written in the form
Φ(x′)′ + c
r Φ(x) = 0
(4.2)
and the transformation of independent variable t 
→λt with λ = (
|c|
r(p−1))1/p transforms
(4.2) into the equation

Φ(x′)
′ + (p −1)sgncΦ(x) = 0
If c > 0, this equation already appeared in Section 1.3 as Equation (1.4). Its solution given
(uniquely) by the initial condition x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 1 was denoted by S = S(t) (or by
sinp t) and it is called the half-linear sine function. The function C(t) = S′(t) is called
the the half-linear cosine function. Consequently, taking into account homogeneity of the
solution space of (0.1), we have the following statement concerning solvability of (1.4).
THEOREM 4.1. For any t0 ∈R, x0,x1 ∈R, the unique solution of (1.4) satisfying x(t0) =
x0, x′(t0) = x1 is of the form x(t) = αS(t −t1), where α,t1 are real constants depending
on t0,x0,x1.
Now let c < 0, i.e., we consider the equation

Φ(x′)
′ −(p −1)Φ(x) = 0.
(4.3)
Multiplying this equation by x′ and integrating the obtained equation over [0,t] we have
the identity


x′(t)


p −


x(t)


p =


x′(0)


p −


x(0)


p = C,
(4.4)

184
Half-linear differential equations
where C is a real constant. If C = 0 then x′ = ±x thus x1 = et and x2 = e−t are solutions
of (4.3).
In the remaining part of this subsection we focus our attention to the generalized half-
linear hyperbolic sine and cosine functions. In the linear case p = 2, these functions are
linear combinations of et and e−t. However, in the half-linear case the additivity of the
solution space of (0.1) is lost and one has to use a more complicated method. Let E = Ep(t)
be the solution of (4.3) with the initial conditions E(0) = 0,E′(0) = 1, and similarly let
F = Fp(t) be the solution given by the initial conditions F(0) = 1,F ′(0) = 0. Let us also
observe that the function E corresponds to C = 1 and F to C = −1 in (4.4), respectively.
Moreover, for p = 2, i.e., if differential equation (4.3) is linear, we have E2(t) = sinht and
F2(t) = cosht.
Due to (4.4), the function E satisﬁes also the relation
E′ =
p
1 + |E|p,
hence E′ > 1 for t > 0. Consequently
t =
 t
0
E′(s)ds
p√1 + Ep(s) =
 E(t)
0
ds
p√
1 + sp .
(4.5)
In order to compare (asymptotically) the function E(t) with et, let the function f (s) be
deﬁned by
f (s) =
1
for 0 ≦s ≦1,
1
s
for s ≧1.
Then by (4.5) we obtain
t −lgE(t) = 1 +

(4.6)
The integral in the right-hand side of (4.6) can be interpreted as the area of the domain on
the (s,y) plane given by the inequalities
1
p√
1 + sp ⩽y ⩽f (s)
for 0 ⩽s < ∞.

Since 0 < 1 −
p√1 −yp < y for 0 < y < 1 we have 0 < lgδp < 1, i.e., 1 < δp < e. On
the other hand, the integral in (4.7) can be expressed by means of the function Ψ (z) =

(4.8)
Finally, the relation (4.6) can be rewritten as
lim
t→∞
et
Ep(t) = δp
where 1 < δp < e.
(4.9)
A similar relation is expected also for the function Fp(t). We will use the following
auxiliary statement which we present without the proof, this proof can be found in [85].
LEMMA 4.1. Let I1(R), I2(R) be integrals deﬁned by
I1(R) =
 R

R > 0,
I2(R) =

R > 1.
Then
lim
R→∞

I1(R) −I2(R)


p .
Now we return to the asymptotic formula for Fp. We want to obtain a relation similar to
(4.9). Since F fulﬁlls the differential equation
|F ′|p −|F|p = −1,
we have
F ′
p√
F p −1
= 1
for t > 0.
Integrating the last equality yields
 F(t)

p√ξp −1 = t
for t > 0.

(4.11)
It is clear that Δp > 1. The relation (4.10) can be rewritten as
lim
t→∞
et
Fp(t) = Δp
with Δp > 1.
(4.12)
Now we want to establish a connection between Δp and δp. By (4.6), (4.10), and taking
into account the deﬁnition of the function f (ξ), we have
lg Δp

where the functions I1(R),I2(R) were introduced in Lemma 4.1. Then by this lemma we
get the wanted relation as
lg δp
Δp
= π
p cot π
p .
(4.13)
We may observe here that this relation implies that δ2 = Δ2 in the linear case (p = 2).
In fact, we have δ2 = 2 = Δ2.
By (4.8) the value of δp can be considered to be known, consequently by the relation
(4.13) the value of Δp is known as well.
Finally, there are interesting functional relations between the half-linear hyperbolic sine
and cosine functions Ep(t),Fp(t) as follows
E′
p(t) = Fq
(p −1)tq−1 = Φ−1Fq
(p −1)t,
F ′
p(t) = Φ−1
Eq

(p −1)t

.
(4.14)
To prove these relations it is sufﬁcient to show that the functions on both sides of the
equalities satisfy the same differential equation and fulﬁll the same initial conditions, this
is a matter of a direct computation (use, e.g., the result of Section 2.7).

Half-linear differential equations
187
The relations (4.14) provide another connections between the values of δp and Δp. In-
deed, by (4.4) and (4.9) we have
lim
t→∞
E′
p(t)
et
= lim
t→∞
Ep(t)
et
= 1
δp
.
(4.15)
On the other hand, this, (4.12) and (4.14) imply (taking into account that (p−1)(q −1) = 1
for conjugate pair p,q)
1
δp−1
p

hence
Δq = δp−1
p
,
(4.16)
and similarly
δq = Δp−1
p
.
(4.17)
We remark that the last two relations are equivalent since replacing p by q we get each
from the other. By relations (4.13), (4.16) (or (4.17)) it is sufﬁcient to know one of the
values of Δp,δp,Δq,δq, and then all the other values can be obtained easily.
As in the linear case where the function sinh t is odd and the function cosht is even, the
functions Ep(t),Fp(t) behave in a similar way:
Ep(−t) = −Ep(t),
Fp(−t) = Fp(t).
(4.18)
To prove this statement it is sufﬁcient to show that the functions on the both side of the
equality are solutions of differential equation (4.3) and satisfy the same initial conditions
at t = 0. Then the uniqueness of the initial value problem (see Section 1.4) proves (4.18).
Now we know all the solutions of differential equations (4.3). We display them in the
next theorem.
THEOREM 4.2. The solutions of (4.3) are:
Ket,
Ke−t,
KEp(t + t0),
KFp(t + t0),
(4.19)
where K and t0 are real parameters. More precisely, there are two one-parameter fami-
lies of solutions x(t) = Ket, x(t) = Ke−t and two two-parameter families satisfying the
following asymptotic formula
lim
t→∞
x(t)

= L,
where L = Ket0

or L = Ket0
Δp with K from (4.19).

PROOF. Since Equation (4.3) is autonomous, it is sufﬁcient to consider solutions whose
initial values are prescribed at t = 0, i.e., x(0) = x0, x′(0) = x1. If x0 = 0 = x1, then ac-
cording to the unique solvability x(t) ≡0. If at least one of the constants x0, x1 is nonzero,
distinguish the cases according to the value of the constant C in (4.4). In case C = 0,
the only possibilities are x(t) = Ket or x(t) = Ke−t. More precisely, if x0x1 > 0, then
x(t) = x0et, if x0x1 < 0, then x(t) = x0e−t. Now, if C > 0, then by the deﬁnition of the
function Ep we have x(t) = KEp(t + t0). Let K = sgnx0
p√
C. Since the function Ep is
strictly increasing (observe that E′(0) = 1, E′ is continuous and |E′|p = 1 + |E|p) there
exists t0 ∈R such that CEp(t0) = x1. Concerning the initial condition for the derivative x′,
we have
|x1|p = C + |x0|p = C + C|E|p = C1 + |E|p = C|E′|p,
hence x1 = ±KE′(t0). But E′(t0) > 0 and sgnK = sgnx1, the sign + is the correct one.
If C < 0, let K = sgnx0
p√−C and t0 be the solution of CF ′(t0) = x1. Then the function
KFp(t + t0) is the solution we looked for.
Finally, concerning the asymptotic formula, any solution which is not proportional to et
or e−t satisﬁes by (4.9) or (4.12)

4.2. Euler-type half-linear differential equation
In this subsection we deal with the Euler-type differential equation

Φ(x′)
′ + γ
tp Φ(x) = 0,
(4.20)
where γ is a real constant. By the analogue with the linear Euler equation we look ﬁrst for
solutions in the form x(t) = tλ. Substituting into (4.20) we get the algebraic equation for λ
G(λ) := (p −1)|λ|p −(p −1)Φ(λ) + γ = 0.
The function G is convex, hence the equation G(λ) = 0 has two, one or no (real) root ac-
cording to the value of γ . However, even if the ﬁrst possibility happens, since the additivity
of the solution space of is lost in the half-linear case, we are not able to compute other so-
lutions explicitly. To get a more detailed information about their asymptotic behavior, we
use the procedure which is also typical in the linear case, namely the transformation of
(4.20) into an equation with constant coefﬁcients.
The change of independent variable s = lgt converts (4.20) into the equation (where the
dependent variable will be denoted again by x and ′ = d
ds )

Half-linear differential equations

The Riccati equation corresponding to (4.20) and (4.21) are
w′ = −γ t−p −(p −1)|w|p
(4.22)
and
v′ = −γ + (p −1)v −(p −1)|v|q =: F(v),
(4.23)
respectively. The solutions w and v are related by the formula w(t) = t1−pv(lg t) and,
moreover, we have G(Φ−1(v)) = −F(v).
The function F is concave on R with the global maximum at ˜v = ( p−1
p )p−1 and the
value of this maximum is ˜γ = ( p−1
p )p −γ . We distinguish the following 3 cases with
respect to the value of the constant γ .
(I) γ < ˜γ . Then the equation F(v) = 0 has two real roots v1 < ˜v < v2;
(II) γ = ˜γ . Then the equation F(v) = 0 has the double root v = ˜v;
(III) γ > ˜γ . Then F(v) < 0 for every v ∈R.
Case (I). The constant functions v(s) ≡v1, v(s) ≡v2 are solutions of (4.23). Clearly, if v
is a solution of (4.23) such that v(s) < v1, for some s ∈R, then v′(s) < 0, if v(s) ∈(v1,v2),
then v′(s) > 0, and v′(s) < 0 for v(s) > v2, a picture of the direction ﬁeld of (4.23) helps to
visualize the situation. Any solution of (4.23) different from v(s) = v1,2 can be expressed
(implicitly) in the form (S ∈R being ﬁxed)
 v(s)

F(v) = s −S.

Observe that the integral

F(v) > −∞.
Case (Ia). v(S) < v1; then v(s) < v(S) for s > S and v is decreasing. If v were extensible
up to ∞, we would have a contradiction with (4.24) since the right-hand side tends to ∞
while the left one is bounded. Later we will show that v(s) = v1 is the so-called eventually
minimal solution of (4.23).
Case (Ib). v(S) ∈(v1,v2); the solution v is increasing in this case, and as s →∞, we
have v(s) →v2, otherwise we have the same contradiction as in the previous case.
Next we compute the asymptotic formula for the difference v2 −v(s). We have
F(v) = F ′(v2)(v −v2) + O

where K is a positive constant (depending on v(S)), and substituting w(t) = t1−pv(lg t)
we have

(4.25)
since F ′(v2) < 0. Substituting w = Φ(x′)

Case (Ic). v(S) > v2; then v′(s) < 0 and v(s) ∈(v2,v(S)) for s > S. Using the same
argument as in (Ib) we have

Case (II). γ = ˜γ = ( p−1

p )p−1.
Equation (4.20) has a solution x(t) = tΦ−1(˜v) = t

still nonoscillatory. In the linear case p = 2, ˜γ = 1
4 and we are able to compute a linearly
independent solution using the reduction of order formula. This solution is ˜x(t) = √t lgt.
The reduction of order formula is missing in the half-linear case, but using essentially the
same method as in Case (I) we are able to show that all solutions which are not proportional
to t

To this end, we proceed as follows. Since F(˜v) = 0 = F ′(˜v),
F(v) = 1

(v −˜v)−1
as v →˜v.
On the other hand, using the same argument as in the previous part, we see from (4.24) that
any solution v which starts with the initial value v(S) < ˜v fails to be extensible up to ∞
and solutions with v(S) > ˜v tend to ˜v as t →∞. Substituting for F(v) in (4.24) we have
2˜v
v −˜v + Olg|v −˜v| = s −S,
hence
2˜v + (v −˜v)Olg |v −˜v| = (v −˜v)(s −S).
Since limv→˜v(v −˜v)O(lg|v −˜v|) = 0, we have
lim

v(s) −˜v

Case (III). The equation F(v) = 0 has no real root and F(v) < 0 for every v ∈R. Again
 v(s)

F(v) = s −S,
and
v(s) < v(S)
for s > S.
Since the left-hand side of the last equality is bounded for any value v(s), while the right
one tends to ∞as s →∞, no solution of (4.23) and hence also of (4.22) is extensible up
to ∞, which means that (4.20) is oscillatory. We will show that oscillatory solutions of
(4.21) are periodic and we will determine the value of their period.
To this end, we use the Prüfer transformation mentioned in Section 1 (compare also
Remark 1.1 applied to (4.21)). Any nontrivial solution of this equation can be expressed in
the form

(4.34)
This equation has a real root if and only if γ ⩽˜γα := ( |p−1−α|

α ̸= p −1 is nonoscillatory if γ ⩽˜γα. If γ > ˜γα, using the same ideas as in case α = 0
treated in main part of this section one can see that (4.33) is oscillatory.

the next theorem.

(4.38)
then (4.37) is nonoscillatory.
PROOF. If (4.36) holds, then c(t) > ˜γ +ε

for some ε > 0 and since the Euler equation
(4.20) with γ = ˜γ + ε is oscillatory, (4.37) is also oscillatory by the Sturm comparison
theorem (Theorem 2.4). The nonoscillatory part of theorem can be proved using the same
argument.
□
REMARK 4.2. Using the results of Theorem 4.4 and the Sturm comparison theorem, one
can prove various extensions of the previous theorem. For example, if α ̸= p −1,
liminf

limsup
t→∞
tα−pc(t) < ˜γα
then (0.1) is nonoscillatory. An oscillation counterpart of this result, as well as the criteria
in case α = p −1 can be formulated in a similar way.

CHAPTER 3B
Nonoscillatory Equations
In this chapter we concentrate our attention to nonoscillatory half-linear differential equa-
tions while oscillatory equations is the main concern of Chapter 3C. However, we for-
mulate some oscillation criteria already here, mainly in situations when they are natural
complements of their nonoscillation counterparts. First we present nonoscillation criteria
for (0.1) which are based on the Riccati technique and the variational principle. Section 6
is devoted to the investigation of asymptotic properties of nonoscillatory solutions of (0.1).
Then we deal with the important concept of the principal solution of nonoscillatory equa-
tion (0.1) and the last section of this chapter presents criteria for conjugacy and disconju-
gacy of (0.1) in a given interval.
Recall that (0.1) is said to be nonoscillatory if there exists T ∈R such that (0.1) is
disconjugate on [T,∞), i.e., every nontrivial solution of this equation has at most one
zero in this interval and this means that every nontrivial solution is eventually positive
or negative. Equation (0.1) is said to be oscillatory in the opposite case, i.e., when every
nontrivial solution has inﬁnitely many zeros tending to ∞.
Note that from Theorem 2.2 or from Theorem 2.3 follows that this classiﬁcation of half-
linear equations is correct; all solution of (0.1) are either oscillatory or nonoscillatory.
5. Nonoscillation criteria
From the Roundabout theorem (Theorem 2.2) and also from the Sturmian comparison
theorem (Theorem 2.4) it is easy to see that for nonoscillation of (0.1), the function c
cannot be “too positive”, comparing with the positivity of the function r. The criteria of
this section characterize in a quantitative way the vague expression “not too positive”.
The Roundabout theorem offers two basic methods of the investigation of oscillatory
properties of (0.1). The ﬁrst one, usually referred to as the variational principle, is based
on the equivalence of disconjugacy of (0.1) and the positivity of the associated energy
functional F. The second main method—the Riccati technique—uses the equivalence of
disconjugacy (0.1) and solvability of the generalized Riccati equation (2.1).
5.1. Variational principle and Wirtinger’s inequality
As an immediate consequence of the equivalence of (i) and (iv) in Theorem 2.2 we have the
following statement which is used in the proofs of oscillation and nonoscillation criteria
based on the variational principle.

A useful tool in the variational technique is the following half-linear version of the
Wirtinger inequality.

ing integration by parts, the fact that y has a compact support in (a,b), and the Hölder
inequality, we have

REMARK 5.1. (i) Later we will show that the constant

p( p−1
p )p−1 in the previous
nonoscillation criterion is sharp in the sense that if the limit in (5.2) (or in (5.3)) is greater
than this constant, then (0.1) is oscillatory. Also, when the previous criterion is applied to

200
Half-linear differential equations
Euler-type differential equation (4.20) in the previous chapter, we again reveal the critical
constant ˜γ = ( p−1
p )p.
(ii) In (5.2) and (5.3), the nonnegative part of the function c appeared. In the next sub-
section we present an improvement of the previous nonoscillation criterion, where instead
of c+ the function c directly appears.
(iii) If, in addition to assumptions of the previous theorem, we suppose that c(t) > 0 for
large t then the second part of this theorem (the case when
 ∞r1−q(t)dt < ∞) can be
deduced from the ﬁrst one using the reciprocity principle from Section 2.7. Indeed, if (5.3)
holds, then
 ∞c(t)dt = ∞and consider the reciprocal equation to (0.1)

c1−q(t)Φq(u′)
′ + r1−q(t)Φq(u) = 0,
Φq(u) = |u|q−1 sgnu = Φ−1(u),
where q is again the conjugate number of p. This equation, with p replaced by q, r by
c1−q and c by r1−q satisﬁes assumptions of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 5.2, since (using
(p −1)(q −1) = 1)
 ∞(c1−q(t))1−p dt =
 ∞c(t)dt = ∞and

which is a Hardy-type inequality, see, e.g., [131]. This inequality has been extended in
many directions and some of these extensions could be perhaps used to establish more
sophisticated nonoscillation criteria than that given in Theorem 5.2. This problem is a
subject of the present investigation.
5.3. Riccati inequality
From the Roundabout theorem (Theorem 2.2) it follows that nonoscillation of (0.1) is
equivalent to solvability of the associated Riccati equation (2.1). Due to the Sturm com-
parison theorem, nonoscillation of (0.1) is actually equivalent to solvability of the Riccati
inequality. This is formulated in the next statement.

Half-linear differential equations
201
THEOREM 5.3. Equation (0.1) is nonoscillatory if and only if there exists a continuously
differentiable function v deﬁned on an interval [T,∞) and satisfying there the inequality
v′ + c(t) + (p −1)r1−q(t)|v|q ⩽0.
(5.4)
PROOF. Let v be a solution of (5.4). Denote C(t) := −v′ −(p −1)r1−q(t)|v|q. Then v is a
solution of v′+C(t)+(p−1)r1−q(t)|v|q = 0 which is the Riccati equation associated with
a Sturmian majorant of (0.1) (since C(t) ⩾c(t)). This majorant equation is nonoscillatory
and hence (0.1) is nonoscillatory as well.
□
The previous statement is used in the half-linear version of the classical Wintner crite-
rion. This linear criterion claims that if  ∞r−1(t)dt = ∞and  ∞c(t)dt converges, then
the linear Sturm–Liouville equation (1.1) is nonoscillatory provided

which is extensible up to ∞, i.e., it exists on some interval [T,∞). To ﬁnd this solution

5.4. Half-linear Hartman–Wintner theorem
The next theorem is a half-linear extension of the classical Hartman–Wintner theorem
[106] which relates the square integrability of the solutions of the Riccati equation
w′ + c(t) + w2 = 0
corresponding to (1.1) with r(t) ≡1 to the ﬁniteness of a certain limit involving the func-
tion c. The half-linear extension of this theorem (also in case r(t) ≡1) is proved in [153],
but the modiﬁcation of this proof to (0.1) as presented here is straightforward.
THEOREM 5.6. Suppose that
 ∞

and (0.1) is nonoscillatory. Then the following statements are equivalent.
(i) It holds

As a direct consequence of the previous theorem we have the following oscillation cri-
terion.
THEOREM 5.7. Suppose that
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞. Then each of the following two condi-
tions is sufﬁcient for oscillation of (0.1):

 t r1−q(s)ds
.
(5.19)
PROOF. We will prove sufﬁciency of (5.18) only, the proof of sufﬁciency of (5.19) is sim-
ilar. Suppose that (0.1) is nonoscillatory and (5.18) holds. Then (5.13) holds and by the
previous theorem the integral (5.11) converges for every solution w of (2.1) and hence
limit (5.12) exists as a ﬁnite number which contradicts to (5.18).
□
5.5. Riccati integral equation and Hille–Wintner comparison theorem
The results of this subsection are taken essentially from the paper [136]. In that paper, it is
supposed that r(t) ≡1 and c(t) ⩾0 for large t. However, the results as presented here can

Half-linear differential equations
207
be extended to (0.1) with r satisfying the below assumption (5.20), and without the sign
restriction on the function c.
LEMMA 5.2. Suppose that
 ∞
r1−q(t)dt = ∞
(5.20)
and the integral
 ∞c(t)dt is convergent. Then (0.1) is nonoscillatory if and only if there
exists a solution of the Riccati integral equation
w(t) =
 ∞
t
c(s)ds + (p −1)
 ∞

q ds.
(5.21)
PROOF. Suppose that (0.1) is nonoscillatory and let w be a solution of the associated
Riccati equation (2.1) which is deﬁned on some interval [T0,∞). The convergence of the
integral
 ∞c(t)dt and (5.20) imply that (5.11) holds by Theorem 5.6. Integrating (2.1)
from t to T , t ⩾T0 and letting T →∞we see that limT →∞w(T ) exists and since (5.20)
holds, this limit equals zero, i.e., w satisﬁes also (5.21). Conversely, if w is a solution of
(5.21), than it is also a solution of (2.1) and hence (0.1) is nonoscillatory.
□
The previous lemma is used in the proof of the following half-linear extension of the
Hille–Wintner comparison theorem. For its linear version see [208, Theorem 2.14].
THEOREM 5.8. Together with (0.1) consider the equation

r(t)Φ(y′)
′ + ˜c(t)Φ(y) = 0,
(5.22)
where r satisﬁes (5.20), ˜c is continuous for large and

c(s)ds ⩽
 ∞
t
˜c(s)ds
for large t
(5.23)
and (5.22) is nonoscillatory, then (0.1) is also nonoscillatory.
PROOF. We construct a solution w of (5.21). Nonoscillation of (5.22) implies the existence
of a solution v of the associated integral equation
v(t) =

The set U is the convex and closed subset of the Fréchet space C[T,∞) with the topology
of the uniform convergence on compact subintervals of [T,∞). It can be shown without
difﬁculty that F maps U into itself, that F is continuous and that F(U) is relatively com-
pact subset of C[T,∞). Therefore, it follows from the Schauder–Tychonov ﬁxed point
theorem that there exists w ∈U such that w = Fw and this function is by deﬁnition of F
a solution of (5.21).
□
5.6. Hille–Nehari criteria
In Section 4.2 we have shown that the Euler equation (4.20) is nonoscillatory if and only if
γ ⩽˜γ = ( p−1
p )p. Consider now the equation
r(t)Φ(x′)′ +
γ r1−q(t)
(
 t r1−q(s)ds)p Φ(x) = 0
(5.25)
with r satisfying (5.20). The transformation of independent variable t 
→ t r1−q(s)ds
transforms this equation into the Euler equation (4.20). Hence also (5.25) is nonoscilla-
tory if and only if γ ⩽˜γ . This fact, combined with Theorem 5.6, leads to the follow-
ing nonoscillation and oscillation criteria which are the half-linear extension of the Hille–
Nehari (non)oscillation criteria, see [208, Chapter II].
THEOREM 5.9. Suppose that

5.7. Modiﬁed Hille–Nehari’s criteria
The results of this subsection are taken from [135]. It is supposed that c(t) ⩾0 for large t
and that
 ∞
r1−q(t)dt < ∞.
(5.27)
We denote
ϱ(t) =
 ∞
t
r1−q(s)ds.
The ﬁrst auxiliary statement concerns boundedness of solutions of (0.1) and of the asso-
ciated Riccati equation.
LEMMA 5.3. Let x be a nonoscillatory solution of (0.1) and let w = rΦ(x′)/Φ(x) be the
associated solution of (2.1). Then x and the function
z(t) := ϱp−1w(t)
(5.28)
are bounded. Moreover,
ϱp−1(t)w(t) ⩾−1
for large t
(5.29)
and
limsup
t→∞
ϱp−1(t)w(t) ⩽0.
(5.30)
PROOF. Without loss of generality we can suppose that x(t) > 0 for t ∈[t0,∞). The func-
tion r(t)Φ(x′) is nonincreasing (since its derivative equals −c(t)Φ(x) ⩽0), the derivative
x′ is eventually of constant sign. That is, x′(t) > 0 for t ⩾t0 or there is t1 > t0 such that
x′(t) < 0 for t ⩾t1, and that
rq−1(s)x′(s) ⩽rq−1(t)x′(t)
for s ⩾t ⩾t0.
Dividing this inequality by rq−1(s) and integrating it over [t,τ] gives
x(τ) ⩽x(t) + rq−1(t)x′(t)
 τ
t
r1−q(s)ds.
(5.31)
If x′(t) > 0 for t ⩾t0, then we have from (5.31)
x(τ) ⩽x(t) + rq−1(t)x′(t)ϱ(t)

210
Half-linear differential equations
which shows that x is bounded on [t0,∞). If x′(t) < 0 for t ⩾t1, then x is clearly bounded
and, letting τ →∞in (5.31) we have
0 ⩽x(t) + rq−1(t)x′(t)ϱ(t),
t ⩾t0.
In either case we obtain
ϱ(t)rq−1(t)x′(t)
x(t) ⩾−1,
which immediately implies (5.29).
The limit inequality (5.30) trivially holds if x′(t) < 0 for t ⩾t1, since in this case the
function (5.28) itself is negative for t ⩾t1. If x′(t) > 0 for t ⩾t0, then there exist positive
constants c1,c2 such that
x(t) ⩾c1
and
r(t)Φ(x′(t)) ⩽c2
for t ⩾t0,
which implies
w(t) ⩽
c2
cp−1
1
,
t ⩾t0.
Since ϱ(t) →0 as t →∞, we then conclude that
lim
t→∞ϱp−1(t)w(t) = 0.
This completes the proof.
□
Based on the previous lemma we show that nonoscillation of (0.1) is equivalent to solv-
ability of a certain modiﬁed Riccati integral inequality.
THEOREM 5.10. Equation (0.1) is nonoscillatory if and only if
 ∞
ϱp(t)c(t)dt < ∞
(5.32)
and there exists a continuous function v such that
ϱp−1v(t)
is bounded,
ϱp−1(t)v(t) ⩾−1,

and
ϱp(t)v(t) ⩾

PROOF. “⇒”: Let x be a solution of (0.1) such that x(t) ̸= 0 for t ⩾t0 and let w =
rΦ(x′)/Φ(x) be the corresponding solution of the Riccati equation (2.1). Multiplying this
equation by ρp(t) and integrating over [t,τ], τ ⩾t ⩾t0, we get
ρp(τ)w(τ) −ρp(t)w(t) = −p

(5.35)
In view of boundedness of the function ρp−1w(t) (compare the previous lemma), we see
that ρp(τ)w(τ) = ρ(τ)ρp−1(τ)w(τ) →0 as τ →∞, and

for t ⩾t0. Therefore, letting τ →∞in (5.35), we ﬁnd that

ρp(s)c(s)ds is convergent,
i.e., (5.32) holds, and
ρp(t)w(t) =

hence (5.34) holds as equality. The inequality ρp(t)w(t) ⩾−1 follows from the previous
lemma.
“⇐”: Suppose that (5.32) holds and let w be a continuous function satisfying conditions
of theorem. Further, let us denote C[t0,∞) the Fréchet space of continuous functions with
the topology of uniform convergence on compact subintervals of [t0,∞). Consider the
space
V := v ∈C[t0,∞): −1 ⩽v(t) ⩽ρp−1(t)w(t), t ⩾t0
,
(5.36)
which is a closed convex subset of C[t0,∞). Deﬁne the mapping F :V →C[t0,∞) by

ing for ξ ⩾−1, i.e.,
(p −1)|ξ|q + pξ + 1 ⩾0,
for ξ ⩾−1.
This shows that F maps V into itself. It can be shown in a routine manner that F is
continuous and F(V) is relatively compact in the topology of C[t0,∞). Therefore, by
the Schauder–Tychonov ﬁxed point theorem, there exists an element v ∈V such that
v(t) = (Fv)(t). Deﬁne w by w(t) =
v(t)
ρp−1(t). Then, in view of (5.37), w satisﬁes the in-
tegral equation

Differentiating this equality and then dividing by ρp(t) shows that w solves Riccati equa-
tion (2.1) and hence (0.1) is nonoscillatory.
□
As an immediate consequence of the previous theorem we have the following oscillation
criterion.
COROLLARY 5.1. Equation (0.1) is oscillatory if
 ∞
c(s)ρp(t)dt = ∞.
(5.38)
This oscillation criterion opens a natural question about oscillatory nature of (0.1) when
the integral in (5.38) is convergent. In answering this question a useful role is played by the
following modiﬁcation of the Hille–Wintner comparison theorem. Recall that we assume
that c(t) ⩾0 for large t throughout this subsection.
THEOREM 5.11. Consider the pair of Equations (0.1) and

r(t)Φ(y′)
′ + ˜c(t)Φ(y) = 0,
(5.39)

Half-linear differential equations
213
where ˜c(t) ⩾0, subject to the conditions
 ∞
c(t)ρp(t)dt < ∞,
 ∞
˜c(t)ρp(t)dt < ∞.
(5.40)
Suppose that
 ∞
t
c(t)ρp(t)dt ⩽
 ∞
t
˜c(t)ρp(t)dt.
(5.41)
Then nonoscillation of (5.39) implies that of (0.1), or equivalently, oscillation of (0.1)
implies oscillation of (5.39).
PROOF. Assume that (5.39) is nonoscillatory. Then, by the part “only if” of Theorem 5.10
there exists a continuous function w satisfying (5.33) and
ρp(t)w(t) ⩾

Using (5.40) and (5.41) we see that w satisﬁes the integral inequality (5.34) and hence
(0.1) is nonoscillatory by the part “if” of Theorem 5.10.
□
In Remark 4.1 we have shown that the Euler-type half-linear differential equation (4.33)
is nonoscillatory if and only if γ < ( |p−1−α|
p
)p. The transformation of independent variable
u(s) = x(t), s = s(t) = (ρ(t))
p−1
p−1−α , transforms (0.1) into the equation

t = t(s) being the inverse function of s = s(t). Now suppose that α > p −1. Then we
have

Euler equation (4.33) (using Theorem 5.11) we have the following result which we present
without proof.

5.8. Comparison theorem with respect to p
Along with (0.1) we consider another half-linear equation with a different power function
Φα(x) = |x|α−1 sgnx, α > 1,
r(t)Φα(x′)′ + c(t)Φα(x) = 0,
(5.43)
we denote by β the conjugate number of α, i.e., β =
β
β−1 (recall also that q is the conjugate
number of p, i.e., q =
p
p−1).
The main statement of this subsection gives a kind of comparison theorem with respect
to the power of Φ. This statement is proved in [201] in a more general setting than pre-
sented here (in the scope of the so-called half-linear dynamic equations on time scales,
compare Section 16.5 in the last chapter). However, we prefer here the formulation for
(0.1) and (5.43).
THEOREM 5.13. Let r1−β(t)dt = ∞,
 ∞c(t)dt converges and liminft→∞r(t) > 0. If
α ⩾p and Equation (5.43) is nonoscillatory, then (0.1) is also nonoscillatory.
PROOF. Denote S(w,r,p) = (p−1)r1−q|w|q (this is the third term in the Riccati equation
(2.1)). Then S can be rewritten as
S(w,r,p) = (p −1)|w|
|w|p

and it is easy to compute that

.
Hence, for |w|
r ⩽1 the function S is nondecreasing with respect to p.
Since (5.43) is nonoscillatory, by Lemma 5.2 there exists a function v satisfying the
Riccati equation
v′ + c(t) + S

v,r(t),α

= 0,

Half-linear differential equations
215
and such that v(t) →0 as t →∞. Since liminft→∞r(t) > 0, we have |w(t)|
r(t) ⩽1 for large
t, and thus
0 = v′ + c(t) + Sv,r(t),α ⩾v′(t) + c(t) + Sv,r(t),p.
Hence (0.1) is nonoscillatory by Theorem 5.3.
□
6. Asymptotic of nonoscillatory solutions
This section is devoted to the asymptotic properties of nonoscillatory solutions of Equa-
tion (0.1) when the function c does not change its sign. In this case it is possible associate
with (0.1) its reciprocal equation

c1−q(t)Φ−1(u′)
′ + r1−q(t)Φ−1(u) = 0.
(6.1)
Recall that the so-called reciprocity principle says that (6.1) is nonoscillatory if and only
if (0.1) is nonoscillatory, see Section 2.7. Note also that if c(t) ⩽0 for large t then (0.1) is
nonoscillatory since the equation (r(t)Φ(x′))′ = 0 is its nonoscillatory majorant.
6.1. Integral conditions and classiﬁcation of solutions
If c is different from zero for large t, then all solutions of nonoscillatory equation (0.1) are
eventually monotone, as the following result shows.
LEMMA 6.1. Let c(t) ̸= 0 for large t and x be a solution of nonoscillatory equation (0.1)
deﬁned on some interval (αx,∞),αx ⩾0. Then either x(t)x′(t) > 0 or x(t)x′(t) < 0 for
large t.
PROOF. The monotonicity of x follows from the reciprocity principle which ensures that
the so-called quasiderivative x[1] := rΦ(x′) does not change its sign for large t.
□
Then it is possible, a priori, to divide the set of solutions of (0.1) into the following two
classes:
M+ = x solution of (0.1): ∃tx ⩾0: x(t)x′(t) > 0 for t > tx
,
M−=

x solution of (0.1): ∃tx ⩾0: x(t)x′(t) < 0 for t > tx

.
Clearly, solutions in M+ are eventually either positive increasing or negative decreasing
and solutions in M−are either positive decreasing or negative increasing. The existence
of solutions in these classes depends on the sign of the function c, as the following results
show.
PROPOSITION 6.1. Assume c(t) < 0 for large t.

216
Half-linear differential equations
(i) Equation (0.1) has solutions in the class M−. More precisely, for every pair (t0,a) ∈
[0,∞) × R\{0} there exists a solution x of (0.1) in the class M−such that x(t0) = a.
(ii) Equation (0.1) has solutions in the class M+. More precisely, for every pair (a0,a1) ∈
R2, a0 a1 > 0 and for any t0 sufﬁciently large, there exists a solution x of (0.1) in the
class M+ such that x(t0) = a0, x′(t0) = a1.
PROOF. Claim (i) follows, for instance, from [44, Theorem 1] and [178, Theorems 9.1,
9.2]. Concerning the claim (ii), let x be a solution of (0.1) such that x(0)x′(0) > 0. Since
the auxiliary function
Fx(t) = r(t)Φx′(t)x(t)
(6.2)
is nondecreasing, we obtain x(t)x′(t) > 0 for t > 0. The assertion follows taking into
account that every solution is continuable up to ∞, see Section 1.
□
In the opposite case, i.e., when c(t) > 0 for large t, the existence in the classes M+,M−
may be characterized by means of the convergence or divergence of the following two
integrals
Jr =
 ∞

r1−q(t)dt,
Jc =

as the following results show.
LEMMA 6.2. Assume c(t) > 0 for large t.
(i) If Jc = ∞, then M+ = ∅.
(ii) If Jr = ∞, then M−= ∅.
PROOF. (i) Let x be a solution of (0.1) in the class M+ and, without loss of generality,
suppose x(t) > 0,x′(t) > 0 for t ⩾T ⩾0. From (0.1) we obtain for t ⩾T

that gives a contradiction as t →∞. Claim (ii) follows by applying (i) to (6.1) and using
the reciprocity principle.
□
PROPOSITION 6.2. Assume c(t) > 0 for large t.
(i) If (0.1) is nonoscillatory and Jr = ∞,Jc < ∞, then M+ ̸= ∅.
(ii) If (0.1) is nonoscillatory and Jr < ∞,Jc = ∞, then M−̸= ∅.
(iii) If Jr < ∞,Jc < ∞, then M+ ̸= ∅,M−̸= ∅.
PROOF. Claims (i), (ii) follows from Lemma 6.2. The assertion (iii) follows, for instance,
as a particular case from [218, Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.3] and their proofs by choosing
R(t) = 1 and observing that assumptions (3.2), (3.11) in [218] are not necessary in the
half-linear case.
□

Half-linear differential equations
217
In view of Lemma 6.2, if (0.1) is nonoscillatory, c is eventually positive and Jr + Jc =
∞, then all the solutions of (0.1) belong to the same class (M+ or M−). In addition, from
the same Lemma 6.2, the well-known Leigthon-type oscillation result can be obtained: Let
c be eventually positive; if Jr = Jc = ∞, then (0.1) is oscillatory (compare Theorem 2.5).
As in the quoted papers [38–41,45,176,181], in both cases c > 0 and c < 0 eventually,
the classes M+,M−may be divided, a priori, into the following four subclasses, which are
mutually disjoint:
M−
B =

x ∈M−: lim
t→∞x(t) = ℓx ̸= 0

,
M−
0 =

x ∈M−: lim
t→∞x(t) = 0

t→∞x(t) = ℓx, |ℓx| < ∞

,
M+

x ∈M+: lim
t→∞|x(t)| = ∞

.
In the following subsections we consider both cases c(t) > 0,c(t) < 0 and we describe the
above classes in terms of certain integral conditions. Similarly to the linear case, we are
going to show that the convergence or divergence of the two integrals

The following lemma describes relations between J1,J2,Jr,Jc.
LEMMA 6.3. The following statements hold.
(a) If J1 < ∞, then Jr < ∞.
(b) If J2 < ∞, then Jc < ∞.
(c) If J2 = ∞, then Jr = ∞or Jc = ∞.
(d) If J1 = ∞, then Jr = ∞or Jc = ∞.
(e) J1 < ∞and J2 < ∞if and only if Jr < ∞and Jc < ∞.

□
6.2. The case c negative
When the function c(t) is eventually negative, the asymptotic properties of nonoscillatory
solutions have been deeply studied and interesting contributions are due to the Georgian
and Russian mathematical school [43,44,125,126,128,127,143,176,193]. Other recent de-
velopments can be found in [45,141,156,181]. Here we deal with some results that can be
obtained, as a particular case, from recent criteria in [33,35] and, under the assumption that
Jr is convergent or divergent, can be found in [180,210].
We start by noting that if c(t) < 0 in the whole interval [0,∞), then for any solution
x ∈M−we have x(t)x′(t) < 0 on [0,∞). This property can be proved using the auxiliary
function Fx given in (6.2). Since, as claimed, F is a nondecreasing function and x is not
eventually constant, there are only two possibilities: (a) Fx does not have zeros; (b) there
exists tx ⩾αx such that Fx(t) > 0 for all t > tx. Thus the assertion follows.
The following hold.
THEOREM 6.1. Let c(t) < 0 for large t.
(i) Equation (0.1) has solutions in the class M−
B if and only if J2 < ∞.
(ii) Equation (0.1) has solutions in the class M+
B if and only if J1 < ∞.
PROOF. Claim (i) “⇒”: Let x ∈M−
B. Without loss of generality we can assume x(t) > 0,
x′(t) < 0 for t ⩾T ⩾0. Integrating (0.1) in (t,∞), t > T, we obtain

which implies, by virtue of (6.4), T (Ω) ⊆Ω. In order to apply the Tychonov ﬁxed point
theorem to operator T , it is sufﬁcient to prove that T is continuous in Ω ⊆C[t0,∞) and
that T (Ω) is relatively compact in C[t0,∞). Let {uj},j ∈N, be a sequence in Ω which is

the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem gives the continuity of T in Ω. It remains
to prove that T (Ω) is relatively compact in C[t0,∞), i.e., that functions in T (Ω) are equi-
bounded and equicontinuous on every compact subinterval of [t0,∞). The equibounded-
ness easily follows taking into account that Ω is a bounded subset of C[t0,∞). In order to

It is easy to show that x is a positive solution of (0.1) in [t0,∞) and, from (6.7), x′(t) < 0.
Finally, clearly x satisﬁes the inequality x(t)x′(t) < 0 in its maximal interval of existence
and the proof of claim (i) is complete.
Claim (ii) “⇒”: Assume, by contradiction, J1 = ∞. Without loss of generality let x be
a solution of (0.1) in the class M+
B such that x(t) > 0,x′(t) > 0 for t ⩾t0 ⩾0. Integrating
(0.1) on (t0,t) we obtain for t > t0

REMARK 6.1. The behavior of quasiderivatives of solutions (i.e., of expressions x[1] =
rΦ(x′)) plays an important role in the study of principal solutions, especially in their limit
characterization, see the next section. Concerning the solution x ∈M−
B, deﬁned as a ﬁxed
point in the proof of Theorem 6.1, we have limt→∞x[1](t) = 0. Concerning the solution
x ∈M−
0 , deﬁned in the proof of Theorem 6.3, it is easy to show that limt→∞x[1](t) =
cx < 0. Indeed, the limit

and the function x′rq−1is negative increasing.
From Theorems 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, we can summarize the situation in the following way.
Clearly, as regards the convergence or divergence of J1, J2, the possible cases are the
following:
(A1):
J1 = ∞,
J2 = ∞,
(A2):
J1 = ∞,
J2 < ∞,
(A3):
J1 < ∞,
J2 = ∞,
(A4):
J1 < ∞,
J2 < ∞.
Then the following result holds.
THEOREM 6.4. Let c(t) < 0 for large t.
(i) Assume case (A1). Then any solution of (0.1) in the class M−tends to zero as
t →∞and any solution of (0.1) in the class M+ is unbounded.

Half-linear differential equations
223
(ii) Assume case (A2). Then any solution of (0.1) in the class M−tends to a nonzero
limit as t →∞and any solution of (0.1) in the class M+ is unbounded.
(iii) Assume case (A3). Then any solution of (0.1) in the class M−tends to zero as
t →∞and any solution of (0.1) in the class M+ is bounded.
(iv) Assume case (A4). Then both solutions of (0.1) converging to zero and solutions of
(0.1) tending to a nonzero limit (as t →∞) exist in the class M−. Further solutions
of (0.1) in the class M+ are bounded.
From Theorem 6.4 we obtain immediately the following result which generalizes a well-
know one stated for the linear equation in [173, Theorems 3 and 4]; see also [106, Chap-
ters VI, XI]).
COROLLARY 6.1. Let c(t) < 0 for large t.
(a) Any solution x of (0.1) in the class M−tends to zero as t →∞if and only if
J2 = ∞.
(b) Any solution of (0.1) is bounded if and only if J1 < ∞.
Following another classiﬁcation used in [180,210], we distinguish these types of even-
tually positive solutions x of (0.1) (clearly a similar classiﬁcation holds for eventually
negative solutions):
Type (1)
lim
t→∞x(t) = 0,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = 0;
Type (2)
lim
t→∞x(t) = 0,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = c1 < 0;
Type (3)
lim
t→∞x(t) = c0 > 0,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = c1 ⩽0;
Type (4)
lim
t→∞x(t) = c0 > 0,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = c1 > 0;
Type (5)
lim
t→∞x(t) = c0 > 0,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = ∞;
Type (6)
lim
t→∞x(t) = ∞,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = c1;
Type (7)
lim
t→∞x(t) = ∞,
lim
t→∞x[1](t) = ∞.
Eventually positive solutions in M−are of the Types (1)–(3), eventually positive solu-
tions in M+ are of the Types (4)–(7). From Theorem 6.4 and the reciprocity principle (see
Section 2.7), necessary and/or sufﬁcient conditions for their existence can be obtained. To
this end observe that the integral Jr [Jc] for (0.1) plays the same role as Jc [Jr] for the
reciprocal equation (6.1). Similarly, for the reciprocal equation (6.1) the integrals J1, J2
becomes

THEOREM 6.5. Let c(t) < 0 for large t. Then the following statements hold:
(a) Every eventually positive solution in M−is of Type (1) if and only if J2 = ∞and
R2 = ∞.
(b) Equation (0.1) has solutions of Type (2) if and only if R2 < ∞.
(c) Equation (0.1) has solutions of Type (3) if and only if J2 < ∞.
(d) Equation (0.1) has solutions of Type (4) if and only if J1 < ∞and R1 < ∞.
(e) Equation (0.1) has solutions of Type (5) if and only if J1 < ∞and R1 = ∞.
(f) Equation (0.1) has solutions of Type (6) if and only if J1 = ∞and R1 < ∞.
(g) Every eventually positive solution in M+ is of Type (7) if and only if J1 = ∞and
R1 = ∞.
6.3. Uniqueness in M−.
The uniqueness in the class M−plays a crucial role in the study of the limit characterization
of principal solutions (see Theorem 7.6 in the next section).
Proposition 6.1 states that, when c is eventually negative, the class M−is nonempty. In
the linear case, the assumption

of the solution is given (see [173, Theorems 3,4]). We will show that also for (0.1) such a
property is assured by a natural extension of condition (6.10).
THEOREM 6.6. Let c(t) < 0 for large t. For any (t0,x0) ∈[0,∞) × R\{0}, there exists a

Sufﬁciency. Let us show that for any (t0,x0) ∈[0,∞) × R\{0}, there exists at most one
solution x of (0.1) in the class M−such that x(t0) = x0 when Jr = ∞or Jc = ∞. Let x,y
be two solutions of (0.1) in the class M−such that x(t0) = y(t0),x′(t0) > y′(t0). Consider
the function d given by d(t) = x(t) −y(t). Then d(t0) = 0,d′(t0) > 0. We claim that d
does not have positive points of maximum greater than t0, i.e.,
d(t) > 0,
d′(t) > 0
for t > t0.
Assume there exists t1 > t0 such that d(t1) > 0, d′(t1) = 0 and d′(t) > 0 in a suitable left
neighborhood I of t1. Without loss of generality suppose that d(t) > 0 for t ∈I. Now
consider the function G given by
G(t) = r(t)Φx′(t) −Φy′(t).
Hence G(t1) = 0. Taking into account that Φ is increasing and d′(t) > 0, we have G(t) >
0, t ∈I. In addition, from
G′(t) =


c(t)



Φ

x(t)

−Φ

y(t)

,
we obtain G′(t) > 0, t ∈I, which gives a contradiction, because G(t1) = 0. Hence the
function d is increasing.
If Jc = ∞then, by Lemma 6.3 we have J2 = ∞. Then, in view of Corollary 6.1(a), we
obtain d(∞) = 0, that is a contradiction. If Jr = ∞, then taking into account that d′(t) > 0
for t > t0, the function G satisﬁes G(t) > 0, G′(t) > 0 for t > t0 and, by Lemma 6.4,
limt→∞G(t) = 0, that is a contradiction. Finally the existence of at least one solution
x ∈M−such that x(t0) = x0 is assured by Proposition 6.1(i).
□
6.4. The case c positive
As already stated before, when c is eventually positive, Equation (0.1) may be either os-
cillatory or nonoscillatory. In the nonoscillation case, the asymptotic behavior of solutions
has been considered by many authors. Here we refer in particular to [37,90,99,112,121,157,
179,218] and references therein. In these papers certain asymptotic properties of nonoscil-
latory solutions are examined, under various assumptions on functions r,c, for equation
(0.1) or, sometimes, for a more general equation (which includes (0.1)). In this section,
similarly to Section 6.2, we will show how it is possible to obtain from these results, with
a very simple argument, a complete description of the asymptotic behavior of solutions of
(0.1) also when c is positive.
The following holds.

Half-linear differential equations
227
PROPOSITION 6.3. Let c(t) > 0 for large t and Jr = ∞.
(i) If J2 = ∞, then M+
B = ∅.
(ii) If J2 < ∞, then Equation (0.1) is nonoscillatory and M+
B ̸= ∅.
PROOF. In view of Lemma 6.2(ii) any nonoscillatory solution of (0.1) is in the class M+.
Then claims (i) and (ii) follow from [112, Theorem 4.2].
□
The following “uniqueness” result will be useful in the proof of the existence of un-
bounded solutions. It is, in some sense, the analogous one to Theorem 6.6.
THEOREM 6.7 ([112, Theorem 4.3]). Let c(t) > 0 for large t. Let η ̸= 0 be a given con-
stant and assume Jr = ∞,J2 < ∞. Then there exists a unique solution x of (0.1), x ∈M+,
such that limt→∞x(t) = η.
By using such a result we obtain the following.
PROPOSITION 6.4. Let c(t) > 0 for large t and assume Jr = ∞,J2 < ∞. Then (0.1) has
unbounded solutions, i.e., M+
∞̸= ∅.
PROOF. Assume, by contradiction, that M+
∞= ∅. In view of Proposition 6.3, let u be a
solution of (0.1) in the class M+
B and let x be another solution of (0.1) such that x(0) =
u(0),x′(0) ̸= u′(0). Hence x ̸= u and from Lemma 6.2(ii) we have x ∈M+
B. In view of
Theorem 6.7 we have u(∞) ̸= x(∞). Now consider the solution w of (0.1) given by
w(t) = u(∞)
x(∞)x(t).
We have w ∈M+
B. But w(∞) = u(∞), that gives a contradiction.
□
PROPOSITION 6.5. Let c(t) > 0 for large t. If Jr < ∞, then (0.1) does not have un-
bounded nonoscillatory solutions, i.e., M+
∞= ∅.
PROOF. The assertion follows, with minor changes, from [99, Lemma 2].
□
Concerning the existence in the class M−, the following hold.
PROPOSITION 6.6. Let c(t) > 0 for large t.
(i) If Jr < ∞,Jc = ∞,J1 < ∞, then (0.1) is nonoscillatory and M−
B ̸= ∅.
(ii) If J1 = ∞, then M−
B = ∅.
PROOF. Claim (i) follows from [99, Theorem 4]. As for the claim (ii), let x ∈M−
B and,
without loss of generality, assume x(t) > 0,x′(t) < 0 for t ⩾T and x(∞) = cx > 0. From
(0.1) we have
x[1](t) = x[1](T ) −

PROPOSITION 6.7. Let c(t) > 0 for large t. If (0.1) is nonoscillatory and Jr < ∞, then
M−
0 ̸= ∅.
PROOF. If Jc < ∞, the assertion follows, as a particular case, from [179, Theorem 2.2].
When Jc = ∞the assertion follows from [37, Lemma 2(ii)].
□
By considering the mutual behavior of integrals Jr,Jc,J1,J2 it is possible to summarize
the situation in a complete way. Indeed, as regards the convergence or divergence of the
above integrals, in view of Lemma 6.3, we have the following six possible cases:
(C1) Jr = Jc = J1 = J2 = ∞,
(C2) Jr = J1 = J2 = ∞, Jc < ∞,
(C3) Jr = J1 = ∞, Jc < ∞,J2 < ∞,
(C4) Jc = J1 = J2 = ∞, Jr < ∞,
(C5) Jc = J2 = ∞, Jr < ∞,J1 < ∞,
(C6) Jr < ∞,Jc < ∞,J1 < ∞,J2 < ∞.
If (C1) holds, then, as already claimed in Section 6.1, Equation (0.1) is oscillatory. In
the remaining cases, from the above results, we obtain the following theorem, which is a
natural extension of the previous one stated in the linear case [39, Theorem 1].
THEOREM 6.8. Let c(t) > 0 for large t.
If (C2) holds and (0.1) is nonoscillatory, then M+
∞̸= ∅, M+
B = M−
B = M−
0 = ∅.
If (C3) holds, then (0.1) is nonoscillatory and M+
∞̸= ∅, M+
B ̸= ∅, M−
B = M−
0 = ∅.
If (C4) holds and (0.1) is nonoscillatory, then M+
∞= M+
B = M−
B = ∅, M−
0 ̸= ∅.
If (C5) holds, then (0.1) is nonoscillatory and M+
∞= M+
B = ∅, M−
B ̸= ∅, M−
0 ̸= ∅.
If (C6) holds, then (0.1) is nonoscillatory and M+
∞= ∅, M+
B ̸= ∅, M−
B ̸= ∅, M−
0 ̸= ∅.
PROOF. The proof follows from the previous statements of this section.
(C2) From Lemma 6.2(ii) and Proposition 6.3(i) we have M+
B = M−
B = M−
0 = ∅. Since
(0.1) is nonoscillatory, we obtain M+ = M+
∞̸= ∅.
(C3) The assertion follows from Lemma 6.2(ii), Proposition 6.3(ii), Proposition 6.4.
(C4) From Lemma 6.2(i) and Proposition 6.6(ii) we have M+
∞= M+
B = M−
B = ∅. Since
(0.1) is nonoscillatory, we obtain M−= M−
0 ̸= ∅.
(C5) The assertion follows from Lemma 6.2(i), Proposition 6.6(i), Proposition 6.7.

Half-linear differential equations
229
(C6) From Proposition 6.2(iii), Proposition 6.5, Proposition 6.7, we obtain M+
∞= ∅,
M+
B ̸= ∅, M−
0 ̸= ∅. Finally the existence in M−
B can be proved using an argument
similar to that given in the proof of Theorem 6.1 (see also [218, Theorem 3.3] and
its proof).
□
Taking into account that the possible cases concerning the convergence or divergence of
Jr,Jc,J1,J2 are the cases (C1)–(C6), from Theorem 6.8 we easily obtain the following
interesting result, which gives a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of
nonoscillatory solutions of (0.1) in the classes M+

B,M−

of several auxiliary statements, we will not formulate these results here and we refer to the
above mentioned paper [117].
7. Principal solution
The concept of the principal solution of the linear second order differential equation (1.1)
was introduced in 1936 by Leighton and Morse [148] and plays an important role in the
oscillation and asymptotic theory of (1.1). In this section we show that this concept can be
introduced also for (nonoscillatory) half-linear equation (0.1).
7.1. Principal solution of linear equations
First we recall basic properties of the principal solution of linear equation (1.1). Suppose
that this equation is nonoscillatory, i.e., any solution of this equation is eventually positive
or negative. Then, using the below described method, one can distinguish among all solu-
tions of this equation a solution ˜x, called the principal solution, (determined uniquely up
to a multiplicative factor) which is near ∞less than any other solution of this equation in
the sense that
lim
t→∞
˜x(t)
x(t) = 0
for any solution x which is linearly independent of ˜x.

230
Half-linear differential equations
Let x,y be eventually positive linearly independent solution of (1.1), then
r(t)

x′(t)y(t) −x(t)y′(t)

=: ω ̸= 0.
This means that the function x
y is monotonic and hence there exists (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) limit
limt→∞x(t)
y(t) = L. If L = 0, the solution x the principal solution of (1.1), if L = ∞, the
principal solution is y. If 0 < L < ∞, we set ˜x = x −Ly. Then obviously limt→∞˜x(t)
y(t) = 0
and ˜x is the principal solution. Observe that this construction of the principal solution is
based on the linearity of the solution space of (1.1).
Using the Wronskian identity, the principal solution ˜x of (1.1) is equivalently character-
ized as a solution satisfying
 ∞
dt
r(t)˜x2(t) = ∞.
(7.1)
Indeed, let y be a solution linearly independent of ˜x. Then by the previous argument y
˜x
tends monotonically to ∞as t →∞, hence
lim
t→∞
 t
ds
r(s)˜x2(s) = lim
t→∞
y(t)
˜x(t) = ∞.
(7.2)
Another characterization of the principal solution of (1.1) is via the eventually minimal
solution of the associated Riccati equation
w′ + c(t) + w2
r(t) = 0.
(7.3)
Let ˜x, x be linearly independent solutions of (1.1), the solution ˜x being principal, and
let ˜w = r ˜x′
˜x , w = rx′
x be the solutions of the associated Riccati equation. Without loss of
generality we may suppose that ˜x and x are eventually positive. We have
w(t) −˜w(t) = r(t)y′(t)
y(t)
−r(t)˜x′(t)
˜x(t)
= r(t)[x′(t)˜x(t) −˜x′(t)x(t)]
˜x(t)x(t)
.
The numerator of the last fraction is a constant and this constant is positive since we have
( x
˜x )′ = r[x′ ˜x−˜x′x]
r ˜x2
> 0 which follows from the fact that ˜x is the principal solution, i.e.,
x
˜x tends monotonically to ∞. Hence, the solution ˜w of the Riccati equation (7.3) given
by the principal solution of (1.1) is less than any other solution of (7.3) near ∞. Con-
versely, let ˜w = r ˜x′/˜x be the minimal solution of (2.1) and suppose that the solution ˜x
of (1.1) is not principal, i.e., the integral in (7.1) is convergent. Let T ∈R be such that
 ∞
T r−1(t)˜x−2(t)dt < 1 and consider the solution w of (7.3) given by the initial condition
w(T ) = ˜w(T ) −
1
2˜x2(T ). Put v = ˜x2( ˜w −w). Then v(T ) = 1
2 and by a direct computation
we have
v′ =
v2
r(t)˜x2(t).

Hence
v(t) =

 t
T r−1(s)˜x−2(s)ds
⩽
1
2 −
 ∞
T r−1(s)˜x−2(s)ds ⩽1.
This means that v is extensible up to ∞and hence w has the same property and at the same
time w(t) < ˜w(t). This contradiction shows that the eventual minimality of ˜w implies that
(7.1) holds, i.e., the associated solution ˜x of (0.1) is principal.
The last construction of the principal solution of (1.1) which we present here requires (in
addition to nonoscillation of (1.1)) the assumption that for any t0, the solution of (1.1) given
by the initial condition x(t0) = 0, x′(t0) ̸= 0 has a zero point rights of t0 (later we will show
that this assumption can be eliminated), we denote this zero point by η(t0). The function
η is nondecreasing according to the Sturmian theory, hence there exists limt→∞η(t) =: T
and T < ∞since we suppose that (1.1) is nonoscillatory. Now, the solution ˜x given by the
initial condition ˜x(T ) = 0, ˜x′(T ) ̸= 0 is the principal solution of (1.1). This construction is
used in the original paper of Leighton and Morse [148]. Concerning other papers dealing
with the principal solution of (1.1) and its properties we refer to [106] and the references
given therein.
7.2. Mirzov’s construction of the principal solution
This construction deﬁnes the principal solution of half-linear equation (0.1) via the mini-
mal solution of the associated Riccati equation (2.1). Nonoscillation of (0.1) implies that
there exist T ∈R and a solution ˆw of (2.1) which is deﬁned in the whole interval [T,∞),
i.e., such that (0.1) is disconjugate on [T,∞). Let d ∈(T,∞) and let wd be the solution
of (2.1) determined by the solution xd of (0.1) satisfying the initial condition x(d) = 0,
r(d)Φ(y′(d)) = −1. Then wd(d−) = −∞and wd(t) < ˆw(t) for t ∈(T,d). Moreover, if
T < d1 < d2 then
wd1(t) < wd2(t) < ˆw(t)
for t ∈(T,d1).
This implies that for t ∈(T,∞) there exists the limit w∞(t) := limd→∞wd(t) and
monotonicity of this convergence (with respect to the “subscript” variable) implies that
this convergence is uniform on every compact subinterval of [T,∞). Consequently, the
limit function w∞solves (2.1) as well and any solution w of this equation which is ex-
tensible up to ∞satisﬁes the inequality w(t) > w∞(t) near ∞. Indeed, if a solution ¯w
would satisfy the inequality ¯w(t) < w∞(t) on some interval (T1,∞), then for ¯t ∈(T1,∞)
and d sufﬁciently large we have ¯w(¯t) < wd(¯t) < w∞(¯t). But this contradicts the fact that
wd(d−) = −∞and that graphs of solutions of (2.1) cannot intersect (because of unique
solvability of this equation).
Now, having deﬁned the minimal solution w∞of (2.1), we deﬁne the principal solution
of (0.1) at ∞as the (nontrivial) solution of the ﬁrst order equation

REMARK 7.1. (i) Mirzov actually used in his paper [177] a slightly different approach
which can be brieﬂy explained as follows. Suppose that (0.1) is nonoscillatory and let ˆw
be a solution of the associated Riccati equation which exists on some interval [T,∞) and
let W := ˆw(T ). Denote by
W =

v ∈(−∞,W): the solution w of (2.1) given by the initial condition
w(T ) = v is not extensible up to ∞

,
i.e., W are initial values of solutions of (2.1) at t = T which blow down to −∞at some ﬁ-
nite time t > T . Note that the set W is nonempty what can be seen as follows. Let T1 > T
be arbitrary and consider a solution x of (0.1) given by x(T1) = 0, x′(T1) ̸= 0. Discon-
jugacy of (0.1) on [T,∞) implies that x(t) ̸= 0 on [T,T1) and the value of the associ-
ated solution of the Riccati equation w = rΦ(x′)
Φ(x) at t = T clearly belongs to W. Now, let
˜v := supW and let w∞be the solution of (2.1) given by the initial condition w(T ) = ˜v.
Then this solution is extensible up to ∞(supposing that this is not the case, we would get
a contradiction with the deﬁnition of the number ˜v) and the principal solution of (0.1) is
deﬁned again by (7.4) with w∞substituted for w.
(ii) Let b be a regular point of Equation (0.1) in the sense that for any A,B ∈R the
initial condition x(b) = A, r(b)Φ(x′(b)) = B determines uniquely a solution of (0.1). Let
xb be a solution given by xb(b) = 0, x′
b(b) ̸= 0. Replacing in the above construction the
point t = ∞by t = b, i.e., wb(t) := limd→b−wd(t), it not difﬁcult to see that wb = rΦ(x′
b)
Φ(xb) .
Consequently, what we call the principal solution xb of (0.1) at a regular point b ∈R is the
nontrivial solution satisfying the condition xb(b) = 0.
7.3. Construction of Elbert and Kusano
This construction was introduced (independently of Mirzov’s approach) in the paper [90]
and it is based on the half-linear Prüfer transformation.
Let (0.1) be nonoscillatory and let T be such that this equation is disconjugate on [T,∞).
Take a solution x which is positive on [T,∞). By the generalized Prüfer transformation
(see Section 1.3) this solution can be expressed in the form
x(t) = ρ(t)sinp ϕ(t),
rq−1(t)x′(t) = ρ(t)cosp ϕ(t),
(7.5)
where ρ is a positive function, the half-linear sine and cosine functions sinp, cosp were
deﬁned in Section 1.3 and the function ϕ is a solution of the ﬁrst order equation
ϕ′ = r1−q(t)


cosp ϕ(t)


p + c(t)
p −1


sinp ϕ(t)


p.
(7.6)

Half-linear differential equations
233
The fact that x(t) > 0 for t ∈[T,∞) implies that ϕ(t) ∈(kπp,(k + 1)πp) for some even
k ∈Z and without loss of generality we can suppose that k = −1. Now, let τ ∈(T,∞) and
let ϕτ be the solution of (7.6) given by the initial condition ϕτ(τ) = 0. Since any solution
of (7.6) satisﬁes ϕ′(t) > 0 whenever ϕ(t) = 0 (mod πp), the unique solvability of (7.6)
(compare again Section 1.3) implies that
ϕ(t) < ϕτ2(t) < ϕτ1(t)
for t ⩾T, whenever T < τ1 < τ2
(drawing a picture helps to visualize the situation). Consequently, the monotonicity of ϕτ
with respect to τ implies that there exists a ﬁnite limit
lim
τ→∞ϕτ(T ) = ϕ∗.
Now, the principal solution is the solution of (0.1) given by the initial condition
˜x(T ) = sinϕ∗,
˜x′(T ) = r1−q(T )cosp ϕ∗.
This means that we take ρ(T ) = 1 in the deﬁnition of ˜x, this can be done according to the
homogeneity of the solution space of (0.1).
THEOREM 7.1. A solution ˜x of a nonoscillatory equation (0.1) is principal in sense of
Mirzov’s construction if and only if it is principal in the sense of Elbert and Kusano.
PROOF. Let xτ be a nontrivial solution of (0.1) satisfying xτ(τ) = 0. This solution can be
expressed in the form
xτ(t) = ρ(t)sinp ϕτ(t),
rq−1(t)x′
τ(t) = ρ(t)cosp ϕτ(t),
where ϕτ is the solution of (7.6) satisfying ϕτ(τ) = 0. The corresponding solution of the
associated Riccati equation (2.1)
wτ(t) = r(t)Φ(x′
τ(t))
Φ(xτ(t))
= Φ

cotp ϕτ(t)

satisﬁes wτ(τ−) = −∞. The minimal solution of (2.1) (which deﬁnes the principal solu-
tion of (0.1) in Mirzov’s deﬁnition) is given by ˜w(t) = limτ→∞wτ(t), i.e., it is just the
solution satisfying ˜w(T ) = Φ(cotp ϕ∗) and this is the solution of Riccati equation (2.1)
given by the principal solution obtained by Elbert–Kusano’s construction.
□
We ﬁnish this subsection with some examples of equations whose principal solution can
be computed explicitly.
EXAMPLE 7.1. (i) Consider the one-term half-linear equation

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ = 0.
(7.7)

234
Half-linear differential equations
As we have mentioned in Section 4, the solution space of this equation is a two-dimensional
linear space with the basis x1(t) ≡1, x2(t) =  t r1−q(s)ds. The Riccati equation associ-
ated with (7.7) is w′ + (p −1)r1−q|w|q = 0 and the general solution of this equation is
w(t) =
1
Φ(C +
 t
T r1−q(s)ds)
,
w(t) ≡0.
(7.8)
If  ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, then by an easy computation one can verify that ˜w(t) ≡0 is the
eventually minimal solution of this equation and hence ˜x(t) = 1 is the principal solution
of (0.1). If
 ∞r1−q(t)dt < ∞, the eventually minimal solution of the Riccati equation
is w(t) = −

r1−q(s)ds is the principal solution of (0.1).
(ii) The nonoscillatory equation (Φ(x′))′ −(p −1)Φ(x) = 0 investigated in Section
4.1 has solutions x(t) = e±t and all other solutions are asymptotically equivalent to et.
Consequently, the solution ˜x(t) = e−t is the principal solution at ∞.
(iii) The Euler-type equation

x1(t) = eλ1t, x2(t) = eλ2t, where λ1 < λ2 are the roots of the algebraic equation (p −
1)[|λ|p −Φ(λ)]+γ = 0, are solutions of (7.9), and all other linearly independent solutions
are asymptotically equivalent to x2(t). Consequently, ˜x(t) = x1(t) = eλ1t.
7.4. Comparison theorem for eventually minimal solutions of Riccati equations
Similarly as in the linear case we have the following inequalities for solutions of a pair of
Riccati equations corresponding to nonoscillatory half-linear equations.
THEOREM 7.2. Consider a pair of half-linear equations (0.1), (2.13), and suppose that
(2.13) is a Sturmian majorant of (0.1) for large t, i.e., there exists T ∈R such that 0 <
R(t) ⩽r(t), c(t) ⩽C(t) for t ∈[T,∞). Suppose that the majorant equation (2.13) is
nonoscillatory and denote by ˜w, ˜v eventually minimal solutions of (2.1) and of
v′ + C(t) + (p −1)R1−q(t)|v|q = 0,
(7.10)
respectively. Then ˜w(t) ⩽˜v(t) for large t.
PROOF. Nonoscillation of (2.13) implies the existence of T ∈R such that ˜w and ˜v exist
on [T,∞). Suppose that there exists t1 ∈[T,∞) such that ˜w(t1) > ˜v(t1). Let w be the so-
lution of (2.1) given by the initial condition w(t1) = ˜v(t1). Then according to the standard

Half-linear differential equations
235
theorem on differential inequalities (see, e.g., [145]) we have w(t) ⩾˜v(t) for t ⩾t1, i.e., w
is extensible up to ∞. At the same time w(t) < ˜w(t) for t ⩾t1 since graphs of solutions of
(2.1) cannot intersect (because of the unique solvability). But this contradicts the eventual
minimality of ˜w.
□
In some oscillation criteria, we will need the following immediate consequence of the
previous theorem.
COROLLARY 7.1. Let  ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, c(t) ⩾0 for large t and suppose that (0.1)
is nonoscillatory. Then the eventually minimal solution of the associated Riccati equation
(2.1) satisﬁes ˜w(t) ⩾0 for large t.
PROOF. Under the assumptions of corollary, (0.1) is the majorant of the one-term equa-
tion (r(t)Φ(y′))′ = 0. Since
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, ˜y ≡1 is the principal solution of this
equation (compare Example 7.1). Hence ˜v(t) = 0 is the eventually minimal solution of the
associated Riccati equation which implies the required statement.
□
7.5. Sturmian property of the principal solution
In this short subsection we brieﬂy show that the principal solution of (0.1) has a Sturmian-
type property and that the largest zero point of this solution (if any) behaves like the left
conjugate point of ∞, in a certain sense.
THEOREM 7.3. Suppose that Equation (0.1) is nonoscillatory and its principal solution
˜x has a zero point and let T be the largest of them. Further suppose that Equation (2.13)
is a Sturmian majorant of (0.1) on [T,∞), i.e., 0 < R(t) ⩽r(t) and C(t) ⩾c(t) for t ∈
[T,∞). Then any solution y of (2.13) has a zero point in (T,∞) or it is a constant multiple
of ˜x. The latter possibility is excluded if one of the inequalities between r,R and c,C,
respectively, is strict on an interval of positive length.
PROOF. If (2.13) is oscillatory, the statement of theorem trivially holds, so suppose that
(2.13) is nonoscillatory and let ˜y be its principal solution. Denote by ˜w and ˜v the minimal
solutions of corresponding Riccati equations (2.1) and (7.10), respectively. According to
the comparison theorem for minimal solutions of Riccati equations presented in the previ-
ous subsection, we have ˜w(t) ⩾˜v(t) on the interval of existence of ˜w. Since we suppose
that ˜x(T ) = 0, this implies that ˜w(T +) = ∞, so the interval of existence of ˜v must be a
subinterval of [T,∞), say [T1,∞), i.e., T1 is the largest zero of the principal solution ˜y of
(2.13). If one of the inequalities between r,R and c,C is strict it can be shown that the pos-
sibility T = T1 is excluded. Now let y be any nontrivial solution of (2.13). If y(t) ̸= 0 for
t ∈[T1,∞), then the associated solution v = RΦ(y′)/Φ(y) exists on [T1,∞) and satisﬁes
there the inequality v(t) < ˜v(t) on [T1,∞) (since ˜v(T1+) = ∞and v(T −) < ∞) and this
a contradiction with minimality of ˜v.
□
REMARK 7.2. (i) If T is the largest zero of the principal solution ˜x of (0.1), i.e., the same
as in the previous theorem, and suppose that R(t) = r(t) and C(t) = c(t) for t ∈[T,∞).

236
Half-linear differential equations
Then Theorem 7.3 shows that T plays the role of the left conjugate point of ∞in the sense
that any nonprincipal solution of (0.1), i.e., a solution linearly independent of ˜x, has exactly
one zero in (T,∞). Note that the fact that this zero is exactly one (and not more) follows
from the classical Sturm separation theorem (Theorem 2.3).
(ii) In Remark 2.2 we have pointed out that the disconjugacy of (0.1) on a bounded
interval I = [a,b] (which, by deﬁnition, means that the solution x given by x(a) = 0,
x′(a) ̸= 0 has no zero in (a,b]) is actually equivalent to the existence of a solution without
any zero in [a,b]. Theorem 7.3 shows that we have the same situation with unbounded
intervals or an interval whose endpoints are singular points of (0.1). For example, if I =
R = (−∞,∞), then disconjugacy of (0.1) on this interval (deﬁned as disconjugacy on
[−T,T ] for every T > 0) is equivalent to the existence of a solution without any zero on
R, the solution having this property is, e.g., the principal solution (at ∞).
7.6. Integral characterization of the principal solution
Among all (equivalent) characterizations of the principal solution of linear equation (1.1),
the most suitable seems be the integral one (7.1), since it needs to know just only one
solution and according to the divergence/convergence of the characterizing integral it is
possible to decide whether or not it is the principal solution. The remaining characteriza-
tions require to know other solutions since they are of comparison type. In the linear case,
this is not serious disadvantage because of the reductions of order formula which enables
to compute all solutions (at least locally) of the linear second order equation when one
solution is already known. However, in the half-linear case we have no reduction of order
formula as pointed in Section 3, so some kind of the integral characterization would be
very useful. In the next theorem we present one candidate for the integral characterization
of the principal solution of (0.1). The parts (i), (ii) and (iii) are proved in [66] and the part
(iv) in [36].
THEOREM 7.4. Suppose that Equation (0.1) is nonoscillatory and ˜x is its solution such
that ˜x′(t) ̸= 0 for large t.
(i) Let p ∈(1,2). If
I(˜x) :=
 ∞
dt
r(t)˜x2(t)|˜x′(t)|p−2 = ∞,
(7.11)
then ˜x is the principal solution.
(ii) Let p > 2. If ˜x is the principal solution then (7.11) holds.
(iii) Suppose that
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, the function γ (t) :=
 ∞
t
c(s)ds exists and
γ (t) ⩾0, but γ (t) ̸≡0 eventually. Then ˜x(t) is the principal solution if and only if
(7.11) holds.
(iv) Let c(t) > 0 for large t,
 ∞r1−q(t)dt < ∞,
 ∞c(t)dt = ∞. Then ˜x(t) is the
principal solution if and only if (7.11) holds.
PROOF. (i) Suppose, by contradiction, that a (positive) solution x of (0.1) satisfying (7.11)
is not principal. Then the corresponding solution wx = rΦ(x′/x) of the associated Ric-

Half-linear differential equations
237
cati equation (2.1) is not eventually minimal. Hence, there exists another nonoscillatory
solution y of (0.1) such that
wy = rΦ(y′/y) < wx
eventually.

Consequently, 1
2 ⩽f (t) ⩽1 and f (t) can be continued to ∞, hence ¯w(t) is a continuable
up to inﬁnity solution of (2.1) and ¯w(t) < ˜w(t) for t ⩾T , i.e., ˜w(t) is not minimal. Thus,
the solution ˜x(t) is not principal, which was to be proved.
(iii) The principal solution ˜x(t) of (0.1) is associated with the minimal solution ˜w(t)
of (2.1) and hence it is also the minimal solution of the Riccati integral equation (the
convergence of  ∞r1−q(t)|w(t)|q dt follows from Theorem 5.6)
˜w(t) = γ (t) + (p −1)

and by the assumptions on γ (t), there exists T ∈R such that ˜w(t) > 0 for t ⩾T . Since ˜w
is the minimal solution, for any other proper solution w of (2.1) we have w(t) > ˜w(t) > 0
for t ⩾T1 ⩾T , and hence the associated solutions x(t) and ˜x(t) satisfy the inequalities
x′(t) > 0, ˜x′(t) > 0 for t ⩾T1.
Now the proof goes in different way according to 1 < p < 2 or p ⩾2.
Case A: 1 < p < 2. By the part (i) it is sufﬁcient to show that the integral in (7.11) is
really divergent. Suppose the contrary, i.e.,
 ∞

r(t)˜x2(t)|˜x′(t)|p−2 < ∞.

Let T2 ⩾T1 be chosen so large that

and accordingly, the function f (t) be deﬁned by
f (t) = ˜xp(t)

Clearly, f (T2) = 1

consequently, 1

¯w(t) < ˜w(t), i.e., ˜w(t) is not minimal solution of (2.1), hence ˜x(t) is not the principal
solution, and this contradiction proves the ﬁrst case.
Case B: p ⩾2. By the claim (ii) it is sufﬁcient to show that if the solution x is not prin-
cipal then the corresponding integral in (7.11) is convergent. Let w(t) = r(t)Φ(x′(t)/x(t))
be the associated solution of (2.1). Then w(t) is not minimal solution of (2.1) and let ˜w(t)
be the minimal solution of this equation. Then we have w(t) > ˜w(t) for t ⩾T2 with T2
sufﬁciently large. Consider the function f (t) given again by
f (t) = xp(t)

(iv) Concerning the proof of the part (iv), this proof is based on the statement which re-
lates the principal solution of (0.1) to the principal solution of the reciprocal equation (6.1),
we refer to [36] for details.
□
REMARK 7.3. The equivalent integral characterization of the principal solution of (0.1) is
stated in the parts (iii) and (iv) of the previous theorem is proved under some restriction
on the functions r,c in (0.1). In order to better understand these restrictions, the concept of
the regular half-linear equation has been introduced in [72] as follows. A nonoscillatory
equation (0.1) is said to be regular if there exists a constant K ⩾0 such that
limsup
t→∞




w1(t)
w2(t)




 ⩽K
for any pair of solutions w1,w2 of the associated Riccati equation (2.1) such that w2(t) >
w1(t) eventually. It was shown that for regular half-linear equation (7.11) holds if and only
if the solution ˜x is principal and that under assumptions of (iii) and (iv) of the previous
theorem equation (0.1) is regular.
7.7. Another integral characterization
The integral characterization (7.11) of the principal solution of (0.1) reduces to the usual
integral characterization of the principal solution of linear equation (7.1) if p = 2. How-
ever, this characterization applies in case p > 2 only to solutions x for which x′(t) ̸= 0
eventually. Moreover, in [36,37] examples of half-linear equations are given which show
that if assumptions of the parts (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 7.4 are violated, (7.11) is no longer
equivalent characterization of the principal solution of (0.1). For this reason, another in-
tegral characterization was suggested and the following statement is proved. The proof of
this statement can be found in the above mentioned [36,37].
THEOREM 7.5. Suppose that either
(i) c(t) < 0 for large t, or
(ii) c(t) > 0 for large t and both integrals  ∞r1−q(t)dt,  ∞c(t)dt are convergent.
Then a solution ˜x of (0.1) is principal if and only if
 ∞
dt
rq−1(t)˜x2(t) = ∞.

7.8. Limit characterization of the principal solution
The “most characteristic” property of the principal solution in the linear case is the limit
characterization (7.2). It was proved in the above mentioned papers [36,37] that this limit
characterization extends under the assumption that c(t) ̸= 0 eventually also to half-linear
equation (0.1). This statement has been proved in [36] in case c(t) < 0 and in [37] for
c(t) > 0.
THEOREM 7.6. Suppose that (0.1) is nonoscillatory and c(t) ̸= 0 for large t. Then a solu-
tion ˜x is principal if and only if the limit characterization (7.2) holds for every solution x
linearly independent of ˜x.
PROOF. The proof is based on the detailed asymptotic analysis of solutions of (0.1) made
in the previous section. Since this analysis is rather complicated, we refer to the above
mentioned papers [36,37] for details.
□
8. Conjugacy and disconjugacy of half-linear equations
Recall that similarly as in case of linear equations, Equation (0.1) is said to be disconjugate
in a given interval I if every nontrivial solution of this equation has at most one zero in I,
in the opposite case, i.e., if there exists a nontrivial solution of (0.1) having at least two
zeros in I, Equation (0.1) is said to be conjugate in I.
In this section we will present criteria for conjugacy and disconjugacy of equation (0.1).
Some theoretical criteria of this kind have been already formulated in the previous sections
and are essentially involved in the Theorem 2.2. For example, the existence of a solution
w of Riccati equation (2.1) associated with (0.1) is a sufﬁcient condition for disconjugacy
of this equation in the interval of the existence of this solution w. Another criteria can be
formulated as consequences of the Sturmian comparison theorem.
8.1. Leighton’s conjugacy criterion
Consider a pair of half-linear differential equations (0.1) and (2.13). If (2.13) is a Sturmian
minorant of (0.1) on I = [a,b] and (2.13) is conjugate on this interval, then majorant
equation (0.1) is conjugate on [a,b] as well. In the next theorem we replace the pointwise
comparison of coefﬁcients by the integral one. In the linear case p = 2 this statement was
proved by Leighton [147], the half-linear version of this statement given here can be found
in [115].
THEOREM 8.1. Suppose that points a,b are conjugate relative to (2.13) and let y be a
nontrivial solution of this equation for which y(a) = 0 = y(b). If
J (y;a,b) :=
 b
a
r(t) −R(t)|y′|p −c(t) −C(t)|y|pdt ⩽0,
(8.1)

242
Half-linear differential equations
then (0.1) is also conjugate in [a,b].
PROOF. We have (with the notation introduced in Theorem 2.2)
F(y;a,b) =
 b

r(t)|y′|p −c(t)|y|pdt
=

hence (0.1) is conjugate on [a,b] by Theorem 2.2.
□
8.2. Singular Leighton’s theorem
In this subsection we show that if the points a,b are singular points of considered equa-
tions, in particular, a = −∞, b = ∞(or ﬁnite singularities, i.e., points where the unique
solvability is violated), Leighton-type comparison theorem still holds if we replace the
solution satisfying y(a) = 0 = y(b) by the principal solution at a and b. We formulate
the statement in a simpliﬁed form, as can be found in [59], a more general formulation is
presented in [67].
THEOREM 8.2. Suppose that ˜c is a continuous function such that the equation
r(t)Φ(y′)′ + ˜c(t)Φ(y) = 0
(8.2)
has the property that the principal solutions at a and b coincide and denote by h this
simultaneous principal solution at these points. If



h(t)


p dt ⩾0,
c(t) ̸≡˜c(t) in (a,b),
(8.3)
then (0.1) is conjugate in I = (a,b), i.e., there exists a nontrivial solution of this equation
having at least two zeros in I.
PROOF. Our proof is based on the relationship between nonpositivity of the energy func-
tional F and conjugacy of (0.1) given in Theorem 2.2. We construct a nontrivial function
piecewise of the class C1, with a compact support in I, such that F(y;a,b) < 0.
Continuity of the functions c, ˜c and (8.3) imply the existence of ¯t ∈I and d,ϱ > 0 such
that (c(t)−˜c(t))|h(t)|p > d for (¯t −ϱ, ¯t +ϱ). Let Δ be any positive differentiable function

with the compact support in (¯t −ϱ, ¯t + ϱ). Further, let a < t0 < t1 < ¯t −ϱ < ¯t + ϱ < t2 <
t3 < b and let f,g be the solutions of (8.2) satisfying the boundary conditions
f (t0) = 0,
f (t1) = h(t1),
g(t2) = h(t2),
g(t3) = 0.
Note that such solutions exist if t0,t1 and t2,t3 are sufﬁciently close to a and b, respectively,
due to nonoscillation of (8.2) near a and b (this is implied by the existence of principal so-
lutions at these points) and the fact that the solution space of this equation is homogeneous.

8.3. Lyapunov inequality

PROOF. According to homogeneity of the solution space of (0.1), we can suppose that
x(t) > 0 on (a,b). Let c ∈(a,b) be the least point of the local maximum of x in (a,b),
i.e., x′(c) = 0 and x′(t) > 0 on [a,c). By the Hölder inequality we have

REMARK 8.1. Note that the Lyapunov-type inequality was proved for the ﬁrst time in [85]
for (0.1) with r(t) ≡1, but the extension to general (0.1) is straightforward. Half-linear
Lyapunov inequality has been rediscovered in several later papers, e.g., in [154,224].
8.4. Vallée Poussin-type inequality
Another important inequality concerning disconjugacy of the linear differential equation
x′′ + a(t)x′ + b(t)x = 0
(8.6)
was introduced by Valleé Poussin [214] in 1929 and reads as follows. Suppose that t1 < t2
are consecutive zeros of a nontrivial solution x of (8.6), then
2

dt
t2 + At + B ⩽t2 −t1,
A := max
t∈[t1,t2]


a(t)


, B := max
t∈[a,b]


b(t)


.
The half-linear version of this criterion can be found in [68]. Here we formulate this cri-
terion in a simpliﬁed form, to underline similarity with the original criterion of Vallée
Poussin. For the same reason we consider the equation

Φ(x′)
′ + a(t)Φ(x′) + b(t)Φ(x) = 0
(8.7)
instead of (0.1) (if the function r in (0.1) is differentiable, then this equation can be easily
reduced to (8.7)).

(8.7). Then

PROOF. Suppose that x(t) > 0 in (t1,t2), in case x(t) < 0 in (t1,t2) the proof is analogical.
Let c,d ∈(t1,t2), c ⩽d, be the least and the greatest points of the local maximum of x in
(a,b), respectively, i.e., x′(t) > 0 for t ∈(t1,c), x′(t) < 0 for t ∈(d,t2) and x′(c) = 0 =
x′(d). The Riccati variable v = Φ(x′)
Φ(x) satisﬁes v(t1+) = ∞, v(c) = 0, v(t) > 0, t ∈(t1,c)
and
v′ = −b(t) −a(t)v −(p −1)vq ⩾−B −Av −(p −1)vq.
(8.9)
Hence,
 ∞

(p −1)vq + Av + B ⩽c −t1.
(8.10)
Concerning the interval (d,t2), we set v = −Φ(x′)
Φ(x) > 0 for t ∈(d,t2) and similarly as for
t ∈(t1,c) we have
 ∞
0
dv
(p −1)vq + Av + B ⩽t2 −d.

(p −1)vq + Av + B ⩽c −t1 + t2 −d ⩽t2 −t1,
what we needed to prove.
□
REMARK 8.2. (i) Since (8.8) is a necessary condition for conjugacy of (8.7) in [t1,t2], the
opposite inequality is a disconjugacy criterion: if
2
 ∞
0
dv
(p −1)vq + Av + B > t2 −t1,
then (8.7) is disconjugate in [t1,t2].
(ii) A more general Riccati substitution v = α(t) Φ(x′)
Φ(x) , t ∈(t1,c], v = −β(t) Φ(x′)
Φ(x) , t ∈
[d,t2), where α,β are suitable positive functions, enables to formulate the Vallée Poussin-
type criterion in a more general form than presented in Theorem 8.4, we refer to [68] for
details. Concerning the various extensions of the linear Vallée Poussin criterion we refer to
the survey paper [14] and the references given therein.
8.5. Focal point criteria
Recall that a point b is said to be the ﬁrst right focal point of c < b with respect to (0.1) if
there exists a nontrivial solution x of this equation such that x′(c) = 0 = x(b) and x(t) ̸= 0
for t ∈[c,b). The ﬁrst left focal point a of c is deﬁned similarly by x(a) = 0 = x′(c),

250
Half-linear differential equations
x(t) ̸= 0 on (a,c]. Equation (0.1) is said to be right disfocal on [c,b) if there exists no
right focal point of c relative to (0.1) in (c,b), the left disfocality on (a,c] is deﬁned in a
similar way. Consequently, (0.1) is conjugate on an interval (a,b) if there exists c ∈(a,b)
such that this equation is neither right disfocal on [c,b) nor left disfocal on (a,c]. This
idea is illustrated in the next statement for (6.16) considered on (a,b) = (−∞,∞), see
[65]. The extension of this statement to general half-linear equation (0.1) is immediate.
THEOREM 8.5. Suppose that the function c(t) ̸≡0 for t ∈(0,∞) and there exist constants
α ∈(−1

Then the solution x of (6.16) satisfying the initial conditions x(0) = 1, x′(0) ⩽0 has a
zero in (0,∞).
PROOF. Suppose, by contradiction, that the solution x has no zero on (0,∞), i.e., x(t) > 0.
Let w = −Φ(x′)
Φ(x) be the solution of the Riccati equation
w′ = c(t) + (p −1)r1−q(y)|w|q.

Here we need the relation G(t) > 0 for sufﬁciently large t. By (8.14) G(t) is nondecreasing
function of t and G(0) = 0. The equality G(t) = 0 for all t ⩾0 would imply that w(t) ≡0,
consequently by (8.14) x′(t) ≡0 for t ⩾0. But this may happen only if c(t) ≡0, which
case has been excluded. Hence we may suppose that T is already chosen so large that the
inequality G(t) > 0 holds for t ⩾T .
Denote β = α −(1 + pα) q
p and K = (p −1)(1 + pα)
q
p > 0. Then by (8.14) the last

The results of Section 9.2 of the next chapter suggest to use a more general weight func-
tions. This research is a subject of the present investigation. The same remark essentially
concerns also the results of Section 9.5.
Using the just established focal point criterion we can prove the following conjugacy
criterion for (6.16).

THEOREM 8.6. Suppose that c(t) ̸≡0 both in (−∞,0) and (0,∞) and there exist con-

(8.16)
Then Equation (6.16) is conjugate in R, more precisely, there exists a solution of (6.16)
having at least one positive and one negative zero.
PROOF. The statement follows immediately from Theorem 8.5 since by this theorem the
solution x given by x(0) = 1, x′(0) = 0 has a positive zero. Using the same argument as in
Theorem 8.5 and the second condition in (8.16) we can show the existence of a negative
zero.

This conjugacy criterion for the linear Sturm–Liouville equation (1.1) with r(t) ≡1 is
proved in [212] and the extension to (6.16) can be found in [188].
(ii) Several conjugacy criteria for linear equation (1.1) (in terms of its coefﬁcients r,c)
are proved using the fact that this equation is conjugate on (a,b) if and only if
 b

(8.18)
for any pair of solutions of (1.1) for which r(x′

2) ≡±1. This statement is based on
the trigonometric transformation of (1.1), see [55,56] and also Section 3. However, since
we have in disposal no half-linear analogue of the trigonometric transformation, conjugacy
criteria of this kind for (0.1) are (till now) missing.
8.6. Lyapunov-type focal points and conjugacy criteria
The results of this section can be found in [111,188] and concern again equation (6.16).
THEOREM 8.7. Let x be a nontrivial solution of (6.16) satisfying x′(d) = 0 = x(b) and
x(t) ̸= 0 for t ∈[d,b). Then
(b −d)p−1 sup

Moreover, if there is no extreme value of x in (d,b), then
(b −d)p−1 sup
d⩽t⩽b
 t

(8.20)
PROOF. Suppose that x(t) > 0 on [d,b), if x(t) < 0 we proceed in the same way. Let
v = −Φ(x′)
Φ(x) and V (t) = (p −1)

v(t) =

Thus, v(d) = 0 = V (d) and limt→b−v(t) = limt→b−V (t) = ∞. Set
C∗:= sup
d⩽t⩽b

q ⩽(p −1)C∗+ V (t)q,
and
V ′(t)

Integrating this inequality from d to b and using limt→b−V (t) = ∞, we obtain

which implies that (b −d)p−1C∗⩽1. We remark that the equality cannot hold, for oth-
erwise |C(t)| = |
 t
d c(s)ds| = C∗on [d,b) which implies that c(t) ≡0, a contradiction,
thus (8.19) holds.
If d is the largest extreme point of x in (a,b), then x′(t) ⩽0 and hence v(t) ⩾0 on
[d,b). Set C∗= supd⩽t⩽b
 t
d c(s)ds. Then we also have C∗> 0 since the assumption
C∗⩽0 contradicts to V (d) = 0, limt→b−V (t) = ∞. Hence, by (8.21), 0 ⩽v(t) ⩽C∗+
V (t). The remaining part of the proof is similar to the ﬁrst one.

CHAPTER 3C
Oscillatory Equations
In this chapter we start with oscillation criteria for half-linear equation (0.1). Some basic
oscillation criteria have already been formulated in previous chapters, here we focus our
attention to “more advanced criteria”. By this we mean half-linear extensions of linear
oscillation criteria which are not given in standard books on linear oscillation, e.g., in
[208]. Section 10 is devoted to results which are not exactly oscillation criteria, but are
closely related to oscillation theory. Section 11 deals with the half-linear Sturm–Liouville
problem and the last section of this chapter, entitled “Perturbation principle”, presents a
new method of the investigation of oscillatory properties of (0.1), where this equation is
viewed as a perturbation of another equation of the same form.
9. Oscillation criteria
Similarly to nonoscillation criteria, the basic tools in proofs of oscillation criteria are the
variational principle and the Riccati technique. However, as we will see in this and the next
section, the Riccati technique is used more frequently.
9.1. General observations
In this section we present criteria which complete nonoscillation criteria given in Section 5.
We start with some general observations.
(i) If  ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞in (0.1), then this equation can be transformed into the equation

Φ(x′)
′ + c(t)Φ(x) = 0
(9.1)
and this transformation transforms the interval [T,∞) into an interval of the same form.
For this reason, we will formulate sometimes our results for (9.1) (mainly in situations
when these results were ﬁrst established for (1.1) with r(t) ≡1 in linear case), the extension
to (0.1) with
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞is then straightforward.
(ii) If we suppose that c(t) > 0 for large t in (9.1), the situation is considerably simpler
than in the general case when c is allowed to change its sign. In case c(t) > 0, Equation
(9.1) is the Sturmian majorant of the equation (Φ(x′))′ = 0 and the minimal solution of the
associated Riccati equation
v′ + (p −1)|v|q = 0
255

256
Half-linear differential equations
is v(t) ≡0. This means, in view of Theorem 7.2, that the minimal solution of the Riccati
equation
w′ + c(t) + (p −1)|w|q = 0
(9.2)
associated with (9.1) is positive and this implies that positive solutions of (9.1) are increas-
ing. Consequently, in oscillation criteria for (9.1) proved via the Riccati technique, it is
sufﬁcient to impose such conditions on the function c that for any T ∈R the solution given
by x(T ) = 0, x′(T ) > 0 has eventually negative derivative x′(t). Indeed, this means that the
associated solution of (9.2) is eventually negative, hence less than minimal solution which
is nonnegative (compare Theorem 7.2 and Corollary 7.1) and hence cannot be extensible
up to ∞which implies that x has a zero point in [T,∞).
9.2. Coles-type criteria
The results of this subsection are taken from the paper [153] and concern the half-linear
extension of the averaging technique introduced in the linear case by Coles in [46]. The
results are formulated for (9.1).
Let J be the class of nonnegative locally integrable functions f deﬁned on [0,∞) and
satisfying the condition
limsup
t→∞
 t
0
f (s)ds
q−1−μFμ(∞) −Fμ(t) > 0
(9.3)
for some μ ∈[0,q −1), where
Fμ(t) =
 t
0
f (s)
(
 s
0 f (ξ)dξ)μ
(
 s
0 f p(ξ)dξ)q−1 ds.
If Fμ(∞) = ∞, then f ∈J . Let J0 be the subclass of J consisting of nonnegative locally
integrable functions f satisfying
lim
t→∞
 t
0 f p(s)ds
(
 t
0 f (s)ds)p = 0.
(9.4)
Observe that if (9.3) or (9.4) holds, then
 ∞
f (t)dt = ∞.
(9.5)
On the other hand, every bounded nonnegative locally integrable function satisfying (9.5)
belongs to J0 and J0 ⊂J . Since all nonnegative polynomials are in J0, this class of
functions contains also unbounded functions. Elements of J and J0 will be called weight
functions.

For f ∈J , we deﬁne
Af (s,t) :=
 t
s f (τ)
 τ
s c(μ)dμdτ
 t
s f (τ)dτ
.
The following statement reduces to the Hartman–Wintner theorem (Theorem 5.6) when
the weight function f is f (t) ≡1.
THEOREM 9.1. Suppose that (9.1) is nonoscillatory.
(i) If there exists f ∈J such that for some T ∈R
liminf
t→∞Af (T,t) > −∞
(9.6)
then
 ∞

w(t)


q dt < ∞
(9.7)
for every solution w of the associated Riccati equation (9.2).
(ii) Assume that (9.7) holds for some solution w of (9.2). Then for every f ∈J0 and
T ∈R sufﬁciently large limt→∞Af (T,t) exists ﬁnite.
PROOF. The proof of this statement copies essentially the proof of Theorem 5.6.
(i) Assume, by contradiction, that
 ∞

integral equation by f (t) and then integrating again from ξ to t, we obtain

This completes the proof.
□
As a consequence of the previous statement we have the following oscillation criterion
which is the half-linear extension of the criterion of Coles [46], this statement can be also
viewed as an extension of Theorem 5.7.
THEOREM 9.2. The following statements hold:
(i) If there exists f ∈J such that (9.6) holds, then either (9.1) is oscillatory, or
limt→∞Ag(·,t) exists ﬁnite for every g ∈J0.
(ii) If there exist two nonnegative bounded functions f,g on an interval [T,∞) satisfy-
ing
 ∞f (t)dt = ∞=
 ∞g(t)dt such that
lim
t→∞Af (T,t) < lim
t→∞Ag(T,t),
then Equation (9.1) is oscillatory.
PROOF. (i) Suppose that (9.1) is nonoscillatory. Then by Theorem 9.1 every solution of the
associated Riccati equation (9.2) satisﬁes
 ∞|w(t)|q dt < ∞and hence limt→∞Ag(·,t)
exists ﬁnite for every g ∈J0.
(ii) Let α,β ∈R be such that
lim
t→∞Af (T,t) < α < β < lim
t→∞Ag(T,t).
Let h(t) = g(t) for T ⩽t ⩽t1, where t1 is determined such that Ag(T,t1) ⩾β and
 t1
T g(s)ds ⩾1. Let h(t) = f (t) for t1 ⩽t2 where t2 is determined such that Ah(T,t2) ⩽α
and  t1
T h(s)ds ⩾2. This is possible because
Ah(T,t2) =
 t2
T h(s)
 s
T c(τ)dτ ds
 t2

 t1
T g(s)ds +
 t2
t1 f (s)ds
= Af (T,t2)1 + o(1) + o(1),
as t2 →∞. Continuing in this manner, we obtain a nonnegative and bounded function h
deﬁned on [T,∞) such that
limsup
t→∞
Ah(T,t) ⩾β > α ⩾liminf
t→∞Ah(T,t).
Hence, by the part (i), Equation (9.1) is oscillatory.

9.3. Generalized Hartman–Wintner’s criterion

= ∞.
In this subsection we present one extension of this criterion which was established in [51].
In agreement with the remark from the introduction of this section, we formulate this cri-
terion for (9.1). For the sake of convenience, similarly as in the original paper [51], we
introduce the linear operator A : C[0,∞) →C[0,∞) deﬁned by
(Af )(t) := 1
t
 t
0
f (s)ds,
(Af )(0) := 0.
(9.16)
By An we denote the nth iteration of A.
THEOREM 9.3. Let C(t) :=
 t
0 c(s)ds. If there exists n ∈N such that
−∞< liminf

AnC(t) < limsup
t→∞
AnC(t),
(9.17)
or
lim
t→∞

AnC

(t) = ∞
(9.18)
then (9.1) is oscillatory.
PROOF. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.6 and of Theorem 5.7. Suppose, by
contradiction, that (9.1) is nonoscillatory and let w be a solution of the associated Riccati
equation (9.2). For convenience, we suppose that this solution is deﬁned on [0,∞), this
is no loss of generality since the lower integration limit 0 in the next computation can be
replaced by any T sufﬁciently large. Integrating Equation (9.2) from 0 to t we get
w(t) −w(0) + C(t) + (p −1)
 t

Half-linear differential equations
Each of the conditions (i), (ii) implies the existence of K ⩾0 such that (AnC)(t) ⩾−K
for large t. This implies that
 ∞|w(t)|q dt < ∞. The proof of this claim goes by contra-
diction in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 5.6. Having proved the convergence
of
 ∞|w(t)|q dt, again in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 5.6 we prove that
limt→∞(AnC)(t) exists ﬁnite, a contradiction with (i) or (ii).
□
The following example, taken again from [51], presents a construction of the function
c for which the classical Hartman–Wintner criterion (i.e., the case n = 1 in the previous
theorem) does not apply, while the previous theorem with n = 2 does.
EXAMPLE 9.1. Let {an}∞
n=1, {bn}∞
n=1 be two sequences of real numbers deﬁned by an =
n−2−n, bn = n+2−n, n ∈N. Let {gn}∞
n=1 denote a sequence of functions gn :[0,∞) →R
of the class C2 such that gn(t) > 0 if t ∈(an,bn) and gn(t) = 0 otherwise. We also ask that
 ∞
0
gn(t)dt = n.
(9.21)
Next deﬁne g :[0,∞) →R by
g(t) =
∞

n=1
(−1)ngn(t).
(9.22)
The function g is also of the class C2 and using this function we deﬁne
c(t) = tg(t)′′,
C(t) :=
 t
0
c(s)ds.
(9.23)
The reason for deﬁning c in this form is two-fold. On one hand, from (9.23) we ﬁnd that
(AC)(t) = 1
t
 t
0
 s
0
c(τ)dτ = g(t),
(9.24)
and from (9.21) and the mean value theorem
max
t∈[0,∞)gn(t) ⩾n2n−1.
(9.25)
Thus, from (9.24) and (9.25) we obtain liminft→∞(AC)(t) = −∞, so the Hartman–
Wintner theorem does not apply. Let us consider p = 2 for a moment (so we actually
consider the linear equation) in (9.1) and we note that the Lebesgue measure of the set
{t|  t
0 c(s)ds ̸= 0} is ﬁnite. This implies that
lim
t→∞approx
 t
0
c(s)ds = 0,

Half-linear differential equations
263
so the criterion of Olech, Opial and Wazewski [185] does not apply either. Recall that
lim
t→∞approxf (t) = l
if and only if, by deﬁnition,
l = supℓ: mt: f (t) > ℓ = ∞ = infℓ: mt: f (t) < ℓ = ∞.
Here m{·} denoted the Lebesgue measure of the set indicated. Recall also that the oscilla-
tion criterion of [185] states that the equation x′′ + c(t)x = 0 is oscillatory provided
lim
t→∞approx
 t
0
c(s)ds = ∞.
Nevertheless, by Theorem 9.3, Equation (9.1) with any p > 1 is oscillatory. Indeed,
from (9.25) we have limsupt→∞(AC)(t) = ∞. Also, for t ∈(bn,an+1) = (n + 2−n,n +
1 −2−(n+1)), we have

A2C

(t) =
 n
2t ,
n even,
−(n+1)
2t
,
n odd.
From the last equality can be easily shown that (A2C)(t) is bounded for t ∈(0,∞). Hence
from (9.17) Equation (9.1) is oscillatory.
9.4. Generalized Kamenev criterion
The classical Kamenev criterion concerns the linear equation x′′ + c(t)x = 0 and claims
that this equation is oscillatory provided there exists λ > 1 such that
limsup
t→∞
1
tλ
 t
0
(t −s)λc(s)ds = ∞.
(9.26)
The following half-linear extension concerns general half-linear equation (0.1) and it is
taken from [150].
THEOREM 9.4. Suppose that there exists λ > p −1 such that

ds = ∞.
(9.27)
Then (0.1) is oscillatory.

264
Half-linear differential equations
PROOF. Suppose that (0.1) is nonoscillatory, i.e., there exists a solution of the associated
Riccati equation (2.1). Multiplying this equation by (t −s)λ and integrating it from T to t,
T sufﬁciently large, we get

which is the half-linear extension of the classical Kamenev linear oscillation criterion.
9.5. Another reﬁnement of the Hartman–Wintner theorem
The results formulated here are taken from [122], where the equation
x′′ + c(t)|x|p−1|x′|2−p sgnx = 0
(9.29)

Half-linear differential equations
265
with p ∈(1,2] is considered. Related results on Equation (9.29) can be found also in [42,
162]. Equation of the form (9.29) can be obtained from (9.1) using the identity
Φ(x′)′ = (p −1)x′′|x′|p−2,
so the results of this subsection apply also to (9.1) as noted in [122, Sec. 2]. We prefer here
the original formulation to illustrate the variety of approaches to half-linear oscillation
theory.

Using essentially the same idea as in the proofs of Theorems 5.6 and 5.7 the following
statement is proved.
THEOREM 9.5. Let either limt→∞cp(t) = ∞or
−∞< liminf
t→∞cp(t) < limsup
t→∞
cp(t).
Then Equation (9.29) is oscillatory.
Consequently, in the next investigation we suppose
lim
t→∞cp(t) =: cp(∞)
(9.30)
exists ﬁnite. The following theorem shows that (9.1) is oscillatory if cp(t) does not tend to
its limit too rapidly.

solution of the associated Riccati equation
w′ + (p −1)c(t) + (p −1)|w|q = 0.
Integrating this equation from t to ∞we have a variant of the Riccati integral equation

9.6. Half-linear Willet’s criteria
Results of this subsection extend the linear oscillation and nonoscillation criteria of Willet
[217] and are presented in [153].
LEMMA 9.1. Suppose that B(s) and Q(t,s) are nonnegative continuous functions on
[T,∞) and [T,∞) × [T,∞), respectively.

Half-linear differential equations
267
(i) If
 ∞
t

(9.34)
has a solution on [T,∞).
(ii) If there exists ε > 0 such that
 ∞
t
Q(s,t)Bq(s)ds ⩾p−q(1 + ε)B(t) ̸≡0,
t ⩾T,
(9.35)
then the inequality
v(t) ⩾B(t) + (p −1)
 ∞
t
Q(t,s)


v(s)


q ds,
(9.36)
possesses no solution on [T,∞).
PROOF. (i) Let v1(t) = B(t) and deﬁne
vk+1(t) = B(t) + (p −1)
 ∞
t
Q(t,s)

k ∈N.
Then by (9.33)
v2(t) = B(t) + (p −1)
 ∞
t
Q(t,s)Bq(s)ds
⩽B(t) + (p −1)p−qB(t) ⩽pB(t),
and v1(t) ⩽v2(t). Suppose, by induction, that v1(t) ⩽v2(t) ⩽··· ⩽vn(t) ⩽pB(t). Then
vn+1(t) ⩽B(t) + (p −1)

 ∞
t

Thus, the sequence {vn} is nondecreasing and bounded above. Hence, it converges uni-
formly to a continuous function v which is a solution of (9.34).

268
Half-linear differential equations
(ii) Suppose, to the contrary, that v is a continuous function satisfying (9.36). Then
v(t) ⩾B(t) ⩾0 which implies vq(t) ⩾Bq(t) ⩾0. Thus
v(t) ⩾B(t) + (p −1)
 ∞
t
Q(t,s)Bq(s)ds ⩾1 + (p −1)(1 + ε)p−qB(t).
Continuing in this way, we obtain v(t) ⩾anB(t), where a1 = 1, an < an+1 and
an+1 = 1 + (p −1)aq
np−q(1 + ε).
(9.37)
We claim that limn→∞an = ∞. Assume, to the contrary, that limn→∞an = a < ∞. Then
a ⩾1 and from (9.37)
a = 1 + (p −1)(1 + ε)aqp−q,
but this is the contradiction since the equation λ = 1+(p−1)(1+ε)λqp−q has no solution
for which λ ⩾0. This contradiction proves that limn→∞an = ∞and hence B(t) ≡0. This
contradiction with (9.35) proves the lemma.
□
As a direct consequence of the previous lemma we have the following oscillation and
nonoscillation criteria.
THEOREM 9.7. Suppose that
 ∞c(t)dt is convergent and C(t) :=
 ∞
t
c(s)ds ⩾0 for
large t.
(i) If
 ∞
t
Cq(s)ds ⩽p−qC(t) for large t, then (9.1) is nonoscillatory.
(ii) If C(t) ̸≡0 for large t and there exists ε > 0 such that
 ∞
t
Cq(s)ds ⩾p−q(1 + ε)C(t)
for large t, then (9.1) is oscillatory.
PROOF. (i) By the part (i) of the previous lemma there exists a solution of the integral
equation (5.21), hence (9.1) is nonoscillatory by Theorem 5.8.
(ii) By contradiction, suppose that (9.1) is nonoscillatory. Then (5.21) has a solution for
large t, but it contradicts the part (ii) of the previous lemma.
□
REMARK 9.3. The constant p−q in the previous statement is the best possible as shows
the Euler equation (4.20) with the critical constant γ = ˜γ = ( p−1
p )p.
9.7. Equations with periodic coefﬁcient
The oscillation criterion presented in this subsection can be found in the paper [65].

Half-linear differential equations
269
THEOREM 9.8. Suppose that the function c(t) in (9.1) is a periodic function with the
period ω, c(t) ̸≡0, and
 ω
0
c(t)dt ⩾0,
then (9.1) is oscillatory both at t = ∞and at t = −∞.
PROOF. To prove oscillation of (9.1), it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd a solution of this equation with
at least two zeros. Indeed, the periodicity of the function c implies that if x is a solution of
(9.1) then x(t ± ω) is a solution as well and hence any solution with two zeros has actually
inﬁnitely many of them, tending both to ∞and −∞.
The statement of theorem is clearly true if c is a positive constant function (since then
x(t) = sinp μt is a solution of this equation, where μ is a constant depending on c and p. So
we need to consider the cases when c(t) is not a constant only. Also, it is sufﬁcient to deal
with the case when
 ω
0 c(t)dt = 0 because otherwise we can deﬁne c0 = 1
ω
 ω
0 c(t)dt > 0
and ˜c(t) = c(t) −c0. Clearly, we have c(t) > ˜c(t). If we prove (9.1) with ˜c instead of c to
be oscillatory then by the Sturmian comparison theorem equation (9.1) is also oscillatory.
Now let
C(t) =
 t
0
c(s)ds.
This is a continuous periodic function with the period ω. Let γ and δ be deﬁned by
C(δ) = max
0⩽t⩽ωC(t),
C(γ ) =
min
δ⩽t⩽δ+ωC(t).
Then 0 ⩽δ < γ < δ + ω and
 t
γ
c(s)ds ⩾0,
 δ
t
c(s)ds ⩾0
for t ∈R.
Now, by Theorem 8.5 and the remark given below this theorem, the solution of (9.1) given
by the initial condition x(δ) = 1, x′(δ) = 0 has a zero in (−∞,δ). Indeed, C(t) ̸≡0 and
 δ

|s −δ|α

ds ⩾0
for t ⩾δ,
with any α ∈(−1
p,p −2]. Now we need to show that this solution has a zero on (δ,∞) as
well. We proceed by contradiction, suppose that x(t) > 0 for t ⩾δ. Consider the function
w = −Φ(x′)
Φ(x) on [δ,∞). This function satisﬁes the Riccati differential equation
w′ = c(t) + (p −1)|w|q
(9.38)

and by integration we have
w(t + ω) −w(t) = (p −1)

(9.39)
hence w(t + ω) > w(t). Consider now the sequence w(γ ), w(γ + ω), w(γ + 2ω),.... By
Theorem 8.5 and by our indirect assumption on the solution x(t), this sequence consists of
negative terms:
w(γ ) < w(γ + ω) < w(γ + 2ω) < ··· < 0.
Indeed, if w(γ + kω) ⩾0 for some k ∈N, then by Theorem 8.5 the solution x(t) would
have a zero in (γ + kω,∞). Hence limk→∞w(γ + kω) ⩽0, consequently by (9.39)
w(γ ) + (p −1)
 ∞
γ


w(s)


q ds ⩽0,
i.e., the integral  ∞

and the function w(t) is bounded. Again by (9.38) we ﬁnd that w′ is also bounded, say,
|w′(t)| < L. Then

On the other hand, w(δ) = 0, and by (9.39) we have limk→∞w(δ + kω) > 0 and this
contradicts the fact that limt→∞w(t) = 0.

proof of Theorem 5.6. For details we refer to [151].

tion was introduced by Philos [189].
THEOREM 9.10. Let D0 = {(t,s): t > s ⩾t0} and D = {(t,s): t ⩾s ⩾t0}. Assume that
the function H ∈C(D;R) satisﬁes the following conditions:

(ii) H has a continuous nonpositive partial derivative on D0 with respect to the second
variable.

The next statement is also taken from [152]. We present it without proof. This proof,
similar to the proof of the previous theorem, follows more or less the original idea of
Philos [189]. For comparison with the linear case we also refer to the papers of Yan [220,
221]. Taking H(t,s) = (t −s)λ, λ > 0, the previous statement reduces to the half-linear
version of Kamenev’s oscillation criterion presented in Section 9.4.

10. Various oscillation problems
In this section we collect various problems of half-linear oscillation theory. We start with
an asymptotic formula for the distance between consecutive zeros of oscillatory solutions
of half-linear equations. Then we turn our attention to various problems like oscillation of
forced and retarded equations and to similar problems.
10.1. Asymptotic formula for distance of zeros of oscillatory solutions
The results of this subsection are taken from [93] and present the asymptotic formula for
the distance of consecutive zeros of oscillatory solutions of the equation

Φ(x′)
′ + (p −1)c(t)Φ(x) = 0.
(10.1)
It is supposed that c(t) > 0 for large t and the results are based on the generalized Prüfer
transformation from Section 2. In this transformation, a nontrivial solution and its deriva-
tive are expressed via the generalized half-linear sine and cosine functions. Recall that the
half-linear sine function, denoted by S = S(t) or sinp t, is the solution of the equation
Φ(x′)′ + (p −1)Φ(x) = 0
satisfying the initial condition x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 1 and the half-linear cosine function is
deﬁned by cosp t = S′(t).

276
Half-linear differential equations
THEOREM 10.1. Suppose that c is a differentiable function such that c(t) > 0 on an in-
terval [T,∞), and
lim
t→∞c′(t)

c(t)
−p+1
p = 0
(10.2)
holds. Then (10.1) is oscillatory. Moreover, if N[x;T ] denotes the number of zeros of a
solution x of (10.1) in the interval [a,T ], then
N[x;T ] = P[x;T ] + R[x;T ],
(10.3)
where P[x;T ] is the principal term given by
P[x;T ] = 1

It follows that limt→∞t−1[c(t)]−1
p = 0, or equivalently, limt→∞tpc(t) = ∞. This im-
plies, by Theorem 4.5, that (10.1) is oscillatory.
Now we turn our attention to the proof of the asymptotic formulas for numbers of zeros.
By the Sturmian comparison theorem (Theorem 2.4) we have that N[x1;T ] and N[x2;T ]
differ at most by one for any solutions x1 and x2 of (10.1), so we may restrict our attention
to the solution x0 of (10.1) determined by the initial conditions x0(a) = 0, x′
0(a) = 1. This
solution is oscillatory by the ﬁrst part of the our theorem.

(10.7)
From the ﬁrst equation in (10.5) we see that x0(t) = 0 if and only if ϕ(t) = jπp, j ∈Z.
We may suppose that ϕ(a) = 0. In view of (10.2) there is no loss of generality in assuming
that
C∗(t) < p
for t ⩾a,
where C∗(t) is deﬁned by (10.4). Since

Φ(x′)

REMARK 10.1. (i) The results of this subsection cannot be applied to the generalized
Euler equation (4.20), since the function c(t) = λ(p −1)t−p does not satisfy (10.2). A cal-
culation of P[x;T ] and R[x;T ] for the generalized Euler equation

Φ(x′)
′ + λ(p −1)t−pΦ(x) = 0
shows that both of them are of the same logarithmic order as T →∞.
(ii) In [191], Piros has investigated a similar problem under a more stringent restriction
on c(t), namely he supposed that cν(t) is a concave function of t for some ν > 0. Then
he proved that the error term R[x;T ] in (10.3) is O(1). Exactly, the differential equation
(10.11) with β = 1
ν plays the exceptional role in determining the precise value of R[x;T ].
10.2. Half-linear Milloux and Armellini–Tonelli–Sansone theorems
Results of this subsection are taken from [15] and [23]. Recall that the classical Armellini–
Tonelli–Sansone theorem concerns the convergence to zero of all solutions of the second
order linear differential equation
x′′ + c(t)x = 0.
(10.12)
In particular, by the theorem of Milloux [175], if the function c is continuously differen-
tiable, nondecreasing, and
lim
t→∞c(t) = ∞
(10.13)
then (10.12) has at least one solution satisfying
lim
t→∞x(t) = 0.
(10.14)
The theorem of Armellini–Tonelli–Sansone deals with the situation when all solutions
of (10.12) satisfy (10.14). This happens when c goes to inﬁnity “regularly” (the exact
deﬁnition is given below). Regular growth means, roughly speaking, that a function does
not increase fast on intervals of short length.
Here we show that both theorems extend verbatim to (9.1). First we present some deﬁn-
itions. Let S := {(αk,βk)} be a sequence of intervals such that
0 ⩽α1 < β1 < α2 < β2 < ··· < βk →∞
as k →∞.
(10.15)
Then
limsup
k→∞
k
i=1(βi −αi)
βk
=: δ(S) = δ
(10.16)
is called the density of the sequence of intervals S. A nondecreasing positive function f
tends to inﬁnity intermittently (an alternative terminology is quasi-jumping) as t →∞,

280
Half-linear differential equations
provided to every ε > 0 there exists a sequence of intervals S satisfying (10.15) such that
δ(S) ⩽ε and the increase of f on R+ \ S is ﬁnite, i.e.,
S(f ;S) :=
∞

k=1

f (αk) −f (βk−1)

< ∞.
(10.17)
In the opposite case we say that f (t) →∞regularly as t →∞.
THEOREM 10.2. Suppose that c is a nondecreasing continuously differentiable function
satisfying (10.13). Then (10.1) possesses at least one nontrivial solution satisfying (10.14).
PROOF. From the variety of proofs we present that one based on the modiﬁed Prüfer trans-
formation (compare Section 1.3). An alternative approach to the problem is presented in
[107,108,123].
For any nontrivial solution x of (10.1) there exist a positive function ϱ given by the
formula
ϱ =

|x|p + 1
c |x′|p
 1
p
and a continuous function ϑ such that x can be expressed in the form
x(t) = ϱ(t)S

ϑ(t)

,
x′(t) = c
1
p (t)ϱ(t)S′
ϑ(t)

,
where the generalized sine function S is the same as in Section 1.3. The functions ϑ and ϱ
satisfy the differential system

The right-hand side of (10.18) is Lipschitzian in ϑ hence the solution of (10.18) is uniquely
determined by the initial condition. We denote by ϑ(t,ϕ), ϱ(t,ϕ) the solution given by the
initial condition ϑ(0) = ϕ, ϱ(0) = 1. Then
ϱ(t,ϕ) = exp

−
 t


,
and since g(ϑ) ⩾0, the function ϱ(t,ϑ) is nonincreasing and tends to a nonnegative limit
ϱ(∞,ϕ) as t →∞. Obviously, ϱ(∞,ϕ) = 0 implies that x(t) →0 as t →∞. The con-
verse is also true because x is oscillatory.
We have the following two possibilities.

(i) We have ϱ(∞,ϕ) = 0, the corresponding solution x satisﬁes x(t) →0 as t →∞,

(10.19)
Now, the proof is based on the behavior as t →∞of the function ψ(t,ϕ1,ϕ2) = ϑ(t,ϕ2)−
ϑ(t,ϕ1) which is described in the next two auxiliary statements. Here X denotes the set
of ϕ’s such that (10.19) holds, this means that the corresponding solution does not tend to
zero as t →∞. The proof can be found in [15].
LEMMA 10.1. Let ϕ1,ϕ2 ∈X and ϕ1 < ϕ2 < ϕ1 + πp. Then
ψ(∞,ϕ1,ϕ2) := lim
t→∞
ϑ(t,ϕ2) −ϑ(t,ϕ1)
exists and equals 0 or πp.
LEMMA 10.2. Let ϕ0 ∈X . Then for any ε > 0 there exists η ∈(0,πp) such that if |ϕ −
ϕ0| < η, then


ϑ(t,ϕ) −ϑ(t,ϕ0)


 < ε
for t ⩾0.
(10.20)
Now, returning to the proof of our theorem, suppose that X = R. Then the function
ϕ given by ψ(∞,0,ϕ) = 0 is nondecreasing as ϕ increases in [0,πp]. It must go from
0 to πp, taking on only these two values, by Lemma 10.1. But this is impossible since
by Lemma 10.2 this function is continuous, so the assumption X = R was false and the
theorem is proved.
□
Now we turn our attention to the extension of the Armellini–Tonelli–Sansone theorem.
THEOREM 10.3. If the function lgc(t) →∞regularly, then every solution of (10.1) sat-
isﬁes (10.14).
PROOF. For the sake of simplicity we suppose that c is continuously differentiable for
large t. Consider the function
A(t) =


x(t)


p + |x′(t)|p
c(t)
,

282
Half-linear differential equations
where x is a nontrivial solution of (10.1). The function A is nondecreasing since
A′(t) = −c′(t)
c2(t)


x′(t)


p ⩽0.
(10.21)
Consequently, there exists a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) limit A = limt→∞A(t) and A ⩾0.
Suppose, by contradiction, that there exists a solution x of (10.1) which does not tend to
zero. For this solution obviously A > 0. By (10.21)
A(t) = A(0) −

In the remaining part of the proof we suppose that the following statement holds.

of all intervals where
A(t) −


x(t)


p ⩽η
(10.23)
is less than ε0.
Since the proof of this lemma is rather technical and follows essentially the original
linear idea, we skip it and return to the proof of theorem.
Denote by (αi,βi) intervals, where (10.23) holds. On intervals (βi,αi+1) we have
A(t) −

with A = limt→∞A(t) > 0.

10.3. Strongly and conditionally oscillatory equation
Differential equation (0.1) with a positive function c is said to be conditionally oscillatory
if there exists a constant λ0 > 0 such that (0.1) with λc(t) instead of c(t) is oscillatory
for λ > λ0 and nonoscillatory if λ < λ0. The value λ0 is called the oscillation constant of
(0.1). If equation is oscillatory (nonoscillatory) for every λ > 0, then equation is said to be
strongly oscillatory (strongly nonoscillatory). The results of this subsection are presented
in [133].
The examples illustrating these concepts we have already seen in the previous sections.
For example, if
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, the equation
r(t)Φ(x′)′ +
r1−q(t)
(
 t r1−q(s)ds)μ Φ(x) = 0
(10.24)
is conditionally oscillatory if μ = p, strongly oscillatory if μ < p and strongly nonoscil-
latory if μ > p. This follows from the fact that the transformation of independent variable
t 
−→
 t r1−q(s)ds transforms (10.24) into the equation
Φ(x′)′ + 1
tμ Φ(x) = 0
(10.25)
and (10.25) is compared with the Euler equation (4.20).
THEOREM 10.4. Suppose that
 ∞c(t)dt < ∞and
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞. Equation (0.1)
is strongly oscillatory if and only if
limsup

c(s)ds = 0.
(10.27)
PROOF. The proof is based on the statements which claim (upon a slight reformulation)
that under the assumptions of our theorem Equation (0.1) is oscillatory provided

for large t. These statements follow essentially from comparing (0.1) with Euler-type dif-

limsup
t→∞
 ∞

p−1  ∞

hence (0.1) is strongly oscillatory. Conversely, suppose that (0.1) is strongly oscillatory
and (10.26) fails to hold, i.e.,
limsup
t→∞
 t
r1−q(s)ds

c(s)ds = L < ∞.
Then for λ <

which means that (0.1) with λc instead of c is nonoscillatory. This contradicts strong os-
cillation of (0.1). The proof of the part concerning necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
strong nonoscillation of (0.1) is the same.
□
10.4. Oscillation of forced half-linear differential equations
The result of this subsection is presented in [158] and concerns the forced half-linear dif-
ferential equation

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ + c(t)Φ(x) = f (t),
(10.31)
where f is a continuous function. It extends the oscillation criterion of Wong [215] (see
also references given therein) which concerns the linear forced equation. Oscillation of
a more general half-linear forced equation than (10.31) is investigated in [139], but for
simplicity we here the results of [158].
THEOREM 10.5. Suppose that for any T there exist T ⩽s1 < t1 ⩽s2 < t2 such that
f (t) ⩽0 for t ∈[s1,t1] and f (t) ⩾0 t ∈[s2,t2]. Denote

for i = 1,2, then every solution of (10.31) is oscillatory.
PROOF. Suppose that x is a nonoscillatory solution which is eventually of one sign, say
x(t) > 0 for t ⩾T0 and let the function w be deﬁned by the modiﬁed Riccati substitution
w(t) = ϕ(t)r(t)Φ(x′(t))
Φ(x(t))
.
Then w solves the generalized Riccati equation

|w|q
(r(t)ϕ(t))q−1 + ϕ(t)f (t)
Φ(x(t)) .
(10.32)
By the assumptions of theorem, one can choose s1,t1 ⩾T0 so that f (t) ⩽0 on I = [s1,t1]
with s1 < t1. From (10.32) we have for t ∈I
ϕ(t)c(t) ⩽−w′(t) + ϕ′(t)
ϕ(t) w(t) −(p −1)

10.5. Oscillation of retarded half-linear equations
The results of this subsection are given [4], for related results we refer also to [2,227] and
the references given therein. We consider the equation
Φ(x′)′ + c(t)Φxτ(t) = 0.
(10.34)
We suppose that c(t) ⩾0 for large t, limt→∞τ(t) = ∞and τ(t) ⩽t. Equation (10.34) is
said to be it oscillatory if all its solutions are oscillatory, i.e., have arbitrarily large zeros.
Since the Sturmian theory generally does not extend to (10.34), oscillatory and nonoscilla-
tory solutions (i.e., solutions which are eventually positive or negative) may coexist.
In the next theorem, Equation (10.34) is considered on the interval [t0,∞) and it is
shown that if the delay τ(t) is sufﬁciently close to t, in a certain sense, then some oscillation
criteria for (9.1) can be extended to (10.34). Oscillation criteria presented here are half-
linear extensions of some results for the linear second order retarded equations (the case
p = 2 in (10.34)) given in [96,184].
First we present without proof a technical auxiliary statement, the proof can be found in
[4].
LEMMA 10.4. Suppose that the following conditions hold:
(i) x(t) ∈C2[T,∞) for some T > 0,
(ii) x(t) > 0, x′(t) > 0, and x′′(t) ⩽0 for t ⩾T .

for t ⩾Tk1,
and for every k2 ∈(0,1) there exists a constant Tk2 ⩾T such that
x(t) ⩾k2tx′(t),
for t ⩾Tk2.
THEOREM 10.6. Denote for t ⩾t0
γ (t) := sup

s ⩾t0: τ(s) ⩽t

.
Equation (10.34) is oscillatory if either of the following holds:

ds > 1,
(10.35)
or

γ (t)
c(s)ds = ∞.
(10.36)
PROOF. Suppose to the contrary that (10.34) has a nonoscillatory solution x(t). Without
loss of generality we may suppose that x(t) > 0 for large t, say t ⩾t1. Then also x(τ(t)) >
0 on [t1,∞) for t1 large enough. Since c(t) ⩾0 on [t1,∞),

Φ(x′)
′ = −c(t)

Φ

x

τ(t)

⩽0.
(10.37)
Hence, the function Φ(x′) is decreasing. Since sup{c(t): t ⩾T } > 0 for any T ⩾0, we see
that either
(a) x′(t) > 0 for all t ⩾t1, or
(b) there exists t2 ⩾t1 such that x′(t) < 0 on [t2,∞).
If (b) holds, then it follows from (10.37) that
0 ⩾


x′(t)


p−2x′(t)
′ = (p −1)


x′(t)


p−2x′′(t),
for t ⩾t2.
Thus, x′′(t) ⩽0 for t ∈[t2,∞). This and x′(t) < 0 on [t2,∞) imply that there exists t3 > t2
such that x(t) ⩽0 for t ⩾t3. This contradicts x(t) > 0. Thus, (a) holds.
Integrating (10.37) from t ⩾t1 to ∞, we obtain

11. Half-linear Sturm–Liouville problem
In this section we show that the solutions of the Sturm–Liouville problem for half-linear
equation (0.1) have similar properties as in the linear case. Of course, we cannot consider
the problem of orthogonality of eigenfunctions since this concept has no meaning in Lp,
p ̸= 2. As far as we know, an open problem is whether the system of eigenfunctions is
complete in Lp.
11.1. Basic Sturm–Liouville problem
We start with the problem

Φ(x′)
′ + λc(t)Φ(x) = 0,
x(a) = 0 = x(b),
(11.1)
under the assumption that c(t) ⩾0 and c(t) ̸≡0. The value λ is called the eigenvalue if
there exists a nontrivial solution x of (11.1). The solution x is said to the eigenfunction
corresponding to the eigenvalue λ. Clearly, according to the assumption c(t) ⩾0 and the
Sturm comparison theorem, only values λ > 0 can be eigenvalues. The main statement of
this subsection is taken from the classical paper of Elbert [85].
THEOREM 11.1. The eigenvalue problem (11.1) has inﬁnitely many eigenvalues 0 < λ1 <
λ2 < ··· < λn < ···, λn →∞as n →∞. The nth eigenfunction has exactly n −1 zeros
in (a,b). Moreover, if the function c is supposed to be positive in the whole interval (a,b),
the eigenvalues satisfy the asymptotic relation
lim
n→∞
p√λn

πp
 b
a
p√c(t)dt
.
(11.2)
PROOF. The proof of the ﬁrst part of the theorem is a special case of the problem treated
in the next subsection, so we present only its main idea. Let x(t;λ) be a solution of (11.1)

294
Half-linear differential equations
given by the initial condition x(a;λ) = 0, x′(a;λ) = 1 and let ϕ(t;λ) be the continuous
function given in all points where x′(t;λ) ̸= 0 by the formula
ϕ(t;λ) = arctanp
x(t;λ)
x′(t;λ),
i.e., ϕ(t;λ) is the angular variable in the half-linear Prüfer transformation for x(t;λ). This
means that ϕ(t;λ) satisfy the differential equation
ϕ′ =


S′(ϕ)


p + λc(t)
p −1


S(ϕ)


p,
ϕ(a;λ) = 0,
(11.3)
where S is the half-linear sine function. The proof is based on the fact that ϕ(b;λ) is a
continuous function of λ and ϕ(b;λ) →∞as λ →∞. The continuity property follows
from the general theory of continuous dependence of solutions of ﬁrst order differential
equations on the right-hand side. The limit property of ϕ(b;λ) is proved via the comparison
of (11.1) with the “minorant” problem with a constant coefﬁcient

Φ(y′)
′ + λ¯cΦ(y) = 0,
y(a′) = 0 = y(b′),
(11.4)
where [a′,b′] ⊂[a,b] is such that c(t) > 0 on [a′,b′] and ¯c = mint∈[a′,b′] c(t) > 0. The
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of (11.4) can be computed explicitly and if θ(t;λ) is de-
ﬁned for this problem in the same way as ϕ(t;λ) for (11.1), we have
ϕ(b;λ) ⩾θ(b;λ) →∞,
as λ →∞.
Now, the eigenvalues are those λ = λn for which ϕ(b;λn) = nπp and taking into account
that ϕ(t;λ) is increasing in t (this follows from (11.3)), zero points of the associated
eigenfunction xn(t) = x(t;λn) are those tk, k = 1,...,n −1, for which ϕ(tk,λn) = kπp,
k = 1,...,n −1.
Concerning the proof of the asymptotic formula (11.2), ﬁrst suppose that the function
c(t) ≡c1 > 0 is a constant function and consider the problem

Φ(z′)
′ + λc1Φ(z) = 0,
z(a) = 0 = z(b).
(11.5)
A nontrivial solution of the half-linear equation in this problem satisfying z(a) = 0 is
z = S( p√λc1(t −a)) and hence the k-th eigenvalue is given by
p√λkc1(b −a) = kπp, thus
p√λk
k
=
πp
 b
a
p√c1 dt
,
i.e., the asymptotic formula (11.2) is automatically satisﬁed in this case.
Now let us consider the original Sturm–Liouville problem (11.1) and its k-th eigenfunc-
tion x(t;λk). This function has zeros at t0 = a < t1 < t2 < ··· < tk−1 < tk = b. Put λ = λk
in (11.1) and in (11.5) and deﬁne
c1,i :=
min
ti−1⩽t⩽ti
c(t),
c2,i :=
max
ti−1⩽t⩽ti
c(t),
i = 1,...,k.

Half-linear differential equations
295
Then the differential equation in (11.1) is a Sturmian majorant of the differential equation
in (11.5) wit c1 = c1,i on the interval [ti−1,ti]. Hence the solution S( p
λkc1,i(t −ti−1) of
(11.5) has no zero on (ti−1,ti) so that
p
λkc1,i(ti −ti−1) ⩽πp.
(11.6)
By a similar argument we have πp ⩽
p
λkc2,i(ti −ti−1). On the other hand,

ω(f,δ) = max


Making use of this deﬁnition we deduce from (11.7) that

By the ﬁrst part of the proof λk →∞as k →∞. Therefore the continuity of the function

11.2. Regular problem with indeﬁnite weight
The results presented in this subsection can be found in [133]. We consider the Sturm-
Liouville problem

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ + λc(t)Φ(x) = 0,
Ax(a) −A′x′(a) = 0,
Bx(b) + B′x′(b) = 0.
(11.8)
It is supposed that r,c are continuous in [a,b] and r(t) > 0 in this interval. No sign restric-
tion on the function c is supposed. A,A′,B,B′ are real numbers such that A2 + A′2 > 0,
B2 + B′2 > 0, λ is a real-valued eigenvalue parameter.

296
Half-linear differential equations
THEOREM 11.2. Suppose that AA′ ⩾0, BB′ ⩾0 and A2 + B2 > 0. Further suppose
that the function c takes both positive and negative values in [a,b]. Then the totality of
eigenvalues of (11.8) consists of two sequences {λ+
n }∞
n=0 and {λ−
n }∞
n=0 such that
··· < λ−
n < ··· < λ−
1 < λ−
0 < 0 < λ+
0 < λ+
1 < ··· < λ+
n < ···
and
lim
n→∞λ+
n = ∞,
lim
n→∞λ−
n = −∞.
The eigenfunctions x = x(t;λ+
n ) and x = x(t;λ−
n ) associated with λ = λ+
n and λ−
n have
exactly n zeros in (a,b).
PROOF. The proof is again based on the half-linear Prüfer transformation. Let λ ∈R and
let x(t;λ) be the solution of

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ + λc(t)Φ(x) = 0
(11.9)
satisfying the initial conditions x(a) = A′,x′(a) = A. Note that this solution satisﬁes the
boundary condition Ax(a) −A′x′(a) = 0. According to the continuous dependence of
solutions on a perturbation of the functions r,c, in (0.1), the function x(t;λ) depends
continuously on λ. In particular, if λi →λ as i →∞, then x(t;λi) →x(t;λ) uniformly
on [a,b] as i →∞. If x(t;λ) satisﬁes the second part of the boundary conditions Bx(b)+
B′x′(b) = 0 for some λ ∈R, then λ is an eigenvalue and x(t;λ) is the corresponding
eigenfunction.
For λ = 0 we can compute x(t;λ) explicitly,
x(t;0) = A′ + rq−1(a)A
 t
a
r1−q(s)ds
and it is easy to see that this solution does not satisfy the condition at t = b, so λ = 0 is not
an eigenvalue.
In what follows we suppose that λ > 0. For the solution x(t;λ) we perform slightly
modiﬁed Prüfer transformation, we express x(t;λ) and its quasiderivative in the form
x(t;λ) = ρ(t;λ)S

Thus, it is important to discuss the initial value problem (11.11), (11.12). We denote by
f (t,ϕ,λ) the right-hand side of (11.11). It is clear that, for each λ > 0, the function
f (t,ϕ,λ) is bounded for t ∈[a,b] and ϕ ∈R. In view of the Pythagorean identity (1.5)
the function f (t,ϕ,λ) can be written in the form

Similarly as in the standard half-linear Prüfer transformation, the function f (t,ϕ,λ) is Lip-
schitzian in ϕ, hence unique solvability is guaranteed and the solution ϕ = ϕ(t;λ) depends
continuously on (t,λ) ∈[a,b] × (0,∞).
It is easy to see that λ > 0 is an eigenvalue of (11.8) if and only if λ satisﬁes

Half-linear differential equations
for some n ∈Z. Here, by virtue of BB′ ⩾0, we assume without loss of generality that the
value of the function arctanp in (11.15) is in (−(πp/2),0] if B ̸= 0 and equals −(πp/2) if
B = 0.
Observe that the function ϕ(b;λ) is strictly increasing for λ ∈(0,∞). Indeed, denote
as before f (t,ϕ,λ) the right-hand side of (11.11). Clearly, f (t,ϕ,λ) is nondecreasing
function of λ ∈(0,∞), and, since AA′ ⩾0, the initial value ϕ(a;λ) given by (11.12) is
also nondecreasing for λ ∈(0,∞). Then a standard comparison theorem for the ﬁrst order
scalar differential equations implies that ϕ(t;λ) is a nondecreasing function of λ ∈(0,∞)
for each ﬁxed t ∈[a,b]. Now, let 0 < λ < μ be ﬁxed. Since the function ϕ(t;λ) is nonde-
creasing with respect to λ, we have ϕ(t;λ) ⩽ϕ(t;μ). Assume that ϕ(t;λ) ≡ϕ(t;μ) for
all t ∈(a,b). Then ϕ′(t;λ) ≡ϕ′(t;μ), and so we have f (t,ϕ(t;λ),λ) ≡f (t,ϕ(t;μ),μ)
from which follows C(ϕ(t;λ)) ≡C(ϕ(t;μ)) ≡0. This implies that ϕ(t;λ) ≡(m + 1
2)πp
for some integer m ∈Z, and hence, by Equation (11.11), c(t) ≡0 for t ∈(a,b). This is
a contradiction to the assumption that c(t) > 0 for some t ∈[a,b]. Therefore we have
ϕ(t0;λ) < ϕ(t0;μ) for some t0 ∈(a,b). Then applying a standard comparison theorem
again, we conclude that ϕ(b;λ) < ϕ(b;μ).
Now we claim that x(t;λ) has no zeros in the interval (a,b] for all sufﬁciently small
λ > 0. As stated before, x(t;λ) →x(t;0) as λ →0+ uniformly on [a,b]. We note that
x(t;λ) satisﬁes

Then it is easy to ﬁnd that if A = 0 or AA′ > 0, then x(t;λ) has no zero in the closed
interval [a,b] for all sufﬁciently small λ > 0, and that if A ̸= 0 and A′ = 0, then x(t;λ)
has no zero in the interval (a,b] for all sufﬁciently small λ > 0. Further, since

for a ⩽t ⩽b, we see that if A ̸= 0, then x′(t;λ) has no zeros in [a,b] for all sufﬁciently
small λ > 0.
Next we claim that the number of zeros of x(t;λ) in [a,b] can be made as large as
possible if λ > 0 is chosen sufﬁciently large. To this end, we consider the equation

Φ(x′)
′ + (p −1)μpΦ(x) = 0,
where μ > 0 is a constant. Clearly, S(μt) is a solution of this equation, and has zeros
t = jπp/μ, j ∈Z, S(·) is the generalized sine function. Since c is supposed to be positive

Half-linear differential equations
299
at some t ∈[a,b], there exists [a′,b′] ⊂[a,b] such that c(t) > 0 on [a′,b′]. Let k ∈N be
any given positive integer and take μ > 0 so that S(μt) has at least k + 1 zeros in [a′,b′].
Let r∗> 0 and λ∗> 0 be numbers such that
r∗= max
t∈[a′,b′]r(t),
λ∗min
t∈[a′,b′]c(t) = (p −1)r∗μp.
Then, comparing the half-linear equation in (11.8) with λ > λ∗and the equation

r∗Φ(x′)
′ + (p −1)r∗μpΦ(x) = 0,
a′ ⩽t ⩽b′,
we conclude by the Sturm comparison theorem that all solution of the equation in (11.8)
with λ > λ∗have at least k zeros in [a,b]. Since k was arbitrary, this shows that the number
of zeros of x(t;λ) in [a,b] can be made as large as possible if λ > 0 is chosen sufﬁciently
large.
Since the radial variable ρ(t;λ) > 0, it follows from (11.10) that x(t;λ) has a zero at
t = c if and only if there exists j ∈Z such that ϕ(c;λ) = jπp. Moreover, if ϕ(c;λ) =
jπp, then by (11.11) we have ϕ′(c;λ) = (λ/r(c))q−1 > 0. Therefore we easily see that if
ϕ(c;λ) = jπp, then ϕ(t;λ) > jπp for c < t ⩽b. Consequently, we have
(i) For all λ > 0 sufﬁciently small
0 < ϕ(b;λ) < πp
2 ,
if A ̸= 0,
0 < ϕ(b;λ) < πp,
if A = 0.
(ii) limλ→∞ϕ(b;λ) = ∞.
Now we seek λ > 0 satisfying (11.15) for some n ∈Z. The left-hand side ϕ(b;λ) of
(11.15) is a continuous function of λ ∈(0,∞), and it is strictly increasing for λ ∈(0,∞),
moreover, it has the following properties
0 ⩽lim
λ→0+ϕ(b;λ) < πp
2 ,
if A ̸= 0,
0 ⩽lim
λ→0+ϕ(b;λ) < πp,
if A = 0,
and
lim
λ→∞ϕ(b;λ) = ∞.
On the other hand, by virtue of BB′ ⩾0, the right-hand side of (11.15) is a nonincreas-
ing function of λ ∈(0,∞) for each n ∈Z. More precisely, in case BB′ > 0, it is strictly
decreasing and varies from (n + 1)πp to (n + 1
2)πp as λ varies from 0 to ∞. In the case
B′ = 0, it is the constant function (n + 1
2)πp.

The proof concerning the sequence of negative eigenvalues λ−

11.3. Singular Sturm–Liouville problem
The results of this subsection are taken from the paper [91], for related results we refer to
[133,134]. We consider the equation

Φ(x′)
′ + λc(t)Φ(x) = 0,
t ∈[a,∞),
(11.16)
where λ > 0 is a real-valued parameter and c is a nonnegative piecewise continuous even-
tually nonvanishing function. A solution x0 = x0(t;λ) of (11.16) is said to be subdominant
if
lim
t→∞x0(t;λ) = k0,
(11.17)
for some constant k0 ̸= 0, and a solution x1 = x1(t;λ) is said to be dominant if
lim
t→∞

x1(t;λ) −k1(t −a)

= 0
(11.18)
for some constant k1 ̸= 0. We will show that the subdominant and dominant solutions are
essentially unique in the sense that if ˜x0(t;λ) and ˜x1(t;λ) denote the solutions of (11.16)
satisfying
lim
t→∞˜x0(t;λ) = 1
(11.19)
and
lim
t→∞

˜x1(t;λ) −(t −a)

= 0
(11.20)
then x0(t;λ) = k0 ˜x0(t;λ) and x1(t;λ) = k1 ˜x1(t;λ). According to the results presented in
Section 6, any eventually positive solution (11.16) has one of the following asymptotic
behavior:

Half-linear differential equations
301
(i) limt→∞Φ(x′(t;λ)) = const > 0;
(ii) limt→∞Φ(x′(t;λ)) = 0, limt→∞x(t;λ) = 0;
(iii) limt→∞Φ(x′(t;λ)) = 0, limt→∞x(t;λ) = const > 0.
In view of this result, the dominant and subdominant solutions investigated in this subsec-
tion correspond to cases (i) and (iii), respectively.
The proofs of three statements presented in this subsection are rather complex, so we
skip them and we refer to the above mentioned paper [91]. We note only that these proofs
are again based on the half-linear Prüfer transformation, this time combined with a detailed
asymptotic analysis of solutions of (11.16).

Half-linear differential equations
12. Perturbation principle
12.1. General idea
In the previous sections devoted to oscillation and nonoscillation criteria for (0.1), this
equation was essentially viewed as a perturbation of the one-term equation

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ = 0.
(12.1)
As we have already mentioned, for oscillation (nonoscillation) of (0.1), the function c must
be “sufﬁciently positive” (“not too positive”) comparing with the function r. In this section
we use a more general approach, Equation (0.1) is investigated as a perturbation of another
(nonoscillatory) two-term half-linear equation

r(t)Φ(x′)
′ + ˜c(t)Φ(x) = 0
(12.2)
with a continuous function ˜c, i.e., (0.1) is written in the form
r(t)Φ(x′)′ + ˜c(t)Φ(x) + c(t) −˜c(t)Φ(x) = 0.
(12.3)
The main idea is essentially the same as before. If the difference (c −˜c) is sufﬁciently
positive (not too positive), then (12.3) becomes oscillatory (remains nonoscillatory).
Note that in the linear case p = 2, the idea to investigate the linear Sturm–Liouville
equation (1.1) as a perturbation of the nonoscillatory two-term equation
r(t)x′′ + ˜c(t)x = 0
(12.4)
(and not only as a perturbation of the one-term equation (r(t)x′)′ = 0) brings essentially
no new idea. Indeed, let us write (1.1) in the “perturbed” form

r(t)x′′ + ˜c(t)x +

c(t) −˜c(t)

x = 0.
(12.5)
Further, let h be a solution of (12.4) and consider the transformation x = h(t)u. This trans-
formation transforms (12.5) into the equation

r(t)h2(t)u′′ +

c(t) −˜c(t)

h2(t)u = 0
(12.6)
(compare (3.2)) and this equation, whose oscillatory properties are the same as those of
(1.1), can be again investigated as a perturbation of the one-term equation (r(t)h2(t)u′)′ =
0. In the half-linear case we have in disposal no transformation which reduces nonoscilla-
tory two-terms equation into a one-term equation, so we have to use different methods and
this “perturbation principle” brings new phenomena. Note also that some ideas used in this
section have already been applied in Section 8.

12.2. Leighton–Wintner type oscillation criterion
Recall that if
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞and
 ∞c(t)dt = ∞, then (0.1) is oscillatory. This direct
extension of the classical linear Leighton–Wintner criterion has been proved in Section 2.
This criterion characterizes exactly what means that for oscillation of (0.1) the function c
must be sufﬁciently positive comparing with the function r in one-term equation (12.1).
Here we extend this result to the situation when (0.1) is investigated as a perturbation of
(12.2). The results of this subsection are presented in [69].
THEOREM 12.1. Suppose that h is the principal solution of (nonoscillatory) equation
(12.2) and
 ∞
c(t) −˜c(t)

hp(t)dt := lim
b→∞
 b 
c(t) −˜c(t)

hp(t)dt = ∞.
(12.7)
Then Equation (0.1) is oscillatory.
PROOF. According to the relationship between disconjugacy of (0.1) and positivity of the
functional F mentioned in Section 2, to prove that (0.1) is oscillatory, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd
(for any T ∈R) a function y ∈W 1,p(T,∞), with a compact support in (T,∞), such that
F(y;T,∞) < 0. Hence, let T ∈R be arbitrary and T < t0 < t1 < t2 < t3 (these points will
be speciﬁed later). Deﬁne the test function y as follows.
y(t) =

T ⩽t ⩽t0,
f (t),
t0 ⩽t ⩽t1,
h(t),
t1 ⩽t ⩽t2,
g(t),
t2 ⩽t ⩽t3,
0,
t3 ⩽t < ∞,
where f,g are solutions of (12.2) given by the boundary conditions f (t0) = 0, f (t1) =
h(t1), g(t2) = h(t2), g(t3) = 0. Denote
wf := rΦp(f ′)
Φp(f ) ,
wh := rΦp(h′)
Φp(h) ,
wf := rΦp(g′)
Φp(g) ,
i.e., wf ,wg,wh are solutions of the Riccati equation associated with (12.2) generated by
f,g,h respectively. Using exactly the same computations as in the proof of Theorem 1
from [58], one can show that
F(y;T,∞) = K −

Half-linear differential equations
where
K := F(f ;t0,t1) + hp(t1)wf (t1) −wh(t1)
and ξ ∈(t2,t3). Now, if ε > 0 is arbitrary and T < t0 < t1 are ﬁxed, then, according to
(12.7), t2 can be chosen in such a way that  t
t1(c(s) −˜c(s))hp(s)ds > K + ε whenever
t > t2. Finally, again using the same argument as in [58] we have (observe that wg actually
depends also on t3)
lim
t3→∞hp(t2)

wh(t2) −wg(t2)

= 0,
hence the last summand in (12.8) is less than ε if t3 is sufﬁciently large. Consequently,
F(y;t0,t3) < 0 if t0,t1,t2,t3 are chosen in the above speciﬁed way.
□
If r(t) ≡1 in (0.1) and ˜c(t) = ˜γ
tp , ˜γ = ( p−1
p )p, i.e., (12.2) is the generalized Euler equa-
tion with the critical coefﬁcient (4.20), then the previous theorem reduces to the oscillation
criterion given by Elbert [87].
12.3. Hille–Nehari-type oscillation criterion
The results of this subsection can be viewed as an extension of Theorems 5.4 and 5.9 to
the situation when (0.1) (or (6.16)) is viewed as a perturbation of a one-term equation.
THEOREM 12.2. Let
 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞and c(t) ⩾0 for large t. Further suppose that
equation (12.2) is nonoscillatory and possesses a positive solution h satisfying
(i) h′(t) > 0 for large t;

tually positive principal solution x of this equation. Denote by ρ := r(t) Φ(x′)
Φ(x) . Then ρ
satisﬁes the Riccati equation (2.1) and using the Picone identity for half-linear equations

 ∞r1−q(t)dt = ∞, w ≡0 is the distinguished solution of the
Riccati equation corresponding to the equation (r(t)Φ(x′))′ = 0 and since c(t) ⩾0, by
Theorem 7.2 ρ(t) ⩾0 eventually. Hence, with L given by (12.10), we have

(12.15)
Now, since (12.10), (12.12), (12.15) hold, from (12.14) it follows that there exists a ﬁnite

Finally, if

denote by m(t) = inft⩽s{G(s)f (s)}. Then m is nondecreasing and (12.22) implies that

When (12.3) reduces to the below given Euler-type equation (12.24), some technical
assumptions on the function h in the previous theorem are satisﬁed and Theorem 12.2
simpliﬁes as follows.

CHAPTER 3D
Related Equations and Problems
In this chapter we discuss various problems related to the oscillation theory of half-linear
differential equations. First we deal with boundary value problems associated with (0.1),
where a particular attention is focused to the half-linear Fredholm alternative. In Section
14 we brieﬂy mention the so-called quasilinear equations, i.e., equations, where in addition
to additivity, also homogeneity of the solution space of equations is lost. Section 15 is de-
voted to partial differential equations with p-Laplacian and the last section of this chapter
presents basic facts of the oscillation theory of half-linear difference equations.
13. Half-linear boundary value problems
There is a voluminous literature dealing with boundary value problems of the form

Φ(x′)
′ + g(t,x) = h(t),
x(0) = 0 = x(πp),
(13.1)
(or some other boundary conditions, e.g., periodic, Neuman, mixed, ...) and even a brief
survey of these results exceeds the scope of this treatment. For this reason we focus our
attention only to some particular boundary value problems. We refer to [52,53,73,76,77,
80,82,164–168]as to a sample of papers dealing with half-linear boundary value problems.
13.1. Basic boundary value problem
Under the “basic” boundary value problem we understand the problem

Φ(x′)
′ + λΦ(x) = 0,
x(0) = 0 = x(πp),
(13.2)
where λ is the eigenvalue parameter. Here πp is the same as in the Section 1 and its value
is deﬁned by the formula
πp = 2
 1
0
ds
p√
1 −sp .
(13.3)
Eigenvalue problem (13.2) is a special case of the general Sturm–Liouville problem for
half-linear equations treated in Section 11, but its simple structure enables to determine
completely the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The situation is essentially the same as
313

314
Half-linear differential equations
in the linear case where the eigenvalues are λn = n2 with the associated eigenfunctions
xn(t) = sinnt.
THEOREM 13.1. The eigenvalues of (13.2) are λn = (p −1)np, n ∈N, and the cor-
responding eigenfunctions are (up to a nonzero multiplicative factor) xn(t) = sinp(nt),
where the half-linear sine function sinp is deﬁned in Section 1.
PROOF. The proof if this statement follows immediately from the homogeneity of the
solution space of half-linear equations and from the unique solvability the initial value
problem for these equations. The function x1(t) = sinp t is a solution of (13.2) with λ =
(p −1) and satisﬁes x(0) = 0 = x(πp) (by the deﬁnition of this function in Section 1), and
xn(t) = sinp(nt) is a solution of (13.2) with λn = (p −1)np.
□
13.2. Variational characterization of eigenvalues
In the linear case, the Courant–Fischer minimax principle provides a variational charac-
terization of eigenvalues of the classical Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem. This char-
acterization is based on the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions corresponding to different
eigenvalues. In the half-linear case the meaning of orthogonality is lost, but eigenvalues
can be described using the Lusternik–Schnirelman procedure, for general facts concerning
this approach we refer to [103]. The speciﬁcation of this method to (13.2) presented here
can be found in [80].
Let us introduce the functionals over X := W 1,p
0
(0,πp), endowed with the norm ∥x∥=
(
 πp

|x′|p dt)

p ,
A(x) = 1
p
 πp
0
|x′|p dt,
B(x) = 1
p
 πp

|x|p dt.
Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of (13.2) are equivalent to critical points and critical values
of the functional
E(x) = A(x)
B(x).
We also introduce the notation
S = x ∈X: B(x) = 1,
(hence E(x) = A(x), E′(x) = A′(x) −A(x)B′(x) for x ∈S, where A′,B′,E′ are differ-
entials of the functionals A,B,E, respectively). After some computation one can verify
that E|S satisﬁes the so-called Palais–Smale condition: if {xk} ∈S is a sequence such that
E(xk) is convergent and E′(xk) →0 in X ∗(the dual space of X ), then {xk} contains a
convergent subsequence (in the norm of X ).

Let us recall also the deﬁnition of the Krasnoselskii genus of a symmetric set A ⊂X .
Let
F := {A ⊂X: A is closed and A = −A}
and let
M =

m ∈N: ∃h ∈C

A;Rm \ {0}

such that h(−x) = −h(x)

.
Then the Krasnoselskii genus of A is deﬁned by
γ (A) :=

infM,
if M ̸= ∅,
∞,
if M = ∅.
Using the above given concepts we can now present the formulas for variational charac-
terization of all eigenvalues of (13.2).
THEOREM 13.2. Let
Fk := A ∈F: 0 /∈A, γ (A) ⩾k,

Fk := {A ∈Fk: A ⊂S, A is compact}
and let
βk = min
A∈
Fk
max
x∈A E(x).
(13.4)
Then βn = λn = (p −1)np for n ∈N.
PROOF. We present only a brief outline of the proof of this statement. First it is proved
that the nth eigenvalue λn satisﬁes λn ⩽βn. Then, via the construction of a suitable set
A ∈
F, it is shown that λn ⩾βn. We refer to [80] for details.

and suppose that λ is not an eigenvalue, i.e., λ ̸= λk. For simplicity we deal with f ∈
C[0,πp] and solution of (13.5) is understood in the classical sense, i.e., it is a function
x such that Φ(x′) ∈C1[0,πp] and equation and boundary conditions in (13.5) are satis-
ﬁed. Similarly as in the previous subsection, the critical points of J λ
f are in one to one

prove that for λ ⩽0 the energy functional J λ
f has a unique minimizer in W 1,p
0
(0,πp)
for arbitrary f ∈(W 1,p
0
(0,πp))∗. In particular, it follows from here that given arbitrary
f ∈C[0,πp], the problem (13.5) has a unique solution. So, from this point of view, the
situation is the same for p = 2 (linear case) and p ̸= 2.
The case λ > 0 is different. It is well known that for p = 2 and λ ̸= λk, k = 1,2,...,
for any f ∈C[0,πp] the problem (13.5) has a unique solution, which follows e.g. from
the Fredholm alternative. Let us consider now p ̸= 2 and 0 < λ < λ1. Due to the varia-
tional characterization of λ1 given by (13.6), the energy functional is still coercive but the
monotone operators A′, B′ “compete” because of the positivity of λ. While in the linear
case p = 2 this fact does not affect the uniqueness, for p ̸= 2 the following interesting
phenomenon is observed.
THEOREM 13.3. There exists functions f ∈C[0,πp] such that J λ
f has at least two critical
points. One of them corresponds to the global minimizer of J λ
f on W 1,p
0
(0,πp) (which does
exist due to λ < λ1) and the other is a critical point of saddle type.
Examples which illustrate these facts were given in [101] for 1 < p < 2 and in [52] for
p > 2. The results were generalized for general λ > 0 in [82].

13.4. Fredholm alternative for the scalar p-Laplacian
This is perhaps the most interesting part of the qualitative theory of half-linear differential
equations, since one meets there phenomena which are completely different comparing
with the classical Fredholm alternative for the linear boundary value problem
u′′ + m2u = h(t),
u(0) = 0 = u(π),
which has a solution if and only if
 π
0
h(t)sinmt dt = 0.
(13.7)
In this subsection we discuss the extension of the Fredholm alternative to (13.5). We
suppose that λ = λk for some k ∈N, so the problem (13.2) possesses a nontrivial solution
x(t) = sinp(kt). The half-linear version of (13.7) when λ = λ1 and m = 1 is
 πp
0
f (t)sinp t dt = 0.
(13.8)
The next theorem show that (13.8) is sufﬁcient but generally not necessary for solvability
of (13.5) with λ = λ1. The statements of this section are taken from [49]. We present them
without proofs since these proofs are technically rather complicated.
THEOREM 13.4. Let us assume that f ∈C1[0,πp], f ̸≡0 and (13.8) is satisﬁed. Then
(13.5) with λ = λ1 has at least one solution. Moreover, if p ̸= 2, then the set of possible
solutions is bounded in C1[0,πp].
Observe that this result really reveals a striking difference between the cases p ̸= 2 and
p = 2, since in the latter case the solution set is an unbounded continuum. It would be
natural to expect the number of solutions under (13.8) be generically ﬁnite if p ̸= 2.
Note also that in the proof of Theorem 13.4 it appears that the degree of the ﬁxed point
of a certain associated operator in a large ball of C1[0,πp] becomes +1 if p > 2 while
equals −1 if p < 2.
The eigenvalue problem (13.5) with λ = λ1 and f ≡0 is closely related to the Lp-
Poincaré inequality

318
Half-linear differential equations
What is the sensitivity of this optimal Poincare’s inequality under a linear perturbation?
We consider then the functional

 πp

 πp

|x|p dt +

and ask whether J λ1
f
is bounded from below. It is easy to see that a necessary condition
for this is that f satisﬁes the orthogonality condition (13.8) for otherwise E1 is unbounded
below along the ray generated by the ﬁrst eigenfunction. If p = 2, an L2-orthogonal expan-
sion into the Fourier series yields that this condition is also sufﬁcient for the boundedness
from below. However, this approach seems to be of no use when p ̸= 2. Under the ad-
ditional assumption f ∈C1[0,πp], the answer answering the sufﬁciency is provided by
the following result. Note that some of its conclusions are already implied by the previous
theorem.
THEOREM 13.5. Assume that f ∈C1[0,πp] , f ̸≡0, and (13.8) holds.
(i) For 1 < p < 2 the functional J λ1
f
is bounded from below. The set of its critical
points is nonempty and bounded.
(ii) For p > 2 the functional J λ1
f
is bounded from below and has a global minimizer.
The set of its critical points is bounded, however J λ1
f
does not satisfy the Palais–
Smale condition at the level 0.
It is interesting to see that changing p from p > 2 to p < 2 shifts the structure of this
functional J λ1
f
from global minima to a saddle point geometry for its level sets. If p = 2
the functional is convex with a whole ray of minimizers. This result seems to be open
and interesting issue concerning the geometry of Lp spaces where the absence of a good
orthogonality notion makes the structure of Poincaré-type inequality fairly subtle.
On the other hand, the statement (ii) in the last theorem sets a word of warning in the use
of min-max schemes based on the Palais–Smale condition in resonant problems involving
the p-Laplacian. Here a very natural example arises of an equation with a priori estimates
for the solutions for which the Palais–Smale condition in the associated functional fails to
hold. We refer to the paper [49] for details.
Our next result states in particular another interesting difference with the linear case
p = 2. If p ̸= 2, then the set of functions f for which (13.5) with λ = λ1 is solvable has
nonempty interior in L∞(0,πp).
THEOREM 13.6. Let p ̸= 2. Then there exists an open cone C ⊂L∞(0,πp) such that for
all f ∈C problem (13.5) with λ = λ1 has at least two solutions. Moreover
 πp
0
f (t)sinp t dt ̸= 0
(13.10)
for all f ∈C.

Half-linear differential equations
319
A by-product of the proof of this theorem is the following general fact. For any f ∈
L∞(0,πp) such that (13.10) holds, one has that the set of all possible solutions of (13.5)
is bounded and the degree of the associated ﬁxed point operator equals 0. Combining this
and Theorem 13.4 yields in particular that for any f ̸≡0 of the class C1 and p ̸= 2, there
are a priori estimates for the solution set.
The proof of the results presented in this subsection are based on the analysis of the
initial value problem

Φ(x′)
′ + (p −1)Φ(x) = f (t),
x(0) = 0, x′(0) = α,
with f ∈L∞
loc[0,∞). Here, x is a globally deﬁned solution of this problem and for α
sufﬁciently large (positive or negative) a ﬁrst zero tα
1 > 0 exists. Moreover, tα
1 →πp as
|α| →∞. The key matter is a detailed analysis of the relative location of tα
1 with respect
to πp for large |α|. Of course, one has a solution of (13.5) with λ = λ1 whenever tα
1 hits
exactly πp. In particular, in the asymptotic expansion of the dependence of tα
1 on α yields
that under assumptions of Theorem 13.4, one has
tα
a < πp
if p < 2
and
tα
1 > πp,
if p > 2,
whenever |α| is sufﬁciently large.
13.5. Homotopic deformation along p and Leray–Schauder degree
The Leray–Schauder degree of a mapping associated with the investigated BVP is one of
the most frequently used methods when dealing with this problem. In this subsection we
brieﬂy present the main ideas of [52] which deals with solvability of (13.1). First consider
the associated problem

Φp(x′)
′ = f (t),
x(0) = 0 = x(πp),
(13.11)
(note that Φp = Φ) and the energy functional corresponding to this problem
Ψp(x) = 1
p
 πp
0


x′(t)


p dt −
 πp
0
f (t)x(t)dt.
(13.12)
Here we use the index p by Φ and Ψ to stress their dependence on the power p. The
functional Ψp is coercive, continuous and convex over W 1,p
0
(0,πp) and hence it possesses
the unique global minimum which is the critical point and hence a solution of (13.11).
This means that we have correctly deﬁned mapping Gp :Lq(0,πp) →C1[0,πp] which
assigns to the right-hand side f of (13.11) the solution x of this problem. This map-
ping is completely continuous. Moreover, if pn is a real sequence such that pn →p and
fn ∈Lq(0,πp) is such that fn ⇀f ∈Lq(0,πp) (⇀denotes the weak convergence), then
limn→∞Gpn(fn) = Gp(f ) as it is shown in [52].

320
Half-linear differential equations
Now, for ﬁxed p > 1, we deﬁne Tp :C[0,πp] →C[0,πp] by Tp(x) = x −Gp(λΦp(x))
with λ ∈R. Obviously, the equation Tp(x) = 0 has a nontrivial solution if and only if
λ = λn(p) = (p −1)np and this solution is xn(t) = α sinp(nt), α ∈R, α ̸= 0.
The following statement concerns a homotopic deformation along the power p of the
Leray–Schauderdegree of the mapping Tp. Note that the classical result of the linear theory
is that the Leray–Schauder degree of T2 with respect to the ball
B(0,r) :=

u ∈C[0,πp]: ∥u∥C = max
t∈[0,πp]


u(t)


 ⩽r

is
d

T2,B(0,r),0

= (−1)n,
(13.13)
where n is the number of the eigenvalues of (13.2) with p = 2 which are less than λ.
THEOREM 13.7. Let p > 1 be arbitrary, λ ̸= λn(p) = (p −1)np, n ∈N. Then for every
r > 0, the Leray–Schauder degree d(Tp,B(r,0),0) is well deﬁned and satisﬁes
dTp,B(r,0),0 = (−1)n,
(13.14)
where n is the number of eigenvalues of (13.2) which are less than λ.
PROOF. Suppose that p ⩾2 and λ > λ1 = (p −1), i.e., λ = (p −1)(n + s)p for some
s ∈(0,1) and n ∈N. In the remaining cases the idea of the proof is the same. We will show
that d(Tp,B(r,0),0) = (−1)n for every r > 0.
Let Λ:[p,∞) →R be deﬁned by Λ(α) = [(n+s)πα/πp]α, where πα is given by (13.3)
with α instead of p. Obviously, πα depends continuously on α and hence Λ is continuous.
Next, deﬁne the mapping
T (α,x) = x −Gα

Λ(α)Φα(x)

.
The mapping 
G(α,x) := Gα(Λ(α)Φα(x)) is completely continuous and T (α,x) ̸= 0 for
all α ∈[p,∞) (for details see [52, Theorem 4.1]). Hence, from the invariance of the degree
under homotopies and from (13.13) we obtain the required statement.
□
THEOREM 13.8. Suppose that there exists n ∈N such that the nonlinearity g in (13.1)
satisﬁes
λn ⩽a(t) := liminf
|s|→∞
g(t,s)
Φ(s) ⩽limsup
|s|→∞
g(t,s)
Φ(s) =: b(t) ⩽λn+1
uniformly on [0,πp], the ﬁrst and the last inequalities being strict on a subset of positive
measure in [0,πp]. Then the BVP (13.1) has a solution.

Half-linear differential equations
321
PROOF. Let ν ∈(λn,λn+1). According to the previous theorem, it sufﬁces to construct a
homotopic bridge connecting (13.1) with the problem
Φ(x′)′ + νΦ(x) = 0,
x(0) = 0 = x(πp).
The degree of the mapping associated with this problem has been computed in the previous
theorem. This homotopy is deﬁned as follows
H(τ,x) = Gp

τνΦ(x) + (1 −τ)g

t,x(t)

.
Using the standard method it can be proved that there exists r > 0 such that x −H(τ,x) ̸= 0
for x ∈∂B(r,0) for every τ ∈[0,1] if r > 0 is sufﬁciently large. This proof goes by con-
tradiction. Supposing that there exists xn ∈C[0,πp] and with ∥xn∥C →∞and τn ∈[0,1]
such that xn = H(τn,xn), functions v and c are constructed (using essentially the same
construction as in the linear case) in such a way that the half-linear equation

Φ(v′)
′ + c(t)Φ(v) = 0,
v(0) = 0 = v(πp)
with λn ⩽c(t) ⩽λn+1 has a nontrivial solution. Since each of the previous inequalities
is strict on the set of the positive measure, we have a contradiction with the Sturmian
comparison theorem.
□
13.6. Resonance problem
In the previous subsection, the nonlinearity was “situated” between two consecutive eigen-
values, i.e., it did nor “interacted” with the spectrum of the half-linear part. This situation is
usually regarded as a nonuniform nonresonance. Now we deal with the situation when the
nonlinearity is of the form λnΦ(x) + g(x) with a bounded function g, so the nonlinearity
(perhaps, a better terminology would be “nonhalf-linearity”) is “around” an eigenvalue of
the half-linear part. This situation is referred to as the resonant case. The paper of Lan-
desman and Lazer [145] published in 1970 is the pioneering work along this line in the
linear case. Since that time, the conditions ensuring solvability of BVPs in resonance (the
so-called Landesman–Lazer conditions) have been extended in many directions. The next
theorem, taken from [80], establishes the Landesman–Lazer solvability conditions for the
half-linear BVP

Φ(x′)
′ + λnΦ(x) + g(x) = h(t),
x(0) = 0 = x(πp).
(13.15)
It is supposed that there exist ﬁnite limits limx→±∞g(x) = g(±∞). By ϕn we denote
the eigenfunction corresponding to the nth eigenvalue, i.e., λn = (p −1)np, ϕn(t) =
αn sinp(nt), where αn > 0 is such that ∥ϕn∥Lp = 1.

We skip the proof of this statement because of its technical complexity. This proof is
based on a variant of the saddle point theorem and relies on the variational characterization
of eigenvalues of (13.2).
14. Quasilinear and related differential equations
In this section we change the notation which we used throughout the whole treatment. Till
now, q was the conjugate number of p, i.e., q =
p
p−1. In this section q is any real number
satisfying q > 1 and the conjugate number of p will be denoted by p∗. The main part of
this section will be devoted to the equation

r(t)Φp(x′)
′ + c(t)Φq(x) = 0,
Φp(s) = |s|p−2s, Φq(s) := |s|q−2s,
(14.1)
we will brieﬂy treat also some more general equations. The functions r,c satisfy the same
assumptions as in (0.1). Note that using the substitution rΦp(x′) =: u, Equation (14.1) can
be written as the ﬁrst order system of the form
x′ = a1(t)|u|λ1 sgnu,
u′ = a2(t)|x|λ2 sgnx
(14.2)
with suitable functions a1,a2 and real constants λ1,λ2. The last system has been investi-
gated in several papers of Mirzov and the results are summarized in his book [178]. As a
sample of papers dealing with (14.1) and related equations we refer to [16,34,132,144,205]
and the references given therein.

Half-linear differential equations

14.1. Equation (14.1) with constant coefﬁcients
The results of this subsection are taken from [78]. First we focus our attention to the initial
value problem

Φp(x′)
′ + λΦq(x) = 0,
x(0) = a, x′(0) = b.
(14.3)
We will modify the method used in the deﬁnition of the half-linear sine function sinp and
of other half-linear trigonometric functions.
THEOREM 14.1. For any λ ⩾0, the initial value problem (14.3) has a unique solution
deﬁned on the whole real line R.
PROOF. The crucial fact used in the proof is that
|x′(t)|p
p∗
+ λ|x(t)|q
q
= |b|p
p∗+ λ|a|q
q
(14.4)
as can be veriﬁed by differentiation. Clearly, if a = 0 = b, the last identity implies that
the trivial solution is the unique solution. If a = 0 or b = 0, supposing that there are two
different solutions x1,x2 satisfying the same initial condition, we ﬁnd that the absolute
value of their difference z = |x1 −x2| satisﬁes a Gronwall-type inequality and hence z ≡0.
This idea, slightly modiﬁed, applies also to the case when both a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0.

Denote by tα the ﬁrst positive zero of the derivative x′, i.e., x(t) > 0, x′(t) > 0 for t ∈

Half-linear differential equations
14.2. Emden–Fowler type equation
In this subsection we recall very brieﬂy some results concerning asymptotic behavior of
the quasilinear equation (14.1) and of the associated system (14.2). As we have mentioned
before, the solution space (14.1) and of (14.2) is no longer even homogeneous, hence the
investigation of these equations and systems is more complicated than in case of half-linear
equations (0.1). Equation (14.1) and system (14.2) are sometimes called Emden–Fowler
type equation (system) since if p = 2 in (14.1), this equation reduces to Emden–Fowler
equation (1.3) mentioned in Section 1.1.
Recall that a solution x of (14.1) is called the singular solution of the ﬁrst kind if x
becomes eventually trivial, i.e., there exists T ∈R such that x ̸≡0 for t < T and x(t) = 0
for t ⩾T , and a solution x is singular solution of the second kind if there exists a ﬁnite time
T such limt→T −|x(t)| = ∞. The set of singular solution of the ﬁrst and second kind we
will denote by S1 and S2, respectively. A solution which is not singular is called proper.
Recall also the classiﬁcation of nonoscillatory solutions of (0.1) which can be extended
under the assumption that c(t) ̸= 0 for large t also to (14.1)
M+ = x solution of (14.1): ∃tx ⩾0: x(t)x′(t) > 0 fort > tx
,
M−= x solution of (14.1): ∃tx ⩾0: x(t)x′(t) < 0 for t > tx
.
Results of [43,44,178] imply the following statement.
THEOREM 14.3. Suppose that r(t) > 0, c(t) < 0 for large t.
(i) If p = q, i.e., (14.1) reduces to (0.1), then S1 = ∅, S2 = ∅, M−̸= ∅and M+ ̸= ∅.
(ii) If p < q, then S1 = ∅, S2 ̸= ∅, M−̸= ∅.
(iii) If p > q, then S1 ̸= ∅, S2 = ∅and M+ ̸= ∅.
In Section 6 we have seen that certain integrals of functions r,c play an important role in
the asymptotic classiﬁcation of nonoscillatory solutions of (0.1). As an illustration of the
extension of these results to (14.1) we give two statements. The ﬁrst one is proved in [33]
using the Schauder–Tychonov ﬁxed point theorem, while the second one follows from the
results of Kvinikadze [143], see also [33].

Then M+ contains a one parametric family of the so-called strongly increasing solutions,



(14.20)
and a one parametric family of the so-called positive weakly increasing solutions, i.e.,
positive solutions where both limits in (14.20) exists ﬁnitely.
Another results concerning asymptotic properties of nonoscillatory solutions of (14.1)
and of more general equations of this type can be found in [34,35,138,141,180,205,210,
218].
14.3. More about quasilinear equations
The results of this subsection can be found in [120] and concern the equation
Φ(x′)′ + f (t,x) = 0
(14.21)
under the assumptions that the function f satisﬁes sgnf (t,x) = sgnx for t ∈[t0,∞).
THEOREM 14.6. All proper solutions of (14.21) are oscillatory if one of the following
three conditions is satisﬁed:
(i) for all δ > 0
 ∞
inf
δ⩽|y|


f (t,y)

(ii) for some 0 < λ < p −1 and all δ > 0

328
Half-linear differential equations
and there exists a positive continuous function ϕ satisfying
 ∞ϕ(y)dy = ∞, such that
|f (t,y)| ⩾ϕ(|y|) for large t and large |y|.
PROOF. To illustrate ideas used in the proof, we prove the part (ii), the proof of the re-
maining two statements is analogical. Suppose, by contradiction, that (14.21) has a proper
solution x which is positive for large t (if x is negative, we proceed analogically). Then
from (14.21) we have that also x′(t) > 0 and we put w(t) = Φ(x′)
Φ(x) (compare the remark (ii)
in Section 9.1). Then w satisﬁes the Riccati-type equation
w′ + (p −1)|w|p∗+ f (t,x(t))
xp−1(t) = 0,
(14.22)
recall that p∗denotes the conjugate number of p. Multiplying (14.22) by tλ and integrating
over [t0,t], t0 sufﬁciently large, we have

15. Partial differential equations with p-Laplacian
Similarly to the boundary value problems for half-linear ordinary differential equations,
also partial differential equations with p-Laplacian are treated in many papers. Recall that
the p-Laplacian is the partial differential operator
pu(x) := div

∥∇u(x)∥p−2∇u(x)

,
x = (x1,...,xN) ∈RN,
(15.1)

330
Half-linear differential equations
where div := N
k=1
∂
∂xk is the usual divergence operator and ∇u(x) = ( ∂u
∂x1 ,..., ∂u
∂xN ) is
the Hamilton nabla operator.
15.1. Dirichlet BVP with p-Laplacian
In this subsection we deal with the properties of the ﬁrst eigenvalue and the associated
eigenfunction of the Dirichlet boundary value problem
pu + λΦ(u) = 0,
x ∈Ω ⊂Rn,
u(x) = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(15.2)
where Ω is a bounded domain in Rn.
The solution of problem (15.2) is understood in the weak sense; we say that λ is an
eigenvalue if there exists a function u ∈W 1,p
0
(Ω), u ̸≡0, such that

Ω
∥∇u∥p−2⟨∇u,∇η⟩dx = λ

(15.3)
for every η ∈W 1,p

(Ω), where ⟨·,·⟩denotes the scalar product in RN. The function u is
called the eigenfunction.
The ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1 = λ1(Ω) is obtained as the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient
λ1 = inf

Ω ∥∇v∥p dx

Ω |v|p dx ,
(15.4)
where the inﬁmum is taken over all v ∈W 1,p
0
Ω, v ̸≡0. If u realizes the inﬁmum in (15.4),
so does also |u|, this leads immediately to the following statement.
THEOREM 15.1. The eigenfunction u associated with the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1 does not
change its sign in Ω. Moreover, if u ⩾0 then actually u > 0 in the interior of Ω.
PROOF. The statement concerning the positivity of u follows from the Harnack inequality
[213, p. 724].
□
In the proof of the main result of this subsection we will need the following inequalities,
for the proof see [160].

∥w2 −w1∥p
(∥w1∥+ ∥w2∥)2−p ,
(15.6)
where C(p) is a positive constant depending only on p.
The main statement of this subsection reads as follows.
THEOREM 15.2. The ﬁrst eigenvalue of (15.2) is simple and isolated for any bounded
domain Ω ⊂RN.
PROOF. Here we follow Lindqvist’s [160] modiﬁcation of the original proof of Anane [11]
where it is supposed that the boundary ∂Ω is of the Hölder class C2,α. This assumption
on the boundary of Ω is removed in Lindqvist’s proof by introducing the functions u + ε,
v + ε instead of u,v, respectively (used by Anane).
Suppose that u,v are eigenfunctions of (15.3) with λ = λ1. Let ε > 0 and denote vε =
v + ε, uε = u + ε. Further, let η = uε −vp
ε u1−p

for every ε > 0 (here we have used inequality (15.5) with w1 = ∇lguε, w2 = ∇lgvε and
vice versa). In view of (15.8), taking a sequence εk →0+ as k →∞and using Fatou’s
lemma in the previous computations we ﬁnally arrive to the conclusion that v∇u = u∇v
a.e. in Ω. Hence there is a constant κ such that u = κv a.e. in Ω and by continuity this
equality holds everywhere in Ω.
Now we turn the attention to the case 1 < p < 2 where the situation is similar as in the
previous case. Applying the inequality (15.6) in (15.7) we obtain

for every ε > 0. Using (15.8), we again arrive at the desired dependence u = κv for some
constant κ.
As for the isolation of the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1, we proceed as follows. Since λ1 is deﬁned
as the minimum of the quotient (15.4), it is isolated from the left. If v is an eigenfunction
associated with an eigenvalue λ > λ1 then v changes its sign in Ω. In fact, suppose that v
does not change its sign in Ω. Then using the same method as in the previous part of the
proof we get (for details we refer to [11])
0 ⩽

what is a contradiction.
Now, suppose, by contradiction, that there exists a sequence of eigenvalues λn →λ1+
and let un be the sequence of associated eigenfunctions such that ∥un∥= 1. This se-
quence contains a weakly convergent subsequence in W 1,p
0
(Ω), denoted again un, and
hence strongly convergent in Lp(Ω). Since un = −−1
p (Φ(un)) (this is a usual argument
in the theory of partial equations with p-Laplacian, we refer, e.g., to the monograph [103]),
the sequence un converges strongly in W 1,p
0
(Ω) to a function of the W 1,p
0
norm equal to

333
1 associated with λ1. However, by the Jegorov theorem, the sequence un converges uni-
formly to a function u except for a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue measure. However, this
is a contradiction with the fact that the eigenfunction associated with the ﬁrst eigenvalue
does not change its sign in Ω.
□
15.2. Picone’s identity for equations with p-Laplacian
Picone’s identity as presented in this subsection was proved in [118]. However, this identity
can be found in various modiﬁcations (sometimes implicitly) also in other papers, e.g. in
[9,10,83].
Consider a pair of partial differential operators with p-Laplacian
l[u] := div

r(x)∥∇u∥p−2∇u

+ c(x)Φ(u) = 0
and
L[u] := div

R(x)∥∇u∥p−2∇u

+ C(x)Φ(u) = 0.
It is assumed that r,c,R,C are deﬁned in some bounded domain G ⊂RN with piecewise
smooth boundary ∂G and that r,R ∈C1(
G) are positive functions in 
G, and c,C ∈C(
G).
The domain Dl(G) of l is deﬁned to be the set of all functions of the class C1(
G) with
the property that r∥∇u∥p−2∇u ∈C1(G) ∩C(
G). The domain DL(G) of L is deﬁned
similarly.
The proof of the below given N-dimensional extension of Picone’s identity is similar to
that given in Section 1.
THEOREM 15.3. Let u ∈Dl(G), v ∈DL(G) and v(x) ̸= 0 for x ∈G. Then

As a consequence of Theorem 15.3 we have the following extension of the Leighton
comparison theorem. The proof of this statement is again similar to the “ordinary” case,
compare Section 8.1.
THEOREM 15.4. Suppose that the boundary ∂G is of the class C1. If there exists a non-
trivial solution u ∈Dl(G) of l[u] = 0 such that u = 0 on ∂G and

G
R(x) −r(x)∥∇u∥p −C(x) −c(x)|u|pdx ⩽0,
then every solution v ∈DL(G) of L[v] = 0 must vanish at some point of G, unless v is a
constant multiple of u.
Another consequence of Picone’s identity is the following Sturmian separation theorem.
THEOREM 15.5. Suppose that G is the same as in the previous theorem and there exists
a nontrivial solution u ∈Dl(G) of l[u] = 0 with u = 0 on ∂G. Then every solution v of
l[u] = 0 must vanish at some point of G, unless v is a constant multiple of u.
REMARK 15.1. (i) There exist numerous papers dealing with various oscillation and spec-
tral properties of PDEs with p-Laplacian. We recall here at least the papers [12,18,47,48,
70,75,80], but this is only a very limited sample of papers where equations with the p-
Laplacian are treated.

15.3. Second eigenvalue of p-Laplacian
In this subsection we brieﬂy mention the results of the paper [13] which deals with the
variational description of the second eigenvalue of p-Laplacian and with a nodal domain
property of the associated eigenfunction. We again suppose that Ω is a bounded domain in
Rn.
We consider the eigenvalue problem (15.2) and we introduce the functionals
A(u) = 1
p

Ω
∥∇u∥p dx,
B(u) = 1
p

Ω
|u|p dx,
F(u) = A2(u) −B(u).
It is clear that the critical point u of F associated to a critical value c (i.e., F(u) = c and
F ′(u) = 0) is an eigenfunction associated to the eigenvalue
λ =
1
2√−c.
Conversely, if u ̸= 0 is an eigenfunction associated to a positive eigenvalue λ, v =
(2λA(u))−1
p u will be also an eigenfunction associated to λ =
1
2A(v) and v is a critical
point of F associated to the critical value c = −1
4λ2 .
Let us consider the sequence {cn}n∈N deﬁned by
cn = inf
K∈An
sup
v∈K
F(v),
(15.10)
where
An =

K ∈W 1,p
0
(Ω): K symmetrical compact and γ (K) ⩾n

and γ (K) denotes the Krasnoselskii genus of K, i.e., the minimal integer n such that there
exists a continuous odd mapping of K →Rn\{0}. It can be proved (using the Palais–Smale
condition for F) that the sequence cn consists of the critical values of F and cn →0−. The
sequence of eigenvalues λn deﬁned by
λn =
1
2√−cn
(15.11)
is positive, nondecreasing and tends to ∞. Note that it is an open problem whether (15.11)
describes all eigenvalues of (15.2) (in contrast to the scalar case N = 1, compare Sec-
tion 13.2).
We denote by Z(u) = {x ∈Ω: u(x) = 0} the so-called nodal contour of the function u
and let N(u) denote the number of components (the so-called nodal domains) of Ω \Z(u).
For each eigenfunction u associated to λ we deﬁne
N(λ) = max

N(u): u is a solution of (15.2)

.

336
Half-linear differential equations
Now, at the end of this subsection, we present without proof the main result of [13].
In contrast to the scalar case, it is not known whether (15.10) and (15.11) describe all
eigenvalues of (15.2). The next statement shows, among others, that the second eigenvalue
λ2 can be characterized by (15.11).
THEOREM 15.6. For each eigenvalue λ of (15.2) λN(λ) ⩽λ. Moreover, the value λ2 given
by (15.11) satisﬁes
λ2 = infλ: λ positive eigenvalue of (15.2), λ > λ1
.
15.4. Equations involving pseudolaplacian

(15.13)
For Equation (15.12) we can establish oscillation theory and theory for eigenvalue prob-
lems similar to that for classical p-Laplacian. An important role in this theory is played by
the following Picone-type identity. For its proof and other results concerning PDEs with
pseudolaplacian we refer to [25,26,28,62] and the reference given therein.

16. Half-linear difference equations
In the last two decades, a considerable attention has been devoted to the oscillation theory
of the Sturm–Liouville difference equation
(rkxk) + ckxk+1 = 0,
(16.1)
where xk = xk+1 −xk is the usual forward difference, r,c are real-valued sequences and
rk ̸= 0. Oscillation theory parallel to that for the Sturm–Liouville differential equation (1.1)
has been established and almost all oscillation and nonoscillation criteria have now their

338
Half-linear differential equations
discrete counterparts for (16.1). We refer to monographs [1,6,124] for general background.
Basic tools of the linear discrete oscillation theory are the discrete quadratic functional

A natural idea, suggested by similarity of oscillation theories for linear equation (1.1)
and half-linear equation (0.1), is to look for half-linear extension of these results and to
establish a discrete half-linear oscillation theory parallel to that for (0.1). Therefore, the
subject of this section is the half-linear difference equation


rkΦ(xk)

+ ckΦ(xk+1) = 0,
(16.3)
where r,c are real-valued sequences and rk ̸= 0. We will see that the results for (16.3) are
similar to those for (0.1), but the proofs are sometimes more difﬁcult. The reason is that the
calculus of ﬁnite differences and sums is sometimes more cumbersome than the differential
and integral calculus. For example, we have no discrete analogue of the chain rule for the
differentiation of the composite function. On the other hand, there are some points where
the discrete calculus is “easier”, for example, if an inﬁnite series ∞ak is convergent,
we have limn→∞an = 0, while the convergence of the integral
 ∞f (t)dt gives generally
no information about limt→∞f (t). Most of the results of this section are taken from the
papers of ˇRehák [194–199].
16.1. Roundabout theorem for half-linear difference equations
The basic results of the discrete half-linear oscillation theory are established in the series
of papers [194–199]. Here we present principal results of this theory.
First of all, let us note that in contrast to the continuous case, there is no problem with
the existence and uniqueness for solutions of (16.3). Expanding the forward differences,
this equation can be written as
rk+1Φ(xk+2 −xk+1) −rkΦ(xk+1 −xk) + ckΦ(xk+1) = 0

Half-linear differential equations
339
and hence
xk+2 = xk+1 + Φ−1
 1
rk+1
rkΦ(xk+1 −xk) −ckΦ(xk+1)
.
This means that given the initial conditions x0 = A,x1 = B, we can compute explicitly all
other xk. Moreover, given any N ∈N, the values x2,...,xN depend continuously (in the
norm of RN−1) on x0,x1. Let us also emphasize that general discrete oscillation theory can
be established under the mere assumption rk ̸= 0, while we have to suppose that r(t) > 0
in the continuous case.
Oscillatory properties of (16.3) are deﬁned using the concept of generalized zero points.
We say that an interval (m,m + 1] contains a generalized zero of a solution x of (16.3) if
xm ̸= 0 and xmxm+1rm ⩽0. If rm > 0, a generalized zero of x is just the zero of x at m + 1
or the sign change xmxm+1 < 0.
THEOREM 16.1. The following statements are equivalent:
(i) Equation (16.3) is disconjugate on [0,N], i.e., the solution ˜x given by the initial
conditions ˜x0 = 0, r0Φ(˜x1) = 1 has no generalized zero in (0,N + 1].
(ii) There exists a solution of (16.3) having no generalized zero in [0,N + 1].
(iii) There exists a solution w of the Riccati-type difference equation (related to (16.3)
by the substitution wk = rkΦ(xk/xk))

(16.4)
which is deﬁned for every k ∈[0,N + 1] and satisﬁes rk + wk > 0 for k ∈[0,N].
(iv) The discrete p-degree functional

k=0
rk|yk|p −ck|yk+1|2
is positive for every nontrivial y = {yk}N+1
k=0 satisfying y0 = 0 = yN+1.
PROOF. (i) ⇒(ii): Consider the solution x of (16.3) given by the initial condition x0 = ε,
x1 = Φ−1(1/r0), where ε > 0 is sufﬁciently small. Then according to the above men-
tioned continuous dependence of x2,...,xN+1 on x0,x1 we still have rkxkxk+1 > 0,
k = 1,...,N, when ε > 0 is sufﬁciently small, and r0x0x1 > 0 as well, i.e., the solution x
has no generalized zero in [0,N + 1].
(ii) ⇒(iii): Let x be a solution of (16.3) having no generalized zeros in [0,N + 1], and
let wk = rkΦ(xk)
Φ(xk) . Then
wk = (rkΦ(xk))Φ(xk) −rkΦ(xk)(Φ(xk+1) −Φ(xk))

hence rkxkxk+1 > 0 if and only if Φ−1(rk)+Φ−1(wk) > 0, i.e., if and only if rk +wk > 0.

wk+1 = −ck +

Using the fact that y0 = 0 = yN+1, the summation of the last equality from k = 0 to k = N
gives
Fd(y;0,N) = rk|yk|p −
rkwk|yk + yk|p
Φ(Φ−1(wk) + Φ−1(rk)) −wk|yk|p.
(16.5)
The right-hand side of (16.5) is always nonnegative and it is zero if and only if wk =
rkΦ(yk/yk) (see [195]), but this means that y ≡0 since y0 = 0. Hence Fd(y;0,N) > 0
for every nontrivial y with y0 = 0 −yN+1.
(iv) ⇒(i): Suppose that Fd > 0 and (16.3) is not disconjugate in [0,N + 1], i.e., the
solution x given by the initial condition x0 = 0, x1 = Φ−1(1/r0) has a generalized zero in
the interval [0,N + 1], i.e., rmxmxm+1 < 0 or xm+1 = 0 for some m ∈{1,...,N}. Deﬁne

REMARK 16.1. (i) The previous theorem shows that (16.3) can be classiﬁed as oscillatory
or nonoscillatory in the same way as in the continuous case. Equation (16.3) is said to be
nonoscillatory if there exists N ∈N such that (16.3) is disconjugate on [N,M] for every
M > N, in the opposite case (16.3) is said to be oscillatory.
(ii) Theorem 16.1 also shows that not only Sturmian separation, but also Sturmian com-
parison theorem extends verbatim to (16.3). In particular, if 0 ̸= Rk ⩽rk and Ck ⩾ck for
large k and the equations


RkΦ(yk)


is nonoscillatory, then (16.3) is also nonoscilatory. The argument in the proof of this state-
ment is the same as that for (0.1).
16.2. Discrete Leighton–Wintner criterion

bation of the one-term equation


rkΦ(xk)

= 0.
(16.6)
In accordance with the continuous case, we need (16.6) to be nonoscillatory in this ap-
proach, so we suppose that rk > 0 for large k, otherwise this equation is oscillatory—each
sign change of rk is a generalized zero of the constant solution xk ≡1.

In Section 9 we have presented an alternative proof of the continuous Leighton–Wintner
criterion—based on the Riccati technique. Next we show difﬁculties in the attempt to fol-
low this idea also in the discrete case. The “Riccati” proof goes by contradiction. Suppose
that (16.7) holds and (16.3) is nonoscillatory, i.e., there exists a solution of (16.4) satisfy-
ing rk + wk > 0 for large k. The summation of (16.4) from N to k −1, where N,k are

(16.9)
and integrating this inequality we got

The discrete analogue of (16.9) is the inequality wk ⩽Gk and to get a contradiction
from this inequality is a difﬁcult problem even in the linear case p = 2.
16.3. Riccati inequality
The equivalence of disconjugacy of (16.3) and solvability of (16.4) (satisfying rk + wk >
0), coupled with the Sturmian comparison theorem for (16.3) mentioned in Remark 16.1,
lead to the following reﬁnement of the Riccati equivalence.
THEOREM 16.3. Equation (16.3) is nonoscillatory if and only if there exists a sequence
wk, with rk + wk > 0 for large k, such that
R[wk] := wk + ck + wk

⩽0.
(16.10)
PROOF. The part “only if” follows immediately from Theorem 16.1. For the part “if”, let
us denote l[uk] := (rkΦ(uk)) + ckΦ(uk+1). We will show that if there exists uk such
that
rkukuk+1 > 0
and
uk+1l[uk] ⩽0
(16.11)

344
Half-linear differential equations
for k ∈[N,∞), N ∈N, then (16.3) is disconjugate on [N,∞) and thus nonoscillatory.
Therefore, suppose that a sequence uk satisfying (16.11) on [N,∞) exists. Then Sk :=
−uk+1l[uk] is a nonnegative sequence on this discrete interval. Further, set ˜rk = rk and
˜ck = ck −Sk/|uk+1|p. Hence ˜ck ⩾ck and
˜rkΦ(uk) + ˜ckΦ(uk+1) = rkΦ(uk) +

Φ(uk+1) = 0.
Thus equation (˜rkΦ(uk)) + ˜ckΦ(uk+1) = 0 is disconjugate on [N,∞) and therefore
(16.3) is also disconjugate on [N,∞) by Sturm comparison theorem.
To ﬁnish the proof, it remains to ﬁnd a sequence uk satisfying (16.11). Let wk satisfy
(16.10) with rk + wk > 0 on [N,∞) and let

16.4. Hille–Nehari nonoscillation criterion
The following theorem is the discrete version of Theorem 5.4. This statement is one of the

PROOF. It is sufﬁcient to show that the generalized Riccati inequality (16.10) has a so-
lution w with rk + wk > 0 in a neighborhood of inﬁnity. We recommend the reader to
compare this proof with the proof of Theorem 5.4 to see difference between discrete and
continuous case.

REMARK 16.2. If we compare the previous statement with Theorem 5.4 (which is a con-
tinuous counterpart of this theorem), we see that assumption (16.12) has no continuous
analogue. This is a consequence of the fact that we have no equivalence of the differen-
tiation chain rule in the discrete case, and its partial discrete substitution—the Lagrange
mean value theorem—need additional assumptions.
16.5. Half-linear dynamic equations on time scales
By a time scale T (an alternative terminology is measure chain) we understand any closed
subset of the real numbers R with the usual topology inherited from R. Typical examples
of time scales are T = R and T = Z – the set of integers. The operators ρ,σ :T →T are
deﬁned by
σ(t) = inf{s ∈T: s > t},
ρ(t) = sup{s ∈T: s < t}
and are called the right jump operator and left jump operator, respectively. The quantity
μ(t) = σ(t) −t is called the graininess of T. If f :T →R, the generalized -derivative is
deﬁned by
f (t) =
lim
s→t, σ(s)̸=t
f (σ(s)) −f (t)
σ(s) −t
and f (t) = f ′(t) if T = R and f (t) = f (t) = f (t + 1) −f (t).
Now consider the linear dynamic equation on a time scale T

r(t)x + c(t)xσ = 0,
(16.18)
where xσ = x ◦σ and r,c :T →R, and its half-linear extension

r(t)Φ

x + c(t)Φ

xσ
= 0.
(16.19)

Half-linear differential equations

Obviously, (16.19) reduces to (0.1) if T = R and to (16.3) if T = Z, respectively. The basic
facts of the time scale calculus can be found in [109] and the general theory of dynamic
equations on time scales is presented in [29,30].
Concerning (16.18), oscillation theory of this dynamic equation is established in [97].
The half-linear extension of this theory can be found in the recent paper [200], where it is
shown that under the assumption r(t) ̸= 0, the times scale Riccati equation
w + c(t) + S[w,r](t) = 0,
where
S[w,r](t) =

Abstract
This paper constitutes a short survey of the subject of radial solutions for quasilinear elliptic
partial differential equations where the underlying domain is either a ball, an annular region,
the exterior of a ball, or the whole space. In case the dependence of the equation on the
independent variable is only in the radial direction, special solutions of such equations may be
sought which depend only on the radial variable and as such are solutions of a boundary value
problem for an associated nonlinear ordinary differential equation.

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
361
1. Introduction
In this paper we provide a survey of several results concerning radial solutions of qua-
silinear partial differential equations where the independent variable is a spatial variable
varying over a domain with radial symmetry, such as a ball centered at the origin, an an-
nular domain determined by concentric spheres centered at the origin, an exterior domain
exterior to a ball, or the whole space. If the equation at hand also has the property that
the dependence upon the independent variable is radial, then special radial solutions of the
problem at hand may be sought and it is often the case that certain solutions having special
properties, in fact, must be radial solutions.
The situation is well illustrated by the very classical problem of ﬁnding the radial eigen-
values and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator subject to zero Dirichlet boundary condi-
tions on the unit disk in the plane. Another illustration is the following classical Liouville–
Gelfand problem which is concerned with the existence of positive solutions of the equa-
tion
u + λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(1.1)
where λ > 0 and Ω is a bounded domain in RN. If it is the case that Ω = {x ∈RN:
|x| < 1} := B1(0), then it is reasonable to ask whether Equation (1.1) has solutions which
only depend upon the radial variable. It follows from the maximum principle for elliptic
equations that solutions of (1.1) can only assume positive values in the interior of the
domain and then it follows by the classical result of Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg [50] that all
solutions of (1.1) are radially symmetric and (1.1) is equivalent to the ordinary differential
equation’s boundary value problem

u′′ + N−1
r
u′ + λeu = 0,
r ∈(0,1),
u′(0) = u(1) = 0,
(1.2)
for the proﬁle u(r) = u(|x|). Note that the originally discrete parameter N is now allowed
to vary continuously. The results of [50] are valid for much more general situations and it
follows that if f :R →R is a suitably smooth function (e.g., Lipschitz continuous), then
any positive solution of
u + f (u) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(1.3)
with Ω a ball, must be radially symmetric about the center of the ball and similar results
hold for the case that Ω is the whole space or a suitable exterior domain. It, on the other
hand fails to hold for the case that Ω is an annular domain, in which case it often may
happen that radial solutions undergo symmetry breaking bifurcations (some such results
will be discussed in this paper).
If it is the case that
Ω =

x ∈RN: 0 < a < |x| < b

,

362

then radial solutions of (1.3) are solutions of the boundary value problem

u′′ + N−1
r
u′ + f (u) = 0,
r ∈(a,b),
u(a) = u(b) = 0.
(1.4)
For N = 1 these problems are amenable to reduction of order methods, and hence may
be explicitly solved. For other values of N, this is, of course, no longer the case in gen-
eral and other methods must be employed to study the solution structure of a given equa-
tion. We shall give a detailed account of problems related to (1.1) and related equations,
a subject that dates back to Liouville in 1853 [71]. In 1914 Bratu [15] found an explicit
solution to (1.2) when N = 2. Numerical progress for (1.2) when N = 3 was made by
Frank-Kamenetskii (see [40]) in his study of thermal ignition problems. Further progress
for N = 3 was made by Chandrasekhar [20, IV: §22–27], where (1.2) appears as a model
for the temperature distribution of an isothermal gas sphere in gravitational equilibrium.
Gelfand [49] built upon Frank-Kamenetskii’s work when N = 3 and used Emden’s trans-
formation to prove the existence of a value of λ for which (1.2) has inﬁnitely many non-
trivial solutions.
In 1973 Joseph and Lundgren [61] completely characterized the solution structure
of (1.2) for all N and hence, because of [50] also of the corresponding problem (1.1)
in the case the domain is a ball. Other related examples arise from a larger class of partial
differential operators, for example the work of Clément, de Figueiredo, and Mitidieri [22],
Azorero and Alonso [44], Jacobsen [57], and Jacobsen and Schmitt [59], who consider
existence and multiplicity results for the model equations
pu + λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(1.5)
where p = div(|∇u|p−2∇u) is the p-Laplace operator [56,74] and

Sk

D2u

+ λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(1.6)
where Sk(D2u) is the k-Hessian operator [108], deﬁned as the sum of all principal k × k
minors of the Hessian matrix D2u. For instance S1(D2u) = u and SN(D2u) = detD2u,
the Monge–Ampère operator.
Note that both equations are extensions of (1.1). In particular, the results of Joseph and
Lundgren explain the radial case of (1.5) for p = 2 and of (1.6) when k = 1. In [22], the
authors consider (among other topics) the radial case of both (1.5) for p = N and (1.6) for
N = 2k.
All of the above problems are simply special cases of the more general family of prob-
lems

(1.8)
where certain inequalities are to be imposed on the parameters involved in the equation.
Here ′ denotes differentiation with respect to r. For instance, if Ω = B1(0) is the unit ball,
then Equation (1.7) with f (λ,u) = λeu arises from (1.5) and (1.6) as a consequence of
a priori symmetry results (see [35] for (1.6) and [7] for (1.5)). Similar problems may be
posed also for exterior domain and whole space problems.
Much work has also been devoted to boundary value problems and other qualitative
studies for more general differential operators of the form
r−γ 
rαφ(u′)
′ + f (λ,u) = 0,
(1.9)
where φ :R →R is an increasing homeomorphism of R, with φ(0) = 0. Such problems
arise in a very natural way in diffusion problems where diffusion is governed by rapidly
growing terms. We shall survey some such problems below.
In most of the discussion to follow the parameter α is taken to equal the parameter γ
and is denoted by N −1, to indicate the partial differential equation origin of the problem,
where N denotes the dimension of the underlying domain. In the discussion, however,
N −1 may simply denote a nonnegative parameter. The equations stated above also may
depend on other parameters, denoted by λ, which dependence may be in a linear or nonlin-
ear fashion, thus this parameter may occur as a multiplicative factor or simply as a variable
in the function evaluation. Should this parameter play no role in the result at hand, we
simply shall suppress the dependence.
The paper is organized as follows: We ﬁrst discuss boundary value problems on a ball
related to the differential operator (1.9) and rely mainly on the recent work in [45–47,54,
53]. We then proceed to discuss problems on annular domains based on some work in [9,10,
25,30,29,74]. Next, we present a detailed discussion of Gelfand type problems. Following
the Gelfand case study we return to general theory and present a range of related topics
including some classical oscillation and nonoscillation theorems, problems for which radial
solutions can undergo symmetry breaking bifurcations (relying on work in [67,68,80–82]),
and problems concerning radial ground states of problems deﬁned in all of space.
We shall denote by ∥· ∥the supremum norm in C[a,b] for any interval [a,b] ⊂R.
2. Boundary value problems on a ball
2.1. Introduction
In this section, we consider the existence of positive solutions for the boundary value prob-
lems
rN−1φ(u′)′ + λrN−1f (u) = 0,
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.1)

J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
where φ is an odd increasing homeomorphism on R and λ is a positive parameter (i.e., we
consider the case that α = γ = N −1).
As pointed out before, Equation (2.1) arises in the study of radial solutions for quasilin-
ear elliptic boundary value problems of the form

div

A(∇u)

+ λf (u) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(2.2)
where Ω is a ball of radius R in RN.
We ﬁrst discuss existence results for (2.1) when f (0) = 0. These results are of bifurca-
tion type and are based on the work [45,46]. We then discuss the cases when f (0) < 0 or
f (0) > 0, and f is φ superlinear at ∞. In the former case there exists a positive, decreas-
ing solution to (2.1) for λ small. The asymptotic behavior of the solution (as λ →0) will
also discussed. This generalizes the results in [19,2] (see also [100]) in which φ(x) = x,
and complements those in [31,74] where similar problems were considered on an annulus.
In the latter case, there exists a positive number λ∗such that (2.1) has at least two positive
solutions for λ < λ∗, at least one for λ = λ∗, and none for λ > λ∗. This result complements
corresponding results in [3,29] on annular domains. We refer to [100] for the literature on
problem (2.2) with A(x) = x on bounded domains. The approach used here depends on
degree theory and also uses results about upper and lower solutions. Such results can be
found in, for example, Lloyd [72], Berger [13], Deimling [32], and Schmitt [99].
2.2. The case when f (0) = 0
The prototypical example in this case is the partial differential equation
u + up = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(2.3)
where p > 1. Note that u = 0 is a solution to (2.3). One approach to ﬁnding nontrivial
solutions is to consider it as a perturbation of an eigenvalue equation
u + λu + up = 0,
(2.4)
and study solution continua, i.e., curves in the solution set
S = (λ,u): (λ,u) satisﬁes (2.4).
For instance, if S contains a point (0,u) with u ̸= 0, then we obtain a nontrivial solution
to (2.3). Viewing (2.1) with this motivation, we now consider the equation

−r1−NrN−1φ(u′)′ = λψ(u) + g(λ,u),
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.5)

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations

where φ :R →R and ψ :R →R are odd increasing homeomorphisms of R, which both
vanish at the origin. We further assume that g(λ,0) = 0 for all λ ∈R. A solution to Equa-
tion (2.5) is a function u ∈C1[0,R] with φ(u′) ∈C1[0,R] which satisﬁes (2.5).
Furthermore we will require that φ,ψ satisfy the asymptotic homogeneity conditions:
lim
s→0
φ(σs)
ψ(s) = σ p−1,
for all σ ∈R+, for some p > 1,
(2.6)
and
lim
s→±∞
φ(σs)
ψ(s) = σ q−1,
for all σ ∈R+, for some q > 1.
(2.7)
We note that if the pair φ,ψ satisﬁes the asymptotic homogeneity conditions (2.6)
and (2.7), then the function φ satisﬁes both of these conditions with ψ replaced by φ
and also ψ satisﬁes both of these conditions with φ replaced by ψ. Such conditions appear
in a variety of contexts (see, e.g., [95]).
Let u(r) be a solution of (2.5). By integrating the equation in (2.5) we see that u(r)
satisﬁes the integral equation

2.2.1. Index calculations.
Let us consider (2.5) with g = 0:

−r1−N
rN−1φ(u′)
′ = λψ(u),
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0.
(2.9)
A value λ such that (2.9) has a nontrivial solution is called an eigenvalue of (2.9).
From (2.8) it follows that u is a solution if and only if u is a ﬁxed point of the completely
continuous operator T λ :C[0,R] →C[0,R] deﬁned by

If φ(t) = ψ(t) = |t|p−2t, then it is known that the eigenvalue problem (2.9) has a se-
quence of eigenvalues {λm = λm(p), m = 1,2,...}, with λm(p) →∞, as λ →∞, and
this set has been completely described (see, e.g., [34,36] and the earlier papers [4,69]). We
need the following lemma from [46]:
LEMMA 2.1. Consider the problem (2.9).

• If (2.6) holds, then the Leray–Schauder degree of I −T λ is deﬁned for B(0,ε), (the
open ball centered at zero with radius ε in C[0,R]), for all sufﬁciently small ε. Fur-
thermore we have

(2.11)
• If (2.7) holds, then the Leray–Schauder degree for I −T λ is deﬁned for B(0,M), for
all sufﬁciently large M, and a similar formula to (2.11) holds, namely
degLS

I −T λ,B(0,M),0

(2.12)
where {λl(q), l = 1,2,...} is the set of eigenvalues of (2.9) with φ(t) = ψ(t) =
|t|q−2t.
Lemma 2.1 may be applied to obtain an existence result for nontrivial solutions.
THEOREM 2.2. Consider problem (2.9) and suppose that φ,ψ are odd increasing home-
omorphisms of R with φ(0) = 0 = ψ(0), which satisfy (2.6) and (2.7) with p ̸= q. Assume
that for some j ∈N, λj(p) ̸= λj(q) and that λ ∈(A,B), where A = min{λj(p),λj(q)}
and B = max{λj(p),λj(q)}. Assume furthermore that (A,B) does not contain any other
eigenvalue from {λm(p)} or {λm(q)}. Then problem (2.9) has a nontrivial solution.
PROOF. Assuming for example that λj(q) > λj(p), it follows from Lemma 2.1 that
degLS

I −T λ,B(0,ε),0

= (−1)j,
(2.13)
for ε > 0 small, and that
degLS

I −T λ,B(0,M),0

= (−1)j−1,
(2.14)
for M large. Thus combining (2.13) and (2.14) with the excision property of the Leray–
Schauder degree, we obtain that
degLS

I −T λ,B(0,M) \ B(0,ε),0

̸= 0,
(2.15)
yielding the existence of a nontrivial solution with ε < ∥u∥< M.
□
This theorem suggests the existence of a branch of solutions to (2.5) connecting
(λj(p),0) with (λj(q),∞), for each j ∈N, generalizing the well-known property for the
homogeneous case. We will return to the structure of the eigenvalue set in Section 2.2.4.

(2.16)
which will be needed in the next section. Throughout we shall assume that
ug(λ,u) ⩾0,
for all λ,u ∈R.
(2.17)
The following proposition follows from an application of the contraction mapping principle
applied to (2.8):
PROPOSITION 2.3. Suppose that g(λ,u) = O(|ψ(u)|) near zero, uniformly for r and λ in

(2.18)
with r0 ∈[0,R] is the trivial solution u = 0.
The next result concerns the oscillation of nontrivial solutions.
PROPOSITION 2.4. Suppose that g(λ,u) = O(|ψ(u)|) near zero, uniformly for λ in
bounded intervals, then nontrivial solutions of the initial value problem (2.16) are oscilla-
tory, i.e., solutions are deﬁned on all of [0,∞) and have inﬁnitely many zeros.

PROOF. Let u be a nontrivial solution of (2.16) and assume that d > 0. If u does not vanish
in (0,∞), then u is decreasing on (0,∞). Integrating the equation from 0 to s ∈(0,r) we

hand side can be arbitrarily large. Hence we conclude that u must have a zero which, by
Proposition 2.3, is simple.

and are oscillatory on the whole real line.
For each d ̸= 0, let ρd denote the ﬁrst zero of a solution u of (2.5) such that u(0) = d. The
next two propositions show that solutions to (2.5) have Sturm type separation properties as
one has for linear equations (see, e.g., [55]):
PROPOSITION 2.5. Suppose that g(λ,u) = O(|ψ(u)|) near zero, uniformly for λ in
bounded intervals. Then, for each R > 0 there exists Λ(R) such that for all λ > Λ(R)
and all d ̸= 0 we have that ρd ⩽R.
PROPOSITION 2.6. Let ρdj denote the jth zero of a solution u of (2.5) such that u(0) = d
and suppose that g(λ,u) = O(|ψ(u)|) near zero, uniformly for λ in bounded intervals.
Then, for all L > 0 and j ∈N there exists Λj(L) > 0 such that for all λ > Λj(L) and all
d ̸= 0 we have that ρdj ⩽L.

2.2.3. Bifurcation of solutions.
In this section we consider bifurcation problems at zero
and at inﬁnity. See [21,32,94,64] for deﬁnitions.
Let u be a solution of problem (2.5). Then u satisﬁes
u = F(λ,u)

(2.25)
It is clear that F :R × C[0,R] →C[0,R] and it is a completely continuous operator. Con-
cerning (2.24), the following theorem is proved by a standard argument which considers a
sequence of solutions approaching a bifurcation point, appropriately renormalized to take
advantage of the condition on g:
THEOREM 2.7. (i) Suppose that g :R × R →R is continuous and satisﬁes g(λ,s) =
o(|φ(s)|) near s = 0 uniformly for λ in bounded intervals, and that φ and ψ satisfy (2.6).
If (¯λ,0) is a bifurcation point for (2.24), then ¯λ = λm(p), for some m ∈N.
(ii) Suppose that g :R × R →R is continuous and satisﬁes g(λ,s) = o(|φ(s)|) near
inﬁnity, uniformly for λ in bounded intervals, and that φ and ψ satisfy (2.7). If (¯λ,∞) is a
bifurcation point for (2.24), then ¯λ = λm(q), for some m ∈N.
The next theorem is the main result on bifurcation of solutions to (2.24):
THEOREM 2.8. Suppose that g :R × R →R is continuous and satisﬁes g(λ,s) =
o(|φ(s)|) near s = 0, uniformly for λ in bounded intervals.
(i) If φ and ψ satisfy (2.6), then for each k ∈N there is a connected component Sk ⊂
R × C[0,1] of the set of nontrivial solutions of (2.5) whose closure Sk contains
(λk(p),0). Moreover, Sk is unbounded in R × C[0,1] and if (λ,u) ∈Sk, then u has
exactly k −1 simple zeros in (0,R).
(ii) If ug(λ,u) ⩾0, then there exists Mk ∈(0,∞) such that if (λ,u) ∈Sk, then λ ⩽Mk.
PROOF. The proof of the existence of the connected component Sk such that (λk(p),0)
belongs to Sk and that Sk is unbounded or contains another bifurcation point (λj(p),0),
j ̸= k, is entirely similar to that of [94]. The fact that (λk(p),0) ∈Sk and that (λ,u) ∈Sk
implies u has exactly k −1 simple zeros in (0,R) is in turn similar to that of Theorem 4.1
of [34] and uses the results of Section 2.2.2. The existence of Mk such that λ ⩽Mk follows
directly from Proposition 2.6.
□
The following will serve as examples to illustrate the above results.
THEOREM 2.9. Suppose that φ,ψ are odd increasing homeomorphisms of R with φ(0) =
ψ(0) = 0, which satisfy (2.6) and (2.7) with p ̸= q and ug(λ,u) ⩾0. Then for any j ∈N,

370
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
there exists a connected component Sj of the set on nontrivial solutions of (2.5) connecting
(λj(p),0) to (λj(q),∞) such that (λ,u) ∈Sj implies u has exactly j −1 simple zeros in
(0,R).
PROOF. It follows from Theorem 2.8 that for any j ∈N, there exists an unbounded con-
nected component Sj of the set on nontrivial solutions emanating from (λj(p),0) such that
(λ,u) ∈Sj implies u has exactly j −1 simple zeros in (0,R). Since there is an Mj such
that (λ,u) ∈Sk implies that λ ⩽Mk and since there are no nontrivial solutions of (2.5) for
λ = 0, it follows that for any M > 0, there is (λ,u) ∈Sk such that ∥u∥> M. Hence (ii) of
Theorem 2.7 implies that as ∥u∥→∞with (λ,u) ∈Sk, it must be that λ →λj(q).
□
The second application is motivated by a result of [34].
THEOREM 2.10. Consider the problem

−

rN−1φ(u′)
′ = rN−1g(u),
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0.
(2.26)
Assume φ is an increasing homeomorphisms of R with φ(0) = 0 and which satisﬁes (2.6)
and (2.7) with φ = ψ. Further suppose that g :R →R is continuous with ug(u) ⩾0 and
that there exist positive integers k and n, with k ⩽n, such that
μ := lim
|s|→0
g(s)
φ(s) < λk(p) ⩽λn(q) < ν := lim
|s|→∞
g(s)
φ(s).
Then for each integer j ∈(k,n) Equation (2.26) has a solution with exactly j −1 simple
zeros in (0,R). Thus (2.26) possesses at least n −k + 1 nontrivial solutions.
2.2.4. On principal eigenvalues.
We next present results concerning the existence of pos-
itive solutions to the problem

−r1−N
rN−1φ(u′)
′ = λψ(u),
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.27)
where φ is an increasing homeomorphism of R and ψ is nondecreasing with φ(0) =
ψ(0) = 0. A constant λ such that (2.27) has a positive (or negative) solution is called a
principal eigenvalue. Note that Theorem 2.2 established the existence of solution branches
to (2.27) which may or may not correspond to positive solutions.
In the case that N is a positive integer and φ(u) = |u|p−2u = ψ(u) the above problem
is the problem of the existence of the principal eigenvalue of the p-Laplacian on a ball of
radius R in RN, subject to zero Dirichlet boundary data. As such it is well understood (see,
e.g., [4,14,41,43,103]).
The tools that have been used for establishing the existence of such (and higher) eigen-
values come from variational methods and are usually critical point theorems for smooth
functionals deﬁned in an appropriate Sobolev space; these methods consequently also yield

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
371
theorems for the case the underlying ball domain is replaced by an arbitrary bounded do-
main.
Here we discuss the general case (2.27) and rely on ﬁxed point and continuation tech-
niques based on some work in [29,46]. For the special case N = 1, very detailed informa-
tion is available in [34,48].
We will assume further that N ⩾1 (not necessarily an integer) and φ and ψ satisfy for
all x ̸= 0 and σ > 0,
A(σ) ⩽φ(σ|s|)
ψ(|s|) ⩽B(σ),
(2.28)
where A(σ) and B(σ) are positive constants depending on σ only.
We introduce some notation to discuss the structure of the eigenvalue set. First, let E
denote the set of all principal eigenvalues. Next, for each d > 0, let Γ (d,R) be deﬁned by
Γ (d,R) =

λ > 0 | (2.27) has a positive solution with u(0) = d

(2.29)
and set
Γ −(d,R) = infΓ (d,R).
(2.30)
Further deﬁne
Γ −
1 (R) := liminf
d→∞Γ −(d,R),
(2.31)
γ −
1 (R) := liminf
d→0 Γ −(d,R),
(2.32)
λ−
1 (R) := inf
d>0Γ −(d,R).
(2.33)
The main result in this section is as follows:
THEOREM 2.11. The set E ̸= ∅and there exists a smallest λ0 > 0 such that for λ < λ0 the
eigenvalue problem (2.27) has no nontrivial solutions. For every d > 0, there exists λ ∈E
and a positive solution u of (2.27) such that u(0) = d. Furthermore, Γ −(d,R) > 0 and
Γ −
1 (R),γ −
1 (R),λ−
1 (R) are all nonincreasing functions of R, and

There is a result dual to Theorem 2.11 for principal eigenvalues with associated nega-
tive solutions, the set of such eigenvalues may, of course, be different from the set whose
existence is asserted in Theorem 2.11.

We break the proof of Theorem 2.11 into several steps. First, a quick calculation shows
that ﬁnding positive solutions to problem (2.27) is equivalent to ﬁnding nontrivial solutions
to the problem


.
(2.35)
Then CR is a Banach space with the inherited norm ∥· ∥from C[0,R].

there exists a solution continuum C+

ϵ unbounded in [0,∞) × CR. In fact, this solution continuum C+

LEMMA 2.12. There exists ¯λ > 0 such that if (λ,u) solve (2.27), then λ ⩽¯λ.

Note that it follows from (2.39) and (2.28) that for all ϵ > 0, sufﬁciently small, λ is
bounded independent of ϵ. Thus, there exists ϵ0 such that for each d > 0 and each 0 < ϵ ⩽
ϵ0 there exists (λϵ,uϵ) ∈C+
ϵ , with ∥uϵ∥= d > 0 and 0 < λϵ ⩽¯λ. We may now let ϵ →0
and obtain a nontrivial solution of (2.27), with ∥u∥= d, for some λ∗∈(0, ¯λ].
Similar to (2.30) deﬁne
Γ +(d,R) = supΓ (d,R).
It follows from the above calculations that Γ +(d,R) < ∞. We now prove Γ −(d,R) > 0
from Theorem 2.11:

374
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
PROPOSITION 2.13. For each d > 0, Γ −(d,R) > 0.
PROOF. If not, then there exist sequences {un},{λn}, with ∥un∥= d and λn →0 such that
un = F(λn,un). The complete continuity of F implies {un} has a convergent subsequence,
with unj →u∗, and thus u∗= F(0,u∗). But it follows from (2.36) that F(0,u) = 0 for all
u, a contradiction.
□

Then, we have:

PROOF. That the numbers in the second column are ﬁnite has already been discussed. To
show that the numbers in the ﬁrst column are positive we argue as follows. Assume (λ,u)

∥u∥= d,

Since u is decreasing and φ and ψ are increasing we ﬁnd that for given ϵ > 0, there exists
R0 such that
S :u ∈C[0,R0]: ∥u −d∥⩽ϵ →u ∈C[0,R0]: ∥u −d∥⩽ϵ
and that S is completely continuous. The result thus follows from Schauder’s ﬁxed point
theorem. We next show that solutions of the initial value problem (2.47) exist globally and
are oscillatory:
PROPOSITION 2.17. For each d > 0 and each λ > 0 solutions of (2.47) exist globally on
[0,∞), have only simple zeros and are oscillatory, i.e., the set of zeros is unbounded.
PROOF. It follows from the above existence argument that a solution u of (2.47), as long
as it is positive, is decreasing. If u(r) ⩾0 for r ∈[0,∞), then using calculations as before,
we ﬁnd that for each r > 0
u(r) ⩾rφ−1

and hence (since we may assume r ⩾1)
φ(u(r))
ψ(u(r)) ⩾

which implies, using condition (2.28) that r cannot be unbounded. Therefore u must have
a ﬁrst zero. Easy arguments show that the zeros of u must be simple and that u is oscilla-
tory.
□
We next shall show that λ−
1 (R), γ −
1 (R) and Γ −
1 (R) are nonincreasing functions of R.
To this end we shall need the following elementary properties of the operator F deﬁned
by Equation (2.36). We note that the space CR is a partially ordered Banach space with

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
377
respect to the partial order ⩽deﬁned by u ⩽v whenever u(r) ⩽v(r) for all r ∈[0,R].
Further if [u,v] = {w ∈CR: u ⩽w ⩽v} is an order interval in CR, then it is a bounded
closed set in CR.
PROPOSITION 2.18. The operator F deﬁned by (2.36) is monotone with respect to the
above partial order in C[0,R] and hence in CR and also monotone with respect to λ.
From this proposition and the complete continuity of F immediately follows the follow-
ing ﬁxed point result:
PROPOSITION 2.19. Assume there exists [α,β] ⊂C[0,R] such that
F(λ,·):[α,β] →[α,β].
Then F(λ,·) has a ﬁxed point u ∈CR ∩[α,β].
We note that the hypotheses of Proposition 2.19 will hold, whenever we can ﬁnd a pair
{α,β} ⊂C[0,R] such that
α ⩽β
and
α ⩽F(λ,α),F(λ,β) ⩽β.
Using these facts we can now establish the following result:
THEOREM 2.20. λ−
1 , γ −
1 , Γ −
1 are nonincreasing functions of R.
PROOF. Assume there exist constants R1 and R2, with R1 < R2, such that λ−
1 (R1) <
λ−
1 (R2). Then there exists μ ∈(λ−
1 (R1),λ−
1 (R2)), such that (2.27) has a nontrivial solution
˜α for R = R1 and λ = μ. Furthermore, there exists ν ⩾λ−
1 (R2) and a nontrivial solution
β of (2.27) for R = R2 and λ = ν, with β(0) = d as large as desired. It follows from
Corollary 2.16 that for d sufﬁciently large β(r) > ˜α(r), for each r ∈[0,R1]. Deﬁne
α =
 ˜α,
0 ⩽r ⩽R1,
0,
R1 ⩽r ⩽R2.
Then the operator F(μ,·) for R = R2 satisﬁes in the space C[0,R2]
α ⩽F(μ,α),F(μ,β) ⩽β,
as may easily be veriﬁed. Thus by Proposition 2.19 this operator will have a ﬁxed point in
[α,β], contradicting that μ < λ−
1 (R2). The monotonicity of the other functions is proved
using virtually similar arguments.

REMARK 2.21.
1. Theorem 2.20 implies that problem (2.27) has no nontrivial solutions for λ < λ−
1 (R).
2. Solutions of (2.27) are a priori bounded for λ in compact subintervals of (−∞,
Γ −
1 (R)).
3. The calculations and results also imply that for δ > 0, sufﬁciently small, the degrees

are deﬁned for a < γ −
1 (R) and b > γ +
1 (R) and equal 1 and 0, respectively. Hence
it follows from global bifurcation theory that an unbounded continuum of positive
solutions of (2.27) will bifurcate from [γ −
1 (R),γ +
1 (R)].
We conclude this section with a few remarks concerning the nonhomogeneous equation

′ + λrN−1ψ(u) = rN−1h(r),
r ∈(0,R),
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.48)
where h ∈L∞(0,R) is a given function. In this case, one has the following theorem:
THEOREM 2.22. There exists λ0 > 0 such that for every λ < λ0 and every function h ∈
L∞(0,R) the nonhomogeneous problem (2.48) has a solution.
As is to be expected, λ0 in this theorem is to the left of the set of principal eigenvalues
associated with both positive and negative eigenfunctions.
PROOF. The existence of solutions to the nonhomogeneous problem is equivalent to the
existence of ﬁxed points of the operator T (λ,u,h) deﬁned by

which may be accomplished for a given h ∈L∞(0,R), by choosing d sufﬁciently large. In
a similar manner we may construct a negative α such that α ⩽T (λ,α,h). We now apply

2.2.5. Existence and nonexistence.
We next consider existence and nonexistence ques-
tions for the following class of problems:

rN−1φ(u′)
′ + rN−1g(u) = 0,
r ∈(0,R),
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.51)
where φ is an odd increasing homeomorphism of R and g :R →R is a nondecreasing
continuous function such that g(0) = 0.
Motivated by the case of the p-Laplace operator and related work (see, e.g., [29,48]),
we will assume that φ satisﬁes:
limsup
s→∞
φ(σs)
φ(s) < ∞,
for all σ > 1
(2.52)
and
limsup
s→0
φ(σs)
φ(s) < ∞,
for all σ > 1.
(2.53)

J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
Let
Φ(s) =
 s
0
φ(t)dt,
G(s) =
 s
0
g(t)dt,
and denote by
Γ := limsup
s→∞
Φ(s)
sφ(s),
and for θ ∈(0,1),
δθ := liminf
s→∞
G(θs)
sg(s) .
The main existence result is the following:
THEOREM 2.23. Suppose that Γ < 1 and
lim
s→0
φ(s)
g(s) = ∞,
lim
s→∞
g(s)
φ(s) = ∞.
(2.54)
Further let there exist θ ∈(0,1) such that δθ > 0 and
Nδθ > NΓ −1.
(2.55)
Then (2.51) has at least one positive solution.
Condition (2.55) has been used in [48] to indicate subcritical growth of g with respect
to φ. In the case of powers, i.e., when φ(s) = |s|p−2s and g(s) = |s|δ−1s, with 1 < p < N
and δ > 0, this condition reads
δ < N(p −1) + p
N −p
,
(2.56)
which is known to be optimal in the sense that there are no positive solutions to (2.51) if
δ ⩾N(p −1) + p
N −p
.
(2.57)
On the other hand, if we let φ(s) = ln(1 + |s|)|s|p−2s then one has a solution for p < δ ⩽
N(p−1)+p
N−p
. Thus if we allow slightly faster growth we can include equality in (2.56) [23].
In the case of general φ and g, the main nonexistence result is the following:
THEOREM 2.24. If
sup
s⩾0
NG(s)
sg(s) ⩽inf
s⩾0
NΦ(s)
sφ(s) −1,
(2.58)
then (2.51) does not have a positive solution.

381
Condition (2.55) is related to a condition that appears to have been ﬁrst used by Cas-
tro and Kurepa in [18,17] for the linear operator, i.e., when φ(s) = s. De Thélin and
El Hachimi [37] extended the results in [17] to the p-Laplacian case by assuming that
NG(s) −N−p
p sg(s) is bounded from below for all s ∈R and for some θ ∈(0,1),
NG(θd) −N −p
p
dg(d) ⩾0,
for d large.
(2.59)
We note here that although condition (2.59) seems to relax the conditions in [18], it can be
proved to be equivalent when p = 2 and g is increasing (see [47]).
PROOF OF THEOREM 2.23. By radial symmetry, ﬁnding positive solutions to prob-
lem (2.51) is equivalent to ﬁnding nontrivial solutions to the problem

r ∈(0,R),

(2.60)
Recall from (2.35) that CR is the closed subspace of C[0,R] deﬁned by those u that
vanish at R. Let u be a solution of (2.60). If T0 :CR →CR is deﬁned by
T0(u)(r) =

(2.61)
then T0 is well deﬁned and ﬁxed points of T0 will provide solutions of (2.60). Deﬁne now
the operator G :[0,R] × CR →CR, by

(2.62)
where h > 0 is a constant to be ﬁxed later. We ﬁnd that G sends bounded sets of [0,R]×CR
into bounded sets of CR and G(0,u) = T0(u). Moreover, G is a completely continuous
operator.
Also, let us deﬁne the operator S :[0,R] × CR →CR,
S(λ,u) =

(2.63)
Again, we see that S is completely continuous and note that S(1,·) = T0.
One proves the existence of a ﬁxed point of T0, and hence of a positive solution to (2.51),
by using suitable a priori estimates and degree theory. Indeed, one may show that there
exist R1 > 0 and ϵ0 > 0 such that
degLS


= 0

382
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
and
degLS

I −T0,B(0,ϵ0),0

= 1
and thus, using the excision property of the Leray–Schauder degree it will follow that there
must exist a solution of the equation
u = T0(u)
in B(0,R1) \ B(0,ϵ0).
To establish these facts, we need to prove that solutions (λ,u) ∈[0,R] × CR of the
equation
u = G(λ,u)
(2.64)
are a priori bounded. To do this one considers the auxiliary problem

and proves the following lemmas:
LEMMA 2.25. There exists h0 > 0 such that problem (2.65) has no solutions for h ⩾h0.
PROOF. We argue by contradiction and thus assume that there exists a sequence {hn}n∈N,
with hn →∞as n →∞such that (2.65) has a solution un. Then, un satisﬁes

Using now that R

or equivalently,
φ( 4

(2.67)
for all n ⩾n1 and for all r ∈[ R

It is clear that (2.67) cannot hold for A large if R ⩾4. If R < 4, by (2.66), condi-
tion (2.52), and the fact that A is arbitrary, we obtain a contradiction for n ⩾n0 for some
n0 ⩾n1.

The next lemma has a lengthy proof, see [47] for the details.

J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
LEMMA 2.26. Solutions to (2.68) are a priori bounded.
Let S be as deﬁned by (2.63). In order to complete the proof of the main result of this
section we need one more lemma.
LEMMA 2.27. There exists an ε0 > 0 such that the equation
u = S(λ,u)
(2.69)
has no solution (λ,u) with u ∈∂B(0,ε0) and λ ∈[0,1].
PROOF. We argue by contradiction and thus we assume that there are sequences {un} and
{λn} with ∥un∥= εn →0 as n →∞and λn ∈[0,1] such that (λn,un) satisﬁes (2.69) for
each n ∈N. We have that (λn,un) satisﬁes

where μ is a positive arbitrarily small number. Thus

(2.70)
If R ⩽1, we immediately reach a contradiction. If now R > 1, let us set ˜εn = εn/R. Then
φ(R˜εn)
φ(˜εn) ⩾N
μR ,
and we reach a contradiction by condition (2.53) and the fact that μ is arbitrary.
□
It now follows from Lemmas 2.25 and 2.26, that if u is a solution to the equation
u = G(λ,u),
λ ∈[0,1],
then ∥u∥⩽C, where C is a positive constant. Thus if B(0,R1) is the ball centered at 0 in
CR with radius R1 > C, then we have that the Leray–Schauder degree of the operator
I −G(λ,·):B(0,R1) →CR

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
385
is well deﬁned for every λ ∈[0,1]. Then, by the properties of the Leray–Schauder degree,
we have that
degLS

I −T0,B(0,R1),0

= degLS

I −G(1,·),B(0,R1),0

= 0,
(2.71)
since (2.64) does not have solutions on {1} × B(0,R1). Also, by Lemma 2.27 and the
properties of the Leray–Schauder degree, it follows that for ε0 > 0 small enough,
degLS

I −S(λ,·),B(0,ε0),0

is constant for all λ ∈[0,1].
Hence
degLS

I −T0,B(0,ε0),0

= degLS

I,B(0,ε0),0

= 1.
(2.72)
Thus, using the excision property of the Leray–Schauder degree we conclude from (2.71)
and (2.72) that there must be a solution of the equation
u = T0(u)
with u ∈B(0,R1)\B(0,ε0). This ﬁxed point corresponds to a nontrivial solution to (2.51),
thus completing the proof of Theorem 2.23.
□
We conclude this section with a proof of the nonexistence result (Theorem 2.24) and
some applications:

is nonincreasing for r ∈[0,R]. However, E(0) = 0 and E(R) = Φ∗(φ(u′(R)) > 0, which
is a contradiction.
□
The following two examples will serve to illustrate the above existence and nonexistence
results. Consider the boundary value problem

√
1+|∇u|2p
 + uq = 0,
x ∈BR(0),
u = 0,
x ∈∂BR(0),

for R > 0. In this case the function φ is given by
φ(s) =
|s|2p−2s

1 + |s|2p
and one obtains nonexistence (see (2.58)) whenever
q ⩾N(2p −1) + 2p
N −2p
and existence whenever
p −1 < q < N(p −1) + p

(see Theorem 2.23).

2.3. The case when f (0) < 0
We now consider (2.1), i.e.,

rN−1φ(u′)
′ + λrN−1f (u) = 0,
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.74)
and allow for f (0) < 0. In this case the problem has no trivial solution, hence bifurcation
results (relative to a trivial branch of solutions) will not apply and other methods must be
used.
We make the following assumptions:
(A.1) φ is an odd, increasing homeomorphism on R, and for each σ > 0 there exists a
positive number Mσ > 0 such that
φ(σs) ⩽Mσ φ(s)
(2.75)
for every s ∈R.
(A.2) f :R+ →R is continuous, nondecreasing on [B,∞) for some B > 0, and
lim
s→∞
f (s)
φ(s) = ∞.
(2.76)

(2.77)
where, as usual, F(s) =

 s
0 φ(t)dt.
The main result in this section is:
THEOREM 2.28. Let (A.1)–(A.3) hold and assume that φ−1 is concave on R+. Then there
exists a positive number ¯λ such that for 0 < λ < ¯λ, Equation (2.74) has a positive, decreas-
ing solution uλ with
lim
λ→0uλ(r) = ∞
(2.78)
uniformly for r in compact subsets of (0,R).
REMARK 2.29.
1. Condition (A.3) was employed in [47] to establish the existence of positive solutions
to (2.74) when f (0) = 0.
2. In the case when φ(s) = |s|p−2s, (A.3) becomes

In particular, if f (s) = sq, (2.76) and (2.77) require that
p −1 < q <

max(N −p,0) −1.
3. In the case when φ(s) = s and N ⩾2, the existence part of Theorem 2.28 was estab-
lished in [19] under the assumptions that f is nondecreasing on R and

is nondecreasing.
After several technical computations one proceeds to establish properties for the associ-
ated operator equations which are deﬁned as follows. For each v ∈C[0,R], and μ ⩾0, let
u = Aμv be the solution of

rN−1φ(u′)
′ = −λrN−1
f (v) + μ

,
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0.
(2.81)
Then Aμ :C[0,R] →C[0,R] is a completely continuous operator and its ﬁxed points u
such that u ⩾w on [0,R] will yield solutions of (2.81) and hence of (2.74). To establish
the existence of such ﬁxed points we shall list some auxiliary result, whose proofs may be
found in [53].
LEMMA 2.30. For each λ > 0, small enough, there exists a positive number Rλ with
limλ→0 Rλ = ∞such that all solutions of
u = θA0u,
0 ⩽θ ⩽1,
(2.82)
satisfy ∥u∦= Rλ.
LEMMA 2.31. There exists a positive number μ0 (depending on λ) such that: If Aμ has a
ﬁxed point, then μ ⩽μ0.
LEMMA 2.32. There exists a function H :R+ →R with limd→∞H(d) = ∞such that all
solutions u of u = Aμ(u) satisfy
u(r) ⩾H

∥u∥

(1 −r),
r ∈[0,1].
(2.83)
LEMMA 2.33. For each ν > 0, there exists a positive number Cν such that all solutions u
of
u = Aμ(u)
(2.84)
with λ ⩾ν satisfy ∥u∥< Cν.

PROOF OF THEOREM 2.28. Using the above lemmas we obtain
degLS

I −A0,B(0,Cλ),0

= degLS

I −Aμ,B(0,Cλ),0

= 0,
(2.85)
where Cλ is given by Lemma 2.33. On the other hand, Lemma 2.30 implies that
degLS

I −A0,B(0,Rλ),0

= 1.
(2.86)
Hence it follows from the excision property of the Leray–Schauder degree that there
exists a solution uλ such that
Rλ ⩽∥uλ∥⩽Cλ.
Since Rλ →∞, as λ →0, it follows from Lemma 2.32 that uλ ⩾0, for λ small. The
remainder of the proof is straightforward.
□
2.4. The case when f (0) > 0
In this section we again consider (2.74):

rN−1φ(u′)
′ + λrN−1f (u) = 0,
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(2.87)
and allow for f (0) > 0. We continue to assume the conditions (A.1)–(A.3) imposed in the
previous section hold. The main theorem follows:
THEOREM 2.34. Let (A.1)–(A.3) hold and suppose that f (s) > 0 for s ⩾0. Then there
exists a positive number λ∗such that (2.74) has at least two solutions for λ < λ∗, at least
one for λ = λ∗, and none for λ > λ∗.
Since we are interested in positive solutions, we deﬁne f (s) = f (0) if s ⩽0. Before
proving Theorem 2.34 we outline several lemmas:
LEMMA 2.35. There exists a positive number ˜λ such that (2.74) has no solution for λ > ˜λ.
PROOF. Let u be a solution of (2.74) and r ∈(0,R). We have
u(r) ⩾φ−1

¯f (u(r)) ⩾λrN

follows that
u(r) ⩾φ−1

N

(R −r).
(2.91)
Combining the above, we reach a contradiction if λ is sufﬁciently large, since
lims→∞φ(s)
¯f (s) = 0.
□
LEMMA 2.36. For each μ > 0, there exists a positive constant Cμ such that all solutions
u of (2.74) with λ > μ satisfy ∥u∥< Cμ.
LEMMA 2.37. If Λ = {λ > 0: (2.74) has a solution} and λ∗= supΛ, then 0 < λ∗< ∞
and λ∗∈Λ.
PROOF. Using the Leray–Schauder continuation theorem, it follows that there is a solution
for λ small, and so λ∗> 0. Also, λ∗< ∞. We verify that λ∗∈Λ. Let {λn} ⊂Λ be such
that λn →λ∗, and let {un} be the corresponding solutions of (2.74) with λ = λn. From
Lemma 2.36, we deduce that {un} is bounded in C1[0,R]. Hence {un} has a subsequence
which converges to u ∈C[0,R]. By a standard limiting process, it follows that u is a
solution for (2.74) with λ = λ∗.
□
LEMMA 2.38. Let 0 < λ < λ∗and let uλ∗be a solution of (2.74). Then there exists a
positive number ε such that uλ∗+ ε is an upper solution of (2.74).
For v ∈C[0,R], let Aλv = u where u satisﬁes

and let ˜Aλ be the operator analogous to Aλ deﬁned by ˜f .
LEMMA 2.39. Let u be a solution of u = ˜Aλu. Then 0 ⩽u ⩽uλ∗+ ε.

rN−1φ(u′)′ = −λrN−1f (u),
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0.
(2.94)
By the maximum principle, u ⩾0. We claim that u ⩽uλ∗+ ε. Suppose that there exists
¯r ∈(0,R) such that u(¯r) > uλ∗(¯r) + ε. Then there exists numbers r0 and r1 with 0 ⩽r0 <
r1 < R such that u′(r0) = u′
λ∗(r0), u(r1) = uλ∗(r1) + ε, and u > uλ∗+ ε on (r0,r1).
Hence

rN−1φ(u′)
′ = −λrN−1f (uλ∗+ ε),
for r ∈(r0,r1].
(2.95)
Since

rN−1φ(u′
λ∗)
′ ⩽−λrN−1f (uλ∗+ ε),
(2.96)
we deduce that

rN−1
φ(u′) −φ(u′
λ∗)
′ ⩾0,
for r ∈(r0,r1],
(2.97)
and so u −(uλ∗+ ε) is nondecreasing on (r0,r1].
Consequently,
u(r) < uλ∗(r) + ε,
r ∈(r0,r1],
(2.98)
a contradiction.
□
We now summarize a proof of the main theorem:
PROOF OF THEOREM 2.34. Let 0 < λ < λ∗. Since 0 is a lower solution and uλ∗is an
upper solution (see [31,66]), there exists a solution uλ with 0 ⩽uλ ⩽uλ∗. We next establish
the existence of a second solution. Deﬁne
B =

u ∈C[0,R]: −ε ⩽u ⩽uλ∗+ ε

.
(2.99)
Then B is open and uλ ∈B. Since ˜Aλ is bounded for λ in compact intervals,
degLS

I −˜Aλ,B(uλ,M),0

= 1
(2.100)
if M is sufﬁciently large. Here B(uλ,M) denotes the open ball center at uλwith radius M
in C[0,R].
If there exists u ∈∂B such that u = ˜Aλu then u is a second solution. Suppose that
u ̸= ˜Aλu for u ∈∂B. Then degLS(I −˜Aλ,B,0) is well deﬁned and since ˜Aλ has no ﬁxed
point in B(uλ,M) \ B, we have
degLS(I −Aλ,B,0) = deg(I −˜Aλ,B,0) = 1.
(2.101)

392
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
On the other hand, it follows that
degLS

I −Aλ,B(0,M),0

= 0
(2.102)
for some large number M. Hence
degLS

I −Aλ,B(0,M) \ B,0

= −1,
(2.103)
and the existence of a second solution follows.
□
3. Problems on annular domains
We now consider boundary value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations of
the form

φ(u′)
′ + N−1
r
φ(u′) + f (u) = 0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
(3.1)
where R1 > 0. The parameter λ plays no role in the considerations to follow, thus it is
suppressed in Equation (3.1). We again assume φ :R →R is an odd increasing homeo-
morphism such that for all c > 0, there exists Ac > 0, such that
Acφ(s) ⩽φ(cs),
for s ∈R+,
(3.2)
and
lim
c→∞Ac = ∞.
(3.3)
This assumption implies that there exists Bc > 0 such that
φ(cs) ⩽Bcφ(s),
for s ∈R+,
and
lim
c→0Bc = 0.
Since the only property of the function N−1
r
we shall use here is its continuity, we will
consider the more general problem
φ(u′)′ + b(r)φ(u′) + f (u) = 0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
(3.4)

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
393
where b :[R1,R2] →R is a continuous function. The nonlinear term f will be assumed to
be continuous and satisfy
limsup
s→0
f (s)
φ(s) ⩽0
(3.5)
and to grow superlinearly (with respect to φ) near inﬁnity, i.e.,
lim
s→∞
f (s)
φ(s) = ∞.
(3.6)
For such problems we shall establish that (3.4) always has a positive solution deﬁned for
any interval [R1,R2]. The results discussed are motivated by problems studied in [30,51,
62,73]. We remark that the results given are equally valid in case f depends upon r also,
provided the assumptions made are assumed uniform with respect to r.
3.1. Fixed point formulation
Using the integrating factor
p(r) = e
 r
R1 b(s)ds,
we may rewrite problem (3.4) equivalently as

pφ(u′)
′ + pf (u) = 0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0.
(3.7)
The existence of solutions of (3.7) (hence (3.4)) is established by proving the existence
of ﬁxed points of a completely continuous operator F :E →E, where E = C[R1,R2],
endowed with the norm ∥u∥= maxr∈[R1,R2] |u(r)|. The operator F is deﬁned by the fol-
lowing lemma:
LEMMA 3.1. Let φ be as above and let c be a given nonnegative constant. Then for each
v ∈E the problem

pφ(u′)
′ −cpφ(u) = pv,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
(3.8)
has a unique solution u = T (v), and the operator T :E →E is completely continuous.
PROOF. For each w ∈E let u = B(w) be the unique solution of
pφ(u′)′ −cpφ(w) = pv,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,

q −

where q is the unique number such that u(R2) = 0. The existence of a ﬁxed point u of B,
hence a solution u to Equation (3.8), follows from the continuation theorem of Leray–
Schauder. One may then deﬁne the operator T by
T (v) = u,
where u is the solution of (3.8).
To accomplish this, assume u ∈E and λ ∈(0,1) such that
u = λB(u).
Then
pφ u′
λ
′ −cpφ(u) = pv,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0.
Multiplying the above by u and integrating we obtain

On the other hand, since φ is an increasing homeomorphism, for each ϵ > 0, there exists a
constant cϵ such that
|s| ⩽ϵφ(s)s + cϵ,
for s ∈R.
Thus we obtain

and hence
∥u′∥⩽c7,
where c1,...,c7 are constants independent of λ. The complete continuity of B is easily
established and we conclude from these a priori bounds that B has a ﬁxed point u = T (v).
If u1 and u2 are ﬁxed points, one immediately obtains that

(u1 −u2)dr = 0,
and hence, since φ is increasing, that u1 = u2. Thus the operator T given in the statement
of the lemma is well deﬁned.
□
Using Lemma 3.1 we obtain a ﬁxed point formulation of problem (3.7) as
u = F(u) = T −cφ(u) −f (u).
(3.9)
The next lemma is crucial for establishing the existence of nonzero ﬁxed points of (3.9),
its proof may be found in [74].
LEMMA 3.2. If u is the solution of (3.8) with v ⩽0, then
u(r) ⩾c0∥u∥k(r),
R1 ⩽r ⩽R2,

396
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
where
k(r) =

R2 −R1
min{r −R1,R2 −r},
and c0 is a positive constant.
3.2. Existence results
We next establish the existence of a nontrivial solution of (3.7) by means of a ﬁxed point
argument, similar to those used above, (see [65,51]). We need the following auxiliary re-
sults.
PROPOSITION 3.3. Assume that f :R →R is continuous and there exists a constant c > 0
such that
f (s) + cφ(s) ⩾0,
s ⩾0.
Further assume there exists a constant m > 0 such that
u = T λ−cφ|u| −f |u|,
0 ⩽λ ⩽1,
⇒
∥u∦= m,
and there exists a constant M > m and an element h ∈E, h ⩽0 such that
u = T

−cφ(u) −f

|u|

+ λh

,
0 ⩽λ ⩽1,
⇒
∥u∦= M,
further any solution u of
u = T

−cφ(u) −f

|u|

+ h

,
satisﬁes ∥u∥> M. Then there exists a ﬁxed point u ∈E of the operator F, F(u) =
T (−cφ(|u|) −f (|u|)) such that
m < ∥u∥< M.
Applying this proposition to the boundary value problem (3.7), we have the following
corollary.
COROLLARY 3.4. Assume that f :R →R is continuous and there exists a constant c > 0
such that
f (u) + cφ(u) ⩾0,
u ⩾0.

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
397
Further assume there exists a constant m > 0 such that for 0 ⩽λ ⩽1 and any solution u
of

cpφ

|u|

R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = (R2) = 0,
(3.10)
satisﬁes
∥u∦= m,
and there exists a constant M > m and an element h ∈E, h ⩾0 such that any solution u
of
pφ(u′)′ −pφ(u) + pφ|u| + pf |u| ⩽0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
(3.11)
satisﬁes ∥u∦= M, and solutions u of
pφ(u′)′ −pφ(u) + pφ|u| + pf |u| + ph = 0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
(3.12)
satisfy ∥u∥> M. Then there exists a solution u, u ⩾0 of (3.9) (hence (3.7)) such that
m < ∥u∥< M.
We next impose conditions on f and further conditions on φ in order that the above
corollary may be applied. These are conditions about the behavior of the functions near
zero and near inﬁnity. These conditions in turn will provide the validity of Corollary 3.4
and hence yield the existence of nontrivial solutions.
PROPOSITION 3.5. Assume that f :R →R is continuous and let there exist a constant
c ⩾0 such that
f (u) + cφ(u) ⩾0,
u ⩾0.
Further, let φ be an odd increasing homeomorphism of R which satisﬁes (3.2) and as-
sume (3.5) holds. Then there exists a positive number m such that for 0 ⩽λ ⩽1 and any
solution u of


R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
satisﬁes ∥u∦= m.

J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
PROOF. First note that solutions are nonnegative. Following an indirect argument, assume
the existence of sequences {λn} ⊂[0,1], {ϵn}, ϵn ↘0, {un}, ∥un∥= ϵn, such that the triple
(ϵn,λn,un) is a solution. Since each un ̸= 0 has a maximum point, say un(r∗
n) = ∥un∥, we
obtain by integration
u′
n(r) ⩽φ−1

Integrating once more and using the fact that the integrand is positive and that φ−1 is
monotone, we obtain

⩽c1ϵφ(ϵn).
Therefore, if R2 −R1 ⩽1 we obtain a contradiction for ϵ small, on the other hand if
R2 −R1 > 1, then we obtain a contradiction via (3.3).
□
The following proposition from [74] cites conditions that guarantee the validity of the
second part of Corollary 3.4:
PROPOSITION 3.6. Assume that f :R →R is continuous and let there exist a constant
c ⩾0 such that
f (u) + cφ(u) ⩾0,
u ⩾0.
Further, let φ be an odd increasing homeomorphism of R that satisﬁes (3.2) and (3.6).
Then there exists a positive number M such that any solution u of


⩽0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0
satisﬁes ∥u∦= M.

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
399
In order to apply Corollary 3.4 to Equation (3.4), we need one further result from [74]:
PROPOSITION 3.7. Assume the hypotheses of Proposition 3.6 and let M be a constant
whose existence is guaranteed there. Then there exists h ∈E,h ⩾0 such that ∥u∥> M for
any solution of

pφ(u′)
′ −cpφ(u) + cpφ

|u|

+ pf

|u|

+ ph = 0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0.
Combining the above propositions and using Corollary 3.4 we have the following theo-
rem.
THEOREM 3.8. Assume that f :R →R is continuous. Further, let φ be an odd increasing
homeomorphism of R which satisﬁes (3.2), and let the following conditions hold:
−∞< liminf
u→0
f (u)
φ(u) ⩽limsup
u→0
f (u)
φ(u) ⩽0,
lim
u→∞
f (u)
φ(u) = ∞.
Then the boundary value problem (3.4) has a positive solution.
Note that the existence of a constant c ⩾0 such that
f (u) + cφ(u) ⩾0,
u ⩾0
follows from the assumptions of the theorem.
If f :R →R is nonnegative, then the following theorem applies.
THEOREM 3.9. Assume that f :R →R is continuous and nonnegative. Further, let φ
be an odd increasing homeomorphism of R such that φ(u)
u
is nondecreasing on R+ and
satisﬁes (3.2); also let the following conditions hold:
liminf
s→0
F(s)
Φ(s) = 0,
lim
s→∞
f (s)
φ(s) = ∞.
Then the boundary value problem (3.4) has a positive solution.
We note that in the case φ(s) = |s|p−2s the conditions above hold if and only if p ⩾2.

3.3. Positone problems
In this section we are interested in the existence and multiplicities of positive solutions of
the boundary value problem

φ(u′)
′ + λf (r,u) = 0,
R1 < r < R2,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0,
(3.13)
with f :[R1,R2]×[0,∞) →(0,∞) continuous. As usual, we assume φ is an odd increas-
ing homeomorphism on R such that
limsup
x→∞
φ(σx)
φ(x) < ∞,
for all σ > 0.
(3.14)
Concerning f we also assume there exists [c,d] ⊂(R1,R2), c < d, such that
lim
s→∞
f (r,s)
φ(s) = ∞,
uniformly for r ∈[c,d].
(3.15)
The main result in this section is:
THEOREM 3.10. Let (3.14) and (3.15) hold. Then there exists a positive number λ∗such
that the problem (3.13) has at least two positive solutions for 0 < λ < λ∗, at least one for
λ = λ∗and none for λ > λ∗.
Note that in the special case where φ(u′) = u′, Theorem 3.10 is classical (see, e.g.,
[30,100]). Related results for the case φ(u′) = |u′|p−2u′ can be found in [33,62], and the
references in these papers.

We remark here that the above formulation includes the study of positive radial solutions
of equations like
div|∇u|p−2∇u + λg|x|,u = 0,

and thus, higher-dimensional problems, as well (see [31]).
To prove Theorem 3.10, one employs, in addition to continuation methods, also upper
and lower solution methods. These methods are, of course, standard for semilinear equa-
tions (see [99,39]) and we refer to [12,31,66], where similar types of theorems for the
nonlinear case are presented.
Since we are interested in nonnegative solutions we shall make the convention that
f (r,u) = f (r,0) if u < 0. To prove Theorem 3.10 we ﬁrst need a lemma which is a special
case of Lemma 3.2:
LEMMA 3.11. Let v ∈C[R1,R2] with v ⩽0 and let u satisfy

φ(u′)
′ = v,
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0.
Then
u(t) ⩾∥u∥p(t),
t ∈[R1,R2],
where
p(t) = min(t −R1,R2 −t)
R2 −R1
.
The next sequence of lemmas allows the use of continuation methods:
LEMMA 3.12. Suppose that g :[R1,R2] × R+ →R+ is continuous and there exists a
positive number M and an interval [a1,b1] ⊂(R1,R2) such that
g(r,s) ⩾M(φ(s) + 1),
r ∈[a1,a2], s ⩾0.

402
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
Then there exists a positive number M0 = M0(φ,a1,b1) such that the problem
φ(u′)′ = −g(r,u),
u(R1) = 0 = u(R2)
has no solution whenever M ⩾M0.

It follows from the above proof, that the problem in Lemma 3.12 has no solution u
satisfying
gt,u(t) ⩾Mφu(t) + 1,
t ∈[a1,a2],
if M ⩾M0.
These considerations further imply the following result:
THEOREM 3.13. There exists a positive number ¯λ such that problem (3.13) has no solution
for λ > ¯λ.
It follows immediately from (3.15) that there exists a constant μ > 0 such that
f (r,s) ⩾μ(φ(s) + 1),
s ∈R+, c ⩽r ⩽d.
Hence the result follows from the previous lemma. We also need the following lemma.
LEMMA 3.14. For each μ > 0, there exists a positive constant Cμ such that the problem

φ(u)

u(R1) = u(R2) = 0
with λ ⩾μ, θ ∈[0,1] and M0 given by Lemma 3.12, has no solution satisfying ∥u∥> Cμ.
Now, let Λ be the set of all λ > 0 such that (3.13) has a solution and let λ∗= supΛ.
LEMMA 3.15. 0 < λ∗< ∞and λ∗∈Λ.

404
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
PROOF. A function u ∈C[R1,R2] is a solution if and only if u = F(λ,u), where
F :[0,∞) × C[R1,R2] →C[R1,R2]
is the completely continuous mapping given by
u = F(λ,v),
with u the solution of

φ(u′)
′ = −λf (r,v),
u(R1) = u(R2) = 0.
We note that F(0,v) = 0, v ∈C[R1,R2]. Hence it follows from the continuation theorem
of Leray–Schauder that there exists a solution continuum C ⊂[0,∞) × C[R1,R2] of solu-
tions of (3.13) which is unbounded in [0,∞) × C[R1,R2], and thus, (3.13) has a solution
for λ > 0 sufﬁciently small, and hence λ∗> 0. By Theorem 3.13, λ∗< ∞. We verify that
λ∗∈Λ. Let {λn} ⊂Λ be such that λn →λ∗and let {un} be the corresponding solutions.
We easily see that {un} is bounded in C1[R1,R2] and hence {un} has a subsequence con-
verging to u ∈C[R1,R2]. By standard limiting procedures, it follows that u is a solution
of (3.13).
□
LEMMA 3.16. Let 0 < λ < λ∗and let uλ∗be a solution of (3.13). Then there exists ϵ0 > 0
such that uλ∗+ ϵ, 0 ⩽ϵ ⩽ϵ0, is an upper solution of (3.13).
Theorem 3.10 now follows from these lemmas:
PROOF OF THEOREM 3.10. Let 0 < λ < λ∗. Since 0 is a lower solution and uλ∗is an
upper solution, there exists a minimum solution uλ of (3.13) with 0 ⩽uλ ⩽uλ∗. We next
establish the existence of a second solution.
The mapping
λ 
→uλ,
0 ⩽λ ⩽λ∗,
where uλ is the minimal solution of (3.13), is a continuous mapping [0,λ∗] →C[R1,R2].
Hence

(λ,uλ): 0 ⩽λ ⩽λ∗
⊂C,
where C is the continuum in the proof of Lemma 3.15. Using separation results on closed
sets in compact metric spaces (i.e., Whyburn’s lemma [1]), one may use the arguments
used in the above proof to verify that for each λ ∈(0,λ∗) there are at least two solutions
on the continuum C.

We will discuss consequences of these existence theorems for Gelfand type problems in
the next section.

4. The Liouville–Gelfand equation — A case study
4.1. Introduction
The classical Liouville–Gelfand problem is concerned with positive solutions of the equa-
tion
u + λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(4.1)
for λ > 0. Equation (4.1) arises in many settings, including the study of combustible gas
dynamics [11,49,40], astrophysics [20,38], and prescribed curvature problems [8,63,5].
Let us brieﬂy outline the connection with chemical kinetics. Systems such as
(ci)t = kici + fi(c1,...,cm,T ),
Tt = kT + f (c1,...,cm,T ),
(4.2)
arise in the theory of chemical reaction kinetics, where the ci represent various chemi-
cal concentrations with diffusion coefﬁcients ki, T is the temperature, and fi represent
various nonlinear reactions. This model does not include other important effects such as
convection. Assuming a constant concentration c0 over a short time interval and that the
temperature does not exceed a base temperature T0 the equation for T in (4.2) can be
reduced to (see, e.g., [52,11,40,96])
ut = k0u + ˆλeu/(1−ϵu),
(4.3)
for an appropriately nondimensionalized temperature u. Here
ˆλ = a0q0c0
T 2
0
e−a0/T0,
where a0 is the activation energy of the substance, q0 is the latent heat of the reaction, and
ϵ = T0/a0. Of particular interest is the existence of steady state solutions to (4.3):
u + λeu/(1−ϵu) = 0,
(4.4)
where λ = ˆλ/k0. Equation (4.4) is known as the Arrhenius equation. In the limit of
inﬁnitely large activation energy (for a ﬁxed temperature T0) one obtains the Frank-
Kamenetskii approximation
u + λeu = 0,
(4.5)
which is also known as the Liouville–Gelfand equation. Of particular importance in this
setting is the existence of values of λ for which a solution to (4.5) or (4.4) will exist. It
is perhaps not surprising that for large λ (4.5) has no solution (corresponding to blow-up
in the parabolic problem). On the other hand, the structure of the solution set to (4.5) for
small λ is quite surprising. In the next two sections we discuss this structure as well as its
extension to the quasilinear case.

4.2. Solution set for the semilinear case
In this section we consider the radial version of the Liouville–Gelfand equation (4.1) with
Dirichlet boundary conditions:

u′′ + N−1
r
u′ + λeu = 0,
r ∈(0,1),
u′(0) = u(1) = 0.
(4.6)
To build intuition let us consider carefully the case N = 1:
u′′ + λeu = 0,
r ∈(0,1),
u′(0) = u(1) = 0.
(4.7)
Multiplying by u′ and integrating one ﬁnds
u′(r) = −

From this equation we can determine for each α if there exists a value of λ for which the

λ =

(4.10)
For each α, Equation (4.10) clearly deﬁnes a value of λ for which (4.6) has a solution. It
is somewhat surprising though that the right-hand side of Equation (4.10) is nonmonotone.
Indeed, Figure 4 shows that there exists a unique λ for which (4.6) has exactly one solution
and for each smaller λ, Equation (4.6) has precisely two solutions. In terms of the physical
setting, it can be shown that for a given λ the solution with larger α value is unstable [11].
The case N = 2 can be solved by the change of variables r = e−t and v(t) = u(r) −2t
to obtain v′′ + λev = 0, thus u(r) = α −2 ln(1 + λ/8eαr2). In this case
λ = 8eα/2 −e−2α.
A plot of this relation is qualitatively exactly like Figure 4, now with a maximum at λ = 2.
Thus for both N = 1 and N = 2 the solution set to Equation (4.6) has the same structure,

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations

there exists a λ∗such that (1.2) has a unique solution for λ = λ∗and exactly two solutions
for each λ ∈(0,λ∗).
Analytic solutions of (4.6) in the physically important case of N = 3 are unknown.
Based on the results for N = 1 and N = 2, one might expect a similar solution structure.
Historically, Emden [38], Frank-Kamenetskii [40], and Chandrasekhar [20] each numeri-
cally integrated (4.6), with Frank-Kamenetskii ﬁnding the maximal λ∗≈3.32. However,
in [49], Gelfand showed that the structure of the solution set for N = 3 is quite different.
The key difference is that for N = 3, the differential equation in (4.6) has a singular solu-
tion Φ(r) = −2 lnr, corresponding to λ = 2, which also satisﬁes the boundary condition
u(1) = 0. Further, as r ranges from 1 to 0, Φ(r) ranges from 0 to ∞. One can use this
structure to transform (4.6) to a state-space where time is represented by Φ(r). With this
motivation, consider the change of variables
⎧
⎨
⎩
s = −lnr,
0 < r ⩽1,
v = du
ds ,
w = λe−2seu.
(4.11)
Under this transformation, a solution pair (λ,uλ(r)) to (4.6) is equivalent to a trajectory
{(w(s),v(s))} in the phase plane of the system
 dw
ds = w(v −2),
dv
ds = v −w,

Fig. 5. Heteroclinic orbit for (4.12). The line corresponds to a value of λ for which (4.6) has three solutions.
w(∞) = 0,
(4.15)
v(∞) = 0.
(4.16)
An elementary analysis of the system (4.12) shows that there are two equilibrium points
(0,0) and (2,2), the latter corresponding to the singular solution Φ(r). Furthermore there
is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the spiral node (2,2) to the origin. Thus each intersection
of this orbit with a vertical line w = λ > 0 corresponds to a solution pair {(λ,uλ)} of (4.6)
(see Figure 5).
Thus, in contrast to the case N = 1,2, for N = 3, given any m ∈N, there exists values
of λ such that (4.6) has exactly m solutions. Moreover, for λ = 2 it has inﬁnitely many
solutions. In the context of Emden and Chandrasekhar’s isothermal gas stars, it implies the
existence of inﬁnitely many equilibrium positions.
Joseph and Lundgren observed that the change of variables above determines the struc-
ture of the solution set to (4.6) for all N. In particular, for N > 2, the transformation (4.11)
produces the equivalent system
 dw
ds = w(v −2),
dv
ds = (N −2)v −w,
(4.17)
with conditions (4.13)–(4.16). For 2 < N < 10 the equilibrium point (2(N −2),2) is a
spiral node, thus for this range of N Equation (4.6) has a solution set similar to that of
N = 3. For N ⩾10 the critical point becomes a repelling node, which implies that (4.6)
has a unique solution for each λ ∈(0,2(N −2)). Thus we have demonstrated the following
theorem:

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
409
THEOREM 4.1. Consider Equation (4.6). The following existence results hold:
• Case I: 1 ⩽N ⩽2. There exists λ∗> 0 such that (4.6) has exactly one solution for
λ = λ∗and exactly two solutions for each λ ∈(0,λ∗).
• Case II: 2 < N < 10. Equation (4.6) has an unbounded continuum of solutions which
oscillates around the line λ = 2(N −2), with the amplitude of oscillations tending to
zero, as u(0) = ∥u∥→∞.
• Case III: N ⩾10. Equation (4.6) has a unique solution for each λ ∈(0,2(N −2))
and no solutions for λ ⩾2(N −2). Moreover, ∥u∥→∞as λ →2(N −2).
Finer analysis of the radial solutions to (1.2) may be found in [11,78,82,79]. For results
on the Liouville–Gelfand problem on annuli, star-shaped, and more general domains see
[11,80,81,107,26,42].
4.3. Solution set for the quasilinear case
In this section we discuss extensions of the Liouville–Gelfand problem. The ﬁrst work in
this direction is due to García Azorero and Peral Alonso [44] for the nonlinear diffusive
extension:
pu + λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(4.18)
for a bounded domain Ω. Using variational methods they prove the following theorem
extending the case p = 2 (see, e.g., [26,42]):
THEOREM 4.2. For each p > 1 there exists a constant λp such that Equation (4.18) has,
for λ ∈(0,λp), at least one solution for p < N and at least two solutions for p ⩾N.
Additional progress for general domains can be found in [6,104].
Studies of (4.18) in the radial case for p ̸= 2 ﬁrst appeared in [6] (1 < p < N) and [22]
(p = N). In particular the paper [6] found a “transition” from inﬁnitely many solutions
(p < N < p2 + 3p/(p −1)) to unique solutions (N ⩾p2 + 3p/(p −1)) that extends the
Joseph–Lundgren theory. Moreover, in [22] for p = N they ﬁnd the existence of a λ∗> 0
such that the radial case of (4.18) has exactly one solution for λ = λ∗and exactly two
solutions for λ ∈(0,λ∗), again extending the Joseph–Lundgren theory.
In [57], the author considers a Monge–Ampère version of the Liouville–Gelfand equa-
tion deﬁned by

detD2u + λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(4.19)
on a strictly convex bounded domain Ω. Curiously, unlike the Joseph–Lundgren theory, in
the Monge–Ampère case it was shown that there exists a λ∗such that (4.19) has at least
two solutions for each λ ∈(0,λ∗), independent of the value of N.

where Sk(D2u) is the k-Hessian operator discussed in the introduction. The ﬁrst result
for (4.20) (k > 1) in the radial case was due to Clément et al. [22] where they considered
the case k = n in R2n. They found that in this case (4.20) has the same twofold multiplicity
of solutions as in the case k = 1, N = 2. This motivated the work [58] which determined
the precise multiplicity of (4.20) in the radial case. Using the transformation (4.11) with
s = −k ln r one ﬁnds the equivalent system:

An analysis of the system (4.21) determines the exact multiplicity of solutions to (4.20).
Note that we recover the system (4.12) when k = 1.

THEOREM 4.3. Consider Equation (4.22) with the inequalities (4.23), (4.24), and (4.25)

5. Rellich–Pohozaev identities
In this section we discuss both a nonexistence and a uniqueness result for radial solutions
of semilinear elliptic equations deﬁned on N-dimensional balls. These results are based on
a well-known theorem due to Pohozaev [89] (see also [77,100]).
The Rellich–Pohozaev identity (cf. [8]) is an important identity (which since has been
extended considerably) which has proved useful in establishing that certain nonlinear
boundary value problems on starlike domains1 do not have solutions. The identity is con-
cerned with smooth solutions of problems, like
u + f (x,u) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(5.1)
where Ω is a starlike domain, which in our case will be assumed to be a ball. Since most
of the results are easier to write for partial differential equations, we shall write our equa-
tions as partial differential equations, bearing in mind that in the cases of interest positive
solutions will be radial solutions and hence solutions of associated ordinary differential
equations.
We let
F(x,u) =
 u
0
f (x,s)ds
and obtain the following identity

x · |∇u|2ν dS = 2N

(5.2)
We have the following immediate consequence:
1Ω is star-shaped if there exists x0 ∈Ω such that (x −x0) · ν ⩾0 for all x ∈∂Ω.

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
413
THEOREM 5.1. Assume that f is independent of x, and Ω is a starlike domain and
2NF(u) −(N −2)uf (u) ⩽0,
u ⩾0.
Then (5.1) has no positive solution.
A consequence of this theorem when f (u) = |u|p−1u, p ⩾1, is the following result:
COROLLARY 5.2. Assume that
N + 2
N −2 ⩽p,
then the problem

rN−1u′′ + rN−1f (u) = 0,
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(5.3)
has no positive solutions.
Reﬁnements of the original Pohozaev argument for proving the above identity (see [77,
100]) also give uniqueness results for positive solutions of problems like the above con-
taining a parameter. Namely we have the following:
THEOREM 5.3. Assume that N ⩾3, that
f (u) > 0,
f ′(u) > 0,
u ⩾0
and there exists α > 0, such that
sup
u⩾α
 2N

 F(u)

(5.4)
Then

rN−1u′′ + λrN−1f (u) = 0,
0 < r < R,
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(5.5)
has a unique positive solution for λ ⩾0 small.
In particular, we can apply the above result for the case that f (u) = eu and obtain that
for small values of λ the solution found earlier is the unique positive solution. Note that
the earlier results also tell us that the condition that N ⩾3 is needed.

Serrin is due to the following proposition:
PROPOSITION 5.4. Let u ∈C2(Ω) be a solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation (5.7),
and let a and ⃗h be, respectively, scalar and vector valued functions of class C1(Ω). Then

where repeated indices i and j are to be summed from 1 to N.
The proof is obtained by direct computation, using (5.7).

The choice of a(x) = (N −2)/2 makes the |Du|2 term vanish and reduces (5.11) to the
Pohozaev identity (5.2). However, identity (5.10) is applicable to a much larger class of
equations. For instance, for the quasilinear equation

x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,

In this case the fundamental identity (simpliﬁed for our purposes) takes the form (see
Equation (29) in [91])

This identity can be used to determine the critical exponent associated to the operator Sk
[109]. For simplicity we assume F = F(z) (e.g., f (u) = |u|p).
THEOREM 5.6. Let Ω be a smooth domain which is star-shaped with respect to the origin.
Assume f :(−∞,0] →[0,∞) is smooth, with f (s) > 0 for s < 0 and f (0) = 0. Then

Sk(D2u) = f (u),

(5.22)
For u < 0 the operator Sk is elliptic [109], thus Sij (D2u)νiνj > 0. Hence the left-hand side
of (5.22) is nonpositive and the result follows.
□
Note that when k = 1, (5.20) is equivalent to the Pohozaev criterion (5.2). If f (u) =
(−u)p then (5.20) reduces to
N −2k
k + 1 >
N
p + 1.
(5.23)
If k ⩾N/2, then (5.23) cannot hold and we obtain no a priori obstructions to solution from
this method. On the other hand, when k < N/2, then (5.23) is true when p ⩾(N+2)k
N−2k . Thus
when k < N/2 the critical exponent γ (k) for Sk is deﬁned by
γ (k) = (N + 2)k
N −2k .
(5.24)
Complementary existence results for radially symmetric solutions for subcritical expo-
nents (and for all exponents when k ⩾N/2) are proved in [109], thus one can extend γ (k)
to all k via
γ (k) =
∞,
k > N/2,
(N+2)k
N−2k ,
k < N/2.
(5.25)
In particular, there is no critical exponent for the Monge–Ampère operator. Heuristically,
operators “closer” to the Laplace operator have critical exponents, while operators “closer”
to Monge–Ampère do not. Note that when p = k one has an eigenvalue problem (see, e.g.,
[70,110,57]).

5.2. Critical dimensions
In 1983 Brezis and Nirenberg [16] observed that lower order perturbations to elliptic
equations involving critical exponents recover the lost compactness. More precisely, they
proved the equation

u + u
N+2
N−2 + λu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(5.26)
has a positive solution if 0 < λ < λ1 and N ⩾4, where λ1 is the principal eigenvalue for
− on H 1
0 (Ω). Surprisingly, for the case N = 3 they observed that there exists λ∗> 0
such that (5.26) has a solution for λ ∈(λ∗,λ1) and no solution for λ ∈(0,λ∗). If Ω is a
ball, then λ∗= λ1/4. In this context the dimension N = 3 is called a critical dimension.
Since both p and Sk have critical exponents (when p < N and k < N/2, respectively),
it is natural to ask if results similar to the Brezis–Nirenberg result exist for these operators.
Several authors have answered this question afﬁrmatively. Rather than treat p and Sk
separately, Clément et al. [22] consider the equation
⎧
⎨
⎩
rα|u′|βu′′ = rγ |u|q−2u,
r ∈(0,R),
u > 0,
r ∈(0,R),
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(5.27)
and the perturbed form
⎧
⎨
⎩

rα|u′|βu′′ = rγ |u|q−2u + λrδ|u|βu,
r ∈(0,R),
u > 0,
r ∈(0,R),
u′(0) = u(R) = 0,
(5.28)
for various values of exponents α,β,δ and γ . See the table in Section 4.1 for the relevant
values of constants for (5.15) or (5.12).
The critical exponent associated with (5.27) is
q∗= (γ + 1)(β + 2)
α −β −1
.
(5.29)
For the p-Laplacian, q∗=
Np
N−p and for Sk, q∗= N(k+1)
N−2k .
Concerning the parameters involved, we assume the following inequalities hold:
q −1 > β + 1 > 0,
γ + 1 > α −β −1,
(5.30)
α −β −1 > 0,
δ + 1 ⩾α −β −1,
(5.31)
γ,δ > α −1,
(5.32)
α −β −2 < δ.
(5.33)

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
419
When applied to Sk (respectively p) these inequalities imply q > k + 1 (respectively
q > p) and k < N/2 (respectively N < p), i.e., one is in the realm of critical exponents.
The main theorems concerning (5.28) is as follows:
THEOREM 5.7. Assume (5.30), (5.31), (5.32), (5.33) hold. If λ ⩽0 and q = q∗, then (5.28)
has no solution.
THEOREM 5.8. Assume (5.30), (5.31), (5.32), (5.33), β ⩾0 and q = q∗. If
(β + 1)(δ + 1) −(α −β −1)(β + 2) > 0,
(5.34)
then there exists λ∗> 0 such that (5.28) has no solution for λ ∈(0,λ∗).
In the case of the operators Sk and p, their parameters satisfying (5.34) correspond to
certain values of the dimension N, called critical dimensions by Pucci and Serrin [92]. For
the p-Laplace operator, (5.34) corresponds to N < p2, thus the critical dimensions for p
are those n with p < N < p2. Note that for the Laplacian p = 2 and we obtain 2 < N < 4,
thus the only critical dimension is N = 3, as observed by Brezis and Nirenberg. For the
k-Hessian the critical dimensions are those N with 2k < N < 2k(k + 1).
The proofs are based on the following identity of Pohozaev–Pucci–Serrin type [22]:
PROPOSITION 5.9. Let a,b ∈C1[0,∞). If u ∈C2(0,∞) ∩C1[0,∞) solves

6. Problems linear at inﬁnity
In Section 2 we discussed several bifurcation results for boundary value problems which
had a trivial solution. The bifurcation was detected by writing the problems as an equivalent
operator equation which was of the form
u −F(λ,u) = 0,

420
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
where
F :R × E →E
is a completely continuous operator and E is the Banach space of continuous functions on
[0,R]. For the problems to follow such an equivalence will also be the case, except that F
will satisfy the following conditions: There exist a < b such solutions of
u −F(a,u) = 0 = u −F(b,u)
are a priori bounded and
degLS

id −F(a,·),B(0,r),0

̸= degLS

id −F(b,·),B(0,r),0

,
where the latter condition is to hold for all r, sufﬁciently large. Under these assumptions
we obtain the following bifurcation from inﬁnity result (see, e.g., [93,101]):
PROPOSITION 6.1. There exists a continuum C of solutions of u −F(λ,u) = 0 which
bifurcates from inﬁnity in (a,b).
The above means that the continuum C has the property that there exists a sequence
{(λn,un)} ⊂C, such that {λn} ⊂(a,b) and ∥un∥→∞.
Here we rely mainly on the work [97,98,85–87]. Consider the boundary value problem
⎧
⎨
⎩
u + λf (u) + h(x) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
u > 0,
x ∈Ω,
(6.1)
where f satisﬁes
f (s) = s + g(s),
g(s) = o

|s|

, as |s| →∞.
(6.2)
Problem (6.1) is equivalent to an operator equation
u −λF(u) −T (h) = 0
(6.3)
in R × E where E is the Banach space C[0,R] with the usual norm, and both F :E →E
and T :E →E are completely continuous.
Using the fact that λ1, the principal eigenvalue of − on the Sobolev space H 1
0 (BR), is
simple and the above Proposition 6.1, we obtain the following corollary.
COROLLARY 6.2. There exist continua C± of solutions of (6.1) bifurcating from inﬁnity
at λ1.
It is these continua which we shall next describe for several cases of bounded nonlinear
terms g.

6.1. Landesman–Lazer results
Regarding the function g, we now introduce the following quantities:
γ1 = limsup
t→∞
g(t),
γ2 = liminf
t→−∞g(t),
γ3 = limsup
t→−∞
g(t),
γ4 = liminf
t→∞g(t),
and we have the following results.
THEOREM 6.3. Assume that
γ1 < 0 < γ2.
Then there exists a neighborhood I of λ1, such that problem (6.1) has
• at least one solution for λ ∈I, λ ⩾λ1,
• at least three solutions for λ ∈I, λ < λ1.
THEOREM 6.4. Assume that
γ3 < 0 < γ4.
Then there exists a neighborhood I of λ1, such that problem (6.1) has
Fig. 7. Illustration of Theorem 6.3. A similar reﬂected picture holds for Theorem 6.4.

422
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
• at least one solution for λ ∈I, λ ⩽λ1,
• at least three solutions for λ ∈I, λ > λ1.
These results are proved using the existence of the continua above and analyzing their
location with respect to the hyperplane λ = λ1. This may be accomplished by considering
the asymptotic behavior of integrals of the form

BR
g(tφ + w)φ dx,
with φ a principal eigenfunction of − and w suitably chosen in the orthogonal comple-
ment of φ. We refer to [75,76,100].
6.2. Nonlinear terms which oscillate
We next discuss some multiplicity results from [97,98] regarding the continua which bi-
furcate from inﬁnity for nonlinear terms g which are bounded and oscillatory. Letting φ
denote a positive eigenfunction of − corresponding to λ1, we assume that

Ω
hφ dx = 0.
Let (λ,u) ∈C+ be a solution of (6.1), then we obtain

Letting μ = ∥u∥(λ1 −λ), the following results on the asymptotics of the solution

with R(α) →0 as α →∞.
Concerning the constants c(BR) and d(BR) one has the following relationship
d(BR) ⩾c(BR)2λ(N−1)/2

.
(6.4)
This relationship will be important in the result below, where interesting phenomena
arise which are different for different dimension. Concerning the nonlinear term g, we
shall assume that
g(t + T ) = g(t),
 T
0
g dt = 0
and
g = g′
1 = g′′
2 = ···,
 T

gi dt = 0.
We have the following theorem:
THEOREM 6.7. Let {(u,λ)} be the solution continuum of (6.1) described above. The fol-
lowing hold:

424
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
Fig. 8. Possible continua of Theorem 6.7. The the dashed line is possible when N > 4.

∥u∥

c(BR) + g2(0)d(BR)


∥u∥−2
∥u∥2,
as ∥u∥→∞. Hence inﬁnitely many positive solutions exist, whenever
min
s∈[0,T ]g2(s) < −d(BR)
c(BR) g2(0) < max
s∈[0,T ]g2(s).
• For N > 4
∥u∥2(λ −λ1) = g2(0)d(Ω) + o

∥u∥−2
∥u∥2
as ∥u∥→∞.
We thus conclude that C+ may lie on one side of the hyperplane λ = λ1, if N > 4 and the
nonlinear term g satisﬁes appropriate conditions. The above results are all valid in case the
ball BR is replaced by a convex set Ω with smooth boundary having the property that the
eigenfunction φ (corresponding to λ1) has a single critical point (for details see [98,100]).
7. Symmetry breaking
Our motivation for discussing ordinary differential equations of the form considered earlier
has been that they may be considered as equations whose solutions are radial solutions of
certain problems for partial differential equations which admit radial solutions because of
certain intrinsic symmetries in the equation and the underlying domain. Now, it may be the

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
425
case that all solutions of the problem at hand must be radial solutions (e.g., if the conditions
of the Gidas–Ni–Nirenberg results [50] hold), or it may be case that nonradial solutions
bifurcate from radial solutions as parameters are varied (see, e.g., [60,82,105]). It may
also happen that nonradial solutions exist because minima of certain energy functionals
over a function space of radial functions (which deﬁne radial solutions of equations at
hand) strictly exceed minima of the same functional considered over a larger space (of not
necessarily radial functions) and hence deﬁne other solutions of the problem at hand. It is
this situation which we shall brieﬂy discuss here.
Variational methods, of course, play an important role in the study of problems of the
type that have been considered here and such methods have been used to prove the exis-
tence of nonradial solutions of Gelfand type problems on annular domains ([44]). Note that
by the results in [50] nonradial solutions cannot exist for such problems if the domain is a
ball, and hence the existence of nonradial solutions is due to the geometry of the domain.
Let us consider the boundary value problem

u′′ + N−1
r
u′ + λf (u) = 0,
r ∈(a,b),
u(a) = u(b) = 0
(7.1)
solutions of which are radial solutions of
u + λf (u) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,
(7.2)
where
Ω =

x ∈RN: 0 < a < |x| = r < b

.
By changing scale, we may assume that b = 1, and changing scale further, we also may
assume that λ = 1 and a is a parameter and we consider
u + f (u) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω.
(7.3)
For various classes of nonlinearities f , we established in Section 3 that these problems
have positive solutions.
In case f (u) = up, p < N+2
N−2, N ⩾3, it was proved in [16] that (7.3) has nonradial
positive solutions for any a, and if f (u) = −u + up, p > 1, N = 2, a similar result was
established in [24], where it was also shown that the number of positive nonradial solu-
tions increases without bound as a →1. These results have been extended by Lin [67,68]
who established several bifurcation results (which will be summarized below) motivated
by the results cited above. There is also the seminal work of Nagasaki and Suzuki [80,82]
concerning nonradial solutions of the Gelfand equation on annuli in R2, and higher dimen-
sions, which we shall also summarize.

426
J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
Let us characterize the various nonlinear terms considered and then state the pertinent
results. It will always be assumed thatf is a smooth function and f (u) > 0 for u > 0.
Furthermore f may belong to one of the following classes of functions:
N
N −2f (u) ⩾f ′(u)u ⩾(1 + δ)f (u),
u > 0, N ⩾3,
(7.4)
where δ is a positive constant;
f (u) = up,

(7.6)
For such nonlinearities the following theorem holds:
THEOREM 7.1. If f (u) = o(u), u →0, then under any of the above conditions positive
nonradial solutions of (7.3) exist.
Consider the Gelfand problem
u + λeu = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u = 0,
x ∈∂Ω,

with
Ω = x ∈R2: 0 < a < |x| = r < 1.

branches.
the following result was established in [80]:
THEOREM 7.2. For any positive integer m, there exists a number μm > 0 such that for any
μ > μm problem (7.7) has a nonradial solution (λ,u) with u of mode m and M(u) = μ.
This suggests that the solution continua of positive radial solutions of (7.7) whose exis-
tence was established in Section 3 undergo secondary bifurcations. However, the proof of
the above result uses variational methods and the continua were established using continu-
ation methods based on degree theory. Thus the above suggestion about secondary bifurca-
tions is a suggestion only. On the other hand, in their paper [82] Nagasaki and Suzuki have
used a somewhat different method, based on Morse theory and topological degree theory
to study symmetry breaking off radial solutions of (7.7) in case N ⩾2 and they conclude
that the solution continuum of radial solutions C of the Gelfand problem (7.7) undergoes
inﬁnitely many symmetry breaking bifurcations (into nonradial solutions) as λ →0+ and
∥u∥→∞. A similar approach has been used in [106] for semilinear equations involving
power nonlinearities.
8. Whole space problems
In this ﬁnal section we shall consider problems of the type
−u + u −|u|p−1u = 0,
x ∈RN, p > 1,
(8.1)
and more general equations of the form
−u + V (x)u −

|u|2
u = λ|u|p−1u,
x ∈RN,
(8.2)

J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
where λ is a parameter. Again, we will be interested in radial solutions, i.e., solutions u
which only depend upon r = |x|. Such solutions, of course, will, as before be solutions of
corresponding ordinary differential equations. As in the case when the domain is a ball,
positive solutions of (8.1) may be radial solutions by results similar to the results in [50].
In fact very similar results have been obtained, see, e.g., [27,28,102].
We shall call positive solutions of either of the equations ground states and we shall
discuss results which guarantee the existence of ground states. The approach used in both
cases is variational and we shall rely on results in [83,111] for Equation (8.1) and recent
results from [90] for Equation (8.2). The latter equation is a fully nonlinear equation and
has many interesting applications in mathematical physics. Some references to such appli-
cations may be found in [90].
The important Sobolev space for both problems is the space W 1,2(RN) with the sub-
space
H 1

RN = u ∈W 1,2RN: u is radial.
A result of Strauss (see [111]) guarantees that the embedding

on the space H 1

The compact embedding result plays an important role in establishing the so-called
Palais–Smale condition, a condition which is used in verifying the mountain pass theo-
rem. An alternate approach to such problems is the use of Lagrange multiplier techniques
in which case the fact that the level sets


are weakly closed (which follows from the compact embedding result) plays a role. These
approaches establish the existence of critical points of the deﬁning functionals (or critical
points subject to a constraint) which provide weak solutions of the differential equation.
Some classical arguments then show that the weak solutions are actually smooth. Using

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations
429
the well-known mountain pass theorem of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz the following result
has been established (see, e.g., [111]).
THEOREM 8.1. Assume 1 < p < N+2
N−2, then Equation (8.1) has a positive radial solution
u ∈H 1
r (RN). This solution belongs to class C2(RN) and is a solution of the boundary
value problem

u′′ + N−1
r
u′ −u + |u|p−1u = 0,
r ∈(0,∞),
u′(0) = u(∞) = 0.
(8.7)
As already mentioned, this problem (for the case N = 3) was already studied by Nehari
[83] using a variational approach. For Nehari’s case the problem becomes

u′′ + 2
r u′ −u + |u|p−1u = 0,
r ∈(0,∞),
u′(0) = u(∞) = 0,
(8.8)
with 1 < p < 5. Letting v = ru, one ﬁnds that v is a solution of the equation
v′′ −v + r1−pvp = 0.
(8.9)
The following example of Nehari [83] shows that for p = 5 no such solutions can exist
(thus a result similar to the nonexistence result of Pohozaev [89] holds for problems deﬁned
in all of space, as well). For, if one assumes that such a solution exists, then v solves
v′′ −v + r−4v5 = 0,

The above example is but one of the many results available for the existence of positive
radial ground states for equations of the form
divA|∇u|∇u + f (u) = 0,
x ∈RN.
For additional results we refer to the papers [84,88,102] and their references.
We now turn to the problem (8.2), then under various assumptions on the potential V
one may establish results similar to the above using a variational approach (critical point
theory). The assumptions imposed on V ∈L1
loc(RN) and the number p belong to the fol-
lowing class:
(A) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that
V (x) ⩾δ,
a.e.
(B) V ∈L∞(RN), and V is periodic in each coordinate; p ⩾3.
(C) V ∈L∞(RN), V (x) →∥V ∥L∞, |x| →∞; p ⩾3.
(D) V (x) →∞, |x| →∞; p > 1.
The following results have been established (see [90]).
THEOREM 8.2. Assume that N = 1 and that condition (A) and condition (B), (C), or (D)
hold. Then for any α > 0 there exists λα > 0 such that
−u′′ + V (x)u −

u2′′u = λα|u|p−1u,
has a positive solution u ∈W 1,2(R). The function α 
→λα is unbounded and lower semi-
continuous. If it is the case that p ⩾3, then
lim
α→∞λα = 0,
lim
α→0+ λα = ∞.
In this case, furthermore, for each λ > 0, there exists an inﬁnite sequence of positive solu-
tions {un} ⊂W 1,2(R) of
−u′′ + V (x)u −

u2′′u = λ|u|p−1u,
with
J(un) →∞,
where J is given by (8.5).
For higher dimensions the following existence results are valid.
THEOREM 8.3. Let N ⩾2 and 1 < p < N+2
N−2. Then there exists a sequence {λn}, λn →∞,
such that (8.2) admits for any λ = λn a nontrivial nonnegativeradial solution u ∈H 1
r (RN).

Radial solutions of quasilinear elliptic differential equations

In case 3 ⩽p < N+2
N−2, i.e., N = 2 or N = 3, there exists a corresponding sequence {λn},
satisfying λn →0, as well.
If N = 3 and 3 ⩽p < 5 and λ > 0, then (8.2) has a nontrivial nonnegative solution
u ∈H 1
r (R3).

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
439
Nonlinear ordinary differential equations appear in many branches of applied mathematics,
physics and, in general, in applied sciences. For a differential system or a vector ﬁeld
deﬁned on the plane R2 or C2 the existence of a ﬁrst integral determines completely its
phase portrait; of course, working with real or complex time, respectively. Since for such
vector ﬁelds the notion of integrability is based on the existence of a ﬁrst integral the
following natural question arises:
Given a vector ﬁeld on R2 or C2, how to recognize if this vector ﬁeld has a ﬁrst
integral?
The more easiest planar vector ﬁelds having a ﬁrst integral are the Hamiltonian ones. The
integrable planar vector ﬁelds which are not-Hamiltonian are, in general, very difﬁcult to
detect. Many different methods have been used for studying the existence of ﬁrst integrals
for non-Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds based on: Noether symmetries [13], the Darbouxian the-
ory of integrability [38], the Lie symmetries [83], the Painlevé analysis [7], the use of Lax
pairs [62], the direct method [51] and [55], the linear compatibility analysis method [97],
the Carlemann embedding procedure [14] and [2], the quasimonomial formalism [7], etc.
In this chapter we study the existence of ﬁrst integrals for planar polynomial vector
ﬁelds through the Darbouxian theory of integrability. The algebraic theory of integrability
is a classical one, which is related with the ﬁrst part of the Hilbert’s 16th problem [56].
This kind of integrability is usually called Darbouxian integrability, and it provides a link
between the integrability of polynomial vector ﬁelds and the number of invariant algebraic
curves that they have (see [38,86]).
Darboux [38] showed how can be constructed the ﬁrst integrals of planar polynomial
vector ﬁelds possessing sufﬁcient invariant algebraic curves. In particular, he proved that if
a planar polynomial vector ﬁeld of degree m has at least [m(m + 1)/2] invariant algebraic
curves, then it has a ﬁrst integral, which can be computed using these invariant algebraic
curves. Jouanolou [58] (see also [95] and [31] for an easy proof) shows that if the number
of invariant algebraic curves of a planar polynomial vector ﬁeld of degree m is at least
[m(m + 1)/2] + 2, then the vector ﬁeld has a rational ﬁrst integral, and consequently all its
solutions are invariant algebraic curves. For more details and results on Darbouxian theory
of integration for planar polynomial vector ﬁelds, see [9,26,28,30,85,87,91–93].
Prelle and Singer [87] using methods of differential algebra, showed that if a polynomial
vector ﬁeld has an elementary ﬁrst integral, then it can be computed using the Darbouxian
theory of integrability. Singer [95] proved that if a polynomial vector ﬁeld has Liouvillian
ﬁrst integrals, then it has integrating factors given by Darbouxian functions. Some related
results can be found in [20].
1. Basic notions
In this section ﬁrst we present the planar polynomial differential systems that we shall
study. Secondly, we introduce the notion of ﬁrst integral; and ﬁnally, we deal with the
deﬁnition of integrating factor.

1.1. Polynomial systems
By deﬁnition a planar polynomial differential system or simply a polynomial system is a
differential system of the form
dx
dt = ˙x = P(x,y),
dy
dt = ˙y = Q(x,y),
(1)
or equivalently
dy
dx = Q(x,y)
P(x,y),
where P and Q are polynomials in the variables x and y. Moreover, the dependent vari-
ables x and y, the independent variable t, and the coefﬁcients of the polynomials P and
Q are either all complex, or all real. In the former case the system is called a complex
polynomial system and in the later a real polynomial system.
The independent variable t will be called the time of system (1).
If we have a real polynomial system (1) we will work with it as a complex one, indepen-
dently if we want to study its real integrability, because as we will see later on, often the
real integrability of a real polynomial system is forced by its complex structure.
In this chapter the degree m of the polynomial system (1) will be the maximum of the
degrees of the polynomials P and Q.
Associated to polynomial system (1) there is either the polynomial vector ﬁeld
X = P(x,y) ∂
∂x + Q(x,y) ∂
∂y ,
(2)
or the polynomial 1-form
ω = P(x,y)dy −Q(x,y)dx.
The existence of solutions for the polynomial system (1), or equivalently for the polyno-
mial vector ﬁeld X or for the 1-form ω is given by the Existence and Uniqueness theorem
of solutions for an ordinary differential system.
If the polynomial system (1) is real, then a solution of it is an analytic function
ϕ :U →R2 (U is the maximal time open interval in which the solution is deﬁned) such
that dϕ(t)/dt = X(ϕ(t)), for every t ∈U.
If the polynomial system (1) is complex, then a solution of it is an analytic or holomor-
phic function ϕ :U →C2 (U is the maximal time simple connected open subset of C in
which the solution is deﬁned) such that dϕ(t)/dt = X(ϕ(t)), for every t ∈U.
In what follows we denote by F either R, or C, according with system (1) be real or
complex, respectively.
Let ϕ :U →F2 be a solution of system (1). Then, the set {ϕ(t) ∈F2: t ∈U} is called a
trajectory, an integral curve or an orbit of system (1) or of the vector ﬁeld X .

Integrability of polynomial differential systems

1.2. First integrals and invariants
The vector ﬁeld X or equivalently the system (1) is integrable on an open subset U of F2
if there exists a nonconstant analytic function H :U →F, called a ﬁrst integral of the
system on U, which is constant on all solution curves (x(t),y(t)) of X contained in U; i.e.,
H(x(t),y(t)) = constant for all values of t for which the solution (x(t),y(t)) is deﬁned
and contained in U. Clearly H is a ﬁrst integral of X on U if and only if
XH = 0,
or
ω ∧dH = 0,
on U.
For system (1) deﬁned on the plane R2 or C2 the existence of a ﬁrst integral determines
completely its phase portrait; i.e., the decomposition of the plane as union of the orbits
of (1).
EXAMPLE 1.1. The polynomial system
˙x = x(ax + c),
˙y = y(2ax + by + c),
(3)
has the ﬁrst integral
H = (ax + c)(ax + by)
x(ax + by + c) .
And the system
˙x = −y −b

x2 + y2
,
˙y = x,
(4)
has the ﬁrst integral
H = exp(2by)

x2 + y2
.
(5)
Of course, once we have a ﬁrst integral any analytic function of this ﬁrst integral is
another ﬁrst integral.
Let U ⊂F2 be an open set. We say that an analytic function H(x,y,t):U × F →F, is
an invariant of the polynomial vector ﬁeld X on U, if H(x,y,t) = constant for all values
of t for which the solution (x(t),y(t)) is deﬁned and contained in U. If an invariant H is
independent on t then, of course, it is a ﬁrst integral.
The knowledge provided by an invariant is weaker than the one provide by a ﬁrst inte-
gral. The invariant, in general, only gives information about either the α- or the ω-limit set
of the orbits of the system.
EXAMPLE 1.2. If aB −bA = 0 and bC −Bc ̸= 0, then the polynomial system
˙x = x(ax + by + c),
˙y = y(Ax + By + C),
(6)

442
J. Llibre
has the invariant
H = xB/(bC−Bc)y−b/(bC−Bc)et.
System (6) is the well-known Lotka–Volterra system, see [72,100].
1.3. Integrating factors
The simple fact of associating to system (1) the 1-form ω allows to obtain for the exact
systems a ﬁrst integral. Indeed, system (1) is called exact if it satisﬁes
∂P
∂x = −∂Q
∂y .
For these systems the 1-form ω is closed; i.e., dω = 0. Therefore, the function
H(x,y) =
 (x,y)
(x0,y0)
ω,
obtained integrating ω through any path starting at the point (x0,y0) and ending at the point
(x,y) is well deﬁned, because ω is closed and F2 is simply connected. Then, ω = dH .
Hence, ω ∧dH = 0, and consequently H is a ﬁrst integral for system (1).
The exact systems provides us a way to obtain ﬁrst integrals for a given system (1) which
initially is not exact, through the notion of integrating factor.
Let U be an open subset of F2, and R :U →F be an analytic function which is not
identically zero on U. The function R is an integrating factor of the vector ﬁeld X , or of
the 1-form ω, or of the system (1) on U if one of the following four equivalent conditions
holds
∂(RP)
∂x
= −∂(RQ)
∂y
,
div(RP,RQ) = 0,
XR = −R div(X),
d(Rω) = d(RP dy −RQdx) = 0,
(7)
on U. As usual the divergence of the vector ﬁeld X is deﬁned by
div(X) = div(P,Q) = ∂P
∂x + ∂Q
∂y .
The ﬁrst integral H associated to the integrating factor R is given by
H(x,y) = −

R(x,y)P(x,y)dy + h(x),

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
443
satisfying ∂H/∂x = −RQ. Then
˙x = RP = −∂H
∂y ,
˙y = RQ = ∂H
∂x .
(8)
In order that this function H to be single-valued the open set U must be simply connected,
if not it can be multi-valued.
Conversely, given a ﬁrst integral H of the vector ﬁeld X we always can ﬁnd an integrat-
ing factor R for which (8) holds.
EXAMPLE 1.3. It is easy to check that system (4) has the integrating factor R =
2 exp(2by), and that using it we get the ﬁrst integral (5), and vice versa.
EXAMPLE 1.4. Linear differential equations. We consider the polynomial differential
equation
dy
dx = a(x)y + b(x),
with a and b polynomials in x. Its associated 1-form is
ω = dy −a(x)y + b(x)dx.
If R = R(x) is an integrating factor it must satisfy
d(Rω) =
∂R
∂x + Ra(x)

dx ∧dy = 0.
Therefore, we get the integrating factor
R(x) = exp

−

a(x)dx

.
Later on we shall use the following result.
PROPOSITION 1.5. If a vector ﬁeld X has two integrating factors R1 and R2 on the open
subset U of F2, then in the open set U \ {R2 = 0} the function R1/R2 is a ﬁrst integral.
PROOF. Since Ri is an integrating factor, it satisﬁes that XRi = −Ri div(X) for i = 1,2.
Therefore, the proposition follows immediately from the next computation:
X
R1
R2

= (XR1)R2 −R1(XR2)

1.4. Invariant algebraic curves
Let f ∈C[x,y]; i.e., f is a polynomial with complex coefﬁcients in the variables x and y.
The complex algebraic curve f (x,y) = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve of the real vector
ﬁeld X if for some polynomial K ∈C[x,y] we have
Xf = P ∂f
∂x + Q∂f
∂y = Kf.
(9)
The polynomial K is called the cofactor of the invariant algebraic curve f = 0. We note
that since the polynomial system has degree m, then any cofactor has at most degree m−1.
We remark that in the deﬁnition of invariant algebraic curve f = 0 we always allow
this curve to be complex; that is f ∈C[x,y]. As we will see this is due to the fact that
sometimes for real vector ﬁelds the existence of a real ﬁrst integral can be forced by the
existence of complex invariant algebraic curves. Of course, when we look for a complex
invariant algebraic curve of a real vector ﬁeld we are thinking in the real vector ﬁeld as a
complex one.
Since on the points of the algebraic curve f = 0 the gradient (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y) of the
curve is orthogonal to the vector ﬁeld X = (P,Q) (see (9)), the vector ﬁeld X is tangent
to the curve f = 0. Hence, the curve f = 0 is formed by trajectories of the vector ﬁeld X .
This justiﬁes the name of invariant algebraic curve given to the algebraic curve f = 0
satisfying (9) for some polynomial K, because it is invariant under the ﬂow deﬁned by X .
EXAMPLE 1.6. It is easy to check that system (3) has the following ﬁve invariant algebraic
curves, in this case straight lines: f1 = x = 0, f2 = ax +c = 0, f3 = y = 0, f4 = ax +by =
0, and f5 = ax +by +c = 0, having cofactors K1 = ax +c, K2 = ax, K3 = 2ax +by +c,
K4 = ax + by + c and K5 = ax + by, respectively. In fact, all integral curves of system (3)
are algebraic because, with the exception of f1 = 0 and f5 = 0, they can be written as
(ax + c)(ax + by) −hx(ax + by + c) = 0 being h a constant.
EXAMPLE 1.7. System (4) has only the two invariant algebraic curves x + yi = 0 and
x −yi = 0, or equivalently the invariant algebraic curve x2 +y2 = 0, see Proposition 1.10.
This is easy to proof using its ﬁrst integral H = exp(2by)(x2 + y2).
PROPOSITION 1.8. For a real polynomial system (1), f = 0 is an invariant algebraic
curve with cofactor K if and only if ¯f = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with cofactor 
K.
Here conjugation denotes conjugation of the coefﬁcients of the polynomials only.
PROOF. We assume that f = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with cofactor K of the real
polynomial system (1.9). Then equality (9) holds. Since P and Q are real polynomials
conjugating equality (9) we obtain that
P ∂¯f
∂x + Q∂¯f
∂y = 
K ¯f .

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
445
Consequently, ¯f = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with cofactor 
K of system (1). The
proof in the converse direction is similar.
□
LEMMA 1.9. Let f,g ∈C[x,y]. We assume that f and g are relatively prime in the ring
C[x,y]. Then, for a polynomial system (1), fg = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with co-
factor Kfg if and only if f = 0 and g = 0 are invariant algebraic curves with cofactors Kf
and Kg respectively. Moreover, Kfg = Kf + Kg.
PROOF. It is clear that
X(fg) = (Xf )g + f (Xg).
(10)
We assume that fg = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with cofactor Kfg of system (1).
Then, X(fg) = Kfgfg and from equality (10) we get Kfgfg = (Xf )g + f Xg. There-
fore, since f and g are relatively prime, we obtain that f divides Xf , and g divides Xg.
If we denote by Kf = Xf/f and by Kg = Xg/g, then f = 0 and g = 0 are invariant al-
gebraic curves of system (1) with cofactors Kf and Kg respectively, and Kfg = Kf + Kg.
The proof in the converse direction follows in a similar way using again (10).
□
PROPOSITION 1.10. We suppose that f ∈C[x,y] and let f = f n1
1 ···f nr
r
be its factor-
ization in irreducible factors over C[x,y]. Then, for a polynomial system (1), f = 0 is an
invariant algebraic curve with cofactor Kf if and only if fi = 0 is an invariant algebraic
curve for each i = 1,...,r with cofactor Kfi . Moreover Kf = n1Kf1 + ··· + nrKfr .
PROOF. From Lemma 1.9, we have that f = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with cofac-
tor Kf if and only if f ni
i
= 0 is an invariant algebraic curve for each i = 1,...,r with
cofactor Kf ni
i , furthermore Kf = Kf n1
1
+ ··· + Kf nr
r .
Now for proving the proposition it is sufﬁcient to show, for each i = 1,...,r, that
f ni
i

i
if and only if fi = 0 is an in-
variant algebraic curve with cofactor Kfi, and that Kf ni
i

is an invariant algebraic curve with cofactor Kf ni
i . Then

or equivalently

So deﬁning Kfi = Kf ni
i /ni. We obtain that fi = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve with
cofactor Kfi such that Kf ni
i
= niKfi . The proof in the converse direction follows in a
similar way.
□

446
J. Llibre
An irreducible invariant algebraic curve f = 0 will be an invariant algebraic curve such
that f is an irreducible polynomial in the ring C[x,y].
A natural question in this subject is whether a polynomial vector ﬁeld has or not invariant
algebraic curves. The answer is not easy, see the large section in Jouanolou’s book [58], or
the long paper [79] devoted to show that one particular polynomial system has no invariant
algebraic solutions. Even one of the more studied limit cycles, the limit cycle of the van
der Pol system, until 1995 it was unknown that it is not algebraic [82]. Some results about
the algebraic limit cycles of quadratic polynomial vector ﬁelds can be found in [21].
1.5. Exponential factors
In this section we introduce the notion of an exponential factor due to Christopher [28].
We shall see that an exponential factor appears when an invariant algebraic curve has in
some sense multiplicity larger than 1. Therefore, as we shall show an exponential factor
will play the same role than an invariant algebraic curve in order to obtain a ﬁrst integral
for the polynomial system (1).
We assume that we have two invariant algebraic curves h = 0 and h + εg = 0 with
cofactors Kh and Kh+εg and that ε is in a neighborhood of zero. Using that Xh = Khh
and that X(h+εg) = Kh+εg(h+εg), if we expand in power series of ε the cofactor Kh+εg
we obtain that Kh+εg = Kh + εK + O(ε2), where K is some polynomial of degree at most
m −1.
Since
X

h

= X(h + εg)h −(h + εg)Xh
h2
= Kh+εg(h + εg)h −(h + εg)Khh

Therefore the function
h + εg
h
1/ε
has cofactor K + O(ε). As ε tends to zero, the above expression tends to
exp
g

(12)
and from (11) we obtain that
X

exp

.
(13)
Therefore, function (12) satisﬁes the same Equation (9) that the invariant algebraic curves,
with a cofactor of degree at most m −1.
Let h,g ∈C[x,y] and assume that h and g are relatively prime in the ring C[x,y]. Then
the function exp(g/h) is called an exponential factor of the F-polynomial system (1) if for
some polynomial K ∈C[x,y] of degree at most m −1 it satisﬁes Equation (13). As before
we say that K is the cofactor of the exponential factor exp(g/h).
As we will see from the point of view of the integrability of polynomial systems (1) the
importance of the exponential factors is double. On one hand, they verify Equation (13),
and on the other hand, their cofactors are polynomials of degree at most m −1. These
two facts will allow that they play the same role that the invariant algebraic curves in the
integrability of a polynomial system (1). We note that the exponential factors do not deﬁne
invariant curves for the ﬂow of system (1).
We remark that in the deﬁnition of exponential factor exp(g/h) we always allow that this
function is complex; that is h,g ∈C[x,y]. This is due to the same reason that in the case
of invariant algebraic curves. That is, sometimes for real polynomial systems the existence
of a real ﬁrst integral can be forced by the existence of complex exponential factors. Again
when we look for a complex exponential factor of a real polynomial system we are thinking
in the real polynomial vector ﬁeld as a complex one.
PROPOSITION 1.11. For a real polynomial system (1.9) the function exp(g/h) is an ex-
ponential factor with cofactor K if and only if the function exp( ¯g/¯h) is an exponential
factor with cofactor 
K. Again conjugation denotes conjugation of the coefﬁcients of the
polynomials only.
PROOF. We assume that exp(g/h) is an exponential factor with cofactor K of the real
polynomial system (1). Then equality (13) holds. Since P and Q are real polynomials
conjugating equality (13) we obtain that
P ∂exp( ¯g/¯h)
∂x
+ Q∂exp( ¯g/¯h)
∂y
= 
K exp( ¯g/¯h).

448
J. Llibre
Consequently, exp( ¯g/¯h) is an exponential factor with cofactor 
K of system (1). The proof
in the converse direction is similar.
□
PROPOSITION 1.12. If F = exp(g/h) is an exponential factor for the polynomial sys-
tem (1), then h = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve, and g satisﬁes the equation
Xg = gKh + hKF ,
where Kh and KF are the cofactors of h and F respectively.
PROOF. Since F = exp(g/h) is an exponential factor with cofactor KF , we have
KF exp

h2
,
or equivalently
(Xg)h −g(Xh) = h2KF .
Hence, since h and g are relatively prime, we obtain that h divides Xh. So h = 0 is an
invariant algebraic curve with cofactor Kh = Xh/h. Now substituting Xh by Khh in the
last equality, we have that Xg = gKh + hKF .
□
We remark that the exponential factors of the form exp(g/h) with h = constant ap-
pear when the straight line at inﬁnity is a solution with multiplicity higher than 1 for the
projectivized version of the vector ﬁeld, for additional details see [34].
2. Darbouxian theory of integrability
As far as we know, the problem of integrating a polynomial system by using its invariant
algebraic curves was started to be considered by Darboux in [38]. The version that we
present improves Darboux’s one essentially because here we also take into account the
exponential factors (see [28]), the independent singular points (see [26]), and the invariants
(see [9,11]).
Before stating the main results of the Darboux theory of integrability we need some de-
ﬁnitions. If S(x,y) = m−1
i+j=0 aijxiyj is a polynomial of degree m −1 with m(m + 1)/2
coefﬁcients in C, then we write S ∈Cm−1[x,y]. We identify the linear vector space
Cm−1[x,y] with Cm(m+1)/2 through the isomorphism S →(a00,a10,a01,...,am−1,0,
am−2,1,...,a0,m−1).
We say that r points (xk,yk) ∈C2, k = 1,...,r, are independent with respect to
Cm−1[x,y] if the intersection of the r hyperplanes

(aij) ∈Cm(m+1)/2:

is a linear subspace of Cm(m+1)/2 of dimension m(m + 1)/2 −r > 0.
We recall that (x0,y0) is a singular point of system (1) if P(x0,y0) = Q(x0,y0) = 0.
We remark that the maximum number of isolated singular points of the polynomial
system (1) is m2 (by Bezout theorem), that the maximum number of independent isolated
singular points of the system is m(m + 1)/2 −1, and that m(m + 1)/2 < m2 for m ⩾2.
A singular point (x0,y0) of system (1) is called weak if the divergence, div(P,Q), of
system (1) at (x0,y0) is zero.
THEOREM 2.1 (Darbouxian theory of integrability). Suppose that a F-polynomial sys-
tem (1) of degree m admits p irreducible invariant algebraic curves fi = 0 with co-
factors Ki for i = 1,...,p, q exponential factors exp(gj/hj) with cofactors Lj for
j = 1,...,q, and r independent singular points (xk,yk) such that fi(xk,yk) ̸= 0 for
i = 1,...,p and for k = 1,...,r. Note that the irreducible factors of the polynomials hj
are some fi’s.

(c) If p + q + r ⩾[m(m + 1)/2] + 2, then system (1) has a rational ﬁrst integral,

curves.

PROOF. We prove the theorem when the polynomial system (1) is complex. For the real
case, we only do some minor comments.
We denote Fj = exp(gj/hj). By hypothesis we have p invariant algebraic curves fi = 0

In statement (a) we claim that the function (14) is real if X is real. This follows from the
following fact. Since X is real, it is well known that if a complex invariant algebraic curve
or exponential factor appears, then its conjugate must appear simultaneously (see Proposi-
tions 1.8 and 1.11). If among the invariant algebraic curves of X a complex conjugate pair
f = 0 and ¯f = 0 occurs, the function (14) has a real factor of the form f λ ¯f ¯λ, which is the
multi-valued real function

if ImλImf ̸≡0. If among the exponential factors of X a complex conjugate pair F =

(b) Since the cofactors Ki and Lj are polynomials of degree ⩽m −1, we have that
Ki,Lj ∈Cm−1[x,y]. We note that the dimension of Cm−1[x,y] as a vector space over C
is m(m + 1)/2.
Since (xk,yk) is a singular point of system (1), P(xk,yk) = Q(xk,yk) = 0. Then,
from Xfi = P(∂fi/∂x) + Q(∂fi/∂y) = Kifi, it follows that Ki(xk,yk)fi(xk,yk) = 0.
By assumption fi(xk,yk) ̸= 0, therefore Ki(xk,yk) = 0 for i = 1,...,p. Again, from
XFj = P(∂Fj/∂x)+Q(∂Fj/∂y) = LjFj, it follows that Lj(xk,yk)Fj(xk,yk) = 0. Since
Fj = exp(gj/hj) does not vanish, Lj(xk,yk) = 0 for j = 1,...,q. Consequently, since
the r singular points are independent, all the polynomial Ki and Lj belong to a linear sub-
space S of Cm−1[x,y] of dimension [m(m+1)/2]−r. We have p +q polynomials Ki and
Lj and since from the assumptions p + q > [m(m + 1)/2] −r, we obtain that the p + q
polynomials must be linearly dependent on S. So, there are λi,μj ∈C not all zero such
that p
i=1 λiKi + q
j=1 μjLj = 0. Hence statement (b) is proved.
(c) Since the number of independent singular points r < m(m + 1)/2, it follows that
p + q > 2. Under the assumptions of statement (c) we apply statement (b) to two subsets
of p +q −1 > 0 functions deﬁning invariant algebraic curves or exponential factors. Thus,
we get two linear dependencies between the corresponding cofactors, which after some
linear algebra and relabeling, we can write into the following form
M1 + α3M3 + ··· + αp+q−1Mp+q = 0,

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
451
M2 + β3M3 + ··· + βp+q−1Mp+q = 0,
where Ml are the cofactors Ki and Lj, and the αl and βl are complex numbers. Then, by
statement (a), it follows that the two functions

3 ···Gαp+q
p+q

log

,
are ﬁrst integrals of system (1), where Gl is the polynomial deﬁning an invariant alge-
braic curve or the exponential factor having cofactor Ml for l = 1,...,p + q. Then, taking
logarithms to the above two ﬁrst integrals, we obtain that
H1 = log(G1) + α3 log(G3) + ··· + αp+q−1 log(Gp+q),
H2 = log(G2) + β3 log(G3) + ··· + βp+q−1 log(Gp+q),
are ﬁrst integrals of system (1). Each provides an integrating factor Ri such that
RiP = ∂Hi
∂y ,
RiQ = −∂Hi
∂x .
Therefore, we obtain that
R1
R2
= ∂H1/∂x
∂H2/∂x .
Since the functions Gl are polynomials or exponentials of a quotient of polynomials, it
follows that the functions ∂Hi/∂x are rational for i = 1,2. So, from the last equality, we
get that the quotient between the two integrating factors R1/R2 is a rational function. From
Proposition 1.5 it follows statement (c).
(d) We have λi,μj ∈C not all zero such that p
i=1 λiKi + q
j=1 μjLj = −div(P,Q).
Then, from the computations of the proof of statement (a), we obtain

div(P,Q).
So, from (7), statement (d) follows.
(e) Let K = div(P,Q), clearly K ∈Cm−1[x,y]. By assumption the r singular points
(xk,yk) are weak, therefore K(xk,yk) = 0 for k = 1,...,r. So K belongs to the linear
subspace S of the proof of statement (b).
On the other hand, since dim S = p + q = [m(m + 1)/2] −r ⩾0 and we have p + q + 1
polynomials K1,...,Kp, L1,...,Lq, K in S (we are using the same arguments that in

the proof of statement (b), it follows that these polynomials are linearly dependent on S.
Therefore, we obtain λi,μj,α ∈C not all zero such that

(16)
If α = 0 then, as in the proof of statement (a), we obtain that function (14) is a ﬁrst
integral of system (1).
We assume now that α ̸= 0. Dividing by α the equality (16) (if necessary), we can
assume without loss of generality that α = 1. So we have that

A (multi-valued) function of the form (14) is called a Darbouxian function. The associ-
ated ﬁrst integral to a Darbouxian integrating factor is called a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral.
3. Kapteyn–Bautin theorem
An interesting application of the Darbouxian theory of integrability allows us to present a
new and shorter proof of the sufﬁcient conditions for the classiﬁcation theorem of centers
of quadratic polynomial differential systems due to Kapteyn [59,60] and Bautin [6]. The
ﬁrst proof of this fact was due to Kapteyn in the 1910s. The proof that we present here can
be found in [9].
KAPTEYN–BAUTIN THEOREM. Any quadratic system candidate to have a center can be
written in the form
˙x = −y −bx2 −Cxy −dy2,
˙y = x + ax2 + Axy −ay2.
(17)

Integrability of polynomial differential systems

This system has a center at the origin if and only if one of the following conditions holds
(I) A −2b = C + 2a = 0,
(II) C = a = 0,
(III) b + d = 0,
(IV) C + 2a = A + 3b + 5d = a2 + bd + 2d2 = 0.
The following result gives a short proof of the sufﬁcient conditions of Kapteyn–Bautin
theorem.
THEOREM 4. If system (17) satisﬁes one of the four conditions of the Kapteyn–Bautin
theorem, then it has a center at the origin.
PROOF. Since system (17) has a linear center at the origin, this is a center or a focus. Con-
sequently, to prove that system (17) satisfying one of the four conditions of the Kapteyn–
Bautin theorem has a center at the origin, it is sufﬁcient to show that it has a ﬁrst integral
in a neighborhood of the origin.
Assume that system (17) satisﬁes condition (I). Then, it is easy to check that the system
is Hamiltonian, i.e., ˙x = −∂H/∂y, ˙y = ∂H/∂x with H = 1
2(x2 + y2) + a
3x3 + bx2y −
axy2 + d
3y3. Therefore H is a ﬁrst integral deﬁned in a neighborhood of the origin.
Suppose that system (17) satisﬁes condition (II). Then, the system can be written in the
form
˙x = −y −bx2 −dy2,
˙y = x + Axy.
If A ̸= 0 this system has the invariant straight line f1 = 1 + Ay = 0 with cofactor K1 =
Ax. The divergence of the system is (A −2b)x. Then, if A(A −2b) ̸= 0 we have the
divergence of the system is equal to (1 −2b
A )K1. Hence, by Theorem 2.1(d) we obtain that
(1 + Ay)2b/A−1 is an integrating factor of system (17). Since this integrating factor is not
zero at the origin, the associated ﬁrst integral is deﬁned in a neighborhood of the origin,
and consequently the origin is a center.
We can assume that A −2b ̸= 0, otherwise we would be under the assumptions of
condition (I). So, it remains only to study the case A = 0 and b ̸= 0. Then, the sys-
tem becomes ˙x = −y −bx2 −dy2, ˙y = x. This system has the algebraic solution f1 =
2b2(bx2 + dy2) + (b −d)(2by −1) = 0 with cofactor K1 = −2bx, which is equal to the
divergence of the system. Therefore, by Theorem 2.1(d) we obtain that f −1
1
is an inte-
grating factor. Hence the ﬁrst integral associated to this integrating factor is deﬁned at the
origin if b −d ̸= 0, and consequently the origin is a center.
Now we suppose that in addition b −d = 0. Then the system goes over to ˙x = −y −
b(x2 + y2), ˙y = x. From Examples 1.1 and 1.3 we know that H = exp(2by)(x2 + y2) is a
ﬁrst integral, which is deﬁned at the origin, and therefore the origin must be a center.
Assume that system (17) satisﬁes condition (III). As Frommer observed in [44] (see also
[92]) the form of system (17) with b+d = 0 is preserved under a rotation of axes. After per-
forming a rotation of axes of an angle θ, the new coefﬁcient a′ of x2 in the second equation
of system (13) becomes of the form a′ = a cos3 θ +α cos2 θ sinθ +β cosθ sin2 θ +d sin3 θ.

454
J. Llibre
Therefore, if a ̸= 0 we can ﬁnd θ such that a′ = 0. So we can assume that a = 0, and con-
sequently C ̸= 0; otherwise we would be under the assumptions of condition (II).
The system
˙x = −y −bx2 −Cxy + by2,
˙y = x + Axy,
has the algebraic solutions f1 = 1 + Ay = 0 if A ̸= 0 with cofactor K1 = Ax, and f2 =
(1 −by)2 + C(1 −by)x −b(A + b)x2 = 0 with cofactor K2 = −2bx −Cy. Since the
divergence of the system is equal to K1 + K2, by Theorem 2.1 (d) we obtain that f −1
1
f −1
2
is an integrating factor. Hence, again the ﬁrst integral associated to the integrating factor is
deﬁned at the origin, and consequently the origin is a center.
We remark that if A = 0 then f1 is not an algebraic solution of the system, but then the
divergence of the system is equal to K2 and the integrating factor of the system is f −1
2
, and
using the same arguments we obtain that the origin is a center.
Suppose that system (17) satisﬁes condition (IV). Then, if d ̸= 0 the system becomes
˙x = −y + a2 + 2d2
d
x2 + 2axy −dy2,
˙y = x + ax2 + 3a2 + d2
d
xy −ay2.
We note that if d = 0 then we are under the assumptions of condition (II). This system
has the algebraic solution f1 = (a2 + d2)[(dy −ax)2 + 2dy] + d2 = 0 with cofactor
K1 = 2(a2 + d2)x/d. Therefore the divergence of the system is equal to 5
2K1. Hence,
by Theorem 2.1(d) the function f −5/2
1
is an integrating factor of the system. Since d ̸= 0,
its associated ﬁrst integral is deﬁned in a neighborhood of the origin, and consequently the
origin is a center.
□
In order to see the explicit expression for the ﬁrst integrals of system (17) satisfying
conditions (I)–(IV), see Schlomiuk [92].
4. On the degree of the invariant algebraic curves
From Jouanolou’s result (see Theorem 2.1(c))) it follows that for a given polynomial dif-
ferential system of degree m the maximum degree of its irreducible invariant algebraic
curves is bounded, since either it has a ﬁnite number p < [m(m + 1)/2] + 2 of invariant
algebraic curves, or all its trajectories are contained in invariant algebraic curves and the
system admits a rational ﬁrst integral. Thus for each polynomial system there is a natural
number N which bounds the degree of all its irreducible invariant algebraic curves. A nat-
ural question, going back to Poincaré [86], is to give an effective procedure to ﬁnd N.
Partial answers to this question were given by Cerveau and Lins Neto [16], Carnicer [15],
Campillo and Carnicer [12], and Walcher [101]. These results depend on either restricting
the nature of the polynomial differential system, or more speciﬁcally on the singularities
of its invariant algebraic curves.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
455
Of course, given such a bound, it is then easy to compute the algebraic curves of the sys-
tem and also describe its elementary or Liouvillian ﬁrst integrals (modulo any exponential
factors) see for instance [73,28,84].
Unfortunately, for the class of polynomial systems with ﬁxed degree m, there does not
exist a uniform upper bound N(m) for N as shown by the system:
˙x = rx,
˙y = sy,
with r and s be positive integers. This system has a rational ﬁrst integral
H = yr
xs
and hence invariant algebraic curves xs −hyr = 0 for all h ∈C.
A common suggestion was that the following question would have a positive answer:
Given m ⩾2, is there a positive integer M(m) such that if a polynomial vec-
tor ﬁeld of degree m has an irreducible invariant algebraic curve of degree
⩾M(m), then it has a rational ﬁrst integral.
See for instance the open question 2 in [31], or the question at the end of the introduction
of [65].
The purpose of this section is to present two families of polynomial differential systems
of degree 2 without rational ﬁrst integrals but with irreducible invariant algebraic curves of
arbitrarily high degree. Thus we show that no such function M(m) exists.
THEOREM 4.1. We consider the quadratic polynomial differential system
˙x = x(1 −x),
˙y = −λy + Ax2 + Bxy + y2,
(18)
where
λ = c −1,
A = ab(c −a)(c −b)
c2
,
B = a + b −1 −2ab
c .
If, for any positive integer k, we choose a = 1 −k, b ⩽a, and c irrational, then the poly-
nomial system (18) has:
(a) no rational ﬁrst integrals;
(b) an irreducible invariant algebraic curve

y −ab
c x

F + x(1 −x)F ′ = 0,
of degree k, where F = F(a,b;c;x) is the hypergeometric function;
(c) a Darbouxian integrating factor.

456
J. Llibre
PROOF. We ﬁrst prove statement (a). We shall use the following result known by
Poincaré [86]: If a polynomial system (1.9) has a rational ﬁrst integral, then the eigen-
values λ1 and λ2 associated to any singular point of the system must be resonant in the
following sense: there exist nonnegative integers m1 and m2 with m1 + m2 ⩾1 such that
m1λ1 + m2λ2 = 0. For a proof see, for instance, [46] or [64]. Now it is easy to check that
the origin of system (18) is a singular point whose ratio of eigenvalues is 1 −c. Since c is
irrational, the system can have no rational ﬁrst integral.
The system (18) has the invariant solutions x = 0 and x = 1 together with the following
two explicit solutions:
f1 =

y −ab

F1 + x(1 −x)F ′

where F1 = F(a,b;c;x), F2 = F(1 + a −c,1 + b −c;2 −c;x), and F(a,b;c;x) is the
hypergeometric function
F(a,b;c;x) =
∞

k=0
(a)k(b)k
(c)k

Here we have used the notation
(a)k =

1,
if k = 0,
a(a + 1)(a + 2)···(a + k −1),
if k > 0.
The hypergeometric function F(a,b;c;x) is a solution of the hypergeometric differential
equation
x(1 −x)y′′ +

c −(a + b + 1)x

y′ −aby = 0,
and so F and F ′ can have a common zero only at x = 1.
If we take a = 1 −k, b ⩽a and c > 0 irrational, with k a positive integer, then
F(a,b;c;x) is a polynomial of degree k −1, with all coefﬁcients positive. Hence
F(1) > 0, and so F and F ′ can have no common roots at all. Thus f1 = 0 deﬁnes an
irreducible algebraic curve of degree k, which proves statement (b).
Finally, after some calculation it can be shown that
H = xc−1f1
f2
is a ﬁrst integral of the system, with (reciprocal) integrating factor
xcf 2
1 (1 −x)a+b+1−c
which proves statement (c).

Integrability of polynomial differential systems

Theorem 4.1 can be found in [32].
Moulin Ollagnier in [75] showed that the quadratic spatial homogeneous Lotka–Volterra
systems in C3:
˙x = x(Cy + z),
˙y = y(x + Az),
˙z = z(Bx + y),
(19)
with
(A,B,C) = −(2r + 1)/(2r −1),1/2,2
for r = 1,2,... has an invariant algebraic curve f (x,y,z) = 0 of degree 2r. So these
systems present invariant algebraic curves of unbounded degree. He added: It is not easy
to write f in “closed form”.
This previous example is interesting because it was used by Moulin Ollagnier in [78] to
provide another negative answer to the question about the existence of the number M(m).
Now we want to understand the algebraic structure of the invariant algebraic curves of
system (19), and at the same time we present a new proof of the existence of such invariant
algebraic curves. The proof of the existence presented here is essentially analytical, while
the proof of the existence given in [77,78] is algebraic.
The homogeneous Lotka–Volterra systems (19) in C3 can be thought as the planar pro-
jective model of the following planar Lotka–Volterra systems in C2:

Let f (x,y) ∈C[x,y]. If f = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve of the polynomial differ-

provide, respectively, the invariant algebraic curves stated in the theorem. So, in the rest of
the proof we assume that r ⩾3.
We consider the polynomial f (x,y) written in the form f (x,y) = f0(x) + f1(x)y +
··· + fr(x)yr. Since f = 0 must be an invariant algebraic curve it must satisfy

(23)
where we are forcing that the cofactor of f = 0 is −x.
Equaling to zero the coefﬁcients of the different powers yk in the expression (23) for
k = r +1,r,...,1,0, we obtain that the polynomials fj(x) for j = 0,1,...,r must satisfy
the following ordinary differential system
xf ′
r(x) −rfr(x) = 0,

Using the ﬁrst r + 1 equations of system (24) we can determine recursively fj(x) starting
with fr(x) and ending with f0(x) as follows. After, we must verify that the function f0(x)
obtained in this way satisﬁes the last equation of (24). Now, we will do these computations
carefully.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems

The general solution of the ﬁrst equation of system (24) is fr(x) = crxr, where cr is
the integration constant. Since we are looking for invariant algebraic curves f (x,y) of the
form (22), we take cr = 1. Then, it easy to see that the general solution of the differential
equation xf ′
j(x) −jfj(x) = pj(x) is
fj(x) = xj

only the constants c0 and c1 remain arbitrary.
On the other hand, if we solve the last differential equation of system (24), we get that
f0(x) = c(x −2)2, where c is the integration constant. The polynomial f (x,y) that we are
determining solving the differential system (24) provides an invariant algebraic curve of

In the light of these two theorems, we have:
OPEN QUESTION 4.3. There is some number D(m) for which any polynomial differential
system of degree m having some irreducible invariant algebraic curve of degree > D(m)
has a Darbouxian ﬁrst integral or Darbouxian integrating factor.
5. Darboux lemma
Darboux was the ﬁrst to give the following relation of enumerative geometry [38, pp. 83–
84]:
On peut rattacher cette recherche à un lemme relatif à six polynômes A, A′, B, B′, C, C′, de
degrés l,l′,m,m′,n,n′ satisfaisant à l’identité déjà considérée
(48)
AA′ + BB′ + CC′ = 0;

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
461
il est évident que les degrés des produits AA′,BB′,CC′ sont égaux.
On a donc déjà
l + l′ = m + m′ = n + n′ = λ.
Cela posé, je dis que la somme du nombre des points communs aux trois courbes
A = 0,
B = 0,
C = 0,
et du nombre des points communs aux trois courbes
A′ = 0,
B′ = 0,
C′ = 0,
est égale à
lmn + l′m′n′
λ
.
We will refer to this result as the Darboux lemma; it can be stated more precisely as follows.
DARBOUX LEMMA. Let K be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and let A,B,C,A′, B′,C′ be
six homogeneous polynomials of degrees l, m, n, l′, m′, n′ in three variables with coefﬁ-
cients in K such that:
(i) A,B,C are relatively prime and so are A′,B′,C′,
(ii) l + l′ = m + m′ = n + n′ = r and the orthogonality relation holds:
AA′ + BB′ + CC′ = 0,
(26)
(iii) the homogeneous ideal (A,B,C,A′,B′,C′) generated by all six polynomials has
no zero in the projective plane P2(K).
Then, the homogeneous ideals generated by the triples (A,B,C) and (A′,B′, C′) have
only ﬁnitely many zeroes in the projective plane.
Denoting by h and h′ the total multiplicities I(A,B,C) and I(A′,B′,C′) of these ho-
mogeneous ideals in the projective plane, there is a relation between h,h′ and the degrees:
h + h′ = lmn + l′m′n′
r
= r2 −r(l + m + n) + (lm + mn + nl).
(27)
Darboux started the proof of his result as follows
En effet, soient h le nombre des points communs aux trois courbes A,B,C; h′ celui des points
communs aux trois courbes A′,B′,C′, . . .
This original proof is wrong; in particular, Darboux paid little attention to the last hy-
pothesis (no common zeroes) and a counterexample is easy to ﬁnd. Jouanolou noticed
that Darboux’s result was wrong and established clearly the formula (27) in his book [58,
pp. 183–184], but his proof is far from being elementary. Jouanolou uses Chern’s classes.
Here, we present one of the two simple proofs given in [24]. Later on we shall apply Dar-
boux lemma to polynomial differential equations.
In the proof that we present here we use standard facts about the intersection index of
plane algebraic curves. This proof is divided into two steps. The ﬁrst step deals with a

462
J. Llibre
special case of the statement under extra assumptions and it follows the ideas of Darboux.
The second step consists in reducing the general case to the special case in order to get the
complete result.
In this section K will denote an algebraically closed ﬁeld. It will be convenient to denote
an ideal generated in some polynomial ring over K by the elements A1,...,Ak simply by
(A1,...,Ak). Other notations and deﬁnitions will be given when they become necessary.
We ﬁrst recall some standard facts about homogeneous ideals of the polynomial ring
A = K[x0,...,xt], that have only a ﬁnite number of zeroes in the projective space Pt(K).
Let P be a point in the projective space Pt(K). The local ring OP can be deﬁned in two
ways. First, it is the subring of the ﬁeld K(x0,...,xt)0 of homogeneous rational fractions
of degree 0 consisting of all those with a denominator that does not vanish at P . Second,
one of the projective coordinates of P does not vanish and there is no restriction in sup-
posing x0(P) ̸= 0 to ﬁx matters. Then the polynomial ring K[x1,...,xt] is isomorphic to
the quotient ring of K[x0,...,xt] by its ideal generated by x0 −1, and OP is the local ring
S−1K[x1,...,xt], where S is the multiplicative set of all t-variable polynomials that do
not vanish at P .
Let P be a point of Pt(K) and let I be a homogeneous ideal of A. The ideal IP is
the ideal of the local ring OP generated by I. If the quotient ring OP /IP is a ﬁnite-
dimensional vector space over K, its dimension is called the multiplicity or the intersection
index of I at P ; IP (I) is a convenient notation for this number. In particular IP (I) ̸= 0
means that P is a zero of I. Thus, if I is a homogeneous ideal with a ﬁnite number of
zeroes in Pt(K), the sum I(I) = 
P IP (I) over all zeroes of I is well deﬁned. It is called
the total multiplicity, or the total intersection index or the degree of I.
In the case of two or more three-variable homogeneous polynomials over K, A1,...,Ak
the intersection index IP (A1,...,Ak) at some point P of P2(K) can be deﬁned as
the corresponding index for the homogeneous ideal generated by A1,...,Ak. We note
IP (A1,...,Ak) = IP ((A1,...,Ak)).
In particular, if A1,...,Ak (with k ⩾2) are relatively prime, then IP (A1,...,Ak) is
deﬁned at every point P . On the other hand if they have a nontrivial greatest common
divisor D, IP (A1,...,Ak) is deﬁned at all points P of P2(K) where D(P) ̸= 0.
Here are some standard properties of the intersection index whose proof can be found in
the book of Fulton [45]. The ﬁrst two are general:
(i) IP (A1,...,Ak) only depends on the ideal (A1,...,Ak) of A,
(ii) in fact, IP (A1,...,Ak) only depends on the ideal generated by A1,...,Ak in OP : if
B(P) ̸= 0, B is invertible in OP and IP (BA1,A2,...,Ak) = IP (A1,A2,...,Ak).
The next two ones are speciﬁc to the three-variable case:
(iii) If B has no nontrivial common factor with CC′, IP (B,CC′) = IP (B,C) +
IP (B,C′) (Addition formula).
(iv) If F and G are two homogeneous polynomials without nontrivial common factor,
they have a ﬁnite number of common projective zeroes and I(F,G) = deg(F) ·
deg(G) (Bézout’s theorem).
We will call a family [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] of homogeneous polynomials in K[x,y,z]
an orthogonal system of polynomials if

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
463
(i) A,B,C are relatively prime, and so are A′,B′,C′,
(ii) deg(A) + deg(A′) = deg(B) + deg(B′) = deg(C) + deg(C′) = ρ(A,B,C, A′,B′,
C′), in which case ρ(A,B,C,A′,B′,C′) is called the degree of the system,
(iii) the orthogonality condition (26) AA′ + BB′ + CC′ = 0 holds.
We will say that an orthogonal system of polynomials [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] is without
projective zero if A,B,C,A′,B′,C′ have no common zero in the projective plane.
If [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] is an orthogonal system of polynomials, A,B,C are relatively
prime and the total intersection index I(A,B,C) is well-deﬁned and so is I(A′,B′,C′).
Now denote the degrees of the polynomials A,B,C,A′,B′,C′ by l,m,n, l′,m′,n′, re-
spectively, and the degree of the orthogonal system ρ(A,B,C, A′,B′,C′) by r, to simplify
the discussion.
The ratio
lmn + l′m′n′
r
= r2 −r(l + m + n) + (lm + mn + nl)
is a well-deﬁned positive integer, which is 0 when r = 0. We then denote
Δ(A,B,C,A′,B′,C′) = I(A,B,C) + I(A′,B′,C′) −lmn + l′m′n′
r
= h + h′ −lmn + l′m′n′
r
,
and call this difference the gap of the orthogonal system.
With these deﬁnitions, the Darboux lemma can be stated as
The gap is zero for an orthogonal system of polynomials without projective zero.
We ﬁrst give the result under the additional assumption that all six polynomials are
pairwise relatively prime except maybe A and A′, B and B′, C and C′; in other words,
we suppose that there is no nontrivial common factor to AA′,BB′,CC′, and we then say
that the orthogonal system is irreducible. This proof follows the ideas of Darboux. We will
afterwards reduce the general case to this special case.
In our opinion, it is convenient and nonconfusing to identify a homogeneous nonzero
three-variable polynomial F with the projective planar curve F = 0 it deﬁnes. We thus
follow the free intuitive notations of Darboux.
For instance, the notation “P ∈A ∩B” means that the point P of P2(K) is a common
zero of the two homogeneous polynomials A and B and belongs to the intersection of the
two curves A = 0 and B = 0, as well as the alternative notation “A(P) = 0 and B(P) = 0”.
PROPOSITION 5.1. Let [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] be an irreducible orthogonal system of poly-
nomials without projective zero. Then Δ(A,B,C,A′,B′,C′) = 0.
PROOF. We ﬁrst notice that IP (A,B,CC′) = IP (A,B,−AA′ −BB′) = IP (A,B) at
every point P of P2(K). We want to prove the following equality at P ∈A ∩B:
IP (A,B) = IP (A,B,CC′) = IP (A,B,C) + IP (A,B,C′).
(28)

464
J. Llibre
From the orthogonality relation (26), P ∈CC′ and, by exchanging A,B,C by A′,B′,C′,
there is no restriction in supposing C(P) = 0.
If C′(P) ̸= 0, IP (A,B,C′) = 0. According to Section 2, IP (A,B,C) = IP (A,B,
CC′) = IP (A,B) and equality (28) holds in this case.
We now suppose that C′(P) = 0. Since A ∩A′ ∩B ∩B′ ∩C ∩C′ = ∅, either
A′(P) ̸= 0 or B′(P) ̸= 0 and there is no restriction in supposing A′(P) ̸= 0. Then,
IP (A,B,C) = IP (A′A,B,C) = IP (B,C), IP (A,B,C′) = IP (A′A,B,C′) = IP (B,C′),
IP (A,B,CC′) = IP (A′A,B,CC′) = IP (B,CC′).
As B has no nontrivial common factor with C or C′, equality (28) follows from the
addition formula of the intersection index: IP (B,CC′) = IP (B,C) + IP (B,C′). The use
of the addition formula is the only place where the extra assumption that the orthogonal
system is irreducible plays a role.
Summing intersection indices at all points P ∈A ∩B, relation (28) leads to
lm = I(A,B) =

P∈A∩B
IP (A,B) =

P∈A∩B
IP (A,B,CC′)
=

P∈A∩B
IP (A,B,C) +

P∈A∩B
IP (A,B,C′) = h + (lm −h),
(29)
which means that the total intersection index I(A,B,C′) is lm −h.
Similar considerations lead to the next two equalities.
The ﬁrst one,
ln′ = I(A,C′) =

P∈A∩C′
IP (A,C′) =

P∈A∩C′
IP (A,BB′,C′)
=

P∈A∩C′
IP (A,B,C′) +

P∈A∩C′
IP (A,B′,C′)
= (lm −h) + ln′ −(lm −h),
(30)
means that the total intersection index I(A,B′,C′) is ln′ −lm + h.
The second one,
m′n′ = I(B′,C′) =

P∈B′∩C′
IP (B′,C′) =

P∈B′∩C′
IP (AA′,B′,C′)
=

P∈B′∩C′
IP (A,B′,C′) +

P∈B′∩C′
IP (A′,B′,C′)
= ln′ −lm + h + h′,
(31)
means that the total intersection index I(A′,B′,C′) is m′n′ −ln′ + lm −h. From this last
result, we deduce Δ(A,B,C,A′,B′,C′) = 0.
□
In order to prove the Darboux lemma in the general case, we need a way to reduce
non-irreducible orthogonal systems to irreducible ones. Let [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] be a non-

irreducible orthogonal system of polynomials. The orthogonality relation easily implies
that two polynomials of the same triple have a nontrivial great common divisor (gcd) and
there is no restriction in supposing that D = gcd(A,B) /∈K to describe what a reduction
is.
According to the orthogonality relation, D also divides C′ as it is coprime with C and we
have A = DA1,B = DB1,C′ = DC′
1, with gcd(A1,B1) = 1. Then [A1,B1,C,A′,B′,C′
1]
is another orthogonal system of polynomials. If [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] is without projective
zero, so is [A1,B1,C,A′,B′,C′
1]. We say that [A1,B1,C,A′,B′,C′
1] is a one-step reduc-
tion of [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′].
There are as many possible one-step reductions of an orthogonal system of polynomials
as pairs of noncoprime polynomials of the same triple. Thus, after at most six successive
one-step reductions, we get an irreducible orthogonal system that can be called the com-
plete reduction of the original one.
The following lemma is then the key to deduce the general case of the Darboux lemma
from the special case of irreducible orthogonal systems.
LEMMA 5.2. Let [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] be a nonirreducible orthogonal system of polyno-
mials without projective zero and such that D = gcd(A,B) /∈K. If [A1,B1,C,A′,B′,C′
1]
is the corresponding one-step reduction of [A,B,C, A′,B′,C′] then Δ(A,B,C,A′,B′,
C′) = Δ(A1,B1,C,A′,B′,C′
1).
PROOF. Let us denote by s the degree of D, so that deg(A1) = l1 = l −s, deg(B1) =
m1 = m −s, deg(C′
1) = n′
1 = n′ −s, ρ(A1,B1,C,A′,B′,C′
1) = r1 = r −s. h1 will stand
for I(A1,B1,C) and h′
1 for I(A1,B1,C).
With these notations, after straightforward cancellations, proving the announced result
amounts to proving
(h −h1) + (h′ −h′
1) = ns.
(32)
This relation (32) will come from h −h1 = ns and h′ −h′
1 = 0.
We ﬁrst show h −h1 = ns by proving the following equality for all P ∈A ∩B ∩C:
IP (A,B,C) = IP (A1,B1,C) + IP (D,C).
(33)
Let P belong to D ∩C. Since A ∩A′ ∩B ∩B′ ∩C ∩C′ = ∅, either A′(P) ̸= 0 or
B′(P) ̸= 0 and there is no restriction in supposing A′(P) ̸= 0.
Let then D′ be the greatest common divisor of B and C: B = D′B2,C = D′C2. As
A,B,C are relatively prime, D′ is relatively prime with D and it divides B1: B1 = D′B3;
it also divides A′, thus D′(P) ̸= 0. Then, IP (B,C) and IP (B1,C) are well-deﬁned and the
following equalities hold:
IP (A,B,C) = IP (AA′,B,C) = IP (B,C),
IP (A1,B1,C) = IP (A1A′,B1,C) = IP (B1,C).

466
J. Llibre
Now, the addition formula of the intersection index gives
IP (B,C) = IP (B2,C2) = IP (B3,C2) + IP (D,C2) = IP (B1,C) + IP (D,C).
Thus, for a P in D ∩C, equality (33) holds.
Consider now a point P in A ∩B ∩C that does not belong to D. Then IP (D,C) = 0
whereas IP (A,B,C) = IP (A1,B1,C) and equality (33) also holds.
Summing now equality (33) over all P ∈A ∩B ∩C gives
h = I(A,B,C) = I(A1,B1,C) + I(D,C) = h1 + sn,
(34)
according to Bézout’s theorem.
Now we show that h′ −h′
1 = 0 by proving IP (A′,B′,C′) = IP (A′,B′,C′
1) at all points
P of A′ ∩B′ ∩C′.
If P belongs to A′ ∩B′ ∩C′ without being in D, then, we have that IP (A′,B′,C′) =
IP (A′,B′,DC′
1) = IP (A′,B′,C′
1).
If P belongs to A′ ∩B′ ∩D, then P does not belong to C and
IP (A′,B′,C′) = IP (A′,B′,CC′) = IP (A′,B′)
= IP (A′,B′,CC1) = IP (A′,B′,C′
1).
□
We can now conclude.
COROLLARY 5.3 (Darboux lemma). Let [A,B,C,A′,B′,C′] be an orthogonal system of
polynomials without projective zero. Then Δ(A,B,C,A′,B′, C′) = 0.
PROOF. If [A1,B1,C1,A′
1,B′
1,C′
1] is the complete reduction of [A,B,C,A′, B′,C′],
then, according to Lemma 5.2, Δ(A,B,C,A′,B′,C′) is the same as Δ(A1,B1,C1,A′
1,
B′
1,C′
1) and, according to Proposition 5.1, Δ(A1,B1,C1, A′
1,B′
1,C′
1) = 0 for an irre-
ducible orthogonal system of polynomials.

6. Applications of the Darboux lemma
Ideas in the remaining part of this section go back to Darboux’s work [38]. Let p(x,y) and
q(x,y) be polynomials with complex coefﬁcients. For the vector ﬁeld
p ∂
∂x + q ∂
∂y ,
(35)
or equivalently for the differential system
˙x = p(x,y),
˙y = q(x,y),
(36)

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
467
we consider the associated differential 1-form ω1 = q(x,y)dx −p(x,y)dy, and the dif-
ferential equation
ω1 = 0.
(37)
Clearly, Equation (37) deﬁnes a foliation with singularities on C2. The afﬁne plane C2 is
compactiﬁed on the complex projective space CP2 = (C3 \ {0})/ ∼, where (X,Y,Z) ∼
(X′,Y ′,Z′) if and only if (X,Y,Z) = λ(X′,Y ′,Z′) for some complex λ ̸= 0. The equiva-
lence class of (X,Y,Z) will be denoted by [X :Y :Z].
The foliation deﬁned by equation (37) on C2 can be extended to a singular foliation
on CP2 and the 1-form ω1 can be extended to a meromorphic 1-form ω on CP2 which
yields an equation ω = 0, i.e.,
A(X,Y,Z)dX + B(X,Y,Z)dY + C(X,Y,Z)dZ = 0,
(38)
whose coefﬁcients A, B, C are homogeneous polynomials and satisfy the relation:
A(X,Y,Z)X + B(X,Y,Z)Y + C(X,Y,Z)Z = 0.
(39)
Indeed, consider the map i :C3 \ {Z = 0} →C2, given by i(X,Y,Z) = (X/Z,Y/Z) =
(x,y) and suppose that max{deg(p),deg(q)} = m > 0. Since x = X/Z and y = Y/Z we
have:
dx = (Z dX −X dZ)/Z2,
dy = (Z dY −Y dZ)/Z2,
the pull-back form i∗(ω1) has poles at Z = 0 and Equation (37) can be written as
i∗(ω1) = q(X/Z,Y/Z)(Z dX −X dZ)/Z2 −p(X/Z,Y/Z)(Z dY −Y dZ)/Z2
= 0.
Then the 1-form ω = Zm+2i∗(ω1) in C3 \ {Z ̸= 0} has homogeneous polynomial coefﬁ-
cients of degree m + 1, and for Z = 0 the equations ω = 0 and i∗(ω1) = 0 have the same
solutions. Therefore the differential equation ω = 0 can be written as (38) where
A(X,Y,Z) = ZQ(X,Y,Z) = Zm+1q(X/Z,Y/Z),
B(X,Y,Z) = −ZP(X,Y,Z) = −Zm+1p(X/Z,Y/Z),
C(X,Y,Z) = YP(X,Y,Z) −XQ(X,Y,Z).
(40)
Clearly A, B and C are homogeneous polynomials of degree m + 1 satisfying (39).
Singular points in P2(C) are the points satisfying A = B = C = 0.
A homogeneous 1-form
ω = AdX + B dY + C dZ = 0,

468
J. Llibre
where A, B and C are homogeneous polynomials of degree m + 1 is called projective if
XA + YB + ZC = 0; that is, if there exist three homogeneous polynomials L, M and N
of degree m such that
A = ZM −YN,
B = XN −ZL,
C = YL −XM;
or equivalently
(A,B,C) = (P,Q,R) ∧(X,Y,Z).
Then we can write
ω = P(Y dZ −Z dY) + Q(Z dX −X dZ) + R(X dY −Y dX).
(41)
The vector ﬁeld
X = P ∂
∂X + Q ∂
∂Y + R ∂
∂Z ,
(42)
can be thought as a homogeneous polynomial vector ﬁeld of C3 of degree m associated to
ω = 0.
In short, we have seen that the homogeneous vector ﬁeld (42) of degree m in C3 with
P = Zmp(X/Z,Y/Z),
Q = Zmq(X/Z,Y/Z),
R = 0,
(43)
is associated to the 1-form ω = 0, and consequently to the vector ﬁeld (35).
PROPOSITION 6.1 (Darboux proposition). For any homogeneous polynomial vector
ﬁeld (42) of degree m in C3 having ﬁnitely many singular points and satisfying (43), we
have that its number of singular points taking into account their multiplicities or numbers

Let f ∈C[x,y]. The algebraic curve f (x,y) = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve of the
afﬁne polynomial vector ﬁeld X given by (35) if for some polynomial k ∈C[x,y] (the
cofactor of f = 0), we have
Xf = ∂f
∂x p + ∂f
∂y q = kf.
It is easy to verify that if f (x,y) = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve of degree r for the
polynomial vector ﬁeld X with cofactor k(x,y), then F(X,Y,Z) = Zrf (X/Z,Y/Z) =
0 is an invariant algebraic curve of degree r for its projective vector ﬁeld with cofactor
K(X,Y,Z) = Zm−1k(X/Z,Y/Z); i.e.,
XF = ∂F
∂XP + ∂F
∂Y Q + ∂F
∂Z R = KF,
(44)
here R = 0.
If F(X,Y,Z) = 0 is an algebraic curve of P2(C) of degree n. Let p = (X0,Y0,Z0) be a
point of P2(C). Since the three coordinates of p cannot be zero, without loss of generality
we can assume that p = (0,0,1). Then suppose that the expression of F(X,Y,Z) restricted
to Z = 1 is
F(X,Y,1) = Fi(X,Y) + Fi+1(X,Y) + ··· + Fn(X,Y),
where 0 ⩽i ⩽n and Fj(X,Y) denotes a homogeneous polynomial of degree j in the
variables X and Y for j = i,...,n, with Fi different from the zero polynomial. We say
that i = mp(F) is the multiplicity of the curve F = 0 at the point p. If i = 0 then the point
p does not belong to the curve F = 0. If i = 1 we say that p is a simple point for the curve
F = 0. If i > 1 we say that p is a multiple point.
PROPOSITION 6.2. Let f (x,y) = 0 be an irreducible invariant algebraic curve of degree
n ⩾1 without multiple points for the afﬁne polynomial vector ﬁeld X of degree m. Then
n ⩽m + 1.
PROOF. Since F = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve of X with cofactor K we have that

and
h = I(A ∩B ∩C),
h′ = I(A′ ∩B′ ∩C′).
We note that by the assumptions h and h′ are ﬁnite. Moreover, as A ∩B ∩C = ∅, h = 0.
Since A, A′, B, B′, C and C′ satisfy equality (45), Darboux lemma can be used to get
h + h′ = m3 + (n −1)3
m + n −1
= m2 + (n −1)(n −m + 1).
(46)
By the Bézout theorem, the number of intersection points of the curves A′ = 0, B′ = 0 and
C′ = 0 is at most m2 taking into account their multiplicities; i.e., h′ ⩽m2. Whence a lower
bound for h: 0 = h ⩾(n −1)(n −m −1), and 1 ⩽n ⩽m + 1.

In [23] it has been proved the following result that provides sufﬁcient conditions for the
existence of a rational ﬁrst integral.
THEOREM 6.3. Let f (x,y) = 0 be an irreducible algebraic curve of degree n > 1, which
is invariant with cofactor k ̸= 0, for the afﬁne polynomial vector ﬁeld X of degree m > 1.
If m2 is the total number of solutions of the system
nP −XK = 0,
nQ −YK = 0,
ZK = 0,
(47)
in the projective plane, taken into account their multiplicities or numbers of intersection,
then X has a rational ﬁrst integral.
PROOF. Since m2 is the number of solutions of system (47), by using Bezout theorem it
follows that the number of solutions of systems
nP −XK = 0,
nQ −YK = 0,
Z = 0;
(48)
and
P = 0,
Q = 0,
K = 0;
(49)
are m and m2 −m respectively. We note that always we take into account the number of
solutions with their multiplicities.
We write
P(X,Y,Z) = p0Zm + p1(X,Y)Zm−1 + ··· + pm(X,Y),
Q(X,Y,Z) = q0Zm + q1(X,Y)Zm−1 + ··· + qm(X,Y),
K(X,Y,Z) = k0Zm−1 + k1(X,Y)Zm−2 + ··· + km−1(X,Y),

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
471
where Ai(x,y) denotes a homogeneous polynomial of degree i and A ∈{p,q,k}. Then,
for Z = 0 system (48) becomes
npm(X,Y) −Xkm−1(X,Y) = 0,
nqm(X,Y) −Ykm−1(X,Y) = 0.
Since this system of homogeneous polynomials of degree m in the variables X and Y
intersect at m points taking into account their multiplicities, there exists a homogeneous
polynomial A(X,Y) of degree m such that
pm(X,Y) = λ1A(X,Y) + 1
nXkm−1(X,Y),
qm(X,Y) = λ2A(X,Y) + 1
nYkm−1(X,Y),
where λ1,λ2 ∈C are not zero.
The polynomial system associated to the vector ﬁeld X can be written as
˙x = p0 + p1(x,y) + ··· + pm−1(x,y) + λ1A(x,y) + x
nkm−1(x,y)
= P(x,y,1),
˙y = q0 + q1(x,y) + ··· + qm−1(x,y) + λ2A(x,y) + 1y
n km−1(x,y)
= Q(x,y,1),
or equivalently
˙x = p0 + p1 + ··· + pm−1 −1
nx(k0 + k1 + ··· + km−2) + λ1A + 1
nxk,
˙y = q0 + q1 + ··· + qm−1 −1
ny(k0 + k1 + ··· + km−2) + λ2A + 1
nyk.
Since λ2
1 + λ2
2 ̸= 0 (otherwise system (48) does not have m intersection points), without
loss of generality we can assume that λ1 ̸= 0. We change from the variables (x,y) to the
variables (x,z) where z = λ2x −λ1y. In the new variables the second equation of the
polynomial system goes over to
˙z = λ2P(x,y,1) −λ1Q(x,y,1) = b(x,y) + 1
nzk(x,y),
with y = (λ2x −z)/λ1 and where

Since, from (49), the curves ˙x = P(x,y,1) = 0, ˙y = Q(x,y,1) = 0 and K(x,y,1) =
k(x,y) = 0 have m2 −m intersection points taking into account their multiplicities, it
follows that the curves P(x,y,1) = 0, b(x,y) + k(x,y)z/n = 0 and k(x,y) = 0 have
the same number of intersection points, where y = (λ2x −z)/λ1. Hence, the number of
intersection points of the curves b(x,y) = 0 and k(x,y) = 0 is at least m2 −m points
taking into account their multiplicities. But, from Bézout theorem, if these last two curves
do not have a common component, then they have (m −1)2 intersection points taking into
account their multiplicities. Since m2 −m > (m −1)2 if m > 1, it follows that the curves
b = 0 and k = 0 have a maximal common component c = 0 of degree r ⩾1. Therefore,
b = ¯bc and k = ¯kc where ¯b and ¯k are polynomials of degree m −r −1.
From (47) the number of intersection points of the curves P(x,y,1) = 0 and Q(x,
y,1) = 0 with k(x,y) = 0 is maximal, i.e., m2 −m, then the number of intersection points
of the curves P(x,y,1) = 0, Q(x,y,1) = 0 and ¯k(x,y) = 0 is m(m −r −1), and the
number of intersection points of the curves P(x,y,1) = 0, Q(x,y,1) = 0 and c(x,y) = 0
is mr. Of course, always we compute the number of intersection points taking into account
their multiplicities. Since the number of intersection points of the curves P(x,y,1) = 0,
b(x,y) + k(x,y)z/n = 0 and ¯k(x,y) = 0 is m(m −r −1), it follows that the number of
intersection points of the curves b(x,y) = 0 and ¯k(x,y) = 0 is at least m(m −r −1). On
the other hand, since the curves b = 0 and ¯k = 0 has no common components, by Bézout
theorem they intersect at (m−1)(m−r −1) points taking into account their multiplicities.
Hence, since m > 1 and m(m −r −1) > (m −1)(m −r −1) except if r = m −1, we
have that r = m −1. Therefore b = ak with a ∈C. So, ˙z = k(a + z/n), and consequently
z + an = λ2x −λ1y + an = 0 is an invariant straight line with cofactor k/n. Then, by
statement (a) of Theorem 2.1, we obtain that H = f (x,y)(λ2x −λ1y +an)−n is a rational
ﬁrst integral of X . We note that since f = 0 is different by a straight line, we have that
f ̸= (λ2x −λ1y + an)n, and consequently H is a ﬁrst integral.
□
From the proof of Theorem 6.3 it follows that any polynomial vector ﬁeld X in the
assumptions of Theorem 6.3 has an invariant straight line ax + by + c = 0 such that a
rational ﬁrst integral of X is of the form
f (x,y)
(ax + by + c)n .
Now we go back to study the number of multiple points that an invariant algebraic curve
of degree n of a polynomial vector ﬁeld of degree m can have in function of m and n.
PROPOSITION 6.4. Let f (x,y) = 0 be an invariant algebraic curve of degree n of the
polynomial vector ﬁeld
X = p(x,y) ∂
∂x + q(x,y) ∂
∂y
of degree m with cofactor k. Assume that:

then

Then

We note that by assumptions h and h′ are ﬁnite.
Since A, A′, B, B′, C and C′ satisfy equality (50), by Darboux lemma we obtain that
h + h′ = m3 + (n −1)3
m + n −1
= m2 + (n −1)(n −m + 1).

J. Llibre
Therefore the upper bound for h given in the statement of the theorem is proved. By Bézout
theorem, the number of intersection points of the curves A′ = 0, B′ = 0 and C′ = 0 is at
most m2 taking into account their multiplicities; i.e., h′ ⩽m2. Therefore, h ⩾(n −1)(n −
m −1), and the proposition is proved.
□
From Proposition 6.4 it follows as a corollary Proposition 6.2.
COROLLARY 6.5. Under the assumptions of Proposition 6.4, if f (x,y) = 0 is an invariant
algebraic curve of degree n = m + 1 for the polynomial vector ﬁeld X of degree m > 1
such that its projectivization F(X,Y,Z) = Znf (X/Z,Y/Z) = 0 has no multiple points,
then X has a rational ﬁrst integral.
PROOF. Using the same notation than in the proof of Proposition 6.4 we have that h′ = m2,
because from the assumptions we have that n = m + 1 and h = 0. Now, since we are in the
hypotheses of Theorem 6.3 the statement of the corollary follows.
□
The last result in this section about rational ﬁrst integrals is the following one.
PROPOSITION 6.6. Under the assumptions of Proposition 6.4, if f (x,y) is irreducible
in C[x,y] and all the multiple points of F(X,Y,Z) = 0 are double and ordinary, then
n ⩽2m. Moreover, if n = 2m then X has a rational ﬁrst integral.
PROOF. We use the notation and the results introduced in the proof of Proposition 6.4.
Since every multiple point p of F(X,Y,Z) = 0 is double and ordinary, it follows that

p, ∂F

If F = 0 is an irreducible algebraic curve of degree n, we know that

p

2mp(mp −1) ⩽1
2(n −1)(n −2),
(52)
where p runs over the multiple points of F = 0 and mp denotes the multiplicity of p,
for a proof of this result see Section 4 of Chapter 5 of [46]. Since every multiple point p
of F = 0 is double, mp = 2. If h is the number of multiple points of F = 0 taking into
account their multiplicity, from (51) and (52), it follows that h ⩽(n −1)(n −2)/2. By
Proposition 6.4, we have (n −1)(n −m −1) ⩽h. Consequently
(n −1)(n −m −1) ⩽1
2(n −1)(n −2).
Hence n ⩽2m, and the ﬁrst part of the proposition is proved.
Now we assume that n = 2m. From the proof of Proposition 6.4 we have that h + h′ =
m2 + (n −1)(n −m −1) = m2 + (2m −1)(m −1).Then since h ⩽(n −1)(n −2)/2 =

(2m −1)(m −1), we obtain that h′ ⩾m2. But, by deﬁnition, h′ ⩽m2. Hence, we are in
the assumptions of Theorem 6.3, and consequently X has a rational ﬁrst integral.

7. Algebraic limit cycles for quadratic systems
We recall that a limit cycle of a real afﬁne polynomial vector ﬁelds is an isolated periodic
orbit in the set of all periodic orbits of the system. An algebraic limit cycle of degree r is
an oval of an irreducible invariant algebraic curve f (x,y) = 0 of degree r which is a limit
cycle of the system.
In 1958 Qin Yuan-Xun [88] (see also [104]) proved that quadratic systems can have
algebraic limit cycles of degree 2, moreover when such a limit cycle exists then it is the
unique limit cycle of the system. Evdokimenco in [40–42] proved that quadratic systems
do not have algebraic limit cycles of degree 3, for two different shorter proofs see [22,25].
We provide one of these proofs in what follows.
THEOREM 7.1. Quadratic systems have no algebraic limit cycles of degree 3.
PROOF. Let f = 0 be an invariant algebraic curve of degree 3 of a real afﬁne polynomial
vector ﬁeld of degree 2. If the cubic curve f = 0 has multiple points, then it is rational (its
genus is 0) and there is no oval in it. If f = 0 has no multiple points, Equation (46) in the
proof of Proposition 6.2 implies h′ = 22 = 4. According to Theorem 6.3, the system has a
rational ﬁrst integral and thus no limit cycle.
□
The ﬁrst class of algebraic limit cycles of degree 4 was given in 1966 by Yablonskii
[103]. The second class was found in 1973 by Filiptsov [43]. Recently, two new classes
has been found and in [25] the authors proved that there are no other algebraic limit cycles
of degree 4 for quadratic systems. The uniqueness of these limit cycles has been proved
in [21]. We summarize all these results into the following theorem, for a proof see the
mentioned papers.
THEOREM 7.2. The following statements hold.
(a) After an afﬁne change of variables and a rescaling of the time variable the only
quadratic systems having an algebraic limit cycle of degree 2 are
˙x = −y(ax + by + c) −x2 + y2 −1,
˙y = x(ax + by + c),
(53)
with c2 + 4(b + 1) < 0 and a2 + b2 < c2. This system possesses the irreducible
invariant algebraic curve
x2 + y2 −1 = 0,
of degree 2. This algebraic limit cycle is the unique limit cycle of system (18).

one singular point of the system, see Figure 1(d).
(d) Quadratic systems (53), (54), (56), (57) and (58) have a unique limit cycle, the
algebraic one.
We note that the algebraic limit cycle of Filiptsov’s system is born in a Hopf bifurcation
at the singular point (4,48/13) when a = 3/13. Then, when a decreases the algebraic limit
cycle increases its size and ends having inﬁnite size at the curve y2(3 −6x +4y) = 0 when
a = 0.
We note that the algebraic limit cycle of system (c.3) is born in a Hopf bifurcation at
the singular point ((9 −

17)/8,−(5 + 3
√
17)/8) when a = (−71 + 17

17)/32. Then,
when a increases the algebraic limit cycle increases its size and ends having inﬁnite size at
the curve x2(1 + x + y) = 0 when a = 0.

J. Llibre
We note that the algebraic limit cycle of system (c.4) is born in a Hopf bifurcation at the
singular point (2,−1/4) when a = 1/4. Then, when a decreases the algebraic limit cycle
increases its size and ends having inﬁnite size at the irreducible curve 1/4 +x −x2 +xy +
x2y2 = 0 when a = 0.
The uniqueness of limit cycles for planar differential systems is a classical problem
which, in general, does not have an easy solution, for more details see the books of Ye
Yanqian [104] and Zhang Zhifen [105].
Now following the paper [35] we apply a change of variables to the known quadratic
systems having an algebraic limit cycle, which preserves the degree of the system, but
increases the degree of the algebraic curve. For this purpose we use the birational transfor-
mation
(x,y) →

x/y2,1/y

,
(60)
after an appropriate translation. In fact, this transformation is an involution.
If the system is of the form
˙x = αx + βy + 2ex2 + bxy + cy2,
˙y = γ x + δy + exy + fy2,
(61)
then it is easy to see that we can apply the transformation above and still remain in the
class of quadratic systems.
As a simple example, we show that the example of Yablonskii with an algebraic limit
cycle of degree 4 can be obtained from the well-known example of an algebraic limit cycle
of degree 2 due to Qin Yuan-Xun [88].
PROPOSITION 7.3. The system of Yablonskii (54) with its irreducible invariant algebraic
curve (55) can be transformed into the system

and 4c2(a −b)2 + (3a −b)(a −3b) < 0, and the transformation maps the one limit cycle
onto the other.

We now apply the birational transformation to system (58) having the irreducible invari-
ant algebraic curve (59) which deﬁnes an algebraic limit cycle of degree 4 for 0 < a < 1/4,
and we get a quadratic system having an algebraic limit cycle of degree 5.

by v6. The irreducibility of (64) follows from the irreducibility of (59).
Since the curve (59) contains an algebraic limit cycle for a ∈(0,1/4), one may easily
check, that the above oval does not intersect the singular line of the transformation (65), so
the theorem follows.

In a similar way we have the following result.
THEOREM 7.5. System

For β ∈(3/2,2) the curve (67) contains an algebraic limit cycle of degree 6.
PROOF. Let a = (4 −β2)/7. When we make the change of coordinates

multiply by −21βu/2, and replace (u,v) again with (x,y), system (58) becomes (66).
The curve (67) is obtained from (59) by means of the same change of coordinates and
multiplication by 2016β2(β2 −4)2u6. The irreducibility of (67) is now obvious.
Since the curve (59) contains an algebraic limit cycle for a ∈(0,1/4), the theorem fol-
lows in a way similar to the last part of Theorem 7.4.

After these results some natural questions are:
OPEN QUESTION 7.6. Does there exist a chain of rational transformations like the ones
above which give examples of quadratic polynomial systems with algebraic limits cycles of
arbitrary degree?
OPEN QUESTION 7.7. What is the maximum degree of all algebraic limit cycles for
quadratic systems?
8. Limit cycles and algebraic limit cycles
In this section we follow the paper [69]. In 1900 Hilbert [55] in the second part of its 16th
problem proposed to ﬁnd an estimation of the uniform upper bound for the number of limit
cycles of all polynomial vector ﬁelds of a given degree, and also to study their distribution
or conﬁguration in the plane. This has been one of the main problems in the qualitative
theory of planar differential equations in the XX century. The contributions of Bamon [5]
for the particular case of quadratic vector ﬁelds, and mainly of Écalle [39] and Ilyashenko
[57] proving that any polynomial vector ﬁeld has ﬁnitely many limit cycles have been the
best results in this area. But until now it is not proved the existence of an uniform upper
bound. This problem remains open even for the quadratic polynomial vector ﬁelds.
A conﬁguration of limit cycles is a ﬁnite set C = {C1,...,Cn} of disjoint simple closed
curves of the plane such that Ci ∩Cj = ∅for all i ̸= j.
Given a conﬁguration of limit cycles C = {C1,...,Cn} the curve Ci is primary if there
is no curve Cj of C contained into the bounded region limited by Ci.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
481
Two conﬁgurations of limit cycles C = {C1,...,Cn} and C′ = {C′
1,...,C′
m} are (topo-
logically) equivalent if there is a homeomorphism h:R2 →R2 such that h((n
i=1 Ci) =
((m
i=1 C′
i). Of course, for equivalent conﬁgurations of limit cycles C and C′ we have that
n = m.
We say that the vector ﬁeld X realizes the conﬁguration of limit cycles C if the set of
all limit cycles of X is equivalent to C.
THEOREM 8.1. Let C = {C1,...,Cn} be a conﬁguration of limit cycles, and let r be its
number of primary curves. Then the following statements hold.
(a) The conﬁguration C is realizable by a polynomial vector ﬁeld.
(b) The conﬁguration C is realizable as algebraic limit cycles by a polynomial vector
ﬁeld of degree ⩽2(n + r) −1.
In the proof of Theorem 8.1 we shall provide an explicit expression for the polynomial
differential system of degree at most 2(n + r) −1 satisfying statement (b) of Theorem 8.1.
Of course, statement (a) of Theorem 8.1 follows immediately from statement (b).
The problem of given a conﬁguration of limit cycles realize it by a polynomial differ-
ential system has been studied by several authors. Thus, for Cr vector ﬁelds the problem
has been solved by Al’mukhamedov [1], Balibrea and Jimenez [4] and Valeeva [99]. State-
ment (a) of Theorem 8.1 has been solved by Schecter and Singer [90] and Sverdlove [98],
but they do not provide an explicit polynomial vector ﬁeld satisfying the given conﬁgura-
tion of limit cycles. The result presented in statement (b) of Theorem 8.1 appears in [69],
and its proof provides simultaneously the shortest and easiest proof of statement (a) of
Theorem 8.1.
We consider C1 the vector ﬁeld
X = P ∂
∂x + Q ∂

deﬁned in the open subset U of R2. Then, X is exact in U if
∂P
∂x = −∂Q

for all (x,y) ∈U. Furthermore, if U is simply connected, then there exists a function
H :U →R satisfying
P = −∂H
∂y ,
Q = ∂H
∂x .
Therefore, the function H is the Hamiltonian of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld X . Clearly,
the Hamiltonian function is a ﬁrst integral of X .

U: V (x,y) = 0}.
The following result due to Giacomini, Llibre and Viano [47] will be essential in our
proof of statement (b) of Theorem 8.1. Here, we provide an easier and direct proof.
THEOREM 8.2. Let X be a C1 vector ﬁeld deﬁned in the open subset U of R2. Let V :U →
R be an inverse integrating factor of X. If γ is a limit cycle of X, then γ is contained in
Σ = {(x,y) ∈U: V (x,y) = 0}.
PROOF. Due to the existence of the inverse integrating factor V deﬁned in U, we have that
the vector ﬁeld X/V is Hamiltonian in U \ Σ. Since the ﬂow of a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
preserves the area and in a neighborhood of a limit cycle a ﬂow does not preserve the area,
the theorem follows.
□
PROOF OF THEOREM 8.1. Let C = {C1,...,Cn} be the conﬁguration of limit cycles
given in the statement of Theorem 8.1. For every primary curve Cj we select a point pj in
the interior of the bounded component limited by Cj . Since we will work with an equiva-
lent conﬁguration of limit cycles, without loss of generality we can assume that
(i) each curve Ci is a circle deﬁned by
fi(x,y) = (x −xi)2 + (y −yi)2 −r2
i = 0,
for i = 1,...,n; and that
(ii) the primary curves of the conﬁguration C are the curves Cj, and the selected
points pj have coordinates (xj,yj), for j = 1,...,r.
For every selected point pj we deﬁne
fn+2j−1(x,y) = (x −xj) + i(y −yj),
fn+2j(x,y) = (x −xj) −i(y −yj).

(72)
Therefore, since H and )n+2r
k=1 fk are real functions, we get that P , Q, and consequently
X are real.

484
J. Llibre
Clearly, from the deﬁnition of X it follows that P and Q are polynomials of degree at
most n + 2r −1. So, X is a real polynomial vector ﬁeld of degree at most n + 2r −1.
From (72) it follows that V = )n+2r
k=1 fk is a polynomial inverse integrating factor of X ,
and that H is a Hamiltonian for the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld

deﬁned in R2 \ {V = 0}.
Since V is polynomial, V is deﬁned in the whole R2. Therefore, by Theorem 8.2 and
since V (x,y) = 0 if and only if (x,y) ∈((n
i=1 Ci)∪{p1,...,pr}, if the vector ﬁeld X has
limit cycles, these must be the circles Ci for i = 1,...,n. Now, we shall prove that all these
circles are limit cycles. Hence, the polynomial vector ﬁeld X will realize the conﬁguration
of limit cycles {C1,...,Cn} and the theorem will be proved.
We note that since 
H = exp(H) is a ﬁrst integral of the vector ﬁeld X in R2 \ {V = 0},
the circles are formed by solutions because they are contained in the level curve ˜V = 0, and
V = 0 is formed by solutions. Now we shall prove that on every circle Ci there is no singu-
lar points of X and, therefore, Ci will be a periodic orbit. Assume that (x0,y0) is a singular
point of X contained into the circle Ci; i.e., P(x0,y0) = Q(x0,y0) = fi(x0,y0) = 0. From
the deﬁnition of P and Q we have that

∂y (x0,y0) = 0. There-
fore, the point (x0,y0) is the center of the circle Ci in contradiction that fi(x0,y0) = 0.
Hence, every circle Ci is a periodic orbit of the vector ﬁeld X . Now, we shall prove that
Ci will be a limit cycle, and this will complete the proof of Theorem 8.1.
We note that all circles Ci and all points pj are in the level 
H(x,y) = 0, and that they are
the unique orbits of X in this level. Now suppose that Ci is not a limit cycle. Then, there is
a periodic orbit γ = {(x(t),y(t)): t ∈R} different from C1,...,Cn and sufﬁciently close
to Ci such that in the bounded component B limited by γ there are the same points of
{p1,...,pr} than in the bounded component limited by Ci. Without loss of generality we
can assume that these points are p1,...,ps.
As γ is different from C1,...,Cn, there exists h ̸= 0 such that

where θj(t) = arg[(x(t) −xj) + i(y(t) −yj)]. The function A(x(t),y(t)) B(x(t),y(t)) is
bounded on γ . Clearly, the angles θ1(t),...,θs(t) tend all simultaneously (due to its def-
inition) to either +∞or −∞, when t →+∞, while the angles θs+1(t),...,θr(t) remain
bounded when t →+∞. These facts are in contradiction with equality (73). Consequently,
we have proved that Ci is a limit cycle. In short, Theorem 8.1 is proved.

9. Darbouxian theory of integrability and centres
In this section we follow the paper [30]. One of the main applications of the Darbouxian
theory of integrability is proving the existence of a centre, see for instance Section 3.
In the elementary theory of qualitative differential equations we identify three main types
of behavior at a nondegenerate singular point: a node, a focus, or a saddle. All three are
stable, in that a small perturbation will not change the stability of the singular point. More-
over, topologically, we can read off their behavior from just their linear terms. However,
there is also the possibility that the singular point is a ﬁne focus or a centre. That is, the
divergence vanishes at that point. In this case the linear terms give a centre: a neighborhood
of the origin which consists of closed trajectories. In this case, the nonlinear terms must
be examined in order to determine whether the point is stable or unstable. If it is neither
and the system is analytic, then the singular point is also a centre for the nonlinear system.
Without loss of generality, we can consider the singular point to be at the origin and to be
in the form
˙x = λx −y + p(x,y),
˙y = x + λy + q(x,y),
(74)
where p and q represent the nonlinear terms. The case of a ﬁne focus or centre corresponds
to λ = 0.
We can distinguish between a centre and a (ﬁne) focus in a number of ways; we follow
the most direct ﬁrst. It can be shown that for any N there is a change of coordinates which
brings the origin of (74) to the polar form
˙r = c3r3 + c5r5 + ··· + O

rN
,
˙θ = 1 + d2r2 + d4r4 + ··· + O

rN
.
(75)
If all the ci are zero up to c2k+1, then the system is said to have a ﬁne focus of order k. The
stability is given by the sign of c2k+1.
It can also be shown that perturbations of the nonlinear terms of (74) can produce in
this case at most k limit cycles bifurcating from the origin. Furthermore, if the class of
systems (74) are sufﬁciently general, there are perturbations which produce this number of
limit cycles in a multiple Hopf bifurcation. We call c2k+1 the kth Liapunov quantity.
If all the ci are zero, then it can be shown that there is an analytic change of coordinates
which brings the system into the polar form
˙r = 0,
˙θ = 1 + d2r2 + d4r4 + ···.
The singular point is obviously a centre in this case.

486
J. Llibre
Given a class of polynomial equations in the form (74), we are often interested in the sub-
class with centres at the origin. The problem is that showing that we have a centre requires
an inﬁnite number of conditions. However, if we could ﬁnd an analytic ﬁrst integral in a
neighborhood of the singular point, then the singular point must be a centre. In fact, the
linear terms of (74) implies that the ﬁrst terms of such an integral are a +b(x2+y2)s +···,
and therefore trajectories close to the origin are closed.
Alternatively, we could ﬁnd an integrating factor which is well-deﬁned and nonzero in a
neighborhood of the singular point. In either case an obvious method for constructing such
functions is the Darbouxian theory of integrability. The surprising thing is that this method
is so successful.
THEOREM 9.1. All the nondegeneratecentres of systems (74) with homogeneousquadratic
or cubic p and q are integrable with Darbouxian ﬁrst integrals. The same is true if p and
q are of the form
p = p2 + xf,
q = q2 + yf,
where p2, q2 and f are all homogeneous quadratics.
For a proof of this theorem see [92,89,9].
The last system is the projective version of the quadratic systems and in fact was the
system studied by Darboux.
As an example of this, consider the system
˙x = y + a1x2 + (a2 + 2b1)xy −a1y2 + x2y,
˙y = −x + b1x2 + (b2 −2a1)xy −b1y2 + xy2,
generically this has 4 invariant lines, whose cofactors are all of the form
αx + βy + xy.
Hence we can conclude that the system has a centre at the origin.
Another method for distinguishing between a focus and a centre is to use a Liapunov
function. This is a function V = k + x2 + y2 + O((x2 + y2)3/2) which satisﬁes
dV
dt = η4
x2 + y24 + η6
x2 + y26 + ··· + Ox2 + y2N/2.
(76)
Such a function can always be found in the neighborhood of a ﬁne focus. The origin is a
centre if all the ηi vanish. If η2k+2 is the ﬁrst nonzero term, then the origin is a ﬁne focus
of order k. Computationally, this method is easier to handle than the normal form (75).
The coefﬁcients η2i+2 are essentially positive multiples of the c2i+1 if we assume that the
previous η2j+1, j < i vanish.
There is also a third method, closely related to the second. Here we seek a function
which is almost an integrating factor. That is we look for a function R = 1 + O(x,y)

(77)
Here the origin is a centre if all the ζi vanish, and a ﬁne focus of order k if ζ2k is the
ﬁrst nonzero term. The advantage here is that the degrees of the polynomials required here
is less than (76). Again the coefﬁcients ζ2i are essentially positive multiples of the c2i+1
modulo the previous ζ2j’s.
Now, suppose we are seeking conditions for a centre at the origin. Consider a Darboux-
ian function B which is composed of invariant algebraic curves which do not pass through
the origin and exponential factors. Such a B is well-deﬁned at the origin and

Since the invariant algebraic curves do not pass through the origin, then the deﬁnition of
invariant algebraic curve implies that the cofactors Li must vanish there. We also assume
that the divergence is zero at the origin, or there would be no centre. If we have at least
m(m+1)/2−1−q invariant algebraic curves and exponential factors, 0 < q ⩽(m−1)/2,
then we can choose the li nontrivially so that the square brackets of one of the expressions
above lies in the vector space generated by the polynomials (x2 + y2)j, j = 1,...,q.
Comparing these expressions with (76) and (77), we obtain the following result.
THEOREM 9.2. Suppose the origin is a ﬁne focus, and that the ﬁrst q Liapunov quantities
at the origin vanish, 0 < q ⩽(m −1)/2. If there are at least m(m + 1)/2 −1 −q invariant
algebraic curves or exponential factors not passing through the origin, then there is a
local Darbouxian integrating factor. If there are at least m(m + 1)/2 −q, then there is a
Darbouxian ﬁrst integral. In either case the origin is a centre.
The result was ﬁrst noticed by Cozma and ¸Sub˘a [37,94] using different methods. Another
related result is Chavarriga, Giacomini and Giné [18].
10. Non-existence of limit cycles
This section follows the paper [30]. We rename a Liapunov function a function φ(x,y) for
which
Dφ > 0

488
J. Llibre
in the region of interest. Clearly the existence of such a function in a region precludes the
existence of periodic solutions and, in particular, limit cycles.
In the same way, we deﬁne a Dulac function to be a function R such that
∂
∂x
P
R

+ ∂
∂y
Q

> 0.
By applying the divergence criterion, we can see that such a function also precludes the
existence of periodic solutions or limit cycles in any simply connected region where R is
well-deﬁned and nonzero.
The analogy between these functions and the ﬁrst integrals and integrating factors ex-
amined up to now is obvious. In particular, given a collection of invariant algebraic curves
or exponential factors with cofactors Li, if we can ﬁnd constants li such that

liLi > 0,
or
div(P,Q) −

liLi > 0,
then there are no limit cycles in any simply connected region where the Darbouxian func-
tion is well deﬁned.
For example, the Lokta–Volterra equations are quadratic with two invariant lines. There
is also a singular point which does not lie on either line around which any limit cycle must
lie. Thus the cofactors of the two lines must vanish at this point. If the divergence also
vanishes at the singular point, then we can ﬁnd a linear dependency between the cofactors
and the divergence which means that the system must be integrable and we have a family
of closed orbits. If the divergence does not vanish then we can construct a Dulac function
of Liapunov function as above. Thus there are no limit cycles in either case.
The example above shows in a simple way how detailed calculations can be reduced to
simple geometric arguments instead. We could have replaced the lines above by invariant
hyperbolas or parabolas with no increase in difﬁculty.
If one of the curves was an ellipse, however, we might have problems. First, the ellipse
may be a limit cycle in its own right. Second, if the polynomial representing the ellipse
appeared to a negative power in the Dulac function, then we cannot apply Green’s theorem
since the region surrounding the ellipse is not simply connected. This can be overcome in
certain cases by considering line integrals around the loop itself.
In order to get some deeper results, we need to allow some curves which are almost in-
variant. Rather than abstract things more, we give an example which is very representative
of other results.
THEOREM 10.1. Suppose a quadratic system has an invariant algebraic curve and a sin-
gular point not on this curve where the divergence vanishes, then the system has no limit
cycles in any simply connected region of the complement of the curve.
PROOF. Any limit cycle in a quadratic system surrounds only one singular point which
must be a focus (see [104]). Suppose a limit cycle surrounds a singular point with nonzero
divergence. Let C = 0 be the invariant algebraic curve with cofactor L. Thus

PCr
x +

QCr
y = Cr(rL + Δ).

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
489
In this section we denote by Δ the divergence of the system, i.e., Δ = Px + Qy. Since
both L and Δ must pass through the other singular point, and limit cycles of quadratic
system must be convex, we can chose r so that rL + Δ does not pass through the limit
cycle. Hence we have a Dulac function in this case, which contradicts our assumption of a
limit cycle.
Suppose now that there is a limit cycle which surrounds the divergence free singular
point. Since this point must be a focus we transform the system to the form
P = −y + ax2 + bxy + cy2,
Q = x + dx2 + exy + fy2.
A further rotation allows us to set c = 0 without loss of generality. Consider the function
G = x −1/b for b ̸= 0 and G = ex if b = 0. We calculate
d
dt G =
byG + ax2,
b ̸= 0,
−yG + ax2G,
b = 0.
Thus the line G = 0 is a transversal, and no limit cycle can cross it. Now, we calculate that

PCrGs

QCrGs
y =
CrGs−1(G[rL + sby + Δ] + sax2),
b ̸= 0,
CrGs−1(G[rL −sy + Δ] + sGax2),
b = 0.
In either case we can ﬁnd values of r and s to eliminate the term in square brackets. Once
again we have a Dulac function.
□
It seems that algebraic curve methods are the natural ones for proving nonexistence of
limit cycles. In Coppel’s survey paper [36], for example, all the nonexistence results are
obtained this way except one which uses a Liénard system argument. We reprove this here
using algebraic curves.
THEOREM 10.2. A quadratic system (2) with rP + sQ = ΔM for some polynomial M
and real numbers r and s can have no limit cycles. In particular, a quadratic system with
two singular points with zero divergence has no limit cycles.
PROOF. If Δ is a constant we have ﬁnished. If Δ = a(rx + sy + t) for some a and t,
then Δ = 0 would be an invariant line. All limit cycles would have to lie in one of the
regions Δ > 0 or Δ < 0 which is not possible. Hence the linear terms of Δ must be linearly
independent from rx + sy for limit cycles to exist. We can therefore write M = aΔ +

and so we have a Dulac function in this case too.

Is it possible to extend these methods to prove the uniqueness of limit cycles if we allow
the Dulac function to vanish at the singular point which the limit cycle surrounds? It would
be very nice if this was true as many of the uniqueness results for quadratic systems have a
nice algebraic content. For example a quadratic system with an invariant line or an invariant
parabola have at most one limit cycle. However, no such methods are known at the moment
and other less direct methods need to be used.
We ﬁnish with a simple example of such a proof. We show that the van der Pol oscillator
has a unique limit cycle for small values of the nonlinear terms.
THEOREM 10.3. The system
˙x = y,
˙y = −x −μ

y
has at most one limit cycle for |μ| <

PROOF. We ﬁrst let Y = y + μ(x −x3/3) to transform the system to the Liénard plane:
˙x = Y −μ

x −x3/3

,
˙Y = −x.
Now, taking B = (x2 −μxY + Y 2)−1, we have
(B ˙x)x + (B ˙y)y = μB2x2
x2/3 −2μxY/3 + Y 2
.
For |μ| <
√
3, B is positive deﬁnite and we have a Dulac function deﬁned in the whole
of the plane except at the origin. Since each limit cycle must surround the origin, a simple
application of Green’s theorem shows that there can be at most one limit cycle.

11. The inverse problem
In this section we are mainly interested in the polynomial differential systems which have
a given set of invariant algebraic curves, independently if they are integrable or not. Thus,
ﬁrst we study the normal forms of planar polynomial vector ﬁelds having a given set of
generic invariant algebraic curves. That is, in some sense we are interested in a kind of
inverse theory of the Darboux theory of integrability. We follow the paper [33]. The main
result of this section is the following one.
THEOREM 11.1. Let Ci = 0 for i = 1,...,p, be irreducible invariant algebraic curves
in C2, and set r = p
i=1 degCi. We assume that all Ci satisfy the following generic condi-
tions:
(i) There are no points at which Ci and its ﬁrst derivatives are all vanish.
(ii) The highest order terms of Ci have no repeated factors.
(iii) If two curves intersect at a point in the ﬁnite plane, they are transversal at this
point.
(iv) There are no more than two curves Ci = 0 meeting at any point in the ﬁnite plane.
(v) There are no two curves having a common factor in the highest order terms.
Then any polynomial vector ﬁeld X of degree m tangent to all Ci = 0 satisﬁes one of the
following statements.
(a) If r < m + 1 then
X =

(78)
where XCi = (−Ciy,Cix) is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, the hi are polynomials of
degree no more than m −r + 1, and the Y is a polynomial vector ﬁeld of degree no
more than m −r.
(b) If r = m + 1 then
X =

with αi ∈C.
(c) If r > m + 1 then X = 0.
This theorem due to Christopher [28] was stated in several papers without proof like
[28] and [61], and used in other papers as [9] and [66]. The proof that we present here of
Theorem 11.1 essentially circulated as the preprint [29] but was never published. ˙Zoł¸adek
in [106] (see also Theorem 3 of [107]) stated a similar result to Theorem 11.1, but as far
as we know the paper [106] has not been published. In any case ˙Zoł¸adek’s approach to
Theorem 11.1 is analytic, while our approach is completely algebraic.

492
J. Llibre
Statement (b) of this theorem has a corollary due to Christopher and Kooij [61] showing
that system (79) has the integrating factor R = ()p
i=1 Ci)−1, and consequently the system
is Darbouxian integrable.
The following result shows that the generic conditions of Theorem 11.1 are necessary.
THEOREM 11.2. If one of the conditions (i)–(v) of Theorem 11.1 is not satisﬁed, then the
statements of Theorem 11.1 do not hold.
We have mentioned that system (1) satisfying the ﬁve assumptions of Theorem 11.1 with
r = m+1 is Darbouxian integrable. Now we provide two examples of polynomial systems
satisfying all assumptions of Theorem 11.1 with r = m + 1 except either (ii) or (iii) and
which are not Darbouxian integrable. Until now there are very few proofs of polynomial
systems which are not Darbouxian integrable, see for instance Jouanolou [58], Moulin
Ollagnier [75–77] and [10], see Section 13.
Consider the following quadratic systems:
˙x = y(ax −by + b) + x2 + y2 −1,
˙y = bx(y −1) + ay2 −1,
(80)
which has the invariant circle C1 = x2 + y2 −1 = 0 with cofactor K1 = 2(x + ay) and the
invariant straight line C2 = y −1 = 0 with cofactor K2 = bx + ay + a. We note that C1
and C2 are tangent at the point (0,1).
THEOREM 11.3. There are values of the parameters a and b for which system (80) is not
Darbouxian integrable.
As a corollary the following result shows that there are polynomial systems with an
invariant algebraic curve whose highest order term have repeated factors such that they are
not Darbouxian integrable. Consider the following quadratic system:
˙x = (1 −b)

x2 + 2y −1

−(ax −b)(y −1) = P(x,y),
˙y = −(bx + 2ay −a)(y −1) = Q(x,y),
(81)
which has the invariant algebraic curves C1 = x2 + 2y −1 = 0 with cofactor K1 = 2[(1 −
b)x −ay + a] and C2 = y −1 = 0 with cofactor K2 = −(bx + 2ay −a). We note that the
highest order term of C1 has a repeated factor x.
COROLLARY 11.4. There exist values of the parameters a and b for which system (81) is
not Darbouxian integrable.
In the rest of the section we shall prove the ﬁrst of these stated four results, for the proof
of the others see [33].
PROOF OF THEOREM 11.1. In the proof of this theorem we will use intensively the
Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz (see for instance, [46]):

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
493
Set A,Bi ∈C[x,y] for i = 1,...,r. If A vanishes in C2 whenever the polynomials
Bi vanish simultaneously, then there exist polynomials Mi ∈C[x,y] and a nonnegative
integer n such that An = r
i=1 MiBi. In particular, if all Bi have no common zero, then
there exist polynomial Mi such that r
i=1 MiBi = 1.
In what follows if we have a polynomial A we will denotes its degree by a. If we do not
say anything we denote by Cc the homogeneous part of degree c for the polynomial C. We
shall need the following result.
LEMMA 11.5. If Cc has no repeated factors, then (Cx,Cy) = 1.
PROOF. Suppose that (Cx,Cy) ̸= 1. Then there exists a polynomial A nonconstant such
that A|Cx and A|Cy. Here A|Cx means that the polynomial A divides the polynomial Cx.
Therefore, Aa|(Cc)x and Aa|(Cc)y. By the Euler theorem for homogeneous polynomials
we have that x(Cc)x + y(Cc)y = cCc. So Aa|Cc. Since Aa, (Cc)x, (Cc)y and Cc are ho-
mogeneous polynomials of C[x,y] and Aa divides (Cc)x, (Cc)y and Cc, the linear factors
of Aa having multiplicity m, must be linear factors of Cc having multiplicity m + 1. This
last statement follows easily identifying the linear factors of the homogeneous polynomial
Cc(x,y) in two variables with the roots of the polynomial Cc(1,z) in the variable z. Hence,
Aa is a repeated factor of Cc. It is in contradiction with the assumption.
□
We ﬁrst consider the case that system (1) has a given invariant algebraic curve.
LEMMA 11.6. Assume that polynomial system (1) of degree m has an invariant algebraic
curve C = 0 of degree c, and that C satisﬁes condition (i) of Theorem 11.1.
(a) If (Cx,Cy) = 1, then system (1) has the following normal form:
˙x = AC −DCy,
˙y = BC + DCx,
(82)
where A,B and D are suitable polynomials.
(b) If C satisﬁes condition (ii) of Theorem 11.1, then system (1) has the normal form (82)
with a,b ⩽m −c and d ⩽m −c + 1. Moreover, if the highest order term Cc of C
does not have the factors x and y, then a ⩽p −c, b ⩽q −c and d ⩽min{p,q} −
c + 1.
PROOF. (a) Since there are no points at which C, Cx and Cy vanish simultaneously, from
Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz we obtain that there exist polynomials E, F and G such that
ECx + FCy + GC = 1.
(83)
As C satisﬁes the deﬁnition of invariant algebraic curve, we get from (83) that
K = (KE + GP)Cx + (KF + GQ)Cy.
Substituting K into the deﬁnition of invariant algebraic curve C = 0, we get

P −(KE + GP)C

Cx = −

Q −(KF + GQ)C

Cy.

494
J. Llibre
Since (Cx,Cy) = 1, there exists a polynomial D such that
P −(KE + GP)C = −DCy,
Q −(KF + GQ)C = DCx.
This proves that system (1) has the form (82) with A = KE + GP and Q = KF + GQ.
(b) From (a) and Lemma 11.5 we get that system (1) has the normal form (82). Without
loss of generality we can assume that p ⩽q.
We ﬁrst consider the case that Cc has neither factor x nor y. So we have (Cc,(Cc)x) = 1
and (Cc,(Cc)y) = 1, where (Cc)x denotes the derivative of Cc with respect to x. In (82)
we assume that a > p −c, otherwise the statement follows. Then d = a + 1. Moreover,
from the highest order terms of (82) we get AaCc = Da+1Cc−1
y
, where Cc−1
y
denotes the
homogeneouspart with degree c−1 of Cy. Since (Cc,Cc−1
y
) = 1, there exists a polynomial
F such that Aa = FCc−1
y
, Da+1 = FCc. In (82) we replace A by A −FCy and D by
D −FC, so the degrees of polynomials under consideration reduce by one. We continue
this process and do the same for ˙y until we reach a system of the form
˙x = AC −DCy,
˙y = BC + ECx,
(84)
with a ⩽p −c, d ⩽p −c + 1, b ⩽q −c and e ⩽q −c + 1. Since C = 0 is an invariant
algebraic curve of (84), from the deﬁnition of invariant algebraic curve we get
C(ACx + BCy) + CxCy(E −D) = KC.
This implies that there exists a polynomial R such that E −D = RC, because C with Cx
and Cy are coprime.
If e ⩾d, then r = e −c. We write BC + ECx = (B + RCx)C + DCx and denote
B + RCx again by B, then system (84) has the form (82) where A,B and D have the
required degrees.
If e < d, then r = d −c. We write AC −DCy = (A + RCy)C −ECy and denote
A + RCy again by A, then system (84) has the form (82) where A,B and E instead of D
have the required degrees. This proves the second part of (b).
Now we prove the ﬁrst part of (b). We note that even though Cc has no repeated factor,
Cc with Cc−1
x
or Cc−1
y
may have a common factor in x or y (for example C3 = x(x2 +y2),
C3 = y(x2+y2) or C4 = xy(x2+y2)). In order to avoid this difﬁculty we rotate system (1)
slightly such that Cc has no factors in x and y. Then, applying the above method to the
new system we get that the new system has a normal form (82) with the degrees of A,B
and D as those of the second part of (b).
We claim that under afﬁne changes system (82) preserves its form and the upper bound
of the polynomials, i.e., a,b ⩽m −c and d ⩽m −c + 1. Indeed, using the afﬁne change
of variables u = a1x +b1y +c1 and v = a2x +b2y +c2 with a1b2 −a2b1 ̸= 0, system (82)
becomes
˙u = (a1A + b1B)C −(a1b2 −a2b1)DCv,
˙v = (a2A + b2B)C + (a1b2 −a2b1)DCu.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
495
Hence, the claim follows. This completes the proof of (b), and consequently we have the
proof of the lemma.
□
LEMMA 11.7. Assume that C = 0 and D = 0 are different irreducible invariant algebraic
curves of system (1) of degree m, and that they satisfy conditions (i) and (iii) of Theo-
rem 11.1.
(a) If (Cx,Cy) = 1 and (Dx,Dy) = 1, then system (1) has the normal form
˙x = ACD −ECyD −FCDy,
˙y = BCD + ECxD + FCDx.
(85)
(b) If C and D satisfy conditions (ii) and (v), then system (1) has the normal form (85)
with a,b ⩽m −c −d and e,f ⩽m −c −d + 1.
PROOF. Since (C,D) = 1, the curves C and D have ﬁnitely many intersection points. By
assumption (i) at each of such points there is at least one nonzero ﬁrst derivative of both C
and D. In a similar way to the proof of the claim inside the proof of Lemma 11.6, we can
prove that under an afﬁne change of the variables, system (85) preserves its form and the
bound for the degrees of A, B, E and F. So, we rotate system (1) slightly such that all ﬁrst
derivatives of C and D are not equal to zero at the intersection points.
From the Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, there exist polynomials Mi, Ni and Ri, i = 1,2, such
that
M1C + N1D + R1Dy = 1,
M2C + N2D + R2Cy = 1.
(86)
By Lemma 11.6 we get that
P = A1C −E1Cy = G1D −F1Dy,
(87)
for some polynomials A1, E1, G1 and F1. Moreover, using the ﬁrst equation of (86) we
have F1 = SC + T D + UCy for some polynomials S, T and U. Substituting F1 into (87)
we obtain that
(A1 + SDy)C + (−G1 + T Dy)D + (−E1 + UDy)Cy = 0.
(88)
Using the second equation of (86) and (88) to eliminate Cy we get
−E1 + UDy = V C + WD,
(89)
for some polynomials V and W. Substituting (89) into (88), we have
(A1 + SDy + V Cy)C = (G1 −T Dy −WCy)D.
Since (C,D) = 1, there exists a polynomial K such that
A1 + SDy + V Cy = KD,
G1 −T Dy −WCy = KC.
(90)

496
J. Llibre
Substituting E1 of (89) and A1 of (90) into (87), then we have
P = KCD −SCDy + WCyD −UCyDy.
(91)
Similarly, we can prove that there exist some polynomials K′, S′, W ′ and U′ such that
Q = K′CD + S′CDx −W ′CxD + U′CxDx.
(92)
Since C is an invariant algebraic curve of (1), we have that PCx + QCy = KCC for
some polynomial KC. Using (91) and (92) we get
KCC = C

D(KCx + K′Cy) −SCxDy + S′CyDx

+ CxCy

D(W −W ′) −UDy + U′Dx

.
As C, Cx and Cy are coprime, there exists a polynomial Z such that
D(W −W ′) −UDy + U′Dx = ZC.
(93)
Substituting the expression DW −UDy into (91), we get
P = KCD −SCDy + W ′CyD −U′CyDx + ZCCy.
(94)
Since D = 0 is an invariant algebraic curve of system (1), we have PDx +QDy = KDD
for some polynomial KD. Using (92) and (94) we get
KDD = D

C(KDx + K′Dy) + W ′(CyDx −CxDy)

+ Dx

CDy(−S + S′) + U′(CxDy −CyDx) + ZCCy

.
As D and Dx are coprime, there exists a polynomial M such that
CDy(−S + S′) + U′(CxDy −CyDx) + ZCCy = MD.
(95)
The curves C and D are transversal implies that C, D and CxDy −CyDx have no common
zeros. From Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, there exist some polynomials M3, N3 and R3 such
that
M3C + N3D + R3(CxDy −CyDx) = 1.
(96)
Eliminating the term CxDy −CyDx from (95) and (96), we obtain that U′ = IC + JD for
some polynomials I and J. Hence, Equation (95) becomes
C

I(CxDy −CyDx) + Dy(−S + S′) + ZCy

+ D

J(CxDy −CyDx) −M

= 0.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
497
Since (C,D) = 1, there exists a polynomial G such that
M = J(CxDy −CyDx) + GC,
I(CxDy −CyDx) + Dy(−S + S′) + ZCy = GD.
Substituting ZCy −SDy and U′ into (94) we obtain that
P = (K + G)CD −(ICx + S′)CDy + (W ′ −JDx)DCy.
This means that P can be expressed in the form (91) with U = 0.
Working in a similar way, we can express Q in the form (92) with U′ = 0. Thus, (93) is
reduced to D(W −W ′) = ZC. Hence, we have W = W ′ + HC for some polynomial H .
Consequently, Z = HD. Therefore, from (95) we obtain that CDy(−S + S′) = D(M −
HCCy). Since (C,D) = 1 and (D,Dy) = 1, we have S = S′+LD for some polynomial L.
Substituting W and S into (91) we obtain that P and Q have the form (85). This proves
statement (a).
As in the proof of Lemma 11.6 we can prove that under suitable afﬁne change of vari-
ables the form of system (85) and the bound of the degrees of the polynomials A, B, E and
F are invariant. So, without loss of generality we can assume that the highest order terms
of C and D are neither divisible by x nor y.
By the assumptions, the conditions of statement (a) hold, so we get that system (1) has
the form (85). If the bounds of the degrees of A, B, E and F are not satisﬁed, we have
by (85) that
AaCcDd −EeCc−1
y
Dd −F f CcDd−1
y
= 0,
BbCcDd + EeCc−1
x
Dd + F f CcDd−1
x
= 0.
(97)
We remark that if one of the numbers a +c+d, e+c−1+d and f +c+d −1 is less than
the other two, then its corresponding term in the ﬁrst equation of (97) is equal to zero. The
same remark is applied to the second equation of (97). From the hypotheses it follows that
Cc and Cc−1
y
are coprime, and also Dd and Dd−1
y
, and Cc and Dd, respectively. Hence,
from these last two equations we obtain that there exist polynomials K and L such that
Ee = KCc, F f = LDd, and
Aa = KCc−1
y
+ LDd−1
y
,
Bb = −KCc−1
x
−LDd−1
x
.
We rewrite Equation (85) as
˙x = (A −KCy −LDy)CD −(E −KC)CyD −(F −LD)CDy,
˙y = (B + KCx + LDx)CD + (E −KC)CxD + (F −LD)CDx.
Thus, we reduce the degrees of A, B, E and F in (85) by one. We can continue this process
until the bounds are reached. This completes the proof of statement (b).

Now we consider the curves

From the assumptions we obtain that there is no points at which all the curves Ki = 0

intersect at some point. Hence, there exist polynomials U and Vi for i = 1,...,l such that

(DiCi + AiCix −GViCl+1,x −JiCl+1)Ki = 0.
(102)
It is easy to check that the expression multiplying Ki in the two summations of (102) are
divisible by Ci. Hence, there exist polynomials Li and Fi for i = 1,...,l such that
BiCi −AiCiy + GViCl+1,y −IiCl+1 = LiCi,
DiCi + AiCix −GViCl+1,x −JiCl+1 = FiCi.
(103)
So, from (102) we get that l

Moreover, we write (103) in the form

(Di −Fi)Ci + AiCix = JiCl+1 + GViCl+1,x = Qi.

J. Llibre
It is easy to see that Ci and Cl+1 are invariant algebraic curves of the system ˙x = Pi, ˙y =
Qi. So, from statement (a) of Lemma 11.7 we can obtain that
Pi = (Bi −Li)Ci −AiCiy = XiCiCl+1 −YiCiyCl+1 −NiCiCl+1,y,
Qi = (Di −Fi)Ci + AiCix = ZiCiCl+1 + YiCixCl+1 + NiCiCl+1,x.
Substituting these last two equations into (104), we obtain that system (1) has the form (98)
with the l + 1 invariant algebraic curves C1,...,Cl+1. From induction we have ﬁnished
the proof of statement (a).
The proof of statement (b) is almost identical with those of Lemma 11.7(b), so we shall
omit it here. Hence, this ends the proof of the lemma.
□
PROOF OF THEOREM 11.1. From Lemma 11.8 it follows statement (a) of Theorem 11.1.
By checking the degrees of polynomials Ai, B and D in statement (b) of Lemma 11.8 we
obtain statement (b) of Theorem 11.1.
From statement (a) of Lemma 11.8, we can rearrange system (1) such that it has the
form (98). But from statement (b) of Lemma 11.8 we must have B = 0, D = 0 and Ai = 0.
This proves statement (c) of Theorem 11.1.

12. Elementary and Liouvillian ﬁrst integrals
We now examine the effectiveness of the Darbouxian theory of integrability, i.e., what sort
of integrals does it capture. The surprising result is that in some sense it captures every
“closed form solution”. However, we clearly need to make this idea precise before we can
explain the known results. Here, we follow the paper [30].
The idea of calculating what sort of functions can arise as the result of evaluating an
indeﬁnite integral or solving a differential equation goes back to Liouville. The modern
formulation of these ideas is usually done through differential algebra. The advantage over
an analytic approach is ﬁrst that the messy details of branch points etc., is hidden com-
pletely, and second that the way is open to apply these methods to symbolic computation.
We assume that the set of functions we are interested in form a ﬁeld together with a
number of derivations. We call such an object a differential ﬁeld. The process of adding
more functions to a given set of functions is described by a tower of such ﬁelds:
F0 ⊂F1 ⊂··· ⊂Fn.
Of course, we must also specify how the derivations of F0 are extended to derivations on
each Fi.
The ﬁelds we are interested in arise by adding exponentials, logarithms or the solutions
of algebraic equations based on the previous set of functions. That is we take
Fi = F0(θ1,...,θi),
where one of the following holds:

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
501
(i) δθi = θiδg, for some g ∈Fi−1 and for each derivation δ.
(ii) δθi = g−1δg, for some g ∈Fi−1 and for each derivation δ.
(iii) θi is algebraic over Fi−1. If we have such a tower of ﬁelds, Fn is called an elemen-
tary extension of F0.
This is essentially what we mean by a function being expressible in closed form. We
call the set of all elements of a differential ﬁeld which are annihilated by all the derivations
of the ﬁeld the ﬁeld of constants. We shall always assume that the ﬁeld of constants is
algebraically closed.
THEOREM 12.1 (Liouville theorem). If an element f in a differential ﬁeld F is the deriv-
ative of an element g in an elementary extension ﬁeld G with the same ﬁeld of constants,
then we must have
f = h0 +

ci ln(hi),
where ci are constants and all the hi lie in F.
We say that our system (1) has an elementary ﬁrst integral if there is an element u in an
elementary extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld of rational functions C(x,y) with the same ﬁeld of
constants such that Du = 0. The derivations on C(x,y) are of course d/dx and d/dy.
THEOREM 12.2 (Prelle and Singer [87]). If the system (2) has an elementary ﬁrst integral,
then there is also an elementary ﬁrst integral of the form
v0 +

ci ln(vi),
where the ci are constants and the vi are algebraic functions over C(x,y).
It is known that we cannot strengthen this theorem to make all the vi rational func-
tions in x and y. By manipulating this formula and taking traces we obtain the following
corollary.
COROLLARY 12.3. In the situation above there is always an integrating factor of the
form R1/N, with R ∈C(x,y) and N an integer.
Thus the method of Darboux ﬁnds all elementary ﬁrst integrals. For a direct proof of this
corollary, see [20].
Another class of integrals we are interested in are the Liouvillian ones. Here we say that
an extension Fn is a Liouvillian extension of F0 if there is a tower of differential ﬁelds as
above which satisﬁes conditions (i), (iii) or
(ii)′ δαθi = hα for some elements hα ∈Fi−1 such that δαhβ = δβhα.
This last condition, mimics the introduction of line integrals into the class of functions.
Clearly (ii) is included in (ii)′.
This class of functions represents those functions which are obtainable “by quadratures”.
An element u of a Liouvillian extension ﬁeld of C(x,y) with the same ﬁeld of constants is
said to be a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral.

502
J. Llibre
THEOREM 12.4 (Singer [95]). If the system (2) has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral, then it has
an integrating factor of the form
e
 U dx+V dy,
Uy = Vx,
where U and V are rational functions.
It can be shown that this last expression can always be integrated to get a Darbouxian
function. More speciﬁcally,
THEOREM 12.5. Let U, V be two rational functions with
Uy = Vx,
then

U dx + V dy = w0 +

ci ln(wi),
for some constants ci and wi rational functions.
Hence we have
COROLLARY 12.6. If system (1) has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral, then there is a Darbouxian
integrating factor.
For a direct proof of this result see Pereira [85].
Thus the method of Darboux ﬁnds all Liouvillian solutions. However, there is another
surprising result.
THEOREM 12.7 (Singer [95]). Suppose that a trajectory of (1) can be described by a
function in a Liouvillian extension of C(x,y). Then either this function is a ﬁrst integral of
the system, or the function is a polynomial.
Thus a system has a Darbouxian integrating factor, or the only trajectories that can be
described by closed form solutions or quadratures are the polynomial ones.
What does the general ﬁrst integral of a system with a Darbouxian integrating factor look
like? Generically we can show that the ﬁrst integral is also Darbouxian [27], but stranger
things can happen. A reasonable conjecture which embodies all the cases which we know
is that it is a sum of a Darbouxian function and terms of the form
 R(x,y)
es(u) %
ki(u)li du,
where R, s and the ki are rational functions. Several examples of these have been given by
˙Zoł¸adek [106].

13. Liouvillian ﬁrst integrals for the planar Lotka–Volterra system
The aim of this section is to present the complete classiﬁcation of the Liouvillian ﬁrst
integrals for the quadratic Lotka–Volterra systems in C2:
˙x = x(ax + by + c),
˙y = y(Ax + By + C).
(106)
We say that system (106) has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral if it has a ﬁrst integral or an
integrating factor given by a Darbouxian function, see for more details Section 12 or
Singer [95]. We note that our Darbouxian theory of integrability takes into account the
invariant algebraic curves and their multiplicity through the exponential factors, see Sec-
tion 1.5 or for more details [34]. We emphasize that a complete characterization of Liou-
villian integrable polynomial differential systems has been made for very few families of
differential systems. We follows the paper [10].
As we shall see, systems (106) can be formulated as the following quadratic homoge-
neous Lotka–Volterra systems in C3:
˙x = x(b −B)y + cz,
˙y = y

(A −a)x + Cz

,
˙z = −z(ax + By).
(107)
Several authors and mainly Moulin Ollagnier [77] have studied the Liouvillian ﬁrst inte-
grals of the system
˙x = x(ωCy + z) = xΦx,
˙y = y(x + ωAz) = yΦy,
˙z = z(ωBx + y) = zΦz.
(108)
In fact, these homogeneous Lotka–Volterra systems in C3 can be thought as the planar
projective version of the following planar Lotka–Volterra systems in C2:
˙x = x−ωBx + (ωC −1)y + 1,
˙y = y

(1 −ωB)x −y + ωA

.
(109)
For more details between the afﬁne and the projective version of a planar polynomial vector
ﬁeld, see Section 6, or for instance [77] or [70].
We note that if c(a −A)B ̸= 0, then system (106) becomes system (109) with the fol-
lowing rescaling of the variables:
(x,y,t) →

c
A −a x,−c
B y, 1
c t

(110)

where
ωA = C
c ,
ωB =

a −A,
ωC = B −b

.
(111)
The Darbouxian theory of integrability says that if a planar polynomial differential sys-
tem of degree m = 2 has at least m(m + 1)/2 = 3 invariant algebraic curves or exponential
factors, then the system has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral (see again Section 12 or Singer [95]).
This result will play a main role in the classiﬁcation of all Liouvillian ﬁrst integrals of sys-
tems (106).
We want to show that the Darbouxian theory of integrability is one of the best meth-
ods for ﬁnding ﬁrst integrals of polynomial ordinary differential equations. For showing
this we choose the 2-dimensional Lotka–Volterra systems (106) as paradigmatic systems
for the study of the integrability, and we complete the classiﬁcation of their Liouvillian
ﬁrst integrals. This model, introduced by Lotka [72] and Volterra [100], appears in ecol-
ogy where it models two species in competition, and it has been widely used in applied
mathematics, in chemistry and in a large variety of problems in physics.
Moulin Ollagnier in [77] classiﬁed the irreducible systems (108) (and his results pro-
vide almost the classiﬁcation of the nonirreducible ones) having a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral.
In the paper [10] the authors, ﬁrst, provide a new tool for studying the existence of Li-
ouvillian ﬁrst integrals, and second they use this tool for completing the classiﬁcation of
systems (107).
System (107) is called irreducible if the 1-form
ω = (Φz −Φy)yzdx + (Φx −Φz)zx dy + (Φy −Φx)xy dz
= −(Ax + By + Cz)yzdx + (ax + by + cz)zx dy
+ (A −a)x + (B −b)y + (C −c)zxy dz
has no nontrivial common factor in its three components, for more details see [77].
Systems (109) always have two invariant algebraic curves x = 0 and y = 0. From the
Darbouxian theory of integrability (see Theorem 2.1), it is known that if they have another
invariant algebraic curve or an exponential factor, then the system has a Liouvillian ﬁrst in-
tegral. We remark that almost all the Liouvillian integrable systems (109) given by Moulin
Ollagnier in [77] have a third invariant algebraic curve. For system (107) it is shown in [10]
that in seven of the new Liouvillian integrable cases the integrability is due to the existence
of an exponential factor.
We associate to a given 3-dimensional Lotka–Volterra system (108) two if ωAωB ×
ωC = 0, or ﬁve if ωAωBωC ̸= 0, equivalent 3-dimensional Lotka–Volterra systems. The
ﬁrst two are obtained doing circular permutation of the variables x,y,z and of the parame-
ters ωA,ωB,ωC; i.e.,
(x,y,z,ωA,ωB,ωC) →(y,z,x,ωB,ωC,ωA);
and the remainder three systems are obtained doing the transformation
(x,y,z,ωA,ωB,ωC) →(ωBx,ωAz,ωCy,1/ωC,1/ωB,1/ωA),

and the two new transformations obtained from this one doing the above circular permuta-
tions. Sometimes the conjugated systems to these previous ones are different, obtaining in
all 12 related systems. We say that all these Lotka–Volterra systems are E equivalent. All
the results of this paper are stated modulo these E equivalences. Of course, the analogous
E equivalences exist for 2-dimensional Lotka–Voterra systems (109).
The main results of [77] and [10] are the following two theorems, respectively.
THEOREM 13.1. Consider an irreducible system (109). Then the following statements are
equivalent.
(a) System (109) has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral.
(b) System (109) has an invariant algebraic curve f = 0 different from x = 0 and y = 0.
(c) The triple [ωA,ωB,ωC] of parameters of system (109) falls, up to E equivalences,
in one of the cases of the following list.
We introduce the following parameters
p = −ωA −1
ωB ,
q = −ωB −1
ωC ,
r = −ωC −1
ωA.
The numbers p, q and r are related with the Kowalevskaya exponents of system (108), see
[52] for more details.
In the ﬁrst two cases ωA, ωB and ωC are related by a unique condition and f has
degree 1.
1. ωAωBωC + 1 = 0, f = x −ωCy + ωAωC.
2. ωB = 1 where ωC = 0 is possible, f = y −ωA.
Case 2 is formed by three E equivalent systems. The other two are: ωC = 1 where
ωA = 0 is possible, f = 1 −ωBx; and ωA = 1 where ωB = 0 is possible, f = x −ωCy.
In the next two cases ωA, ωB and ωC are related by two conditions and f has de-
gree 2.
3. p = 1, q = 1, consequently ωAωBωC = 1 and r = 1; f = ωA2(ωBx −1)2 −
2ωA(ωBx + 1)y + y2.
4. ωA = 2, q = 1; f = (x −ωCy)2 −2ωC2y.
Case 4 is formed by ﬁve other E equivalent systems, namely:
ωB = 2, r = 1, f = (y −ωA)2 −2ωA2x;
ωC = 2, p = 1, f = (1 −ωBx)2 −2ωB2xy;
ωC = 1/2, p = 1, f = (Bx −1)2 −2yωC/ωA;
ωA = 1/2, q = 1, f = (ωCy −x)2 −2xωA/ωB;
ωB = 1/2, r = 1, f = (ωA −y)2 −2xyωB/ωC.
There is a ﬁnite number of isolated triples of complex numbers providing an invariant
algebraic curve of system (21) with degree 3, 4 or 6. Here i stands for the square root of −1
and j = (−1 + i
√
3)/2 is a third root of 1. Firstly, these cases were found in [53] using
the so-called Painlevé analysis, see [52].
5. [ωA,ωB,ωC] = [(j −1)/3,j −1,j] or equivalently [p,q,r] = [1,2,2], here

7. [ωA,ωB,ωC] = [−1 + j,(−2 + j)/7,(−4 + j)/3] or equivalently [p,q,r] =
[4,1,2], here (ωAωBωC)3 = 1; f = 6(−397 −683j)y5 + 405(8 + 5j)x4 +
540(19 + 18j)x3 + 135(−323 + 37j)y2 + 45(−360 −323j)y4 + 162(3 + j)x5 +

60(−683 −286j)y3 + 405(39 + 55j)x2.
Case 5 is formed by six E equivalent systems which can be obtained doing circular
permutations to [ωA,ωB,ωC] and to [1/ωC,1/ωB,1/ωA]. Cases 6 and 7 are formed by
twelve E equivalent systems which are obtained as in Case 5, and additionally conjugating
all the parameters.
There are some isolated triples of rational numbers providing an irreducible invariant
algebraic curve of degree 3, 4 or 6.

easy to provide the explicit expression of f .
Cases 8 to 24 are formed by six E equivalent systems, with the exception of Case 16
which is formed by only two E equivalent systems.
From (110) and (111) it follows that systems (106) studied by Moulin Ollagnier are
those which satisfy a(B −b)C ̸= 0 and c(a −A)B ̸= 0. Therefore, it remains to deter-
mine:
(i) Which are the Liouvillian integrable systems (106) with a(B −b)C = 0 and c(a −
A)B ̸= 0?
(ii) Which are the Liouvillian integrable systems (106) that cannot be written into the
form (109)? Or equivalently, what are the Liouvillian integrable systems (106) hav-
ing c(a −A)B = 0?
Now we shall determine the normal forms of the Lotka–Volterra systems (106) which can
have a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral and which have not been studied by Moulin Ollagnier.
According with the previous paragraph those systems must be systems (106) satisfy-
ing
(i) either a(B −b)C = 0 and c(a −A)B ̸= 0,
(ii) or c(a −A)B = 0.
In fact, case (ii) can be subdivided into the following two subcases:
(ii.1) a(B −b)C ̸= 0 and c(a −A)B = 0,
(ii.2) a(B −b)C = 0 and c(a −A)B = 0.
Doing the change of variables (x,y) →(y,x) it is immediate to check that the expres-
sions a(B −b)C and c(a −A)B are interchanged. Therefore, this change of variables
interchanges cases (i) and (ii.1). In other words, case (i) is contained in case (ii). Finally,
again due to the change of variables (x,y) →(y,x) to study case (ii) is equivalent to study
the case a(B −b)C = 0.
In the next proposition we reduce the study of systems (106) with a(B −b)C = 0 to
analyze the Liouvillian integrability of some subclasses of systems (106).
PROPOSITION 13.2. To complete the study of the Liouvillian integrable Lotka–Volterra
systems (106) it is sufﬁcient to consider the Liouvillian integrability of the following sub-
classes of systems (106):

J. Llibre
(lv1)
˙x = cx,
˙y = y(Ax + By + C).
(lv2)
˙x = x(y + c),
˙y = y(By + 1).
(lv3)
˙x = xy,
˙y = y(x + By + 1).
(lv4)
˙x = xy,
˙y = y(Ax + By).
(lv5)
˙x = x(ax + by + c),
˙y = By2.
(lv6)
˙x = x(y + 1),
˙y = y(x + By).
(lv7)
˙x = x(ax + by + c),
˙y = xy.
(lv8)
˙x = x(ax + by),
˙y = y(x + y).
(lv9)
˙x = x(ax + by + 1),
˙y = y(x + y).
(lv10)
˙x = x(x + c),
˙y = y(Ax + 1)
with cA = 0.
(lv11)
˙x = x(x + y + 1),
˙y = y(Ax + y + 1).
PROOF. We divide the class of systems (106) satisfying a(B −b)C = 0 into the following
four subclasses.
Case 1: a = 0, C ̸= 0, B −b arbitrary. Then, doing the rescaling (x,y,t) →
(αx,βy,t/C) in system (106) we obtain the system
˙x = x
bβ
C y + c
C

,
˙y = y
Aα
C x + Bβ
C y + 1

.
(112)
Now we consider the following three subcases:
(1.1) b = 0. Then system (106) is contained into system (lv1) after a redeﬁnition of the
parameters.
(1.2) b ̸= 0, A = 0. Taking β = C/b system (112) becomes ˙x = x(y + c/C), ˙y =
y(By/b + 1); i.e., system (lv2) after a redeﬁnition of the parameters.
(1.3) bA ̸= 0. Taking α = C/A and β = C/b system (112) becomes ˙x = x(y + c/C),
˙y = y(x + By/b + 1); or equivalently ˙x = x(y + c), ˙y = y(x + By + 1). Now, if
c ̸= 0, then doing the changes of variables x = −c/Y, y = cX/Y and the rescaling
of the independent variable t →−Yt/c, we get system (lv9). If c = 0, then we
obtain system (lv3).
Case 2: a = 0, C = 0, B −b arbitrary. Then, doing the rescaling (x,y,t) →(αx,βy,γ t)
in system (106) we obtain the system
˙x = x(bβγy + cγ ),
˙y = y(Aαγ x + Bβγy).
(113)
We deal with the following three subcases:
(2.1) b = 0. We obtain a particular case of system (lv1).
(2.2) b ̸= 0, c = 0. Taking β = 1/b and γ = 1 in (113) we get system (lv4).
(2.3) bc ̸= 0. Taking β = c/b and γ = 1/c in (113) we get a particular case of sys-
tem (lv5) if A = 0. Additionally, if A ̸= 0 taking α = c/A we obtain system (lv6).
Case 3: a ̸= 0, C = 0, B −b arbitrary. Then, doing the rescaling (x,y,t) →(αx,βy,γ t)
in system (1) we obtain the system
˙x = x(aαγ x + bβγy + cγ ),
˙y = y(Aαγ x + Bβγy).
We consider four subcases:

(3.1) A = 0. Then we obtain system (lv5).
(3.2) A ̸= 0, B = 0. Taking αγ = 1/A, we get system (lv7).
(3.3) AB ̸= 0, c = 0. Taking αγ = 1/A and βγ = 1/B, we have system (lv8).
(3.4) ABc ̸= 0. Taking γ = 1/c, α = c/A and β = c/B, we obtain system (lv9).
Case 4: a ̸= 0, C ̸= 0, B −b = 0. Then, doing the rescaling (x,y,t) →(Cx/a,βy,t/C)
in system (106) we obtain the system

(114)
We distinguish the two subcases:
(4.1) b = 0. Then we obtain system ˙x = x(x +c), ˙y = y(Ax +1). If cA ̸= 0, then doing
the change of variables x = Y, y = X, and a rescaling of the independent variable
this system becomes system (lv2). If cA = 0, then we get system (lv10).
(4.2) b ̸= 0. Taking β = C/b system (114) goes over to system ˙x = x(x + y + c),
˙y = y(Ax + y + 1). If c ̸= 1 and A ̸= 1, then doing the change of variables x =
(1−c)Y/((A−1)X), y = (1−c)/X, and the rescaling of the independent variable
t →Xt/(c−1), we obtain system (lv9). If c ̸= 1 and A = 1, then doing the change
of variables x = 1/X, y = Y/X, and the rescaling of the independent variable
t →Xt/(1 −c), we obtain system (lv7). If c = 1, we get system (lv11).
□
In the next proposition we characterize which systems (lvi), for i = 1,...,11, are irre-
ducible.
PROPOSITION 13.3. The following statements hold.
(a) The next systems are irreducible: (lv1) with c(A2 + B2)(B2 + C2) ̸= 0, (lv2) with
c(B −1)(cB −1) ̸= 0, (lv5) with (a2 + c2)(a2 + (B −b)2) ̸= 0, (lv6) with B ̸= 0,
(lv9) with a ̸= 1 or b ̸= 1, (lv10) with c2 + (A −1)2 ̸= 0, and (lv11).
(b) Systems (lv1)–(lv11) which do not appear in (a) are reducible.
PROOF. The proposition follows easily from the deﬁnition of irreducible system.
□
From Theorem 2.1 and Propositions 13.2 and 13.3 we obtain the following new Liouvil-
lian integrable Lotka–Volterra systems (106). These new cases are easy to obtain, many of
them come from [9]. The difﬁcult problem will be to prove that the Lotka–Volterra systems
of Proposition 13.2 which not appear in the following list are not Liouvillian integrable.
25. System (lv1) has the exponential factor exp(x) if c ̸= 0; and it has the function x as
a ﬁrst integral if c = 0.
26. System (lv2) has the invariant straight line By +1 = 0 if B ̸= 0, and the exponential
factor exp(y) if B = 0.
27. System (lv3) has the integrating factor 1/(xB+1y).
28. System (lv4) has the straight line y = 0 formed by singular points. So, in
R2 \ {y = 0} the system has the ﬁrst integral of the linear system ˙x = x, ˙y =
Ax + By.

510
J. Llibre
29. System (lv5) has the exponential factor exp(1/y) if B ̸= 0, and the function y is a
ﬁrst integral if B = 0.
30. System (lv6) has the integrating factor 1/(xy) if B = 0.
31. System (lv7) has the straight line x = 0 formed by singular points. So, in
R2 \ {x = 0} the system has the ﬁrst integral of the linear system ˙x = ax + by + c,
˙y = y.
32. System (lv8) is a quadratic homogeneous system and consequently it is integrable.
In fact, if a ̸= 1 or b ̸= 1, then the function 1/(xy((a −1)x + (b −1)y)) is an
integrating factor of the system. If a = b = 1 then the straight line x + y = 0 is
formed by singular points. So, in R2 \ {x + y = 0} the system has the ﬁrst integral
of the linear system ˙x = x, ˙y = y.
33. System (lv9) for b = 0 has the invariant straight line ax + 1 = 0 if a ̸= 0, and the
exponential factor exp(x) if a = 0. If a = 1 it has the integrating factor 1/(xy2).
If (a,b) = (1/2,−1) then the system has the invariant algebraic curve xy + 1 +
x + x2/4 = 0. If (a,b) = (1/2,1/2) then the system has the exponential factor
exp((2 + x)2/y).
34. System (lv10) has the invariant straight line x + c = 0 if c ̸= 0, and the exponential
factor exp(1/x) if c = 0.
35. System (lv11) for A = 1 has the straight line x + y + 1 = 0 formed by singular
points. So, in R2 \ {x + y + 1 = 0} the system has the ﬁrst integral of the linear
system ˙x = x, ˙y = y. If A ̸= 1 it has the exponential factor exp(y/x).
We note that the exponential factors which appear in cases 33, 34 and 35 (respectively
29) correspond to the fact that the geometric multiplicity of the invariant algebraic curve
x = 0 (respectively y = 0) is higher than 1. The exponential factors of the cases 25,
26 and 33 correspond to the fact that the inﬁnite straight line has geometric multiplicity
higher than 1 as invariant algebraic curve of the projectivized vector ﬁeld. For more details
see [34].
In order to show that there are no additional Lotka–Volterra systems to those described
in the list which are Liouvillian integrable (modulo the corresponding equivalencies or the
reductions to the normal forms of Proposition 13.2), we must prove that the following two
systems
(lv6)
with B ̸= 0.
(lv9)
with b ̸= 0, a ̸= 1 and (a,b) /∈

(1/2,−1),(1/2,1/2)

have no Liouvillian ﬁrst integrals. We shall prove this for the system (lv6), similarly can
be made for the system (lv9), for more details see [10]. Then the classiﬁcation of the
Liouvillian integrable Lotka–Volterra systems is completed by the following result.
THEOREM 13.4. The following statements hold.
(a) After Theorem 13.1 to complete the study of the Liouvillian integrable Lotka–
Volterra systems (106) it is sufﬁcient to consider the Liouvillian integrability of the
eleven subclasses (lvi) of systems (106) for i = 1,...,11.
(b) System (lvi) for i = 1,...,11 has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral if and only if it is one of
the cases described from cases 25 to 35.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
511
Of course, statement (a) is equivalent to Proposition 13.2.
Now in order to show how to prove Theorem 13.4 we shall study system (lv6) with
B ̸= 0. Systems (lv9) with b ̸= 0, a ̸= 1 and (a,b) /∈{(1/2,−1), (1/2,1/2)} can be proved
using similar arguments, for more details see [10].
PROPOSITION 13.5. System (lv6) with B ̸= 0 has no Liouvillian ﬁrst integrals.
PROOF. From Singer results (see Section 12) we know that if system (lv6) with B ̸= 0
(simply (lv6) in what follows) has a Liouvillian ﬁrst integral, then it has an integrating
factor of the form (14) where the fi = 0 are invariant algebraic curves and the Fj are
exponential factors. Now we shall prove that the unique irreducible invariant algebraic
curves of (lv6) are x = 0 and y = 0. So from Proposition 1.10, it follows that the unique
invariant algebraic curves of (lv6) are x = 0 and y = 0. Additionally, we shall also prove
that (lv6) has no exponential factors. Since B ̸= 0 a linear combination of the cofactors
of x = 0 and y = 0 cannot be equal to minus the divergence of system (lv6). Then, by
Theorem 2.1 it follows that system (lv6) has no integrating factors of the form (14) with
f1 = x and f2 = y.
We start by proving that system (lv6) has no irreducible invariant algebraic curves dif-
ferent from x = 0 and y = 0. Suppose that f = 0 is an irreducible invariant algebraic curve
of (lv6) different from x = 0 and y = 0. Then f satisﬁes (9), i.e.,
x(y + 1)∂f
∂x + y(x + By)∂f
∂y = (k0 + k1x + k2y)f,
(115)
where k0 + k1x + k2y is the cofactor of f = 0.
Since f is a polynomial we can write
f = f0(x) + f1(x)y + ··· + fm(x)ym
= ωf0(y) + ωf1(y)x + ··· + ωfn(y)xn,
(116)
with f0(x), fm(x), ωf0(y) and ωfn(y) nonzero. We note that f (x,y) cannot be indepen-
dent on x or y, otherwise it factorizes and its factors would correspond to invariant straight
lines (real or complex) which do not exist.
Taking y = 0 in (115) we get the following ordinary differential equation
xf ′
0(x) = (k0 + k1x)f0(x).
Its general solution is f0(x) = Dxk0 exp(k1x), where D is a constant which cannot be zero,
otherwise y would be a factor of f in contradiction with the fact that f is irreducible and
different from y. Since f0(x) is a polynomial, we get that k1 = 0 and k0 ∈Z+, where Z+
denotes the nonnegative integers.
Now, taking x = 0 in (115) and since B ̸= 0, we get the following ordinary differential
equation
By2ωf ′
0(y) = (k0 + k2y)ωf0(y).

512
J. Llibre
Its general solution is ωf0(y) = Eyk2/B exp(−k0/(By)), where E is a constant which can-
not be zero, otherwise x would be a factor of f in contradiction with the fact that f is
irreducible and different from x. Since ωf0(y) must be a polynomial, we get that k0 = 0,
and that k2/B ∈Z+.
In short, we have f0(x) = D and ωf0(y) = Eyk2/B. Hence, if k2 ̸= 0 then f0(x) = 0,
because f (0,0) = 0. Therefore, y is a factor of f , a contradiction because f is irreducible
and different from y. Consequently, we must have that k2 = 0 and f0(x) = ωf0(y) =
D = E. Since the cofactor of f = 0 is zero, it follows that if there is another irreducible
algebraic invariant curve f = 0 different from x = 0 and y = 0, then the polynomial f is
a ﬁrst integral of system (lv6).
Suppose that f is an irreducible polynomial ﬁrst integral of system (lv6) of minimum
degree. Then H = f −f (0,0) is another polynomial ﬁrst integral such that H(0,0) = 0
and consequently, H = xlykg with l and k positive integers, g coprime with x and y, and
the polynomial g cannot be constant because it is easy to check that system (lv6) has no ﬁrst
integrals of the form xlyk. Since H = 0 is formed by invariant algebraic curves, it follows
that g = 0 is formed by invariant algebraic curves different from x = 0 and y = 0. Hence,
there exists an irreducible invariant algebraic curve h = 0 with h dividing to g (eventually
h can be equal to g) different from x = 0 and y = 0, and having degree smaller than the
degree of f . Since h also is an irreducible polynomial ﬁrst integral (because its cofactor
is zero) and its degree is smaller than the degree of f , we have a contradiction with the
minimality of the degree of f as a polynomial ﬁrst integral of system (lv6). In short, we
have proved that there are no irreducible invariant algebraic curves of system (lv6) different
from x = 0 and y = 0.
Now we shall prove that system (lv6) has no exponential factors. According to Proposi-
tion 1.12, if system (lv6) has exponential factors, then they must be of the form
exp(h),
exph/xl,
exph/yk,
exph/xlyk,
(117)
where h is a polynomial, and l and k are positive integers.
The singular points of system (lv6) are (0,0) and (B,−1). Let k0 + k1x + k2y be a
cofactor of an exponential factor of system (lv6). From the deﬁnition of exponential factor,
the left-hand side of equality (13) is zero on the singular point (B,−1), then from the
right-hand side we obtain that k2 = k0 + Bk1. So, a cofactor of any exponential factor of
system (lv6) can be written as k0 + k1x + (k0 + Bk1)y.
First we shall see that there are no exponential factors of the form exp(h/xl). Without
loss of generality we can assume that h and x are coprime, and l is positive.
Suppose that exp(h/xl) is an exponential factor of system (lv6). Then it satisﬁes (13),
i.e.,
x(y + 1)x∂h/∂x −lh
xl+1
+ y(x + By)∂h/∂y
xl
= k0 + k1x + (k0 + Bk1)y,

where we have simpliﬁed the common factor exp(h/xl). This last equality can be written
as


x ∂h
∂x −lh

+ y(x + By)∂h
∂y = k0 + k1x + (k0 + Bk1)yxl.
(118)
Since h is a polynomial we can write
h = ωh0(y) + ωh1(y)x + ωh2(y)x2 + ···.
(119)
Taking x = 0 in (118) and since B ̸= 0, we get the following ordinary differential equation
−(y + 1)lωh0(y) + By2ωh′
0(y) = 0.
Its general solution is ωh0(y) = Dyl/B exp(−l/(By)) where D is a nonzero constant, oth-
erwise x would be a factor of h. The fact that D ̸= 0 gives a contradiction, because ωh0(y)
must be a polynomial and l is a positive integer. Hence, there are no exponential factors of
the form exp(h/xl).
We shall prove that there are no exponential factors of the form exp(h). Suppose that
exp(h) is an exponential factor of system (lv6). Then it satisﬁes (13), i.e.,
x(y + 1)∂h
∂x + y(x + By)∂h
∂y = k0 + k1x + (k0 + Bk1)y,
where we have simpliﬁed the common factor exp(h). Taking (x,y) = (0,0) in this equality,
it follows that k0 = 0. So, we can write it as follows
x(y + 1)∂h
∂x + y(x + By)∂h
∂y = k1(x + By).
(120)
Now, taking x = 0 in (120) we obtain the following ordinary differential equation
yωh′
0(y) = k1,
here we have used once more that B ̸= 0. Its general solution is ωh0(y) = E + k1 logy,
where E is a nonzero constant. Since ωh0(y) is a polynomial, we get that k1 = 0. However
k1 cannot be zero, otherwise h will be a polynomial ﬁrst integral, in contradiction with
the fact that the unique irreducible invariant algebraic curves are x = 0 and y = 0. Hence,
there are no exponential factors of the form exp(h).
Suppose that exp(h/yk) is an exponential factor of system (lv6). Without loss of gen-
erality we can assume that h and y are coprime, and k is positive. Then it satisﬁes (13),
i.e.,
x(y + 1)∂h

where we have simpliﬁed the common factor exp(h/yk) and multiplied by yk. Since h is a
polynomial we can write
h = h0(x) + h1(x)y + h2(x)y2 + ···.
(122)
Taking y = 0 in Equation (121) we get the following ordinary differential equation
h′
0(x) −kh0(x) = 0.
Its general solution is h0(x) = D exp(kx) where D is a nonzero constant, otherwise y
would be a factor of h. The fact that D ̸= 0 gives a contradiction, because h0(x) must be a
polynomial and k is a positive integer. Hence, there are no exponential factors of the form
exp(h/yk).
We shall prove now that there are no exponential factors of the form exp(h/(xlyk)) with
l and k positive integers. Without loss of generality we can assume that h, x and y are
coprime. Then this exponential factor must satisfy (13), i.e.,

Its general solution is h0(x) = Dxl exp(kx) where D is a nonzero constant, otherwise y
would be a factor of h. The fact that D ̸= 0 gives a contradiction, because h0(x) must be a
polynomial and k is a positive integer. Hence, there are no exponential factors of the form
exp(h/(xlyk)). This completes the proof of the proposition.

14. On the integrability of two-dimensional ﬂows
By deﬁnition a planar differential system is
dx
dt = x′ = P(x,y),
dy
dt = y′ = Q(x,y),
(123)
where P and Q are Cr maps with r ⩾1 from an open subset U of R2 to R. We say that U
is the domain of deﬁnition of the differential system (123), and that
X = P ∂
∂x + Q ∂
∂y
(124)
is the Cr vector ﬁeld deﬁned on U associated to differential system (123).

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
515
A Ck function H :U →R with k ⩾0 is a strong ﬁrst integral of the differential sys-
tem (123) deﬁned in U if H is constant on each solution of this system, and H is non-
constant on any open subset of U. Here k ⩾0 means that k = 0,1,2,...,∞,ω. More
precisely, k = 0 means that H is continuous, k = 1,2,...,∞means that H is Ck, k = ω
means that H is analytic. If k ⩾1 then the previous deﬁnition of integrability implies that
the derivative of H following the direction of the vector ﬁeld X is zero; i.e., if XH = 0
on U.
This deﬁnition of strong ﬁrst integral is the usual deﬁnition of ﬁrst integral which appears
in the major part of books on differential equations (see for instance [3] and [96]). With
this deﬁnition the linear differential system
x′ = x,
y′ = y,
(125)
deﬁned on R2 has no strong ﬁrst integrals. This is due to the fact that every strong ﬁrst in-
tegral of system (125) must be a continuous function on R2 that must take a constant value
on each straight line through the origin, because these straight lines are formed by orbits of
the system. Hence it must be constant on the whole R2, consequently there are no strong
ﬁrst integrals for system (125). By using this argument it follows that if system (123) has
a strong ﬁrst integral, then it cannot have nodes, foci, center–foci, singular points having
some parabolic or elliptic sectors, limit cycles and separatrix cycles that be the α- or ω-
limit set of some orbit of the system (see [96] for deﬁnitions). Since we do not like that
differential systems so easy as system (125) have no ﬁrst integrals, we will introduce the
notion of weak ﬁrst integral.
Let Σ be a set of orbits of system (123) such that U \ Σ is open. We say that a Ck
function H :U \ Σ →R with k ⩾0 is a weak ﬁrst integral of the differential system (1.9)
deﬁned in U if H is constant on each solution of system (123) contained in U \ Σ, and
H is nonconstant on any open subset of U \ Σ. If k ⩾1 this deﬁnition implies that the
derivative of H following the direction of the vector ﬁeld X is zero on U \ Σ.
We remark that the unique difference between the notions of strong and weak ﬁrst inte-
gral is that a weak ﬁrst integral does not need to be deﬁned in the whole domain of deﬁn-
ition U of the differential system (123). This difference has been noted by many authors.
Thus, the ﬁrst integrals computed by Darboux [38] in 1878 for polynomial differential
systems possessing sufﬁcient algebraic solutions are in general weak ﬁrst integrals. If we
study the integrability of the linear differential systems
dx
dt = x′ = ax + by,
dy
dt = y′ = cx + dy,
(126)
with ad −bc ̸= 0 (nondegenerate), then with the notion of strong ﬁrst integral only the
centers and the saddles are integrable, but with the notion of weak ﬁrst integral all linear
systems (126) are integrable. In particular we show that system (125) has the weak ﬁrst
integral H :R2 \ {0} →R where H(x,y) = xy/(x2 + y2).
We claim that the notion of weak ﬁrst integral is the natural notion of integrability for
two-dimensional differential systems instead of the more usual notion of strong ﬁrst inte-
gral. Theorem 14.1 will conﬁrm this claim. In order to present it we need some preliminary
deﬁnitions and results. In this section we follow the papers [19,63].

J. Llibre
For differential system (123) the following three properties are well known, see for more
details [96].
(a) (Existence and uniqueness of maximal solutions for a differential system) For all
p ∈U there exists an open interval Ip of the real line where it is deﬁned the unique
maximal solution ϕp :Ip →U of (123) such that ϕp(0) = p.
(b) (Group property) If q = ϕp(t) and t ∈Ip, then Iq = Ip −t = {r −t: r ∈Ip} and
ϕq(s) = ϕp(t + s) for all s ∈Iq.
(c) (Differentiability with respect to initial conditions) The set D = {(t,p): p ∈U,t ∈
Ip} is open in R3 and the map ϕ :D →U deﬁned by ϕ(t,p) = ϕp(t) is Cr.
The map ϕ :D →U is a local ﬂow of class Cr with r ⩾1 on U associated to sys-
tem (123), which veriﬁes
(i) ϕ(0,p) = p for all p ∈U;
(ii) ϕ(t,ϕ(s,p)) = ϕ(t + s,p) for all p ∈U, and all s and t such that s,t + s ∈Ip;
(iii) ϕp(−t) = ϕ−1
p (t) for all p ∈U such that t,−t ∈Ip.
Let ϕ be a local ﬂow on the two-dimensional manifold M, and let Σ be a subset of M
formed by orbits of ϕ such that M \ Σ is open. We say that a Ck function H :M \ Σ →R
with k ⩾0 is a weak ﬁrst integral of ϕ if H ◦ϕp is constant for each p ∈M \ Σ and H is
not constant on any open subset of M \ Σ. Of course, when the local ﬂow is the local ﬂow
associated to a Cr differential system (123) with r ⩾1, the above deﬁnition of weak ﬁrst
integral for system (123) and the deﬁnition of weak ﬁrst integral for its associated local
ﬂow coincide.
In this paper we consider Cr local ﬂows with r ⩾0 on an arbitrary two-dimensional
manifold M (separable metric, but not necessarily compact nor orientable and possibly
with boundary).Of course, when r = 0 the ﬂow is only continuous. Two such ﬂows, (M,ϕ)
and (M′,ϕ′), are Ck-equivalent with k ⩾0 if there is a Ck diffeomorphism of M onto M′
which takes orbits of ϕ onto orbits of ϕ′ preserving sense (but not necessarily the parame-
trization). Of course, a C0 diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism.
Let ϕ be a Cr local ﬂow with r ⩾0 on the two-dimensional manifold M. We call (M,ϕ)
Ck-parallel if it is Ck-equivalent to one of the following ﬂows:
(1) R2 with the ﬂow deﬁned by x′ = 1, y′ = 0;
(2) R2 \ {0} with the ﬂow deﬁned (in polar coordinates) by r′ = 0, θ′ = 1;
(3) R2 \ {0} with the ﬂow deﬁned by r′ = r, θ′ = 0;
(4) S1 × S1 with rational ﬂow (e.g., the ﬂow induced by (123) above under the usual
covering map; note in particular that all rational ﬂows on the torus are equivalent).
We call these ﬂows as strip, annular, spiral, and toral, respectively.
Let p ∈M. We denote by γ (p) the orbit of the ﬂow ϕ on M through p, more precisely
γ (p) = {ϕp(t): t ∈Ip}. The positive half-orbit of p ∈M is γ +(p) = {ϕp(t): t ∈Ip,t ⩾
0}. In a similar way it is deﬁned the negative half-orbit γ −(p) of p ∈M.
We deﬁne the α-limit and the ω-limit of p as (γ ±(p)) and let
α(p) = cl

γ −(p)

−γ −(p),
ω(p) = cl

γ +(p)

−γ +(p),
respectively. Here, as usual, cl denotes the closure.
Let γ (p) be an orbit of the ﬂow ϕ deﬁned on M. A parallel neighborhood of the orbit
γ (p) is an open neighborhood N of γ (p) such that (N,ϕ) is Ck-equivalent to a parallel
ﬂow for some k ⩾0.

Integrability of polynomial differential systems

We say that γ (p) is a separatrix of ϕ if γ (p) is not contained in a parallel neighbor-
hood N satisfying the following two assumptions:
(1) for any q ∈N, α(q) = α(p) and ω(q) = ω(p), and
(2) cl(N) \ N consists of α(p), ω(p) and exactly two orbits γ (a), γ (b) of ϕ, with
α(a) = α(p) = α(b) and ω(a) = ω(p) = ω(b).
We denote by Σ the union of all separatrices of ϕ. Then Σ is a closed invariant subset
of M. A component of the complement of Σ in M, with the restricted ﬂow, is called a
canonical region of ϕ.
The main result of this section is the following one.
THEOREM 14.1. Let ϕ be a Cr ﬂow on a two-dimensional manifold M for some r ∈
{0,1,...,∞,ω}, and let Σ be the union of all separatrices of φ. Then
(1) Every canonical region of (M,ϕ) is Cr parallel.
(2) The ﬂow ϕ restricted to every canonical region has a Cr (respectively C∞, Cω) ﬁrst
integral for r ∈N (respectively r = ∞,ω).
Statement (1) in the case C0 parallel was proved by Markus [74] and Neumann [81], the
rest of the theorem is proved in [63]. See [19] for a version C0 of statement (2). Later on,
here we will provide a proof of Theorem 14.1 for the C0 version.
In the next two theorems we use the fact that any analytic vector ﬁeld on S2 has ﬁnitely
many limit cycles as it was proved by Il’Yashenko [57] and Écalle [39]. The following two
results improve Theorem 14.1 for planar polynomial differential systems. For a proof of
them see [63].
THEOREM 14.2. For every planar polynomial system there exist ﬁnitely many invariant
curves in R2 and singular points γi, i = 1,2,...,l, such that R2\((l
i=1 γi) has ﬁnitely
many connected open sets, and on each of these connected sets the system has an analytic
ﬁrst integral.
COROLLARY 14.3. Let X = (P,Q) be a polynomial vector ﬁeld in R2 such that P and Q
are coprime. Then, using the notations of Theorem 14.2, the set (l
i=1 γi is formed by all
the separatrices of X in R2, and the open components of R2\((l
i=1 γi) are the canonical
regions of X .
Statement (1) of Theorem 14.1 follows directly from the following result.
LEMMA 14.4 (Neumann lemma [81]). Let ϕ be a local ﬂow on the two-dimensional man-
ifold M. Then every canonical region of (M,ϕ) is C0-parallel.
PROOF. Let (R,ϕ′ = ϕ|R) be a canonical region. There are no separatrices in R, so the
set consisting of orbits homeomorphic with S1 is open, and similarly the set consisting of
orbits homeomorphic with R is open. Hence, R consists entirely of closed orbits or entirely
of line orbits.

J. Llibre
Also, two orbits of ϕ′ can be separated with disjoint parallel neighborhoods. To prove
this we suppose γ (p) and γ (q) are distinct orbits (closed or not) which cannot be sepa-
rated. Then, for any parallel neighborhood Np of p, we have q ∈cl(Np); i.e.,
q ∈

Np
cl(Np) = α(p) ∪γ (p) ∪ω(p).
But then q ∈α(p) (or q ∈ω(p)) and this is impossible because q ∈Nq ⊂R and α(p) ∪
ω(p) ⊂cl(Nq) \ Nq.
It follows that the quotient space R/ϕ′, obtained by collapsing orbits of (R,ϕ′) to points,
is a (Hausdorff) one-dimensional manifold. Hence the natural projection π :R →R/ϕ′ is
a locally trivial ﬁbering of R over R or S1. Since the ﬂow provides a natural orientation
on the ﬁbers, there are only four possibilities, the four classes of parallel ﬂows described
above.
□
PROOF OF STATEMENT (2) OF THEOREM 14.1 FOR C0 FLOWS. From Lemma 14.4 it
follows that every canonical region R of (M,ϕ) is C0-parallel; i.e., there is a homeomor-
phism h of R onto M′ which takes orbits of ϕ onto orbits of ϕ′ preserving the sense (but
not necessarily the parametrization), and (M′,ϕ′) is one of the following ﬂows:
(1) M′ = R2 with the ﬂow deﬁned by x′ = 1, y′ = 0;
(2) M′ = R2 \ {0} with the ﬂow deﬁned by r′ = 0, θ′ = 1;
(3) M′ = R2 \ {0} with the ﬂow deﬁned by r′ = r, θ′ = 0;
(4) M′ = S1 × S1 with the rational ﬂow.
Clearly H(x,y) = y = C is a ﬁrst integral for the ﬂows (1) and (4), H(r,θ) = r = C a ﬁrst
integral for the ﬂow (2), and H(r,θ) = θ = C a ﬁrst integral for the ﬂow (3). Hence, H ◦h
is a continuous valued ﬁrst integral for the ﬂow ϕ on the canonical region R.

15. Darbouxian theory of integrability for polynomial vector ﬁelds on surfaces
In this section we follow the paper [68]. A polynomial vector ﬁeld X in R3 is a vector ﬁeld
of the form
X = P(x,y,z) ∂
∂x + Q(x,y,z) ∂
∂y + R(x,y,z) ∂
∂z,
where P , Q and R are polynomials in the variables x, y and z with real coefﬁcients. In all
this section m = max{degP,degQ degR} will denote the degree of the polynomial vector
ﬁeld X .
Let G:R3 →R be a Cr map with r ⩾1. The gradient of G is deﬁned by
∇G(x,y,z) =
∂G
∂x , ∂G
∂y , ∂G
∂z

(x,y,z).
If ∇G(x,y,z) ̸= 0 for all points (x,y,z) ∈R3, then
Σ =

(x,y,z) ∈R3: G(x,y,z) = 0

(127)

Integrability of polynomial differential systems

is called a 2-dimensional regular surface. A polynomial vector ﬁeld X in R3 deﬁnes a
polynomial vector ﬁeld on Σ if
X(x,y,z) · ∇G(x,y,z) = 0,
(128)
for all the points (x,y,z) of the surface Σ; i.e., for all (x,y,z) ∈Σ the vector X(x,y,z)
belongs to the tangent plane to Σ at the point (x,y,z).
In what follows sometimes we will consider real regular surfaces extended to complex
ones; that is, being G a real map we consider its natural extension to C3. Thus, we continue
denoting by Σ = {(x,y,z) ∈C3: G(x,y,z) = 0} the complexiﬁcation of (127). Always
we will work with real regular surfaces (127) such that its complexiﬁcation also satis-
ﬁes (128).
Let U be an open subset of R3. A polynomial vector ﬁeld X on the regular surface Σ
is integrable on the open subset U ∩Σ if there exists a nonconstant analytic function
H :U →R, called a ﬁrst integral of X on U ∩Σ, which is constant on all solution curves
(x(t),y(t),z(t)) of the vector ﬁeld X on U ∩Σ; i.e., H(x(t),y(t),z(t)) = constant for all
values of t for which the solution (x(t),y(t),z(t)) is deﬁned on U ∩Σ. Clearly H is a ﬁrst
integral of the polynomial vector ﬁeld X on U ∩Σ if and only if XH = 0 on all points
(x,y,z) of U ∩Σ. We note that the curves {H(x,y,z) = constant} ∩(U ∩Σ) are formed
by trajectories of X .
15.1. Invariant algebraic curves and exponential factors
In a similar way as we did for studying the invariant algebraic curves of real planar poly-
nomial vector ﬁelds, also for the real polynomial vector ﬁelds on real surfaces we will look
for complex invariant algebraic curves and we will think both the real polynomial vector
ﬁeld on a surface and the real surface as complex ones.
Let f ∈C[x,y,z], where as it is usual C[x,y,z] denotes the ring of the polynomials
in the variables x, y and z with complex coefﬁcients. The algebraic surface f = 0 deﬁnes
an invariant algebraic curve {f = 0} ∩Σ of the polynomial vector ﬁeld X on the regular
surface Σ = {(x,y,z) ∈C3: G(x,y,z) = 0} if
(i) for some polynomial K ∈C[x,y,z] of degree at most m −1 we have
Xf = P ∂f
∂x + Q∂f
∂y + R ∂f
∂z = Kf,
(129)
on all the points (x,y,z) of the surface Σ;
(ii) the intersection of the two surfaces f = 0 and Σ is transversal; i.e., for all the points
(x,y,z) ∈{f = 0} ∩Σ we have that
∇G(x,y,z) ∧∇f (x,y,z) ̸= 0,
where ∧denotes the vectorial product of two vectors of C3.

520
J. Llibre
The polynomial K is called the cofactor of the invariant algebraic curve {f = 0} ∩Σ.
Since on the points of the invariant algebraic curve {f = 0} ∩Σ the gradient ∇f of the
surface f = 0 is orthogonal to the polynomial vector ﬁeld X = (P,Q,R) (see (129)), and
the vector ﬁeld X is tangent to the surface Σ, it follows that the vector ﬁeld X is tangent to
the curve {f = 0}∩Σ. Hence, the curve {f = 0}∩Σ is formed by trajectories of the vector
ﬁeld X . This justiﬁes the name of invariant algebraic curve given to the curve {f = 0} ∩Σ
satisfying (129) for some polynomial K, because it is invariant under the ﬂow deﬁned
by X . We note that our deﬁnition of invariant algebraic curve {f = 0} ∩Σ does not need
that the regular surface to be algebraic, only needs that the surface {f = 0} be algebraic.
Let h and g polynomials of C[x,y,z]. Then the function F = exp(g/h) is called an
exponential factor of the polynomial vector ﬁeld X on Σ if for some polynomial K ∈
C[x,y,z] of degree at most m −1 it satisﬁes the following equality
XF = KF,
(130)
on all the points (x,y,z) of Σ. As before we say that K is the cofactor of the exponential
factor F.
As we will see from the point of view of the integrability of polynomial vector ﬁelds
on regular surfaces Σ the importance of the exponential factors is double. On one hand,
they verify equation (130), and on the other hand, their cofactors are polynomials of degree
at most m −1. These two facts will allow that they play the same role that the invariant
algebraic curves in the integrability of a polynomial vector ﬁeld X on Σ.
The following proposition has essentially the same proof as Proposition 1.12.
PROPOSITION 15.1. Let F = exp(g/h) be an exponential factor for the polynomial vector
ﬁeld X on the regular surface Σ, satisfying that the polynomials g and h are relatively
prime, and that the intersection of the surfaces {h = 0} with Σ is transversal. If h is non-
constant, then {h = 0} ∩Σ is an invariant algebraic curve of X on Σ, and g satisﬁes the
equation
Xg = gKh + hKF ,
on the points (x,y,z) of Σ, where Kh and KF are the cofactors of h and F respectively.
15.2. The surfaces
Now we describe the 2-dimensional regular surfaces on which we will study the Darboux-
ian theory of integrability for the polynomial vector ﬁelds deﬁned on them. These surfaces
will be the quadrics and the 2-torus.
It is well known that the quadrics can be classiﬁed into seventeen types. There are ﬁve
types of imaginary quadrics (namely the imaginary ellipsoid, cone, cylinder, two planes
that intersect, and two parallel planes). Since in this section we only consider real polyno-
mial vector ﬁelds on real surfaces, we omit these previous ﬁve imaginary quadrics. From
the twelve real quadrics there are three which are formed by planes (namely two planes

521
that intersect, two parallel planes, and a double plane). Since the study of the Darboux-
ian theory of integrability of the polynomial vector ﬁelds on these surfaces is reduced to
the classical study of the Darbouxian theory of integrability of planar polynomial vector
ﬁelds, we omit these three types of quadrics. In short we only deal with the remainder nine
quadrics.
We remark that the reduction of every quadric to each canonical form is made through
a linear isomorphism, and that a such isomorphism and its inverse are polynomial diffeo-
morphisms. Therefore, the study of the Darbouxian theory of integrability of polynomial
vector ﬁelds on these nine quadrics can be restricted to take for each of these quadrics its
canonical form. In what follows we describe the canonical forms for these nine quadrics
and their local charts, that we shall need later on. In fact we only present one local chart
for each surface, the full atlas would be described in a similar way, but it is not necessary
for studying the existence of ﬁrst integrals.
Parabolic cylinder. Its canonical form is given by z2 −x = 0.
Elliptic or circular paraboloid. Its canonical form is given by y2 + z2 −x = 0.
Hyperbolic paraboloid. Its canonical form is given by y2 −z2 −x = 0.
Let h(x,y) be equal to x, x −y2 and y2 −x for the parabolic cylinder, the circular
paraboloid and the hyperbolic paraboloid, respectively. Then for each one of these cases
we have that there is an open subset Ω of R2 and a diffeomorphism λ:Ω →Σ deﬁned by

are polynomial functions in the variables r, s and √h(r,s).
Ellipsoid or sphere. Its canonical form is given by
x2 + y2 + z2 −1 = 0.
We identify R2 as the tangent plane to the 2-dimensional sphere Σ at the point (0,0,−1).
Then we have λ:R2 →Σ \ {(0,0,1)} the diffeomorphism given by
λ(r,s) = (x,y,z)

Without loss of generality we restrict our attention to the sheet Σ having z > 0. Then we

Cone. Its canonical form is given by
x2 + y2 −z2 = 0.
Since the cone is not a regular surface at the origin, without loss of generality we restrict
our attention to the sheet Σ having z > 0. Then we have the diffeomorphism λ:R2 →Σ

Hyperbolic cylinder. Its canonical form is given by
x2 −z2 −1 = 0.
Without loss of generality we restrict our attention to the sheet Σ having x > 0. Then we

s2 + 1,r,s ,
whose inverse is λ−1(x,y,z) = (r,s) = (y,z). The entries of the Jacobian matrix Dλ(r,s)
are rational functions in the variables r, s and
√
s2 + 1.
Hyperboloid of one sheet. Its canonical form is given by
x2 + y2 −z2 −1 = 0.
Without loss of generality we restrict our attention to the surface Σ having z > 0. Then we
have the diffeomorphism λ:{(r,s) ∈R2: r2 + s2 > 1} →Σ ∩{z > 0} deﬁned by
λ(r,s) = (x,y,z) =

Elliptic or circular cylinder. Its canonical form is given by
x2 + z2 −1 = 0.

We identify R2 with the tangent plane to the cylinder Σ at the generatrix through the
point (0,0,−1). Let l be the generatrix to the cylinder through the point (0,0,1). Then we
consider the diffeomorphism π :R2 →Σ \ l deﬁned by

The entries of the Jacobian matrix Dπ(r,s) are rational functions in the variables r and s.
After the presentation of the nine quadrics for which we shall study the Darbouxian
theory of integrability of their polynomial vector ﬁelds, we present the 2-torus.
The 2-torus. We choose for the 2-torus T2 = R2/Z2 the following canonical form. For
a > 1 let Σ ≈T2 be the regular surface of R3 deﬁned by
z2 +

x2 + y2 −a
2 = 1.
The intersection of this torus with the (x,y)-plane is formed by the two circles γ1 and
γ2 with center at the origin and radius a −1 and a + 1, respectively. Let C be the circular
cylinder parallel to the z-axis and tangent to the torus Σ at the circle γ2. Let μ:C →Σ \γ1

On each plane P containing the z-axis, the diffeomorphism μ|C∩P is the inverse of the
stereographic projection at the two points P ∩γ1 from (Σ \ γ1) ∩P onto the two genera-
trices C ∩P . Its inverse μ−1 is given by
μ−1(x,y,z) = (u,v,w) =

15.3. Darbouxian theory
Now we will extend the results of the Darbouxian theory of integrability for planar poly-
nomial vector ﬁelds (see for instance Theorem 2.1) to polynomial vector ﬁelds on a regular
surface Σ. Here the regular surface will be one of the nine quadrics described in the pre-
vious subsection, or the 2-torus. In order to develop this theory we need some preliminary
algebraic results.
Let Rm[x,y,z] denote the real linear vector space of all polynomials of R[x,y,z]
having degree ⩽m. Let Rm[x,y,z = α(x,y)] be the real linear vector space of all the
functions obtained from the polynomials of Rm[x,y,z] substituting z by the function
α(x,y). Here α(x,y) is equal to √h(x,y) for the quadrics and for the 2-torus, where
h(x,y) is a polynomial such that its square root is not a polynomial if Σ is a quadric, and
h(x,y) = 1 −(

x2 + y2 −a)2 if Σ is the 2-torus.
We deﬁne d(m) as (m + 1)2 or 2(m2 + 1) for the quadrics or the 2-torus, respectively.
LEMMA 15.2. The dimension of the linear vector space Rm[x,y,z = α(x,y)] is d(m).
PROOF. We denote by Bk a basis of the real vector space formed by all polynomials in the
variables x and y having degree ⩽k. It is well known that the cardinal of Bk is (k +1)(k +
2)/2.
Assume that the function α(x,y) is associated to one of our nine quadrics. Then it is
easy to check that Bm ∪αBm−1 is a basis for the real vector ﬁeld Rm[x,y,z = α(x,y)].
Since the cardinal of this basis is
(m + 1)(m + 2)
2
+ m(m + 1)
2
= (m + 1)2,
it follows the lemma when the surface is a quadric.
Assume that
α(x,y) =
,
1 −

x2 + y2 −a
2 =

1 −(β −a)2,
is the function associated to the 2-torus. Then it is easy to verify that
Bm ∪αBm−1 ∪βBm−2 ∪αβBm−3,
is a basis for the real vector ﬁeld Rm[x,y,z = α(x,y)]. Since the cardinal of this basis is
(m + 1)(m + 2)
2
+ m(m + 1)
2
+ (m −1)m
2
+ (m −2)(m −1)
2
= 2(m2 + 1),
it follows the lemma when the surface is the 2-torus.
□
The functions of the linear vector space Rm[x, y,z = α(x,y)] are polynomials in the
variables x, y and α when Σ is a quadric, and polynomials in the variables x, y, α, β and

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
525
αβ when Σ is the 2-torus. We note that such polynomials always have degree one when
they are thought as polynomials in the variable either α, β or αβ.
Since the dimension of the linear vector space Rm[x,y,z = α(x,y)] is d(m), this space
is linearly isomorphic to Rd(m) by identifying each polynomial with the d(m)-tuple of its
coefﬁcients.
Let Σ be a quadric. For k = 1,...,r we say that r points (xk,yk,zk) ∈Σ are inde-

THEOREM 15.3. Let Σ be one of the nine quadrics of the previous subsection or the 2-
torus. Suppose that the real polynomial vector ﬁeld X on the real regular surface Σ of
degree m admits p invariant algebraic curves {fi = 0} ∩Σ with cofactors Ki for i =
1,...,p, q exponential factors Fj = exp(gj/hj) with cofactors Lj for j = 1,...,q, and
r independent singular points (xk,yk,zk) of X in Σ such that fi(xk,yk,zk) ̸= 0 for i =
1,...,p and for k = 1,...,r. Of course, every hj is equal to some fi except if hj is
constant. The following statements hold.
(a) There exist λi,μj ∈C not all zero such that p
i=1 λiKi +q
j=1 μjLj = 0 on all the
points (x,y,z) of Σ, if and only if the function f λ1

substituting
f λi

by |fi|λi if λi ∈R, is a ﬁrst integral of the vector ﬁeld X on Σ.
(b) If p + q + r = d(m −1) + 1, then there exist λi,μj ∈C not all zero such that
p
i=1 λiKi + q
j=1 μjLj = 0 on all the points (x,y,z) of Σ.
(c) The vector ﬁeld X on Σ has a rational ﬁrst integral if and only if p + q + r ⩾
d(m −1) + 2 and p + q ⩾3.

526
J. Llibre
PROOF. By hypothesis we have p invariant algebraic curves {fi = 0} ∩Σ with cofac-
tors Ki, and q exponential factors Fj with cofactors Lj . That is, the polynomials f ′
i s
satisfy Xfi = Kifi, and the F ′
js satisfy XFj = LjFj , on all the points (x,y,z) of the
regular surface Σ.
(a) We have λi,μj ∈C not all zero such that p
i=1 λiKi + q
j=1 μjLj = 0 on all the

(b) Since (xk,yk,zk) is a singular point of the vector ﬁeld X = (P,Q,R) on Σ,
we have that P(xk,yk,zk) = Q(xk,yk,zk) = R(xk,yk,zk) = 0. Then, since Xfi =
P(∂fi/∂x) + Q(∂fi/∂y) + R(∂fi/∂z) = Kifi on all the points (x,y,z) of Σ, it fol-
lows that Ki(xk,yk,zk) fi(xk,yk,zk) = 0. By assumption fi(xk,yk,zk) ̸= 0, therefore
Ki(xk,yk,zk) = 0 for i = 1,...,p. Again, since XFj = P(∂Fj/∂x) + Q(∂Fj/∂y) +
R(∂Fj/∂z) = LjFj on all the points (x,y,z) of Σ, it follows that Lj(xk,yk,zk)Fj(xk,yk,
zk) = 0. Since Fj = exp(gj/hj) does not vanish, Lj(xk,yk,zk) = 0 for j = 1,...,q. Con-
sequently, since the r singular points are independent, all the vectors Ki(x,y,z = α(x,y))
and Lj(x,y,z = α(x,y)) belong to a linear vector subspace S of Cm−1[x,y,z = α(x,y)]
of dimension d(m −1) −r. We have p + q vectors Ki(x,y,z = α(x,y)) and Lj(x,y,z =
α(x,y)), and since from the assumptions p +q > d(m−1)−r, we obtain that these p +q
vectors must be linearly dependent on S. So, there are λi,μj ∈C not all zero such that

= 0.
Hence statement (b) is proved.
(c) Under the assumptions of statement (c) we can apply statement (b) to two subsets of
p + q −1 ⩾2 functions deﬁning invariant algebraic curves or exponential factors. There-
fore, we get two linear dependencies between the corresponding cofactors, which after
some linear algebra and relabeling, we can write into the following form
M1 + α3M3 + ··· + αp+qMp+q = 0,
M2 + β3M3 + ··· + βp+qMp+q = 0,
where Ml are the cofactors Ki and Lj , and the αl and βl are real numbers. Of course, these
two equalities must be satisﬁed only on all the points (x,y,z) of Σ. Then, by statement (a),

Integrability of polynomial differential systems
527
it follows that the two functions
|G1||G3|α3 ···|Gp+q|αp+q,
|G2||G3|β3 ···|Gp+q|βp+q,
are ﬁrst integrals of the vector ﬁeld X on Σ, where for l = 1,...,p + q the function Gl
is the polynomial deﬁning an invariant algebraic curve or the exponential factor having
cofactor Ml. Then, taking logarithms to the above two ﬁrst integrals, we obtain that
H1 = log|G1| + α3 log|G3| + ··· + αp+q log|Gp+q|,
H2 = log|G2| + β3 log|G3| + ··· + βp+q log|Gp+q|,
are ﬁrst integrals of the vector ﬁeld X on Σ.
For each one of the regular surfaces Σ that we consider, we have deﬁned in the previous
subsection a local chart λ:R2 →Σ given by λ(r,s) = (x,y,z). We continue denoting
by λ the natural extension of λ from C2 to the complexiﬁed Σ. We note that when Σ is the
circular cylinder the map here denoted by λ was denoted by φ in the previous subsection.
Now, the vector ﬁeld X on Σ induces a vector ﬁeld ωX on C2 through ωX T(r,s) =
Dλ−1(λ(r,s))XT associated to ωX is denoted by
˙r = ωP(r,s),
˙s = ωQ(r,s).
(131)
Since Hi(x,y,z) is a ﬁrst integral of X on Σ, it follows that ωHi(r,s) = Hi(λ(r,s)) is a
ﬁrst integral of ωX on C2 (or R2 when we restrict on the real domain), for i = 1,2.
Each ﬁrst integral ωHi provides an integrating factor Ri(r,s) for system (131) such that
ωPRi = ∂ωHi
∂r
,
ωQRi = −∂ωHi
∂s
,
for i = 1,2. Therefore, we obtain that
R1
R2
=
∂ωH2
∂r
∂ωH1
∂r
.
(132)
Since the functions Gl are polynomials or exponentials of a quotient of polynomials,
from the expression of Hi it follows that the entries of the Jacobian matrix DHi(x,y,z)
are rational functions in the variables x, y and z. From the chain rule we have that
DωHi(r,s) = DHi(λ(r,s)) ◦Dλ(r,s).
In the previous subsection we have studied that the functions λ(r,s) and Dλ(r,s) are ratio-
nal in the variables r, s and, sometimes δ(x,y), a convenient square root depending on r
and s, according with the type of the surface Σ. So the partial derivatives of (132) are
rational functions in the variables r, s and perhaps δ(r,s).

528
J. Llibre
Now using for each surface Σ the expression (r,s) = λ−1(x,y,z), we can write the
function R1/R2 of (132) in the variables (x,y,z). From Proposition 15.1 it follows that
the function (R1/R2)(r,s) is a ﬁrst integral of system (131), and consequently that the
function (R1/R2)(x,y,z) is a ﬁrst integral of the vector ﬁeld X on Σ. This completes the
proof of statement (c).
□
We note that in statement (b) of Theorem 15.3 the number d(m −1) + 1 is equal to
m2 + 1 for the nine quadratics and 2m2 −4m + 5 for the torus.
We remark that in Theorem 15.3(c) once we know a rational ﬁrst integral in the vari-
ables x, y, z and μ =

x2 + y2, it is always possible to construct a rational ﬁrst integral
in the variables x, y and z.
For an extension of the results of Theorem 15.3 to vector ﬁelds on a regular algebraic
hypersurface of Rn see [71].

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
535
1. Introduction
The obtention of global (i.e., nonperturbational) results for the forced pendulum equation
started with the rigorous mathematical study of the periodic solutions of the periodically
forced pendulum equation
y′′ + α2 siny = β sin t
(1)
initiated in 1922 by Georg Hamel, in a paper of the special issue of the Mathematische
Annalen dedicated to Hilbert’s sixtieth birthday anniversary [55].
Hamel’s contribution starts by proving the existence of a 2π-periodic solution of Equa-
tion (1) through the direct method of the calculus of variations. He shows that the corre-
sponding action integral
A(y) :=
 2π
0
y′2(t)
2
+ α2 cosy(t) + βy(t)sin t

dt
has a minimum over the space of 2π-periodic C1-functions, and his argument easily ex-
tends to the case where b sint is replaced by a continuous 2π-periodic function h(t) with
mean value zero. The Ritz method is then used to ﬁnd a ﬁrst approximation of the amplitude
of the periodic solution.
Hamel then notices that the symmetries of the equation imply that any solution of Equa-
tion (1) satisfying the boundary conditions
y(0) = y(π) = 0
(2)
can be extended as an odd 2π-periodic solution. The problem (1)–(2) is reduced to the
nonlinear integral equation
y(t) = −α2
 2π
0
K(t,τ)siny(τ)dτ −β sin t := F(y)(t),
(3)
where K(t,τ) is the Green function of
y′′ = h(t),
y(0) = y(π) = 0.
The method of successive approximations
yn+1 = F(yn),
y0(t) = −b sint,
is shown to converge to a (unique) solution when α2 < 1. Hamel’s argument is equivalent
to proving the existence of a sufﬁciently large integer m, for which the mth iterate F m of
F is a contraction in the space C([0,π]).
When α2 ⩾1, Hamel uses Lyapunov–Schmidt’s method to study the 2π-periodic solu-
tions of (1) when |b| is sufﬁciently small, and mentions the possibility of the existence of
more than one 2π-periodic solution.

536
J. Mawhin
So, Hamel anticipates or uses several of the fundamental methods of nonlinear analysis,
in a work which will not be essentially superseded during some sixty years.
An important role in renewing the interest to the forced pendulum equation was played
by Fuˇcik in the late nineteen seventies, when he wrote, in the Introduction of Chapter 26
of his monograph [49]:
Finally we shall present here one attempt to obtain the existence of a T -
periodic solution of the mathematical pendulum equation
−u′′(t) + sinu(t) = f (t).
(4)
The result is not ﬁnal since the necessary and sufﬁcient condition obtained for
T -periodic solvability of (4) is not useful.
After describing very partial results in this direction and mentioning extensions personally
communicated by Dancer, Fuˇcik concluded that the
description of the set P of f for which the equation u′′ + sinu = f (t) has a
T -periodic solution seems to remain a terra incognita.
Motivated by Fuˇcík’s remarks, but unaware of the existence of Hamel’s paper, Castro [32]
(for α ⩽1), Dancer [36] and Willem [129], independently (for arbitrary α), reintroduced
in the early eighties the use of the direct method of the calculus of variations, in the setting
of Sobolev spaces. The time was ripe for the obtention by Mawhin and Willem [85], some
sixty years after the ﬁrst one, of a second periodic solution, using a reﬁnement of the
mountain pass lemma.
At the same time, the forced pendulum equation also became a paradigm for the theory
of chaos, and appeared in the description of Josephson type junctions. We only describe
global results in this direction here, and refer to the bibliography of [82,117] for the nu-
merous perturbational and numerical aspects.
A fundamental role in the development of the qualitative theory of nonlinear differential
equations and its applications to engineering, was also played by the pendulum equation
with a constant torque or Tricomi’s equation
y′′ + cy′ + a sin y = b,
introduced by Tricomi [125,126] in his studies of synchronous electrical machines, and
widely developed since (see [83] for references).
To keep the size of the survey reasonable and facilitate the comparison between results
obtained through different methods, we only state the theorems for the standard (possibly
dissipative) forced pendulum equation
y′′ + cy′ + a sin y = h(t).
Most of the assertions remain valid if a sin y is replaced by an arbitrary continuous S-
periodic function g(y) with mean value zero. Recent results depend upon the fact that
a sin y is replaced by a S-periodic function whose Fourier series contains higher harmon-
ics [63]. Also, some conclusions survive when the friction term cy′ is replaced by a more

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
537
general one of Liénard type f (y)y′ or of Rayleigh type f (y′). See the references in [82]
and the recent papers [52,54].
For the same reason of brevity, we will not describe the possible generalizations to sys-
tems of pendulum-type, and in particular to the equations of the forced multiple pendulum,
and to higher order pendulum-type equations. The reader can consult the bibliography in
[82] and the recent paper [116]. We shall also leave aside the existence of forced oscilla-
tions of the spherical pendulum (which depends upon methods of a quite different nature),
considered by Furi, Pera and Spadini, and the pendulum-type equations describing the li-
bration of satellites. Again, references to the corresponding literature for those questions
can be found in [82].
Let us mention also that the corresponding problem for the case of Dirichlet boundary
conditions, namely
y′′ + y + a sin y = h(t),
y(0) = 0 = y(π),
and its analog for partial differential equations, has been the object, since the pioneering
papers of Ward [128] using critical point theory, and of Schaaf and Schmitt [118] using
global bifurcation, of a number of studies by Arcoya, Cañada, Lupo, Roca, Ruiz, Solimini,
Ureña and others. References can be found in [82] and in the more recent contributions
[28–31]. This problem, which has both deep analogies and strong differences with the
periodic boundary value problem for the forced pendulum, will not be considered here.
Finally, in order to keep the number of references at a reasonable level, we have only
quoted the papers whose results are directly mentioned in this survey. Further bibliograph-
ical information can be found in [82].
2. Autonomous pendulum equations
2.1. The free conservative pendulum
To allow the evaluation of the subsequent results, let us brieﬂy recall the structure of the
solution set of the free conservative pendulum equation
y′′ + a siny = 0,
(5)
where a > 0. This information can easily be obtained from the energy integral
y′2
2 −a cosy = C,
(6)
by studying the orbits (y,y′) in the phase-plane (or in the phase-cylinder S1 × R). Equa-
tion (5) admits two geometrically distinct equilibria, namely

y(t),y′(t)

≡(0,0),

y(t),y′(t)

≡(π,0).

538
J. Mawhin
The orbits through (A,0), with 0 < y(0) = A < π are closed and surround the equilib-
rium (0,0), which is therefore a center. They correspond to periodic solutions of (5) with
maximum amplitude A and maximum velocity √2a(1 −cosA). Their period
T (A) = 2
√

 A

dy
√a(cosy −cosA)
is an increasing function such that
lim
A→0+T (A) = 2π
√a ,
lim
A→π−T (A) = +∞.
(7)
Physically, those periodic solutions correspond to oscillations of the pendulum around its
stable equilibrium position.
The orbits through (0,B) with B > 2√a (respectively B < −2√a) are the periodic
curves
y′ = ±

B2 −2a(1 −cosy)

(8)
in the upper (respectively lower) phase-plane (or closed curves surrounding the phase-
cylinder). So y(t) is strictly monotone and its inverse function t(y), given by
t(y) = ±
 y
0
ds
[B2 −2a(1 −cosy)]1/2 ,
is the indeﬁnite integral of a 2π-periodic function. Thus, if we deﬁne
τ(B) :=
 2π
0
dy

B2 −2a(1 −cosy)
,
(9)
t(y) has the form
t(y) = ±
τ(B)
2π y + P(y)

,
with P a 2π-periodic function. Therefore,
τ(B)
2π (y + 2π) + P(y + 2π) = τ(B) + τ(B)
2π y + P(y) = τ(B) + t,
which shows that
yt + τ(B) = y(t) + 2π
(t ∈R),
and hence, by (8),
y′
t + τ(B)

= y′(t)
(t ∈R).

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
539
Such a y is called a periodic solution of the second kind of Equation (5). The function τ(B)
is such that
lim
B→2√a+τ(B) = +∞,
lim
B→+∞τ(B) = 0.
Physically, those solutions correspond to rotations of the pendulum.
Finally, the orbit through (0,2√a ) (respectively (0,−2√a ) connects in the upper (re-
spectively lower) half phase-space the equilibria (−π,0) and (π,0) (heteroclinic orbits)
(or homoclinic orbits connecting (π,0) to itself in the phase-cylinder). Thus (π,0) is a
saddle point. Those orbits correspond to positive (respectively negative) asymptotic solu-
tions y of (5) such that
lim
t→−∞y(t) = −π,
lim
t→+∞y(t) = π
(respectively
lim
t→−∞y(t) = π,
lim
t→+∞y(t) = −π),
and
lim
t→±∞y′(t) = 0.
Physically, those solutions correspond to motions which are asymptotic (in the past or in
the future) to the unstable vertical equilibrium.
Notice that, if T ⩽2π
√a, the only T -periodic solutions of Equation (5) are the equilibria
y ≡0 and y ≡π. If T > 2π
√a, and if m ⩾1 is the largest integer such that T
m > 2π
√a, in other
words if
m =
T √a
2π

,
where [s] denotes the integer part of s, then Equation (5) has, besides the two equilibria,
nontrivial T -periodic solutions corresponding to the closed orbits of amplitude Ak such
that
T (Ak) = T
k
(k = 1,2,...,m).
2.2. The free damped pendulum
The study of the free damped pendulum
y′′ + cy′ + a siny = 0,
(10)

540
J. Mawhin
where, without loss of generality, we assume c > 0 and a > 0, is more delicate, as no
energy integral exists. Equation (10) still admits the constant solutions
y ≡0,
y ≡π,
but has no nonconstant T -periodic solution of any period T . Indeed, if y is a T -periodic
solution of (10), integrating the identity
y′′y′ + cy′2 + (a sin y)y′ = 0,
over [0,T ], and using the periodicity gives
c
 T
0

y′(t)
2 dt = 0.
Thus y′ = 0, and y = 0 (mod π).
Now, the variational equation around the zero equilibrium
z′′ + cz′ + az = 0
has characteristic roots which are both real and negative if c ⩾2√a and complex conjugate
with negative real part if c < 2√a. Thus the zero equilibrium is asymptotically stable. The
variational equation around the equilibrium y ≡π
z′′ + cz′ −az = 0
has a positive and a negative characteristic root. It is unstable of saddle point type.
Using the Lyapunov function
V (y,z) = z2 + (cy + z)2 + 4a(1 −cosy),
for the associated ﬁrst order system obtained in letting y′ = z in (10), one can show that, in
the phase-cylinder,with the exception of the two orbits which constitute the stable manifold
of the saddle point (π,0), all other orbits correspond to solutions tending to (0,0) when
t →+∞. The stable equilibrium (0,0) is a focus or a node according to c < 2√a or
c ⩾2√a.
Thus Equation (10) has no nonconstant periodic solution, no periodic solution of the
second kind, no homoclinic orbit. It has two heteroclinic orbits connecting (π,0) to (0,0)
and corresponding to the unstable manifolds of the saddle point (π,0). We refer to [6] for
the corresponding phase plane or phase cylinder portraits.
2.3. The pendulum with constant torque
The differential equation of the conservative pendulum with constant torque is
y′′(t) + a siny(t) = b,
(11)

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
541
where a > 0, b > 0, and its energy integral
y′2(t)
2
−a cosy(t) −by = C
(C ∈R),
(12)
gives the equations of the family of the orbits of (11) in the phase space (y,y′).
Equation (11) has zero, one unstable (y(t) ≡π/2), or one stable (y(t) ≡arcsin(b/a))
and one unstable (y(t) ≡π −arcsin(b/a)) equilibria, according to b > a, b = a or b < a.
If b < a, Equation (11) has T -periodic solutions for each T ∈]2π/
√
a2 −b2,+∞[, and, if
b ⩾a, Equation (11) has no (nonconstant) T -periodic solution. If b < a, Equation (11) has
one homoclinic orbit to the saddle point (π,0) and no homoclinic orbit if b ⩾a. Finally,
Equation (11) has no heteroclinic orbit and no periodic solution of the second kind. See [6]
for more details and corresponding phase portraits.
The differential equation of the damped pendulum with constant torque
y′′ + cy′ + a siny = b,
(13)
where a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, is also the equation of synchronous electrical motors considered
by Tricomi in [125,126]. Because of the absence of a ﬁrst integral, the discussion of its
qualitative behavior in the phase space or phase cylinder is much more delicate, and, in
contrast to the undamped case, periodic solutions of the second kind may exist.
Equation (13) has no, one unstable or one stable and one unstable (saddle point) equi-
librium, according to b > a, b = a or b < a. It has no nonconstant T -periodic solution
and no homoclinic orbit. For b > a, it has no heteroclinic orbit, and one periodic solution
of the second kind, with y′(t) > 0 for all t ∈R. For b ⩽a, there exists c0 > 0 such that
Equation (13) has no periodic solution of the second kind and two heteroclinic orbits if
c > c0, and one periodic solution of the second kind and one heteroclinic orbit if c ⩽c0.
The effective determination of c0 is an important and delicate problem.
3. Periodic solutions of the forced pendulum
3.1. The problems
We now consider the (possibly dissipative) periodically forced pendulum equation
y′′ + cy′ + a siny = h(t)

= ¯h + ˜h(t)

,
(14)
where we can assume, without loss of generality, that c ⩾0, a > 0, and where h = ¯h +
˜h is T -periodic, for some period T > 0, and corresponding frequency ω := 2π
T . For the
simplicity of exposition, we assume that h is continuous. Most results hold under weaker
regularity conditions.
We use the following notations:

with the corresponding decomposition y = ¯y + ˜y.
DEFINITION 1. A T -periodic solution of Equation (14) is a solution y :R →R such that
y(t + T ) = y(t) for all t ∈R.
We will sometimes use an interesting equivalent formulation of the problem of T -
periodic solutions for Equation (14).
LEMMA 1. If 
H(t) denotes the unique T -periodic solution in 
CT of equation
y′′ + cy′ = ˜h,
(15)
then y(t) is a T -periodic solution of Equation (14) if and only if x(t) = y(t) −
H(t) is a
T -periodic solution of equation
x′′ + cx′ + a sin

x + 
H(t)

= ¯h.
(16)
When h is not constant, Equation (14) has no constant solution, and one expects that
the equilibria will by replaced by T -periodic solutions. By integrating Equation (14) over
[0,T ], we immediately obtain a necessary condition for the existence of a T -periodic
solution to Equation (14).
PROPOSITION 1. If Equation (14) has a T -periodic solution, then
−a ⩽¯h ⩽a.
(17)
The main questions one can raise about the T -periodic solutions of Equation (14) are
the following ones:

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
543
1. Determine the nature and the properties of the set
R = R(c,a,T ) ⊂[−a,a] ⊕
CT
of T -periodic forcings h such that Equation (14) has at least one T -periodic solution,
i.e., the range of the nonlinear operator
d2
dt2 + c d
dt + a sin(·)
over the space of C2 T -periodic functions.
2. For h ∈R, discuss the multiplicity of the T -periodic solutions.
3. For h ∈R, discuss the stability of the T -periodic solutions.
4. Discuss the existence of subharmonic solutions, i.e., solutions with minimum period
kT for some integer k ⩾2.
Concerning the multiplicity, it is clear that if y is a T -periodic solution of Equation (14),
the same is true for y + 2kπ, k ∈Z. Consequently, we say that y1 and y2 are geometrically
distinct T -periodic solutions of (14) if they do not differ by a multiple of 2π.
3.2. The possibly dissipative case c ⩾0
The Lyapunov–Schmidt’s decomposition (see, e.g., [50]) consists in the following elemen-
tary fact.
LEMMA 2. y = ¯y + ˜y is a T -periodic solution of Equation (14) if and only if it is a solution
of the system
˜y′′ + c ˜y′ + a sin( ¯y + ˜y) −a sin( ¯y + ˜y) = ˜h(t),
(18)
a sin( ¯y + ˜y) = ¯h.
(19)
Of course, instead of y = ¯y + ˜y, one can also decompose y as y = y(τ) + [y −y(τ)],
for some τ ∈R.
In the classical Liapunov–Schmidt’s method, the ﬁrst equation in (18) is solved with
respect to ˜y for ﬁxed ¯y (using a ﬁxed point or implicit function theorem, or critical point
theory) and this solution is introduced in the second equation, which then becomes the
(one-dimensional) bifurcation equation. One can also study directly the equivalent system
(18)–(19) by degree or critical point theory.
The method of upper and lower solutions for the periodic solutions of Equation (14)
(see, e.g., [76]) consists in the following statement.
LEMMA 3. If α and β are of class C2, T -periodic and such that, for all t ∈R,
α(t) ⩽β(t),
α′′(t) + cα′(t) + a sinα(t) ⩾h(t) ⩾β′′(t) + cβ′(t) + a sin β(t),
(20)
then (14) has at least one T -periodic solution y such that α(t) ⩽y(t) ⩽β(t).

Furthermore, if the inequalities are strict in (20), the coincidence degree of the T -
periodic boundary value problem for (14) with respect to the open bounded set
Ω =

y ∈CT : ∀t ∈R, α(t) < y(t) < β(t)

is deﬁned and equal to one.
The coincidence degree is the Leray–Schauder degree of a suitable associated nonlinear
operator in CT , whose ﬁxed points give the T -periodic solutions of (14). See, e.g., [50,74].
The following results are now classical and can be found in [85,47,76]. Some of them
were ﬁrst proved in [36] and some have been reobtained in [61]. We recall ﬁrst the main
ideas and results of the used methods.
THEOREM 1. For each ˜h ∈
CT , there exists
m˜h = m˜h(c,a,T ) ⩽M˜h = M˜h(c,a,T )
such that the following hold.
1. Equation (14) has at least one T -periodic solution if and only if ¯h ∈[m˜h,M˜h].
2. −a ⩽m˜h ⩽M˜h ⩽a, m0 = −a, M0 = a.
3. R(c,a,T ) = (
˜h∈
CT [m˜h,M˜h] × {˜h} ⊂[−a,a] ⊕
CT is closed.
4. Equation (14) has at least two distinct T -periodic solutions if ¯h ∈]m˜h,M˜h[.
To prove this theorem, one ﬁrst uses the Lyapunov–Schmidt decomposition. Leray–
Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem applied to an integral formulation of (18) in the space

CT with parameter ¯y ∈S1 implies the existence of a connected closed set C(c,a,T, ˜h) ⊂
S1 × 
CT of solutions ( ¯y, ˜y) of (18), whose projection on S1 is equal to S1. Hence, Equation
(14) has at least one T -periodic solution if ¯h belongs to the nonempty set
I(c,a,T, ˜h) = a sin( ¯y + ˜y): ( ¯y, ˜y) ∈C(c,a,T, ˜h).
The fact that I(c,a,T, ˜h) is an interval follows from the fact that if ¯h1 < ¯h2 belong to
I(c,a,T, ˜h), and if ¯h ∈]¯h1, ¯h2[, then a corresponding solution yi = ¯yi + ˜yi of equation
y′′ + cy′ + a sin y = ¯hi + ˜h
(i = 1,2)
satisﬁes the equations
˜y′′
i + c ˜y′
i + a sin( ¯yi + ˜yi) −a sin( ¯yi + ˜yi) = ˜h(t),
a sin( ¯yi + ˜yi) = ¯hi
(i = 1,2),
and hence ( ¯yi, ˜yi) ∈C(c,a,T, ˜h) (i = 1,2) and are such that
a sin( ¯y1 + ˜y1) < ¯h < a sin( ¯y2 + ˜y2).

As the real map
( ¯y, ˜y) 
→a sin( ¯y + ˜y)
(21)
is continuous, there exists, by connexity, some ( ¯y, ˜y) ∈C(c,a,T, ˜h) such that
a sin( ¯y + ˜y) = ¯h,
and y = ¯y + ˜y is a T -periodic solution of Equation (14). We set
m˜h = infI(c,a,T, ˜h),
M˜h = supI(c,a,T, ˜h).
It follows from (17) that −a ⩽m˜h ⩽M˜h ⩽a, and it is trivial that m0 = −a and M0 = a.
To prove that R(c,a,T ) is closed, one considers a sequence (hi) in R(c,a,T ) converg-
ing uniformly to h ∈CT , and ( ¯yi, ˜yi) a corresponding sequence in S1 × 
CT of T -periodic
solutions. It is easy to show from (18) that ( ˜yi) is bounded in C2
T , and Ascoli–Arzelá the-
orem implies that, up to a subsequence, ( ¯yi + ˜yi) converges to some T -periodic solution y
of Equation (14). This implies that I(c,a,T, ˜h) is closed.
To prove the multiplicity result when m˜h < ¯h < M˜h, we observe that in this case, if ym
(respectively yM) is a T -periodic solution of Equation (14) with h = m˜h + ˜h (respectively
h = M˜h + ˜h), then ym (respectively yM) is an strict upper (respectively lower) solution for
Equation (14) with periodic boundary conditions. As Equation (14) is invariant under the
substitution y →y + 2kπ (k ∈Z), we can assume without loss of generality that yM(t) ⩽
ym(t) for all t ∈R and that ym(τ) −yM(τ) < 2π for some τ ∈R. An easy maximum
principle type reasoning then shows that yM(t) < ym(t) for all t ∈R. Hence Lemma 3
implies that (14) has at least one T -periodic solution ˆy1 such that
yM(t) < ˆy1(t) < ym(t)
(22)
for all t ∈R, and such that the associated coincidence degree with respect to the open set
Ω1 =

y ∈CT : ∀t ∈R, yM(t) < y(t) < ym(t)

,
is equal to one. Now, (yM + 2π,ym + 2π) and (yM,ym + 2π) are also two strictly or-
dered couples of lower and upper solution for Equation (14) with T -periodic boundary
conditions. Consequently, the coincidence degree respectively associated to the T -periodic
boundary value problem for Equation (14) with respect to the open sets
Ω2 = y ∈CT : ∀t ∈R, yM(t) + 2π < y(t) < ym(t) + 2π
and
Ω3 =

are equal to one. As
Ω1 ⊂Ω3,
Ω2 ⊂Ω3,

Ω1 ∩
Ω2 = ∅,
it follows from its additivity property that the coincidence degree associated to the T -

Ω2) is equal to −1, and Equation (14) has at least one T -periodic solution ˆy2 ∈Ω3 \( 

3.3. The conservative case c = 0
In the conservative case
y′′ + a sin y = h(t)

= ¯h + ˜h(t)

,
(23)
the direct method of the calculus of variations allows to prove that 0 ∈[m˜h,M˜h]. The
starting point of this approach or of any application of critical point theory to the periodic
solutions of the forced pendulum equation without dissipation is the following classical
observation.
LEMMA 4. y is a T -periodic solution of Equation (23) if and only if y is a critical point

(24)
If convenient, we also write Ah( ¯y, ˜y) instead of Ah(y). We recall a few deﬁnitions and
results. Let E be a Banach space and ϕ ∈C1(E,R). We denote its Fréchet differential at y
by ϕ′(y), and its value at v ∈E by ⟨ϕ′(y),v⟩.
DEFINITION 2. y ∈E is a critical point of ϕ if ϕ′(y) = 0. c ∈R is a critical value of ϕ if
c = ϕ(y) for some critical point y of ϕ.
We recall a classical and easy to prove sufﬁcient condition for the existence of a minimum
to ϕ.
PROPOSITION 2. Let E be a reﬂexive Banach space and ϕ ∈C1(E,R) be bounded from
below and sequentially weakly lower semi-continuous. Then ϕ has a minimum on E.
A slight extension of Hamel’s result [55,129,36] follows from Proposition 2.
THEOREM 2. For each ˜h ∈
CT , Equation (23) has at least one T -periodic solution which
minimizes Ah over H 1
T . In other words, 0 ∈[m˜h,M˜h].

This shows that Ah is bounded from below. From the sequential weak lower semicontinuity
of the map y

T into CT , it is easy to
show that Ah is sequentially weakly lower semi-continuous.
The existence of a second solution for the conservative forced pendulum when ¯h = 0
can be proved by a generalized mountain pass lemma, which extends both the geometrical
and the compactness assumptions of the classical Ambrosetti–Rabinowitz mountain pass
lemma [4]. This abstract extension, due to Ghoussoub–Preiss [51] and Yihong Du [42],
was motivated by the ﬁrst proof of a second T -periodic solution to Equation (23) given in
[85], as it was the case for the slightly less general version given earlier by Pucci–Serrin
[113]. We ﬁrst introduce two deﬁnitions.
DEFINITION 3. A Palais–Smale sequence at level c ∈R for ϕ ∈C1(E,R) is a sequence
(yn) in E such that
ϕ(yn) →c,
ϕ′(yn) →0,
if n →∞.
The function ϕ satisﬁes the (PS)c-condition if the existence of a Palais–Smale sequence at
level c for ϕ implies that c is a critical value for ϕ.
DEFINITION 4. The function ϕ ∈C1(E,R) satisﬁes the Palais–Smale condition (PS) (re-
spectively the bounded Palais–Smale condition (BPS)) if any sequence (respectively boun-
ded sequence) (yn) such that (ϕ(yn)) is bounded and ϕ′(yn) →0 has a convergent subse-
quence.
We now state the generalized mountain pass lemma.
LEMMA 5. Let d,e ∈E, 0 < r < ∥e −d∥, be such that
a := max

r⩽∥y−d∥⩽R ϕ(y).

Let
Γ = γ ∈C[0,1],E: γ (0) = d, γ (1) = e,
c := inf
γ ∈Γ sup
s∈[0,1]
ϕγ (s).
Then c ⩾b, and if ϕ satisﬁes the (PS)c and (BPS) conditions, c is a critical value for ϕ.
Moreover, if c = a, there is a critical point z such that ϕ(z) = c and ∥z −d∥= r.
The original mountain pass lemma requires that a < b and that the classical Palais–
Smale compactness condition holds.
To apply this Lemma 5 to Ah when h ∈
CT , the most technical part is to check that Ah
veriﬁes the Palais–Smale-type conditions.
LEMMA 6. If h ∈
CT , Ah satisﬁes the (BPS)-condition and the (PS)c-condition for each
c ∈R.
To show the (BPS)-condition, assume that (A′
h(yn)) converges to 0 and (yn) is bounded in
H 1
T . Then, up to a subsequence, (yn) converges weakly in H 1
T and uniformly on I to some
y ∈H 1
T . Consequently

2 dt →0,
as n →∞, and hence yn →y in H 1
T . Thus Ah satisﬁes the (BPS)-condition. Finally, let
(yn) be such that Ah(yn) →c and A′
h(yn) →0 as n →∞. Thus (Ah(yn)) is bounded
and, using (26) we see that (∥y′
n∥L2) is bounded. Now, by 2π-periodicity of Ah, there
exists zn ∈[0,2π[ such that zn = ¯yn (mod 2π). Letting wn(t) = zn + ˜yn(t), we have
Ah(yn) = Ah(wn), A′
h(yn) = A′
h(wn) and (wn) is bounded in H 1
T . By the reasoning for

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
549
(BPS) applied to this sequence, we see that, up to a subsequence, wn →w ∈H 1
T and this
easily implies that c is a critical value of Ah.
We can now prove the existence of a second T -periodic solution.
THEOREM 3. For each h ∈
CT , Equation (23) has at least two geometrically distinct T -
periodic solutions.
A ﬁrst solution y∗has been obtained which minimizes Ah over H 1
T . To obtain a second
one, it remains to check the geometry of the generalized mountain pass lemma. As
Ah

y∗

y∗+ 2π

= min
H 1
T
Ah,
let us take 0 < r < 2π, d = y∗,e = y∗+ 2π. Then, all conditions of Proposition 5 are
satisﬁed. If the critical value c > minH 1
T Ah, then the corresponding critical point is geo-
metrically distinct from y∗. If c = minH 1
T Ah, then Ah has a critical point z such that
0 < ∥z −y∗∥= r < 2π, so that y∗and z are two geometrically distinct T -periodic solu-
tions of Equation (23).
The periodicity property of Ah when ¯h = 0 allows also the use of a Lusternik–
Schnirelman type argument to prove directly that Ah has two distinct critical points (see
[78,34,114]). Let G be a discrete subgroup of a Banach space E and π :E →E/G be the
canonical surjection.
DEFINITION 5. A ⊂X is called G-invariant if π−1(π(A)) = A. ϕ :E →R is called G-
invariant if ϕ(y + g) = ϕ(y) for every y ∈E and every g ∈G.
When ϕ is differentiable, the same G-invariance holds for ϕ′, so that if y is a critical
point of ϕ, then π−1(π(y)) is a set of critical point of ϕ, called a critical orbit of ϕ.
A suitable Palais–Smale condition for G-invariant functions is the following one.
DEFINITION 6. A G-invariant differentiable functional ϕ :E →R satisﬁes the (PS)G-
condition if, for every sequence (yk) in E such that (ϕ(yk)) is bounded and ϕ′(yk) →0,
the sequence (π(yk)) contains a convergent subsequence.
The following multiplicity theorem holds for G-invariant functionals [114]. Its proof is
based upon Lusternik–Schnirelman category [86].
PROPOSITION 3. Let ϕ ∈C1(E,R) be a G-invariant functional satisfying the (PS)G-
condition. If ϕ is bounded from below and G generates a subspace of ﬁnite dimension
N, then ϕ has at least N + 1 critical orbits.
If we consider Ah with h ∈
CT , so that Ah(y +2π) = Ah(y) for all y ∈H 1
T , we can take
the discrete subgroup G = {2kπ: k ∈Z} of H 1
T . If y = ¯y + ˜y ∈H 1
T , there exists a unique
k ∈Z such that ¯y0 := ¯y −2kπ ∈[0,2π[, and ¯y0 + ˜y is a representative of [y] ∈H 1
T /G.

So the (PS)G-condition for Ah essentially reduces to the (BPS)-condition checked above.
Proposition 3 gives another proof of Theorem 3.
In [119], Serra and Tarallo have introduced a new reduction method of Liapunov–
Schmidt’s type, which provides equivalent formulations for some of problems for the forced
conservative pendulum equation. One ﬁrst observes that, for each ξ ∈R, the functional Ah
is bounded below on the hyperplane H 1
T,ξ = {y ∈H 1
T : ¯y = ξ}. Consequently, by the argu-
ment of Theorem 2, it reaches its minimum on H 1
T,ξ and we let
ϕh(ξ) := min
¯y=ξ Ah(y) = min
˜y∈
H 1

Ah(ξ, ˜y),
(28)
deﬁning in this way the real function ϕh :R →R, ξ

THEOREM 4. The following properties hold for ϕh.
1. ϕh is locally Lipschitz continuous on R.
2. Mh(ξ) ̸= ∅and compact for each ξ ∈R, Mh is weakly closed and Mh :R →2H 1
T is
upper semi-continuous.
3. If y ∈Mh and ¯y gives a local minimum to ϕh, y gives a local minimum to Ah.
4. ϕh is differentiable at ξ if and only if y 
→
 T
0 (a sin y(t) −h(t))dt is constant on
Mh(ξ).
5. If ϕh has a critical point, Ah has a critical point.
6. If ϕh is not strictly monotone, Ah has a critical point.
Properties 1, 2 and 3 are easy to prove, and Property 5 is a consequence of Property 4.
To prove this last one, deﬁne

and show, using the following inequalities, valid when Ah(ξ, ˜y) = ϕh(ξ),
ϕh(ξ + δ) −ϕh(ξ) ⩽Ah(ξ + δ, ˜y) −Ah(ξ, ˜y)

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
551
and the mean value theorem, that if ϕh is differentiable at ξ, then
ϕ′
h(ξ) ⩽λ(ξ + ˜y) ⩽ϕ′
h(ξ).
The proof of the converse is a little more elaborate and uses the compactness property in
Property 2 and the uniform coercivity of Ah(ξ,·) on bounded sets. Finally, the proof of
Property 6 uses, at a local maximum of ϕh, an argument on upper and lower solutions
similar to the one used in Theorem 1.
It is interesting to compare this approach to the classical method of Lyapunov–Schmidt.
In this case, one proves that, for each ξ ∈R, the set
Kh(ξ) =

y ∈CT : ¯y = ξ, ˜y solves Equation (18)

is not empty, and then the problem is reduced to ﬁnd the elements of the set Kh =
(
ξ∈R Kh(ξ) such that
a sin( ¯y + ˜y) = ¯h.
In the Serra–Tarallo’s approach, on each slice ξ + 
H 1
T of H 1
T , one considers only the el-
ements of Kh(ξ) which minimize the restriction of Ah on this slice, which provides the
subset Mh(ξ) ⊂Kh(ξ), and then, instead of trying to solve Equation (19) on this set, one
concentrates on the reduced functional ϕh and relates its critical points to those of Ah.
Hence the spirit is more variational than in earlier approaches combining a Lyapunov–
Schmidt argument with some variational method (like Castro–Lazer’s one used in [32]), in
that the emphasis, at each step, remains on the functional instead of on its gradient. One
of the main features of this approach is that, in contrast to most other ones, it still works
when a sin y is replaced by a more general almost periodic function.
3.4. The dissipative case c > 0
We just have shown that 0 ∈[m˜h,M˜h] when c = 0. A natural question is to ﬁnd an ex-
plicit element in [m˜h,M˜h] when c > 0. The following result, proved in [85] by topological
degree arguments, shows that m˜h < M˜h and 0 ∈]m˜h,M˜h[ when c is sufﬁciently large.
THEOREM 5. If c
T >
1
π
√
3∥˜h∥2, then m˜h < 0 < M˜h.
The question was then raised to know if 0 ∈[m˜h,M˜h] for each c > 0. A negative answer
was ﬁrst given by a counterexample of Ortega [99], and this result was improved by Alonso
[2] in the following form.
THEOREM 6. For each c > 0, there exists ˜h ∈
CT and T0 = T0(a,c) such that for each
T > T0, 0 /∈[m˜h,M˜h].

552
J. Mawhin
The idea of Alonso’s result consists in constructing a forcing term close to a piecewise
constant function h(t) taking a large positive value p in the interval [0,τ] and a small
negative value −q in the interval [τ,T ], where pτ −q(T −τ) = 0.
Further information has been given by Ortega, Serra and Tarallo [107] who have proved
the following interesting result. Let 
H be deﬁned in Lemma 1 and BT ∈L2

periodic function deﬁned by

THEOREM 7. Given a > 0, c > 0 and T > 0, there exists ε > 0 such that Equation (14)
has no T -periodic solution if h ∈L1
T and
∥
H −BT ∥2 < ε.
Moreover, ε can be explicitly computed in terms of a, c and T.
To prove this result, the authors ﬁrst consider the equivalent formulation (16) of Equation
(14) which, for 
H = BT is itself equivalent to equation
y′′ + cy′ −a sin(y + ωt) = 0.
(30)
Multiplying both members of Equation (30) by y′ + ω and integrating over [0,T ] shows
immediately that Equation (30) has no T -periodic solution. This is in contrast with the
case where c = 0, for which Bates [9] has shown the existence of a continuum of T -
periodic solutions (see also [86]). The following lemma provides estimates for the possible
T -periodic solutions of equation

The ﬁrst inequality is obtained by subtracting and adding a sin(y +ωt) to Equation (31),
multiplying both members by y′ + ω, integrating over [0,T ] and using T -periodicity and
Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. For the second inequality, one ﬁrst observes that the right-

then Equation (31) has no T -periodic solution, and, since ϕ(s) →0 as s →0, this happens
when ∥P∥2 is sufﬁciently small.
A consequence of Theorem 7 is that, under its conditions, every solution y of Equa-
tion (14) is such that limt→+∞|y(t)| = ∞. This follows from the fact that the Poincaré
mapping

associated to an arbitrary solution y of Equation (14) is an orientation preserving homeo-
morphism of the plane, whose ﬁxed points are the T -periodic solutions of Equation (14).
As P has no ﬁxed point under the conditions of Theorem 7, the theory of Brouwer for
ﬁxed point free homeomorphisms [53] is applicable, and the orbits of P must go to inﬁn-
ity. The result then follows from the easily veriﬁed fact that the derivatives of the solutions
of Equation (14) are bounded.
3.5. The degeneracy problem
The degeneracy problem for the T -periodic solutions of Equation (14), which is still open,
consists in proving or disproving the existence of some h such that m˜h = M˜h. Here is the
known partial information.
We start with some results valid for c ⩾0.
THEOREM 8. For the T -periodic problem for Equation (14), the set {˜h ∈
CT : m˜h < M˜h}
is open and dense.
This has been proved using various arguments [85,76,68],and in particular a generalized
Sard–Smale’s theorem. Thus, generically, [m˜h,M˜h] is a nondegenerate interval.
We now describe some contributions of Ortega and Tarallo [108], which generalize in
various directions earlier results of Donati [41] and of Serra, Tarallo and Terracini [121].
DEFINITION 7. Equation (14) is said to be degenerate if the set of ¯h such that Equation
(14) has a T -periodic solution is a singleton {¯h˜h}, i.e., if m˜h = M˜h.
In the (excluded) case where a = 0, Equation (14) is degenerate. It only admits T -
periodic solutions when ¯h = 0, in which case it has an unbounded path of T -periodic
solutions. This fact will be extended to the case where a > 0. Let T be the set of T -periodic
solutions of Equation (14). Using the Lyapunov–Schmidt decomposition and the Leray–
Schauder argument of the proof of Theorem 1, we obtain the existence of a connected
and closed subset C ⊂T such that {y(0): y ∈C} = R. By the same argument, one indeed
proves that given a closed interval I ⊂R and τ ∈R, a closed connected set Cτ,I ⊂T exists
such that {y(τ): y ∈Cτ,I} = I.
THEOREM 9. The following statements for Equation (14) are equivalent.
(i) The equation is degenerate.
(ii) For any ξ ∈R, there exists a unique yξ ∈T which satisﬁes yξ(0) = ξ.
(iii) There exists a continuous path ξ 
→yξ in T which satisﬁes
lim
ξ→±∞yξ(t) = ±∞
uniformly in t ∈R.
Moreover, if one of those conditions holds, the map ξ 
→yξ is continuous, monotone
(yξ(t) < yη(t) for all t ∈R when ξ < η), and such that yξ+2π = yξ + 2π.

To show that condition (i) implies condition (ii), one ﬁrst observes that if two elements
y,z ∈T intersect at some t0 then they coincide or intersect transversally (y′(t0) ̸= z′(t0)).
This implies the following useful intermediate proposition.
PROPOSITION 4. If A ⊂T be connected and z ∈T \ A, and if, for some y∗∈A, z and
y∗do not intersect, then z does not intersect any y ∈A.
Indeed, {y ∈A: y does not intersect v} is trivially open, and {y ∈A: y intersects v} is
open by the transversality property.
Coming back to the proof of Theorem 9, one then shows that, for any ξ and τ, letting
Cτ,ξ = Cτ,]−∞,ξ], one has Cτ,ξ = Tτ,ξ := {y ∈T : y(τ) ⩽ξ}. This depends in particular on
the property
∥y∥∞⩽


y(τ)


 + C,
(33)
satisﬁed by any T -periodic solution of Equation (14). One next proves using again Propo-
sition 4 that given y,z ∈T and τ ∈R such that y(τ) < z(τ), one has y(t) < z(t) for all
t ∈R. This follows from the fact that, for ξ = y(τ), z ̸∈Tτ,ξ and cannot intersect the very
large functions in Tτ,ξ. Then the existence of yξ follows from the existence of C and its
uniqueness from the above monotonicity property.
To show that condition (ii) implies condition (iii), one uses (33), the uniqueness property
and the local compactness of T . By uniqueness also yξ+2π = yξ + 2π and this implies the
limiting properties of yξ for ξ →±∞. Finally, to prove that (iii) implies (i), assume that y
is a T -periodic solution of Equation (14) and deﬁne
A = ξ ∈R: ∀t ∈R, yξ(t) ⩽y(t),
B = ξ ∈R: ∀t ∈R, yξ ⩾y(t),
and ξA = maxA, ξB = minB. One has yξA ⩽y, yξB ⩾y and they must touch somewhere,
namely at tA and tB, so that
y′
ξA(tA) = y′(tA),
y′′
ξA(tA) ⩽y′′(tA),
and the reverse inequality for yξB at tB. Then,
¯h˜h = y′′
ξA(tA) + cy′
ξA(tA) + a sinyξA(tA) −˜h(tA)
⩽y′′(tA) + cy′(tA) + a sin y(tA) −˜h(tA) = ¯h
= y′′
ξB(tB) + cy′
ξB(tB) + a sinyξB(tB) −˜h(tB)
⩽y′′
ξB(tB) + cy′
ξB(tB) + a sinyξB(tB) −˜h(tB) = ¯h˜h,
so that ¯h = ¯h˜h.
Consequences of Theorem 9 are that the solutions bounded over R of a degenerate
equation are either T -periodic solutions, or heteroclinic connections between different T -
periodic solutions, and some information about the stability of the T -periodic solutions.

We now describe some results valid in the conservative case c = 0, with, ﬁrst, an im-
provement of Theorem 8 proved in [68] using a generalized Sard–Smale lemma.
DEFINITION 8. A regular value for a mapping f of class C1 between two smooth Banach
manifolds is the image by f of a point c such that f ′
c is onto.
THEOREM 10. The set G of regular values for y →y′′ + a siny on C2
T is open and dense
in 
CT , and, for every g ∈G, there exists ε > 0 such that, if ∥h −g∥∞⩽ε, Equation (23)
has a T -periodic solution.
Serra, Tarallo and Terracini [121] have found another characterization of degeneracy in
the conservative case. If h ∈
CT , let
c0 = min
H 1
T
Ah,
(34)
and for ξ ∈R, let
Kc0(ξ) := y ∈H 1
T : Ah(y) = c0, ¯y = ξ.
PROPOSITION 5. If Kc0(ξ) ̸= ∅for each ξ ∈R, then
(i) For each ξ ∈R, Kc0(ξ) = {yξ}.
(ii) The map ξ 
→yξ is continuous and yξ(t) < yη(t) for all t if ξ < η.
(iii) There are no other periodic solutions (of any period) to (23).
To prove (i) one supposes that Kc0 contains two points v and w. As v −w = 0, one has
v(τ) = w(τ) for some τ and we show that v′(τ) = w′(τ). Indeed, y = max(v,w) ∈H 1
T
and it is easy to show that Ah(y) = c0, so that y solves Equation (23), thus is differentiable
at τ, and the result follows. The second part of (ii) is proved in an analogous way and the
ﬁrst one easily follows from the fact that if ξn →ξ, then (yξn) is a bounded Palais–Smale
sequence, and hence is relatively compact. To show (iii) one ﬁrst assume that u is a periodic
solution of Equation (23) with period rational with T, and one deﬁnes
B =

ξ ∈R: ∀t ∈R, yξ(t) ⩾u(t)

.
Like in Ortega–Tarallo reasoning above, B is nonempty, bounded below and closed, and
one shows that, if ξ0 = infB, then u = yξ0. If yξ0(t) > u(t) for all t ∈R, then the rational-
ity of the period of u with T implies that ε := inft∈R[yξ0(t) −u(t)] > 0. For δ > 0 such
that |ξ −ξ0| ⩽δ implies ∥yξ −yξ0∥∞⩽ε, we see that ξ0 −δ ∈B, a contradiction with
the deﬁnition of ξ0. Thus yξ(t0) = u(t0) for some t0 and then also y′
ξ(t0) = u′(t0), so that
yξ = u. If the period of u is irrational with T, then h ≡0 is constant and the assumption is
not satisﬁed.
THEOREM 11. Let h ∈CT and c0 = minH 1
T A˜h. Then m˜h < M˜h if and only if
Kc0(ξ) = ∅
for some ξ ∈R.
(35)
In this case, 0 is an interior point of [m˜h,M˜h].

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
557
If Kc0(ξ) = ∅, then one can ﬁnd ρ > 0 and δ > 0 such that if ∥¯y −ξ∥⩽ρ, and |A˜h(y)−
c0| ⩽ρ, then ∥A′
˜h(y)∥⩾δ. If not, for each positive integer n, there exist yn such that
∥¯yn −ξ∥⩽1
n,


A˜h(yn) −c0


 ⩽1
n,
A′
˜h(yn)
 ⩽1

The (BPS)-condition leads to a contradiction. Now let z ∈H 1
T be such that A˜h(z) < c0 + δ
and m,k be two integers such that ξ + 2kπ < ¯z < ξ + 2mπ. Let B = {y ∈H 1
T : ξ + 2kπ ⩽
¯y ⩽ξ + 2mπ}. Since by construction and its 2π-periodicity A˜h(z) < c0 + δ ⩽min∂B A˜h,
we have Ah(z) < min∂B Ah provided ¯h ∈[−μ,μ], for some sufﬁciently small μ > 0. Tak-
ing a minimizing sequence (yn) for Ah restricted to B, which, up to a subsequence, weakly
converges to y, we obtain Ah(y) = minB Ah, and, from Ah(y) ⩽Ah(z) < min∂B Ah, y is
a local minimum for Ah on H 1
T and hence a solution to Equation (23). The proof of the con-
verse result is essentially the same as the proof of the implication (iii) ⇒(i) in Theorem 9.
Serra and Tarallo [119] have used their reduction method to obtain more precise infor-
mation.
THEOREM 12. Let h ∈CT .
1. If ϕh is constant, then Mh(ξ) = {yξ}, and if y is a periodic solution of Equation (23),
then ¯h = 0 and y = yξ for some ξ ∈R.
2. ϕh is not constant if and only if there exists ε0 > 0 such that Equation (23) has at
least one T -periodic solution for each |¯h| < ε0.
3. [m˜h,M˜h] = {0} if and only if ϕh is constant.
4. {˜h ∈
CT : ϕ˜h is not constant} is open and dense in 
CT .
5. If ϕh is constant and ¯h ̸= 0, then Equation (23) has no bounded solution.
From the study of some dynamical properties of diffeomorphisms of the plane having a
continuum of ﬁxed points, Campos, Dancer and Ortega [27] have reﬁned conclusion (iii)
of Proposition 5.
THEOREM 13. If (23) is degenerate, then every solution which is bounded in the future is
a T -periodic solution.
The corresponding diffeomorphism of the plane is of course Poincaré’s map.
Finally, Kannan and Ortega [61] have proved the following asymptotic result, showing
that M˜h −m˜h can be small, and have given an example showing that the involved set is not
open. The proof makes use of some Riemann–Lebesgue lemma and asymptotic analysis
techniques.
THEOREM 14. For c = 0,

˜h ∈

|λ|→∞mλ ˜h = lim

3.6. Multiplicity and stability results under restrictions of the coefﬁcients
More precise results in the conservative case c = 0 can be obtained if one assumes that
condition
a < ω2
(36)
holds. Donati [41] has proved the following result about the structure of the solution set.
THEOREM 15. If condition (36) holds and ¯h ∈[m˜h,M˜h], then Equation (23) has at most
ﬁnitely many distinct T -periodic solutions when [m˜h,M˜h] ̸= {0}. Otherwise, Equation (23)
has an analytic unbounded curve of solutions.
Starting from the Lyapunov–Schmidt’s reduction, one ﬁrst proves that for each ¯y ∈R
and ˜h ∈
CT , Equation (18) has a unique solution ˜y = ˜y( ¯y, ˜h) ∈
C2
T , which depends analyt-
ically upon ¯y and ˜h, and is such that
∥˜y∥C2 ⩽C

| ¯y| + ∥˜h∥∞

for a suitable constant C > 0. The problem is reduced to the study of the real valued
function F deﬁned over R × 
CT by
F( ¯y, ˜h) := 1
T
 T
0
a sin¯y + ˜y( ¯y, ˜h)dt.
One shows that, for each ﬁxed ˜h ∈
CT , F(·, ˜h) is a real analytic 2π-periodic function and
that
m˜h =
min
¯y∈[0,2π]F( ¯y, ˜h) ⩽0 ⩽M˜h =
max
¯y∈[0,2π]F( ¯y, ˜h).
The result follows from properties of analytical functions.
By imposing further restrictions upon c,a, and T, it is possible to obtain on one hand
exact multiplicity results for the T -periodic solutions, and, on the other hand, informations
upon their Lyapunov stability. The pioneering work in the ﬁrst direction is due to Tarantello
[123] (using a Lyapunov–Schmidt approach) and, in the second direction, to Ortega [100–
102] (using relations between stability and the Brouwer degree of Poincaré’s operator).
If we ﬁrst assume that c > 0, a recent paper of ˇCepiˇcka, Drábek and Jenšiková [33]
provides the sharpest known conditions.
THEOREM 16. If
c > 0,
a < max
c2

,
then m˜h < M˜h and Equation (14) has:

(1) exactly one T -periodic solution if either ¯h = m˜h or ¯h = M˜h;
(2) exactly two T -periodic solutions if ¯h ∈]m˜h,M˜h[.
If
c > 0,
a < max

,
then the conclusions 1 and 2 remain true and the periodic solution obtained in case 1 is
unstable while one solution obtained in case 2 is asymptotically stable and the other one
unstable.
The proof of the exact multiplicity results in Theorem 16 is based upon the Lyapunov–
Schmidt reduction method together with the real analytic version of the implicit function
theorem, to analyze the bifurcation equation. The uniqueness in the solution of Equa-
tion (18) is deduced from some preliminary study of the T -periodic solutions of linear
equations of the type
y′′ + cy′ + g(t)y = 0,
with g T -periodic. The stability conclusion is obtained in the same way as in Ortega’s
papers.
Assume now that c = 0. The difﬁculty in analyzing the stability in the conservative case
is that asymptotic stability can no more be expected. In a recent paper, Dancer and Ortega
[37] have proved the following proposition.
LEMMA 8. A stable isolated ﬁxed point of an orientation preserving local homeomor-
phism on R2 has ﬁxed point index equal to one.
The proof of this result depends upon a variant of Brouwer’s lemma on translation arcs.
One of the given applications is the following result. Let V :R2 →R, (t,y) 
→V (t,y) be
continuous together with ∂V
∂y , and T -periodic in t.
LEMMA 9. If y is an isolated T -periodic solution of equation
y′′ = ∂V
∂y (t,y),
(37)
and y reaches a local minimum on H 1

then y is unstable.

560
J. Mawhin
This result is proved by showing ﬁrst, through a result of Amann on the computation of
degree of gradient mappings and a relatedness principle of Krasnosel’skii–Zabreiko, that
the index of y is equal to minus one. The result then follows from the previous one.
An immediate consequence for the pendulum equation is the following one.
THEOREM 17. If h ∈
CT , any isolated T -periodic solution of Equation (23) minimizing
Ah is unstable.
One can then ask if the above result still holds without the isolatedness assumption.
Ortega [105] has proved the following interesting property of ﬁxed points in the plane.
LEMMA 10. If D ⊂R is a domain and F :D ⊂R2 →R2 is real analytical and not the
identity on D, its Jacobian is equal to 1 on D, and if p is a stable ﬁxed point of F, then p
is isolated in the ﬁxed points set of F.
The delicate proof of this result uses Brouwer’s plane translation theorem.
As an application, the following unstability result is proved in [105].
LEMMA 11. If V is real analytic, and y is a T -periodic solution of Equation (37) on which
ϕ has a local minimum on H 1
T , then y is unstable.
An immediate consequence for the forced pendulum equation is the following one.
THEOREM 18. If h ∈
CT is analytical, the number of T -periodic solutions of Equa-
tion (23) that are stable and geometrically distinct is ﬁnite.
Calanchi and Tarallo [26] have used the Serra–Tarallo reduction method to show the
following result.
THEOREM 19. Assume that a < ω2. Then there exists K = K(a,T ) > 0 such that if
∥h∥2 < K, there exists an increasing and continuous map η :R →R such that, for the
reduction function ϕh, one has
#ϕ−1
h (λ) = #

aT cos(·)
−1
η(λ)

.
Furthermore, each critical point of Ah over H 1
T is a local minimum or a point of mountain
pass type.
3.7. Many T -periodic solutions for special forcings
We now raise the question of the possibility of having more than two geometrically distinct
T -periodic solutions for the forced pendulum. In [40], Donati proved the following result.

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
561
THEOREM 20. Given a > 0 and T > 0, there exists h∗∈
CT and a neighborhood V of
h∗in 
CT such that for each h ∈V, Equation (23) has at least four geometrically distinct
T -periodic solutions.
The proof is based upon a classiﬁcation of singularities of the nonlinear Fredholm operator
d2
dt2 + a sin(·) over the space of C2 T -periodic functions.
Applying to Equation (16) a classical perturbation method as used for example by Loud
for Dufﬁng’s equation, Ortega [104] has improved this result by replacing 4 by any even
number.
THEOREM 21. Given a > 0 and an integer N ⩾1, there exists h∗∈
CT and δ > 0 such
that if h ∈
CT is such that ∥h −h∗∥L1 < δ, then Equation (23) has at least 2N geometri-
cally distinct T -periodic solutions.
The idea of the proof consists in considering the equation
y′′ + a sin

y + BT (t)

= 0,
(38)
where BT is deﬁned in (29), which has a continuum (yc)c∈R of T -periodic solutions, and
in considering a perturbation of Equation (38)
y′′ + a sin

y + BT (t) + Ψ (t,ε)

= 0,
(39)
with conditions upon Ψ insuring that BT (t) + Ψ (t,ε) is smooth and that one has at least
2N periodic simultaneous bifurcations for ε = 0.
We ﬁnally describe some recent results obtained by Ureña [127], which cover the possi-
bly dissipative case.
THEOREM 22. For any N ∈N, the set
SN := h ∈L1
T : (14) has at least N geometrically distinct solutions
has nonempty interior in L1
T . More precisely,
(1) intSN ∩L1
T ̸= ∅if c = 0;
(2) intSN ∩{h ∈L1
T : −ε < ¯h < 0} ̸= ∅̸= intSN ∩{h ∈L1
T : 0 < ¯h < ε} if c ̸= 0.
The proof uses the equivalent formulation (16). One ﬁrst observes that there exists a
necessarily constant ¯h such that the problem
y′′ + cy′ + a siny = ¯h,
y(0) = 0, y(t + T ) = y(t) + 2π
has a unique solution, denoted by yc,T . This is proved by considering the equivalent prob-
lem of ﬁnding w ∈CT solution of equation
v′′ + cv′ + a sin(v + ωt) = ¯h −ωc,

562
J. Mawhin
and using Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem to obtain ¯h = ¯hc,T for which a solution vc,T ex-
ists. Notice that such a problem is degenerate, and hence has a nontrivial curve of solutions
γ :R →C1
T , a 
→vc,T (· + a) + ωa. Some bifurcation technique based upon Lyapunov–
Schmidt decomposition is then used to obtain many solutions bifurcating from such a
closed loop at a constant external force. See [127] for the quite involved details, as well as
for the proof of the following result, when c = 0.
THEOREM 23. Let N ∈N be given. If c = 0 and

there exists an open set ON ⊂L1

tion (23) has exactly 2N geometrically distinct T -periodic solutions.
3.8. Many T -periodic solutions for small length pendulum
To motivate a further multiplicity result of perturbation type proved by Fonda and Zanolin
[46] in the forced case, let us recall that for the conservative free pendulum equation (23),
relation (7) implies that, given any positive integer N, Equation (5) has a closed orbit
with least period T
k for each k = 1,2,...,N, if a > 4π2N2
T 2
. To deal with the forced case,
Fonda and Zanolin use Weiyue Ding’s generalization of the Poincaré–Birkhoff ﬁxed point
theorem [39] for the area-preserving twist homeomorphism given by Poincaré’s operator
P, that we recall now.
Let A be the annulus S1 × [a,b] in R2. If φ :A →R2 \ {0}, we denote by
F(θ,r):R × [a,b] →R × [0,+∞[, (θ,r) 
→

θ + f (θ,r),g(θ,r)

(40)
its lift on the polar coordinates covering space, where f and g are 2π-periodic in θ.
The eldest ﬁxed-point theorem for maps in an annulus is the Poincaré–Birkhoff’s theo-
rem [112,15].
LEMMA 12. Every area-preserving homeomorphism φ :A →A which rotates the two
boundaries in opposite directions, i.e., is such that f (θ,a)f (θ,b) < 0 for all θ ∈R, has
at least two ﬁxed points in the interior of A.
A more effective version for applications has been given by Weiyue Ding [39].
LEMMA 13. Let A ⊂R2 \ {0} denote an annular region whose inner boundary Γ1 and
outer boundary Γ2 are closed simple curves around the origin 0 and denote by Di the
open region bounded by Γi, i = 1,2. Let ϕ :A →R2 \ {0} be an area-preserving homeo-
morphism. Suppose that

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
563
(i) the inner boundary curve Γ1 is star-shaped around the origin,
(ii) ϕ admits a lift F onto the polar coordinate covering space (40), such that f (θ,r) >
0 on the lift of Γ1 and f (θ,r) < 0 on the lift of Γ2,
(iii) there exists an area-preserving homeomorphism ϕ0 : 
D2 →R2 which satisﬁes
ϕ0|A ≡ϕ and 0 ∈ϕ0(D1).
Then ϕ has at least two ﬁxed points in the interior of A.
The result of Fonda and Zanolin can be stated as follows.
THEOREM 24. Given any positive integer N, there exists a0 > 0 such that, for any a ⩾a0,
Equation (23) has at least N periodic solutions with minimal period T, which can be
chosen to have exactly 2j simple crossings with 0 in the interval [0,T [ (j = 1,2,...,N).
To prove this result, the authors notice that a simple change of variable transforms Equa-
tion (23) into equation
y′′ + siny = a−1h

a−1/2t

(41)
and the T -periodic solutions of Equation (23) correspond to the T √a-periodic solutions
of Equation (41). They combine then a perturbation argument together with Ding’s twist
theorem.
3.9. Subharmonic solutions when c = 0
Subharmonic solutions of a T -periodic equation are solutions whose minimal period is a
proper multiple of T.
DEFINITION 9. If k ⩾2 is an integer, a subharmonic solution of order k of Equation (14)
is a periodic solution of Equation (14) with minimal period kT.
The ﬁrst existence theorem for the subharmonic solutions of Equation (23) with h ∈
CT
have been obtained by Fonda and Willem [45] using Morse theory (see, e.g., [86]). Ofﬁn
[96] has proved a close result using an index theory for periodic extremals and a variant of
the mountain pass lemma. The subharmonics of order k are associated to the critical points
of the functional Ah,k deﬁned by

DEFINITION 10. The Morse index of an isolated T -periodic solution y of Equation (23)

T on which the quadratic form
χy(v) :=

λ,T the characteristic multipliers of the T -periodic

then y is said to be nondegenerateif 1 /∈{σ ′
λ,T ,σ ′′
λ,T }. Given σ ∈S1, one deﬁnes J(y,T,σ)
to be the number of negative λ’s for which σ ∈{σ ′
λ,T ,σ ′′
λ,T }. Then J(y,T,1) is equal to
the Morse index of the T -periodic solution y of (23). Bott’s iteration formula [24] ensures
that
J(y,kT,1) =

σ k=1
J(y,T,σ).
THEOREM 25. Suppose that the T -periodic solutions of Equation (23) are isolated and
that every T -periodic solution of Equation (23) having Morse index equal to zero is non-
degenerate. Then there exists k0 ⩾2 such that, for every prime k ⩾k0, there is a periodic
solution of Equation (23) with minimal period kT. If moreover the kT -periodic solutions
of Equation (23) are nondegenerate for k = 1 and every prime k, there exists k0 ⩾3 such
that, for every prime k ⩾k0, Equation (23) has at least two periodic solutions with minimal
period kT.
By assumption and an easy reasoning, Ah,1 = Ah has a ﬁnite number of critical points
y0,y1,...,yn, which, of course, are also critical points of Ah,k for any k ⩾2. The ﬁrst
ingredient of the proof consists in showing the existence of some integer k0 such that, for
k ⩾k0 and 0 ⩽i ⩽n, either the Morse index J(yi,kT,1) of yi is equal to 0 and yi is
nondegenerate, or J(yi,kT,1) ⩾2. This is done using Bott’s iteration formula. Now, let
k ⩾k0 be prime, so that the critical points of Ah,k have minimal period T or kT. Assume
now by contradiction that y0,...,yn are the only critical points of Ah,k. The Poincaré
polynomial of the space S1 × 
H 1
T (whose coefﬁcient of tn is the nth Betti number of S1 ×

is the ith critical group of yj [86], so that dimCi(Ah,k,yj) = δi,J(yj,kT,1) when yj is
nondegenerate. By the claim, if J(yj,kT,1) = 0, then Mk(t,yj) = 1, and otherwise, if
J(yj,kT,1) ⩾0, then dimCi(Ah,k,yj) = 0 for i = 0,1, and Mk(t,yj) starts with terms
in t2 at least. So, the left-hand member of (42) contains no term in t, a contradiction. The
proof of the second part of Theorem 25 is similar.
Combining the Fonda–Willem’s theorem with the results of [68], one obtains the generic
existence of subharmonic solutions.
THEOREM 26. There exists an open dense subset G of 
CT such that for every h ∈G, there
exists k0 ⩾2 such that, for every prime k ⩾k0, Equation (23) has a periodic solution with
minimal period kT .
As shown in [121], the modiﬁed Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction method also provides
some information about subharmonic solutions, by relating their existence to the properties
of ϕh.
THEOREM 27. Equation (23) with h ∈
CT has subharmonics of inﬁnitely many distinct
levels if and only if ϕh is not constant. If minH 1
T Ah is isolated in the set of critical levels
of Ah, then Equation (23) with h ∈
CT admits subharmonics of arbitrary large minimal
period if and only if ϕh is not constant. Finally, the isolatedness assumption in the previous
statement can be dropped if a < ω2.
Fonda–Zanolin’s multiplicity result [46] has a counterpart for subharmonic solutions,
proved using the same ﬁxed point technique.
THEOREM 28. Given any two positive integers M,N, there exists a0 > 0 such that, for
any a ⩾a0, Equation (23) has, for each k = 1,2,...,M, at least N periodic solutions
with minimal period kT.
4. Rotating solutions and Mather sets
4.1. Periodic solutions of the second kind
Besides periodic solutions, we have seen the free pendulum has also periodic solutions of
the second kind, which are the sum of a linear function of t and of a periodic term. We
shall study the existence of such solutions for the forced conservative pendulum (23).
DEFINITION 11. y is a periodic solution of the second kind of (23) if there exists p ∈
Z \ {0} and q ∈N \ {0} such that, for each t ∈R, one has
y(t + qT ) = y(t) + 2pπ.
(43)
Notice that such a solution is such that
y′(t + qT ) = y′(t)

566
J. Mawhin
for all t ∈R, and hence, integrating and using (43), we ﬁnd that
y(t) = p
q ωt + v(t)
(44)
with ω = 2π/T and v some qT -periodic function. Conversely, every solution of (23) of
the type (44) is a periodic solution of second kind. Such a solution has the rotation number
lim
t→±∞
y(t)
ωt = p
q .
(45)
Under some conditions, the conservative forced pendulum (23) can also admit periodic
solutions of the second kind. First, the change of unknown y(t) 
→v(t) deﬁned by (44) and
the use of direct methods of the calculus of variations to the transformed equation allows a
very simple proof of the following result [79].
THEOREM 29. For each a > 0, T > 0, q ∈N \ {0}, p ∈Z \ {0}, and each h ∈
CT , Equa-
tion (23) has at least one solution y satisfying (43).
Such a solution, also called a rotating solution of Equation (23) with rotation number p
q ,
is entirely determined by its values on [0,qT ], and satisﬁes the boundary conditions
y(qT ) = y(0) + 2pπ,
y′(qT ) = y′(0).
(46)
A second geometrically distinct solution also follows from the mountain pass argument.
In the case of an analytic h, Ortega’s approach described in Section 3.7 provides infor-
mation about the number and stability of those rotating solutions [105].
THEOREM 30. If h ∈
CT is analytic, given p ∈Z \ {0} and q ∈N \ {0}, the number of
stable and distinct rotating solutions with rotation number p
q of Equation (23) is ﬁnite.
4.2. Solutions with an arbitrary rotation number
We shall now show that Equation (23) with h ∈
CT also admits solutions having an arbi-
trary rotation number. This follows from some results of Mather [69] and Moser [89,88],
that we sketch in the form given by Denzler [38], which is closer in spirit to the calculus
of variations (see also [95]). Let I = [t1,t2] be given and consider the action functional AI

DEFINITION 12. A function y ∈H 1(I) is called minimal with respect to ﬁxed boundary
conditions on I = [t1,t2], if AI
h(z) ⩾AI
h(y) for all z ∈H 1(I) equal to y at t1 and t2.

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
567
A function y ∈H 1
loc(R) is called a minimal if it is minimal with respect to ﬁxed boundary
conditions on every interval. Finally, a function y ∈H 1([0,qT ]) is minimal with respect
to condition (43) if, for I = [0,qT ], AI
h(z) ⩾AI
h(y) for all z ∈H 1([0,qT ]) satisfying
condition (46).
Notice that the direct method of the calculus of variations easily implies that, for h ∈
CT ,
minimal solutions with respect to ﬁxed boundary conditions on a given interval I always
exist, are of class C2, and satisfy Equation (23). From Theorem 29, the same is true for the
functions which are minimal with respect to condition (43). In particular those minimals
have no corners, a fact which is useful in several proofs.
The existence of minimals is not clear from the direct methods of the calculus of varia-
tions, and will follow from a delicate sequence of arguments. We ﬁrst give some properties
of the minimals [38]. The ﬁrst one deals with the possible intersections of two different
minimals.
LEMMA 14. Two different minimals can intersect at most once, and are not tangent to
each other anywhere. Two different minimals which are C1 asymptotic as t →∞cannot
intersect at all.
The non-tangency is a consequence of the uniqueness of the Cauchy problem. The
ﬁrst intersection property is proved by contradiction, assuming that two minimals y and
z intersect twice in the interior of some interval I, and noticing that if y∗= min(y,z),
z∗= max(y,z), then

h(y) + AI
h(z),
so that AI
h(y∗) = AI
h(y), y∗is minimal and hence y and z must intersect tangentially and
be identical. The asymptotic property follows from the fact that up to an arbitrarily small
error, asymptoticity counts like an intersection.
LEMMA 15. The following statements are equivalent for y ∈H 1
loc(R).
(a) y is minimal and satisﬁes (43);
(b) y is minimal with respect to condition (43);
(c) y is minimal with respect to condition
y(t + NqT ) = y(t) + 2Npπ
for some positive integer N.
To prove that (b) ⇔(c), let z be minimal in the sense of (c) and y minimal in the sense
of (b). The translate v(t) = z(t + qT ) −2πp must intersect z at least once because, if not,
one gets inductively a contradiction with the condition in (c). By the periodicity conditions

568
J. Mawhin
v and z intersect inﬁnitely many times and hence coincide. Thus z(t + qT ) = z(t) + 2πp,
and

implying (b) ⇔(c). It is easy to show that (c) ⇔(a). That (a) ⇔(b) is equivalent to
showing that all minimals y with ﬁxed boundary conditions verifying (43) yield the same
action over one period. If not the difference between the two actions increases indeﬁnitely
with the number of periods but remains bounded by minimality on the corresponding large
interval.
If y is minimal, the same is true for any of its translates y(t −qT ) + 2pπ. They corre-
spond to the same orbit on the torus R/2πZ × T Z parametrized by the (y,t) coordinates.
The following lemma shows that there are no self-intersections on this torus.
LEMMA 16. A minimal y(t) does not intersect any of its translates y(t −qT ) + 2pπ.
There can be at most one intersetion, say at t0 and w.l.g. we can assume that y(t +
qT ) < y(t) + 2pπ for t > t0 and y(t + qT ) > y(t) + 2pπ for t < t0. Let ξ(t) = y(t) −
p
q ωt and ξn(t) = ξ(t + qnT ). It is easy to show that for t > t0 (respectively t < t0) the
sequence (ξn(t)) (respectively (ξ−n(t))) is decreasing and that one of the two sequences
is bounded from below, say (ξn(t)). Its limit η(t) as n →∞satisﬁes, by construction,
η(t +qT ) = η(t). Now, from the differential equation satisﬁed by ξ(t), one gets that |ξ′′(t)|
is bounded on the real line and the boundedness of |ξ(t)| on [t0,+∞[ follows from the
above reasoning. Then the same is true for |ξ′(t)| and Arzela–Ascoli theorem applied to
(ξn) implies its convergence in the C1-topology. As ξn and ξn−1 have the same limit η, y
and its translate are C1-asymptotic, a contradiction to the existence of the intersection t0.
THEOREM 31. Every minimal y has a rotation number

Using Lemma 16 and Denjoy theory for mappings on the circle applied to the conjugate of
the Poincaré mapping over [0,T ] with respect to the projection on the ﬁrst component of
the phase space, restricted to its translates, one obtains the existence of some α such that

To obtain the inequalities, notice that, as h ∈

Using inequality (50), inequalities (48) and (49) easily follow.
We can now prove the existence of minimals.
THEOREM 32. For every α ∈R, there exists a minimal with rotation number α. Further-
more, C1-limits (in the sense of uniform convergence of the function and its derivative on
compact subsets of R) of minimals are minimals, and the rotation number is continuous
(i.e., if a sequence of minimals (yn) with corresponding rotation numbers (αn) converge to
a minimal y with rotation number α in the C1-topology, then α = limn→∞αn).
The result follows from Theorem 29 and Lemma 15 when α is rational. If α =
limn→∞
pn
qn is irrational, let yn be a minimal for the boundary conditions
yn(t + qnT ) = yn(t) + 2πpn
such that (translation invariance) |yn(0)| ⩽2π. For t ∈[−R,R], Theorem 31 yields esti-

with M independent of t and n, which gives, by Ascoli–Arzela theorem some C1([−R,R])-
converging subsequence and by a diagonal procedure a subsequence which converges C1
on every compact interval to some limit y. Such a y is minimal with rotation number α.
4.3. Mather set
We now restrict to the case where α is irrational.
THEOREM 33. The translates y(t + jT ) −2kπ of a minimal y are totally ordered. The
ordering is the same as the ordering of jα −k, and is independent of y.
The mapping (j,k) 
→jα −k is one-to-one and we may write
y(t + jT ) −2kπ := u(t|β),
β = jα −k,
with u(t|·) so deﬁned for a dense set of reals β and strictly monotone in β. It can therefore
be easily extended to all real β by
u+(t|β) := lim
γ →β+u(t|γ ),
u−(t|β) := lim
γ →β−u(t|γ ),
DEFINITION 13. The Mather sets Mα and Mα(t) of Equation (23) are deﬁned by
M±
α = u±(·|β): β ∈R,
M±
α (t) = u±(t|β): β ∈R,
Mα = M+
α ∪M−
α ,
Mα(t) = M+
α (t) ∪M−
α (t).
It can be shown that they do not depend upon the minimal y chosen for their construction
and that they have the following properties.
THEOREM 34. The Mather sets have the following properties.
(1) Mα(t) is invariant under the Poincaré map y(t) 
→y(t + T ) and the translation
y 
→y + 2π.
(2) Mα(t) is closed without isolated points.
(3) Mα(t) does not contain any nonempty closed strict subset invariant under Poincaré
map and translation.
(4) Mα(t) is either R or is nowhere dense.
(5) Mα consists of trajectories of some vector ﬁeld y′ = ψ(y,t) deﬁned either on a
Cantor-like part or on the whole of the (y,t)-plane.
Hai Huang has proved in [57], for pendulum-type equations, the generic existence of
invariant cantori (minimal orbits deﬁning a Cantor set on the torus).

5. KAM theory and Lagrange stability
5.1. Twist mappings
The existence of quasi-periodic solutions to the forced pendulum can be obtained by ap-
plying to the Poincaré’s operator some theorem for twist mappings, that we recall now.
Let A = S1 × [a,b] be an annulus in R2, and φ :A →R2 a mapping with lift (40).
Moser’s twist theorem [87] can be stated as follows.
LEMMA 17. Let l ⩾5, β ∈C5(R) be such that |β′(r)| ⩾ν > 0 for all r ∈[a,b], let ε > 0,
and let α be an irrational number satisfying the Diophantine conditions




α −m
n




 ⩾γ n−τ,
for some positive γ,τ, and all integers n > 0, m. Then there exists δ = δ(ε,l,α) > 0 such
that each area-preserving mapping φ :A →R2 whose lift (40), with f,g ∈Cl, is such that
|f −β|Cl + |g −r|Cl < νδ,
possesses an invariant curve of the form
θ = τ + w(τ),
r = c + z(τ),
in A, where w,z are of class C1, 1-periodic, |w|C1 + |z|C1 < ε, c ∈]a,b[, on which φ
takes the form τ →τ + α.
The following result has been proved independently by Levi [66] and by Moser [89,94],
using Moser twist theorem.
THEOREM 35. Assume that h ∈
CT . For any α ∈]0,1[ satisfying the set of Diophantine
inequalities

γ
n2+μ ,
for some γ > 0 and μ > 0, and all integers m,n with n > 0, there exists an integer k0 =
k0(γ,μ) such that the Poincaré mapping associated to (23) possesses, for all integers k
with |k| ⩾k0, a countable set of invariant curves r = fα+k(θ) ≡fα+k(θ + 2π).
Physically, the solutions correspond to quasiperiodic rotations with average angular ve-
locity ω+k. The basic idea of the proof is that, for large velocities y′, the forced pendulum
equation has solutions which are close to those of the integrable system y′′ = 0. One ﬁrst
shows that, because of condition ¯h = 0, the Poincaré map P is exact on the phase cylinder
{(y,z) ∈S1 ×R} (i.e.,

C0 zdy =

C1 zdy if C0 is an arbitrary noncontractible circle going

572

once around the cylinder and C1 its image under P). Then one shows that P is C4-close
to a twist mapping for large y′, namely
P1(θ,r) = θ + r + 
H + r1(θ,r),
P2(θ,r) = r + r2(θ,r),
where 
H =

0 h(τ)dτ dt and ∥r1∥C4 + ∥r2∥C4 < C|z|−1.
Independently, and by the same approach, Jiangong You [130] has proved a similar
result, and has completed it as follows.
Notice that an invariant curve with rotation number α of the Poincaré mapping of Equa-
tion (23) give rise to an invariant torus with rotation numbers (1,α) in the extended phase
space S1 × R × R of the corresponding (t,y,y′).
THEOREM 36. Equation (23) has an invariant torus if and only if h ∈
CT . If it is the case,
there exists α∗> 0 such that, for every irrational number α > α∗satisfying the Diophan-
tine condition




α −m

 >
γ
n5/2 ,
for all integers m and n with n > 0, and some γ > 0, Equation (23) has an invariant torus
with rotation number (1,α).
The necessity is proved by observing that the Calabi invariant of P, deﬁned by C(P) =

P(γ ) r dθ −
γ r dθ, where γ is a circle in R × S1 homotopic to a circle {r} × S1, is equal
to ¯h. Thus, if P possesses an invariant closed curve which is homotopic to {r} × S1, one
has C(P) = 0, and hence ¯h = 0.
We now show that those results imply a property called Lagrange stability, answering a
question raised by Moser in the Introduction of [87].
DEFINITION 14. Equation (23) is called Lagrange stable if any solution of (14) is bounded
over R in the phase cylinder {(y mod 2π,y′)}.
Physically, this means that any solution of (14) has angular velocity bounded over R.
The Lagrange stability is a consequence of the results of Levi and Moser described above.
See also [67].
THEOREM 37. If h ∈
CT , then for any sufﬁciently large N > 0, there exists M = M(N)
such that any solution y(t) of Equation (23) with |y′(0)| ⩽M satisﬁes |y′(t)| ⩽N for all
t ∈R.
Independently, You [130] also proved the Lagrange stability of (23) and completed the
result as follows.
THEOREM 38. Equation (23) is Lagrange stable if and only if h ∈
CT .

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
573
Indeed, if ¯h = 0, then, from Theorem 36, Equation (23) has an invariant torus with
rotation number (1,α) for inﬁnitely many sufﬁciently large irrational numbers α. Letting
u = −y, v = −z, Equation (23) becomes
u′′ + a sin u = −h(t),
and has an invariant torus with rotation number (1,α) for inﬁnitely many sufﬁciently large
irrational numbers α. Thus Equation (23) has an invariant torus with rotation number
(1,−α). One uses two such invariant tori to conﬁne any solutions in their interior. To
prove the necessity, one shows, using the estimates on P, that Equation (23) has a solution
with y′ unbounded if ¯h ̸= 0.
The destruction of invariant tori with rotation number (1,ω) and ω a Liouville irrational
in pendulum-type equations has been considered by Hai Huang [56].
Let us notice the Mather’s theory of previous section can also be expressed in the frame
of mappings on an annulus, which enlightens its relation with KAM theory. We keep the
notations of Section 3.8.
DEFINITION 15. φ :A →A is a monotone twist homeomorphism if it preserves orienta-
tion, preserves boundary components of A and if its lift (40) is such that f (θ,·) is strictly
monotone for each θ. For deﬁniteness, we assume it to be increasing.
Let F j(θ,r) = (θj,rj), and
αr(φ) = lim
j→∞
θj
j
be its rotation number. The twist interval of φ, [αa(φ),αb(φ)], is deﬁned up to an integral
translation.
If φq(z) = z, then F q(θ,r) = (θ + 2pπ,r), for some integer p determined up to a
multiple of q.
p
q is the rotation number of z. One calls a point z = (θ,r) a Birkhoff point of type (p,q)
if there exists a sequence (θn,rn)n∈Z such that (θ0,r0) = (θ,r), θn+1 > θn, (θn+q,rn+q) =
(θn + 2π,rn+q), (θn+q,rn+q) = F(θn,rn) (n ∈N). One has Birkhoff’s twist theorem [16].
LEMMA 18. Let φ :A →A be an area-preserving monotone twist homeomorphism and
p
q ∈

αa(φ),αb(φ)

,
with p,q relatively prime. Then φ has at least two Birkhoff points of type (p,q).
The situation is different for α irrational.

574
J. Mawhin
DEFINITION 16. A Mather set of rotation number α for F is a closed invariant set for F
with representation θ = u(τ),r = v(τ), where u is monotone increasing, u −Id and v are
1-periodic (not necessarily continuous !), and
u(τ + α) = u(τ) + f

u(τ),v(τ)

,
v(τ + α) = g

u(τ),v(τ)

.
One has the Aubry–Mather’s twist theorem [7,69].
LEMMA 19. Let φ :A →A be an area-preserving monotone twist homeomorphism and
let α ∈[αa(φ),αb(φ)] be irrational. Then there exists an invariant Mather set Γα with
rotation number α. Furthermore, Γα is a subset of a closed curve r = γ (θ) where γ is
2π-periodic and Lipschitz continuous, i.e., v(τ) = γ (u(τ)).
When u and v are continuous, Γα deﬁnes a Lipschitz continuous invariant curve. When
u and v have countably many discontinuities, Γα can be seen as a Cantor set on the curve
r = γ (θ).
5.2. Chaotic dynamics
We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of chaotic dynamics.
DEFINITION 17. Equation (23) displays chaotic dynamics if
(i) the solutions of Equation (23) depend sensitively on the initial conditions;
(ii) Equation (23) has inﬁnitely many periodic solutions with diverging periods;
(iii) Equation (23) has an uncountable number of bounded, nonperiodic solutions;
(iv) the Poincaré map associated to Equation (23) has positive topological entropy.
The following deﬁnition is due to Serra, Tarallo and Terraccini [121]. Without loss of
generality we take T = 1. Let n ⩾1 be an integer, h ∈
C1, and

DEFINITION 18. y0 and y1 are consecutive minimizers of Ah on H 1
n if
(1) Ah,n(y0) = Ah,n(y1) = minH 1n Ah,n := ch,n.
(2) y0(t) < y1(t) for all t ∈[0,n].
(3) y ∈H 1
n ∩[y0,y1] and Ah,n(y) = ch,n imply y ∈{y0,y1}.
This notion is weaker than the isolatedness or nondegeneracy of minimizers in the vari-
ational sense.
Write y(±∞) = u if limt→±∞(y(t) −u(t)) = 0, and, following an idea of Rabinowitz

S(y0,y1) ̸= I
and
S(y1,y0) ̸= I,
(53)
then Equation (23) displays chaotic dynamics.
A ﬁrst important step in proving the above theorem, which is interesting in itself, is the fol-
lowing existence result for heteroclinic (or one-bump) solutions between two consecutive
minimizers y0 and y1 on H 1
1 .
PROPOSITION 6. Let c0 = infΓ (y0,y1) J, c1 = infΓ (y1,y0) J. There exists q0 ∈Γ (y0,y1)
and q1 ∈Γ (y1,y0) such that J(q0) = c0, J(q1) = c1. The functions q0 and q1 solve Equa-
tion (23).
A second step is the existence of multi-bump solutions. One makes the convention that the
indices in y,c,q,... have to be taken mod 2.
PROPOSITION 7. Assume that y0 and y1 are two consecutive minimizers of Ah over H 1
1
and that condition (53) holds. Then, for every sufﬁciently small δ > 0, there exists m =

From this result, one deduces the existence of solutions with inﬁnitely many bumps.
PROPOSITION 8. Assume that y0 and y1 are two consecutive minimizers of Ah over H 1
1
and that condition (53) holds. Then, for every sufﬁciently small δ > 0, there exists m =
m(δ) ∈N such that for every sequence (pi)i∈Z such that pi+1 −pi ⩾4m, there exists a
classical solution q of Equation (23) satisfying
y0(t) < q(t) < y1(t)
(t ∈R),
and


q(pi −m) −yi(pi −m)


 ⩽δ,


q(pi + m) −yi+1(pi + m)


 ⩽δ
(i ∈Z).
Notice that, by choosing the points pi in a periodic way, a slight modiﬁcation of the
argument gives the existence of inﬁnitely many periodic solutions of Equation (23) with
arbitrary large period. Notice also that is has been shown in [21] that condition (53) is
weaker than the standard transversality assumption.
A natural question is to see for which h is assumption (53) satisﬁed. A result in this
direction has been given in [22,23]. Let

endowed with the L∞-topology.
THEOREM 40. There exists a dense subset H of 
C such that for every h ∈H, Equa-
tion (23) displays chaotic dynamics. Moreover, for all n ∈N, H ∩
H 1
n is open in 
H 1
n.
To prove this theorem, one ﬁrst refers to Theorem 10 to prove the result in a simpliﬁed
setting. If h ∈
Cn, y ∈H 1
n is a true minimizer for Ah,n over H 1
n if Ah,n(y) = ch,n and
¯y ∈[0,2π[.

that Ah,n has only one nondegenerate true minimizer over H 1

Taking then h ∈Hn, ﬁxing k ∈N and h1 ∈
H 1

y′′ + a sin y = h(t) + εh1(t)
(54)
for ε small, yε
0 its true minimizer and yε

0 + 2π. Regularity estimates are obtained on
some associated heteroclinic orbits, using in particular a Lyapunov–Schmidtargument, and
this regularity is used to compute some analogue of a primitive of the Melnikov function,
in the line of [3].
Similar results have been obtained by Ofﬁn and Yu Hongfan [97].

6. Bounded forcing
6.1. Bounded functions and their averages
T -periodic functions are special cases of bounded functions.
DEFINITION 19. The function p :R →R is called bounded if there exists M > 0 such
that, for all t ∈R, |p(t)| ⩽M.
The concept of mean value of a T -periodic function has been extended by Tineo [124]
to some classes of functions containing the bounded ones.
DEFINITION 20. Let p = p∗+ p∗∗:R →R be continuous,with p∗∗bounded and p∗
having a bounded primitive. The lower (respectively upper) average of p is deﬁned by
¯pL =
lim
r→+∞
inf

s
p(u)du,
(respectively
¯pU =
lim
r→+∞sup
t−s⩾r

 t

p(u)du).
It is easy to verify that
−∞< ¯pL ⩽¯pU < +∞,
¯pL = ¯p∗∗
L ,
¯pU = ¯p∗∗
U ,
and that, if p is continuous and T -periodic,
¯pL = ¯pU = ¯p.
Notice also that if p is continuous and T -periodic, then ¯p = 0 if and only if p has a T -
periodic primitive.
6.2. A necessary condition for the existence of bounded solutions
Let g :R × R →R be bounded over R × [−r,r] for each r > 0 and continuous, and con-
sider the differential equation
y′′ + cy′ = g(t,y).
(55)
DEFINITION 21. A solution y :R →R of Equation (55) is said to be bounded if y and y′
are bounded.

578
J. Mawhin
Consider the dissipative forced pendulum-type equation
y′′ + cy′ + a siny = h(t),
(56)
where a > 0, c ⩾0, and h:R →R is continuous and bounded. It is easy to extend Propo-
sition 1 to bounded forcings and bounded solutions.
PROPOSITION 10. If Equation (56) has a bounded solution, then
−a ⩽¯hL ⩽¯hU ⩽a.
(57)
To show this result, one notices that, if y is a bounded solution of (56), one has, for each
t > s,
y′(t) −y′(s)
t −s
+ cy(t) −y(s)
t −s

and, given ε > 0, one can ﬁnd T0 such that, for all T ⩾T0 and all t,s such that t −s ⩾T,
one has
−ε ⩽y(t) −y(s)
t −s
⩽ε,
−ε ⩽y′(t) −y′(s)
t −s
⩽ε.
Consequently, for t −s ⩾T, we get
−(1 + c)ε −a ⩽

t −s
 t
s
h(τ)dτ ⩽(1 + c)ε + a,
and (57) follows easily.
6.3. Sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of bounded solutions
The following existence result for bounded solutions of Equation (55) goes back Opial [98]
(see also [80]).
LEMMA 20. If there exists r−< r+ such that
g(t,r−) ⩽0 ⩽g(t,r+)
for all t ∈R, then Equation (55) has at least one bounded solution such that
r−⩽y(t) ⩽r+
for all t ∈R.

Global results for the forced pendulum equation
579
The ﬁrst easy consequence for Equation (56) is the one-dimensional case of a result for
elliptic partial differential equations due to Fournier, Szulkin and Willem [48].
THEOREM 41. If c ⩾0 and if
−a ⩽h(t) ⩽a,
(58)
for all t ∈R, Equation (56) has at least one bounded solution y such that
π
2 ⩽y(t) ⩽3π
2
for all t ∈R.
REMARK 1. It is clear that condition (58) implies condition (57).
Another existence result, ﬁrst proved in [81], follows from applying Lemma 20 to an
equivalent formulation for the forced pendulum problem together with the following result
of Ortega on bounded solutions of second order linear equations [103] (see also [80]). We
deﬁne as usual the oscillation oscRz of the function z:R →R by
oscR z = sup
R
z −inf
R z.
LEMMA 21. If c > 0 and h:R →R is continuous, then equation
y′′ + cy′ = h(t)
(59)
has a bounded solution if and only if h has a bounded primitive. If it is the case, any
bounded solution y of Equation (59) veriﬁes the inequality
oscR y ⩽1
c oscR H,
(60)
where
H(t) =
 t
0
h(s)ds.
Furthermore, for each h with bounded primitive, Equation (59) has a unique (symmetrized)
bounded solution Hc such that
sup
R
Hc = −inf
R Hc = 1
2 oscR Hc.
(61)

THEOREM 42. If c > 0, h = h∗+ h∗∗where h∗∗is bounded and h∗has a bounded prim-
itive over R, and if inequalities

c ⩽π,
(62)

hold, where H ∗
c is the symmetrized bounded solution of y′′ + cy′ = h∗(t), then Equa-
tion (56) has at least one solution y such that
π
2 + H ∗
c (t) ⩽y(t) ⩽3π
2 + H ∗
c (t),
for all t ∈R. When c = 0, the above result holds if h∗∗= 0, h = h∗has a second primitive
H 1 bounded over R and H ∗
c is replaced by H 1 in (67).
To prove this theorem, one sees that y is a bounded solution of Equation (56), if and
only if z deﬁned by
y(t) = z(t) + H ∗
c (t),
is a bounded solution of equation
z′′ + cz′ + a sinz + H ∗
c (t) = h∗∗(t).
(64)
One checks easily that the conditions of Lemma 20 hold for r−= π/2 and r+ = 3π/2.
REMARK 2. If follows from inequality (60) that, given h = h∗+h∗∗, condition (62) holds
as soon as
c ⩾1
π oscR H ∗.
Consequently, when h has a bounded primitive, Equation (56) has a bounded solution for
all sufﬁciently large c. The question remains open for other values of c.
6.4. Local uniqueness of bounded solutions
By straightening the assumptions of Theorems 41 and 42, one obtains the local uniqueness
of the obtained bounded solutions by using a maximum principle proved in [19].

LEMMA 22. Let α > 0, β ∈R and γ :R →R bounded and continuous. If the function
r ∈C2(R,R) is bounded together with its ﬁrst two derivatives and satisﬁes the differential
inequality
r′′(t) ⩾γ (t)r′(t) + αr(t) −β,
then
sup

r ⩽β

LEMMA 23. Let c ∈R and f :R →R be bounded, continuous and such that
f (t) ⩽−δ < 0
for all t ∈R. Then the unique bounded solution of equation
y′′ + cy′ + f (t)y = 0
is the trivial one.
THEOREM 43. If c ⩾0 and if
∥h∥∞< a,
(65)
holds, there exists ε > 0 such that Equation (56) has a unique solution y such that
π
2 + ε ⩽y(t) ⩽3π
2 −ε
(66)
for all t ∈R.
This result follows from the fact that for some sufﬁciently small ε > 0, r−= π
2 + ε and
r+ = 3π
2 −ε satisfy the condition of Lemma 20 and that cosu ⩽−δ for some δ > 0 when
u ∈[r−,r+]. The uniqueness then follows from Lemma 23.
THEOREM 44. If c > 0, h = h∗+ h∗∗where h∗∗is bounded and h∗has a bounded prim-
itive over R, and if inequalities

H 1 bounded over R and H ∗
c is replaced by H 1 in (67).
The proof follows lines similar to that of Theorem 43.
7. Almost periodic forcings
7.1. Almost periodic functions
An interesting intermediate class between the bounded and the periodic functions is the
class of almost periodic solutions in the sense of H. Bohr [44].
DEFINITION 22. f :R →R is (Bohr)-almost periodic if, for each ε > 0, there exists
L > 0 such that any interval of length L contains at least some τ such that ∀t ∈R,
|f (t + τ) −f (t)| < ε.
Such a function is necessarily bounded and uniformly continuous over R. The following
result gives an alternative deﬁnition of the space AP(R) of (Bohr)-almost periodic func-
tions. Let us denote by TP(R) the space of real trigonometric polynomials
pN(t) =
N

k=−N
pk exp(iλkt),
where pk = ¯p−k and λk ∈R (−N ⩽k ⩽N).
LEMMA 24. The space AP(R) is the closure of TP(R) for the uniform norm over R.
If f ∈AP(R) and λ ∈R, the limit
fλ := lim
T →∞
1
T
 T
0
f (t)exp(−iλt)dt
exists, ¯fλ = f−λ, and the set Λ of λ ∈R for which fλ ̸= 0 is at most countable. The series

λ:fλ̸=0
fλ exp(iλt)
(70)

is called the Fourier series associated to f. The Fourier coefﬁcient
f0 = lim
T →∞
1
T
 T
0
f (t)dt
is called the mean value of f. If f has an almost-periodic primitive, then f0 = 0, but, in
contrast to the periodic case, an almost periodic function with mean value zero needs not
to have an almost-periodic primitive. It is only the case if its primitive is itself bounded.
More general classes of almost periodic functions have been deﬁned by Besicovitch
[14]. If p ∈TP(R) deﬁne ∥p∥B2 by
∥p∥B2 =

limsup
T →∞

and deﬁne B2(R) to be the space of equivalence classes of functions f : R →R such that
limn→∞∥f −pn∥B2 = 0 for some sequence (pn) in TP(R), under the equivalence relation
f ∼g
⇔
∥f −g∥B2 = 0.
(71)
If f and g belong to B2(R), and λ ∈R, one can show that the limits

exist and that fλ ̸= 0 on an at most countable set, so that the Fourier series (70) of f is
well deﬁned. Because of the fact that two functions in the same equivalence class for (71)
can differ on a set of positive and even of inﬁnite measure, the use of B2(R) in the study
of differential equations gives rather weak existence assertions. Work in this direction for
Equation (56) has been done by Belley, Fournier and Saadi Drissi [11,12], who have also
considered some subspaces of B2(R) whose functions behave more like periodic ones.
7.2. Almost periodic solutions
Combining some results on the existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions over R with
Amerio’s criterion on the existence of almost periodic solutions (see, e.g., [44]), Fink [43]
has given in 1968 some partial extension of the method of upper and lower solutions to
almost periodic solutions. A special case of his results is the following proposition.

584
J. Mawhin
LEMMA 25. Let c ∈R, g ∈C1(R,R) and h be continuous and almost periodic. Assume
that there exist r−< r+ such that g′(x) > 0 for all x ∈[r−,r+], and
g(r−) + h(t) ⩽0 ⩽g(r+) + h(t)
for all t ∈R. Then equation
y′′ + cy′ = g(y) + h(t)
has a unique almost periodic solution y such that a ⩽y(t) ⩽b for all t ∈R.
Notice that, as shown by Ortega and Tarallo [109], the monotonicity condition on g cannot
be dropped in Lemma 25.
Lemma 25 implies the following existence theorem [81], also proved independently by
Fournier, Szulkin and Willem [48] as a special case of a more general result for elliptic
partial differential equations. When c = 0, Theorem 45 generalizes an earlier approximate
solvability result of Blot [17] for Equation (23), based upon variational techniques and con-
vex analysis, which only provides the existence for a dense subset of forcing functions h.
THEOREM 45. For each c ⩾0 and each h ∈AP(R) such that ∥h∥∞< a, Equation (56)
has a unique solution y ∈AP(R) such that π/2 < y(t) < 3π/2 for all t ∈R.
Indeed, the condition upon ∥h∥∞implies the existence of ε > 0 such that a = π
2 +ε and
b = 3π
2 −ε satisfy the conditions of Lemma 13.
Similar arguments applied to the equivalent formulation of the forced pendulum equa-
tion lead to the following existence theorem, ﬁrst proved in [81]. When c = 0, Theorem 46
generalizes an earlier approximate solvability result of Blot [18] for Equation (23), based
upon variational techniques and convex analysis, which gives existence for a dense subset
of forcing functions h only. Subsequently, Blot and Pennequin [20] have extended Blot’s
result to the case of quasi-periodic forcing terms.
THEOREM 46. If c > 0, h = h∗+ h∗∗where h∗∗is almost periodic and h∗has an almost
periodic primitive, and if conditions (67) and (68) are satisﬁed, then there exists ε > 0
such that Equation (56) has a unique almost periodic solution verifying inequality (69).
If c = 0, and h ∈C has an almost periodic second primitive H 1 satisfying (67) with H ∗
c
replaced by H 1, then the same conclusion holds.
The following result of Lagrange unstability-type for almost periodic forcings has been
proved by Hai Huang [58].
THEOREM 47. Equation (23) possesses inﬁnitely many unbounded solutions on a cylinder
S1 × R for any almost periodic h with nonvanishing mean value.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
593
1. Introduction
The main subject of this note is the retract method introduced by Tadeusz Wa˙zewski. It
is a method of proving the existence of solutions which remain in a given set and refers
to differential equations describing some evolution in time. The sets under consideration
should satisfy the condition “all egress points are strict” or its less restrictive variant. Now
they are called Wa˙zewski sets. The method is based on theorems which roughly assert that
there is a solution contained a Wa˙zewski set for all positive values of time if the subset of
egress points is not a retract of the whole set (which explains the name of the method). If,
moreover, the set is compact then its invariant part (i.e., the set of full solutions contained
in it) is nonempty. For isolating blocks, i.e., compact Wa˙zewski sets which do not contain
any full solutions intersecting their boundaries, Charles Conley discovered a homotopical
invariant which provides a quantitative information on their invariant parts. It is called
the Conley index. The Conley index theory, both from a point of view of continuous and
discrete-time dynamical systems, was presented by Mischaikow and Mrozek in Chapter 9
of Handbook of Dynamical Systems, vol. 2, within the current series of handbooks edited
by Elsevier Science B.V. (see [50]).
In this note we describe the Wa˙zewski method in details and provide an information on
foundations of the Conley index theory which directly relates to the method and essentially
does not overlap with the exposition of Mischaikow and Mrozek. We begin with a short
introduction to the method and to the theory related to the index in a historical context.
1.1. Historical background of topological methods
The modern understanding of mechanics begins since the fundamental research of Newton
in the XVII century. In order to formulate the rules of motion, Newton introduced the con-
cept of differential equation. The equations which appear in mechanics belong mainly to
the class of ordinary differential equations. They are characterized by a distinguished para-
meter interpreted as time and, if some regularity conditions are imposed, the initial data de-
termine the whole solution. It was clear from the beginning that in general one cannot ﬁnd
analytical formulas for such solutions. Instead of rigorous description, numerical meth-
ods usually provide satisfactory approximations of solutions in bounded time-intervals.
Possibility of calculation of such approximations contributed mainly to the successful de-
velopment of applied mechanics.
However, numerical methods fail in general if one is interested in the global behavior
of the solution, i.e., in the whole domain, up to the left and right range of time of its
existence. For a given initial data, usually it is impossible to determine whether the solution
represents a periodic motion and to predict the asymptotic behavior at the limits of its
existence. As it was observed by Henri Poincaré at the end of the XIX century, the behavior
of solutions can be very complicated and have a chaotic character, hence one cannot expect
to determine the full information on the dynamics generated by a given equation. Even a
proof of the existence of a solution with prescribed behavior (periodic, almost-periodic,
bounded, chaotic, satisfying some boundary conditions, etc.) is usually a difﬁcult task.

R. Srzednicki
Poincaré initiated systematic studies on the global understanding of solutions and dy-
namics, which are known under the name of qualitative theory of differential equations, or,
in a more general context, theory of dynamical systems. Besides analytical arguments he
used methods of topology and algebra. Research on limit cycles and indexes of zeroes of
planar vector ﬁelds, periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems (in particular, based on his
“twist theorem”), and stability of the Solar system belong to his most known results on that
ﬁeld. He also contributed essentially in the development of variational methods applied to
boundary value problems.
One of the greatest achievements of Poincaré was the introduction of algebraic topology
(called by him “analysis situs”). Among the results which were proved by its applica-
tion, there were the ﬁxed point theorems of L.E.J. Brouwer (1912) and Salomon Lefschetz
(1923) which found natural applications in the qualitative theory of differential equations.
Brouwer introduced also the concept of the degree of a vector-ﬁeld. A related notion of the
ﬁxed point index was invented later by Jean Leray. The Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem and
the degree were generalized to the inﬁnite-dimensional case by Juliusz Schauder in 1930
and, respectively, by Leray and Schauder in 1934. Together with variational methods, they
form the main tools in proofs of results on existence of solutions of initial and boundary
value problems in nonlinear differential equations. The idea of their application consists
in suitable choice of an operator acting on a function space in which the original problem
reduces to the existence of its ﬁxed point or its zero. In variational methods, the existence
of a solution of the problem is equivalent to the existence of a critical point of a suitable
functional. An essential progress in development of these methods were done by Marston
Morse in 1925 who invented the theory of critical points which now bears his name and by
Lusternik and Schnirelmann by their research on the concept of category in 1930. It seems
that the next major achievement in topological approach to differential equations was done
by Tadeusz Wa˙zewski (1896–1972) by introducing the retract method in the middle of the
twentieth century.
1.2. An outline of the Wa˙zewski method in a historical context
The following deﬁnition provides the notion of a retract introduced by Karol Borsuk in the
paper [13] from 1931. Let X be a topological space and let A be its subset.
DEFINITION 1.1. A continuous map r :X →A such that r(a) = a for every a ∈A is
called a retraction. A is called a retract of X if there exists a retraction X →A. A con-
tinuous map r :X →A is called a strong deformation retraction if it is equal to the map
x 
→h(x,1), where h:X × [0,1] →X is a continuous map such that h(x,0) = x and
h(x,1) ∈A for every x ∈X, and h(a,t) = a for every a ∈A and t ∈[0,1]. A is called a
strong deformation retract of X if there exists a strong deformation retraction X →A.
Obviously, a strong deformation retract is also a retract and a retract of a connected
set is also connected. Moreover, it is well known that the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem is
equivalent to the fact that the unit sphere Sn−1 in Rn is not a retract of the closed unit
ball Bn.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index

In 1947, Wa˙zewski presented the paper [85] in which he proved a theorem on the exis-
tence of solutions which are contained in given set for all positive values of time. In the
contemporary used mathematical notation the theorem can be described as follows. As-
sume that v is a continuous vector-ﬁeld on M, where M is an open subset of Rn (it can be
a smooth manifold without boundary as well). We refer to M as to the phase-space. It is
assumed that through each point x0 of M passes a unique saturated solution t 
→φ(x0,t)
of the Cauchy problem
˙x = v(x),
(1.1)
x(0) = x0.
(1.2)
The map φ :(x,t) 
→φ(x,t) is a called local ﬂow; its purely topological description is
provided in Deﬁnition 2.1. Let us mention here that usually φ(x,t) is not deﬁned for all t
and by the trajectory (respectively, the positive semitrajectory, the negative semitrajectory)
of x we mean the set of all points φ(x,t) (respectively, the set of all points φ(x,t) with
t ⩾0, all points φ(x,t) with t ⩽0) whenever they are deﬁned.
Let V be an open subset of the phase space. Let x ∈∂V . Some types of behavior of the
trajectory of x with respect to V are described in the following
DEFINITION 1.2. x is called an egress point of V if there exists an ε > 0 such that
φ(x,t) ∈V for −ε < t < 0. If, moreover, φ(x,t) ∈\V for 0 < t < ε then x is called a
strict egress point. Symmetrically, by reversing t to −t, one deﬁnes an ingress point and a
strict ingress point. Finally, x is called an outward tangency point of V if there exists an
ε > 0 such that φ(x,t) ∈\V for t ∈(−ε,ε) and t ̸= 0.
The points distinguished in the above deﬁnition can be visualized on Figure 1, where
there are shown fragments of trajectories of some planar equation near the boundary of a
square. The open vertical sides of the square consist of strict egress points, the open hori-
zontal sides consists of strict ingress points, and the four vertices form the set of outward
tangency points.

Denote by E the set of egress points. There is a distinguished subset V ∗of V consisting
of points which escape from V in a positive time, i.e., points x ∈V for which there exists
a t > 0 such that φ(x,t) /∈V . For every x ∈V ∗one can assign the ﬁrst time in which it
gets the boundary of V . That time is called the escape-time of x and is denoted by σ(x);
by deﬁnition, it is a positive number such that φ(x,[0,σ(x))) ⊂V and φ(x,σ(x)) ∈E.
The latter point is called the consequent of x. Both notions are extended to E: for x ∈E
put σ(x) = 0 and deﬁne the consequent of x as x itself.
Let Y ⊂E and let Z ⊂V ∪Y. The main theorem [85, Theorem 1] is the following:
WA ˙ZEWSKI THEOREM. If all egress points are strict egress points and
• Z ∩Y is a retract of Y,
• Z ∩Y is not a retract of Z
then there exists an x0 ∈Z such that
• either the positive semitrajectory of x0 is contained in V
• or x0 ∈V ∗and the consequent of x0 belongs to E \ Y.
In particular, the second possibility in the conclusion is trivially excluded if Y = E
(compare [85, Theorem 2]). If we exchange egress points by ingress points in the statement
of the theorem, we obtain a result on the existence of a negative semitrajectory.
Originally, the Wa˙zewski method (or the retract method) consisted in applications of the
theorem in proofs of the existence of solutions representing some special properties, usu-
ally referred to its asymptotic behavior. As it was indicated in [85], a suitable choice of the
sets Z and Y leads also to proofs of the existence of solutions of some two-point boundary
value problems. In [85], Wa˙zewski pointed out also how to drop the assumption on the
uniqueness of the Cauchy problem if the considered set Z is compact and V is a polyfa-
cial set, which roughly means that it is described by some strong inequalities (compare
Sections 3.1 and 3.2).
In the following examples we illustrate the usability of the Wa˙zewski method.
EXAMPLE 1.1. Consider a planar equation given by
˙x = f (t,x,y),
˙y = g(t,x,y).
(1.3)
in the (x,y)-coordinates. Assume that
xf (t,x,y) > 0,
if t is arbitrary, |x| = 1, |y| ⩽1,
(1.4)
yg(t,x,y) < 0,
if t is arbitrary, |x| ⩽1, |y| = 1.
(1.5)
After extending the plane by the time variable, (1.3) provides an autonomous equation
represented by
˙t = 1,
˙x = f (t,x,y),
˙y = g(t,x,y)
(1.6)

in the coordinates of R3. Assume that the uniqueness of the Cauchy problem is guaranteed.
Put
V =:

(t,x,y) ∈R3: |x| < 1, |y| < 1

.
(1.7)
It is an inﬁnite rectangular tube which part is shown on Figure 2. It follows by the inequal-
ities (1.4) and (1.5) that the set of egress points
E :=

(t,x,y) ∈R3: |x| = 1, |y| < 1

(1.8)
consists of strict egress points. It forms two shaded sides of the tube on the ﬁgure. Let
Z :=

(0,x,0) ∈R3: |x| ⩽1

,
(1.9)
i.e., the black bar inside the plane {t = 0}. It follows that Z ∩E consists of two ends of Z,
hence it is not a retract of Z. On the other hand, each end is a retract of the corresponding
side, hence there is a retraction E →Z ∩E. It follows by the Wa˙zewski theorem that there
exists an x0, |x0| < 1 such that the solution (φ,ψ) of (1.3) with φ(0) = x0 and ψ(0) = 0,
satisﬁes


φ(t)


 < 1,


ψ(t)


 < 1
for each t ⩾0.
EXAMPLE 1.2. Consider the boundary-value problem
y(0) = x(1) = 0

associated to (1.3). It means that we are looking for a solution of (1.3) such that its second
coordinate at time 0 and the ﬁrst coordinate at time 1 are equal to zero. In order to solve
the problem we consider again the local ﬂow in R3 generated by (1.6). Now we put
V :=

(t,x,y) ∈R3: t < 1, |x| < 1, |y| < 1

.
(1.11)
The set of egress points of V is equal to
E :=

(t,x,y): t ⩽1, |x| = 1, |y| < 1

∪

(1,x,y): |x| ⩽1, |y| < 1

.
(1.12)
A fragment of V over the interval [0,1] is shown on Figure 3. It is the rectangular prism
and the corresponding fragment of E consists of its three sides. Let Z be the same as in
Example 1.1, i.e., given by (1.9). Put
Y := E \

(1,0,y): |y| < N

.
(1.13)
On the ﬁgure, Z is shown as the black bar and Y is represented by the shaded surface. It is
easy to see that Z ∩Y is not a retract of Z but it is a retract of Y. It follows by the Wa˙zewski
theorem that there exists x0 ∈(−1,1) such that the solution of (1.6) starting at (0,x0,0)
either remains in V or intersects E \ Y. Since ˙t = 1, the ﬁrst possibility is ruled out and,
moreover, the time in which the solution gets E \ Y is equal to 1. Thus it determines the
required solution of the boundary value problem (1.3), (1.10).
In the above examples we assumed the uniqueness of solutions of the Cauchy problem
associated to (1.3). Actually, that assumption can be dropped and still we can get the exis-

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
599
tence of solutions which remain in V in Example 1.3 and solve the boundary value problem
in Example 1.2. Indeed, if (1.3) does not satisfy the uniqueness property, one can ﬁnd ap-
proximating sequences of smooth functions {fn} and {gn} for f and g, respectively, such
that they satisfy the inequalities (1.4) and (1.5). The corresponding solutions obtained for
them by the Wa˙zewski theorem are determined by initial points zn ∈Z. Their accumulation
point z0 is the initial point of a required solution.
The Wa˙zewski theorem was announced also in [86,87], and later in the proceedings of
the Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam [89]. Its proof follows easily from a lemma
which asserts the continuity of the consequent map V ∗∪E →E provided the assumption
“all egress points are strict” is satisﬁed (compare [85, Lemma 3]). Actually, the lemma is
an immediate consequence of the following fact implicitly stated in the paper:
WA ˙ZEWSKI LEMMA. If all egress points are strict then the escape-time function
V ∗∪E ∋x →σ(x) ∈[0,∞)
is continuous.
The lemma has important consequences for the homotopy theory methods in differential
equations. At present, the name “Wa˙zewski method” refers also to arguments applying
Wa˙zewski lemma. Complete proofs of the Wa˙zewski theorem and related results will be
presented in Section 2.3.
In the years after publication of [85], the Wa˙zewski method was intensively developed
and applied by many authors. Both the assumptions on retraction and egress points in the
Wa˙zewski theorem were modiﬁed. Improved versions of the theorem using variants of the
notion of strong deformation retract were given, among others, in the papers [1,58,62]; the
proofs of those versions were based on the Wa˙zewski lemma. In Section 2.3, we provide
examples of such results. On the other hand, in [11] Bielecki observed that all results
concerning the Wa˙zewski method which are based on the hypothesis “all egress points
are strict” can be directly strengthen if strict egress points are replaced by strong egress
points. (In the above notation, an egress point x ∈E is called a strong egress point if for
every t > 0 there exists 0 < s < t such that φ(x,s) /∈V .) Later, in [20] (and also in [21])
Charles Conley (1933–1984) presented a version of the Wa˙zewski theorem with a more
general and convenient form of that assumption. He introduced the notion of the exit set
W −of an arbitrary set W (in a similar way as we deﬁned above the set of strong egress
points), and with its use, he deﬁned the concept of Wa˙zewski set. We provide its deﬁnition
later in Section 2.1. At this moment we mention that it is particularly easy to check in one
case: if W and W −are closed then W satisﬁes the deﬁnition of a Wa˙zewski set. Moreover,
referring to our previous consideration, the set V ∪E is a Wa˙zewski set provided each
egress point is a strong egress point; in that case E is its exit set. The main feature of
[21] was the observation that the Wa˙zewski lemma extends to Wa˙zewski sets: the escape-
time function σ :x 
→σ(x) deﬁned for points of W such that their positive semitrajectory
leaves W, is continuous. (Here, similarly as before, σ(x) denotes the ﬁrst time in which
the semitrajectory of x hits W −.) Our presentation of the results related to the Wa˙zewski
theorem in Section 2.3 is inspired by the ideas of Conley.

1.3. On the origin of the Conley index theory
The Wa˙zewski theorem, like the Schauder ﬁxed point theorem is an existence result. Com-
plementary to the Schauder theorem, the Leray–Schauder degree and the ﬁxed point in-
dex provide a quantitative information on the number of solutions. In some sense, similar
complementary quantitative information on solutions given by the Wa˙zewski method is
provided by the Conley index, a topological invariant related to Wa˙zewski sets of a special
form, called isolating blocks. By an isolating block we mean a compact subset B of the
phase space of a local ﬂow φ such that B = intB and every x ∈∂B is either a strict egress
point, or a strict ingress point, or a point of outward tangency of intB (its deﬁnition is
stated in Section 7.1 in a slightly more general form). An example of isolating block is
shown on Figure 1. For an isolating block B, its exit set B−consists of all strict egress and
outward tangency points. Because of the compactness of B, if some positive semitrajectory
is contained in B then its limit set is nonempty and also contained in B. Since the limit set
is invariant, it is contained in the invariant part of B
Inv(B) := x ∈B: φ(x,t) ∈B ∀t
which is nonempty in this case. The set Inv(B) is an example of an isolated invariant set,
i.e., a compact set which is maximal invariant in some of its neighborhood. (Obviously,
the block itself is such a neighborhood for Inv(B).) In the above sense, isolating blocks
have several other nice properties due to symmetry with respect to reversing the time-axis.
(Sometimes they are deﬁned only as compact Wa˙zewski sets which are simultaneously
isolating neighborhoods.)
The ﬁrst extensive research on isolating blocks for smooth ﬂows appeared in 1971 in the
paper [22] by Conley and Richard Easton. In that paper an important theorem was proved:
FIRST CONLEY THEOREM. Each isolated invariant set is an invariant part of some iso-
lating block.
Also in 1971, Conley announced another important theorem (compare [19]):
SECOND CONLEY THEOREM. If S is an isolated invariant set then the homotopy type
[B/B−,∗] of the pointed space obtained from B by collapsing B−to a point ∗, does not
depend on the choice of an isolating block B such that S = Inv(B).
(We refer to Section 5.2 for rigorous deﬁnitions of the notions involved in that state-
ment.) A proof of the second Conley theorem appeared later in [18] (on the ˇCech cohomol-
ogy level only) and in [21] in the full generality. Both the theorems ensure the correctness
of the following
DEFINITION 1.3. The Conley index of an isolated invariant set S, denoted by h(φ,S), is
deﬁned as the homotopy type [B/B−,∗] for an arbitrary isolating block B having S as the
invariant part.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
601
In the Conley’s publications the index appeared under the names homotopy index and
generalized Morse index. The origin of the later name is the Morse theory. If f :M →R
is a Morse function and φ is the (local) ﬂow generated by the gradient equation
˙x = −∇f (x)
then each critical point x0 of f is also an isolated invariant set for φ and its Conley index
h(φ,{x0}) is equal to the homotopy type of the pointed k-dimensional sphere Sk, where k
is the Morse index of x0. (Recall that the Morse index is deﬁned as the number of negative
eigenvalues of the Hessian of f at x0.) Thanks to the above relation between the indexes,
some results of the Morse theory were extended to the theory of isolated invariant sets.
A simple application of the Wa˙zewski lemma leads to the conclusion that if h(φ,S)
is nontrivial (i.e., it is not the homotopy type of a one-point space) then S is nonempty.
The converse is not true in general (see Example 9.5) and in this respect the Conley index
is not a better tool then the Wa˙zewski method. The Conley index has the additivity and
multiplicativity properties, which explain in which sense it “counts” solutions in S. The
main advantage of the index is its continuation property: two isolated invariant sets (with
respect to possibly different ﬂows) which can be linked by a kind of homotopy, have the
same Conley indices. This property is in an analogy to the homotopy properties of the
Brouwer and Leray–Schauder degrees, and the ﬁxed point index. It enables calculation of
the index in a complicated system by its continuation to a simpler one.
1.4. Review of the current exposition
Our exposition is rather self-contained; we present almost all necessary deﬁnitions and we
prove a majority of the stated results, although in a few cases we provide sketches of proofs
only.
In Section 2, we deﬁne the Wa˙zewski set (Deﬁnition 2.4), state its main properties
(Lemma 2.1) and state strong versions of the Wa˙zewski theorem: Theorem 2.1 valid for
local semiﬂows and Theorem 2.2, based on the notion of quasi-isotopic deformation re-
tract (Deﬁnition 2.7), valid for local ﬂows. Section 3 presents methods of construction
of Wa˙zewski sets for ordinary differential equations. In particular, so-called polyfacial sets
and generalized polyfacial sets are deﬁned (Deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.4). Moreover, a version of
the Wa˙zewski theorem for equations without the uniqueness property and differential inclu-
sions is stated (Theorem 3.1). The Wa˙zewski method for local semiﬂows generated by re-
tarded functional differential equations is described in Section 4, where the corresponding
main results are Theorems 4.1 and 4.2. Some topological concepts are recalled in Section 5.
They include the notions of the quotient space (Deﬁnition 5.1), the absolute and pointed
homotopy types (Deﬁnition 5.2), absolute neighborhood retract (Deﬁnition 5.3), relative
Lusternik–Schnirelmann category (Deﬁnition 5.6), and cup length (Deﬁnition 5.9). More-
over, we recall the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem (Proposition 5.6) and properties of the
ﬁxed point index (Proposition 5.7). In Section 6, we provide some general results on prop-
erties of the sets of solutions given by the Wa˙zewski method. In particular, Theorem 6.1
estimates their category and Theorem 6.2 is a result on the existence of stationary points.

602
R. Srzednicki
Section 7 presents the notion of isolating block (Deﬁnition 7.1) and its topological prop-
erties. The related results on the category (Theorem 7.1), exact sequences (Theorem 7.3),
cup-length (Theorem 7.4), stationary points of gradient-like local ﬂows (Theorem 7.5), and
ﬁxed point index (Theorem 7.6) are given. Moreover, we deﬁne the notion of an isolating
segment (Deﬁnition 7.4) and we prove Theorem 7.7, a related to that notion result on the
ﬁxed point index of the evolutionary map. In Section 8, we present three applications of
results stated in previous sections. The ﬁrst of them, Theorem 8.1, generalizes a result
of Perron on linear equations, the second one is a result on the existence of solutions of
two-point boundary value problems under the classical Bernstein–Nagumo condition (The-
orem 8.2), and the last one is a result on the existence of chaotic dynamics (Theorem 8.3).
An introduction to the Conley index theory is contained in Section 9. Deﬁnition 9.1 pro-
vides the notion of an isolated invariant set, Theorems 9.1 and 9.2 of Conley lead to the
deﬁnition of the index, and properties of the index are stated in Theorems 9.3 and 9.4.
Some calculations of the index are given in Propositions 9.1 and 9.2, and an example of
its applications is given in the proof of Proposition 9.3. Finally, in Section 9.4 we indicate
extensions and improvements of the Conley index.
The bibliography contains positions which usually directly refer to topics presented in
this note and by far it does not pretend to be the complete list of books and articles on
the Wa˙zewski method and the Conley index. We point out that biographical information
on Tadeusz Wa˙zewski and Charles Conley can be found in the articles [54] and, respec-
tively, [47].
2. Wa˙zewski method for local semiﬂows and ﬂows
In this section we introduce the notion of a Wa˙zewski set and we prove Wa˙zewski type
theorems in an abstract topological setting. For this reason we begin with the deﬁnitions of
the basic concepts of the theory of continuous-time dynamical systems.
2.1. Local semiﬂows and Wa˙zewski sets
Let X be a topological space.
DEFINITION 2.1. A local semiﬂow on X is a continuous map φ :D →X, where D is an
open subset of X × [0,∞) such that for every x ∈X the set {t ∈[0,∞): (x,t) ∈D} is
equal to an interval [0,ωx) for some 0 < ωx ⩽∞, if t ∈[0,ωx) then ωφ(x,t) = ωx −t and
the following equations hold:
φ(x,0) = x,
(2.1)
φ(x,s + t) = φ

φ(s,x),t

.
(2.2)
If D = X × [0,∞) then φ is called a semiﬂow.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
603
A local ﬂow is a again a continuous map φ :D →X, but now D is an open subset of
X × R, for every x ∈X the set {t: (x,t) ∈D} is equal to an open interval (αx,ωx), where
−∞⩽αx < 0 < ωx ⩽∞,
if t ∈(αx,ωx) then αφ(x,t) = αx −t and ωφ(x,t) = ωx −t, and Equations (2.1) and (2.2)
hold. Finally, if D = X × R then a local ﬂow is called a ﬂow.
Obviously, a restriction of a local ﬂow D →X to D ∩(X × [0,∞)) is a local semiﬂow.
Ordinary differential equations generate local ﬂows in a well-known way provided they are
autonomous and satisfy the uniqueness condition for solutions of the Cauchy problem. In a
similar way retarded functional differential equations (compare Section 4.1) and semilinear
parabolic equations generate local semiﬂows.
In the sequel we frequently use the following notation: we write φt(x) instead of φ(x,t)
and if A ⊂X and J ⊂R then we write φ(A,J) instead of φ(A × J).
In the following deﬁnitions we assume that φ is a local semiﬂow on X. Let x ∈X.
DEFINITION 2.2. The set
φ+(x) := φ

x,[0,ωx)

is called the positive semitrajectory of x. If, moreover, φ is a local ﬂow then the sets
φ(x) := φx,(αx,ωx),
φ−(x) := φ

x,(αx,0]

are called, respectively, the trajectory and the negative semitrajectory of x.
A map σ :R →X such that
σ(0) = x,
φt

σ(τ)

= σ(t + τ).
is called a full solution through x. A set A ⊂X is called invariant if for each x ∈A there
exists a full solution σ through x such that σ(R) ⊂A. The ω-limit set of x is deﬁned as
ω(x) :=

s∈[0,ωx)
φ

x,[s,ωx)

.
Obviously, if σ is a full solution through x then σ(τ) = φτ(x) for τ ⩾0 in the case of
a local semiﬂow and for τ ∈R in the case of a local ﬂow. If x is a stationary point (i.e.,
φ+(x) = {x}) then the constant map t 
→x is a full solution through x. More general, if x is
a periodic point (i.e., φT (x) = x for some T > 0) then the periodic extension of t 
→φt(x)
from [0,T ] to the whole R is also a full solution. It is easy to prove that if ω(x) ̸= ∅then
necessarily ωx = ∞and ω(x) is invariant.

Let φ be a local semiﬂow on X and let W ⊂X. Two subsets of W are distinguished:
W −:=

x ∈W: φ(x,[0,t]) ̸⊂W ∀t > 0

,
W ∗:=

x ∈W: ∃t > 0: φt(x) /∈W

.
DEFINITION 2.3. W −is called the exit set of W. The complement of W ∗in W, i.e., the
set W \ W ∗is called the asymptotic part of W.
Clearly, W −⊂W ∗and W \W ∗consists of all points x ∈W such that the whole positive
semitrajectory φ(x,[0,ωx)) is contained in W, which justiﬁes its name. Note that if W is
given, usually it is difﬁcult to determine the set W ∗(hence also the asymptotic part), since
one should follow the whole positive semitrajectory of every point x ∈W unless it reaches
the complement of W. It is even difﬁcult to check whether W \ W ∗is nonempty. The
Wa˙zewski method provides answers to that question in some reasonable situations. On
the other hand, the set W −can be determined easier, because in order to verify whether
x ∈W −one needs to know the position of φt(x) for t ∈(0,ε), where ε > 0 is arbitrarily
small.
DEFINITION 2.4. We call W a Wa˙zewski set provided
(a) if x ∈W, t > 0, and φ(x,[0,t]) ⊂W then φ(x,[0,t]) ⊂W,
(b) W −is closed relative to W ∗.
That deﬁnition seems to be difﬁcult to verify in practice, at least because it is difﬁcult
to determine the set W ∗. However, in the following result we indicate that in a reasonable
case we do not need any information on W ∗:
PROPOSITION 2.1. If both W and W −are closed subsets of X then W is a Wa˙zewski set.
In Section 1.2, we deﬁned the notions of egress and strict egress points for an open set
in the phase-space (Deﬁnition 1.2) and with their help we stated the Wa˙zewski theorem.
Using the notion of a Wa˙zewski set we can formulate more general results. In fact, it is
easy to observe that if V is an open set and every egress point is a strict egress point then
W := V ∪E is a Wa˙zewski set, W −= E, and W ∗= V ∗∪E. In the following example we
show that the above implication cannot be reversed.
EXAMPLE 2.1. Consider the ﬂow generated by the equation ˙x = 1 on R. Put
V := (−∞,0) ∪
∞

n=1

1
2n −2n+2 , 1
2n

.
Here the set E consists of 0 and the points 1/2n for n ⩾1. It follows that 0 is not a strict
egress point although E = W −and V ∪E is a Wa˙zewski set.
In [11], there is an example illustrating a similar conclusion in which V is homeomor-
phic to a ball in R3.

2.2. Properties of Wa˙zewski sets
Let W be an arbitrary subset of X.
DEFINITION 2.5. The function σ :W ∗→[0,∞),
σ(x) := sup

t ∈[0,∞): φ(x,[0,t]) ⊂W

is called the escape-time function of W.
It follows by (2.1) and (2.2) that
σ(φt(x)) = σ(x) −t,
if 0 ⩽t ⩽σ(x).
(2.3)
The most important properties of Wa˙zewski sets (including the Wa˙zewski lemma from
Section 1.2) are summarized in the following
LEMMA 2.1. If W is a Wa˙zewski set and σ is its escape-time function then
(i) if x ∈W ∗then φσ(x)(x) ∈W −,
(ii) x ∈W −if and only if x ∈W ∗and σ(x) = 0,
(iii) σ is continuous,
(iv) W ∗is open relative to W.
PROOF. Ad (i). It is clear that if x ∈W ∗then φ(x,[0,σ(x)]) ⊂W, hence φσ(x)(x) ∈W
by (a). Moreover φ(x,[0,σ(x)+t]) ̸⊂W for every t > 0, hence, by (2.2), φσ(x)(x) ∈W −.
Thus (i) is proved.
Ad (ii). If x ∈W −then, clearly, σ(x) = 0. On the other hand, if σ(x) = 0, then x ∈W −
by (2.1) and (i), hence (ii) follows.
Ad (iii). For the proof of (iii) assume that x ∈W ∗and ε > 0. At ﬁrst we prove that there
exists a neighborhood U of x such that σ(y) < σ(x) + ε for every y ∈U ∩W ∗. Indeed,
φ(x,[0,σ(x)+ε]) ̸⊂W, hence, by (a), there exists a t ∈[σ(x),σ(x)+ε] such that φt(x) /∈
W. By continuity of φ, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that φt(U) ∈X \ W. It is
clear, that σ(y) < t for every y ∈U ∩W ∗, hence the assertion follows.
Now we prove that there exists a neighborhood V of x such that σ(x) −ε < σ(y) if y ∈
V ∩W ∗. There is nothing to prove in the case σ(x) = 0, hence we can assume without loss
of generality that 0 < ε < σ(x). Let t ∈[σ(x) −ε,σ(x)). Then φ(x,[0,t]) ⊂W ∗\ W −.
By (b), there is an open set Z such that Z ∩W ∗= W ∗\ W −. By a standard argument, the
continuity of φ and the compactness of [0,t] imply the existence of a neighborhood V of x
such that φ(V,[0,t]) ⊂Z. Let y ∈V ∩W ∗. By (i), φσ(y)(y) ∈W −. Since W −is disjoint
from Z, σ(y) > t and the proof of (iii) is ﬁnished.
Ad (iv). Finally, in order to prove (iv) assume that x ∈W ∗. By (i) and (a) there exists a
t > σ(x) such that φt(x) /∈W. Thus, if y belongs to some neighborhood of x then φt(y) /∈
W and the proof of the lemma is ﬁnished.

Actually, that function is not continuous even if W is a compact Wa˙zewski set as an obvious
example, in which a stationary point belongs to the closure of W−, shows. However, the
following statement can be easily proved:
LEMMA 2.2. If both W and W −are compact then σ + is continuous.
PROOF. Since W is compact, σ +(x) = ∞if and only if x ∈W \ W ∗, hence, by
Lemma 2.1(iii), it sufﬁces to prove that σ + is continuous at each x0 such that σ +(x0) = ∞.
The required continuity follows from the fact that Inv+(B) is compact (see Lemma 2.1(iv)
and disjoint from W −. Indeed, if r > 0 then there exists an open neighborhood U of x0 in
W such that φ(y,[0,r]) ∩W −= ∅, hence σ +(y) ⩾r for every y ∈U.

2.3. Versions of the Wa˙zewski theorem
The Wa˙zewski theorem appears in the literature in various forms and each of them is a
direct application of Lemma 2.1 stated above, especially its part (iii) (i.e., the Wa˙zewski
lemma). Our purpose is to formulate the theorem in a form convenient for applications. In
fact, we present two theorems. The ﬁrst one is a direct generalization of the main theorems
of [85] and [20] obtained in a possibly most “economic” way. It is sufﬁcient for a great
majority of applications existing in the literature. However, as we show in a relatively
simple example, it is sometimes convenient to have its stronger version and such a version
will be presented at the end of the current section. In any case we should extend the notion
of a strong deformation retract given in Deﬁnition 1.1. To this purpose we follow the ideas
from the papers [58,62].
Assume that X is a topological space and A and B are subsets of X such that A ⊂B.
DEFINITION 2.6. A is called a strong deformation retract of B in X if there exists a
continuous map h:B × [0,1] →X (for which we also write ht(x) instead of h(x,t)) such
that
(a) h(x,0) = x for every x ∈B,
(b) h(x,t) = x for every x ∈A and t ∈[0,1],
(c) h1(B) ⊂A.
Obviously, in the case B = X, A is a strong deformation retract of B in the usual sense
(see Deﬁnition 1.1). Moreover, if A is a strong deformation retract of B in X then A is a
retract of B, if X′ ⊃X then A is also a strong deformation retract of B in X′, and if A
is a strong deformation retract of X then A is also a strong deformation retract of B in X
for every B such that A ⊂B ⊂X. A comparison among various types of retracts can be
visualized on Figure 4. Here X is the grey rectangle with a hole, A is its bottom edge, and
L and R are the circles—only R surrounds the hole. It is readily seen that A is a strong

deformation retract of A∪L in X, A is a retract of A∪R, and A is not a strong deformation
retract of A ∪R in X.
In the following sequence of results we assume that
• W is a Wa˙zewski set,
• σ is the escape-time function of W,
• Z is a subset of W,
• Y is a subset of W −such that Z ∩W −⊂Y.
THEOREM 2.1 (Wa˙zewski theorem—an improved statement). If Y is not a strong defor-
mation retract of Z ∪Y in (W \ W −) ∪Y then there exists an x0 ∈Z such that
• either φ+(x0) ⊂W \ W −,
• or else x0 ∈W ∗and φσ(x0)(x0) ∈W −\ Y.
PROOF. Assume that the conclusion is false. It follows that Z ⊂W ∗and for every x ∈Z
its consequent φσ(x)(x) is contained in Y. For every x ∈Z ∪Y and every s ∈[0,σ(x)] the
point φs(x) /∈W −\ Y, hence, by Lemma 2.1, the map
(Z ∪Y) × [0,1] ∋(x,t) →φtσ(x)(x) ∈(W \ W −) ∪Y
is continuous and satisﬁes (a)–(c) in Deﬁnition 2.6 contradictory to the assumption, hence
the result follows.
□
As an immediate consequence we get
COROLLARY 2.1. If Y is not a retract of Z ∪Y then the conclusion of Theorem 2.1 holds.
Theorem 2.1 does not follow from Corollary 2.1 as an example based on Figure 4 shows.
The original Wa˙zewski theorem stated in Section 1.2 is a corollary of the above one. We
repeat it below in a more general setting (as we already mentioned in Section 2.1, Wa˙zewski
sets naturally generalize the sets considered in [85]).
COROLLARY 2.2. If Z ∩Y is a retract of Y and Z ∩Y is not a retract of Z then the
conclusion of Theorem 2.1 holds.

608
R. Srzednicki
PROOF. It sufﬁces to prove that under the imposed hypotheses there is no retraction Z ∪
Y →Y. Indeed, if there exists a retraction of Z∪Y onto Y, its composition with a retraction
Y →Z ∩Y provides a retraction Z →Z ∩Y contrary to the assumption.
□
In the case Y = W −, there is an essential simpliﬁcation in the statement of Theorem 2.1:
COROLLARY 2.3. If W −is not a strong deformation retract of Z ∪W −in W then there
exists an x0 ∈Z such that φ+(x0) ⊂W.
In particular, the version of the Wa˙zewski theorem given in [20] is the following
COROLLARY 2.4 (Wa˙zewski theorem—the Conley’s version). If W −is not a strong de-
formation retract of W then there exists an x0 ∈W such that φ+(x0) ⊂W.
In the case of compact W one can get the full solution contained in W.
COROLLARY 2.5. Let W be a compact set. If W −is not a strong deformation retract of
W then there exists an x0 ∈W such that ∅̸= ω(x0) ⊂W. In particular, W contains a
nonempty invariant set.
PROOF. By Corollary 2.4, there exists an x such that φ+(x) ⊂W. Since W is compact,
the ω-limit set of x is nonempty. Since the latter set is invariant, the result follows.
□
Throughout reminder of this section we will consider local ﬂows. The last version of the
Wa˙zewski theorem presented in this section is due to Andrzej Pli´s in [62]. In order to state
it, we again modify the notion of a strong deformation retract. Let X be a topological space
and let A be a subset of B ⊂X.
DEFINITION 2.7. A is called a quasi-isotopic deformation retract of B in X if there exists
a continuous map h:B × [0,1] →X such that the conditions (a), (b), and (c) in Deﬁni-
tion 2.6 are satisﬁed, and
(d) B ∋x →ht(x) ∈ht(B) is a homeomorphism if 0 ⩽t < 1.
In the case B = X we simply call A a quasi-isotopic deformation retract of X. Obvi-
ously, a quasi-isotopic deformation retract of B in X is a strong deformation retract of B
in X. The following version of the Wa˙zewski theorem essentially appeared in [62].
THEOREM 2.2 (Wa˙zewski theorem—the version of Pli´s). Let φ be a local ﬂow. If Y is
not a quasi-isotopic deformation retract of Z ∪Y in (W \ W −) ∪Y then the conclusion of
Theorem 2.1 holds.
PROOF. We assume that the conclusion is false. It follows that Z ⊂W ∗and φσ(x)(x) ∈Y
for x ∈Z. As in the proof of Theorem 2.1, for x ∈Z ∪Y and t ∈[0,1] we put
h(x,t) := φ

x,tσ(x)


Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
609
and using Lemma 2.1 we conclude that h(x,t) ∈(W \ W −) ∪Y and h is continuous and
satisﬁes (a)–(c) in Deﬁnition 2.6. Thus, in order get a contradiction by proving that Y is
a quasi-isotopic deformation retract of Z ∪Y in (W \ W −) ∪Y it remains to prove that
if t < 1 then ht is a homeomorphism as a map Z ∪Y →ht(Z ∪Y). Fix t < 1 and for
y ∈ht(Z ∪Y) put
g(y) := φ

y,−(1 −t)−1tσ(y)

.
Let y = ht(x) and x ∈Z ∪Y. Since σ(y) = (1 −t)σ(x) by (2.3) and y = φ(x,tσ(x)),
g(y) = φy,−tσ(x) = x.
It follows that g :ht(Z ∪Y) →Z ∪Y and g ◦ht is equal to the identity. On the other hand,
(ht ◦g)ht(x) = ht(x),
hence ht ◦g is equal to the identity on ht(Z ∪Y). Thus ht is a homeomorphism (and g is
its inverse), which concludes the proof.
□
Obviously, Theorem 2.2 implies Theorem 2.1 as a corollary in the case φ is a local ﬂow.
Using an example based on Figure 5, below we indicate that it is a stronger result.
EXAMPLE 2.2. Let the phase-space of a local ﬂow be equal to R3 and let W be equal
to a cube as shown on Figure 5. Assume that the shaded rear and front sides of the cube
form the exit set W −. Let the set Z consists of two linked disjoint arcs, each of them is
attached by its ends to one of the components of W −. We claim that there exists a positive
semitrajectory starting in Z and contained in W.
Fig. 5.

610
R. Srzednicki
Corollary 2.3 is useless in attempts to prove the claim because W −is a strong deforma-
tion retract of Z ∪W −in W. Indeed, it sufﬁces to push each of the components of Z to the
corresponding side of the cube. Nevertheless, we assert that W −it is not a quasi-isotopic
deformation retract of Z ∪W −in W, hence, by Theorem 2.2, there is a required positive
semitrajectory.
In order to verify the assertion, assume on the contrary that W −is a quasi-isotopic
deformation retract of Z ∪W −in W and denote by h an associated homotopy which
satisﬁes the conditions (a)–(d). Let Γ1 and Γ2 be two sets homeomorphic to the circle
S1, each of them is contained in a different components of Z ∪W −and surrounds the
corresponding hole. Thus the linking number (compare [17, II.15] in the smooth case or
[28, VII.4.17] in the purely topological setting) of Γ1 and Γ2 is equal to ±1. On the other
hand, since both the sets are compact, h is continuous, and (c) is valid, there exists an ε > 0
such that if 1 −ε < t < 1 then each of the sets ht(Γi) is so close to the side to which it
is attached that there is no link between ht(Γ1) and ht(Γ2). Thus their linking number is
equal to 0. This is a contradiction, since hs(Γ1) ∩hs(Γ2) = ∅for every s ∈[0,t] by (d),
which implies that the linking number is preserved under the continuation over the interval
[0,t].
REMARK 2.1. In Example 2.2, we concluded by Theorem 2.2 that for every local ﬂow
there is a positive semitrajectory starting at Z and contained in W. Actually, in this ex-
ample the same conclusion holds for local semiﬂows. Indeed, this is a consequence of the
homotopy property of the linking number and the modiﬁed Theorem 2.2 valid for local
semiﬂows, for which the notion of quasi-isotopic deformation retract is changed by substi-
tuting the condition
(e) if x,y ∈B, t < 1, and ht(x) = ht(y) then hs(x) = hs(y) for every s ∈(t,1],
instead of (d) in Deﬁnition 2.7.
3. Wa˙zewski method in ordinary differential equations and inclusions
Abstract local ﬂows and semiﬂows, for which we describe the Wa˙zewski method in Sec-
tion 2, arise in the theory of differential equations. Here we present how to construct
Wa˙zewski sets in ordinary differential equations and give some extensions of the method
to equations which do not generate local semiﬂows.
3.1. Polyfacial sets
A usual construction of Wa˙zewski sets is based on existence of functions which behave
similarly to Liapunov functions on some parts of their zero-levels. In the sequel by M
we denote a smooth (i.e., of C∞class) Riemannian manifold without boundary, by T M
its tangent bundle, by the dot · the induced scalar product in each tangent space TxM,
and by ∇f (x) the corresponding gradient of a function f :M →R differentiable at x.
Let v be a vector-ﬁeld on M, i.e., a continuous map v :M →T M such that v(x) ∈TxM
for every x ∈M. Let p and q be nonnegative integers, p + q ⩾1, and for i = 1,...,p

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
611
and j = 1,...,q let ℓi and mj be continuous functions M →R of C1-class in some
neighborhoods of their zero levels. Put
V :=

x ∈M: ℓi(x) < 0 ∀i = 1,...,p, mj(x) < 0 ∀j = 1,...,q

and for the above i and j deﬁne
Li :=

x ∈∂V : ℓi(x) = 0

,
(3.1)
Mj :=

x ∈∂V : mj(x) = 0

.
(3.2)
(We do not exclude the possibility p = 0 or q = 0; in such a case one of the corresponding
families of functions and sets is empty.)
DEFINITION 3.1. The set V is called a polyfacial set determined by the set of functions
{ℓi,mj}. If, moreover,
v(x) · ∇ℓi(x) > 0,
if x ∈Li,
(3.3)
v(x) · ∇mj(x) < 0,
if x ∈Mj
(3.4)
for every i = 1,...,p and every j = 1,...,q then it is called a polyfacial set for the
vector-ﬁeld v (or, alternatively, for the differential equation (1.1)).
The concept of a polyfacial set comes from the original paper [85]. In that paper the sub-
sets Li were called its positive faces, while Mj were its negative faces, which terminology
is justiﬁed by (3.3) and (3.4). (Here we try to avoid that terminology because, as we will
see soon, Li is contained in the exit set V −.)
Throughout reminder of this section we assume that V is the polyfacial set for v deter-
mined by {ℓi,mj}. Assume that Equation (1.1) generates a local ﬂow φ. It follows by (3.3)
that if x ∈Li then there exists an ε > 0 such that ℓi(φt(x)) > 0 (hence φt(x) /∈V ) for each
t ∈(0,ε) and ℓi(φt(x)) < 0 for each t ∈(−ε,0). If x ∈Mj then (3.4) implies the reversed
inequalities for mj(φt(x)). Recall, that in Deﬁnition 1.2 we provided the notions of strict
egress, strict ingress, and outer tangency points on the boundary of a given open set.
PROPOSITION 3.1. If x ∈∂V then
(i) x is a strict egress point if and only if x ∈Li for some i = 1,...,p and x /∈Mj for
every j = 1,...,q,
(ii) x is a strict ingress point if and only if x ∈Mj for some j = 1,...,q and x /∈Li
for every i = 1,...,p,
(iii) x is an outward tangency point if and only if x ∈Li ∩Mj for some i = 1,...,p
and j = 1,...,q,
(iv) x is a strict egress or strict ingress, or outward tangency point (hence no other
possibility holds).

612
R. Srzednicki
PROOF. Let x ∈∂V .
Ad (i). Assume that x is a strict egress point. Then x /∈Mj for every j. Since
∂V ⊂

(3.5)
the implication from the left to the right follow. On the other hand, assume that x ∈Li0
for some i0 and x /∈Mj for every j. One has ℓi(x) ⩽0 for every i and mj(x) ⩽0 for
every j since x ∈V . It follows by the assumption that mj(x) < 0 for every j, hence also
mj(φt(x)) < 0 for t < 0 such that |t| is small. If ℓi(x) < 0 then, as before, ℓi(φt(x)) < 0
for t < 0 with |t| small. The other possibility ℓi(x) = 0 implies that φ(x,(0,εi)) ⊂\V
and ℓi(φt(x)) < 0 if −εi < t < 0 for some εi > 0. Thus, there exists an ε > 0 such that
φt(x) ∈V if −ε < t < 0. Moreover, φ(x,(0,εi0)) ⊂\V , hence the result follows.
Ad (ii). After reversing the time-direction it follows from (i).
Ad (iii). Assume that x is an outward tangency point. It follows by (3.5) and (i) and (ii)
that x ∈Li for some i and x ∈Mj for some j. The other implication is obvious.
Ad (iv). It follows by (3.5) and (i), (ii), and (iii).

Denote by E the set of strict egress points and by T the set of outward tangency points.

Proposition 3.1 indicates also which subsets of V are Wa˙zewski sets. Usually there are
inﬁnitely many of them. In the following straightforward result two of them are distin-
guished:
PROPOSITION 3.2.
(i) The set V ∪E is a Wa˙zewski set and its exit set is equal to E.
(ii) The set V is a Wa˙zewski set and its exit set is equal to E ∪T .
The sets considered in [85] assumed the form (i). Wa˙zewski sets obtained from polyfa-
cial sets have an advantage in comparison to some other constructions: they are stable with
respect to small perturbations of the vector-ﬁeld (since the inequalities (3.3) and (3.4) are
strict). In the following deﬁnition we distinguish a special class of polyfacial sets.
DEFINITION 3.2. Let V be a polyfacial set determined by {ℓi,mj}. It is called regular if
for every x ∈∂V the set {∇ℓi1(x),...,∇ℓir (x),∇mj1(x),...,∇js(x)} is linearly indepen-

{i1,...,ir} =

i = 1,...,p: ℓi(x) = 0

,
{j1,...,js} = j = 1,...,q: mj(x) = 0.
REMARK 3.1. If V is a regular polyfacial set then V is a topological submanifold with
boundary in M and the exit set V −= E ∪T is a topological submanifold of ∂V . In partic-
ular, all homology and cohomology functors for the pair (V ,V −) coincide. One can prove
that for every such functor H ,
H(V ,V −) = H(V ∪E,E).
If, moreover, p = q = 1, i.e., V = {ℓ< 0, m < 0} then the set V is a C1-class submanifold
with corners and the exit set is a C1-class submanifold with boundary.
In practice, the Wa˙zewski method is most frequently applied to non-autonomous equa-
tions. Let U be an open subset of R × M and let w :U →T M be time-dependent vector-
ﬁeld, i.e., a continuous map such that w(t,x) ∈TxM for every (t,x) ∈U. Assume that it
generates the equation
˙x = w(t,x)
(3.8)
for which the Cauchy problem x(t0) = x0 has the unique solution. We consider the induced
system
˙t = 1,
˙x = w(t,x)
(3.9)
in the extended phase space U and the vector-ﬁeld v := (1,w) on its right-hand side. All
the previous results can be applied to v since U is also a manifold without boundary. In the
case M = Rn the inequalities (3.3) and (3.4) assume the forms
∂ℓi
∂t (t,x) +

In particular, the set {(t,x,y) ∈R3: |x| < 1, |y| < 1} considered in Example 1.1 and
shown on Figure 2 is a polyfacial set determined by the functions
ℓ:(t,x,y) 
→x2 −1,
m:(t,x,y)

614
R. Srzednicki
and the set {(t,x,y) ∈R3: t < 1, |x| < 1, |y| < 1} in Example 1.2 (see Figure 3) is a
polyfacial set determined by the functions
ℓ1 :(t,x,y) 
→x2 −1,
ℓ2 :(t,x,y) 
→t −1,
m:(t,x,y) 
→y2 −1.
3.2. Equations without the uniqueness property and differential inclusions
Using polyfacial sets, in this section we extend the Wa˙zewski method to the case in which
the vector-ﬁeld v :M →T M does not satisfy the uniqueness property of the initial value
problem (1.1), (1.2). Since it does not involve any essential difﬁculty, we will extend the
Wa˙zewski method even further: we will consider differential inclusions. The idea of an ex-
tension to equations without uniqueness comes from the original paper [85] of Wa˙zewski,
while the extension to differential inclusions was initiated by Bielecki in [12] (he used the
term paratingent equations). Our presentation is based on the Bielecki’s approach.
As in Section 3.1, we assume that M is Riemannian manifold with a given metric. Let F
be a multivalued vector-ﬁeld on M, i.e., for every x ∈M we assign a nonempty compact
and convex set F(x) ⊂TxM. In what follows we assume that F is upper semi-continuous,
i.e., for every x ∈M and every ε there exists a neighborhood U of x such that if y ∈U
then F(y) is contained in the ε-neighborhood N(F(x),ε) of F(x) in T M. (In particular,
every single-valued continuous vector-ﬁeld has that property.) By a solution of a differen-
tial inclusion
˙x ∈F(x)
(3.12)
we mean an absolutely continuous mapping t 
→x(t) deﬁned in some interval such that
˙x(t) ∈F(x(t)) for almost every t. We assume also that the domain of x is maximal, i.e.,
the solution is saturated.
Below we assume that V be a polyfacial set determined by {ℓi,mj}, i = 1,...,p, j =
1,...,q, p + q ⩾1, and the sets Li, Mj, and let E are given by, respectively, (3.1), (3.2),
and (3.6).
DEFINITION 3.3. V is called a polyfacial set for (3.12) if for every i and j,
y · ∇ℓi(x) > 0,
for all y ∈F(x) and x ∈Li,
y · ∇mj(x) < 0,
for all y ∈F(x) and x ∈Mj.
In the sequel we assume that V is a polyfacial set for (3.12). Our aim is to prove the
following extension of the Wa˙zewski theorem, which essentially were given in [12]:
THEOREM 3.1. Let Y ⊂E and Z ⊂V ∪Y. Assume that Z and E \ Y are compact and Y
is not a quasi-isotopic deformation retract of Z ∪Y in V ∪E. Then there exists a solution
x of (3.12) such that x(0) ∈Z and

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
615
• either x(t) ∈V for all t ⩾0
• or there exists a t0 > 0 such that x(t) ∈V if t ∈[0,t0] and x(t0) ∈E \ Y.
PROOF. We will base on the results stated in [4], although they concern the case M = Rn
only. In the case of an arbitrary manifold M they can be stated in a similar way. Let vn be
a sequence of locally Lipschitzean vector-ﬁelds such that their graphs in T M approximate
the graph of F and preserve the strong inequalities (3.3) and (3.4) (compare [4, Theo-
rem 1.12.1]). By Theorem 2.2, for each n either there exists a point xn ∈Z such that the
solution of the equation
˙x = vn(x)
starting at xn remains in V or there exists an yn and tn > 0 such that the solution starting
at yn remains in V for t ∈[0,tn) and yn(tn) ∈E \ Y. At least one of the sequences {xn}
and {yn} must be inﬁnite. An accumulation point of that inﬁnite sequence has the required
properties (compare First Proof of Theorem 2.1.3 in [4]; observe moreover that the time t0
in the conclusion is positive since the distance between Z and E \ Y is nonzero).
□
We get the following corollary as an immediate consequence of the theorem in the case
Y = E:
COROLLARY 3.1. If H(V ∪E,E) ̸= 0, where H is the singular homology functor with
coefﬁcients in a given ring, then there exists a solution x of (3.12) such that x(t) ∈V for
all t ⩾0.
PROOF. Indeed, by the assumption there exists a singular chain c in V ∪E which is a
homologically nontrivial cycle with respect to the pair (V ∪E,E), hence its support Z :=
|c| cannot be continuously deformed to E. Thus Z is compact and satisﬁes the assumption
of Theorem 3.1, hence the result follows.
□
The questions concerning the existence of solutions contained in a given set are im-
portant in the theory of differential inclusions; the area of research related to them bears
the name viability theory (compare [3,4]). In that theory, a set W is called viable at x0 if
x0 ∈W and there exists a solution x with x(0) = x0 and x(t) ∈W for all t ⩾0.
Apart from the Bielecki’s paper, Wa˙zewski-type theorems for equations without unique-
ness and differential inclusions appeared in several publications, compare for example [6–
9,40,43]. Opposite to the approximation argument in the above proof, a purely topological
approach based on set-valued retractions was frequently presented and the obtained re-
sults were limited in practice to questions of lack of connectedness. Recently, in the paper
[35], Gabor and Quincampoix applied homology theory methods for admissible multival-
ued mappings (see [33]) to obtain stronger results in that topological setting. In particular,
[35] contains a theorem similar to Corollary 3.1 valid for closed sets which resemble the
Wa˙zewski ones. We state it below.
Assume that M = Rn. F is a called a Marchaud map if there exists a C > 0 such that
sup

for every x ∈Rn. For x0 ∈Rn denote by SF (x0) the set of solutions of the initial value
problem (3.12), (1.2). We extend the notion of exit set and escape-time function to the case
of differential inclusions; for W ⊂Rn put
W −:= x0 ∈∂W: ∃x ∈SF (x0) ∀t > 0: x[0,t] ̸⊂W
and for each solution x of (3.12) satisfying x(0) ∈W deﬁne
Σ(x) := sup


THEOREM 3.2 (compare Theorem A and Remark 2.1 in [35]). Let F be a Marchaud map
and let W and W −be closed subsets of Rn. Assume that for every x0 ∈W −and every
x ∈SF (x0),
x0,Σ(x) ⊂W −
provided Σ(x) < ∞. If ˇH(W,W −) ̸= 0 then there exists a solution x of (3.12) such that
x(t) ∈W for all t ⩾0, where ˇH denotes the ˇCech homology functor with compact supports
and coefﬁcients in Q.
In the case of Marchaud maps, Theorem 3.2 generalizes Corollary 3.1 if the considered
polyfacial set V is regular (see Deﬁnition 3.2) and the ring of coefﬁcients of H is equal
to Q. Indeed, in that case the ˇCech and singular homologies coincide by Remark 3.1, but
Theorem 3.2 allows empty interior of W and sliding along W −. In the next section we
indicate that for regular polyfacial sets there is a stronger version of Corollary 3.1 which
also allows sliding along the boundary.
3.3. Weak inequalities in polyfacial sets
The proof of Theorem 3.1 was essentially based on the strong inequalities (3.13) and (3.13).
One can ask whether the replacement of those strong inequalities by the weak ones still
provides results similar to that theorem. That question was considered in the paper [37];
in particular, for regular polyfacial sets. The following version of the Wa˙zewski theorem is
based on [37, Theorem 3].
THEOREM 3.3. Let V be a regular polyfacial set determined by {ℓi,mj}, and let Lj , Mi,
and E be given by, respectively, (3.1), (3.2), and (3.6). Let Y and Z satisfy the assumptions
of Theorem 3.1. Assume moreover that F is a multivalued vector-ﬁeld such that the weak
inequalities
y · ∇ℓi(x) ⩾0,
for all y ∈F(x) and x ∈Li,
y · ∇mj(x) ⩽0,
for all y ∈F(x) and x ∈Mj.
are satisﬁed for every i and j. Then the conclusion of Theorem 3.1 holds.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
617
PROOF. The idea of a proof is to add to the right-hand side of (3.12) a sequence of pertur-
bation terms of the form φnh, where h is a bounded vector-ﬁeld satisfying
h(x) · ∇ℓi(x) > 0,
if x ∈Li,
h(x) · ∇mj(x) < 0,
if x ∈Mj,
for every i and j, and φn is a sequence of continuous, positive-valued functions such that
φn tends to zero uniformly on compact sets. It follows that one can apply Theorem 3.1 to
the inclusions
˙x ∈F(x) + φn(x)h(x).
As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, the required point x0 is obtained as an accumulation point
of the obtained sequence of points. The vector-ﬁeld h can be constructed as follows: for
every x0 in the boundary of V ﬁnd a vector w such that
w · ∇ℓi(x0) > 0,
w · ∇mj(x0) < 0
if ℓi(x0) = 0 and mj(x0) = 0. Such a vector exists thanks to the linear independence of
the gradients (in order to verify that assertion one can adapt the argument in the proof of
Farkas Lemma in linear programming). The vector w can be extended to a vector-ﬁeld
in a neighborhood of x0 such that the strong inequalities are preserved. Those vector-
ﬁelds deﬁned locally can by glued using a partition of unity to the global vector-ﬁeld
satisfying the required properties. Details of the construction in the case M = Rn can be
found in [37].
□
3.4. Generalized polyfacial sets
Let us return to the case in which v :M →T M is a vector-ﬁeld on the Riemannian mani-
fold M. If v generates a local ﬂow φ, one can still obtain a Wa˙zewski set on the similar way
to the one described in Section 3.1 if a more general type of inequalities then (3.3) and (3.4)
occurs. Let n:M →R be a C1-function, let N be equal to the set {x ∈M: nk(x) ⩽0}, and
let x0 ∈N be such that
v(x0) · ∇n(x0) = 0.
(3.13)
In order to get the outward tangency property of the trajectory of x0 with respect to N, the
value of the function t 
→n(φt(x0)) should assume a sharp local minimum at t = 0. This
is guaranteed if its second derivative at t = 0 exists and is positive (or, more generally, the
lowest-order nonzero derivative is even and positive). By a simple calculation we conclude
that the second-order criterium is satisﬁed if the function
v · ∇n:M ∋x →∇n(x) · v(x) ∈R

618
R. Srzednicki
is differentiable at x0 and the condition
v(x0) · ∇(v · ∇n)(x0) > 0
(3.14)
holds. That observation leads to the following generalization of the notion of polyfacial set
(compare [24,25]). Let p + q + r ⩾1 and let ℓi for i = 1,...,p, mj for j = 1,...,q, and
nk for k = 1,...,r be continuous functions M →R of C1-class in some neighborhoods
of their zero levels. Similarly as in Section 3.1, put
V :=

x ∈M: ℓi(x) < 0 ∀i, mj(x) < 0 ∀j, nk(x) < 0 ∀k

,
Li := x ∈∂V : ℓi(x) = 0,
Mj :=

x ∈∂V : mj(x) = 0

,
Nk :=

x ∈∂V : nk(x) = 0

.
DEFINITION 3.4. The set V is called a generalized polyfacial set determined by
{ℓi,mj,nk}. It is called a generalized polyfacial set for v (or, alternatively, for (1.1)) pro-
vided the inequalities (3.3) and (3.4) hold for every i = 1,...,p and j = 1,...,q, and,
moreover, for every k = 1,...,r the function v · ∇nk is of C1-class in a neighborhood of
its zero level, and for every x ∈Nk one of the following conditions is satisﬁed:
v(x) · ∇nk(x) > 0,
(3.15)
v(x) · ∇nk(x) < 0,
(3.16)
v(x) · ∇nk(x) = 0,
v(x) · ∇v · ∇nk(x) > 0.
(3.17)

whenever their right-hand sides are deﬁned. They can be directly translated to the case
of Equation (3.9) in Rn+1 in order to get analogous inequalities to (3.11) and (3.10). In
particular, for a scalar second order equation
x′′ = g(t,x,x′),
(3.20)
where g :R3 →R is continuous, the corresponding equation of the form (3.9) is given by
˙t = 1,

Assume again that v generates a local ﬂow φ, i.e., (1.1) satisﬁes the uniqueness property of
the corresponding Cauchy problem. Taking into account remarks on the beginning of the
current section, by an argument similar to the one in the proof of Proposition 3.1 one can
observe that the sets of strict egress points E and the set of outward tangency points T of
V are determined by

and the same assertion as in Proposition 3.2 holds:
PROPOSITION 3.3. If V is a generalized polyfacial set for v then:
(i) the set V ∪E is a Wa˙zewski set and its exit set is equal to E,
(ii) the set V is a Wa˙zewski set and its exit set is equal to E ∪T .
REMARK 3.2. If V is a generalized polyfacial set is determined by only one function n,
i.e., V = {n < 0}, and ∇n(x) ̸= 0 for every x such that n(x) = 0 then V is a C1-class
submanifold with boundary in the phase-space M and the set V −is a C1-class submanifold
with boundary in ∂V . Moreover, the same properties on homology or cohomology as stated
in Remark 3.1 hold.

REMARK 3.3. Let V be a generalized polyfacial set for (1.1). If (1.1) satisﬁes the unique-
ness property then Theorem 2.2 holds for the sets described in Proposition 3.3. On the other
hand, if it does not satisfy the uniqueness property, a theorem similar to Theorem 3.1 can
be formulated for those sets provided there is a sequence of locally Lipschitzean vector-
ﬁelds vn approximating v such that (3.15), (3.16), and (3.17) with v replaced by vn hold
on, respectively, Nk
−, Nk
+, and Nk
0 . This can be justiﬁed by analyzing the argument in the
proof of Theorem 3.1.
4. Wa˙zewski method for retarded functional differential equations
Now we consider local semiﬂows generated by retarded functional differential equations
(RFDEs). We provide results concerning the Wa˙zewski method for those equations which
go beyond direct substitutions of the abstract Wa˙zewski-type theorems from Section 2 to
those semiﬂows.
4.1. Local semiﬂows generated by RFDEs
Let M be a Riemannian manifold. For each continuous function x :J →M, where J ⊂
R, and for each t ∈R put xt(τ) := x(t + τ) whenever it is deﬁned. For some r > 0 let
C := C([−r,0],M) be the set of continuous mappings u:[−r,0] →M endowed with the
topology of uniform convergence. Let F :C →T M be a continuous map such that F(u) ∈
Tu(0)M for every u ∈C. By a solution of the retarded functional differential equation
˙x(t) = F(xt)
(4.1)
we mean a continuous function x :[−r,ω) →M such that (4.1) is satisﬁed for t ∈[0,ω)
and ω > 0 is maximal. (Here and in the sequel ˙x(t) denotes the right-hand side derivative
in the case t is equal to the left end of the interval in which x is deﬁned.) Moreover, if for
every u ∈C there is the unique solution x of (4.1) satisfying the initial condition
x|[−r,0] = u
(4.2)
then the right end of the domain interval of x is denoted by ωu (i.e., x :[−r,ωu) →M)
and for t ∈[0,ωu) we deﬁne φ(u,t) := xt (hence, in particular, φ(u,t)(0) = x(t)). The
mapping φ deﬁned in this way is a local semiﬂow on the space C.
Now let us consider a nonautonomous equation, i.e., an equation of the form
˙x(t) = G(t,xt),
(4.3)
where G:U →T M is continuous on an open subset U of R×C and G(t,u) ∈Tu(0)M for
every (t,u) ∈U. In this case the description of the corresponding local semiﬂow is slightly
more complicated. Let (σ,u) ∈U and let x :[σ −r,ω) →M be a solution of (4.3) (i.e., x
satisﬁes the equation on [σ,ω) and ω > σ is maximal) which satisﬁes
xσ|[−r,0] = u.
(4.4)

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
621
In this case we call x a solution of (4.3) with the initial condition (σ,u). If for every (σ,u)
there exists the unique such solution x, we deﬁne ω(σ,u) in such a way that
σ + ω(σ,u) = ω
(recall that ω is the right end of the interval of the existence of x) and for t ∈[0,ω(σ,u)) we
put
ψ(σ,u),t := (σ + t,xσ+t).
It is easy to check that ψ obtained in this way is a local semiﬂow on U.
4.2. Wa˙zewski-type theorems for RFDEs
Our presentation of the basic results concerning the Wa˙zewski method in Section 2.3 was
purely topological, hence it also directly applies to local semiﬂows described in the previ-
ous section. However, since their phase-spaces are inﬁnite-dimensional, usually the theo-
rems given in Section 2.3 have limited applications, at least because the sphere in such a
space is a retract of the ball. Therefore one should provide separate Wa˙zewski-type theo-
rems more suitable for retarded functional differential equations. To this aim we will follow
an idea in the paper [67] by Rybakowski. Actually, it was preceded by [57], in which con-
sidered conditions were too restrictive, and [49], where the idea later used in [67] appeared
in a special case. We will not provide Rybakowski’s approach in the full generality, be-
cause it would require the introduction of several new concepts, but we rather concentrate
on results which can be directly used in applications.
In the current section we assume the uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for the consid-
ered equations, hence they generated local semiﬂows as it was described above. At ﬁrst we
will deal with the autonomous case, i.e., with the local ﬂow φ generated by Equation (4.1)
on C. As in Section 3.1, let V be a polyfacial set determined by {ℓi,mj}, i.e.,
V :=

x ∈M: ℓi(x) < 0 ∀i, mj(x) < 0 ∀j

.
Recall that Li and Mj denote the sets of zeros of ℓi and, respectively, mj on the boundary
of V (see (3.1) and (3.2)).
DEFINITION 4.1. The set V is called a polyfacial set for (4.1) if
F(u) · ∇ℓi
u(0)

> 0,
if u(0) ∈Li and u

for u ∈C, i = 1,...,p, and j = 1,...,q.

EXAMPLE 4.1 (compare Example 3.1 in [67]). Consider the scalar equation
˙x = −ax(t) −bx(t −r),
(4.7)
where a,b ∈R. If |a| ⩾|b| then for an arbitrary w > 0, the interval (−w,w) is a polyfacial
set for (4.7) determined by the functions t 
→±t −w.
In the sequel we assume that V is a polyfacial set for (4.1); in particular we assume that
(4.5) and (4.6) are satisﬁed. Let the set E be given by the formula (3.6). Put

V :=

v ∈C: v(τ) ∈V ∀τ ∈[−r,0]

,

E :=

u ∈C: u(0) ∈E, u(τ) ∈V ∀τ ∈[−r,0)

.
PROPOSITION 4.1. The set W := 
V ∪
E is a Wa˙zewski set for the local semiﬂow φ gener-
ated by (4.1) on C and its exit set W −is equal to 
E.
PROOF. The set W consists of two parts. It is obvious that there are no elements of W −
contained in 
V . Moreover, by (4.5), each element of 
E is in W −, hence W −= 
E. The
latter set is equal to W ∩∂
V , hence it is closed in W, so (b) in Deﬁnition 2.4 holds.
If the positive semitrajectory of a point in 
V reaches the boundary of 
V , the ﬁrst point
of intersection belongs to 
E by (4.5) and (4.6), hence also (a) is satisﬁed and the result
follows.
□
Thus all Wa˙zewski-type theorems for semiﬂows stated in Section 2.3 can be applied W.
Here we do not repeat them, but instead we indicate other, more useful results. In the
following theorems we assume that
• Y ⊂E,
• Z ⊂V ∪Y,
• π :Z ∩(Z ∪Y) →C is a continuous map.
The ﬁrst result is a counterpart of Theorem 2.1.
THEOREM 4.1. Assume that for every z ∈Z ∩(Z ∪Y),
π(z)(0) = z,
π(z)

[−r,0)

⊂V.
If Y is not a strong deformation retract of Z∪Y in V ∪Y then there exists a z0 ∈Z such that
the solution x :[−r,ω) →M of Equation (4.1) with the initial condition x|[−r,0] = π(z0)
satisﬁes
• either x([0,ω)) ⊂V
• or else there exists t0 ∈(0,ω) such that
x[0,t0) ⊂V,
x(t0) ∈E \ Y.

PROOF. Assume on the contrary that the conclusion does not hold. In our notation it means
that for every z ∈Z ∩(Z ∪Y),
π(z) ∈W ∗,
σ

π(z)

∈Y,
where σ :W ∗→[0,∞) is the escape-time function. By Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 4.1,
σ is continuous. For y ∈Z ∪Y and t ∈[0,1] deﬁne
h(y,t) :=
φπ(y),tσπ(y)(0),
if y ∈Z,
y,
if y ∈Y.
It is easy to verify that h satisﬁes the conditions required in Deﬁnition 2.6.
□
The presented below counterpart of Corollary 2.1 cannot by directly derived from The-
orem 4.1 because of a weaker hypothesis imposed on π. Nevertheless, its proof based on
already presented arguments is straightforward.
THEOREM 4.2. Assume that for every z ∈Z \ Y,
π(z)

[−r,0]

⊂V
and for every y ∈Z ∩Y,
π(y)(0) = y,
π(y)

[−r,0)

⊂V.
If Y is not a retract of Z ∪Y then the conclusion of Theorem 4.1 holds.
PROOF. If the conclusion is false then the map r :Z ∪Y →Y given by the formula
r(y) :=
φ

π(y),σ

π(y)

(0),
if y ∈Z,
y,
if y ∈Y,
is a retraction which contradicts to the assumption.
□
Essentially, the above theorems were stated in [67, Section 3]. In order to match to our
presentation in Section 2.3, we strengthened them slightly (in particular, by considering
the set Y). However, a direct strengthening of Theorem 4.1 in order to get a counterpart
of Theorem 2.2 is not possible. A counterexample with a suitable choice of V , Z, and the
maps F and π can be based on Figure 5. (Such a counterexample does not contradict to
Remark 2.1.) The theorems can be extended to equations without the uniqueness property
in a similar way as described in Section 3.2 (compare [67, Section 4]).
In the theorems we assumed the existence of a map π having some special properties.
One can ask whether such a mapping can be constructed for a given polyfacial set V and a
set Z. In practice this is always possible; if the polyfacial set is regular (see Deﬁnition 3.2)
then, by Remark 3.1, V is a topological manifold with boundary and thus it has a collar,

624
R. Srzednicki
i.e., there is an embedding of ∂V × [0,1] into V for which ∂V × {0} corresponds to ∂V
(compare [17, Section VI.9]). Now it is easy to construct π such that π(z) is equal to the
constant map τ 
→z if z is outside of the image of the embedding.
One can formulate similar theorems for the nonautonomous equation (4.3). Formally,
contrary to the case of ordinary differential equations, they are not direct consequences
of the results stated for the autonomous ones by attaching the equation ˙t = 1, at least
because the phase-space of the local ﬂow generated by (4.3) does not coincide with
C([−r,0],R × M). However, in spite of slightly greater complexity, there are no essential
problems in their formulating and proving—that can be done in the same way as above for
the autonomous case.
We skip the statements of those general theorems and for simplicity concentrate on the
case M = Rn where we assume that the domain U of the function G on the right-hand
side of the equation (4.3) is equal to R × C and C = C([−r,0],Rn). (For a more general
situation the reader is referred to [67].) Let V be a polyfacial set in Rn+1 determined by
{ℓi,mj} and let E be given by (3.6). The counterparts of (4.5) and (4.6) are

Then there exists a (σ0,z0) ∈Z such that the solution x :[−r + σ0,ω) →Rn of the equa-
tion (4.1) with the initial condition xσ0|[−r,0] = π(σ0,z0) satisﬁes

Their union is a Wa˙zewski set for the local semiﬂow ψ on R × C described in the previous

The equation considered in the following two examples of application of Theorem 4.3 is
taken from [67, Example 3.2]. Similar applications for ordinary differential equation were
given in Examples 1.1 and 1.2.
EXAMPLE 4.2. In the planar equation
˙x(t) = ax(t) + bx(t −r) + f (t,xt,yt),
˙y(t) = −cy(t) + dy(t −r) + g(t,xt,yt)
(4.10)
let a,c > 0 and let
(f,g):R × C × C →R2,
where C = C([−r,0],R), be a continuous map. Assume that (4.10) satisﬁes the uniqueness
of the Cauchy problem,


f (t,u,v)


 < |a| −|b|
for all (t,u,v) ∈R × C × C for which


u(0)

Let the sets V , E, and Z be the same as in Example 1.1, i.e., they are given by, respectively,
(1.7), (1.8), and (1.9) (see also Figure 2). V is a polyfacial set for (4.10). Deﬁne π :Z ∪
E →C × C by
π(t,x,y)(τ) :=
r + τ
r


for (t,x,y) ∈Z ∪E and τ ∈[−r,0]. By Theorem 4.3 we conclude that there is an x0 ∈
(−1,1) such that the graph of the solution of (4.10) starting at (0,π(0,x0,0)) is contained
in V .
EXAMPLE 4.3. We associate the boundary value problem (1.10) to Equation (4.10) in
Example 4.2. As in Example 1.2, we deﬁne V , E, Z, and Y by, respectively (1.11), (1.12),
(1.9), and (1.13). Recall, that those sets are shown on Figure 3. Let π be the mapping
deﬁned in Example 4.2. By Theorem 4.3 we conclude the existence of a solution of the
problem (4.10), (1.10) which starts at (0,π(0,x0,0)) for some x0 ∈(−1,1).
5. Some topological concepts
In order to state variants of the Wa˙zewski theorem, we have already deﬁned the notion of
retract and its modiﬁcations. In this section we recall several other topological notions and
results which will be used in description of properties of the sets of solutions obtained by
the Wa˙zewski method.
5.1. Topological pairs, quotient spaces, and pointed spaces
By a topological pair we mean a pair (X,A) consisting of a topological space X and its
subset A. If A is closed in X then (X,A) is a called a closed pair. If x0 ∈X, we frequently
write (X,x0) for the topological pair (X,{x0}). Let (X,A) and (Y,B) be topological pairs.
We write f :(X,A) →(Y,B) if f is continuous map X →Y and f (A) ⊂B.
Now we recall the notion of quotient space. We impose a special attention to the case in
which the empty space is involved. Let (X,A) be a topological pair.
DEFINITION 5.1. The quotient space X/A is the set whose elements are all points of X\A
and the set A (denoted by [A] in order to avoid confusions), i.e.,
X/A := (X \ A) ∪

[A]

,

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
627
endowed with the topology for which U ⊂X/A is open if and only if the set {x ∈X: [x] ∈
U} is open in X, where
[x] :=
x,
if x ∈X \ A,
[A],
if x ∈A.
It follows that the quotient map
q :X ∋x →[x] ∈X/A
is continuous. By deﬁnition, X/∅is equal to X ∪{[∅]} and its topology is equal to the
direct sum topology of X and the one-point space {[∅]}. In particular, ∅/∅is equal to {[∅]}.
Since [A] is distinguished in X/A in a canonical way, in order to simplify the notation, for
an arbitrary pair (X,A) we write shortly (X/A,∗) instead of (X/A,[A]).
For presentation of results involving quotient spaces we use the ˇCech cohomology func-
tor ˇH ∗= { ˇH q}q∈Z having coefﬁcients in a ﬁxed commutative ring-with-unit R. We recall
that it is isomorphic to the Alexander–Spanier cohomology functor (compare [71]).
REMARK 5.1. By the strong excision of the ˇCech cohomology, if (X,A) is a closed pair
then the quotient map induces an isomorphism
ˇH ∗(q): ˇH ∗(X/A,∗)
∼=
−→ˇH ∗(X,A).
By a pointed space we mean a topological pair (X,x0), where x0 ∈X. In this case x0 is
called the base point. For example, (X/A,∗) is a pointed space with the base point ∗equal
to [A]. Let (X,x0) and (Y,y0) be two pointed spaces. In this case f :(X,x0) →(Y,y0)
means f :X →Y continuous such that f (x0) = y0. We put
X ∨Y := X × {y0} ∪{x0} × Y
and deﬁne the wedge sum of (X,x0) and (Y,y0) by
(X,x0) ∨(Y,y0) :=

X ∨Y,(x0,y0)

.
Similarly, we put
X ∧Y := X × Y/(X ∨Y),
(X,x0) ∧(Y,y0) := (X ∧Y,∗)
and call (X,x0) ∧(Y,y0) the smash product of (X,x0) and (Y,y0).
5.2. Homotopy types
Recall that maps f,g :X →Y are homotopic (denoted f ≃g) if for some continuous map
h:X × [0,1] →Y, f is equal to x 
→h(x,0) and g is equal to x 
→h(x,1). If, moreover,

628
R. Srzednicki
f,g :(X,x0) →(Y,y0) then they are called pointed-homotopic (denoted f ≃∗g) if the
map h additionally satisﬁes h(x0,t) = y0 for every t ∈[0,1].
DEFINITION 5.2. We say that topological spaces X and Y have the same homotopy type
(and we write X ≃Y) if for some maps f :X →Y and g :Y →X (called homotopy equiv-
alences),
g ◦f ≃idX,
f ◦g ≃idY .
We say that the pointed spaces (X,x0) and (Y,y0) have the same pointed homotopy type
(we write (X,x0) ≃∗(Y,y0)) if there exist f :(X,x0) →(Y,y0) and g :(Y,y0) →(X,x0)
such that
g ◦f ≃∗idX,
f ◦g ≃∗idY .
The absolute homotopy type (shortly: homotopy type) of X is the equivalence class of X in
the relation ≃. It is denoted by [X]. Similarly, the pointed homotopy type of (X,x0) is the
equivalence class of (X,x0) in the relation ≃∗and is denoted by [X,x0].
Obviously, [X,x0] is a more restrictive class of spaces then [X]. Since a homology or
cohomology functor H is homotopy invariant, we deﬁne
H[X] := H(X),
H[X,x0] := H(X,x0).
One can prove that the following deﬁnitions of the wedge sum and smash product of ho-
motopy types are correctly stated:
[X,x0] ∨[Y,y0] :=

(X,x0) ∨(Y,y0)

,
[X,x0] ∧[Y,y0] :=

(X,x0) ∧(Y,y0)

.
We distinguish the trivial pointed homotopy type:
0 :=

[∅]

,[∅]

,
i.e., the homotopy type of a pointed one-point space, which is the neutral element with
respect to the wedge sum.
REMARK 5.2. There is no inverse to a nontrivial pointed homotopy type with respect to
the wedge sum, i.e.,
[X,x0] ∨[Y,y0] = 0
implies
[X,x0] = 0,
[Y,y0] = 0.

Indeed, if there is a continuous map F :X ∨Y × [0,1] →X ∨Y such that
F(x,y),0 = (x,y),
F(x,y),1 = F(x0,x0),t = (x0,x0)
for every t,x,y then the map G:X × [0,1] →X deﬁned by

∈X × {y0},

otherwise,
where π :X × Y →X denotes the projection, provides
(X,x0) ≃∗

{x0},x0

.
The following simple lemma is useful in the Wa˙zewski method.
LEMMA 5.1. If A is a strong deformation retract of X then
[X/A,∗] = 0.
In the following example we illustrate the difference between the absolute and pointed
homotopy types.
EXAMPLE 5.1. The unit zero- and one-dimensional spheres S0 and S1 are, respectively,
the set {−1,1} and the circle {x: |x| = 1} in C. They naturally provide pointed spaces
(S0,1) and (S1,1). By deﬁnition, S0 ∨S1 is homeomorphic to the disjoint union of S1 and
a one-point space, hence it is homeomorphic to S1/∅and

S0 ∨S1
=

S1/∅

.
On the other hand, each homotopy equivalence S0 ∨S1 →S1/∅transforms the base point
(1,1) of (S0,1) ∨(S1,1) to a point in the other component of S1/∅then [∅], hence


5.3. Absolute neighborhood retracts
We recall the topological notions of absolute and Euclidean neighborhood retracts.
DEFINITION 5.3 (compare [14,33]). A metrizable space X is called an absolute neigh-
borhood retract (shortly: ANR) if there is an open set U in a normed space E and a map
h:X →E which is a homeomorphism onto its image h(X) such that h(X) is a retract
of U.

630
R. Srzednicki
REMARK 5.3. There is an equivalent deﬁnition: A metrizable space X is an ANR if and
only if for each closed subset A of a metrizable space W and every continuous map
f :A →X there exists a neighborhood U of A in W and a continuous map F :U →X
such that F|A = f (compare [14, Theorem IV(4.2)(ii)]).
We refer to [14] for other properties of ANRs.
DEFINITION 5.4 (compare [28]). A metrizable space X is called an Euclidean neighbor-
hood retract (shortly: ENR) if there is an n ∈N, an open set U in Rn, and a map h:X →Rn
which is a homeomorphism onto its image h(X) such that h(X) is a retract of U.
The class of ENRs coincides with the class of locally compact, separable, and ﬁnite-
dimensional ANRs. Examples of ENRs include all compact polyhedra and manifolds with
boundary. The Hilbert cube is a compact ANR which is not an ENR.
5.4. Lusternik–Schnirelmann category
We provide the concept of the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category for topological pairs,
which appears to be very convenient in connection to the Wa˙zewski method. At ﬁrst we
recall the notion of contractibility.
DEFINITION 5.5. A set A ⊂X is called contractible in X if there exists a continuous map
h:A × [0,1] →X such that h(x,0) = x for every x ∈A and h(x,1) = h(y,1) for every
x,y ∈A.
Notice that the above deﬁnition is also valid also for A = ∅. Let (X,Y) be a closed pair.
Motivated by the deﬁnition posed by Reeken, Fournier, and Willem (compare [31]) we put
DEFINITION 5.6. The relative category catX,Y (A) of a closed set A ⊂X is an element of
N ∪{∞} such that
catX,Y(A) := 0,
if Y is a strong deformation retract of A ∪Y in X.
catX,Y(A) ⩽n,
if there exist closed sets Ai ⊂A, i = 0,...,n, such that
A =
n

i=0
Ai,
Ai is contractible in X for i = 1,...,n, and
Y is a strong deformation retract of A0 ∪Y in X.
(Compare Deﬁnition 2.6 for the notion of a strong deformation retract in a space.)
Formally, we did not exclude any possibility in which the empty set appears. In particu-
lar, for closed A ⊂X we deﬁne
catX(A) := catX,∅(A).

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
631
It follows that if X ̸= ∅then catX(A) is the minimal number of closed contractible in X
subsets of A which cover A (since A0 = ∅) or, if such a number does not exist, it is equal
to ∞.
DEFINITION 5.7. Deﬁne
cat(X,Y) := catX,Y(X),
cat(X) := catX(X)
and call them the category of (X,Y) and, respectively the category of X.
It is easy to check that for a closed A ⊂X,
catX(A) ⩽cat(A),
(5.1)
catX,Y (A) ⩽catX(A) ⩽catX,Y(A) + catX(Y).
(5.2)
In particular,
cat(X,Y) ⩾cat(X) −catX(Y) ⩾cat(X) −cat(Y)
(5.3)
and if x0 is a point in X then
catX,x0(A) ⩽catX(A) ⩽catX,x0(A) + 1.
(5.4)
EXAMPLE 5.2. In the notation used in Example 5.1,
cat


= cat

S0,1

∨

S1,1


cat

S1/∅

= 3.
It follows immediately by deﬁnition that the category is an invariant of the absolute and
pointed homotopy types. Hence we can put the following deﬁnitions:
DEFINITION 5.8. The categories of the homotopy types are deﬁned as
cat[X] := cat(X),
cat[X,x0] := cat(X,x0).
We list the basic properties of the category.
PROPOSITION 5.1 (compare [31]). Let A and B be closed subsets of X.
(i) If A ⊂B then catX,Y(A) ⩽catX,Y (B).
(ii) catX,Y (A ∪B) ⩽catX,Y (A) + catX(B).
(iii) If there exists a continuous map h:A×[0,1] →X such that h(x,0) = x for x ∈A,
h(x,t) = x for x ∈A ∩Y and t ∈[0,1] then
catX,Y
h1(A) ⩽catX,Y (A).

632
R. Srzednicki
(iv) If both X and Y are ANRs then there exists a closed neighborhood U of A such
that
catX,Y(U) = catX,Y (A).
PROOF. Proofs of (i), (ii), and (iii) are immediate. As for (iv), we refer to [31, Proposi-
tion 2.9].
□
PROPOSITION 5.2. If (X,A) is a closed pair of ANRs then
cat(X,A) ⩾cat(X/A,∗) ⩾cat(X/A) −1.
PROOF. We can assume that cat(X,A) = n < ∞. Let Ai, i = 0,...,n, be a closed cover-
ing of X such that A ⊂A0, A is a strong deformation retract of A0, and Ai are contractible
in X for i ⩾1. Since X and A are ANRs, as in the proof of [31, Proposition 2.9] one
can ﬁnd a closed neighborhood U0 of A0 for which A is a strong deformation retract.
For i = 1,...,n deﬁne A′
i as Ai \ intU0, hence A′
i ∩A = ∅. Using the subsets U0/A,
A′
1,...,A′
n of X/A one gets
cat(X/A,∗) ⩽n,
hence the left inequality follows. The right-hand inequality is given in (5.4).
□
5.5. Cup-length
Here we use the cup-product (denoted by ⌣) in the ˇCech cohomologies (compare [28] for
results which concern that notion and which we apply in the sequel). We provide the notion
of cup-length in the context of pair of spaces, compare [31, Deﬁnition 3.2]. Notice that in
our deﬁnition, the cup-length of a pair is shifted by one with respect to the cup-length
considered in that paper.
DEFINITION 5.9. The cup-length of a topological pair (X,Y) is an element ℓ(X,Y) of
N ∪{∞} which satisﬁes
ℓ(X,Y) = 0,
if ˇH ∗(X,Y) = 0,
ℓ(X,Y) = 1,
if ˇH 0(X,Y) ̸= 0, ˇH q(X) = 0 for q ⩾1,
ℓ(X,Y) ⩾n,
if there exist q ⩾0, v ∈ˇH q(X,Y), qi ⩾1, and ui ∈ˇH qi(X)
for i = 1,...,n −1 such that v ⌣u1 ⌣··· ⌣un−1 ̸= 0.
We write ℓ(X) := ℓ(X,∅). It follows ℓ(∅) = 0, ℓ(X) = 1 if X ̸= ∅and ˇH q(X) = 0 for
q ⩾1, and ℓ(X) ⩾n if there exists qi ⩾1 and ui ∈ˇH qi(X), i = 1,...,n −1, such that

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
633
u1 ⌣··· ⌣un−1 ̸= 0. Indeed, it sufﬁces to put v = 1 ∈ˇH 0(X,∅). Moreover, if x0 ∈X
then
ℓX,{x0} ⩽ℓ(X) ⩽ℓX,{x0} + 1,
(5.5)
since ˇH q(X,{x0}) = ˇH q(X) for q ⩾1. Moreover, it follows that the cup-length is an in-
variant of the ˇCech cohomology ring of (X,x0), hence also of the pointed homotopy type
[X,x0]. Thus we can put
DEFINITION 5.10. The cup-lengths of the homotopy types are deﬁned as
ℓ[X] := ℓ(X),
ℓ[X,x0] := ℓ(X,x0).
PROPOSITION 5.3. If (X,A) is a closed pair then
ℓ(X,A) ⩾ℓ(X/A,∗) ⩾ℓ(X/A) −1.
PROOF. Assume ℓ(X/A,∗) ⩾n. The diagram
ˇH ∗(X/A,∗)⊗
∼=
ˇH ∗(X/A) ⊗···⊗ˇH ∗(X/A)
⌣
ˇH ∗(X/A,∗)
∼=
ˇH ∗(X,A)
⊗
ˇH ∗(X) ⊗···⊗
ˇH ∗(X)
⌣
ˇH ∗(X,A)
with the vertical lines induced by the quotient map, is commutative. By Remark 5.1 and
the commutativity, if
v ⌣u1 ⌣··· ⌣un−1 ̸= 0
in
ˇH ∗(X/A,∗), then the corresponding element in
ˇH ∗(X,A) is also nonzero, hence
ℓ(X,A) ⩾n and the left inequality follows. The right-hand inequality is given in (5.5). □
The most important result concerning the notion of cup-length relates it to the Lusternik–
Schnirelmann category.
PROPOSITION 5.4 (compare Theorem 3.6 in [31]). If (X,Y) is a closed pair then
cat(X,Y) ⩾ℓ(X,Y).

5.6. Lefschetz theorem and the ﬁxed point index
Recall that if f :(X,A) →(X,A) is a continuous map, H is a homology or cohomology
functor over Q, and the vector-spaces Hq(X,A) are ﬁnitely dimensional and equal to zero
for almost all q then the Lefschetz number of f (with respect to H ) is deﬁned as
Λ(f ) :=
∞

q=0
(−1)q trHq(f ),
where trHq(f ) denotes the trace of the endomorphism Hq(f ) of Hq(X,A). If f is equal
to the identity on (X,A) then its Lefschetz number is denoted by χ(X,A) and is called the
Euler characteristic of (X,A) (with respect to H ), i.e.,
χ(X,A) =
∞

q=0
(−1)q dimHq(X,A).
If (X,A) is a pair of compact ANRs then the Lefschetz number is always deﬁned and
independent of the choice of H , and
Λ(f ) = Λ(f |X) −Λ(f |A),
where f |X :X →X and f |A :A →A are the restrictions of f . In particular,
χ(X,A) = χ(X) −χ(A).
Since homologies and cohomologies are homotopy invariants, we deﬁne
χ[X] := χ(X),
χ[X,x0] := χ(X,x0) = χ[X] −1.
PROPOSITION 5.5. If (X,A) is a closed pair and the Euler characteristic with respect to
the ˇCech cohomologies ˇχ(X,A) is deﬁned then
ˇχ(X,A) = ˇχ(X/A,∗) = ˇχ(X/A) −1.
Moreover, if X and A are compact ENRs then X/A is also a compact ENR and
χ(X,A) = χ(X/A,∗) = χ(X/A) −1
does not depend on the choice of homology or cohomology.
PROOF. This is a consequence of Remark 5.1 and [28, Chapter IV.8].
□
The Lefschetz number is used in formulation of the following well-known result:

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
635
PROPOSITION 5.6 (Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem). If X is a compact ANR, f :X →X
is a continuous map, and Λ(f ) ̸= 0 then f has a ﬁxed point.
Assume that X is an ENR. For a continuous map f :D →X, where D ⊂X, deﬁne its
set of ﬁxed points as
Fix(f ) :=

x ∈D: f (x) = x

.
DEFINITION 5.11. A set P is called an isolated set of ﬁxed points of f if it is compact
and there exists an open set U in X such that U ⊂D and
P = U ∩Fix(f ).
If Q is an isolated set of ﬁxed points of g :D →X, we write (f,P) ≃(g,Q) (and call
(f,P) homotopic to (g,Q)) if for every t ∈[0,1] there exist a map ft :D →X such that
F :D × [0,1] ∋(x,t) →

ft(x),t

∈X × [0,1]
is continuous and there exists an isolated set P ∗of ﬁxed points of F such that f0 = f ,
f1 = g, P = {x: (x,0) ∈P ∗}, and Q = {x: (x,1) ∈P ∗}.
To such an isolated set P one can associate an integer number ind(f,P), called the ﬁxed
point index, see the book [28]. We use a slightly different notation with respect to that in
the book of Dold; our ind(f,P) means the same as the index of f |U in [28]. Below we list
its properties:
PROPOSITION 5.7 (compare [28]).
(i) (Solvability) If ind(f,P) ̸= 0 then P ̸= ∅.
(ii) (Additivity) If P and Q are isolated sets of ﬁxed points of f and P ∩Q = ∅then
ind(f,P ∪Q) = ind(f,P) + ind(f,Q).
(iii) (Multiplicativity) If f :X →X and g :Y →Y, P and Q are isolated sets of ﬁxed
points of f and g, respectively, then
ind(f × g,P × Q) = ind(f,P)ind(g,Q).
(iv) (Homotopy Invariance) If (f,P) ≃(g,Q) then ind(f,P) = ind(g,Q).
(v) (Commutativity) If f :D →X′ and f ′ :D′ →X, where D ⊂X and D′ ⊂X′, and
P is an isolated set of ﬁxed points of f ′ ◦f then f (P) is an isolated set of ﬁxed
points of f ◦f ′ and
ind(f ′ ◦f,P) = indf ◦f ′,f (P).
(vi) (Lefschetz Property) If X is compact and f :X →X then
ind(f,Fix f ) = Λ(f ).

6. Properties of the asymptotic parts of Wa˙zewski sets
Roughly speaking, abstract Wa˙zewski-type theorems provide sufﬁcient conditions for
W \ W ∗̸= ∅
if W is a Wa˙zewski set. Here we consider the question what additional information on that
asymptotic part can be obtained from the properties of W and W −; in particular whether it
contains stationary or periodic points and what is its topology. In this section we concen-
trate on qualitative results valid for local semiﬂows. For some more accurate results which
are easier to handle if local ﬂows are considered we refer to the next section.
6.1. Estimates on the category of the asymptotic part
We assume that φ be a local semiﬂow on X. It seems that the paper [63] of Po´zniak was the
ﬁrst one in which the notion of category appeared in the context of the Wa˙zewski method
and Conley index. We base on some ideas from that paper.
THEOREM 6.1. Let W ⊂X be a Wa˙zewski set, Assume that both W and W −are ANRs
closed in X and Z is a closed subset of W. Then
catW

Z \ W ∗
⩾catW,W −(Z).
PROOF. Z \ W ∗is closed by Lemma 2.1. By Proposition 5.1, there exists U, a closed
neighborhood of Z \ W ∗in W such that catW(W \ W ∗) = catW(U). Put V := Z \ intU
(where int denotes the interior relative to W). It follows by Proposition 5.1
catW
Z \ W ∗ = catW (U) = catW(U) + catW,W −(V ) ⩾catW,W −(Z)
since Z = U ∪V and V ⊂W ∗, hence W −is a strong deformation retract of V ∪W −
in W.
□
Under the imposed conditions on W and W −, the above theorem can be regarded as an
extension of Corollary 2.3, since if W −is not a strong deformation retract of Z ∪W −in W
then, by deﬁnition, catW,W −(Z) ⩾1, hence cat(Z \ W ∗) ⩾1, hence Z \ W ∗is nonempty.
COROLLARY 6.1. If W is a Wa˙zewski set and W and W −are closed ANRs then
catW

W \ W ∗
⩾cat

W,W −
.
Recall that cat(W,W −) can be estimated using (5.3) or Proposition 5.2. Another esti-
mate using the notion of cup-length is given by Proposition 5.4.

6.2. Stationary points of gradient-like local semiﬂows

along nonconstant trajectories, i.e.,
g

if s < t whenever x is not a stationary point. φ is called a gradient-like local semiﬂow if
there exists a Liapunov function for φ.
An example which justiﬁes the name is a gradient local ﬂow on a Riemannian manifold,
i.e., the local ﬂow generated by
˙x = −∇g(x)
(6.1)
for a C1-class function g. In this case stationary points are critical points of g.
It is not difﬁcult to prove the following result:
PROPOSITION 6.1. If φ is gradient-like then each nonempty ω-limit set consists of sta-
tionary points.
By Corollary 2.5, it immediately follows:
COROLLARY 6.2. If a local semiﬂow φ on X is gradient-like, W ⊂X is a compact
Wa˙zewski set and W −is not a strong deformation retract of W then W contains a sta-
tionary point of φ.
6.3. Stationary points of local semiﬂows in the general case
Results on the existence of stationary points of semiﬂows without any gradient-like struc-
ture can be obtained using ﬁxed points theorems. The most useful for our purposes is the
Lefschetz theorem. It is a applied in a proof of the following result:
THEOREM 6.2 (compare Corollary 1 in [73]). If φ is a local semiﬂow on X, W and W −
are compact ANRs in X, and
χ

then W contains a stationary point of φ.
PROOF. Step 1. At ﬁrst we prove that for every T > 0 there exists a point x ∈W such that
φT (x) = x. Let S1 be the unit circle in the complex plane C. In the topological direct sum

i.e., a disjoint union of W and W −× S1 endowed with the inductive topology, identify
each point of W −⊂W with a point of W −× S1 via the map j :w

(compare [32, Proposition 7(4.8)]). By Step 1, there exists xn ∈
W such that φ(xn,2−n) =
xn. An accumulation point of the sequence {xn} is a stationary point of φ, hence the result
follows.

7. Isolating blocks and segments
We continue the series of results on properties of the asymptotic part of a Wa˙zewski set.
Here we additionally assume that the considered local semiﬂow is a local ﬂow and the
Wa˙zewski set is an isolating block. These assumptions enable us to provide various quan-
titative properties of the invariant part of the set in an easier way.
7.1. Isolating blocks and their structure
Let φ be a local ﬂow on a metrizable space X. At ﬁrst we should ﬁx terminology concern-
ing behavior of φ with respect to a given subset of X. Recall, that we have already deﬁned
the exit set and the asymptotic part in Section 2.1, the extended escape-time function in
Section 2.2, and we mentioned on an invariant part in Section 1.3. Let Z ⊂X. We provide

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
639
a list of notions related to Z which will be of our interest (for the full account we repeat
the deﬁnitions of Z−, Inv(Z), and σ +). Deﬁne the sets
Z−:=

x ∈Z: φ

x,[0,t]

̸⊂Z ∀t > 0

,
Z+ := x ∈Z: φx,[−t,0] ̸⊂Z ∀t > 0,
Inv±(Z) := x ∈Z: φ±(x) ⊂Z,
Inv(Z) := Inv−(Z) ∩Inv+(Z),
and functions σ ± :Z →[0,∞] by
σ +(x) := sup


⊂Z

,
σ −(x) := sup

t ⩾0: φ

x,[−t,0]

⊂Z

.
Obviously, Inv+(Z) is the asymptotic part of Z; it is also called the positive invariant part,
and Inv(Z) is the invariant part of Z. Moreover, Inv−(Z) is called the negative invariant
part and Z+ is called the entrance set of Z. (It should be pointed out that all the above
notions are deﬁned with respect to a ﬁxed φ and Z. In fact, a more proper notation should
indicate on φ, for example Invφ(Z) instead of Inv(B), σ ±
φ,Z instead of σ ±, etc. Neverthe-
less, for simplicity we avoid that notation whenever it does not lead to confusions.)
In Section 1.3, it was given a rough deﬁnition of the concept of isolating block. Here we
state it in a slightly more general context.
DEFINITION 7.1. A set B ⊂X is called an isolating block if
B = intB,
B, B−, and B+ are compact, and for every x ∈∂B \ (B−∪B+),
σ −(x) < ∞,
σ +(x) < ∞,

⊂∂B.
(In practice, one usually considers isolating blocks without sliding on the boundary, i.e.,
∂B = B+ ∪B−). By Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 we get immediately the following
properties of isolating blocks:
PROPOSITION 7.1. If B is an isolating block then
(i) B is a Wa˙zewski set for both φ and its reverse obtained by the transformation t 
→
−t of time,
(ii) the functions σ ± are continuous.
In the sequel we assume that B is an isolating block. In particular, it follows by Corol-
lary 2.5 that if B−or B+ is not a strong deformation retract of B then its invariant part

640

Inv(B) is nonempty. Our aim is to provide a more accurate information on its properties
that it was given for W \W ∗in Section 6. For this reason we introduce some other concepts
related to B. Denote by A(B) (or shortly A, if it does not lead to confusions) the subset of
B given by
A := A(B) := Inv−(B) ∪Inv+(B).
It follows, in particular, that its exit and entrance sets are given as
A± = A ∩B±.
Below we frequently use abbreviated notation for the invariant part of the isolating block B;
we put:
I := Inv(B).
The position of the mentioned sets in the block B can be seen on Figure 6.
Let B be an isolating block (with respect to the ﬂow φ).
DEFINITION 7.2. A set Z ⊂B is called B-invariant if for every x ∈Z the connected
component of φ(x) ∩B containing x is a subset of Z.
The connected component which appears in the above deﬁnition is equal to φ(x,Δ),
where Δ is the closed interval having σ −(x) and σ +(x) as the ends. In particular, it is
equal to φ(x) if x ∈I. The sets A and Inv±(B) are examples of B-invariant sets.
For n ∈N deﬁne
An :=

x ∈A: σ −(x) ⩾n, σ +(x) ⩾n

,
Bn :=

x ∈B: σ −(x) + σ +(x) ⩾n

⊃A.
In particular, Bn is B-invariant, A0 = A, B0 = B, and B±
n = B± ∩Bn. We list some prop-
erties of those sets:

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
641
LEMMA 7.1.
(i) Bn is a neighborhood of A in B and for every neighborhood U of A there exists n
such that Bn ⊂U.
(ii) For every n there exists a compact set Dn ⊂B,
Bn+1 ∪B−⊂Dn ⊂Bn ∪B−
such that Dn is a strong deformation retract of Z ∪B−for every B-invariant set Z
such that Bn ⊂Z. In particular, Dn is a strong deformation retract of B as well as
of Bn ∪B−.
(iii) For every neighborhood V of I there exists n such that An ⊂V .
(iv) An+1 is a strong deformation retract of An for every n.
(v) Inv±(B) ∩An+1 is a strong deformation retract of Inv±(B) ∩An for every n.
PROOF. In the proof we frequently refer to the continuity of σ ± (see Proposition 7.1).
Ad (i) and (iii). They immediately follow by that continuity.
Ad (ii). Let f :B−→[0,1] be a continuous function such that f (x) = 0 if σ −(x) ⩽n
and f (x) = 1 if σ −(x) ⩾n + 1. Deﬁne g :B−→[0,n + 1] by
g(x) =
f (x)σ −(x),
if σ −(x) ⩽n + 1,
n + 1,
if σ −(x) ⩾n + 1.
In particular, g(x) ⩽σ −(x) for x ∈B−. The set
Dn := Bn+1 ∪

As a consequence we get the following estimate on the category of I:
THEOREM 7.1 (compare Theorem 3.1 in [63]). If B and B−are ANRs then
cat(I) ⩾catB,B−.
PROOF. Lemma 7.1(iii) implies
I =

n∈N
An ∩Inv+(B),
hence the result follows by Proposition 5.1(iv), Corollary 6.1, and Lemma 7.1(v).
□
7.2. Estimates on the cohomology of the invariant part
We begin with the case B−or B+ empty. It follows I is an attractor (or, in other termi-
nology, an asymptotically stable set) for the ﬂow φ or, respectively, its reverse. In that case
we have a satisfactory information on the topology of I given by the following result:
THEOREM 7.2. If B−= ∅or B+ = ∅then the inclusion I &→B induces an isomorphism
ˇH ∗(B) →ˇH ∗(I).
PROOF. Assume that B−= ∅(for a proof in the other case it sufﬁces to reverse the di-
rection of time). For every t ⩾0 the inclusion φt(B) &→B induces an isomorphism in the
cohomologies,

t⩾0
φt(B) = I,
hence the result is an immediate consequence of the continuity property of the ˇCech coho-
mologies (compare [71]).
□
REMARK 7.1. Actually, it is not difﬁcult to prove a stronger result: I &→B is a shape
equivalence (compare [38]; more information on the notion of shape can be found in [15]).
In [38], there is an example in which B is an annular region of the plane and I is the
Warsaw circle, hence, in general, the shape equivalence cannot be further improved to the
homotopy equivalence.
On the other hand, if neither B−nor B+ is empty, usually one cannot get enough infor-
mation from B to determine the topology of I, as it is indicated on the following example:
EXAMPLE 7.1. Let φ be a local ﬂow generated by a vector-ﬁeld v in Rn. Assume that
B is an isolating block for φ and there exists an x0 ∈intB such that 0 < σ ±(x0) < ∞.
In particular, x0 /∈I, hence v(x0) ̸= 0. Let D be an (n −1)-dimensional disc centered at

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
643
x0 and contained in the afﬁne hyperplane perpendicular to v(x0) such that v is transversal
to D. By the continuity of σ ±, we can assume that
0 < σ ±(y) < ∞,
for every y ∈D.
(7.1)
Let K be an arbitrary compact set contained in D and let g :Rn →[0,∞) be a continuous
function such that
K =

x ∈Rn: g(x) = 0

.
It follows by (7.1) that B is an isolating block for the local ﬂow generated by
˙x = g(x)v(x),
its invariant part is equal to I ∪K, and I ∩K = ∅. The latter implies that ˇH ∗(K) is a direct
factor of ˇH ∗(I ∪K). Except of some limitations which we do not precise here, ˇH q(K)
is an arbitrary countably generated Abelian group if 0 ⩽q ⩽n −2 and is equal to zero if
q ⩾n −1 since K is homeomorphic to a subset of Rn−1, hence ˇH q(I ∪K) is at least as
complicated.
From the above example we conclude that the ˇCech cohomology of the invariant part of
B can be almost arbitrarily complex. Thus, in general one can at most expect to estimate
the “lower bound” of the cohomology of I. We provide several results in this direction.
A majority of them can be duplicated by substituting B+ instead of B−, etc.
Our ﬁrst aim is to present an exact sequence which connects the cohomologies of I,
(B,B−), and A−due to Churchill in [18].
PROPOSITION 7.2 (compare Lemma 4.3 in [18]). The inclusion (A,A−) &→(B,B−) in-
duces an isomorphism ˇH ∗(B,B−) →ˇH ∗(A,A−).
PROOF. By Lemma 7.1, the homotopy and excision properties of the cohomology imply
that the inclusions induce a sequence of isomorphisms

B,B− ∼= ˇH ∗
Dn,B− ∼= H ∗
Bn ∪B−,B− ∼= H ∗

for every n. It follows that the inclusion (Bn+1,B−

PROPOSITION 7.3 (compare Proposition 4.6 in [18]). The inclusion I &→A induces an
isomorphism ˇH ∗(A) →ˇH ∗(I).
PROOF. It follows by Lemma 7.1 that the inclusion An+1 &→An induces an isomorphism
in cohomologies and

n∈N
An = I,
hence the result follows by the properties of homotopy and continuity of the ˇCech coho-
mology.

in which βq is induced by the inclusion for every q ∈Z.
PROOF. By Propositions 7.2 and 7.3, it sufﬁces to substitute ˇH q(A,A−) →ˇH q(A) by βq
in the exact sequence of the pair (A,A−).
□
The above result is not completely satisfactory since the term ˇH ∗(A−) in the exact se-
quence cannot be determined from B and B−alone. Nevertheless, some estimates can be
obtained by its application. In the following corollary and example, χ and ˇχ denote the
Euler characteristic with respect to singular cohomologies and, respectively, ˇCech coho-
mologies. A standard fact from homological algebra on exact sequences and the corre-
sponding Euler characteristics leads to the following
COROLLARY 7.1. If two Euler characteristics among ˇχ(I), ˇχ(B,B−), and ˇχ(A−) are
deﬁned, then the third one is also deﬁned and

EXAMPLE 7.2. Let a 2-dimensional manifold be the phase space of the considered local
ﬂow. Assume that an isolating block B is a manifold with boundary and B−is a sub-
manifold with boundary of ∂B (for example, given as a generalized polyfacial set like
in Remark 3.2). In that case B and B−are compact ENRs, hence the ˇCech cohomolo-
gies of (B,B−) are isomorphic to the corresponding singular cohomologies. Moreover,
ˇH q(B,B−) is ﬁnite-dimensional for every q and equal to zero if q ⩾3 and B−is the
union of components each of which is homeomorphic to the circle S1 or to the interval
[0,1]. Thus the set A−consists of the union of some number of the components of B−
homeomorphic to the circle and a set K homeomorphic to a compact subset of R. If K
has inﬁnitely many components then from the exact sequence in Theorem 7.3 we con-
clude that ˇH 0(I) is inﬁnitely generated (hence I has inﬁnitely many components) because

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
645
Imγ 0 = kerδ0 and kerδ0 is inﬁnite-dimensional since dim ˇH 1(B,B−) < ∞. In the oppo-
site case, the subset K consists of a ﬁnite number of isolated points and sets homeomorphic
to [0,1]. Since the Euler characteristic of the circle is equal to zero,

(7.2)
Denote by 1 the unit element in the ring of coefﬁcients R of the ˇCech cohomol-
ogy. The following notation will also be used: if (Y,Y ′) ⊂(X,X′) and u ∈ˇH ∗(X,X′)
then u|(Y,Y ′) denotes the image of u under the homomorphism induced by the inclusion
(Y,Y ′) &→(X,X′). The next theorem is an equivalent version of a result of Floer (compare
[30, Proposition 2]—it is written there that another version of that result was stated by
Benci in an unpublished report). The proof given here is taken form [77].
THEOREM 7.4. If for u ∈ˇH ∗(B) there exists v ∈ˇH ∗(B,B−) such that u ⌣v ̸= 0 then
u|I ̸= 0 in ˇH ∗(I).

the vertical arrows are generated by the inclusions and those induced by (A,A−) &→
(B,B−) is an isomorphism by Proposition 7.2, hence
u|A ⌣v|(A,A−) = (u ⌣v)|(A,A−) ̸= 0.
Thus u|A ̸= 0. Since I &→A induces an isomorphism by Proposition 7.3,
u|I = (u|A)|I ̸= 0,
hence the result follows.
□
By Theorem 7.4, if v ∈ˇH ∗(B,B−) is nonzero then 1 ⌣v = v ̸= 0 (where 1 is treated as
the element of ˇH 0(B)), hence 1|I ̸= 0, which means I ̸= ∅. Thus, in the case of isolating
block, Theorem 7.4 is a generalization of a weaker variant of Corollary 2.5, in which the
condition ˇH ∗(B,B−) ̸= 0 replaces the condition B−is not a strong deformation retract
of B.
In the following simple example we explain the meaning of Theorem 7.4.

646

EXAMPLE 7.3. Consider the ﬂow on the punctured plane Rn \ 0 such the annulus
B =

(r,θ): 1 ⩽r ⩽2

(written in the polar coordinates) is an isolating block for the ﬂow and its exit set B−is
equal the boundary of B, see Figure 7. Assume for simplicity that R = Z2, hence there
is one generator u of ˇH 1(B) and one generator v of ˇH 1(B,B−). On the ﬁgure, they are
represented by their supports: u as the vertical segment and v as the circle inside B. Their
cup-product u ⌣v, represented as the intersection of the supports of u and v, is the gener-
ator of ˇH 2(B,B−). It follows, by Theorem 7.4 that u|Inv(B) ̸= 0.
Actually, in that particular example (which was chosen because of its visualization on
the plane) the same conclusion is given by Theorem 7.2. This is not the case in the next
example which is a direct generalization of the above one.
EXAMPLE 7.4. Now we use different letters to denote the sets considered in the previous
example: put
G :=

(r,θ) ∈R2: 1 ⩽r ⩽2

,
H :=

(r,θ) ∈R2: r ∈{1,2}

As usual, Dq and Sq−1 denote the unit ball and, respectively, the unit sphere centered at
zero in Rq. Consider a local ﬂow in the phase space
X =

R2 \ 0

× Rm+n

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
647
and assume that the isolating block and its exit set are given by
B := G × Dm × Dn,
B−:= H × Dm × Dn ∪G × Sm−1 × Dn.
We assume again that R = Z2 and let u ∈ˇH 1(G), v ∈ˇH 1(G,H), and z ∈ˇH m(Dm ×
Dn,Sm−1 × Dn) be the generators. It follows that
(u × 1) ⌣(v × z) = (u ⌣v) × z ̸= 0,
where × denotes the cohomological cross-product (compare [28]) and 1 ∈ˇH 0(Dm × Dn)
is the unit element, hence Theorem 7.4 implies
(u × 1)|I ̸= 0.
From that conclusion we can get slightly more information than just ˇH 1(I) ̸= 0. Let
π :G × Dm × Dn →G
be the projection. For an arbitrarily chosen θ0 ∈[0,2π) put
R := (r,θ) ∈G: θ = θ0
.
We assert that
π(I) ∩R ̸= ∅.
Indeed, since ˇH 1(π)(u) = u × 1,
u|π(I) ̸= 0.
Since the inclusion G &→(G,G \ R) induces an isomorphism in ˇH 1, there exists w ∈
ˇH 1(G,G \ R) such that u = w|G. It follows that
w|(π(I),π(I)\R) ̸= 0,
hence π(I) \ R ⊊π(I) which veriﬁes the assertion.
The conclusions in the above example do not follow from Theorem 7.2 if n ⩾1. It
should also be noted that the usage of the ˇCech cohomologies is essential; in general the
above results are non valid for the singular cohomologies by the example mentioned in
Remark 7.1. In the paper [30], the version of Theorem 7.4 was formulated using the notion
of cup-length. The following immediate consequence of Theorem 7.4 estimates the cup-
length of the invariant part of an isolating block.

7.3. On the number of stationary points of gradient-like ﬂows
Let g :X →R be a Liapunov function for a local ﬂow φ on X. For a ∈R we write
ga := g−1(a).
DEFINITION 7.3. The set ga is called a level of g. It is called a critical level if it contains
a stationary point; in this case a is called a critical value. In the other case it is called
noncritical.
For a < b put
gb
a := g−1
[a,b]

.
Now we recall the most fundamental result concerning the notion of category. Usually, it
is stated for gradient ﬂows. Here we provide its topological version.
PROPOSITION 7.4. Let g be a Liapunov function on X. If gb
a is a compact ANR, ga and
gb are noncritical levels then

PROOF. Put k =: cat(gb
a,ga). First of all observe that k ⩽∞since the category of a com-
pact ANR is ﬁnite (which is easy to prove; see [16]) and (5.2) holds. We can assume that
the number of stationary points is ﬁnite and k ⩾1; otherwise there is nothing to prove.
Thus there is a ﬁnite number of critical levels between a and b. We adapt the standard
mini-max argument. For i = 1,...,k deﬁne
Ci :=

C ⊂gb
a: C compact, catgba,ga(C) ⩾i

ci := inf

We claim that ci is a critical value. Indeed, in the other case there exists an ε > 0 such that
a < ci −ε < ci + ε < b and there are no critical values in the interval [ci −ε,ci + ε] since
the set of critical values is ﬁnite. It follows that gci+ε
ci−ε is an isolating block and gci−ε is
its exit set. Since that set has the invariant part empty by Remark 6.1, there is a strong
deformation retraction r :gci+ε
ci−ε →gci−ε. It follows that if C ∈Ci and maxx∈C g(x) <
ci + ε then r(C) ∈Ci and
max
x∈r(C)g(x) = ci −ε
which is a contradiction. The critical values ci are ordered
a < c1 ⩽··· ⩽ck < b

since Cj ⊂Ci if i < j. Denote by Kci the set of stationary points contained in gci. It sufﬁces
to prove that if ci = ci+q then
catgba(Kci) = q + 1,
since in that case Kci contain at least q + 1 different points.
Let ε > 0 be such that a < ci −ε < ci + ε < b and ci = ci+q is the only critical value in
[ci −ε,ci + ε]. Since there exists C ∈Ci+q such that C ⊂gci+ε

Denote B := gci+ε
ci−ε. It is an isolating block, B−= gci−ε and Inv(B) = Kci by Remark 6.1.
We can apply Proposition 5.1(iv) since ga is an ANR. Indeed, let δ > 0 be such that there
are no critical points in [a,a + δ]. It follows that ga is a strong deformation retract of
{x: a ⩽g(x) < a + δ}. The latter set is open in gb
a, hence it is an ANR by Theorem of
Hanner (compare [13]) and ga is an ANR as well. Thus, by Lemma 7.1 and by Propo-
sition 5.1(iii) and (iv), for n and m sufﬁciently large we have the following sequence of
equations:
catgba(Kci) = catgba(Am) = catgba(A) = catgba(Bn).

G is a Liapunov function for ψ and the stationary points of φ restricted to B and ψ coin-
cide. Let a < b be such that
a < ming(B) ⩽maxg(B) < b
It follows that a and b are noncritical values of G. Put

EXAMPLE 7.5. The following fact was essential in the proof of an Arnold’s conjecture by
Conley and Zehnder (compare [23]): if
B = T q × Dm × Dn,
is an isolating block for a gradient-like ﬂow, where T q is the q-dimensional torus, and
B−= T q × Sm−1 × Dn
then there are at least q + 1 stationary points contained in B. Indeed, in this case
ℓB,B− = q + 1
hence the result follows by Proposition 5.4 and Theorem 7.5.
REMARK 7.2. Results on the existence and the number of critical points of functionals are
essential in variational methods. Since the spaces considered in those methods are inﬁnite-
dimensional, usually direct applications of results based on algebraic topology fail there.
For some functionals it is possible, however, to pass to a ﬁnite dimension by the saddle-
point reduction due to Amann and Zehnder (compare [2]). In particular, it was applied in
the paper [23] to reduce the initial problem to calculation of the number of critical points
inside the isolating block mentioned in Example 7.5.
7.4. Fixed point index and the index of stationary points
Using Theorem 6.2 one can check whether the set of stationary points inside of an isolating
block is nonempty. Below we provide quantitative information on properties of that set
using the notion of ﬁxed point index.
Assume that X is a ENR, φ is a local ﬂow on X, and B is an isolating block.
LEMMA 7.2. For every T > 0,
IT :=

x ∈I: φT (x) = x

is an isolated set of ﬁxed points of φT .
Let U be an open subset of X such that U is compact and there are no stationary points
of φ in ∂U. It follows that there is an ε > 0 such that the set
Kt(U) :=

x ∈U: φt(x) = x

is an isolated set of ﬁxed points of φt for every t such that 0 < t < ε. By Proposition 5.7(iv),
the indexes of Ks(U) and Kt(U) coincide if s and t are nonzero and small, hence we can
deﬁne an integer number
i(φ,U) := lim
0<t→0indφt,Kt(U).

652
R. Srzednicki
We call the number i(φ,U) the index of stationary points of φ in U (compare [72, Sec-
tion 4]). It inherits properties of the ﬁxed point index. It can be proved that if X = Rn and
φ is generated by a C1-class vector-ﬁeld v then
i(φ,U) = (−1)n deg(0,v,U),
where deg denotes the Brouwer degree.
THEOREM 7.6 (compare Theorem 4.4 in [72]). If B is an isolating block on X and B and
B−are ENRs, and T > 0 then
ind(φT ,IT ) = χ

B,B−
,
i(φ,intB) = χ

B,B−
.
PROOF. The second equation is a consequence of the ﬁrst one and the deﬁnition of the
index. Since the ﬁrst equation is a particular case of the more general equation in The-
orem 7.7 below, we do not provide its rigorous proof here. We mention only that it can
be proved by a careful examination of Step 1 in the proof of Theorem 6.2. Indeed, the
corresponding indexes of φT in B and ψT at IT coincide by Proposition 5.7(v) and the
index of ﬁxed points of ψT is equal to χ(
B) by (vi) in that proposition. By those facts it
is easy to conclude the required property; for a detailed argument we refer to the proof of
Theorem 7.7 (or to [72]).
□
It should be pointed out that all proper T -periodic points do not contribute to ind(φT ,IT )
since both indexes are equal to the same number χ(B,B−). In the case of a local ﬂow
generated by a smooth vector-ﬁeld on a Riemannian manifold, B being a manifold with
boundary and B−its submanifold (like in Remark 3.2) the above result is a particular case
of the formula of Pugh generalizing the Poincaré index formula (compare [34,64]).
EXAMPLE 7.6. The index of stationary points contained in the isolating block in Figure 1
or Figure 6 is equal to −1, while in the isolating block in Figure 7 it is equal to 0.
EXAMPLE 7.7. As in Example 7.2, we assume that X is a 2-dimensional manifold, the
isolating block B is a manifold with boundary, and B−is a submanifold with boundary
of ∂B. Assume that the invariant part I of B consists only of a single stationary point. It
follows by (7.2) and Theorem 7.6 that
i(φ,intB) ⩽1.
7.5. Isolating segments
It is convenient to use special kinds of isolating blocks if the considered local semiﬂow is
generated by a nonautonomous equation in its extended phase space. As in Section 3.1, let

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
653
M be a smooth Riemannian manifold, U open subset of R × M, and let w :U →T M be
a continuous mapping such that w(t,x) ∈TxM. We assume that the system (3.9) satisﬁes
the uniqueness property of the Cauchy problem and let φ be the induced local ﬂow on U.
It follows that φ is of a special form: there is a map Φ :(σ,τ,x) 
→Φσ,τ(x), called the
evolutionary operator for (3.8), such that
φt(σ,x) =

σ + t,Φσ,σ+t(x)

for (σ,x) ∈U. In particular,
Φs,s = id,
Φs,u = Φt,u ◦Φs,t.
Actually, basing on that properties, the evolutionary operator can be deﬁned in a purely
topological way and the results presented below are valid in that more general setting; here
we do not develop that approach.
At ﬁrst we ﬁx the notation concerning the extended phase space. For a subset Z of R×M
we put
Zt :=

x ∈M: (t,x) ∈Z

and by π1 and π2 we denote the projections R × M →R and, respectively, R × M →M.
Let a and b be real numbers, a < b.
DEFINITION 7.4. A compact set W ⊂U is called an isolating segment over [a,b] for
(3.8) if the exit and entrance sets W ± with respect to the local ﬂow φ are also compact and
∂W = W + ∪W −
(hence W is an isolating block for φ), there exist compact subsets W −−and W ++ of ∂W
(called, respectively, the proper exit set and the proper entrance set) such that
W −=

{b} × Wb

∪W −−,
W + =

{a} × Wa

∪W ++,
and there exists a homeomorphism
h:[a,b] × Wa →W
satisfying π1 ◦h = π1 such that
h

[a,b] × W −−
a

= W −−,
h

[a,b] × W ++
a

= W ++.
It follows, in particular, that if B is an isolating block for an autonomous equation (1.1)
satisfying ∂B = B+ ∪B−then for every a and b the set W = [a,b] × B is an isolating
segment and
W −−= [a,b] × B−,
W ++ = [a,b] × B+.

Fig. 8.
A more complicated example of an isolating segment is drawn in Figure 8. Here W is equal
to the twisted prism with hexagonal base and each of the sets W −−and W ++ consists of
three disjoint ribbons winding around the prism.
Isolating segments are useful in proofs of results concerning the existence of solutions of
two-point boundary value problems, as we show below in the case of the periodic problem.
In [78], a more general notion of isolating chain was considered. (By deﬁnition, it is an
isolating block being the union of contiguous isolating segments in the extended phase
space of a nonautonomous equation.)
Let W be an isolating segment over [a,b]. A homeomorphism h in Deﬁnition 7.4 in-
duces a homeomorphism
m:

Wa,W −−
a

→

Wb,W −−
b

,
m(x) := π2h

b,π2h−1(a,x)

.
We call m a monodromy homeomorphism of the isolating segment W. It depends on h,
however one can prove the monodromy homeomorphisms determined by different choices
of h are homotopic each to the other. It follows that the isomorphism in homologies
μW := H(m):H

Wa,W −−
a

→H

Wb,W −−
b

is an invariant of W.
DEFINITION 7.5. An isolating segment W over [a,b] is called periodic if Wa = Wb,
W −−
a
= W −−
b
, and W ++
a
= W ++
b
.
The segment shown in Figure 8 is periodic. If W is periodic then μW is an automor-
phism of H(Wa,W −−
a
). Let H has coefﬁcients in Q. If, moreover, both Wa and W −−
a
are
ANRs then the Lefschetz number Λ(m) is deﬁned and independent of the choice of the
monodromy homeomorphism. Thus we can deﬁne
ΛW := Λ(m).

THEOREM 7.7 (compare Theorem 7.1 in [74]). Let W be a periodic isolating segment
over [a,b]. Then the set
KW :=

x ∈Wa: Φa,b(x) = x, Φa,t(x) ∈Wt ∀t ∈[a,b]

is an isolated set of ﬁxed points of Φa,b and if W, W −−, and W ++ are ENRs then
ind(Φa,b,KW ) = ΛW.
PROOF. Observe ﬁrst that ∂Wa = W −−
a
∪W ++
a
. Indeed, by the open mapping theorem,
h−1(intW) is open in R × M. Since ∂W = W −∪W +,
h−1(intW) = (a,b) ×

Wa \

W −−
a
∪W ++
a

.
Thus the image of h−1(intW) under the projection π2 onto M is equal to Wa \ (W −−
a
∪
W ++
a
) and is also open, hence it is equal to the interior of Wa and the assertion follows.
Since KW does not intersect ∂Wa, it is open and compact in the set of ﬁxed points of Φa,b,
hence it is isolated.
For a proof of the rest of the conclusion we deﬁne a map mt :Wt →Wa, where a ⩽t ⩽b,
by
mt(x) := π2h

b,π2h−1(t,x)

(recall that we assume Wa = Wb). In particular, ma = m and mb = id. Moreover, for x ∈
Wa put
τ(z) := a + σ +(a,z) ⩽b,
where σ + is the escape-time function for W (with respect to φ). We use a similar adjunc-
tion as in the proof of Theorem 6.2:
Z := Wa ∪j
W −−
a
× S1,
where j :x 
→(x,1) for x ∈W −−
a
(i.e., in the disjoint union of Wa and W −−
a
× S1 we
identify W −−
a
with W −−
a
× {1}). By assumptions, Z is an ENR. Deﬁne a map Ψ :Z ×
[a,b] →Z by
Ψ (z,t) :=
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩

It is easy to check that Ψ is continuous. Put Ψt(z) := Ψ (z,t). In particular,
Ψa|W −−
a
×S1 = m|W −−
a
× idS1,

656
R. Srzednicki
hence Λ(Ψa|W −−
a
×S1) = 0. Since Ψa ≃Ψb, it follows by the Mayer–Vietoris exact se-
quence
Λ(Ψb) = Λ(Ψa) = Λ(Ψa|Wa) + Λ(Ψa|W −−
a
×S1) −Λ(Ψa|W −−
a
)
= Λ(m|Wa) −Λ(m|W −−
a
) = ΛW.
It follows by the construction of Ψ that
Fix(Ψb) = KW.
By the commutativity property of the ﬁxed point index and the Lefschetz theorem (see
Proposition 5.7(v) and (vi)),
ind(Φa,b,KW ) = ind(Ψb,KW ) = ΛW ,
which terminates the proof of the theorem.
□
As an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.7(i) and Theorem 7.7 we get
COROLLARY 7.3. If W is a periodic isolating segment over [a,b] and ΛW ̸= 0 then the
periodic problem
x(a) = x(b)
associated to Equation (3.8) has a solution.
Let T > 0 and U = R × M. An important special case of the theorem arises if w is
T -periodic in t, i.e., if
w(t,x) = w(t + T,x)
for every t ∈R and x ∈M. In this case
Φs,t = Φs+T,t+T .
(7.5)
The map Φ0,T is called the Poincaré map and its ﬁxed points are initial points of T -periodic
solutions of (3.8). In particular, if ΛW ̸= 0 then at least one T -periodic solution exists. If
w does not depend on t, B is an isolating block for w and W = [0,T ] × B then the ﬁrst
equation in Theorem 7.6 is a corollary of Theorem 7.7 as we have pointed out already. The
following three examples illustrating the above results are taken from [74].
EXAMPLE 7.8. Consider a planar differential equation
˙z = e2πit ¯z2 + f (t,z),
(7.6)

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
657
where z ∈C and f :R × C →C is continuous, f (t + 1,z) = f (t,z) for all t and z, and
lim
|z|→∞
f (t,z)
|z|2
= 0
uniformly in t ∈R.
One can ﬁnd an isolating segment W over [0,1] for (7.6) which is the twisted prism over
a hexagonal base like on the Figure 8 (see [74]; actually it is a regular polyfacial set—
compare Deﬁnition 3.2). Its monodromy homeomorphism m is equal to the rotation by the
angle 2π
3 . Thus m is homotopic to the identity on the hexagon W0 and alternates the three
disjoint segments forming W −−
0
, hence
ΛW = Λ(m|W0) −Λ(m|W −−
0
) = 1 −0 = 1.
By Corollary 7.3 we conclude that (7.6) has a 1-periodic point.
EXAMPLE 7.9. We consider a particular case of (7.6),
˙z = e2πit ¯z2 + ¯z.
(7.7)
Here 0 is a 1-periodic solution, hence we are looking for another one. There is another
isolating segment Z ⊂W over [0,1] for (7.7)
Z := [0,1] ×

z ∈C: |ℜz| ⩽δ, |ℑz| ⩽δ

for 0 < δ sufﬁciently small. Here Z is a prism with rectangular base and Z−−consists of
its top and bottom sides. It is easy to observe that
ΛZ = χ(Z0) −χ

Z−−
0

= 1 −2 = −1.
If KW = KZ = {0} then
1 = ΛW = ΛZ = −1,
which is a contradiction, hence (7.7) has a nonzero 1-periodic solution.
EXAMPLE 7.10. We consider another equation
˙z = e2πit ¯z2 + z.
(7.8)
Here we try again to get a nonzero periodic solution. Now there is an isolating segment
U ⊂W,
U := [0,1] ×

z ∈C: |z| < ε


658
R. Srzednicki
for 0 < ε small. However, it is easy to observe that
ΛU = χ

D2
−χ

S1
= 1 −0 = 1,
hence we cannot predict the existence of nonzero 1-periodic solution as it was done in the
previous example. In fact, we are able to prove the existence of a 3-periodic solution. Let

W := W ∪τ1(W) ∪τ2(W),
where τT for a real number T is the translation of R × C given by
τT (x,z) := (x + T,z).

W is an isolating segment over [0,3] which consists of glued three copies of W. Its mon-
odromy homeomorphismcan be obtained as the composition of three rotations by the angle
2π
3 , hence it is equal the identity and thus
Λ 
W = 1 −3 = −2.
Put also

U := [0,3] ×

z ∈C: |z| < ε

,
hence
Λ 
W = −2 ̸= 1 = Λ
U
and the conclusion follows.
Actually, the results given in the above examples extend to equations with Fourier–
Taylor polynomials on the right-hand side, see, for example, [74]. Moreover, Theorem 7.7
can be generalized to the case of two point boundary value problems of the form
x(a) = g

x(b)

for some function g :M →M (see [76]) and to periodic isolating chains (see [78]).
8. Selected applications of the Wa˙zewski method
We provide some applications of the results stated above. We begin with an application
to problems concerning asymptotic properties of solutions, then we present a proof of a
classical result on the existence of solutions of two-point boundary value problems for a
second-order equation, and ﬁnally we state a result on the existence of a kind of chaotic
dynamics.

8.1. Asymptotic solutions
The most natural applications of the Wa˙zewski method refer to the existence of solutions
remaining in a given set; for instance, theorems on bounded solutions can be provided in
this way. If the considered sets in the extended phase space contract as time tends to in-
ﬁnity, the obtained solutions represent the corresponding asymptotic properties. There are
many results of this type in the literature. In particular, theorems on solutions which tend to
constant mappings are contained, for example, in [48,66,84,88] (the result in [48] is repro-
duced also in [65]) and results on asymptotic coincidence of solutions of two systems are,
among others, in [45,53,55,56,82]. Some other asymptotic results for ordinary equations
are given in [10,25,39,41,46,69,83], for retarded differential equations in [27,80], for par-
tial differential equations of the ﬁrst order in [59,60], and for the second order in [61]. For
an illustration of this kind of applications of the Wa˙zewski method, here we provide a proof
of an asymptotic result for a linear equation. Let A = (aij) and B = (bij) be continuous
real (n × n)-matrix-valued functions and we consider an equation
˙x = A(t)x + B(t)x
(8.1)
in Rn. We assume that A(t) is diagonal for every t, i.e.,
aij = 0
if i ̸= j
(8.2)
and consider the question of estimating the size of B in order to get the existence of linearly
independent solutions x1,...,xn of (8.1), where xk = (x1
k,...,xn
k ) for k = 1,...,n, such
that xi
k(t)/xk
k(t) →0 if t →∞and i ̸= k. In particular, if B(t) = 0 for every t and xk(t0)
is equal to the kth vector of the canonical basis of Rn for some t0 ∈R then clearly xk
are linearly independent and xi
k = 0 for i ̸= k. If B is nonzero then such estimates were
obtained by Perron and later they were improved by Szmydtówna in [81] and Onuchic in
[55] using the method of Wa˙zewski. Here we follow [55].
THEOREM 8.1 (compare Theorem II-1 in [55]). Assume (8.2). Let R > 0 and let
h:[R,∞) →(0,∞) be a continuous function such that for all i ̸= j,

Moreover,
φ(t) > 0
for every t ∈R
(8.7)
since the last term in g(t) is greater then 0 and
lim
t→∞φ(t) = 0

since (8.4) and (8.5) hold. In particular, there exists T > R such that
φ(t) < 1

Indeed, the only solutions passing through ∂Vk \ Ek are the zero solution and solutions
through t = T , hence no one of them initiates at Vk. For a proof of (8.10), let (t,v) ∈Li.

hence (8.10) is proved. Thus
Wk := Vk ∪Ek
is a Wa˙zewski set and Ek is its exit set. Choose an ε > 0 such that if M = (mij) is an
(n × n)-matrix satisfying mii = 1 and |mij| < ε for i ̸= j then M is nondegenerate. Let t0

Thus Zk ⊂Wk, Zk is homeomorphic to the disk Dn−1, and Zk ∩Ek is homeomorphic to
the sphere Sn−2, hence it is not a retract of Zk. Moreover, there is a retraction
r = (r0,r1,...,rn):Ek →Zk ∩Ek

for t ⩾t0.
It follows by the choice of t0 and ε that the matrix having the vectors xk(t0) as the columns

Moreover, if i ̸= k,

8.2. Two-point boundary value problems
It was already indicated in [85] how to apply the Wa˙zewski theorem in proofs of the ex-
istence of solutions of two-point boundary value problems characterized by separate con-
ditions at the initial and ﬁnal values of time (like (1.10); compare Example 1.2). Later,
there appeared several papers on those applications, for example [5,7,26,40,42]. Another
approach, based on the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem, was applied in [74,76] to the peri-
odic problem and its generalizations (see Section 7.5). We illustrate those applications of
the Wa˙zewski method by providing a proof of a classical result on the existence of solu-
tions of several boundary value problems associated to the second order scalar differential
equation (3.20), i.e.,
x′′ = g(t,x,x′)
with continuous g :R3 →R, satisfying the Bernstein–Nagumo growth conditions. For a <
b we consider the boundary-value conditions
x(a) = x(b) = 0
(Dirichlet),
(8.11)
x′(a) = x′(b) = 0
(Neumann),
(8.12)
−αx(a) + βx′(a) = 0,
γ x(b) + δx′(b) = 0
(Sturm–Liouville; α,β,γ,δ > 0),
(8.13)
x(a) = x(b),
x′(a) = x′(b)
(periodic).

THEOREM 8.2 (Bernstein–Nagumo). If there exists an R > 0 and a function
ψ :[0,∞) →(0,∞)

(c) for every t ∈R, |x| ⩽R and v ∈R,


,
then the boundary value problems (8.11)–(8.14) associated to (3.20) have solutions whose
images are contained in the interval [−R,R].
PROOF. Assume that (3.20) satisﬁes the uniqueness property. Let Ψ :[0,∞) →[0,∞) be
deﬁned as
Ψ (u) :=
 u

σ dσ
ψ(σ).
Put
W := [a,b] ×

(x,y) ∈R2: |x| ⩽R −Ψ

|y|

⊂R3.
We prove that W is an isolating segment for (3.21). Observe ﬁrst that W is compact by (b).
Deﬁne functions ℓ, m, n+, and n−by
ℓ(t,x,y) := t −b,
m(t,x,y) := a −t,
n±(t,x,y) = ±x −R + Ψ

|y|

,
where (t,x,y) ∈R3. W is therefore a generalized polyfacial set determined by {ℓ,m,n+,
n−}. Since

it follows by (a), (c), (3.22), and (3.23) that intW is a generalized polyfacial set for (3.21),
and moreover, W is an isolating segment such that the proper exit and entrance sets are
equal to, respectively,
W −−= (t,x,y) ∈W: xy ⩾0, |x| = R −Ψ |y|,

Both W ±± consist of two disjoint strips, each of which is equal to an arc in R2 multiplied
by [a,b]. It follows that
ΛW = χ(Wa) −χ

W −−


= 1 −2 = −1,
hence Corollary 7.3 implies that the periodic problem (8.14) has a solution. For the other
problems let us consider the sets Z ⊂W and Y ⊂W −such that
Z :=

(a,x,y) ∈W: −αx + βy = 0

,
W −\ Y = (b,x,y) ∈W: γ x + δy = 0,
where α,β,γ,δ ⩾0, α+β > 0, and γ +δ > 0. It follows that Z is connected, Z∩W −⊂Y
consists of two points, and W −\ Y separates W −into two disjoint parts each of which
contains a point of Z ∩Y. Thus Z ∩Y is a retract of Y and it is not a retract of Z. Since
there are no saturated solutions contained in W, Corollary 2.2 implies that the problem
−αx(a) + βy(a) = 0,
γ x(b) + δy(b) = 0
has a solution. Thus all the problems (8.11), (8.12), and (8.13) have solutions. In the case
(3.20) does not satisfy the uniqueness property, an approximating approach similar to the
one described in the proof of Theorem 3.1 leads to the conclusion.
□
8.3. Detection of chaotic dynamics
Isolating segments were applied in proofs of results concerning the existence of chaotic
dynamics generated by a time-periodic nonautonomous equation. Like in Section 7.5, we
assume w :R × M →T M is a time-dependent vector-ﬁeld on the right-hand side of Equa-
tion (3.8) satisfying the uniqueness property. We assume, moreover, that t →w(t,x) is
T -periodic for all x ∈M. Recall that in this case ﬁxed points of the Poincaré map Φ0,T are
the initial points of T -periodic solutions and
Φ0,nT = Φn
0,T
by (7.5). The concept of chaotic dynamics of (3.8) refers to a chaotic behavior of the
Poincaré map in the following sense. For a positive integer r put
Σr := {1,...,r}Z,
i.e., the set of bi-inﬁnite sequences of r symbols, and let the shift map be given by
σ :Σr ∋(...,s−1.s0,s1,...) →(...,s0.s1,s2,...) ∈Σr.
DEFINITION 8.1. Equation (3.8) is called Σr-chaotic provided there is a compact set
I ⊂M, invariant with respect to Φ0,T , and a map g :I →Σr such that:

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
665
(a) g is continuous and surjective,
(b) σ ◦g = g ◦Φ0,T ,
(c) for every n-periodic sequence s ∈Σr its inverse image g−1(s) contains at least one
n-periodic point of Φ0,T .
It follows by (c) that a Σr-chaotic equation has periodic solutions with minimal periods
nT for every n ∈N.
THEOREM 8.3 (compare Theorem 2 in [79]). Assume that compact ENRs W and Z are
periodic isolating segments over [0,T ] for Equation (3.8), and
(a) (W0,W −−
0
) = (Z0,Z−−
0
),
(b) Z ⊂W,
(c) μZ = μW ◦μW = idH(W0,W −−
0
),
(d) ΛW ̸= χ(Z0) −χ(Z−−
0
) ̸= 0.
Then (3.8) is Σ2-chaotic.
PROOF. We present a sketch of the proof in [79]. Let
σ := σ +
Z
be the escape-time function for Z. Deﬁne the set I as
I :=
∞

n=−∞

x ∈W0: Φ0,nT +t(x) ∈Wt ∀t ∈[0,T ]

.
It follows by (a) that σ(0,x) is deﬁned for every x ∈W0. If x ∈I then either σ(0,x) < T
or σ(0,x) = T and Φ0,T ∈W0 \ W −−
0
. Indeed, assume on the contrary that σ(0,x) = T
and Φ0,T ∈W −−
0
. Thus Φ0,T +ε /∈Wε for a small ε > 0 by (7.5), which contradicts to the
deﬁnition of I. Deﬁne
JZ :=

x ∈I: σ(0,x) = T, Φ0,T ∈W0 \ W −−
0

,
JW :=

x ∈I: σ(0,x) < T

.
It follows by the continuity of σ that JZ and JW are compact disjoint sets and
I = JZ ∪JW .
We use the letters Z and W also as the two symbols in the deﬁnition of Σ2, i.e., we put
Σ2 := {Z,W}Z.
To a point x ∈I we attach a symbol p(x) ∈{Z,W} by the rule p(x) = Z if x ∈JZ and
p(x) = W if x ∈JW . Deﬁne

Since JZ and JW are disjoint, g is continuous. Since periodic sequences are dense in Σ2,
in order to prove the theorem it sufﬁces to show that the inverse image of each n-periodic
sequence in Σ2 contains an n-periodic point of Φ0,T . To a sequence
(V0,...,Vn−1) ∈{Z,W}{0,...,n−1}
we attach a periodic isolating segment V0 ···Vn−1 over [0,nT ] and a set JV0···Vn−1 (extend-
ing the notation JZ and JW ) deﬁned by
V0 ···Vn−1 :=

(kT + t,x): k ∈{0,...,n −1}, t ∈[0,T ], x ∈Vk

,
JV0···Vn−1 :=

x ∈I: Φk
0,T (x) ∈JVk ∀k ∈{0,...,n −1}

.
The sets JV0···Vn−1 over all n-element sequences from {Z,W}{0,...,n−1} form a compact and
disjoint covering of I. In order to prove the theorem it sufﬁces to prove that for every n
each set JV0···Vn−1 contains a ﬁxed point of Φ0,nT . Indeed, the image of that point under
the map g is the n-periodic sequence
(...,Vn−1.V0,...,Vn−1,V0,...) ∈Σ2.
Recall, that the set KW n, where W n := W ···W (n times), consists of all ﬁxed points of
Φ0,nT contained in I (see Theorem 7.7). Since KW n ∩JV0···Vn−1 is compact and open in
the set of all ﬁxed points of Φ0,nT , its ﬁxed point index is deﬁned, and, by (d), in order to
prove the theorem it sufﬁces to show that if W appears in the sequence (V0,...,Vn−1) ∈
{Z,W}{0,...,n−1} exactly k times then
ind(Φ0,nT ,KW n ∩JV0···Vn−1) =

That equation is a consequence of Theorem 7.7 and some combinatorial calculations; we

EXAMPLE 8.1 (compare [79]). The planar equation
˙z =

1 + eiφt|z|2
¯z
(8.15)
is Σ2-chaotic if 0 < φ ⩽0.495. The proof in [79] is based on the existence of two isolat-
ing segments W and Z over [0,2π/φ] for (8.15) which are similar to the ones shown in
Figure 9 (with W at the top and Z at the bottom). It follows by the ﬁgure that ΛW = 1,
χ(W0) = 1, χ(W −−
0
) = 2, hence Theorem 8.3 implies the result.
In [79], the parameter values 0 < φ ⩽1/288 were considered only. The extension to the
other values was given in [95]. Actually, in [95] it was proved that (8.15) is Σ3-chaotic
in the considered range of φ. The equation was further investigated in [94,96], where the

existence of inﬁnitely many distinct homoclinic solutions to the zero one was proved. Gen-
eralizations of Theorem 8.3 and extensions of results on (8.15) to more general classes of
equations were given, among others, in [91–93,97]. Another approach to chaotic dynam-
ics based on the existence of suitably located isolating blocks or segments is presented in
[29,75].
9. Conley index
Using the notion of isolating block we present the deﬁnition of the Conley index and pro-
vide its basic properties. In particular, we indicate its relation to the Wa˙zewski method. We
do not present more advanced topics of the theory of the index; for them we refer to [50].
9.1. Isolated invariant sets and the Conley index
Let X be a metrizable locally compact space and let φ be a local ﬂow on X.
DEFINITION 9.1. A compact set S ⊂X is called an isolated invariant set provided there
exists U, a neighborhood of S, such that S = Inv(U). Such an U is called an isolating
neighborhood for S.
EXAMPLE 9.1. Let A be a real n × n-matrix, let U be an open neighborhood of 0 in Rn,
and let f :U →Rn be a C1-class function. Denote by φ the local ﬂow on U generated by
the equation
˙x = Ax + f (x).
Assume that
f (x) = o

|x|

as x →0

668
R. Srzednicki
and there are no purely imaginary eigenvalues of A. Then the one-point set {0} is an iso-
lated invariant set for φ. Indeed, by the Grobman–Hartman theorem φ is conjugated in a
neighborhood of 0 to the ﬂow generated by the linear vector-ﬁeld x 
→Ax which does not
have any bounded solutions except of the trivial one.
In an obvious way Example 9.1 generalizes to a stationary point of the local ﬂow gener-
ated by a C1-class vector-ﬁeld v :M →T M on a Riemannian manifold M.
DEFINITION 9.2. A stationary point x0 ∈M is called hyperbolic of index k if the dif-
ferential dx0v does not have eigenvalues on the imaginary axis and there are exactly k
eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities) with the positive real part.
It follows that if x0 is a hyperbolic point then {x0} is an isolated invariant set.
EXAMPLE 9.2. Assume that φ is a gradient-like local ﬂow (see Section 6.2). It is not
difﬁcult to observe that if x0 is a stationary point and there is a compact neighborhood
U of x0 such that there are no other stationary points in U then the one-point set {x0}
is an isolated invariant set and U is its isolating neighborhood. It follows that isolated
critical points of a smooth functional g :M →R are isolated invariant sets of the local
ﬂow generated by (6.1).
If B is an isolating block then it is an isolating neighborhood for S = Inv(B). In this
case we say that B is an isolating block for S. We recall in a more comprehensive version
the ﬁrst one of the two main theorems stated in Section 1.3:
THEOREM 9.1 (First Conley Theorem). If U is a neighborhood of an isolated invariant set
S then there exists an isolating block B for S such that B ⊂U. Moreover, if φ is smooth
(i.e., of C∞-class) local ﬂow on a smooth manifold then B can be chosen as a smooth
submanifold with corners such that B−and B+ are smooth submanifolds with boundary.
PROOF. We provide the idea of the proof given in the paper [90] in the smooth case. Let
U be an open isolating neighborhood of S. It is proved in [90] that there exist continuous
functions ℓ,m:U →[0,∞) such that
Inv−(U) = ℓ−1(0),
Inv+(U) = m−1(0),
ℓis of C∞-class outside of Inv−(U) and m is of C∞-class outside of Inv+(U), and

Let V be a compact neighborhood of S contained in U. It follows by the compactness of V ,

and, moreover, there exist an ε0 > 0 such that if 0 < ε ⩽ε0 and 0 < δ ⩽ε0 then
V(ε,δ) := V ∩ℓ−1
[0,ε]

∩m−1
[0,δ]

is a compact neighborhood of S. By the Sard theorem, choose (ε,δ) ∈(0,ε0)2 which is a
regular value of the map (ℓ,m):V →R2. For that value, intV(ε,δ) is a regular polyfacial
set determined by {ℓ−ε,m −δ}, hence, by Remark 3.1, the set V(ε,δ) is an isolating block
satisfying the required properties. For a proof in the purely topological case we refer to
[18] or [70, Chapter 22].
□
REMARK 9.1. In the smooth case it was additionally proved that intB is a regular polyfa-
cial set, hence if v is the vector ﬁeld generating φ and w is a vector ﬁeld sufﬁciently close
to v on B then B is also an isolating block for the local ﬂow generated by w.
REMARK 9.2. If the phase space of φ is a 2-dimensional manifold then it follows by the
construction provided in the proof of [72, Theorem 3.3] that there exists an isolating block
B for S such that B is a topological manifold with boundary and B−is its submanifold
with boundary.
Now our aim is to prove the Second Conley Theorem which we recall below. It is pre-
ceded by a lemma which will be used in the proof. (Recall that the concept of B-invariant
subset of B is given in Deﬁnition 7.2).

Inv(B) then

Z/Z−,∗


B/B−,∗

.
PROOF. By the continuity of φ, it is easy to prove that Z is a neighborhood of A, hence
Lemma 7.1(i) implies that Bn ⊂Z for some n ∈N. Since the inclusion induces a homeo-
morphism of the compact spaces Z/Z−and Z ∪B−/B−, it follows by (ii) in that lemma,

PROOF. As in Section 7, we denote by A, σ ±, etc. the sets and functions corresponding
to the block B. The analogous sets and functions for 
B we denote by 
A, ˜σ ±, etc. Without
loss of generality we assume
B ⊂
B.

670
R. Srzednicki
(In the other case one can ﬁnd an isolating block for S contained in the intersection of
the blocks B and 
B by Theorem 9.1, and then compare [B/B−,∗] and [
B/
B−,∗] to the
homotopy type corresponding to that block.) The proof will be performed in a few steps.
Below we use the following notation for intervals: if a ∈R then [a,a] is the one point set
{a} and (a,a) is equal to ∅.
Step 1. For every n ∈N,

B/B−,∗

=

Bn/B−
n ,∗

.
(Recall that Bn is deﬁned in Section 7.2.) It immediately follows by Lemmas 7.1(i) and 9.1.
Step 2. There exists n ∈N, n ⩾1, such that
φ

x,

0, ˜σ +(x)

∩Bn = ∅,
if x ∈B−
n ,
φ

x,

−˜σ −(x),0

∩Bn = ∅,
if x ∈B+
n .
By the symmetry of notation, we need to justify the ﬁrst condition only. Assume on the
contrary that for every n there exists xn ∈B−
n and 0 < tn < ˜σ +(xn) such that φ(xn,tn) ∈
B+
n . We can assume that xn →x0 and tn →t0 as n →∞. A± = 5
n B±
n by Lemma 7.1,
hence we have
x0 ∈A−⊂Inv−(B) ⊂Inv−(
B).
If t0 = ∞then x0 ∈Inv+(
B) and thus x ∈S which is impossible. If t0 < ∞then φ(x0,t0) ∈
A+, hence again x ∈S and the assertion is proved.
Step 3. Since now we assume that n satisﬁes the conclusion of Step 2. Then ˜σ ±(x) < ∞
for every x ∈B±
n . Indeed, in the other case the positive or negative limit set of x is con-
tained in 
B and contains points outside of the interior of B, which is impossible.
Step 4. By Step 3, we can deﬁne compact sets
M :=

x∈B+
n
φx,−˜σ −(x),0,
N :=

x∈B−
n
φx,0, ˜σ +(x).
It follows by Step 2 that M ∩Bn = B+
n and N ∩Bn = B−
n . Moreover, by Lemma 9.1,

B/
B−,∗

=

Bn ∪M ∪N/N−,∗

.
Step 5.
Bn ∪M ∪N/N−,∗ = Bn ∪N/N−,∗.
This is obvious since B+
n is a strong deformation retract of M.
Step 6. Finally,

Bn ∪N/N−,∗


Bn/B−


.

In order to prove that assertion recall that n ⩾1 and observe that

Since the second compounds are homeomorphic each to the other such that the set
φ−1(B−
n ) remains intact and B−
n is transformed to N−, there exists a homeomorphism

Bn,B−
n

→

Bn ∪N,N−
and the assertion follows. We get the conclusion of the theorem by combining the equations
in Steps 1, 4, 5, and 6.
□
As it was pointed out in Section 1.3, Theorems 9.1 and 9.2 lead to Deﬁnition 1.3 of the
Conley index:
h(φ,S) :=

B/B−,∗

for an arbitrary isolating block B for S. Actually, in order to deﬁne the Conley index, a
more general notion of index pair (see [50, Deﬁnition 3.4]) can be used.
9.2. Properties of the Conley index
At ﬁrst we provide the deﬁnition of the continuation (i.e., homotopy) relation between
isolated invariant sets. Assume that φ and ψ are local ﬂows on a metrizable locally compact
space X and let S and T be isolated invariant sets for φ and, respectively, ψ.
DEFINITION 9.3. We say that pairs (φ,S) and (ψ,T ) are related by continuation (denoted
(φ,S) ≃(ψ,T )) if there exists a local ﬂow Φ on X × [0,1], an isolated invariant set S∗
for Φ, and local ﬂows φσ on X, σ ∈[0,1], such that Φt(x,σ) = (φσ
t (x),σ), φ0 = φ,
φ1 = ψ, S = {x: (x,0) ∈S∗}, and T = {x: (x,1) ∈S∗}.
The relation of continuity between isolated invariant sets provides no information on
their topology. In particular, a nonempty set can be continued to the empty one, and a
connected set can split by continuation into a nonconnected one as we see in the following
examples.
EXAMPLE 9.3. Take a family of local ﬂows φλ generated by
˙x = x2 + λ
on the real line. It follows that
φ0,{0} ≃φ1,∅.

EXAMPLE 9.4. Let p and q be two stationary hyperbolic points of local ﬂows φ and ψ
in the plane as shown on Figure 10, where the left and right drawing represent the phase
portrait of φ and, respectively, of ψ. Let the isolated invariant set for φ is equal to the
set consisting of p, q, and the whole trajectory J connecting p and q (i.e., J = φ(y),
α(y) = q, and ω(y) = p). The ﬂow ψ is obtained from φ by a perturbation which splits J
into two disjoint unbounded trajectories. Since that perturbation can by arbitrarily small,
φ,{p,q} ∪J ≃ψ,{p,q}.
In the sequel we need also the notion of the product φ × ψ, where ψ is a local ﬂow on
X and ψ is a local ﬂow on Y. It is given by
(φ × ψ)t(x,y) :=

φt(x),ψt(y)

.
In the smooth case it corresponds to the Cartesian product of the generating vector-ﬁelds.
The following theorem provides the main properties of the Conley index. They are coun-
terparts of the properties (i)–(iv) of the ﬁxed point index given in Proposition 5.7.
THEOREM 9.3.
(i) (Wa˙zewski Property) If h(φ,S) ̸= 0 then S ̸= ∅.
(ii) (Additivity) If S and T are isolated invariant sets of φ and S ∩T = ∅then
h(φ,S ∪T ) = h(φ,S) ∨h(φ,T ).
(iii) (Multiplicativity) If φ is a local ﬂow on X and ψ is a local ﬂow on Y, S and T are
isolated invariant sets of φ and ψ, respectively, then
h(φ × ψ,S × T ) = h(φ,S) ∧(ψ,T ).
(iv) (Continuation Property) If (φ,S) ≃(ψ,T ) then h(φ,S) = h(ψ,T ).

PROOF. Ad (i). This is an immediate consequence of Corollary 2.5 and Lemma 5.1.
Ad (ii). If B and 
B are isolating blocks for S and T , respectively, and B ∩
B = ∅then
B ∪
B is also an isolating block for φ and the result follows by the deﬁnition of the index.
Ad (iii). For B and 
B as above the set B × 
B is an isolating block for S × T , hence the
result follows.
Ad (iv). If the local ﬂow φ is smooth, the result is a consequence of Remark 9.1, since in
this case h(φ,S) is locally constant with respect to the change of the vector-ﬁeld generating
φ. For a proof in the general case we refer to [70, Chapter 23].
□
Theorem 9.3(i) is a version of the Wa˙zewski theorem. It is weaker then Corollary 2.5 as
it can be shown in the following example:
EXAMPLE 9.5 (compare II.2 in [21]). Let B ⊂R3 be given by
B := D2 × [0,1] \ P,
where D2 denotes the disk {x ∈R2: |x| ⩽1} and P is a knotted thin open pipe P as shown
in Figure 11, i.e., P ⊂D2 × [0,1] and there exists a homeomorphism
h:U × [0,1] →P,
where U is equal to {x ∈R2: |x| < r} for some 0 < r < 1, such that
h

U × {0}

= U × {0},
h

U × {1}

= U × {1}.
Assume that B is an isolating block for a local ﬂow φ in R3 such that the bottom of B
is equal to B−. The exit set B−is not a strong deformation retract of B since they have
different fundamental groups, hence Corollary 2.5 implies that
S := Inv(B) ̸= ∅.

674
R. Srzednicki
On the other hand, h(φ,S) = [B/B−,∗] is the trivial pointed homotopy type and therefore
it does not provide any information on S. Indeed, since B is compact, the inclusion B &→
B ∪(D2 × {0}) induces a homeomorphism
B/B−→B ∪

D2 × {0}

/

D2 × {0}

.
The set ∂U × [0,1] ∪U × {0} is a strong deformation retract of U × [0,1], hence B ∪
(D2 × {0}) is a strong deformation retract of D2 × [0,1]. Lemma 5.1 implies

In applications of the Conley index it is convenient to consider its various reductions, for
example H(h(φ,S)) and χ(h(φ,S)) for an arbitrary homology or cohomology functor H
and the corresponding Euler characteristic, the category cat(h(φ,S)), and the cup-length
ℓ(h(φ,S)). In particular, by Remark 5.1,
ˇH ∗
h(φ,S)

= ˇH ∗
B,B−
for arbitrary isolating block B for S. (In fact, that equation holds for every homology or
cohomology functor H , compare [68, Section 1.10]; H(h(φ,S)) is called the homological
or, respectively, the cohomological Conley index and usually is denoted by CH(φ,S).) In
the following result we gather information on the isolated invariant set provided by the
above mentioned reductions of the Conley index.
THEOREM 9.4. Let S be an isolated invariant set for a local ﬂow φ. Then
(i) ℓ(S) ⩾ℓ(h(φ,S)).
(ii) If φ is smooth then cat(S) ⩾cat(h(φ,S)).
(iii) If the phase space of φ is a 2-dimensional manifold then either S has inﬁnitely
many components or ˇχ(S) ⩾χ(h(φ,S)).
(iv) If φ is smooth and gradient-like then #S0 ⩾cat(h(φ,S)), where S0 denotes the set
of stationary points contained in S.
(v) If φ is smooth and T > 0 then ind(φT ,ST ) = χ(h(φ,S)), where ST denotes the set
of T -periodic points contained in S.
(vi) If φ is smooth then i(φ,U) = χ(h(φ,S)) for every open isolating neighborhood U
of S.
PROOF. At ﬁrst note that the smoothness of φ implies the existence of an isolating block
B for S such that B and B−are ENRs by Theorem 9.1.
Ad (i). It follows by Proposition 5.3 and Corollary 7.2.
Ad (ii). It follows by Proposition 5.2 and Theorem 7.1.
Ad (iii). The result is a consequence of Proposition 5.5, (7.2) in Example 7.2, and Re-
mark 9.2.
Ad (iv). It follows by Theorem 7.5.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
675
Ad (v) and (vi). These are consequences of Proposition 5.5 and Theorem 7.6.
□
Obviously, the absolute homotopy type of B/B−also does not depend on isolating block
B for S, hence we can deﬁne a less accurate invariant then the Conley index h by
h′(φ,S) :=

B/B−
It has similar properties as h. Moreover, by Propositions 5.2, 5.3, and 5.5 we get
ℓh(φ,S) ⩾ℓh′(φ,S) −1
and, in the case of smooth φ,
cat

h(φ,S)

⩾cat

h′(φ,S)

−1,
χh(φ,S) = χh′(φ,S) −1,
hence the corresponding results to those in Theorem 9.4 hold for h′.
9.3. Examples of Conley indices and an application
In the following results we use the homotopy types
Σk := Sk,s0
,
Πk :=

RP k,p0

,
where Sk and RP k denote the k-dimensional sphere and real projective space, respectively,
and s0 and p0 are their arbitrary points. Σ0 is sometimes denoted by 1 since it is the neutral
element for the smash product.
Assume that φ is a smooth ﬂow on a Riemannian manifold. At ﬁrst we calculate the
index of a hyperbolic point (see Deﬁnition 9.2).
PROPOSITION 9.1. Assume that x0 is hyperbolic of index k. Then
h

φ,{x0}

= Σk.
(9.1)
PROOF. By the Grobman–Hartman theorem, φ is conjugated in a neighborhood of x0 to
the linear ﬂow ψ of the equation
˙x = Ax
in Rn, where A = (aij) is diagonal, aii = 1 for i = 1,...,k and aii = −1 for i = k +
1,...,n. Thus isolating blocks for φ in a neighborhood of x0 and for ψ in a neighborhood
of 0 are homeomorphic, hence it sufﬁces to calculate h(ψ,{0}).
B = Dk × Dn−k

676
R. Srzednicki
is an isolating block for {0} with respect to ψ and
B−= Sk−1 × Dn−k,
hence B/B−has the same homotopy type as Sk and the result follows.
□
EXAMPLE 9.6. Let g :M →R be a Morse function on an n-dimensional Riemannian
manifold M. By deﬁnition, it means that each its critical point x0 is nondegenerate, hence,
by the Morse lemma, there exists a chart f :U →Rn in a neighborhood of x0 such that
f (x0) = 0 and
g

f −1(v)

= g(x0) −
k

i=1
v2
i +
n

i=k+1
v2
i
(9.2)
for v = (v1,...,vn) ∈f (U). The number k is independent of the choice of the chart and
is called the Morse index of x0. It follows by (9.2) that x0 is a hyperbolic point of index k
of the local ﬂow φ generated by (6.1), hence (9.1) holds.
By the example, the Conley index is a direct generalization of the Morse index (up to
the correspondence k vs. Σk): it also applies to degenerate isolated critical points of a
functional, since they are isolated invariant sets as we have mentioned in Example 9.2. In
spite of the fact that functionals used in variational methods operate in inﬁnite-dimensional
spaces, hence not locally compact ones, the Conley index ﬁnds its application there thanks
to the saddle-point reduction method from [2] (compare also Remark 7.2).
Let Γ be a nontrivial periodic orbit of φ, i.e., the trajectory φ(x) of a periodic, non-
stationary point x. It is called hyperbolic of index k if dxP , the differential at x of the
Poincaré map P associated to a section of Γ in a neighborhood of x does not have eigen-
values on the unit circle and there are exactly k eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities)
outside of the unit disc. Then the unstable manifold W u(Γ ) of Γ is of dimension k + 1
and we call Γ untwisted (respectively, twisted) provided W u(Γ ) is orientable (respectively,
nonorientable).
PROPOSITION 9.2. Assume that Γ is hyperbolic of index k. Then Γ is an isolated invari-
ant set and
(i) if k = 0 then h(φ,Γ ) = [S1/∅,∗],
(ii) if k ⩾1 and Γ is untwisted then h(φ,Γ ) = Σk ∨Σk+1,
(iii) if k ⩾1 and Γ is twisted then h(φ,Γ ) = Π2 ∧Σk−1.
PROOF. We present a sketch of a proof. In the untwisted case one can ﬁnd an isolating
block B for Γ which is homeomorphic to S1 × Dk × Dn−k−1 such that its exit set B−
corresponds to S1 × Sk−1 × Dn−k−1. In the case k = 0 the result follows directly. Assume
that k ⩾1. It follows that (B/B−,∗) has the homotopy type of (S1 × Sk/(S1 × {s0},∗),
i.e., [S1/∅,∗] ∧Σk. By the geometric considerations which are shown on Figure 12 in
the case k = 1, that homotopy type appears to be equal to Σk ∨Σk+1. In drawing 1 on

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
677
Fig. 12.
the ﬁgure, there is the Cartesian product S1 × S1 having marked the circle S1 × {s0}. By
collapsing the circle to a point one gets what is seen in drawing 2. The resulting quotient
space is homeomorphic to the union of the two-dimensional sphere S2 with the bar joining
its poles divided by the bar. This is marked in drawing 3. In drawing 4, there is a pointed
space with the same homotopy type, but here the bar is not collapsed and the south pole
is the base point. Without changing the pointed homotopy type, the bar is deformed to the
circle inside the sphere in drawing 5. In order to better see that this is in fact the pointed
wedge sum S1 ∨S2, the homeomorphic space with the circle attached outside of the sphere
is shown in drawing 6. That argument generalizes to the higher values of k.
If Γ is twisted then B is homeomorphic to M × Dk−1 × Dn−k−1 such that B−corre-
sponds to ∂M × Sk−2 × Dn−k−1, where M is the compact Möbius band and ∂M denotes
its geometric boundary. Thus [B/B−,∗] is equal to Π2 ∧Σk−1.
□
Recall that in Example 5.1 we have shown that Σ0 ∨Σ1 is not the same as [S1/∅,∗],
hence (i) in Proposition 9.2 is not of the form (ii) for k = 0. Since the Conley index of
an attracting hyperbolic orbit Γ is equal to [S1/∅,∗] by (i), and the Conley index of an
isolated invariant set S consisting of two hyperbolicpoints of index 0 and index 1 is equal to
Σ0 ∨Σ1 by Theorem 9.3(ii)), it follows by (iv) of that theorem that there is no continuation
between (φ,Γ ) and (ψ,S) for any two local ﬂows φ and ψ. Notice that we essentially used
the Conley index h in order to prove that assertion. Its reduction to h′ is useless since both
the absolute homotopy types h′(φ,Γ ) and h′(ψ,S) are equal to [S1/∅]. Moreover, for
every homology or cohomology functor H with coefﬁcients in R,
Hq

h(φ,Γ )
 ∼= Hq

h(ψ,S)
 ∼=
R,
if q = 0 or q = 1,
0,
if q ̸= 0,1.
Surprisingly, the corresponding result in the case of nonattracting hyperbolic periodic or-
bits is not true. We provide an example of a hyperbolic periodic orbit of index 1 which
continues to the set consisting of two hyperbolic stationary points of index 1 and 2.

EXAMPLE 9.7. We consider a family of local ﬂows φλ in R3, where λ ∈[0,1]. For λ ∈
[0,2/3] let φλ be generated by the equation
˙θ = 1,
˙r = f (r,z,λ),
˙z = g(r,z,λ)
in the cylindrical coordinates θ,r,z, where θ ∈[0,2π), r ⩾0, and z ∈R. Assume that
the vector-ﬁeld (f,g) in [0,∞) × R has the phase portrait given in Figure 13 (where r is
the horizontal coordinate and z is the vertical one) for the parameter values λ = 0 (left),
λ = 1/3 (middle), and λ = 2/3 (right). Assume that 1/3 is the only parameter value of
λ ∈[0,2/3] in which the phase portrait changes, which implies that the right drawing
represents also phase portraits at λ ∈[0,1/3) and the right one at λ ∈(1/3,2/3]. It follows
that for λ ∈[0,1/3) there is a periodic hyperbolic orbit Sλ of index 1 represented by the
dot in the left drawing. It collapses at λ = 1/3 to the one-point set S1/3 consisting of the
stationary point on the line r = 0 which is seen in the middle drawing. For λ ∈(1/3,2/3],
that point bifurcates into the isolated invariant set Sλ consisting of two hyperbolic points
of index 1 (the lower point) and of index 2 (the upper point) and the trajectory connecting
them. For the parameter values λ ∈(2/3,1] we no longer assume any rotating and we split
the connecting trajectory into two unbounded ones in a similar way as it was done for the
planar system in Example 9.4 and shown on Figure 10. Thus Sλ for λ ∈(2/3,1] consists
of two hyperbolic points of index 1 and 2 and
φ0,S0
 ≃φ1,S1
.
As an example of application of various properties of the Conley index we present a
proof of a result on existence of a bounded solution.
PROPOSITION 9.3 (see I.5 in [21]). The scalar equation
x(n) = x2 −1
(9.3)
has a nonconstant solution x such that x,x′,...,x(n−1) are bounded.

Wa˙zewski method and Conley index
679
PROOF. We rewrite the proof in [21]—it is also reproduced in [70], where we refer for
more detailed calculations. By the change of variables τ = t/ε and z = εnx Equation (9.3)
is equivalent to
dnz
dτ n = z2 −ε2n,
hence to the system
z′
i = zi+1,
if i = 1,...,n −1,
z′
n = z2
1 −ε2n.
(9.4)
In particular, for ε = 0, (9.4) becomes
z′
i = zi+1,
if i = 1,...,n −1,
z′
n = z2
1
(9.5)
and we assert that the constant solution 0 is the only bounded solution of (9.5). In order
to prove that assertion assume that z = (z1,...,zn) is a bounded solution. Since z′
n(t) ⩾0,
the map zn is constant or increasing. In both cases there exist α−,α+ ∈R such that
lim
t→±∞zn(t) = α±.
Let α+ ̸= 0. Then z′
n−1(t) is close to α+ for t near ∞, hence zn−1 is unbounded which
contradicts to the assumption. The same holds if α−̸= 0, hence α−= α+ = 0 and zn is
the constant zero function. It follows that zn−1 is a constant function and by a similar
argument one concludes that the constant is equal to 0. By repeating that argument we
conclude zn(t) = ··· = z1(t) = 0 for every t. Let φε be the local ﬂow generated by (9.4) if
ε ⩾0 and by
z′
i = zi+1,
if i = 1,...,n −1,
z′
n = z2
1 + ε2n
if ε ⩽0. We have just proved that {0} is an isolated invariant set of φ0. Take an arbitrary
isolating block B for {0} such that conclusion of Remark 9.1 is satisﬁed, hence B is also
an isolating block for local ﬂows φε, where |ε| ⩽ε0 for some ε0 > 0. For such an ε deﬁne
the isolated invariant set Sε as the invariant part of B with respect to the local ﬂow φε. It
is easy to see that if ε < 0 then there are no bounded trajectories for φε, hence Sε = ∅. By
Theorem 9.3(i) and (iv),
h

φε,Sε

= 0
(9.6)
if |ε| < ε0. Assume now that ε > 0. There are two stationary points p+ and p−,
p± =

±εn,0,...,0

,
and the eigenvalues of the derivative of the vector-ﬁeld generating φε at p± satisfy the
characteristic equation
λn = ±2ε.

680
R. Srzednicki
Assume on the contrary that p± are the only bounded trajectories, hence Sε is equal to the
union {p−,p+} and Theorem 9.3(ii) implies

(9.7)
If n is odd then there are no eigenvalues on imaginary axis for both p+ and p−, and if n is
even then the same holds for one of p±. Thus, by Proposition 9.1, at least one summand on
the right-hand side of (9.7) is not equal to 0 which contradicts to (9.6) by Remark 5.2.
□
9.4. Concluding remarks
We provided only basic facts concerning the Conley index; a more comprehensive intro-
ductions to that notion are given in [21] and [70, Chapters 22 and 23]. For some more
advanced topics we refer to [50], where the index or its generalizations are deﬁned both for
continuous and discrete-time ﬂows, and results related to attractor–repealer pairs, Morse
decompositions, connection and transition matrices, singular isolating neighborhoods, and
computer assisted proofs are considered. Finally, we would like to mention some exten-
sions and modiﬁcations of the Conley index for the continuous-time local ﬂows:
• An improvement due to Conley in which the index is a connected simple system gen-
erated by all blocks (and more generally, by all index pairs) for an isolated invariant
set S and connecting maps are naturally given by pushing along trajectories (compare
[21]).
• A structure of the module over ˇH ∗(X) for the cohomological Conley index, where X
is the phase space, and its generalization to the equivariant case due to Floer in [30].
• An inﬁnite-dimensional version given in [68], which applies to semilinear partial dif-
ferential equations with the linear parts generated by sectorial operators having com-
pact resolvents.
• Another inﬁnite-dimensional version deﬁned in [36] for ﬂows generated by vector-
ﬁelds of the form L + K in a Hilbert space, where L is a bounded linear Fredholm
operator and K is a completely continuous nonlinear operator. It particularly well ﬁts
to results on the existence of critical points in variational problems.
• Multivalued versions given in [51] and, in a simpler case of equations without unique-
ness, in [44].
• The index over a base space deﬁned in [52] which provides a better recognition of
isolated invariant sets then the index h in the case of noncontractible phase space. In
particular, it is nontrivial for the invariant part of the block considered in Example 9.5
if the knotted orbit is removed from the phase space.
