Preface
PREFACE
The present monograph deals with some topical problems of stability
theory of nonlinear large-scale systems. The purpose of this book is to de-
scribe some new applications of Liapunov matrix-valued functions method
to the theory of stability of evolution problems governed by nonlinear equa-
tions with structural perturbations.
The concept of structural perturbations has extended the possibilities
of engineering simulation of the classes of real world phenomena. We have
written this book for the broadest audience of potentially interested learn-
ers: applied mathematicians, applied physicists, control and electrical en-
gineers, commmunication network specialists, performance analysts, oper-
ations researchers, etc., who deal with qualitative analysis of ordinary dif-
ferential equations, diﬀerence equations, impulsive equations, and singular
perturbed equations.
To accomplish our aims, we have thought it necessary to make the anal-
ysis:
(i) general enough to apply to the many variety of applications which
arise in science and engineering, and
(ii) simple enough so that it can be understood by persons whose math-
ematical training does not extend beyond the classical methods of stability
theories which were popular at the end of the twentieth century.
Of course, we understood that it is not possible to achive generality and
simplicity in a perfect union but, in fact, the new generalization of direct
Liapunov’s method give us new possibilities in the direction.
In this monograph the concept of structural perturbations is developed
in the framework of four classes of systems of nonlinear equations mentioned
above. The direct Liapunov method being one of the main methods of qual-
itative analysis of solutions to nonlinear systems is used in this monograph
in the direction of its generalization in terms of matrix-valued auxiliary
functions.
Thus, the concept of structural perturbations combined with the method
of Liapunov matrix-valued functions is a methodological base for the new
direction of investigations in nonlinear systems dynamics.
The monograph is arranged as follows.
Chapter 1 provides an overview of recent results for four classes of sys-
tems of equations (continuous, discrete-time, impulsive, and singular per-
turbed systems), which are a necessary introduction to the qualitative the-
ory of the same classes of systems of equations but under structural per-
turbations.
Chapters 2 – 5 expose the mathematical stability theory of equations un-
der structural perturbations. The suﬃcient existence conditions for various
dynamical properties of solutions to the classes of systems of equations
under consideration are obtained in terms of the matrix-valued Liapunov
functions and are easily available for practical applications. All main re-
sults are illustrated by many examples from mechanics, power engineering
and automatical control theory.

Preface
Final Sections of Chapters 2 – 5 deal with the discussion of some direc-
tions of further generalization of obtained results and their applications.
To this end new problems of nonlinear dynamics and system theory are
involved.
Some of the important features of the monograph are as follows. This is
the ﬁrst book that
(i) treats the stability theory of large scale dynamical systems via
matrix-valued Lyapunov functions;
(ii) demonstrates that developing of the direct Lyapunov method for
time-continuous, discrete-time, impulsive and singularly perturbed
large scale systems via matrix auxiliary functions is a powerful tech-
nique for the qualitative study of large scale systems;
(iii) presents suﬃcient stability conditions in terms of sign deﬁniteness
of special matrices;
(iv) shows that utilizing of the matrix-valued Lyapunov functions in
investigating the stability theory of large scale dynamical systems
is signiﬁcantly more useful.

GENERALITIES
1.1 Introduction
This Chapter contains description of some classes of large scale dynamical
systems and a concept of nonclassical structural perturbations. These types
of systems are investigated in Chapters 2 – 5 for the same classes of large
scale systems of equations which, however, contain nonclassical structural
perturbations.
The Chapter is arranged as follows.
Section 1.2 deals with description of stability problems for continuous,
discrete-time, impulsive and singularly perturbed large scale dynamical
systems. The deﬁnitions for various types of motion stability of nonau-
tonomous and nonlinear systems are presented.
Section 1.3 presents some approaches to qualitative analysis of nonlinear
systems under structural perturbations.
Section 1.4 exposes general concept of stability under nonclassical struc-
tural perturbations.
Section 1.5 sets out a version of generalization of the Liapunov direct
method via matrix-valued Liapunov functions as a main approach to sta-
bility analysis under nonclassical structural perturbations in the book.
Finaly, in Section 1.6 there are some comments to Chapter 1.
1.2 Some Types of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems
In this Section the notions of motion stability corresponding to the mo-
tion properties of nonautonomous systems are presented being necessary in
subsequent presentation. Basic notions of the method of matrix-valued Li-
apunov functions are discussed and general theorems and some corollaries
are set out.
Throughout this Section, real systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations
will be considered. Notations will be used.
1.2.1 Ordinary diﬀerential large-scale systems
We start with a
general description of a dynamic system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
(1.2.1)
dyi
dt = Yi(t, y1, . . . , yn),
i = 1, 2, . . ., n,
or in the equivalent vector form
(1.2.2)
dy
dt = Y (t, y),
where x ∈Rn, Y (t, y) = (Y1(t, y), . . . , Yn(t, y))T, Y : T × Rn →Rn.
We will assume that the right-hand part of (1.2.2) satisﬁes the solution
existence and uniqueness conditions of the Cauchy problem

Generalities
(1.2.3)
dy
dt = Y (t, y),
y(t0) = y0,
for any (t0, y0) ∈T × Ω, 0 ∈Ωand Ωis an open connected subset of Rn.
Let y(t) = ψ(t; t0, y0) be the solution of system (1.2.2), deﬁnite on the
interval [t0, τ) and noncontinuable behind the point τ, i.e.
y(t) is not
deﬁnite for t = τ, . Then
(1.2.4)
lim y(t) = +∞
as
t →τ −0.
Using solution y(t) and the right-hand part of system (1.2.2) we construct
the vector-function
(1.2.5)
f(t, x) = Y (t, x + ψ(t)) −Y (t, ψ(t))
and consider the system
(1.2.6)
dx
dt = f(t, x).
It is easy to verify that the solutions of systems (1.2.2) and (1.2.6) are
correlated as
x(t) = y(t) −ψ(t)
on the general interval of existence of solutions y(t) and ψ(t). It is clear that
system (1.2.6) has a trivial solution x(t) ≡0. This solution corresponds
to the solution y(t) = ψ(t) of system (1.2.2). Obviously, the reduction of
system (1.2.2) to system (1.2.6) is possible only when the solution y(t) =
ψ(t) is known.
Qualitative investigation of solutions of system (1.2.2) relatively solution
ψ(t) is reduced to the investigation of behavior of solution x(t) to system
(1.2.6) which diﬀers “little” from the trivial one for t = t0 .
In motion stability theory system (1.2.6) is called the system of perturbed
motion equations.
Since equations (1.2.6) can generally not be solved analytically in closed
from, the qualitative properties of the equilibrium state are of great prac-
tical interest. We start with a series of deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 The equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (1.2.6) is:
(i) stable iﬀfor every t0 ∈Ti and every ε > 0 there exists δ(t0, ε) > 0,
such that x0 < δ(t0, ε) implies
x(t; t0, x0) < ε
for all
t ∈T0;
(ii) uniformly stable iﬀboth (i) holds and for every ε > 0 the corre-
sponding maximal δM obeying (i) satisﬁes
inf [δM(t, ε): t ∈Ti] > 0;
(iii) stable in the whole iﬀboth (i) holds and
δM(t, ε) →+∞
as
ε →+∞
for all
t ∈R;
(iv) uniformly stable in the whole iﬀboth (ii) and (iii) hold;

(v) unstable iﬀthere are t0 ∈Ti, ε ∈(0, +∞) and τ ∈T0, τ > t0,
such that for every δ ∈(0, +∞) there is x0, x0 < δ, for which
x(τ; t0, x0) ≥ε.
Deﬁnition 1.2.2 The equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (1.2.6) is:
(i) attractive iﬀfor every t0 ∈Ti there exists ∆(t0) > 0 and for every
ζ > 0 there exists τ(t0; x0, ζ) ∈[0, +∞) such that x0 < ∆(t0)
implies x(t; t0, x0) < ζ for all t ∈(t0 + τ(t0; x0, ζ), +∞);
(ii) x0-uniformly attractive iﬀboth (i) is true and for every t0 ∈R there
exists ∆(t0) > 0 and for every ζ ∈(0, +∞) there exists τu[t0,
∆(t0), ζ] ∈[0, +∞) such that
sup [τm(t0; x0, ζ): x0 ∈B∆(t0)] = τu(t0, x0, ζ);
(iii) t0-uniformly attractive iﬀboth (i) is true, there is ∆> 0 and for
every (x0, ζ) ∈B∆× (0, +∞) there exists τu(R, x0, ζ) ∈[0, +∞)
such that
sup [τm(t0); x0, ζ): t0 ∈Ti] = τu(Ti, x0, ζ);
(iv) uniformly attractive iﬀboth (ii) and (iii) hold, that is, that (i)
is true, there exists ∆> 0 and for every ζ ∈(0, +∞) there is
τu(R, ∆, ζ) ∈[0, +∞) such that
sup [τm(t0; x0, ζ): (t0, x0) ∈Ti × B∆] = τ(Ti, ∆, ζ);
The properties (i) – (iv) hold “in the whole” iﬀ(i) is true for every
∆(t0) ∈(0, +∞) and every t0 ∈Ti.

Deﬁnition 1.2.3 The equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (1.2.6) is:
(i) asymptotically stable iﬀit is both stable and attractive;
(ii) equi-asymptotically stable iﬀit is both stable and x0-uniformly at-
tractive;
(iii) quasi-uniformly asymptotically stable iﬀit is both uniformly stable
and t0-uniformly attractive;
(iv) uniformly asymptotically stable iﬀit is both uniformly stable and
uniformly attractive;
(v) The properties (i) – (iv) hold “in the whole” iﬀboth the correspond-
ing stability of x = 0 and the corresponding attraction of x = 0
hold in the whole;
(vi) exponentially stable iﬀthere are ∆> 0 and real numbers α ≥1
and β > 0 such that x0 < ∆implies
x(t; t0, x0) ≤αx0 exp[−β(t −t0)],
for all
t ∈T0,
for all
t0 ∈Ti.
This holds in the whole iﬀit is true for ∆= +∞.
In the investigation of both system (1.2.2) and (1.2.11) the solution x(t)
is assumed to be deﬁnite for all t ∈T (for all t ∈T0).
Further, with reference to system (1.2.6) we introduce the notations
(1.2.7)
xT = (xT
1 , xT
2 , . . . , xT
m)T ∈Rn,
xs ∈Rns,
f T(t, x) = (f T
1 (t, x1), . . . , f T
m(t, xm))T,
gT(t, x) = (gT
1 (t, x), . . . , gT
m(t, x))T,
m

s=1
ns = n.
System (1.2.6) has the meaning of a large scale system, if for its dimen-
sions being large enough the decomposition to the form
(1.2.8)
dxs
dt = fs(t, xs) + gs(t, x1, . . . , xn),
s = 1, 2, . . ., m,
with the independent subsystems
(1.2.9)
dxs
dt = fs(t, xs),
s = 1, 2, . . . , m,
and interconnection functions
(1.2.10)
gs : gs(t, x1, . . . , xn),
s = 1, 2, . . . , m,
simpliﬁes the procedure of qualitative analysis of its solutions.
The decomposition is correct if systems (1.2.6) and (1.2.8) are equivalent
by their dynamical properties.
Since the decomposition of system (1.2.6) to (1.2.8) can be accomplished
in several ways, the dynamical properties of its independent subsystems
(1.2.9) may diﬀer. Besides, the interconnection functions (1.2.10) can in-
ﬂunce essentially the dynamical properties of subsystems (1.2.8).

Generalities
Note that if subsystems (1.2.9) possess strong stability, for example, the
zero solution of subsystems (1.2.9) is uniformly asymptotically stable or
exponentially stable, then for bounded at each instant of time intercon-
nection functions (1.2.10) the solution of system (1.2.7) possesses the same
type of stability even in the case of gs(t, x1, . . . , xn) not equal to zero for
x1 = x2 = · · · = xm = 0, though being small at each instant of time on
semiaxis.
1.2.2 Ordinary diﬀerence large-scale systems
Consider a system
with ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom described by the system of diﬀer-
ence equations in the form
(1.2.11)
x(τ + 1) = f(τ, x(τ)),
where τ ∈N +
τ
≜{τ0, . . . , τ0 + k, . . . }, τ0 ≥0, k = 1, 2, . . . , x ∈Rn,
f : N +
τ × Rn →Rn, f(τ, x) is continuous in x. Let solution x(τ; τ0, x0) of
system (1.2.11) be deﬁnite for all τ ∈N +
τ
and x(τ0; τ0, x0) = x0. Assume
that f(τ, x) = x for all τ ∈N +
τ
iﬀx = 0. Besides, system (1.2.11) admits
zero solution x = 0 and it corresponds to the unique equilibrium state of
system (1.2.11).
The deﬁnitions of the dynamical properties of solutions of system (1.2.11)
are obtained by replacing the independent variable t ∈R by τ ∈N +
τ
in
Deﬁnitions 1.2.1 – 1.2.3 and so are omitted.
Stability (instability) of the equilibrium state x = 0 of system (1.2.11)
is sometimes studied by means of reducing this system to the form
(1.2.12)
x(τ + 1) = Ax(τ) + g(τ, x(τ)),
where A is a constant n×n–matrix, g: N +
τ ×Rn →Rn is a vector-function
continuous in x and satisﬁes certain conditions of smallness.
In this case, under some additional restrictions on the properties of ma-
trix A, stability (instability) of the state x = 0 of system (1.2.12) can be
studied in terms of the ﬁrst order approximation equations.
Of essential interest is the case when the order of system (1.2.11) is rather
high, or when this system is a composition of more simple subsystems. In
this case the ﬁnite-dimensional system of equations of the type of
(1.2.13)
xi(τ + 1) = fi(τ, xi(τ)) + gi(τ, x1(τ), . . . , xm(τ)),
i = 1, 2, . . ., m,
is considered, where xi ∈Rni, fi : N +
τ × Rni, gi : N +
τ × Rn1 × · · · ×
Rnm →Rni.
Via designation (1.2.7) system (1.2.13) can be presented in the vector
form
(1.2.14)
x(τ + 1) = f(τ, x(τ)) + g(τ, x(τ)) ≜H(τ, x(τ)).
Formally system (1.2.14) coinsides in form with system (1.2.11). However,
if g(τ, x(τ)) ≡0 , this system falls into the independent subsystems
(1.2.15)
xi(τ + 1) = fi(τ, xi(τ)),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
each of the latter can possess the same degree of complexity of the solution
behavior as the system (1.2.11).

Generalities
We assume on system (1.2.17) that
(1) xj = (0, . . . , 0, xT
j , 0, . . . , 0)T ∈Rn, xj ∈Rnj,
f = (f T
1 , . . . , f T
m)T, f ∗
j (t, x) = fj(t, x) −fj(t, xj);
(2) Ikj = (IT
k1, IT
k2, . . . , IT
km)T, I∗
kj(x) = Ikj(x) −Ikj(xj), n = n1 +
· · · + nm.
The state of the j-th noninteracting impulsive subsystem is described by
the equations
(1.2.18)
dxj
dt = fj(t, xj),
t = τk(xj);
∆xj = Ikj(xj),
t = τk(xj).
The problem on stability for large scale impulsive system (1.2.16) is
formulated as follows:
To establish conditions under which stability of equilibrium state x = 0
of system (1.2.17) is derived from the properties of stability of impulse sub-
systems (1.2.18) and properties of connection functions f ∗
j (t, x) and I∗
kj(x).
Let x0(t) = x(t; t0, y0) (y0 = x0) be a given solution of the system
(1.2.16). Since the times of impulsive eﬀects on solution x0(t) may not
coincide with those on any neighboring solution x(t) of system (1.2.16), the
smallness requirement for the diﬀerence x(t)−x0(t) for all t ≥t0 seems
not natural.
Therefore the stability deﬁnitions presented in Section 1.2.1 for the sys-
tem of ordinary diﬀerential equations should be adapted to system (1.2.16).
We designate by Ξ a set of functions continuous from the left with dis-
continuities of the ﬁrst kind, deﬁned on R+ with the values in Rn. Let the
set of the discontinuity point of each of these functions be no more than
countable and do not contain ﬁnite limit points in R1. Let ζ ≥0 be a ﬁxed
number.
Deﬁnition 1.2.4 A function y(t) ∈Ξ is in ζ-neighborhood of function
x(t) ∈Ξ, if
(1) discontinuity points of function y(t) are in ζ-neighborhoods of dis-
continuity points of function x(t);
(2) for all t ∈R+, that do not belong to ζ-neighborhoods of discon-
tinuity points of function x(t), the inequality x(t) −y(t) < ζ is
satisﬁed.
The totality of ζ-neighborhoods, ζ ∈(0, ∞), of all elements of the set Ξ
forms the basis of topology, which is referred to as B-topology.
Let x(t) be a solution of system (1.2.16), and t = τk, k ∈Z, be an
ordered sequence of discontinuity points of this solution.

Deﬁnition 1.2.5 Solution x(t) of system (1.2.16) satisﬁes
(1) α-condition, if there exists a number ϑ ∈R+, ϑ > 0, such that for
all k ∈Z: τk+1 −τk ≥ϑ;
(2) β-condition, if there exists a k ≥0 such that every unit segment of
the real axis R+ contains no more than k points of sequence τk.
Let the solution x(t) satisfy one of the conditions (α or β) and be deﬁnite
on [a, ∞), a ∈R. Besides, the solution x(t) is referred to as unboundedly
continuable to the right.
Let the solution x0(t) = x(t; t0, y0) of system (4.2.1) exist for all t ≥t0
and be unperturbed. We assume that x0(t) reaches the surface Sk : t =
τk(x) at times tk, tk+1 > tk and tk →∞as k →∞.
Deﬁnition 1.2.6 Solution x0(t) of system (1.2.16) is
(i) stable, if for any tolerance ε > 0, ∆> 0, t0 ∈R+ a δ =
δ(t0, ε, ∆) > 0 exists such that condition x0 −y0 < δ implies
x(t) −x0(t) < ε for all t ≥t0 and |t −tk| > ∆, where x(t) is an
arbitrary solution of system (1.2.16) existing on interval [t0, ∞);
(ii) uniformly stable, if δ in condition (1) of Deﬁnition 1.2.6 does not
depend on t0;
(iii) attractive, if for any tolerance ε > 0, ∆> 0, t0 ∈R+ there
exist δ0 = δ0(t0) > 0 and T = T (t0, ε, ∆) > 0 such that when-
ever x0 −y0 < δ0, then x(t) −x0(t) < ε for t ≥t0 + T
and |t −tk| > ∆;
(iv) uniformly attractive, if δ0 and T in condition (3) of Deﬁnition 1.2.6
do not depend on t0;
(v) asymptotically stable, if conditions (1) and (3) of Deﬁnition 1.2.6
hold;
(vi) uniformly asymptotically stable, if conditions (2) and (3) of Deﬁni-
tion 1.2.6 hold.
Remark 1.2.1 If f(t, 0) = 0 and Ik(0) = 0, k ∈Z, then system (1.2.16)
admits zero solution. Moreover, if τk(x) ≡tk, k ∈Z, are such that τk(x)
do not depend on x, then any solution of system (1.2.16) undergoes the
impulsive eﬀect at one and the same time. This situation shows that the
notion of stability for system (1.2.16) is an ordinary one.
Remark 1.2.2 Actually the condition (1) of Deﬁnition 1.2.6 means that
for the solution x0(t) of system (1.2.16) to be stable in the sense of Liapunov,
it is necessary that for x(t0)−x0(t0) < δ any solution x(t) of the system
remain in the neighborhood of solution x0(t) for all t ∈[t0, ∞), and point
t0 is not to be the discontinuity point of solutions x(t) and x0(t).

(1.2.19)
µj
dyj
dt = gj(t, x, y, M),

(1.2.20)
where xi ∈Rni, n1+n2+· · ·+nq = n, yj ∈Rmj, m1+m2+· · ·+mr = m
and q+r = s; fi and gj are continuous vector functions of the corresponding
dimensions, µj are positional parameters, taking arbitrary small values,
µj ∈]0, 1], and M = diag {µ1, . . . , µr}. The set of all admissible values of
M is denoted by
M = {M : 0 < M ≤I}
I = diag {1, 1, . . ., 1}
and then
Mm = {M : 0 < µj < µjm
∀j ∈[1, r]},
where µjm is the upper admissible value of µj. If the small parameters µj
are not interconnected then the system (1.2.19), (1.2.20) has r essentially
independent timescales tj:

In this case the timescale is graduated nonuniformly. The timescales tj can
be interconnected through values τj:

j = 1, 2, . . . , r,
varying within the limits
(1.2.23)
τj ∈[τ j, τ j],
j = 1, 2, . . . , r,
where 0 < τ j ≤τ j < +∞for all j ∈[1, r].
In the case (1.2.23), (1.2.24) we have uniform graduation of the timescale.
This implies that
(1.2.24)
τj = µ1
µj
,
j = 1, 2, . . . , r.
It is clear then that τ1 = τ1 = τ 1 = 1.
The interconnected i-th singularly perturbed subsystem Si of the system
(1.2.19, (1.2.20) is described by the equations
dxi
dt = fi(t, x, y),
(1.2.25)
µi
dyi
dt = gi(t, x, y, M),
(1.2.26)
and the independent i-th singularly perturbed subsystem Si is described
by the equations
dxi
dt = fi(t, xi, yi),
(1.2.27)
µi
dyi
dt = gi(t, xi, yi, M),
(1.2.28)
where
xi = (0, 0, . . . , 0, xi, 0, . . . , 0)T ∈Rn,
xi ∈Rni,
yi = (0, 0, . . . , 0, yi, 0, . . . , 0)T ∈Rn,
yi ∈Rmi.
When q = r, we can consider the equations

(1.2.29)
0 = gi(t, xi, yi, 0),
(1.2.30)
which are referred to as the equations of the i-th degenerate independent
subsystem Si0 of the system (1.2.19), (1.2.20), and the equations

of the j-th independent subsystem of the boundary layer (fast subsystem)
Sj of the system (1.2.19), (1.2.20). In the system (1.2.31) α ∈R, bi =
(0, 0, . . . , 0, bi, 0, . . . , )T ∈Rn, bi ∈Rni.
If in (1.2.19), (1.2.20) all µj (formally) comprise a zero set then the
equations
dxi
dt = fi(t, x, y),
i = 1, 2, . . . , q,
(1.2.32)
0 = gj(t, x, y, 0),
j = 1, 2, . . . , r,
(1.2.33)
are called an interconnected degenerate subsystem S0 of the system (1.2.19),
(1.2.20), and the equations
(1.2.34)
µj
dyj
dt1
= gj(α, b, y, 0),
j = 1, 2, . . ., r,
are said to be an interconnected fast subsystem St (a boundary layer) of the
system (1.2.19), (1.2.20). Here α ∈R and b ∈Rn.
We suppose that the equations 0 = gj(t, x, y, 0) for all (t, x, y) ∈R ×
Nx × Ny are satisﬁed iﬀy = 0 and 0 = gj(t, xi, yj, 0) for all (t, xi, yj) ∈
R × Nix × Njy iﬀyj = 0. Therefore the systems (1.2.29), (1.2.30) and
(1.2.32), (1.2.33) are equivalent to the systems
dxi
dt = fi(t, xi, 0),
i = 1, 2, . . ., q,
(1.2.35)
dxi
dt = fi(t, x, 0),
i = 1, 2, . . . , q,
(1.2.36)
respectively.
The separation of the time scales in the investigation of the stability of
the system (1.2.19), (1.2.20) is essential since the analysis of the degenerate
system (1.2.29), (1.2.30) and the fast system (1.2.31) is simpler problem
than that of general problem of stability of the system (1.2.19), (1.2.20).
Stability analysis of systems of (1.2.19) and (1.2.20) type under nonclas-
sical structural perturbations is the subject of Chapter 5. In this chapter
the development of the direct Liapunov method in terms of matrix-valued
functions is proposed.
1.3 Structural Perturbations of Dynamical Systems
The processes and phenomena of the real world are modeled correctly by
the systems of equations or inequalities only when the model admits small
changes. In other words the phenomenon model is correct provided that
it allows some uncertainties in deﬁnitions of both the parameters and the
external eﬀects on the real system or process and at the same time displays
the main properties of the modeled process.

ferential equation

determine the vector ﬁeld on the compact manifold M. The naive specu-
lations above lead to the following notion of structural stability.
Deﬁnition 1.3.1
(see Arnol’d [1]) System (1.3.1) is structurally stable,
if for arbitrary small changes of the vector ﬁeld the obtained system is
equivalent to the initial one in the sense of ﬁxed dynamical property.
Andronov and Pontriagin [1] considered dynamical system on the disk
D2 and said that a system X is “rough” if, by perturbing it slightly in
the C1, one gets a system Y X and the corresponding homeomorphism can
be made arbitrarily small by taking Y close enough to X. They gave a set
of conditions as being necessary and suﬃcient for X to be rough (see de
Baggis [1]).
It seems that Lefschetz [1] was the ﬁrst who translated “rough” by the
much better sounding “structurally stable”. He exhibited the true meaning
of the new concept, namely a fusion of the two concepts of stability and
qualitative behavior in the sense of topological equivalence.
Let ρ be a metric in X, and we assume that there is also a metric in M n.
Deﬁnition 1.3.2 (see, e.g., Peixoto [1]) On a compact diﬀerentiable
manifold M n a vector ﬁeld X ∈X is said to be structurally stable, if given
ε > 0, one may ﬁnd δ > 0 such that wherenever ρ(X, Y ) < δ, then Y ∼X
and the corresponding homeomorphism is within ε from the identity.

discussed in the book by Arnol’d [1]. The Anosov’s theorem on structural
stability of torus automorphism and the Grobman-Hartman theorem on
structural stability of saddle are presented in this book as well. The readers
who are interested in the results in this direction can ﬁnd some references
in the survey by Sell [1].
In our monograph we apply the model of dynamical system under non-
classical structural perturbation which appeared in motion stability theory
of large scale systems. This model originates from one idea of Chetaev [1],
presented below and the notion of structural perturbations introduced ear-
lier in the works by Siljak [1 – 3].
1.3.2 An idea of parametric perturbations
Chetaev [1] proposed a
constructive realization of the Andronov-Pontryagin idea of motion stability
investigation of rough systems within the framework of the Liapunov direct
method. The general Chetaev’s approach is as follows.
Let the motion of system with ﬁnite degrees of freedom in “linear” ap-
proximation be described by the equations
(1.3.2)
dx
dt = Px,
x(t0) = x0,
where x ∈Rn and P = C + εF(t, x), C is a constant matrix, F(t, x)
is unknown in general matrix function with bounded real elements in the
domain R+ × Ω, Ω⊂Rn, ε is a real parameter. The fact that the system
(1.3.2) is of the form
(1.3.3)
dx
dt = Cx + εF(t, x)x
yields that for ε = 0 the system (1.3.3) does not have structural pertur-
bations and the properties of its equilibrium state x = 0 are completely
determined by signs of real parts of roots of the characteristic equation
(1.3.4)
det (C −λE) = 0.
In the case when all Re λi(C) < 0, i = 1, 2, . . ., n, under certain con-
ditions the equilibrium state x = 0 of (1.3.2) possesses the same type of
asymptotic stability as the system (1.3.3) for ε = 0.
A key idea in this approach is that the mathematical models of a real
system with structural perturbations is “decomposed” into a “stationary”
The problems of structural stability in one-dimensional case (M-circle),
systems on two-dimensional sphere, equations on torus and U-systems are
part and the terms bearing the information on structural and/or parametric
perturbations. Anyway the parametric perturbations must be small and
such that the solutions of system (1.3.3) must exist on the interval not
smaller than that on which the dynamics of system (1.3.3) is studied.
This Chetaev’s idea is used in the implicit form in modern nonlinear
dynamics of systems with uncertain parameter values.

1.3.3 ˇSiljak’s idea of connective stability
D.D. Siljak [1 – 3] pro-
posed a description of structural perturbations which appear in stability
investigation of large scale systems. In his model some dynamical system
(1.3.5)
dx
dt = f(t, x, E),
where x ∈Rn, f : R+ × Rn →Rn, is decomposed into m interconnected
subsystems
(1.3.6)
dxi
dt = fi(t, xi) + gi(t, x),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
where xi ∈Rni, gi : R+ × Rni →Rni, gi : R+ × Rn →Rni.
It is assumed that system (1.3.5) and the free subsystems
(1.3.7)
dxi
dt = fi(t, xi),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
satisfy the existence conditions for solutions x(t, t0, x0) for all (t0, x0) ∈
R+ × Rn and f(t, 0) = fi(t, 0) = 0 for all t ∈R+, i.e. the motions of
system (1.3.5) and subsystems (1.3.7) can be realized on any given time
interval.
In order to take into account the mutual interaction between subsystems
(1.3.7) in system (1.3.5) and the dynamical properties of the initial system
(1.3.5) the binary elements eij of the interaction matrix E are introduced
in the form
eij =
 1,
i-subsystem acts on j-subsystem,
0,
i-subsystem does not act on j-subsystem.
In this case the interconnection functions gi(t, x) are represented as
(1.3.8)
gi(t, x) = gi(t, ei1x1, ei2x2, . . . , eimxm),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
As a result structural perturbations to be considered in this connection
are such that any number of existing interconnections among the subsys-
tems (1.3.6) can be ON or OFF as arbitrary functions of the state x(t) ∈Rn
and/or time t ∈T0. At each instant of time t ∈T0 there is an intercon-
nection matrix E which describes the structure of system (1.3.5).
In terms of the above model of structural perturbations various stability
problems are investigated for the system (1.3.5) and its generalizations in
the sense of the following deﬁnition (see Siljak [4, 5]).
Deﬁnition 1.3.3 The equilibrium state x = 0 of a free dynamical
system (1.3.5) is connectively stable if and only if it is stable in the sense
of Liapunov for all interconnection matrices E.
It should be noted that in the above model the action of structural
perturbations “is revealed” as a result of the analysis of the initial systems
(1.3.5) decomposed into a series of the independent subsystems (1.3.7).
Besides, the right-hand side of the system (1.3.5) does not undergo any
changes.

Before we ﬁnish these comments we note that connective stability is a
Liapunov-type stability, and the diﬀerences between stability under struc-
tural perturbations and structural stability (catastrophe theory) are be-
tween stability in the sense of Liapunov and structural stability in the
sense of Andronov and Pontriagin. A system can be structurally stable,
yet unstable in the sense of Liapunov! For the details see Thom [1].
1.4
Stability under Nonclassical Structural Perturbations
The concept of stability under nonclassical structural perturbations is set
out using the example of large scale system of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions.
Let the behaviour of a mechanical or other nature system be described
by diﬀerential equations of the form
(1.4.1)
dx
dt = Q(t, x, P, S),
where x(t) ∈Rn for all t ∈(−∞, +∞), P ∈P, S ∈S, Q: R × Rn ×
P × S →Rn. Here P is a compact set in Rm describing parametric per-
turbations and S = (S1, . . . , Sn) is a ﬁnite set characteristic of admissible
structures Sk of system (1.4.1).
Further in Chapters 2–5 these sets will be concretized which is necessary
for constructing algorithms of motion stability analysis of the appropriate
systems of equations.

M = max(Q(t, x, P ∗, S∗)
for
|t−t0| ≤a, x−x0 ≤b, P −P ∗ ≤c)
for S∗∈S, which satisﬁes condition x(t) = x0 for t = t0. This solution is
a continuous function of parameters P ∈P in closed domain P −P ∗ ≤c
for given structure S∗∈S.
Proof of this assertion is based on the fundamental inequality

were the value δ1 characterizes the initial deviations of solutions x(t) and
y(t) of systems (1.4.5) and (1.4.6) for t = t0, i.e. x0 −y0 ≤δ1.
Estimate (1.4.7) allows one to show that the solutions of systems (1.4.5)
and (1.4.6) depend continuously on the system structure and/or parameter
only on the ﬁnite time interval. Hence it follows closeness of the appropriate
solutions on ﬁnite interval.
The problem on closeness of solutions to systems (1.4.5) and (1.4.6) on
inﬁnite interval is a subject of special investigation of theory of stability un-
der nonclassical structural perturbations which is basic in this monograph.
We add one more assumption to H1 – H3.
H4. System (1.4.1) possesses a trivial solution x = 0, which is preserved
for any (P, S) ∈P × S.
Since further solutions of system (1.4.1) are considered on the inﬁnite
time interval, we recall some conditions ensuring the existence of such so-
lutions.
Proposition 1.4.2 Let vector-function Q(t, x, P, S) be deﬁnite and
continuous in the domain of values (t, x) ∈R+×Rn for any (P, S) ∈P ×S
and in this domain the inequality
Q(t, x, P, S) ≤L(x)
for
(P, S) ∈P × S
holds true, where L(r) is a continuous function of r satisfying the condition
r

r0
dr
L(r) →+∞
for
r →+∞.
Moreover, the vector-function Q(t, x, P, S) satisﬁes the Lipschits condi-
tion in x in any domain {x ∈Rn : x ≤N} with constant K.
Then any solution x(t) of system (1.4.1) can be extended for all values
t0 ≤t < +∞.
Note that the constant K can depend on the value N and also on (P, S) ∈
P × S, i.e. K = K(N, P, S).
This assertion is proved by a slight modiﬁcation of the proof of Theorem
2.1.2 by Lakshmikantham and Leela [1].
System (1.4.1) is called the system with nonclassical structural perturba-
tions if for it assumptions H1–H4 are satisﬁed and any of its solutions has
an extension on the interval [t0, +∞).

In the investigation of the dynamical behavior of solutions to system
(1.4.1) under nonclassical structural perturbations we shall use deﬁnitions
obtained in terms of Deﬁnitions 1.2.1 – 1.2.3.
Deﬁnition 1.4.1 The equilibrium state x = 0 of system (1.4.1) is
(i) stable (in the whole) under nonclassical structural perturbations if
and only if it is stable (in the whole) in the sense of Liapunov (in the
sense of Barbashin-Krasovskii) for any (P, S) ∈(P, S) respectively;
(ii) unstable under nonclassical structural perturbations if and only if it
is unstable in the sense of Liapunov for at least one pair (P, S) ∈
(P, S).
Deﬁnitions of other types of stability are formulated in the same way as
Deﬁnition 1.4.1(i) and are presented in the book when necessary.
Remark 1.4.1 The concept of stability under nonclassical structural per-
turbations is not identical with the concept of connected stability intro-
duced by Siljak [1–3] and is further development of the notion of stability
in mathematical system theory.
Remark 1.4.2 Further on for the sake of briefness alongside the expres-
sion “under nonclassical structural perturbations” a more short expression
“on P × S” is used.

1.5 Method of Stability Analysis of Motion
The main method of stability analysis of systems of (1.4.1) type is the
method of Liapunov functions. In the monograph by Gruji´c et al. [1] the
results of stability analysis of systems under nonclassical structural per-
turbations are presented obtained in terms of vector Liapunov functions.
Besides new aggregation forms are presented for large-scale systems and
conditions for diﬀerent types of motion stability are established. Models of
large-scale Lurie-Postnikov systems and power systems are considered as
examples.
In this monograph we propose to apply the matrix-valued Liapunov func-
tions for stability analysis of large-scale systems mentioned in Section 1.2.
This method is developed recently in qualitative theory of equations and is
set out in Martynyuk [1, 2]. We shall recall some notions of this technique.
Presently the Liapunov direct method (see Liapunov [1]) in terms of three
classes of auxiliary functions: scalar, vector and matrix ones is intensively
applied in qualitative theory. In this point we shall present the description
of the matrix-valued auxiliary functions.
For the system (1.2.6) we shall consider a continuous matrix-valued func-
tion
(1.5.1)
U(t, x) = [vij(t, x)],
i, j = 1, 2, . . ., m,
where vij ∈C(Tτ × Rn, R) for all i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. We assume that the
following conditions are fulﬁlled
(i) vij(t, x), i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m, are locally Lipschitzian in x;
(ii) vij(t, 0) = 0 for all t ∈R+ (t ∈Tτ), i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m;
(iii) vij(t, x) = vji(t, x) in any open connected neighborhood N of point
x = 0 for all t ∈R+ (t ∈Tτ).
Deﬁnition 1.5.1 All functions of the type
(1.5.2)
v(t, x, α) = αTU(t, x)α,
α ∈Rm,
where U ∈C(Tτ × N, Rm×m), are attributed to the class SL.
Here the vector α can be speciﬁed as follows:
(i) α = y ∈Rm, y = 0;
(ii) α = ξ ∈C(Rn, Rm
+ ), ξ(0) = 0;
(iii) α = ψ ∈C(Tτ × Rn, Rm
+ ), ψ(t, 0) = 0;
(iv) α = η ∈Rm
+, η > 0.
Note that the choice of vector α can inﬂuence the property of having a
ﬁxed sign of function (1.5.1) and its total derivative along solutions of sys-
tem (1.2.6).
For the functions of the class SL we shall cite some deﬁnitions which are
applied in the investigation of dynamics of system in the book.

1.6 Notes and References
Section 1.2
The problem of motion stability arises whenever the engineering or
physical problem is formulated as a mathematical problem of qualitative analysis
of equations. Poincare and Liapunov laid a background for the method of aux-
iliary functions for continuous systems which allow not to integrate the motion
equations for their qualitative analysis. The ideas of Poincare and Liapunov were
further developed and applied in many branches of modern natural sciences.
The results of Liapunov [1], Chetaev [1], Persidskii [1], Malkin [1], Ascoli [1],
Barbasin and Krasovskii [1], Massera [1], and Zubov [1], were a base for Deﬁ-
nitions 1.2.1 – 1.2.3 (ad hoc see Gruji´c et al. [1], pp. 8 – 12 and cf. Rao Mohana
Rao [1], Yoshizawa [1], Rouche et al. [1], Antosiewicz [1], Lakshmikantham an
Leela [1], Hahn [2], etc.). For Deﬁnitions 1.2.4 – 1.2.7, and 1.2.13 see Hahn [2],
and Martynyuk [9]. Deﬁnitions 1.2.8 – 1.2.12 are based on some results by Li-
apunov [1], Hahn [2], Barbashin and Krasovskii [1] (see and cf. Djordjevic [1],
Gruji´c [3], and Martynyuk [2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 17]).
Discrete systems appear to be eﬃcient mathematical models in the investiga-
tion of many real world processes and phenomena (see Samarskii and Gulia [1]).
Note that yet in the works by Euler and Lagrange the so-called recurrent series
and some problems of probability theory were studied being described by discrete
(ﬁnite diﬀerence) equations. The active investigation of discrete systems (for the
last three decades) is stipulated by new problems of the technical progress. Dis-
crete equations prove to be the most eﬃcient model in description of the mechan-
ical system with impulse perturbations as well as the systems comprising digital
computing devices. Recently the discrete systems have been applied in the mod-
elling of processes in population dynamics, macro-economy, chaotic dynamics of
economic systems, modelling of recurrent neuron networks, chemical reactions,
dynamics of discrete Markov processes, ﬁnite and probably automatic machines
and computing processes.
The dynamics of discrete-time systems is in the focus of attention of many
experts (see, for example, Aulbach [1], Diamond [1], Elaydi and Peterson [1],
Luca and Talpalaru [1], Maslovskaya [1], etc.).
Many evolution processes are characterized by the fact that at certain mo-
ments of time they experience a change of state abruptly. This is due to short
term perturbations whose duration is negligible in comparison with the dura-
tion of the process. It is natural, therefore, to assume that such perturbations
act instantaneously, that is, in the form of impulses. Thus impulsive diﬀeren-
tial equations, namely, diﬀerential equations involving impulse eﬀects, appear as
natural description of observed evolution phenomenon of several real-world prob-
lems.
Of course, the theory of impulsive diﬀerential equations is much richer
than the corresponding theory of diﬀerential equations without impulse eﬀects
(see Blaquiere [1], Krylov and Bogoliubov [1], Mil’man and Myshkis [1], Myshkis
and Samoilenko [1], etc.).
For Deﬁnitions 1.4.1 – 1.4.3 see Lakshmikantham, Bainov, et al. [1], Samoilenko
and Perestyuk [1], Simeonov and Bainov [1], etc.
Original results and the surveys of some directions of investigations are pre-
sented in the monographs by Lakshmikantham, Leela, and Martynyuk [1, 2], Pan-
dit and Deo [1], and in many papers.

Generalities
The physical system can consist of subsystems that react diﬀerently to the
external impacts (see Pontryagin [1], Tikhonov [1], Volosov [1], Hopensteadt [1],
Gruji´c, et al. [1], etc.). Moreover, each of the subsystems has its own scale of
natural time. In the case when the subsystems are not interconnected, the dy-
namical properties of each subsystem are examined in terms of the corresponding
time scale. It turned out that it is reasonable to use such information when the
additional conditions on the subsystems are formulated in the investigation of
large scale systems. The existence of various time scales related to the separated
subsystems is mathematically expressed by arbitrarily small positive parameters
µi present at the part of the higher derivatives in diﬀerential equation. If the
parameters µi vanish, the number of diﬀerential equations of the large scale sys-
tem is diminished and, hence the appearance of algebraic equations. This is just
the singular case allowing the consideration of various peculiarities of the system
with diﬀerent time scales.
Modern analytical and qualitative methods of analysis of singularly perturbed
systems are based on some ideas and results of the classical works by Tikhonov and
Pontryagin. The development of general ideas in the direction is presented in the
papers and monographs by Vasil’eva and Butuzov [1], Mishchenko and Rozov [1],
Eckhaus [1], Carrier [1], O’Malley [1], Kokotovic and Khalil [1], Miranker [1],
Chang and Howes [1], etc.
Section 1.3
Various problems of the stability theory under classical structural
perturbations were studied in many papers (see, e.g. Aeppli and Markus [1],
Arnol’d [1], Bowen and Ruelle [1], Conley and Zehnder [1], Coppel [1], Cronin [1],
Hale [1], Hirsch [1], Kneser [1], Kaplan [1], Markus [1], Moser [1], Pilugin [1],
Shub [1], Zeeman [1], etc.).
This Section encorporates some results by Arnol’d [1], Sell [1], Lefshetz [1],
Peixoto [1], ˇSiljak [1], and Chetaev [1], etc.
Section 1.4
We focused main attention on the concept of stability under non-
classical structural perturbations in the sense of Liapunov. We used in the point
the results from monograph by Gruji´c, Martynyuk and Ribbens-Pavella [1].
Section 1.5
For the details of the method of matrix-valued Liapunov functions
see Martynyuk [1–3] and Djordjevi´c [1].
This method has been developed at
the Stability of Processes Department of the Institute of Mechanics of NAS of
Ukraine since 1979 (see Ph.D. thesises by Shegai [1], Miladzhanov [1], Azimov [1],
Begmuratov [1], Martynyuk-Chernienko [1], Slyn’ko [1], Lykyanova [1]).
For the recent papers concerning the topics of Sections 1.2 – 1.5 see Kramer
and Hofman [1].
We note that the two-index system of functions (1.5.1) being suitable for con-
struction of the Liapunov functions allows to involve more wide classes of func-
tions as compared with those usually applied in motion stability theory.
For
example, the bilinear forms prove to be natural non-diagonal elements of matrix-
valued functions. Another peculiar feature of the approach being of importance
is the fact that the application of the matrix-valued function in the investigation
of multidimensional systems enables to allow for the interconnections between
the subsystems in their natural form, i.e. not necessarily as the destabilizing fac-
tor. Finally, for the determination of the property of having a ﬁxed sign of the
total derivative of auxiliary function along solutions of the system under con-
sideration it is not necessary to encorporate the estimation functions with the
quasi-monotonicity property. Naturally, the awkwardness of calculations in this
case is the price.

CONTINUOUS LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS
2.1 Introduction
Qualitative analysis of nonlinear systems by Liapunov’s direct (second)
method (see Liapunov [1]) can be eﬀectively done only when there is an
algorithm of construction of an appropriate function for the system under
consideration.
A series of investigations simplify the initial problem so
that stability properties are deﬁned not immediatelly, but via investigation
of an intermediate system. Here we study large scale nonlinear continuous
systems under nonclassical structural perturbations in context with method
of Liapunov matrix-valued functions.
The purpose of this Chapter is to obtain suﬃcient conditions for asymp-
totic stability (in the whole), uniform asymptotic stability (in the whole),
exponential stability (in the whole), and instability of solutions of nonlinear
large scale systems under nonclassical structural perturbations by applying
matrix Liapunov’s functions method.
The present chapter is arranged as follows.
In Section 2.2 the composition of continuous large scale system under
given models of connectedness is described.
Section 2.3 provides necessary information about the matrix-valued func-
tions which are applied in the investigation of large scale continuous systems
under nonclassical structural perturbations.

Section 2.4 is focussed on the new suﬃcient conditions for various types
of stability of nonlinear systems under nonclassical structural perturba-
tions. These conditions were established while solving Problem CA and
Problem CB.
In Section 2.5 the method of choosing the elements of the matrix-valued
function is concretized and the results of stability investigation of linear
system under nonclassical structural perturbations are presented. General
results are illustrated by the numerical examples.
The ﬁnal Section 2.6 indicates some possible trends of the further deve-
lopment of the method of matrix-valued functions and their applications.
Namely, in point 2.6.1 Liapunov’s matrix-valued function is applied in sta-
bility investigation with respect to two measures under nonclassical struc-
tural perturbations. In point 2.6.2 the problem of stability of large scale
power system under nonclassical structural perturbations is discussed.
2.2 Nonclassical Structural Perturbations in Time-Continuous
Systems
We consider nonlinear continuous systems whose description is based on
the assumptions below. Furtheron the systems, subsystems, of this class
are designated by C, Ci, respectively.
H1. The imaginary mechanical or other system C consists of m inter-
acting subsystems Ci, whose behaviour is described by continuous systems
of ordinary diﬀerential equations the order of which is not changed on the
interval of the system functionning.
H2. The internal (e.g., parametric) or external perturbations of the C
are characterized by the matrix P = (pT
1 , pT
2 , . . . , pT
m)T ∈Rm×q. The set
of all admissible matrices P is designated by
(2.2.1)
P = {P : P1 ≤P(t) ≤P2,
for all
t ∈R},
where P1 and P2 are the prescribed constant matrices.
H3. The family F, is determined consisting of the vector functions f1,
f2, . . . , fm for which f k
i ∈C(T × Rn × R1×q, Rni), for all k = 1, 2, . . . , N,
where N is a real number, n = n1 + n2 + · · · + nm, and i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
H4. The dynamics of the interconnected subsystem Ci in system C is
described by the equations
(2.2.2)
dxi
dt = fi(t, x, pi),
i = 1, 2, . . ., m,
where xi ∈Rni, fi ∈Fi, Fi = {f 1
i , f 2
i , . . . , f N
i }, x = (xT
1, . . . , xT
i , . . . , xT
m)T.
The functions fi in system (2.2.2) satisfy the condition fi(t, 0, 0) = 0 for
all t ∈T .
H5. The dynamics of the i-th isolated subsystem Ci is descibed by the
equations
(2.2.3)

Here xi ∈Rni, the state vector of the subsystem Ci, and the functions
gi : T × Rni →Rni are determined by the correlations
gi(t, xi) = fi(t, xi, 0),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
where xi = (0, . . . , 0, xT
i , 0, . . . , 0)T.
The subsystems (2.2.3) do not contain structural and/or parametric per-
turbations and bear the main information on the dynamical properties of
subsystems Ci, while the functions

i = 1, 2, . . . , m
in the system

dt = gi(t, xi) + hi(t, x, pi),
i = 1, 2, . . ., m,

tem C on the subsystem Ci.
Designate by Hi the set of all possible hi, from
hj
i(t, x, pi) = f j
i (t, x, pi) −gi(t, xi),
j = 1, 2, . . . , N,
i = 1, 2, . . ., m.
The fact that f j
i (t, x, pi) ∈Fi implies that hj
i(t, x, pi) ∈Hi for all
i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
The binary function sij : T →{0, 1} is applied as a structural parameter
of system (sij : T →[0, 1] ). This function represents the (i, j)-th element
of the structural matrix Si : R →Rni×Nni of the i-th interconnecting
subsystem Si.

Remark 2.2.1 On the set N = {1, . . . , N} the variation of the exponent
k(t) ∈N for all t ∈R describes structural changes of system C. System
C is structurally invariant if and only if k(t) = const, or if the set N is
unitary. Thus, N indicates the number of all possible structures of the
system C.
Remark 2.2.2 The set P can be either singleton, i.e. P ≜p, p ∈∆⊂
R1, ∆is a compact in R1, or empty (P1 ≡P2 ≡0). In the case when
P = ∅the system C does not have parametric perturbations, but it can
have structural changes, since f ∈F.
Remark 2.2.3 It is easy to notice that the proposed formalization of
motion equations for continuous multidimansional system C and their rep-
resentations in the form of (2.2.5) or the vector form (2.2.6) is one of possible
realizations of the general Chetayev’s idea [1] described above.
2.3 Estimates of Matrix-Valued Functions
Together with (2.2.6) we consider a matrix-valued function
(2.3.1)
U(t, x) = [vij(t, x)]
for all
(i, j) = 1, 2, . . ., m,
where vii ∈C(R+ × Rn, R+) for all i = 1, 2, . . ., m and vij ∈C(R+ ×
Rn, R) for all i = j, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m.
By means of (2.3.1) a scalar
function

2.4 Tests for Stability Analysis
2.4.1 The Problem CA
This section gives a solution of the following
problem.
Problem CA. Let the continuous dynamical system C be obtained as a
result of composition of the interacting subsystems (2.2) according to the
adopted model of generalized connectedness. It is necessary to establish
suﬃcient conditions of various types of stability for the equilibrium state
x = 0 of the system (2.6) in terms of the dynamical characteristics of the
isolated subsystems (2.3) and qualitative estimates of the interconnection
functions between these subsystems.
But ﬁrst, for the reader’s convenience, we recall some deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 The equilibrium x = 0 of system (2.2.6) possesses
certain dynamical property under parametric and/or nonclassical structural
perturbations if and only if this equilibrium state possesses the correspond-
ing dynamical property for any (P, S) ∈P × S.
According to some results from Section 1.5 we will use the following
deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.4.2 The function
D+v(t, x, ψ)
= lim
δ→0+ sup{[v(t + δ, x + δ(g(t, x) + S(t)h(t, x, P)), ψ) −v(t, x, ψ)] δ−1}
for all (t, x) ∈R+ × Rn and (P, S) ∈P × S is called total derivative of
the matrix-valued function (2.3.2) along solutions of the system (2.2.6).
We designate Nix0 = {xi : xi ∈Nix ⊆Rni, xi = 0}, and formulate one
more assumption.

This completes the proof of Proposition 2.4.1.
By means of U(t, x) = diag U(t, x) = [v11(t, x1), . . . , vmm(t, xm)], a ma-
trix K and a vector ψ ∈Rm we construct the vector function
(2.4.3)
L(t, x, ψ) = K U(t, x)ψ
with components L1(t, x, ψ), L2(t, x, ψ), . . . , Lm(t, x, ψ).
Following Gruji´c et al. [1] we will use the next deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.4.3
We say that the set Lζ(t) is a maximal connected
neighborhood of the origin for each ζ ∈(0, +∞) and t ∈R if x ∈Lζ(t)
implies Lζ(t, x, ψ) < ζ.
Let O be a set {x: x = 0}.
Deﬁnition 2.4.4 We say that time-varying set Π(t) is asymptotically
contractive (or asymptotically contracts to O) iﬀ:
(1) there exists a τ ∈R such that Π(t) is a neighbourhood of the origin
for any t ≤τ and
(2) lim [Π(t): t →+∞] = O.
We note that the notions of asymptotically contractive sets with respect
to functions were discovered by Gruji´c [1].
The following theorem provides our main characterization of stability
under nonclassical structural perturbations.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Stability Theory of Large-Scale

Theorem 2.4.1 Assume that the perturbed motion equations (2.2.10)
are such that all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 are satisﬁed
except for upper estimates of the functions vii(t, xi) and vij(t, xi, xj) for all
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m and moreover
(1) there exist positive numbers ξi (or ξi = +∞) such that the sets
Liζi(t) are asymptotically contractive for any ζi ∈(0, ξi) and
any i = 1, 2, . . . , m;
(2) the matrix A is positive deﬁnite;
(3) there exists a negative deﬁnite matrix Q ∈Rm×m such that
1
2 (Q(P, S) + QT(P, S)) ≤Q
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is asymptotically
stable on P × S
If all hypotheses of the theorem hold for Nix = Rni, for radially un-
bounded functions vii(t, xi) and vij(t, xi, xj) and for ξi = +∞for any
i = 1, 2, . . . , m, then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is
asymptotically stable in the whole on P × S.
Proof If Assumption 2.3.1, Proposition 2.3.1 and hypothesis (b) of the
theorem are satisﬁed, the function (2.3.2) is positive deﬁnite on N1x×N2x×
. . . × Nmx. Hypothesis (a) of the theorem ensures asymptotic contraction
of the set L1ζ1(t) × L2ζ2(t) × . . . × Lmζm(t) for every ζi ∈(0, ξi) for all
i = 1, 2, . . . , m. Let Lζ(t) be the largest connected neighbourhood of x = 0,
so that Lζ(t, x, ψ) < ζ for all x ∈Lζ(t) and for all t ∈R+. Therefore,
the set Lζ(t) is asymptotically contractive for every ζ ∈(0, ξ), where ξ =
min{ψ2
i ξi : i = 1, 2, . . . , m}.
Further by Assumption 2.4.1 there exists a connected neighbourhood Nx
of the state x = 0: Nx ⊆N1x × N2x × . . . × Nmx such that the conditions
of Proposition 2.4.1 hold. By hypothesis (c) of the theorem the expression
D+v(t, x, ψ) is negative deﬁnite for any (P, S) ∈P × S. As is known (see
Theorem 1.2.3) these conditions are suﬃcient for asymptotic stability of
equilibrium state of the system (2.2.1) on P × S.
In case Nix = Rni the function (2.3.2) is positive deﬁnite and radially
unbounded.
This fact together with other hypotheses of Theorem 2.4.1
proves its second assertion. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.4.1.
Theorem 2.4.2 Assume that the perturbed motion equations (2.2.10)
are such that all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 are satisﬁed
with ∆(t) = 1 for all t ∈R+ and
(1) the matrices A and B are positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a negative deﬁnite matrix Q ∈Rm×m such that
1
2 (Q(P, S) + QT(P, S)) ≤Q
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is uniformly asymp-
totically stable on P × S.
If moreover for Nix = Rni the functions vii(t, xi) and vij(t, xi, xj) are
radially unbounded and the functions ϕi ∈KR, then the equilibrium state
x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is uniformly asymptotically stable in the whole
on P × S.
The Proof of Theorem 2.4.2 is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.4.1.

Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10) is exponentially stable

If all hypotheses of the theorem are satisﬁed for Nix = Rni then the

Therefore the

If Nix = Rni for all i = 1, 2, . . . , m, then Nx = Rn and all hypotheses
of Theorem 2.5.6 by Martynyuk [13] are satisﬁed for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Hence, the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10) is exponentially stable in
the whole on P × S. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.4.3.

Assumption 2.4.2 Let in the inequalities (3) (a) – (f) of Assump-
tion 2.4.1 sign “≤” be reversed, i.e. “≥”.
Proposition 2.4.2 If all hypotheses of Assumption 2.4.2 hold, then
D+v(t, x, ψ) ≥wTQ(P, S)w
for all (t, x) ∈R+ × Nx0 and for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Here the vector w and matrix Q(P, S) are deﬁned in the same way as in
Proposition 2.4.1.
The Proof is similar to that of Proposition 2.1.2.
Theorem 2.4.4 Assume that the perturbed motion equations (2.2.10)
are such that all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.2 are satisﬁed
with function ∆(t) = 1 for all t ∈R+ and
(1) matrices A and B are positive deﬁnite,
(2) there exists a positive deﬁnite matrix D ∈Rm×m such that for
matrix Q(P, S) the estimate
1
2 (Q(P, S) + QT(P, S)) ≥D
holds at least for one pair (P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10) is unstable on P × S.
Proof We construct a scalar function (2.3.2) based on a matrix-valued
function U(t, x). Due to Assumption 2.3.1, Proposition 2.3.3 and conditions
(a) of Theorem 2.4.4 the function v(t, x, ψ) is positive deﬁnite and admits
inﬁnitely small upper bound on Nx. By Assumption 2.4.2, Proposition 2.4.2
and conditions (b) of Theorem 2.4.4 the function D+v(t, x, ψ) is positive
deﬁnite at least for one pair (P, S) ∈P × S.
These conditions are suﬃcient (see Theorem 2.5.7 by Martynyuk [13])
for instability of the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10).

Since all hypotheses of Theorem 2.4.1 are satisﬁed, the state x = 0
(x ∈R4) of (2.4.4) is asymptotically stable in the whole on S.
Remark 2.4.2 Example 2.4.1 was studied by Gruji´c, et al. [1] by means
of Liapunov vector function with the components
vi(t, xi) = (1 + t2)(|xi1| + |xi2|),
i = 1, 2.
By means of this function the aggregation matrix for Example 2.4.1 was
obtained as follows
A(S) =

Having compared the matrix Q obtained in terms of the matrix-valued
function with elements (2.4.6), (2.4.7) with the matrix A obtained in terms
of the vector-function one can easily see that the estimates of total deri-
vative of the auxiliary function along solutions of system (2.4.4) based on
the matrix Q extend the possibilities of the Liapunov direct method in the
investigation of this system.
2.4.2 The Problem CB In this section we propose a solution of Prob-
lem CB which is formulated as follows.
Problem CB. Let the continuous dynamical system (C) be obtained
as a result of composition of the interacting subsystems (2.2) according to
the adopted generalized model of connectedness. It is necessary to establish
suﬃcient conditions of various types of stability for the equilibrium state
x = 0 of system (2.6) in terms of the dynamical characteristics of the
interacting subsystems (2.2) when there is no information on the dynamical
properties of the isolated subsystems (2.3).
Let with interconnected subsystems (2.2.5) the elements of matrix-valued
function U(t, x) be connected for which Assumption 2.2.1 holds. Now we
shall formulate some more assumptions.

Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is asymptotically
stable on P × S.
If all hypotheses of Theorem 2.4.5 hold for Nix = Rni for radially
unbounded functions vij(t, ·), i, j = 1, 2, . . ., m, then the equilibrium state
x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is asymptotically stable in the whole on P ×S.

(2) the matrices A and B in the inequalities (2.3.7) are positive deﬁnite.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is uniformly asymp-
totically stable on P × S.

equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is exponentially stable in the
whole on P × S.
The Proof of Theorem 2.4.7 is similar to that of Theorem 2.4.3.

Theorem 2.4.8 Let perturbed motion equations (2.2.10) be such that
all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.4 are satisﬁed, except for the
estimate from above of functions v(t, x, η).
If hypotheses (a) and (b) of Theorem 2.4.5 are satisﬁed and there exists
a negative deﬁnite matrix G ∈Rm×m such that for matrix G(P, S) the
estimate
1
2 ( G(P, S) + GT(P, S)) ≤G
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S
holds elementwise, then the equilibrium state x = 0 of system (2.2.10) is
asymptotically stable on P × S.
If all hypotheses of Theorem 2.4.8 are satisﬁed for Nix = Rni and for ra-
dially unbounded functions vij and for ξi = +∞when each i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
then the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10) is asymptotically stable in the
whole on P × S.
The Proof of Theorem 2.4.8 is similar to that of Theorem 2.4.1.
Theorem 2.4.9 Let perturbed motion equations (2.2.10) be such that
all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.4 are satisﬁed for ϕ(t) ≡1

Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10) is uniformly asymptotically
stable on P × S.
If, moreover Nix = Rni, functions vij are radially unbounded and func-
tions ϕi are of Hahn class KR, then the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10)

The Proof of Theorem 2.4.9 is similar to that of Theorem 2.4.2.

2.4.3 Instability conditions
Some modiﬁcations of Assumptions 2.4.1
and 2.4.3 allow to apply the obtained inequalities for establishing instability
of the equilibrium state x = 0 of system (2.2.1).
Assumption 2.4.5 Let in the inequalities (iii) (a) – (b) of Assump-
tion 2.4.3 the sign “≤” be reversed, i.e. “≥”.
Proposition 2.4.5 If all conditions of Assumption 2.4.5 are satisﬁed,
then
D+v(t, x, ψ) ≥wTΞ(P, S)w|β(t, x)|
for all (t, x) ∈R+ × Nx0 (for all (t, x) ∈R+ × Rn) and for all (P, S) ∈
P × S.
Here the function β(t, x), vector w and matrix Θ(P, S) are deﬁned as in
Proposition 2.4.3.
Theorem 2.4.11 Assume that the perturbed motion equations (2.2.10)
are such that all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.5 are satisﬁed
with function β(t, x) = 1 for all t ∈R+ and
(1) the matrices A and B are positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a positive deﬁnite matrix D∗∈Rm×m such that
1
2 (Ξ(P, S) + ΞT(P, S)) ≥D∗
at least for one pair (P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.2.10) is unstable.

Proof We construct a scalar function (2.3.2) based on a matrix-valued
function (2.3.2). Due to Assumption 2.3.1, Proposition 2.3.1 and condition
(a) of Theorem 2.4.11 the function (2.3.2) is positive deﬁnite and admits
inﬁnitely small upper bound on Nx ⊆Rn. By Assumption 2.4.5, Propo-
sition 2.4.4 and condition (b) of Theorem 2.4.11 the function D+v(t, x, ψ)
is positive deﬁnite at least for one pair (P, S) ∈P × S. These conditions
(see Theorem 2.5.7 by Martynyuk [13]) are suﬃcient for the instability of
the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10).
Assumption 2.4.6 Let in inequalities of Assumption 2.4.4 the sign
“≤” be reversed, i.e. “≥”.
Proposition 2.4.6 If all conditions of Assumption 2.4.4 are satisﬁed,
then for D+v(t, x, ψ) the estimate
D+v(t, x, ψ) ≥uT G(P, S)u
takes place for all (t, x) ∈R × Nx0, and for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Here the vector u and the matrix G(P, S) are deﬁned in the same way
as in Proposition 2.4.4.
The Proof of Proposition 2.4.6 is similar to that of Proposition 2.4.5.
Theorem 2.4.12 Let perturbed motion equations (2.2.10) be such that
all conditions of Assumptions 2.3.1 and 2.4.6 are satisﬁed and
(1) the matrices A and B are positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a positive deﬁnite matrix
G ∈Rm×m, such that the
estimate
1
2 ( G(P, S) + GT(P, S)) ≥G
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S
is true.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of (2.2.10) is unstable on P × S.
The Proof of Theorem 2.4.7 is similar to that of Theorem 2.4.11.

The estimate (b) is proved similarly.
Proposition 2.5.2 If estimates (a) and (b) of Proposition 2.5.1 hold,
then the total derivative (2.5.6) of the function (2.5.4) by virtue of the
system (2.5.1) is estimated by the inequality
(2.5.7)

Theorem 2.5.1 Assume that the system (2.5.1) is such that
(1) there exists a matrix-valued function (2.5.2) with elements (2.5.3);
(2) the matrix A in (2.5.5) is positive deﬁnite;

(3) there exists a negative deﬁnite matrix Ω∈Rm×m such that

Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (2.5.1) is asymptotically
stable in the whole on S.
Remark 2.5.1 If in the system (2.5.1) there are no structural perturba-

2.6 Certain Trends of Generalizations and Applications
2.6.1 Stability analysis with respect to two measures
For the
reader’s convinience we shall recall some notions of stability theory where
the motion properties are studied with the application of two measures.
Further system (2.2.7) is considered under all but one assumptions made
in Section 2.2. In this subsection the right-hand side of system (2.2.7) is
not assumed vanishing for x = 0.
The state of system (2.2.7) is characterised by means of two measures
ρ0(t, x) and ρ(t, x), taking their values from the sets
M =

ρ ∈C(T × R2k, R+):
inf
(t,x) ρ(t, x) = 0

,
M0 =

ρ ∈M :
inf
x ρ(t, x) = 0
for all
t ∈T

.
Let U(t, x) be a matrix-valued function, i.e. U : T × Rn →Rm×m with
the elements
(2.6.1)
uij : T × Rn →R,
(i, j) = 1, 2, . . . , m.
The property of having a ﬁxed sign of the matrix-valued function U(t, x)
with respect to measure ρ(t, x) is determined as follows.
Let w ∈Rm and v: T × Rn × Rm →R be determined by w and U by
the formula
(2.6.2)
v(t, x, w) = wTU(t, x)w.

Deﬁnition 2.6.1 The matrix-valued function U : R × Rn →Rm×m is
(1) ρ-positive deﬁnite on Tτ, τ ∈R, if there exist an open connected
subset N ⊆Rn, 0 ∈N, a comparison function a ∈K and a
constant ∆1 > 0 such that
(2.6.3)
a(ρ(t, x)) ≤v(t, x, w)
for all
(t, x, w = 0) ∈Tτ × N × Rm
whenever ρ(t, x) < ∆1;
(2) ρ-positive deﬁnite on Tτ × S, if all conditions of deﬁnition (1) are
satisﬁed for N = S;
(3) ρ-positive deﬁnite in the whole on Tτ, if conditions of deﬁnition (1)
are satisﬁed for N = Rn, a ∈KR and ∆1 = +∞;
(4) ρ-negative deﬁnite (in the whole) on Tτ (on Tτ × N), if (−v) is
ρ-positive deﬁnite (in the whole) on Tτ (on Tτ × N).
The expression “on Tτ” is omitted in Deﬁnitions (1) – (4) if and only if
the conditions of these deﬁnitions are satisﬁed for τ ∈R.
Proposition 2.6.1 For the matrix-valied function U : R×Rn →Rm×m
to be ρ-positive deﬁnite on Tτ, it is necessary and suﬃcient that it can be
represented as
(2.6.4)
v(t, x, w) = wTU+(t, x)w + a(ρ(t, x))
for
ρ(t, x) < ∆1
and
(t, x, w = 0) ∈Tτ × N × Rm,
where U+(t, x) is positive semi-deﬁnite on Tτ
matrix-valued function
and a ∈K.
For the the proof see Martynyuk [8].

Deﬁnition 2.6.2 The matrix-valued function U : R × Rn →Rm×m is
(1) ρ-decreasing on Tτ, τ ∈R, if there exist an open connected subset
N ⊆Rn, 0 ∈N, a comparison function b ∈K and a constant
∆2 > 0 such that
v(t, x, w) ≤b(ρ(t, x))
for all
(t, x, w = 0) ∈Tτ × N × Rm
whenever ρ(t, x) < ∆2;
(2) ρ-decreasing on Tτ ×S, if all conditions of deﬁnition (1) are satisﬁed
for N = S;
(3) ρ-decreasing in the whole on Tτ, if all conditions of deﬁnition (1)
are satisﬁed for N = Rn, b ∈KR and ∆2 = +∞;
(4) weakly ρ-decreasing on Tτ, if all conditions of deﬁnition (1) are
satisﬁed with the comparison function b of class CK, i.e.
v(t, x, w) ≤b(t, ρ(t, x))
for all
(t, x, w = 0) ∈Tτ × N × Rm
whenever ρ(t, x) < ∆3, ∆3 > 0;
(5) asymptotically ρ-decreasing on Tτ, if all conditions of deﬁnition (1)
are satisﬁed with the comparison function b of class KL, i.e
v(t, x, w) ≤b(ρ(t, x), t)
for all
(t, x, w = 0) ∈Tτ × N × Rm
whenever ρ(t, x) < ∆4, ∆4 > 0.
The expression “on Tτ” in deﬁnitions (1) – (3) is omitted, if all conditions
are satisﬁed for τ ∈R.
Proposition 2.6.2 For the matrix-valued function U : R×Rn →Rm×m
to be ρ-decreasing on Tτ, it is necessary and suﬃcient that it can be rep-
resented as
(2.6.5)
v(t, x, w) = wTU−(t, x)w + b(ρ(t, x))
for
ρ(t, x) < ∆2
and
(t, x, w = 0) ∈Tτ × N × Rm,
where U−(t, x) is negative semi-deﬁnite on Tτ matrix-valued function and
function b is of class K.
The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 2.6.1 with the function
wTU−(t, x)w = v(t, x, w) −b(ρ(t, x)).
Deﬁnition 2.6.3 The matrix-valued function U : R × Rn →Rm×m is
(1) radially ρ-unbounded on Tτ, if for ρ(t, x) →+∞
v(t, x, w) →+∞
for all
t ∈Tτ;
(2) radially ρ-unbounded, if for ρ(t, x) →+∞
v(t, x, w) →+∞
for all
t ∈Tτ
for all
τ ∈R.
For the measures ρ(t, x) and ρ0(t, x) taking values from the sets M
and M0 respectively the notions below are the generalizations of property
of Movchan’s metrices (cf. Movchan [1], and Lakshmikantham, Leela, and
Martynyuk [1]).

Deﬁnition 2.6.4 Let ρ0, ρ ∈M. We claim that
(1) the measure ρ(t, x) is continuous with respect to the measure ρ0(t, x),
if there exist a constant δ1 > 0 and a comparison function ϕ ∈CK
such that
ρ(t, x) < ϕ(t, ρ0(t, x))
whenever ρ0(t, x) < δ1;
(2) the measure ρ(t, x) is uniformly continuous with respect to the mea-
sure ρ0(t, x), if in deﬁnition (1) the comparison function ϕ ∈K,
i.e. ϕ does not depend on t;
(3) the measure ρ(t, x) is asymptotically continuous with respect to the
measure ρ0(t, x), if there exist a constant δ2 > 0 and a comparison
function ψ ∈KL such that
ρ(t, x) < ψ(t, ρ0(t, x))
whenever ρ0(t, x) < δ2.
We return now to the system (2.2.7) and assume that the operator (2.2.9)
is contractive for all (P, S) ∈P × S. The solution x(t; t0, x0) of system
(2.2.7) is designated by x(t) and its dependence on (P, S) ∈P ×S is taken
into account.
Deﬁnition 2.6.5 System (2.2.7) is
(1) (ρ0, ρ)-stable on P × S, if for every t0 ∈Ti and ε > 0 there exists
a positive function δ(t0, ε), continuous in t0 for each ε so that for
ρ0(t0, x0) < δ the inequality ρ(t, x(t)) < ε holds for all t ∈T0 and
all (P, S) ∈P × S;
(2) (ρ0, ρ)-attractive on P × S, if for any t0 ∈Ti and any ζ > 0
there exist ∆(t0) > 0 and τ = τ(t0, x0, ζ) ∈[0, +∞) such that
for ρ0(t0, x0) < ∆(t0) the inequality ρ(t, x(t)) < ζ holds for all
t ∈(t0 + τ, ∞) when all (P, S) ∈P × S;
(3) asymptotically (ρ0, ρ)-stable on P×S, if it is (ρ0, ρ)-stable on P×S
and (ρ0, ρ)-attractive on P × S.
The deﬁnitions of other types of dynamical properties of system (2.2.5)
with respect to two measures under nonclassical structural perturbations
can be formulated in terms of Deﬁnition 2.6.5 and the corresponding Deﬁ-
nitions 1.2.1 – 1.2.3.
2.6.1.2 Test for stability analysis
The application of matrix-valued Li-
apunov function and two measures allows one to extend the set of the
dynamical properties of the system under consideration which can be in-
vestigated by the Liapunov direct method. Moreover, it is possible to use
less strict assumptions on the components of auxiliary matrix-valued func-
tion.
Theorem 2.6.1 In system (2.2.7) let the vector-function Q be conti-
nuous on R × Ω× P × S. If
(1) the measures ρ0 and ρ are of class M;
(2) there exist a matrix-valued function U(t, x) and a vector w ∈Rm
such that v(t, x, w) ∈C(R×S×Rm, R+) and is locally Lipschitzian
in x;

(3) function v(t, x, w) satisﬁes the estimates
(a) a(ρ(t, x)) ≤v(t, x, w) ≤b(t, ρ0(t, x)) for all (t, x, w) ∈
S(ρ, H) × Rm or

(P, S) ∈P × S,
where e = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T∈Rm and Φ(P, S)= 1
2 (Φ(P, S)+ΦT(P, S));
(5) there exists a constant m × m matrix Φ such that Φ(P, S) ≤Φ for
all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Then
(1) system (2.2.7) is (ρ0, ρ)-stable on P ×S, if the matrix Φ is negative
semi-deﬁnite, the measure ρ is continuous with respect to measure
ρ0 and condition (3a) is satisﬁed;
(2) system (2.2.7) is uniformly (ρ0, ρ)-stable on P × S, if the matrix
Φ is negative semi-deﬁnite, the measure ρ is uniformly continuous
with respect to measure ρ0 and condition (3b) is satisﬁed.
Proof Note that the function v(t, x, w) determined by the formula (2.6.2)
is scalar pseudoquadratic with respect to w ∈Rm
+. Therefore the property
of having a ﬁxed sign of function (2.6.2) with respect to measure ρ does not
requre the ρ-signdeﬁniteness of elements uij(t, x) of matrix (2.6.1).

First we shall prove the assertion (1) of Theorem 2.6.1. Conditions (1),
(2) and (4a) imply that the function v(t, x, w) is weakly ρ0-decreasing.
Therefore there exists a constant ∆0 = ∆0(t0) > 0 for t0 ∈R such that
for ρ0(t0, x0) < ∆0
(2.6.6)
v(t0, x0, w) ≤b(t0, ρ0(t0, x0)).
Also, by condition (4a) there exists ∆1 ∈(0, H) such that
(2.6.7)
a(ρ(t, x)) ≤v(t, x, w)
for
ρ(t, x) ≤∆1.
The facf that the measure ρ is continuous with respect to the measure ρ0
yields the existence of a function ϕ ∈CK and a constant ∆2 = ∆2(t0) > 0
such that
(2.6.8)
ρ(t0, x0) ≤ϕ(t0, ρ0(t0, x0))
for
ρ0(t0, x0) < ∆2,
where ∆2 is taken so that
(2.6.9)
ϕ(t0, ∆2) < ∆1.
Let ε ∈(0, ∆0) and t0 ∈R . Since the functions a ∈K and b ∈CK,
given ε and t0, one can take ∆3 = ∆3(t0, ε) > 0 so that
(2.6.10)
b(t0, ∆3) < a(ε).
We take δ(t0) = min (∆1, ∆2, ∆3). Conditions (2.6.6) – (2.6.10) imply
that for ρ0(t0, x0) < δ
a(ρ(t0, x0)) ≤v(t0, x0, w) ≤b(t0, ρ0(t0, x0)) < a(ε),
from which it follows that
ρ(t0, x0) < ε.
Let x(t; t0, x0) = x(t) be a solution of system (2.2.7) with the initial
conditions for which ρ0(t0, x0) < δ. Let us verify that under conditions of
Theorem 2.6.1 the estimate
(2.6.11)
ρ(t, x(t)) < ε
for all
t ≥t0
and for all
(P, S) ∈P × S
holds true.
Assume that there exists t1 ≥t0 such that
ρ(t1, x(t)) = ε
and
ρ(t, x(t)) < ε,
t ∈[t0, t1),
for the solution x(t) with the initial conditions ρ0(t0, x0) < δ. Condition
(3) and the fact that the matrix Φ(P, S) is negative semi-deﬁnite in the
domain S(ρ, H) imply that the roots λi = λi(Φ(P, S)) of the equation
(2.6.12)
det [Φ −λE] = 0
satisfy the condition λi(Φ(P, S)) ≤0, i = 1, 2, . . ., m, in the domain
S(ρ, H). Therefore
D+v(t, x, w)|(2.2.7) ≤eTΦ(P, S)e ≤0

and for all t ∈[t0, t1] . Hence it follows that
a(ε) = a(ρ(t1, x(t1))) ≤v(t, x, w) ≤v(t0, x0, w)
≤b(t0, ρ0(t0, x0)) < a(ε).
The contradiction obtained shows that the assertion t1 ∈[t0, +∞) is false.
Consequently, system (2.2.7) is (ρ0, ρ)–stable on P × S.
The assertion (2) of Theorem 2.6.1 is proved in a similar manner. Be-
sides, it is taken into account that condition (4b) is satisﬁed and the measure
ρ is uniformly continuous with respect to the measure ρ0, and the value δ
can be taken independent of t0 ∈R (t0 ∈Tτ). Hence, system (2.2.7) is
uniformly (ρ0, ρ)–stable on P × S.
The assertion below is an analogue of the Liapunov’s theorem on asymp-
totic stability in the framework of stability investigation of system (2.2.7)
with respect to two measures.
Theorem 2.6.2 In system (2.2.7) let the vector-function Q be conti-
nuous on R+ × Ω× P × S. If
(1) the measures ρ0 and ρ are of class M;
(2) there exist a matrix-valued function U ∈C(R × S, Rm×m) and a
vector w ∈Rm
+ such that the function v(t, x, w) is locally Lipschitz-
ian in x and satisﬁes estimates
a(ρ(t, x)) ≤v(t, x, w) ≤c(ρ0(t, x))
for all (t, x, w) ∈S(ρ, H) × Rm
+ , where a, c ∈K;
(3) there exists a constant m × m–matrix B(P, S), such that
D+v(t, x, w) ≤uTB(P, S)u
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S
where uT = (ρ1/2
01 (t, x), . . . , ρ1/2
0m(t, x)) and ρ1/2
0s (t, x) = sρ1/2
0
(t, x),
s = 1, 2, . . ., m;
(4) there exists a constant m × m–matrix B such that
B(P, S) = 1
2 (B(P, S) + BT(P, S)) ≤B
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
Then system (2.2.7) is uniformly asymptotically (ρ0, ρ)–stable on P×S,
if the matrix B is negative deﬁnite and the measure ρ is uniformly conti-
nuous with respect to the measure ρ0.
Proof Condition (2) of Theorem 2.6.2 implies that for the function
v(t, x, w) = wTU(t, x)w,

Having compared the conditions of Theorem 2.6.1 and those of Theorem
2.6.2 we conclude that system (2.2.7) is uniformly (ρ0, ρ)–stable on P × S.
Hence it follows that for ε = H0 one can take ∆1 = ∆1(H0) so that the
inequality ρ(t, x(t)) < H0 holds true whenever ρ0(t0, x0) < ∆1 for any
solution x(t) = x(t; t0, x0) of system (2.2.7).
By condition (3) of Theorem (2.2.6) we have
(2.6.13)
D+v(t, x, w) ≤uTB(P, S)u ≤λM(B)uTu
= λM(B)

s=1
ρ0s(t, x)
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
Since the matrix B is symmetric and negative deﬁnite, λM(B) < 0. The
measure ρ0 is of class M, so there exists a function ψ ∈K such that
(2.6.14)
ψ(ρ0(t, x)) ≥
m

s=1
ρ0s(t, x).
Therefore
(2.6.15)
D+v(t, x, w) ≤−λM(B)ψ(ρ0(t, x))
for all (t, x, w) ∈S(ρ, H) × Rm
+ and for all (P, S) ∈P × S.

Further for arbitrary 0 < ε < H0 we take δ = δ(ε) being the same as in
the deﬁnition of uniform (ρ0, ρ)–stability. Assume that ρ0(t0, x0) < δ∗=
min {∆0, ∆1} and take
T (ε) =
b(δ∗)
λM(B)ψ(δ) + 1,
where λM(B) is the maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix B(w) and
the function ψ is of class K. We shall prove uniform asymptotic (ρ0, ρ)–
stability on P ×S of system (2.2.7), if we make sure that a t∗∈[t0, t0+T ]
exists such that
(2.6.16)
ρ0(t∗, x(t∗)) < δ.
If this is not true, then there exists a solution x(t) = x(t; t0, x0) of system
(2.2.7) with local values ρ0(t0, x0) < δ∗for which
(2.6.17)
ρ0(t, x(t)) ≥δ
for all
t∗∈[t0, t0 + T ].
We have from (2.6.16)
(2.6.18)
λM(B)
t0+T

t0
ψ(ρ0(s, x(s))) ds ≤v(t0, x0, w) ≤b(ρ0(t0, x0) ≤b(δ∗).
In view of (2.6.16) we have from (2.6.13)
(2.6.19)
λM(B)
t0+T

t0
ψ(ρ0(s, x(s))) ds ≥λm(B)ψ(δ)T > b(δ∗)
for the above choice of T . Inequality (2.6.19) contradicts inequality (2.6.18).
This proves Theorem 2.6.2.
Remark 2.6.1 The further development of stability theory of nonlinear
systems under nonclassical structural perturbations with respect to two
measures (ρ0, ρ) is associated with the construction of the matrix-valued
functions which satisfy the conditions of sign-deﬁniteness with respect to a
given measure. In the investigation of the dynamical properties of system
(2.2.7) it is reasonable to consider the following measures;
(1) in the investigation of stability of the state x = 0 in the sense of
Liapunov the two measures ρ0 and ρ are taken as follows: ρ(t, x) =
x and ρ0(t0, x0) = x0;
(2) in the investigation of stability of the prescribed motion x0(t) of
system (2.2.7) the two measures are taken as ρ(t, x) = ρ0(t, x) =
x −x0(t);
(3) in the stability investigation of the zero solution of system (2.2.7)
with respect to a part of variables the two measures are taken as
ρ(t, x) = xs, 1 ≤s < n, and ρ0(t, x) = x;
(4) if Ti = R, ρ(t, x) = ρ0(t, x) = x + σ(t), where σ is of class L,
then Deﬁnition 2.6.5 (a) characterizes stability of the asymptotically
invariant set {0};

(5) let A ⊂Rn, Ti = R and ρ(t, x) = ρ0(t, x) = d(x, A), where d(x, A)
is the distance from the set A to the point x. Then the two given
measures characterize stability of the invariant set A;
(6) let A ⊂B ⊂Rn, Ti = R and ρ(t, x) = d(x, B), ρ0(t, x) = d(x, A).
Then the two given measures characterize stability of the invariant
set B with respect to the set A;
(7) let the k-dimensional integral manifold M of system (2.2.7) contain
the point x = 0 and the vector-function Q(t, x, P, S) = 0 for x = 0,
and also Ti = R, ρ(t, x) = ρ0(t, x) = xn+k + d(x, M). Then
the two given measures are characteristics of conditional stability
of the state x = 0 of system (2.2.7) under nonclassical structural
perturbations;
(8) let system (2.2.7) have a periodic solution and C be a closed orbit
in the phase space. If ρ(t, x) = ρ0(t, x) = d(x, C) and Ti = R,
then the two given measures are characteristics of orbital stability
of the periodic motion under nonclassical structural perturbations.

Continuous Large-Scale Systems
According to Shaaban [1], Shaaban and Grujic [1], and Grujic, et al. [1],
pp. 341 – 345, an N-machine power system is decomposed into subsystems,
each consisting of two machines in addition to the comparison machine. The
system is decomposed into (N −1)/2 interconnected subsystems for odd
number N. When considering transfer conductances, mechanical damp-
ing, electromagnetic damping and speed governor action, the mathemati-
cal model of the system is derived, and it is decomposed into (N −1)/2
sixth-order and one second-order interconnected subsystems. If N is even,
then the system is decomposed into (N −2)/2 sixth-order, one third-order
and one second-order sybsystems.
In this section N is odd, without loss of generality. The system

is decomposed into (N −1)/2 interconnected subsystems, each consisting
of two machines and the comparison machine, using the triplewise decom-
position. It is to be noted that none of the system machines (except for the
comparison machine) can be included in more than one subsystem.
Now, by introducing the set JI = {iI, iI + 1} and deﬁning the state
vectors xI and xN as follows:
(2.6.21)
xI = [σiIN, σiI+1,N, ωiIN, ωiI+1,N, PiIN, PiI+1,N ]T
= [xI1, xI2, xI3, xI4, xI5, xI6]T,
xN = [ωN, PN ]T = [xN1, xN2]T,
we can decompose the system mathematical model
(2.6.22)
x = [σ1N, ω1, p1, σ2N, ω2, p2, . . . , σnN, ωn, pn, ωN, pN ]T
into s = (N −1)/2 sixth-order interconnected subsystems and the second-
order interconnected subsystem, which has the general form
(2.6.23)

and it can be decomposed into the free (disconnected) subsystems given by
(2.6.25)
dxI
dt = PIxI + BIfI(σI),
where
(2.6.26)
σI = CT
I xI
for
I = 1, 2, . . . , m
and the interconnections hI(x).
In (2.6.25), the matrices PI, BI and CT
I
are constant matrices, and
fI(σI) is a nonlinear vector function. Referring to (2.6.22), we can deﬁne
the matrix PI as

given by

For system (2.6.24) the problem of stability is formulated as follows.
Find the conditions under which stability of the equilibrium state x = 0
of system (2.6.30) is deduced from the stability properties of the free sub-
systems

constant matrices of the order of 5 × 5.
It is easy to verify that for the functions (2.6.41) the bilaterial inequalities

Continuous Large-Scale Systems
Theorem 2.6.3 For the large scale power system (2.6.24) let matrix-
valued function U(x) with elements (2.6.35) be constructed. If the matrix
HTQH is positive deﬁnite and the matrix C is negative deﬁnite, then the
equilibrium state x = 0 of system (2.6.24) is asymptotically stable under
nonclassical structural perturbations.
The Proof of this theorem follows immediately from the proof of Theo-
rem 2.4.1.
Remark 2.6.2 System (2.6.24) was studied earlier be means of the vector
Liapunov function. The comparison of results of the above monograph with
the approach based on the matrix-valued function shows that the aggrega-
tion matrices in both cases are of the same order. The diﬀerence between
the aggregation matrices is that in the determination of the diagonal ele-
ments of the aggregation matrix C the matrices
(2.6.41)
AJ
2I(S∗) + AJT
2I (S∗)
are added, while in the determination of non-diagonal elements the matrices
(2.6.42)
QIJPJP T
I QIJ + AJ
1I(S∗) + AJT
1I (S∗) + AJ
3I(S∗) + AJT
3I (S∗)
are required.
The matrices (2.6.41) and (2.6.42) appear because of the
presence of the functions
vIJ(xI, xJ) = xT
I QIJxJ,
I, J = 1, 2, . . ., m, I ̸= J. If we allow for the fact that QIJ are only sym-
metric positive deﬁnite matrices and QIJ (I ̸= J) are arbitrary constant
ones such that λm(HTQH) > 0, then one can “inﬂuence” the choice of
the matrix-valued function U(x) by choosing the matrices QIJ. This makes
possible to extend the classes of functions suitable for establishing the cri-
teria for construction of suﬃcient stability conditions for system (2.6.30).
Besides, the matrix C can be constructed so that the absolute values of the
diagonal elements will be maximally large while the non-diagonal elements
will be minimal. This fact allows to get more reﬁned results as compared
with those obtained by means of the vector Liapunov function. However
we note that for a large number of subsystems it becomes diﬃcult on the
analytical level to choose matrices QIJ (I ̸= J ) and to verify the property
of having a ﬁxed sign of the aggregation matrix C. In such a case it is
expedient to employ computer programmes in the direction.
2.6.3 Large-scale Lur’e-Postnikov systems
In this section for the
analysis of absolute stability under structural perturbations a special Li-
apunov function is constructed in terms of matrix-valued function. This
allows to obtain new suﬃcient conditions for structural absolute stability
of the equilibrium state of the system under consideration.

iixi, xi = (0T, 0T, . . . , 0T, xT

(2.5.5) hold.
Together with function (2.5.4) its total derivative

D+v(x, ψ) = ψTD+U(x)ψ
along solutions of system (2.6.43) is considered.
Proposition 2.6.2 If for system (2.6.43) the matrix-valued function

Basing on the obtained estimates for the matrix-valued function the
following result is stated.
Theorem 2.6.4 Let the motion equations of large-scale Lur’e system
(2.6.43) be such that for them the matrix-valued function (2.5.2) is con-
structed with elements (2.5.3) and for derivative (2.6.46) estimate (2.6.47)
is satisﬁed. If
(a) matrices A and B in estimate (2.5.5) are positive deﬁnite;
(b) matrix C in estimate (2.6.46) is negative deﬁnite on S,
then the equilibrium state
x
=
0
of system (2.6.43) is uniformly
asymptotically stable on S.
Moreover, if Nix = Rni, then the equilibrium state x = 0 of system
(2.6.43) is uniformly asymptotically stable in the whole on S.
Proof If estimates (2.5.5) are satisﬁed, then under condition (a) of The-
orem 2.6.4 the function (2.5.4) is positive deﬁnite and decreasing on Nix.
Estimate (2.6.47) and condition (b) of Theorem 2.6.4 imply that the ex-
pression D+v(x, ψ)|(2.6.43) is negative deﬁnite on Nx0 × S.
These conditions are suﬃcient for structural uniform asymptotic stability
of the equilibrium state x = 0 of system (2.6.43) on S.
In the case Nix = Rni function (2.5.4) is positive deﬁnite decreasing and
radially unbounded. This together with other conditions of the theorem
proves its second assertion.
Remark 2.6.1 Theorem 2.6.4 remains valid, if the matrix A is condition-
ally positive deﬁnite and the matrix C is conditionally negative deﬁnite.
Example 2.6.1 Let system (2.6.43) be the fourth-order system of Lur’e
type decomposed into two interconnected second order subsystems deﬁned
by the vectors and matrices

2.7 Notes and References
Section 2.1
Mathematical methods of investigation of continuous large scale
systems in the absence of structural perturbations are presented in the well-known
monographs. The known defects of the stability criteria obtained in terms of the
Liapunov vector functions (see Piontkovskii and Rutkovskaya [1], and Martynyuk
and Slyn’ko [1]) impelled many investigators to develop other approaches for
qualitative analysis of motions of large scale systems. The method of Liapunov
matrix-valued functions is one of them (for the details see Martynyuk [13, 17]).

In the description of the adopted model of nonclassical structural
perturbations we proceed from the fact that the architecture of complexity and/or
multidimensionness of a real system presumes the evolution from “simple” to
“complex” (see Simon [1], Levins [1], Bronowski [1], etc.) with the stable structure
on each hierarchical level. In other words, the dynamics of free subsystems (2.2.3)
is a prototype of the dynamical properties of the interacting subsystems (2.2.2)
and the whole system (C ). That is why system (2.2.5) and system (11) from
the monograph by Gruji´c, et al. [1], pp. 157 – 160, are similar in their form but
diﬀerent in their content.
Namely, system (2.2.5) is a result of mathematical
composition of the individual subsystems (2.2.3) for a given model of nonclassical
structural perturbations. For Remarks 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 see Grujic et al. [1].
Section 2.3
The estimates for the class of Liapunov functions applied in this
section were obtained by Martynyuk and Miladzhanov [1, 2]. In this section some
results of Krasovskii [1], and Djordjevi´c [1] were used.
Section 2.4
This section is based on the results by Martynyuk [6], Martynyuk and
Miladzhanov [1 – 3], Martynyuk and Stavroulakis [1, 2], and Miladzhanov [1, 2].
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 is based on some results of Liapunov [1], Chetaev [2], and Sil-
jak [1 – 3] (see and cf. Grujic et al. [1], pp. 160, and Martynyuk and Miladzha-
nov [1, 2]).
Section 2.5
The results of analysis of large scale linear system are new. Alongside
the results obtained in Section 2.4 some results by Djordjevi´c [1] are applied.
Section 2.6
The results of Sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.3 are new as referred to the
application of matrix-valued function and two measures in the investigation of
stability of nonlinear system under nonclassical structural perturbations. Some
results in the direction were presented in the paper by Martynyuk [8]. The anal-
ysis of stability with respect to two measures of nonlinear systems without struc-
tural perturbations in terms of matrix-valued function was carried out by Mar-
tynyuk and Chernienko [1]. The investigations of motion stability with respect
to two measures by means of scalar Liapunov function were summarized in the
monograph by Lakshmikantham, Leela, et al. [1], Lakshmikantham and Liu [1].
The mathematical model of energy system studied in Section 2.6.2 was investi-
gated earlier by means of scalar (see Ribbens-Pavella [1, 2]) and vector Liapunov
functions (see Grujic et al. [1], Voronov and Matrosov [1], etc.). The results ob-
tained via the application of matrix-valued function in the investigation of this
model are presented according to Martynyuk and Miladzhanov [7].
The results for large-scale Lur’e-Postnikov systems under nonclassical struc-
tural perturbations are new.

DISCRETE-TIME LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS
3.1 Introduction
An important place in the investigation of stability of discrete systems
belongs to the Liapunov direct method, which is a natural generalization of
the Liapunov direct method for continuous systems. Various generalizations
of the Liapunov method for large scale discrete-time systems are based on
the use of a scalar, vector or auxiliary matrix-valued function
The aim of Chapter 3 is to establish tests for the stability of an equi-
librium state of large scale discrete-time systems under nonclassical struc-
tural perturbations by using the matrix-valued Liapunov function. As in
the continuous case (see Chapter 2) we consider two general statements of
the problem, i.e. Problem DA and Problem DB.
The presentation of the main results of the chapter is arranged as follows:
Section 3.2 provides a description of the composition of large scale dis-
crete system for the given connectedness model.
Section 3.3 deals with a description of the classes of matrix-valued func-
tions applied in the investigation of stability-like properties of discrete sys-
tems. Also general theorems on stability under nonclassical structural per-
turbations in terms of existence of auxiliary matrix-valued function are
presented here.

In Section 3.4 various suﬃcient stability conditions are set out for the
system of equations under consideration within the framework of solution
of Problems DA and DB.
In Section 3.5 the eﬃciency of the applied approaches is analysed; the
approaches are based on three classes of auxiliary Liapunov functions in
the estimation of robustness boundary of uncertain linear system.
It is
shown that the application of the heirarchical Liapunov functions yields
the widest estimates for the norms of the matrices describing uncertainties
in dynamical system.
3.2 Nonclassical Structural Perturbations in Discrete-Time
Systems
The object of investigation in this chapter are the models of real systems
and/or processes whose mathematical description is made by the systems of
the ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerence equations under nonclassical structural
and/or parametric perturbations. For the class of systems (subsystems)
under consideration the notations D and Di are used respectively and the
following hypotheses are adopted.
H1. The time-discrete system D consists of m interacting subsystems
Di, each of the subsystems is described by the subsystem of the ﬁrst order
ordinary diﬀerence equations whose order is not changed on the interval of
motion investigation of this system.
H2. Parametric and/or external perturbations of system D are charac-
terized by the matrix P = (pT
1, pT
2, . . . , pT
m)T ∈Rm×q as in the continuous
case. The set of all the matrices addmissible for the given system is desig-
nated by
(3.2.1)
P = {P : P1 ≤P(τ) ≤P2, τ ∈N +
τ }.
Here P1 and P2 are the prescribed constant matrices.
H3. The family F of vector-mappings (f 1, f 2, . . . , f N) is determined,
f k : N +
τ × Rn × Rs×q →Rn, where N is a real number, f k
i : N +
τ × Rn ×
R1×q →Rni, for all k = 1, 2, . . . , N, i = 1, 2, . . ., m, n1+n2+· · ·+nm = n.
H4. The dynamics of the i-th interconnected subsystem Di in system D
is described by the ﬁnite-dimentional ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerence equa-
tions
(3.2.2)
xi(τ + 1) = fi(τ, x(τ), pi),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
where xi ∈Rni, fi ∈Fi = {f 1
i , f 2
i , . . . , f N
i }, x = (xT
1, xT
2, . . . , xT
i , . . . , xT
m)T.
It is assumed that fi(τ, 0, 0) = 0 for all τ ∈N +
τ .
The number N in the deﬁnition of the families F and Fi, i = 1, 2, . . ., m,
and the variations of the exponent k = k(τ) on the set N = {1, . . . , N},
k(τ) ∈N for all τ ∈N +
τ , describe structural changes in system (3.2.2).
H5.
The dynamics of the i-th isolated subsystem Di in system D is
described by the ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerence equations
(3.2.3)
xi(τ + 1) = gi(τ, xi),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,

where xi ∈Rni, and the functions gi : N +
τ × Rni →Rni are determined
by the correlations
gi(τ, xi) = fi(τ, xi, 0),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
It is assumed that gi(τ, 0) = 0 for all τ ∈N.
Similarly to Section 2.2 the dynamics of the whole system D can be
described in terms of systems (3.2.2) and (3.2.3) by the systems of the ﬁrst
order ordinary diﬀerence equations
(3.2.4)
xi(τ + 1) = gi(τ, xi) + Si(τ)hi(τ, x, pi),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
where Si(τ) is a structural matrix of the i-the subsystem Si : N +
τ
→
Rni×Nni, hi : N +
τ × Rn × R1×q →RNni.
Setting
g = (gT
1, . . . , gT
m)T,
h = (hT
1, . . . , hT
n)T
and taking into account the designations from Section 2.2, one can present
system (3.2.4) in the vector form
(3.2.5)
x(τ + 1) = g(τ, x(τ)) + S(τ)h(τ, x(τ), P),
where x ∈Rn, g: N +
τ × Rn →Rn, h: N +
τ × Rn × Rm×q →Rn, S(τ) is
the structural matrix of system D.
Further we assume that the system (3.2.5) satisﬁes the existence and
uniqueness conditions for a solution x(τ; x0, t0) of equation (3.2.1) for any
x0 ∈Rn, t0 ≥0, and τ ∈N +. Moreover, x(t0; x0, t0) = x0.
Assume that g(τ, x(τ)) = 0 for all τ ∈N + and P ∈P if and only
if x(τ) = xe, i.e. the state x(τ) = xe is the unique equilibrium state of
system (3.2.5).
Remark 3.2.1 The discrete analogue of system of diﬀerential inequalities
(2.2.10) for system (3.2.5) is the system of diﬀerence inequalities of the form
(3.2.6)
T m(τ, x(τ), P1, S) ≤x(τ + 1) ≤T M(τ, x(τ), P2, S).
Here T (τ, x(τ), P, S) = g(τ, x(τ)) + S(τ)h(τ, x(τ), p),
T m : N +
τ × Rn ×
Rm×q × S →Rn, T M : N +
τ × Rn × Rm×q × S →Rn, τ ∈N +
τ .
By deﬁnition of the set P for all (τ, x, P, S) ∈N +
τ × Rn × P × S the
ineqiality
T m(τ, x(τ), P1, S) ≤T M(τ, x(τ), P2, S).
is fulﬁlled.
The vector-function χ(τ) determined on N +
τ0 = [τ0, +∞) ∩N +
τ
is called
the solution of inequality (3.2.6), if
T m(τ, χ(τ), P1, S) ≤χ(τ + 1) ≤T M(τ, χ(τ), P2, S)
for all τ ∈N +
τ .
Since
T m(τ, x(τ), P1, S) ≤T (τ, x(τ), P, S) ≤T M(τ, x(τ), P2, S)
for all (τ, x, P, S) ∈N +
τ × Rn × P × S, every solution of system (3.2.5) is
the solution of inequality (3.2.6).

3.3 Liapunov’s Matrix-Valued Functions
The properties of the stability of discrete-time systems under nonclassical
structural perturbations can be determined in accordance with the deﬁni-
tions from Sections 1.2 and 2.2.
The solution of the problem concerning the stability of a large scale
discrete-time system under nonclassical structural perturbations is based
on the natural extension of the theory of the Liapunov direct method on
the basis of the matrix-valued function.
Therefore, along with system (3.2.5) we consider the matrix-valued func-
tion
(3.3.1)
U(τ, x(τ)) = [vij(τ, x(τ))],
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m,
which we use to construct the function of class SL (see Section 1.2)
(3.3.2)
v(τ, x(τ), ψ) = ψTU(τ, x(τ))ψ,
where ψ = (ψ1, ψ2, . . . , ψm)T, ψi = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
We note that if ψ = J = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T ∈Rm, the function (3.3.2) be-
comes
(3.3.3)
v(τ, x(τ)) =
m

i,j=1
vij(τ, x(τ)).
For the ﬁrst diﬀerences of the matrix-valued function (3.3.1) and scalar
function (3.3.2) along the solutions of system (3.2.5) we introduce the no-
tation
∆U(τ, x(τ)) = [∆vij(τ, x(τ))],
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m,
(3.3.4)
∆v(τ, x(τ)) = ψT∆U(τ, x(τ))ψ,
(3.3.5)
where the ﬁrst diﬀerences of the functions vij(τ, x(τ)) relative to (τ, x(τ)) ∈
N +
τ × N are determined in accordance with Section 1.3.
Deﬁnition 3.3.1 The matrix-valued function U : N +
τ × Rn →Rm×m
is called
(1) Liapunov matrix function (LMF) of the S(ψ) type if
(a) the MF U(τ, x(τ)) is positive deﬁnite and decreases on N +
τ ×N;
(b) the MF ∆U(τ, x(τ)) is nonpositive on N +
τ ×N, for any (P, S) ∈
P × S and ∆U(τ, 0) = 0 for all τ ∈N +
τ ;
(2) an LMF of the AS(ψ) type if
(a) the MF U(τ, x(τ)) is positive deﬁnite and decreases on N +
τ ×N;
(b) the MF ∆U(τ, x(τ)) is positive deﬁnite on N + × N, for any
(P, S) ∈P × S and ∆U(τ, 0) = 0 for all τ ∈N +
τ ;
(3) an LMF of the NS(ψ) type if
(a) the MF U(τ, x(τ)) is positive and bounded in the domain
v(τ, x(τ), ψ) > 0;
(b) the MF ∆U(τ, x(τ)) for all τ ∈N +
τ
is positive deﬁnite in the
domain v(τ, x(τ), ψ) > 0 for at least one pair (P, S) ∈P × S
and ∆U(τ, 0) = 0 for all τ ∈N +
τ .
Theorems on the stability of discrete-time systems on the basis of the
matrix-valued function (3.3.1) and its ﬁrst diﬀerence (3.3.4) – (3.3.5) are
generalized in the following form.

Theorem 3.3.1 For the state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5) to be stable
(uniformly) on P ×S it is suﬃcient that matrix-valued function U : N +
τ ×
N →Rm×m of the S(ψ) type to exist for any natural m.
Proof When the conditions of Theorem 3.3.1 are satisﬁed, so are the
inequalities
v(τ, x(τ), ψ) > 0
and
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≤0
for x ∈Bη = {x ∈Rn : x < η} and for (P, S) ∈P × S.
Suppose that ε ∈(0, η) is given. We denote l = min {v(τ, x(τ), ψ):
x = ε}. The quantity l is positive, as the minimum of a positive function
on a compact set, that function being continuous in discrete time. Suppose
that G = {x ∈Rn : v(τ, x(τ), ψ) < l/2} and G0 is a bound subset of G,
containing x = 0. Clearly, the sets G and G0 are open. If x0 ∈G0, then
∆v(τ, x0, ψ) ≤0
for any
(P, S) ∈P × S
and
v(τ + 1, x(τ + 1), ψ) ≤v(τ, x0, ψ) ≤l
2
and, therefore, x0 ∈G. Since v(τ, x(τ), ψ) is a continuous function, there
exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ ⊂G0. Therefore, if x0 ∈Bδ, then x0 ∈G
and x(τ; t0, x0) ∈G0 ⊂Bε, for any (P, S) ∈P × S. The theorem has thus
been proved.

Theorem 3.3.2 For the state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5) to be asymp-
totically stable (uniformly) on P × S it is suﬃcient that a matrix-valued
function U : N +
τ ×N →Rs×s of the AS(ψ) type to exist for any natural m.
Proof Since all the conditions of Theorem 3.3.1 are satisﬁed, the state
x(τ) = 0 is stable for any (P, S) ∈P × S. From the fact that the matrix-
valued function U(τ, x(τ)) is a function of class AS(ψ) it follows that
there exist functions χk ∈K for every k = 1, 2, . . ., m, and matrices
G(P, S) ∈P × S (λmax(G) < 0) such that
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≤χT(x(τ))Gχ(x(τ)),
or
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≤−λmin(G)χT(x(τ))χ(x(τ)),
for all (P, S) ∈P ×S, where χ(x(τ)) = (χ1(x(τ)), . . . , χm(x(τ)))T.
Since χk ∈K, there exists a function Φ ∈K such that
Φ(x(τ)) ≥χT(x(τ))χ(x(τ))
and, therefore,
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≤−λmax(G)Φ(x(τ)),
x(τ) = 0,
for all x(τ) ∈Bε and all (P, S) ∈P × S. Therefore, the equilibrium state
x(τ) = 0 is uniformly asymptotically stable on P × S.
Theorem 3.3.3 For the state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5) to be unstable
on P×S it is suﬃcient for a matrix-valued function U : N +
τ ×N →Rm×m
of the NS(ψ) type to exist for any natural m.
Proof Suppose that a matrix-valued function of the NS(ψ) type exists
for system (3.2.5). We shall prove that then the zero solution of system
(3.2.5) is unstable. We conduct the proof by contradiction. Suppose that
the state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5) is stable. We choose the quantity
ε > 0 such that for the function
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) = ψT∆U(τ, x(τ))ψ
with x ∈Bε = {x ∈Rn : x < ε} \ {0} in the domain v(τ, x(τ), ψ) > 0
the inequality
(3.3.6)
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≥αT(x(τ))Hα(x(τ)),
is satisﬁed; here αT(x(τ)) = (α1(x(τ)), . . . , αm(x(τ))) and H(P, S) ≥
H, H is m × m matrix and λmin(H) ≥0 for at least one pair (P, S) ∈
P × S. Here αk ∈K for every k = 1, 2, . . ., m.
Since the functions αk ∈K, there exists a function κ ∈K:
κ(x(τ)) ≤αT(x(τ))α(x(τ))
such that
(3.3.7)
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≥λmin(H)κ(x(τ)),
in the domain v(τ, x(τ), ψ) > 0.

Discrete-Time Large-Scale Systems
According to the assumption that the state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5)
is stable on P × S for any ε > 0 we can prove that δ = δ(ε) > 0 so that
x0 ∈Bδ = {x ∈Rn : x < δ}, then x(τ; t0, x0) ∈Bε for all τ ∈N +
τ
and
all (P, S) ∈P × S. For a matrix-valued function of the NS(ψ) type there
exists a x0 ∈Bδ such that v(τ, x0, ψ) > 0. Then x(τ; t0, x0) is bounded
and remains in Bε for all τ ∈N +
τ , then x(τ; t0, x0) tends to the state
(x = 0) ∈{x ∈Rn : ∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) = 0} ∪Bε. It thus follows that
v(τ, x(τ; t0, x0), ψ) →v(t0, 0, ψ) = 0,
for
(ψ = 0).
On the other hand, according to (3.3.7)
∆v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≥0
and
v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≥0.
Therefore,
0 < v(t0, x0, ψ) ≤· · · ≤v(τ −1, x(τ −1), ψ) ≤v(τ, x(τ), ψ).
The contradiction that has been obtained shows that the statement of
Theorem 3.3.3 holds, as was to be proved.
3.4 Tests for Stability Analysis
The Problem DA is a natural generalization of the Problem CA for the class
of the multidimensional discrete-time systems.
3.4.1 The Problem DA
Assume that the time-discrete system D is
obtained in result of decomposition of the isolated subsystems (3.2.3) and
the corresponding interacting subsystems (3.2.2). It is required to obtain
stability conditions of diﬀerent types for the state x = 0 of system (3.2.5)
for the known dynamical properties of subsystems (3.2.3) and qualitative
properties of the interconnection functions between the subsystems.
Let us introduce some assumptions about the components vij of the
matrix-valued function U(τ, x(τ)) and dynamical properties of the subsys-
tem Di.
Assumption 3.4.1 There exist
(1) neighborhoods Ni ⊆Rni, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, of equilibrium states
xi(τ) = 0 invariant in discrete time;
(2) functions ϕik : Ni →R+, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, k = 1, 2, ϕik ∈K(KR);
(3) constants αij, αij, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m, and a matrix-valued function
U(τ, x(τ)) with the elements
vii = vii(τ, xi(τ)),
vij = vij(τ, xi(τ), xj(τ)),
i = j,
vij = vji,

(3.2.4).

Theorem 3.4.1 Suppose that the multidimensional discrete system
(3.2.5) is such that all conditions of Assumptions 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 are satis-
ﬁed and, in addition,
(1) the matrix A is positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a negative semi-deﬁnite matrix G ∈Rm×m such that
the matrix C(P, S) satisﬁes the estimate
1
2 (C(P, S) + CT(P, S)) ≤G
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5) is uniformly stable
on P × S.
Proof If the conditions of Assumption 3.4.1, Proposition 3.4.1, and con-
dition (1) of Theorem 3.4.1 are satisﬁed, then function (3.3.2) is posi-
tive deﬁnite on N +
τ × Ni0. The conditions of Assumption 3.4.2, Propo-
sition 3.4.2, and condition (2) of Theorem 3.4.1 imply that v(τ, x(τ), ψ) ≥
v(τ, x(τ + 1), ψ) for any (P, S) ∈P × S.
In this case, for every pair
(P, S) ∈P × S, the conditions which are suﬃcient for the stability of the
zero solution of the multidimensional discrete system (3.2.5) on P × S are
satisﬁed (see Section 1.3).
Theorem 3.4.2 Let the multidimensional discrete system (3.2.5) be
such that the conditions of Assumptions 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 are satisﬁed and,
in addition,
(1) the matrices A and B are positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a negative deﬁnite matrix G1 ∈Rm×m such that the
matrix C(P, S) satisﬁes the estimate
1
2 (C(P, S) + CT(P, S)) ≤G1
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x(τ) = 0 of system (3.2.5) is uniformly asymp-
totically stable on P × S.
The proof of Theorem 3.4.2 is similar to that of Theorem 3.4.1.
Example 3.4.1 Consider a linear large scale discrete-time system decom-
posed into two subsystems
(3.4.3)
xi(τ + 1) = Aiixi(τ) + Aijsijxj(τ),
i = j,
i, j = 1, 2,
where Aij are constant matrices of the corresponding order,
S = {S : S = diag {S1, S2}, Si = [sijJi], 0 ≤sij ≤1, i = j, i, j = 1, 2},
Ji = diag (1, 1) ∈Rni,
xi ∈Rni,
i = 1, 2,
and
x = (xT
1, xT
2)T ∈Rn.
For system (3.4.3) we construct a matrix-valued function U(x) with the
elements
(3.4.4)
v11 = xT
1B1x1,
v22 = xT
2B2x2,
v12 = v21 = xT
1B3x2,
where B1 and B2 are symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices, and B3 is a
constant matrix.
It is easy to verify that functions (3.4.4) satisfy the following estimates:
λm(Bi)xi2 ≤νii(xi(τ)) ≤λM(Bi)xi2,
i = 1, 2,
−λ1/2
M (B3BT

where λm(Bi) are, respectively, the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of
the matrices Bi, i = 1, 2, and λ1/2
M (B3BT
3 ) is the norm of the matrix B3.
In this case, the matrices A and B from estimate (3.4.1) have the form
A =

.
In order that these matrices be positive deﬁnite, it is suﬃcient that the
condition
(3.4.5)
λm(B1)λm(B2) > λ1/2
M (B3BT
3 )
be satisﬁed. Since the matrices B1 and B2 are positive deﬁnite, we have
λM(Bi) > λm(Bi) > 0, i = 1, 2.
Let ψT = (1, 1). Then for the matrix-valued function U(x) indicated
above, the elements of the matrix C(S) have the form
C11(S) = λM(C1) + λM(C3(S)),
C22(S) = λM(C2) + λM(C4(S)),

conditions of Theorem 3.4.1 (3.4.2) are satisﬁed and the zero solution of the
large scale discrete-time system (3.4.3) is stable (asymptotically stable).
3.4.2 The Problem DB
In this section we propose the solution of the
problem of nonlinear dynamics of discrete-time systems.
Problem DB
Assume that the discrete-time system D is obtained in re-
sult of composition of the interconnected subsystems (3.2.2). It is required
to determine stability conditions of diﬀerent types for the equilibrium state
x = 0 of system (3.2.5) in terms of the dynamical properties of the intercon-
nected subsystems (3.2.4) without additional information on the dynamical
properties of the isolated subsystems (3.2.3).
Assumption 3.4.3 Assume that
(1) conditions (1) and (2) of Assumption 3.4.2 are satisﬁed;
(2) there exist constants ρii(P, S) and ρij(P, S), i = 1, 2, . . ., m, j =
2, 3, . . ., m, i < j, such that, by virtue of the multidimensional
discrete system (3.2.5), the following inequality holds:

then the ﬁrst diﬀerence of the function v(τ, x(τ)) satisﬁes the following
estimate:

Theorem 3.4.3 Let the multidimensional discrete system (3.2.5) be
such that the conditions of Assumptions 3.4.1 and 3.4.3 are satisﬁed and,
in addition,
(1) the matrix A is positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a negative semi-deﬁnite matrix G ∈Rm×m such that
the matrix C(P, S) satisﬁes the estimate 1
2 (C(P, S) + CT(S)) ≤G
for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x(τ) = 0 of the multidimensional discrete sys-
tem (3.2.5) is uniformly stable on P × S.
The proof of Theorem 3.4.3 is similar to that of Theorem 3.4.1.
Theorem 3.4.4 Let the multidimensional discrete system (3.2.5) be
such that the conditions of Assumptions 3.4.1 and 3.4.3 are satisﬁed and,
in addition,
(1) the matrices A and B are positive deﬁnite;
(2) there exists a negative deﬁnite matrix
G1 ∈Rm×m such that the
matrix C(P, S) satisﬁes the estimate 1
2 (C(P, S) + CT(P, S)) ≤G1
for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Then the equilibrium state x(τ) = 0 of the multidimensional discrete sys-
tem (3.2.5) is uniformly asymptotically stable on P × S.
The proof of Theorem 3.4.4 is similar to that of Theorem 3.4.2.
Example 3.4.2 Consider the linear multidimensional discrete system
(3.4.3).
Assume that, for system (3.4.3), the matrix function with ele-
ments (3.4.4) is constructed and ψT = (1, 1). Then the elements of the
matrix C(S) have the form
ρ11(S) = λm(C1(S)),
ρ22(S) = λM(C2(S)),
ρ11(S) = λ1/2
M (C3(S)CT
3 (S)),
where
C1(S) = AT
11B1A11 + (A21s21)TB2A21s21 + 2AT
11B3A21s21 −2B1,
C2(S) = AT
22B2A22 + (A12s12)TB1A12s12 + 2(A12s12)TB3A22 −2B2,
C3(S) = AT
11B3A22 + (A21s21)TBT
3A12s12 −B3.
Thus, if, for system (3.4.3), the matrix function with elements (3.4.4)
is constructed, inequality (3.4.5) is satisﬁed, and, in addition, there exists
a negative semi-deﬁnite (negative deﬁnite) matrix G such that 1
2 (C(S) +
CT(S)) ≤G for all S ∈S, then the conditions of Theorem 3.4.3 (3.4.4)
are satisﬁed and the zero solution of the multidimensional discrete system
(3.4.3) is stable (asymptotically stable) on P × S.
Example 3.4.3 Consider a discrete system of the fourth order which
consists of two subsystems of the second order described by the following
systems of equations

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

is negative deﬁnite.
Since the conditions of Theorem 3.4.4 are satisﬁed, the zero solution of
system (3.4.7) is asymptotically stable on S.
In conclusion, note that the construction of a scalar Liapunov function
for the multidimensional discrete system (3.2.5) is an important and dif-
ﬁcult problem in the theory of discrete systems. The application of the
matrix-valued function U(τ, x(τ)) to the construction of the scalar func-
tion v(τ, x(τ), ψ) simpliﬁes the problem to a certain extent due to weakened
requirements on the components vij, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. This, in turn, en-
ables one to more adequately take into account the correlation between the
independent subsystems (3.2.3).
We emphasize that the suggested method for the analysis of the stability
of the multidimensional discrete system (3.2.5) is distinguished by its sim-
plicity and generality, and all established suﬃcient conditions of stability
and asymptotic stability are represented in terms of the property of special
matrices to have a ﬁxed sign.
3.5 Certain Trends of Generalizations and Applications
In this section we presents the results of estimating the robust stability
bounds for discrete-time system in terms of three approaches based on
scalar, vector and hierarchical Liapunov functions. It is shown that the
hierarchical Liapunov function allows one to obtain the most wide bounds
for the uncertain matrix in the investigation of discrete system.
We consider an uncertain discrete-time system
(3.5.1)
x(τ + 1) = A x(τ) + f(x(τ), α),
where x ∈Rn, τ ∈Tτ = {t0 + k, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .}, t0 ∈R, A is a constant
n × n matrix, f : Rn × S →Rn, S ⊆Rd is a compact set. Under speciﬁc
conditions (we don’t cite them here) dynamics of the system (3.5.1) is
topologically equivalent to dynamics of the system
(3.5.2)
x(τ + 1) = (A + E) x(τ),
where A is the same matrix, as in system (3.5.1), E is an uncertain n × n
matrix, about which it is known that it lies in some compact set S1 ⊂Rn×n.
Further we will investigate the system (3.5.2).

Discrete-Time Large-Scale Systems
Our purpose is to compare the results of estimating the robust bounds of
discrete system obtained in terms of three approaches involving scalar, vec-
tor and hierarchical Liapunov function. In the section it is shown that the
hierarchical Liapunov function provides more wide bounds for estimation
of the uncertain matrix.
3.5.1 Scalar approach
We assume that for the matrix A the condition
|σi(A)| < 1 is realized for all i = 1, 2, . . ., n. In this case the Liapunov
equation
(3.5.3)
ATPA −P = −G
has a unique solution P ∈Rn×n for arbitrary symmetric and positive
deﬁnite matrix G ∈Rn×n. In this case the matrix P is symmetric and
positive deﬁnite. According to the results of Sezer and Siljak [1], we apply
the function
(3.5.4)
v(x) = (xTPx)1/2.
in robustness analysis of the system (3.5.2). Let us denote by σm(P) and
σM(P) the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix P.
Following Sezer and Siljak [1] we have the following.
Theorem 3.5.1 Let the nominal system
(3.5.5)
x(τ + 1) = Ax(τ)
be asymptotically stable. If
(3.5.6)
E < µ(G),
where
µ(G) =
σm(G)
σ1/2
M (P −G)σ1/2
M (P) + σM(P)
,
then the uncertain system (3.5.2) is asymptotically stable.
Here E =
sup
x≤1
Ex, x = (xTx)1/2 is the Euclidean norm of
vector x.
It is known (see Sezer and ˇSiljak [1]), that µ(G) takes the largest value,
if G = I . The expression (3.5.6) is a robust bound for the system (3.5.2),
obtained in the framework of scalar approach.
3.5.2 Vector approach
We decompose system (3.5.2) into two intercon-
nected subsystems
(3.5.7)
Si :
xi(τ + 1) = (Ai + Ei)xi(τ) + (Bj + Uj)xj(τ),
i, j = 1, 2,
i = j.

where Pi are solutions of the Liapunov matrix equations (3.5.11) for the
matrices Gi = Ini, i = 1, 2.
Theorem 3.5.2 Assume that for the uncertain system (3.5.2) the de-
composition (3.5.7) – (3.5.9) takes place and all conditions of Assumption
3.1 are satisﬁed. If the submatrices Ei and Ui satisfy the inequalities
(3.5.13)
Ei ≤(1 −γ)µi,
Ui < ε,
i = 1, 2,
then the equilibrium x = 0 of (3.5.2) is asymptotically stable.
Proof For the nominal subsystems (3.5.10) by (3.5.11) we construct the
norm-like functions
(3.5.14)
vi(xi) = (xT

i = 1, 2,
and the scalar function
(3.5.15)
v(x) = d1v1(x1) + d2v2(x2),
where d1 and d2 are some positive constants.
For the ﬁrst diﬀerences ∆vi(xi) of the functions (3.5.14) along the so-
lutions of (3.5.7) we have the estimates:
∆vi(xi)
 ˆSi= vi(Aixi) −vi(xi) + vi((Ai + Ei)xi) −vi(Aixi)

Here we use the known inequality (see Sezer and Siljak [1])
(pTPp)1/2 −(qTPq)1/2 ≤σ1/2
M (P)p −q
for all p, q ∈Rn, P ∈Rn×n is a symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrix.

and therefore −aε2 −bε + c = 0, and w11w22 −w12w21 > 0.
It is clear that the function (3.5.15) is positive deﬁnite and its ﬁrst dif-
ference (3.5.16) is negative deﬁnite. These conditions are suﬃcient for the
asymptotic stability of the equilibrium x = 0 of (3.5..2). The proof of
Theorem 3.5.2 is complete.
Thus the inequalities (3.5.13) are the robust bounds for the system
(3.5.2), obtained in terms of the vector approach.
3.5.3 Hierarchical approach
As is known (see Ikeda and Siljak [1]),
the essence of this method is as follows: starting from the constructing an
auxiliary Liapunov function, we take into account a hierarchical structure
of the system (3.5.2) or realize a multilevel decomposition of the initial
system. Further the second approach is applied precisely.
We decompose each subsystems (3.5.7) into two interconnected compo-
nents
(3.5.17)

xij(τ + 1) = (Aij + Eij) xij(τ) + (Bij + Uij) xik(τ),

Cij :
xij(τ + 1) = (Aij + Eij) xij(τ),
i, j = 1, 2,
with the same designations of variables as in system (3.5.17).
In order to state the robust bounds we require the following assumptions.
Assumption 3.5.2 The nominal components
(3.5.20)
xij(τ + 1) = Aijxij(τ),
i, j = 1, 2,
are asymptotically stable, i.e. there exist unique symmetric and positive
deﬁnite matrices Pij, which satisfy the Liapunov matrix equations

i, j = 1, 2,
where Gij are arbitrary symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrices.

by formula
vi(xi) = di1vi1(xi1) + di2vi2(xi2),

Further we need the following proposition.
Proposition 3.5.1 We assume that
(1) discrete system (3.5.2) is decomposed on the ﬁrst level to the sys-
tem (3.5.7) and on the second level to the systems (3.5.17);
(2) all conditions of Assumptions 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 are satisﬁed;
(3) for the submatrices Eij, Uij of the matrices Ei, i = 1, 2, the esti-
mates

are realized.
Then there exist vectors ˆd1, ˆd2 ∈R2 with positive components such that the

and the matrices Wi are the M-matrices.
Here ˆdi = (di1, di2)T, zi = (xi1, xi2)T.
The proof of Proposition 3.5.1 is analogous to that of Theorem 3.5.1.
Under the hypotheses of Proposition 3.5.1 the matrices Wi are the
M-matrices and, according to Siljak [4], the vectors ˆdT

(3.5.31) is the M-matrix. Thus the matrices W1, W2, W are the M-matrices
and it is suﬃcient for asymptotic stability of the system (3.5.2).
3.5.4 Discussion and some examples
The hierarchical approach in
robust stability problem permits a more complete allowance for the dynamic
characteristics of the nominal system on each hierarchical level and thus a
more exact deﬁnition of robust bounds for the system (3.5.2). We illustrate
eﬃciency of the approach proposed in the Section by a simple example.
Let us assume that in the system (3.5.2) the matrix A has the form
(3.5.32)
A =

3.5.4.1 Scalar approach
Let us compute the matrices and constants oc-
curring in the framework of the scalar approach (see Theorem 3.5.1):

σ(P) ≈1.340176;
σM(P −I) ≈0.340176;
µ ≈0.496185.
Here I is a 4 × 4 - unit matrix. From here the robust bound for the sys-
tem (3.5.2) with the matrix (3.5.32) is determined by the inequality
(3.5.33)
E < 0.496185
for all matrices E ∈S.
3.5.4.2 Vector approach
According to this approach we decompose the
matrix (3.5.32) and denote
A1 =

The uncertain matrix E is represented in the form (3.5.9). The matrices
and constants occurring in the framework of vector approach are:
P1 ≈

σM(P1) ≈1.333807,
σM(P2) ≈1.066780,
µ1 ≈0.449733,
µ2 ≈0.749800.
Hence we have the estimates of submatrices norms in the form
(3.5.34) E1 ≤0.499733(1 −γ),
E2 ≤0.749800(1 −γ),
γ ∈(0, 1).
Let γ = 0.25. Besides ε ≈0.012303. Finally, for the matrix E represented
in the form (3.5.9), we get the estimates:
(3.5.35)
E1 ≤0.374800,
E2 ≤0.562350,
Ui < 0.012303,
i = 1, 2.
For example the matrix
E = diag {0.37, 0.37, 0.56, 0.56}
satisﬁes the inequalities (3.5.35). But  E = 0.56, and consequently, the
norm of uncertain matrix E does not satisfy the inequality (3.5.33).
3.5.4.3 Hierarchical approach
According to the proposed algorithm we
accomplish the two-level decomposition of system (3.5.2) with the ma-
trix (3.5.32) and as a result we get:
A11 = 0.5,
A12 = 0.125,
A21 = 0.25,
A22 = 0.125.
Let
γ1 = 0.5,
γ2 = 0.125.

Numerical values of the corresponding constants are:

σM(P12) ≈1.015873,
µ11 = 0.5,
µ12 = 0.875,
σM(P21) ≈1.066666,

µ21 = 0.75,
µ22 = 0.875,
ε1 ≈0.320718,
ε2 ≈0.096261.
We shall set ε1 = 0.05, and ε2 = 0.006. In this case for the matrices W1
and W2 we get the expressions
W1 ≈

W2 ≈

.
The matrices W1 and W2 are the M-matrices as their non-diagonal ele-
ments are negative and their principal minors are positive.
The constant m is computed by the formula (3.5.26): m ≈0.038392.
Thus, the following restrictions are imposed on submatrices of E:
(3.5.36)
E11 ≤0.25,
E12 ≤0.4375,
E21 ≤0.65625,
E22 ≤0.765625,
U1j ≤0.05,
U2j ≤0.006,
F (i)
jk  < 0.008392.
For example the matrix
E = diag {0.25, 0.43, 0.65, 0.76}.

satisﬁes the inequalities (3.5.36). Since E = 0.76, the matrix E does
not satisfy condition (3.5.33). Moreover  diag {0.65, 0.76} = 0.76 > 0.75
and it means that for the matrix E conditions (3.5.34) are not satisﬁed for
any γ ∈(0, 1).
So, the general conclusion from this example is: the hierarchical Lia-
punov function allows a more complete use of the potential possibilities of
Liapunov direct method in robustness analysis of discrete system (3.5.2).
3.6 Notes and References
Section 3.1
Qualitative theory of discrete systems under nonclassical structural
perturbations is of a considerable interest with regard to a number of applied
problems of nonlinear dynamics.
In the framework of the method of matrix-
valued Liapunov functions for the class of dynamical systems some results have
been obtained recently. Some of them are presented in this Section.
In a series of monographs (see, for example, Bromberg [1], La-Salle [1],
Tsypkin [1], Furasov [1], Lakshmikantham, Leela, et al. [1, 2], Michel, et al. [1],
Hahn [1], etc.) discussed are the various methods of application of the Liapunov
direct method for the qualitative analysis of motions of discrete-time systems
without structural perturbations.
Section 3.2
The large scale discrete-time system with structural perturbations
is composed according to the approach presented in Chapter 2. As in the contin-
uous case this allows the application of the generalized Liapunov direct method
based on matrix-valued function in the construction of the corresponding stability
conditions.
Section 3.3
In this section the matrix-valued function is applied within the
framework of the scalar approach. The section is based on the results by Mar-
tynyuk [12].
Section 3.4
The main results of this section are due to Martynyuk and Mi-
ladzhanov [1], and Martynyuk, Miladzhanov, and Muminov [1].
Section 3.5
This section is based on the results by Lukyanova and Martynyuk [1].
The comparative analysis of the obtained results is carried out using some results
by Sezer and ˇSiljak [1].

IMPULSIVE LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS
4.1 Introduction
It is well-known that the Liapunov direct method is of great importance for
the stability analysis of solutions of continuous nonlinear diﬀerential and
discrete-time equations (see Chapters 2 – 3).
This fruitful technique has
been developed during the twentieth century in two main directions. First,
the working out of constructive techniques of Liapunov function construc-
tions and second, the expansion of this method for the systems of equations
other than ordinary diﬀerential equations. One of classes of such systems
are impulsive systems.
Therefore our aim in this Chapter is to develop the Liapunov direct
matrix-valued functions method for the impulsive systems under nonclassi-
cal structural perturbations and to establish a new suﬃcient conditions for
the presence of various dynamical properties of solutions to the equations
under consideration.
Chapter 4 is arranged as follows.
Section 4.2 deals with description of impulsive system under nonclassical
structural perturbations.
In Section 4.3 the problem on stability of impulsive system under non-
classical structural perturbations is stated.
In Section 4.4 proposed are algorithms for determing the property of
having a ﬁxed sign of matrix-valued functions and their decrease (increase)
estimations on the trajectories of system under consideration.
In Section 4.5 various suﬃcient conditions are established for stability,
asymptotic stability and instability of large scale impulsive system under
nonclassical structural perturbations. Here an example of forth order sys-
tem with structural perturbations is presented illustrating the proposed
technique.
In Section 4.6 the obtained results are discussed as well as the possibilities
of the proposed generalization of the Liapunov direct method and some
trends of applications.
4.2 Nonclassical Structural Perturbations in Impulsive Systems
We consider an impulsive system under noclassical structural perturbations
obtained as a result of composition of complex nonlinear ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equations with impulsive perturbations.
In this section we study the class of impulsive systems I with subsystems
Ii whose description is based on the following assumptions.
H1. The evolution of system I and its subsystems Ii, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, is
described by the impulsive systems of equations whose order is not changed
on the general interval of existence of solutions to system I.

matrices for system I is designated as before by P = {P : P1 ≤P(t) ≤P2},
for all t ∈T .

mined by the equations

H6. The evolution of the i-th isolated subsystem in system I is described
by the equations
(4.2.2)
dxi
dt = wi(t, x)
for
t = τk(x),
∆xi(t) = Iik(xi)
for
t = τk(xi),
k = 1, 2, . . .,
where wi : T × Rni →Rni, Iik : Rni →Rni, k = 1, 2, . . . .
Here the
functions wi(t, xi) are determined from the correlations
wi(t, xi) = fi(t, xi, 0),
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
where xi = (0, . . . , 0, xT
i , 0, . . . , 0)T ∈Rn.
In view of the designations of Section 2.2 the impulsive system I with
structural and parametric perturbations is represented as
(4.2.3)
dxi
dt = wi(t, x) + Si(t)ri(t, x, pi)
for
t = τk(x),
∆xi(t) = Iik(x) + I∗
ik(x)
for
t = τk(x),
k = 1, 2, . . . ,
i = 1, 2, . . ., m,

t = τk(x),
∆x = Ik(x),
t = τk(x),

The matrix
(4.2.5)
S(t) = diag (S1(t), S2(t), . . . , Sk(t)) ∈S
describing all structural variations of the system (4.2.4) is called a structural
matrix of impulsive system (4.2.4).
We assume that w(t, 0) = 0, Ik(0) = 0 for all k = 1, 2, . . .
and
r(t, 0, P) = 0 if and only if x = 0 for all t ∈T0. It is clear that x = 0 is
an equilibrium.
Further we designate
T0 × D(ρ) = [t0, ∞) × {x ∈Rn : x ≤ρ < ρ0},
ρ0 = const > 0.
The functions τi(x) and a number ρ satisfy the condition which excludes
the beating of the solutions of system (4.2.4) on the surfaces
(Sk): t = (τk(x)),
k = 1, 2, . . . .
Throughout this chapter, we will assume that for each (t0, x0) ∈T0 ×
D(ρ), there exists at least one solution of (4.2.4) for all (P, S) ∈P × S
which satisﬁes the initial condition x(t0) = x0.

4.3 Deﬁnitions of Stability
The possibility of beating of the solutions of the equations on the surfaces
(Sk): t = (τk(x)), k = 1, 2, . . . , causes an essential diﬃculty when large
scale impulsive system (4.2.4) is investigated. Moreover, in the general case
there is no continuous dependence of the solutions of large scale impulsive
system (4.2.4) on the initial conditions which would be uniform on ﬁnite
interval. This fact requires the notion of stability in the sense of Liapunov of
the solutions of large scale impulsive system (4.2.4) be corrected. Therefore,
the notion of stability of solutions of large scale impulsive system (4.2.4) is
adopted in the form formulated according to general properties of impulsive
systems solution and it is assumed that the beating of the solutions on
surfaces (Sk): t = (τk(x)), k = 1, 2, . . ., is absent. In view of the results
from Chapter 2 we introduce the following notions.
Deﬁnition 4.3.1 The zero solution x = 0 of the system (4.2.4) is
(a) stable on P × S if and only if it is stable in the sense of Liapunov
for each pair of (P, S) ∈P × S;
(b) asymptotically stable on P × S if and only if it is asymptotically
stable in the sense of Liapunov for each pair of (P, S) ∈P × S;
(c) unstable on P × S if and only if there exists at least one pair of
(P, S) ∈P × S for which the state x = 0 is unstable.
Remark 4.3.1 The deﬁnitions of the above mentioned types of stability
for the given pair (P, S) are the same as for the systems without impulsive
perturbations.
4.4 Tests for Stability and Instability Analysis
Problem IA. Assume that the evolution of the system I with impul-
sive perturbations is obtained in result of composition of evolutions of the
isolated subsystems (4.2.2). It is required to establish suﬃcient conditions
for various types of stability (instability) of the equilibrium state x = 0 of
system (4.2.4) under certain dynamical properties of the isolated subsys-
tems (4.2.2).
4.4.1 Auxiliary estimations for matrix-valued functions
Before
going over to the stability (instability) conditions for the state x = 0 of sys-
tem (4.2.4) we shall establish some useful estimates for the auxiliary scalar
pseudo-quadratic function constructed in terms of matrix-valued function.
These estimates are some development of those presented in Chapter 2 for
continuous systems.
Assumption 4.4.1 Assume that there exist:
(1) open connected time invariant neighborhoods
Njx = {xj ∈Rnj : xj < hj0} ⊆Rnj
of the states xj = 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , m, hj0 = const > 0;
(2) functions ϕj1, ψj1 : Njx →R+, ϕj1, ψj1 ∈K;

vji = vij = vji(t, xj, xi)
for all j = i, vjj(t, 0) = vji(t, 0, 0) = 0, j, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, deﬁned

all (t, xj, xi) ∈T0 × Njx × Nix, j, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, j = i.
As before we shall introduce the scalar function
(4.4.1)
v(t, x, η) = ηTU(t, x)η,
η ∈Rm
+ ,
η > 0,
and its total derivative
(4.4.2)
Dv(t, x, η) = ηTDU(t, x)η,
where
DU(t, x) = [Dvji(t, ·)],
j, i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
due to the system (4.2.4). For the details see Section 1.4.

then for the function (4.4.1)

Proposition 4.4.2 is proved in a similar manner as Lemma 2 in Martynyuk
and Miladzhanov [1].
Corollary 4.4.1 Let all conditions of Assumption 4.4.2 be satisﬁed. If
there exists a constant matrix Q such that for the matrix G(P, S) the
inequality

for all
(P, S) ∈P × S
holds component-wise and
(1) λM(Q) < 0;
(2) λM(Q) < 0.
Then the estimates
Dv(t, x, η) ≤λM(Q)ϕm(v(t, x, η)),
for all
(t, x) ∈T0 × Nx0;
(4.4.6)
Dv(t, x, η) ≤λM(Q)ϕM(v(t, x, η)),
for all
(t, x) ∈T0 × Nx0;
(4.4.7)
are satisﬁed respectively.
Proof Let all conditions of Assumption 4.4.2 be satisﬁed and there exist
a constant matrix Q satisfying the inequality (4.4.5). In this connection
Proposition 4.4.2 yields

Assumption 4.4.8 Let
Πj = {(t, xj) ∈T0 × Rnj : ujj(t, xj) > 0}
be the positiveness domains for the functions
ujj(t, xj),
j = 1, 2, . . . , m,
and for every t ≥t0 they have non-zero open intersection with the plane
t = const adjoining to the origin, and in this domain the functions Uji,
j, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, are bounded.
Proposition 4.4.8 If all conditions of Assumptions 4.4.1 and 4.4.8 are
satisﬁed and the matrix A in the estimate (4.4.3) is positive deﬁnite, i.e.
λm(HTAH) > 0, then
(a) the domain Π = {(t, x) ∈T0 × D(ρ): v(t, x, η) > 0} of positiveness
of function v(t, x, η) for any t ∈T0 has non-zero open intersection
with the plane t = const adjoining to the origin;
(b) on the domain Π the function v(t, x, η) is bounded.
Proof If the conditions of Assumption 4.4.1 are satisﬁed together with
the condition λm(HTAH) > 0, then the positiveness domain of the func-
tion v(t, x, η) is
Π = {(t, x) ∈T0 × D(ρ): x = 0}
which has an open intersection with the plane t = const for each t ∈T0.
Moreover, the positiveness of the functions ujj(t, xj), j = 1, 2, . . . , m, is
a necessary condition for the positiveness of function v(t, x, η), therefore
Π ⊆m
j=1 Πj for every j = 1, 2, . . . , m by the condition of Assumption
4.4.8 has non-zero open intersection with the plane t = const adjoining to
the origin. This proves the assertion (a) of Proposition 4.4.8.
The boundedness of functions uji, j, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, implies that the
matrix U(t, x) is bounded, but then the function v(t, x, η) constructed by
formula (4.4.1) will be bounded as well.
4.4.2

Theorem 4.4.1 Let large scale impulsive system (4.2.4) be such that
(1) in the domain T0 × D(ρ) all conditions of Hypotheses 1, 2 and 3
are satisﬁed;
(2) the matrix A is positive deﬁnite (i.e. λm(HTAH) > 0);
(3) there exists a negative semi-deﬁnite or equal to zero matrix Q such
that for the matrix G(P, S) the estimate
1
2 (G(P, S) + GT(P, S)) ≤Q
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S,
t = τk(x),
k = 1, 2, . . . ,
is satisﬁed element-wise;
(4) the matrix C is negative semi-deﬁnite or equal to zero (i.e.
λM(C) ≤0).
Then the zero solution of large-scale impulsive system (4.2.4) is stable
on P × S.
If condition (4) is modiﬁed as follows
(5) the matrix C is negative deﬁnite (i.e. λM(C) < 0),
then the zero solution of large scale impulsive system (4.2.4) is asymptoti-
cally stable on P × S.
Proof Under the conditions of Assumptions 4.4.1, Proposition 4.4.1 and
condition (1) of Theorem 4.4.1 the function v(t, x, η) (see (4.4.1)) is pos-
itive deﬁnite. The conditions of Assumption 4.4.2, Proposition 4.4.2 and
condition (3) of Theorem 4.4.1 imply
Dv(t, x, η) ≤0
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S,

k = 1, 2, . . .

v(τk(x), x + Jk(x)) −v(τk(x), x) ≤λM(C)ψM(v(τk(x), x)),
k = 1, 2, . . .
and therefore the conditions being suﬃcient for asymptotic stability are
satisﬁed for every (P, S) ∈P × S. Hence, the zero solution of large scale
impulsive system (4.2.4) is asymptotically stable on P × S.

Then the zero solution of large scale impulsive system (4.2.4), (4.2.5) is
unstable on P × S.
This Theorem is proved in the same way as Theorem 4.4.4. We note
that all hypotheses on instability of Theorem 1.4.6 are satisﬁed with the
functions

and
ψ(y) = λm(C∗)ψm(y),

For the system (4.5.1) we construct a matrix-valued function
(4.5.2)
U(x) = [vij(xi, xj)],
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m
with the elements
(4.5.3)
vii(xi) = xT
i Biixi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , m
and
(4.5.4)
vij(xi, xj) = xT
i Bijxj,
i = j,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m.
Here Bii are constant positive deﬁnite matrices, and Bij are constant ma-
trices.
We introduce the following assumption.
Assumption 4.5.1 Assume that there exist
(1) the matrix-valued function (4.5.2) with the elements (4.5.3) and
(4.5.4);
(2) the constants aji, bji, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m, satisfying the estimates
(a) aiixi2 ≤Uii(xi) ≤biixi2 for all xi ∈Nix,
i = 1, 2, . . . , m,

(xi, xj) ∈Nix×
Njx,
i = j,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m.
Proposition 4.5.1 If all conditions of Assumption 4.5.1 are satisﬁed,
then the function
(4.5.5)
v(x, η) = ηTU(x)η,
η ∈Rm
+ ,
η > 0
satisﬁes the bilateral inequality
(4.5.6)
uTHTAHu ≤v(x, η) ≤uTHTBHu
for all
x ∈Nx = N1x × N2x × . . . × Nmx.
Here
uT = (x1, x2, . . . , xm),
A = [aij],
B = [bij],
H = diag [η1, η2, . . . , ηm].
The proof of Proposition 4.5.1 is similar to that of Proposition 4.4.1 (see
and cf. Djordjevic [1]).
Together with the function (4.5.5) its total derivative
(4.5.7)
Dv(x, η) = ηTDU(x)η

Proposition 4.5.2 If all conditions of Assumption 4.5.2 are satisﬁed,
then for expression (4.5.7) we get
(4.5.8)
Dv(x, η) ≤uTG(S)u,
for all
x ∈Nx0 × S,
where
uT = (x1, x2, . . . , xm),

The proof of Proposition 4.5.2 is similar to that of Proposition 4.5.1.
It can be easily veriﬁed that for t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . . , the estimate
(4.5.9)
Dv(x, η) ≤λM(G(S))u2,
for all
x ∈Nx0,
for all
S ∈S
is true. Here λM(·) is the maximal eigenvalues of (·). If ηT = (1, 1, . . . , 1) ∈
Rm
+ then from (4.5.6) we get
(4.5.10)
λm(A)u2 ≤v(x, η) ≤λM(B)u2
and for λm(A) > 0 we get
(4.5.11)
λ−1
M (B)v(x, η) ≤u2 ≤λ−1
m (A)v(x, η).
Therefore, the estimate (4.5.9) can be represented as
Dv(x, η) ≤

λM(G(S))λ−1
m (A)v(x, η)
for λM(G(S)) > 0;
λM(G(S))λ−1

Inequality (4.5.13) is proved in the same way.
Corollary 4.5.1 If all conditions of Proposition 4.5.3 are satisﬁed, then
for the function (4.5.5) for t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . . , the following estimates
hold true

The assertions (4.5.14) and (4.5.15) follow from Proposition 4.5.3 and
the inequality (4.5.11).
Proposition 4.5.4 If t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . . , then for the total deriva-

(4.5.16)

Proposition 4.5.5 Let t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . ., then for the function

Proof
The proof of this Proposition is similar to that of Proposi-
tion 4.5.3.
Corollary 4.5.1 If all conditions of Proposition 4.5.5 are satisﬁed, then
for the function (4.5.5) and the system (4.5.1) for t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . .
(a) v(x + Jk(x), η) −v(x, η) ≥∆V (x, η), where

Proof The proof follows from Proposition 4.5.5 and (4.5.11).
Theorem 4.5.1 Let the system (4.5.1) be such that the matrix-valued
function (4.5.2) is constructed with the elements (4.5.3) and (4.5.4) and
(1) the matrix A in (4.5.6) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λm(A) > 0;
(2) there exists a matrix Q such that for the matrix G(S) the estimate
1
2 (G(S) + G
T(S)) ≤Q
for all
S ∈S
is satisﬁed component-wise;
(3) the matrix Q is negative semi-deﬁnite or equal to zero, i.e. the in-
equality λm(Q) ≤0 holds.
Then the zero solution of the system (4.5.1) is stable in the whole on S.
If instead of the condition (3) the following condition is satisﬁed
(4) the matrix C in (4.5.12) is negative deﬁnite, i.e. λM(C) < 0,
then the zero solution of the system (4.5.1) is asymptotically stable in the
whole on S.
The proof of Theorem 4.5.1 is similar to that of Theorem 4.4.1.

Theorem 4.5.6 Let the system (4.5.1) be such that the matrix-valued
function (4.5.2) be constructed with the elements (4.5.3) and (4.5.4) and
(1) the matrix A in (4.5.6) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λm(A) > 0;

≥Q+ for all S ∈S
(b) λm(Q+) > 0;
(3) λm(C∗) > 0 i.e. the matrix C∗is positive deﬁnite;
(4) for some constant θ > 0 the values τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . . , satisfy the
correlation
τk+1(x) −τk(x) = θ > 0.
If for some γ > 0
λM(B)
λm(Q+) ln λM(B)
λm( ¯C∗) ≤θ −γ,
then the zero solution of the system (4.5.1) is unstable on S.
Proof The proof of this theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 4.4.6.
Example 4.5.1 Let the system (4.5.1) be a fourth order system decom-
posed into two subsystems of the second order which are deﬁned by the
matrices:
(4.5.21)
A1 =

A12 = A21 = I2;
Jki = diag {−1, −1},
i = 1, 2;
Jk12 = Jk21 = 10−1I2,
S = {S : S = diag {S1, S2},
Si = [Si1, Si2],
Sii = I2,
Sij = sijI2,
0 ≤sij ≤1,
i = j,
i, j = 1, 2},
where I2 = diag {1, 1}.
For this example the elements (4.5.3) and (4.5.4) of the matrix-valued
function (4.5.2) are constructed in the form
vii(xi) = xT
i I2xi,
i = 1, 2;
v12(x1, x2) = v21(x1, x2) = xT
110−1I2x2.
It is clear that they satisfy the estimates
xi2 ≤vii(xi)
for all
xi ∈Rni,
i = 1, 2,
−0.1x1 x2 ≤v12(x1, x2) ≤0.1x1 x2.
If for some γ > 0 the inequality
−λm(A)
λM(Q−) ln λm( ¯C∗)
λM(B) ≥θ1 + γ
holds, then the zero solution of the system (4.5.1) is unstable on S.
Proof The validity of this theorem follows from Theorem 4.4.5.

Thus, all conditions of Theorem 4.5.1 are satisﬁed and the zero solution
of the system (4.5.1) with matrices (4.5.21) is structurally asymptotically
stable in the whole on S.
4.6 Certain Trends of Generalizations and Applications
This section deals with two problems. In the ﬁrst problem we establish
conditions under which the stability of solutions with respect to two mea-
sures in the continuous system under nonclassical structural perturbations
implies the same type of stability of solutions to the impulsive system under
nonclassical structural perturbations. In the second problem we establish
suﬃcient stability conditions for the system of Lurie-Postnikov type in the
presence of impulsive and nonclassical structural perturbations.

Deﬁnition 4.6.1 A function:

and

k
η(t) = η(τ +
k );
(b) ζ belongs to the class PCK if ζ : R+ →R+, ζ(·, u) ∈PC for each
u ∈R+, and ζ(t, ·) ∈K for each t ∈R+;
(c) ρ belongs to the class M if ρ: R+ × Rn →R+, ρ(·, x) ∈PC for
each x ∈Rn and ρ(t, ·) ∈C(R+ × Rn, R+) for each t ∈R+ and
inf
x∈Rn ρ(t, x) = 0.
The deﬁnitions of (ρ0, ρ)-stability of the impulsive system (4.6.1) are
formulated in view of Deﬁnition 1.4.2 and the deﬁnition of stability with
respect to two measures from Section 2.6.1.
Let U : R+ × Rn →Rm×m, m > 1, be a matrix-valued function. We
consider the function
(4.6.3)
v(t, y, η) = ηTU(t, y)η,
η ∈Rm
+.
Further the functions of the class SL0 are applied (see Deﬁnition 1.4.3)
which were constructed in terms of matrix-valued functions U(t, x).
For the function (4.6.3) for (s, x) ∈G0, G0 =
∞

k=1
G0k, Gk0 = {(t, x) ∈
R+ × Rn : τk−1(x) < t < τk(x)}, t0 ≤s ≤t, we deﬁne the expression
(4.6.4)
D+v(s, y(t, s, x), η) = ηTD+U(s, y(t, s, x))η.
Further we shall need the comparison functions deﬁned below (see, Lak-
shmikantham, et al. [1]).

Here

= lim sup {[U(s + ϑ, y(t, s + ϑ, x + ϑQ(s, x, P, S)))
−U(s, y(t, s, x))] ϑ−1,
ϑ →0+},
where y(t, s, x) is a solution of the continuous system (4.6.2) such that
y(s, s, x) = x. If Q(t, y, P, S) = 0 then
y(t, s, x) = x,
y(t, s + ϑ, x + ϑQ(s, x, P, S)) ≡x + ϑQ(s, x, P, S),
and the expression (4.6.4) becomes
(4.6.5)
D+v(s, x, η) = ηTD+U(s, x)η,
where
D+U(s, x)
= lim sup {[U(s + ϑ, x + ϑQ(s, x, P, S)) −U(s, x)] ϑ−1,
ϑ →0+}.
In the expressions (4.6.4) and (4.6.5) the total derivative of the function
(4.6.3) is computed element-wise.
Further we designate
S(ρ, σ) = {(t, x) ∈(τk−1, τk] × Rn : ρ(t, x) < σ, σ = const > 0},
k = 1, 2, . . . .
We give some suﬃcient conditions for preserving the (ρ0, ρ)-stability of
impulsive system if corresponding system without impulsive perturbation
is stable with respect to two measures.
Theorem 4.6.1 Assume that for systems (4.6.1) and (4.6.2) the fol-
lowing conditions hold:
(1) the measures ρ0, ρ∗, and ρ are in M, and function U(t, x, η) ∈SL0;
(2) the measure ρ∗is continuous with respect to the measure ρ and
ρ∗(t, x) is continuous and nondecreasing in t;
(3) the function v(t, x, η) is weakly ρ∗-decreasing and for some σ > 0
the function v(t, x, η) is ρ-positive deﬁnite on the set S(ρ, σ);
(4) there exist comparison functions ui of class K and m × m–matrix
B = B(P, S) such that for any (P, S) ∈P × S the estimate
(4.6.6)
D+v(s, y(t, s, x), η) ≤uT(y)B(P, S) u(y)
holds for any t > t0, provided that s ∈[t0, t) for all (s, x) ∈
S(ρ, σ) ∩G0;
(5) there exists a constant σ0 ∈(0, σ) such that ρ(τ +
k , x + Ik(x)) < σ
as soon as ρ(τk, x) < σ0;
(6) for all (τk, x) ∈Sk ∩S(ρ, σ)
v(τ +
k , y(t, τ +
k , x + Ik(x)), η) ≤v(τk, y(t, τk, x), η),
k = 1, 2, . . . ;
(7) there exists a constant m×m–matrix B such that B(P, S) ≤B for
all (P, S) ∈P × S and the matrix B∗= 1
2 (B + B
T) is negative
semi-deﬁnite.

Then (ρ0, ρ∗)–stability (asymptotic (ρ0, ρ∗)–stability) of system (4.6.2)
on P × S implies (ρ0, ρ)–stability (asymptotic (ρ0, ρ)–stability) of the im-
pulsive system (4.6.1) on P × S.
Proof The condition (3) of Theorem 4.6.1 implies that there exist the
function a ∈K such that
(4.6.7)
a(ρ(t, x)) ≤v(t, x, η)
for all
(t, x) ∈S(ρ, σ)
and the function b ∈CK such that
(4.6.8)
v(t, x, η) ≤b(t, ρ∗(t, x))
for all (t, x) ∈S(ρ∗, δ0) for some value δ0 > 0.
Further by condition (2) of Theorem 4.6.1 there exist a constant δ1 > 0
and a comparison function ψ of class CK such that
(4.6.9)
ρ(t, x) ≤ψ(t, ρ∗(t, x))
for all
(t, x) ∈S(ρ∗, δ1),
where the constant δ1 satisﬁes the condition
(4.6.10)
ψ(t0, δ1) < σ.
Let ε ∈(0, σ) and t0 ∈R+. For the given function b of class CK we
take a constant ∆= ∆(t0, ε) < min (σ, δ0, δ1) so that the condition u < ∆
yields the estimate
(4.6.11)
b(t0, u) < a(ε).
Further we assume that the system (4.6.2) is (ρ0, ρ∗) – stable on P × S.
Moreover, given ∆, there exists δ = δ(t0, ∆) > 0 (δ < ∆) such that the
condition ρ0(t0, x0) < δ implies
(4.6.12)
ρ∗(t, y(t; t0, x0)) < ∆,
t ≥t0,
for all (P, S) ∈P × S, where y(t; t0, x0) is a solution of system (4.6.2) for
any values of (P, S) ∈P × S.
Let x(t) = x(t; t0, x0) be a solution of the impulsive system (4.6.1) with
The conditions (4) and (7) of Theorem 4.6.1 imply
(4.6.13)
D+v(s, y(t; s, x), η) ≤λM(B∗)uTu ≤0
for any t > t0, provided that s ∈[t0, t) and (s, x) ∈S(ρ, σ) ∩G0. Here
λM(·) is the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix B∗, λM(B∗) ≤0, and
uT = (u1/2
1
(y), . . . , u1/2
m (y)).
Then the conditions (4.6.7) – (4.6.13) yield
(4.6.14)
a(ρ(t0, x0)) ≤v(t0, x0, η) ≤b(t0, ρ∗(t0, x0)) < a(ε).

Hence we ﬁnd that ρ(t0, x0) < ε.
Let us show that ρ(t, x(t)) < ε for all (P, S) ∈P ×S and for all t ≥t0.
If this is not true, then there exists a value t∗> t0 such that ρ(t∗, x(t∗)) ≥ε
for at least one pair (P, S) ∈P × S. In the case when t∗< τ1(x) the proof
of the assertion made is not associated with the presence of the impulsive
perturbations of the system (4.6.1) and is carried out in a standard manner
(see, e.g. Lakshmikantham, Leela, et al. [1]). Therefore, this case is omitted
here. Assume that t∗∈(τk, τk+1] for some k, and moreover, for at least
one pair (P, S) ∈P × S
(4.6.15)
ρ(t∗, x(t∗)) ≥ε
and
ρ(t, x(t)) < ε
if t ∈[τ0, τk].
According to the choice of ε ∈(0, σ) and by estimates (4.6.15) we have
ρ(τk, x(τk)) < ε < σ.
The condition (5) of Theorem 4.6.1 implies
(4.6.16)
ρ(τ +
k , x(τ +
k )) = ρ(τ +
k , xk + Ik(xk)) < δ,
where xk = x(τk). Therefore, there exists a value ˜t ∈(τk, t∗] such that
(4.6.17)
ε ≤ρ( ˜t, x( ˜t )) < σ,
ρ(t, x(t)) < σ
for all t ∈[t0, ˜t ) and for all (P, S) ∈P × S.

Designate m(s) = v(s, y( ˜t; s, x(s)), η) for s ∈[t0, ˜t ] where y(t; s, x(s))
is any solution of system 4.6.2) for all (P, S) ∈P × S. Inequality (4.6.13)
implies that D+m(s) ≤0 for t0 ≤s < ˜t, for all (s, x(s)) ∈G0 and for all
(P, S) ∈P × S. Hence we ﬁnd that m(s) ≤m(t+
0 ), t0 ≤s < t1, where
t1 = τ1(x(t1)). If (s, x(s)) ∈G01 and s →t1, then m(t1) ≤m(t+
0 ). Note
that m(t+
1 ) = v(t+
1 , y( ˜t; t+
1 , x(t1) + I1(x(t1))), η).
The condition (6) of
Theorem 4.6.1 implies that m(t+
1 ) ≤m(t1) ≤m(t+
0 ).
Thus, for the values s ∈(τk, ˜t ) we get the estimate m(s) ≤m(τ +
k ) ≤
m(t+
0 ). If (s, x(s)) ∈G0,k+1 and s →˜t+, then m( ˜t ) ≤m(t+
0 ). The fact
that the measure ρ∗is nondecreasing in t and the conditions (4.6.11) and
(4.6.12) yield
(4.6.18)
v( ˜t, x( ˜t ),η) = v( ˜t, y( ˜t; t, x( ˜t )), η) = lim
s→˜t v(s, y( ˜t; s, x(s)), η)
≤v(t+
0 , y( ˜t; t0, x0), η) ≤b(t0, ρ∗(t0, y( ˜t; t0, x0)))
≤b( ˜t, ρ∗( ˜t, y( ˜t; t0, x0))) < a(ε).
On the other hand, by conditions (4.6.7) and (4.6.17) we have the in-
equalities
v( ˜t, x( ˜t), η) ≥a(ρ( ˜t, x( ˜t ))) = a(ε),
which contradict the inequality (4.6.18). Therefore the assertion is true
that ρ(t, x(t)) < ε for all (P, S) ∈P × S and for all t ≥t0.
This proves (ρ0, ρ)–stability of solutions of system (4.6.1) on P × S.
Now we shall prove that under conditions of Theorem 4.6.1 the solutions
of system (4.6.1) possess the property of (ρ0, ρ)–attraction on P × S. As-
sume that system (4.6.2) is asymptotically (ρ0, ρ∗)–stable on P × S. Then
for any t0 ∈R+ there exists δ∗= δ∗(t0) > 0 such that the condition
ρ0(t0, x0) < δ∗implies lim
t→∞ρ∗(t, y(t; t0, x0)) = 0 for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
The fact that system (4.6.1) is (ρ0, ρ)–stable implies that for any t0 ∈
R+ and σ0 ∈(0, σ) there exists δ∗
0 = δ(t0, σ0) > 0, δ∗
0 < δ∗, such that the
condition ρ0(t0, x0) < δ∗
0 implies that ρ(t, x(t)) < σ0 for all t ≥t0, where
x(t) is a solution of system (4.6.1) for (P, S) ∈P × S.
As noted above, the conditions (4) and (7) of Theorem 4.6.1 yield
D+v(t, y(t; s, x(s)), η) ≤0,
s ∈[t0, t),
for all (s, x(s)) ∈G0 and for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
The arguments similar to the above ones lead to the estimate
0 ≤v(t, x(t), η) ≤v(t0, y(t; t0, x0), η),
which is true for all t ≥t0.
For the suﬃciently large t ≥t0
v(t0, y(t; t0, x0), η) ≤b(t0, ρ∗(t0, y(t; t0, x0))) ≤b(t0, ρ∗(t, y(t; t0, x0))).
Hence it follows that

t→∞v(t, x(t), η) = 0

for all (P, S) ∈P × S. Since the function v is ρ–positive deﬁnite,
lim
t→∞ρ(t, x(t)) = 0
for all
(P, S) ∈P × S.
This proves the asymptotic (ρ0, ρ)–stability of solutions to system (4.6.1)
for all (P, S) ∈P × S.
Actually, when the function (4.6.3) constructed in terms of the matrix-
valued function U(t, y) is applied, the condition (6) of Theorem 4.6.1 be-
comes

v(τ +

where λk(Ck) ≥0,

k=1
λk(Ck) = ∞, ψ ∈C(R+, Rm
+ ), ψ(0) = 0, ψ(s) > 0
for s > 0, λk(Ck) are the maximal eigenvalues of some matrices Ck, k =
1, 2, . . . . Then Theorem 4.6.1 is developed as follows.
Theorem 4.6.2 Assume that conditions (1) – (5) and (7) of Theorem
4.6.1 and condition (6*) are satisﬁed.
Then (ρ0, ρ∗)–stability of system
(4.6.2) implies asymptotic (ρ0, ρ)–stability of system (4.6.1).
The proof of this theorem is similar to that of Theorem 4.6.1.
Note, that for the impulsive system under nonclassical structural pertur-
bations it is reasonable to consider the set of measures discussed in Section
2.6.1.

(1, 1, . . . , 1) ∈Rm
+ we construct the function
(4.6.26)
v(x, η) = ηTU(x)η
and consider its total derivative
(4.6.27)
Dv(x, η) = ηTDU(x)η,
where
DU(x) = [Duij(xi, xj)],
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m,
along the solutions of system (4.2.4).
Proposition 4.6.1 If the estimates (4.6.25) are satisﬁed, then for the
function (4.6.26) the two-sided inequality
(4.6.28)
uTAu ≤v(x, η) ≤uTBu
for all
x ∈Rn
holds true, where
uT = (x1, x2, . . . , xm),
A = [αij],
B = αij,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m,
αii = λm(Pii),
αii = λM(Pii)

Proof The proof of Proposition 4.6.1 follows from Djordjevi´c [1] (see
also Martynyuk and Stavroulakis [1]).

The proof of this Proposition is similar to that of Lemma 3 in Martynyuk
and Stavroulakis [ 1 ] (see also Miladzhanov [3]).

hold true.
The proof follows from Proposition 4.6.4 and Corollary 4.6.6.
For system (4.6.1), the following stability problem is formulated. It is
necessary to formulate conditions related to the coeﬃcients which appear
in the system and also to introduce structural perturbation, such that the
trivial solution of system (4.6.1) is asymptotically stable in the whole on S
for an arbitrary function f of the class under consideration.
We shall introduce the following notions.
Deﬁnition 4.6.2 The zero solution x = 0 of (4.6.1) is absolutely stable
under nonclassical structural perturbation (i.e. absolutely stable on S) if it
is absolutely stable for each S ∈S in the sense of Lur’e-Postnikov [1].
The above Propositions and Corollaries allow us to establish suﬃcient
conditions for absolute stability of the zero solution of system (4.6.1) on S.
Theorem 4.6.4 Let system (4.6.1) be such that the matrix-valued func-
tion (4.6.23) is constructed with the elements (4.6.24) and
(1) the matrix A in (4.6.28) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λm(A) > 0;
(2) the matrix Θ in (4.6.32) is negative semi-deﬁnite or equals to zero,
i.e. λM(Θ) ≤0;
(3) the matrix Λ in (4.6.33) is negative deﬁnite.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Then the zero solution of system (4.6.1) is absolutely stable on S.
Proof Under all conditions of Theorem 4.6.4
(a) the function v(x, η) is positive deﬁnite;
(b) for the function v(x, η) and t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . . , we have
Dv(x, η) ≤0
for all
S ∈S,
and
x ∈Rn;
(c) for the function v(x, η) and t = τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . . , we have
v(x + Jk(x), η) −v(x, η) ≤λM(Λ)λ−1
M (B)v(x, η)
for all
x ∈Rn.
By Theorem 1.4.4 from Chapter 1 for (a) – (c) the zero solution of system
(4.6.1) is asymptotically stable in the whole on S. Since here Nix = Rni,
i = 1, 2, . . . , m, and Nx = N1x × . . . × Nmx = Rn.
Theorem 4.6.5 Let system (4.6.1) be such that the matrix-valued func-
tion (4.6.23) is constructed with the elements (4.6.24) and
(1) the matrix A in (4.6.28) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λm(A) > 0;
(2) the matrix Θ in (4.6.31) is negative deﬁnite, i.e. λM(Θ) < 0;
(3) the matrix Λ∗in (4.6.34) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λM(Λ∗) > 0;
(4) the function τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . ., satisﬁes the inequality

= θ > 0.
If for some γ > 0 the inequality
−λM(B)
λM(Θ) ln λM(Λ∗)
λm(A) ≤θ −γ,
is satisﬁed, then the zero solution of system (4.6.1) is absolutely stable on S.
The proof follows from Propositions 4.6.1 – 4.6.2 and Theorem 1.4.5.
Theorem 4.6.6 Let system (4.6.1) be such that the matrix-valued func-
tion (4.6.23) is constructed with the elements (4.6.24) and
(1) the matrix A in (4.6.28) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λm(A) > 0;
(2) the matrix Θ in (4.6.31) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λM(Θ) > 0;
(3) the matrix Λ∗in (4.6.34) is positive deﬁnite, i.e. λM(Λ∗) > 0;
(4) the functions τk(x), k = 1, 2, . . ., for some θ1 > 0 satisfy the in-
equality
max
x∈Rn τk(x) −min
x∈Rn τk−1(x) ≤θ1,
k = 1, 2, . . . .
If for some γ > 0 the inequality
λm(A)
λM(Θ) ln λm(A)
λm(Λ∗) ≥θ1 + γ,
is satisﬁed, then the zero solution of system (4.6.1) is absolutely stable on S.
Proof The statement of Theorem 4.6.6 follows from Propositions 4.6.1 –
4.6.2 and Theorem 3 in Martynyuk and Stavroulakis [1] (see also Mi-
ladzhanov [1]).

all conditions of Theorem 4.6.1 are satisﬁed and the zero solution of system
(4.6.1) speciﬁed by vectors and matrices (4.6.42) is absolutely stable on S.
4.7 Notes and References
Section 4.1
The methods of qualitative analysis of nonlinear systems discussed in
Chapters 1 – 3 have several analogues for the impulsive systems. Thus yet Krylov
and Bogolyubov [1] paid attention to the possibility to apply the methods of
nonlinear mechanics in the investigation of systems with impulsive perturbations.
Some monographs and textbooks which contain the development of the theory of
impulsive systems without structural perturbations have been mentioned in Notes
and References to Chapter 1. Though many problems of nonlinear dynamics of
systems under impulsive and nonclassical structural perturbations remain still
open.

Section 4.2
Dynamics of the impulsive systems for the given model of nonclassi-
cal structural perturbations was ﬁrst studied by Miladzhanov [3, 6]. These inves-
tigations were further developed and reﬁned by Martynyuk and Miladzhanov [6]
(see also Martynyuk and Stavroulakis [1 – 3]).
Section 4.3
The deﬁnitions of stability of impulsive systems under nonclassical
structural perturbations take into account some peculiarities of the systems of
this class which have been discussed in Section 1.4.
Sections 4.4 – 4.5
These sections are based on the results by Martynyuk and
Miladzhanov [6], Martynyuk and Stavroulakis [1– 3] and Miladzhanov [3, 6]. In
the investigation of linear impulsive systems some results are used which were
obtained in Chapter 2 for linear continuous systems under nonclassical structural
perturbations.
Section 4.6
The evolution analysis of the impulsive system with respect to two
or more diﬀerent measures (see Leela [1], Lakshmikantham and Liu [1], Mar-
tynyuk [11], etc.)
is a possible direction of generalization of the method of
matrix-valued Liapunov functions for the system with impulsive and nonclassical
structural perturbations. The results of Section 4.6.1 are new (see Martynyuk
and Chernetskaya [1], and cf. Kou, et al. [1]). In Section 4.6.2 we use general
results of this Chapter and the results by Martynyuk and Miladzhanov [6], and
Martynyuk and Stavroulakis [1].

SINGULARLY PERTURBED LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS
5.2 Nonclassical Structural Perturbations in Singularly
Perturbed Systems
The real systems in which the fast and slow variables can potentially exist
are modeled by means of the systems of equations with small parameter
at senior variable (singularly perturbed systems).
The class of systems
of equations under consideration (furtheron designated as F) is described
basing on the hypotheses below (cf. Gruji´c et al. [1]).
H1. System F consists of q subsystems of ordinary diﬀerential equations
with structural perturbations and r subsystems with structural perturba-
tions and small parameters at senior derivatives. The order of fast and
slow components of the system remains unchanged during all the period of
system F functionning.
H2. Dynamics of the i-th interconnected subsystem Fi in system F is
described by the equations
(5.2.1)
dxi
dt = fi(t, x, y, Pi, Si),
µi
dyi
dt = gi(t, x, y, M, Pq+i, Sq+i),
where xi ∈Rni, yi ∈Rmi, fi and gi are continuous vector–functions of
the corresponding dimensions, µi are small positive parameters, µi ∈(0, 1]
and M = diag {µ1, . . . , µn}.
5.1 Introduction
In this chapter we propose some development of the direct Liapunov
method for the given class of systems of equations in terms of auxiliary
matrix valued functions.
This allows us to weaken the requirements to
the dynamical properties of the individual subsystems and to extend the
variation limits for the small parameters µi for senior derivatives of the
systems of perturbed motion equations.
The chapter is arranged as follows.
Section 5.2 sets out the method of composition of large–scale system on
the basic of individual subsystems for the given model of connectedness.
Sections 5.3 – 5.4 contain the results of development of a new method of
stability and/or instability analysis of large–scale system under nonclassical
structural perturbations.
In section 5.5. similar problems are discussed for linear singularly per-
turbed systems for uniform and nonuniform time scaling.
In ﬁnal Section 5.6 two problems of practical importance are consid-
ered. One of the problems relates to absolute stability under nonclassical
structural perturbations and the other deals with gyroscopic stabilization
of orbital apparatus.

In the case (5.2.9) and (5.2.10) the time scaling is uniform and
(5.2.11)
τi = µ1
µi
,
i = 1, 2, . . . , r.
Obviously, in this case τ 1 = τ1 = τ 1 = 1.
Everywhere below it is assumed that the correlations
0 = gi(t, x, y, 0, Pq+i, Sq+i),
∀(t, x, y) ∈R × Nx × Ny,
are satisﬁed for each pair (P, S) ∈P × S iﬀy = 0 and
0 = gi(t, xi, yi, 0, Pq+i, Sq+i),
∀(t, xi, yi) ∈R × Nx × Ny,
are satisﬁed for each pair (P, S) ∈P × S iﬀyi = 0.
Therefore systems (5.2.6) and (5.2.3) are equivalent to the system
dxi
dt = fi(t, xi, 0, Pi, Si),
(5.2.12)
dxi
dt = fi(t, x, 0, Pi, Si),
i = 1, 2, . . ., q,
(5.2.13)
respectively.
5.3 Tests for Stability Analysis
In the qualitative analysis for the given class of large scale systems the
question whether diﬀerent time scales ti are interconnected is of importance.
General purpose of our investigation is to obtain conditions under which
stability of zero solution of the initial system is implied by stability of
some independent degenerated subsystems and stability of the independent
subsystems describing boundary layer with allowance for the qualitative
properties of interconnections between the subsystems.
5.3.1 Non-uniform time scaling Assume that the correlation q = r is
satisﬁed. Then system (5.2.5) is represented as
(5.3.1)
dxi
dt = fi(t, xi, 0, Pi, Si) + f ∗
i + f ∗∗
i ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , q,
µi
dyi
dt = gi(α, bi, yi, Pq+i, Sq+i) + g∗
i + g∗∗
i ,
i = 1, 2, . . ., q,
where
f ∗
i = fi(t, xi, yi, Pi, Si) −fi(t, xi, 0, Pi, Si),
g∗
i = gi(t, xi, yi, M i, Pq+i, Sq+i) −gi(α, bi, yi, 0, Pq+i, Sq+i),
f ∗∗
i
= fi(t, x, y, Pi, Si) −fi(t, xi, yi, Pi, Si),
g∗∗
i
= gi(t, x, y, M, Pq+i, Sq+i) −gi(t, xi, yi, M i, Pq+i, Sq+i).
Here the functions f ∗
i and g∗
i describe the connections between equations of
the i-th independent singularly perturbed subsystem (Fi) of the system F,
and the functions f ∗∗
i
and g∗∗
i
describe all the rest connections in system F.
In view of results from Martynyuk and Miladzhanov [1 – 5] we introduce
some assumptions.

Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system F is uniformly
asymptotically stable for any µi ∈(0, µi) and for µi →0 on P × S,
where µi = min {1, µi1, µi2}.
If, moreover, Ni1 × Niy = Rni+mi, the functions ϕik, ψik, ϕi, ψi are of
class KR, then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system F is uniformly
asymptotically stable in the whole for any µi ∈(0, µi) and for µi →0 on
P × S.
Proof
Under conditions of Assumption 5.3.1, Proposition 5.3.1 and con-
dition (a) of Theorem 5.3.1 the function v(t, x, y, M) is positive deﬁnite for
any µi ∈(0, µi1) and for µi →0 it is decreasing on Nix × Niy. Con-
ditions of Assumption 5.3.2, Proposition 5.3.2 and condition (b) of Theo-
rem 5.3.1 imply that the expression D+v(t, x, y, M) is negative deﬁnite for
any µi ∈(0, µi2) and for µi →0 for each (P, S) ∈P × S.
These conditions are suﬃcient for uniform asymptotic stability of the
equilibrium state of system (5.2.5) for any µi ∈(0, µi) and for µi →0
on 
M × P × S since all conditions of Theorem 7 from Chapter 1 of the
monograph by Gruji´c, et al. [1] are satisﬁed.
In the case when Nix × Niy = Rni+mi , the function v(t, x, y, M) is
positive deﬁnite, decreasing and radially unbounded. This fact together
with the other conditions of the theorem prove the second statement.
Remark 5.3.1 From the condition of matrix A(M) positive deﬁniteness
and matrix G(M) negative deﬁniteness the values µi1 and µi2 are deter-
mined respectively, since µi = min {1, µi1, µi2} is the lower estimate of
the upper bound of the admissible µi so that

M = {M : 0 < µi < µi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , q}.

Proof of Proposition 5.3.5 is similar to that of Proposition 5.3.2.
Proposition 5.3.6 If in Proposition 5.3.5 the matrix C is negative-
deﬁnite and λM(G) > 0 , then the expression D+v(t, x, y, µ1) deﬁned by

The proof of Proposition 5.3.6 follows from the analysis of the inequality

Remark 5.3.2 If in Proposition 5.3.6 λM(G) ≤0 , then expression
(5.3.9) is negative deﬁnite for any µ1 ∈(0, 1] and for µ1 →0.
Theorem 5.3.2 Let the perturbed motion equations (5.3.6) be such that
all conditions of Assumptions 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 are satisﬁed and

Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.3.6) is uniformly
asymptotically stable on

If all conditions of the theorem are satisﬁed for Nix×Njy = Rni+mj and

Proof
Under conditions of Assumption 5.3.3, Proposition 5.3.3 and con-
ditions (1) and (3) of Theorem 5.3.2 the function v(t, x, y, µ1) is positive
deﬁnite on 
M and decreasing on Nx×Ny. Conditions of Assumption 5.3.4,

Besides, the matrix C is negative deﬁnite and

So, all conditions of Theorem 5.3.2 are satisﬁed, µ1 = min {µ∗

and therefore the equilibrium state of system (5.3.10) is uniformly asymp-
totically stable in the whole on M × S.
5.4 Tests for Instability Analysis
5.4.1
Non-uniform time scaling
Instability of solutions is considered
in two cases. First, we shall consider the case of nonuniform time scaling.
To this end we need the following assumptions and estimates.
Assumption 5.4.1 The inequalities of Assumption 5.3.2 hold true
when the inequality sign is reversed, i.e. ”≤” becomes ”≥”.
Proposition 5.4.1 Under conditions of Assumption 5.4.1 for the ex-
pression (5.3.9) the estimate
D+v(t, x, y, M) ≥uTG(M, P, S)u,
∀(t, x, y, M, P, S) ∈R × Nx0 × Ny0 × M × P × S,

Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
holds true, where uT and G(M, P, S) are deﬁned in the same way as in
Proposition 5.3.5.
The proof is similar to that of Proposition 5.3.5.
Theorem 5.4.1 Let the perturbed motion equations (5.2.5) be such that
all conditions of Assumptions 5.3.1 and 5.4.1 are satisﬁed and
(a) matrices A(M) and B(M) are positive deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, µ∗
i )
and for µi →0, i = 1, 2, . . . , q, where µ∗
i = min {µi1, µi2};
(b) there exists a matrix G(M) which is positive deﬁnite for any µi ∈
(0, µi3) and for µi →0, i = 1, 2, . . ., q, such that for the matrix
G(M, P, S) deﬁned by Proposition 5.3.7 the extimate
G(M, P, S) ≥G(M),
∀(M, P, S) ∈M × P × S.
is satisﬁed.
Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.2.5) is unstable
for any µi ∈(0, µi) and for µi →0 on P × S, where
µi = min {1, µ∗
i , µi3}.
Proof We construct the scalar function v(t, x, y, M) in the same way as
in Section 5.3.1. Under the conditions of Assumption 5.3.1 and by condition
(a) of Theorem 5.3.3 the function v(t, x, y, M) is positive deﬁnite for any
µi ∈(0, µ∗
i ) and for µi →0, i = 1, 2, . . . , q, and admits inﬁnitely small
upper limits on Nx × Ny. The conditions of Assumption 5.3.5, Proposi-
tion 5.3.7 and condition (b) of Theorem 5.3.3 imply that the expression
D+v(t, x, y, M) is a function being positive deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, µi3)
and for µi →0, for every (P, S) ∈P × S. These conditions are known
to be suﬃcient for instability of the equilibrium state of system (5.2.5) for
any µi ∈(0, µi) and for µi →0 on M × P × S.
Remark 5.4.1 By the condition of positive deﬁniteness of the matrices
A(M), B(M) and G(M) the values µi1, µi2 and µi3 are determined re-
spectively, since µi = min {1, µi1, µi2, µi3} is the lower estimate of the
upper boundary of the admissible µi, so that M = {M : 0 < µi < µi, i =
1, 2, . . . , q}.
5.4.2 Uniform time scaling
Assumption 5.4.2 The inequalities of Assumption 5.3.4 hold when
the inequality sign is reversed, i.e. ”≤” becomes ”≥”.
Proposition 5.4.2 Under all conditions of Assumption 5.3.6 for the
expression (5.3.9) the estimate
D+v(t, x, y, µ1) ≥uTCu + µ1uTGu,
∀(t, x, y, µ1, P, S) ∈R × Nx0 × Ny0 × M × P × S,
∀τi ∈[τi, τ i],
takes place, where uT, C, and G are determined as in Proposition 5.3.5.
The proof is similar to that of Proposition 5.3.2.

1 = min {1, −λm(C)λ−1
m (G)}.
The proof follows from the analysis of the inequality
D+v(t, x, y, µ1) ≥uTCu + µ1uTGu ≥(λm(C) + µ1λm(G))u2.
Remark 5.4.1 If in Proposition 5.3.9 λm(G) ≥0, then the expression
D+v(t, x, y, µ1) is positive deﬁnite for any µ1 ∈(0, 1] and for µ1 →0.
Theorem 5.4.2 Let the perturbed motion equations (5.2.5) be such that
all conditions of Assumptions 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 are satisﬁed and
(1) matrices A11, A22, ¯A11, ¯A22 and C are positive deﬁnite;
(2) µ1 ∈(0, µ1), µi = µ1τ −1
i
, τi ∈[τ i, τ i], i ∈[1, r], where
µ1 = min {µ∗
1, µ∗∗
1 , λM( ¯A∗
11) λM( ¯A∗
22) λ−1
M ( ¯A∗
12 ¯A∗T
12 )},
¯A∗
11 = HT
1 ¯A11H,
¯A∗
22 = HT
2 ¯A22H2,
¯A∗
12 = H1 ¯A12H2,
H1 = diag {η1, η2, . . . , ηq},
H2 = diag {ηq+1, ηq+2, . . . , ηs}.
Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.2.5) is unstable on
M × P × S, where M = {M : 0 < µ1 < µ1, µi = µ1τ −1
i
, i = 1, 2, . . . , q}.
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.2.2

Theorem 5.5.1 Let the equations of linear singularly perturbed large-
scale system (5.5.1) be such that for this system it is possible to con-
struct matrix-function (5.3.2) with elements (5.5.3) which satisﬁes esti-
mates (5.5.4) and for the expression (5.5.5) estimate (5.5.6) holds true
and
(1) matrix A(M) is positive deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, µi1) and for µi →
0, i = 1, 2, . . ., q;
(2) matrix G(M) is negative deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, µi2) and for
µi →0, i = 1, 2, . . ., q.
Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.5.1) is structurally
uniformly asymptotically stable in the whole for any µi ∈(0, µi) and for
µi →0 on S, where µi = min {1, µi1, µi2}.
Here µi1 and µi2 are determined by conditions of matrix A(M) positive
deﬁniteness and matrix G(M) negative deﬁniteness respectively.
This theorem is proved in the same manner as Theorem 5.4.1.
Example 5.5.1 Let system (5.5.1) be the 12-th order system n = m = 6
decomposed into three q = r = 3 interconnected singularly perturbed
subsystems determined by the matrices

22 are positive deﬁnite;
(2) matrix C is negative-deﬁnite;
(3) µ1 ∈(0, µ1), µi = µ1τ −1
i

τi ∈[τ i, τ i],
µ1 = min {1, µ∗

In the matrix-function (5.3.2) the elements vij(·) are taken as:
vii(xi) = xT
i Jxi;
v2+i,2+i(yi) = yT
i Jyi,
i = 1, 2;
v12(x1, x2) = xT
1 · 10−1Jx2;
v34(y1, y2) = yT
1 · 10−1y2,
vi,2+j(xi, yj) = xT
i · 10−1Jyj,
i, j = 1, 2,
J = diag {1, 1}.
Obviously, for these elements the following estimates are true
vii(xi) ≥xi2,
i = 1, 2;
v12(x1, x2) ≥−0.1x1 x2;
v2+i,2+i(yi) ≥yi2,

vi,2+j(xi, yj) ≥−0.1xi yj,
i, j = 1, 2.
Let ηT = (1, 1, 1, 1), , then the matrix

is positive deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, 1] and for µ1 →0.
For such choice of the elements of matrix (5.3.2) the elements of the
matrices C and G are speciﬁed as
cii = −1.996,
i = 1, 2;
c12 = 0.6674;
c2+i,2+i = −2.996,
i = 1, 2;
c34 = 0.6474;
c1j = 0, 2874;
c2j = 0.2888,
j = 1, 2;
and
σii = 0;
σ12 = 0.002,
i = 1, 2;
σ2+i,2+i = σ34 = 0.004,
i = 1, 2;
σi3 = 0.312438,
σi4 = 0.311178,
i = 1, 2.
For the elements of the matrices C and G speciﬁed in such way we have
λM(C) = −1.018975;
λM(G) = 0.8819733
and
µ∗∗
1 = min

1, −λM(C)
λM(G)

= min {1; 1.1553354} = 1.
Thus, by Theorem 5.5.2 the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 ∈R8 of the
system deﬁned in Example 5.5.3 is uniformly asymptotically stable in the
whole on M × S8.

Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
5.6 Certain Trends of Generalizations and Applications
In this section general results of this Chapter are applied in two cases. In
Subsection 5.6.1 we present the results of stability analysis for singularly
perturbed large scale Lur’e-Postnikov systems under nonclassical structural
perturbations. A numerical example of the 12-th order system decomposed
into three interconnected singularly perturbed subsystems is considered as
illustration. In Subsection 5.6.2 we establish the conditions of a spacecraft
motion stabilization by means of three gyroframes. Here the possibility of
application of the matrix-valued function is shown and the obtained result
is compared with those obtained in terms of the vector Liapunov function.

The proof of Proposition 5.6.2 is similar to that of Proposition 5.3.2.
Theorem 5.6.1 Let the equations of singularly perturbed Lur’e sys-
tem (5.6.1) be such that the matrix (5.3.2) is constructed with the elements
(5.5.3) satisfying estimates (5.5.4) and for the total Dini derivative of func-
tion (5.3.3) the estimate (5.6.7) is satisﬁed and
(1) matrix A(M) is positive deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, µi1) and for µi →
0, i = 1, 2, . . ., q;
(2) matrix G(M) is negative deﬁnite for any µi ∈(0, µ∗
i2) and for
µi →0, i = 1, 2, . . ., q.
Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.6.1) is uniformly
asymptotically stable for any µi ∈(0, µ∗
i ) and for µi →0 on S, where
µ∗
i = min {1, µi1, µ∗
i2}.
If, moreover, Nix = Rni, Niy = Rmi, , then the equilibrium state
(xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.6.1) is uniformly asymptotically stable in the
whole for any µi ∈(0, µ∗
i ) and for µi →0 on S.
In these relations µi1 and µi2 are determined by the conditions of matrix
A(M) positive deﬁniteness and matrix G(M) negative deﬁniteness respec-
tively.
This theorem is proved by the same method as Theorem 5.3.1.

Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
For the analysis of asymptotic stability of large scale system of Lur’e
type (5.6.8) we construct matrix-function (5.3.7) with elements (5.5.11)
satisfying estimates (5.5.12). For function (5.5.13) the bilateral estimate
(5.6.9)
uTA(µ1)u ≤V (x, y, µ1) ≤uTB(µ1)u,
∀(xi, yj, µ1) ∈Nix0 × Njy0 × M,
∀τi ∈[τi, τ i],
is true, where u, A(µ1) and B(µ1) are determined as in Section 5.3.2.
Assume that ηT = (1, 1, . . . , 1, 1) ∈Rs
+, s = q + r.
Proposition 5.6.3 If for system (5.6.8) the matrix function (5.3.7)
with the elements (5.6.9) is constructed, then for the total derivative of
function (5.3.8) by virtue of system (5.6.8)
(5.6.10)

∀(x, y, µ1, S) ∈Nx0 × Ny0 × M × S,

Proposition 5.6.3 is proved by the immediate calculation of total deriva-
tives of functions (5.6.9) by virtue of system (5.6.8) with their subsequent
estimation from above.
Corollary 5.6.1 If in Proposition 5.6.3 the matrix C∗is negative deﬁnite,
i.e. λM(C∗) < 0 and
(a) λM(G) > 0
or
(b) λM(G) ≥0,
then the function DV (x, y, µ1) is negative deﬁnite
(a) for any µ1 ∈(0, µ1) and for µ1 →0, where
µ1 = min {1, −λM(C∗)/λM(G)},
or
(b) for any µ1 ∈(0, 1] and for µ1 →0 respectively.
Theorem 5.6.2 Let the equations of singularly perturbed LSS of Lur’e
type (5.6.8) be such that for the system the matrix-function (5.3.7) is con-
structed with the elements (5.6.9) satisfying estimates (5.6.10) and for the
total derivative of function (5.3.3) by virtue of system (5.6.8) the correla-
tion (5.6.12) is satisﬁed and
(1) matrices A∗
11 and A∗
22 are positive deﬁnite;
(2) matrix C∗is negative deﬁnite;
(3) µ1 ∈(0, µ1),
µi = τ−1
i
µ1,
i = 1, 2, . . ., r, τi ∈[τ i, τ i],
µ1 =
min {1, µ∗
1, µ1}.
Then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.6.8) is uniformly
asymptotically stable on 
M × S, , where

M = {M : 0 < µ1 < µ1},
µi = τ−1
i
µ1,
i = 1, 2, . . ., r.

Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
If all conditions of Theorem 5.6.2 are satisﬁed for Nix ×Njy = Rni×nj ,
then the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 of system (5.6.8) is uniformly
asymptotically stable in the whole on 
M × S.
Proof The assertion of this theorem follows from Theorem 5.3.2.
Remark 5.6.1 If λM(G) ≤0, then assertion of Theorem 5.6.2 remains
valid for µ1 = min {1, µ∗
1}.
Example 5.6.1 Let system (5.6.1) be the 12-th order system (n = m =
6) of Lur’e type decomposed into three interconnected singularly perturbed
subsystems (q = r = 3) determined by the vectors and matrices (see [Grujic

Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
By Theorem 5.6.2 the equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 ∈R12 of the
system speciﬁed in this example, is absolutely stable on [0, K] × 
M × S,
where
K = diag {2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1},

M = {M : M = diag {µ1, µ2, µ3}, µj ∈(0, 1], ∀j = 1, 2, 3}.
Remark 5.6.3 In monograph by Grujic et al.[1] it was shown that the
equilibrium state (xT, yT)T = 0 ∈R12 of system (5.6.1) is absolutely stable
under nonclassical structural perturbations for µj ∈(0, 0.447], j = 1, 2, 3.
The application of the matrix-valued function extends the domain of the
admissible values of the parameters µj, j = 1, 2, 3, for which stability under
nonclassical structural perturbations occurs.
5.6.2 Stabilization of an orbital apparatus
The objective of the
present study is to apply the method of Liapunov’s matrix functions to
derive new stability conditions for a spacecraft (SC), which is oriented in
inertial space by a control system with executive devices in the form of
three gyroscopic frames.

Stability Theory of Large-Scale

Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
5.6.2.1 Mathematical model of the system
It is assumed that a spacecraft
represents a solid with principal central moments of inertia J1, J2 and J3,
the precession axes of the gyroscopic frames are directed along the principal
axes of the spacecraft, the elements of the gyrostabilizer (GS) are perfectly
rigid, and the gyroscopes of each pair are identical and have constant speeds
of self-rotation. Let γi be the airborne angles determining the orientation of
the spacecraft, pi be the projections of the angular velocity of the spacecraft
onto the body axes, αi be the precession angle, A′
i be the moment of inertia
of each gyroshroud (with a rotor) about the axis of self-rotation, B′
i be the
moment of inertia of each gyroscope about the precession axis, C′
i be the
equatorial moment of inertia of each gyroshroud (with the rotor), and H′
i be
the intrinsic moment of momentum of the gyroscopes of the gyroframe Γi.
Assuming that A′
i = C′
i, we obtain for the SC–GS system the system of
equations of motion (for the details see Abdullin et al. [1] and the references
therein)

and Mi is the projection of the disturbing moment acting on the spacecraft
on the axis Oxi, Mπ is the moment created by the gyroscope unloading
system, bi is the coeﬃcient of viscous friction in the precession axis, Myi is
the control moment created by the torque sensor (TS), and Mαi is the
disturbing moment along the precession axis.
The above assumptions are not exactly realized in real structures, and
this leads to the occurence in system (5.6.11) of additional inertial, gyro-
scopic, and other moments as disturbing factors. It is assumed that their
action is reduced in some way to moments that enter the expressions for
Mi and Mαi as addends and can be estimated satisfactorily. Apart from
the mentioned moments, Mi also includes moments of external forces, re-
active moments, and moments due to the debalance of GS rotors, and Mαi
includes moments of dry friction, moments of dynamic debalance of rotors,
and other moments in the TS [1].
The necessity of allowing for GS unloading arises when a prescribed
orientation of a spacecraft should be maintained for a long time.

accepted that unloading is relized by the law

is suﬃciently small.
The control moment Myi is formed based on information obtained from
angle sensors (AS) γi and angular-velocity sensors (AVS) pi and ˙αi. A con-
trol in the form
Myi = fi(αi)(K1iγi + K2ipi) −K3i ˙αi
for ideal TS, AS, and AVS is considered qualitative.
Using the actual characteristics of the sensors, we can determine Myi
from the equations
Ti ˙Myi + Myi = Fi(σi),
σi = fi(αi)(F1i(γi) + F2i(pi)) −F3i( ˙αi),
where Ti is the time constant of the control circuit of the gyroframes Γi
and fi(αi) = sec αi or fi(αi) ≡1; Fi(σi) and Fji(xi) are the nonlinear
characteristics of the TS, AS, and AVS, which vary in time, are ambiguous

other nonlinearities of the static characteristics of both the sensor itself
and ampliﬁers, noise in the ampliﬁers, errors and quantization in computa-
tional devices, etc. The quantity σ∗

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Theorem 5.6.3 Let LMF (5.6.15) with elements (5.6.16) be construc-
ted for system (5.6.14) and, for this system, condition (5.6.22) be satisﬁed
in domain (5.6.12).
If λm(B) > 0, λM(K) < 0, and the vector w =
(∥x1∥, ∥x2∥, ∥x3∥, ∥x4∥)T satisﬁes inequality (5.6.21), then the motion of
system (5.6.14) is asymptotically stable.
Proof From the condition λm(B) > 0, it follows that scalar function
(5.6.18) is positive-deﬁnite in the sense of Liapunov.
If the condition
λM(K) < 0 and inequality (5.6.21) are satisﬁed, then the total derivative
of function (5.6.18) will be negative deﬁnite by virtue of system (5.6.14). As
is known, these conditions are suﬃcient for the motion of system (5.6.14)
to be asymptotically stable.

Stability Theory of Large-Scale  
Dynamical Systems
225 
Singularly Perturbed Large-Scale Systems
5.6.2.4 Conclusion remarks
The stability conditions for a spacecraft for-
mulated in Theorem 5.6.3 are consistent with the conditions of the Lia-
punov’s like Theorem on asymptotic stability of motion. Namely, in this
theorem, auxiliary function (5.6.18) constructed on the basis of matrix-
valued function (5.6.15) is applied, and the conditions of its deﬁnite nega-
tivity are established.
Thus, the method of matrix-valued functions allows us to take into ac-
count all features of the system under consideration and the cross links
between subsystems and does not require constructing a comparison sys-
tem, which happens when Liapunov’s vector function is used (see Abdullin
et al. [1], p. 227).
Note that the application of comparison systems to analysis of motion
stability is inevitably associated with a certain type of its quasimonotonicity
(otherwise, the appropriate comparison theorems are not applicable). It
is well known that the quasimonotonicity of a system is not a necessary
condition of the stability of its trivial solution. Also, it is well known that
the property of quasimonotonicity is not associated with the essence of a
stability problem but is due to the key feature of the comparison method
used.
The method of Liapunov’s matrix functions for the system (5.6.14) al-
lows us to keep all the advantages of Liapunov’s direct method without
introducing into it side conditions that are not characteristic of this ﬂexible
method.
5.7 Notes and References
Section 5.1
The results of stability analysis of solutions for the given class of
systems in terms of vector functions are presented in Gruji´c et al. [1]. In this
chapter we use some results from the above monograph and set out the results
of development of a new method of qualitative analysis of singularly perturbed
systems dynamics in terms of auxiliary matrix-valued functions. In the frame-
work of this approach we succeed in reducing the requirement to the individual
subsystems of system F and extending the boundaries of the admissible upper
values of small parameters as compared to those obtained or/and applied in terms
of the vector Liapunov function.
Section 5.2
In this section we use the same models of singularly perturbed
system under nonclassical structural perturbations as in Gruji´c et al. [1], but
in the mathematical composition of large scale system for the given model of
connectedness.
Sections 5.3 – 5.4
These two sections are based on the results by Martynyuk and
Miladzhanov [4, 5, 9], and Miladzhanov [4, 5].
Section 5.5
Some results of this section are presented by Martynyuk and Mi-
ladzhanov [9].
Section 5.6
Subsection 5.6.1 is based on the papers by Martynyuk and Mi-
ladzhanov [9, 10]. Also some estimates from Section 5.5 are used.
Section 5.6.2 is based on the paper by Martynyuk and Miladzhanov [8]. Be-
sides, we employ some results by Voronov and Matrosov (Eds.) [1] who applied
the vector Liapunov function in the solution of the problem.
