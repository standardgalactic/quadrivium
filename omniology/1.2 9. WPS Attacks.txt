WPS Attacks

• WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup
• Allows users to easily connect devices to a 
secure Wi-Fi network without the need to 
manually enter the network password
• Aimed at non-technical users
• 2 options:
 
Push Button Configuration (PBC)
 
Personal Identification Number (PIN)
• There are 2 WPS version (1 and 2)
WPS Attacks
(Overview)

• Not exploitable unless attacker has physical 
access to the Access Point
• Would require social engineering or an 
insider threat to gain physical access to the 
Access Point
• When button is pushed on AP a number is 
sent to the client (vendor specific) 
• Often an 8-digit number where first 4 are 
vendor hard-coded and only last 4 change 
(i.e. 10,000 combinations)
WPS Attacks
(Push Button)

• Some implementations (version 1) are 
brute-forceable 
• Version 2 implements logouts to break brute 
force attempts
• Common tools:
wash
bettercap
reaver
bully
WPS Attacks
(PIN Code attacks)

wash -i wlan1
Bettercap
wifi.show.wps all
WPS Attacks
(Commands to show WPS)

bully -h
bully wlan1 -b <BSSID> -e NameofSSID -c 9
reaver  -i wlan0mon -b <BSSID> -S -v
wlan0mon is the name of our wireless device in 
monitor mode
BSSID is the MAC address of the AP we are 
attacking
