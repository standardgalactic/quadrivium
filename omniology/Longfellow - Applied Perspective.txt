PREFACE
The practice
of
perspective depends
not so much on many principles
as on the
varied applications of a few.
It is easy to acquire enough
for every-day use
:
the skil-
ful draughtsman
is he who has gained an instinctive readiness of resource that fits him
to meet a variety of exigencies as they arise.
In writing this book
I have had in mind
both the every-day use and the skilled use.
In the first Part I have given what seemed
necessary to qualify the student for ordinary perspective work, and in the second have
included a series
of special problems, to show what trained draughtsmen actually do.
To these I have added discussions
of some more
theoretical
topics— the perspective
of oblique planes, the tangents and axes
of
circles, tri-conjugate vanishing points —
which should be of value to students to whom perspective is a study interesting in itself,
and should smooth the way to the more complicated problems that sometimes occur.
Feeling the paramount importance of what may be called the perspective sense, the
faculty of perceiving perspective relations in what
is before one in nature or in imagina-
tion, I have taken
pains
to
set
forth these relations as they appear to the eye, and to
show how they influence the painter's or the architect's way of looking at things.
He
who has such
a sense
will
find
it easy to acquire the various special devices and the
instinct which he needs for the exigencies of practice.
He who lacks
it will make hard
labor of mastering any but the most obvious
processes, and will always be liable to be
blocked
in his work by an unusual problem.
The processes and devices are so abun-
dant, offer so many ways of saving labor and
securing precision, that the adept differs
from
the ordinary draughtsman
as
the
skilled watchmaker from
the workman who
knows only enough
to
oil
a
Connecticut clock.
Out of this abundance
I have tried
to furnish enough for the
student's needs, and to suggest
to him how to increase his
resources if he will.
For students who wish for a full theoretical account of the science of perspective I
know no treatise in English so good as Professor Ware's Modern Perspective
:
I hope
that this book will put the application of
it into serviceable shape without injustice tp
its scientific side.
In the discussions I have not undertaken
to adhere to the rigorous
forms
of
theoretical mathematics, to get on
with the fewest possible
postulates, but
rather to assume as much as seemed safe of the common stock of knowledge.
A fair
acquaintance with ordinary school geometry is taken for granted, and the mathematical
demonstrations are meant to be clear and exact
; yet
I have hoped that an intelligent
458

PREFACE
and careful reader who does not know geometry may find profit in the book, and learn
what is fundamental in
it without unreasonable eiTort.
I have tried to give
it a plan
and development that suited
this purpose.
As for the problems, the discussions, and
the methods, there are some things
in them which
I do not see elsewhere ; whether
they are really mine, and whether they have any value, other men can best judge.

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
INTRODUCTION
PERSPECTIVE IN NATURE
As we look out over sea or plain the earth seems to end in the sharp level line which
we call
the
horizon.
This horizon
is in appearance just
at
the level of our eyes, and
always remains so.
It
is
a commonly noted phenomenon
that, being on a level with
our eyes,
it
rises with
us.
If we go to the house-top or to the masthead,
it
is still
at
our level.
People who go up in balloons say that this appearance
is so marked that the
land or sea beneath them looks like a saucer, the middle being visible far below them,
while the edges look as high
as themselves.
When we see the whole horizon we see a
circle or hoop about us, but
it is a circle or hoop seen from the centre, of which only a
small part is seen or considered at once, and every part of
it looks like a straight line.
Some curious consequences
follow.
If two persons
separate, one going up and
the
other down, the horizon seems
to
the one
to rise, to
the other
to sink, and
to follow
their motions, so that each may be said
to have
his own
horizon, and
to carry it with
him.
The
position
of
the
horizon
therefore shows the observer's
level
: he can
tell
exactly what part of any building or other object before him
is at
the height of
his eye
by noting where the horizon crosses
it.
One who stands on a field of
ice covered with
skaters may notice that all
their heads, at whatever distance, being substantially at the
level of his own, form a band at the height of the horizon, while their feet, owing to the
diminishing effect of
distance, appear at
all
sorts of
levels.
This effect, as of people
strung on a rope passed through their eyes, while their feet dangle and kick at different
heights, comes too near
the ludicrous for pictoriiil use, and painters instinctively avoid
representing a collection of
figures at
different distances at the
level of the spectator.
If one overlooks a plain below him, the head of any person on that
plain, near or far,
will come below the
horizon, and any head
that comes above
it must be the head of a
giant.
If he looks out upon the sea, all the vessels upon
it will be cut by the horizon at
the same number
of
feet above
the water (Plate I).
If they are vessels
of uniform
height, when he stands as high as the mast-head every mast-head will touch the horizon.
Yet
it is not uncommon
to see a marine painting
in which near vessels are below the
horizon, and distant ones rise above
it, irrespective of their size.
I have seen a picture
painted in this impossible way for the French Salon, and by a clever artist.*
1 There is a theoretical exception in what
is called the dip of the horizon, due to the curvature of the
earth's surface, whereby vessels which are just disappearing over the horizon do seem to rise
till their
hulls come above
it and then sink again behind
it
; but ships in this position can hardly be seen without
a glass, and are not subjects for pictures.
The exception occurs because, the surface of the water being
convex, and not a plane, the visible horizon
is not exactly as high as the geometrical horizon of a plane
would be
;
this difference is one of the invisibly small things which are neglected.

2
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
The horizon, being a definite line, determinable even when
it
is
invisible, invariable
in direction, and an index of the relative position of the view and the beholder, is
nat-
urally the cardinal
line or horizontal dividing axis in any perspective view, — the com-
pass, as
it were, of the perspective draughtsman, for a perspective drawing
is simply a
record of the effect of relative position on the aspect of certain things.
The factors of
this effect are the angle at which things are seen and
the
distance.
The study of the
effect of the angle would be comparatively simple
if it were not complicated by that of
distance.
The
fact that the farther off things are the smaller they look needs no illus-
tration, but the results of this in their aspect give room for study.
Not only do distant
objects look smaller than
if they were near, but their farther parts look smaller in
pro-
portion than the nearer;
the apparent pioportions of the objects
are changed, that
is,
they are distorted, and the study of perspective
is mainly the study of such distortions.
The more distant windows of a building look smaller than the nearer; the farther side
of a square seems shorter than the
nearer, so
that
in most
positions the square does
not look square.
It
is not uncommon for persons who are offended by some extreme
case of this sort to speak with annoyance of the distortions of perspective, as
if
it were
a human invention, and to be discredited by them.
But
perspective
is
in
nature.
It
always
distorts;
vision, which
is simply unrecorded
perspective,
always
distorts, and
the distortions, so far from
being on
the whole
faults, are
the source of most
of
the
pleasure that we take in the forms of things that we look
at.
It
is they that change the
circle into
the more
graceful
curve
of the
ellipse, and
give the varying
skyline
to
a
building
: they give the interest and charm
that an
artist
finds
in foreshortening, and
substitute variety, life, and endless change in
all we see for the monotony and tameness
of geometric views.
But some of the distortions are becoming and some unbecoming.
Extreme distortions
are
usually better avoided, and
in
objects whose
proportions will
not bear alteration artists are careful to make the point of view so distant that the
dif-
ference between
the nearer and farther parts does not greatly count, and avoid such a
difficulty as we sometimes see in a photograph where the hands look too large because
the camera was too close.
The distinction between mere diminution from
distance, and
foreshortening, which
is diminution from obliquity of view,
is not to be forgotten here.
If we stand in front
of a square or circle,
its plane being at right angles to our line of vision,
it looks like a
square or circle at any distance
:
it may grow larger or smaller, but
its
proportions do
not change.
If we look at
it obliquely, the farther parts diminish more than the nearer,
the lines that are seen obliquely more than those that are seen squarely, and the shape
is distorted.
This is foreshortening
:
it
is the most characteristic phenomenon of vision
and perspective.
How does this foreshortening take effect, and how is it to be recorded ?
Another phenomenon of perspective gives the key to this question.
If we watch a bird flying straight into the distance, we see as
it gets far off that
it
scarcely seems
to change
its
position, but
at
last grows dim, and disappears without
apparent motion.
If we could turn a telescope exactly in the direction of its flight, we
could cover beforehand the point where
it would vanish, and in due time
it would come
into viev/, and disappear in the axis of the telescope.
In
the same way every straight
line, which may if we please be considered as the path of a moving object, has its place
of disappearance, which we
call
its vanishing
point, and
this point may be found by

PERSPECTIVE
IN NATURE

looking into the distance in the direction in which the line itself runs— that
is, parallel
to
it.
It follows naturally that
if looking in the same direction we change our position,
the vanishing point moves with us, like a star or like the horizon, and
is still before us.
If we look down a long straight street, we see the vanishing point of the house-cornices
before us on our side of the street.
If we cross the street, it follows and is on the other
side (Plate
II).
Two other interesting consequences follow
:
First,
if several
lines
are
parallel, they
have the same vanishing point, for they have
but one
direction, and
but one
straight
line can lead from the eye in that direction to find a vanishing point.
In fact,
it
is one
of the commonly noticed phenomena of vision that parallel
lines seem
to tend
to the
same
point.
We see
this
in
the
rails of a straight railway, in those of a long straight
street
: we may prove by geometrical reasoning tliat
it must
be
so.
Second, as every
line has
in common
phrase two
ends, that
is, has two opposite directions, so
it must
have two opposite vanishing points, a hemisphere apart.
When we look
in
the
direc-
tion
of a system
of
parallel
lines, and
see
their vanishing point before
us,
there
is
another vanishing point behind us
in
exactly the opposite
direction.
We may distin-
guish both vanishing points sometimes in the shadows that are thrown
across the sky
by broken clouds at sunset, one being the sun
itself, and the other at exactly the oppo-
site point, just below the eastern horizon.
We shall have to consider coupled vanishing
points when we
discuss
curvilinear
perspective,
but
in
ordinary problems
these
are
eliminated, the point of view being considered unchangeable.
It
is to be noticed how fast foreshortening increases upon a line as
it retires from us,
so that
if
it
is prolonged indefinitely in
its distant part, miles will at last be condensed
into the compass of a dot.
The
effect on
a plane
is
similar, and
it
is
this extreme
foreshortening
of
the distant parts that gives character to many landscapes.
Looking
out over open water we see that the first quarter or eighth covers most of the view, and
the far distance
is crowded
into
a very narrow compass.
In
a
fleet
the
distant ships
seem huddled
together, and
the waves, which
near
at hand show a network
of open
lines, are compressed far off into close horizontal wrinkles that give the water
its
level
look.
So
in an open meadow a
river shows broad where
it runs away from us, but
where
it crosses the view
is reduced to a ribbon or thread, and
its
far-off windings are
shut up like a lazy-tongs into close
zigzags, or compressed
into nothing for the most
part, coming into sight only at
the
turns
; and so
the
outlines of masses
of trees are
condensed as
if by pressure into lines almost
horizontal.
In
painting such views
the
effect of space and
distance, and
the impression of repose that attends
it depend, so
far as drawing goes, on rightly seizing this compression and
horizontality of lines; and
it is one of the difficulties of the tyro to realize their degree and importance.
So
it
is
with the
sky, which
a painter not seldom conceives as a curtain hung up before him,
instead of a roof under which he looks.
Only the lowermost remote part of the sky is
usually painted, and here, when
it is clouded, we are looking into an opening, perhaps
a quarter of a mile high, that extends away miles into
the
distance.
This
effect
of a
retreating roof is often striking, though much overlooked.
It
is not only lines* that vanish
: planes also have their definite visual limit beyond
1 The word line, unqualified, is understood to mean a straight line, except where
it
is applied to some-
thing that is obviously not straight.

4
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
which they cannot pass, and the limit of
the plane
is a
line, as
that of the
line
is
a
point.
The horizon
is simply the vanishing line of the (approximately) level surface of
the earth or sea.
It is the far-off verge of the horizontal plane that passes through the
eye, and
as we have seen,
it follows the eye as does the vanishing point of a line.
As
parallel
lines seem
to meet
in
the
distance, so do
parallel planes
; and
as the lines
apparently meet in their vanishing point, so do parallel planes
in
their vanishing
line.
All
parallel
planes have
the same vanishing
line.
This may be proved by geometry,
and verified by observation, as in the case of lines
:
I
shall
not stop here for the geo-
metrical
proof.
Everybody sees
that the sea and sky .seem
to meet
in the horizon,
that the walls of a street, the sides of a tunnel, the roof and floor of a long gallery tend
to the same thing, and would appear to come together,
if they were long enough and
straight enough,
like the
rails
of a railway.
So,
for
instance,
all
horizontal planes
vanish in the horizon.
Naturally any lines that lie in a plane must vanish where the plane vanishes ; other-
wise they would pass out of the
plane.
A plane may be conceived
to consist
of the
lines that
lie in
it, just as a woven cloth consists of the
threads
that
lie
in
it.
Where
the threads end the cloth must end, and where the lines vanish the plane must vanish.
Since planes extend indefinitely in all directions, the vanishing line of every plane, like
the
horizon, extends
all round the celestial sphere, and is a great circle of it; but like
the horizon
it appears straight, and only a small portion of
it
is included
in
a picture.
As the vanishing point of a line is found by looking in its direction, that
is, parallel to
it, the vanishing line of a plane
is found by looking
parallel
to
it, and
is
the
line
in
which
a visual plane
parallel
to
it cuts what
is
called the celestial sphere, — that is to
say, what the sky would be
if the earth could be removed and the sky left for us to see,
below as well
as
above.
These
principles, simple
as
they
are, are
often
violated
in
practice, and we may see
in
the same
picture the
horizontal
lines
of houses, which
should vanish in the horizon, pointing higher and lower, as if the scene had been warped
by an earthquake, or, worse yet, lines at the surface of still water or
parallel to
it, such
as those of piers, are made to vanish above or below the horizon.

PROJECTION
We see all objects by rays of light that come from every point of them
to the pupil
of the
eye.
The paths of these rays are a series of straight lines, which we call visual
lines, and all meet practically in a point which is the position of the eye, and is named
the Station Point.
When we hold up a sheet of glass between the eye and an
object,
we see against the glass what is called a projection of the object, making a picture.
If
we could shoot needles from the eye point or Station Point through the glass at all the
limiting points of the object, the paths of the needles would be the visual lines of these
points, the
perforations in the glass would be their projections, defining the projection
of the object.
If we connected the perforations by the proper lines on the glass, these
lines would outline a picture of the object as it appeared from the Station Point, and this
is exactly what rays of light are made to do in photographing.
Years ago a wanderer appeared at Harvard College who tried to introduce an appara-
tus and
a process by which anybody could sketch without learning.
The apparatus
was a sheet of glass slipped
into an upright frame, and a fixed eyepiece, which was
simply a wooden standard with a hole in
it.
The process was to set up the apparatus
before
the view, and
trace the picture by a pen and ink with which he contrived
to
draw lines on
the glass, keeping the eye at the eyepiece so as to maintain the point of
view.
The contrivance helped no one
to draw, but
it was
a good
illustration
of the
underlying process
of perspective, or
of sketching, which
is drawing
in
perspective.
For a true sketch or perspective drawing is only a copy on paper of such
a
tracing, or
projection, as is thrown on the glass.
The fixed eyepiece marks the
Station
Point of
the artist, which must not be changed, for the view will change with
it
; the glass plate
represents the surface on which the view is thrown, which must also be immovable, or
the representation will alter both in shape and position on the paper.
Every, scene or
object that is drawn
is projected, that
is, cast upon a flat surface, as
if by such a pro-
cess as this.
When we draw something which
is before us, we practically look upon
it
as seen through a window, and
transfer to the paper on
our
table, or to the sketch-
book on our knee, the projection
of the scene upon
the glass of the window.
This
process of projection
is in most cases unconsidered, but
it is really behind what we are
doing, and to recognize
it adds clear-
ness
to our sight as
well
as
to our
understanding.
In studying Perspec-
tive we have to consider that we draw
things
as
they are seen
against
an
imaginary plane
set up
in
front
of
them, and
that our picture only
re-
peats what is thrown as by a camera
upon this plane.
Fig.
I represents an object AB, say a square of pasteboard, projected in this way as

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
seen from
the
Station Point .S upon
the plane
surface CD.
The projections ab
are
the pictures of AB ; the plane surfaces on which they are projected are called the
Pic-
ture Plane.
The farther off the picture plane from tlie eye, and the nearer to the object,
the larger the picture,
till when the picture plane stands against the object, the picture
is as large as the object, and if the plane passes behind
it, the picture
is larger than the
object.
The picture seems to the eye at S to cover the object in each case exactly.
Again,
if we should
stretch
threads from
the
Station
Point to the
principal points
of an object, as AS, BS, etc., these threads would form the skeleton of a pyramid, or,
as
it is roughly called, a visual cone, inclosing the object (Fig.
2), and
if
slips
of mica
or paper were
fitted
in between the
threads and the lines of the object, as
at ABS, BCS, etc., they would make
-
-
.
,
the faces of
the pyramid, of which
6'
_..---
* ^
would be the vertex and ABCD the
base.
If now we should
slice away
the
farther
part
of
the pyramid by
cutting it across, as at abed, we should
have a section in which every point and
line corresponded
in
its reduced scale to the
answering point or line in the object ABCD, and the plane of a^C(/ would be the picture
plane
in
that
position.
If we could pass an inked roller over the lines of the section
abed, we might print from
it on a sheet of paper the outlines of such a picture as would
be projected on the picture plane in that
position.
A second nearer section at a'b'c'd'
would give the smaller picture that would be projected on a picture plane in that position.
Thus
it appears that a picture of any object
is
its visual projection upon a plane set
between the object and the eye
of the
spectator, and that any point A
is projected by
a visual line AS which
pierces the picture plane
in
the corresponding point a or a' of
the picture.
We may say then, to sum up
: —
An
object
represented
in
perspective
is conceived to be projected upon
a picture
plane by visual lines and planes, converging to the Station Point from its several points
and lines.
These visual lines and planes form the perspective pyramid or cone which envelops
the object, and has its vertex at the Station Point.
The perspective picture
is
the section of this perspective cone by the picture plane.
The
size
of
the
picture depends
on
the
position
of
the picture plane, increasing
in
proportion as that
is set farther from
tlie Station
Point.
Our imaginary picture plane
may be
interposed
at any distance, and will
give
a
series of
different
projections,
all
similar, but varying
in
size with
the
distances, just
as
parallel
slices cut from a cone
give a series of similar sections.
The
picture we draw
is
a copy on paper of the perspective picture at any scale we
please.
To construct
it we determine
geometrically
the
intersections
of the
visual
lines and planes with the picture plane, by reference
to certain
fixed lines and
points.
The most direct and natural way is to take
these intersections from plans or side views
(elevations)
of
the objects and visual cones
;
yet for complicated pictures
shorter and
simpler means have been devised, as will appear later.
To reduce these considerations to practice and put on paper our copy of a scene as

PROJECTION
7
we see
it projected on the picture plane, we must have some fixed line of direction, some
starting point by which to place things.
We have already seen
that the horizon is the
natural horizontal axis of our view
:
it
is universally used as such in perspective draw-
ings.
The line which
is to represent
it on the paper we call the Horizon Line, and we
draw
it at a convenient height, giving room for what we have to put above and below
it.
This Horizon Line marks the level of our eye in the picture, and that we may have a
definite point by which to
fix distances
to
right and
left, we choose the point in that
line which
is directly opposite
the eye as we look at the view, and we mark a point for
it which
fixes the position
of the view on
the paper.
This point we
call the Centre.
Since the
picture plane and the paper which represents
it
are assumed
to front us
exactly, the Centre is the point where a perpendicular
' from our eye pierces the paper,
and stands
for that in which one
pierces the
picture
plane.
It
is the centre of our
view, but may or not be put
in the middle of our picture, for we may choose to show
more of one side of the view than of the other.
It will be seen at once that the position
of the eye must not change with respect to either the view or the
picture, and
that
to
see the
picture
rightly the eye must be exactly opposite
the
Centre, at what we have
called
the
Station
Point.
The
line which joins the
Station
Point
and
the
Centre,
necessarily perpendicular to the
picture,
is called the Axis.
(This special geometrical
use of the word is to be distinguished from
the general sense in which
it has just been
applied to the Horizon Line.)
A horizontal plane
is commonly assumed
at
the bottom of a picture, corresponding
with the
floor or
level ground when
there
is such
in
the view, and upon
this
plane,
called the Ground Plane, the positions of objects are conveniently laid out.
Its
inter-
section with
the
picture plane
is
usually the bottom of the
picture, and
is called
the
Ground Line, and
it
is
a
useful line on which to take the measures by which positions
are determined.
If the
spectator
is conceived to stand on the floor or ground of the
view, he stands on
the Ground Plane, and
the Ground Line marks in the picture
the
level of his feet, as the Horizon Line does that of the eye.
From the foregoing discussion we deduce the following fundamental postulates
: —
The vanishing point of any line
is seen by looking in the direction of the line, that is,
parallel to
it, and so appears
in
the
picture plane where a visual
line
parallel
to
that
line pierces thej)icture plane.
All parallel lines have the same vanishing point.
The vanishing
line of a plane
is seen by looking in the direction of the plane, that
is, parallel to
it, and so appears in the picture plane where a visual plane parallel to the
given plane cuts the picture plane.
A line in any plane vanishes in the vanishing line of that plane.
All parallel planes have the same vanishing line.
The Horizon Line
is at the
level of the observer's eye.
It
is
the vanishing
line of
all horizontal planes, and in
it are the vanishing points of all horizontal lines.
The fixed lines -and points that belong to the picture are these
:—
The Horizon Line represents the visible horizon.
The position of the observer's eye is called the Station Point.
1 The extraordinary misuse
of
the word
perpendicular which
is common makes
it proper to
recall
here that
it means at right angles, and not upright.

8
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
The point in the picture exactly opposite the Station Point is called the Centre, and
is in the Horizon Line.
The
line
that joins
the
Station Point and the Centre
is
called the Axis.
It
is a
visual
line
perpendicular to the picture plane ; and the Centre is, therefore, the van-
ishing point of all lines that are perpendicular to that plane.
Lines
that
are
perpendicular to the
picture plane
are called Perpendiculars.
In
perspective all Perpendiculars are horizontal, and parallel to the Axis.
The horizontal
plane
at the bottom
of a picture is called the Ground
Plane.
Its
intersection with the picture is called the Ground Line.*
1 The word line, unqualified, means a straight line.
The adjective perpendicular means at right angles
:
upright lines are called vertical.

PRACTICE
For our first problem let us make a perspective view of a standing screen of two
blades, open at any angle (Fig. 4).
For convenience' sake we will assume the
picture
plane PF to be set against the salient angle of the screen, as shown in the plan (Fig. 3)^
so that the vertical edge (/(/shall appear in the picture plane
in
its
real
size, being, as
it were,
its own perspective, and shall
be so shown
in our drawing, according
to
the
scale which we
adopt, which
shall be that of the plan. PPm the plan represents the
upright picture plane, as seen from above, 6' the position of the spectator, — the Station
Point,— and acb the plan of the screen with its vertical edge in the
picture plane
at
c.
In the perspective (Fig. 4), we assume
the
level on which
the screen stands for the
ground
plane, and taking a horizontal
line
for the Ground Line, draw a second hori-
zontal HHkox the Horizon Line at whatever distance above
it
is suitable.
If we con-
ceive
the spectator and the screen to be standing on the same level floor, the Horizon
Line, being at the height of his eye, will be, say, five feet above the ground line, accord-
ing to the scale of the picture.
Then setting the point c conveniently on HH, we draw
a vertical line through
it to the Ground Line zXf, and up till/^/ is equal to the height x
given for the screen.
Then_/^ will represent the upright edge of the screen in its proper
place and scale.
The lines ca and cb (Fig. 3) at the bottom
of the
screen, being
hori-
zontals, will have vanishing points in HH where visual lines parallel to these lines meet
the picture plane.
From ^ then, in the plan, we draw two
lines right and
left, — SV
parallel to cb and 5 F parallel
to ca, — meeting the
picture plane
in V and
V, which
will be the required vanishing points.
We transfer them to Fig. 4 by setting off on the
Horizon Line the corresponding distances cF and cV.
The
lines /FandyF', drawn
to these points, represent the lower edges of the screen prolonged
till they disappear in
their vanishing
points.
The upper edges, being respectively parallel XofVand/V,
must have the same vanishing points, and so may be drawn from d as dV and dV.
It
remains only to cut
off these upper and
lower edges
at the
right lengths.
Now the
extreme points a and b at the base of the screen in the plan will be projected by visual
lines aS and bS, and will appear in the picture plane
at a' and b\ at distances a'c and
Vc left and right from
c.
Transferring these distances to the perspective drawing, we
get a' and b' on each side oifd.
Vertical lines from a' and b' will cut/Fand fV, dV
and dV
at the proper distances from y and d, and will give the
vertical edges of the
screen.
The figure agdhbf is
its true perspective outline.

DISTANCE POINTS
To DRAW TWO WALLS ON LEVEL GROUND, with returns
at right angles to the picture
plane and parallel to each other (Fig.
5).
Let the walls be assumed
to be in the same
plane, which we take for the picture plane, as in the plan (Fig. 5 a).
The return walls
are of equal length.
The corners of the walls, a and
b, being in the
picture plane, are
their own
perspectives.
Suppose that the Centre C comes between the two walls, and
let ^ in the plan be the Station Point, SC being the Axis
:
let x represent the height of
the walls.
For convenience of comparison we set the plan directly over the perspective.
GG is the Ground Line, Hlf, above
it at a suitable distance, the Horizon Line, and we
put the Centre C directly under
its projection on the plan.
Then the perspectives of
a and b, coming directly under them, can be projected downward upon GG in a and b.
Measuring off ag and bh in the perspective equal to x, we have the corners of the walls in
their proper height.
The bottom lines will be right and left on GG, and the top lines,
in
like manner, will be horizontal lines drawn right and left from g and k.
Since the
return walls are at right angles to the picture plane, their
top and bottom
lines, which
we assume
to be
level, like those of the front walls, will be Perpendiculars, and must
vanish
in
C.
We may accordingly draw aC, bC, gC, and kC;
it remains only
to cut
them off at the right points.
In the plan the extreme points d and/" are projected into
the picture plane by the visual lines dS a.nAfS at d' and/'.
We have only to project
these down upon //and /"(which is equivalent to measuring off the distances Cd' and Cf)
in the perspective lines aC and bC by verticals which will cut off all the vanishing lines
at the right points, and give the vertical lines at the ends
of
the walls, completing the
perspective construction.
It will be seen that some of the lines of the plan are allowed
to cross the perspective, not because they are any part
of
it, but only for the sake
of
compactness in placing the figures.
When objects are so situated, like
the walls
in the
last problem, that the
principal
lines either are parallel to the picture, or are perpendicular
to
it and
therefore vanish
in the Centre, they are said to be in Parallel Perspective.
This
is the simplest kind of
perspective, having only one vanishing
point, the
Centre, and
allowing the
lines and
surfaces which are parallel to the picture plane to be represented
in
their true forms
and proportions, and
if they are in that plane, in their true size.
To DRAW
A
HORIZONTAL SQUARE WITH
ITS FRONT
EDGE
IN THE PICTURE PLANE.
Let oa be a horizontal
line
in
the
picture plane (Fig. 6), the Ground Line or another,
in which lies the side ab of the
required square. HH is the Horizon Line and C the
Centre.
We may as before use a plan, which, to save space, we make on half the scale
of the perspective.
On FF, the projection of the picture plane, we construct the square
abed, half as large as the required square.
The sides ac and bd being Perpendiculars will
in the perspective vanish to the centre C on the lines aC and bC.
The points c and d
may be found as in
the preceding problems by projecting them upon FF in the plan,


I

DISTANCE POINTS

transferring them to the perspective on ab, and drawing vertical lines to carry them up
to aC and bC, taking care
to measure
off double distances on
the perspective.
The
side cd, parallel to ab, will remain so in the perspective
if the construction is correct, for
it is parallel to the picture plane, and so only one point c ox dxs necessary.
But in the
plan the diagonal ad passing through d cuts off the side bd at d, and
if we could draw
this diagonal
in
perspective,
it would give us at once the
point
d, through which we
might draw cd parallel to ab, and finish the square without projecting the points c and d
from the plan.
Moreover,
if we draw other squares beside
the
first, as bdig and gikh,
the diagonals being parallel, one vanishing point will give them all in perspective.
This
vanishing point, being where a visual line parallel to the diagonals
pierces the
picture
plane,
is projected on the plan by drawing SD parallel to ad or bi.
Transferring
it to
the perspective, we
set
off CD equal
to
twice CD
in the
plan, and laying off succes-
sively bg and gh equal to ab, draw the lines aD, bD, and gD.
Then ad, passing through
the point d, must verify the previous construction.
The other diagonals will mark the
points i and k, on the
lines ^Cand hC, which we
shall draw to the
centre, they being
the perspectives
of the sides gi and hk.
The farther
sides cd, di, and ik will all be in
the straight line drawn through the point c or d parallel to ab.
By this construction the perspective might have been drawn without any plan at
all
;
for
it was only necessary to determine C and D, besides
the
line
ab, to have
all
the
needed data.
The first square might have been determined, like the others, by simply
drawing aD, which would have cut
off the side bd on the perpendicular bC.
The dis-
tance CD, being the
length
of the axis, might have been laid off at once on HH, and
the plan dispensed with.
If we had several squares laid together, as in a tiled floor, all the diagonals would be
either parallel or continuous,
all vanishing together
in
the vanishing point D, and
all
the
sides, perpendicular and vanishing
to
the centre, would be cut off by these diago-
nals, which would be sufficient for the whole construction.
Thus in Fig.
7, we may lay
off on the front line ab any number of equal parts, at the points /, 2, j, 4, etc., and draw-
ing Perpendiculars to C mark off the joints perpendicular to the picture plane.
Then,
having
fixed D, at a distance equal
to the length
of the
axis, we can draw as many
diagonals as are necessary to determine the corners of the squares, or, what is the same
thing, the front
lines through
b,
c, d,
etc., which mark the rear sides of the successive
lines of squares.
A very few diagonals will be enough to determine
all
the necessary
points.
At
the margins of the picture. Perpendiculars which
it may not be convenient
to measure in front may still be determined by points and lines that have been already
found, as at cD, or by counter diagonals, as at xm.
The
point Z> is
a very important point, for by
it, in combination with the Centre, a
considerable number of perspective problems can be
solved without other help.
The
two points Cand D indeed fix the
essential conditions of the picture, — the positions
of the Horizon
Line, the
Centre, and
the
Station
Point;
for the distance CD marks
the length of the axis, and so the position of the spectator, that
is, his distance from the
picture. D
is
therefore appropriately
called
the Point of Distance, or more simply
the Distance Point.
The parallel lines aD, cD, etc., being diagonals of squares whose sides are
parallel
and perpendicular to the picture plane, are necessarily at an angle of 45° to that plane

12
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
s:
and
to
the Axis ; and
all lines
that are parallel to them must
also vanish
in D.
All
such lines, whether or not they appear as the diagonals
of squares, are
in perspective
called Diagonals, and the distance point
is
therefore the vanishing point of Diagonals.
There
is
of course
another
set of
horizontal
Diagonals
like xm, symmetrical with
these, running off
to
the
horizon
at the
left, and there
is another distance
point, D\
on
the
left
in
the
horizon line, at
the same distance from C as D, in which all these
Diagonals on the left must vanish.
It will be seen by looking at Fig.
7 that any Diagonal aD cuts off on the Perpendicu-
lars iC, 2C,jC, 4C, etc., the same
perspective length that
it cuts off from the
feet of
the Perpendiculars on
the horizontal ax, that
is, on jCit cuts off j/, equal to ja cut
off on ax from its
foot j.
So
it cuts off on 2C two
squares, as on ax
it cuts off two
squares from the foot 2.
On 4C
it cuts off four squares, and on ax four squares from
its foot
4. ; and so on.
If the sides of the squares are a foot or a yard, the distances cut
off on
perpendiculars and
horizontal
alike represent one foot, two feet, three feet, or
one yard, two yards, and three yards.
Therefore
if we wish to cut
off a required length on a Perpendicular, we have only
to
draw
a
horizontal
line through
its
trace,'
as
at
a
in
Fig.
8,
and having
measured
off on
it the required distance
to
X, draw from x
a
Diagonal
to
the
convenient
distance
point D, and
the
length a6 cut off on aC must
represent
a length equal to the distance ax.
Note.
The geometrical reason for this construction is clear from the plan, Fig. 9, in which
the Perpendicular at a
is drawn in its due position
at right angles with
the picture plane, and
xb,jf6, etc., are Diagonals.
The distances ax, ax", are repeated in the distances ab, aV, cut off
by the Diagonals
xb,
x'b', which being
parallel to the visual line SD are parallels
that make a
series of
triangles
similar
to SCD, and therefore
isosceles, having
their sides ax and ab, ax' and ab', equal
in
each.
Fig. 9 shows, moreover, how
the Distance Point may be taken on either
side of C, at D or D', and how the Diag-
onals drawn from y and y', at equal dis-
tances from C with x and x', will give the
same points b and
b'.
Hence we say
: —
The Distance Points in the Horizon
**"
Line
are on each
side
of C, at
dis-
tances from
it equal to the length of the Axis, or as far from
it as 6" is.
Any line that vanishes
in them is a Diagonal, and will cut
off on any Perpendicular
and Horizontal that
it crosses equal distances from the intersection of these.
Note.
In measuring by Diagonals we must be sure
that the lines we represent really inter-
sect in space, and do not merely appear to cross, as they may if one is behind the other.
This
' The point in which a line pierces the picture plane is called its trace.

requires that they be
in the same plane, which
is secured by drawing them from points in the
same
horizontal
line, — the Ground Line
for instance, — or such a
line as we use in Fig. 8,
which we may call a Hue of measures.
This
line
is the trace of the plane of the measuring
lines and the lines to be measured, which all vanish in the Horizon Line.'
To DRAW A PAVEMENT OF SQUARE TILES SET DIAGONALLY, with a border equal in width
to half the diagonal of a square (Fig. 10).
The bay on the left side is one square wide,
and three deep toward the centre of
the picture.
The picture plane
is for convenience
so set
that a small part
of the
floor is
in front of
it, and
is projected back against
it
;'
this makes no difference
in
the
construction.
The
line ao
is taken
for the
line
of
measures.
The points
a, 2, j,
etc., are
set off each way from i at distances equal
to
the
diagonal
of the squares, and no plan
is needed except for explanation.
We draw
the Perpendiculars aC, 6C, etc.
Diagonals drawn to D, from the points of division on
ao, will divide these Perpendiculars at the corners of successive squares, and the division
may be continued from other points set off to the left from a, at proper equal distances.
Horizontal _/)-(?«///«« through
the
division
points
of any of the
perpendiculars
will
intersect
the Diagonals
at
the
corners
of
the
successive

of squares.
If
the
distance point Z>' on the left of Cis within reach,
it is very simple to find the edges
of
all the squares by the division of the single front line
ao, without further front lines or
Perpendiculars
;
nevertheless
it
is well to draw one
set
or
the
other, or even both, to
test the alignment
of the corners
of the
squares, which must be exact if the construc-
tion
is
accurate.
If one
of the
distance points is out of reach, the counter-diagonals
are drawn by connecting in proper order the points where the Diagonals toZ) intersect
the front lines or Perpendiculars.
The mitre lines, as they are called, of the border lie
in
the Diagonals at their corners, as
at a and
^.
Half of a^ gives
the width
of the
Perpendicular
border,
the
intersections
of 1>C and iC with the mitre lines give
the
width of the borders parallel to ao.
It
should
be
noted
that although we
have
in
these
last constructions
taken our
distance points in the Horizon Line, because we were dealing with lines in a horizontal
plane, there
is nothing in
the geometry of the construction
that limits these points
to
that position.
If we turn Fig.
7 about the centre Cit may represent lines in an inclined
plane, instead
of
a
horizontal
one.
The construction
will be
just
as
correct
if we
assume an inclined line, ax, to begin with.
Note.
The only necessary condition
is that we take a line parallel to ax for a new horizon,
so that we may still represent
a
series
of Diagonals lying
in the same plane with the line of
measures ax and the perpendicular aCy
if they are not in the same plane, they will not
really
intersect those
lines (see Fig.
9).
The
lines are really in the same plane
if they all vanish
in
the vanishing
line
of the plane, that
is, DC parallel
to ax,
its
trace.
The
line DC, when
it
is
inclined,
is sometimes
called a secondary horizon, serving as
it does the purpose of the
' The trace of a plane, like that of a
line, is where
it intersects the picture plane.
The trace of a line
is a point, that of a plane is a line.
It is important that the student should always distinguish
the
different meanings of the words Axis,
Centre, Diagonal, Perpendicular, printed with capitals, as they are used in this hook, from the meanings
of the same words without capitals.
With capitals they have the special meanings here defined, which
are peculiar to Perspective
; without them they are taken in their ordinary sense.
It is impracticable to
discuss perspective problems without using the words in both ways.
' Lines parallel to the picture plane, that
is, fronting the spectator, are called front lines.

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
Horizon Line in measuring.
Fig. 9, again, may be conceived to be a plan made in any inclined
plane, and will still be just as conclusive.
The distance points D and D' , then, may be in any
direction from C; they must always be
at the same distance from
it, and so will all be
in the
circumference of a
circle whose
centre
is at C, and
its radius
the length of the Axis of the
picture.
Any two corresponding distance points, D and D', must
lie at the opposite extremi-
ties of the same diameter, and
the line of measures must be parallel to the line DCD' .
If we
turn the paper so that DD' looks
horizontal, we shall perceive the usual relations of Horizon
Line, Centre, and distance points.
Therefore we may enlarge our maxims, and say
: The vanishing points of all Diago-
nals are points
in
the circumference of a circle whose centre
is C, and
its
radius the
Axis of the picture.
All these points are distance points for the measurement of Perpendiculars by means
of lines of measures which are parallel to the diameters in which the points lie.
Distance points vertically over or under the Centre, often
called
vertical distance
points, are useful in solving many problems.
The gable in Fig. 11
is an example.
As
the
adjoining
elevation
shows,
the
section
of
wall between A and
b
is
square, the
outline of the triple window
is
a square, so
is
that of the
sundial, the upper lights
in
the window
are
square, the
pitch
of
the
gable
itself allows
it
to
be
inscribed
in
a
square.
The plane
of
the wall
is
perpendicular to the picture plane, so
that
all
the
horizontals vanish in the Centre.
These facts allow all
the measuring
to be done by
the vertical distance point D' .
Starting from A, and making Ab
in
the
picture plane
a
line
of
heights, we draw the Diagonal AD'.
Measuring
off
the
height Ab of the
square
section of the front up to the base
be of the gable, we draw bC, on which
the
diagonal cuts off the width
of the base be.
The height Ab repeated
gives
bd, that
of
the gable
: cross diagonals below give its central line, and dC fixes its peak.
The
line
of the window-sill
is set off at a, and
the height, divided
into
three equal parts, above
it.
Horizontals to C from the
points
of division
fix
the
top of the window and
the
transom, and by
their
intersections with Ae,
the
mullions.
The top
of
the
dial
is
measured
off
at
bf, its distance back from b on be from
e, and the diagonal eD fixes
two corners by which
it can be drawn.
A verification may be given by measuring
off
the distance of the lower corner from ^ on a horizontal
line
of measures through b by
means of the left-hand distance point at D in the Horizon Line.
It
will be noticed
that
the
vertical
distance
point D'
is
useful
in
this problem
because the
lines
to be measured
lie together
in
a
vertical
plane, so
that
the con-
struction
is best carried out
in
that
plane.
Each
line
might have
been measured
separately by one of the distance points in the Horizon Line
; but
it
is more convenient
to measure them
all
together by
a common measuring
line Ad
in
their own
plane,
and this calls for a distance point in the vertical horizon D'C of that plane.
The next
problem
will show the
convenience
of measuring
lines
in
an
inclined
plane by
a
distance
point
in
their inclined
horizon.
There will be
further
illustration
of these
principles
in
the discussion
of the measurement
of inclined
lines.
It is understood
that in these discussions horizon means a horizon in the picture, except where
there is
special reason for referring to the distant horizon in the view itself.
The folding chess-board. Fig.
12, shows the use
of two
distance
points, one of
which
is
in an
inclined
horizon.
The
front edges of the board

picture
plane.
We assume the centre C, and the
position
of the front line ab, which
is
the near edge of the squares on
the
half
that lies
flat, and draw the inclined
line
be, also a front line.at the proper. angle for the tilted half.
From^ we measure off four
squares on ab toward a, and four toward
c on
be.
From the
division
points and
the
extreme points a and b we draw perpendiculars to C.
From C we mark off on HHthe
length of the Axis to the distance point D, and drawing through b an inclined horizon
ITH' parallel to be, lay off an equal
distance
to D'.
The Diagonals
in
the plane of
the horizontal
leaf vanish
in D, and those
in
the
inclined
leaf
in D': we have only
to repeat for those two planes the construction of Fig.
7.
Note.
The inclined
leaf of the chess-board is here taken in a plane that
is perpendicular,
or normal, to
the
picture
plane, like the Horizon Plane, and whose horizon passes through C.
The horizons of
all normal planes, and these only, pass through
the
centre, so
that distance
points can be used for constructions in normal planes, and in them only.
The
striking compression in depth of the squares as they recede
is only a particular
case of the general phenomenon described in the introductory chapter.
One does not
at
first expect the extreme disproportion
between
the
distance and the foreground,
and
it may surprise
the student to learn that
to an observer standing on
the Ground
Plane
the
middle
line between GG and fflf represents
a distance
only just
as
far
behind the picture plane as the Station Point is in front.
Thus in Fig.
7, although the
point C
is
in
the
remote
horizon,
if the
line mn
is halfway from GG
to Hff,
a person standing
at
will be
as near the
picture plane as the spec-
tator.
This is clear from the side view of Fig.
13,
in which
the
right
triangles CSo and oo'P being
similar,
if
is halfway between /"and C, SC raust
be equal to Fo'.
Here PF represents the picture
plane seen edgewise, the spectator stands
at a on
the ground plane with
his eye
at the station point S, and 0' is the point in the ground
plane which
is projected at 0.
Note.
The application of distance points
in the inclined horizons, justified by geometrical
reasoning, may be verified by construction
in
Fig.
14.
Let Cbe the Centre, and D a distance
point
in
the Horizon
Line////.
Describe
a circumference about C, passing through D:
it
will contain
all the distance points.
Draw the Perpendicular aC from any point a, and laying
off on a line of measures parallel
to HH, any distance
ax, join xD, which
cuts
off ab
pro-
spectively equal
to ax.
Draw any inclined
horizon D'CH' , and on
a new
line of measures
parallel to
it
lay off the same distance ax' .
Then a line from
x' to Z>' will
pass through
the
same
point
b, again cutting off ab equal to ax or ax' .
This will be found true for every point
in the circumference used with its appropriate horizon and line of measures.
To DRAW TWO EQUAL CONCENTRIC SQUARES SET DIAGONALLY (Fig.
15).
Having the
side ab given or constructed as a front line, and drawing the Perpendiculars be and ad
to C, and the Diagonal bd or ae to D' below C ox D above, we set out the square abed.
The Diagonals bd and
ae
fix the perspective centre o, and
the vertical through
it on
which
are two angles e and g of the second square.
The part oe, equal to ob,
is a half-
diagonal of the square.
Construct mb' equal to mn, the real length of ob, by an isosceles
right triangle mbn ; project b' on oe by the Perpendicular b'C and lay off og equal to oe.

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
A Diagonal from e to Z?' below gives yj and one from g gives h.
The second square is
completed by joining eh and gf, or, for
verification, by drawing Diagonals from g and
e
\.o D above, which should pass through,^ and/,
if D above
is in reach.
This
figure
makes an eight-pointed
star, and
also an octagon which is the overlapping portion of
A
..-
J'cff
/J"
the two squares.
It will be of use in putting circles into perspective.
A series of octa-
gons, such as is often seen in mosaic pavements, may be easily drawn
in a similar way,
as we shall see later, by using Perpendiculars and Diagonals.
It often happens that the distance point comes too far on one side, and
is practically
inaccessible.
In
that case
it is important to find some substitute for
it.
Ordinarily
if
we would measure on the perpendicular aC, Fig.
i6, we draw a front linear?, and mark-
j<
ing
off on
it the required
distance ax draw
xD,
cutting
off
ab,
which
is
perspectively
equal to ax.
But
if we take Dj ^ halfway be-
tween C and D and draw Dj ^bxf^, we shall
have, as the similar triangles show, ax halved
like CD,
That
is, if we had taken axj ^ equal
to half ax, and drawn x/^Dj ^, that line would
have passed through
b.
Hence we may take a point Dj ^ halfway from C to Z>, and
by using half measures instead of whole, get the same division
of any Perpendicular
that we should get from D by whole measures.
The point D is called a half-distance
point.
If CD is very long, we may use a third or a quarter, or any other fraction of
it,
and then of course the measures on ao are divided in the same ratio.
These fractional
distance points
must
not be confounded with
the vanishing point of the Diagonals,
which
is
always D.
This
device
is
of value,
for,
as a
little experience
will show,
perspectives in which the Axis
is
short, and
the distance point correspondingly near,
look strained and unnatural, and
for good
pictorial effect
it
is desirable in most cases
to use a rather distant
Station
Point, that
is, a long Axis, and so a remote distance
point.

DISTANCE POINTS
17
It
is understood
that a is the
trace
of aC : otherwise ao will not be
in the picture
plane, and though ax
will
be
perspectively equal
to ab,
it will not represent
its true
length.
This point will be further discussed.
The student will soon find by experience that of the two distance points
in any hori-
zon the most convenient is usually that on the opposite side of the trace a from C.

PERSPECTIVE SCALES
If we turn back to Fig.
7, we shall see that the divided
lines make
scales of width
and depth by which we might place an object in any desired position on the floor.
For
instance,
if the
divisions
indicated were
a foot square, an
object at/ would be three
feet back from the front
line ax, and three to the right of aC.
We may imagine any
horizontal surface divided
into squares
of a yard, a
foot, or what
not, and
thus
fur-
nished with a network
of
scales by which any things
that lay or stood on
it could be
put accurately into perspective position by constructing the network in perspective, and
plotting the positions
of the
objects upon
it.
An analogous system of lines at right
angles has been used by painters in laying out
their work, from
the mural painters of
ancient Egypt to the scene painters of modern theatres
;
and the same system, applied
in perspective, may be used for constructing the representations of varied and compli-
cated
figures, such
as garden-beds,
or
the
pattern
of
a mosaic
floor.
This method,
which
the French
call
craticulation,
is
illustrated
in Fig.
17, and
is serviceable when-
ever irregular or freely curved lines are to be represented.
It
is
of course
not
indis-
pensable that the network should be of lines that are parallel or at right angles
to the
picture plane, but this
is most convenient.
It
is not necessary, however, that the horizontal plane should be
actually divided
into squares.
We may conceive the front
line ax alone to be divided
into
a scale of
measures parallel to the picture plane, and the Perpendicular aC into
a
scale
of mea-
sures back from the picture plane.
That
is, ax may serve for a scale of width, and aC
as a scale of depth
; and instead of first graduating the scales it is enough even to set off
on them
the
particular measures
that we need
for placing our objects.
We may add
to them
a vertical scale by which heights also may be
fixed, and
so have
a means of
placing objects of three dimensions.
In Fig. 18 the door and windows of a room are placed by this means.
The sides
of
the room are parallel and perpendicular to the picture plane
: AB is the Ground Line.
EAB represents the picture plane, or a plane of measures parallel to
it.
The
lines
of
the
retreating angles
of
floor and
ceiling
are
Perpendiculars, vanishing
in
C.
The
height and width
are
^et
off on AE and AB, and
the
outline of the view completed
accordingly.
The depth, 16 feet, set off on AB and measured to Z?, gives the corner F.
The positions of the
first window, three
feet wide and
set back one
foot and
a
half
from A; the door, three
feet wide and
set back seven feet; and the second window,
which balances the
first, are fixed in the same way.
Their heights, set off on AE, are
projected by Perpendiculars, vanishing in
C.
mm' represents the height (six feet) of a
man whose position, four feet from the right hand wall and six feet back from the front,
is determined by the same means.
His height, which must be measured in the picture
plane, like the rest, may be found in two ways.
It may be measured on £6 and carried
back on a Perpendicular 6C, which will be everywhere six feet above the floor, and the
point m be projected on BC by the horizontal front line mn, then upon 6C by the vertical

V
/


PERSPECTIVE SCALES

nn', and again on mm' by the horizontal n'm'.
Then mm'n'n
is a rectangle parallel to
the picture plane, and m7n' must be equal
to
nn', which
is perspectively equal to B6.
This is as if we had set the man
in
the
picture plane
at B6, marched him
along the
wall to nn', and then away from the wall and parallel to the picture
plane, to
his
posi-
tion mm'.
Or we may set off the height 4.-6' from
4. on the Perpendicular ^Cby which
the
figure was placed, and drawing 6'C, cut
off mm' at once.
This
is the simpler pro-
cess, but the other method
is sometimes better, keeping measuring lines
at the
side
of
the picture, where they are least
obstructive.
Indeed, though
perspective
scales may
be
set anywhere
in
the
picture,
it
is
usually convenient
to put them
in the margins,
where they interfere least with the things that are represented.
A common use
of scales
of heights
is
for the placing
of
figures
in
pictures.
We
establish, usually in the picture plane (Fig. 19), a vertical line AB that shows the height
of the figures and the positions with reference to the Horizon Line.
Horizontals, A V
and H V, drawn
to the same vanishing point on UH, will be everywhere six feet apart,
if that is the height assumed, and a figure of that height will
fit between them anywhere.
It makes no difference to what point of HH they are drawn
;
for
if they vanish
in
it
they must be horizontal and parallel.
Therefore
if we have an isolated figure to place,
and know where
it stands, after we have fixed our measure AB, as
in Fig.
19, we have
only to draw ^F through the position at m to the Horizon Line, and join BV.
Then
the vertical mn between A ^and .5 F gives the height of the figure in
its proper
place.
But
if we have to distribute a number of figures about the picture at the same
level,
it
is better to set up a scale in the margin as in Fig. 20, and then from any point m where
a figure
is to stand draw a horizontal front line mm'
till
it meets AV 2X m'.
The
point
m' is projected up vertically on BV^X n', and
that, projected
again
horizontally upon
the vertical at m, gives mn, the height of the figure.
A single scale thus gives the posi-
tions and heights of all the figures that stand at the same level, by the first process that
we used for Fig.
18.
If we have a series of figures or other upright objects, like a row
of columns or
posts, as
in Fig. 21, the
positions
of
their
feet being determined
at 2,
J, etc., a
line may be drawn through
their
feet from
its trace A to the Horizon Line,
and the height AB being set off in the picture plane, the horizontal ^Fwill cut
off
all
the columns at the right height.*
If the figures stand at different levels, a measure must
be provided
at each
level, as
in
Fig. 22 (Plate VI), where
the figures on the Ground
Plane are fixed by one scale, and
those on the higher levels by others.
If the figures
vary in height, if some are children, for instance, the artist's judgment will allow for this
when he has fixed the standard for figures of normal size.
The proper scaling of figures and animals
is important to good effect
; the neglect of
it leads to many blunders, always irrational and often absurd.
Animals and carts that
could not get into their barn doors, and men who could not inhabit the houses provided
for them, are among the commonest
instances.
But
perspective
scales
are
useful
in
many
other
things
than
the
placing
of
figures,
especially
in
architectural
subjects.
They are most commonly set in the
picture
plane, where
lines
are measured
in their
*
Fig. 2t shows a convenient way to continue the spacing of such a series when the
first interval has
been
fixed.
Through the middle point
c of AB we draw cX, which
will
bisect
all
the upright
lines.
Then a diagonal Bd through the middle d of the second will mark the point j oa aV, and when the third
is drawn the point 4 may be found in the same way.

true dimensions, according to the scale of the picture.
Nevertheless, it often happens,
especially in architectural perspectives, that the scale of the data from which the draw-
ing
is
to be made — the
plans
and
elevations,
for
instance— is
too small
for
the
perspective, in which dimensions
are much reduced by foreshortening and by retiring
behind the picture plane.
In such a case,
it is often well
to
establish scales of widths
and heights in a plane so far behind the
picture plane that dimensions that are set off
on them to the scale of the data may sufficiently increase the size
of
the picture.
For
instance, in
Fig. 23, b being the geometric middle
of aC, and am and bn both front
lines, am
will be twice as long
as bn, and
therefore,
if distances are laid off on a scale
at bn, the picture will be twice as large as
if they were laid off
in the same size at am.
If ^Cis taken at a third of aC, the picture will be magnified three times, and so on.
In
Fig.
6, for instance, the scale of
the sketch plan was too small for the perspective, and
if the drawing had been complicated enough
to require measurements from
the plan,
we might have had
to
place
our
scale
considerably
nearer C, in order to magnify the dimensions.
On the
other hand, to construct a picture of the same size, we
must use twice as long a unit for the scale of am as for
that of bn in Fig. 23.

The per-

the perspective of the middle point of

the
line on paper represents.
In the .same
way geometric division is division with reference only to the length of the line on paper;
per-
spective division represents in perspective the due division of the actual line.
So we say that
ao and om (Fig. 23) are geometrically equal, but that ao and bp are perspectively equal.

THE PERSPECTIVE PLAN
In
drawing objects
of more complex
outlines,
as,
for
instance,
the
plinth
block,
Fig. 24, and
still more
in
buildings,
it
is
often helpful
to put the plan in perspective
first and construct the picture from
it.
This plan, with the many lines that are needed
to project the necessary points, can be set below the picture, which can be constructed
by simply plumbing up from
the
perspective
plan, and then determining the heights
above
the Ground Plane.
The difficulty that
in
ordinary views
the foreshortening of
the Ground Plane, due to its being not far below the eye, crowds the lines together, and
makes their intersections very acute in the plan, may be obviated by lowering the plane
of the plan.
Its Ground Line may come
as far below the Horizon Line as we choose,
and
the plan be broadened and opened out
so as to be easily constructed and easily
read.
This appears in Fig.
24.
The geometrical
plan of the plinth block
is shown at
the top, the
perspective
plan
at a lower level, and
the perspective view between, con-
structed by plumbing up from the perspective plan.
It will be seen
that
the form of
the picture is nowise changed by taking
the plan at a low level.
It
is simply as
if the
block had been lengthened out like a chimney, and carried down to a foundation below
ground
:
the same superstructure could be built up from the
cellar bottom or from the
ground level.
The upper surface of the block is really a plan at a higher level, but so
foreshortened and crowded that
it would be difficult and uncertain to construct
it inde-
pendently.
It will be easily seen
that the
intersections are more securely constructed
in the lower plan, to say nothing
of the clearness which
is gained by banishing many
constructive lines from the picture.
The perspective plan
is simply found by transferring the widths from the geometrical
plan to the Ground Line G'G', drawing from
their traces the Perpendiculars iC, 2C',
3C,' 4C', and the Diagonals aD' and bD', which vanish in the Distance Point D'.
The
intersections of these give the points j', 4',^',
7',
8', from which
the plan is easily con-
structed, and by plumbing up to the same Perpendiculars iC, 2C, jC, 4C, in the picture,
the angles of the lower bed of the block are determined.
The height x being set off on
a vertical 2-g in the picture plane, corresponding Perpendiculars may be drawn in the
plane of the upper bed, and
the
corners projected up to them.
It
is to be noted that
the Horizon
Line of
this problem
serves
also
for that of the next, although the two
subjects have nothing to do with each other, and the Station Points are different.
The
distance point D, which intrudes upon the space
of the other problem,
is encircled
in
order
to distinguish
it.
This same
line
is used also to represent the picture plane in
the geometric plan
to
save
space, and
for the same reason
the Ground Line of the
picture does duty as the Horizon Line of the perspective plan.
The time-honored Problem of the cross, Fig. 25, which
is given next, brings out to
advantage
several
points
in
the use of the perspective plan.
The geometric plan as
given
at
the
scale
of the
picture
in
the
last problem was awkwardly large.
In
this
problem
it and the
elevation
are taken
at half the intended scale, or the scale of the

22
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
picture
is doubled.
The cross stands on a base
of three
steps.
Here the Horizon
Line of the picture
is used as the Horizon Line of the plan.
Since this is to double the
geometric plan in scale, the widths
are measured on a scale of widths, mn, set halfway
between HH z.x\6. G'G', so that the
measures, transferred
to G'G' hy Perpendiculars,
shall be doubled, as explained above.
Moreover,
because
the
scale of the drawing
carries the distance point inconveniently far off, the half-distance point £>/^
is substi-
tuted, and the measures
of depth are set off
at half
the
scale of the widths on G'G' ;
that is, exactly at the scale of the geometric plan and also of the elevation.
The whole
apparatus of distance point and measuring lines has been banished from the picture to
the plan, with a considerable gain in clearness.
The picture plane, /"/", is taken, here and in the last problem, some distance in front
of the object, a condition that is often required in practice.
The plan being square, the
diagonal ao is a convenient means of laying
it out.
The Ground Line G'G' is chosen
far enough below that of the picture to display the plan well, and the positions of C and a
are taken as may be convenient.
CD/^ represents
half the
length of the Axis.
The
widths of the geometric plan are projected on J'P.
The trace a of the diagonal, assumed
in the perspective plan, projected on mn by the perpendicular aC at a',
is taken as the
origin from which these widths
are
set ofT at /', 2', j', etc., to be projected on G'G' in
I, 2, J, etc.,
in
the doubled dimensions required
for the
picture.
The
Diagonal
ao
cannot be drawn to the distance
point Z>, for that is inaccessible, and so the point b is
determined by setting
off the distance aj from PP, on G' G' at 7/2
(or, what
is
the
same thing, by halving «/ on G'G'), and so drawing ab to P>l 2-
Its intersections with
all
the perpendiculars Ci, Cz, Cj, etc. give two angles of all the steps and of the shaft
of the
cross, and the plan
is
easily completed.
The corners / and 7 may be at once
plumbed up to their respective perpendiculars in the picture.
For the heights we use
a vertical scale at 7^ in the picture.
Here
the
heights may be got as the widths were
got, by setting them
off
directly from
the
elevation on a measuring line halfway from
Cto 7^; or we may set them off at double scale directly on 7^, as is done here at p, 10,
etc.
The perpendiculars yC, gC, loC,
etc. mark the heights of the steps and arms of
the
cross on a vertical plane JcC ; and 7C in
the plan may be taken
for a scale
of
depths.
The front lines of the steps in the plan are produced till they cut this scale in d, e,f;
and the series of points 7', d, e,f, projected up
respectively upon 7C, gC, roC, iiC, in
the
picture, gives points p', d,
e, through which
horizontals may be drawn which
will
contain the front edges of the steps, and may be cut oflf at the proper points by project-
ing up from the plan below.
The
horizontal
lines
of the arms of the cross are found
in the same way, and the rest of the picture offers no difficulty.
Instead of transferring our widths
directly from
the geometric plan and projecting
them in double scale upon G'G', we might have at once set them
oflf upon this line in
full
size.
Sometimes one method proves more convenient and sometimes the other
;
it
is well to be used to both.
It will be seen how taking the heights on the same scale yc
at one
side
clears the
picture
of obstructive
lines.
The horizontals which
transmit
these
heights might vanish
to any other point on HH as well as
to C, provided this
were done in the plan as well as in the picture.
It
is not necessary that they be Per-
pendiculars.

MEASUREMENT OF LINES
Thus far the lines measured have been all perpendiculars, and the planes used have
been all normal
to
the
picture
planes.
It
remains
to measure
oblique
lines.^
The
process is essentially the same.
The distance points of Perpendiculars are set ofl from their vanishing point, which
is
the Centre,
and
being as
far
from
this as
the
Station Point
is, are
determined
once for all by the conditions of the picture.
Distance points
of
inclined lines, which
are
called
measuring
points, are
set
off from
their vanishing points, and are
as
far
from these as
the
Station Point
; but they have to be determined
for each
case.
For
simplicity's sake we begin
as
before
with
horizontal
lines.
Let aF(Fig. 26) be an
T--^
.Mr
oblique horizontal, and a its trace in the
picture
plane,
ac' is a
line of measures
parallel to HH, on which given distances
ab and be are set off, and M a measuring
point
which we
assume
to
have
been
found.
Measuring lines bM and cM'cvX
off distances ab' and b'c' which are really
equal
to
ab
and
be.
The construction
and proof are simple, as will appear from
the
plan below.
Here
5' being the Sta-
tion
Point, SV
vsx
the
plan
parallel
to
ac
finds V as
usual,
and VM
is taken
equal
to VS.
Then
bb'
is made
parallel
to SM,
so
that
ab'
is
equal
to
ab, and
the
isosceles
triangles SVM 2in& bab' zre
similar.
Hence
the
visual
line SAf ^nds
in Mthe vanishing point of bb' and ^^'in
perspective.
The construction we have just
used
is
justified, and to
find M we have only to construct
the
triangle CKS, on the
perspective drawing or elsewhere, and transfer the distance VS to
the
Horizon Line
in
FAf.
We
say,
then, that every vanishing point
of horizontals
has
its measuring
point in the Horizon Line, as far from
it as the Station Point is in space.
But in reality
there must be two such points, one on each side of
V, just as there were two distance
points
in the Horizon
Line, one on each side of C.
Fig. 27, in which for variety the
trace a and the line of measures are taken
,
^
above the Horizon Line, shows how the
two measuring points will give the same
division, but
it seldom happens in prac-
tice
that the two fall
in
equally conven-
ient positions for use.
Furthermore, as we found that distance

1 Here we note a distinction
: an oblique line makes an acute angle with the picture plane, an inclined
line with the ground plane.

24
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
points were not confined to the Horizon Line, but might lie in any direction from C, so
the measuring points of an oblique line may
lie in any direction from
V.
Fig. 28 shows
the use of
different measuring points with the same vanishing
point, giving
the same
division of the line aV.
The construction
is obviously independent of the direction of
the Horizon Line, and is applicable to lines
T^.
Ji^S
J«C-
in any direction from
V.
The measuring
points will
lie
in
a
circle about V as the
distance points about C, and the only con-
dition
is, as in the case of distance points,
that whatever may be
the
inclination
of
the line VM\ which as before we may call
a secondary horizon, the
line of measures
must be parallel to
it.
This, as in the case
of distance
points, insures
that
the meas-
uring
lines and
the
line
to be measured shall really intersect, by putting them
in
the
same plane, which vanishes in
the horizon VM', whatever the position of that may be.
So we reach the general statement
: —
Every vanishing point has a circle of measuring points about
it in the picture plane,
as far from
it
as the Station Point
is in space.
The
line of measures for any measur-
ing point must be parallel to that secondary horizon in which the vanishing point and
the measuring points
lie.
This statement, when the vanishing point is the Centre, applies exactly to the distance
points and
Diagonals, which are only par-
ticular cases of measuring points and van-
ishing lines.
Fig. 29 shows
the complete
circle
for
different measuring points with
the
same
vanishing
points.
All
three
points, M, M\
and M'\
give
the same
division of a Fat b, and so would any other
point in the same circumference.
The folding screen,
Fig.
30,
illustrates
the use of measuring points.
The picture
plane
is
set
at
the near corner
c of the
screen,
so
that
the
upright edge
ch may
be measured
off at once from the Ground
Line
at
the scale of the picture, for which
abed above
is
the
plan and x the
height.
The vanishing points of horizontals
in the
three blades
are
V, V,
V", determined by
the visual
lines SV,
etc., and the
corre-
sponding measuring points M, M', M", determined
as
before, by taking on the plan
VMeq\id\ to
VS, VM' to
V'S, and V"M" to V"S.
Assuming
<• at a convenient point
of GG', — here
it
is plumbed down from the plan, — we draw cd to its proper vanishing
point
r", and measuring
off
the width
of the blade cd to
d', draw a measuring
line,
d'M", which cuts off the true length cd on cV".
cd is the lower edge of the blade, and
if h V" is drawn and
the vertical
at d intersecting
it, we have the true
outline of
the
right-hand blade.
The blade eg
is constructed
in
the same way with the help of the
MT'

MEASUREMENT OF LINES
25
points F' and M'.
To place
the corner
a, which
is
not
in the
picture plane,
the
simplest way is to prolong ab in the plan
to
its
trace
e, and projecting that into GG,
after drawing i?Fto measure off ea on
it at a by the measuring line aM.
This
problem, like that of the
plinth block
(Fig. 24), may be
easily solved by the
natural method
of visual
projection.
We may project
a,
b,
c, and d
in
the plan by
visual
lines upon PP and
plumb down from them
to
their positions
in
the picture,
first fixing c upon GG, then d upon cV^' and b upon cV\ then a upon b V.
The plumb-
lines give the vertical edges of the screen.
This
solution
is
in
this case simpler than
Z'cg,. SO
the
other.
But
a method
of finding the point a by measuring from a point b, which
is not in the
line of measures eb
(here the Ground Line)
but
is
projected upon
it,
is
important.
It often happens
that we need
to measure
off a
given distance on a line
whose
trace we cannot
reach.
Suppose, for
instance, we wish
to
set
off a
length x
(Fig. 31a) on the horizontal ao lying
in
the Ground Plane, whose trace
is out of reach,
but its measuring point M'\s known.
Projecting a from J/ into the Ground Line at a\
we measure
rt'i^' equal
to x, and drawing b'M c\i\. off the proper length ab.
The
result
is
the same whether, having
the trace m, as in Fig. 31^, we measure
off successively
3/a,
F^. 3/1
ma and ab by Ma' and Mb' ; or whether, not having
tti but having a, we draw Maa' at
once, and then, laying
off a'b', draw b'M.
So measures may be set off on a line from
any point as well as from its trace, but the starting point must be referred back to the
same line of measures ma' as
if it had beeij measured off from the trace m.

26
,
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
This leads back to the
principle before
laid down, that
all measures to the same
scale must be conceived to be taken in the same front
plane.
Thus far
it has usually
been the picture plane, in which
all measures appear in their true size
; but the meas-
ures
will
agree among themselves
\i
they are taken
in any one plane
parallel
to
that
plane.
For, as we have seen,
all dimensions
parallel to the picture plane are perspec-
tively diminished in proportion as they recede from
it, and
all
that recede equally from
it, that
is, are
in
the same plane
parallel to
it, are diminished
in
the same proportion,
and, if they are equal, remain equal
in
perspective, or,
if they are not equal, they keep
their
true
ratios.
Therefore,
if we would measure
off
lines
in
true
dimensions, we
must measure them in the picture plane; but
if we have only to divide them into equal
parts, or in
given
ratios, we may measure
them
in
any plane
parallel
to the picture
plane, — the original condition being remembered, that the
line
of measures must be
parallel to the horizon in which the given lines vanish, and therefore
all
lines of meas-
ures for that horizon, in whatever plane, must be parallel.
Suppose then
that we have
to divide a certain
length ab of a given horizontal line
^;^
into four equal
parts.
We may draw a line
_ ','h .
of measures through a, and projecting b upon
.'
,'
•
^
'.
it from M at b\ divide
ab^
into four equal
parts at /, 2, and j, and project these points
back upon the
line.
Fig. 32 shows that we
—^,
75^
"-[J
^^
should
in
this way get the same division as
" ~i"
if we projected ab upon the Ground Line in
**-'
*"
^\^
"*'
«'(5"anddivided that in the same ratio.
The
'^'
difference
is that in that case we should have
the exact dimensions of the parts recorded on GG, and this shows us a means of getting
at the real
length
of any perspective dimension on
a
line whose measuring point we
know, by merely projecting that dimension back upon a line of measures in the picture
plane.
Note.
It is not essential to use the measuring point M for equal or proportional division of
ab.
The
actual measuring point is the only one that will give identical lengths on ab and the
line of measures
in
the
picture
plane, because
it
is the only one which will make the similar
triangles isosceles, as in Fig. 26; but lines to any point in HH will represent parallels dividing
ab and the line of measures proportionally.
We have thus far assumed that the given line ab is horizontal
; but the same construc-
tion will serve for any line whose vanishing point we can use.
If, as in Fig. 33, the line
is not
horizontal, that
is,
if its vanishing point V\s not in HH, or
if any other reason
requires, we may draw through Fand a two geometrically parallel lines Vm and ao, and
laying off on ao as a line of measures the required parts to
b', draw b^b produced to m
on the line through
V, which
is
the
horizon
that corresponds to ao.
Then lines to m
from the points of division on ab will divide ab as
is required.
As we used accidental
distance points for the measurement
of
Perpendiculars
in inclined normal planes, so
we may use accidental measuring points in inclined horizons when we construct in planes
that are not normal.

MEASUREMENT OF LINES
27
Note.
The essential thing here
(as was
stated on page
12)
is
still that the measuring-
lines and the line to be measured shall be in the
same
plane, so
that
they shall intersect.
Now
the
line ao
(Fig.
33) may represent a front
line
through a, and the parallel through Kthe horizon
or vanishing line of the plane of ao and a V.
Then
the measuring
lines I'm, s/m, b'm must be in the
same plane of Vm and ao, and therefore
intersect
ab, and be in reality parallel
lines vanishing in m,
and so divide the
lines ao and
at) proportionally.
We may test our construction in Fig. 34, by draw-
ing two
lines through
V. of which one or neither
may be the Horizon Line, and two
lines of meas-
ures
parallel
to them through a;
if the divisions
of these lines are the same, or in the same ratio, we shall get an identical division of a V.
again,
it cannot be too carefully borne in mind that
the division of a Kand ao is only proportional, unless
a is the trace of aV, and therefore ao
is in the pic-
ture plane
; and unless m
is
the
actual measuring
point M, corresponding to
V, in which case the por-
tions cut off on the two lines are equal.
71^ 3<^
Jtc
It may happen that in measuring off succes-
sive distances on the same line of measures the
last divisions would pass out of reach, and
it
is
desirable to continue them on a new line of measures.
Suppose that in Fig. 35 we have set
off equal
parts, the intervals of a colonnade for
instance, on a^hy
the measuring
point M And the
line
of measures
04', and having
reached the
point 4' have no room to go far-
ther.
We may draw a second
line of meas-
ures
through
2
parallel
to
the
first.
The
divisions
of
this
line, like those of the first,
must be equal, and projecting the last division
j-4 upon
it from any convenient point m in
VM, we get a unit j"-.^" for them.
Repeat-
ing this unit
at 5", d", 7", and drawing
lines
from these points to m, we continue the divi-
sion exactly as if we had gone on with the first line 04'.
From these examples we deduce the following rules
:—
Any front line may be used for a line of measures
if the measuring lines are drawn to
a point m on
a. line parallel to it which passes through the vanishing point of the line to
be divided.
In this case the divisions will be proportional
to those on the line of measures
: but
if they are to be equal
to them, that
line must be in
the picture plane, and must pass
through the trace of the line to be divided
; moreover, the point m must be M, the cor-
responding measuring point of the given line.
If, however, we have determined one division of the given line, we can, by projecting

28
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
it upon any front line from a suitable measuring point, fix a unit by which we can
con-
tinue an equal division, or which will serve for a scale of division.
It is obviously essential that the measuring lines should be drawn across the line that
is
to be measured, but sometimes the condi-
tions of the drawing forbid this, as in the case
of aV m Fig. 36, where there is not room on
the
sheet.
In
this case we may draw
any
convenient
line
a' l^ to
the
same vanishing
point
:
it will
then have the same measuring
point M.
Having measured off the required
distance
a'b' from
the same measuring
line
aa\ we draw ^^' parallel to aa'.
The
intersection b will be the required point on aV,
and ab will be perspectively equal to a'b'.
For, aa! being a front line, bb' is so also, and the two are parallel in space.
Imagine
a measuring
line drawn from
the
inaccessible m on aa' at the proper distance from a,
making am=a'm'.
The two
triangles abm and
a'b'm'
in
space
are
similar,
having
their homologous side parallel, and having equal bases they must be equal.
Therefore
the parallel sides ab and a'b' must be equal.
Jtr

CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS
Thus far we have used only single or unrelated vanishing points, except in the case of
Perpendiculars and Diagonals, for which we have found a special tieatment.
But most
of the objects which are drawn in per-
spective,
buildings,
furniture, and
the
like, are either rectangular or based on
rectangular forms, and the angle being
invariable,
it
is
worth
while
to
find
some
relation
between
the
vanishing
points which will
fix the angle
in
per-
spective.
There is a very simple
rela-
tion, of constant use in perspective.
If we have
a
horizontal square
to
put
in
perspective,
as
in
the
plan,
Fig. 37, when we lay out the vanishing
points of its sides, making 5 ^parallel
to ab, and SV to ac, we shall have a right angle at S;
that
is,
.S,
V, and
F'will always
be the
angles of
a right triangle whose hypoihenuse
is in the picture plane.
If, then,
we have the position of one vanishing point given, say by the distance CV, or have the
angle of one side of the square with PP, that
is, the angle SVC, this fixes the triangle
SVC, and we can find the other vanishing point.
We need not draw the plan, or even
the triangle, for we know that any right triangle VSV may be inscribed in a semicircle
that has VV ioc its diameter.
Knowing the angle of either side of the square with the
picture
plane, we can
construct
its vanishing
point from S (Fig. 38), and then a semi-circum-
ference from V through
S,
with
its centre
in
VV,
will
fix
v.
Moreover,
since
this
is a
purely geometrical construction for finding dis-
tances, we may perform
it anywhere and simply
transfer the
distances
to HH in
the picture.
It
is natural to lay it ofl from HH, where C is,
and
the vanishing points
are to be.
The
tri-
angle really
is in
the Horizon Plane with 5 at
"^
its right angle;
this diagram represents
it as
if revolved about FFand laid flat in the
picture plane.
The same diagram
will
furnish
the measuring points Afa.nd M\ as is
evident in the figure, and the square may then be described, as
is there shown.
The vanishing points
of two
lines or series of
lines
at
right angles
to each
other,
in view of
their close perspective relation, may be
called Conjugate Vanishing Points,
and will be so called here.
The semicircle KST' with the points M,
C, and M' on
its
diameter may be called a perspective chart (Fig. 39).
It may be constructed anywhere
v^<r>-

3°
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
and to any scale, the dimensions being enlarged, or diminished in due proportion when
they are transferred
to
the
picture.
Inasmuch
as
in
large drawings the vanishing
points
are
apt
to come very far
off,
it
is often convenient to construct the chart to a
smaller scale than the picture.
If the Station Point and one vanishing point are known,
the
rest follows
necessarily: sometimes
it
is convenient
to
fix both vanishing points
first, and then the
Station
Point
is
confined to the circumference of which W is the
diameter.
It is a common practice to take ^and V as far apart as the paper or the
drawing board allows, and adjust 5' and C to suit them.
Pins are often stuck into the
board at Fand V, and
if a draughtsman's triangle or square
is
thrust between
them,
its
right angle may be swung round to describe the semicircle and find a position for
S, while
its sides show the inclination of the object to the picture plane (Fig. 40).
Let us take the case of a chair, a piece of furniture that often refuses
to stand
firm
in a picture.
The plan and elevation, Fig. 41, at half the scale of the perspective, give
its dimensions and assumed
position
with
the
picture
plane
;
the
perspective chart
on the left
is at one third the scale of the picture, and
its distances are set out on HH
accordingly.
The horizontal line of measures ax is taken at the
lowest square corner
of the frame
at
a.
The horizontal
lines, vanishing
right and
left
in V and V, are
measured by the corresponding measuring points M anA M' on double the scale of the
plan and elevation.
It gives clearness
to the drawing
to take the vertical measures
directly from the elevation on a scale of half heights mn at half the distance from Fto
the vertical az in the picture plane and project them on az.
The spacing of the balus-
ters under the arms, being merely the division of a horizontal line into equal parts, may
be accomplished by projecting the extreme points from any convenient point, as C, in
HH, upon any convenient line op parallel to HH, and dividing the intercepted
section
op
into
the
necessary number
(six)
of
equal
parts, which are projected back on
ee'.
It is often convenient to know the vanishing
point of the diagonal of a given square, or the
mitre line which bisects the angle of a rectan-
gle, and
this
is
easily included in the diagram
or chart.
Let V&nd V, Fig. 42, be coordinate
vanishing points, and
^S the
Station
Point, Si
being the diagonal.
If we draw the diameter
bd perpendicular to VV, Sd must be the diag-
onal passing through 8/ for the inscribed angle
VSd, standing on a quadrant, must be 45°, and



CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS
.
31
so half of VSV.
The point 8 therefore, where 5^ cuts the Horizon Line, is the van-
ishing point of all lines parallel to Sd.
If we have not room for the lower half of the
circle we may bisect the arc Sb at a, and draw the radius ao.
58 parallel to ao will give
the point 8.^
The point is often useful, in drawing the mitres of borders or pavements,
for instance, or
in
constructing octagons.
The diagonals
of a square being at right
angles, the vanishing
point
of the cross-diagonal
will be conjugate
to 8, and may be
found from
it by the regular construction.
The two points may conveniently be called
mitre points.
It will be seen that any two opposite distance points must be conjugate, for they are
the vanishing points of
lines that make angles of 45° with the Axis on opposite sides,
and therefore a right angle with each other.
As a matter of fact the distance points in
the Horizon Line are much used as conjugates, especially in architectural views.
They
are nearer together than any other two conjugates, and so suit a narrow sheet or draw-
ing board, and
all the construction points are symmetrically placed about the Centre
:
the two mitre points both coincide with the centre, and
all the mitre lines become
per-
pendiculars, so
that
the whole construction becomes compact and simple.
It has the
disadvantage that in rectangular objects near the Centre
the
lines
slope both ways
at
nearly equal
angles, giving them
a
stiff and ungainly aspect which
is only
partially
cured by setting the principal subjects as far to one side as practicable.
The choice of conjugate vanishing points has much to do with the agreeable look
of
a picture, and the painter or draughtsman learns that things look better for being drawn
with their vanishing points remote.
Buildings and other rectangular objects
are best
shown with the lines on one side not far from parallel.
One vanishing point approaches
as the other recedes, and the contrast
of strong foreshortening on one side when
the
other is broadly displ.iyed
is usually agreeable.
Painters recognize the advantage of a
remote vanishing
point, and
are apt
to
avoid, unless for
special
effects, the strongly
converging lines that come with near ones.
On the other hand, the steepness
of horizontal
lines
that converge downward and
vanish close at hand makes things look high, and often adds grandeur to a picture.
It
suits well with picturesque architecture, — towers and strongholds set on high rocks or
mountain tops, and the like.
Foreshortening carried
far enough
to be conspicuous
is
often very effective, and
tells
well
in picturesque
architecture where
there
are many
vertical
lines, as
in
Gothic, or in most columnar buildings.
It is the essence of efft-ct
in
street views and long
interiors
of great churches
or galleries, which are naturally
drawn
in
parallel
perspective, where there
is
but one vanishing
point, and
the
fore-
shortening and convergence are at a maximum.
But
it will be noticed that in parallel
perspective, where two
sides
of an
object
are shown, as
at a
street
corner, the side
which fronts the spectator and shows no convergence is apt to disappoint the eye, which
desires some
slight convergence, and
is
inclined
to fancy that the parallel lines, seen
in contrast to the sharply convergent Perpendiculars, are actually divergent.
This does
not appear in interiors, where the walls that front the eye are
in the remote middle
of
the
picture, and are usually enclosed between two retreating walls whose
lines, con-
verging on both sides, balance each other.
Therefore parallel perspective is peculiarly
1 Sd and ao must be parallel, for the angle aob at the centre, subtending the arc ab, must be equal
to
the inscribed angle Sdb subtending double the arc.

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
well suited to interior views, apart from its convenience in showing both walls at once,
and
it is agreeable in most street views, which are analogous to interiors.
But for open
views which show two
sides
of a building, or for rectangular objects away from the
Centre,
it
is
less
satisfactory.
There
will be more
to say about certain
unpleasing
aspects of parallel perspective when we come to speak of perspective distortions.
Fig. 43 represents a flight of outside steps.
Two steps surround the square platform
before the arched doorway, and from this a straight ramp ascends to the right against
the wall.
On the right are the geometric plan and
elevation
at
half the
scale of the
perspective.
We draw first
a perspective plan.
According to the principles just laid
down we choose such a view that the right-hand vanishing point shall be considerably
farther
off than
the left-hand.
Assuming an Axis which, according to a rule that will
be presently justified, is
at
least as long
as the greatest width we mean to include in
the picture, we lay out our perspective chart, fixing F, V, M, M', C, and
S, in whatever
place and
scale are convenient, and set off the points at proper distances on the Hori-
zon Line of the perspective plan, which is also that of the picture.
We begin with this
plan.
To make the case general we take the picture plane a little in front of the near
corner of the steps at a.
The diagonal ai/ of the platform, which contains the corners
a,
b,
c, and d, will be a mitre line vanishing in
8.
Producing it to cut FP in the geomet-
ric plan
at A, we place
this point on GG, in the perspective plan, and draw AV, on
which we can measure the widths
of the
steps.
The corner a is fixed by producing ea
till
it cuts FP in
a', and laying off Aa' on GG
at double
scale
; but
it may be found
with
the other corners b and c by producing ea and
the parallel edges of the steps to
AB in the plan, which corresponds to A V in the perspective
plan, and measuring
off
the points /, 2, j, 6, from GG by M', and drawing i V, 2 V, j V, 6 V, which contain the
parallel
edges, and by their intersections with Ah give the corners a,
b,
c, and d.
The
line en of the wall behind
the
steps may be drawn
to V through d.
The
lines aV\
bV, cV give
the corresponding front edges of the steps.
The point 6 gives the right
front corner of the platform, 7 and 8, measured
in the same way, the corresponding
corners
of
the
steps and
the edges vanishing in
V.
The counter diagonal y^ may be
drawn for verification of these corners.
Successive measures for the steps of the ramp
are set off on an auxiliary line
of measures dm, the
intercepted
interval d-7 being
re-
peated on
it for a unit as in
Fig. 35, p. 27.
The width
of the buttress of the ramp
is
set off on d F at
// by projecting h from ^ upon GG (where
it happens
to coincide
with
i').
The
line
of the
face
of the wall being already drawn through
e, the door
opening is set off from 4 and 5, and
its depth found like the width of the buttress.
This
completes the perspective plan.
The picture is plumbed up from the perspective plan with the help of the same Hori-
zon Line HJf&nd a new Ground Line G'G'.
Az is taken as a scale on which heights
are measured up to the
sill of the door.
From
that point the
heights are measured
on the
auxiliary
scale
A'z', the reduced
units being transferred from Az.
The arch
is sketched
in
: the method
of constructing
circles will be given
later.
The
line
at
the base of the wall of the ramp is found by setting back from g on the plan to k, and
plumbing upon gV.
The successive heights of the steps in the ramp, being
set
off on
A'z', are transferred by horizontals vanishing in V, and the corners plumbed up from
the plan.
To determine the lines of the sloping buttress, we choose the
front edge
of

-^


CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS
33
a convenient upper step, no in the plan, and plumbing up a vertical to n in the picture,
set ofif the edge on the height ««' above by the scale Ah'.
Then drawing the horizon-
tal «'/, plumb up the points
and/ upon
it.
The bonding
of the masonry offers no
difficulty.
Examination of Fig. 43 suggests a simpler way of constructing the steps.
The edges
of a
straight
flight
of steps are all in the same inclined plane, and the corners of the
ramp from d to n are in the same straight line dn
against the wall.
If we had set out
this line beforehand we could plumb up the corners upon
it from
the
plan
at once.
But by the help
of the
slope line dn we may construct a flight of steps without a plan.
Suppose we have to lay out the steps in Fig. 44, whose tread and rise are shown in
the
margin.
There are to be five steps, the upper a square landing, and they rise to the left
from A.
On Aj we set off the height of five risers, and on Aj' four treads, which are
transferred
to AVhy M.
The horizontal jF and the vertical bb' give the upper front
corner
b', and the
slope line /iJ'must contain
all the near corners.
The width of the
ramp is measured off on A V at
r, and a vertical at c intersecting i V gives the corner
c' ; cFand bV give
d, and the vertical dd', cutting b'F', gives
<*", which fixes the slope
line c'd'.
The
steps can now be drawn
in two ways
: either by dividing ib' with
hori-
zontals iV, 2 V, etc., for the risers, or by plumbing up the treads from AV.
The front
edges /^, etc. will transfer the divisions
to c'd'.
Thus all the steps may be determined
by merely dividing the upper slope lines
:
nevertheless,
it
is well to draw also the slope
lines of the inner angles beneath
the
others, and
these
will
be
accurate
tests
of
the
precision of the construction.
The landing being
square, its diagonal is a mitre
line
vanishing in
S, and so
it
is easily drawn.
It
is
clear from
the
figure
that, the upper and under slope lines once established,
the
lines of the
ends
of the
stairs may be drawn in without farther construction than
zigzagging
from
one
to
the
other with
horizontals and
verticals.
Thus
in
Fig. 45,
having placed
ab and
a'b', we may draw the vertical
aa', then the horizontal a'b, then
bb', then
b'c, and so on.
This
is usually enough for free drawing or for field sketching,
but is dangerous where precision
is required, for in piecing one part on another small
errors are apt to accumulate, and the draughtsman is not likely to come
out where he
aims.
It
is
better to
control
the points b',
c', d', by dividing one
slope line perspec-
tively.
Then any error in an intersection will be isolated, and
the next
point will be
independent of
it.
Now going back
to
Fig. 44 we may see
that
all four slope lines are really parallel,
and must have the same vanishing point
:
if we can find this vanishing point
it will be
easier to place them.
Moreover, the
lines Ab, Ae, and i-b' are all in the same vertical
plane, the plane of the ends of the steps
:
their vanishing points must be in the vanish-
ing line
of the
plane.
The vanishing
line
of a
vertical plane
is a vertical
line, and
since
that
of
this plane contains
the vanishing point
of Ab, which
is
V,
it must be
the vertical through
V.
Any one of the slope lines then,
if continued, would
find the
vanishing point
in
its
intersection with the vertical through
V.
The line Ab, or A V,
lies directly under Ae, in the plane Abe, which
is the ground plane, and is
its projection
on the Ground Plane
: we may call
it the horizontal ground projection of Ae.
We may
say then
that the vanishing point
of any inclined
line, any line, that
is, which makes
an angle with
the Ground
Plane,
is
in
the vertical
that passes through the vanishing

34
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
Z'i^ <^6
point of
its ground projection.
It remains to see how this
is
to be found.
Let a V
be any inclined
line vanishing (Fig. 46)
in
V.
The vanishing point V
of
its ground
projection, as we have seen,
is directly under
V'va HH at the foot of the vertical VV.
The lower half of the figure represents the plan, showing
the Station
Point and
Axis,
and
the
picture
plane PP.
In
the plan F is
projected
in V and SV\x\ SV.
The
three points S,
F, and V are
really
at the
angles of a right triangle whose base SV is
in
the horizon plane,
its perpendicular W
in the picture
plane, and
its hypothenuse
is
SV, unseen
in
the
plan.
If
this
triangle
were revolved round
the vertical VV
till
it
--^
lay
in
the
picture
plane,
3' would
swing
round
to M, and VMV would be
the
tri-
angle.
The angle VMV is
then
the angle
VSV,
the angle between aVand
its hori-
zontal
projection,
that
is,
its slope
angle.
But Af is
the measuring
point
of both a V
and its horizontal projection, for MV'is SV
revolved, and MV is SV revolved.
There-
fore the natural way to put an inclined
line
into
position, when we know
its
inclination,
is
first
to
place
in
plan
its horizontal
projection
with the vanishing point V, and then from the measuring point
of
that on
HH draw a
line making the proper
slope
angle with HJI, which
will
intersect the
vertical
through
the
vanishing
point V
in
the
required
vanishing point
V.
If the
ground
plane
is
not
convenient, the
projection
of aV on any horizontal
plane
will
serve our
turn, for all such projections must have the same vanishing point and hori-
zontal measuring point.
We then arrive at the rule
: —
An inclined line has the same measuring point as its
horizontal projection, and its
vanishing point is where a line from the meas-
uring
point, making
its
slope angle
with
the
Horizon
Line,
cuts the
vertical through
the
vanishing point of the horizontal projection.
The relative positions of the different points
are sketched
in
Fig.
47, where SffH is
the
horizon
plane with S upon
it,
and PP
the
picture plane upright before the Station Point.
SVV
is the
triangle
in
its normal
position,
and MVV the same
triangle revolved round
VV
into
the
picture.
The
angle
VMV,
which
is the angle VSV,
is evidently the slope-angle of the
line MV.
The point M
moves in the Horizon Plane on the circular arc SM.
It
is sometimes important
to draw a
line toward an
inaccessible vanishing
point,
and to measure distances on
it.
Fig. 48 shows how
this may be done.
Suppose we
need to draw a
line from a toward a point F which is out of reach, but whose distance
from some point m on
its horizon is known, as
it may be from a chart
like that in Fig.

N
/

CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS

44, for instance.
We lay off mn equal to any convenient fraction of the distance from
m to
V, say one half, and
join am.
We divide am
in the same
ratio, making mb one
half of ma, or a tiiird, or whatever fraction
mn
is
of
the
distance
to
the vanishing
point, and draw
bn.
Then
the
required
line may be drawn
parallel
to
bn, and
if
it were prolonged would pass through
V.
For suppose F in
the
figure,
outside
the
drawing, to be the vanisliing point, and a V
to be drawn.
The triangles mbn and ma V
are
similar
if mV and wfl
are divided
proportionally:
therefore aV"\s parallel to ^«,
and
is the line we have constructed.
The problem
is a simple geometric one, and any
line mn
will
serve,
if
only
it passes through V if
continued, and we know what
part
mn is of m V.
The question
is apt to come up with conjugate vanishing points, where
one is far off.
The
measuring point
of an
inaccessible vanishing point
is
easily found when the
conjugate vanishing point
is
accessible,
for the
angle MSM'
is
constant,
being always
45°,
or
half a right angle.
Note.
If we call a (Fig. 49) the angle MSM', the
triangle MSM
gives, a = i8o°—{SMM'-^ SM M).
Triann;Ie SM'V
is
isosceles,
therefore
SM' V
or
SM'M=\{i8o°-V).
So
zXio SMV or SMM' =
y^i8o°- V).
Then SMM'JrSM'M- i8o°-\{ V+ V).
But r + V= go°, and ^r+ V) = 4S°.
Hence S^fM•
+ SM'M=i8o°-4S° = i3S'', and a = 180° - 133° = 45°.
Fig. 50 involves many of the foregoing
principles and methods.
The
sketch
plan
shows
a
flight
of
steps
in
three ramps connecting terraces
at four levels.
The per-
spective
is
laid out according to the
sketch
plan, the
scale of feet in
the margin, and
the
length of Axis there shown.
Some care
is necessary to choose the angle ^ of the
picture plane
so
as
to show the
steps well.
The perspective chart
is
set at the top,
at
a
third
the
scale
of
the
picture.
As appears
in
Fig. 51, the angle
<^
is equal to
CVS, and
that
again
to CSV.
The
easiest way
to construct the chart
is
to
set
off SC equal
to a
third
of the
Axis and the angle CSVxo
<f>: then
describe
the
semicircumference by
bisecting
the
chord
VS,
or construct
the
right
angle
VSV.
The corner A of the lower landing
is
in
the pic-
ture
plane, and
the
Ground
Line,
or
horizontal
scale Ax, passes through
it, being taken eight feet
below the Horizon
Line.
The width
of the
pic-
ture does not take in
the point
V.
J/ being also
out of reach, we
substitute Mj ^, a fractional measuring point at a
thir.l
the distance
from
i^to .A/i which corresponds directly to VM \n the chart.
By accident 't coincides
with M'.
The short ramp in the middle of the steps is the only one whose slope lines

36
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
vanish
to
the
left.
Their vanishing point
F"
is
in
the
vertical through
V, but M,
from which
the
slope
angle w would be
set
off,
being
ofl the
picture, we
use M/^,
getting the point t, and set off FF" equal
to
three times
Fi'.
The same angle
<o, set
off to the right from
J/', both above and below the Horizon Line, gives the directions
of the
inaccessible vanishing points
F'" and
F""
of the
slope
lines
of the ramps
which ascend and descend to the right, these points being in the vertical which passes
through F.
Starting with A, we draw A F, and measure off on
it Ai for the width of the landing,
using one third of the measure of length, for we must use the point M/^ for measuring.
To draw A£ toward the
inaccessible
F' we
bisect AF, and draw a
line from the
middle
point a
to
the halfway point O; then AB is drawn parallel
to aO, and must
point to
F' (see
Fig. 48), and
the width
of
the landing to B
is measured
off on
the
Ground Line by M'.
Then £ F
\s drawn, and 4 found by A4 which vanishes
in
the
mitre point
S.- 1-4 is drawn and completes the
landing.
Points 2 and j are measured
off like /, and uprights being drawn through them, the
height of the corners b and c
is
measured off by the scale of heights at A, and the vanishing point
F.
The slope lines
of the middle ramp can now be drawn from b and c to
F".
F"b marks
the point
8,
which gives the height
of the second landing
:
its edge 8-6 is found by bisecting 8 F,
drawing a line to O from
its middle point, and 8-6
parallel
to
this last.
^Fand 6F,
by their
intersections
with
the
diagonal
*8 and
the
upright from j, find
the
other
corners of the second landing, whose rear edge can now be drawn.
The corners of the
steps might be found by measuring the widths on AFand
projecting up on b8, but the
construction would be crowded.
It will
be
clearer to
divide
b8 or
cd perspectively.
This
is not a case
of measurement, but
of dividing
into
perspectively equal
parts, so
we draw through 6 a line parallel to F"M, using the rule of Fig. 32, and laying
off on
it any four equal
parts, draw a/ through the last point </to find /on F"M, which will
be the vanishing point
for lines from /to the division points of 6^, that will
divide
61:,
giving the corners
of
the
steps.
8b may be
divided in the same way, and
the
front
edges of the steps put in between, or the edges may be drawn toward F' by the process
by which AB and 8-6 were drawn.
The second
method would
be a
little
more
laborious, but would be
surer, for any irregularity in the double
division of
the slope
lines would disturb the convergence
of the edges.
These once found, the other lines
of the steps are easily found.
It remains to draw the ramps that ascend and descend to the right.
Beginning with
the upper, we set off d-/ equal to the riser below
it.
F'" is out of
reach, and we can-
not draw the slope 7-F'" directly: we
set
off from M' on HH owt third the distance
to
F*, marking the point
F'/j, and draw the vertical which will cut
off one third each
on M'F'" and M'F"".
On M'7 we set off one third the distance from M', and from
the dividing point draw a line to F"'/J
.• the slope line from 7 to F'" is parallel to this.
In the same way we draw 6- F'" and 9- F'".
These slope lines
are so
nearly parallel
to
their inclined
horizon M' F"' that
to
divide them
in
the
ordinary way would be
troublesome
:
' it is better to divide the horizontal projection 8-6 prolonged, and project
the divisions on 7- F"'.
There are ten steps to be measured off on 7- F'".
If we pro-
long V8 till
it meets the scale of heights Az in
z, and draw ze parallel to Iflf, this
will
1 A line of measures parallel to M' V" would lie so close to 7-F" as to be embarrassing.

be in the picture plane, and be a line of measures for any line in the plane of the land-
ing, in which 8-6 lies.
We project the lower point 6 upon
it from M' at
e, lay off from
e the measures of the ten treads, and project these back on 8-6 prolonged to 10'.
The
points of division, plumbed up, divide /-lo as
is
desired.
The front edges, the lines
of the treads, and the risers are then easily drawn.
The point /o at the top of the steps
marks
the
level
of
the upper
landing, and should come
in
the Horizon Line.
It
is
determined by the
intersection
of lo'-io and 7-10, and will
test the accuracy of our
construction.
The descending steps might be constructed by measuring the
heights on the scale
Az produced downwards, but
it
is easier to divide the slope lines than to draw so many
treads toward an inaccessible vanishing
point.
These lines are drawn like those of the
upper steps, joining £M', for instance, trisecting it, and drawing a line from the upper
division point to V""/j, and the slope line Bp parallel to this.
Then by Ax we measure
off the dimensions
for the
risers on Bm, as we did those of the upper ramp on 6-10',
and plumb them down to Bj>.

INCLINED PLANES
Fig. 50 shows how the sloping lines of the ground appear— of roadways and the like.
The horizontal coursing of the
terrace wall, with
lines vanishing
in
the horizon at V,
shows the trend of those of the path.
Those
lines, so
far
as they are straight, vanish
below the horizon, but higher than V"" because
their slope
is not so steep as that of
the steps.
In truth, as may be seen by comparison with Ax, they may in the drawing
tend up toward the horizon, and really do so here
;
if
it were not for the contrast of the
lines in the wall we could not know whether the ground at the base of the wall sloped
up or down, or not at all.
As a matter of fact, though lines in a landscape which have
a considerable slope and
are seen obliquely — from one side, that is— sometimes dis-
play their rise or fall distinctly, the inclination
of
lines that slope away from the spec-
tator can for the most
part be shown only by the contrast of horizontal lines, those of
walls, buildings, or the sea, for instance
; and the same lines of road or terrace may be
made to seem to slope in different ways, or not to slope at all, according as the horizon-
tal lines which combine with them are differently arranged.
This is illustrated in Figs. 52
and S3, where the lines of the roads are the same, one being traced from the other, and
only those of the surrounding buildings show in the one case that the road runs up hill,
in the other that
it
is level.
Of course the change
in
the
lines of the buildings indi-
cates a change in the Station Point, because
it indicates a change in the hotizon.
Where
that is clearly visible
its level line
is sometimes enough to indicate
the direction of the
slope, though not always
; but in pictures the horizon
is very apt to be obscured.
In any view in which
the ground
slopes away from
the
spectator
the more distant
parts appear higher in the picture than the nearer
:
if they did not, they would be hidden,
as appears from Fig. 54.
Here, ^ being the
Station
Point, and FPihe picture plane,
if a
is
the brow of a
slope
or the
edge
of a
terrace,
nothing of the descending
ground will be seen which sinks below the
visual line Sam, and anything that comes
into view beyond m
will appear higher
than
«, as
the
point b
is projected into
the picture at b' above a'.
We have seen
that all lines that lie in
a
plane
must
vanish
in
the vanishing
line or horizon of
that
plane, and
conversely that
the vanishing line of a plane must
pass through
the vanishing points
of
all the lines
in
it.
We have then a convenient
means of determining the position of lines in inclined planes.
Suppose we have to draw an oblique pattern in an inclined plane, as in Fig. 55.
The
conjugate vanishing points V and V are accessible, though
off the page.
The slope
angle of the
inclined plane bed is set
off at the proper measuring point M', and finds
the vanishing
point of be at V", also accessible, in the vertical through V.

ishing line or horizon of this plane, which contains be and cd, must pass through
their
two vanishing points F'" and
V, and
is the line marked /t>Fand toV", a part of which
appears at the top of the page.
The principal dimensions on the
lines
that vanish at
Fare measured on ^F rather than bV, to avoid crowding, and
thrown up to bV, but
those on be are measured in their own plane of bed.
M' is the measuring point of be, as
well as of Af, and drawing a line
of measures bg parallel to M' V", be
is measured by
M', and the square top of the block and
its square panel are outlined.
Its vanishing
diagonal bd
is
in the inclined plane, and its vanishing
point, being
therefore in VV",
is found by producing it to that line, at O.
The middle points of the sides of the panel
are found by crossing diagonals, and the diagonal square put in
: two of its sides vanish
in O.
The pattern divides
the
sides
of
this
square into three equal parts; and their
actual length
is not important to us, but they must be set off by a point in the vanishing
line VV".
We take O for a measuring point, and drawing any convenient measuring
line mn
parallel to VV" we
trisect
that part mn of
it that
is intercepted between the
sides which vanish in O, and by measuring lines to O divide the other two sides.
This
gives us two lines, vanishing in O, which define four points of the star: the other points
and the sides of the four
little squares between the points follow easily.
Those sides
of the
star which
trisect the
sides which vanish
in O are
nearly parallel to VF'", in
which their vanishing
point would be found.
This point would be conjugate to O, but
is inaccessible, and
it is not necessary to us.
Fig. 56 shows the same principles
applied
to
the roofing of a house.
The horizon-
tal eaves
of the main house vanish
to
the
left
in
F, the
inclined ones to the right in
F'" above V: the plane
of the
visible
slope vanishes
in
its horizon
Vy'".
In the
same way the visible slopes of the L and the dormer vanish
in V'V".
The walls and
horizontal eaves are constructed by the ordinary methods.
The eaves
of the gables
are drawn upwards toward
their proper vanishing
points
: the peaks may be found by
plumbing up from cross diagonals below, or by measurement
; the eaves wliich descend
toward vanishing points below F and F' may be drawn without
these
points.
The
short valley where the main roof stops against the wall of the L is perspectively parallel
to the slope of the main gable, vanishing in
F'".
It stops and
is stopped by the hori-
zontal eaves
of the
L.
The oblique valley which joins
it
lies
in
the planes of both
roofs, being their intersection
:
its vanishing point, which must be
in both
their
hori-
zons, can only be O, the intersection of these horizons.
It stops and
is stopped by the
ridge
of the
L.
The valleys of the dormer are treated in the same way.
The dormer
and chimney may be constructed with
the
rest from a perspective
plan, or by direct
measurement.
The heights, measured on the vertical scale at a, may be transferred to
a vertical at e by lines vanishing at
F', and again to the left in the plane of the front of
the dormer, by lines vanishing
at
F.
The
positions in the roof, measured on aV, are
projected up the wall, and up slope of the roof by lines vanishing at F'".
The chimney
is constructed in the same way.
In Fig. 57
is a further application of the same
principles.
The arrangement
of the
dormer in the roof and the band
of
slates behind
it are shown in the marginal sketch.
The plane of the main roof vanishes in V V",
its eaves and ridge in
F',
its slope lines
in
F".
The plane
of the dormer roof vanishes
in
Vl^ '".
The

of the
dormer

The widths are measured on a horizontal line of

measures at A, by means of M', the overhang of the gable at its own level by M.
The
valley against the side of the dormer, being a slope
line
of the
roof, vanishes
to V".
The
pitch
of
the gable
is
first drawn
in the plane of the window, and then projected
forward
to the plane
of
the
eaves, the peak found by diagonals below, and the ridge
drawn through
it, vanishing at
V.
As in the last example, the vanishing of the oblique
valley is (9, the intersection of the horizons F^"'and V'V".
The ornament of the slating
is con.structed, like that of Fig. 55, by means of the vanishing points V" and O.
The
construction of the gable is shown more clearly in Fig. 58.
Only the projection at the
near lower corner is measured by M, the other
points following from this.
The height of the
main ridge is determined like the other heights
by the
vertical
scale
at
a.
The
ridge of the
dormer stops against the valley that vanishes
at O in Fig. 57.
It should not be
forgotten
that
of
all
the
^--3u^
lines
in an inclined plane one set of parallels

is
the
steepest,
indicating
its
pitch.
These
slope lines are
at

angles
to
all
the hori-
zontals
of the plane, and so to its intersection
with the ground plane and other horizontal planes, as the rafters of a roof are at
right
angles to the horizontal eaves.

CIRCLES
The perspective of a circle is not
a
circle except when
its plane
is
parallel
to the
picture plane, so that like any other figure
in such
a plane
it
is
projected
in
a figure
similar to itself, and then
it may be described with compasses.
In other positions
its
perspective
is
usually an ellipse, and must be determined point by point.
The easiest
way to find points enough is to enclose the
circle
in a square, and
put
the square
in
perspective
first.
Fig. 59 shows two ways of utilizing the enclosing square, one circle being
in
a verti-
cal
plane, the other
in a
horizontal.
The position
of the square being arbitrary, we
take one
side
in
or
parallel
to the picture plane
; the sides at right angles to this are
horizontal, and vanish in HH : those of the horizontal square
are
Perpendiculars and
vanish in C, those of the vertical square are oblique and vanish in
F, whose measuring
point
is M.
The sides ab and <r^of the two squares being set off in the plane of meas-
ures, and the vanishing sides measured by J/ and D respectively, in the vertical square
diagonals are drawn, as
is seen
in the smaller plan
at
the
side, and two horizontals
through the points where the diagonals intersect the circumference.
This construction,
put into perspective, gives us eight points of the circumference— the four middle points
of the sides of the square, where the circle is tangent, and the four intersections of the
diagonals and
horizontals.
The tangents show not only the position of the curve but
its direction at the points of contact, and so are a double htlp.
These eight points are
usually enough to enable the draughtsman whose eye is well trained to draw the
circle
satisfactorily unless
it is pretty large.
This method uses few lines in the
construction,
but has the disadvantage
of requiring a plan
to determine the four intersections, for
which, however, a half-plan
is
sufficient, and
this
is conveniently set against the front
side ab, as in the figure.
The point where the diagonals cross is the perspective of the
centre of the circle and of the square, but is not the centre
of the perspective
ellipse,
as is easily seen.
The second method, used
in the horizontal
circle, has the advantage
that
all the
points maybe found directly without the use of a plan.
The square
is divided into two
rectangles by the front diameter ef; and
the front side cd
is divided
into
quarters.
Diagonals ^and ed axt drawn in the nearer rectangle, and lines drawn from the quarter
points of
<:</ to
if and/ will
intersect
these diagonals on
the circumference, as maybe
geometrically proved.
Here again we have
eight
points, the four tangent points and
four intersections.
The plan, which
is given
for
illustration,
is not used
in the con-
struction.
The construction shown in Fig. 60 is convenient for describing a series of circles or
round arches in contact.
Thus, the first arch being constructed, an intermediate diag-
onal drawn through d and e' finds the crown
c' of the second arch and the vertical c'd';
a second diagonal through b' and 0' finds a", giving the data for the second
arch, and
so on, the whole with very few lines.
The process
is analogous to that described on

42
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
I"^ 60

page 19, Fig. 21, for spacing a colonnade or other
series of uniform objects.
TJie symmetrical
siiape
of the
circle allows a
square to be circumscribed wiih
its
sides
in any
direction, and there is usually no obstacle to put-
ting one side parallel
to
the picture plane.
The
only question
is when the plane
of the circle
is
inclined, — the
question
of
the vanishing point
and measuring point of the oblique sides of
the
square, which are in the horizon of the plane, and
are determined by the methods provided
for
in-
clined planes.
This will be considered later.
We get a surer control of the curve by combining with the method
of
Fig. 59
the
double square
of
Fig.
15, as in Fig. 61, where the
diagonal square gives tangents
at the 45°
points,
so
that we have
eight points and eight
tangents.
The auxiliary quadrant with its radius
at 45° fixes
the point
<r, and
the
diagonal square
is drawn
as
before.
The diagonals of the first square give the
tangent points of the
second, and
the direction
of
the curve
is shown at
all the
points.
The vanish-
ing point may be
the sub-centre corresponding
to
an
oblique plane
in which the circle lies, and CD
its horizon, D being the
sub-distance
point, and
the construction will remain the same.
It may happen
that
instead
of
having
a front
tangent ab to begin with we have a front diameter at f.
Then we have only to bisect
the diameter
at
0, draw our Perpendiculars
as
through f,
and
the
Diagonals through
0, and so find a and b.
Or
the
vertical
distance
points may be
out
of reach (Fig. 62).
Then we may find
the 45° tangent points (/and d' in the usual
way, as
in
Fig. 59, and draw through them
the
sides
edh
and
ed'h'
of
the
diagonal
square, which is then easily completed.
When we have to draw a round
arch cut
through a wall, the curve at the back of the
wall, being geometrically equal and parallel
to that in the face, is to be constructed in the same way in a plane parallel to the plane
of the
face, and behind
it at a distance equal
to the thickness
of the wall
(Fig. 63).
The soffit of the arch is a cylinder whose axis
is
horizontal and perpendicular
to the
face of the
wall, and
so vanishes
in V coordinate with V.
Every constructive point
for the rear curve is to be found directly behind the corresponding point
for the front

curve, at a distance equal to the thickness
of the

that van-
ishes in

In Fig. 63 the front curve
is constructed by the method of diagonal squares
shown in Fig. 6t, abed being half of the primary square, and gjh of the diagonal square.
The point
e', corresponding to
e, is found by measuring off the thickness em of the wall
on e(^ vanishing in
V.
Other points may be found
in the same way, but
if
the vertical
distance points are
at hand, may be fixed by their help as here by lines
e'g', e'h', etc.
more simply and securely than by measuring oiT each one independently
; and the rear
curve, which
in
perspective
is
not
exactly
parallel
to
the
front curve,
is traced by
means
of them.
The doorway at
the
landing of the
steps
in
Fig. 43 would be
con'
structed
in
this way.
The
joints
of the voussoirs seen on
the
face
of
the
wall
all
radiate from the centre of the arch
; those on
the
soffit vanish
in the
vanishing point
V, and the surfaces
of the
joints
are
in a series of planes which meet in the line 00'
that joins the centres of the arch lines.
The drawing of
circles
in
perspective, since they are constructed by points at inter-
vals, necessarily depends much on the draughtsman's eye, for to construct points close
enough together to leave nothing
to
his judgment would be very laborious and uncer-
tain.
It is only by careful attention that one learns the curves sufficiently well to draw
them
satisfactorily.
Most painters and most dravighfsmen,
it
is
safe
to
say, do not
give
this
attention.
The ovals
in which
circles
are projected have a great deal
of
beauty in
their delicately graduated curvature, espe-
cially when they are much foreshortened, and the eye
^
^^^
that
is
not
attentive to this beauty is not competent
-^p-
'"'|
to deal with them.
So
it
is that comparatively few
j
|
painters
put into their pictures an
arcade or a round
tower banded
with
string-courses
at
which
an
eye
_
trained
to such things can
look without
disappoint-
ment, or even draw a bell or a mug
void
of
offence.
The
relation
of the successive string-courses
of the
round tower is full of grace which is often unseen by those who paint them (Plate XIV,
Chaumont).
The
rings merge into the vertical lines by delicate tangent curves, yet
it
is common to see them drawn with a corner as at A in Fig. 64, and to find the cornices
one above another so spread as to
tilt at all sorts of angles with the horizontal.
It
is common, even among
artists, to
believe
that
the
perspective ellipse of a ver-
tical
circle stands upright, that
is, that
its
longest diameter
is vertical, and
that of a
horizontal
circle
level
; but
this
is
true only when the centre
of the vertical
circle
is on
the Horizon Line, and
that of the
v.
|
horizontal
directly over
or under
the Centre.
In
other
posi-
tions the long axis is neither vertical nor horizontal, but inclined
\
.
1
_7J^ 4S'
toward the Centre without pointing to
it, as in Fig. 65.
This
inclination
is often disagreeably conspicuous when
the circle is
far from
the
centre, especially in vertical
circles which are en-
closed between
upright
lines, as in a clock
tower.
Examples
may be seen in many photographs.
That from the Broletto of
Como
is one
(PI. XV), and
is sometimes
incredible to artists
who have not studied such cases.
It is an example out of many

44
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
to show us that nature is full of things that do not look well
in
pictures.
It is perhaps
well in sketching such views for picturesque uses to change
slightly the
inclination
of
the axis rather than draw what
is disagreeable to most eyes ; but a better remedy is to
avoid,
as most painters would,
a point
of view which
leads to such appearances of
distortion.
The curves of perspective
circles
are the more sensitive to distortion
in
that they
are symmetrical.
The ends of the ellipse, where the curvature is sharpest, are the most
troublesome parts, and
it is often
of advantage
to get additional points and tangents
at
these
parts.
But
so much depends on the guidance
of the eye
in
the
curves, so
much labor may be saved
in
constructions that
are not
critical by reducing the num-
ber of points
that have to be found, and so much of the
beauty of a picture in which
circles are prominent depends on giving the
right character
to
the curves, that
it
is
important to discipline
the eye by the
habit
of drawing
circles from nature
till their
character becomes familiar.
There will still be enough to do in construction
if we wish
to get the curves into the right places
; and
no one knows
this so well as he who best
knows what a perspective
circle
is
like.
The critical
parts, as was
just
said, are
the
ends of the ellipse, especially if they are much flattened, and
the
temptation
to make
them
swollen, as at A, Fig. 66, or pinched and sharp, as at £,
is more
besetting than one might imagine.
For this reason
it
is
desirable
to
multiply points
in
these parts more than elsewhere, when
the
size
of
the circles gives occasion for
it, and
to add
tangents, which show not
only the position of the line but its direction.
It may be thought that
a
fair
experience
in
free-hand
drawing would make
a draughtsman
independent of constructive methods
in
this
; but a moderate
famil-
iarity with
perspective
will convince
him
that
this
is
not the
case.
On the other hand, even when the points are found with extreme care they
will sway a
trifle
this way or that from their precise position, enough
to mar the curve, whose flow
may depend on
the
thickness
of a
line.
Here
the
last refinement must come from
the draughtsman's sense of line.
The question may naturally be asked, and
is some-
times asked
: What is
the use
of measuring and constructing
if
all
this
is
not more
exact than sketching by the eye ?
But the eye, which detects variations in continuity
that are too small to measure,
is yet an uncertain judge of position.
Here the paradox
applies which
is true in
all fine drawing, — iax placing curves the eye
is an inadequate
guide where
precision is necessary
:
for actually drawing them measurement
alone
is
not fine enough.

CHAUMONT, CHATEAU


THE CONSTRUCTION OF PICTURES
We have seen
that the
effects
of perspective
are due to foreshortening by oblique
projection on
the
picture plane, and
that variations
in
this foreshortening are main
sources
of
the
interest we take
in
the aspects of the
things which we
depict.
But
some
of these
foreshortenings are agreeable, and some are not ; and though
it
is not
possible
to
classify them fully, we can note some
of
their favorable and unfavorable
conditions.
Perspective foreshortening
affects only lines and
surfaces which are oblique
to the
picture, and
these unequally, the
farther parts being diminished more than
the
near.
We have seen how fast a horizontal surface like a floor or
the
sea shrinks together as
it retires into the distance.
We have seen that the length of the Axis repeated behind
the
picture covers
half the distance to the extreme horizon, which may be miles away,
so that the
last mile may be shrunk to
the thickness of a line.
In like manner figures
and
trees, or the windows and columns of a building, are to the eye crowded together
as they retire faster than they diminish
in
size.
This may in some cases be an advan-
tage, lending
intricacy and mystery to
the
picture, but
in
others
it
is
a disadvantage,
interfering with clearness, especially in architectural subjects, and lessening the appear-
ance
of distance.
We
notice
often the
unsatisfactory effect
of a long colonnade or
arcade, in the gappy look of the near parts contrasted with the crowding of the distant.
It might be thought that this crowding of
far-off objects would add to the impression
of distance, but
it
is not
so.
If we examine a photographic view down the long nave
of a church, or a
pillared aisle, we
shall find that, unless we can count the pillars, the
side on which they are crowded
close looks
shorter, and
that
the end on
the other
side looks farther off.
This fact helps in certain tricks of perspective that the architects of the Renaissance
used to play.
In
Palladio's Teatro Olimpico
at Verona the stage
is
set with a
street
seen endwise, lined
with
models
of houses which
diminish
in
scale
as they recede
from
the
front, so that
a
street
forty feet
long
or so seems to extend
an eighth of a
mile.
The effect
is greatly increased by the narrowing
of
the
street
as
it
retires, by
which
the buildings are brought forward and displayed instead
of crowding at the far
end.
Exactly the opposite
effect
is shown
in
the colonnades which Bernini
prefixed
to the front of St. Peter's at Rome.
Here
the
galleries on each side which lead up to
the
front, enclosing an open
court, spread apart
as they approach the church instead
of converging, and
the columns crowd together
in
the view much more than
if
their
lines were parallel.
Consequently the colonnades are robbed of their apparent length,
and
it
is
difficult, as may be seen from the figure
in
Plate XVI, for the spectator to
believe that the court
is as deep as
it
is wide, which
is really the case.
Viewed from
the church, however, the colonnades seem lengthened out.
It is not only the crowding of parts that mars the effect of long lines reaching into the
distance
: not only are the farther divisions diminished by foreshortening, but the rate

46
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
I'
^
^
of foreshortening increases rapidly, the farth-r parts being seen much more obliquely
than the
near.
If an
arcade or colonnade
starts near the front, where
it looks very
open, the foreslioriening increases so that the disiance often looks out of harmony with
the foreground.
This dissonance, which is not felt where the line is broken by a marked
angle, because the eye does not expect broken lines to agree in foreshortening, may be
a disfigurement where the lines are continuous, whereas
the abrupt change at an angle
makes an effect of contrast which
is apt to be pleasing.
The more nearly parallel the
lines are to the line of vision, the more extreme
is the foreshortening.
In Perpendicu-
lars
it becomes excessive as they are prolonged to .near the Centre, where the vanishing
lines are viewed very obliquely, and that
is one of the difficulties of parallel perspective.
In
this kind of perspective
there
is some disadvantage in a long Axis, as appears in
Fig. 67, where, from the
Station
Point 5', the perpendicular distance Ax is foreshort-
ened
into the length Aa, while
as seen from S it occupies Ab.
But on the other hand, inasmuch
as the Perpendicular vanishes
at C,
all
its length beyond x', seen from S,
is foreshortened into
the length Cc, while from S'
it covers Cb.
Thus the advantage
of a near
Station
Point and
short Axis
is confined to opening
out those parts which are near the front, while the disproportion-
ate compression
of
the
distant parts
is aggravated by
it.
The
advantage is with the long Axis unless the important parts of the
picture are near the picture plane.
The opening out of the dis-
tance of a picture
is achieved by raising the Horizon Line, and
with
it the eye, which displays
the
floor, so to speak
; or
it may
be opened on either side by moving the Centre to the other side,
as we have seen in looking down the colonnaded aisles just men-
tioned.
It may be noticed
also that in parallel perspective the impor-
tant lines are the
Perpendiculars, for they alone show the effect
of perspective, so
that
this construction
is used
chiefly for in-
teriors and
street
scenes, where these lines prevail.
The lines
which are at right angles with
these being front lines, the parts
of the picture which are constructed on them are seen in geometrical elevation, and are
comparatively uninteresting.
They are kept subordinate therefore, and appear best near
the Centre, where they are
in
the
distance and the
parts
are
small in scale, and are
moreover apt to be framed in by balanced
Perpendiculars on each
side.
In the fore-
ground the front lines come naturally into the margins of the picture plane where they
are unbalanced, and subject to distortion, as we shall see.
They are therefore trouble-
some, and as a rule the less they are shown
the
better.
Indeed,
it
is very common
to
cut them off altogether in this position, and with advantage to the picture.
In interiors
the depth of the view is usually comparatively small, so that the displaying of
the near
parts which comes with a short Axis may not be a disadvantage.
In other forms
of
perspective, where
the
principal
lines
are
not Perpendiculars,
extreme changes of foreshortening are not
less unbecoming
; and when, as someti.mes
happens, convenience requires us to represent apart of our picture that stands before the
picture plane,
it may become very disturbing.

cd may be
projected from
different
Station Points with
very different
rates
of
fore-
siiortening.
The two projections ay and ox
from
3' differ very much, while
those from
S', ay' and ox', are more nearly equal.
The
variations seen from S, confined in the pic-
ture between y and
o, would probably look
extreme;
those seen from
S\ between
_j'' —^
and x', are likely to be more agreeable.
On
the
whole,
the
longer
Axis
gives
almost
always the more agreeable
effect.
Drawings made
in
Isometric
Projection,
which is perspective with the Station Point
at
an
infinite
distance, show, to
be
sure,
the monotony of division which an
inordi-
nately long .^xis may give; but the practical
difficulty of using a very long Axis
is safeguard enough, and the ugliness of isometric
drawings is due to the equal angles of the three
sets of lines, and to their lack of con-
vergence, which disappoints the eye,
still more than to monotony of foreshortening.
Drawings with two or three vanishing points are apt to be built on conjugate points,
so that one point recedes as the other advances.
We have noticed before that vanish-
ing points at equal distances from
the Centre are unsatisfactory because they give two
series of lines with equal convergence, which
is
stiff.
The stiffness
is made more
dis-
agreeable
if a building or other rectangular object is so set that the Horizon Line bisects
it, giving equal slopes to lines above and below the horizon.
No
fault
is commoner in
photographing
than
to
take
buildings
from
too high
a point
of view, especially the
interiors of churches, which are often
spoiled in order to humor the infirmity of a poor
lens, by taking
the camera up to
the triforium, and showing half the height below the
horizon level.
Even exterior views are constantly marred by the necessity of carrying
the camera close to a building and so bringing the vanishing points near together.
The
recent invention
of telescopic photographing
relieves much
difficulty when
it can be
used, not only because
it obviates various
distortions due
to short axes, which will be
presently noticed, but because
the remote vanishing points of a distant view are very
becoming to buildings.
Whatever
is true of photogtaphic views is true of perspective
drawings, because photography
is
perspective.
It
is well
in
pictures
of buildings
to
make the most of their horizontal lines, for on these depend the breadth and repose of
their architecture.
Even when
picturesque grouping or the upward shoot of a Gothic
design tempt one to emphasize the vertical lines, we may remember that a near vanish-
ing point and steeply converging lines rob the building of its height.
In placing the picture plane
it
is naturally desirable to show most of the more inter-
esting
side
of
the building; when other
things
are equal we are apt
to get the best
effect by giving the long vanishing lines to the broader side and the foreshortened view
to the narrower
: and the contrast of a very considerable difference
in the distances of
the
points
is
of value.
The student
will do well
to
rid
himself as early as
possible
of the tyranny of
his sheet of paper, and learn to use vanishing points outside
it, or to
employ some of the devices which are provided for drawing lines to inaccessible vanish-

48
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
ing points.
When he is constrained to keep these points within fixed limits he will find
as appears in Fig. 69 that for a given distance VV between conjugate points, since the
Station Point must be on the semicircumference VSV, the longest
Axis is got by putting the Centre in the middle of VV at C; for the
Axis SC, being the radius, is longer than any other half-chord S'C.
In this case f'and V become also distance
points, CKand CV
being equal to SC.
There
is some practical convenience in
this
construction, and a great many architectural drawings are made by
it.
The increased length of the Axis is worth something, yet the
difference
is usually slight, and there
are
losses which outweigh
the gain.
If the chief object
is put at the Centre, the lines slope
equally both ways.
The slopes may be made unequal,
it is true,
by setting the object aside from the
Centre.
In
Figs. 70 and
71
the same cube
is shown under two conditions.
The distance VV
is the same, the cube is set with its front edge in the same position
between them, and at the same height on the Horizon Line, so that
the lines slope alike in the two figures.
But the different positions
of the measuring points give quite different proportions to the two
pictures.
In
Fig. 71 the
object, being
at the
Centre,
is
likely to be viewed from the
right point, and
to look natural.
In Fig. 70
it
is on one side, and likely to be viewed
from the wrong point
; the farther from the Centre
it
is, the more danger.
There
is a
certain distortion in drawing the object in this position which we shall have to consider.
If
it
is only a cube, or other simple rectangular form, as here,
it may not suffer by the
change; but if it is more complicated
it will probably look deformed.
Figs. 72 and 73
show the same cube prolonged
into the
shaft
of
a square tower, and capped with a
pyramidal
roof.
The
effect of foreshortening
is in Fig. 72 to drag the peak and the
vertical
axis of the tower toward the middle, and
the roof does not sit well.
In Figs.
74 and 75 the angles of the tower are cut
off, turning
it
into an octagon.
In Fig. 74
not only is the axis of the tower drawn toward the middle
as before in Fig. 72, but the
broken line of the eaves
is unpleasantly distorted, seeming to be out of
level.
Yet the
tower is not very far from the Centre, the distance being only one
third the length of
the
Axis, and so quite
within
the
limit commonly allowed.
If we fix the eye
at the
proper distance just in front of C, the axis of the tower will seem to draw back into
its
proper
position and the awkwardness of the eaves line to disappear, but
if the tower
is the principal object
in the
picture,
it is not likely to be looked at from this position,
the universal temptation being to put the eye directly in front of the thing we look at.
In the round towers, Figs. 76 and 77, the distortion
is still more unpleasant, being unre-
lieved by vertical lines.

PERSPECTIVE DISTORTION
An objection
that
is brought against perspective
is
that an object
of known form,
carefully constructed by
it, will sometimes look wrong,
like the eaves of the octagonal
tower in Fig. 74, and even seem offensively distorted.
It
is indeed inevitable that when
the eye leaves
the Station Point the foreshortenings, adapted
to
the old point of view,
should
not suit the new.
We need
to bear in mind the
distinction between graphical
foreshortening and
visual.
The
first
occurs when
the
lines,
being
oblique
to
the
picture plane, are projected on
it smaller (or larger) than they would be
if they faced
it; the second when lines, being
oblique
to
the
line of vision, look shorter than
they
would
if they faced the eye.
The two may occur together, or either without the other ;
for a line may be parallel to the picture plane
and oblique to the
line
of
vision, or may front
&
, - ' ''
^
the eye and be oblique to the
picture plane, or
^^'
\
^
it may be oblique to both.
The difficulty is in

^'^•7°
^\'
this foreshortening, and
all other parts suffer it
_,
$
in proportion
as they recede from the Centre,
because they are viewed obliquely.
This is to say that from
the
Station
Point every
part but the Centre looks smaller than
it is drawn, or, in other words,
is drawn
larger
than
it
is
intended
to
look, in
proportion
as
it
recedes from the Centre
; and
the
perspective construction provides for this.
Inevitably, when the eye leaves the Station
Point
the
parts which come opposite
it
are seen
to be stretched
out
in directions
radiating from the Centre.
In Fig. 78 the two equal horizontal lines ab and
cd, front-
ing the Station Point at equal distances, are not visually foreshortened, but are projected
into
the
picture plane
in two
lines hg and fd which
are quite unequal.
The visual
foreshortening oi fd corrects the inequality, so
that from »S they subtend equal angles
and look of equal length.
But when once the lines are drawn in the picture,
if the eye
is shifted to S', opposite /</, not only is the line seen to be longer than gh, but the visual
foreshortening due to the new position makes ^/^ look still shorter, and their dispropor-
tion
is aggravated, the angles which they subtend being changed, so
that noticeable
distortion
is likely to follow.
It
is obvious
that, the foreshortening in the picture itself being everywhere
in the

so
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
^/f
direction of the Centre, to the eye at ^ the whole picture crowds in toward the Centre,
looking smaller than
it
really
is, as every flat
'
surface
does.
The
perspective
construction
meets
this
by expanding
everything
in
lines
that
radiate from the
Centre,
so
that objects
in the margin
of the
picture
are drawn
larger
than they look, being stretched out away from
^
the Centre, as
if by a
centrifugal force.
This
stretching out, seen from S, exactly covers and
neutralizes the
visual
foreshortening,
so
that
the picture looks right, but
as soon as the eye
leaves S^ and passes over
to
one
margin, we
perceive
the
distortion
there, and the objects
^
shown
there
look
misshapen.
A
sphere,
for
example, which always looks round to the eye,
is projected, unless
it comes
right in the Centre, into an
ellipse, so that its long axis
points to the
Centre.
A ring
of spheres centred upon the Axis would be constructed
in the picture as in Fig. 79, but to an eye at the Station Point all these radiating ellipses
would be foreshortened into circles.
It
is
this
stretching
in one direction
that distorts the pictures of detached objects:
if it were
in
all
directions
they would only be magnified.
Inasmuch as the distortion
is radial, objects in the Horizon Line have no vertical stretching, and those above and
below the Centre no
horizontal.
Equal
spheres, standing
in
a
horizontal front line,
are drawn of equal height, but their pictures grow wider and wider as they recede from
the
centre, and
so with
a range
of columns
or a rank
of soldiers:
they grow fatter
toward the margin of the picture.
A file of figures climbing a ladder would grow taller
as
they rose above
the ground without
getting any stouter.
The increase would be
more rapid
as
the
Axis was
shorter, and would be visible to an eye at the margin
of
the picture.
So long as such objects are clustered about the Centre, the distortion
is
not great enough to be disturbing
: a long Axis and a narrow picture are in most cases
sufficient precaution
against them, but even within the ordinary limits
they will some-
times give
offence.
We have seen in Figs. 74 and 75 how the moving of the tower out
of the Centre for the sake of giving unequal
slopes to the vanishing lines has given a
false look to
it.
It
is
impossible to hold the spectator's eye to the Station
Point:
the
eye will wander, and the picture in which such things occur will give offence.
The
questions
naturally
occur: How
are
these
distortions
avoided
in
pictures
sketched
directly from nature
?
And
if we cannot correct them by perspective, why
use
it ?
When we look
at an object or view as a picture, we instinctively refer
it to a picture
plane squarely in front of our eye, that
is, at
right angles to our axis of vision.
If we
hold up a sheet of paper to test directions or dimensions, we hold
it
right
across the
line of vision, and change its position and direction
to
suit every successive
object we
look
at.
We do not think of a picture plane held rigidly in one position and everything
referred to that, whether the lines of vision strike
it squarely or obliquely.
We look at
things not simultaneously but successively, and change the picture plane every time we

turn our eye.
When we sketch, we turn from one point to another, changing the plane
as we go, and our picture is in the end
not
one
projection, but a series of projections
on different planes.
A man who paints a panorama turns from point to point, sketching
as he
turns,
till presently
his back
is turned where he faced
before, and he keeps
on turning with his
picture plane until he has gone round the whole
circle of the
hori-
zon and come back
to
his
lirst
position.
The sketcher, working from nature, does
just this so far as he goes.
His picture
is
a piece of a panorama.
If we look high
up instead
of turning
horizontally, the effect is similar
:
as we look higher the picture
plane
slopes toward
us, overhead
it
is
horizontal
;
if we painted
the
whole
sky,
it
would come down
to
the
horizon
behind
us.
The innumerable fragtnentary picture
planes on which our picture
is thrown would
if put together make not a plane but a
sphere, with our eye at
its centre.
When the panorama, which is horizontal, is finished,
it cannot be viewed spread out, but must be rolled up into a
belt, of which we occupy
the centre, or else unrolled before us
bit by
bit.
If the panorama instead
of
a belt
took in the whole sky,
it would be a hemisphere, and could not be unrolled.
Sketching,
too, unless
it
is
confined
to
the
neighborhood of the horizon,
is
in
fact drawing by
spherical
projection.
But
to construct perspective drawings by spherical projection
is
impracticable, and
they would be
impracticable
for use
if they were constructed.
They have
to be made on
a
table
or
a drawing
board, and
kept
flat.
Sketching,
which accommodates the
projection unwittingly to
a
flat surface,
is not
scientifically
exact, and
is discontinuous, though the
dislocations which
it
occasions
are often
less
conspicuous than those which perspective shows to the displaced eye.
But what is
to be done with
perspective drawings under these conditions ?
Shall
we
reject them ?
or
put up with
their
shortcomings ?
The
treatment
of
isolated
objects
is not
difficult.
Where
their principal dimension
has been determined, their
outline may be
modified
to
suit
their known
proportions.
A sphere
is drawn
as a
circle because
it always looks like one.
A human figure or an animal
is always drawn
with a free hand
; the only use of perspective for
it
is to determine
its scale.
A circle,
which as we have seen often takes
a shape
that looks queer, owing to the unexpected
inclination of
its axes, may be modified so as to bring
it into harmony with the straight
lines about
it:
at
the same time the draughtsman
should
accustom
himself
to the
looks of circles in nature, so that he may not be disturbed at seeing
in a picture what
he would see in
nature
if he watched.
Some concession may be made to the common
desire
to
see the
axis
of a
circle
upright, but
it
is easy to make too much.
Other
objects of geometric shapes may be first constructed and then
if necessary modified so
as to be subdued
into unoffending form.
Since
it
is the eye
that protests, the eye
is
the only guide in modifying
; but naturally
it needs to be a trained eye.
When
it comes
to
objects
that are
not
isolated, but
parts
of larger wholes, or to
subjects like architecture, which involve large combinations of lines, the questions
are
more difficult, for changes
in a detail may throw a combination out
of gear.
Separate
features like capitals and bases, which may come in unfortunate positions, often require
that their perspective shall be amended, as we may see
in
photographs, in
Plate XV
for instance, or in perspectives constructed without that indulgence.
The amendment
is a matter for knowledge,
skill, and judgment
;
naturally
it should be
as
slight
as
can be accepted, and with care not
to
injure relations with the
rest of the building.

52
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
Columns and balustrades which tend
to obesity as they draw away from the Centre
may be starved down to their due proportions, and as this is likely to widen
the
inter-
vals between them unduly it may sometimes be
well
to shorten
the whole range,
if
it
can be done without doing harm elsewhere.
But the most effective remedies are in rightly arranging the picture.
We can restrict
the area, at least that of the parts which require perspective construction, to the neigh-
borhood of the Centre.
We can
attract the
spectator's eye
as much
as possible
to
the Centre whether
it
is the middle of the picture or not, and occupy the remote parts
with forms
in which perspective
is not
important.
The greatest embarrassment
is
found
in
large architectural views, as where connected buildings
fill
the picture.
In
such views,
if the visual
angle
of the
picture
is
great,
the
relative
size
of the parts
will be changed
:
the proportions of the ends
of' buildings may be unpleasantly dis-
turbed
if the
picture is wide, or of the upper parts if it is high.
Plate XVIII, of the
castle
at
Urbino,
shows the
distortion
of
a
high picture.
The
fault
is
not
in
the
photograph, but in the point of view, which
is so near that the top of the towers, being
three times as far from the Centre
as
their bases, are too
far off for safe perspective,
and
their cornices and cupolas
are
most
unpleasantly distorted.
An analogous vio-
lence, not amounting
to distortion, may be done to the proportion
of a building, even
when the whole is close to the Centre,
if the
Station
Point is so near
that the
far-off
parts are much diminished by
distance, and some part which should be dominant
is
reduced to insignificance, or parts that balance each other are made plainly unequal, as
in the Treasury
Building, Plate XIX.
The remedy
is
in
a long Axis or a change of
view.
Photographs
taken
with
a
telescopic
lens
are
often
a
useful
lesson
in
this
respect, showing how the gently converging
lines
that go with a distant Station Point
preserve
proportions, and
lend
an
expression
of
unvexed
tranquillity
that
is very
becoming to architecture.
In discussing parallel perspective, we noticed the disagreeable effect that sometimes
comes with the contrast
of perpendiculars vanishing
to
the
Centre, and uniting with
front lines which are parallel.
When the meeting
is well to one side of the Centre, so
that the perpendiculars do not converge
sharply, but make a visibly obtuse angle with
the front lines, the effect is very apt to be unpleas-
ant.
The eye, used
to lines at right angles vanish-
ing both ways,
is almost persuaded
that the
front
lines actually diverge from the angle, and that both
»>

'
sets vanish
in the same
direction.
It
is better so

the drawing so that, while the

them,
if almost
insensibly.

Plate XVIII, of the transept of Cremona cathedral,
shows a still worse deformity, yet
correctly photographed, where one
set of
horizontal
lines at the top of the tower on the left seems to vanish on the wrong side.
Here both

PERSPECTIVE DISTORTION
53
sets
of
lines
actually do vanish in the same
direction, the conjugate vanishing points
being both on the same side of the tower; and the effect is intolerable.
The difficulty
comes from the fact that, given the position of the lines
in
the principal
face
of the
tower, we expect to see the other vanishing lines on the side opposite to the vanishing
point of the
first, that
is, on
the
left
instead
of
the
right.
We see round the wrong
corner, in fact, and the acute angle on the left is very ugly.
This means that a rectan-
gular object should be so placed
that its horizontal
lines vanish both ways
;
it should
not be
set so far from the
Centre, or so
turned, that we
see
the
side
of
it towards
which the horizontals of the principal face converge.
In Fig. 80 we see that the square
A. which may represent the plan of a cube or a square tower,
is so turned that from 6'
the retreating face of the object will be seen on the right of the principal face, and the
horizontals in both
faces will vanish on that side, like the Cremona tower, while in D,
seen differently, the sides vanish in opposite directions.

CURVILINEAR PERSPECTIVE
It is sometimes urged that in nature even straight lines look curved, tending as they
do to meet their parallels in a vanishing point at each end.
This is true, provided they
are long enough.
We see
it
in the
rays of
light that stretch across the whole sky at
sunrise or sunset.
It
is equally true of the lines of a perspective drawing.
If they are
extended far enough, they too will look curved.
But the vanishing points of a straight
line are at opposite ends of the world, and cannot be put in the same plane-picture, nor
can enough
of any line
to display the apparent curvature
ordinarily be included in a
drawing.
If
it were, the drawn line would
also look
curved.
Yet the fact that as we
turn the eye successively toward
the opposite ends
of a
series of
parallel
lines, the
cornices that border a long street for instance, we see them converge both ways, has led
some men to insist that they should be drawn
so
in one and the same picture, and to
devise ways of doing this.
It
is done as in panoramas, by projecting the view as on a
vertical cylinder with the Station Point in
its axis, which cylinder is unrolled into a flat
picture.
In
the
plan, Fig. 8i, the two equal
circles A and A' representing towers or
shafts
of columns,
are
projected
from
the
same
Station
Point S on
the
picture plane
and on the cylindrical surface, the first in ab,
which
is
practically the same on
both
sur-
faces, the second
in a"b" on the plane and
a'b' on
the cylinder.
The Centre C
is here
taken as the common tangent point of plane
and
cylinder, and
it
is
clear that while the
projection a"b" is larger than ab, or even than
the
width
of
the
object
A',
being made
obliquely on PP^ a'b' is considerably less, —
less than the diameter of A' or even than ab,
as would be the natural appearance. A' being farther than A from the eye at 6".
C may
for comparison be taken
for a Centre on the cylindrical surface ab', but properly the
Centre may be anywhere on its horizon
line, or nowhere, for any radius, being normal
to the
cylinder, may be
called the Axis, and no point
in
its horizon line has different
properties from any other.
There being no Centre, there
are no Diagonals, and no
distance
points, and though there are vanishing points,
for these are phenomena
of
vision, and not of the picture, the whole apparatus of measuring is done away with, and
the picture must be constructed by conical projection
in
the manner
described above
as the natural system, the horizontal projections being taken from a plan, as in Fig. 8i,
and the heights from a side projection or elevation.
Straight lines projected on the cylinder look straight from the Station Point, of course,
but are really hoops centred on that point, as the
horizon
is
in space
; and all but the
Horizon Line are ellipses, being sections of the cylinder by oblique visual planes, while

the vanishing points are the points where these ellipses intersect the Horizon Line on
opposite sides of the cylinder.
When the cylinder is developed, — unrolled, that
is, —
these sections become elongated
curves, like
all oblique plane sections of a cylinder,
except the Horizon Line, which, being a
right
section, becomes a straight
line.
The
extreme
possible length
of such
a
picture
unrolled, taking
in
the whole horizon and
returning into itself,
is only the circumference of the cylinder, and the distance between
vanishing points
of any straight
line
is
half
the circumference, corresponding to
the
theoretical but impossible projection of half the horizon on a plane surface, so that the
picture is narrowed within convenient limits, instead of being extended enormously when
it assumes to take in a wide area.
Fig. 82 shows the projections of Fig. 8i on the pic-
ture
surfaces,
at B the regular plane
perspective
construction, at D the
cylinder developed.
It will
be seen how the projections widen in the first as they
withdraw from
the Centre, and how any limit
nar-
rows
the width
of
the
cylindrical
picture when
it
—
is unrolled.
This
is a considerable advantage, the
only resource,
in
truth, when one
takes
in a very
wide area; but the
fact that
all but
vertical
lines
come out conspicuously curved makes
it impossible
-2>
to represent the straightness of a long building or
_
street, bringing distortions
that no change of posi-

tion by the spectator will cure, and that often are as oflEensive as those that are amended.
This fact, with the labor and difficulty of making large drawings
in which
all the
lines
but
the verticals
are curves
to be constructed point by point,
like
circles
in ordinary
perspective, makes curvilinear perspective too laborious, and after
all too unsatisfying,
to find much use in ordinary pictures.
Plate XIX shows part of a panoramic view of Paris, photographed on a cylinder with
a revolving camera, and
then
unrolled, so that
it
is in true cylindrical perspective.
It
will be seen that the only straight horizontal line in
it is the Horizon Line.
The lines
of the principal building, the Hotel de Ville, which are really as straight as they can be
built, are conspicuously curved
in
the
picture, and
those
of the adjoining buildings,
which are parallel to them, are warped
into
a crescent.
The main
proportions
of the
building are preserved as they would not have been in a plane photograph, but at the
cost
of very
unflattering
distortion.
If, however, the
picture were
rolled up
into
a
cylinder of the right diameter, and viewed from the axis of the cylinder at the height of
the Horizon Line, the curves would straighten to the eye, and the distortion disappear.

PART
II


PERSPECTIVE HELPS
Perspective construction by direct projection from a plan
is the most direct following
out of ihe geometric process of vision.
It is in many simple problems the easiest method
of making a perspective picture, and
is made useful in the preliminaries of many more.
One or two of our first problems were solved by it.
Yet the most conspicuous phenom-
enon of any perspective view
is the convergence of
lines that
in nature are parallel.
The use of vanishing points not only keeps the artist's attention fixed on this phenome-
non, the most characteristic, and therefore to him the most essential, but it
is the surest
method
;
for, the vanishing points once
placed, the
lines that
are drawn
to them
are
compelled into
their
true
relation
to each
other.
It
is an education to the eye, for a
painter who does not
feel
that
certain separated lines converge to a certain point will
never draw them quite right, and
his work will not satisfy a more instructed or a more
sensitive eye than his own.
It is
also usually the simplest way, for when we have the
vanishing point
there
is only one point
left
to determine instead of two, in order to
place any line.
When we have to place a close series of parallel lines, as in drawing a
cornice or a group of mouldings,
it is extremely difficult to get their true convergence, on
which the right look of the drawing depends,
if both ends of each line have to be fixed
point by point:
it is very laborious, and seldom
quite
successful.
The inconvenience
is so much felt that draughtsmen are constantly tempted to mar their drawings by using
vanishing points
that are too near rather than do without them, because those that are
far off are awkward.
Perspective drawings, especially large
ones, look
so much better with far-off vanish-
ing points that various contrivances have been devised under the name of Centrolineads
for drawing lines toward an
inaccessible point
of convergence.
Perhaps the simplest
is a metal plate, cut to a circular
arc and
pinned
to the drawing board, against which
traverses a T-square by two
pins set in the head, as
is shown in Fig. 83.
The centre
of
the arc
is the vanishing
point, and
as
the
two
pins
traverse
the
arc
the
line
aa
that
p//
joins them
is
a chord.
The working edge of

point.
The two edges of the plate can be cut to
different arcs and so give two different distances
for
V.
The device is simple and practical, but
its convenience is narrowed because
it can only be set to fixed distances.
Another centrolinead, which obviates
this
difBculty,
is a T-square with isosceles tri-
angular head traversing between two fixed pins, as in Fig. 84.
Here again the line aa
may be conceived as the chord of a circle, whose arc will be described by the point
b
at
the vertex of the triangle.
If the working edge is set to bisect the angle b,
it will

6o
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
always point to the farther extremity
Foi that diameter of the circle which
bisects the
chord
aa.
According as
the pins are set nearer or farther apart,
the
chord
and
the
diameter
of
the
circle
will diminish
or
increase,
and
the
vanishing
point
approach or
re-
cede.
By reversing the blade
of the
square, so that
it shall point toward F
instead of from
it, the instrument may
be accommodated
to short distances.
This may be accomplished by making the head a lozenge, as shown by dotted lines
in
Fig. 84.
Note.
The geometrical theory of this centrolinead is simple.
Let a and a (Fig. 84) be the
two pins, and 6^ the line of the edge of the T-square prolonged
to
F.
The angle 6 traverses
the arc aca, and F is at the extremity of the diameter co V, perpendicular to aa.
Since the angle
aba is bisected, the two angles abF ^rt equal.
Being equal inscribed
angles, they must stand
on equal arcs:
therefore the arcs aFare equal, and F\s always the middle point of the arc aFa.
The size of the circle depends both on the angle of the instrument aba, and on the distance aa,
which is a matter of adjustment; but the ratio of aa to cF\& constant for anyone instrument.
A system
of perspective, however, which depends
solely on vanishing points and
direct projection
is incomplete.
It continually happens
in
large drawings, or in scene
painting, or
in
pictures on canvas, that some needed vanishing point
is out of reach.
There is occasion
in
the problem
of the
steps and others (Figs. 50, 113, 122) to con-
struct lines for an inaccessible vanishing point.
Suppose we have two lines ab and cd running to the same inaccessible point (Fig. 85),
and wish to draw another line through m to the
same point.
We may join the
lines by any two
parallels ac and bd, one passing through m : the
problem
is equivalent
to dividing ac at n in the
ratio in which bd is divided
at m.
We join
be.
Through m we draw mo parallel to cd, and through
the
intersection o draw on parallel to ah, cutting
ac in «.
Then mn will be the required line.
Note.
Since am
is
parallel
to
cd, we
have
bm : md — bo : oc, and
in
like
manner
since
c«
is
parallel
to
ab, an : nc = bo : oc.
Hence
bm : md= an : nc.
That is, ac and bd are divided proportionally, and ab, mn, and cd meet in
one point.
The following method, already used in Fig. 50,
is often more convenient when there
are several lines to be drawn
to the same inaccessible point
F, whose distance from a
given point C, say the Centre,
is known.
If we wish to draw a line to such a point from
a point a{Y'\g. 86) we may set off on the line joining Fand C— the horizon, if it is that—
any convenient fraction, say a third, of that distance from Cat Fj^ in the direction of F.

PERSPECTIVE HELPS
6i
Then, joining a and
C, we
set off on
that,
from C, Ca' equal
to one third of Ca.
We
join a' F/g, and a V must be parallel to
it, for
the triangles a VC and a' F/3C must be simi-
lar triangles.
Suppose again
that we wish to construct
any figure, a square
for
instance, on
a
line
ab whose vanishing point
is
out
of
reach,
and
even
unknown, though we know
the
horizon
in which
it vanishes (Fig. 87).
We
join one end
of the
line, a, with C, and
dividing aC in
a convenient
ratio,
set
off one
part
of
it, say a
third, from C
at
a'.
Through a' we draw a parallel to ab, meeting the horizon
in
Vj ^ ; and taking this as a
vanishing point, we find its conjugate in
c^
fr
.X
rc^.87
the usual way at V'j ^, and if we are draw-
ing a square their mitre point 8/3.
These
three points will be severally one third as
far from C as the unknown
V,
F', and
8.
Joining iC, we cut off a'6' on a' F/^ and
draw a' F'/^ and ax parallel to it, which,
if
prolonged,
would pass
through
the
vanishing point F' and
is perspectively
perpendicular
to
ad.
If now we draw
a'S/3, and i' F'/^, a'8/g will be as it were
a mitre line cutting off i'd' perspectively
equal
to
a'i', and
a'li' as
it were the diagonal of a square a'b'd'e' at one
third the size
of the required one.
The
required square may now be drawn
by drawing Ce' and Cd!
sufficiently prolonged, then drawing from b and
e, thus found, ed parallel to e^d' and bd
parallel to b'd'.
These last two lines will meet in the same point d on Cd', and ad pro-
duced will meet CF in the
true
mitre point
8, making C^ equal
to three times C8/3.
For
it
is clear that we have here two systems of
siinilar
triangles, constructed on lines
radiating from
C, and that every line in the larger system will be three times as great as
the homologous
line
in
the
smaller.
It must be noted
that the small square and the
larger one will not be parts of the same perspective picture, for they are similar figures
constructed to different
scales,
the smaller being only a geometrical reduction of the
larger, auxiliary to its construction.

PERSPECTIVE OF OBLIQUE PLANES
Before considering farther the perspective relations of planes it is well to recall some
definitions and maxims
that have been
given, and
to
state some geometrical conse-
quences whose proof may be taken for granted.
The vanishing line of a plane is seen by looking
in
the direction
of the plane.
Its
perspective is the line in which a visual plane parallel to
it cuts the
picture
plane, and
is called its horizon.
The
trace
of a plane
is the
line
in which
it cuts the
picture plane
:
its trace and
horizon are always parallel.
Parallel planes have parallel traces, and the same horizon.
The trace and horizon of a vertical plane are always vertical
; those
of a horizontal
plane horizontal.
If a plane
is parallel to the Horizon Line,
its horizon and
trace are
also
parallel
to
it.
Such a plane may be
inclined, but not
oblique.
The trace and
horizon of an oblique plane are neither vertical nor horizontal.
The ground trace of a plane is its intersection with the ground plane.
As planes slope
in
all
directions, so
their horizons
incline
in
all directions.
The
horizons of all which are normal, that is perpendicular to the picture plane, pass through
the Centre, because the visual planes which
are
parallel
to them are axial planes, that
is, pass through the Axis.
The Horizon Line
is the one of these horizons by which
drawings are commonly constructed, not because
it has any geometric properties which
the others have not, but because land and sea
are
horizontal, and men, animals, and
things stand upright on them, and positions and
directions
are estimated by them.
All the constructions of perspective can be
carried on by inclined horizons
as well as
by the Horizon
Line
:
if the unaccustomed
position causes embarrassment, we need
only cheat the eye by turning the paper
till our horizon
is horizontal, and proceed in
the usual way, remembering that the trace of the plane in which we are working, which
will be parallel to its horizon, will take the place
of the ground line.
This is the only
difference to be regarded
in working
in normal
planes.
The problem of the inclined
chessboard, Fig.
12, has already given us an example.
Inclined planes which are not normal but oblique, whose horizons do not pass through
the Centre, require somewhat different construction.
Inclined planes which are
parallel
to
the Horizon
Line, sloping directly away from
the
spectator up or down, have
their horizons and
traces
parallel to that line.
The
laws of vanishing and measuring are applied as in horizontal planes, but the determina-
tion of vanishing
points and measuring points
requires
special study.
Since such a
plane does not pass through the Axis, nor its horizon through the Centre, the Axis and
Centre are not directly used in constructing in
it.
Instead of the Axis we use a visual
line which is perpendicular to
its horizon, and so measures the distance from the Station
Point to this horizon
: instead of the Centre, the point where this line meets this horizon.
The line may be called a sub-axis, and
the point a sub-centre.
In Fig. 88 is a view of

the picture plane FP, horizon plane SHH,

Point
S,
Axis
SC,
and
horizon
H'H< of an inclined visual plane H'H'EF ^
parallel to HH.
A vertical plane through
the Axis CS will be perpendicular
to the
picture
plane,
and -therefore
to HH and
H'H'.
Its
intersection SC with the
in-
clined plane will
therefore be perpendicu-
lar to H'H and will be the
sub-axis
: C
will be the sub-centre, and CO will be perpendicular to HH and H'H'.
The triangle
sec
is rightangled
at
C,
its base SC being the
Axis, and
its hypothenuse SC the
sub-axis, obviously longer than SC.
To apply this to the ordinary construction
for a
distance point (Fig. 89) let D be the distance point, and DC therefore equal to CS, the
length of the Axis.
If we draw CC perpendicular to HH and H'H, and join £>C, the
triangle CDC
will represent
the
triangle
CSC of
Fig.
88
revolved
about CC into "^
^'
the picture plane, and its hypothenuse DC
will be the
sub-axis SC revolved.
CD,
equal
to CS,
laid
off on H'H', will
give
the sub-distance points D' belonging to the
horizon H'H.
The sub-axis and sub-centre, once deter-
mined
in
this way, may be used for fixing
measuring points and coordinate vanishing
points of lines in the inclined plane, just as
is done in horizontal planes.
It will be seen
that
if two vanishing points in HH are
coordinate, the
points directly over them
in H'H' cannot
be, for, the
sub-axis being
longer than the Axis, the coordinate vanishing points corresponding
to
it must be far-
ther
apart,
as CD
in
Fig. 89
is
longer than CD ;
but the sub-distance points are
conjugate, as are the distance points (p. 31).
The position of the
Station
Point and the length of the sub-axis being determined,
the perspective chart is laid down as simply as
before.
If
in Fig. 90 V is one vanish-
ing point in H'H', to find its coordinate point
we
need
only
draw CS
perpendicular
to
H'H' and equal to CD, and passing a semi-
circumference through V and
6' in the usual
way
fix the point V.
The measuring points
follow
regularly.
Let
it be
noticed
that the
angle CDC represents the angle between the
oblique plane and the horizon plane.
It may
be called the slope angle or pitch of the plane.
If we
take
the
more
general
case
of an
oblique plane, that is, one that is neither parallel to HHnor normal, the construction is
not
quite
so simple, yet not
complicated.
The plane of the
triangle SCC (Fig. 91)
being still taken perpendicular to H'H', is now oblique
to HH: when
it
is revolved
s

64
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
round CC, CS will
fall on Co, a
line
at right angles to CC and so parallel
to H'H'.
Take CS to represent the
Axis revolved
; then CS' equal to CS
will be the sub-axis, C being the sub-
centre, and
this, measured
off
right
and
left from C on H'H', will
give
the distance points Z*' and Z>' on that
horizon.'
If Fis a vanishing point on H'H',
we may lay off CS' on CC' produced,
equal to CD', and describing a semi-
circumference
which
passes
through
V and
S', with its diameter in H'H,
make
the
perspective
chart
in
the
usual way, and
find V, and then M
and M'.
The
plane
of
the
triangle SCC,
being in
its
natural
position normal
to H'H',
will
contain both a slope
line and a
normal of the visual plane which vanishes in H'H'. SC will be the slope line, and C
the vanishing point of all slope lines. A perpendicular to SC at S, shown in its revolved
position as Sn, will be the normal, and n, in CC produced, the vanishing point
of
all
normals.
The most important conjugate vanishing points
for lines
in an
inclined plane are
those of its horizontals and its slope lines, which,
as we know, are at right angles.
The first is the
point where
its horizon meets the Horizon Line,
for all
its lines must vanish in
its own
horizon,
and its horizontals vanish also in HH, therefore
in
both, — that
is,
in
their
intersection.
The
vanishing point
of the slope lines
is found by
the method
of
p. 34, Fig. 46.
Thus in Fig. 92
F is the vanishing point of horizontals
in
the plane which vanishes
in H'H', and
F'
that of horizontals which are perpendicular to these and therefore to SF.
The vertical
V y", therefore, will find the vanishing point
of slope
lines
at
its
intersection
V" with H'H.
(See page 34.)
VSV
and KSF" are both right angles
: Kand
F' then
are conju-
gate, V and
V"
are
also
conjugate, and
V"
is
vertically
over v.
These facts are important in architectural perspective.
If
two walls
of a gabled house make
a
right
angle, as
at
Fig. 93, the angle cab
at the
eaves
is also a right angle, and the vanishing points of the horizontal and
the sloping

loci
of
all
the distance points of planes
parallel
to the Horizon Line are
the branches of an
equilateral hyperbola whose centre is C and its vertices D and D.
The same thing is true for any series
of planes parallel to an oblique horizon 00 passing through
C.

eaves are conjugate, that of ac being vertically over that of ad.
This
is the condition
we had in Figs. 56 and 57, the vanishing points in each slope of the
roof being conju-
gate in both those problems.
Their measuring points may then be found by the usual
process, and lines in either direction in either slope be measured and divided like other
lines.
The geometrical
relations
of these
several vanishing points and measuring points
are
often
useful.
They are
represented
as before
in
Fig.
94, M and M' being the
measuring points
of Fand V in the Hori-
zon Plane, and M° and M" of Fand V" in
the oblique
plane.
V is common
to both
series of points, and its two measuring points
jlf and M° are equally distant from
it, as all
its measuring points
must
be.
It
will be
found
also
that
the
other two
measuring
points
are equally distant from
F", so that
V"M'i= yi'M'.
The angle V'M'V",
it
will be
seen,
is
equal
to the
pitch
of
the
oblique
plane,
as CDC
was
that
of
the
plane in
Fig. 90.
The practical construction
is then exceed-
ingly simple.
Given F and
F', the vanish-
ing points of the horizontals of the given plane and
of the horizontal projection
of
its
slope
lines,
and the
pitch of the
plane — say the
vanishing
points
of
the
courses
in
the
walls
of a
building and the pitch of
its roof— and we may lay
out a chart thus
:
(Fig. 95).
The slope angle laid off
at M' gives F" on the
vertical from V (page
34,
Fig. 46).
The arc M'M" from the centre F" gives
M", the arc MAP from the centre F gives M°, and
this is
all.

Note.
That this con.struction is true may be proved by comparing the perspective diagram,
Fig.
96, with
Fig.
94.
For,
first,
the plane
of
the
triangle CCS has been
taken perpendicu-
lar to
VV", so that SC and SC, which
are
equal,
are also
perpendicular
to VV" .
Then
the
triangle
VS' V"
is
equal
to VSV"
:
it
is
that triangle revolved up info the
picture plane
:
so VS- VS', and V"S= V"S'.
Second, by con-
struction VM°= VS', and VM= VS, so that
all
four of these are equal, and VM°= VM.
Also,
if we join F" and M', since M' is a measuring
point of lines that vanish in V" (cf. Rule, p.
34),
VM' and V"M" must be equaL

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
No convenient relation appears between the
mitre points
8 and
8' (Fig. 97), so
that
if
8'
is
needed, S' must be found
first
; but this is very
simply
done.
The middle
point
0'
of
FF»",
centre of the semicircumference V'S' V", is ver-
tically over 0, the middle point of W.
An arc
described from 0' as a centre with a radius 0' V
will by its intersection with the arc SMM° de-
termine
S', from which
the
line
S'h'
is to be
drawn, making an angle of 45° with S'V.
The
use of this process will sometimes save trouble,
and
if the pitch of VV" is
high, a good deal of
space.



CIRCLES IN OBLIQUE PLANES
Fig. 98 shows the construction in an oblique plane whose horizon is H'lf', C being
the
sub-centre.
Z> is
a distance
point, and CD = CS the length of the Axis
: the tri-
angle CCS, right-angled
at C, gives the
sub-distance
points D', and
the diagonal ab
of the square, vanishing in D', measures the length of the vanishing side.
The rest of
the construction is as in Fig. 59.
To INSCRIBE A CIRCLE IN A GIVEN SQUARE.
If One
side
of the square
is
a front
line, the problem
is already solved.
But we may have a square which is already fixed,
and oblique
to the picture plane.
In Fig. 99 let
VV'' be the horizon of any plane, V
and V conjugate vanishing points of the sides of the given square abed in
it, and 8 the
mitre point.
Two sides
of the diagonal square and the diagonals of the given square
must vanish in
S.
Draw any convenient front line af, and produce two opposite sides
ad and be of abed till they meet
it.
On the included portion ag describe a semicircum-
ference, and draw the tangents at 45°, meeting a/" iny" and h.
Join these points and the
centre
e
to V, and draw through
the centre o of abed" the diameter
that vanishes in
V, prolonging
it
till
it meets
V'/z.x\d V'h in/ and
s.
Now/>4 and ps are two
lines
which
in space are crossed by a series of parallels, the lines that vanish in V, and so
are divided proportionally in perspective by these parallels.
Hence Ve passes through
0, the perspective centre oi ps, and oq : op =.eg : ef.
But ^is equal to the half diagonal
of a square whose half side
is eg ;
therefore, since oq is half the side of abed, op is equal
to its half diagonal ob, and/ is one angle of the coordinate square, as in Fig. 98, and s
is the opposite angle.
/8 then finds m on eV, and sh finds n, and sm and pn complete
the square
as before, and the
circle may be
inscribed
as usual.
The Xva^fh has for
convenience been passed through a, but the auxiliary semicircumference may be drawn
anywhere across the lines that vanish in V, on the front \\\\&f'h' for instance, yet this
position reduces its size so much that there is danger of inaccuracy in finding the inter-
sections.
If
it happens that one vanishing point V oi the given square
is out of reach, the
diameter /J cannot be drawn to
it.
In that case the 45°
points may be projected on
fh2Xk and
/, and
transferred by kV and IV to the diagonals
ac and bd 2X
/, 2, j,
and 4.
Then the sides /« and sn may be drawn through i and j, and the second square
be completed
as
before.
This case would have occurred
if mpns had been the given
square, V and S being interchanged.
It may happen that neither F' nor 8 is in reach, as in Fig. 100, so that we can draw
neither the diameter /.f nor the diagonals
to
their vanishing
point.
Then, having de-
scribed our semicircumference with
its tangents on af, by projecting the 45° points on
the diagonals ae and bd we get four points of the circle — i, 2, j, and 4.
We produce
these diagonals
till
they meet Vf and Vh in m, n, q, and r, joining m to n and q to r,
which gives the points e and g.
Last, drawing ei and g2, produced
till they meet in /,

68
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
and e4 and gj meeting in
s, we complete the second square,
giving the
tangents
at
I, 2, J, and 4.
The diagonal ps fixes the points of contact of the sides ad and be.
The
construction,
it will be seen, requires great nicety.
But
if only the vanishing point of a diagonal is given, as in Fig. loi, abed being the
given
square, we may draw any front
line_/%, here drawn through
a, and
project the
corners
of the square upon
it by lines from
8.- aS must as before bisect//;.
Upon_/%
as a hypothenuse we erect an isosceles right triangle, inscribing in
it a semicircle whose
centre will be a, and project the tangent points by perpendiculars on//;.
From
the
points k and
/, thus found, and from the extremities of the semicircumference, we draw
lines to
8.
The lines ^8 and //S will cut the sides of the square in the four points i, 2,
J, and 4, where they are tangent
to the
circle.
The
lines i-j and 2-4 joining these
points will be diagonals of the second square and will find its corners, /, g,
s, and
e, on
the lines that join 8 with the extremities of
the semicircumference.
Connecting these
corners completes the second square
:
its points
of tangency are found by drawing ac
and bd.
In
all these cases the position of the plane of the
circle makes no
difference
in
the
construction
: VV or HJI may be the Horizon
Line, or the horizon
of any oblique
plane.
To CONSTRUCT A PERSPECTIVE CIRCLE ON A GIVEN DIAMETER
IN A GIVEN PLANE.
If
the given diameter
is a front line ab, and the plane is normal, the problem
is already
solved in
Fig. 61.
If the plane
of the
circle
is
oblique,
its own sub-centre and
sub-
distance point must be substituted for C and D.
When the given diameter ab is an oblique line (Fig. 102), the centre cannot be found
by bisecting
it.
Through one extremity a draw a front line of measures, and upon this
project b at n from the measuring point M. Mm drawn to the middle
of an will
find
the centre 0.
Draw a front line through
on which the lines aM and «.^ will intercept
the front diameter qop.
Through
draw also the Perpendicular oC, and through q and
p Perpendiculars Cq, and Cp, producing them.
Diagonals from / and q to the proper
distance point will fix the extremities of the Perpendicular diameter de, and front lines
through these extremities will give the perspective square ^,4^ in which the circle may
be inscribed, six points being already determined.
The construction
is justified by proving that aJ/and «jI/ intercept the diameter qop.
In the
plan. Fig. 103, the
triangle SVM is
isosceles (compare
Fig. 26) and m
is the
middle of an.
The measuring lines aq, mo, and nb are
parallel
; ab
is
parallel
X.o SV,
and qp to VM.
Then the triangles aoq and bop are isosceles and equal ; oa, oq, ob, and
op are all radii of the same circle, and ab and qp are its diameters.
This problem applies when a round tower has to be added to a building or an apse
to a church.
Concentric circles do not in perspective make parallel ellipses or concentric ellipses,
or even similar ellipses, nor have they parallel axes except
in special cases.
The axes
look parallel, and are convergent in perspective.
The curves
offer, then, none of the
helps which we look for in concentric
figures, but each has to be constructed
point by
point.
When the first circle has been put
into perspective with
its enclosing square,
it is easy,
if we know the diameter of a concentric circle, to describe a corresponding



CIRCLES IN OBLIQUE PLANES
69
square within the first or outside
it on the same diagonals and cardinal diameters, and
to draw the second curve
through the corresponding
intersections (Fig.
104).
The
method of the double square
is convenient here as before.
The corresponding points
are found, evidently on the same diameters
of the
circles, for
instance, i and / on oa,
2 and 2 on ob, and so on.
Thus the figures on a clock dial or the joints of a round arch
converge to the original centre of the circles, that
is the centre of the enclosing squares.
This suggests a more general way of drawing a second circle concentric with one that
is already constructed.
We see in
Fig. 105 that
if we have two pairs of corresponding
points^, ^' and/,/' in two
concentric circumferences, the chords which connect
the
points/ and q,p' and q\ will be parallel, and in perspective will have the same vanish-
ing point.
If
in
Fig. io6 we have the circle mpqn constructed about the centre 0, and
know the extremity/' of any radius
of the second
circle, we may connect the
corre-
sponding point /
of the
first
circle with any other point q of
it.
Then drawing the
chord pq, and producing
it
to
its vanishing
point
»/'
in
the horizon
of the
circle's
plane, draw a chord from p^ of the second circle to the same vanishing point
:
this will
intersect the radius oq in q\ which will be
the point that corresponds
to
q.
Having
found q\ we may draw any secant qr to
its vanishing point
«', and connecting^' with
that vanishing point find the point r' on
r, and so on indefinitely.

SPECIAL POINTS AND TANGENTS
It is easy to put special points on the circumference of a
circle into perspective by
the following process.
Let 1-2-J-4 (Fig. 107) be the square in which a circle is to be
inscribed, C being the Centre, or the proper sub-centre, and 1-2 and j-4 being front
lines.
If
is the centre of the circle, ae will be the front diameter, and oC will contain
the perpendicular diameter.
On ae as a diameter describe the semicircumference ampe,
of which
will be the centre
:
it will represent
half the required circle revolved about
ae till
it is parallel to the picture
plane.
Let m be any point in which
it is to be found
in perspective.
Draw the half chord mb perpendicular to ae.
Now any chord at right
angles to ae will when revolved into the plan of the perspective circle become a Perpen-
dicular vanishing in C, and the chord vib will
fall on bC.
It may be measured off on
bC by laying off bj equal to bm and drawing a measuring line to the distance point D :
by laying off the length both ways from d and measuring, both extremities of the chord
m'm' may be found.
This process may be used to divide a circumference into any required parts.
Sup-
pose, for
instance, that we have
to divide
it
into twelve equal parts.
We
divide the
quadrant anms
into thirds, at m and n, and dropping perpendiculars on ae at b and
c,
repeat the construction as before.
This may serve for an arch, a clock, or an architec-
tural decoration.
The chord m'm' once determined, the corresponding one on the other
side of oC may be found by setting off od equal
to ob, and drawing the perpendicular
chord bC and the front line m'm".
It is worth noting that
if
the quadrant as (Fig. 107) is divided
into equal
parts, any
two symmetrical points n and m, which are
at equal
distances from a and
s, being
joined by a chord, that chord will be
at an
angle
of 45° with ae and os.
When the
semicircle is revolved into the plane
of the. circle, and so falls on oC, becoming a Per-
pendicular, the chord, being still at an angle of 45° with
it, becomes a Diagonal vanish-
ing m D— the very Diagonal
that measures
the position
of both
n' and
m'.
If we
prolong mn
till
it meets
ae, the
axis
of
rotation,
in
r, the chord when revolved
will
continue to pass through
r.
It may then be drawn through r at once, serving for
the
measuring line of m' and «', and
it will be found that the distance rb is equal to bm and
re to en, as they should be.
The draughtsman soon
discovers that the direction of a curve at any point greatly
influences the curvature on both
sides
of
it.
There
is great advantage, therefore, in
defining the curvature of the perspective circle by tangents.
The tangents
at the 45°
points have been already provided by the enclosing squares.
Fig. 107 shows
that the
last method provides a tangent at any point.
We draw the tangent at a point/ of the
semicircle, at right angles to the radius op, and produce
it
till
it meets the axis ae in
/.
When the
semicircle
is revolved
as
before, the point
/, being in the axis of rotation,
remains fixed
; the tangent may therefore be drawn from /' to
t.



DIAMETERS AND AXES
The ellipses into which circles are projected in perspective being symmetrical curves,
some advantage may be taken
of
this
quality in drawing them.
It
is convenient to
know the axes, the longest and shortest diameter, which are
at
right
angles
;
it takes,
however, some trouble to determine them— we shall see how later.
But every diameter
has its conjugate diameter, and each of the pair bisects all chords which are parallel to
the other, as we know by geometry.
Now in Fig. io8, cd, being a Perpendicular, repre-
sents a diameter
of the
circle which
is
at
right angles
to the front diameter ab.
It
therefore bisects the chord ab of the ellipse, and all chords parallel to it, for these chords,
being front lines, are divided by
it in
perspective
in
their
true
proportion.
It is then
a diameter of the ellipse, and
its conjugate
is
that one
of these chords which passes
through the centre of
the
ellipse.
This
centre,
o', is found by bisecting cd geometri-
cally, and a front chord
.?/ drawn through
it will be the conjugate diameter, and will in
its turn bisect
all chords that are geometrically parallel to cd.
Any point m already
found will then determine
its conjugate point n,
if we draw through m a line parallel to
cd, and lay off on
it pn equal lo pm.
Thus every point found by the previous construc-
tions
will
give a new
point (not the corresponding point
m'), and
the symmetrical
character of the parallel chords will assist the eye in drawing the curve.
The determi-
nation of the ends of the diameter ^ will be best shown in another problem (Fig. no).
Here again there
is convenience in taking two sides of the enclosing square parallel
to the picture plane, for
that provides
a pair of conjugate diameters, one
parallel
to
these sides, and the other a Perpendicular.
Moreover, since
all
the
front chords are
bisected by cd, any point m, found on one side of
it, will give a corresponding point «'
on the other side by simply repeating the distance from cd on a front chord.
Conjugate diameters help considerably in defining the curve of the circle
in
per-
spective
: when
still greater precision is needed
it is well to find the axes.
This is not
a complicated process when we have once determined, as we have
just done, a pair of
conjugate diameters.
Let cydx (Fig. 109) be the perspective ellipse, and xy and cd the conjugate diameters,
ab being the tangent at one extremity
<r of the longer diameter, and parallel to xy.
Dis-
regarding for the moment the question of perspective, let us consider the ellipse as the
section of a circular cylinder whose axis is oblique to the plane of the paper, and imagine
a right section of the cylinder, made by a plane passing through ab.
By an ingenious
device called the Method of Shadows the ellipse
is conceived of as the solar shadow of
this circular section, the rays of
light being parallel
to the
axis of the cylinder.
The
centre 0' will be the shadow of the centre
of the circle, and the shadow of any diameter
of the circle will be a diameter of the ellipse.
That diameter of the circle which is parallel
to ab must be parallel to the plane of the ellipse, and therefore parallel and equal to its
shadow on that plane.
This shadow must be xy, the only diameter which is parallel to
ab.
The circle, revolved into the picture plane about ab, will be the circle here drawn.

72
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
with radius co equal to half xy and perpendicular to ab, o being the revolved position of
its centre.
Diameters of the circle, prolonged, must
intersect ab, and must meet their
shadows
at the point
of intersection
: then
if we draw any diameter ob, we can draw
its shadow cfb.
Parallel
lines
give
parallel shadows
;
therefore any pair of diameters
in the circle which
are
at
right angles give conjugate shadows, for the tangents at the
extremities of each
are
parallel to
the other, and
this will be
true of their shadows.
Now the only pair
of conjugate diameters
in the
ellipse which are at right angles are
its axes.
Hence the problem reduces
itself
to finding
the
two diameters of the circle
at right angles whose shadows shall also be at right angles, that
is, to find two pairs of
radial lines — oa, ob, and o'a, o'b — meeting on ab, and each pair at right angles.
These
right angles may be inscribed in the halves of a circle whose diameter is ab, and which
passes through o and o'.
Then oo' is a chord of this circle, and the centre must be found
on a perpendicular at the middle of oo' .
It must also be found on ab, and must be the
intersection
k.
The
circle described from k and passing through
o and
o' fixes the
points a and b, as yet undetermined
;
o'a and o'b if produced will then contain the axes.
To determine their extremities we have only to find the shadows of the
extremities of
the corresponding diameters of the circle, by drawing mp and nq parallel to
oo', which
represents the direction
of the
rays
of
light.
When / and q are found, p' and q' are
measured off accordingly, or are found by extending ao and no into diameters and cast-
ing the shadows of their farther extremities
;
the two methods will verify each other.

SPECIAL TANGENTS
Points where the tangents are of special interest are the ends of horizontal circles,
where the tangents become vertical in perspective, as
at
the base or top of an upright
cylinder, a tower for instance
; or the upper and lower points in a vertical circle, such
as an arch or a clock, where the perspective tangent is geometrically horizontal.
These
last points are not the crowns of the arches or circles, — for the tangent at the crown of
an arch vanishes in the horizon, — but the points where the arches
are highest in the
picture.
Fig. no shows a method of getting the vertical tangents of a horizontal circle, taken
above the Horizon Line.
The plan of the circle is set over the perspective for the con-
struction's sake, against the
front
line PP, which
in
the
plan stands
for the picture
plane, the position of the Station Point 5 being marked on the vertical T'Cat the proper
distance from PP.
Imagine the circle to be the section of a vertical cylinder, and two
vertical visual planes drawn tangent to the cylinder, therefore tangent to the circle, and
meeting in a vertical line that passes through S.
These planes will be projected in the
plan into the lines Sc and Sd, tangent to the circle at c and d, and will cut
the
picture
plane
in vertical lines at c' and d', which will be the required
tangents.
To draw the
tangents in plan, and find the points c and d, describe an arc from the middle point of
So, passing through
o, and
cutting the circumference of the circle in two points which
will be the required c and d.
For
if we join Sd and od, the angle Sdo is really inscribed
in a semicircle whose diameter is So.
It
is then
a
right angle, and Sd, being perpen-
dicular to a radius at
its
extremity,
is the tangent at d ; and so with
c.
It remains
to
put the circle in perspective, and find its tangent points.
The diameter^//
is projected
in ab, which is our
line
of measures, the enclosing square and the determining points
for the curve being found as usual.
The vertical lines from
c' and d', as has been said,
are the vertical
tangents.
We have then to find the
points
of contact by drawing the
chord den.
This may be done by projecting both the
points on PP, as c at k, meas-
uring
off
the
distance
ck on
the
Perpendicular kC, by the distance point D ; or by
finding one of them,
c, and producing the chord cd in the plan to
its trace n, and draw-
ing en through to d in the picture.
The point d is apt to come so near h in the per-
spective as to make
its independent determination troublesome
;
the use
of
ti
is often
more convenient and more precise.
The chord cd looks
like the transverse
axis of the
ellipse
:
it is in fact that of the
visual ellipse, that
is, of the ellipse as
it appears to the eye, and as
it would be on paper
if the picture plane were parallel to ed, so that ed was a front line, in which case o would
be vertically over C, and cd parallel to HH.
It is not the axis, for the tangents at the
extremities of an axis must be perpendicular to
it, and here they are oblique
: but these
tangents are parallel, and therefore cd is a diameter.
The centre (?' of the ellipse is the
intersection of cd with st, for st also is a diameter, as in Fig. io8.
Its eccentric position
in the
circle may be seen
in the plan
at the
intersection of the corresponding lines,

74
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
where
it
is not even
in the middle
of
cd.
The diameter conjugate to cd must pass
through o' and be parallel to the tangents, that
is, vertical
:
it must therefore be the line
xy.
Now if we pass a vertical visual plane through o\
its trace on
the
picture plane
must be this vertical diameter xy, and the chord of the circle to which this corresponds
will be the chord xy in the plan
; and
if we wish
to
find the extremities of xy we may
do
it by determining x and y as we determined c and d.
We may draw the perpendicu-
lar _)'_)'', and putting it into perspective measure
its length by the distance point.
The
point X here comes, and is likely to come, so near
the
line ab that there is no room to
measure, and we may trust to the course of the curve to find
it.
The highest point in perspective of a circle or arch
is evidently that where the per-
spective curve is horizontal, and
is determined in the same way.
To see the application
of this last construction to that case we have only to turn Fig. no round 90°, when PP
will become vertical and CP the Horizon Line.
The trace of the tangent plane is then
cS, and c is the tangent point of the horizontal tangent cj.
In this case the circle is assumed to be normal, and
is a right section of the assumed
cylinder, whose axis
is taken parallel to the picture plane.
But
if the plane of the circle
is not normal, though
still vertical,
it no longer gives a
right section of the cylinder,
which being still parallel to the
picture plane becomes elliptical.
The tangent to the
circle still lies in the same tangent visual plane, and pierces the horizontal plane not in
the same point S, but in another in the trace of the visual
plane, which
is a horizontal
line passing through S and
parallel
to
ac.
Fig. in shows
these conditions in plan.
The plane of the circle appears in plan as the line ebS", eb being the diameter, and SS"
is the horizontal trace of the tangent plane.
The tangent to the circle then pierces the
horizontal plane in S".
The semicircle and tangent are shown
revolved into the hori-
zontal plane,
being the Centre, eb the diameter, and
c the tangent point revolved.
S"c
is then the revolved position of the tangent, and
transferring the distance oS" to
the picture
at the proper scale, instead of oS, we proceed as before.
Turning the circle
away from the normal position, and lengthening inconsequence the subtangent <73' raises
the tangent point higher on the shoulder of the circle.



TRI-CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS
As most plane
figures which
are put
into perspective are based on the right angle
and constructed by conjugate vanishing points, so most solid objects also are based on
rectangular forms, and constructed on three sets of lines
at
right angles to each other,
like the axes of a cube.
So long as such objects stand on a horizontal plane, their plans
are composed of lines which vanish in the Horizon Line, and the other lines are vertical
lines which have no vanishing point
:
therefore
they are constructed by one set of con-
jugate vanishing points
in the Horizon
Line.
Even when
such an object is tilted,
if
one edge
is parallel to the
picture plane, we have still but two vanishing points, which
are conjugate, and their horizon passes through the Centre, while the lines of the third
system are front lines.
Then the picture is constructed exactly as
if this horizon were
the Horizon Line, and by turning the paper through
the proper angle the construction
may be brought to the customary aspect.
The box on the sloping platform in Fig. 112
is constructed by the conjugate vanishing
points V and V and
their measuring points
on
the
vertical horizon VCV, in a way that will be
easily understood by inspection.
In
this case the planes of the top and bottom of the box vanish
in
the
sub-horizon
H'H' : and so do the retiring lines
in them, which vanish
in
V, and
the
lines
of the
lozenge on the cover, which vanish in Z*', the sub-distance
point.
The other lines
in
these planes are front lines, and do not vanish
:
the upright edges vanish
in V, in VC
produced below, that point being the conjugate of
V.
The dimensions of the box, set
out below
it, are measured off in the usual way.
If the figure is turned 90° the vertical
horizon VCV takes the position of the Horizon Line, and the box is seen to be drawn
like an ordinary parallelopiped standing upright.
When the Rectangular object is so placed that none of its edges is vertical, and none
parallel to the picture, so that all are vanishing lines, we have three systems of parallel
lines, vanishing in three points which, taken two by two, are conjugate. We may call these
points tri-conjugate vanishing
points.
The three series of lines, moreover, lie in three
planes or series of parallel planes which
are
all
oblique and inclined, so that the van-
ishing points lie two by two, in three
inclined
horizons, as we see by the same box
in
Fig. 113, where no side is parallel to horizon plane or picture plane.
Here the parallel
lines ab, ile,fg, vanish in V; the other system of parallels ac, d/, eg, in its conjugate V.
The planes of the top and bottom of the box, which contain
these
lines, vanish in the
horizon W, which joins
these vanishing
points.
The
parallels da and y? vanish in V" ; the plane of the right
side, which contains these
lines and ac and d/, vanishes
in the horizon V V", and so on.
Let
V, V, and
V" be
three
tri-conjugate vanishing
points making the three vertices
of a triangle (Fig.
114).
If C
is the Centre, the sub-centres on the
three horizons
will be found by dropping perpendiculars from C on VV,
?i^ //«

76
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
V V", and
VV".
Now the
three
visual planes which vanish in these
horizons, and
the
three visual lines which vanish in the three vanishing
points, meet
in S, and form
a solid angle, whose edges are the visual
lines SV, SV, and SV".
But these visual
lines and
planes, being
parallel
to the
sides and edges
of
a rectangular
object, are
themselves at right angles, and the solid angle at ^ is
therefore made up of three right
angles
(Fig.
115).
Therefore by the theory of projections, FC", which
is the ortho-
graphic projection
of ^F on
the
picture
plane,
will be
perpendicular
to V V",
the
horizon
of
the plane SV V", that
is, VC prolonged will coin-
cide with CC",— or the perpendicular CC" pro-
duced will pass through
F.
In
other words, the
line which
joins any one
of
three
tri-conjugate
vanishing points with the centre
is perpendicular
to
the horizon which contains the other two, and
passes through its sub-centre.
-?J>. //JT
Note.
That VC is perpendicular to VV" may be proved geometrically thus: SC, being
the Axis, is normal to the plane W V", which is the picture plane.
Join VC, Fig. 115, produce
it
till
it meets V V" in
jr, and draw Sx.
The plane VSx, containing the Axis SC, must be
normal to the
picture plane.
It is also perpendicular to the plane V'SV", because
it contains
SV, which
is perpendicular
to that plane.
It
is therefore perpendicular
to the
intersection
F'F", and any line Vx \n
it must
also be perpendicular to VV".
But CC"', connecting the
Centre with the sib-centre C"' for the horizon V V", is also perpendicular to VV" j therefore
the two perpendiculars must coincide, and x must be C".
It follows that the Centre is always the point where the three altitudes of the triangle
VV'V" meet, and therefore that for any system of tri-conjugate vanishing points there
is but one
possible
position for the Centre.
Consequently, when the Station Point is
fixed, and therefore the
Centre,
if two
of the
tri-conjugate points
are fixed the
third
follows of course.
It will be seen presently that even
if the horizon which contains the
two points is determined, the third point follows of course, which
is only saying that
if
a rectangular solid
is
set on
a
fixed
inclined plane the
direction of the lines that are perpendicular to that plane
is
also
fixed, or
finally, as we
already know, that when
the horizon of a plane
is known the vanishing point of its
normal lines maybe determined.
The solid angle .Swith
the
three vanishing
points and
the
intercepted
planes
may be regarded
as
the corner
sliced off by the picture
plane from a great parallelopiped whose edges are parallel
to those of the
object, — of
the box
in
Fig.
113, for
in-
stance.
It follows also that the Centre must always be
inside the triangle W'V",
which means that the triangle must be acute-angled (Fig.
116).
In Fig. 117, we have
all three
of the
triangles
that make up the
solid angle
5' re-
volved
into the picture plane, S', S", and S'" being the several positions into which S
would be carried with them.
VS' and VS" represent the same edge of the solid angle,
and are
therefore equal, and so for the same reason are V'S' and VS'", V"S" and

TRI-CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS
77
J*'^. /^
V"S"'.
The measuring points are
set
oil in the
usual way.
VS' and VS", for instance, give the
measuring points M and M in the horizons FV
and
yV", which
are,
as
they should
be,
at the
same distance from
V,
all
the measuring
points
for K being, as we know, in a circumference about
it, and so with
the others.
Lines
that vanish
in
V,
then, may be measured
either
in
the
planes
that vanish
in
the
horizon
FF', or
in
those
that
vanish in VV", as the conditions of the problem
may
require,
using
the
appropriate
measuring
points,
and
lines
of
measures
parallel
to
the
appropriate horizons.
But inasmuch as each
pair of measuring points
is given by either sf two positions
of the revolved
Station
Point — J/ and
M, for instance, by an arc from S' or S"
— it
will
be
found,
as appears
in
Fig.
1 18, that only two of these revolved Sta-
tion Points are needed to fix all six meas-
uring points.
Thus an
arc struck from
V with radius VS' gives M and M; one
from V with radius VS' gives M' and
M' ;ons from F"with radius V"S" gives
M" and M".
Here, the semicircumfer-
ence VS'V
being
described,
VS',
drawn
through
C,
or
perpendicular
to
VV, determines S'.
If we describe
the arc S'MMS" from Fwith
a radius
VS',
its
intersection with the perpendicular from V to VV"
will determine S", and the other
measuring points will follow.
It is a simple matter, when the centre and two conjugate vanishing points
are
fixed,
to determine the tri-conjugate point.
In Fig. 119
if we
make VV
the diameter
of a
semicircle
enclo^irrg
C,
we may draw
the chords VCC" and VCC" through
C and they will intersect the semicircumference
in
the
sub-centres C" and C".
Then
the
lines VC" and
V'C" must
intersect
in
the
tri-conjugate
point
V".
For we know that these last two
lines are perpendicu-
lar to the
altitudes VC" and VC", and the
angles
VC" V and VC" V, being right angles, must inscribe
in a semicircle of which VV is
the diameter.
It will be seen that vanishing point V" is independent of changes
of position
of V
and V so long as these are conjugate -and remain on
the same horizon H'H'.
This
will appear experimentally if we use other pairs of points on H'H', taking care that
they are
really conjugate, with the same Centre and
Axis,
for the construction
will
always give the same point V".
This
is what we should
expect, for V" is only the

78
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
~y—H
vanishing point
of
lines which
are normal to in-
clined planes whose horizon
is H'H'
(of. p. 64);
any line which is normal
to
a given plane will be
rectangularly coordinate
with
any two
lines
in
that plane which
pass
through
its foot and
are
at right
angles, that
is, have conjugate vanishing
points.
Fig.
120 shows how the process
of
p. 64
for
finding
the
vanishing
point
of
normals
to
the
planes
that vanish
in H'H'
will determine F".
H'H' being the horizon which contains V and
V, and V"C being perpendicular to
it, C
is only
the sub-centre on that horizon.
If we revolve the triangle SCC into the picture plane
as
in
Fig. 91, SC
will represent the
sub-axis, and the
right angle C '5 F", inscribed
in the semicircle, will determine the required vanishing point V".
Fig. 121 shows how
this construction
will combine with that of
Fig.
1 19, and may prove experimentally that
both processes give the same
result.
This
method
is
useful
in problems of
reflection
and some others where the normal to a plane
is required.
The relations
of symmetry that
exist be-
tween
tri-conjugate
vanishing
points
and
their measuring
points do
not
appear be-
tween the mitre points, and these are
to be
found
singly by the ordinary process when
they are needed.
Let us revert now to Fig. 113.
Fis the only vanishing point on the sheet, and V"
is
naccessible.
The planes of the top and bottom
of the box vanish
in H'H', which
is the horizon of
the platform, and
is taken parallel to the Horizon Line.
The upright
edges are then normal to planes that vanish in H'H'.
The vanishing point of normals
is indicated as shown on page
64, by laying
off the length
of the sub-axis from C to
S on HH, and drawing a perpendicular
to OS, which would meet the prime vertical
C'C in the vanishing point
of normals, that
is, in
V".
But since this point
is inacces
sible, a point Sj ^
is taken at a third
the distance from C to
^S", and a line drawn from
it parallel to ^F" finds F"/,, its substitute.
The upright edges are drawn towards the
inaccessible V" by the process that was used in Fig. 50, and will be used again in the
problem next to follow, Fig. 122.

MONUMENT WITH TRI-CONJUGATE VANISHING POINTS
In Fig. 122 a sarcophagus is set on a terrace at the head of a flight of steps
: the lid
is tilted up against the terrace wall, none of its lines being vertical, but all oblique boih
to the picture and to the horizon plane.
Here the conjugate points Fand
F', the van-
ishing
points
of the sides of the bed of the stone, are assumed
; and the Centre being
at C, the
positions of the other points
are worked out by the chart at half scale.
F,
though off the paper,
is within reach
; F" comes out of reach, and F"/^ at one half the
distance,
is substituted for
it on
the horizon F'F", and the triangle F'F/^F"!^ fur-
nishes the chart.
A figured plan and section are given at the scale of the chart.
The perpendicular CC gives the sub-centre C on FF' ;
half of
it
set off from F'
gives C'l ^, and on
a perpendicular
at C'j^ half CC gives C/^, representing C on the
chart.
A
semicircumference being described on
F'Fj^, and F'B and
Fj^E being
drawn through C/^, the chords Fl^B and F'E produced will with C'j ^Cj ^
all meet in
F"I ^, completing the conjugate triangle of the chart.
The measuring pointsM and M"
are found from
the chart
: M' being off the
sheet,
it is more convenient to use M'l ^.
The Ground Line being drawn at the proper height, and the Centre projected on
it at
c,
the near cornt-r A of the lid is found from the plan. AF and A F' will contain the sides
Ab and ae of the bed of the stone.
The line of measures b'Ae' is drawn parallel to the
horizon FF' : Ae', taken at the scale of the plan, gives by M'l ^ the corner e, and Ab'
at double the scale gives by J/ the corner b.
These two fix the bed Abde of the stone.
The upright edges vanish
in
F".
This being out of reach, we do as in
Fig. 50, — for
the edge
at A, for instance, we take
the middle point/' of AF', and joining
it with
f'/jj draw ^parallel to/'f"/^.
For the edge at b we take h', the middle
point of
bF', and so on.
The line of measures for these uprights is Am, parallel to the horizon
F'F", and the measuring point
is M".
The
rest
of the construction
follows
natu-
rally.
It remains to put
in the terrace and
steps, and the body of the monument, which
awaits its lid.
The stone leans against the wall,
its upper edge in contact, and so tilted
that no line in
it is horizontal.
Since the edge de lies in the plane of the
face
of the
wall,
its ground projection lies in kt, the base line of the wall.
The plane of the wall,
then, vanishes
in
a vertical
horizon passing through
F, and
its
horizontals vanish
in
F^, on the Horizon Line vertically under
F.
The arrises of the steps and the horizon-
tals on the long sides of the sarcophagus
also vanish
in
F^.
The
horizontals of the
buttress-walls and of the ends of the sarcophagus vanish in
^'o, conjugate to F^, which
is found by drawing C'.S vertical and equal to the Axis (given by the chart) and draw-
ing SF^, and SF"^ at right angles to
it.
The base line kl of the
buttress-wall of the
steps
pierces the
picture plane in the Ground Line at
I, which
is found from the plan,
and at which we set up a scale of heights.
The measuring points M^ andM"^ enable
us to lay off the dimensions in the ground plane, and to draw there the plan qp^r of the
sarcophagus, which is projected up to its proper level.
The pitch of the steps, laid off
at M"g, gives F'" for the vanishing point of the slope lines of the steps and buttresses.

HEXAGONS AND RECIPROCAL VANISHING POINTS
T



HEXAGONS AND RECIPROCAL VANISHING POINTS
8i
draw a line through the vertex of the adjoining triangle at g which will cut off the side
^^of the first hexagon on the Perpendicular bC, and a front line through ^cuts off all
the corresponding sides
of the
first row
of hexagons.
A few diagonals
like art^give
intersections enough to find all the angles that correspond to d, and the vertices of the
triangles,/;^, etc.
are the other angles required.
It
will be noticed that the sides of
the hexagon are every third section in a series of oblique lines.
If,
finally, the hexagons are oblique to the Horizon Line, reciprocal vanishing points
are of no use, and the problem
is solved without them.
The vanishing
points of the
three series of sides are not commonly all accessible
at once, but having two of them,
we may substitute for the third that of the perpendiculars
to one side whose vanishing
point is known, as in Fig. 126.
Here the most
available series of lines are ab and
its
parallels, vanishing in V; ad and its parallels, vanishing in the conjugate point V ; and
o/'and its parallels, vanishing in
V".
The three vanishing points are determined from
the plan, or V, being conjugate to
V, may be fixed by a chart.
Four sides and
all the
angles of each hexagon lie in the first and third
series.
The
right intersections being
picked out, the other sides may be drawn, and will be
alternating sections of a fourth
series of parallels, whose vanishing point is perhaps
inaccessible,- and is not necessary.

OCTAGONAL PAVEMENTS
The use of diagonal squares
is illustrated in the perspective of pavements which are
based on octagons.
If
the octagons
lie with
sides
parallel to the picture plane, as in
Fig. 127, they are in
tlie position of the octagon formed by the overlapping squares in
Fig.
15.
The point A being chosen on the front line AB, the point c and the repeated
points /,
2, J, are set off from the plan, and Perpendiculars drawn to C.
The Diagonal
f£> gives the centre of the first square
; a front line dd will give the points of contact of
the front rank of squares
; and by the help of Diagonals to both distance
points, or of
one set of Diagonals and of Perpendiculars,
all the points of contact can be found and
all the squares drawn in.
If no sides of the octagons are parallel to the picture plane, we have two pairs of con-
jugate vanishing points, — one set of co-
^'
"^f
^"^
ordinate lines making angles of 45° with
the other
set.
It
will
scarcely happen
that all four vanishing points are within
reach, but
if one pair
is determined by
the ordinary perspective chart, as in Fig.
128, the mitre point of this pair will be
one of the other pair, and the pavement
may be constructed without
the fourth
point.
Here the pavement is laid out as a series of larger squares with smaller squares
interpolated, cutting off their corners, and turning them into octagons.
We choose for
leading lines those that vanish in
F, and those in
8, and add those which vanish in
F'
conjugate to
F.
Starting from A, according
to
the
plan, we set off the points /, j, 5,
etc.
Lines drawn from these points to 8 contain two
sides each of a series of squares
parallel to that of which Al> is one side.
Next, lines to ^from the intermediate points
2, 4, d, etc. will contain diagonals of these squares, and mark
their corners, which are
the centres of the small squares, so that the remaining
sides, whose vanishing point is
inaccessible, can be drawn
in.
These centres being found, a
series
of
lines to Fat
proper distances each side oi 2F, 4F, etc. will cut the sides of the large squares at the
corners of the small ones, whose sides may then be filled in, completing the pavement.
Fig. 129 shows the process on a larger scale.
It will be noticed that a pavement of octagons, even more than one of squares, looks
tilted
if it is not symmetrical to the Ground Line — that
is, unless one series of its lines
is of front lines.
The artist therefore will prefer to arrange his pavement symmetrically
with the Ground Line unless the exigencies of the rest of his picture forbid.

PERSPECTIVE FROM ELEVATIONS
In
Fig. 130
is such a problem
as
is constantly occurring
in an
architect's
office.
Sketches of elevations have been made to scale, and
a perspective view
is
to be con-
structed from them.'
The vanishing points were set as far apart as the drawing board
allowed— here twenty-eight inches.
The picture will look best
if one elevation
is con-
siderably more foreshortened than the other, and the side will foreshorten
to
the
best
advantage.
The Centre then
is put twenty inches from the vanishing point Fon the
left, and only eight inches from V on the
right.
From the
elevations so much of a
perspective
outline plan
as
is necessary can be constructed, and the vertical lines are
plumbed up from
it.
The near angle A of the porch
is put in the picture plane
at
the Centre
; through
it are drawn the horizontal scale in the perspective plan and
the
scale of heights in the picture.
The measuring points may be determined in full
scale
on the board, or as here by a perspective chart at a fourth the
scale, to be transferred
to the drawing by multiplication.
The two elevations and perspective are drawn to the
same scale.
Ay and AV in the plan show the positions of the two visible walls of the house.
On them the dimensions of the front and side are measured off by M diX\d M', and the
widths of the porches, bays, and openings
are
set
off.
When the
projections
of
the
bays are laid off on AV produced in front of the Ground Line, the outlines of so much
of the perspective plan
as
is needed may be
put
in.
By plumbing up from the plan
and measuring the
heights on Ax in
the picture with
horizontals vanishing to ^and
V, the house is blocked up to the roof.
A house looks better, as well as more natural,
when the Horizon Line
is put rather low, — not much higher than
the eyes of a man
standing against
it, — and we choose the transom of the bay-windows for the horizon
level.
The placing of the muUions of the windows and the arches
of the porches
is
most
easily done without measuring, by bisection with
the help
of diagonals.
The
roofs, gables, eaves, and chimneys require special
constructions.
The gables
are
laid
out first in the plane of the wall, and the overhang is then added.
The pitches are all
45°, and
if the proper vanishing points
are within
reach, the construction
is
simple.
Assuming that they are not, we begin with the
side gable, measure the horizontal dis-
tance of the peak from the corner at
c, and plumb up to the picture the vertical
cc.
The
height, measured on Ax at a,
is transferred by the horizontal a V to cc at c in the picture.
A horizontal cVgivts the ridge of the gable, and
is prolonged
in front of the wall
to
cover the overhang.
The height
of the point b, where the vertical line of the corner
pierces the roof plane, is measured directly from the elevations, and the horizontal bV,
representing the intersection of the planes of the front and the
roof,
is prolonged
like
cViox the sake of the overhang.
This overhang may be measured
in the plan on the
prolongation of VA,
as the projection
of the bays was measured, and
the
line
b' V
* The elevations are copied as I find tliem printed
in the American Architect, and some small details
are omitted for the sake of clearness.

APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
represents the line of eaves in the plan.
The plan
of the horizontal eaves in front is
found in like manner, and their intersection ^' is plumbed up to b' in the picture.
Then
b'c', tending to V", accessible or inaccessible, represents the eaves-slope of the gable, and
its intersection
c' with cVis its peak, to be transferred
to the picture.
The other side
of the gable
is easily found, and the rest of the eaves in like manner.
The farther end
of the ridge is hidden behind the front gable.
This front gable we will find by a different process, the measuring lines being here
somewhat crowded.
The ridge of the gable produced will pierce the picture plane in a
point which
is projected in the plan at k, and is found in the picture by plumbing up to
its real height above HH ?A h : and on the indefinite
line of the ridge hV^ the peak k
is got from the plan after determining the overhang as for the other gable.
The face
of the gable projects as far as the front of the bays, while the eaves have a farther over-
hang
:
the corner/
is
fixed
like h by measuring
its height
in the picture plane.
The
farther end of the ridge,
/,
is the point where
the
ridge pierces the vertical plane that
contains the
cross ridge cV, and
the
half
of an assumed
rear gable may be drawn
to determine
the
bit of
its
slope.
In, which
rises above the
cross
ridge.
The
lines
of the verge boards and mouldings of the gables can be drawn to
their respective van-
ishing points above and below Fand V\ where these are
accessible, or can be
deter-
mined by one of the processes already given for such cases, — or finally, when
as here
the
scale
is small and the
lines
close
together, they may be considered
as
sensibly
parallel, and drawn
in
accordingly.
The valley eo
is determined thus
: the point e is
plumbed up on bVlxom. the plan, and eo,
being parallel to be, vanishes in
V".
But
if V" is not
in
reach, ^ may be found by
the horizontal rVm the plane of the roof,
^
whose
intersection
with
the
return
wall
~
plumbed
up
from
the
plan
is
o.
The
simplest way to fix the hip st is to draw the
ridge tV which
unites
it to the main roof
o
(seen
in
the
elevation but hidden in
the
perspective) from the trace
/' in which
it pierces the picture, determined
like the ridge
of the front gable.
Then
the
point / is plumbed up from the plan upon t'V.
The
chimneys are first placed on the plan.
The height of the main chimney, which bestrides
the ridge of the front gable, may be determined like that of the ridge
; that of the other,
which stands flush upon the side wall,
is measured directly on the scale of heights Ax.
The arches on this small scale are sketched in
;
the rest of the detail needs no comment.
One window in the side elevation, and the dormer which would flank the front gable on
the right, are omitted to avoid crowding the picture.
They present no difficulty.

scale the construction
of the
overhanging
corner

A BROACH SPIRE
The broach spire in Fig. 132 is an octagonal pyramid, set in the usual way on a square
tower of the same diameter.
Its plan
is a regular octagon inscribed
in
a square by
cutting off the corners, that
is, the octagon made by the overlapping of two concentric
squares.
The corners of the square of the tower are filled out by four triangular pyra-
mids or engaged pinnacles which lean against the adjacent sides of the spire, as shown
in the lower half of the plan.
The spire
is a high pyramid whose vertex is in the axis of
the tower, and the salient edges of the four small pyramids would meet in a lower point
of the axis, for they are symmetrically set, and may be regarded as the visible corners
of a single square pyramid which caps the tower, and is in great part covered up by the
spire.
The lines of the eaves of the tower, which indicate its plan, are constructed on the
diagonal squares used before for the octagon and circle.
The perspective square abed
being set out by its conjugate vanishing
points Fand V, the angles
of the octagon
are found as in Fig. 15 by the method of overlapping squares.
The half-diagonal e'f of
the square, set off both ways from e' on ax, thence measured on the side ab prolonged,
and transferred to the diameter^, gives the diagonal of the second square.
Lines ^8
andyS, intersecting the other diameter, fix the corners h and
k, and drawing also gk
we determine all the visible points at the base of the
spire.
Its edges may be drawn
when
its vertex has been measured
off, which is done here by a line m'h perspectively
parallel to the diagonal ac, at the proper height in the scale of heights am', intersecting
the axis of the spire in m.
The corner pyramids are drawn in like manner, the salient
edges meeting
in «, determined like m.
The nearer one only is completely seen
:
its
arris is stopped against the middle
line pm of the near face of the spire, or the height
of
its vertex may be measured from/' by
8, since the edge ap
is in the vertical
plane
of measures that passes through am' and om.
The lower dormers, which centre on the
middle lines em, etc. of the cardinal faces of the spire, are best placed by drawing lines
am, bm, dm, which indicate the pyramid of the spire
filled out to the square of the top
of the tower, and encircling this pyramid with squares at the height of the bases, eaves,
and ridges of the dormers.
The recession of these dormers from the face of the tower
calls for a special construction to determine
their width and
projection.
The width is
plumbed up from the eaves of the
spire
at V and /', on verticals on which
the
height
of the bases is projected from the scale of heights.
The same height being projected
for the encompassing
square,
the
width
is projected back upon
this encompassing
square from
the verticals
in
/ and
/, and
straight
lines drawn upward from
i' and /'
through / and / will represent
parallels in
the face of the spire which will contain the
valleys between the dormers and the spire.
A similar construction gives the positions
of the upper lines of dormers, which are based at the height of the point n.

MOULDINGS — BASE OF A PEDESTAL AND CONSOLE
The drawing of architectural mouldings
in
perspective requires peculiar care
:
the
representations are of no value
to the
architect unless they are precise.
Any want of
accuracy
is apt to change their effect greatly, and mislead the designer, or misrepresent
the object.
The profiling is seen chiefly at the corners of mitres, and many mouldings
miss their intended effect from not having been studied from this point of view.
Fig. 133 shows the base mouldings of a pedestal in perspective
: below is a profile of
the base at the scale of the perspective, and
a
plan and
elevation
at one founh
that
scale.
The mitre profiles give the best opportunity of constructing the perspective, for
in them two sets
of horizontal
lines
meet.
They are drawn
first, beginning with
the
front corner, where the vertical Ax is the scale of heights.
Having placed the corner A
and the lines AB and AD, we lay off from A on Ax the heights of the different mould-
ings at
c, e,f, g, h.
Lines drawn from these points to 8 will be horizontals in the mitre
plane, on which are to be found the points of the mitre profile.
The horizontal Aa on
the profile shows the projections on the mitre line.
If the measuring point M" for the
mitre lines that vanish in 8
is within reach, these projections can be measured off at once
on Aa, from which
verticals
intersecting
<:8,
^8, etc. will give
the
points
of the
mitre
profile in perspective.
Lines drawn from these
points and from the division points of
Aa to V 2i\\A V give the perspectives and the plan of the base and mouldings, and
if
the vanishing point conjugate to 8 were within reach, the mitre lines Bb and Dd could
be drawn toward
it, and the points of the mitre profiles projected up from them.
But
it is out of reach, and the mitre line Dd is found by completing the perspective square
ADEF, and drawing
its diagonal FD, which
is produced
in Dd.
The diagonal of a
similarsquare constructed on ^Z? gives Bb in like manner.
It may be, however, that the
measuring point for 8 is not at hand.
Then instead of measuring the projections of the
mouldings directly on Aa, they must be first measured on a right section and transferred
to Aa.
Here they are measured on a line Dk, vanishing in V, which
is the horizontal
trace of a right section plane.
The point D
is referred to the front line of measures at
m from the measuring point M.
The projections m-i, 1-2, 2-j, measured on Dk, and
transferred
to
the
mitre
lines Aa and Dd, give
the same points
that were found, or
would have been found, by the first construction.
In Fig. 134 are two elevations and
the
perspective
of a console to
the same scale.
The console
is rectangular
in
plan
:
the conjugate vanishing points are within reach,
though off the sheet
; the measuring points and 8 are only indicated by their directions;
the
angle between
the wall and
the console
in
the
perspective
serves
for a scale of
heights, which are ruled
off
directly from
the
elevations.
The projections, shown by
the ordinates i, 2, 3, etc. and the widths on the face are measured on the line of meas-
ures ab, the measuring lines being mostly erased to avoid crowding the drawing, which
sufficiently explains the construction.

PERSPECTIVE OF A PEDIMENT
Fig. 13S
is the perspective of a pediment, in which the difference between the raking
cornices and the
horizontal somewhat complicates the problem.
The figure gives the
front elevation of one half, showing both cornices at the scale of the perspective.
The
scale of heights
is taken on Aa
in the extreme front corner, and
the perspective plan
in dotted lines above.
The members of the horizontal and raking cornices meet in the
mitre plane at
ab.
We might measure
off the projections of the mitre profile for the
plan at ab' by the measuring point M', on ad' vanishing at V, and then transfer each
measurement
to ab' by lines which vanished
in V ; but we
shall save transferring
if,
after finding the extreme point 7 on ad', and transferring
it to b' on
rtS, we draw 7b' and
produce
it
to the accidental measuring point m, and then draw from the other points
J, 4, J, 6 directly to m.
The points
thus found on ab' , projected down on horizontals
drawn at the proper heights on AC and vanishing in
S, give the points of the perspective
profile Ab.
The
lines of the upward raking cornice converge to the vanishing point
y", vertically over F' and determined as usual by a^slope line from the measuring point
M'.
Then the lines of the two upper fillets of its crown moulding and the corona can
be drawn in at once.
The rise of the pediment being laid off at Ac, and the half width
at
cc', the vertex
is found
at d.
The plane of the ridge
profile passes through d,
its
horizontals vanish
at
F, and the ridge appears only in plan — the line d' F— its
per-
spective being hidden by the pediment.
The projections of the ridge profile are found
on d' Fin the plan, projected by lines from the angle profile ab' to F', and its heights on
the scale of heights
at
(/".
The points i, 2,/, etc. taken from
the elevation, are pro-
jected on dd' from (/"(at their true height on Aa) by lines vanishing in
F'.
It must be
borne in mind, however, that the heights of the crown mouldings are not the same as
those of their horizontal counterparts, which they intersect obliquely, and are to be taken
from the vertical section at ac in the elevation, while the other members, which do not
intersect the horizontal ones, are free to correspond to them.
The lines of the upward
rake can be drawn through the angles of the ridge profile from the vanishing point F",
and those of the two
fillets should coincide with those which
are already drawn.
If
the point F" had been out of reach, it would have been necessary to construct an inter-
mediate
profile, parallel
to
the
ridge
profile.
The
lines on
the
soffit of the upward
raking corona are out of sight.
The
lines of the downward raking cornice might be drawn
directly from the ridge
profile to their vanishing point
F'",
if
that were
accessible.
In
this case
it
is out of
reach, and we construct the mitre profile at the farther corner
e, which is measured off
on cF' like ^and plumbed down on AF'.
The mitre
line for the profile at e" in the
plan cannot be drawn to its vanishing point, for that also is out of reach.
But the mitre
lines at a and e" in the plan, being perspectively symmetrical about the line d' F{which
is in the same horizontal plane with them, and being in the vertical plane
of the ridge

88
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
is at right angles with ae") must intersect on
it.
Therefore we extend ab' till
it meets
d'Vm h, and draw ^'h, which must contain the mitre line at e".
Upon
this mitre line
we project the dividing lines of the profiles at ab' and hd' ; then the points of division
are projected vertically on the lines of the horizontal cornice already drawn toward V\
making the points of the profile in the picture.

ENTABLATURE IN PERSPECTIVE
Fig. 136 is the corner of a modillioned entablature, with the plan and
elevation at
the scale of the perspective.
The perspective could be made from geometric drawings
on a smaller scale, but in constructing architectural detail
it
is best to make the neces-
sary enlargement beforehand in the geometric drawings, for the chance of accumulated
errors is so great as to make perspective enlargement hazardous.
For a problem as complex as this
it is well to make a detached perspective plan, and
to show
it from beneath, with the arrangement of the modillions and dentils.
The scale
of heights aab is taken at the projecting angle a of the upper moulding, where
it inter-
feres
less with
the
picture than
it would
at
the angle
of the
frieze, though
it slightly
reduces the scale of the picture.
V, V, M, and 8 are assumed
to be determined, and
also the extreme height above the Horizon Line.
The perspective plan is displayed by
setting its angle a well above the picture.
The corners of the frieze in the plan is found
on the mitre line aS by measuring off the overhang at d from the horizontal scale ax by
means of M, and drawing adV; <rFand cV are the lines of the frieze.
The overhangs
of the members of the cornice are found by the method of p. 25 and Fig. 31, setting off
ae on the scale ax for the
full overhang, joining
ec, and prolonging
it to the Horizon
Line at m, which will
serve
for an
accidental measuring
point.
The principal points
I, 2,3, 4,s are first found, representing the overhangs
of the corona, the modillions,
modillion-band, dentils, and dentil-band; and lines drawn to Kand V represent these
members in the plan on the two faces of the entablature.
The corresponding heights are
set off on ab in the picture
at i', 2', etc., and mitre
lines being drawn to
8, the points
. /, 2, etc. are projected on them from the plan.
This
fixes
the corners of the principal
members
in the
picture, from which
lines
are drawn,
representing
their
edges,
to
rand
yi.
The modillions and dentils might be constructed directly on the picture, but
it will be
clearer and safer to construct them
first on the plan.
That on
the
left at
the angle
stands in line with the band to the right ;
its front side is found on the plan by produc-
ing V'j to 6 ; and 6, projected back from Mupon the measuring
line ax at 6', is used
as a starting point for measuring off the rest at/', 8',
g', etc.
The
lines
of the
modil-
lions drawn in by means of these points are projected down
directly upon the picture.
For those on the right face the measuring point M' is out of reach.
They are found by
projection from those on the
left, continuing the sides
till they intersect aS in k,
/, etc.,
and then projecting these points from Fupon jT'.
For want of room to continue on
the left the measures beyond 8 are transferred to a second line lower down as in Fig. 35.
The dentils are laid out as is shown by the
scale on
the
right of a, one centring with
each
modillion, and
three between
; but to avoid confusion of lines we start from the
corner/ of the
dentil band, projecting 5' on Jllf, and use
the accidental measuring
point n.
Mitre lines to 8 through the front corners of the modillions, as in h, give the
mitres of the moulding which crowns them and the band between them, and will cut off

go
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
squares at the ends of them by which counter diagonals can be drawn to give the mitres
at the
alternate
corners.
In
the same way the mouldings of the panels between the
modillions can be drawn with their mitres.
The transference of these
details
to the
picture
is a simple matter of vertical
projection.
Eggs and
darts and
the
leaves of
the bed-mould
at the base
of the
cornice may be
sketched
in, one egg
or one
leaf
over or under each
dentil
;
their positions may be determined by carrying profile lines
down the
face
of the
cornice without referring to the perspective plan.
The drawing
of the intermediate lines of the mouldings requires no new construction.



A ROMANESQUE ARCADE
In Fig. 137 a Romanesque arcade is shown in perspective.
The geometric plan is on
the scale of the
picture, the
partial elevation on
half that
scale, the perspective chart
on one fifth.
The arches are semicircles recessed
in two orders, showing a main arch
and a sub-arch carried by piers and columns in alternation, and the piers are subdivided
to match the imposts
of
the
arches.
It
is these imposts
that are constructed in
the
perspective plan, for by them are determined the positions of the arches, which are the
most important elements of the problem.
The
section
of the arches
is shown in con-
nection with the perspective plan.
The abaci and the plinths repeat the outline of the
imposts in the piers, but not in the columns, whose abaci and plinths are square.
The
picture
plane passes through the axis of the shaft attached to the front of the first pier,
which
axis
is
in the plane of the wall, as appears at A in
the geometric
plan, and
is
the
scale
of heights in the picture.
The height of the Horizon Line is shown
at HH
in the elevation.
The angle of the picture plane and the wall plane
is shown by PP
in the geometric plan, and the Centre is opposite
the centre of the
first arch.
Fand
V are both off the sheet.
The perspective plan being constructed
in
the usual way, the arches are drawn by
means of tangents at 45°, with the help of the auxiliary quadrants be,cf, and dg.
They
are lifted on low stilts whose upright edges, plumbed up from the plan, are vertical tan-
gents to the arch curves at the springing, the impost being on the horizontal a V.
The
middle point
in the plan gives the perspective centre
of the first arch, and the central
vertical ot' on which we project, by lines that vanish in V, the tangent
intersections
t'
and s' and the crown points d' and
c'.
The tangents are fixed by projecting their inter-
sections/ and n with the vertical at/upon that at/' in/' and «', and upon that at /"
in/" and «",• and when / and k are also projected in /' and /", k' and k", the inner and
outer curves of the main arch may be drawn.
The face of the sub-arch recedes from that of the wall, displaying the under surface
or soffit of the main arch, and making a recess whose section is the broken line k"k"'h".
The outer curve of the sub-arch, in the angle of the
recess,
is geometrically equal and
parallel to the inner curve of the main arch, answering exactly to the rear curve of the
arch in Fig. 63, and constructed in the same way.
The point
0', plumbed up from the
plan,
is the centre of the front curves of the sub-arch, and the upright o's" contains its
vertical diameter.
Then
j", r", f", and b",
projected from s\ r',
c', and
b', upon
this
vertical give corresponding points by which
the curves c"k'" and b"h", etc. are fixed.
A further
projection backward gives
r'",
b'^', h'", etc., to determine the curve
at the
back of the sub-arch.
It is to be remembered that the broken line l"k"k'"h"h"', like
the joints in the arch
of Fig. 63, lies in a plane that passes through
the common
axis
of the
soffits, and
its
successive
portions, prolonged, pass alternately through 0,
V, and 0'.
Therefore when
the tangents are fixed and the point /" found, this
line can be continued round the

9i
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
arches without projecting the successive points from At.
Nevertheless, in a matter so
delicate as the deiermination of the arch curves,
it
is safer to construct the points inde-
pendently than to follow round from one to another, and better to use
this last method
for a verificat'on.
It will be seen, too, that the tangents, being 45° lines in the plane of
the wall face
or
parallel vertical
pl.ines, will
be
parallels which vanish
in
the vertical
sub distance points above and below V, the vertical that passes through V being the
horizon of all such planes.
The rest of the construction offers nothing new.



GROINED VAULTING
The groined vault shown
in Fig. 138
illustrates some
of the devices which
special
problems suggest, as well as the use of tangents for perspective curves.
The vaults are
of uniform semicircular section, covering two series of aisles at right angles, and card id
on columns.
The arrangement of the plan and elevation
are given at one third the
scale of the perspective.
The vaults spring from cubical stilt blocks, which are as broad
as the plinths of the bases, their diameter being one fourth the span of the vaults.
The
picture plane
is passed through the axis of column^, for convenience of measurement,
and is tangent to the near corner of the plinth B.
C is the Centre, and SC the
Axis,
as
usual.
By
the
angle EBA the perspective
chart may be constructed, say at the
scale of the plan, and the points
transferred with due enlargement of distances to the
Horizon Line.
We begin with a perspective plan.
Taking GG at a convenient distance below HH,
so that the plan may open well, we project A upon
it, and draw AA
' the axis of column
A.
The columns stand at the corners of adjoining squares, and laying out these squares
we find the axes
of
as many columns as will appear in the
picture.
The square plan
of the first base being constructed in the usual way at A, and its vanishing sides being
continued
indefinitely toward
f^'and
F', two corners of each of the other bases are
determined on these lines by drawing through their centres diagonals to the mitre point
8, and the plans of all are easily found.
A wall runs behind the third range of columns
against the plinths of the
bases, touching also the
stilt
blocks, while the shafts stand
free.
The counter diagonals of the bays should be drawn, to determine
their centres,
for the intersections of the groins come over these
centres.
It
is well
to verify their
positions by drawing an
axial
line down the middle
of each
aisle, which must pass
through the centres of all the bays.
The axes in both directions will prove useful.
Having fixed a suitable height for the springing of the vault, we
next construct the
stilt
blocks, plumbing up
their vertical edges from the plan below and drawing the
necessary lines to Fand F' for their upper and lower edges.
The drawing of the groins
requires much care.
The upright edges of the stilt blocks provide vertical tangents at
the springing points yjyj etc.; the hori-
zontal
tangents
at
the crowns
are
the
diagonals of a
series of squares
corre-
sponding to those in the plan.
To provide intermediate
tangents, let
us imagine a tangent plane to the cylin-
der of one vault
\
it will contain
all the
tangents
to
sections
of
the
cylinder
along the line of contact.
Thus in Fig.
139 einl represents a right section of the
vault and abed a tangent plane at, say,
T^/Jf

94
APPLIED PERSPECTIVE
45°.
If mn is the line
of contact, any oblique tangent bk in the plane will touch the
cylinder
at some point w of this line.
Let the vertical plane
of
this tangent be
egbk,
dind fmh
its
section of the cylinder, of which gh
is
a
vertical
diameter,
lifmh
is a
groin, the vertical fp
will be the edge
of a
stilt
block, and gk the
vertical through
the centre
of a bay, the
axis
of the bay we may call
it.
The plane
of the springing
of
the vault
is
bae, which
will contain
the points / and g.
There will be four groin
tangents for each bay, corresponding to bk, intersecting in k, and forming the edges of
a square pyramid whose base will be in a horizontal
plane, the
plane
of the springing
bae, as appears in Fig. 140.
The four tangent points will
all be at the same height in
a
horizontal plane
at
the
level
of mn,
as here
shown.
We have
to
construct such
a pyramid
over each bay, which will give us tangents to each
of the groins, while the point h will give the in-
tersection
of the groins, where the tangents are
horizontal.
In
Fig. 138 at a, the
level of the springing, in
column A, we set up against the axis of the column
**"
the auxiliary quadrant a/h\ representing half the
section of the vault, and draw the 45° tangent
bk'.
Then
h' marks the height of the
crown of the vault, k' of the vertex k, and m' of the tangent point m.
The heights of
h' and k' may be measured off on the axis of the first bay, plumbed up from^, by diago-
nals vanishing in the mitre point 8, which will give k and h.
In constructing the pyramid
of tangents it will be convenient to use, instead of the feet of the tangents, b for instance,
the points where they intersect the axes of the columns, because
these points are each
common
to four tangents
in
adjoining bays.
Now the vault springs from the face of
the
stilt block, represented
in
the quadrant by/' (which
in
the drawing accidentally
falls on one of the lines of the vaulting)
; fa' represents half the thickness of the block,
and a'c' the axis of the column, intersected
in
c' by the tangent.
Then
c' horizontally
projected on the real axis a/^' gives the point of intersection
c.
Drawing ck, therefore, we
have the tangent to that groin of the
first bay AD which springs from column A at/
behind the impost.
In
the same way m" projected on ak', gives
the height m' of the
tangent point, to be again projected on the tangent at w by a mitre line to 8.
The point
c mny be projected on the other three axes by horizontal lines which will form a square
add directly over the square of the bay in
the
plan, giving
the
points from which the
tangents that complete the pyramid may be drawn to k.
The tangent point m may be
repeated in the same way on the square mnmn.
The intersection h of the groins at the
crown of the vault
is already determined
:
the tangents here may be found by repeating
the horizontal square at the level of h and drawing its diagonals, of which
hh', already
drawn,
is one.
We have now five points and five tangents for each of the groin curves
of the
first bay, by which the gxo\x\s,ftn/imf and enhne may be drawn in.
It is a simple
matter to extend the construction to all the other bays by horizontal projecting lines.
The construction of the arches at the back wall, which are right sections of the vaults,
is the usual one,
all the lines being in one
plane.
The
scale
of heights ach'k'
is
pro-
jected back on the plane of the wall on
the vertical from/, the centre line of the back
of the plinth of column F, making the scale a"c"h"k", and the heights are carried along

.<^


GROINED VAULTING

the wall
in horizontals vanishing
at
V.
The meeting points of the tangents and the
crowns of the arches are
in the verticals from
q,
q', etc., the centre lines of the bays of
the wall
; the lower ends of the tangents are in the verticals from/,/', etc., in line with
the axes of the columns, at the height of c".
,
The plan of a base at the scale of the perspective is shown
at K.
The diameter of
the shaft is half the diagonal of the plinth or
stilt block, and being determined for A
may be projected from column
to column, or in a drawing to so small a scale as this,
where the half the diagonals are almost front
lines, may be measured geometrically on
each base with less danger
of error than
it can be
projected.
The
capitals may be
constructed
by means
already known,
if the
scale
of
the drawing
calls for
it, or they
may be sketched, as here.
The bases
are omitted in order that the
perspective
plan
may be more clearly displayed.
The column E is included in the
picture, although
it
is in front of the picture plane, to show the
intersection
of the groins on the left of A,
the choice of the
limits
of an
interior view being always arbitrary, and determined by
the artist's idea of a desirable effect.
It is sometimes convenient to place a column, or
even a series of columns, by visual projection, as at E' in the plan, where, as
is obvious,
this gives at once the position and the diameter of the shaft.

A VAULT WITH LUNETTES
Fig. 141
is the perspective of a vault with lunettes, all of which are
of semicircular
section.
The main vault is a cylinder of which x is the radius
; y is that of the lunettes,
whose vaults, springing at the same level, intersect
it at right angles.
i^Fis the axis of
the main vault, and JSFihe line of its springing, both vanishing at
F. V is the conju-
gate point in which vanish ON, and the other axes of the lunette vaults.
The plane of
the lunettes is somewhat recessed from the springing line, to give relief to the pendents
of the groins.
Assuming the point a on the springing line £Vlo\ the foot of one groin,
we construct aA, the depth
of the
recess, taking A for the angle
at the base of the
lunette, and At for the
scale of heights, AA' or AB being the
radius
of the
lunette,
and JSA' the auxiliary quadrant with its 45° tangent tj.
To construct the curve of the
lunette with
precision, intermediate
points i, 2, 4, 5, are taken on
the quadrant A'B.
They are projected, like the tangent point j, both horizontally and vertically, and being
constructed
in
their proper
perspective position,
the curve of
the lunette
is drawn
through them.
The principal point in the problem is the construction of the groins.
If the vaults of
the lunettes were cylindrical, like the main vault, a series
of horizontal planes through
i-r, 2-2,3-3, etc. would
contain corresponding horizontal
right-lined elements of
all
the vaults
; the intersections of corresponding elements would be points of the groins,
and would easily fix their curves.
But
these vaults
are cones with horizontal axes
at
right angles to the axis of the main vault, vanishing, as we saw, at V.
The vertex of
the cone of the first lunette
is N, on OVK
NB', drawn
to the crown of
the lunette,
will be the highest element
of
its
vault, and will penetrate the main vault
in F', the
crowning point of the groin.
All the vertices N, N', etc. lie in a horizontal line which
vanishes in
V.
A plane passing through this line NN' and touching B would be tan-
gent to every lunette
at the crown, and contain the highest elements of all the cones.
It would cut the main vault in a line VF' which would contain
the crown points of all
the groins and vanish in
^^
A plane that passes through NN' and through the points
3,3 on the curve of the lunette, cutting the plane of the lunette in the horizontal j-j,
will contain two elements jA^ jiV^ which will pierce the main vault in two points j',j'
of one horizontal element, and these points will be points of the groin.
The same will
hold for the other pairs of points, i-i, 2-2, etc.
To find the element j'-j' of the main
vault, we construct a
right
section F'P of the vault made by a vertical plane passing
through
Ot', which shall contain the axis CA^and be perpendicular to the lunette.
This
plane is cut by the plane N3-3
in a
line c'cN which
intersects 3-3 in
c.
If c' is the
intersection
of Nc with the section-curve, the horizontal c'VwiW be an element
of the
main vault lying in the plane N3-3, and the points j',j' in which
it cuts the lines j-j',
3-3' will be points in both main vault and lunette vault, and therefore in their intersec-
tion, the groin.
The other pairs of points,
i'-t', 2'-2', etc. may be found by the same
process, and the line of the groin drawn through them.
The entablature from which
the vault springs is constructed as in a previous problem by the help of the mitre-point.
Here, as elsewhere, some numbers which would duplicate others symmetrically placed
are left oil the drawing for the sake of clearness.
