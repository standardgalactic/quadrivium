xii  Excel 2010 For Dummies Quick Reference

Getting to Know 
Excel 2010
With Microsoft’s popular Excel spreadsheet program, you can enter, manipulate, and 
analyze data in ways that would be impossible, cumbersome, or error prone for you 
to do manually. This part gives you the basics you need to get up and running 
quickly in Excel.
 
In this part . . .
✓ Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2010 Window
✓ Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard
✓ Introducing the Ribbon, Quick Access Toolbar, and Backstage View
✓ Formatting with Themes and Previewing Your Formatting Live
Part 1

2  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
Excel 2010 Basics
Excel documents are known as workbooks. A single workbook can store as many 
sheets as will fit into memory, and these sheets are stacked like the pages in a 
notebook. Sheets can be either worksheets (a normal spreadsheet-type sheet 
with rows and columns) or chart sheets (a special sheet that holds a single 
chart).
Most of the time, you perform tasks in worksheets. Each worksheet uses a grid 
with 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns. Excel numbers rows starting with 1 and 
assigns letters to columns starting with A. After Excel exhausts the letters of the 
alphabet, column lettering continues with AA, AB, and so on. So column 1 is A, 
column 26 is Z, column 27 is AA, column 52 is AZ, column 53 is BA, and so on. 
Rows are numbered from 1 to 1,048,576, and columns are labeled from A to XFD.
The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell. A quick calculation using 
Excel tells us that this works out to 17,179,869,184 cells — more than enough for 
just about any use. Cells have addresses, which are based on their row and 
column. The upper-left cell in a worksheet is called A1, and the cell down at the 
bottom right is called XFD1048576. Cell K9 (also known as the dog cell) is the 
intersection of the eleventh column and the ninth row.
You might be wondering about the amount of system memory (known as 
random access memory, or RAM) you need to accommodate all those rows and 
columns. The memory you need depends on the amount of data you store in 
the workbook and the number of open workbooks. In Excel 2010, the memory 
available is limited by the maximum amount of memory that your version of 
Windows (XP, Vista, or Windows 7) can use.
Formulas
A cell in Excel can hold a number, some text, a formula, or nothing at all. You 
already know what numbers and text are, but you may be a bit fuzzy on the 
concept of a formula. A formula tells Excel to perform a calculation using 
information stored in other cells. For example, you can insert a formula that tells 
Excel to add the values in the first 10 cells in column A and to display the result 
in the cell that contains the formula.
Formulas can use normal arithmetic operators such as + (plus), – (minus), 
* (multiply), and / (divide). They can also use special built-in functions that let 
you do powerful things without much effort on your part. For example, Excel 
has functions that add a range of values, calculate square roots, compute loan 
payments, and even tell you the time of day. Excel has more than 300 built-in 
functions, which are categorized by type — Math, Financial, Statistical and so 
on. Part 5 covers the basics of using functions in Excel.

Excel 2010 Basics — Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2010 Window  3
Active cell and ranges
In Excel, one of the cells in a worksheet is always the active cell. The active cell 
is the one that’s selected, and it’s displayed with a thicker border than the 
others. Its contents appear in the formula bar. You can select a group, or range, 
of cells by clicking and dragging the mouse pointer over them. You can then 
issue a command that does something to the active cell or to the range.
The selected range is usually a group of contiguous cells, but it doesn’t have to 
be. To select a noncontiguous group of cells, select the first cell or group of 
cells, hold down the Ctrl key while you drag the mouse, and select the next cell 
or group of cells.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2010 Window
Figure 1-1 shows a typical Excel 2010 window, with the important parts labeled. 
This terminology rears its ugly head throughout the book, so you should review 
the figure from time to time.
Moving, resizing, and closing windows
When Excel and workbook windows are in a restored state (between a maximized 
and minimized state, that is) you can use the resize handles to adjust the 
window size to your liking. Move the mouse pointer to the area of the resize 
handle until the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, and then drag with 
the mouse.
You can move the window around the screen by dragging the title bars. See also 
“Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard,” later in this part.
When the active workbook window is maximized, it shares a single Close button 
with the Excel window. After you click the shared Close button, Excel closes the 
active workbook.
Exiting Excel
Use any one of the following methods to close the Excel application:
 ✓ 
Click the Close button on the Excel title bar if one or no workbook is open.
 ✓ 
Click the File tab and then click the Exit button.
 ✓ 
Press the Alt key, then press F, and then press X.

Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2010 Window — Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard  5
Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard
The mouse is the primary tool that you use in Excel for executing commands, 
making selections, and navigating in the worksheet. Following are the mouse 
conventions that we use in this book:
 ✓ 
Click: Click the left mouse button once.
 
✓ Double-click: Click the left mouse button twice in quick succession.
 
✓ Right-click:  Click the right mouse button once.
 
✓ Drag: Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse. Release the 
mouse button to complete the drag operation.
 ✓ 
Hover: Place the mouse pointer over an element without clicking a mouse 
button.
 ✓ 
Select: Place the mouse pointer over an element and click the left mouse 
button.
Mousing around
Every mouse action is associated with some element in the Excel window. An 
element can be a slider, button, cell, chart object, and so on. You select or hover 
over the element using the mouse pointer.
Navigating through a worksheet with a mouse works just as you’d expect. Click 
a cell, and it becomes the active cell. If the cell that you want to activate isn’t 
visible in the workbook window, you can use the scroll bars to scroll the 
window in any direction, as follows:
 
✓ To scroll one cell, click one of the arrows on the scroll bar.
 
✓ To scroll by a complete screen, click either side of the scroll bar’s slider.
 
✓ To scroll faster, drag the slider.
 
✓ To scroll a long distance vertically, press and hold the Shift key while 
dragging the slider button.
Note that only the active workbook window displays scroll bars. If you activate a 
different window, its scroll bars appear.
After you right-click a cell, a range of cells, or another object in the worksheet 
area, Excel displays a contextual menu, so-called because the menu includes 
commands specific to working with the cell, range, or object.
For your convenience, Excel adds a minitoolbar above the contextual menu with 
useful commands drawn from the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 1-2. See also 
“Introducing the Ribbon,” later in this part.

Using the keyboard
Most users will be comfortable using the mouse to do all their work in Excel. For 
users who prefer to use the keyboard exclusively when working in Windows 
applications or for users who prefer to split the use of the mouse and keyboard 
among various tasks, Excel provides the following solutions:
 
✓ Keyboard shortcuts
 
✓ Keyboard navigation
 
✓ KeyTips
The first two functions are described next. For more on the last function, 
KeyTips, see “Tipping off your keyboard,” later in this part.
You can access commands in Excel using keyboard shortcuts, which are individual 
keystrokes or a combination of keys pressed simultaneously. To access the 
Print command using a shortcut, for example, you hold down the Ctrl key and 
press the P key, represented in this book as Ctrl+P. The following table lists 
some common keyboard shortcuts in Excel.

Introducing the Ribbon
Excel comes with a user interface called the Ribbon, which consists of a series of 
horizontal tabs, each containing a variety of commands grouped according to 
function (see Figure 1-3). Most features in Excel 2010 are available through the 
commands on the Ribbon tabs.
Figure 1-3
 
Contextual tab header
Home tab
Dialog launcher
Split button
Contextual tabs
Dissecting the parts of the Ribbon
The commands on the Ribbon are accessed through a variety of controls. Here’s 
a list of the various types of controls and other parts that make up the Ribbon:
 ✓ 
Button: This is the most common type of control. Most buttons on the 
Ribbon (except the formatting ones) have descriptive text associated with 
them, so you don’t need to be a Mensa expert to figure out what a button 
represents. The most frequently used commands on each Ribbon tab have 
larger buttons.
 
 Most buttons execute commands directly when you click them. However, 
some buttons have an embedded downward-pointing arrow, and others 
have an attached downward-pointing arrow. Clicking a button with an 
embedded arrow displays a menu or gallery. For a button with an attached 

Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard — Introducing the Ribbon  9
arrow (known as a split button), the icon or text part of the button 
represents the most common command for the button. Clicking the arrow 
part displays a menu or gallery with additional commands or formatting 
choices. The two types of buttons with arrows look similar, but if you 
hover the mouse pointer over a button with an attached arrow, you see a 
clear delineation between the icon or text (command) part and the arrow 
(menu) part (refer to Figure 1-3).
 ✓ 
Check box: This is a square box that you click to turn an option on or off.
 ✓ 
Command group: Each Ribbon tab contains groups of related commands. 
For example, you find commands related to text fonts in the Font group of 
the Home tab.
 ✓ 
Dialog launcher: A dialog launcher is a command that launches a dialog 
box (a pop-up window) from a command group, menu, or gallery. The 
dialog launcher in a command group is a little button in the bottom right of 
the group frame. In addition, some menus and galleries contain options 
that launch dialog boxes. After you click a dialog launcher, a dialog box 
appears that presents additional choices. (However, the Ribbon displays 
the commands you are likely to use frequently, thus minimizing the need 
to launch dialog boxes.)
 ✓ 
Drop-down list: This list contains things you can choose from. Click the 
control’s downward-pointing arrow to display the list.
 ✓ 
Gallery: A gallery is a control that presents you with a set of graphic 
choices, such as a particular formatting style (patterns, colors, and effects) 
or a predefined layout. An example of a predefined layout is a chart choice 
with specific elements preselected for inclusion in the chart. Galleries 
enable Excel to be more results oriented; that is, they present the likely 
result you are looking for first and then expose advanced choices through 
a dialog box or Ribbon command. 
 
 Three types of galleries are available:
 • Drop-down gallery: This is displayed after you click certain buttons 
with downward-pointing arrows. This type of gallery presents a single 
column of choices and includes both graphic and text elements.
 • Drop-down grid: This is displayed after you click certain buttons 
with downward-pointing arrows. This type of gallery presents a 
two-dimensional grid of choices and does not include text.
 • In-Ribbon gallery: This is like the drop-down grid, but this gallery 
exposes a single row of choices directly within a Ribbon control group. 
You can click up and down scroll arrows to reveal additional rows, or 
you can click a drop-down arrow to display the full set of choices in a 
two-dimensional grid.

10  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
 ✓ 
Menu, rich: Rich menus have illustrative graphics, the command name, 
and in some cases a short description of what the command does.
 
 Remember: Don’t confuse rich menus with drop-down galleries, although 
they look similar. Menus contain related commands. Galleries allow you to 
choose from among a set of formats or layouts.
 ✓ 
Menu, standard: Most users are already familiar with this form of menu — 
a drop-down list of choices with command names (such as Copy or Insert 
Cells). Some command names have small associated icons. If you click a 
command name that ends with an ellipsis (…), Excel displays a dialog box 
that presents further choices.
 ✓ 
Spinner: A spinner is a control with two arrows (one pointing up, the other 
pointing down) used with an input box to specify a number (height or 
width, for example.) Clicking an arrow increases or decreases the number 
in the input box. You can also enter a number in the box directly. The 
spinner control allows you to use only valid numbers.
 ✓ 
Tab, contextual: Contextual tabs give the Ribbon the power to expose 
most Excel features. One or more contextual tabs appear after you insert 
or select an object, such as a chart, shape, table, or picture. For example, 
after you insert a chart, three contextual tabs related to chart functionality 
appear on the Ribbon and a header labeled Chart Tools appears on the 
Excel title bar above the contextual tabs. Contextual tabs contain all the 
commands you need for working with the particular object. After you 
deselect an object, the contextual tabs (and the header) disappear.
 
 The general rules that govern the display of contextual tabs follow:
 • After you select an object (such as a chart, shape, or table), one or 
more contextual tabs for the object appear on the Ribbon. You must 
select a tab to display the associated commands.
 • After you insert an object, Excel displays the commands for the first tab 
of the contextual tab set for that object.
 • After you double-click an object, Excel displays the commands for the 
first tab of the contextual tab set for that object. Note that not all 
objects have this double-click capability.
 • After you select, deselect, and then reselect the object without using 
any other commands in-between, Excel displays the commands for the 
first tab of the contextual tab set for that object.
 ✓ 
Tab, custom: In addition to the built-in standard and contextual Ribbon 
tabs that Excel includes, you can create custom Ribbon tabs.

Introducing the Ribbon  11
 ✓ 
Tab, standard: The Ribbon comes with a set of standard tabs, each 
organized according to the functions of the commands that it contains. 
For example, the Insert tab contains command groups to insert shapes, 
charts, tables, pictures, and so on. An exception is the Home tab, which is 
so-named because this is where you do most of your work in Excel.
 
 
 If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can navigate quickly among the 
Ribbon tabs by hovering the mouse pointer over the Ribbon area and 
scrolling the wheel back and forth.
 ✓ 
Text box: A box in which you enter a number or text. In general, the 
Ribbon associates a text box with another control, such as a spinner or a 
drop-down box.
Sizing up the Ribbon
The layout of the Ribbon controls is not static. Depending on your screen 
resolution, or the Excel window size, or both, the Ribbon provides one of four 
layout options for command groups. If sufficient space is available, the Ribbon 
presents a layout that labels commands, displays more commands individually, 
and eliminates extra mouse clicks. As you resize the Ribbon downwards (by 
reducing the screen resolution or shrinking the size of the Excel window), the 
Ribbon rearranges the layout of some of the command groups by first resizing 
command buttons (larger buttons become smaller), then removing labels 
from commands, and finally reducing the groups to single large buttons (see 
Figure 1-4). To access the commands in a command group that the Ribbon 
resizes to a single button, you must first click the button to display a menu and 
then select the command.
Figure 1-4
 

12  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
It is important to note that at each stage of downward resizing, no command 
groups or commands disappear entirely from the Ribbon. The multiple layout 
options for the command groups ensure that nothing is lost as space becomes 
more limited. If you reduce the size of the Excel window sufficiently, however, 
the Ribbon disappears altogether.
Tipping off your keyboard
Excel provides KeyTips, which allow you to access every command on the 
Ribbon using the keyboard, without having to memorize keystroke combinations! 
So, what are KeyTips? KeyTips are little alphanumerical indicators containing a 
single letter, a single number, a combination of two letters, or a combination of a 
letter and a number, indicating what to type to activate the command under 
them, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5
 
Follow these steps to access a command on a Ribbon tab using a KeyTip:
 1. 
Press the Alt key. The KeyTips appear over the Ribbon tabs. (Ignore the 
KeyTips that appear in the other areas of the user interface for this 
exercise.)
 2. 
Press the key that represents the KeyTip for the Ribbon tab that you want 
to access. For example, press N to select the Insert tab. Note that you do 
not have to hold down the Alt key. If you need to select a different tab 
after you select the KeyTip for a tab, press the Esc key.
 3. 
Press the key or key combination that represents the KeyTip for the 
command you want to use.
If the command you select is a drop-down gallery or drop-down grid, you can 
use an arrow key or the Tab key to highlight your choice and then press the 
Enter key to select your choice.
Remember: KeyTips are associated with in-Ribbon galleries, so you have to press 
the key that represents the KeyTip for the gallery before you can choose an 
option in the gallery.
Hiding the Ribbon commands
If you find that the Ribbon commands take up too much room in the Excel 
window, you can hide them using any of the following methods:

Introducing the Ribbon — Introducing the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)  13
 ✓ 
Click the Ribbon’s Minimize button in the Excel title bar (to the left of the 
help button)
 ✓ 
Press Ctrl+F1
 ✓ 
Double-click any Ribbon tab
 ✓ 
Right-click in the Ribbon area and choose Minimize the Ribbon from the 
contextual menu
After you hide the commands, only the Ribbon tabs are displayed. If you click a 
tab after you hide the Ribbon commands, Excel displays the tab commands 
temporarily. The commands are hidden again after you select a command in the 
tab or click away from the Ribbon area. Similarly, you can use KeyTips to select 
a command when the command display is hidden.
To redisplay the commands permanently after you hide them, use the same 
methods described for hiding the commands.
Remember: Excel maintains the hidden condition of the Ribbon commands if you 
exit and subsequently relaunch Excel.
Introducing the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)
The Quick Access toolbar (or QAT) is an area of the user interface that provides 
quick access to commands. The QAT is designed to reduce the amount of 
navigation you have to do in the Ribbon to access the features that you use 
frequently. The QAT is located at the top left of the Excel title bar, above the 
Ribbon tabs (see Figure 1-6).
Figure 1-6
 
The QAT contains three default commands (Save, Undo, and Redo); you can add 
additional commands.
Follow these steps to add a command to the QAT:
 1. 
Select the Ribbon tab that houses the command you want to add.
 2. 
Right-click the command and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar in the 
menu that appears.
 
 To quickly add some commonly used commands to the QAT, click the arrow to 
the right of the toolbar and choose a command from the menu.

14  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
 
You can add an entire Ribbon command group to the QAT. Just right-click an 
area in the command group name (for example, Font) and choose Add to Quick 
Access Toolbar.
Follow these steps to remove a command (including the default commands) 
from the toolbar:
 1. 
Right-click the command you want to remove from the toolbar.
 2. 
Choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar in the menu that appears.
 
 If you think you’ll be adding a lot of commands to the QAT, it’s a good idea to 
move the toolbar from the title bar to a separate location below the Ribbon. 
Right-click anywhere on the QAT and choose Place Quick Access Toolbar below 
the Ribbon in the menu that appears. You can regain screen area for working in 
the worksheet by hiding the Ribbon controls temporarily.
You can access commands on the Quick Access toolbar using the keyboard. 
Press the Alt key and then a number key that represents the KeyTip for the 
command you want to access. See also “Tipping off your keyboard,” earlier in 
this part.
Going Backstage

 Excel 2010 introduces a new view for working with documents called the 
Backstage view. This view is accessed by clicking the File tab on the Ribbon. 
See Figure 1-7.
The Backstage view consolidates all document management tasks, such as 
opening, closing, and sharing files; printing; and setting document properties. In 
previous versions of Excel, many of these tasks were scattered all over the user 
interface.
On the left side of Backstage view is a navigation pane that consists of a mix of 
quick command buttons (such as open, close, and save) and vertically aligned 
tabs (Info, Recent, New, Print, Send & Save, and Help). The buttons execute com-
mands directly, and the vertical tabs, like traditional horizontal tabs, expose a 
set of options. If you don’t have any workbooks currently open, some of the but-
tons and tabs will be disabled.
A distinguishing feature of Backstage view is that while you work in this view, 
no part of the worksheet is visible. Also, Excel minimizes the Ribbon (assuming 
that you haven’t previously minimized the Ribbon yourself). To return to the 
worksheet display view, click any Ribbon tab or press Esc.

Introducing the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) — Previewing Your Formatting Live  15
Figure 1-7
 
The Backstage navigation pane includes an Options button, which gives you 
access to various Excel options. We encourage you to visit the options from 
time to time because you may find useful application, workbook, or worksheet 
options that you want to turn on or off. An option in the Advanced tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box, for example, allows you to increase the number of 
documents displayed in the Recent Workbooks list to a maximum of 50. You’ll 
find a list of recent workbooks in the Backstage Recent tab.
Previewing Your Formatting Live
When you hover over a formatting option with the mouse pointer, Excel lets you 
see the effect that the formatting option will have on your selection before you 
commit to applying the option. This feature is called Live Preview. Your selection 
for Live Preview might be a cell, a range of cells, a chart, a table, a shape, and more.
Suppose that you want to change the font of some text in a cell. On the Ribbon, a 
drop-down box called the font picker presents a list of available fonts. As you 
hover over each choice in the font picker, your cell updates to show you what 
the text would look like if you chose that font. Live Preview avoids the normal 
tedium of committing to an option, then undoing the option because the result 

16  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
is not what you wanted, and then committing to another option, only to realize 
that you don’t like the new result either, and so on.
You find Live Preview options throughout Excel in places where formatting 
alternatives are available — most notably in galleries.
Remember: Live Preview formatting is not universal in Excel. Some elements 
provide formatting alternatives but do not have Live Preview support.
Formatting with Themes
In Excel, you can use a formatting concept known as a theme. A theme consists 
of a combination of fonts, colors, and effects that provide a consistent look 
among your workbook’s elements, including cells, charts, tables, and 
PivotTables. You apply the theme’s fonts, colors, and effects through individual 
options or the style galleries of the various elements.
Excel applies a default theme to all new workbooks along with a theme gallery 
so that you can change the default theme. After you select a new theme, all 
galleries and all the elements in your workbook formatted with theme styles 
change to match the new theme.
Following is a description of the three parts of a theme:
 ✓ 
Theme font: A theme uses two complementary fonts — a header font and 
a body font. All elements using themed styles use the same font or fonts. 
Click the arrow on the drop-down box (the font picker) on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab to see the fonts used in the theme currently applied to the 
workbook.
 ✓ 
Theme color: A theme uses a matched set of twelve colors. Click the arrow 
on the Fill Color or Font Color tool in the Font group of the Home tab to 
see ten of the colors used in the theme currently applied to the workbook 
(see Figure 1-8).
Figure 1-8
 

Previewing Your Formatting Live — Soliciting Help  17
 
 The following are characteristics of theme colors:
 • The top row in a color picker displays the base theme colors, and the 
next five rows display various tints and shades of the base colors. 
Below the theme colors are standard colors that do not change if the 
theme is changed. If you want to apply specific formatting that doesn’t 
change after you change the theme, use a standard color.
 • The first four columns of colors on the picker (from the left) are 
intended for text and background use. These colors are designed so 
that light text always shows well on a dark background, and vice versa.
 • The next six columns of colors are used for accents. Most of the theme-
style galleries in Excel make extensive use of accent colors.
 
 The two colors that are not displayed on the color pickers are used for 
hyperlinks (not discussed in this book).
 ✓ 
Theme effect: Theme effects apply to graphic elements such as charts and 
shapes and include three levels of styles for outlines, fills, and special 
effects. Special effects include shadow, glow, bevel, and reflection.
You can change the theme in a workbook by clicking the Themes button on the 
Ribbon’s Page Layout tab and selecting a new theme from the gallery that 
appears.
Remember: The Microsoft Office applications — Excel 2010, Word 2010, 
PowerPoint 2010, and Access 2010 — share the same themes. If you create 
reports that combine elements from each application, your reports will have a 
consistent look if you use a common theme.
Soliciting Help
With so many features and options available in Excel, it isn’t unusual to get 
stuck once in a while. Fortunately, Excel provides the following methods for 
getting help easily:
 ✓ 
SuperTips: Standard ScreenTips (also called ToolTips), which have been 
available in Excel (and many other Windows applications) for some time, 
provide textual context to commands. After hovering your mouse pointer 
over a command having a standard ScreenTip, Excel displays the action of 
the command using either a single word (such as Paste) or a brief phrase 
(such as Increase Font Size). A standard ScreenTip helps to decipher the 
meaning of a command button, for example, when the button has no asso-
ciated text and the command meaning is unclear from the button icon.

18  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
 
 SuperTips take the concept a step further by adding a short description 
explaining the purpose of the command. Some SuperTips include an 
explanatory graphic when a text description is insufficient to explain the 
meaning of the command. SuperTips are available for all commands on 
the Ribbon. In many cases, the SuperTip explanation provides enough 
information so you don’t have to seek additional help.
 ✓ 
Contextual help: If the SuperTip doesn’t offer enough for you to understand 
the use of a specific command, you can get more detailed help. After you 
hover the mouse pointer over the command, the SuperTip that pops up 
lets you know whether additional help for the command is available by 
indicating that you can press F1 for more help.
 
 If you are in a dialog box and need help for the dialog box options, click 
the help button on the dialog box’s title bar (the question mark) to get 
contextual help.
 ✓ 
General help: Click the help button (the question mark) on the right side 
of the Excel title bar or press F1 when you are not in a specific context 
(for example, the mouse pointer is not hovering over a command on the 
Ribbon) to display a list of general help topics.
 ✓ 
Backstage help: You can access additional help topics in Backstage view. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click the Help tab. The Help tab 
consolidates the following help components:
 • Support: This option provides various ways to get Excel help and 
troubleshoot issues.
 • Tools for Working with Office: In this section, you can access general 
Excel options or check online for product updates.
 • Product Licensing Status: This component displays the Office 2010 
products you are licensed to use on your computer, the applications 
included in each installed product suite, and the activation status of the 
products.
 • About Microsoft Excel: This component displays information that 
assists Microsoft Customer Service and Support in diagnosing any 
issues you are having with Excel. When you use contextual help or 
general help, Excel displays the help viewer, shown in Figure 1-9. The 
viewer sports Internet browser-style controls. In fact, it was built using 
the same technology that Microsoft uses in its Internet Explorer 
browser application. The viewer is not a full-fledged browser because 
you can view only Excel help content.

Soliciting Help  19
Figure 1-9
 
Although most of the options in the help viewer are self-explanatory, the 
following options require further discussion:
 ✓ 
Search box: You can enter specific search text in this box. The viewer 
stores a list of your text searches for the current help session. Click the 
drop-down arrow on the side of the box to view and select an item from 
the list if you want to review a previous search result.
 ✓ 
Search split button: Click the text part of the Search split button (or press 
Enter) to initiate a search after you enter the search text in the search box. 
Click the arrow part of the Search split button to define the search scope. 
By default, if your computer is connected to the Internet, Excel will display 
help content from an online source. If possible, you should use this source 
as your first choice because Microsoft updates the contents of online help 
regularly.

20  Part 1: Getting to Know Excel 2010
 
 If you’re offline when you initiate a search, Excel uses help content internal 
to your system. Whether online or offline, you can narrow your search 
scope further by selecting an appropriate option from the Search button 
menu.
 ✓ 
Status bar: The left side of the status bar (located at the bottom of the help 
viewer) displays the current search scope. On the right side of the status 
bar is a connection status button that displays the current connection 
status (online or offline). You can click this button to switch quickly 
between viewing online and offline help content.
 ✓ 
Pin button: By default, Excel keeps the help viewer window on top when 
you’re working in an application. Use the Pin button to control this 
behavior. If you “unpin” the viewer by clicking the button, Excel hides the 
window automatically if you click anywhere inside the Excel window.
 
 If you want to resize the help viewer window, move the mouse pointer to any 
edge of the window until the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, and 
then drag the mouse.

Managing Workbooks
Working with documents is critical to using any software. Microsoft Excel documents 
are known as workbooks. This part covers the procedures that you need to know to

22  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
Activating a Workbook
A workbook is active when its window is maximized in the Excel window or after 
you select any part of the workbook when its window is not maximized. See also 
“Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2010 Window,” in Part 1 and “Switching 
among Open Workbooks,” later in this part.
Arranging Windows Automatically
If you want all your open workbook windows visible on-screen, you can move 
and resize them manually — or you can have Excel do it automatically. Follow 
these steps to make all open workbooks visible on the Excel screen:
 
1. Click the View tab on the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Arrange All button. Excel displays the Arrange Windows dialog box.
 
3. Choose from the Tiled, Horizontal, Vertical, or Cascade options.
 4. 
Click OK.
See also “Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side,” later in this part.
Changing the Default File Location
When you’re opening a document in Excel, by default the Open dialog box 
points to the My Documents folder (Windows XP) or the Documents folder 
(Windows Vista and Windows 7) as the starting location to open documents. If 
you keep frequently used documents in a different folder, you may want the 
Open dialog box to point to this different folder to save some navigation steps. 
To change the default folder, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon, and then click the Options button. The 
Excel Options dialog box appears. The options are divided into vertically 
aligned tabs on the left side of the dialog box.
 2. 
Click the Save tab.
 3. 
In the Default File Location text box, enter the path of the new default start-
ing location to open documents. For example, if your new default document 
location is in a subfolder named Excel, which itself is in the My Documents 
or Documents folder, add \Excel to the default path. The new location in 
the text box should read C:\Users\Username\Documents\Excel, where 
Username is the name of the user indicated in the text box.
 4. 
Click OK.

Activating a Workbook — Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side  23
Closing a Workbook
If you’re no longer working with a workbook, you may want to close the 
workbook so that you can work on other documents without distraction. Closing 
unneeded workbooks also frees memory and minimizes potential screen clutter.
To close the unneeded workbook or workbooks, follow these steps:
 1. 
If multiple workbooks are open, ensure that the workbook you want to 
close is active as follows: Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the 
Switch Windows button, and select the workbook from the list of names in 
the menu.
 2. 
Use any of the following methods to close the workbook:
 • Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then choose Close.
 
 
• Click the Close button on the right side of the Excel title bar (or the 
right side of the workbook’s title bar if the workbook is not maximized).
 
 
• Double-click the Control button on the far left of the workbook’s title 
bar if the workbook is not maximized.
 • Press Ctrl+F4.
 • Press Ctrl+W.
If you’ve made any changes to your workbook since the last time you saved it, 
Excel asks whether you want to save the changes before closing the workbook.
Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side
Sometimes you have two versions of a workbook, and you want to compare the 
differences in the data visually. Excel provides a convenient feature that allows 
you to compare two documents side by side. To use this feature, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Open the workbooks you want to compare.
 
 2. 
Click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the View Side by Side 
button. Excel arranges the windows of the two workbooks horizontally. If 
you have more than two workbooks open, Excel displays a dialog box 
from which you select the name of the workbook you want to compare 
with the active workbook.
 3. 
Click a worksheet tab in each workbook to display the worksheet data you 
want to compare.

24  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
 
 4. 
In the View tab, click the Synchronous Scrolling button to toggle synchro-
nized scrolling on and off. After you enable synchronized scrolling, the 
rows and columns in the two worksheets being compared scroll 
simultaneously.
 
 5. 
You can click the Reset Window Position button on the View tab to ensure 
that the two workbook windows are sized equally and aligned horizontally. 
You need to use the button only if you adjust either or both window sizes 
during the current session.
Creating a New (Empty) Workbook
After you start Excel, it automatically creates a new (empty) workbook that it 
calls Book1. If you’re starting a new project from scratch, you can use this blank 
workbook.
You can create another blank workbook in the following ways:
 ✓ 
Press Ctrl+N.
 ✓ 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon, click the New tab in the Backstage 
navigation pane, and either double-click Blank Workbook in the Available 
Templates section or select Blank Workbook and click the Create button 
on the right side of window.
 
 You can add a button to the Quick Access toolbar (QAT) that allows you to 
create a blank workbook with a single mouse click. Click the arrow to the right 
of the QAT and choose New from the menu. Excel adds the New button to the 
toolbar. See also “Working with the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT),” in Part 1.
Creating Multiple Windows (Views) for a Workbook
Sometimes, you want to view two parts of the same worksheet at once. Or you 
want to see more than one sheet in the same workbook simultaneously. You can 
accomplish either action by displaying your workbook in one or more additional 
windows.
To create a new view of the active workbook, click the View tab on the Ribbon 
and then click the New Window button. Excel displays a new window for the 
active workbook. To help you keep track of the windows, Excel appends a colon 
and a number to the workbook name in each window, as shown in Figure 2-1.

Comparing Two Workbooks Side by Side — Opening Non-native Files  25
Figure 2-1
 
See also “Arranging Windows Automatically” and “Comparing Two Documents 
Side by Side,” both earlier in this part.
Remember: A single workbook can have as many views (that is, separate 
windows) as you want.
 
 Displaying multiple windows for a workbook also makes copying information 
from one worksheet to another easier. You can use Excel’s drag-and-drop 
procedures to copy a cell, a range, or a chart. See also “Copying Cells and 
Ranges,” in Part 4, and “Resizing, Moving, Copying, and Deleting an Embedded 
Chart,” in Part 10.
Opening Non-native Files
In addition to files in its native format, Excel can open files in non-native Excel 
2010 formats, including older Excel and text files. Excel can open files that 
weren’t saved in its native format by using filters to open the foreign file as a 
workbook document.
To open a file in a non-Excel 2010 format, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then choose Open. Excel displays the 
Open dialog box.
 2. 
Windows XP: In the Files of Type drop-down list, select the file type.
 
 Windows Vista and Windows 7: Click the button located above the Open 
and Cancel buttons and choose a file type from the menu. By default, the 
button text reads All Excel Files (*.xl*;*.xlsx;*.xlsm), but the text changes 
if you select a different file type.
 3. 
Windows XP: In the Look In drop-down list, navigate to the folder that 
contains the file.

26  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
 
 Windows Vista and Windows 7: In the Folders window on the left side of 
the dialog box, navigate to the folder that contains the document.
 4. 
Select the file and click Open, or double-click the filename.
See also “Opening a Workbook,” immediately following this section.
Opening a Workbook
If you open a workbook in Excel, the entire document loads into memory, and 
any changes that you make occur only in the copy that’s in memory. During the 
file open process, the workbook undergoes security checks. If Excel detects a 
potential security issue, it will open the workbook in one of two ways:
 ✓ 
After opening the workbook, a security warning message is displayed in 
the Message bar. Security warnings appear if Excel detects active content 
in the workbook. The most common active content you’re likely to encounter 
are macros, ActiveX components (a type of software code), and external 
data connections.
 ✓ 
Excel opens the workbook in protected mode. In protected mode, you can 
view but not edit the contents of the workbook (it’s read-only and all 
Ribbon controls are disabled). Also, Excel places the workbook in an 
isolated environment so that any malicious code present cannot get into 
your system and cause harm. In general, Excel opens the workbook in 
protected mode if it detects any the following conditions:
 • The workbook was downloaded from the Internet. Windows places a 
marker on a file you download from the Internet, identifying its source.
 • The workbook was opened from Outlook 2010.
 • The workbook was opened from an unsafe location, such as your 
Temporary Internet Files folder.
 • The workbook was blocked by Excel’s File Block policies.
 • The workbook fails file validation checks. Excel validates binary files 
(Excel files with an .xls or .xlt extension) against a well-known structure 
(called a schema). You can change Excel’s default handling of files with 
security issues by modifying settings in the Trust Center. See 
“Modifying security settings in the Trust Center,” later in this section.
Opening a workbook using the Open dialog box
To open a workbook, follow these steps:

Opening Non-native Files — Opening a Workbook  27
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then choose Open to display the 
Open dialog box. Alternatively, press Ctrl+O or Ctrl+F12 to display 
the Open dialog box.
 2. 
Windows XP: In the Look In drop-down list, navigate to the folder that 
contains the document.
 
 Windows Vista and Windows 7: In the Folders window on the left side of 
the dialog box, navigate to the folder that contains the document (see 
Figure 2-2).
 3. 
Select the workbook in the selected folder and click Open, or double-click 
the filename.
 
 
 You can select more than one document in the Open dialog box. Hold 
down Ctrl while you click each document. After you select all the 
documents you want, click Open.
Figure 2-2
 
 4. 
If the Message bar appears after the workbook opens, indicating that the 
workbook has security issues, do the following:
 • If the workbook opens in protected mode, click Enable Editing or click 
the Protected mode message to go to the Info tab in Backstage view. In 
Backstage view, you can enable editing or get details about the 
workbook.

28  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
 
 
 For most messages, the Message bar appears with an amber color. 
However, the bar appears in red after opening a file that fails validation. 
The color indicates an elevated security risk and the possibility that 
the file contains a malicious threat. You should therefore be sure 
about where the file originated before you enable editing.
 • If the security warning is due to active content in the workbook, click 
Enable Content on the Message bar or click the security warning 
message. If you click Enable Content, Excel enables the content and 
removes the warning message. If you instead click the security message, 
Excel takes you Backstage on the Info tab, where you can examine the 
type of active content in the workbook and enable each type individually 
(or not at all).
Remember:  If your workbook opens in protected mode and has active content, 
Excel displays the active content security warning after you enable editing.
Remember: After you enable editing or all content for a workbook, Excel 2010 will 
not display any security warning the next time you open the workbook.
Opening recently used workbooks
You can open a workbook you have worked on recently without navigating 
through the Open dialog box. In the navigation pane in Backstage view, click the 
Recent tab. On the Recent tab, Excel displays a list of recently used documents. 
If the document that you want to open appears in this list, you can open it by 
double-clicking its name.
By default, Excel places the last 20 documents you used in the recently used list. 
You can adjust this number in the Excel Options dialog box. Click Options in the 
Backstage navigation pane. In the Excel Options dialog box that appears, click 
the Advanced tab and scroll down to the Display section. In the Show This 
Number of Recent Documents spinner control, enter a number. The maximum 
number of documents you can have in the list is 50.
After you open more documents than are set to appear in the list, Excel removes 
documents from the list, beginning with the last document. If you want to keep a 
document permanently in the list, click the pushpin at the end of the document’s 
name. Click the pushpin again to unpin the document from the list. Right-click 
any document name to access additional options.

 You can place the top x (where x is a number) recently used documents directly 
in the Backstage navigation pane so you can access these documents quickly. 
To enable this feature, click the Recent tab in the Backstage navigation pane. At 
the very bottom of the recently used list area, select the box labeled Quickly 
Access This Number of Recent Workbooks. Enter the number of workbooks you 
want to appear on the navigation pane using the spinner control.

Opening a Workbook — Protecting and Unprotecting a Workbook  29
Modifying security settings in the Trust Center
Excel allows you to change its default handling of workbooks that have potential 
security issues. You make these changes in the Trust Center. You can access the 
Trust Center as follows:
 ✓ 
If the workbook opens in protected mode, click the message text that 
appears in the Message bar to go Backstage. In Backstage view, click the 
Protected Mode Settings link. Excel displays the Trust Center dialog box 
with the Protected View tab selected. You can enable and disable 
Protected mode settings in this tab.
 ✓ 
To access all Trust Center settings, click the File tab on the Ribbon and 
then click Options in the Backstage navigation pane. In the Excel Options 
dialog box, click the Trust Center tab and then click Trust Center Settings. 
Excel displays the Trust Center dialog box. Click the various tabs to review 
and alter settings as required.
Protecting and Unprotecting a Workbook
Excel provides several levels of protection for your work. Here are some ways 
you can protect your workbooks. You can protect
 
✓ A workbook from being opened by unauthorized personnel
 ✓ 
A workbook from being saved with the same filename
 ✓ 
A workbook’s structure (control the manipulation of worksheets in a 
workbook)
 ✓ 
A workbook’s windows (control the sizing and positioning of a workbook’s 
windows and any workbook views you create)
 
 You should write down any passwords you use and store them in a safe loca-
tion. If you forget or lose your passwords, you won’t be able to undo the areas 
you protected by any normal means.
Safeguarding your workbook from unauthorized users
Follow these steps to restrict unauthorized personnel from opening or modifying 
a workbook:
 1. 
Open a workbook or select an already opened workbook you want to protect.
 2. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click the Info tab.
 3. 
Click Protect Workbook and then choose Encrypt with Password from the 
menu. Excel displays the Encrypt Document dialog box.

30  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
 4. 
Enter a password. For a strong password that’s difficult for third-party 
tools to decrypt, use a minimum of eight characters consisting of 
uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (for 
example #, @, and !). However, don’t make the password so cryptic that 
it’s impossible to remember.
 5. 
Click OK. Excel asks you to reenter the password for confirmation.
 6. 
Reenter the password you entered in Step 4 and then click OK. In the 
Permissions section of the Info tab, Excel updates information about the 
protection status of the workbook.
To remove passwords from the workbook, follow the preceding steps, except 
delete the password in Step 4.
If you are using a workbook saved in an earlier version of Excel, Excel 2010 
displays a message offering to convert the workbook to the Office XML file 
format (the native file format) before you save the workbook with passwords. 
Excel offers this choice because the newer file format uses much stronger 
encryption than the older file format. You should choose to accept the suggestion 
only if you will not be sharing the workbook with users who use an Excel version 
earlier than Excel 2007. See also “Saving Files,” later in this part.
Protecting and unprotecting a workbook structure or window
To protect a workbook structure or window properties from accidental or 
intentional alteration, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the Review tab on the Ribbon, click the Protect Workbook button, 
and then choose Protect Structure and Windows from the menu. Excel 
displays the Protect Workbook dialog box.
 2. 
Select the appropriate check box(es), as follows:
 • Structure prevents any of the following changes to a workbook sheet: 
adding, deleting, moving, renaming, hiding, or unhiding.
 • Windows protects the workbook window from being moved or resized.
 3. 
If you need a high level of protection, supply a password in the Password 
text box and then click OK. When Excel requests that you reenter the 
password for confirmation, do so.
 4. 
Click OK.
To unprotect a workbook structure or window, click the Review tab on the 
Ribbon, click the Protect Workbook button, and then choose Protect Structure 
and Windows from the menu. If you did not supply a password when the work-
book was protected, Excel unprotects the workbook automatically. Otherwise, 
Excel prompts you to enter a password.

In Excel 2010, you can also protect the workbook structure or window from the 
Backstage view. Follow Steps 1 to 3 in the procedure outlined for “Safeguarding 
your workbook from unauthorized users,” but in Step 3, choose Protect 
Workbook Structure from the menu.
Recovering an Unsaved File
Sometimes while you’re working in a workbook, Excel crashes or the power fails. To 
handle these situations, Excel provides the AutoRecover feature. After you restart 
Excel following a program crash or power failure, Excel displays the Document 
Recovery pane to the left of the worksheet area. The Document Recovery pane lists 
all worksheets that were open at the time of the crash or outage.
The Document Recovery pane lists both the original version and the autosaved 
version of each file. The original version is the version you last saved. The 
autosaved version is the version last saved by AutoRecover. By default, 
AutoRecover saves a file in ten-minute intervals, if you make changes to the file.
The files listed in the Document Recovery pane include descriptions of the file 
status (original or autosaved). If you need to see more of the description, move 
the mouse pointer to the right side of the pane until the pointer changes to a 
double-headed arrow, and then drag to the right.
Click a file in the pane to open it. If you open the autosaved version and want it 
to replace the last version you saved, click the Save button in the Quick Access 
toolbar (QAT). To select a different option for the file (for example, to delete the 
file or save the file under a different name), hover the mouse pointer over the 
filename in the pane. When a drop-down arrow appears at the end of the filename, 
click the arrow and choose an option.
 
 You can change the default autosave interval and modify other AutoRecover 
settings. Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click Options in the Backstage 
navigation pane. In the Excel Options dialog box that appears, click the Save tab. 
On the Save tab, make the modifications you want.

 Excel 2010 saves a separate version of the workbook at each autosave interval. If 
for any reason you need to recover an older version of your working file, click 
the File tab on the Ribbon and then click the Info tab. To the right of the Manage 
Versions button, select the saved version you want to open.
Excel deletes all autosaved files for a workbook after four days or if you save 
and close the workbook.

 If you make changes to your workbook and attempt to close the file before 
saving the changes, Excel displays a message giving you the option to save or 
not save the file. In earlier versions of Excel, if you accidentally clicked the Don’t 
Save button when you really wanted to save the workbook, all your changes 

32  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
were lost. In Excel 2010, if you close the workbook without saving changes, Excel 
retains the last autosaved version of the workbook, so you can recover your 
changes up to the last time AutoRecover saved the workbook. To open this 
version of the workbook, go Backstage and select the file on the Recent tab. The 
file has the following added descriptive label: (when I closed without saving).

Excel 2010’s Backstage view consolidates all workbook properties, such as the 
workbook’s location, author, and title, and when the workbook was created and 
last modified.
Click the File tab on the Ribbon to go to the Backstage view, and then click the 
Info tab in the Backstage navigation pane if it isn’t already selected. At the top of 
the Info tab, Excel provides the full file path of the workbook. You can explore 
the options available for Permissions, Prepare for Sharing, and Versions by 
clicking the appropriate button and choosing an option from the menu.
The right side of the tab contains the following document-related categories:
 ✓ 
Properties: Displays a list of document information, most of which you can 
change by clicking the text box next to the property name. For example, to 
add a title, click the text that displays Add a title. Clicking the text exposes 
a text box in which you can enter a title. Click the Show All Properties link 
to display additional options.
 ✓ 
Related Dates: Displays a list of dates related to the document — the 
create date, the date last modified, and the date last printed.
 ✓ 
Related People: Displays a list of one or more authors who contributed to 
the document and the person who last modified the file. You can add a 
person to the list of authors. If other authors are in your Contacts list, you 
can click an author’s name and select a contact method, if you need to 
contact the author.
 ✓ 
Related Documents: Click the Open File Location button if you want to 
open other workbooks stored in the same location as the active workbook.
Saving Workbooks
When you save a workbook, Excel saves the copy in memory to your drive — 
overwriting the previous copy of the workbook. When you save a workbook for 
the first time, Excel displays its Save As dialog box.

Recovering an Unsaved File — Saving Workbooks  33
Excel 2010’s native file format is based on a standard called Open XML 
(eXtensible Markup Language). XML is a text-based file format — older versions 
of Excel (before Excel 2007) used a binary file format.
You don’t need to have knowledge of XML or Open XML to work in Excel. 
However, it is useful to know that Excel 2010, like earlier versions, saves files with 
a different file extension depending on the type of file you’re saving. A list of 
typical file types and the extension names they use are in the following table. We 
also include the corresponding file extensions used in earlier versions of Excel.
File Type
2007+ Extension
Pre-2007 Extension
Excel workbook native format
.xlsx
.xls
Excel macro-enabled workbook
.xlsm
.xls
Excel workbook template
.xltx
.xlt
Excel macro-enabled workbook template
.xltm
.xlt
Excel binary workbook
.xlsb
.xls
Excel add-in
.xlam
.xla
Remember: Unlike earlier versions of Excel, Excel 2007 or later version workbooks 
or templates containing macros (scripts written to enhance Excel in some 
manner) are stored in files that differ from files without macros. If you attempt 
to save a macro-based workbook or template in a format that doesn’t support 
macros (.xlsx or .xltx), Excel gives you the option to save the file without macros 
or to select a format that supports macros (.xlsm or .xltm).
Saving a workbook
Use any of the following methods to save the active workbook:
 ✓ 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click Save.
 
 ✓ 
Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar.
  
✓ Press Ctrl+S.
 ✓ 
Press Shift+F12.
If the document you’re saving does not yet have a name, Excel prompts you for 
a name by opening its Save As dialog box. You can give the document a name 
and navigate to the folder where you want to store the file. See also “Saving a 
workbook under a different name,” in the next section.
Saving a workbook under a different name
Sometimes you may want to keep multiple versions of your work by saving each 
successive version under a different name.

34  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
To save a workbook with a different name, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click Save As. Excel displays the 
Save As dialog box.
 2. 
Windows XP: In the Save In drop-down list, select the folder in which to 
save the workbook.
 
 Windows Vista and Windows 7: Select the folder in which to save the 
workbook (see Figure 2-3).
 3. 
In the File Name text box, enter a new filename. (You don’t need to include 
a file extension.)
 4. 
Click Save.
Figure 2-3
 
Excel creates a new copy of the workbook with a different name, but the original 
version of the workbook remains intact. (Note that the original workbook is no 
longer open.)
Saving a workbook in a non-native file format
To share a workbook with someone who uses an application that opens files in a 
format other than Excel 2010’s native format, be sure to save the workbook in a 
file format that the other application can read.
Excel can save workbook contents in many non-Excel file formats, such as tab- or 
comma-delimited text, html, and standard xml.
To save a workbook in a different file format, follow these steps:

Saving Workbooks — Switching among Open Workbooks  35
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click Save As. Excel displays the 
Save As dialog box.
 2. 
In the Save As Type drop-down list, select the format in which you want to 
save the file. For example, to save in an earlier Excel file format, select 
Excel 97-2003 Workbook.
 3. 
Click Save.
See also “Sharing Workbooks,” next in this part.
Remember: If you attempt to save a workbook with features not supported in the 
file format you’re saving to, Excel displays a warning message. If the format 
you’re saving to is an earlier version of Excel, Excel displays the Compatibility 
Checker dialog box, which shows you a list of features that will be lost.
Sharing Workbooks
After you create and save a workbook you may want to share the workbook. If 
you’re sharing the workbook with others in your internal computer network, 
you can simply save the file to a shared server folder with appropriate 
permissions set for users accessing the file.
Excel provides other methods to share a workbook, such as e-mailing it or 
saving it to SharePoint. Follow these steps to share a workbook:
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click the Save & Send tab in the 
Backstage navigation pane. The Save & Send tab contains additional tabs 
arranged in two categories: Save & Send and File Types. File Types provides a 
convenient list of common file types to which you can save your workbook 
before sharing.
 2. 
Click a tab in the Save & Send category and select an option on the tab. For 
example, if you want to e-mail a file, click the Send Using E-mail tab and 
then click an e-mail option on the right side of the tab.
Switching among Open Workbooks
If you have multiple workbooks open, they usually appear maximized on-screen 
so that you can view only one workbook at a time.
To switch the active display among workbooks, use one of the following methods:
 ✓ 
Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Switch Windows button, and 
then select one of the workbook names on the menu that appears.

36  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
 ✓ 
Press Ctrl+F6 or Ctrl+Tab to cycle the active display among the open 
workbooks.
Working with Workbook Templates
A workbook template is basically a workbook that contains one or more 
worksheets set up with formatting and formulas and ready for you to enter data 
and get immediate results. A workbook template can use any of Excel’s features, 
such as charts, formulas, and macros. Excel includes templates that automate 
the common tasks of filling in invoices, expense statements, and purchase 
orders. You can also download more templates from the Internet. You can also 
create your own templates from scratch or from an existing workbook.
Creating a workbook template
To save a workbook as a template, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click Save As. Excel displays the 
Save As dialog box.
 2. 
In the Save As Type drop-down list, select Excel Template.
 3. 
If you want to save the template in a subfolder of the Templates folder in 
Windows XP: Excel displays the Templates folder in the Save In drop-
down list. Select the subfolder in the Save In drop-down list.
 
 If you want to save the template in a subfolder of the Templates folder in 
Windows Vista or Windows 7: After you complete Step 2, Excel displays 
the Templates folder. Select a subfolder in the Templates folder.
 
 
 If you select a subfolder in the Templates folder, it should be a subfolder 
that you’ve previously created. If you save the template in an Excel 
installed subfolder, the template will not appear when you want to create 
a workbook from the template.
 
 To create a new folder in the Templates folder in which you can save the 
template, click the Create New Folder button (or the New Folder button) 
in the Save As dialog box and give the new folder a name.
 4. 
In the File Name box, enter a name for the template, and then click Save. 
Excel saves templates with an .xltx file extension. If your template con-
tains macros, Excel gives you the option to save the template without 
macros or to save in a format that supports macros (.xltm). See also 
“Saving Files,” earlier in this part.

Switching among Open Workbooks — Working with Workbook Templates  37
You can also save a template in an earlier file format. In Step 2, select Excel 
97-2003 Template from the Save As Type drop-down list box.
 
 To prevent overwriting the template file when you create a new workbook from 
a template, always save your templates in the Templates folder or a subfolder 
you create within the Templates folder. See also “Creating a workbook from a 
template,” next.
Creating a workbook from a template
If you create a new workbook that you based on a template, Excel creates a copy 
of the template in memory so that the original template, on disk, remains intact. 
The default workbook name is the template name with a number appended to it. 
For example, if you create a new workbook based on a template by the name of 
Report.xltx, the workbook default name is Report1.xlsx. The first time that you 
save a workbook that you create from a template, Excel displays the Save As 
dialog box so that you can give the file a meaningful name.
To create a workbook from a template, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then click the New tab in the 
Backstage navigation pane. See Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4
 

38  Part 2: Managing Workbooks
 2. 
Select a template option on the New tab. The New tab is divided into two 
sections. The top section is for templates on your local computer, and the 
bottom section is for templates located at Office.com. The options in the 
top area are as follows:
 • Recent templates: Click the Recent templates button to display your 
recently used templates. If you have not yet created any templates, the 
list will be empty. Select a template and click Create to open a copy of 
the template file.
 • Sample templates: These are templates that are in your system when 
you install Excel. Click the Sample templates button to display a list of 
sample templates. Select a template and click Create to open a copy of 
the template.
 • My templates: These are templates you previously saved in the 
Templates folder or in a subfolder you create in the Templates folder. 
Click My templates to display the New dialog box. Templates you saved 
in the Templates folder appear in the Personal Templates tab. If you 
saved Templates in one or more subfolders that you previously created 
in the Templates folder, the folder names appear as tabs in the New 
dialog box. Select a template from a tab and click OK. Excel opens a 
copy of the template.
 • New from existing: This option allows you to use any workbook as a 
template or to use a template file that’s not in the Templates folder. 
Click New from Existing to display the New from Existing Workbook 
dialog box. Navigate to the folder containing the file you want to use as 
a template, select the file in the folder, and click Create New. Excel 
opens a copy of the file.
 
 If you’re connected to the Internet, you can select from one of the online 
categories at the bottom of the New tab. Click a template or click a folder 
and then click a template within the folder, click Download (or double-
click the template), and Excel opens a copy of the template.
 3. 
Save the workbook after you enter the appropriate data in the template 
copy. See also “Saving Workbooks” and “Creating a workbook template,” 
earlier in this part.

Working with Worksheets
A workbook can consist of any number of worksheets. Each sheet has a tab that 
appears at the bottom of the workbook window. In this part, we discuss several 
useful things that you can do with worksheets.

40  Part 3: Working with Worksheets
Activating a Worksheet
Before you can do any work in a worksheet, you must first activate it. To activate 
a worksheet, just click its tab. If the tab for the sheet that you want to activate 
isn’t visible, use the tab scrolling buttons to scroll the sheet tabs. Figure 3-1 
shows how Excel highlights the active sheet. You also can use the following 
shortcut keys to activate a different sheet:
 ✓ 
Ctrl+PgUp: Activates the previous sheet, if you have one.
 ✓ 
Ctrl+PgDn: Activates the next sheet, if you have one.
Figure 3-1
 Tab scrolling buttons
Active worksheet highlighted
Adding a New Worksheet
You can add a new worksheet to a workbook in the following ways:
 
 ✓ 
Click the Insert Worksheet tab button, which is located after the last 
worksheet tab in the workbook.
 ✓ 
Right-click any sheet tab, choose Insert from the menu, and click 
Worksheet in the Insert dialog box. Click OK to insert the new worksheet.
 ✓ 
On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the arrow portion of the Insert button, 
and then choose Insert Sheet from the menu.
 ✓ 
Press Shift+F11.
In each case, Excel inserts a new worksheet and it becomes the active worksheet. 
The default name that Excel gives to the worksheet is the word Sheet, followed 
by a number (for example, Sheet1, Sheet2, and so on).
Changing a Worksheet’s Name
By default, Excel names its worksheets Sheet1, Sheet2, and so on. Providing more 
meaningful names helps you identify a particular sheet. To change a sheet’s name:

Activating a Worksheet — Copying or Moving a Worksheet  41
 1. 
 Double-click the sheet tab, or right-click the sheet tab and choose Rename 
from the menu that appears. Either method selects the text in the tab.
 2. 
Type the new sheet name directly on the tab.
Remember: Sheet names can be up to 31 characters long. Names can include 
spaces but not the following characters: [ ] (brackets); : (colon); / (slash); \ 
(backslash); ? (question mark); and * (asterisk).
Coloring a Worksheet Tab
Excel lets you to add color to a worksheet tab. You can use this feature, for 
example, to quickly identify a specific worksheet by its color. To color a 
worksheet tab, follow these steps:
 1. 
Right-click the sheet tab, and choose Tab Color from the menu that appears.
 2. 
Select a color for the tab from the color picker that appears.
To undo the tab color, follow the same procedure, but in Step 2, click the No 
Color option in the color picker.
Remember: If you select a tab that you have color-coded, the tab color changes 
to a gradient fill, with a very light fill behind the sheet name. If a tab is fully 
colored, it’s not currently selected.
Copying or Moving a Worksheet
Sometimes, you may want to rearrange the order of worksheets in a workbook, 
copy a worksheet within the same workbook or to a different workbook, or 
move a sheet to a different workbook. The procedures for copying and moving a 
worksheet are similar.
You can copy or move a worksheet in any of the following ways:
 ✓ 
Copy or move using a dialog box: Right-click the worksheet tab and 
choose Move or Copy from the menu that appears. Excel opens the Move 
or Copy dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-2. Select the location for the copy 
or move in the To Book drop-down list (to copy or move the sheet to a 
new or other open workbook) or the Before Sheet list box, or both. To 
move the sheet, deselect the Create a Copy check box, and click OK. To 
copy the sheet, select the Create a Copy check box, and click OK.

42  Part 3: Working with Worksheets
 ✓ 
Copy using drag and drop: Click the worksheet tab, press Ctrl, and drag 
the sheet to the desired location in the workbook. As you drag, the mouse 
pointer changes to a small sheet with a plus sign on it, and a small arrow 
guides you. To use this method to copy a worksheet to another open 
workbook, you must first arrange the workbooks. See “Arranging Windows 
Automatically,” in Part 2.
 ✓ 
Move using drag and drop: Click the sheet tab, and drag the sheet to its 
desired location in the workbook. As you drag, the mouse pointer changes to 
a small sheet, and a small arrow guides you. To use this method to move a 
worksheet to another open workbook, you must first arrange the workbooks.
Figure 3-2
 
Remember: To copy or move a worksheet to a different workbook using any of 
the methods described, both workbooks must be open.
Remember: After you copy or move a worksheet (the source worksheet) to a 
different workbook, any defined names and custom formats used in the worksheet 
are copied to the new workbook. If one or more name conflicts exist between 
the destination workbook and the source worksheet, Excel may display a message 
giving you the option to either use the name(s) in the destination workbook or 
change the name(s) used in the source worksheet. You don’t have the choice to 
use the name(s) in the source worksheet.
See also “Creating Names,” in Part 6.
Deleting a Worksheet
To delete a worksheet, right-click the sheet tab and choose Delete from the 
menu that appears. If the sheet you want to delete contains data (or if you 
delete all the data on a sheet in the current session), Excel asks you to confirm 
the fact that you want to delete the sheet. Every workbook must contain at least 
one sheet, so if you try to delete the only sheet, Excel complains.

Copying or Moving a Worksheet — Freezing Row or Column Titles  43
 
To select multiple sheets to delete, press Ctrl while clicking the sheet tabs that 
you want to delete. To select a group of contiguous sheets, click the first sheet 
tab, press Shift, and then click the last sheet tab.
 
 After you delete a worksheet, it’s gone for good. This operation is one of the few 
in Excel that you can’t undo. Therefore, you may want to save a workbook 
before deleting worksheets. Then, if you inadvertently delete a worksheet, you 
can revert to the saved version.
Freezing Row or Column Titles
Many worksheets are set up with row and column headings. As you scroll 
through such worksheets, you can easily get lost after the row and column 
headings scroll out of view. Excel provides a handy solution to alleviate this 
problem: you can freeze the rows and columns.
To freeze entire rows or columns, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer to the cell below the row that you want to freeze and 
to the right of the column that you want to freeze. Use the following steps 
to freeze various portions of the worksheet:
 • To freeze row 1 and column A, for example, move the cell pointer to cell B2.
 • To freeze rows only, move the cell pointer below the rows that you 
want to freeze in column A.
 • To freeze columns only, move the cell pointer to the right of the 
columns that you want to freeze in row 1.
 2. 
Click the View tab on the Ribbon.
 3. 
Click the Freeze Panes button and choose Freeze Panes from the menu. 
Excel inserts dark lines in the worksheet to indicate the frozen rows and 
columns. These frozen rows and columns remain visible as you scroll 
throughout the worksheet.
To unfreeze the frozen rows or columns, repeat Steps 2 and 3, but in Step 3, 
choose Unfreeze Panes from the menu. See also “Splitting Panes,” later in this part.
 
 You can quickly freeze the top row or left column by clicking the View tab on the 
Ribbon, clicking the Freeze Panes button, and choosing either Freeze Top Row or 
Freeze First Column from the menu. These options are useful because data is 
often stored in worksheets with labels in the top row, or the first column, or both. 
Note that the cell pointer can be in any location when you select these options.
 
 An alternative to freezing row and column titles is to convert the range to a 
table. When table headers scroll off the sheet, Excel displays the header titles in 
the column header area. See Part 11, “Working with Tables.”

44  Part 3: Working with Worksheets
Grouping and Ungrouping Worksheets
Excel allows you to group multiple worksheets so that you can perform tasks on 
all the sheets in the group simultaneously. For example, you can group sheets to 
print, you can apply formatting to a given range in all the sheets in a group, or 
you can enter data into the same cell or range in all the sheets in the group. Any 
modifications you make to one sheet in the group are applied to the other 
sheets in the group.
Grouping worksheets
If the sheets you want to group are contiguous (adjacent), follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the tab of the first sheet by clicking it.
 2. 
Press and hold down the Shift key and select the tab of the last sheet. 
Excel selects all the sheets between the first and last, inclusive.
If the sheets you want to group are not contiguous, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the tab of the first sheet by clicking it.
 2. 
Press and hold down the Ctrl key and click the tabs of the other sheets in 
turn.
Remember: You can’t switch among sheets in a group if all the sheets in the 
workbook are grouped. In this case, clicking any inactive sheet tab (any sheet 
tab with the name not highlighted) ungroups all the worksheets.
 
 If you need to group and switch among all your existing worksheets in the 
workbook, add a new (blank) worksheet first. See also “Adding a New 
Worksheet,” earlier in this part.
Ungrouping worksheets
You can use any of the following methods to ungroup worksheets. The first 
three methods ungroup all worksheets; the last ungroups only an inactive sheet.
 ✓ 
Click any unselected sheet tab to ungroup all worksheets.
 ✓ 
Press and hold down the Shift key and click the active sheet tab (the sheet 
tab with the highlighted name) to ungroup all worksheets.
 ✓ 
If all the sheets in the workbook are grouped, click any inactive sheet tab 
to ungroup all worksheets.
 ✓ 
Press and hold down the Ctrl key and click an inactive sheet tab in the 
group to ungroup only that worksheet.

Grouping and Ungrouping Worksheets — Protecting a Worksheet  45
Hiding and Unhiding a Worksheet
Hiding a worksheet is useful if you don’t want others to see it or if you just want 
to get it out of the way. If a sheet is hidden, its sheet tab is also hidden.
To hide a worksheet, right-click the worksheet tab and choose Hide from the 
contextual menu.
You can select multiple sheets to hide at once. If the sheets you want to hide are 
contiguous, click the first sheet, press and hold down Shift, and click the last 
sheet. If the sheets are noncontiguous, click the first sheet, press and hold down 
Ctrl, and click the other sheets in succession.
Remember: Every workbook must have at least one visible sheet, so Excel 
doesn’t allow you to hide all sheets in a workbook.
To unhide a hidden worksheet, follow these steps:
 1. 
Right-click any visible sheet tab and click Unhide from the contextual 
menu, or click the View tab on the Ribbon and click the Unhide button. 
Excel displays the Unhide dialog box.
 2. 
Select the sheet that you want to unhide and click OK. You can unhide 
only one sheet at a time.
 
 To prevent someone from unhiding a worksheet, you can protect the workbook. 
See “Protecting and unprotecting a workbook structure or window,” in Part 2.
Protecting a Worksheet
Deleting a single formula in a worksheet often creates a ripple effect, causing 
other formulas to produce an error value or, even worse, incorrect results. You 
can circumvent such problems by locking the cells that you don’t want to be 
modified and then protecting your worksheets from modification. Follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Right-click the tab of the worksheet you want to protect and choose 
Protect Sheet from the contextual menu, or click the Review tab on the 
Ribbon and click the Protect Sheet button. The Protect Sheet dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.

46  Part 3: Working with Worksheets
Figure 3-3
 
 2. 
Provide a password in the Protect Sheet dialog box, if you want.
 • If you enter a password, you must reenter the password before the 
sheet can be unprotected.
 • If you don’t supply a password, anyone can unprotect the sheet.
 3. 
In the Allow All Users of This Worksheet To list box, click the appropriate 
check boxes to select the elements that users can change after the sheet 
is protected.
 4. 
Click OK.
Remember: By default, the locked property is turned on for all cells and objects, 
which means that they are locked when you protect the worksheet. Before 
protecting a worksheet, you normally want to unlock the input cells (the cells in 
which you enter data). To lock or unlock cells, first select them, and then right-click 
and choose Format Cells from the contextual menu; then check or uncheck the Lock 
check box on the Protection tab. See also “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” in Part 4.
To remove protection from a protected sheet, right-click the worksheet you 
want to unprotect and choose Unprotect Sheet from the contextual menu, or 
click the Review tab on the Ribbon and click the Unprotect Sheet button. If the 
sheet was protected with a password, you have to enter the password before 
you can unprotect the sheet.
Splitting Panes
Splitting an Excel window into two or four panes enables you to view multiple 
parts of the same worksheet. Some of the key features of splitting panes are as 
follows:
 
 ✓ 
Clicking the View tab on the Ribbon and then clicking the Split button 
splits the active worksheet into two or four separate panes.

Protecting a Worksheet — Turning Off Gridlines  47
 ✓ 
The split occurs at the location of the cell pointer.
 ✓ 
You can use the mouse to drag and resize the pane.
 ✓ 
To remove the split panes, click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click 
the Split button.
 
 A faster way to split and unsplit panes is to drag the vertical or horizontal split 
bar, as shown in Figure 3-4. These split bars are standard elements of the Excel 
window and are located above and to the right of the vertical and horizontal 
scroll bars, respectively. To remove split panes by using the mouse, drag the 
pane separator all the way to the edge of the window or just double-click it.
Figure 3-4
 
See also “Freezing Row or Column Titles,” earlier in this part.
Turning Off Gridlines
Sometimes you’re working with data to which you’ve applied a number of 
formatting options, but you find the worksheet gridlines distracting. To turn off 
the gridline display, click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click to clear the 
Gridlines check box.
Remember: Whether or not you have the gridline display turned on, gridlines 
aren’t printed unless you select that option in the Sheet Options group on the 
Ribbon’s Page Layout tab. See also “Printing gridlines or row and column 
headings,” in Part 9.

48  Part 3: Working with Worksheets
Using Full-Screen View
If you want to see as much information as possible in a worksheet, you can hide 
the Ribbon controls or choose a full-screen view:
 ✓ 
See “Hiding the Ribbon commands,” in Part 1.
 ✓ 
Click the View tab on the Ribbon and then click the Full Screen button. The 
Ribbon and its tabs, the Quick Access toolbar, the formula bar, and the 
status bar all disappear. Press Esc to restore the hidden elements.
Zooming a Worksheet
Excel enables you to scale the size of your worksheets from 10 percent to 400 
percent. Using a low zoom percentage can help you get a bird’s-eye view of your 
worksheet to see its layout. A high zoom percentage can help you decipher very 
small text.
The easiest way to change the zoom factor of the active worksheet is to use the 
zoom control at the bottom right of the status bar (see Figure 3-5). You can drag 
the slider to zoom in and out or you can click the Zoom in (+) or Zoom out (–) 
buttons to change the view by 10 percent (per each click). The button on the 
immediate left of the Zoom out button displays the current zoom percentage. 
Clicking this button displays the Zoom dialog box. (You can open the Zoom 
dialog box also by clicking the View tab on the Ribbon and then clicking the 
Zoom button.)
Figure 3-5
 
 
 The Zoom dialog box is useful if you want to use a precise zoom level (by 
entering a value in the custom box) or zoom a selection — for example, a 
selected range of cells or chart, to fit the worksheet window (by selecting the 
Fit Selection option).
 
 If you have a Microsoft IntelliMouse or equivalent device (generally, any mouse 
with a scroll wheel), you can zoom in or out in a worksheet by pressing Ctrl 
while you roll the mouse wheel. If this feature is not working, make sure that the 
Zoom on Roll with IntelliMouse option is selected in the Excel Options dialog 
box. (Click the File tab and then click the Options button. Click the Advanced 
category, and in the Editing Options section, select the Zoom on Roll with 
IntelliMouse check box.)

Entering and Editing 
Worksheet Data
This part deals with two of the most common tasks you’re likely to perform on a daily 
basis in Excel: entering data into worksheet cells and editing (or changing) the data after 
you enter it. Excel provides many handy tools to make these tasks painless and efficient.

50  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
Copying Cells and Ranges
Copying cells is a common spreadsheet operation, and several types of copying 
are possible. You can do any of the following:
 ✓ 
Copy one cell to another cell.
 ✓ 
Copy a cell to a range of cells. Excel copies the source cell to every cell in 
the destination range.
 ✓ 
Copy a range to another range.
 ✓ 
Copy multiple cells or ranges to another range.
A copy procedure is really a combination of two operations: a copy operation, 
which copies the cell contents to the Windows Clipboard, followed by a paste 
operation, which places the contents of the Clipboard into the destination cell 
or range.
When you paste the contents of the Clipboard to the destination cell or range, 
Excel provides you with several paste options. For example, you can paste all 
contents, formulas, formatting, and comments (if any) that were applied to the 
original cell or range (this is the default paste operation). Alternatively, you can 
select from among different combinations of formula, value, and formatting 
options.

 Excel 2010 introduces a new Paste Options gallery, which replaces the textual 
paste options list in earlier versions of the product. The gallery consists of a 
series of icons, each of which represents one or more combinations of paste 
options. The gallery shows up in three locations — under the Paste button on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab, in the right-click contextual menu, and in the Paste 
Options Smart Tag. See Figure 4-1.
Like many other features in Excel 2010, the Paste Options gallery provides a live 
preview — you can hover the mouse cursor over a paste option to see what the 
results will be before committing to an option.
Copying a cell to another cell or a range
To copy the contents of one cell to a range of cells, follow these steps:

 2. 
Click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press 
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
 3. 
Select the cell or range that you want to hold the copy (the destination 
cell or range).
 
 4. 
To select the default paste operation, click the top part of the Paste split 
button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+V or 
right-click the destination cell or range and choose the leftmost icon 
immediately below the Paste Options label on the contextual menu.
 
 To select another paste option, click the arrow part of the Paste split 
button, and hover the mouse cursor over the icons in the gallery to 
preview your choices. In addition to the live preview, Excel displays a 
ScreenTip for each icon that provides descriptive text to help you with 
your choice.
 
 As an alternative to using the Paste button on the Ribbon to select 
another paste option, you can right-click the destination cell or range and 
hover over the available choices in the contextual menu. The menu displays 
the most common paste options. To view additional choices, select Paste 
Special and hover over the options in the flyout gallery.

52  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 5. 
After you make a selection, Excel displays the Paste Options Smart Tag next 
to the copied range. Clicking the Smart Tag, or pressing Ctrl, displays a 
gallery of alternative paste options, as shown in Figure 4-1. The Smart Tag 
options are handy if you want to change your paste option after the fact.
 
 If you don’t need to change your paste option, you can press Enter or Esc 
to dismiss the Smart Tag.
 
 If the range you’re copying to is adjacent to the cell you’re copying from, you 
can drag the cell’s AutoFill handle to copy the cell to the adjacent range. Note, 
however, that Excel provides far fewer paste options if you use the AutoFill 
method. See “Filling a Series,” later in this part.
Copying a range to another range
To copy the contents of one range to another range of the same size, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
Select the range that you want to copy.
 
 2. 
Click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+C 
or right-click the range and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
 3. 
Select only the upper-left cell of the range that you want to use to hold 
the copy.
 
 4. 
Complete Steps 4 and 5 in the section “Copying a cell to another cell or a 
range,” immediately preceding in this part.
 
 If you intend to use the default paste option and you decide that the location 
you’re copying to isn’t too far away, you can follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range to copy.
 2. 
Press and hold down Ctrl.
 3. 
Move the mouse pointer to any of the selection’s borders. The mouse 
pointer changes to an arrow with a small plus sign.
 4. 
Drag the mouse to the location where you want to copy the cell or range. 
Excel displays an outline of the range as you drag with the mouse to help 
you see where you’re going to paste the range.
 5. 
Release the mouse button. Excel copies the cell or range to the new location.
Remember: If the mouse pointer doesn’t change to an arrow in Step 3, your drag-
and-drop feature is off. To turn on the drag-and-drop feature, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab and then click the Options button.
 2. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Advanced category.

To prevent accidental overwriting of data in the destination range, select 
the Alert before Overwriting Cells check box.
 5. 
Click OK.
Copying data to another worksheet or workbook
To copy the contents of a cell or range to another worksheet or workbook, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range that you want to copy.
 
 2. 
Click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+C 
or right-click the cell or range and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
 3. 
Click the tab of the worksheet that you’re copying to. If the worksheet is 
in a different workbook, activate that workbook (by clicking the View tab 
on the Ribbon, clicking the Switch Windows button, and selecting the 
workbook name from the menu) and then click the tab of the worksheet 
that will hold the copied data.
 4. 
Select only the upper-left cell of the range that will hold the copy.
 
 5. 
Complete Steps 4 and 5 in the section “Copying a cell to another cell or a 
range,” earlier in this part.
Copying multiple cells or ranges to another range
To copy noncontiguous cells or ranges to a single range elsewhere in the work-
sheet, to a different worksheet in the same workbook, or to a range in a different 
workbook, you can copy and paste each cell or range in turn to the new range. 
However, Excel provides a simpler and less tedious method to perform this mul-
tiple-copy task. This method uses the Office Clipboard to copy multiple data 
items before pasting the items. The Office Clipboard differs from the Windows 
Clipboard in that the Windows Clipboard can store data from a single copy oper-
ation at a time.
The Office Clipboard can store 24 copied items. All Office applications share a 
single Office Clipboard, enabling you to cut and paste multiple items between 
Excel and other Office applications, such as Word and PowerPoint.
To copy multiple cells or ranges to another range, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the Home tab on the Ribbon if it isn’t already selected and click the 
Clipboard group dialog launcher button, located on the bottom right of 
the group container. Excel displays the Clipboard task pane, as shown in 
Figure 4-2.

54  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
Figure 4-2
 
 2. 
Select the first cell or range that you want to copy. (See “Selecting Cells 
and Ranges,” later in this part.)
 3. 
Click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press 
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell or range and choose Copy from the contextual 
menu.) Excel copies the data to the Office Clipboard. The Clipboard task 
pane displays all or a portion of the copied data.
 4. 
Select the next cell or range that you want to copy. (The cell or range can 
be from the same worksheet, another worksheet in the same workbook, or 
a worksheet in another open workbook.)
 5. 
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for all the remaining data that you want to copy.
 6. 
Select the upper-left cell of the range that will hold the copied items.
 7. 
Click the Paste All button in the Clipboard task pane. You can also click 
individual items in the Clipboard task pane to paste a single item at a time.
 
 You can enable the Office Clipboard by setting the Clipboard task pane to 
appear automatically after the second use of the Copy command. This option, if 
set, eliminates Steps 1 and 2. To turn on this option, click the Options button at 
the bottom of the Clipboard task pane and select the Show Office Clipboard 
Automatically option.
 
 Normally, you need to display the Clipboard task pane to enable the Office 
Clipboard. If you prefer to use the Office Clipboard without displaying the 
Clipboard task pane, click the Options button at the bottom of the Clipboard 
task pane and select the Collect Without Showing Office Clipboard option.
Remember: You can use the Office Clipboard for multiple cut operations in 
addition to the multiple copy operations that we discuss in this section.

Copying Cells and Ranges — Editing the Contents of a Cell  55
Deleting Entire Rows and Columns
In certain circumstances, you may want to delete entire rows or columns from 
your worksheet. If you delete a row(s), the rows below the deleted row(s) shift 
upward to fill the gap. If you delete a column(s), the columns to the right of the 
deleted column(s) shift to the left to fill the gap.
To delete entire rows or columns, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the row header or column header of the row or column you want to 
delete. See “Selecting entire rows and columns,” later in this part. Excel 
selects the entire row or column.
 2. 
Use any of the following methods to delete the row or column:
 • Right-click the selected row or column and choose Delete from the con-
textual menu.
 • Press Ctrl+– (the minus sign).
 • Click the upper portion of the Delete button on the Ribbon’s Home tab 
(the portion above the button’s name).
 
 Make sure that any cells that you want to keep aren’t in the rows or columns 
you delete. You can zoom out in your worksheet to check for any cells that 
aren’t normally visible on-screen. See also “Zooming a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Editing the Contents of a Cell
After you enter information into a cell, you can edit it. To edit the contents of a 
cell, use one of the following ways to get into cell-edit mode:
 ✓ 
Double-click the cell to edit the cell contents directly in the cell.
 ✓ 
Click the cell and press F2 to edit the cell contents directly in the cell.
 ✓ 
Click the cell that you want to edit; then click the formula bar to edit the 
cell contents in the formula bar.
All these methods cause the formula bar to display two new mouse icons. The 
following table describes these icons and what they do.
Icon
What It Does
Cancels editing, and the cell’s contents don’t change. (Pressing Esc has the 
same effect.)
Confirms the editing and enters the modified contents into the cell. (Pressing 
Enter has the same effect.)

56  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
Remember: If nothing happens after you double-click a cell, or if pressing F2 puts 
the cursor in the formula bar instead of directly in the cell, the in-cell editing 
feature is turned off. To turn on in-cell editing, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab, and then click the Options button.
 2. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Advanced category.
 3. 
In the Editing options section, select the Allow Editing Directly in the Cells 
check box.
 4. 
Click OK.
If you’re editing a cell that contains a formula, the name box (at the extreme 
left in the formula bar) displays a list of worksheet functions if you click the 
downward-pointing arrow next to the box. You can select a function from the 
list, and Excel provides assistance entering the arguments. The example in 
Figure 4-3 shows the contents of cell A1 after you double-click the cell for editing.
Figure 4-3
 
If you’re editing the contents of a cell (either directly in the cell or in the formula 
bar), the cursor changes to a vertical bar; you can move the vertical bar by using 
the direction keys. You can add new characters at the cursor’s location. After 
you’re in edit mode, you can use any of the following keys or key combinations to 
perform your edits:
 ✓ 
Left arrow/right arrow: Moves the cursor left or right one character, 
respectively, without deleting any characters.
 ✓ 
Ctrl+left arrow/Ctrl+right arrow: Moves the cursor one group of characters 
to the left or right, respectively.
 ✓ 
Shift+left arrow/ Shift+right arrow: Selects characters to the left or right 
of the cursor, respectively.
 ✓ 
Shift+Home: Selects from the cursor to the first character in the cell.
 ✓ 
Shift+End: Selects from the cursor to the last character in the cell.
 ✓ 
Backspace: Erases the character to the immediate left of the cursor.
 ✓ 
Delete: Erases the character to the right of the cursor or erases all 
selected characters.

Editing the Contents of a Cell — Entering Data into a Range  57
 ✓ 
Insert: Places Excel in ovr (overtype) mode. Rather than adding characters 
to the cell, you overtype, or replace, existing characters with new ones, 
depending on the position of the cursor.
 ✓ 
Home: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the cell entry.
 ✓ 
End: Moves the cursor to the end of the cell entry.
 ✓ 
Enter: Accepts the edited data.
 
 Remember: If you change your mind after editing a cell, you can click the 
undo button on the Quick Access toolbar (or press Ctrl+Z) to restore the 
cell’s previous contents.
 
 You can use the mouse to select characters while you’re editing a cell. Just click 
and drag the mouse pointer over the characters that you want to select.
Remember: If the cell is locked and the worksheet is protected, you can’t make 
any changes to the cell unless you unprotect the worksheet. See “Protecting a 
Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Entering Data into a Range
Excel provides timesaving methods for you to enter data quickly in a range of 
cells. These methods are particularly helpful if you need to enter a lot of data 
manually.
Entering data into a specific range
If you’re entering data into a range of cells, you may want to select the entire 
range of cells before you start entering data. This action causes Excel to move 
the cell pointer to the next cell in the selection after you press Enter.
The procedure works as follows:
 ✓ 
If the selection consists of multiple rows, Excel moves down the column; 
after it reaches the end of the column, it moves to the top of the next column.
 ✓ 
To skip a cell, press Enter without entering anything.
 ✓ 
To back up a row, press Shift+Enter. If you prefer to enter the data by rows 
rather than by columns, press Tab. To back up a column, press Shift+Tab.
Entering the same data into a range of cells
 
 If you need to enter the same data (value, text, or formula) into multiple cells, 
your first inclination may be to enter it once and then copy it to the remaining 
cells. The following steps show you a better way:

58  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 1. 
Select all the cells that you want to contain the data. (See “Selecting a 
range,” later in this part.)
 2. 
Enter the value, text, or formula into the active cell in the range. This cell 
is already selected when you highlight the range.
 3. 
Press Ctrl+Enter. Excel inserts the single entry into each cell in the selection.
Entering Dates and Times
Excel treats a date or a time as a value, but you format it to appear as a date or a 
time. If you work with dates and times, you need to understand Excel’s date and 
time system.
Excel’s system for working with dates uses a serial number system. The earliest 
date that Excel understands is January 1, 1900 (which has a serial number of 1). 
All other dates are counted from January 1, 1900. January 2, 1900 has a serial 
number of 2, January 1, 2010 has a serial number of 40179, and so on. Time is 
represented as a fraction of a day. For example, January 1, 2010 at 12:00:00 pm 
has a serial number of 40179.50. This system makes it easy to deal with dates 
and times in formulas.
Entering specific dates and times
Normally, you don’t need to concern yourself with the Excel serial-number date 
system. You can simply enter a date in a familiar format, and Excel takes care of 
the details.
 
 If you plan to use dates in formulas, make sure that the date you enter is one 
that Excel recognizes as a date (that is, a value); otherwise, your formula 
produces incorrect results. Excel is quite smart in recognizing dates that you 
enter into a cell, and it recognizes most common date formats. But it’s not perfect. 
Excel interprets the following entries, for example, as text and not dates:
 ✓ 
June 1 2010
 ✓ 
Jun-1 2010
 ✓ 
Jun-1/2010
 
 Remember: Excel uses a windowing approach for interpreting two-digit year 
entries. That is, within a 100-year window, Excel interprets 1/1/29 as January 1, 
2029. If you enter 1/1/30, Excel interprets it as January 1, 1930. To be safe, enter 
the year as a four-digit value and then format it as you want.
The best way to deal with times is to enter the time into a cell in a recognized 
format. The following table lists some examples of time formats that Excel 
recognizes.

11:30 a.m. on June 1, 2010
Entering the current date or time
If you need to date-stamp or time-stamp a cell in your worksheet, Excel provides 
the following two shortcut keys that perform this task for you:
 ✓ 
Current date: Press Ctrl+; (semicolon)
 ✓ 
Current time: Press Ctrl+Shift+; (semicolon)
Entering Formulas
A formula is a special type of cell entry that returns a result: After you enter a 
formula into a cell, the cell displays the result of the formula. The formula itself 
appears in the formula bar (which is just below the Ribbon) after you activate 
the cell.
A formula begins with an equal sign (=) and can consist of any of the following 
elements:
 ✓ 
Operators, such as + (for addition) and * (for multiplication)
 ✓ 
Cell references, including addresses such as B4 or C12, as well as named 
cells and ranges
 ✓ 
Values and text
 ✓ 
Worksheet functions (such as SUM)
You can enter a formula into a cell in one of two ways: manually (by typing it in) 
or by pointing to cell references. See also “Basic Formula Essentials,” in Part 5, 
for more information on operators and operator precedence.

60  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
Entering formulas manually
To enter a formula manually, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer (by clicking the cell with the mouse pointer or 
navigating with the arrow keys) to the cell that you want to hold the formula.
 2. 
Type an equal sign (=) to signal the fact that the cell contains a formula.
 3. 
Type the formula and press Enter.
As you type, a drop-down list appears below the cell. This is Excel’s Formula 
AutoComplete feature. The feature tries to anticipate what you’re typing and 
presents a list of matched items, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-4
 
To select an item from the list, simply double-click the item or press the Tab key 
and Excel inserts the item in the formula.
Here are the types of items that appear in the Formula AutoComplete drop-down 
list:
 ✓ 
Excel built-in functions: All functions in the Excel library. See also “Entering 
functions manually,” in Part 5.
 ✓ 
User-defined functions: Custom functions that supplement Excel’s built-in 
functions through add-ins or through functions defined in the workbook 
(using Excel’s macro language.)
 ✓ 
Defined names: All names you define in the workbook. See also Part 6, 
“Creating and Using Names.”
 ✓ 
Table names: The names of all Tables in the workbook. See also Part 11, 
“Working with Tables.”
The characters you type appear in the cell as well as in the formula bar. When 
entering a formula, you can use all the normal editing keys (Delete, Backspace, 
direction keys, and so on).

Entering Formulas  61
As you enter a formula, Excel shows each cell reference in the formula in a different 
color. If the reference cells are visible on the worksheet, you see a border around 
each cell in the same color as the cell reference in the formula. This feature makes it 
easier to identify the references of the cells you’re typing in your formulas.
See also “Entering formulas by pointing,” immediately following in this section.
 
 If you find the Formula AutoComplete feature distracting, or you simply want to 
disable it temporarily, follow these steps to turn off the feature:
 1. 
Click the File tab, and then click the Options button.
 2. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Formulas category.
 3. 
In the Working with formulas section, deselect the Formula AutoComplete 
check box.
 4. 
Click OK.
Entering formulas by pointing
The pointing method of entering a formula still involves some manual typing. 
The advantage is that you don’t need to type the cell or range references. 
Instead, you point to them in the worksheet using the mouse or the arrow keys, 
which is usually more accurate and less tedious.
The best way to explain this procedure is with an example. Follow these steps to 
enter the formula =A1/A2 into cell A3 by using the pointing method:
 1. 
In cell A1, type 12000 and press Enter. In cell A2, type 240 and press Enter.
 2. 
Move the cell pointer to cell A3 (by clicking the cell or navigating with the 
arrow keys). This cell is where you want the formula (and the result) to go.
 3. 
Type an equal sign (=) to begin the formula.
 4. 
Click cell A1 or press the up-arrow key twice. Note that Excel displays a 
moving border around the reference cell (A1) and the cell reference 
appears in cell A3 and in the formula bar (see Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-5
 
 
 Excel colors the cell reference in the formula and the moving border 
around the reference cell (A1) with the same color.

62  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 5. 
Type a division sign (/). Excel now displays a solid-colored border around 
the A1 cell reference.
 6. 
Click cell A2 or press the up-arrow key once. Excel adds A2 to the formula. 
Excel now displays a different color for the new cell reference in the formula 
and the same color for the border of the new reference cell.
 7. 
Press Enter to end the formula entry.
See also “Entering formulas manually,” earlier in this part.
Entering Text
You can use text in worksheets to serve as labels for values and headings for 
columns, or to provide instructions about the worksheet. An entry of mixed text 
and numbers is still considered text. A cell can hold as many as 32,767 
characters.
Entering text into cells
To enter text (rather than a value or a formula) in a cell, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer to the appropriate cell (by clicking the cell with the 
mouse pointer or by navigating with the arrow keys).
 2. 
Type the text.
 3. 
Press Enter or any of the direction keys.
 
 If you enter text that’s longer than the column’s current width, one of the 
following happens:
 ✓ 
If the cells to the immediate right are blank, Excel displays the text in its 
entirety, spilling the entry into adjacent cells.
 ✓ 
If an adjacent cell isn’t blank, Excel displays as much of the text as 
possible. (The cell contains the full text; it just doesn’t display all of it.)
In either case, you can always see the text (as you type it and after you type it) 
because it appears in the formula bar as well as in the cell.
Note that the formula bar has its own space that never overlaps with the 
worksheet grid. By default, the formula bar displays a cell’s contents on one line. 
If the cell contents exceeds the display capacity of a single line on the formula 
bar, Excel adds scroll arrows on the formula bar, as shown in Figure 4-6. You can 
view multiple lines of a cell’s contents on the formula bar (one line at a time) by 
clicking the up or down scroll arrows.

Entering Formulas — Entering Text  63
If you want to keep multiple lines of a cell’s content in view on the formula bar, 
you can adjust the height of the formula bar by dragging the resize bar at the 
bottom of the formula bar. As you drag the resize bar downwards, the worksheet 
grid is pushed down to accommodate the expanded formula bar. Clicking the 
Auto expand/collapse button at the far right of the formula bar (or pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+U) toggles between a single-line display and an expanded-line display 
(based on the last drag setting.)
Figure 4-6
 
Auto expand button
Resize cursor Resize bar Scroll arrows
Remember: To display a long text entry that’s adjacent to a cell that contains an 
entry, you can edit your text to make it shorter, increase the width of the 
column, or wrap the text within the cell so that it occupies more than one line. 
See also “Modifying Cell Size,” in Part 8.
Completing text entries by using AutoComplete
If you’re entering a lot of repeated text entries into a column, AutoComplete can 
help you speed up the process. You type the first few letters of a text entry into 
a cell, and Excel automatically completes the entry based on other entries 
you’ve made in the column. Your column entries must be contiguous (that is, 
have no blank cells between entries). AutoComplete doesn’t work with entries in 
a row.
AutoComplete works with no effort on your part; just follow these steps:
 1. 
Begin entering text or a value. If Excel recognizes your entry, it automatically 
completes it.
 2. 
If Excel guesses correctly, press Enter to accept it. To enter something 
else instead, just continue typing and ignore Excel’s guess.
 
 You can access this feature also by right-clicking the cell and choosing Pick from 
Drop-down List. If you use this method, Excel displays a list of all the entries in 
the current column. Just click the one you want, and Excel enters it 
automatically.
Remember: AutoComplete works only with pure text or mixed text (text and 
values); it doesn’t work with pure values.

64  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
Entering Values
Values, also known as numbers, represent a quantity of some type: revenue, 
number of units, test scores, and so on. Values can stand on their own, or you 
can use the values you enter into cells as part of a formula or in creating a chart. 
Excel’s numbers are precise up to 15 significant digits. If you enter a larger 
number, Excel stores it with only 15 digits of precision.
Entering values into cells
To enter a numeric value into a cell, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer to the appropriate cell (by clicking the mouse 
pointer in the cell or by navigating with the arrow keys).
 2. 
Enter the value.
 3. 
Press Enter, Tab, or any of the direction keys. The value is displayed in 
the cell and also appears in the formula bar.
You can also include a decimal point, dollar sign, plus sign, minus sign, and 
comma. If you precede a value with a minus sign or enclose it in parentheses, 
Excel considers the value a negative number.
Remember: Sometimes the value doesn’t appear exactly as you enter it. Excel 
may convert very large numbers to scientific notation. The formula bar, how-
ever, always displays the value that you originally entered.
Entering fractions
To enter a fraction into a cell, leave a space between the whole number part and 
the fractional part. To enter the decimal equivalent of 67⁄8, for example, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
Type 6.
 2. 
Type a space.
 3. 
Type 7/8.
 4. 
Press Enter. Excel displays 6 7/8 in the cell and 6.875 in the formula bar. In 
addition, Excel sets the cell format as Fraction. See also “Formatting a 
Number,” in Part 8.
If the value has no whole number part (for example, 1⁄8), you must enter a 0 and a 
space first, as follows: 0 1/8. Otherwise, Excel interprets the entry as January 8 
of the current year.

Entering Values — Filling a Series  65
Erasing Data in Cells and Ranges
To erase the contents of a cell but leave the cell’s formatting and cell comments 
intact, perform the following two steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range that you want to erase. (See “Selecting Cells and 
Ranges,” later in this part, for details.)
 2. 
Press Delete.
 
 For more control over what you delete, click the Clear button on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab and select an option from the menu. The menu contains the following 
six choices:
 ✓ 
Clear All: Clears everything from the cell or range
 ✓ 
Clear Formats: Clears only the formatting in the cell or range, and leaves 
the value, text, or formula
 ✓ 
Clear Contents: Clears only the cell’s or range’s contents and leaves the 
formatting
 ✓ 
Clear Comments: Clears the comment(s) attached to the cell or range (if a 
comment exists)
 ✓ 
Clear Hyperlinks and Remove Hyperlinks: Hyperlinks are not discussed 
in this book.
Filling a Series
Excel provides an AutoFill feature, which enables you to fill in several types of 
data series in a row or column. AutoFill uses the fill handle — the small square 
that appears at the bottom-right corner of the selected cell or range.
Excel provides an AutoFill Options Smart Tag next to the fill handle after you 
drag the fill handle to a new location. Click the AutoFill Options Smart Tag to 
display a list of commonly used fill options, such as Copy Cells, Fill Series, Fill 
Formatting Only, and Fill Without Formatting (see Figure 4-7).

66  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
Figure 4-7
 
Remember: If the selected cell or range doesn’t have a fill handle, it means the 
AutoFill feature is turned off. To turn on the feature, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the File tab and then click the Options button.
 2. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Advanced category.
 3. 
In the Editing options section, select the Enable Fill Handle and Cell Drag-
and-Drop check box.
 4. 
Click OK.
Remember: You can’t use AutoFill if you make a multiple selection.
Entering a series of incremental values or dates
To use AutoFill to enter a series of incremental values, follow these steps:
 1. 
Enter at least two values or dates in the series into adjacent cells. These 
values need not be consecutive.
 2. 
Select the cells that you used in Step 1. (See “Selecting a range,” later in 
this part, for details.)
 3. 
Click and drag the fill handle to complete the series in the cells that you 
select. As you drag the fill handle, Excel displays a small box that tells you 
what it’s planning to enter into each cell.
Remember: After you complete the drag operation, Excel displays the Auto Fill 
Options Smart Tag. You can click the Smart Tag to select a different fill option. 
For even more control, drag the fill handle while pressing the right mouse 
button. After you release the button, you see a list of options.
Remember: If one or more cells display a series of pound signs (such as ####) 
after you fill a number or date series, it means the column isn’t wide enough to 
display the number or date. The solution is to make the column wider. See 
“Changing column width,” in Part 8.

Filling a Series — Inserting or Deleting Entire Rows and Columns  67
 
AutoFill works also in the negative direction. If you use AutoFill by starting with 
two cells that contain –20 and –19, for example, Excel fills in –18, –17, and so on.
  If the values in the cells that you enter don’t have equal increments, Excel 
completes the series by calculating a simple linear regression. This feature is 
handy for performing simple forecasts. Note: Excel calculates a simple linear 
regression or progression, depending on the direction (negative or positive) of 
the series.
Entering a series of text
Excel is familiar with some text series (days of the week, months of the year), 
and it can complete these series for you automatically.
Follow these steps to use AutoFill to complete a known series of text:
 1. 
Enter any of the series into a cell (for example, Monday or February).
 2. 
Click and drag the fill handle to complete the series in the cells that you 
select.
 
 You can also teach Excel to recognize custom series that work with AutoFill. 
See “Sorting based on a custom sort order,” in Part 13.
Inserting or Deleting Entire Rows and Columns
If you insert new rows or columns in Excel, the program places blank rows or 
columns in the worksheet, and surrounding rows or columns move out to 
accommodate the new rows or columns.
In certain circumstances, you may want to delete entire rows or columns from 
your worksheet. If you delete a row or rows, the rows below the deleted row(s) 
shift upward to fill the gap. If you delete a column or columns, the columns to 
the right of the deleted column(s) shift to the left to fill the gap.
Inserting entire rows and columns
To insert new rows or columns in your worksheet, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select a cell below where you want to insert a row or to the right of where 
you want to insert a column. If you want to insert more than one row or 
column, select as many cells as rows or columns you’re inserting (See 
“Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in this part.)
 2. 
Choose one of the following options:
 • Right-click the selected cell(s) and choose Insert from the contextual 
menu.

68  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 • Press Ctrl+Shift++ (the plus sign on the top row of keys) or Ctrl++ (the 
plus sign on the numeric keypad).
 
 After you choose an option, Excel displays the Insert dialog box.
 3. 
Select either the Entire Row or Entire Column option button.
 4. 
Click OK.
 
 
In Step 2, you can click the arrow portion of the Insert split button on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab and then choose Insert Sheet Rows or Insert 
Sheet Columns from the menu. Using this method eliminates Steps 3 and 4.
 
 You can quickly insert rows or columns by first clicking the row or column 
header where you want to insert the row or column, then right-clicking the 
selection, and then choosing Insert from the menu. See “Selecting entire rows 
and columns,” later in this part.
Deleting entire rows and columns
To delete entire rows or columns, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the row header or column header of the row(s) or column(s) you 
want to delete. See “Selecting entire rows and columns,” later in this part. 
Excel selects the row(s) or column(s).
 2. 
With the mouse pointer on the selected row(s) or column(s), right-click 
and choose Delete from the menu.
Moving Cells and Ranges
Moving data in a cell or a range is common. You may, for example, need to 
relocate a range of data to make room for something else.
Moving data to a new location in the same worksheet
Follow these steps to move a cell or a range:
 1. 
Select the cell or range to move. (See “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in 
this part, for details.)
 
 2. 
Click the Cut button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+X 
or right-click the cell or range and choose Cut from the contextual menu.)
 3. 
Move the cell pointer to the range that will hold the copy (by clicking the 
cell or by navigating with the arrow keys). You need to select only the 
upper-left cell in the range.
 4. 
Press Enter.

Inserting or Deleting Entire Rows and Columns — Moving Cells and Ranges  69
If the range that you’re moving contains formulas that refer to other cells, 
the references continue to refer to the original cells. You almost always want 
references to continue to refer to the original cells.
 
 If you decide that the location that you’re moving to isn’t too far away, you can 
follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range to move. (See “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in 
this part.)
 2. 
Move the mouse pointer to any of the selection’s borders. 
 
 The mouse pointer changes to an arrow with a small directional cross at 
its tip.
 3. 
Drag the mouse to the location where you want to move the cell or range.
 4. 
Release the mouse button. Excel moves the cell or range to the new 
location.
 
 If you press and hold Shift while dragging, Excel performs a move and an 
insert paste in a single operation, without the use of the Insert dialog box. 
The insert paste operation allows you to insert the cell or range inside another 
range.
 
 Remember: If you change your mind after Step 2, press Esc to cancel the 
operation. If you change your mind after you move the data, you can click the 
undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z.
Remember: If the mouse pointer doesn’t change to an arrow in Step 2, your drag-
and-drop feature is off. To turn on this feature, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab, and then click the Options button.
 2. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Advanced tab.
 3. 
In the Editing options section, select the Enable Fill Handle and Cell 
Drag-and-Drop check box.
 4. 
To prevent accidental overwriting of data in the destination range, select 
the Alert before Overwriting Cells check box.
 5. 
Click OK.
 
 If you move data, make sure that you have enough blank cells to hold it. Except 
when you move data by dragging, Excel overwrites existing data without 
warning.
Moving data to a different worksheet or workbook
If you want to move the contents of a cell or range to a different worksheet or to 
a different workbook, follow these steps:

70  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 1. 
Select the cell or range to move. (See “Selecting Cells and Ranges,” later in 
this part, for details.)
 
 2. 
Click the Cut button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press Ctrl+X 
or right-click the cell or range and choose Cut from the contextual menu.)
 3. 
Activate the worksheet you’re moving to by clicking the sheet tab. If 
you’re moving the selection to a sheet on a different workbook, activate 
that workbook first by clicking the Switch Windows button on the 
Ribbon’s View tab and selecting the workbook from the menu. (You can 
select a different workbook also by selecting the workbook name on the 
Windows taskbar below the Excel window.) After you activate the workbook, 
select the destination worksheet for the data.
 4. 
Move the cell pointer to the range that will hold the copy (by clicking the 
cell or by navigating with the arrow keys). You need to select only the 
upper-left cell in the range.
 5. 
Press Enter.
 
 After you move data, make sure that you have enough blank cells to hold it. 
Excel overwrites existing data without warning.
 
 Remember: If you change your mind after Step 2, press Esc to cancel the oper-
ation. If you change your mind after you move the data, you can click the 
undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z.
Replacing the Contents of a Cell
To replace the contents of a cell with something else, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell. (See “Selecting a cell,” later in this part, for details.)
 2. 
Type your new entry. (It replaces the previous contents.)
Remember: Any formatting that you applied to the cell remains.
Searching for Data to Replace
Sometimes you may need to replace all occurrences of a value or text with 
something else. If your worksheet contains lots of data, you may find locating a 
particular piece of information difficult. A quick way to find something is to have 
Excel do it for you.

Moving Cells and Ranges — Searching for Data to Replace  71
To replace all occurrences of a value or text with something else:
 1. 
Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose 
Replace from the menu. (Alternatively, press Ctrl+H.) Excel displays its 
Find and Replace dialog box with the Replace tab selected, as shown in 
Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8
 
 2. 
In the Find What drop-down list, enter the text or value to search for.
 3. 
If you want to search for data with specific formatting:
 a. Click the Format button to the right of the Find What drop-down list. If 
the Format button isn’t visible, click the Options button. Excel displays 
the Find Format dialog box.
 b. Select the appropriate tabs and, in each tab, specify the formatting 
that you’re looking for.
 c. After you complete your selections, click OK to exit the Find Format 
dialog box.
 
 
 If a cell in your worksheet already contains all the formatting you want to 
use in your search, click the arrow on the Format button to the right of 
the Find What drop-down list and select Choose Format From Cell. 
Excel adds an eyedropper icon to the cursor. Click the cell that has the 
formatting you require.
 4. 
In the Replace With drop-down list, enter the text or value that should 
replace the text or value from Step 2.
 5.  If you want to specify new formatting for the replaced characters, click 
the Format button to the right of the Replace With drop-down list box and 
follow the procedure outlined in Step 3.
 6. 
In the Within drop-down list box, select whether you want to look in the 
active sheet or the entire workbook for the information that you typed in 
Step 2. If the Within drop-down box isn’t visible, click the Options button.

72  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 7. 
To have Excel search and replace all occurrences automatically, click the 
Replace All button. To verify each replacement instead, click the Find 
Next button. Excel pauses after it finds a match. To replace the found text, 
click Replace. To skip it and find the next match, click the Find Next 
button again. Click the Find All button to select a match from the drop-
down window.
 8. 
Click the Close button after you finish finding and replacing the text.
See also “Finding Specific Data,” in Part 7.
Selecting Cells and Ranges
In Excel, you normally select a cell or range before performing an operation that 
works with the cell or range. Topics in this section describe how to make various 
types of cell and range selections.
Remember: Many dialog boxes in Excel provide a special text box called a RefEdit 
box, which allows you to enter or point to a range. When a dialog box includes a 
RefEdit box, you can choose to select the range in advance or after you display 
the dialog box. You encounter RefEdit boxes (although we may not explicitly 
refer to them as such) in various procedures we describe in this book.
Selecting a cell
To select a cell (and make it the active cell), use any of the following techniques:
 ✓ 
Use the arrow keys to move the cell pointer to the cell.
 ✓ 
Click the cell with the mouse pointer.
 ✓ 
Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Go To 
from the menu (or press F5 or Ctrl+G), enter the cell address in the 
Reference text box of the Go To dialog box that appears, and click OK.
The selected cell now has a dark border around it, and its address appears in 
the name box.
Selecting a range
 
 You can select a range in any of the following ways:
 ✓ 
Click the mouse in a cell and drag to highlight the range. If you drag past 
the end of the screen, the worksheet scrolls.
 ✓ 
Move to the first cell of the range. Press F8, and then move the cell pointer 
with the direction keys to highlight the range. Press F8 again to return the 
arrow keys to normal movement.

Searching for Data to Replace —Selecting Cells and Ranges  73
 ✓ 
Press Shift as you use the arrow keys to select a range.
 ✓ 
Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Go To 
from the menu (or press F5 or Ctrl+G), enter a range’s address in the 
Reference text box of the Go To dialog box that appears, and click OK.
Selecting noncontiguous ranges
Most of the time, the ranges that you select are contiguous — they are a single 
rectangle of cells. Excel also enables you to work with noncontiguous ranges, 
which consist of two or more ranges (or single cells) that aren’t necessarily next 
to each other (also known as a multiple selection).
To apply the same formatting to cells in different areas of your worksheet, for 
example, one approach is to make a multiple selection. After you select the 
appropriate cells or ranges, Excel applies the formatting that you choose to all 
the selected cells. Figure 4-9 shows two noncontiguous ranges (B2:G2 and 
B6:G6) that have been selected.
Figure 4-9
 
 
 You can select a noncontiguous range in any of the following ways:
 ✓ 
Drag the mouse to select the first range, then press and hold Ctrl as you 
drag the mouse to select the other ranges.
 ✓ 
From the keyboard, select the first range by pressing F8 and then using the 
arrow keys. After selecting the first range, press Shift+F8, move the cell 
pointer using the arrow keys, and press F8 to start selecting another range.
 ✓ 
Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Go To 
from the menu (or press F5 or Ctrl+G), and enter a range’s address in the 
Reference text box of the Go To dialog box that appears. Separate the 
different ranges with a comma. Click OK, and Excel selects the cells in the 
ranges that you specify.
Selecting entire rows and columns
You can select entire rows or columns in any of the following ways:

74  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
 ✓ 
Click the row or column heading to select a single row or column.
 ✓ 
To select multiple adjacent rows or columns, click a row or column 
heading and drag to highlight additional rows or columns.
 ✓ 
To select multiple (nonadjacent) rows or columns, press Ctrl as you click 
the row or column headings that you want.
 ✓ 
Press Ctrl+spacebar to select the column of the active cell or the columns 
of the selected range.
 ✓ 
Press Shift+spacebar to select the row of the active cell or the rows of the 
selected cells.
 ✓ 
Click the Select All button at the intersection of the row and column headers, 
or press Ctrl+A or Ctrl+Shift+spacebar to select all cells in the worksheet. 
Selecting all cells is the same as selecting all columns and all rows.
Selecting a multisheet (3-D) range
An Excel workbook can contain more than one worksheet, and a range can 
extend across multiple worksheets. You can think of these as three-dimensional 
ranges.
To select a multisheet range, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select a cell or range on the active sheet. See “Selecting a range,” earlier in 
this part.
 2. 
Group the sheets that will be in the range. See “Grouping and Ungrouping 
Worksheets,” in Part 3.
After you select a multisheet range, you can perform the same operations that 
you can perform on a single sheet range. Any changes that you make to one 
sheet (formatting, entering or editing data, and so on) are reflected in the other 
sheets.
Transposing a Range
If you need to change the orientation of a range, Excel can do it for you in a 
snap. After you transpose a range, the data that was in rows is transferred to 
columns and vice versa. Figure 4-10 shows an example of a horizontal range that 
we transposed to a vertical range.

Selecting Cells and Ranges — Undoing Changes and Mistakes  75
Figure 4-10
 
The transpose operation is nothing more than a special paste option. To 
transpose a range, therefore, follow the steps outlined in “Copying a range to 
another range,” earlier in this part, but in Step 4, select the Transpose option 
from the Paste Options gallery. Ensure that the transposed range doesn’t 
overlap the nontransposed range.
After you transpose a range, delete the original range if required.
Remember: Excel adjusts any formulas in the original range so that they work 
correctly after you transpose them.
Undoing Changes and Mistakes
One very useful feature in Excel is its multilevel Undo feature. This feature 
enables you to reverse your recent actions, one step at a time. If you discover 
that you accidentally deleted a range of data several minutes ago, for example, 
you can use the Undo feature to successively undo your actions until the 
deleted range reappears.
To undo an operation, use any of the following techniques:
 
 ✓ 
Click the undo button on the Quick Access toolbar until you arrive at the 
action that you want to undo.
 ✓ 
Press Ctrl+Z until you arrive at the action that you want to undo.
 ✓ 
Click the arrow on the undo button on the Quick Access toolbar. This 
action displays a description of your recent actions. Select the actions that 
you want to undo.

76  Part 4: Entering and Editing Worksheet Data
In Excel 2007 and Excel 2010, you can undo a maximum of 100 operations. In 
earlier versions of Excel, you can undo only a maximum of 16 operations.
Validating Data Entry
You can specify the type of data that a cell can accept. If you develop a 
spreadsheet that others use, for example, you can limit the range of values that 
a user may enter into input cells. Excel then validates the input to ensure that 
the values the user enters fall within the range you specified. Excel displays an 
error message if a user enters an invalid value.
To specify data-entry validation criteria, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range that you want to validate. (See “Selecting Cells and 
Ranges,” earlier in this part, for details.)
 2. 
Click the Data tab on the Ribbon and click the upper portion of the Data 
Validation split button (the portion with the icon) or click the arrow on 
the button and choose Data Validation from the menu. Excel displays the 
Data Validation dialog box.
 3. 
Click the Settings tab, and specify the type of data that the cell should 
have by selecting an entry from the Allow drop-down list box and the Data 
drop-down list box, if applicable.
 
 You can specify any of the following options to validate data entered in 
a cell:
 • Whole numbers within specified limits.
 • Decimal numbers within specified limits.
 • A list of predefined choices. You can enter the list choices directly into 
the list Source box (separating each choice with a comma), or you can 
use a range reference, which stores the choices in individual cells in 
the range. After you specify the list, a drop-down arrow appears in a 
validation cell when you select it.
 • Dates within specified limits.
 • Times within specified limits.
 • The length of entered text or numbers within specified limits. Note that 
Excel refers to this option as Text Length, although it’s applicable to 
both the length of a text string and the number of digits in a number (or 
a combination of text and numbers).

Undoing Changes and Mistakes — Validating Data Entry  77
 • A Custom validation. You can enter a Boolean formula (a formula that 
returns a True or a False value) to specify a validation rule. If the formula 
returns False, the validation rule is invoked. For example, if you specify 
a data validation entry range in a column that starts at cell A2, the 
formula =A2>A1 ensures that each value entered in the range is greater 
than the value above it. (Excel automatically adjusts the validation 
reference for each cell in the range, so for cell A3 the formula is 
=A3>A2, and so on.)
 4. 
To specify a message to appear after a user clicks an input cell, click the 
Input Message tab and type a message in the Input Message text box. If 
you want a title to appear at the top of the message, enter a title in the 
Title text box.
 5. 
To specify a custom error message to appear in a dialog box if someone 
enters invalid data, click the Error Alert tab and type a message in the 
Error Message text box. If you want a title to appear at the top of the 
message, enter a title in the Title text box.
 
 Choose a style for the error message from the Style drop-down list box 
(Stop, Warning, or Information). Each style that you select displays an 
error icon and various buttons on the error dialog box as follows:
 • Stop: Displays Retry and Cancel buttons.
 • Warning: Displays Yes, No, and Cancel buttons. (Clicking Yes enters the 
invalid data.)
 • Information: Displays OK and Cancel buttons. (Clicking OK enters the 
invalid data.)
 6. 
Click OK.
If you subsequently want to remove the validation criteria from a cell or range, 
select the cell or range, click the upper portion of the Data Validation split 
button on the Ribbon’s Data tab, and click the Clear All button in the Data 
Validation dialog box that appears.
Remember: If you don’t specify a message in Step 5, Excel uses a default message 
if a data-entry error occurs.
 
 You can combine data validation with worksheet protection to permit only 
validated input cells to be altered. See “Protecting a Worksheet,” in Part 3.

Using Formulas 
and Functions
This part deals with topics related to formulas and functions. Formulas make using 
spreadsheets valuable by allowing you to calculate results from data stored in the 
worksheet. Functions are built-in or custom tools used in formulas. They can make 
your formulas perform powerful feats and save you a great deal of time.

✓ Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Worksheets or Workbooks
Part 5

80  Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions
Absolute, Relative, and Mixed References
If you copy a formula containing an absolute reference, Excel doesn’t adjust the 
reference in the copied cell. (An absolute reference uses two dollar signs in its 
address, one for the column part and one for the row part.) On the other hand, 
Excel adjusts relative references as you copy the formula.
Excel also enables you to use mixed references, in which only one part of the 
address is absolute. The following table summarizes all possible types of cell 
references and shows how a reference changes after it is copied one cell down 
or one cell across. In all cases, the absolute portion of the reference is unchanged.
Type
Example
Down Across
Relative reference
=A1
=A2
=B1
Absolute reference
=$A$1
=$A$1
=$A$1
Mixed reference (column part is absolute)
=$A1
=$A2
=$A1
Mixed reference (row part is absolute)
=A$1
=A$1
=B$1
To change the type of cell reference in a formula, follow these steps:
 1. 
Double-click the cell containing the formula (or press F2) to get into edit mode.
 2. 
In the cell or formula bar, click the mouse pointer on the cell reference.
 3. 
Press F4 repeatedly to cycle through all possible cell reference types. Stop 
after the cell reference displays the type you want to use.
 4. 
Press Enter to complete the operation.
Basic Formula Essentials
Every Excel formula begins with an equal sign. A formula can consist of up to 
8,192 characters and include any of the following elements:
 ✓ 
Operators such as + (for addition) and * (for multiplication)
 ✓ 
Absolute, relative, or mixed cell references, such as $A$1 or B2:G10
 ✓ 
Named references, such as Revenue or Profit
 ✓ 
Values, text, or logical values
 ✓ 
Worksheet functions (such as SUM or AVERAGE)
Note that in versions prior to Excel 2007, a formula can consist of no more than 
1,024 characters.

Absolute, Relative, and Mixed References — Changing When Formulas Are Calculated  81
After you enter a formula into a cell, the cell displays the result of the formula. 
You see the formula itself in the formula bar as the cell activates. (The formula 
bar lies below the Ribbon.)
Operator precedence is the set of rules that Excel uses to perform its calculations 
in a formula.
The following table provides the list of operators that you can use in formulas 
and indicates each operator’s precedence.
Operator
Name
Precedence
^
Exponentiation (raised to a power)
1
*
Multiplication
2
/
Division
2
+
Addition
3
–
Subtraction
3
&
Concatenation (joins text)
4
=
Equal to
5
>
Greater than
5
<
Less than
5
The table shows that exponentiation has the highest precedence (that is, Excel 
performs it first), and logical comparisons have the lowest precedence. If two 
operators have the same precedence, Excel performs the calculations from left 
to right.
Remember: You can override operator precedence by using parentheses in your 
formulas. In the formula =(Income–Expenses)*TaxRate, for example, 
Expenses are subtracted from Income, and the result is multiplied by TaxRate.
Changing When Formulas Are Calculated
If the Excel calculation mode is set to automatic (the default), changing cells that 
you use in a formula causes the formula to display a new result automatically.
To set the Excel calculation mode to manual, click the Formulas tab on the 
Ribbon, click the Options button in the Calculation group, and choose Manual 
from the menu.
Remember: If you’re working in manual calculation mode, Excel displays 
Calculate in the status bar if you have any uncalculated formulas. Do one of 
the following to recalculate the formulas:

82  Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions
 
 ✓ 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click the Calculate Now button 
in the Calculation group or press F9. The formulas in all open workbooks 
are immediately calculated.
 
 ✓ 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click the Calculate Sheet button in 
the Calculation group or press Shift+F9. The formulas in the active worksheet 
only are immediately calculated. Other worksheets in the same workbook 
aren’t calculated.
Remember: The Excel calculation mode isn’t specific to a particular worksheet. If 
you change the calculation mode, that change affects all open workbooks and 
not just the active workbook.
To return to automatic calculation mode, click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click 
the Options button in the Calculation group, and choose Automatic from the menu.
Converting Formulas to Values
Sometimes, you may want to convert a formula to its current value (remove the 
formula and leave only its result). For example, you may want to prevent future 
changes to the value of a cell if other cells that the formula references change.
To convert a formula to its current value, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell that contains the formula. To convert several formulas, you 
can select a range.
 
 2. 
Click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. (You can also press 
Ctrl+C or right-click the cell and choose Copy from the contextual menu.)
 3. 
Click the arrow portion of the Paste button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and 
choose an option in the Paste Values section of the Paste Options gallery.
 4. 
Press Enter or Esc to exit Copy mode.
Remember: This procedure overwrites the formulas. To put the current values of 
the formulas in a different (empty) area of the worksheet, select a new cell or 
the upper-left cell of a new range before Step 3.
Editing Functions in Formulas
After you create a formula with one or more functions, you may want to modify 
the arguments in one of the functions later. Excel provides several ways for you 
to modify a function. The method you choose depends on personal choice and 
the complexity of the function.

Changing When Formulas Are Calculated — Entering Functions in Formulas  83
Use any of the following techniques to modify a function:
 
 ✓ 
If your formula contains only one function or if the function you want to 
modify is the last one in the formula, click the Insert Function button on 
the formula bar (or on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon), or press Shift+F3 
to display the Insert Function dialog box for the function.
 ✓ 
If your formula contains more than one function, press F2 or double-click 
the formula cell. Position the cursor within the function that you want to 
modify and click the Insert Function button, or press Shift+F3.
 ✓ 
The most efficient way to modify simple functions (that is, those with few 
arguments) is to do so manually. Excel provides a ScreenTip (floating text) 
for the function to help you identify the names and order of the function’s 
arguments.
See also “Entering Functions in Formulas,” immediately following this section.
Entering Functions in Formulas
Excel provides more than 300 built-in functions that can make your formulas 
perform powerful feats and save you a great deal of time. Functions perform the 
following tasks:
 ✓ 
Simplify your formulas
 ✓ 
Enable formulas to perform calculations that are otherwise impossible
 ✓ 
Enable conditional execution of formulas — giving them some rudimentary 
decision-making capability
Most worksheet functions use one or more arguments, enclosed in parentheses. 
Think of an argument as a piece of information that clarifies what you want the 
function to do. For example, the following function (which rounds the number in 
cell A1 to two decimal places) uses two arguments:
=ROUND(A1,2)
Remember: You can nest a function within another function. The formula 
=SUM(MAX(B1:B6),ROUND(A1,2)), for example, nests the MAX and ROUND 
functions in the SUM function. This example sums the maximum value in the 
range B1 to B6 and the value in cell A1, rounded to two decimal places.
See also “Editing Functions in Formulas,” immediately preceding this section.

84  Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions
Entering functions manually
Even if you’re not familiar with the function that you want to use, you can begin 
typing the function name and Excel’s Formula AutoComplete feature will drop 
down a list of possible matches, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1
 
If you continue typing without selecting a name from the list, Excel narrows the 
available choices. If you want to select a function name from the list, you can 
either double-click with the mouse or highlight the name (using the mouse or 
arrow keys) and press the Tab key. Excel inserts the function in the formula and 
includes an opening parenthesis.
Excel provides assistance for the functions in the drop-down list in the form of 
ScreenTips (see Figure 5-1). Each ScreenTip provides a brief description of the 
function’s use.
Excel provides you with further assistance after you type the entire function 
name manually (including the opening parenthesis) or you select the function 
from the drop-down list. This assistance enables you to determine the number 
and order of arguments in the function. Excel displays a ScreenTip below the 
function you’re typing. The ScreenTip includes the name of the function you 
typed followed by the names of all the function’s mandatory and optional 
arguments in parentheses. To display a Help window for the function, click the 
function name in the ScreenTip.
See also “Entering formulas manually,” in Part 4.
Using the AutoSum tool
 
 The AutoSum tool provides a quick method for you to enter commonly used 
functions.
To use the AutoSum tool, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click a cell below or to the right of a range of numbers you want to 
aggregate.
 
 2. 
Perform one of the following actions:

Entering Functions in Formulas  85
 • To sum the range, click the AutoSum button on the Ribbon’s Home tab 
or Formulas tab. Excel places a marquee (also known as marching ants) 
around cells that it thinks you want to sum. If the range of cells that the 
marquee surrounds isn’t the range that you want to sum, use the 
mouse to highlight a new range. Click the AutoSum button again or 
press Enter to complete the operation.
 • To find the average, count, minimum, or maximum of the range, click 
the arrow on the AutoSum button to display a menu for selecting these 
operations. Click the operation that you want to perform from the 
menu, and follow the procedure that we describe for summing the 
range after Excel places the marquee around the cells.
 
 Excel automatically places a marquee around the first region that it encounters 
above or to the left of the formula cell. A region is a range that contains nonblank 
cells. To select multiple regions as you use the AutoSum tool in Step 2, press 
and hold Ctrl while dragging the mouse over each region. See also “Selecting 
Cells and Ranges,” in Part 4.
Using the Function Library
The Function Library enables you to easily enter a function and its arguments. 
The Function Library is particularly useful if you’re not sure of the function 
you’re looking for and want to browse through the available choices. To make it 
easier to find what you’re looking for, Excel groups the available functions into 
well-known categories, such as financial and text.
To enter a function by using the Function Library, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the cell that will contain the function. If you’re inserting the 
function into an existing formula, click the formula at the position where 
you want to insert the function.
 2. 
If you’re inserting a new function adjacent to another function in a formula, 
you must add an operator (for example, +, –, or *) or a comma at this 
point to delimit the two functions.
 3. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and click a function category in the 
Function Library group. You can click the More Functions button if the 
category you want is not shown in the Functions Library group.
 4. 
Choose a function that you want from the menu. Excel displays the 
Function Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-2. The Function 
Arguments dialog box prompts you for each argument of the function that 
you select. You can enter the arguments manually, or you can point to 
them in the worksheet if they’re cell references. The Function Arguments 
dialog box displays the result.
 
 To get help with the function, click Help on This Function in the Function 
Arguments dialog box. Excel displays the Help window for the function.

86  Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions
 5. 
After you specify all the required arguments, click OK.
Figure 5-2
 
Modifying a Range Reference Used in a Function
If you edit a cell that contains a formula, Excel color-codes the references in 
the formula and places an outline around each cell or range that the formula 
references. The color of the outline corresponds to the color that appears in the 
formula. Each outlined cell or range also contains fill handles (a small square in 
each corner of the outlined cell or range). See Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3
 
Fill handles
Outline in color
If your formula contains a function that uses a range argument, you can easily 
modify the range reference by following these steps:
 1. 
To begin editing the formula, press F2 or double-click the cell. See also 
“Editing the Contents of a Cell,” in Part 4.
 2. 
Locate the range that the function uses. (The range appears with an 
outline.)

Entering Functions in Formulas — Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Workbooks  87
 3. 
Drag a fill handle to extend or contract the range. You can also click a 
border of the outlined range and move the outline to a new range. In 
either case, Excel changes the range reference in the formula.
 4. 
Press Enter.
Remember: Formulas that contain name references place a colored outline around 
the named cell or range. The outline doesn’t provide fill handles, however, or 
enable you to move this type of reference by clicking a border of the outline.
Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Workbooks
External references to other workbooks are also known as links. The workbook 
that contains the link formulas (external reference formulas) is the destination 
workbook. The workbook that is the source of the data that the external reference 
formula uses is the source workbook. Note that the source workbook doesn’t 
need to remain open while you are working in the destination workbook.
Referencing cells in other workbooks
If your formula needs to refer to a cell in a different workbook, use the following 
format for your formula:
=[WorkbookName]SheetName!CellAddress
The workbook name (in brackets), the worksheet name, and an exclamation 
point precede the cell address. Such a formula is sometimes known as a link 
formula or an external reference.
Remember: If either the workbook name or the worksheet name in the reference 
includes one or more spaces, you must enclose it (and the sheet name) in single 
quotation marks. The following formula, for example, refers to a cell on Sheet1 
in a workbook named Budget For 2005:
=A1*‘[Budget For 2005]Sheet1’!A1
If a formula refers to cells in a different workbook, the other workbook doesn’t 
need to remain open. If the workbook is closed, you must add the complete path 
to the reference. For example:
=A1* ‘C:\My Documents\Excel\[Budget For 2005]Sheet1’!A1
 
 The easiest way to enter formulas that require external links is by pointing. You 
must have all source workbooks open. See “Arranging Windows Automatically,” 
in Part 2 and “Entering formulas by pointing,” in Part 4.

88  Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions
 
 
To avoid problems that can occur in formulas in the destination workbook when 
you insert or delete rows, columns, or cells or otherwise move linked cells or 
ranges in source workbooks, we strongly recommend that you use names for cells 
or ranges that the dependent workbook references in the source workbooks.
Managing links
As you work with external references in a worksheet, occasionally you may need 
to perform a few management tasks. Excel provides the Edit Links dialog box to 
help you with these tasks.
To display the Edit Links dialog box (see Figure 5-4), click the Edit Links button 
on the Ribbon’s Data tab. The button is disabled if your workbook contains no 
links (external references) to another workbook.
Figure 5-4
 
The window in the Edit Links dialog box lists all the source workbooks that your 
destination workbook is connected to. You can perform the following operations 
in the Edit Links dialog box:
 ✓ 
Update Values: If you need to update the values from external workbooks 
during your working session, you can do so by using this button.
 
 Select the source workbook or workbooks in the window and click Update 
Values.
 ✓ 
Change Source: If the location or name of a source workbook changes, you 
have to update the link information.
 
 In the window, select the source workbook whose name has changed and 
click Change Source. In the Change Source dialog box, navigate to the 
location of the new source file, select the file, and click OK.
 ✓ 
Open Source: The Edit Links dialog box provides a convenient location 
from which to open source workbooks.
 
 In the window, select the workbook(s) you want to open and click Open 
Source. Excel opens all the workbooks that you select.

Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Workbooks  89
 ✓ 
Break Link: If you want to retain the current values (not formulas) from 
one or more source workbooks, and you no longer want to link to the 
source(s), you can break the links to the source workbook(s).
 
 In the window, select the workbook(s) with which you want to sever the 
links and click Break Link. Because you cannot undo the operation, Excel 
prompts you for confirmation. Click Break Links in the confirmation 
message box to permanently break the links.
 ✓ 
Check Status: Whenever you open the Edit Links dialog box, the Status 
column in the window displays as Unknown. Excel doesn’t automatically 
display the current status of links.
 
 Click the Check Status button to see the current status of links. A status of 
OK, Source is open, or Value updated from <filename> indicates 
that no action is required on the user’s part. However, if the status displays 
a warning or error message for a source workbook, the user must update 
the values, change the source, or open the source. The specific error or 
warning message indicates the required action.
 ✓ 
[Change] Startup Prompt: By default, when you open a workbook containing 
external references (the destination workbook), Excel prompts you to 
update links if any source workbooks are not already open. (Links are 
updated automatically when source workbooks are open.) However, you 
can control the prompting and updating behavior when opening a workbook.
 
 Click the Startup Prompt button. Excel displays a dialog box with the 
following three choices:
 • Let users choose to display the alert or not. After selecting this option, the 
user must then turn the alert display on or off as follows: Click the File 
tab and then click the Options button. In the Excel Options dialog box, 
click the Advanced category and scroll down to the General section. 
Finally, select or deselect the Ask to Update Automatic Links check box.
  If you deselect the check box, Excel automatically updates the links 
without displaying a prompt when you open a dependent workbook. 
Note that this option affects the current user only and applies to every 
dependent workbook that the current user opens. The option does not 
affect any other user with whom you share the workbook.
 • Don’t display the alert and don’t update automatic links. This option is 
self-explanatory and affects all users with whom you share the 
workbook.
 • Don’t display the alert and update links. This option is self-explanatory, 
and affects all users with whom you share the workbook.

90  Part 5: Using Formulas and Functions
Referencing Cells or Ranges in Other Worksheets
If your formula needs to refer to a cell in a different worksheet in the same 
workbook, use the following format for your formula:
SheetName!CellAddress
Precede the cell address with the worksheet name, and follow it with an 
exclamation point.
Remember: If the worksheet name in the reference includes one or more spaces, 
you must enclose the name in single quotation marks. The following is a formula 
that refers to a cell on a sheet by the name of All Depts:
=A1*‘All Depts’!A1
 
 An easy way to enter a range reference on another worksheet is by pointing with 
the mouse. See “Entering formulas by pointing,” in Part 4.
If you need to reference a 3-D range in a function, enter the range in the following 
format:
=FunctionName(FirstSheet:LastSheet!RangeReference)
For example:
=SUM(Sheet2:Sheet4!$A$1:$A$10)
The following rules apply to 3-D range references:
 ✓ 
The range includes all sheets between the first and last sheet names in the 
reference, inclusive.
 ✓ 
If you insert another sheet between the first and last sheets, it will be 
included in the reference automatically.
 ✓ 
You can use absolute or relative references in the range reference.
 ✓ 
You can use any valid names for the sheets, but if any name has a space, 
you must use single quotes to enclose the names in the reference. For 
example:
=SUM(‘Dept Engineering:Dept HR’!$A$1:$A$10)
Remember: Less than 10 percent of Excel’s functions support 3-D range references 
and those that do fall mostly in the statistical category.
 
 You can point with the mouse to create a 3-D reference. First position the mouse 
pointer in the function where the reference will be placed. Then select the cell 
or range in the first worksheet that will be included in the reference. Next, press 
and hold Shift and click the sheet tab of the last sheet in the reference. Press 
Enter to complete the procedure.

Creating and Using 
Names
Dealing with cryptic cell and range addresses can be confusing. Fortunately, Excel 
enables you to assign descriptive names to cells and ranges. For example, you can 
name a cell InterestRate or name a range JulySales.

Part 6

92  Part 6: Creating and Using Names
Advantages to Naming Cells and Ranges
Using names for cells and ranges offers the following advantages:
 ✓ 
A meaningful range name (such as Income) is much easier to remember 
than a range address (such as A1: A21).
 ✓ 
After you select a named cell or range, its name appears in the name box.
 ✓ 
You can quickly move to a named area of your worksheet by choosing a 
name in the name box.
 ✓ 
Creating formulas is easier because you can paste a cell or range name into 
a formula.
 ✓ 
Names make your formulas more understandable and easier to use. For 
example, =Income–Taxes is more intuitive than =D20–D40.
Although Excel is flexible about the names that you can define, it does have the 
following rules:
 ✓ 
Names must begin with a letter or the underscore character (_).
 ✓ 
Names can’t contain any spaces. You may want to use an underscore or a 
period character to simulate a space (such as Annual_Total or Annual.
Total).
 ✓ 
You can use any combination of letters and numbers, but the name must 
not begin with a number (such as 3rdQuarter) or look like a cell reference 
(such as Q3).
 ✓ 
You can’t use most symbols. You can, however, use the underscore (_), 
period (.), backslash (\), and question mark (?).
 ✓ 
Names can be no more than 255 characters long.
 
 Excel also reserves a few names internally for its own use. Avoid using the 
following for names: Print_Area, Print_Titles, Consolidate_Area, and 
Sheet_Title.
Applying Names to Existing Cell References
If you create a new name for a cell or a range, Excel doesn’t automatically use 
the name in place of existing references in your formulas. For example, if you 
have a formula such as =A1*20 and then give a name to cell A1, the formula 
continues to display A1 (not the new name). Replacing cell or range references 
with their corresponding names, however, is fairly easy.

Advantages to Naming Cells and Ranges — Creating Names  93
To apply names to cell references in existing formulas, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the range with the formulas that you want to modify.
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow on the Define Name 
button, and choose Apply Names from the menu. Excel displays the Apply 
Names dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1
 
 3. 
Select the names that you want to apply by clicking them in turn.
 4. 
Click OK. Excel replaces the range references with the names in the 
selected cells.
 
 If you select a nonformula cell in Step 1, Excel applies the names to all applicable 
formulas in the worksheet.
Creating Names
Excel provides several useful methods for creating names. The method you 
choose depends on personal preference and techniques that may allow you to 
save time.
Creating a name using the New Name dialog box
To create a range name using the New Name dialog box, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the cell or range that you want to name.
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Define Name 
button (or right-click the range and choose Name a Range from the 
contextual menu). Excel displays the New Name dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 6-2.

94  Part 6: Creating and Using Names
Figure 6-2
 
 3. 
In the Name text box, type a name (or use the name that Excel proposes, 
if any).
 4. 
If needed, enter a comment in the Comment box. You can enter a comment, 
for example, to provide a description and other details of the name for 
future worksheet auditing purposes.
 5. 
Verify that the address Excel displays in the Refers To text box is correct. 
To refer to a different address, delete the address and then either type the 
new cell or range address (with a leading equal sign) or use the mouse 
pointer to select the cell or range on the worksheet.
 6. 
Click OK.
 
 If you want to create several names in one go, use the Name Manager instead of 
the Define Name method. Click the Name Manager button in the Formulas tab. In 
the Name Manager dialog box, click New to add a name. After you finish adding 
a name, you’re returned to the Name Manager dialog box, where you can repeat 
the process to create additional names.
Creating a name using the name box
The name box is on the left side of the formula bar, as shown in Figure 6-3.
Figure 6-3
 
Name box
Name box divider
Resize cursor
To create a name by using the name box, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range to name.
 2. 
Click the name box, and enter the name.

Creating Names  95
 3. 
Press Enter to create the name.
Remember: If a name already exists, you can’t use the name box to change the 
reference for the name. Attempting to do so simply displays the already existing 
name.
You can increase the width of the name box so that you can see more of longer 
names. Drag the name box divider (the area around the dimple in Figure 6-3) to 
the left or right.
Creating names from row and column labels
Your worksheet may contain column or row labels that you want to use for 
naming adjacent cells or ranges. Figure 6-4 shows a range of data with month 
labels in the left column and regions on the top row. You can create a name for 
each row in the range using the labels in the left column or create a name for 
each column in the range using the labels in the top row. You can also use both 
the top row and the left column to name simultaneously each row and each 
column in the range.
Figure 6-4
 
To create names by using adjacent row or column labels, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the name labels and the cells that you want to name. The labels 
must be adjacent to the cells that you’re naming. A multiple selection isn’t 
possible here.
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Create from 
Selection button. The Create Names from Selection dialog box appears. 
Excel guesses how to create the names by checking the appropriate 
Create Names From Values In The check boxes. If the labels are on the left 
of the cells that you want to name, for example, Excel selects the Left 
Column option.
 3. 
If Excel’s selection isn’t what you want, clear the selection and select the 
correct Create Names From Values In The check boxes as necessary.
 4. 
Click OK to create the names.

96  Part 6: Creating and Using Names
 
If you create names from both row and column labels, you can refer to an entry 
in your table by the intersection of the row and column labels. In Figure 6-4, for 
example, I created names from the top row and left column labels in the range. 
You can create a formula like this: =A1*Mar North, where Mar North = 3575.
Remember: If the label that a cell contains results in an invalid name, Excel 
modifies the name to make it valid. If Excel encounters a value or a formula 
where a text label should be, however, it doesn’t convert it to a valid name. It 
simply doesn’t create a name.
Remember: The names that you create do not include the cells with the labels.
Creating sheet-level names
Normally, you can use a name that you create anywhere within the workbook. 
Names, by default, are book-level rather than sheet-level in scope. But what if 
you have several worksheets in a workbook and you want to use the same name 
(such as Dept_Total) in each sheet to signify different values? You need to 
create sheet-level names.
To define a sheet-level name, follow these steps:
 1. 
Complete Steps 1–5 in the procedure for “Creating a name using the New 
Name dialog box,” earlier in this part.
 2. 
Click the Scope drop-down list and select the sheet name to which the 
name you’re defining will belong. Although you can select any sheet name 
from the list, you’ll normally want to choose the sheet with your selected 
cell or range.
 3. 
Click OK.
 
 You also can create a sheet-level name by using the name box. Select the cell or 
range, click the name box, and enter the name, preceding it with the sheet’s 
name (surrounded with single quotes if the name contains spaces) and an 
exclamation point. For example, if you want to create a sheet-level name of 
Dept_Total in a sheet named Human Resources, enter ‘Human 
Resources’!Dept_Total in the name box.
Remember: If you write a formula that uses a sheet-level name in the sheet where 
you define it, you don’t need to include the worksheet name in the range name. 
(The name box doesn’t display the worksheet name either.) If you use the name 
in a formula on a different worksheet, however, you must use the entire name 
(sheet name, exclamation point, and name).

Creating Names — Deleting Names  97
Creating multisheet names
Names can extend into the third dimension — across multiple worksheets in a 
workbook. Multisheet names must include contiguous worksheets and must 
refer to the same cell or range reference in each worksheet. To create a 
multisheet name, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Define Name 
button. Excel displays the New Name dialog box.
 2. 
In the Name text box, type a name (or use the name that Excel proposes, 
if any).
 3. 
In the Refers To text box, enter the reference (and remember to begin it 
with an equal sign). The format for a multisheet reference is
FirstSheet:LastSheet!RangeReference
 4. 
Click OK.
 
 An easier way to enter the reference in Step 3 is by pointing. Follow these steps 
after Step 2 (of the preceding list) to create a multisheet reference by pointing:
 1. 
Click the tab of the first worksheet in the range, if it isn’t already selected.
 2. 
Click the Refers To text box, and delete the suggested reference (which 
usually isn’t the one you want).
 3. 
Press and hold Shift, and click the tab of the last worksheet that you want 
to include in the reference.
 4. 
Select the cell or range in the first worksheet that you want to include in 
the name reference. The Refers To text box displays the multisheet range.
 5. 
Click OK.
Deleting Names
If you no longer need a defined name, you can delete it by following these steps:
 1. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Name Manager 
button. Excel displays the Name Manager dialog box.
 2. 
In the list, select the name that you want to delete and then click the 
Delete button. Excel asks you to confirm the deletion.
 3. 
Click OK to delete.

98  Part 6: Creating and Using Names
 
 If you change your mind after deleting the name, Excel allows you to undo 
the deletion. Click the undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press 
Ctrl+Z. Earlier versions of Excel don’t allow you to undo a name deletion.
 4. 
Select another name to delete or click Close to exit the Name Manager 
dialog box.
 
 Be careful when deleting names. If you use the name in a formula, deleting the 
name causes the formula to become invalid. (Excel displays #NAME?.)
 
 If you delete the rows or columns that contain named cells or ranges, the 
names contain an invalid reference. For example, if cell A1 on Sheet1 is named 
Interest and you delete row 1 or column A, Interest then refers to 
=Sheet1!#REF! (that is, an erroneous reference). If you use the name 
Interest in a formula, the formula displays #REF.
Editing Names
Editing names is simple with the Name Manager. You can modify the name, scope, 
comment, or reference. Follow these steps to edit a name in the workbook:
 1. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Name Manager 
button. Excel displays the Name Manager dialog box.
 2. 
In the list, select the name you want to change and then click the Edit 
button. Excel displays the Edit Name dialog box.
 3. 
Enter a new name, comment, reference, or scope for the name and then 
click OK.
 4. 
Select another name to edit or click Close to exit the dialog box.
Managing Names
It’s not unusual for a workbook to contain dozens, hundreds, or even thousands 
of defined names. This situation makes tasks such as deleting multiple names, 
renaming names, and finding broken names challenging. Excel provides a Name 
Manager dialog box that you can use to view and manage the defined names in a 
workbook, as shown in Figure 6-5. To display the Name Manager dialog box, 
click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Name Manager button.

Deleting Names — Managing Names  99
Figure 6-5
 
Using the Name Manager dialog, you can
 ✓ 
View information for existing defined names, such as name, value, scope, 
reference, and comment. See also “Creating sheet-level names,” earlier in 
this part, for a discussion of a name’s scope.
 ✓ 
Create new names by clicking the New button to display the New Name 
dialog box.
 ✓ 
Edit existing names by selecting the name and clicking the Edit button to 
display the Edit Name dialog box.
 ✓ 
Delete multiple names at once by selecting the names (hold down Shift or 
Ctrl to select the names) and clicking the Delete button.
 ✓ 
Sort any column by clicking the column header.
 ✓ 
Resize the dialog box so that you can see more information. Dragging the 
top or bottom side outward allows you to see more names. Dragging the 
right or left side outward allows you to see more information in the name 
window and longer references in the Refers To box.
 ✓ 
Filter the list of names based on common criteria by clicking the Filter 
button and selecting an option from the menu. The menu is separated into 
three filter categories and you can select (through successive mouse 
clicks) an option in each category.

100  Part 6: Creating and Using Names
Naming Constants and Formulas
Names that you use in Excel don’t need to refer to a cell or a range. You can give 
a name to a constant or even to a formula. If formulas in your worksheet refer to 
an interest rate (such as .085, or 8.5 percent), for example, you can define a 
name for this particular constant and then use it in your formulas. Alternatively, 
you can create a name that refers to a formula such as =SUM($A$1:$A$10) and 
use the name in your worksheet formulas.
To define a name for a constant or formula, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Define Name 
button. Excel displays the New Name dialog box.
 2. 
In the Name text box, type a name for the constant or formula.
 3. 
If needed, enter a comment in the Comment box. You can enter a 
comment, for example, to provide a description of the name for future 
worksheet auditing purposes.
 4. 
In the Refers To text box, enter the value for the constant or the expression 
for the formula. Normally, this field holds a cell or range reference, but 
you can also enter a value or formula.
 5. 
Click OK.
After performing these steps, you can use the name in your formulas.
Pasting Names into a Formula
If your formula uses named cells or ranges, you can type the name in place of 
the address. Another approach is to select the name from a list and have Excel 
insert the name for you automatically at your cursor location in the formula. 
You can do so in two ways:
 ✓ 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the Use in Formula button, and 
then select a name from the list.
 ✓ 
Press F3 to display the Paste Name dialog box, select a name from the list, 
and click OK.

Auditing Your Work
When your worksheets begin to get larger and more complex, ensuring accuracy 
becomes more difficult. That’s why, for all but the most basic spreadsheets, auditing 
is an important task. Auditing refers to the process of tracking down and identifying 
errors in your worksheet. Excel provides a set of interactive auditing tools as well as 
other tools that are useful in the auditing process (although these other tools are not 
dedicated to this purpose).

102  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
Checking for Specific Worksheet Errors
Excel can alert you regarding specific types of errors or potential errors in your 
worksheet. Excel can flag the following types of errors:
 ✓ 
Formulas that evaluate to error values (for example, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, 
or #N/A)
 ✓ 
Text dates (that is, dates you format as text or precede with an apostrophe) 
that you enter with two-digit years
 ✓ 
Numbers that you store as text (that is, numbers that you format as text or 
precede with an apostrophe)
 ✓ 
Inconsistent formulas in a region (that is, formulas that are different from 
formulas in surrounding cells)
 ✓ 
Formulas that omit cells in a region (for example, a formula that sums a 
range but omits the last cell or cells in the range)
 ✓ 
Unlocked cells that contain formulas if the worksheet is protected
 ✓ 
Formulas that contain references to empty cells
Remember: Use Excel’s suggestions to serve as a guide to potential errors in your 
worksheet. Excel may flag as errors data that you enter intentionally.
 
 Excel’s error-alert feature isn’t foolproof. You should use it with other techniques 
that we discuss in this part.
Checking for errors in the background
By default, Excel checks for worksheet errors in the background. If it identifies 
an error or a potential error, Excel displays an indicator in the upper-left corner 
of the offending cell. After you click the cell, Excel displays the Error Warning 
Smart Tag on the left side of the offending cell. If you hover the mouse pointer 
over the Error Warning Smart Tag, Excel displays a message that indicates the 
nature of the error, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1
 

Checking for Specific Worksheet Errors  103
To correct the error or to tell Excel to ignore it, click the Error Warning Smart 
Tag and select an option from the drop-down list that appears.
See also “Checking for errors manually,” immediately following this section.
Checking for errors manually
You may want to avoid the distraction of Excel’s automatic worksheet error 
checking and perform the error-checking task manually after you complete work 
on your spreadsheet model.
To turn off background error checking, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the File tab and then click the Options button.
 2. 
In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Formulas category.
 3. 
In the Error Checking section, deselect the Enable Background Error 
Checking check box.
 4. 
Click OK.
To check for worksheet errors manually, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the worksheet that you want to check for errors.
 
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Error Checking 
button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel displays the Error Checking 
dialog box and places the cell pointer in the first cell that it encounters 
containing an error or potential error. The dialog box indicates the nature 
of the error that you encounter in the cell, as shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2
 
 3. 
Click one of the four option buttons on the right side of the dialog box.
 4. 
Click Next to move to the next cell that contains an error or a potential 
error.
 
 An alternative to this procedure is to turn on background error checking after 
your spreadsheet model is complete and use the procedure in “Checking for 
errors in the background,” immediately preceding this section, for each cell that 
Excel flags with an error.

104  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
 
 You can control the types of errors that you want Excel to consider (automatically 
or through the manual procedure). Click the File tab and then click the Options 
button. Click the Formulas section on the left pane of the dialog box, and select 
or deselect the options in the Error Checking Rules area.
Checking Your Spelling
Excel uses a spell checker that works just like the feature you find in word-
processing programs. You can access the spell checker by using either of the 
following methods:
 ✓ 
Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the Spelling button.
 ✓ 
Press F7.
The extent of the spell checking depends on what you select before you access 
the dialog box.
What You Select
What Excel Checks
A single cell
The entire worksheet, including cell contents, notes, text in 
graphic objects and charts, and page headers and footers
A range of cells
Only that range
A group of characters 
Only the characters in the formula bar
If Excel encounters a word that isn’t in the current dictionary or is misspelled, it 
offers a list of suggestions that you can click to respond to.
Creating a Table of Names
You can create a list of all the names and associated name references in the 
workbook. This procedure may be useful for tracking down errors or as a way to 
document your work.
To create a table of names, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer to an empty area of your worksheet or add a new 
worksheet. (Excel creates the table at the active cell position.)
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow on the Use in 
Formula button, and then select Paste Names at the bottom of the list. (Or 
simply press F3.) Excel displays the Paste Name dialog box.
 3. 
Click the Paste List button and Excel creates your table of names.

 
 The list that Excel pastes overwrites any cells that get in the way, so make sure 
the active cell is in an empty portion of the worksheet.
Displaying Formulas in a Worksheet
One way to audit your workbook is to display the formulas rather than the 
results of the formulas. Then you can examine the formulas without needing to 
select cells individually.
 
 To display formulas instead of formula results, click the Formulas tab on the 
Ribbon and then click the Show Formulas button in the Formula Auditing 
group. (You can also press Ctrl+~.)
 
 You may want to create a new window for the workbook before issuing this 
command. That way, you can see the formulas in one window and the results in 
the other. See also “Creating Multiple Windows (Views) for a Workbook,” in Part 2.
Evaluating Parts of a Formula
Excel provides a tool that helps you evaluate (that is, calculate) parts of a formula 
and trace the precedents of parts of a formula. (Precedents are cells that are 
referenced in the formula part you’re evaluating.) The capability to evaluate 
parts of a formula can prove useful if you’re tracking down errors in formulas.
To evaluate parts of a formula, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the cell that contains the formula.
 
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Evaluate Formula 
button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel displays the Evaluate Formula 
dialog box. In the Reference area, the cell reference appears. The 
Evaluation preview box displays the formula with the first expression or 
cell reference underlined.
 3. 
To show the value of the underlined expression, click Evaluate. Excel 
italicizes the result of the expression.
 4. 
Repeat Step 3 as many times as necessary to evaluate all expressions in 
the formula.
 5. 
Use the Step In button to examine the formula that the underlined cell 
reference in the expression represents. Use the Step Out button to evaluate 
the current reference and return to the previous reference (see Figure 7-3).
 6. 
Click Close after you finish evaluating the formula.
Checking for Specific Worksheet Errors — Evaluating Parts of a Formula  105

106  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
Figure 7-3
 
Remember: The Step In button is not available if a cell reference is in a different 
workbook.
 
 The Evaluate Formula feature is an excellent tool to use when your formula 
returns an error value because you can examine and correct the part of the 
formula that is generating the error.
 
 A quick way to evaluate parts of a formula is to go into edit mode (by double-
clicking the cell or pressing F2), highlight the part of the formula that you want 
to evaluate, and press F9. Excel displays the result of the formula part. Press Esc 
to cancel. Do not press Enter; otherwise, Excel permanently replaces the part of 
the formula with the resulting value.
Finding Specific Data
If your worksheets contain lots of data, you may find locating a particular piece 
of information difficult. Excel can find the data for you.
To locate a particular value or sequence of text, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and choose Find 
from the menu. (Or simply press Ctrl+F.) Excel displays its Find and 
Replace dialog box with the Find tab selected, as shown in Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-4
 

Evaluating Parts of a Formula — Finding Specific Data  107
 2. 
In the Find What drop-down list box, enter the characters to search for. 
You can use the list also to select items that you previously searched for.
 3. 
If you want to make your search case-sensitive, select the Match Case 
check box. If the Match Case check box isn’t visible, click the Options 
button.
 4. 
To search for data with specific formatting:
 a. Click the Format button. (If the Format button isn’t visible, click the 
Options button.) Excel displays the Find Format dialog box.
 b. Click the appropriate tabs, and in each tab, specify the formatting that 
you’re looking for.
 c. After you complete your selections, click OK.
 
 
 If a cell in your worksheet already contains all the formatting you want to 
use in your search, click the arrow on the Format button and select 
Choose Format From Cell. Excel adds an eyedropper icon to the cursor. 
Click the cell with the required formatting.
 5. 
In the Within drop-down list box, select whether you want to look in the 
active sheet or the entire workbook. (If the Within drop-down box isn’t 
visible, click the Options button.)
 6. 
In the Search drop-down box, select the direction that you want to search, 
as follows:
 • Select By Rows to search across rows.
 • Select By Columns to search down columns.
 
 
 In most cases, your search goes faster if you select By Columns.
 7. 
In the Look In drop-down list box, specify what to look in: Formulas, 
Values, or Comments.
 8. 
Click the Find Next or Find All button. If you click Find Next, Excel selects 
the cell that contains what you’re looking for. If you click the Find All 
button, Excel displays a drop-down window that shows all references to 
the found data, either in the active worksheet or across the entire work-
book, depending on your selection in Step 5. Click a reference in the 
window to go directly to that cell.
 9. 
Click the Close button to end your search.
 
 For approximate searches, use wildcard characters. An asterisk represents any 
group of characters in the specified position, and a question mark represents 
any single character in the specified position. If you type w*h, for example, 
those letters represent all text that begins with w and ends with h. Similarly, b?n 
matches three-letter words such as bin, bun, and ban.

108  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
Remember: To find a cell or cells with specific formatting but containing no 
specific data, you can skip Step 2.
See also “Searching for Data to Replace,” in Part 4.
Handling Circular References
As you enter formulas, you may occasionally see a message from Excel that is 
similar to the one shown in Figure 7-5. This message indicates that the formula 
you just entered will result in a circular reference. A circular reference occurs if a 
formula refers to its own value (either directly or indirectly).
Figure 7-5
 
If Excel encounters a circular reference after you enter a formula, a message is 
displayed that enables you to correct the formula or to enter the formula as is. If 
you enter a formula with a circular reference, Excel displays a message in the 
status bar to remind you that a circular reference exists. Most of the time, a 
circular reference indicates an error that you must correct. In this case, you 
should click OK after Excel displays the message.
After you click OK in response to the circular reference message, Excel displays 
direct and indirect precedent arrows on the worksheet that loop back to the cell 
with the circular reference. These arrows help you trace the path of the circular 
reference. Excel also displays a help window, which provides further assistance 
for locating circular reference problems. Excel also displays the help viewer 
(help window), which displays help topics specific to working with circular 
references.
If you receive a workbook containing circular references, Excel displays a message 
on the status bar, as mentioned. To correct the problem, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
 
 2. 
In the Formula Auditing group, click the arrow on the Error Checking 
button, and then choose Circular References from the menu. Excel displays 
a list that includes the cell reference of the cell with the circular reference 
and the references of any other cells involved in the circular reference 
(see Figure 7-6).

Finding Specific Data — Handling Circular References  109
Figure 7-6
 
 3. 
Click a cell reference in the list. Excel positions the active cell pointer in 
the cell.
 4. 
To trace the path of the circular reference, click the Trace Precedents 
button on the Formulas tab on the Ribbon. Excel displays an arrow on the 
worksheet that points from the direct precedent of the cell.
 5. 
Click the Trace Precedents button again to add the first indirect prece-
dent of the cell (that is, the precedent of the direct precedent), click again 
to add the second indirect precedent (that is, the precedent of the first 
indirect precedent), and so on. Eventually, the precedent arrows loop 
back to the cell with the circular reference.
The trace precedents technique can be helpful in resolving many circular 
reference problems.
See also “Tracing Cell Relationships,” later in this part.
After you resolve the circular reference problem for a cell, if additional cells 
have circular reference problems, Excel continues to display the circular 
reference message on the status bar.
 
 Excel doesn’t tell you about a circular reference if the Iteration setting is on. You 
can check this setting by clicking the File tab, clicking the Options button, and 
then clicking the Formulas option section in the left pane. The Enable Iterative 
Calculation option is in the Calculation Options area on the right side of the 
dialog box. If iteration is on (that is, the Enable Iterative Calculation option is 
selected), Excel performs the circular calculation the number of times specified 
in the Maximum Iterations text box (or until the value changes by less than 
0.001 — or whatever value is in the Maximum Change text box).
Remember: In a few situations (known by advanced users), a circular reference is 
intentional. In these cases, the iteration setting must be on. However, it’s best to 
keep the iteration setting off so that Excel warns you of circular references.

110  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
Locating Errors by Selecting Special Cells
Excel’s ability to select specific types of cells can prove useful in your auditing 
work. For example, you can select all cells in the worksheet that contain formulas. 
(Excel highlights all such cells.) If Excel doesn’t select a cell in a region where it 
highlights other cells (for example, a formula row or column), that situation may 
indicate that you (or someone else) inadvertently overwrote the cell with a 
static value.
Follow these steps to select cells that meet your criterion:
 1. 
Click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and then choose 
an option in the middle part of the menu. The choices are Formulas, 
Comments, Conditional Formatting, Constants, and Data Validation. Excel 
highlights all the cells matching the criterion you chose.
 2. 
For additional criteria choices:
 a. Choose Go To Special on the Find & Select button menu. Excel dis-
plays the Go To Special dialog box.
 b. Select an option in the Go To Special dialog box.
 c. To get help on the options in the dialog box, click the help button (the 
question mark icon) in the dialog box title bar. Excel displays a help 
window. Click OK to close the window.
 3. 
Click OK. Excel selects all cells that match your selected criteria.
 
To get an overall view of the worksheet structure if you’re selecting special cells 
and to aid in tracking down potential errors, zoom out the worksheet to a small 
size. See “Zooming a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
 
 
Excel has some shortcut keys that you can use to select precedent and dependent 
cells without needing to use the Go To Special dialog box.

Locating Errors by Selecting Special Cells — Tracing Cell Relationships  111
Tracing Cell Relationships
Excel’s auditing tools can help you track down errors in your worksheet by 
drawing arrows (known as cell tracers) to precedent and dependent cells. A 
cell’s direct precedents are cells that are referenced in the cell’s formula. An 
indirect precedent is a cell that isn’t used directly in the formula but is used by 
a cell that you refer to in the formula. A cell’s dependents are formulas that 
reference the particular cell, either directly or indirectly.
Tracing precedents and dependents
To trace the precedents or dependents of a cell, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the cell that you want to trace.
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and do one of the following:
 • Click the Trace Precedents button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel 
draws arrows from all direct precedent cells.
 • Click the Trace Dependents button in the Formula Auditing group. 
Excel draws arrows to all direct dependent cells. See an example in 
Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7
 
 3. 
Repeat Step 2 (click the Trace Precedent or Trace Dependent button) 
as often as necessary to draw arrows to indirect precedent or indirect 
dependent cells.
 4. 
Double-click an arrow to move the cell pointer to a precedent cell or a 
dependent cell. If Excel displays a dashed line pointing to a miniature 
sheet icon, the precedent cells are on a different worksheet. Double-
clicking the dashed line displays the Go To dialog box. Click a cell 
reference in the Go To dialog box and then click OK.
 5. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon (if necessary) and then click the 
Remove Arrows button in the Formula Auditing group after you finish 
tracing the source of your error.

112  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
 
 If you are developing a large worksheet, this type of interactive tracing is often 
more revealing if you zoom out of the worksheet to display a larger area. See 
“Zooming a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
See also “Tracing formula error values,” immediately following this section.
Tracing formula error values
Often, an error in one cell (for example, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, or #NA) is the 
result of an error in a precedent cell. Excel helps you to identify the cell or cells 
that are causing the error value to appear.
To trace the source of the error value, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the cell that contains the error.
 
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, click the arrow on the Error 
Checking button in the Formula Auditing group, and choose Trace Error 
from the menu. Excel draws arrows to all direct precedent cells.
 3. 
Repeat Step 2 as often as necessary to draw arrows to indirect precedent 
cells.
 4. 
Double-click an arrow to move the cell pointer to a precedent cell.
 5. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon (if necessary) and click the Remove 
Arrows button in the Formula Auditing group after you finish tracing the 
source of your error.
See also “Understanding Formula Error Values,” which appears next, and 
“Tracing precedents and dependents,” earlier in this section.
Understanding Formula Error Values
Excel flags errors in formulas with a message that begins with a pound sign (#). 
This flag signals that the formula is returning an error value. You must correct 
the formula (or correct a cell that the formula references) to get rid of the error 
display.
Remember: If the entire cell is full of pound signs, the column isn’t wide enough 
to display the value (whether or not the value is an error).
The following table lists the types of error values that may appear in a cell that 
contains a formula.

Tracing Cell Relationships — Using Cell Comments  113
Error Value
Explanation
#DIV/0!
The formula is trying to divide by zero (an operation that’s not allowed on 
this planet). This error also occurs if the formula attempts to divide by an 
empty cell.
#NAME?
The formula uses a name that Excel doesn’t recognize. This error can happen 
if you delete a name that the formula uses or if you have unmatched quotes 
when using text.
#N/A
The error will occur, for example, if the formula refers (directly or indirectly) 
to a cell that uses #N/A or the NA() function to signal that data is not 
available. The error might also appear if a required argument is omitted from 
a worksheet function. A complete discussion of all the possible causes of 
this error is beyond the scope of this book.
#NULL!
The formula uses an intersection of two ranges that don’t intersect.
#NUM!
You have a problem with a value; for example, you’re specifying a negative 
number where Excel expects a positive number.
#REF!
The formula refers to a cell that isn’t valid. This error can happen if you’ve 
deleted the cell from the worksheet.
#VALUE!
The formula contains a function with an invalid argument, or the formula 
uses an operand of the wrong type (such as text where Excel expects a 
value).
Remember: A single error value can make its way to lots of other cells that 
contain formulas that depend on the cell.
See also “Tracing formula error values,” earlier in this part.
Using Cell Comments
The Excel Cell Comment feature enables you to attach a comment to a cell. 
Comments are useful for documenting a particular value, providing input 
instructions for users, or helping you remember what a formula does. After you 
move the mouse pointer over a cell that has a comment, the comment appears 
in a small box (see Figure 7-8).

114  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
Figure 7-8
 
Adding a cell comment
To add a comment to a cell, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell.
 2. 
Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the New Comment 
button. (You can also right-click the cell and choose New Comment from 
the contextual menu, or press Shift+F2.)
 3. 
In the text box, enter the text for the comment.
 4. 
After you finish, click any cell.
The cell displays a small red triangle to indicate that it contains a comment.
Editing a cell comment
To edit a comment, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell containing the comment.
 2. 
Click the Review tab on the Ribbon and then click the Edit Comment 
button. (You can also right-click the cell and choose Edit Comment from 
the contextual menu, or press Shift+F2.)
 3. 
Edit your comment in the text box displayed.
 4. 
After you finish, click any cell.
Viewing cell comments
Cells to which you attach a comment display a small red triangle in the 
upper-right corner. After you move the mouse pointer over a cell that contains 
a comment, Excel displays the comment.

Using Cell Comments — Using the Watch Window  115
To view all the comments in the worksheet, click the Review tab on the Ribbon 
and then click the Show All Comments button. Click Show All Comments again 
to remove the comment display.
 
 Zoom out of your worksheet to view more comments. See “Zooming a 
Worksheet,” in Part 3.
Using the Watch Window
If you’re attempting to track down certain problems with large spreadsheet 
models, the capability to display a window that shows the value of the formula 
cells if their associated precedents are in different parts of a worksheet, in 
different worksheets, or even in different open workbooks comes in handy. For 
example, this ability can be useful if you’re unsure of the results that Excel is 
generating in certain formula cells after you change the values in precedent cells 
(that is, the cells that the formula references either directly or indirectly). This 
way, if you make changes to precedent cells, you can see the result of formulas 
immediately in the window. Excel provides a Watch window to handle these 
situations.
Displaying and adding cells to the Watch window
To display and add cells to the Watch window, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cells that you want to watch.
 2. 
Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and then click the Watch Window 
button in the Formula Auditing group. Excel displays the Watch window.
 3. 
Click Add Watch. Excel displays the Add Watch dialog box, with the cell 
references that you selected in Step 1 already filled in.
 4. 
Click the Add button. Excel adds the cell references to the Watch window, 
as shown in Figure 7-9.
Figure 7-9
 
 5. 
To move the active cell pointer to the cell that an entry in the Watch 
window refers to, double-click the entry in the window.
 6. 
To add cells from other worksheets or open workbooks, switch to the 
other worksheet or workbook and repeat Steps 1–4.

116  Part 7: Auditing Your Work
 7. 
To close or hide the Watch window, click the Close button or click the 
Watch Window button on the Ribbon’s Formula tab.
 
 Instead of closing the Watch window, you can choose to dock it to one side of 
the screen. Click the title bar of the Watch window and then drag the window to 
any side of the screen.
To change the width of a column in the Watch window, drag the boundary on 
the right side of the column heading (the mouse pointer changes to a cross with 
a double-sided arrow). To resize the Watch window, drag any side of the 
window (the mouse pointer turns into a double-sided arrow.)
Remember: Cells that contain links to other workbooks appear in the Watch 
window only if the other workbooks are open.
 
 To select all the cells in a worksheet that contain formulas, do the following: In 
Step 1, click the Find & Select button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Go To 
Special from the menu, select Formulas in the Go To Special dialog box that 
appears, and click OK.
Removing cells from the Watch window
To remove cells from the Watch window, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell references in the Watch window that you want to remove. 
To select contiguous cell references, click the first reference, press and 
hold Shift, and click the last reference. To select noncontiguous references, 
press Ctrl and then click the cells.
 2. 
Click Delete Watch.

Formatting Your Data
You have a lot of control over the appearance of information that you enter into a 
cell. Changing the appearance of a cell’s content is known as formatting. Formatting 
data in a range can make your worksheet more readable and presentable. In this 
part, you discover how to apply Excel’s many formatting options.

118  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
Adding Borders to a Cell or a Range
People often use borders to group a range of similar cells or simply as a way to 
delineate rows or columns for aesthetic purposes.
To add borders around a cell or range, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range.
 
 2. 
Click the arrow on the Borders button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel 
displays the Borders menu.
 3. 
Choose a border style from the menu. Excel applies the border to your 
selection. In addition, the Borders button icon changes to reflect your 
border selection.
If the available styles on the menu aren’t what you want, follow these steps to 
select further options:
 1. 
At the bottom of the Borders menu, choose More Borders. Excel displays 
the Format Cells dialog box with the Borders tab selected.
 2. 
If you want to change the default color, choose a color for the border from 
the Color drop-down palette.
 3. 
In the Style area of the dialog box, select a line style.
 4. 
Select the border position(s) for the line style by clicking in the Text 
window or by clicking one or more buttons surrounding the Text window. 
To deselect a line in the Text window, click the line. Note that you can 
apply diagonal borders that extend through cells and ranges. Diagonal 
borders give the effect of the cells being “crossed out.”
 5. 
Click OK to apply the border(s) to your selection.
 
 If you use border formatting in your worksheet, you may want to turn off the 
grid display to make the borders more pronounced. Click the View tab on the 
Ribbon and then click the Gridlines option to remove its check mark.
Aligning Cell Contents
Excel’s default alignments are such that cell contents appear at the bottom, 
numbers are right-aligned, text is left-aligned, and logical values (True or False) 
are centered in cells. You can use Excel’s alignment tools to change the default 
alignments that Excel applies to cell contents. Figure 8-1 shows several alignment 
options discussed in this section.

Adding Borders to a Cell or a Range — Aligning Cell Contents  119
Figure 8-1
 
To apply a standard alignment option, select the cell or range that you want to 
align and then select one of the following options from the Alignment group on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab. (Hover the mouse pointer over an alignment option to 
display an Extended ScreenTip for the option.)
 ✓ 
Vertical alignment: The options are Top, Center, and Bottom. See cells 
A1:A3 in Figure 8-1.
 ✓ 
Horizontal alignment: The options are Left, Center, and Right. See cells 
A5:A7 in Figure 8-1.
 ✓ 
Indent: The options are Increase Indent and Decrease Indent. Multiple 
clicks on the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent buttons increase or 
decrease the indent further. See cells A11:A13 and A15:A17 in Figure 8-1.
 ✓ 
Orientation: Click the Orientation button to display a menu of predefined 
orientations. Excel adjusts the row height to display the text. If you don’t 
want this adjustment, you can use the Merge feature first (described 
shortly) to avoid a larger row height across the worksheet. See cells H3:K3 
in Figure 8-1.
 ✓ 
Wrap Text: Select this option when you want a long text entry to take up 
less horizontal area on the worksheet. See cells D3:F3 in Figure 8-1.
 ✓ 
Merge and Center: You can merge multiple cells into a single, larger cell. 
This feature enables you to have cells of unequal sizes. If you have a table 
that spans six columns, for example, you can merge six cells at the top to 
form a single larger cell for the table’s title. In Figure 8-1, cells E10:G10 are 
merged horizontally, and cells C12:C15 are merged vertically. Note the fol-
lowing rules when merging cells:

120  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
 • You can merge cells horizontally or vertically.
 • If a selection contains more than one nonempty cell, the merged cells 
contain the contents and formatting of the upper-left cell of the merged 
range.
 • Understanding that cells are merged — not the contents of cells — is 
important. Whenever you merge cells, you receive a warning if the 
selected range contains more than one nonempty cell.
 
 If you do not want to center your data when you merge cells, or if you want 
to unmerge cells, click the arrow on the Merge and Center button and then 
choose the appropriate option on the menu.
Changing the Appearance of Cell Contents
By default, Excel formats the information you enter into a worksheet by using 
the 11-point Calibri font. However, if you want to emphasize various parts of 
your worksheet, such as the headers in a list, you can apply a different font 
style, size, color, background, or attribute to the header cells.
To apply a standard formatting option, select the cell or range that you want to 
format and then select one of the following options from the Format group on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab:
 
 ✓ 
Font Face: Select a font face from the font picker drop-down list. To 
preview the change in the selected cell or range before you commit to the 
change, hover the mouse pointer over a font face in the list.
 
 ✓ 
Font Size: Select a font size from the font picker drop-down list. To pre-
view the change in the selected cell or range before you commit to the 
change, hover the mouse pointer over a font size in the list.
 
 ✓ 
Increase/Decrease Font Size: These buttons increase or decrease the font 
in the selected cell or range by 1 or 2 points.
 ✓ 
Font Style: The options are Bold, Italic and Underline. Click the arrow on 
the Underline button if you want to apply a double-underline to the con-
tents of your selected cell or range.
 
 You can also use the following shortcut keys to apply a standard font style 
to your selection: Ctrl+B for bold, Ctrl+I for italic, and Ctrl+U for underline.
 
 Remember: The Ribbon buttons and shortcut keys act as toggles. You can 
turn bold on and off, for example, by repeatedly pressing Ctrl+B (or click-
ing the Bold button).

Aligning Cell Contents — Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range  121
 
 ✓ 
Font Color: Click the Font Color button to apply the color that the button 
displays to the font in your selected cell or range. Click the arrow on the 
button to choose a color from the color palette.
 
 ✓ 
Background Color: Click the Background Color button to apply the cell back-
ground color that the button displays. Click the arrow on the button to select 
a color from the color palette.
Remember: If you choose fonts or colors that are part of a theme, the fonts or 
colors change if you change the workbook theme. See “Formatting with 
Themes,” in Part 1 for a discussion of theme fonts and colors and “Using Cell 
Styles,” later in this part.
Copying Formats
 
 The quickest way to copy the formats from one cell to another cell or range is to 
use the Format Painter button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the cell or range with the formatting attributes that you want to 
copy.
 
 2. 
Click the Format Painter button. Note that the mouse pointer appears as a 
miniature paintbrush.
 3. 
Select (paint) the cells to which you want to apply the formats.
 4. 
Release the mouse button, and Excel copies the formats.
 
 Double-clicking the Format Painter button causes the mouse pointer to remain a 
paintbrush after you release the mouse button. This paintbrush enables you to 
paint other areas of the worksheet with the same formats. To exit paint mode, 
click the Format Painter button again (or press Esc).
Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range
In addition to applying static formatting to your worksheet cells and ranges, you 
can format a cell or range based on the contents of the cell or range. Using 
Excel’s conditional formatting feature, you can format one or more cells based on 
the values in the cells, or you can format a range based on the relative values of 
the cells in the range. You may, for example, want to visually identify all cells in 
a range that exceed a certain value or you may want to highlight cells in a range 
having duplicate values.

122  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
You can apply any combination of the following standard formatting options 
when the criteria for formatting the cell are met: Number, Font, Border, and Fill. 
See also “Changing the Appearance of Cell Contents,” earlier in this part.
Formatting based on individual cell values
Excel provides several criteria that you can use to format individual cells. You 
can format cells based on
 ✓ 
The value in the cell.
 ✓ 
A formula. The formula must return a value of True or False for the 
condition to be applied. For example, to apply a format to cell C3 if the 
sum of the values in cells A1 to A10 is greater than 2500, you enter the 
following conditional formula for cell C3:
=SUM($A$1:$A$10)>2500
 
 The formula returns True if the sum of cells A1 to A10 is greater than 2500 
and False otherwise.
 
E
X
C
E
L
 
2

0
 
 In Excel 2010, your conditional formatting formulas can contain references 
to cells or ranges in a worksheet other than the one in which the formatting 
has been applied.
 ✓ 
The cells containing, not containing, beginning with, or ending with 
specific text. In a list of parts, for example, you can highlight part numbers 
that contain certain characters.
 ✓ 
The cells containing dates that match dynamic conditions, such as yester-
day, today, tomorrow, in the last 7 days, last week, this week, next week, 
last month, this month, or next month. Excel calculates the date based on 
your PC’s internal real-time clock, so you do not have to update the condi-
tion manually.
 ✓ 
The cells being blank or nonblank.
 ✓ 
The cells having or not having errors.
Follow these steps to conditionally format individual cells or a range of cells:
 1. 
Select the cell or range that you want to format conditionally.
 2. 
Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel 
displays a menu of conditional formatting options.
 3. 
Choose Highlight Cells Rules and then choose any option except Duplicate 
Values from the flyout menu. For example, to format a cell or range of 
cells if the values in the cells exceed a certain value, choose Greater Than 
from the flyout menu.

Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range  123
 4. 
In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 8-2), enter a value (or values in 
the case of Between) in the box on the left. (The label for this box changes 
depending on what you chose in Step 3.) Instead of entering a value in the 
Format Cells That Are box, you can click the mouse pointer in the box and 
point to a cell on the worksheet.
Figure 8-2
 
 5. 
If you see a formatting option you like in the drop-down list on the right, 
select the option and then click OK to apply the conditional format.
 6. 
If you don’t like any of the available formatting options:
 a. Select Custom Format at the bottom of the drop-down list. Excel dis-
plays the Format Cells dialog box.
 b. Select your formatting options on the Number, Font, Border, and Fill 
tabs as appropriate.
 c. Click OK to close the Format Cells dialog box, and then click OK again 
to apply the conditional format.
Remember: If the cell doesn’t meet the condition that you specify, it takes on the 
standard formatting for the cell.
 
 If you copy a cell containing conditional formatting, the conditional formatting 
applies to all copies.
Formatting based on values in a range
Excel 2010 provides several criteria that you can use to format cells based on a 
comparison of the cell values in a range. You can format cells in a range based on
 ✓ 
Duplicate or unique values
 ✓

Follow these steps to conditionally format a range of cells based on a compari-
son of the cells in the range:
 1. 
Select the range that you want to format conditionally.
 2. 
Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel 
displays a menu of conditional formatting options.
 3. 
Choose one of the following options:
 • To highlight duplicate or unique values in the range, choose Highlight 
Cells Rules and then choose Duplicate Values from the flyout menu.
 • To highlight the top N value cells, top N% rank cells, and so on, choose 
Top/Bottom Rules and then choose an option in the flyout menu.
 4. 
In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 8-3 for an example), select the 
value option on the left side.
Figure 8-3
 
 5. 
If you see a formatting option you like in the drop-down list, select the 
option and click OK to apply the conditional format.
 6. 
If you don’t like any of the available formatting options:
 a. Select Custom Format at the bottom of the list. Excel displays the 
Format Cells dialog box.
 b. Choose your formatting options on the Number, Font, Border, and Fill 
tabs as appropriate.
 c. Click OK to close the Format Cells dialog box, and then click OK again 
to apply the conditional format.

Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range  125
Applying multiple conditional formats to a cell or range
Excel allows you to specify more than one conditional format for a cell. For 
example, you can have different formatting for a cell based on the value in the cell.
In Excel 2007 and later, the number of conditional formats per cell is limited only 
by your PC’s memory. Also, Excel 2010 allows you to apply multiple conditional 
formats to a cell if more than one condition is True. For example, if one condi-
tional format applies a bold font when a formatting condition is True, and 
another makes the cell background color red when a second formatting condi-
tion is True, Excel applies both formats to the cell if the two conditions evaluate 
to True. If the formatting conflicts (for example, a red font and a green font), 
Excel applies only the first rule that meets the condition.
Follow these steps to add an additional conditional format for a cell or range:
 1. 
Select the cell or range that already contains one conditional format.
 2. 
Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and 
choose Manage Rules (at the bottom of the menu). Excel displays the 
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4.
Figure 8-4
 
 
 By default, the window in the bottom portion of the dialog box displays 
the conditional formatting rule(s) applied to the current selection. If you 
weren’t sure of the range in Step 1, you can click the Show Formatting 
Rules For drop-down list and select This Worksheet (or other worksheets 
in the workbook). The rules window then displays all the conditional for-
matting rules and the ranges to which the rule(s) apply. Make note of the 
range to which you want to add a new rule, exit the dialog box, and begin 
again at Step 1.
 3. 
In the dialog box, click the New Rule button. Excel displays the New 
Formatting Rule dialog box.

126  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
 4. 
In the Select a Rule Type list, choose a rule type. To apply standard condi-
tional formatting options (number, font, border, or patterns), do not select 
the first option in the window (Format All Cells Based on Their Values). 
The controls that appear initially in the Edit the Rules Description section 
depend on the rule type you chose.
 5. 
In the leftmost drop-down list in the Edit the Rules Description section, 
choose an option (for all choices in Step 4 except Use a Formula to 
Determine Which Cells to Format). New controls appear to the right of 
this drop-down list depending on your choice. Complete the requirements 
for the controls (for example, enter a value, enter a cell reference, or 
choose from a list).
 6. 
Click Format to display the Format Cells dialog box and select your for-
matting options from among the available tabs.
 7. 
Click OK to exit the dialog box, and click OK again to exit the New 
Formatting Rule dialog box. Excel returns you to the Conditional 
Formatting Rules Manager dialog box.
 8. 
Excel evaluates conditional formatting rules in the order listed in the 
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box. To change the evalua-
tion order of a rule, select the rule and click the up or down arrow to the 
right of the Delete Rule button.
 9. 
Click OK.
Editing or deleting a conditional format
Follow these steps if you want to edit a condition for a cell or range or delete a 
condition for a cell or range with multiple conditions:
 1. 
Select the cell or range that contains the conditional format you want to 
edit or delete.
 2. 
Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and 
then choose Manage Rules (at the bottom of the menu). Excel displays the 
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box.
 3. 
In the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, select the condi-
tion you want to edit or delete.
 4. 
Do one of the following:
 • To delete the condition, click Delete.
 • To edit the condition, click Edit. Make your changes in the Edit 
Formatting Rule dialog box that appears and then click OK.
 5. 
Click OK.

Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range — Formatting a Number  127
 
 
To quickly delete (clear) all conditional formatting rules for a cell or range, 
select the cell or range, click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab, choose Clear Rules from the menu, and then choose Selected Cells 
from the flyout menu. To quickly delete (clear) all conditional formatting rules 
for the active worksheet, choose Entire Sheet from the Clear Rules flyout menu.
Formatting a Number
Excel internally stores all numbers and dates that you enter in your worksheet 
as plain, unformatted numbers. You can use Excel’s built-in numeric and date/
time formats to make your data more readable and understandable. In addition, 
if you can’t find a suitable built-in format to fit your needs, you can create a 
custom number format.
Using Excel’s built-in number formats
Excel is smart enough to perform some number formatting for you automati-
cally. If you enter 9.6% into a cell, for example, Excel knows that you want to use 
a percentage format and applies it for you automatically. Similarly, if you use 
commas to separate thousands (such as 123,456) or a dollar sign to indicate 
currency (such as $123.45), Excel applies the appropriate formatting for you.
Use the buttons in the Number group on the Ribbon’s Home tab to quickly apply 
common number formats. After you click one of these buttons, the active cell 
takes on the specified number format.
 
 You can select among several currency symbols by clicking the arrow on the 
Accounting Number Format button in the Number group on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab and choosing a symbol from the menu.
To access additional number formats, click the arrow on the Number Format 
drop-down list above the number format buttons and select an option from the 
list.
If none of the predefined number format buttons or Number Format list options 
fit the bill, you need to use the Format Cells dialog box. Follow these steps to 
select an option from the Format Cells dialog box:
 1. 
Select a cell or range of cells you want to format.
 2. 
Click the arrow on the Number Format drop-down list and select More 
Number Formats at the bottom of the list; or click the Number dialog 
launcher button at the bottom right of the Number group container. Excel 
displays the Format Cells dialog box with the Number tab selected.

128  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
 3. 
In the Category list box, select one of the categories. After you choose a 
category, the right side of the dialog box changes to display the appropri-
ate options.
 4. 
Choose an option from the right side of the dialog box. The top of the 
dialog box displays a sample of how the active cell appears with the 
number format you chose.
 5. 
Click OK to apply the number format to all the selected cells.
Remember: If the cell displays a series of pound signs (such as ####), it means 
the column isn’t wide enough to display the value using the number format you 
chose. The solution is to make the column wider or to change the number 
format. See “Changing column width,” later in this part.
Creating custom number formats
Excel provides many predefined number formats, but if none of these formats 
are satisfactory, you need to create a custom number format. Just follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Complete Steps 1 to 3 for accessing the Format Cells dialog box as 
detailed in the preceding section, but in Step 3, select Custom in the 
Category list box.
 2. 
Construct a number format by selecting an option from the list box on the 
right or by specifying a series of codes in the Type text box (located 
above the list box). In the Type text box, you can also modify a code you 
select from the list box. The Sample area shows how an entry in the active 
cell will be displayed with the code specified in the Type text box.
 3. 
Click OK to store the custom number format and apply it to the selected 
cells. The custom number format is now available for you to use with 
other cells in the workbook.
 
 To find out more about the meaning of custom formatting codes, check out this 
online resource:
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP051986791033.
aspx
After reviewing the online information, it will become clearer how Excel 
constructs its built-in number formats. Click a cell with a built-in format, and 
then display the Format Cells dialog box as already described and select the 
custom option in the Category list box. The text box on the right of the dialog 
box displays the formatting code for the built-in format. If you want, you can 
create a custom format by modifying a built-in format.

Formatting a Number — Formatting a Range Using Comparative Visualizations  129
Remember: Excel stores custom number formats with the workbook. To make 
the custom format available in a different workbook, you must copy a cell that 
uses the custom format to the other workbook.
Formatting a Range Using Comparative Visualizations
Comparative Visualizations allow you to compare the relative values in a range 
visually. Excel uses special conditional formatting within the cells to make this 
relative comparison. Visual comparisons are particularly useful if you have a lot 
of data to analyze because you can quickly detect anomalies, spot outliers (a 
value far from most others in a data set), compare performance (good, bad, or 
neutral), and so on. Excel provides the following three special conditional for-
matting tools for comparing the relative values in a range:
 ✓ 
Data bar: Uses horizontal bars to compare the relative sizes of values in 
the range.
 ✓ 
Color scale: Uses color gradients (such as various shades of red, amber, 
and green) to compare the variation of values in the range.
 ✓ 
Icon set: Uses a set of icons (for example, up, down, and horizontal 
arrows) to compare values in the range.
Figure 8-5 shows examples of each visualization type.
Figure 8-5
 
Using a visualization to compare values in a range
To use a visualization to compare relative values in a range, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the range.
 2. 
Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel 
displays a menu of conditional formatting options.
 3. 
Choose one of the following options from the menu:

130  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
 • Data Bars: Choose a bar color from the flyout menu. By default, Excel 
uses the highest and lowest values in the range to draw the longest and 
shortest bar, respectively.
 
E
X
C
E
L

 Excel 2010 provides a choice of bars with a gradient fill or a solid fill — 
either with or without a border. Also in Excel 2010, data bars are pro-
portional to the corresponding cell values. A zero value in a cell 
displays no bar, and negative values can display bars in a direction 
opposite to that of positive value bars.
  The data bar behavior in Excel 2010 is different from that in Excel 2007. 
In Excel 2007, the lengths of the bars were not proportional to the cor-
responding cell values. For example, a zero value displayed a bar, and 
negative values displayed bars in the same direction as positive values. 
In Excel 2007, you could not use the bars to compare values in the cell 
range.
 • Color Scales: Choose a color scale from the flyout menu. By default, 
Excel uses the lowest, highest, and midpoint values in the range to 
determine the color gradients.
 • Icon Sets: Choose an icon set from the flyout menu. You can choose 
icon sets having three, four, or five icons. By default, Excel uses per-
centages to determine the threshold between icons. In the case of a 
three-icon set, for example, Excel sets 33% and 67% as the thresholds 
between the three icons.

 In Excel 2010, you can mix icons from different sets and choose 
whether or not to display an icon for each threshold in the range of 
numbers. For example, you may decide to display an icon only when 
the values in a range are below a specific threshold.
 
 If you hover the mouse pointer over an option in a flyout menu, Excel 
shows a preview of the visualization that will be applied to the range.
Modifying the visualization for a range
After you create a visualization for a range, you can modify the visualization in 
several ways. You can use a different visualization, change the type of compari-
son among the values in the range, or display the visualization without the cell 
values.
Follow these steps to modify the visualization for a range:
 1. 
Select the range that contains the visualization you want to edit.
 2. 
Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and 
then choose Manage Rules (at the bottom of the menu). Excel displays the 
Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box.

Formatting a Range Using Comparative Visualizations  131
 3. 
In the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, click the Edit 
Rule button. If you have more than one conditional formatting rule applied 
to a range, select the rule you want to modify in the window before click-
ing the Edit Rule button. Excel displays the Edit Formatting Rule dialog 
box. See Figure 8-6.
Figure 8-6
 
 4. 
In the Select a Rule Type list, ensure that Format All Cells Based on Their 
Values is selected.
 5. 
To change the visualization in the selected range, select a new option in 
the Format Style drop-down list.
 6. 
If you want a different comparison for the relative values in the range, first 
make a selection in the Type drop-down list. The options are Lowest or 
Highest value (applicable to data bars and color scales), Number, Percent, 
Percentile, and Formula.
 7. 
Next, enter values for the type of comparison you chose. The Value option 
is not available if you choose Lowest Value or Highest Value for the com-
parison type. The values you enter have different meaning for the visual-
ization you chose. For data bars, the values and comparison type combine 
to determine the bar length for each value in the selected range. For color 
scales, the values and comparison type combine to determine the color 
assigned to each value in the selected range. For icon sets, the values and 
comparison type combine to determine the icon assigned to each value in 
the selected range.

132  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
 8. 
Select display options depending on the type of visualization you selected 
in Step 5 (Data bar, Color scale, or Icon set):
  Data bars: Select bar appearance options from the appropriate drop-
down boxes. You can change Fill (gradient or solid), Color, Border (no 
border or solid border), Border Color (for solid border), and Bar 
Direction (context, left-to-right, or right-to-left).
  Click the Negative Value and Axis button to display the Negative Value 
and Axis dialog box. From here, you can change the fill color and 
border color for negative value bars, and the position of the axis in the 
cells, which is used to delineate negative and positive value bars. You 
can choose to display no axis, in which case both positive and negative 
bars are in the same direction (not the best choice in most cases). Click 
OK to return to the previous dialog box.
  Color scales: Select colors for the lowest, highest, and midpoint values 
(3-color scale only).
  Icon sets: Choose a “base” set from the Icon Style drop-down gallery. If 
you want to change the icon display choice for a value rule, click the 
appropriate Icon drop-down arrow on the left of the appropriate rule. 
Next select a new icon from the gallery, or select No Cell Icon.
 
 If you want to display data bars or icons in the selected range without the 
associated values, select the Show Bar Only or Show Icon Only check box 
(available after you choose a data bar or icon set format style, 
respectively).
 9. 
Click OK to return to the Rules Manager dialog box, and then click OK to 
exit and apply your changes.
Hiding Cell Contents
You can hide the contents of a cell by using either of the following formatting 
options:
 ✓ 
Apply a custom number format consisting of three semicolons (;;;). See 
“Creating custom number formats,” earlier in this part.
 ✓ 
Make the text color the same as the background color. See “Changing the 
Appearance of Cell Contents,” earlier in this part.
Both formatting techniques have the same flaw: If the active cell pointer is on the 
cell, its contents are visible in the formula bar. To avoid this flaw and make the 
cell contents truly invisible, you should protect the worksheet after you choose 
one of the preceding options. See also “Protecting a Worksheet,” in Part 3.

Formatting a Range Using Comparative Visualizations — Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows  133
Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows
Hiding columns and rows is useful if you don’t want users to see particular infor-
mation or if you don’t want some information to print. Alternatively, you can 
unhide rows or columns to reveal information.
Hiding columns and rows
To hide one or more columns or rows, choose one of the following options:
 ✓ 
Select any cell(s) on the worksheet in the column(s) or row(s) that you 
want to hide. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪Hide & 
Unhide➪Hide Columns, or choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Hide Rows.
 ✓ 
Select the column or row header(s) you want to hide. See “Selecting entire 
rows and columns,” in Part 4. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose 
Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Hide Columns, or choose Format➪Hide & 
Unhide➪Hide Rows. Alternatively, right-click the selected row or column 
header(s) and choose Hide from the contextual menu.
 ✓ 
Drag a column header’s right border all the way to the left or a row head-
er’s bottom border all the way upward.
Remember: A hidden column or row has a width or height of 0. If you use the 
arrow keys to move the active cell pointer, you skip cells in hidden columns or 
rows. In other words, you can’t use the arrow keys to move to a cell in a hidden 
row or column.
See also the next section, “Unhiding columns and rows.”
Unhiding columns and rows
Unhiding a hidden row or column can prove a bit tricky because you can’t 
directly select a row or column that’s hidden.
To unhide one or more column(s) or row(s), choose one of the following 
options:
 ✓ 
Select any cells on the worksheets on either side of the column(s) or row(s) 
that you want to unhide. In Figure 8-7, for example, if you want to unhide col-
umns E and F, select any row on the worksheet and select cells in columns D 
and G. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide 
Columns, or choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows.
 ✓ 
Select the column or row header(s) on either side of the row(s) or 
column(s) you want to unhide. See “Selecting entire rows and columns,” in 
Part 4. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide 
Columns, or choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows. Alternatively, 
right-click the selected row or column header(s) and choose Unhide from 
the contextual menu.

134  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
Figure 8-7
 
 
 To unhide all hidden columns or rows, select the entire worksheet (by pressing 
Ctrl+A or clicking the blank box that intersects the row and column headings). 
Then choose Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Columns, or choose Format➪Hide 
& Unhide➪Unhide Rows
Modifying Cell Size
You may want to change the width of a column if it’s not wide enough to display 
values (indicated when the column displays a series of pound signs — 
#######) or to simply space out the cells horizontally. Changing the row height 
is useful for spacing out rows and is sometimes better than inserting empty 
rows between rows of data.
Changing column width
To change the width of one or more columns, choose one of the following 
options:
 ✓ 
Select any cell(s) on the worksheets in the column(s) that you want to 
adjust. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Format button, choose Width 
from the menu, and enter a value in the Column Width dialog box that 
appears. Alternatively, choose AutoFit Selection from the menu. This com-
mand adjusts the width of the selected column(s) so that the widest entry 
in the column fits.
 ✓ 
Drag the right border of the column heading with the mouse until the 
column is the width that you want. As you drag, Excel displays a ScreenTip 
that shows the current column width (see Figure 8-8). If you select multiple 
column headers and drag the right border of any one of the column head-
ers, all columns adjust accordingly.

Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows — Modifying Cell Size  135
Figure 8-8
 
 ✓ 
Double-click the right border of a column heading to automatically set the 
column width to the widest entry in the column. If you select multiple 
column headers and double-click the right border of any one of the column 
headers, each column width is set automatically to the widest entry in the 
column.
 ✓ 
Select the column heading(s) of the column(s) you want to adjust. Right-
click the column header(s), choose Column Width from the contextual 
menu, and enter a value in the Column Width dialog box that appears.
 
 To change the default width of all columns, click the Format button and choose 
Default Width from the menu. This command opens the Standard Width dialog 
box, in which you enter the new default column width. All columns that weren’t 
previously adjusted take on the new column width.
Changing row height
You measure row height in points (a standard unit of measurement in the print-
ing trade; 72 points equal 1 inch). To change the height of one or more rows, 
choose one of the following options:
 ✓ 
Select any cell(s) on the worksheets in the row(s) that you want to adjust. 
On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Format button, choose Height from 
the menu, and enter a value in the Row Height dialog box that appears.
 ✓ 
Drag the bottom border of the row heading with the mouse until the row is 
the height that you want. As you drag, Excel displays a ScreenTip that 
shows the current row height. If you select multiple row headers and drag 
the bottom border of any one of the row headers, all rows adjust 
accordingly.
 ✓ 
Select the row heading(s) of the row(s) that you want to adjust. Right-click 
the row header(s), choose Row Height from the contextual menu, and 
enter a value in the Row Height dialog box that appears.
Remember: Excel adjusts the row height automatically to accommodate the tall-
est entry in the row.

136  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
Using Cell Styles
If you find yourself continuously applying the same combination of fonts, lines, 
shading, number format, and so on to cells or ranges in your worksheet, using 
cell styles instead will save you time.
Excel provides a Cell Styles gallery with several predefined styles (see Figure 
8-9.) You can modify a predefined style or create a new style from scratch. The 
Cell Styles gallery includes Titles and Headings styles and Themed Cell Styles 
categories that change if you change the workbook theme. The default font used 
for styles in the other predefined categories in the gallery matches the body font 
of the selected theme and therefore changes as the theme changes. See also 
“Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Figure 8-9
 
A cell style can include any combination of the following formatting elements:
 ✓ 
Number format
 ✓ 
Font (type, size, and color)
 ✓ 
Alignment (vertical and horizontal)
 ✓ 
Border
 ✓ 
Pattern
 ✓ 
Protection (locked and hidden)
Applying a predefined cell style
Follow these steps to apply a predefined style:

Using Cell Styles  137
 1. 
Select the cell or range to which you want to apply the style. You can 
select a contiguous or noncontiguous range. See also “Selecting Cells and 
Ranges,” in Part 4.
 2. 
Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Excel displays a 
gallery of predefined styles.
 3. 
Choose a style from the gallery to immediately apply the style. If you hover 
the mouse pointer over a style, Excel provides a preview of the style in your 
selected cell or range. The style is not applied until you click it.
The Cells Styles gallery includes a few categories with styles that you can use as 
a guide for representing certain types of data. For example, you can use the 
Good, Bad, and Neutral styles to highlight data in your worksheet that’s consid-
ered good, bad, or neutral. You can use the Data and Model styles to represent 
input cells, cells that involve calculations (formulas), and so on. These two style 
categories use a theme font and non-theme colors. If you select a new theme for 
the workbook, the font changes to match the new theme but the colors remain 
unchanged.
Select a style from the Themed Cell style category if you want to format a range 
to match other elements on the worksheet that use theme styles (a chart, for 
example). If you change the theme applied to the workbook, the formatting of 
the range changes to match the new theme.
See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Modifying an existing style
The Cell Styles gallery is an example of the Ribbon’s results-oriented approach, 
providing predefined layouts that you’re likely to be satisfied with. However, if 
none of the available styles are exactly what you want but are close, you can 
simply modify an existing style rather than create a new style from scratch. For 
example, you might be happy with a certain style’s font and background color 
but not the number format, or you might like the number format and font but 
not the background color.
Follow these steps to modify an existing style:
 1. 
Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, right-click a style, 
and choose Modify from the menu that appears. Excel displays the Style 
dialog box.
 2. 
If you want, type a new name for the style in the Style Name box.
 3. 
In the Style Includes section, click to add or clear a check mark next to the 
formatting elements you want to include or not include in the modified 
style.

138  Part 8: Formatting Your Data
 4. 
Click the Format button. Excel displays the Format Cells dialog box.
 5. 
Select the appropriate tabs and formatting options you want.
 6. 
Click OK to exit the Format Cells dialog box and click OK again to close 
the Style dialog box. Excel updates the style in the gallery with the 
changes you made.
Creating a custom cell style
If none of the styles available in the Cell Styles gallery meet your needs either 
directly or by modifying a style, you can create a style from scratch. Follow 
these steps to create a custom cell style:
 1. 
Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and then choose 
New Cell Style (at the bottom of the gallery). Excel displays the Style 
dialog box.
 2. 
In the Style Name box, type a name for the style.
 3. 
Complete Steps 3 to 6 in the section “Modifying an existing style,” 
immediately preceding this section. Excel adds the style to a new Custom 
category section it creates in the Cell Styles gallery.
Copying (merging) cell styles from another workbook
If you modify existing styles or create several custom styles in a workbook, you 
may want these styles to appear in other workbooks. Merging styles from 
another workbook can save a lot of time because you don’t have to recreate the 
styles manually in every new workbook in which you want to use the styles.
Follow these steps to merge a style from another workbook:
 1. 
Ensure that the workbook from which you want to merge the styles is 
open.
 2. 
Activate the workbook you want to merge the styles to.
 3. 
Click the Cell Styles button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and then choose 
Merge Styles (at the bottom of the gallery). Excel displays the Merge 
Styles dialog box.
 4. 
In the Merge Styles From list box, select the workbook from which you 
will be merging the styles and click OK.
 5. 
Excel asks you to confirm whether you want to merge styles with the 
same names as styles in the workbook that you’re merging to. In most 
cases, you want to click No. Excel merges the styles into the active 
workbook.
 6. 
To view the merged styles, click the Cell Styles button.

 Excel 2010 consolidates page and printer settings on the Print tab in the 
Backstage view. See also “Going Backstage,” in Part 1. Figure 9-1 shows the 
options on the Print tab. Most of these options include brief explanatory text or 
are otherwise self-explanatory.
Setting page and printer options
Click the File tab on the Ribbon to enter the Backstage view. Then click the Print 
tab. Use the following options on the Print tab to adjust printer settings. Note 
that if your printer doesn’t support a specific feature, the option won’t appear in 
the tab. (For example, if your printer doesn’t support double-sided printing, you 
won’t see that option.) Therefore, the list you see will be different depending on 
the capabilities of your printer:
 ✓ 
Copies: Use the Copies spinner control to specify the number of copies 
you want to print.
 ✓ 
Printer: The printer drop-down gallery button displays the current printer 
selection. Click the button and choose another printer, if required.
 ✓ 
Printer Properties: Click the Printer Properties link below the printer 
drop-down gallery button to display and modify properties for the selected 
printer.
 ✓ 
Print range: By default, this drop-down gallery button displays Print Active 
Sheets. Click the button to select a different option from the galley menu.
 
 Normally, if you have print areas set for one or more worksheets, Excel 
prints only the print area range or ranges (data outside the print area is not 
printed). If you want to override the print area settings, select the Ignore 
Print Area option at the bottom of the gallery menu. Excel places a check 
mark next to the option to indicate that it’s set. Select the option again to 
clear the setting. See also “Setting the Print Area,” later in this part.
 ✓ 
Pages: Use the Pages spinner controls to specify the range of pages you 
want to print.
 ✓ 
One- or two-sided printing: By default, this drop-down gallery button dis-
plays Print One Sided. Click the button to select a two-sided option, if 
required.
 ✓ 
Collation: By default, this drop-down gallery button displays the Collated 
option. Click the button to select the Uncollated option, if required.
 ✓ 
Page orientation: By default, this drop-down gallery button displays 
Portrait Orientation. Click the button to select Landscape Orientation, if 
required.

Adjusting Page and Printer Settings  141
 ✓ 
Page size: By default, this drop-down gallery button displays the Letter 
option. Click the button to select a different size option from the galley menu.
 
 If the size you want isn’t listed, choose More Paper Sizes at the bottom of 
the gallery menu. In the dialog box that appears, choose a size from the 
Page Size drop-down list.
 ✓ 
Margins: By default, this drop-down gallery button displays the Normal 
Margins option. Click the button to select a different option from the galley 
menu.
 
 
 If you need finer control over the margin settings, or if you want to center 
your printed output, choose Custom Margins at the bottom of the gallery 
menu. Excel displays the Page Setup dialog box with the Margins tab 
selected. Use the spinner controls to change the margin values and the 
check boxes for centering the output on the page.
 ✓ 
Scaling: By default, this drop-down gallery button displays No Scaling. 
Click the button to select a different scaling option from the galley menu.
 
 
 If you need finer control over scaling, choose Custom Scaling Options at 
the bottom of the gallery menu. Excel displays the Page Setup dialog box 
with the Page tab selected. Make your adjustments in the Scaling section of 
the tab.
Previewing your pages
The Print tab includes a convenient Print Preview area, as shown in Figure 9-1. 
Navigate between successive pages by using the arrows at the bottom-left of 
this area, or go directly to a specific page by entering a page number in the 
Current Page box and pressing Enter.
At the bottom-right of the Print Preview area are the Show Margins and Zoom to 
Page buttons. Click the Show Margins button to toggle on and off the display of 
margin lines. When the margin lines are displayed, you can adjust the margins 
by dragging the lines with the mouse. There are two sets of horizontal margin 
lines. One set controls header and top page margins, and the other set controls 
the footer and bottom page margins for the print range.
Click the Zoom to Page button to toggle between zooming out to see an entire 
page and zooming in for a closer look at the page contents. You may not see 
much difference between the two zoom modes, depending on the page size and 
screen resolution. When you zoom out, you can use the scroll bar to scroll 
through all the pages that you will be printing. When you zoom in, the scroll bar 
allows you to see more of a page — if you set a sufficiently large page size, or 
have relatively low screen resolution, or both.

Changing the Worksheet Display Mode
Excel provides the following two special worksheet display modes that you can 
work in with documents that you intend to print:
 ✓ 
Page break preview: This display mode shows a bird’s-eye view of your 
worksheet with lines indicating the location of page breaks and page 
number watermarks identifying the pages. This display mode is useful for 
setting or adjusting manual page breaks.

Adjusting Page and Printer Settings — Handling Page Breaks  143
 ✓ 
Page layout view: The new page layout view shows your work in the 
context of the printed page (see Figure 9-2). This display mode has the 
following characteristics:
 • It shows individual pages with headers and footers, margins, page 
orientation, and common worksheet print settings (such as row and 
column headers or row and column data labels if selected).
 • The view is fully editable, so that you can use this mode in lieu of the 
normal display mode for any document you intend to print. Note, 
however, that you will see less data on-screen than in the normal 
display mode.
 • Pages that will not print are shaded and contain the phrase Click to add 
data watermark.
You can switch between display modes easily by clicking a display mode button 
on the right side of the status bar (see Figure 9-2) or by clicking a mode button 
on the Ribbon’s View tab.
Handling Page Breaks
If you print multiple-page reports, you know that controlling page breaks is often 
important. You normally don’t want a row to print on a page by itself, for exam-
ple. Excel handles page breaks automatically. After you print or preview your 
worksheet, Excel displays dashed lines on the worksheet in normal display 
mode to indicate where page breaks occur. Sometimes, you want to force a page 
break — either a vertical or a horizontal one. If your worksheet consists of sev-
eral distinct areas, for example, you may want to print each area on a separate 
sheet of paper.
Inserting manual page breaks
To override Excel’s automatic handling of page breaks, you must manually 
insert one or more page breaks. To insert a horizontal page break, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer to the row where you want to begin the new page, 
but make sure that the cell pointer is in column A. (Otherwise, you insert 
a vertical page break and a horizontal page break.)
 2. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Page Break button, and 
choose Insert Page Break from the menu. Excel inserts the page break in 
the row that is above the cell pointer.

Move the cell pointer to the column where you want to begin the new 
page, but make sure that the cell pointer is in row 1. (Otherwise, you 
insert a horizontal page break and a vertical page break).
 2. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Breaks button, and 
choose Insert Page Break from the menu. Excel inserts the page break in 
the column to the left of the cell pointer.
 
 You can often get a better perspective of where to insert breaks in your 
worksheet by creating your page breaks in the page break preview display 
mode. See “Previewing and adjusting page breaks,” later in this section.

Handling Page Breaks  145
Removing manual page breaks
To remove a manual page break, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer anywhere in the first row below a horizontal page 
break or in the first column to the right of a vertical page break.
 2. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Breaks button, and 
choose Remove Page Break from the menu.
 
 To remove all manual page breaks in the worksheet, click the Page Layout tab 
on the Ribbon, click the Breaks button, and choose Reset All Page Breaks from 
the menu.
Previewing and adjusting page breaks
Click the Page Break Preview button on the right side of the status bar or click 
the Page Break Preview button on the Ribbon’s View tab to enter the page break 
preview mode. This mode displays your worksheet in a way that enables you to 
move the page breaks by dragging them with your mouse (see Figure 9-3). This 
view doesn’t show a true page preview. (For example, it doesn’t show headers 
and footers.) But it’s an easy way to make sure that the pages break at desired 
locations.
Figure 9-3
 
Remember the following points as you use the page break preview mode:

146  Part 9: Previewing and Printing Your Work
 ✓ 
Excel automatically zooms out so that you can see more on-screen. You 
can set the zoom factor to any value that you want by using the zoom con-
trols on the status bar.
 ✓ 
If you specify a print area (rather than the entire worksheet), the print area 
appears in white and all the other cells appear in a darker color.
 ✓ 
You can adjust a page break by dragging the line that identifies a break 
location.
 ✓ 
In this display mode, Excel shows manual page breaks as solid lines and 
automatic breaks as dashed lines.
 ✓ 
While you’re previewing the page breaks, you have full access to all Excel 
commands.
Remember: If you increase the amount of information to be printed on a page 
having a manual break, Excel automatically scales the output to fit the page.
Inserting a Header or Footer
A header is information that appears at the top of each printed page. A footer is 
information that appears at the bottom of each printed page.
Headers and footers each have three sections: left, center, and right. You can, 
for example, specify a header that consists of your name left-justified, the work-
sheet name centered, and the page number right-justified.
The easiest way to include a header or footer in your printouts is to add the 
header or footer in the header and footer regions of the page layout view mode 
(see Figure 9-4). Either click the Page Layout View button, on the right side of 
the status bar, or click the Page Layout View button on the Ribbon’s View tab to 
enter the page layout view mode.
The header and footer regions in the page layout view have the following 
characteristics:
 ✓ 
The regions appear immediately above and below the worksheet data area.
 ✓ 
If the header or footer regions are empty, the center section of each region 
includes a watermark. The header watermark is labeled Click to add header 
and the footer watermark is labeled Click to add footer.
 ✓ 
If you hover the mouse pointer over a header or footer section, Excel 
shades the section to indicate the area that the section covers. Simply 
click in a section to add information.
 ✓ 
By default, the same header and footer appears on each page.

Handling Page Breaks — Inserting a Header or Footer  147
 ✓ 
Excel displays the information in the header or footer area as it would 
appear on the printed page.
Figure 9-4
 
Remember: By default, Excel doesn’t automatically include a header or footer in 
your printouts if you don’t specify any information to include in the header or 
footer.
Selecting a predefined header or footer
To select a predefined header or footer, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the Page Layout View by clicking the Page Layout View button on 
the status bar or on the Ribbon’s View tab.
 2. 
Click in a section of the header or footer region. The Ribbon displays the 
Header & Footer Tools contextual tab header on Excel’s title bar and the 
Design tab below the header.
 3. 
If necessary, click the Design tab to display the header/footer tools on the 
Ribbon.
 4. 
Click the Header or Footer button and choose an option from the menu.
 5. 
Click anywhere in the worksheet to remove the display of the header/
footer tools on the Ribbon. Excel inserts the selected header or footer in 
the page.
Remember: You can insert the header/footer information in any page of your 
document and Excel will automatically apply the header/footer to all other 
pages. See also “Using multiple headers and footers in your reports,” later in this 
section.

148  Part 9: Previewing and Printing Your Work
Creating a custom header or footer
To define a custom header or footer, follow these steps:
 1. 
Complete Steps 1 to 3 in “Selecting a predefined header or footer,” 
immediately preceding in this section.
 2. 
Enter the desired information in any or all of the three sections of the 
header or footer; or click any of the eight buttons in the Header and 
Footer Elements group (described in the following table) to enter a special 
code.
Button
Code

Enables you to choose a picture to insert in the 
header or footer
 
 After you click away from the section in which you added a code, Excel 
converts the code to the information that will appear on the printed page.
 3. 
If you need to format the header or footer text, click the Ribbon’s Home 
tab and select from the available tools in the Font group.
 4. 
Click anywhere in the worksheet to remove the display of the header/
footer tools on the Ribbon.
The Format Picture button in the Header and Footer Elements group is available 
only if you insert a picture in the header or footer. Clicking this button displays 
the Format Picture dialog box, where you can select options to size, rotate, 
scale, crop, and adjust the picture.
 
 You can combine text and codes and insert as many codes as you want into 
each section. If the text that you enter uses an ampersand (&), you must enter it 
twice (because Excel uses an ampersand to signal a code). For example, to enter 
the text Research & Development into a header or footer, type Research && 
Development.

Inserting a Header or Footer  149
 
You can use as many lines as you want in your header or footer section. You 
may have to adjust the top or bottom margin, however, to prevent the header or 
footer from spilling into the worksheet area. Position the mouse pointer where 
you want to add another line or wrap an existing line, and press Enter.
Remember: You insert the header or footer information on any page of your 
document and Excel automatically applies the header or footer to all other 
pages. See also “Using multiple headers and footers in your reports,” immediately 
following this section.
Using multiple headers and footers in your reports
Excel provides the following options when specifying headers and footers for 
different pages in your reports:
 ✓ 
You can specify a different header or footer for the first page. This option 
is useful, for example, for reports that require a different header or footer 
for a title or table of contents page.
 ✓ 
You can specify a different header or footer for odd and even pages. This 
option is useful, for example, if you create book-style reports. If, in addition, 
you specify a first page header or footer, Excel applies the odd page 
header or footer starting from the second page of your report.
Follow these steps to add a separate header or footer to the first page or to add 
separate headers or footers to odd and even pages of your report:
 1. 
Complete Steps 1 to 3 in “Selecting a predefined header or footer,” earlier 
in this section.
 2. 
Do one or both of the following:
 • To specify a first page header or footer, select the Different First Page 
check box in the Options group of the Header and Footer Design tab.
 • To specify odd and even page headers or footers, select the Different 
Odd & Even Pages check box in the Options group of the Header and 
Footer Design tab.
 3. 
Enter the header or footer information for each page as follows:
 • If you specified a separate first page header or footer only, enter 
the first page header or footer information in the first page of your 
document and enter the header or footer information for all subsequent 
pages in the second page of your document.
 • If you specified odd and even headers or footers only, enter the header 
or footer information for all odd pages in the first page of your document 
and enter the header or footer information for all even pages in the 
second page of your document.

150  Part 9: Previewing and Printing Your Work
 • If you specified both first page header or footer and odd and even page 
headers or footers, enter the first page header or footer information in 
the first page of your document, enter the header or footer information 
for all odd pages in the second page of your document, and enter the 
header or footer information for all even pages in the third page of your 
document.
Remember: When you click the mouse pointer within a header or footer region, 
Excel indicates the type of header or footer you’re working with (normal, first 
page, odd page, or even page) above the header or below the footer area.
Setting the Print Area
If you choose to print the active worksheet or multiple sheets, Excel prints the 
entire sheet or sheets — or just the range named Print_Area. Each worksheet 
can have a range named Print_Area. After you set the print area, Excel automati-
cally creates the Print_Area name. Print_Area is a standard named range, so you 
can edit the range’s reference manually if you like. See also “Editing Names,” in 
Part 6.
To set the print area, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the range that you want to print. Press and hold Ctrl to select non-
adjacent ranges.
 2. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, click the Print Area button, and 
choose Set Print Area from the menu.
Remember: After you specify a print area, by default Excel uses that print area in 
all subsequent printouts. If you want to clear the print area (so that Excel auto-
matically prints the entire worksheet,) click the Print Area button and choose 
Clear Print Area from the menu.
If you don’t want to clear the normal print areas that you create but occasion-
ally want to ignore the print areas (to print the entire worksheet), select the 
Ignore Print Area option from the Print Range button menu in the Backstage 
view. See “Setting page and printer options,” earlier in this part.
Specifying Sheet Printing Options
In most cases, you want to print the worksheet as displayed on-screen. 
Sometimes, however, you may want to control how or what elements are 
printed. Excel provides several options that allow you to control the appearance 
of your worksheet printouts.

Inserting a Header or Footer — Specifying Sheet Printing Options  151
Printing gridlines or row and column headings
Follow these steps to control the printing of gridlines or row and column 
headings:
 1. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Do one or both of the following:
 • To print or suppress printing of gridlines, select or deselect the Print 
check box under the Gridlines heading in the Sheet Options group.
 • To print or suppress printing of row and column headings, select or 
deselect the Print check box under the Headings heading in the Sheet 
Options group.
Printing row or column data labels on each page
Worksheet data is often set up with labels (titles) in the first row and sometimes 
descriptive names in the first column. If such a worksheet requires more than 
one page to print, you may find reading subsequent pages difficult because the 
text in the first row or the first column or both doesn’t print on subsequent 
pages. Excel offers an option that allows you to print row and column labels 
(titles) on every page.
Follow these steps to select the row or column labels that will appear on each 
page:
 1. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon and then click the Print Titles 
button. Excel displays the Page Setup dialog box with the Sheet tab 
selected.
 2. 
Click inside the appropriate box in the Print Titles area, and point to the 
row(s) or column(s) in the worksheet that you want to repeat on each 
page. You can also enter these references manually. For example, to spec-
ify rows 1 and 2 as repeating rows, enter 1:2.
 3. 
Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
Remember: Don’t confuse print titles with headers; these are two different con-
cepts. Headers appear at the top of each page and contain information such as 
the worksheet name, date, or page number. Print titles describe the data that 
you’re printing, such as field names in a table.
 
 You can specify different print titles for each worksheet in the workbook. Excel 
remembers print titles by creating sheet-level names (Print_Titles).
Selecting miscellaneous sheet printing options
Excel provides some worksheet print options that you might use occasionally. 
Follow these steps to access these options:

152  Part 9: Previewing and Printing Your Work
 1. 
Click the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon and then click the dialog 
launcher button on the bottom right of the Sheet Options group container, 
or frame. See “Introducing the Ribbon,” in Part 1 for a discussion of the 
dialog launcher. Excel displays the Page Setup dialog box with the Sheet 
tab selected.
 2. 
Select among these options:
 • Black and White: If you have a colorful worksheet but your printer is 
stuck in a monochrome world, you may discover that the worksheet 
colors don’t translate well to black and white. In this case, you can use 
this option to instruct Excel to ignore the colors while printing.
 • Draft Quality: Printing in Draft mode doesn’t print embedded charts or 
drawing objects, cell gridlines, or borders. This mode usually reduces 
the printing time and is handy for getting a quick printout.
 • Comments: If one or more cells in your worksheet have a cell comment, 
you can print these comments along with the worksheet by choosing 
an option from the Comments drop-down list. By default, comments are 
not printed.
 • Cell Errors As: Excel gives you the option to print error values as they 
appear on your worksheet or to replace each error value with a pre-
defined character in the printed output. Error values are #NUM!, 
#DIV/0!, #REF!, #N/A, #VALUE!, #NAME?, and #NULL!. Choose an 
option from the Cell Errors As drop-down list. By default, errors are 
printed as displayed.
 • Page Order: If you have a worksheet that spans across several columns 
and down several rows, your worksheet is likely to end up with multiple 
vertical page breaks, horizontal page breaks, or both. In this case, you 
have the choice of printing your worksheet pages from left to right or 
from top to bottom. In the Page Order area, click the Down, Then Over 
option or the Over, Then Down option. By default, Excel prints down, 
then over.
 3. 
Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.

Charting Your Data
A chart (also known as a graph outside Excel circles) is a way to present a table of 
numbers visually. The visual display allows you, for example, to quickly examine 
trends, patterns, anomalies, or compare the relative contributions of various items. 
Excel provides you with the tools to create a variety of charts.

Anatomy of a Chart
Before you create your first chart in Excel, it helps to know the elements that 
you can include in the chart. Figure 10-1 illustrates the most common elements 
that a chart can contain. When you create a chart, include only the elements you 
need to clearly portray your data. Too much information will make the chart 
hard to read and reduce its usefulness.

The following is a description of the elements shown in Figure 10-1:
 ✓ 
Horizontal axis: For most charts, this axis displays category labels. A 
category is any item without numerical significance. Month, Quarter, and 
Product are examples of categories. For a Month category, the labels might 
be Jan, Feb, Mar, and so on. The chart displays the labels at equally spaced 
intervals on the axis. For the bar, X Y scatter, and bubble chart types, the 
horizontal axis displays a value scale. A chart can have a primary horizontal 
axis and a secondary horizontal axis (not shown in Figure 10-1).

Anatomy of a Chart — Activating a Chart  155
 ✓ 
Horizontal axis title: Displays a name for the category plotted.
 ✓ 
Vertical axis: For most charts, this axis displays a value scale for the data 
series plotted. For the bar chart type, the vertical axis displays category 
labels. A chart can have a primary and a secondary vertical axis.
 ✓ 
Vertical axis title: Displays a name for the value scale against which the 
series is plotted.
 ✓ 
Data series: A group of values (data points) associated with a category. 
For example, projected sales and actual sales might be two series 
associated with a Month category.
 ✓ 
Data points: Values associated with category labels. For example, projected 
and actual sales figures plotted for January represent data points.
 ✓ 
Data labels: Labels associated with the data points on the chart. For 
example, the labels can be the values of data points.
 ✓ 
Data table: The data series represented in tabular form and placed directly 
below the horizontal axis.
 ✓ 
Chart title: A title that you provide for the chart.
 ✓ 
Legend: A group of keys and text identifying each data series in the chart.
 ✓ 
Gridlines: Lines placed on the chart to assist in reading the value of data 
points or to segregate category labels. Gridlines can be distracting and 
therefore should be used sparingly. If you must use gridlines, we suggest 
that you choose a pale and unobtrusive color for the line.
 ✓ 
Tick marks: These short lines mark off intervals on an axis.
 ✓ 
Plot area: The area of the chart, defined by the axes boundaries, where the 
data series is plotted.
 ✓ 
Chart area: The entire area that includes all elements within the chart.
Activating a Chart
Before you can do anything with a chart, you must activate it, as follows:
 ✓ 
To activate a chart on a chart sheet, click the chart sheet’s tab.
 ✓ 
To activate a chart that you embed in a worksheet, click the chart border 
area.
After you activate an embedded chart or a chart on a chart sheet, Excel 
displays the Chart Tools contextual tabs on the Ribbon. Double-clicking the 
chart automatically displays the Design tab tools on the Ribbon.

 A sparkline is a miniature chart that occupies a single worksheet cell. Sparklines 
are not intended to show the detail you would typically see on a standard Excel 
chart. Instead, they serve as at-a-glance graphical displays to help add context 
to numbers.
In Figure 10-2, we see that the most recent values of product sales are in the 
31-Jan-11 column. The line-type sparklines show the 12-month trend of sales for 
the product categories, and the column-type sparklines show individual values 
over the same period.
Figure 10-2
 
Sparklines are useful in a dashboard display. In a typical dashboard, you would 
show only the current value and an associated sparkline for historical context. A 
dashboard that includes the product sales of Figure 10-2, for example, might 
show the top five or ten products for Jan-11 along with 12-month line-type 
sparklines.
Remember: You cannot select a sparkline in a cell the way you can select, for 
example, text in a cell. In this section, when we refer to selecting a sparkline, we 
really mean selecting the cell or range containing the sparkline or sparklines.
Creating a sparkline
Follow these steps to create a sparkline:
 1. 
Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and select one of the following sparkline 
types: Line, Column, and Win/Loss. Excel displays the Create Sparkline 
dialog box.

Adding Context to Numbers with Sparklines  157
 
 
 If you want to create sparklines in a worksheet different from the 
worksheet holding the data range for the sparklines, start this step in 
the worksheet that will hold the sparklines.
 2. 
Click in the Data Range box and enter the data range for the sparkline(s). 
You can enter the range manually or use the mouse to select the range in 
the worksheet.
 • To create a single sparkline, select data in a single row or single column.
 • To create multiple sparklines, select more than one row and column.
 3. 
Click in the Location Range box. If Excel selects a location range and it’s 
not what you want, clear the entry.
 • If you selected a single row or column in Step 2, enter a single cell for 
the sparkline.
 • If you selected more than one row and column in Step 2, select a range 
for the sparklines. The range must be in a single row or a single column. 
The number of cells in the range must be equal to the numbers of rows 
in the data range or the number of columns in the data range. If the 
number of cells in the range is equal to the number of data rows, the 
sparklines in the group will be created from data in the rows. If the 
number of cells in the range is equal to the number of data columns, 
the sparklines in the group will be created from data in the columns. If 
the number of cells in the range is not equal to the number of rows or 
columns in the data range, Excel displays an error.
  In Figure 10-2, we selected a column range for the sparklines, and the 
number of cells in the range is equal to the number of data rows. 
Therefore, for each sparkline, Excel used the data in each row.
 
4.  After you specify the sparkline location range, click OK.
When you select a sparkline, Excel displays the Sparkline Tools Design tab on 
the Ribbon.
Grouping and ungrouping sparklines
After you create multiple sparklines using the Create Sparkline dialog box, 
Excel places the resulting sparklines in a group. If you click any sparkline in the 
group, Excel displays a blue highlight surrounding the group. The purpose of 
the group is to allow you to apply settings, such as formatting changes, to all the 
sparklines in the group simultaneously.
If you want to remove one or more sparklines from the group, you can do so in 
two ways:

158  Part 10: Charting Your Data
 ✓ 
Select the sparklines that you want to ungroup. Click the Sparkline Tools 
Design tab on the Ribbon and click the Ungroup button.
 ✓ 
Select the sparklines that you want to ungroup. Right-click any of the 
selected sparklines and choose Sparklines➪Ungroup from the menu.
In Figure 10-2, I created a sparkline group that includes a Total row. For comparison 
among product sales sparklines, I set the vertical axis minimum and maximum 
values the same for all sparklines. (See “Using Sparkline axis options,” later in 
this section.) Because the values in the totals data range is an order of magnitude 
higher than the individual product values, the sparklines for the totals would 
not have shown the variations in its data values adequately. I therefore 
ungrouped the sparklines for the Total row.
To group sparklines, simply select the sparklines you want to group and click 
the Group button in the Sparkline Tools Design tab.
Modifying a sparkline data range or location
After you create a sparkline, you can change its data range or location. Select 
the sparkline and click the Sparkline Tools Design tab on the Ribbon.
On the far left of the Design tab is the Sparkline group, which contains a single 
button called Edit Data. Clicking the button’s arrow displays a menu that allows 
you to
 ✓ 
Change the source or location range for a sparkline group.
 ✓ 
Change the source range for an individual sparkline.
 ✓ 
Tell Excel how you want to handle hidden or missing data in the sparkline 
data range.
 ✓ 
Switch the data range used by sparklines in a group from rows to columns 
or vice versa. When you create a sparkline group, if the number of data 
rows and data columns are the same, by default each sparkline in the 
group is created from data in the rows. You can use the Switch Row/
Column option to force the sparklines in the group to use data in the 
columns instead.
 
 You can move a sparkline or a sparkline group to another location by selecting 
and dragging, or by a cut-and-paste operation. The procedure is similar to 
moving a worksheet range. See “Moving Cells and Ranges,” in Part 4.
Including additional elements in your sparkline
Excel allows you to add additional elements to a sparkline. Select the sparkline 
and click the Sparkline Tools Design tab on the Ribbon. Then select the elements 
you want to include by clicking the appropriate check boxes in the Show/Hide 
group. Note that the Markers option applies only to line-type sparklines.

Adding Context to Numbers with Sparklines  159
Formatting and changing the sparkline type
You can change the color of your sparkline and any added elements, and you 
change the sparkline type. Select the sparkline and click the Sparkline Tools 
Design tab on the Ribbon.
The Type group allows you to change the type of sparkline. The choices are 
Line, Column, and Win/Loss.
In the Style group, you can select predefined color styles from the gallery. 
Any highlight element that you turn on in the Show/Hide group appears with 
predefined colors in the Styles group.
If none of the predefined styles are to your liking, you can select a sparkline 
color or weight (or both in the case of a line sparkline) from the Sparkline Color 
menu. You can select the color of various highlight elements by choosing a 
color from the Marker Color menu.
Using sparkline axis options
As in a standard Excel chart, sparklines have horizontal and vertical axes, but 
they are normally hidden. Excel provides several axis options that you can use 
with sparklines. Select a sparkline, click the Sparkline Tools Design tab, and then 
click the Axis button to display the following list of options for the sparkline 
horizontal and vertical axes, respectively:
 ✓ 
Horizontal axis options: These options allow you to change the default 
behavior of the horizontal axis.
 • By default, Excel uses the General Axis Type. This is equivalent to the 
category axis in a standard Excel chart. Note that all sparklines in a 
group share a single horizontal axis. You don’t actually select a range 
for the general horizontal axis type; the axis is inferred from the data 
range. In Figure 10-2, the column labels in the data range are actual 
dates (not just month or year labels), so they can be used as a horizontal 
axis. Choose Date Axis Type from the menu, click in the dialog box that 
appears, and select the date labels. The difference between the general 
axis and the date axis is as follows: If in Figure 10-2, one or more of the 
month columns were missing, the date axis would show the missing 
months as gaps in the sparkline. With the general axis, there would be 
no gaps in the sparkline.
 • You can display the horizontal axis in the sparkline by choosing Show 
Axis from the menu. The axis is displayed only if at least one negative 
value is in a sparkline data range. The axis is therefore useful for 
showing the zero crossing point in a line-type sparkline.
 • By default, when you select a data range for a sparkline, Excel plots the 
data from left to right or top to bottom. If you want to plot the sparkline 
in the reverse data direction, choose Plot Data Right-to-Left from the 

160  Part 10: Charting Your Data
menu. In Figure 10-2, the data range is in reverse date order (the most 
current date is to the left of the range). However, the context is historical, 
so we wanted to plot the sparklines with the value of the earliest date 
first and the most current date last. Therefore, we chose the option to 
plot the data from right to left.
 ✓ 
Vertical axis minimum and maximum value options: These options allow 
you to change the default behavior of the vertical axis.
 
 You can’t display a vertical axis on a sparkline (and one would be inappro-
priate on a sparkline), but you can make changes to an implied axis. The 
minimum and maximum value options are applicable to sparkline groups.
 
 By default, Excel sets the vertical axis minimum and maximum values inde-
pendently for each sparkline in a group. This option is appropriate if the 
sparkline data ranges have different orders of magnitude, or if compari-
sons among sparklines are unimportant. However, if the data ranges are of 
the same order of magnitude and comparison among sparklines is impor-
tant, you can set the minimum and maximum values the same for all spar-
klines by selecting Same for All Sparklines from the menu.
Adding a New Data Series to a Chart
Follow these steps to add a new data series to a chart:
 1. 
Activate the chart, click the Design contextual tab, and then click the 
Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source dialog box 
(see Figure 10-3).
Figure 10-3
 

Adding Context to Numbers with Sparklines  — Adding a Title to a Chart  161
 2. 
Click the Add button. Excel displays the Edit Series dialog box.
 3. 
If the reference in the Series Name box is incorrect, clear the default entry 
and either type a name for the series or click the cell in the worksheet 
containing the series name. You can also leave the box blank.
 4. 
If the reference in the Series Values box is incorrect, clear the default 
entry and select the series data range in the worksheet.
 5. 
Click OK to return to the Select Data Source dialog box. The new series 
name (or a generic title if you didn’t include a name in Step 3) appears in 
the Legend Entries window. In the window on the right side of the dialog 
box, Excel displays numbered category labels for the series. You can 
ignore these labels — Excel simply adds the new series to the chart using 
the existing category labels.
 6. 
Click OK.
 
 To quickly add a new data series to a chart, select the range that you want to 
add (including any label for the series name), and click the Copy button on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab. Then activate the chart, click the arrow on the Paste button, 
and choose Paste Special from the menu. Excel opens the Paste Special dialog 
box. If necessary, modify the default settings and click OK.
Adding a Title to a Chart
The chart title normally appears at the top of the chart. When you create a 
chart, you can select a layout that includes a chart title box. To add a title to an 
existing chart, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Chart Title button, and then choose an option from the menu. 
Excel adds a chart title box to the chart.
 3. 
Click in the title box and type a title for the chart.
 4. 
If you want to format the chart title, you can use the standard formatting 
options in the Font Group on the Ribbon’s Home tab or you can use spe-
cial WordArt and other formatting options on the Format tab.

162  Part 10: Charting Your Data
Changing the Chart Type for an 
Existing Chart or Data Series
Excel supports a wide variety of chart types (line charts, column charts, and so 
on). After you create a chart, you might decide that a different chart type would 
better portray the data. You can even create a combination chart by selecting a 
different chart type for a data series. You can, for example, create a chart with 
one data series plotted as a line chart type and another data series plotted as a 
column chart type (see Figure 10-1).
To change the chart type for an existing chart or to change the chart type for a 
data series on a chart, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
To change the chart type for the chart (this is, for all data series in the 
chart), click the Change Chart Type button. To change the chart type for a 
single data series, select the data series before clicking the Change Chart 
Type button. Excel displays the Change Chart Type dialog box.
 3. 
In the list on the left, choose a chart type. Then in the gallery on the right, 
choose a chart subtype.
 4. 
Click OK.
Creating a Chart
Excel provides several layout and formatting options that can save you time 
when you create a chart. Follow these steps to chart your data:
 1. 
Select the data you want to chart, including any row and column labels 
(for category and series name identification).
 2. 
Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click a Chart Type button in 
the Charts group. Excel displays a chart subtype gallery.
 3. 
Choose a subtype from the gallery. If you hover the mouse pointer over a 
chart type button or chart subtype gallery option, Excel displays a 
ScreenTip that provides assistance on how you can use the particular 
chart type or subtype.
 
 After you choose a subtype, Excel creates a chart and displays the chart 
tools contextual tabs on the Ribbon and a header on the Excel title bar 
above the tabs. Excel automatically displays the tools for the Design tab 
on the Ribbon (see Figure 10-4).

Changing the Chart Type for an Existing Chart or Data Series — Creating a Chart  163
Figure 10-4
 
 4. 
If the layout of elements on the chart isn’t what you want, choose a new 
layout from the Chart Layouts gallery. Use the upper arrows on the right 
side of the gallery to scroll the gallery display or the bottom arrow to 
display the entire gallery. Each layout includes a combination of typical 
elements for the chart. If you choose a layout that includes a chart title, 
click in the title box and type a title for the chart.
 5. 
If required, select a new style for the chart from the Chart Styles gallery. 
Use the upper arrows on the right side of the gallery to scroll the gallery 
display or the bottom arrow to display the entire gallery. The styles in the 
gallery are based on the theme currently applied in the workbook, so if 
you change the theme, the styles change to match the new theme. 
See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Figure 10-5 illustrates some important rules that Excel applies when creating a 
chart:
 ✓ 
If the data you’re charting contains more rows than columns, Excel uses 
the row data to create the category axis. The row labels are used for 
category labels and the column labels are used for series names. (In Figure 
10-5, see the data range A1:D13 and the resultant chart on the right of the 
range.)
 
 If the row labels are missing or not included in the range, Excel labels the 
category axis with numbers. If, in addition, the column labels are missing 
or not included in the range, Excel names the series as Series 1, Series 2, 
and so on. (In Figure 10-5, see the data range A15:C26 and the resultant 
chart on the right of the range.)
 ✓ 
If the data you’re charting contains more columns than rows, or an equal 
number of columns and rows, Excel uses the column data to create the 
category axis. The column labels are used for category labels and the row 
labels are used for series names. (In Figure 10-5, see the data range N1:Q3 
and the resultant chart at the bottom of the range.)
 ✓ 
If the data you’re charting contains only one series, Excel includes a chart 
title with the same name as the series name, assuming that a row or 
column label is available for the series name (as per the first rule).
Remember: You can reverse Excel’s category and series name choices after the 
chart is created by activating the chart and clicking the Switch Row/Column 
button on the Design tab.

164  Part 10: Charting Your Data
Figure 10-5
 
Creating and Using a Chart Template
A chart template is a standard chart (or combination chart) customized in a 
specific manner. You can subsequently use the template to create new charts. 
To customize a chart that you can save as a template, follow these steps:
 1. 
Create a chart that’s customized the way you want. For example, you can 
set colors or line styles, modify fonts and type sizes, and add a title.
 2. 
Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design 
tools on the Ribbon.
 3. 
Click the Save as Template button. Excel displays the Save Chart Template 
dialog box.
 4. 
In the File Name box, enter a filename.
 5. 
Click Save.
The template appears in the Templates category of the Change Chart Type 
dialog box (accessed by clicking the Change Chart Type button in the Design 
tab). After you select the Templates category, the new chart appears in the My 
Templates gallery on the right side of the dialog box. If you hover the mouse 
pointer over the chart, a ScreenTip displays the chart name you supplied in 
Step 4.
To use a template, see “Creating a Chart,” earlier in this part, and choose the 
template from the Templates category.

Creating a Chart — Displaying Data Labels in a Chart  165
Displaying a Data Table in a Chart
In Excel, you can display a table of the data that you use in the chart. The data 
table appears below the chart (see Figure 10-1). When you create a chart, you 
can select a layout that includes a data table.
To add a data table to an existing chart, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Data Table button and choose an option from the menu. The 
data table appears below the chart.
 3. 
To explore additional formatting options for the data table, choose More 
Data Table Options from the menu. Excel displays the Format Data Table 
dialog box.
 4. 
Make your selections from the various formatting options and click OK.
Displaying Data Labels in a Chart
Sometimes you want your chart to display the data value for each point on the 
chart (see Figure 10-1). Or you want to display the category label for each data 
point. When you create a chart, you can select a layout that includes data labels.
To add data labels to a chart series, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click one of the data points in the series. This action selects the entire 
data series.
 
 
 After you select the entire series, be careful not to click a data point 
because this action selects only a single data point. If you do accidentally 
select a single data point, click anywhere outside the data series and 
repeat this step.
 3. 
Click the Data Labels button and choose an option from the menu. The 
data labels appear on the chart.
 4. 
To explore additional formatting options for the data labels:
 a. Choose More Data Label Options from the menu. Excel displays the 
Format Data Labels dialog box.
 b. Make your selections from the various formatting options.
 c. Click OK.

166  Part 10: Charting Your Data
Remember: The data labels are linked to the worksheet, so if your data changes, 
the labels change too. To override the data label with some other text, select the 
label and enter the new text (or even a cell reference) in the formula bar.
 
 If Excel doesn’t position the data labels correctly, select an individual label and 
drag it to a better location. To select an individual label, click the label twice.
Formatting a Chart Element
You can modify the elements in a chart in several ways. For example, you can 
change colors, line widths, and fonts. You make modifications in the Format 
dialog box, which varies for each type of chart element.
To modify an element in a chart, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the chart element. See “Selecting a Chart Element,” later in this part.
 2. 
Access the Format dialog box for the chart element that you selected by 
using any of the following techniques:
 • In the Current Selection group of the Layout tab, click the Format 
Selection button below the Chart Elements list.
 • Right-click the element and choose Format Item Name from the 
contextual menu that appears, where Item Name is the name of the 
chart element you select, such as Data Series, Gridlines, or Axis.
 • Double-click the element.
 • Press Ctrl+1 (the number 1).
 3. 
Choose the option on the left side of the dialog box that corresponds to 
what you want to do.
 4. 
Make the changes by selecting the appropriate options on the right side of 
the dialog box. For help on an option, click the help button (the question 
mark) in the dialog box.
 5. 
Click OK.
Remember: You can change the color of some element parts — for example, the 
fill color or line color. You can select a theme color or a non-theme color. If you 
choose a theme color, the color changes if you change the workbook theme. If 
you choose a non-theme color, the color does not change if you change the 
workbook theme. See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
 
 If you have several chart elements you want to format, leave the Format 
dialog box open. After you select a different element, the options in the 
Format dialog box change to those appropriate for the new element.

Displaying Data Labels in a Chart — Inserting and Modifying Chart Legends  167
Handling Missing Data or Charting Hidden Data
Sometimes, data that you’re charting may be missing one or more data points. 
Also, by default, Excel does not include data in hidden rows and columns within 
the data range you’re charting. Excel offers several options for handling the 
missing data and allows you to chart hidden data in a range. Just follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source 
dialog box.
 3. 
Click the Hidden and Empty Cells button. Excel displays the Hidden and 
Empty Cell Settings dialog box.
 4. 
Select the option that corresponds to how you want to handle the missing 
data:
 • Gaps: Excel ignores missing data, and the data series leaves a gap for 
each missing data point. This is the default setting.
 • Zero: Excel treats missing data as zero.
 • Span with Line: Excel calculates missing data by using data on either 
side of the missing point(s). This option is available only for line charts 
and some X Y scatter chart subtypes.
 5. 
If you want to chart hidden data within the chart’s source data range, 
select the Show Data in Hidden Rows and Columns check box.
 6. 
Click OK to exit the Hidden and Empty Cell Settings dialog box, and click 
OK again to exit the Select Data Source dialog box.
Remember: The options that you set apply to the entire active chart; you can’t 
set a different option for different series in the same chart.
Inserting and Modifying Chart Legends
A legend uses text and keys to describe the data series in a chart. A key is a 
small graphic that corresponds to the chart’s series.
Adding a legend to a chart
When you create a chart, you can select a layout that includes a legend (labeled 
in Figure 10-1). If you don’t include a legend as you create the chart, you can add 
one later. To add a legend to an existing chart, follow these steps:

168  Part 10: Charting Your Data
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Legend button and choose an option from the menu. Excel 
displays the legend on the chart.
Changing the names (titles) on a chart legend
If you don’t include row or column titles with the source data when you create a 
chart, Excel displays the default names (titles) Series 1, Series 2, and so on in the 
legend. To change the default names, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Design tab to display the chart design 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Select Data button. You can also right-click the border area 
of the chart and choose Select Data from the contextual menu. Excel 
displays the Select Data Source dialog box.
 3. 
Choose a name (Series 1, Series 2, and so on) in the Legend Entries 
(Series) window, and then click the Edit button above the series name. 
Excel displays the Edit Series dialog box.
 4. 
Clear the entry in the Series Name box and either type a new name or 
point to a worksheet cell containing the name you want to use. Click OK 
to add the name and return to the Select Data Source dialog box.
 5. 
Repeat Step 4 for each series that you want to rename.
 6. 
Click OK to exit the Select Data Source dialog box.
Modifying a Chart Axis
After you create a chart, you may want to modify the value axis to change the 
scale, add an axis title, modify the tick mark display, add display units, and so 
on. Or you may want to modify the category axis to, for example, add a title, 
modify the tick marks, or change where the axis crosses the value axis.
Follow these steps to modify a chart axis:
 1. 
Activate the chart and click the Layout tab to display the chart layout 
tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Axes button and choose a Horizontal Axis or Vertical Axis 
option, depending on which axis you want to modify. After you choose an 
axis option, a flyout menu appears.

Inserting and Modifying Chart Legends — Resizing, Moving, Copying, and Deleting an Embedded Chart  169
 3. 
If one of the standard options on the flyout menu is what you want, 
choose the option, and you’re finished. Otherwise, continue with Step 4.
 4. 
If none of the standard flyout menu options are what you want, choose 
More <Axis> Options at the bottom of the flyout menu, where <Axis> is the 
primary/secondary horizontal or primary/secondary vertical axis. Excel 
displays the Format Axis dialog box.
 5. 
On the right side of the dialog box, select the axis options you want to 
change. For help, click the help button (the question mark at the top-right 
of the dialog box).
 
 You may have to experiment with the options to get what you want. You 
can always undo your selections (by clicking the undo button on the 
Quick Access toolbar) and start over if your chart doesn’t show the 
expected results.
 6. 
If you want to modify the axis formatting (number, fill, line, and so on), 
select one or more of the options in the list on the left side of the dialog 
box and select the appropriate options on the right.
 7. 
Click OK when you are finished making your selections.
 
 A quick way to modify an existing axis is by selecting and double-clicking 
the axis on the chart or by right-clicking the axis on the chart and choosing 
Format Axis from the menu. Proceed with Steps 5–7.
To add a title to an axis, activate the chart, click the Layout tab, and click the 
Axis Titles button. Choose an axis from the menu and choose a title option from 
the flyout menu. After Excel displays the axis title box on the chart, click in the 
box and enter a title.
Resizing, Moving, Copying, and 
Deleting an Embedded Chart
To resize an embedded chart, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart.
 2. 
Drag one of the eight resize handles (a series of dots) on the chart border 
to change the size of the element. When you hover the mouse pointer 
over a resize handle or when you drag the resize handle, the pointer 
changes into a black line with arrows on both ends.

170  Part 10: Charting Your Data
You can move the embedded chart to a different location on the worksheet 
or you can make a copy of the chart on the worksheet:
 ✓ 
To move a chart using the mouse, first activate the chart. Then click the 
border of the chart between the resize handles, and drag the chart to the 
desired location in the worksheet. When you hover the mouse pointer over 
a border or when you drag the border, the pointer changes into a white 
arrow with a black cross on the arrow’s tip.
 ✓ 
If you want to move a chart in small increments — for example, to line up 
multiple charts — it is difficult to do so using the mouse. In this case, you 
can use the arrow keys to move the chart. First make sure that the chart 
isn’t activated. Press and hold the Ctrl key and then select the chart with 
the mouse. You can now move the chart using the arrow keys.
 ✓ 
To copy a chart, activate it. Then press and hold down the Ctrl key while 
dragging the chart. You can also use the Copy and Paste buttons on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab or press Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste.
 ✓ 
To move the embedded chart to a separate chart sheet, select the chart, 
click the Design tab, and then click the Move Chart button. Specify the new 
location in the Move Chart dialog box and click OK. A chart sheet typically 
contains a single chart that is linked to the data in the worksheet.
To delete a chart, activate the chart and press the Delete key.
Resizing, Moving, and Deleting a Chart Element
You can resize the following chart elements: any titles and data labels, the 
legend, and the plot area. To resize a chart element, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the chart element that you want to resize.
 2. 
Drag a resize handle (a square box or a circle) on the element border to 
change the size of the element. When you hover the mouse pointer over a 
resize handle, the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow. Clicking the 
mouse to drag the handle changes the pointer to a cross.
You can move the titles, the data labels, and the legend within the chart area. To 
move a chart element, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the chart element that you want to move.
 2. 
Click the border of the element between the resize handles, and drag the 
element to the desired location in the chart. When you hover the mouse 
pointer over a border or when you drag the border, the pointer changes 
to a cross with an arrow on each end.

Modifying an Embedded Chart— Updating the Source Data Range for a Chart or a Data Series  171
You can delete any element in a chart, including a data series. To delete a chart 
element, follow these steps:
 1. 
Select the element that you want to delete.
 2. 
Press the Delete key.
See also “Selecting a Chart Element,” immediately following this section.
Selecting a Chart Element
Modifying an element in a chart is similar to everything else that you do in Excel: 
First you make a selection — in this case, select a chart element — and then you 
issue a command to do something with the selection.
You can select a chart element in any of the following three ways:
 ✓ 
Click the chart element. If the element is a series, clicking the series 
once selects all the points in the series. Clicking the series twice selects 
individual points in the series.
 ✓ 
Press the up-arrow or down-arrow key to cycle through all the elements 
in the chart. If a data series is selected, you can press the right-arrow or 
left-arrow key to select individual points in the series.
 ✓ 
Select the chart and click the Layout tab on the Ribbon. Select a chart 
element from the Chart Elements drop-down list (located above the 
Format Selection button) in the Current Selection group. This option is 
useful if you find it difficult to select the element with the mouse.
 
 If you move the mouse pointer over a chart element, a ScreenTip displays the 
name of the element. If the element is a data point, the ScreenTip displays the 
value. The ScreenTip is useful in ensuring that you’re selecting the intended 
element.
Updating the Source Data Range 
for a Chart or a Data Series
Often, you create a chart that uses a particular range of data and then extend 
the data range by adding new data in the worksheet. If you add new data to a 
range, the data series in the chart doesn’t update to include the new data. Or 
you may delete some of the data in a range that you used to create the chart. If 
you delete data from a range, by default the chart displays the deleted data as 
zero values.

172  Part 10: Charting Your Data
To update the entire chart to reflect the new data range, follow these steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart, and then click the Design tab to display the chart 
design tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Select Data button to display the Select Data Source dialog box.
 3. 
In the Chart Data Range box, manually edit the source data reference or 
clear the box and use the mouse pointer to select the new range on the 
worksheet.
 4. 
Click OK, and Excel updates the chart with the new data range.
If you need to update the range for a single data series on the chart, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Activate the chart, and then click the Design tab to display the chart 
design tools on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Select Data button. Excel displays the Select Data Source 
dialog box.
 3. 
Select the series name of the series you want to modify in the Legend 
Entries (Series) window, and click the Edit button above the window. 
Excel displays the Edit Series dialog box.
 4. 
In the Series Values box, manually edit the source data reference, or 
clear the box and use the mouse pointer to select the new range in the 
worksheet. Click OK to return to the Select Data Source dialog box.
 5. 
If necessary, modify the range for category labels. Click the Edit button 
under Horizontal (Categories) Axis Labels to display the Axis Labels 
dialog box. In the Axis Label Range box, manually edit the category labels 
reference, or clear the box and select the new range on the worksheet.
 6. 
Click OK, and Excel updates the chart with the new data range.
 
 After you activate a chart, Excel outlines in the worksheet the ranges that the 
chart uses. To extend or reduce the range of the entire chart, simply drag an 
outline handle (a small square box on the corner of the outline). To extend or 
reduce the range of a data series, select the data series in the chart and drag an 
outline handle.
 
 A better way to handle data ranges that change is to convert the range to a table. 
After you add or remove data from a table, the chart created from the range 
(either before or after you convert the range to a table) updates automatically.

Working with Tables
A table is a structure that you can use as a data source for reports and charts that 
you create in Excel. You can also analyze data in the table directly, because it pro-
vides powerful filtering, sorting, and formatting tools. Data for the table can be 
entered manually, copied from another worksheet, or imported from external 
sources such as a text file, the Web, an XML file, or a database.

174  Part 11: Working with Tables
Anatomy of a Table
A table consists of rows and columns of data. Each column of data has a name, 
such as First Name, Last Name, City, or State. The names appear in the table’s 
header row. You can use a table as a data source for reports and charts. Charts 
are updated automatically if you add or remove data from the table or filter data 
in the table. Excel also provides many handy tools that allow you to analyze 
data in the table. For example, you can easily sort and filter data, format the 
table conditionally to highlight specific data (for example, poor, fair, good), and 
add formula columns to aid in analysis. You can create data for a table manually, 
copy data from a worksheet, link data from a worksheet or a different workbook, 
or import data from an external source. If you have data in your worksheet that 
is arranged in a list like that shown in Figure 11-1, consider converting the list to 
a table to take advantage of a table’s many convenient features.

Anatomy of a Table — Creating a Table  175
The following is a description of the parts of a table:
 ✓ 
Table area: The header row, data rows, and optional totals row.
 ✓ 
Header row: Names shared by all data rows — for example, Customer 
Name, Order ID, and Unit Price.
 ✓ 
Drop-down sort and filter arrow: Found in each column in the header row. 
Clicking the arrow displays sort and filter options for the column.
 ✓ 
Data row: Specific information derived from the columns in the header 
row, such as transaction information (for example, details of sales), 
customer data, or product data.
 ✓ 
Totals row: Allows you to perform a calculation (such as Sum, Average, or 
Count) on any column of data.
Tables often contain more rows that can be displayed simultaneously on the 
screen. If the cell pointer is in the table and you scroll the worksheet so that the 
header row is no longer displayed in the worksheet window, the header titles 
appear in the column header area (see Figure 11-1).

 The display of the column drop-down arrows in the column header area is new 
in Excel 2010.
See also “Familiarizing Yourself with the Excel 2010 Window,” in Part 1.
Converting a Table to a Range
If you no longer need to work with a table, you can convert the table to a normal 
range. Right-click in the table and choose Table➪Convert to Range from the 
contextual menu or click anywhere in the table and then click Convert to Range 
on the Table Tools Design tab.
Creating a Table
You can create a table from a data range that is set up with a header row. If your 
range does not include a header row, you should add one. See also Part 4, 
“Entering and Editing Worksheet Data.” Follow these steps to create a table from 
a range:
 1. 
Select any cell in the range.

176  Part 11: Working with Tables
 2. 
Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the Table button (or 
press Ctrl+L). Excel displays the Create Table dialog box and selects the 
entire contiguous range that includes the active cell pointer.
 3. 
Click OK. Excel creates the table, applies a default style, and adds a sort 
and filter arrow to the cells in the header row. Excel also displays the 
Table Tools Design tab on the Ribbon.
Formatting a Table
When you create a table, Excel applies a default style to the table. However, you 
can apply a different predefined style to the table or create a style from scratch. 
You can also apply formatting based on the contents of a cell or table column.
Applying a new style to a table
Excel identifies the following specific areas in a table that you can format 
automatically and independently: the header row, data rows, totals row, first 
column, and last column. Follow these steps to apply a new style to a table:
 1. 
Click any cell in the table and then click the Design tab.
 2. 
Select a new style from the Table Styles gallery. You can scroll the gallery 
options by clicking the upper (scroll) arrows on the right side of the 
gallery, or you can display a drop-down grid by clicking the arrow below 
the scroll arrows. You can preview a style by hovering the mouse pointer 
over a style. Click a style option to apply a style.
 3. 
In addition, or as an alternative, to Step 2, you can select style and display 
options from the Table Style Options group. Click to select or deselect the 
appropriate check boxes.
Remember: The styles you apply from the Table Styles gallery are based on the 
theme applied to the workbook. Therefore, if you change the workbook theme, 
both the table style and gallery styles change to match the new theme. See also 
“Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Formatting based on cell or column content
Formatting a table based on the contents of a cell or column contents (conditional 
formatting) is similar to formatting a non-table cell or range based on the contents 
of the cell or range. See “Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range,” 
and “Formatting a Range Using Comparative Visualizations,” both in Part 8.
However, note the following when you apply conditional formatting to a table:

Creating a Table — Inserting and Deleting Table Rows and Columns  177
 ✓ 
If you apply conditional formatting to an entire column, the formatting for 
the column is automatically extended if you add new rows to the table.
 ✓ 
Formatting is applied to a table in the following order: direct formatting 
(for example, formatting you apply from the Font group on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab) appears over table style formatting, and conditional formatting 
appears over direct formatting. For example, if you remove direct formatting, 
any table formatting is still there. Similarly, if you remove conditional 
formatting, any direct formatting is still applied.
Inserting a Totals Row in a Table
When you create a table, by default Excel does not include the totals row. 
However, if you need to total data in your table columns, you can add a totals 
row easily. Make sure that the cell pointer is in the table range, click the Design 
tab, and select the Totals Row check box in the Table Style Options group.
After you click the mouse pointer in a cell of the totals row, Excel adds a 
drop-down arrow to the cell. Clicking the arrow displays a convenient list of 
common functions you can apply (Sum, Average, Count, Standard Deviation, and 
so on). If you want to use a function that is not listed, you can choose the More 
Functions option and select the function in the Insert Function dialog box.
Inserting and Deleting Table Rows and Columns
You may need to insert new rows into a table to add data. Also, you may want to 
add a column to perform a calculation based on other columns in the table. 
Excel provides convenient methods for inserting rows and columns. You can 
also delete table rows and columns you no longer need.
Adding and deleting table rows
Choose one of the following methods to add rows to a table:
 ✓ 
To add a row above an existing table row (including the totals row), 
right-click a cell in the existing table row and choose Insert➪ Table Rows 
Above. If you right-click a cell in the last data row, you can add a row 
above or below the last row.
 ✓ 
If you use the Tab key to move to the next column when entering data in a 
row, Excel adds a new row automatically after you press the Tab key in the 
rightmost column of the last data row.

178  Part 11: Working with Tables
 ✓ 
If a blank row is immediately below the last data row, you can enter data 
in any cell in the blank row and Excel will add the row to the table. Table 
formatting (normal and conditional) and any column formulas are 
extended to include the new row.
To delete a table row, right-click any cell in the row and choose Delete➪Table 
Rows from the contextual menu. To delete multiple rows, select the rows,
 right-click within the selection and choose Delete➪Table Rows.
Adding and deleting table columns
Choose one of the following methods to add columns to a table:
 ✓ 
To add a column to the left of an existing table column, right-click a cell in 
the existing table column, and then choose Insert➪Table Columns to the 
Left from the contextual menu. If you right-click a cell in the rightmost 
table column, you can add a column to the left or right of the rightmost 
column. Excel provides a generic title for the column header that you can 
change to a more meaningful name.
 ✓ 
If a blank column is immediately to the right of the rightmost column, you 
can enter data in any cell in the blank column and Excel will add the 
column to the table. The table formatting is extended to the new column.
To delete a table column, right-click any cell in the column and choose 
Delete➪Table Columns from the contextual menu. To delete multiple columns, 
select the columns, right-click within the selection, and choose Delete➪Table 
Columns.
Remember: You cannot add individual cells to or remove individual cells from a 
table. You can add or remove only entire table rows or entire table columns.
Referencing Table Data in a Formula
In Excel, a table has a well-defined structure with identifiable parts, such as the 
entire table, the header row, the data area, and named columns. (See “Anatomy 
of a Table,” earlier in this part.) As such, you can reference various parts of a 
table by name instead of by the usual row and column references. When you 
create a table, Excel provides a generic name for the table (Table1, Table2 and 
so on). If you intend to reference table data in a formula using named table ele-
ments, you should change the name to something more descriptive, such as 
SalesData. To change Excel’s default table name, select any cell in the table, 
click the Design tab on the Ribbon, and enter a new name in the Table Name text 
box (located in the Properties group). The following rules apply to table and 
column names:

Inserting and Deleting Table Rows and Columns — Referencing Table Data in a Formula  179
 ✓ 
The table name must be different from any other names you create in the 
workbook and must follow Excel’s name creation rules. See also Part 6, 
“Creating and Using Names.”
 ✓ 
Column names must be unique within the table, although different tables 
can have the same column names.
 ✓ 
If a table name or column name changes, formulas that reference the name 
automatically update to include the new name.
 ✓ 
Excel updates table and column name references automatically as rows 
and columns are added to or removed from the table.
The reference that includes the table name and any of its identifiable parts is 
called a structured reference. The identifiable parts are also known as specifiers.
A structured reference can be unqualified or fully qualified. An unqualified 
reference does not include the table name. A fully qualified reference must 
include the table name.
Referencing table data outside the table
You must use a fully qualified structured reference when you reference table 
data in a formula that’s outside the table range. Use the following methods to 
reference table data in a formula:
 ✓ 
To reference all the data in the table, use the table name, or the table name 
and the #Data specifier. If you want to sum all the data in a table named 
SalesData, for example, enter
=SUM(SalesData) or SUM(SalesData[#Data])
 
 In the formula, SalesData[#Data] represents the structured reference.
 
 Note that the SUM function ignores any text in the structured reference.
 ✓ 
To reference the data in a table column, use the table name and a column 
qualifier in the form TableName[ColumnName]. For example, if you want 
to sum a column named Quarter1 in a table named SalesData, enter
=SUM(SalesData[Quarter1])
 ✓ 
Other table references are useful for some types of lookup formulas. To refer-
ence an entire table (the header row and all data rows), use the form 
TableName[#All]. To reference table headers only, use the form 
TableName[#Headers]. To reference an entire column (header and data) 
use the form TableName[[#All], [ColumnName]]. To reference just the 
header text of a column, use TableName [[#Headers], [ColumnName]].
 
 If you include a totals row in your table, you can reference a total by using 
the form TableName[[#Totals], [ColumnName]].

180  Part 11: Working with Tables
 
You can save time entering table name references in a formula by using the 
Formula AutoComplete feature, which lists the defined table names as you begin 
entering the name in the formula. After you enter a square bracket ([) following 
the table name, the AutoComplete feature lists the available specifiers (#All, 
#Totals, #Data, and so on). See also “Entering formulas manually,” in Part 4.
Referencing table data using a calculated column
A calculated column (sometimes called a calculated field) is simply a column 
that you add to the table that references table data in a formula. The formula 
references are similar to those in “Referencing table data outside the table,” in 
the preceding section, except you can use an unqualified structured reference 
because the calculated column is part of the table.
Follow these steps to add a calculated column and add a formula:
 1. 
Add a new column to the table. See “Inserting and Deleting Table Rows 
and Columns,” earlier in this part.
 2. 
Enter a formula that references the table in any cell of the new column. 
You can enter the formula manually or by pointing with the mouse. For 
example, if you have a table named SalesData and want to calculate the 
difference between the sales figures in the Quarter1 and Quarter2 columns, 
enter the following manually:
=[Quarter1]-[Quarter2]
 
 Note that after you enter the formula in the column, Excel evaluates the 
formula; that is, Excel uses an implicit intersection for each row.
 
 If you instead enter the formula by pointing, Excel qualifies the column refer-
ence with an at sign (@) and brackets the combined reference. For example:
=[@[Quarter1]]-[[@Quarter2]]
 
 To enter the formula by pointing with the mouse, type the equal sign (=), 
point to the Quarter1 column in the same row as the formula you’re entering, 
type the minus sign (–) and point to the Quarter2 column. As you type and 
point with the mouse, Excel completes the formula. See Figure 11-2.

The @ character is shorthand for the [#ThisRow], specifier and is new 
in Excel 2010.
 
 Excel uses the [#ThisRow], (@) specifier to evaluate the formula 
using explicit intersection. Either form of the formula (implicit or explicit 
intersection) returns the same result.
 3. 
After you complete the formula, press Enter. Excel fills the entire column 
with the formula.

Referencing Table Data in a Formula — Removing Duplicate Values from a Table  181
Figure 11-2
 
Remember: If you change the formula in any cell of a calculated column, Excel 
updates the formulas in all other cells in the column automatically. If you do 
not want Excel to update all other cells in the column, click the Smart Tag (the 
lightning bolt icon with the drop-down arrow) that appears next to the column 
after you update the formula and choose Undo Calculated Column from the menu.
Removing Duplicate Values from a Table
If you have a table with duplicated information, you might want to remove the 
rows containing the duplicates before analyzing the data. Excel provides many 
convenient options for removing duplicated data. For example, you can choose 
to remove duplicates if the entire row is duplicated (the default option) or you 
can choose to remove rows if the data in one or more columns is duplicated. 
Follow these steps to remove duplicated data from your table:
 1. 
Click any cell in the table, and then click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Remove Duplicates button. Excel selects the entire data area of 
the table and displays the Remove Duplicates dialog box (see Figure 11-3).
Figure 11-3
 
 3. 
If you want to remove rows in which all column data is duplicated, 
click OK. If you want to remove rows in which only data in one or more 
columns is duplicated (for example, a last name), select the column or col-
umns and click OK.

182  Part 11: Working with Tables
 
 
The duplicated data is removed from the table permanently. If the result of the 
removal operation is not what you want, you can undo the operation (click the 
undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z) and start over.
  If you want to retain your original data, you can select and copy the table to 
another worksheet. If you have a particularly large data range, make a copy of 
the worksheet instead of copying the table data.
Remember: You can remove duplicates in an ordinary (non-table) range. Select 
the range and click the Remove Duplicates button on the Ribbon’s Data tab.
Remember: If a column has date or numeric data, Excel uses the number 
formatting in the column to determine whether data is duplicated. For example, 
Excel does not consider the dates 12/31/2010 and Friday, December 31, 2010 to 
be duplicates, although internally it stores both representations identically.
Selecting Table Areas
Excel provides convenient methods for you to select table rows, table columns, 
or the entire table. These methods are particularly useful if, for example, you 
want to copy table data or move the table to another location or format entire 
columns conditionally:
 ✓ 
To select a table row, move the mouse pointer to the leftmost column in 
the row until the pointer changes into a right-pointing arrow. Then click 
the mouse to select the row. You can select a table row also by selecting 
any cell in the row and pressing Shift+spacebar.
 ✓ 
To select the data cells in a table column, move the mouse pointer to the 
header row until the pointer changes into a down-pointing arrow. Then 
click the mouse to select the data cells. If you want to select the entire 
table column, including the header and totals cells, click the mouse again. 
You can select the data cells of a table column also by selecting any cell in 
the column and pressing Ctrl+spacebar. Pressing Ctrl+spacebar again 
selects the entire table column.
 ✓ 
To select all data rows in a table, move the mouse pointer to the upper-left 
cell in the header row until the mouse changes into a diagonal arrow, and 
then click to select the data rows. Click the mouse again to select the 
entire table. You can select all data rows in the table also by pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+spacebar. Press Ctrl+Shift+spacebar again to select the entire 
table. Another way to select the entire table is to select any cell in the table 
and move the mouse pointer to any edge of the table until the pointer 
changes to an arrow with a cross at the tip. Then click to select the table.

Analyzing Data with 
PivotTables
A PivotTable report (or simply a PivotTable) is an interactive table that organizes and 
summarizes raw data. The PivotTable allows you summarize, filter, and view data in 
multiple dimensions to assist in your analysis.

Anatomy of a PivotTable
In contrast to a table, in which you present and analyze the details of your data, 
a PivotTable enables you to present and analyze your data in a summarized 
form. Moreover, with a PivotTable (see Figure 12-1), you can view different 
dimensions of your summarized data in hierarchical levels of detail.

to create a PivotTable from the source data. The task pane includes the 
field labels (column titles) from the source data and boxes that correspond 
to areas on the PivotTable.

Anatomy of a PivotTable — Adding a Slicer Report Filter  185
 ✓ 
Row labels: Fields that you want to summarize in rows.
 ✓ 
Field Item: An individual item in the row or column areas of the PivotTable.
 ✓ 
Column labels: Fields that you want to summarize in columns.
 ✓ 
Values: The data being summarized (for example, Sum of TotalPrice).
 ✓ 
Report filter: One or more of the fields in the Field List task pane used to 
filter the PivotTable report.
 ✓ 
Slicer: An interactive filter, similar to the report filter but having additional 
functionality.
Remember: To construct a PivotTable report, at a minimum you need to choose a 
field to summarize in the data area and one field for either the row or column 
area. Your choices depend on how you want to view your data.
Remember: The source data that feeds the PivotTable is held in an area of system 
memory known as a PivotCache. If you have sufficient memory and the source 
data comes from an external data source, you may able to create a PivotTable 
from source data that has more rows or columns than Excel supports. This is 
possible if, after summarization, the data fits within Excel’s row and column 
limits.

 A slicer provides filtering similar to a traditional PivotTable report filter but with 
the following additional capabilities:
 ✓ 
You can attach a slicer to more than one PivotTable, allowing you to filter 
multiple PivotTables simultaneously.
 ✓ 
A slicer displays the list of items that are filtered and unfiltered. A report 
filter can display only one filtered item at a time.
 ✓ 
You can drag a slicer anywhere on the worksheet or copy the slicer to 
another worksheet in the workbook. A report filter occupies a fixed area in 
the PivotTable and cannot be moved.
Unless you need to maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of 
Excel, a slicer is usually preferable to a report filter.
Creating a new slicer
You can create one or more slicers at the same time. Each slicer represents a 
field in the PivotTable field list and displays the items in the field. You can 
create a slicer for a field whether or not the field is already used in the 
PivotTable.

186  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
Follow these steps to create one or more slicers:
 1. 
Click anywhere in the PivotTable and then click the PivotTable Tools 
Option tab.
 2. 
In the Sort & Filter group, click the top part of the Insert Slicer button. 
Excel displays the Insert Slicers dialog box (see Figure 12-2).
Figure 12-2
 
 3. 
Select the check boxes for the field or fields you want to use to filter the 
PivotTable. Excel displays the slicer or slicers on the worksheet (refer to 
Figure 12-1, where we’ve created State/Province and Region slicers).
Copying, moving, deleting, and resizing a slicer
After you create a slicer, you can organize its location and size as follows:
 ✓ 
To move a slicer, simply hover the mouse pointer over the slicer until a 
black cross-arrow appears at the tip of the pointer. Then hold down the 
left mouse button and drag to the new location.
 ✓ 
To copy a slicer to another worksheet, right-click anywhere in the slicer and 
choose Copy from the menu (or select the slicer by clicking the header area 
and pressing Ctrl+C). Select the new worksheet, right-click anywhere, and 
choose Paste from the Paste Options gallery in the menu (or press Ctrl+V).
 ✓ 
To delete a slicer, select the slicer by clicking the header area and pressing 
Delete.

Adding a Slicer Report Filter  187
 ✓ 
To resize a slicer, hover the mouse pointer over an edge or the middle of a 
side until the pointer changes to a double-sided arrow. Then hold down 
the left mouse button and drag to resize.
Filtering a PivotTable with a slicer
As shown in Figure 12-1, a slicer displays a list of all the items in a field. If there 
are more items than the slicer can display simultaneously, you can use the 
scroll bar to the right of the slicer or resize the slicer to see additional items. 
You can use a slicer to filter a PivotTable in the following ways:
 ✓ 
To filter a single item, just click the item in the slicer.
 ✓ 
To filter nonconsecutive items, click the first item in the slicer, press and 
hold Ctrl, and select the other items.
 ✓ 
To filter consecutive items, click the first item in the slicer, press and hold 
Shift, and click the last item. Alternatively, click the first item and drag with 
the mouse to the last item.
 ✓ 
To clear all filters that are set in a slicer, click the Clear Filter button on the 
right side of the slicer header (refer to Figure 12-1).
Excel excludes all unfiltered items from the PivotTable. Note also that filtered 
and unfiltered items have different background colors.
Formatting a slicer
If you want to include a slicer in a report, you might want to change the default 
formatting. A typical report might include one or more PivotCharts and associated 
slicers. Because a PivotChart is associated with a PivotTable, filtering the 
PivotTable also filters the PivotChart. See also “Creating and Using a PivotChart,” 
later in this part.
Follow these steps to format a slicer:
 1. 
Click the slicer header to select it. Excel displays the Slicer Tools contextual 
tab on the Ribbon.
 2. 
Click the Options tab if it isn’t already selected. In the Slicer Styles group, 
select a style from the gallery. Click the arrow at the bottom right of the 
gallery to display all available styles.
 3. 
Click a new style from the gallery. The slicer formatting changes to reflect 
the new style.
 4. 
If you don’t like any of the available styles, choose New Slicer Style at the 
bottom of the available styles gallery. Excel displays the New Slicer Quick 
Style dialog box (see Figure 12-3).

188  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
Figure 12-3
 
 5. 
Provide a name for the style in the Name box.
 6. 
Select an element to format in the Slicer Element list box. Then click 
Format to display the Format Slicer Element dialog box.
 7. 
Select formatting options from the available tabs. Your choices are Font, 
Border, and Fill.
 8. 
Click OK to return to the New Slicer Quick Style dialog box. Repeat Steps 6 
and 7 for other slicer elements you want to format.
 9. 
After you complete your formatting changes, click OK to exit the New 
Slicer Quick Style dialog box. The new style appears in the Custom section 
of the Styles gallery.
 
 In many cases, you may want to change the format of elements in an existing 
style instead of creating a new style from scratch. In Step 4 of the preceding 
procedure, instead of choosing New Slicer Style, right-click the style you want to 
modify and choose Duplicate from the menu. Excel displays the Modify Quick 
Style dialog box. Continue from Step 5 to select the elements you want to modify.
Remember: You can’t directly change a built-in style, but you can create a 
duplicate of a built-in style and make the changes in the duplicate.
Associating a slicer with other PivotTables
After you create a new slicer for a PivotTable, you can associate the slicer with 
other PivotTables in the workbook. The other PivotTables must share the same 
data source as the original PivotTable. The simplest way to associate a slicer 
with another PivotTable is to create one or more copies of the original 
PivotTable. If you already created multiple copies of a PivotTable before you 
add a slicer, by default the slicer is associated with only the PivotTable you 
used to create the slicer.

Adding a Slicer Report Filter — Changing the Summarization of PivotTable Data  189
Follow these steps to associate a slicer with another copy of a PivotTable:
 1. 
Create one or more copies of the PivotTable if you did not already do so. 
See “Copying a PivotTable,” later in this part.
 2. 
Select the slicer you want to associate with the PivotTable copy or copies.
 3. 
Click the Slicer Tools Options tab and then click the PivotTable 
Connections button. Alternatively, you can right-click the slicer and 
choose PivotTable Connections from the contextual menu. Excel displays 
the PivotTable Connections dialog box.
 4. 
In the dialog box, place a check mark in the box next to the name of each 
PivotTable you want to associate with the slicer. The dialog box also dis-
plays the worksheet that contains each PivotTable in the list.
 5. 
Click OK after you complete your selections.
Changing the Summarization of PivotTable Data
When you add a numeric field to the values area of a PivotTable, by default 
Excel uses the Sum function to summarize the data. If you add a text field to the 
values area, Excel uses the Count function to summarize the text data. The 
Count function is the only way to summarize text data, but Excel provides several 
alternative options for summarizing numeric data. Use either of the following 
methods to select a different summarization function for a numeric field:
 ✓ 
Right-click within the numeric field in the values area of the PivotTable, 
choose Summarize Data By from the contextual menu, and then choose an 
option from the flyout menu. Excel displays the new summary for the 
selected field.
 ✓ 
Select any cell within the numeric field in the values area of the PivotTable, 
click the PivotTable Options tab on the Ribbon, click the Summarize Data 
By button, and then choose an option from the menu.
  
You can display different summarizations for the same numeric field in the 
PivotTable (for example, Sum and Average). For each new summarization, 
simply drag the field label from the field list in the task pane to the Values box 
(the Values box can have the same field multiple times). Each time you drag the 
field to the Values box, Excel adds the field to the values area of the PivotTable 
using the default summarization. To change the default, use the procedure 
outlined for changing the summarization.

190  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
Copying a PivotTable
Sometimes you want to use different views with a PivotTable — say for analyzing 
the PivotTable data directly, for referencing specific PivotTable data in a formula, 
or for displaying different PivotCharts. It would be tedious if you had to constantly 
drag fields on and off the PivotTable every time you needed a different view of 
the data. Instead, you can create one or more copies of the PivotTable and 
arrange the fields the way you want on each copy. Use either of the following 
methods to copy a PivotTable:
 ✓ 
The quickest way to create a copy of a PivotTable is to copy the worksheet 
in which the PivotTable is located. You can make as many copies of the 
worksheet as you need. See “Copying a Worksheet,” in Part 3.
 ✓ 
If you have multiple PivotTables in a worksheet but need to copy only one 
of the PivotTables, follow these steps:
 1. Click anywhere in the PivotTable and click the PivotTable Tools 
Options tab.
 2. In the Actions group, click the arrow at the end of the Select button 
and choose Entire PivotTable from the menu. Excel highlights the 
entire PivotTable.
 3. Right-click in the PivotTable and choose Copy from the contextual 
menu, or press Ctrl+C.
 4. Select the destination worksheet and the location for the upper-left 
cell of the PivotTable row area.
 5. Right-click and choose Paste from the Paste Options gallery in the 
contextual menu.
Creating and Using a PivotChart
It’s difficult to detect trends and patterns when you’re working with PivotTable 
data, even when the data is highly summarized. To help with this endeavor, you 
can create a PivotChart. You can choose to create a PivotChart at the same time 
you create a PivotTable.
PivotCharts are similar to standard Excel charts but with the following 
differences:
 ✓ 
The PivotChart is interactive. You can filter and adjust fields directly in the 
PivotChart. Any change you make to the PivotChart is reflected in the 
underlying PivotTables.
 ✓ 
Any subtotals and totals in the PivotTable are not included in the chart.

Copying a PivotTable — Creating and Using a PivotChart  191
 ✓ 
The chart series are based on columnar data in the values area of the 
chart. The series cannot be in rows. Furthermore, the column labels are 
used for the series names. (Refer to Figure 12-1.)
 ✓ 
The field items in the row area of the PivotTable are used for category 
labels. (Refer to Figure 12-1.)
 ✓ 
PivotCharts do not support X Y scatter, bubble and stock chart types.
If you are unfamiliar with some of the terminology used in this section, see 
“Anatomy of a Chart,” in Part 10.
Creating a PivotChart
Follow the steps for “Creating a PivotTable Report,” immediately following in 
this part. However, in Step 2, select the arrow part of the PivotTable button and 
then choose PivotChart from the menu. A PivotChart cannot exist without an 
associated PivotTable, so Excel creates a PivotTable with the PivotChart. 
Because you don’t specify a chart type when you create a PivotChart in this 
manner, Excel uses its default chart type (2-D column chart) and default chart 
formatting. If you want to change the chart type, follow the steps for “Changing 
the Chart Type for an Existing Chart or Data Series,” in Part 10.
Note that the PivotChart is blank until you add fields to the PivotTable.
Alternatively, you can create a PivotChart after you create the PivotTable by 
following these steps:
 1. 
Click anywhere within the PivotTable and then click the PivotChart button 
on the PivotTable Tools Options tab.
 2. 
In the Insert Chart dialog box, choose the chart category on the left and 
the chart style on the right. Click OK to create the chart.
Using a PivotChart
After you create a PivotChart, you can use it interactively. The chart includes 
embedded field buttons, and the position of the field buttons corresponds 
roughly to the field locations in the PivotTable. See Figure 12-4.
In Figure 12-4, we used the Product Category button on the chart to filter out the 
Accessories and Clothing categories.
You can remove some or all filter buttons on the chart. To remove all buttons, 
select the chart, click the PivotChart Tools Analyze tab on the Ribbon, and then 
click the icon portion of the Field Buttons split button. To remove buttons that 
correspond to the Row, Column, Values, or Report Filter area of the PivotTable, 
click the label and arrow portion of the Field Buttons split button and then clear 
the appropriate check boxes on the menu.

192  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
Figure 12-4
 
Note that on the chart, the area corresponding to the PivotTable Row area is 
called the Axis area (the horizontal axis) and the area corresponding to the 
PivotTable Column area is called the Legend area.
Creating a PivotTable Report
The data for your PivotTable can come from an external data source (such as a 
database) or an Excel range or table. See also Part 11, “Working with Tables.” 
Although you can create a PivotTable from an ordinary (non-table) worksheet 
range, using a table is preferable — if the table expands or shrinks, after you 
refresh the PivotTable, the data for it is based on the new table range.
To create a PivotTable report from a table, follow these steps:
 1. 
Move the cell pointer to any cell in the table.
 2. 
Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon and then click the top part of the 
PivotTable button. Excel displays the Create Pivot Table dialog box and 
outlines the table’s data area. Excel inserts the table name in the Table/
Range box.

Creating and Using a PivotChart — Formatting a PivotTable Report  193
 3. 
In the lower half of the dialog box, specify where you want to locate the 
PivotTable and then click OK. If you select the Existing Worksheet option, 
click the Location box and then click the cell in the worksheet that will be 
the upper-left corner of the PivotTable. Excel displays the PivotTable Field 
List task pane and the area on the worksheet that will hold the PivotTable. 
In addition, Excel displays PivotTable tools contextual tabs on the Ribbon.
 4. 
In the Field List task pane, select the check boxes next to the field labels of 
the fields that you want to include or drag the field labels to the boxes in the 
lower portion of the task pane. These boxes correspond to the label areas in 
the PivotTable where your selected fields will appear (refer to Figure 12-1).
 
 If you select check boxes, Excel chooses the boxes in the lower portion of 
the task pane to place the field labels based on the following assumptions:
 • Field labels for numeric fields (such as TotalPrice) are placed in the 
Values box.
 • Field labels for non-numeric fields are placed in the Row Labels box.
 
 To override Excel’s default behavior, drag the field labels from the list in the 
top window to the appropriate boxes in the lower part of the task pane.
 
 After Excel places field labels in the boxes (or you drag the labels to the 
boxes manually), the field data appears in the appropriate PivotTable label 
areas on the worksheet. By default, field labels in the Values box sum the 
corresponding data that appears in the values area of the PivotTable.
Figure 12-1 demonstrates the hierarchical nature of summarizing data in a 
PivotTable and the relationship between the arrangement of the fields in the 
task pane and the worksheet display.
Excel provides + and – indicators next to each level header on the worksheet, so 
you can quickly expand or collapse a level of detail in the PivotTable summary. 
Furthermore, when you create a PivotTable, Excel displays the PivotTable in a 
Compact view by default. The Compact view is similar to that shown in Figure 
12-1, except field headers (labels) are not displayed. To see the field labels, click 
the drop-down arrow to the right of Row Labels or Column Labels.
See also “Modifying a PivotTable’s Structure,” later in this part.
Formatting a PivotTable Report
When you create a PivotTable, Excel applies a default style to the PivotTable. 
However, you can apply a different predefined style to the PivotTable or create 
a new style. You can also apply formatting based on the contents of a cell or a 
PivotTable field.

194  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
Applying a new style to a PivotTable
Follow these steps to apply a new predefined style to a PivotTable:
 1. 
Click any cell in the PivotTable and then click the Design tab.
 2. 
Select a new style from the PivotTable Styles gallery. Scroll the gallery 
options by clicking the upper (scroll) arrows on the right side of the 
gallery, or display a drop-down grid by clicking the arrow below the scroll 
arrows. Preview a style by hovering the mouse pointer over the style.
 3. 
In addition, or as an alternative, to Step 2, you can select style and display 
options from the PivotTable Style Options group. Select or deselect the 
appropriate check boxes.
Remember: The styles you apply from the PivotTable Styles gallery are based on 
the theme applied to the workbook. Therefore, if you change the workbook 
theme, the applied PivotTable style and the gallery styles change to match the 
new theme. See also “Formatting with Themes,” in Part 1.
Formatting based on data values
Formatting a PivotTable based on data values (conditional formatting) is 
similar to formatting a non-PivotTable cell or range based on the contents of the 
cell or range. See “Formatting Based on the Contents of a Cell or Range” and 
“Formatting a Range using Comparative Visualizations,” both in Part 8.
After you select a cell or range of cells in the values area and apply a conditional 
formatting rule, a Formatting Options Smart Tag (a small icon to the right of the 
selection) appears (see Figure 12-5).
Figure 12-5
 
Clicking the Smart Tag provides the following options:
 ✓ 
Selected cells: This is the default option. Excel applies the conditional 
formatting to the selected cells only.
 ✓ 
All cells showing “Sum of fieldname” values, where fieldname is the name 
of a values field (for example, TotalPrice): Excel applies the conditional 
formatting to all cells showing Sum of fieldname values in the PivotTable, 

Formatting a PivotTable Report  195
regardless of the field’s hierarchical level, and includes subtotals and 
grand totals. If the displays of the subtotals or grand totals are turned on, 
this option is useful for summarizations that aren’t sums (otherwise the 
subtotals and grand totals will skew any conditional formatting based on 
the range of values in the field). An example of a useful summarization for 
this option is “Average of fieldname.”
 ✓ 
All cells showing “Sum of fieldname” values for RowField and ColumnField, 
where fieldname is the name of a values field (for example, TotalPrice), 
RowField is the name of a row field, and ColumnField is the name of a 
column field. Excel applies the conditional formatting to all cells showing 
Sum of fieldname values in the PivotTable for the row and column fields 
that correspond to the cells you selected for conditional formatting and 
excludes subtotals. ColumnField is excluded from the option if the 
PivotTable doesn’t include any column fields.
In the preceding list, we assume that the values field is summarized using the 
Sum function (Excel’s default). The actual name for the option depends on the 
summarization function applied to the field. If the values are averaged, for 
example, the name will be “All cells showing ‘Average of fieldname’” values.
Remember: If you select either of the last two options in the preceding list, Excel 
extends the conditional formatting to include the new data after the PivotTable 
is refreshed.
Remember: Formatting is applied to a PivotTable in the following order: Direct 
formatting (for example, formatting that you apply from the Font group on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab) appears over PivotTable style formatting and conditional 
formatting appears over direct formatting.
Changing the number format of a PivotTable field
In creating a PivotTable report, Excel doesn’t retain any special number 
formatting that you may have applied to your original data. If you apply a 
currency format to your source data, for example, and then use that data in the 
PivotTable, Excel doesn’t retain the currency formatting in the PivotTable report.
To change the number format for a field in the PivotTable report:
 1. 
Select any cell in the field in which you want to change the number 
format. Most often, you will use this option to change the number format 
in the values area of the PivotTable, but you can change the number 
formats of numeric or date fields in the row or column areas.
 2. 
Right-click and choose Field Settings or Value Field Settings from the 
contextual menu (the name on the contextual menu depends on whether 
you’re changing the number format of a row or column field or a values 
field). Excel displays the Field Settings or Value Field Settings dialog box.
 3. 
Click the Number Format button. Excel displays the Format Cells dialog box.

196  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
 4. 
In the Category list box, select a number format category and then select 
a format on the right side of the Format Cells dialog box.
 5. 
Click OK to exit the Format Cells dialog box, and then click OK again to 
exit the Field Settings or Value Field Settings dialog box.
 
 A quick way to change the number format of cells in a values field is to right-
click a cell in the field and then choose Number Format to display the Format 
Cells dialog box.
Remember: After you apply a number format option using Field Settings, Value 
Field Settings, or Number Format options in the contextual menu, the formatting 
is applied to any new data that appears after you refresh the PivotTable. If you 
want to apply formatting (number, font, background, and so on) to only a cell 
or a group of cells, select the cell or range, right-click in the selection, choose 
Format Cells from the contextual menu, and then make your selections in 
the Format Cells dialog box that appears.
Grouping PivotTable Items
A handy feature enables you to group specific items in a single field of a 
PivotTable report. If one of the fields in your source data consists of dates, for 
example, the PivotTable displays a separate row or column for every date. You 
may find that grouping the dates into months, quarters, or years is a more useful 
way to create a PivotTable report with a date field.
Remember: If you’re grouping by date or number, the field you select for 
grouping can’t have blank items. Also, if you’re grouping by date, all cells in the 
source data date field must carry one of Excel’s recognized date or time formats.
Creating a date group
To create a date group PivotTable, follow these steps:
 1. 
Right-click a cell in the date field that you want to group and choose 
Group from the contextual menu. Excel displays the Grouping dialog box 
(see Figure 12-6).
 2. 
Select the grouping(s) you want. Note the following when selecting your 
grouping(s):
 • To select more than one grouping, click each grouping option in turn. 
Click a grouping option a second time to deselect it.
 • To group weekly or biweekly, select the Days option and specify 7 or 
14, respectively, in the Number of Days box.

Formatting a PivotTable Report — Grouping PivotTable Items  197
 • If you select a multiple days grouping and then select another 
grouping (for example, months, quarters, or years), Excel ignores the 
multiple days group because it’s not possible to group across grouping 
boundaries. For example, if you attempt to group by week and by 
month, the weekdays can span across two months, so it’s impossible to 
accommodate both groupings simultaneously.
 • In the dialog box, Excel automatically chooses the starting and ending 
dates for the group based on the range of dates in the PivotTable.
 3. 
To manually specify the starting date or ending date or both, clear the 
check box next to Starting At or Ending At and enter a new date in the text 
box. For example, if you’re grouping by week and want to ensure that the 
week is grouped from Sunday to Saturday, in the Starting At text box, 
enter the Sunday date prior to Excel’s selected starting date (unless 
Excel’s starting date is Sunday).
 4. 
Click OK. Excel creates the grouping(s).
Figure 12-6
 
 
 If your date field covers multiple years and you elect to group by month or 
quarter or both, you should also include the Years grouping. If you don’t include 
the Years grouping, each month or quarter will be summarized for all years, not 
for each year.
Creating a number group
If you include a numeric field (or a text field that looks like a number) in the row 
or column areas of the PivotTable, you can create a number group. For example, 
if you have a row field with a lot of order or invoice numbers, you might want to 
create a more compact report. To create a number group, follow these steps:
 1. 
Right-click a cell in the field in which you want to create a number group 
and choose Group from the menu. Excel displays the Grouping dialog box 
and automatically chooses the starting and ending numbers for the group.

198  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
 2. 
To manually specify the starting number or ending number or both, clear 
the check box next to Starting At or Ending At and enter a new number in 
the text box.
 3. 
In the By text box, specify the number that you want to group by.
 4. 
Click OK. Excel creates the grouping.
Creating a text group
Excel allows you to create text groups. A text group might be useful, for exam-
ple, if you want to group multiple states into sales territories. Follow these steps 
to create a text group:
 1. 
Select the cells in the field that you want to group. If the items that you 
want to group aren’t next to each other, you can make a multiple selection 
by holding Ctrl and then selecting the items that will make up the group.
 2. 
Right-click any cell in the selection and choose Group from the contextual 
menu. Excel automatically creates the group with a generic title, such as 
Group1, Group2 and so on.
 3. 
To change the name of the group to something more meaningful, click the 
cell with the new group name and then type a new name in the formula bar.
Modifying a PivotTable Report
A PivotTable is a special type of range, and (except for formatting) you can’t 
manipulate it like a normal range. For example, you can’t insert or delete rows, 
edit results, or move cells. If you attempt to do so, Excel displays an error 
message. However, you can make certain modifications to the layout or structure 
of your PivotTable, some of which are described in this section.
Modifying a report layout
When you create a PivotTable, by default Excel uses the new Compact layout, in 
which the row and column field headings are hidden. This layout is useful if you 
have many fields in your report because it minimizes horizontal space on the 
worksheet and can make reading the report easier. You can, however, use one of 
the following alternative layouts:
 ✓ 
Outline: This layout is similar to the Compact layout, except it displays the 
individual field headings.
 ✓ 
Tabular: In this layout, the first item in a sublevel field appears not on a 
separate row (refer to Figure 12-1) but on the same row as its upper level 
(parent) field item.

Grouping PivotTable Items — Modifying a PivotTable Report  199
To change the report layout, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the Report 
Layout button on the Design tab, and then choose a layout option from the menu.
 
E
X
C
E
L

With all standard PivotTable layouts, by default, the parent field item names 
are not repeated when the parent has multiple children. In Figure 12-1, because 
the subcategory items Bottles and Cages, Helmets, and Tires and Tubes have 
children in the ProductName field, the cells between each subcategory item are 
empty (for example, empty cells are between Bottles and Cages and Cleaners, 
Helmets and Hydration Packs, and so on). The implication of these empty cells 
is that you can’t use lookup and other formulas that work with a traditional 
table of data.
In Excel 2010, you can fill the empty rows in the PivotTable by repeating the 
parent item names. Click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the PivotTable Tools 
Design tab, click the Report Layouts button, and then choose Repeat All Item 
Labels from the menu.
Remember: The Repeat All Item Labels option applies to all fields in the 
PivotTable. Also, it is best to use the option with the Tabular report layout and 
any subtotals turned off.
Modifying a report structure
The power behind a PivotTable lies in its ability to display your summarized data 
in many dimensions by rearranging fields in the row, column, and values areas of 
the report and adding report filters in the report filter area. Use the following 
techniques to rearrange the report structure to display your data differently:
 ✓ 
To add fields to the report, drag the field labels from the field list in the 
task pane to the appropriate label boxes below the field list. To remove a 
field from the report, either drag the field label off the appropriate label 
box or clear the check box next to the field name in the field list.
 ✓ 
To move fields between the row, column, and report filter areas of the 
report, drag the field labels between label boxes in the task pane.
 ✓ 
To rearrange levels in the row or column areas of the report, click and 
drag a field label in the row or column label box above or below the 
appropriate field labels in the same label box.
 
 You can move fields also by clicking the field labels in the task pane label boxes 
and selecting a move option from the menu.
  If you have a large PivotTable, you can experience delays after adding, removing, 
or moving fields in the table because the updates may take some time for Excel 
to complete. If you’re adding, removing, or moving many fields at a time, you 
can experience multiple delays, which can be annoying. To circumvent the 
problem, select the Defer Layout Update check box at the bottom of the task 
pane. Then to update the PivotTable after you complete the structural changes, 
click the Update button to the right of the Defer Layout Update check box.

200  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
Displaying and hiding subtotals and grand totals
Sometimes, you may want to view your report with subtotals above or below a 
group or you may want to hide the subtotals display. Also, you may want to 
display grand totals in rows or columns only, or not at all. To change the display 
option for subtotals, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the Subtotals button 
on the Design tab, and then choose an option from the menu. To change the 
display option for grand totals, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click the Grand 
Totals button on the Design tab, and then choose an option from the menu.
  
To turn off subtotals for only a single field, make sure that subtotals are turned on 
for the entire report, right-click an item in the field, and choose Subtotal fieldname 
from the contextual menu, where fieldname is the name of the field whose subtotal 
you’re turning off (for example, ProductName). To display subtotals for only one 
field, make sure that subtotals are turned off for the entire report, right-click an 
item in the field, and choose Subtotal fieldname from the contextual menu.
Expanding and collapsing field item levels
Expanding field item levels in your PivotTable report allows you to see sublevel 
item details in your report summary, and collapsing item levels allows you to 
hide sublevel details in your report summary. Each higher-level field item has a 
+/– button that expands or collapses all sublevels below the field item. Or 
expand or collapse to other levels of details as follows:
 ✓ 
To expand all sublevel items in a field, right-click an item in the field, 
choose Expand/Collapse from the contextual menu, and then choose 
Expand Entire Field from the flyout menu. To collapse all sublevel items in 
a field, repeat the preceding but choose Collapse Entire Field from the 
flyout menu (see Figure 12-7).
 ✓ 
To expand a field item down to a specific sublevel, right-click an item in 
the field, choose Expand/Collapse from the contextual menu, and then 
choose the field name from the bottom portion of the flyout menu.
Figure 12-7
 

Modifying a PivotTable Report — Using Custom Calculations  201
Refreshing a PivotTable Report
If the source data that a PivotTable report uses changes, the PivotTable doesn’t 
update automatically. You must refresh the PivotTable manually. To refresh a 
PivotTable, click a cell in the PivotTable and then click Refresh on the Design 
tab, or right-click anywhere in the PivotTable and choose Refresh from the 
contextual menu.
Renaming a PivotTable
After you create a PivotTable, Excel provides a generic name for it, such as 
PivotTable1, PivotTable2, and so on. It’s a good idea to provide a meaningful 
name for the PivotTable, especially if your workbook has multiple PivotTables. 
Renaming a PivotTable is simple. Click anywhere in the PivotTable and then 
click the PivotTable Tools Options tab. On the far left of the Options tab is the 
PivotTable group. Enter a name in the PivotTable Name box.
Using Custom Calculations
Custom calculations are simply a list of predefined calculations, such as running 
totals or ratios, that Excel provides to allow you to perform powerful data analysis. 
Follow these steps to add a custom calculation to a PivotTable:
 1. 
Add the field for which you want to create the custom calculation to the 
values area of the PivotTable. To see a standard summarization and a 
custom calculation for the same field, add the field to the values area twice.
 2. 
Click anywhere in the appropriate value field and choose a custom 
calculation using either of the following methods:
 • Click the PivotTable Tools Options tab on the Ribbon, click the Show 
Value As button, and then choose an option from the list.
 • Right-click in the value field, choose Show Value As from the menu, and 
then choose an option from the flyout menu.
 3. 
If necessary, select a base field or a base field and a base item. (Although 
some custom calculations require no additional user input after you make 
a selection, others require you to select a base field or a base field and a 
base item.)
 
 In Figure 12-8, I added the SalesAmount field several times to the 
PivotTable to illustrate how you use custom calculations requiring a base 

202  Part 12: Analyzing Data with PivotTables
field and a base item. I renamed each added field by clicking the title and 
entering a new name in the formula bar.
Figure 12-8
 
 
 Figure 12-8 shows a standard summarization and two running totals: one 
for Month as the base field and another for Year as the base field. Note 
that Excel restarts the running total for each new parent item; you cannot 
alter this behavior. For example, Year is the parent of Month, and the 
month running totals restart for each year.
 
 
 If you want to create a month running total that does not reset at the 
beginning of each year, you need a field that combines year and month in 
a single field. This field must be created in the PivotTable’s data source.
 
 Figure 12-8 also shows a percent difference custom calculation. The base 
field for the calculation is Month and the base item is Previous (in this 
case, the previous month). You can also select a specific item. (For example, 
if you select Jan as the base item, Excel will calculate the difference 
between the January total and the individual totals for each succeeding 
month.)
Remember: All custom calculations are based on the standard sum aggregate for 
a value field.

Sorting and Filtering 
Your Data
In the process of data analysis, you will often want to sort and filter your data. 
Whether working in tables or PivotTables, Excel provides powerful tools for sorting 
and filtering your data.
 
In this part . . .

✓ Filtering Data in a PivotTable and Table
✓ Sorting Data in a PivotTable and Table
Part 13

204  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
Creating a Custom Sort List
Most of your sorting activities will involve sorting a column or field in ascending 
or descending order. However, sometimes the standard sort options for text 
fields are not appropriate, such as when sorting days of the weeks or months of 
the year. A standard alphabetical sort on months will place April and August at 
the top of an ascending sort and September and October at the top of a 
descending sort. You usually want the months to appear in the chronological or 
reverse date order.
Excel includes four custom lists, and you can also define your own. Excel 
custom lists are as follows:
 ✓ 
Abbreviated days: Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
 ✓ 
Days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
 ✓ 
Abbreviated months: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, 
Nov, Dec
 ✓ 
Months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, 
September, October, November, December
To create a custom list, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the Ribbon’s File tab and then click the Options button. Excel 
displays the Excel Options dialog box.
 2. 
Click the Advanced tab and scroll down to the General section.
 3. 
At the bottom of the General section, click the Edit Custom Lists button. 
Excel displays the Custom Lists dialog box. See Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1
 

Creating a Custom Sort List — Filtering a PivotTable Report  205
 4. 
In the Custom Lists window, select the New List entry.
 5. 
Enter your list in the List Entries text box. Press Enter after you type each 
list entry, or separate each entry with a comma.
 6. 
Click Add and then click OK twice to exit the dialog boxes.
Your custom sort list is now available for use in a table, a PivotTable, or even a 
standard worksheet range.
 
 If you have a range in your worksheet that you want to use as a custom sort 
list, in Step 4 click in the Import List from Cells box, select the range in the 
worksheet, and then click the Import button.
Filtering a PivotTable Report
In most ways, filtering a PivotTable is similar to filtering a table (see “Filtering 
Data in a Table,” later in this part). In the case of PivotTables, however, you’re 
filtering summarized data as opposed to a detailed dataset.
Filtering a PivotTable based on individual field items
Follow these steps to filter fields in your PivotTable based on individual field 
items:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the row or column field that you want 
to filter. If you’re using the Compact report layout, the individual field 
headings aren’t shown but are represented by a Row Labels header (in 
the row area), a Column Labels header (in the column area), or both. Click 
the arrow on the Row Labels or Column Labels header. Excel displays sort 
and filter options. Figure 13-2 shows the sort and filter options in the 
Compact Report Layout.
 2. 
If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field 
you want to filter in the Select Field drop-down list. The lower portion of 
the window displays the field items in a window. By default, Excel selects 
all items. If you want to display one or only a few entries, you can clear 
the Select All check box and select the items you want displayed. 
Alternatively, if you want to hide only a few items, clear the check boxes 
next to these items but do not clear the Select All check box.
 3. 
Click OK. In the PivotTable, Excel displays the items you selected in Step 2 
and hides all cleared items. Excel also adds a filter icon (a small funnel) to 
the field drop-down arrow and to the right of the field label in the task 
pane to indicate that a filter is applied to the field.

206  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
Figure 13-2
 
 4. 
To filter additional fields, repeat Steps 2 and 3.
 
 If your PivotTable includes a report filter, you can select multiple items to 
display or filter by clicking the report filter drop-down arrow and then selecting 
or deselecting items in the window. Make sure that the Select Multiple Items 
check box is selected.
Filtering a PivotTable based on a field text search
The procedures for filtering a PivotTable based on a field text search are similar 
to the procedures outlined for filtering a table based on a column text search. 
See “Filtering a table based on a column text search,” later in this part.
If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field you 
want to filter from the Select Field drop-down list in the Row Labels or Column 
Labels sort and filter options (click the arrow next to Row Labels or Column 
Labels to display the options). See “Filtering a PivotTable based on individual 
field items,” immediately preceding this section.
Filtering a PivotTable based on field data type
Similar to tables, a field can be filtered by data type (that is, value, label, or date).
To filter a PivotTable field based on date, number, or label criteria, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the field header of the field you want to filter. If you’re 
using the Compact report layout, individual field headings aren’t shown. 
In this case, click the arrow on Row Labels or Column Labels. Excel dis-
plays the sort and filter options.

Filtering a PivotTable Report — Filtering Data in a Table  207
 2. 
If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field 
you want to filter from the Select Field drop-down list. Above the field 
items window, choose the datatype Filters option (where datatype is Label, 
Number, or Date, depending on the data type of the field you’re filtering). 
Each row or column field in a PivotTable has either a Value filter and a 
Label filter or a Value filter and a Date filter.
 3. 
Choose a filter option from the flyout menu.
 4. 
Complete the dialog box for the filter option and then click OK.
Clearing PivotTable filters
During your analysis of the data in a PivotTable, you may have applied multiple 
filters to one or more fields. You can manually remove the filters one by one, but 
Excel provides a quicker way to remove filters from your PivotTable:
 ✓ 
To clear filters from a single field, click the arrow on the field header of the 
field from which you want to remove filters (either on the PivotTable or 
the task pane field list). If you’re using the Compact report layout, click the 
arrow on Row Labels or Column Labels to display the sort and filter 
options. Then choose Clear Filter from fieldname, where fieldname is the 
name of the field whose filters you’re clearing (for example, ProductName). 
If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field 
from which you want to remove the filters from the Select Field drop-down 
list from the sort and filter options.
 ✓ 
To clear all filters in the PivotTable, click anywhere in the PivotTable, click 
the Sort & Filter button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and then choose Clear 
from the menu.
Filtering Data in a Table
Filtering data is one of the most common activities performed with a table. 
Often, you want to view or analyze a subset of the data in a large dataset. When 
Excel creates a table, it includes a sort-and-filter drop-down arrow to the right of 
each column header. After you filter your table, the status bar displays the 
number of rows visible.
Remember: You can use Excel’s filtering features in a standard (non-table) range. 
Select the range, click the Sort & Filter button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and 
choose Filter from the menu to add the Sort & Filter drop-down arrows to the 
header row. A worksheet can have only one sort and filter range but can have 
many tables, each with its own sort and filter settings.

208  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
Remember: If your table data was imported from an external range, your table 
filters and sort orders are normally reapplied after you refresh the range 
(import the latest data). If you add data rows manually, however, you must click 
the Sort & Filter button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and then choose Reapply 
from the menu before Excel will update the table.
Filtering a table based on individual column entries
Follow these steps to filter your table data based on the individual entries in a 
column:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the column you want to filter. Excel 
displays the sort and filter options (see Figure 13-3).
Figure 13-3
 
 2. 
The lower portion of the window displays the unique column entries in a 
window. By default, Excel selects all entries. If you want to display rows 
for one or only a few entries, clear the Select All check box and individually 
select the items you want displayed. Alternatively, if you want to hide 
rows for only a few entries, clear the check boxes next to these entries but 
do not clear the Select All check box.
 
 Note that the list can display a maximum of 10,000 unique entries in the 
column.
 3. 
Click OK. In the table, Excel displays rows for all the entries you selected 
in Step 2 and hides all rows for the cleared entries. If your table uses an 
alternative row-banding style, the banding is preserved after you filter 
table rows. Excel also adds a filter icon (a small funnel) on the column 
drop-down to indicate that a filter is applied to the column.
 4. 
To filter additional columns, repeat Steps 2 and 3.

Filtering Data in a Table  209
If your column has a series of date entries (month, day, year), Excel allows you 
to filter at the year, month, or day levels. In the column items list window, only 
the year level is listed initially. If you click the plus sign (+) next to a year, the 
months for that year are listed. Clicking the plus sign next to the month displays 
individual day entries for that month.

 Excel 2010 provides a powerful new column filter in the form of a text search 
box, located just above the individual items list in the column sort and filter 
drop-down list. This new filter is useful in two significant ways:
 ✓ 
Because the individual items list in the column sort and filter drop-down 
list is limited to displaying a maximum of 10,000 unique items, you cannot 
use this filter if your data set might contain more than the display limit. 
The search box overcomes this problem.
 ✓ 
Even if you don’t exceed the column filter drop-down list’s display limit, it 
can be tedious scrolling through a large list looking for items to filter.
You can use the search box to include items to filter (remain visible) or to 
exclude items to filter.
Follow these steps to include items in your filter list:
 1. 
Click the column sort and filter arrow. In the search box, enter the first 
item you want to include in your filter. As you type, Excel filters the list 
based on the characters you enter (see Figure 13-4).
Figure 13-4
 
 2. 
As the list narrows, you can select all or some items. To exclude items, 
clear the check boxes next to the items.

210  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
 3. 
After you finish making your selections, select the box labeled Add 
Current Selection to Filter.
 4. 
Click OK. Excel filters the table to show only the items you selected.
 5. 
If you want to include additional items in your filter list, repeat Steps 1–4.
 
 When you’re adding additional items to your filter list, if you don’t select the 
box labeled Add Current Selection to Filter, the new items will replace the 
previous filter list instead of being added to the previous filter list.
Follow these steps to exclude items from your filter list:
 1. 
Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding procedure.
 2. 
After you finish making your selections, select the box labeled Add 
Current Selection to Filter and deselect the box labeled (Select All Search 
Results). These actions effectively exclude items from your filter — that 
is, everything else is automatically selected.
Remember: The search text you enter is not case-sensitive.
 
 You can combine the two techniques discussed in this section into a single 
filter. Suppose that you’ve narrowed the list of items you want to include in your 
filter but you still want to exclude some items. To accomplish this task, follow 
the steps for the first procedure and then the steps for the second procedure.
 
 You can use wildcard characters in your search. Use the * character to represent 
one or more characters before, between, or after any search text you enter. For 
example, *500*Black* will locate all items with 500 and Black in the name, with 
any number of characters before 500, between 500 and Black, and after Black. 
On the other hand, ?500?Black? will locate all items with only a single character 
before 500, between 500 and Black, and after Black. You can combine wildcard 
characters in your search text.
Filtering a table based on column data type
Suppose you have a table column that contains dates. But instead of filtering the 
column based on individual dates, you want to display dates for the current 
month, last month, last quarter, or year to date. Or suppose you have a numeric 
column and want to display records exceeding a certain value or lying between 
two values. Or perhaps you have a text column and you want to display records 
that begin with certain text or contain certain text. Excel provides many filtering 
options that you can apply based on the type of data you have in a column.
To filter table data based on date, number, or text criteria, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the column you want to filter. Excel 
displays the sort and filter options.

Filtering Data in a Table  211
 2. 
Immediately above the window that displays individual column entries, 
choose the datatype Filters option (where datatype is Text, Number, or 
Date, depending on the data type of the column you’re filtering).
 3. 
Choose a specific filter option from the flyout menu or choose Custom 
Filter at the bottom of the menu to display a dialog box that offers 
additional options.
 4. 
If your choice in Step 3 displays a dialog box, complete the dialog box 
options and then click OK.
Filtering a table based on cell color
Excel allows you to filter by cell color. Colors are cell background or font colors 
applied manually or by conditional formatting. Colors can also include color 
scales and icon sets.
Remember: You can filter by only one color at a time.
To filter your table data based on color formatting, follow these steps:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the column with the color formatting you 
want to filter. Excel displays the sort and filter options.
 2. 
Choose Filter by Color, and then choose a color option from the flyout 
menu. You can also choose the No Fill option to filter out all cells with 
font or background formatting.
Remember: Colors for filtering do not include colors defined in the table style, so 
your table formatting is preserved after color filtering.
Clearing table filters
While analyzing data in a table, you may have applied multiple filters to one 
or more columns. You can manually remove the filters one by one, but Excel 
provides a quicker way to remove filters from your table:
 ✓ 
To clear filters from a single column, click the arrow on the column header 
of the column from which you want to remove filters. Then, from the sort 
and filter options, choose Clear Filter from columnname, where column-
name is the name of the column whose filters you’re clearing (for example, 
ProductName).
 ✓ 
To clear all filters in the table, click anywhere in the table, click the Sort & 
Filter button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, and then choose Clear from the 
menu.

212  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
Sorting Data in a PivotTable
Sorting a PivotTable involves rearranging row or column field items so that 
the items appear in ascending, descending, or a custom order. You may, for 
example, want to sort a row field of customers or sales regions alphabetically. 
You can sort numerically, alphabetically, or by date, depending on the data 
type.
Remember: Unlike a table, Excel sorts items hidden in a filtered field, so that if 
you remove the filter, the field remains sorted.
The following rules apply when you sort a row or column field:
  ✓ 
If you have more than one row or column field in your PivotTable and you 
sort the outermost row or column field, Excel sorts all the other row or 
column fields in ascending order, regardless of the sort order you choose 
for the outermost field.
 ✓ 
If you sort the innermost row or column field, Excel does not sort the other 
row or column fields.
 ✓ 
If you sort an intermediate row or column field, Excel sorts fields inner to 
that field in ascending order, regardless of the sort order you choose for 
the intermediate field. Excel does not sort fields outer to the intermediate 
field.
In the context of the PivotTable structure, an inner row field is any field to the 
right of another field. An outer field is any field to left of another field. An inner 
column field is any field below another field. An outer field is any field above 
another field.
Sorting a row or column field using standard sort options
Follow these steps to sort a row or column field in your PivotTable using the 
standard sort options:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the field that you want to sort. If you’re 
using the Compact report layout, individual field headings aren’t shown. 
In this case, click the arrow on Row Labels or Column Labels. Excel dis-
plays the sort and filter options.
 2. 
If you’re using the Compact report layout, you must first choose the field 
you want to sort from the Select Field drop-down list from the Row Labels 
or Column Labels sort and filter options.
 3. 
Choose one of the sort direction options at the top of the window. The 
options depend on the data type in the column you’re sorting (numeric, 
text, or date). After you choose an option, Excel rearranges the items in 
the field.

Sorting Data in a PivotTable  213
After you apply a sort to a field, Excel adds a small arrow to the field header 
arrow, indicating the direction of the sort. The arrow also serves as a reminder 
that you’ve applied a sort to the field.
Sorting a value field
In some cases, you may want to sort based on the data in the values area of the 
PivotTable. For instance, you may want to sort sales numbers from largest to 
smallest.
To sort based on data in the values area, right-click any cell in the value column 
you want to sort, choose Sort from the contextual menu, and then select a sort 
direction from the flyout menu. Excel sorts the items in the innermost row field, 
along with their corresponding values.
You can also sort row-wise instead or column-wise. Right-click any cell in the 
value row you want to sort, choose Sort from the contextual menu, and then 
select More Sort options from the flyout menu. In the Sort by Value dialog box, 
select a sort option (Smallest to Largest or Largest to Smallest) and then select 
Left to Right for the sort direction. Click OK, and Excel sorts the items in the 
innermost column field, along with their corresponding values.
Sorting a row or column field manually
When the standard ascending or descending sort order doesn’t apply for a field, 
you can arrange the field items manually. If you have many items you need to 
arrange manually, it’s better to use a custom sort order. See “Sorting a row or 
column field using a custom sort order,” immediately following this section.
To rearrange an item manually, click the item to select it. Position the mouse 
pointer at the edge of the selection until a black arrow cross is displayed at the 
tip of the pointer. Then hold down the left mouse button and drag the item to its 
new location.
Sorting a row or column field using a custom sort order
In some cases, you may want to sort a text field in an order other than alphabetical 
ascending or descending. If your data consists of month names, for example, 
you probably want them to appear in chronological date order rather than 
alphabetically. Excel includes four custom lists, and you can also define your 
own. To sort one or more columns by a custom list, follow these steps:
 1. 
Complete Steps 1–3 in “Sorting a row or column field using standard sort 
options,” except in Step 3, choose More Sort Options instead of one of the 
sort direction options. Excel displays the Sort dialog box. See Figure 13-5, 
left.
 2. 
Click More Options. Excel displays the More Sort Options dialog box. See 
Figure 13-5, right.

214  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
Figure 13-5
 
 3. 
Deselect the Sort Automatically Every Time the Report Is Updated 
check box.
 4. 
In the First Sort Key Order drop-down list, select an option. Click OK twice 
to exit the dialog boxes.
Remember: If you need to use a custom list, create it before following the 
preceding procedure. See “Creating a Custom Sort List,” earlier in this part.
Sorting Data in a Table
Sorting a table involves rearranging the rows so they’re in ascending or 
descending order, based on the values in one or more columns. You may, for 
example, want to sort a table of salespeople alphabetically by last name or by 
sales region. You can sort numerically, alphabetically, or by date, depending on 
the data.
 
 If you sort a filtered table, Excel sorts only the visible rows. After you remove 
the filtering from the table, the table is no longer sorted. Therefore, you should 
remove any column filters before sorting the table.
Remember: You need to re-sort your table after adding (and perhaps editing) 
table rows. To re-sort the table, click any cell in the table, click the Sort & Filter 
button on the Design tab, and then choose Reapply from the menu. See also 
“Filtering Data in a Table,” earlier in this part.
Sorting a single column based on column values
Follow these steps to sort a single column in your table based on the data in the 
table:

Sorting Data in a PivotTable — Sorting Data in a Table  215
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the column you want to sort. Excel 
displays the sort and filter options.
 2. 
Choose one of the sort direction options at the top of the window. The 
options depend on the data type in the column you’re sorting (numeric, 
text, or date). After you choose an option, Excel rearranges the rows in 
the table.
After you apply a sort to a column, Excel adds a small arrow to the column 
header arrow, indicating the direction of the sort. The arrow also serves as a 
reminder that you’ve applied a sort to the column.
Sorting multiple columns based on column values
Follow these steps to sort multiple columns in your table based on the data in 
the table:
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of any column in the table. Excel displays 
the sort and filter options.
 2. 
Choose Sort by Color and then choose Custom Sort from the flyout menu. 
Excel displays the Sort dialog box.
 3. 
From the following drop-down lists, choose the options for the first 
column you want to sort:
 • Column: Choose the first column you want to sort by.
 • Sort On: Choose Values.
 • Order: Choose a sort order.
 4. 
For each additional column you want to sort, click the Add Level button. 
Each time you do so, new drop-down lists appear. Repeat Step 3 for each 
sort level you add (see Figure 13-6).
Figure 13-6
 

216  Part 13: Sorting and Filtering Your Data
 5. 
If you want your sorts to be case-sensitive (applicable to text columns 
only), click the Options button and then select the Case Sensitive check 
box. When you make your sorts case-sensitive, uppercase letters appear 
before lowercase letters in an ascending sort. Normally, sorting ignores 
the case of letters.
 6. 
If you want to change the sort order of a column after you add several sort 
levels, click the left side of the sort level and then click the up or down arrow 
button. If you want to delete a sort level, click the left side of the sort level 
and then click the Delete Level button. After you click a sort level, Excel high-
lights the level so you know which level you’re deleting or reordering.
 7. 
Click OK, and Excel rearranges the table’s rows.
Note that you can sort on up to 64 columns.
Sorting based on a custom sort order
In some cases, you may want to sort a text column in an order other than 
alphabetical ascending or descending. If your data consists of month names, 
for example, you probably want them to appear in month order rather than 
alphabetically. Excel includes four custom lists, and you can also define your 
own. To sort one or more columns by a custom list, follow these steps:
 1. 
Complete Steps 1–3 in “Sorting multiple columns based on column 
values,” except in Step 3, choose Custom List from the Order drop-down 
list. Excel displays the Custom Lists dialog box.
 2. 
In the Custom Lists list box, choose a sort order list.
 3. 
Click OK to add the custom list to the Order drop-down list in the Sort 
dialog box.
 4. 
Click OK. Excel rearranges the table’s rows based on the custom order.
 
 You can also create a custom list in the Custom Lists list box. To create a 
custom list, follow these steps:
 1. 
In the Custom Lists list box, select the NEW LIST entry.
 2. 
In the List Entries text box, type your entries in the order you want your 
list sorted. Press Enter after you type each entry of the list, or separate 
each entry with a comma.
 3. 
Click Add to include your new list in the Custom Lists list box.
 4. 
Click your new list and then click OK to add your list to the Order 
drop-down list in the Sort dialog box.
 5. 
Click OK. Excel rearranges the table’s rows based on your custom order.
See also “Creating a Custom Sort List,” earlier in this part.

Sorting Data in a Table  217
Sorting based on color or conditional formatting icons
You can sort by background or font colors applied to cells manually or by 
conditional formatting. You can also sort by conditional formatting icon sets or 
color scales. Sorting by color is useful if you want to group data that meets a 
conditional formatting criterion.
Follow these steps to sort columns based on color (or icon):
 1. 
Click the arrow on the header of the column that you want to sort by 
color (or icon). Excel displays the sort and filter options.
 2. 
If you want to sort by a single color, choose Sort by Color and choose a 
color (or icon, if applicable) from the flyout menu. After you choose a 
color option, Excel moves the rows with that color to the top of the table.
 
 A quick way to sort by a single color is to right-click a cell in the column with the 
color, choose Sort from the contextual menu, and then choose an appropriate 
color sort option (cell color, cell font, or cell icon).
You can sort by more than one color if, for example, you have multiple colors in 
a column based on conditional formatting conditions or you want to arrange 
color scale colors or icon set icons in a particular order in a column. See also 
“Formatting a Range Using Comparative Visualizations,” in Part 8, for a discussion 
of color scales and icon sets. Follow these steps to sort by more than one color 
in a column:
 1. 
Complete the preceding steps to sort by the first color.
 2. 
Click the arrow on the column header, choose Sort by Color, and then 
choose Custom Sort from the flyout menu. Excel displays the Sort dialog 
box with the first sort level listed (refer to Figure 13-6).
 3. 
Click the left side of the existing sort level and then click the Copy Level 
button. Excel adds a new sort level with identical sort conditions.
 4. 
Click the Order drop-down list and choose a color (or icon if applicable) 
for the new sort level.
 5. 
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to add additional sort levels, except in Step 3, click 
the left side of the last sort level added before clicking Copy Level.
 6. 
Click OK. Excel rearranges the table’s rows in the color order you 
specified.
