Security Reform Act (GISRA) was. Since GISRA was signed into law on
October 30, 2000, U.S. federal agencies have been paying far more attention to
information security than they did previously.
In 2002, FISMA was signed into law, creating more speciﬁc regulations for
U.S. federal agencies than those established by GISRA.Today, with FISMA, and
the process known to support FISMA, Certiﬁcation and Accreditation (C&A),
agencies are far more diligent about assessing their security controls and vulner-
abilities. Despite what you may read in the news, however, many federal agen-
cies are far more secure than their commercial counterparts in the private
sector.
C&A is still a nascent science, and although excellent guidance exists on
how to evaluate the risk exposure of federal information systems, agencies are
still working on improving their C&A programs. C&A is, however, a large
endeavor.Although the process has been proven to reduce risk to federal infor-
mation systems, many people new to C&A don’t know where to start or how
to get going on their C&A projects. Seasoned C&A experts continue to look
for new ideas on how to improve their existing processes.This book is the ﬁrst
publication with numerous practical examples that can help you step through
the C&A process from beginning to end. I wish this book had existed while I
was the Security Staff Director of the FDIC so that I could have provided
copies to my staff.

Foreword

Federal agencies aside, the principles discussed in this book can be applied
to almost any organization that cares about the security of its information tech-
nology systems and infrastructure. Cyber criminals, identity thieves, and terror-
ists have made information security assessments a requisite fundamental part of
doing business today. Laws mandate information security compliance, and fed-
eral and private organizations are allocating budgets to ensure that their conﬁ-
dential information remains private and secure.Although the C&A process was
ﬁrst rolled out by federal agencies, I anticipate that private industry organiza-
tions will adopt C&A principles to assess their own systems going forward.
There is a lot more to securing an infrastructure of systems and applications
than simply performing penetration tests and security scans.This book was
written so that almost anyone can understand it. If you’re interested in learning
how to assess all the different security aspects of your systems, networks, and
applications, this book is for you.With an abundance of pointers to outside ref-
erences, this book includes almost all the resources you need to learn C&A. I
hope you’ll ﬁnd it as easy to follow as I have.

Foreword

As the federal regulators have come to understand the risks to the U.S. national
infrastructure, regulations and laws have been written to ensure that due dili-
gence occurs in securing critical applications and systems.An outcome of the
laws and regulations is a formalized process for reviewing, documenting, ana-
lyzing, and evaluating information security requirements and controls.The pro-
cess described in this book, known as C&A, will assist government agencies in
complying with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002.
Audience
The audience for this book includes those individuals currently performing
information security support at U.S. Federal agencies, defense contractors that
need to comply with FISMA to support government task orders, information
security consultants, and anyone else who would like to learn a very thorough
methodology for conducting information security audits to safeguard sensitive
information, mission-critical applications, and their underlying infrastructure.
While much of the discussion in this book is geared to U.S. federal agen-
cies, this book describes a process that can essentially be applied to any infor-
mation technology organizations or infrastructure.This book does not describe
the only way to perform C&A; however, it does describe a methodology that
has been proven successful in assisting U.S. government agencies in obtaining
near-perfect scores on the annual Federal Computer Security Report Card.All
kinds of variations for performing C&A exist.This book describes one way.

Introduction
Certiﬁcation and Accreditation is a process that ensures that systems and
major applications adhere to formal and established security requirements that
are well documented and authorized. Informally known as C&A,
Certiﬁcation and Accreditation is required by the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.All systems and applications that
reside on U.S. government networks must go through a formal C&A before
being put into production, and every three years thereafter. Since accredita-
tion is the ultimate output of a C&A initiative, and a system or application
cannot be accredited unless it meets speciﬁc security guidelines, clearly the
goal of C&A is to force federal agencies to put into production systems and
applications that are secure.
FISMA, also known as Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law
107-347), mandates that all U.S. federal agencies develop and implement an
agency-wide information security program that explains its security require-
ments, security policies, security controls, and risks to the agency.The require-
ments, policies, controls, and risks are explained formally in a collection of
documents known as a Certiﬁcation Package.The Certiﬁcation Package con-
sists of a review and analysis of applications, systems, or a site—basically what-
ever it is that the agency wants accredited. New applications and systems
require accreditation before they can be put into production, and existing
applications and systems require accreditation every three years.
Each agency shall develop, document, and implement an
agency-wide information security program to provide infor-
mation security for the information and information systems
that support the operations and assets of the agency,
including those provided or managed by another agency,
contractor, or other source…
—Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002
Laws for U.S. federal departments and agencies mandate C&A; however,
private organizations can also take advantage of C&A methodologies to help
mitigate risks on their own information systems and networks. In fact, about
90 percent of the nation’s critical infrastructure is on private networks that are
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation?

not part of any U.S. federal department or agency.The nation’s critical infras-
tructure includes those information technology systems that run electrical sys-
tems, chemical systems, nuclear systems, transportation systems,
telecommunication systems, banking and ﬁnancial systems, and agricultural
and food and water supply systems to name only a few.
The entire C&A process is really nothing more than a standardized secu-
rity audit, albeit a very complete standardized security audit. Having worked
in both private industry and on government networks, my experience indi-
cates that contrary to what you read in the news, most private and public
companies do not put nearly as much time, effort, and resources into docu-
menting their security as government agencies do.All the C&A methodolo-
gies described in this book can be adopted and used by private industry.
Though federal departments and agencies seem to get repeated criticisms
belittling their security initiatives, it’s my experience and belief that the criti-
cisms are largely exaggerated and that their security conscientiousness far
exceeds that of private industry.
The C&A model is a methodology for demonstrating due-diligence in
mitigating risks and maintaining appropriate security controls.Any enterprise
organization can adopt best practice C&A methodologies.A special license is
not required, and no special tools are required to make use of the model—it
is simply a way of doing things related to security.
Terminology
Certiﬁcation refers to the preparation and review of an application’s, or
system’s, security controls and capabilities for the purpose of establishing
whether the design or implementation meets appropriate security require-
ments.Accreditation refers to the positive evaluation made on the Certiﬁcation
and Accreditation Package by the evaluation team.
Different documents written by different federal agencies have their own
deﬁnitions of certiﬁcation and accreditation, and though the deﬁnitions are
similar, they are each slightly different. NIST Special Publication 800-371
deﬁnes certiﬁcation as:
www.syngress.com
What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation? • Chapter 1
3

A comprehensive assessment of the management, opera-
tional, and technical security controls in an information
system, made in support of security accreditation, to deter-
mine the extent to which the controls are implemented cor-
rectly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the system. 
The guidance written by NIST is intended for information systems that
process unclassiﬁed data, more commonly known as SBU data—Sensitive But
Unclassiﬁed.The Committee on National Security Systems, Chaired by the
Department of Defense, deﬁnes certiﬁcation in the National Information
Assurance Glossary,2 Revision June 2006 as:
A comprehensive evaluation of the technical and nontech-
nical security safeguards of an IS to support the accreditation
process that establishes the extent to which a particular
design and implementation meets a set of speciﬁed security
requirements. 
You can see that even experts among us don’t necessarily agree on a con-
crete deﬁnition. However, since experts in most professions typically bring
their own uniqueness to the table, I don’t see the differences in deﬁnitions as
being a show stopper for getting the job done.The deﬁnitions are similar
enough.
An evaluation team reviews a suite of documents known as a Certiﬁcation
Package and makes recommendations on whether it should be accredited.The
evaluation team may be referred to by different names in different agencies.
You should think of the evaluators as specialized information security audi-
tors; often they are referred to as certifying agents. Each agency may refer to
their own auditors with slightly different names, so you shouldn’t get hung up
on what to call these folks.The main thing to know is that each agency has
their own set of auditors that have the power either to pass or fail the dif-
ferent elements of a Certiﬁcation Package, and provide a recommendation
either to accredit the package or not.
The term “Certiﬁcation” can be confusing because a Certiﬁcation
Package does not mean that any part of the infrastructure described in the
www.syngress.com
4
Chapter 1 • What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation?

package has been certiﬁed by anyone for anything.The Certiﬁcation Package
itself is not, and does not, get certiﬁed. However, it does get reviewed by cer-
tifying agents.A more apropos name might have been a Security Package but
that isn’t the name our friendly federal regulators wanted to use so we won’t
be using it here.
Once a Certiﬁcation Package has been evaluated, a positive accreditation
indicates that a senior agency ofﬁcial has formally made the decision that the
documented risks to the agency, assets, and individuals are acceptable. Senior
agency ofﬁcials employ large teams of information assurance oversight staff
that go over the Certiﬁcation Packages with ﬁne-toothed combs.
Accreditation does not come lightly, and occurs only after each Certiﬁcation
Package has undergone a scrupulous review. By accrediting an information
system, the senior agency ofﬁcial agrees to take responsibility for the accuracy
of the information in the certiﬁcation package and consents to be held
accountable for any security incidents that may arise related to the system.
NIST Special Publication 800-37 refers to accreditation as:
The ofﬁcial management decision given by a senior agency
ofﬁcial to authorize operation of an information system and
to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations (including
mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or
individuals, based on the implementation of an agreed-upon
set of security controls. 
And the National Information Assurance Glossary refers to accreditation
as a:
Formal declaration by a Designated Accrediting Authority
(DAA) that an IS is approved to operation at an acceptable
level of risk, based on the implementation of an approved set
of technical, managerial, and procedural safeguards. 
Much of the terminology that federal agencies use in developing C&A
programs and processes comes from the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A-130,Appendix III  (listed in Appendix B).To view this
document, go to www.syngress.com.The OMB is part of the Executive
Ofﬁce of the President of the United States.Aside from assisting the president
with the budget, the OMB’s mission is also to create and oversee information
www.syngress.com
What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation? • Chapter 1
5

and regulatory policies.The OMB was created in 1970, and essentially
replaced the Bureau of Budget.The fact that the OMB plays a signiﬁcant reg-
ulatory role in C&A shows just how important information security has
become to our national infrastructure. It also means that C&A initiatives will
have a budget and are clearly a priority to the Executive Ofﬁce of the
President of the United States—and that’s a good thing.
Audit and Report Cards
Some agencies have two sets of auditors and a Certiﬁcation Package may
under go review by one evaluation team ﬁrst, and another evaluation team
second.The ﬁrst group of evaluators ensures that the Certiﬁcation and
Accreditation package was prepared correctly, according to agency guidelines.
The second set ensures that the ﬁrst set evaluated the C&A package correctly,
according to agency guidelines. Sometimes the two sets of evaluators do not
always agree on whether or not certain parts of the Certiﬁcation Package are
acceptable. If this happens the evaluators need to discuss the discordance
among each other until they reach agreement.
Once a package has been accredited, auditors from outside the agency,
from the Government Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO), come on site and review
the Certiﬁcation Packages and write up reports on how well the agency’s
C&A program is working.The GAO auditors are known as Inspector
Generals (IGs). If the IGs ﬁnd deﬁciencies in any accredited packages, the
agency will receive unsatisfactory ratings by the GAO. (I will discuss more of
how these packages are audited and reviewed in Chapter 21.) A goal for any
agency is to make sure that all Certiﬁcation Packages were properly evaluated
and accredited so that the GAO does not ﬁnd any deﬁciencies.
After the GAO documents its ﬁndings, these ﬁndings get reviewed by the
U.S. Government House of Representatives Government Reform
Subcommittee on Technology and Information Policy. When former Rep.
Stephen Horn (R-CA) chaired the House Subcommittee on Government
Management, Information and Technology, Intergovernmental Relations and the
Census, he came up with the idea of issuing federal computer security report
cards and the ﬁrst report card was issued in 2000. Originally these report
cards were dubbed the Horn Report, however, today the report cards are
www.syngress.com
6
Chapter 1 • What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation?

known as the annual Federal Computer Security Report Cards.Although Stephen
Horn no longer chairs the subcommittee, these report cards are still often
referred to as the Horn Reports, and they are based entirely on how well an
agency performs C&A.
The subcommittee is now known as the Subcommittee on Government
Management, Finance and Accountability and is part of the Committee on
Government Reform.As of this writing, the URL of its Web site is
http://reform.house.gov/GMFA/.
The most current Federal Computer Security Report Cards as of this writing
can be found at http://reform.house.gov/UploadedFiles/2004%
20Computer%20Security%20Report%20card%202%20years.pdf.
A Standardized Process
C&A is standardized process. Each agency decides what their standardized
security C&A process consists of, and documents it.The different U.S. federal
departments and agencies develop their own unique standardized process
based on guidance it has used from one of the following three organizations:
the National Institute of Standards (NIST), the Committee on National
Security Systems (CNSS), or the Department of Defense (DoD).
For agencies that are doing their C&A the right way, their own internal
guidance that describes their repeatable process likely consists of as much
material as you will ﬁnd in this book. C&A is a voluminous process, and the
documentation that exists to describe any one agency’s C&A process can be
daunting.The documentation that goes into writing and putting together a
Certiﬁcation Package is also daunting.The amount of security documentation
that you will ﬁnd in one Certiﬁcation Package is easily more extensive than
all the tips, suggestions, and guidance that you’ll ﬁnd in this book.
Typically, a well-documented C&A process consists of not just one docu-
ment, but a set of documents. Of primary importance in this set of docu-
ments is the C&A handbook that describes the agency’s overall C&A process.
The title of the handbook varies from agency to agency, but will most likely
sport a name akin to The <Name> Agency Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process
and Handbook. Without a handbook to standardize the process, there would be
a lack of cohesiveness in the different Certiﬁcation Packages published by the
agency.
www.syngress.com
What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation? • Chapter 1

When putting together a Certiﬁcation Package for a particular agency,
you will continually need to go back to the handbook and reference it.The
handbook will have way too much information in it for you to read and
absorb and remember in one fell swoop. However, if you are about to under-
take a C&A initiative, you should try to read the handbook from front to
back at least once, knowing that you won’t remember everything, but you
may remember better where to look to ﬁnd the information you’ll need
when the time comes.
Templates, Documents, and Paperwork
C&A is essentially a documentation and paperwork nightmare. If you’re just
embarking on C&A for the ﬁrst time, be prepared for that.To create some
order out of the paper work nightmare, aside from a handbook, most agencies
now have templates that they use for all the different types of documents that
go into the Certiﬁcation Package.Agencies that don’t have templates should
certainly strive to develop some.
Templates ensure that all the different types of documents that go into the
agency-wide Certiﬁcation Packages have the same look and feel, and they
standardize the documentation.A good template helps to ensure that all key
information is included in the Certiﬁcation Package. Well-written templates
also assist the auditors in ﬁnding the information that they are looking for
because they will know exactly in which section of the package to ﬁnd the
information they are looking for.The amount of information that is required
in any one Certiﬁcation Package is so great, that if each Certiﬁcation Package
had a different format, it would be nearly impossible for the auditors to eval-
uate the package. When the auditors evaluate a Certiﬁcation Package, they
want to know where to look to ﬁnd key information and they don’t want to
have to hunt for it. I have seen Certiﬁcation Packages receive failures not
because the right information wasn’t in the Certiﬁcation Package, but because
the right information was not where it was supposed to be.
Preparing a Certiﬁcation Package is very documentation intensive. If you
have just gotten yourself into the C&A business for the ﬁrst time, and are
about to start helping an agency prepare a Certiﬁcation Package, prepare
yourself to write, write, and write some more. If you detest writing, you’re in
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • What Is Certiﬁcation and Accreditation?

the wrong business. Basically, preparing a Certiﬁcation Package is writing
about security—extensive writing about security. When you are preparing a
Certiﬁcation Package, you usually don’t actually perform any sort of hands-on
security.You review the existing security design and architecture documents,
interview various IT support and development folks familiar with the infras-
tructure, and document your ﬁndings. Because a lot of time is taken up in
reviewing existing security and architecture documents, often the people who
prepare Certiﬁcation Packages are known as the C&A preparation team.
Certiﬁcation and 
Accreditation Laws Summarized
Though FISMA is the overriding law that necessitates the need for C&A,
there are other laws, regulations, and national policies that provide secondary
authority.The secondary laws, regulations, and policies that C&A must also
accommodate are listed here:

Summary
Toward the future, I anticipate that C&A will become even more important
than it is today.The current trend is that as security incidents continue to
wreak havoc on information systems, new laws and policies are being pro-
posed and passed every day to create more stringent security controls.
Breaches in security on both government information systems and those
maintained by the private sector create millions of dollars in losses and also
threaten the national security of our country, and everyone in it.According to
their annual 2004 survey on cyber crime, the Computer Security Institute
found that in 2004, viruses caused $55million worth of damage among 269
survey respondents.3
Current trends show that unauthorized intrusions are declining—probably
a result of organizations showing greater due diligence when it comes to
system and network security either on their own volition, or as a result of
new laws and regulations. However, to be sure, threats are becoming more
sophisticated and terrorists continue to use high-technology to threaten not
just data and our infrastructure, but worse yet, human lives.
C&A is creating a new market for security services.As agencies try to buff
up their internal C&A processes, interest in understanding how to automate
these processes and track them online will start to increase.Tools that can
decrease the amount of time that it takes to put together the required docu-
ments such as a System Risk Assessment will become more and more impor-
tant. However, today, automated C&A tools are still remedial at best and take
an enormous amount of time to set up and conﬁgure.

Introduction
There are four primary C&A models that agencies use as a basis to architect
their standardized C&A process.The four C&A models are the National
Information Assurance Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process (NIACAP)
model, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) model, the
Defense Information Technology Systems Certiﬁcation and Accreditation
Process (DITSCAP) model, and the DCID 6/3 model.
The NIACAP model is based on a process published by the Committee
on National Security Systems that documents its methodology in the National
Security Telecommunications and Information System Security Instructions,1 otherwise
known as NSTISSI No. 1000.The NIST model is described in a publication
known as NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security Certiﬁcation
and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.2 In the past, many civilian fed-
eral agencies have used either the NIACAP or NIST’s previous models; how-
ever in recent years, the trend has been to abandon the NIACAP model and
adopt the NIST model.The NIST speciﬁcations are more up to date, and
include a vast amount of supporting documents that complement the founda-
tional guidelines.The DITSCAP3 model is used primarily by defense agen-
cies, though civilian agencies have the option of adopting any DITSCAP
principles that they feel may complement their own unique C&A program.
The DCID 6/3 model is used only by intelligence agencies.Although almost
all federal agencies base their C&A program on one of these models, each
agency’s C&A program is at the same time unique to that particular agency.
No two C&A programs are exactly alike.
If a private or public business wanted to adopt one of the C&A models to
create their own unique security auditing program, the model that would
likely be easiest and best to adopt would be the NIST model.The National
Institute of Standards is constantly revising their guidelines and coming out
with new and updated guidelines all the time.They also make all their draft
guidelines available to review by any industry professionals, including those
individuals from nonfederal enterprise organizations.

The NIACAP Process
As you recall, the NIACAP C&A model was developed by the CNSS, and its
intent is to be used as guidance for the C&A of national security systems.
National Security Systems are systems that contain National Security
Information (NSI). Classiﬁed NSI includes information determined to be
either “Top Secret,”“Secret,” or “Conﬁdential” under Executive order 12958,4
which was released by the White House ofﬁce of the Press Secretary in April
1995. However, NSI may also include Sensitive But Unclassiﬁed (SBU) infor-
mation.The NIACAP C&A model was developed for auditing National secu-
rity systems. National security systems are those systems related to intelligence
activities, equipment that is an integral part of a weapon system, command
and control of military forces, cryptologic activities related to national secu-
rity, or equipment that is critical to the direct fulﬁllment of military of intelli-
gence missions. NIST clariﬁed the deﬁnition of National Security Systems in
August 2003 when it released, NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an
Information System as a National Security System.
Recall that the NIACAP process is described in NSTISSI No. 1000.
NSTISSI No. 1000 describes tasks, activities, and a recommended manage-
ment structure to use for your C&A process.The similarities between
NIACAP and NIST arise in part because NSTISSI No. 1000 recommends
that C&A activities take the NIST guidance into consideration stating,
While developed for national security systems, the NIACAP
may, at an agency’s discretion, be adapted to any type of IS
and any computing environment and mission subject to the
policies found in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and the
standards and guidance issued by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST).
The NIACAP is endorsed by the U.S. National Security Agency and was
last updated in April of 2000.Though originally intended for national security
systems, any federal agency (or private enterprise) can adopt and use the
NIACAP process as long as their oversight authority allows it. However, as of
this writing, systems that are classiﬁed as national security systems are still
required to follow the NIACAP methodology.

The NIST Process
The NIST process was designed for unclassiﬁed information, more commonly
known as Sensitive But Unclassiﬁed (SBU) information.The framework for
the NIST C&A methodology is described in a publication known as NIST
Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security Certiﬁcation and Accreditation of
Federal Information Systems.A copy of it is available online at http://csrc.nist.
gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37/SP800-37-ﬁnal.pdf.
NIACAP and NIST 
Phases, Differences, and Similarities
Both NIST and NIACAP establish a framework to provide accountability for
those people tasked with responsibility of the system. Both processes stipulate
deﬁnitions and requirements for system characterization, risk assessment, veri-
ﬁcation and validation of security controls, and testing. Certiﬁcation recom-
mendations and accrediting decisions are also called for by both processes.
Some civilian federal agencies use the NIACAP process, however the cur-
rent trend is for agencies to move away from the NIACAP process and
instead use the NIST process. However, to be sure, the NIACAP and NIST
models are very similar and if their own internal oversight authority allows it,
an agency can use a combination-hybrid of the NIACAP and NIST models.
Both the NIACAP and NIST models describe the C&A process being
done in four phases.The four phases of the NIACAP are:
1. Deﬁnition
2. Veriﬁcation
3. Validation
4. Post Accreditation
The four phases of the NIST model are:
1. Initiation
2. Certiﬁcation
3. Accreditation
4. Continuous Monitoring

Chapter 2 • Types of Certiﬁcation and Accreditation

Agencies who are working on reﬁning their C&A process by updating
and revising their process guidelines should not get hung up on the names
used for the phases. Whether you call the ﬁrst phase Deﬁnition, Initiation, or
something of your own making is not going to affect how well the process
works, and whether or not you receive an A or a B on the annual Federal
Computer Security Report Card.The important thing is to make sure that
whatever terminology is being used is well deﬁned, understood by all, and is
consistent throughout all the other agency C&A documents. Keep in mind
that the goal of creating a C&A process is to create a well-deﬁned repeatable
process.
NIACAP and NIST Compared
The NIACAP methodology is six years old and CNSS is currently in the
process of being updated. NIACAP guidelines are described in a document
known as NSTISSI No. 1000, which is available at www.cnss.gov/
Assets/pdf/nstissi_1000.pdf.
The NIST methodology was last released in May of 2004. Prior to
updating their guidelines, NIST goes to a lot of trouble to solicit review and
comments from both public and private industry, which greatly enhances the
quality of their publications.
The NIST guidance is well written and easy to follow. However, it is only
a 69-page document, and is just a framework—following it won’t solve all
your C&A problems because it leaves a lot of gray areas open to interpreta-
tion.Agencies and bureaus that embrace the NIST model use NIST Special
Publication 800-37 as a guide to write their own internal C&A process and
handbook customized for their own unique requirements.
In essence, NIST Special Publication 800-37 is a call to action and gives
agencies a “to do” list for actions, plans, policies, procedures, training, and
methodologies that need to be put into place. Putting into place the items
that the NIST C&A process proposes that agencies include (without putting
together any Certiﬁcation Packages) is a huge undertaking in itself.
Some of the C&A guidance for NIACAP, DITSCAP, and DCID is pub-
licly available. However, because these methodologies are related to national
security systems, defense systems, and intelligence systems, it is possible that
they could be made unavailable to the general public at any time.The NIST
www.syngress.com
Types of Certiﬁcation and Accreditation • Chapter 2
17

model is very current, and NIST solicits and receives feedback from a much
larger community of experts. Of all four C&A methodologies, the NIST
model is more “open source” than the others—if you can call a methodology
open source.
DITSCAP
DITSCAP was developed for evaluating and accrediting Department of
Defense systems and also includes four phases. DITSCAP was developed and
is published by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and it
applies to the acquisition, operation, and on-going support of any Department
of Defense system that collects, stores, transmits, or processes unclassiﬁed or
classiﬁed information. It is mandatory for use by all defense agencies.
The DITSCAP guidance is described in a document known as DoDI
5200.40 and is available at www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/i520040_
123097/i520040p.pdf.
The four DITSCAP phases are the same as the NIACAP phases and are
known as:
1. Deﬁnition
2. Veriﬁcation
3. Validation
4. Post Accreditation
The major areas of analysis for the DITSCAP methodology, as described
in Phase II, are:
■
System Architecture Analysis
■
Software Design Analysis 
■
Network Connection Rule Compliance
■
Integrity Analysis of Integrated Products
■
Life Cycle Management Analysis
■
Security Requirements Validation Procedures
■
Vulnerability Evaluation

Chapter 2 • Types of Certiﬁcation and Accreditation

DISTCAP uses an infrastructure-centric approach and stresses that DoD
systems are network-centric and interconnected.There are numerous DoD
policies, referred to as directives that the DITSCAP must also adhere to.All
the directives are named with numbers and begin with the numbers 5200.
One of the most important DoD directives with which DITSCAP must be in
compliance is DoDD 5200.28.The subject of 5200.28 is Security Requirements
for Automated Information Systems (AIS). 5200.28 is available at
http://csrc.nist.gov/fasp/FASPDocs/authorize-process/d520028p.pdf.
5200.28 is a 32-page document that names numerous other directives that
must be complied with while adhering to the DITSCAP process. Relatively
speaking, 5200.18 is an old document released in 1988. However, it is still in
effect today, and there are many concepts related to information security that
have not changed over time, which is why this policy is still relevant.
DCID 6/3
DCID 6/3 is the certiﬁcation and accreditation process used by federal agen-
cies working on intelligence projects (e.g., the CIA). Speciﬁcally, information
technology projects that require that anyone working on them has a Top
Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI) clearance use the
DCID 6/3 process. DCID stands for Director of Central Intelligence
Directive and 6/3 refers to the process described in section 6, part 3 of the
compendious Director of Central Intelligence Directives.5 The certiﬁcation
and accreditation process that the Intelligence Community (IC) used before
DCID 6/3 came along was called DCID 1/16.
The DCID 6/3 model is based on certiﬁcation and accreditation per-
formed on information systems that are characterized by Protection Levels
(PL), and DCID 6/3 deﬁnes ﬁve different protection levels. DCID 6/3 deals
only with classiﬁed information and its PL model helps ensure that only
properly cleared people have access to classiﬁed information.
Although the DCID 6/3 model was designed for classiﬁed information
and intelligence work, it is publicly available for review, and any agency or
private organization can adopt the methodology, and customize it according
to their own unique requirements.The DCID Standards Manual, which
deﬁnes the DCID 6/3 certiﬁcation and accreditation process, can be found
www.syngress.com
Types of Certiﬁcation and Accreditation • Chapter 2
19

on the Federation of American Scientists6 Web site at www.fas.org/irp/
offdocs/dcid-6-3-manual.pdf.
The DCID 6/3 C&A process must also comply with the DCID 6/3
policy manual.The DCID 6/3 policy manual can be found on the Web at
www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/DCID_6-3_20Policy.htm.
Many of the requirements for IC certiﬁcation and accreditation are based
on physical security, since classiﬁed information must always be physically
secured.Aside from physical security, the IC puts a lot of emphasis on encryp-
tion.The emphasis in these two areas is what really sets apart DCID certiﬁca-
tion and accreditation from the other C&A methodologies.
The Common Denominator 
of All C&A Methodologies
The common denominator of all the C&A methodologies, and this book, is
that they are all based on three attributes: Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability of information and information systems.All the C&A methodolo-
gies include deﬁnitions for categorizing Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability qualitatively. In all four of the C&A methodologies, information
technology assets and controls must be categorized qualitatively by sensitivity
related to Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
Conﬁdentiality of information is insurance that it will not be disclosed to
unauthorized persons or systems. Integrity of information is insurance that
the information will not be altered from its original and intended form.
Availability ensures that the information will be available as planned.Though
Availability might seem so obvious at ﬁrst that it is not worth mentioning, the
reason it is important is because it forces the information owner to make pro-
visions for contingencies and outages. Because Availability is important, the
C&A requires that contingency planning is developed and tested.
All the C&A models call for accountability. Security accountability of IT
systems means that activities can be traced back to a person or a process and
that the people who are responsible will be held accountable for their actions.
One of the reasons that roles and responsibilities are clearly deﬁned in every
Certiﬁcation Package is to make it clear who is responsible for what.The
www.syngress.com
20
Chapter 2 • Types of Certiﬁcation and Accreditation

DITSCAP model in particular emphasizes accountability perhaps more so
than the other C&A models.
All four of the C&A models described thus far are really very similar in
numerous ways. If you read all the guidance documentation for each, you
might come to the conclusion that the four methodologies are essentially the
same thing written four different ways. In order to take you through the
C&A process, it makes no sense for me to walk you through it in four dif-
ferent ways.The goal of this book is to present a methodology of simply one
way to perform C&A.This is not to say that there aren’t other ways to do
C&A.
The C&A recommendations in this book are a hybrid of the four dif-
ferent C&A models.The guidance I will refer to most often will be from
NIST since it is more up to date than the guidance for the other methodolo-
gies. Where the NIST guidance leaves gaps and is vague, I have used ideas
from the NIACAP, DITSCAP, and DCID. I have made some small deviations
from the different methodologies where I feel that certain aspects of one of
the four were not made clear, or required expansion. NIST guidance is also
publicly available for anyone to review, and in that sense it is the most open
source of the four methodologies. Certainly, it is not my intent to republish
any of the known four methodologies.
Something to remember is that every agency, bureau, and department in
the government that has built a robust and thorough C&A process has their
own unique requirements built into it. No two are alike, but the good ones
that enable top scores on the Federal Computer Security Report Cards are all
similar and will all lead to successful accreditations.
C&A for Private Enterprises
Even though C&A methodologies are well entrenched in U.S. federal agen-
cies, there is nothing that says that these methodologies and practices cannot
be adopted and used by private businesses, publicly traded corporations, and
nonproﬁt organizations. In order to obtain new contracts under government
task orders, many private defense contractors must now sign agreements that
stipulate that they are in compliance with FISMA.

At the time of this writing, there is a group of industry experts that are
working on transforming much of NIST’s guidance used for information
security management, including certiﬁcation and accreditation, to documenta-
tion that ﬁts better for private industry. NIST publishes excellent guidance on
information security management, though it is directed at federal agencies.
Although the C&A methodologies they describe can be adopted by anyone,
private industry will more readily familiarize themselves with their guidance
once the term “federal agency” has been replaced by “enterprises.”
Any organization that processes sensitive information should have a
methodology for evaluating and accrediting the security of their systems.To
protect individuals from having their medical information exposed, Congress
enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in
1996. Sarbanes-Oxley became law in January of 2002 to regulate accounting
practices and standards of publicly traded companies.Although accounting
may seem like just a ﬁnancial matter, keep in mind that Integrity of informa-
tion can be ensured only by strict security controls.Therefore, Sarbanes-Oxley
has become an information technology problem.
Sarbanes-Oxley and the HIPAA were passed to hold certain covered enti-
ties accountable for the security of their systems, but what these regulations
lack are standardized methodologies.A law is one thing, and a standardized
process or methodology for complying with the law is quite another. FISMA,
HIPAA, and Sarbanes-Oxley are merely laws. What has evolved out of
FISMA, which has not yet evolved out of HIPAA and Sarbanes-Oxley, is that
standardized certiﬁcation and accreditation processes now exist that enable
FISMA compliance. HIPAA and Sarbanes-Oxley both need standardized cer-
tiﬁcation and accreditation processes.The way that HIPAA and Sarbanes-
Oxley are complied with today depends on who you ask—all organizations
are attempting to comply with HIPAA and Sarbanes-Oxley differently,
according to whatever way they know how. While attempting to comply with
these laws is meritorious, trying to apply oversight to the compliance process
will be difﬁcult until standardized C&A processes that are unique to each law
evolve.

Chapter 2 • Types of Certiﬁcation and Accreditation

Summary
Certiﬁcation and Accreditation processes formally evaluate the security of an
information system, determine the risk of operating the information system,
and then either accept or not accept that risk.There are generally four dif-
ferent methodologies for performing C&A: NIACAP, NIST, DITSCAP, and
DCID 6/3.These different methodologies were developed for four different
audiences within the federal community: national security systems, nonna-
tional security information systems, defense agency information systems, and
information systems operated by the intelligence community. Despite the dif-
ferent nuances in these methodologies, they all have the goal of accomplishing
the same task of certifying and accrediting information systems, and as such,
there are many similarities between them.Although none of these models was
developed for the private sector, laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and
others hold certain private sector enterprises responsible for maintaining basic
levels of information security.Therefore, drawing from these four models to
develop private sector C&A processes can help businesses achieve compliance
with these laws.

Introduction
The Certiﬁcation and Accreditation (C&A) process begins when an informa-
tion system owner recognizes that either an application, system, group of sys-
tems, or site requires Accreditation.The information systems owner might be
an IT operations director, an IT operations manager, a security ofﬁcer, or an
application development manager. When the need for C&A is recognized, it
is time to put in motion a plan to carry out and oversee the C&A process.
Recognizing the Need for C&A
All general support systems and major applications are required by FISMA
and the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,Appendix
III (see Appendix B) to be fully certiﬁed and accredited before they are put
into production. Production systems and major applications are required to be
reaccredited every three years. Going forward we will refer to systems that
require C&A (e.g., general support systems and major applications) simply as
information systems.
One of the primary objectives of C&A is to force the authorizing ofﬁcial
to understand the risks an information system poses to agency operations.
Only after understanding the risks can an authorizing ofﬁcial ensure that the
information system has received adequate attention to mitigate unacceptable
risks. Evaluating risk and documenting the results is something that should be
incorporated throughout a system or application’s system development life-
cycle. NIST has deﬁned the system development lifecycle to consist of ﬁve
phases:
1. System initiation
2. Development and acquisition
3. Implementation
4. Operation and maintenance
5. Disposal
FISMA mandates that new systems and applications need to be fully certi-
ﬁed and accredited before they can be put into production.The best time to

Chapter 3 • Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process

begin the C&A of new systems and applications is while they are still in
development. It is easiest to design security into a system that has not yet
been built. When new information systems are being proposed and designed,
part of the development should include discussions on “What do we need to
do to ensure that this information system can be certiﬁed and accredited?”
After a new application is built and ready to be implemented is not the time
to ﬁgure out if it will withstand a comprehensive certiﬁcation review.
Legacy systems that are already in their operational phase are harder to
certify and accredit because it is altogether possible that they were put into
production with little to no security taken into consideration. In putting
together the Certification Package for a legacy system, it may be discovered
that adequate security controls have not been put into place. If it becomes
clear that adequate security controls have not been put into place, the C&A
project leader may decide to temporarily put on hold the development of
the Certification Package while adequate security controls are developed
and implemented. It makes little sense to spend the resources to develop a
Certification Package that recommends that an information system not be
accredited. However, coming to an understanding that an information
system has not been properly prepared for accreditation is precisely one
reason why C&A exists—it is a process that enables authorizing officials to
discover the security truths about their infrastructure so that informed deci-
sions can be made.
Roles and Responsibilities
C&A involves a lot of different people all working together on different tasks.
There are the folks who develop the C&A program, the folks who prepare
Certiﬁcation Packages, the folks who are held accountable for the
Certiﬁcation Packages, the agency auditors who evaluate the Certiﬁcation
Packages prior to accreditation, and the federal inspectors who audit the
agency to make sure that they are doing C&A the right way.
Chief Information Ofﬁcer
The agency Chief Information Ofﬁcer (CIO) is the most obvious person
held accountable for a successful information security program and C&A 
www.syngress.com
Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process • Chapter 3
27

program. It is the CIO’s responsibility to make sure that an information secu-
rity program, including a C&A program, exists and is implemented. However,
most agency CIOs don’t play a hands-on role in developing these programs.
Usually the CIO will designate the development of these programs to the
Senior Agency Information Security Ofﬁcer. However, delegating the pro-
gram development does not mean that the CIO does not need to understand
the process. If the CIO does not understand all the elements of a successful
C&A program there is little chance that the CIO will be able to hold the
Senior Agency Information Security Ofﬁcer responsible for developing a
complete program. Without understanding the particulars of what a program
should include, the CIO will not know if the Senior Agency Information
Security Ofﬁcer has left anything out.
A piece of C&A that cannot be overlooked is the need for the CIO to
develop a budget for C&A. C&A is very time intensive, and a typical C&A
takes on average six months to do a thorough job, replete with all the
required information.The CIO works together with the authorizing ofﬁcial
to ensure that there is enough of a budget to staff the resources necessary to
put together the certiﬁcation program. If CIOs do not budget for C&A, C&A
may not get done.The CIO enables C&A to take place by fully under-
standing the federal budgetary process as documented in a publication put out
by the White House known as Circular No.A-11 Part 7 Planning, Budgeting,
Acquisition, and Management of Capital Assets.This publication is currently avail-
able at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a11/2002/part7.pdf.
A-11 Part 7 references other budgetary guidelines that the CIO should
also become familiar with, including one known as OMB Exhibit 300. OMB
Exhibit 300 is currently available at www.cio.gov/archive/S300_05_
draft_0430.pdf.
It is ultimately the CIO that is likely to be held responsible and account-
able if the agency receives a poor grade on the annual Federal Computer
Security Report Card. One of the responsibilities of the CIO is to care about
the annual Federal Computer Security Report Card grade. If an agency
receives a failing grade, then clearly there is something wrong with either the
C&A program itself, or how the program is implemented. If an agency
receives a top score on the annual Federal Computer Security Report Card,
then as far as C&A goes, the process is being worked the right way.As the
www.syngress.com
28
Chapter 3 • Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process

Federal Computer Security Report Cards get more and more public atten-
tion each year, a poor score on the report card can be a career-limiting expe-
rience for any agency CIO.
I will discuss the Federal Computer Security Report Cards more in
Chapter 23.
Authorizing Ofﬁcial
The authorizing ofﬁcial is a generic term for a senior management ofﬁcial
within an agency who authorizes operations of an information system,
declaring that the risks associated with it are acceptable. It is unlikely that any
person would hold the title of “authorizing ofﬁcial,” hence I am not punctu-
ating it here with capital letters.There may be multiple authorizing ofﬁcials
within each agency, all responsible for their own designated areas. In many
agencies, the authorizing ofﬁcial is referred to as the Designated Accrediting
Authority (DAA).
The authorizing ofﬁcial usually has budgetary responsibilities for ensuring
that a certain amount of resources are set aside for overseeing the C&A pro-
cess. Usually the agency CIO reports to the authorizing ofﬁcial. However, in
large agencies, where some bureau CIOs report to the agency CIO, it can be
the case that a CIO is the authorizing ofﬁcial. In other cases the authorizing
ofﬁcial may be the Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner. If the autho-
rizing ofﬁcial and CIO are two different people, they must work together to
make sure that an adequate budget has been set aside for C&A.
The authorizing ofﬁcial should, according to the National Institute of
Standards, Special Publication 800-37 (May 2004), be an employee of the U.S.
government and cannot be a contractor or consultant. However, the autho-
rizing ofﬁcial may designate a representative to carry out the various tasks
related to C&A, and the designated representative can be a contractor or con-
sultant. However, the ﬁnal security accreditation decision and its accompa-
nying accreditation decision letter must be owned and signed by the U.S.
government employee that is the authorizing ofﬁcial.

The Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) is the person that
that CIO holds accountable to oversee all of the agency’s information secu-
rity initiatives.The SAISO is akin to a Chief Information Security Officer
in private industry. It’s possible that CIOs may perform this role themselves,
in which case there wouldn’t be a separate individual holding these 
responsibilities.
The SAISO works with the agency authorizing ofﬁcials to ensure that
they are in agreement on the security requirements of the information system
as well as the key documents contained in the Certiﬁcation Package such as
the risk assessments and the Security Plan. In working together, the SAISO
and the authorizing ofﬁcials should be sure to take into consideration the
mission and business requirements of the agency.
The SAISO provides management oversight to the Certiﬁcation Agent
and works with him or her to ensure that the C&A process is well thought
out, and includes all the necessary documentation and guidance.The SAISO
appoints the Certiﬁcation Agent and holds them accountable for performing
their duties. It is very important for the SAISO to choose their Certiﬁcation
Agent(s) carefully because they will need to rely on their accreditation rec-
ommendations.
The SAISO may wish to review all the Certiﬁcation Packages that are
processed within the agency; however, as a practical matter, it is next to
impossible to do this. In most agencies, there are far too many Certiﬁcation
Packages for one individual to review and validate. Due to this very reason,
the SAISO employs a Certiﬁcation Agent (or agents) to read packages, per-
form evaluations, write recommendations, and produce a document called a
Security Assessment Report.The Security Assessment Report is basically an evalua-
tion summary and should justify and support the recommendation on
whether or not to accredit the package.The Security Assessment Report should
have all the information that the SAISO needs to justify signing the accredita-
tion letter, and escalate the recommendation upward to the authorizing ofﬁ-
cial as to whether or not they should sign the accreditation letter.

Senior Agency Privacy Ofﬁcial
Each agency is supposed to have a Senior Agency Privacy Ofﬁcial. For a large
agency, a Senior Agency Privacy Ofﬁcial might be a full time job. However,
for a small agency, it’s possible that the responsibilities of this ofﬁcial may be
performed by the CIO, the CIO’s staff, or the SAISO.The person in this role
could hold the title of Chief Privacy Ofﬁcer—he or she does not necessarily
have to be called the Senior Agency Privacy Ofﬁcial. What’s most important
is that someone is designated to perform the duties of safeguarding conﬁden-
tial and private information.
Certiﬁcation Agent/Evaluation Team
The Certiﬁcation Agent reviews the Certiﬁcation Packages, making recom-
mendations as to whether they warrant a positive Accreditation or not.
Essentially, Certiﬁcation Agents act as an auditor.They comb through the
unwieldy Certiﬁcation Packages looking for missing information and infor-
mation that doesn’t make sense.Their goal is to determine if the package is in
compliance with the agency’s documented C&A Handbook, process, security
policies, and the information system’s security requirements. In some agencies,
there are so many packages to evaluate that the Certiﬁcation Agent is com-
prised of an evaluation team.The team may have a departmental name such as
Mission Assurance, Information Assurance, or Compliance.The organizational
name is for the most part irrelevant as it could be different from agency to
agency.
After reviewing the C&A packages, the Certiﬁcation Agent, or evaluation
team, makes recommendations to the internal accrediting authorities—the
SAISO and authorizing ofﬁcial—on whether or not a package should be
accredited or not. In most cases, the SAISO and authorizing ofﬁcial accepts
the recommendation of the Certiﬁcation Agent, and signs the accreditation
letter based solely on a recommendation of the Certiﬁcation Agent.Along
with the recommendation, the Certiﬁcation Agent also produces and includes
the Security Assessment Report.The Security Assessment Report should justify the
recommendation. I will talk more about the Security Assessment Report in
Chapter 21.
www.syngress.com
Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process • Chapter 3
31

When the Certiﬁcation Agent is a team of people, they usually split up
the different tasks that need to be accomplished in order to expedite the pro-
cess. For example, one person might evaluate packages for the General
Support Systems, another person might evaluate packages for Major
Applications, another person might create and update templates, and another
person might update the handbook.
The Certification Agent is also responsible for developing the internal
C&A process, and all the documentation that describes this process—the
handbook and the templates.The documentation that the Certification
Agent develops for evaluating the packages are checklists and score cards.
The checklists and score cards should be consistent with the templates and
the handbook.The checklists help the Certification Agent write the Security
Assessment Report.
It is possible that the Certiﬁcation Agent and the Senior Agency
Information Security Ofﬁcer may be the same person since some small agen-
cies may not have the internal resources to have two different staff members
assigned to these roles. If the Certiﬁcation Agent and SAISO are one in the
same person, then the Certiﬁcation Agent makes the accreditation recom-
mendation to the authorizing ofﬁcial.The Certiﬁcation Agent does not make
the ﬁnal decision on whether a C&A package should be accredited—he or
she makes recommendations only on whether or not the package should be
accredited.
In order to demonstrate objectivity, it is often the case that the evaluation
team consists of outside consultants. FISMA, § 3454 states:
Each year each agency shall have performed an independent
evaluation of the information security program and practices
of that agency to determine the effectiveness of such pro-
gram and practices.
If an agency decides to use its own staff, it should be sure that there is a
clear separation of duties between the evaluators and the organizations that
are presenting the C&A packages for evaluation.

Business Owner
The business owner is a generic reference to the information system owner, and
it is likely that there are no employees of the agency with the title “informa-
tion system owner,” which is why I am not capitalizing the terminology here.
The information system owner could be a Program Manager, an Application
Manager, an IT Director, or an Engineering Director for example. In short, it
is the person who is responsible for the development and operations of the
information system.
The information system owner is the one who typically gets the ball
rolling for a new C&A project. Information system owners need to ensure
that their information system is fully accredited before being put into produc-
tion. Once an information system is in production, it needs to be recertiﬁed
and accredited every three years.
It is the information system owner’s responsibility to appoint someone to
be the Information System Security Ofﬁcer for the system requiring C&A.
System Owner
The system owner is the person responsible for administering the systems that
the C&A application runs on.A system owner can be one lone systems
administrator, or a systems department. In a large distributed application, it is
possible that the different systems that are a piece of the application infras-
tructure have different system owners. When a large distributed application
has different system owners, sometimes the different system owners can be
different geographic locations or different buildings.
All C&A packages, whether it is a package for a Major Application, or the
General Support Services infrastructure that the application runs on, should
specify who the system owner is.The system owners are the folks who pro-
vide the systems support.The system owner should be indicated in the Asset
Inventory.The contact information for the system owners should be indicated
in the Contingency Plan and the Business Impact Assessment.
Information Owner
The information owner is the person who owns the data.The information
owner is concerned about the integrity of the data, and communicates with
the system owner about issues related to the security controls of the system or
www.syngress.com
Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process • Chapter 3
33

databases that the data resides on.The person, or department, that owns the
data is not always the same as the system owner, though it could be. In many
cases, the system owner maintains the data for the information owner.The
information owner is often someone who reports to the business owner and
could be a database manager, or an application manager. It is possible that in
some organizations the information owner and the business owner are the
same person.
It is possible that the data on the system slated for C&A falls under a dif-
ferent jurisdiction than that of the system owner. It is also possible that the
information owner and the system owner are one in the same person.
Sometimes databases may be administered and managed by someone that has
expert credentials in the area. If the system owner and information owners are
not one in the same people, this should be noted in the Certiﬁcation Package
in the Asset Inventory.
Information System Security Ofﬁcer
The Information System Security Ofﬁcer (ISSO) is responsible for managing
the security of the information system that is slated for C&A.The ISSO
insures that the information systems conﬁguration is in compliance with the
agency’s information security policy.All the certiﬁcation package documents
are prepared either by the ISSO, or for the ISSO, by staff or contractors.
Typically ISSOs have a large plate of responsibilities and they likely will need
to augment their staff with contractors to prepare a Certiﬁcation Package
expeditiously. It is not uncommon for one ISSO to be responsible for the
preparation of half a dozen C&A packages. Since one C&A package could
easily take a year for a well-versed security expert to prepare, it is considered
standard and acceptable for ISSOs to hire consultants from outside the agency
to prepare the Certiﬁcation Package. It also improves the objectivity of the
Certiﬁcation Package to have it prepared by third-party individuals that are
not part of the agency’s own staff.
Once a Certiﬁcation Package is complete, the ISSO presents it to an eval-
uation team who then proceeds to validate the ﬁndings.The evaluation team
is an extension of the certifying agent. If the certifying agent does not appoint
or assemble an evaluation team, the certifying agent should be prepared to
www.syngress.com
34
Chapter 3 • Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process

evaluate the Certiﬁcation Package and make a recommendation on whether
to issue a positive Accreditation.
C&A Preparers
The C&A preparers, sometimes referred to as the C&A review team, pre-
pare the Certification Packages for submission to the evaluation team. In
many cases, the C&A preparers are outside consultants.The C&A preparers
can also be a mixed team of outside consultants and internal agency staff.
The C&A preparers work for the information system owner, but usually
under the direction of the Information System Security Officer. When it
comes to putting together the Certification Package, it is the C&A preparers
that perform the bulk of the work.The C&A preparers need to have an
expert background in information security with a breadth of understanding
the various facets of security architecture, information Confidentiality, infor-
mation Integrity, information Availability, security policies, and FISMA reg-
ulations.
Agency Inspectors
To prepare for visits from the GAO, all agencies, and some bureaus, have
their own inspectors that come on site to agency offices to periodically
assess if proper FISMA compliance is taking place. In most cases, the agency
inspectors are not required to give much advanced notification and their
visits can take place without warning.The agency internal inspectors come
from the agency Office of Inspector General (OIG). Many agency OIG
offices have their own Web sites, and you can read more about the different
responsibilities of the OIG there.A short list of a few OIG Web sites is
listed in Table 3.1.

The goal of the agency OIG is to catch any problems and resolve them so
that they do not show up as deﬁciencies on GAO reports.The OIG ofﬁces
have their own investigation and review process and different OIG ofﬁces
may perform their audits in different ways. OIG ofﬁces that are more vigilant
in their audit and review process are more likely to prevent the agency from
being cited as deﬁcient by GAO inspectors.
GAO Inspectors
Oversight auditors from the GAO visit federal agencies on an annual basis,
and review accredited Certiﬁcation Packages to make sure that they have
been accredited properly.The GAO also reviews the agency’s C&A process to
determine if it is acceptable. If the GAO discovers that Certiﬁcation Packages
were inappropriately accredited, or if the agency’s C&A process is deﬁcient in
any way, agency ofﬁcials will document the ﬁndings and the agency will
receive poor grades on the annual Federal Computer Security Report Card.
The Federal Computer Security Report Card is published each year by the
U.S. Committee on Government Reform.
Levels of Audit
Taking into consideration the evaluation team, the OIG inspectors, and the
GAO inspectors, you can see that the FISMA process undergoes rigorous
levels of audit (see Figure 3.1). Usually there are no less than three levels of
audit. Some agencies may even have an additional level of audit.After the
evaluation team reviews the Certiﬁcation Package, it is possible that another
www.syngress.com
36

internal compliance organization may review the Certiﬁcation Package again
to see if the evaluation team did their job correctly.The original evaluation
team and an ancillary compliance team may not in fact agree on whether a
Certiﬁcation Package should be accredited, and often the two internal audit
organizations will have to have numerous discussions among themselves to
come to an agreement on the ﬁnal Accreditation recommendation.
Having so many levels of audit can in fact seem like overkill; however, the
agencies that seem to indulge in these audit redundancies, and separation of
duties, often fare the best on the Federal Computer Security Report Card.

Stepping through the Process
As you recall from Chapter 2, there are four high-level phases to the C&A
process.To get from one phase to another, a lot of stuff happens along the
way. Let me help you understand how to get from one phase to the next.
The Initiation Phase
The Initiation Phase is usually informally managed by the information system
owner and the ISSO.Although all information system owners should be
aware of the fact that FISMA requires new information systems to be posi-
tively accredited, this may not be at the forefront of their minds.Therefore, it
is altogether likely that the ISSO may bring the need for C&A to the atten-
tion of the information system owner. Whether the need for C&A is initiated
by the information system owner, or the ISSO, some sort of acknowledgment
www.syngress.com
Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process • Chapter 3
37

between these two individuals that a C&A needs to take place should occur.
The acknowledgment does not have to be formal, or even written.A simple
hallway conversation can sufﬁce as long as both parties come to agree that it’s
time to get a C&A project started.
During the Initiation Phase, the information system owner and the ISSO
should agree on what resources to use to for the C&A prepare team.
Decisions need to be made on whether to hire outside contractors, or use in-
house staff. Since C&A, if done properly, is usually a much bigger job than
most people realize, I cannot emphasize enough the value in using outside
consultants. Putting together a Certiﬁcation Package is a full-time job and
usually the results will be insufﬁcient if the government ofﬁce tries to double-
up its existing staff to perform C&A duties in conjunction with their existing
daily routine.
In outsourcing the preparation of a Certiﬁcation Package to outside con-
sultants, it is important for the ISSO to ensure that he or she is hiring capable
individuals with the appropriate expertise.The ISSO should ask numerous
questions to a potential contract company and its staff before enlisting the
Contractor Ofﬁcer (COTR) to close an agreement. Questions that may assist
an ISSO in determining the expert C&A capabilities of potential consultants
might be:
■
For what other agencies have you performed C&A?
■
Do you have a track record in obtaining positive Accreditations?
■
Can you name the C&A documents that you are experienced in
preparing?
■
Will you be able to make numerous trips on site to meet with 
our staff?
■
Can you provide resumes for the available consultants?
■
Do you have a description of your C&A preparation services?
■
Can you provide references from other agencies?
Not all C&A consulting services are the same. One clear indication that a
contracting company does not fully understand C&A is if they list only a few
document types in their C&A service description. Some companies claim to
www.syngress.com
38
Chapter 3 • Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process

understand C&A, but for example, will list that their C&A service consists of
a Self-Assessment and a Vulnerability Assessment (which of course is only part
of the picture).You really want to hire consultants that understand the entire
ball of wax and can develop all the documents required for C&A.
It will only slow down and complicate the process if you hire, say, one
company to develop part of the deliverables and another company to develop
the other part. When it comes to C&A, ﬁnding a contracting company that
offers one-stop-shopping is really the most efﬁcient way to go. One good way
to ﬁnd out how well a candidate contracting company understands C&A is to
ask them for a project proposal with milestones built into it. By comparing
different project proposals side-by-side, it should become clear which of the
candidate contracting companies offer the best expertise.
Last but not least, before preparing a Certiﬁcation Package, the ISSO
should have some understanding of whether or not the proposed
Certiﬁcation Package will result in a positive accreditation. If the ISSO knows
up front that proper security controls have not been put into place, that secu-
rity is improperly conﬁgured, and that security policies have not been adhered
to, it is better to ﬁx these problems before beginning the C&A process.This
does not mean that C&A is optional. What I am suggesting is that if you
know of weaknesses that require correction, start correcting them immedi-
ately. Don’t wait for C&A time to come along before making the necessary
corrections.
NIST advises that the information System Security Plan be analyzed
during the initiation phase.Although there is nothing theoretically wrong
with this approach, it is often the case that for a new information system, a
System Security Plan does exist. In putting together the Certiﬁcation
Package, it is a more likely scenario that the System Security Plan will be
either written for the ﬁrst time, or revised and updated during the
Certiﬁcation Phase. During a recertiﬁcation of a package that has been previ-
ously accredited, an old System Security Plan would of course already exist.

C&A Best Practices…
Initiation Phase Milestones
During the initiation phase, you should be asking these questions:
■Have C&A preparers been identiﬁed?
■Have known security weaknesses been addressed?
■Has the of the FIPS 199 security categorization been 
completed?
The Certiﬁcation Phase
The Certiﬁcation Phase is the time period in which the Certiﬁcation Package
is prepared. It is during this phase that the C&A preparers (or review team)
gather all the supporting evidence and documentation, and develop the new
documents required for the Certiﬁcation Package.
If the proposed C&A is for a brand new information system, no prior
Certiﬁcation Package will exist. If the C&A is for an older information
system, a prior Certiﬁcation Package should exist and be available for review.
New C&As are required every three years. Certiﬁcation for an information
system that previously has been accredited is referred to as a “recertiﬁcation.”
Recertiﬁcations require the same suite of documents that new Certiﬁcation
Packages require. When working on a recertiﬁcation, the prior Certiﬁcation
Package should be reviewed thoroughly to ensure that all risks previously
cited in the old Certiﬁcation Package have been mitigated.
The C&A review team will need to come on site to the agency’s ofﬁce to
be available to interview the information system’s development and manage-
ment team. It is critical for the C&A review team to learn as much about the
information system as possible and ask as many questions as necessary.The
information system owner should advise his or her development staff to
www.syngress.com
40
Chapter 3 • Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process

accommodate the C&A review team and provide them with as much infor-
mation as possible about the design and conﬁguration of the system slated for
C&A.
C&A review teams may consist of anywhere from a few people, up to a
dozen or more depending on the complexity of the information system slated
for C&A. What should determine the number of individuals on the C&A
team is the scope of the project, and timeframe of the project.As you increase
the scope, and decrease the timeframe, the need for a bigger C&A review
team increases. Most C&A review teams require at least three months min-
imum to assemble an adequate Certiﬁcation Package. It would not be out of
the question, however, for a C&A review team to take six months to prepare
a Certiﬁcation Package for a large and complex infrastructure.

Certiﬁcation Phase Milestones
■Design and architecture documents are reviewed.
■Vulnerabilities are identiﬁed.
■Evidence of risk mitigation is identiﬁed.
■Certiﬁcation documents are written.
■Analysis of acceptable risk to agency is completed.
The Accreditation Phase
The Accreditation Phase begins when the Certiﬁcation Package has been
completed.The evaluation team reads through the Certiﬁcation Package in its
entirety, and validates if the ﬁndings are accurate, and if all the required infor-
mation is present.A Certiﬁcation Package can easily be in excess of 500
pages.At least two to four weeks should be allotted for the Accreditation
Phase.

Most evaluation teams will have already prepared checklists of particular
criteria they expect to ﬁnd in the Certiﬁcation Package before they actually
begin the evaluation. In Chapter 21 I will discuss what these checklists typi-
cally look like.
If a Certiﬁcation Package passes muster with the evaluators, a recommen-
dation will be made that the package be positively accredited.The Certifying
Agent will review the recommendation, and as long as it appears justiﬁed, will
sign a formal letter of Accreditation.The accreditation letter will also need to
be signed by the ISSO, the information owner, the authorizing ofﬁcial, and
then will be sent to the CIO.The CIO is supposed to acknowledge receipt of
the letter by signing it.

Accreditation Milestones
■Submission of package to evaluators
■Review and comment resolution
■Recommendation to Accredit (or not)
The Continuous Monitoring Phase
Once an information system has been accredited, it should be continuously
monitored. Conﬁguration management changes should be an on-going and
well-managed process with approval mechanisms built in. Dates of changes
and versions of code changes should all be documented. Security controls
should also be monitored and any changes made to them should be docu-
mented. If ﬁrewall policies are changed, the changes and reasons for the
changes should be documented. If intrusion detection conﬁguration changes
are made, they should be fully described and the reasons for the changes
should documented.
www.syngress.com
42
Chapter 3 • Understanding the Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Process

It is often the case that not nearly enough time is put into the
Continuous Monitoring Phase, since once a positive Accreditation has been
made, most ISSOs and information system owners tend to breathe a sigh of
relief and seem to like to put the entire C&A process behind them. Putting
together a Certiﬁcation Package and obtaining an Accreditation is a daunting
task and doing more of it, after the job is done, is not usually high on
anyone’s agenda after the fact. However, keeping the documents up to date
will make any future recertiﬁcations much easier. Unless the information
system is decommissioned, it in fact will need to be recertiﬁed in three years.
The documents that are a part of the Certiﬁcation Package are considered
live documents, and can be updated at any time. It is best to update the docu-
ments as soon as changes are made to the information systems since that is
when the new information is most fresh in everyone’s mind. Updating docu-
mentation never seems to be high on the list of important tasks to complete,
and for that reason, I recommend that updating Certiﬁcation Package docu-
ments be built into the change management process. Each time a document is
updated, it should be reviewed and approved through the change control pro-
cess and then archived both locally and at an offsite location.

Summary
The certiﬁcation and accreditation process consists of a four-phase life cycle:
initiation, certiﬁcation, accreditation, and continuous monitoring.Throughout
all four phases there are several roles participating in the process, and each role
is responsible for the execution of speciﬁc tasks.As a C&A professional you
are responsible for the execution of your tasks, but in order to accomplish
them, you must ensure that all other individuals ﬁlling C&A roles are working
together effectively and efﬁciently as well. It is critical to understand the
overall process, and how all the pieces described in this chapter ﬁt together in
order to manage a C&A project.

Introduction
If your agency or bureau doesn’t already have an information security pro-
gram established, chances are that it hasn’t scored well on the annual Federal
Computer Security Report Card. Since FISMA isn’t going to go away, and
senior executives will be held accountable for obtaining acceptable Federal
Computer Security Report Card scores, now is the time to start putting into
place an information security program.The C&A program is just a piece of
the greater information security program, albeit a big piece.The information
security program includes the whole ball of wax—security policies, proce-
dures, requirements, C&A guidelines, and all the documentation that goes
with it.The C&A program is a well-thought-out process with documentation
to support it. It explains how C&A will be done within the agency.
If your agency already has information security and C&A programs in
place, now might be a good time to start thinking about how you can
improve your program. Once a C&A program has been developed, an astute
agency will ﬁnd the need to update and revise the program each year.The
more your C&A program is used, the better it will become.
The C&A program developers are often the same folks who are part of
the agency evaluation team—however, they don’t have to be.There are no
federal restrictions on which people within the agency can participate in
developing the C&A program.The agency itself, however, may set their own
policies on who is responsible for development of the C&A program. Since
developing the program is a big job, whoever manages the project to develop
the program should reign in participants throughout the agency to help build
and document the program.To ensure a separation of duties and enforce
objectivity, some agencies may opt to, or be required to, hire outside consul-
tants or contractors to help develop their C&A program.
C&A Handbook Development
In developing the program, you’ll need to write a C&A Handbook that
instructs your agency or bureau on how to prepare a Certiﬁcation Package.
The idea is to standardize the development of all Certiﬁcation Packages that
are submitted for evaluation. Without a handbook and a speciﬁed process, the
www.syngress.com
46
Chapter 4 • Establishing a C&A Program

Certiﬁcation Packages will have a different look and feel. If 50 different
Certiﬁcation Packages all have the right information in it, but in different for-
mats, it is going to be very difﬁcult for the evaluators to ﬁnd the information.
If the packages have different types of information in them, it is going to be
very hard for the evaluators to review the packages according to the same
standards.
Writing the handbook is a big job.A good handbook is likely to be
around 200 pages long.The handbook has to include very speciﬁc informa-
tion on what your agency evaluators need to see in every Certiﬁcation
Package. It should instruct the folks preparing the Certiﬁcation Packages on
what documents they will be required to submit, and what should be
included in each document.The best way to ensure that each document
includes the right kind of information is to create templates.
What to Include in Your Handbook
Each agency’s handbook will be somewhat different and take on slightly dif-
ferent organizational formats. However, it is highly advisable that all hand-
books include sections in the following areas:
■
Background, purpose, scope
■
Regulatory citations (FISMA; FIPS 199; OMB Circular A-130.
Appendix III)
■
Reference to associated internal security policies

Who Should Write the Handbook?
There are no restrictions on who can write a C&A Handbook.An agency
can use its own staff, or outside consultants. However, the development of the
handbook should probably be done under the authority of the department
that will oversee the evaluators. It makes sense that the Certifying Agent
should designate the appropriate staff to write the handbook since he or she
will need to live by its guidelines and accredit packages according to its stipu-
lations.There is nothing that says the Certifying Agent cannot author the
handbook. However, given the daily day-to-day responsibilities of the
Certifying Agent, the time it takes to development the handbook may require
that it be done by an appointed staff, or outside consultants.
Template Development
Certiﬁcation Packages consist of a set of documents that all go together and
complement one another.A Certiﬁcation Package is voluminous, and without
standardization, it takes an inordinate amount of time to evaluate it to make
sure all the right information is included.Therefore, agencies should have
templates for all the documents that they require in their Certiﬁcation
Packages.Agencies without templates should work on creating them. If an
agency does not have the resources in-house to develop these templates, they
should consider outsourcing this initiative to outside consultants.
A template should be developed using the word processing application
that is the standard within the agency.All of the relevant sections that the
evaluation team will be looking for within each document should be

The later chapters in this book will help you understand what should be
included in each of these types of documents. Some agencies may possibly
require other types of documents as required by their information security
program and policies.
Templates should include guidelines for what type of content should be
included, and also should have built-in formatting.The templates should be as
complete as possible, and any text that should remain consistent and exactly
the same in like document types should be included.Though it may seem
redundant to have the exact same verbatim text at the beginning of, say, each
Business Risk Assessment from a particular agency, each document needs to be
able to stand alone and make sense if it is pulled out of the Certiﬁcation

Package for review. Having similar wording in like documents also shows that
the packages were developed consistently using the same methodology and
criteria.
With established templates in hand, it makes it much easier for the C&A
review team to understand what it is that they need to document. Even
expert C&A consultants need and appreciate document templates. Finding
the right information to include the C&A documents can by itself by
extremely difﬁcult without ﬁrst having to ﬁgure out what it is that you are
supposed to ﬁnd—which is why the templates are so very important. It’s
often the case that a large complex application is distributed and managed
throughout multiple departments or divisions and it can take a long time to
ﬁgure out not just what questions to ask, but who the right people are who
will know the answers.
Provide Package Delivery Instructions
Your C&A program should include information on how speciﬁcally the ISSO
should submit the ﬁnal Certiﬁcation Package to the evaluation team.The
evaluation team needs to understand whether to expect the package by e-
mail, CD, or to look on a protected network share. It’s a good idea for agen-
cies to require that both hardcopy and software documents be submitted to
the evaluation team. Hardcopy documents should be bound together. I rec-
ommend using a three-ring binder because it is easy to update a single piece
of the package and insert it easily after removing the outdated pages.
Most of these documents will contain sensitive information, and for that
reason, they should not be e-mailed to anyone over the Internet unless they
are protected by 128 bit encryption—either by ﬁle encryption or through a
Virtual Private Network (VPN). Before e-mailing C&A documents out of
the agency over any external public networks, you should really check the
security policies of your particular agency to ﬁnd out what the requirements
are for protecting sensitive information. If outside consultants are being used
to prepare a Certiﬁcation Package, it may very well be that the only safe way
to exchange documents with them is for them to come on site. Most agencies
will not set up a VPN to outside consultants, and getting approvals to use ﬁle
encryption or certiﬁcates can take more time than the time it takes to create
www.syngress.com
50
Chapter 4 • Establishing a C&A Program

the entire Certiﬁcation Package.Though it may seem trailing-edge, sometimes
exchanging documents in person using a CD or a USB ﬂash drive is the eas-
iest way to exchange C&A documents.
Create an Evaluation Process
The evaluation of a Certiﬁcation Package should be a standardized procedure.
Before going through the Certiﬁcation Package, the evaluation team should
know up front exactly what it is that they are looking for.Agencies that do
not have a standardized methodology for evaluating Certiﬁcation Packages
will not score well on the annual Federal Computer Security Report Card.
The standardized process should be different depending on the security
category (level) of the Certiﬁcation Package.There are four possible security
levels that Certiﬁcation Packages can be prepared in accordance with, and
these different levels have slightly different requirements.The level is deter-
mined using guidance from the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 199 (see Appendix C). I will talk more about how to determine C&A
levels using levels of impact in Chapter 6.
Authority and Endorsement
It is important that a C&A program be developed and endorsed at a high
level within the agency.The purpose of the program will be completely
defeated if individual departments each try to create their own C&A pro-
gram.The idea is to create a standard, and a standard means one process.The
program should be spearheaded by the CIO or authorizing ofﬁcial, even if all
the work is delegated to the certifying agent.That doesn’t mean that the tech-
nical staff within various departments can’t contribute to the program’s devel-
opment. Some of the best ideas often come from the technical staff that takes
the most interest in a project.The development of the program, however,
needs to be organized and endorsed at the level of the CIO, authorizing ofﬁ-
cial, and certifying agent.

Improve Your C&A Program Each Year
Once a handbook and templates are established, they should be improved
upon and reﬁned as necessary. However, updating them every single year may
be counterproductive.You want the people within the organization to gain
familiarity with the C&A handbook and process. If you change the hand-
book, process, and templates every year, they will not become familiar with it.
Once you have a handbook and process in place that has been reviewed,
edited, and published, it is best not to rewrite the handbook more often than
every two years. Of course if there are egregious errors, those may need to be
addressed.
Developing a handbook and templates takes a long time. Once an agency
has invested the time to develop these materials, they should hold training
courses to train the agency’s ISSOs on how to follow the requirements. Once
ISSOs have been duly informed and trained, they can clearly be held
accountable for their role in developing proper Certiﬁcation Packages
according to the agency requirements.
Problems of Not Having a C&A Program
If your agency does not have a standardized C&A program, you can expect
the C&A process to become extremely confusing and overly complicated.
C&A preparers will not know what should be included in each package, and
evaluators will not know if anything is missing.
Missing Information
Without a C&A program, different Certiﬁcation Packages will include dif-
ferent types of information. For example, without a prescribed and standard-
ized C&A program, one Certiﬁcation Package might have an Information
Technology Contingency Plan (ITCP) and others might not. One
Certiﬁcation Package might include a network topology map, and others
might not. When it comes time to evaluate the entire Certiﬁcation Package, it
is hard to fail a package for not having an information technology
Contingency Plan if no policy or organizational process ever required one to
exist in the ﬁrst place. It is very hard to hold the information system owners
www.syngress.com
52
Chapter 4 • Establishing a C&A Program

and the ISSOs accountable for putting together adequate Certiﬁcation
Packages if your agency has not yet deﬁned what exactly constitutes an ade-
quate Certiﬁcation Package.
Lack of Organization
Though specifying the right information to include in a Certiﬁcation
Package is of primary importance, the format of the package should not be
overlooked.A Certiﬁcation Package can be 500 pages long. Unless each one
is organized the same way, it will be very cumbersome for the evaluators to
wade through the voluminous information and check to see if all the right
material has been included. It’s best to make things easiest for the evaluators.
Evaluators who can’t make heads or tails out of the information presented to
them, and can’t ﬁnd key pieces of information, are going to be reluctant to
recommend that a package be accredited.
Inconsistencies in the Evaluation Process
You want each Certiﬁcation Package to be evaluated the same way. One
agency may have many different evaluators. Without any sort of standard for
Certiﬁcation Package content or format, you are leaving the entire evaluation
up to the subjective opinion of one (or a small group) of people. Different
evaluators may put emphasis on different areas. If each package has the same
organizational format, it improves the chances that different evaluators will
evaluate the packages in the same way because they will look for, and expect
the same type of information.
Unknown Security 
Architecture and Conﬁguration
Without a Certification Package, it may be the case that the security archi-
tecture and configuration of your information infrastructure is not known.
By working through the C&A process, you will become aware of whether
this is the case or not. If the security architecture is well documented, C&A
serves as an opportunity to make sure the architecture diagrams and net-
work maps are correct. If it’s not well documented, or not documented at
all, this is something you’ll want to research and diagram.The same holds
www.syngress.com
Establishing a C&A Program • Chapter 4
53

true for the security configuration.All software requires configurations.
When operating systems and applications are installed, even if they are
installed securely, are the security settings documented? If the security set-
tings are not documented, they are basically unknown. Even expert and sea-
soned systems administrators cannot usually remember every little thing
they have done to a system when configuring it because today’s operating
systems and applications are so feature rich.That is why security architec-
ture and configuration documentation is critical.The C&A process is
designed to find the unknowns of the security architecture and configura-
tion settings and then resolve the unknowns by creating the necessary docu-
mentation along the way.
Unknown Risks
Federal laws aside, the primary reason for understanding the security posture
of your information systems is to identify risks, understand them, and take
mitigating actions. With C&A left undeﬁned, you are leaving the risks that
you want your agency to look for open to speculation. Maybe the agency
ISSOs will identify all the key risks, but maybe they won’t. One ISSO may
put emphasis on disaster recovery planning, and another might put emphasis
on system risks. It is unlikely that they all will put the same emphasis on all
aspects of information security. When it comes to identifying risks, there are
numerous items to take into consideration.There are business risks, system
risks, training risks, policy risks, inventory risks, and so on.A well-deﬁned
C&A program ensures that all the relevant types of risks are taken into con-
sideration.
Laws and Report Cards
You may be surprised to ﬁnd out that the words “certiﬁcation” and “accredi-
tation” are not used in the Federal Information Security Act of 2002. However,
the law very clearly states the requirement of an information security pro-
gram, and also names the required elements of that program. Many of the
required elements of the mandated information security program are those
that have evolved to be now known as “Certiﬁcation and Accreditation.”
Even if the agency-wide program were called something else—say “The
www.syngress.com
54
Chapter 4 • Establishing a C&A Program

Security Validation Program”—all the same elements of the program would
be required.You should not get hung up on the fact that you don’t see the
terms “certiﬁcation” or “accreditation” in the written law.The named ele-
ments of the program are required by law no matter how you entitle them.
Without these elements, and without an information security program, agen-
cies are breaking the law. What’s more, agencies that don’t have the right ele-
ments included in their information security program will obtain poor
Federal Computer Security Report Card grades. I’ll discuss this more in
Chapter 23, but it’s almost a sure bet that if you don’t have a well-deﬁned
C&A program, you won’t get a good grade on the Federal Computer
Security Report card.
Summary
There is no task that can be effectively accomplished using a repeatable pro-
cess without having adequate documentation in place.Therefore, the ﬁrst step
in implementing a C&A program in an organization is developing a C&A
handbook. Once the handbook is ﬁnalized it should be clear that there is a set
of documents that will be created or used during the execution of each C&A
task.Templates for each of these tasks should be developed to standardize the
output and to reduce the work required to create them. Once these items are
in place, C&A packages can effectively and efﬁciently be generated, but the
C&A program should include mechanisms by which the process itself can be
evaluated and improved. Cars are not manufactured the same way today as
they were 20 years ago. Process improvements are discovered and incorpo-
rated into the process, and the same should be true of any C&A program. If
an organization’s C&A program is constantly evolving and improving, then by
extension, the organization’s security posture should be evolving and
improving as well.

Introduction
Before you’ll be able to start putting together a Certiﬁcation Package, you’ll
need to acquire as much information as possible about the systems or applica-
tions you’ll be certifying.You need to be a good detective, and not lose faith
when the details appear unclear.The more information you gather the clearer
the details will become.You are about to put together an information tech-
nology jigsaw puzzle.
Initiating Your C&A Project
When you begin your C&A project, don’t expect everyone who has played a
role in developing and administering the application or systems you are certi-
fying to start volunteering information for you to use.You will need to take
the initiative to go out and collect as much documentation as you can, and
conduct interviews with the appropriate staff. If you are a consultant, ﬁrst you
will need to ﬁgure out who the appropriate staff are that you need to talk to.
You are going to have to ask a lot of questions.The sponsoring manager that
signed you up for completing the C&A is the best person to start this.The
sponsoring manager may be the system owner, the ISSO, the contracting
ofﬁcer, or an application development manager.
Put Together a Contact List
You ﬁrst need to ﬁgure out who will have knowledge of all the security par-
ticularities of the information system.You should start by identifying the
people involved.The sponsoring manager should be able to answer a lot of
your questions.To ﬁnd the appropriate people who understand the security of
the information system or systems that require accreditation, you’ll need to
ask the following questions:
■
Was the application developed in-house or purchased from a vendor?
■
If the application was purchased from a vendor was any customiza-
tion done to it?
■
Who did the customization?
■
If the application was developed in-house, who designed it?
www.syngress.com
58
Chapter 5 • Developing a Certiﬁcation Package

■
Are there design speciﬁcations and documents? Who has them?
■
Is the application hosted on-site or at a remote site?
■
If the application is hosted remotely, who is responsible for its 
operations?
These questions are the “Who?” questions. From the answers to your
questions, you should be able to start putting together a contact list of the
people who have been a part of the design and implementation of the infor-
mation system. Include their phone numbers and e-mail addresses because
you’ll need to contact them often.
Some federal agencies are quite large, and due to the size of the opera-
tions, sometimes impersonal. When you contact the various people on your
contact list, you’ll need to explain to them who you are and why you are
contacting them. Don’t expect them to know that a C&A project is underway
or even to know what C&A is about. If you contact them and say that you
need to meet with them to discuss a C&A project, be prepared to tell them
what C&A means since there is a good chance they may not have a clue what
you are talking about.
Finding out all the information you will need to create a Certiﬁcation
Package is much like going on a treasure hunt. If you are an outside consul-
tant, at the start of the project, it is altogether possible that no one except the
sponsoring manager will know why you are on-site at the agency. It’s very
unlikely that someone will come up to you and say,“I hear that you are on-
site to put together a Certiﬁcation Package for our information system. Here
are all the security policies, design documents, and the security conﬁguration
of the system that you will need.” In large federal agencies, my experience has
been that no one readily and quickly volunteers information about system
security.
Hold a Kick-Off Meeting
Once you have found out who the key players are (the people that have been
part of designing, developing, coding, and implementing the information
system), you should schedule a Kick-off Meeting and invite them all. Do your
best to form good relationships with these folks because you will become
reliant on them for information. During the Kick-off Meeting introduce
www.syngress.com
Developing a Certiﬁcation Package • Chapter 5
59

them to the C&A team, and explain to them brieﬂy what C&A is all about.
During this ﬁrst meeting, you should tell them that you will need as much
documentation as you can get on the particular information system that is
slated for accreditation.Ask them if they can e-mail you documentation as
soon as possible; otherwise they may take weeks to get it to you.You will
need information on the design, development, implementation, conﬁguration,
network topology, and testing of the information system.You will need to
review all this documentation to ﬁnd the right bits of information to put into
the Certiﬁcation Package.
Obtain Any Existing Agency Guidelines
It is key to ﬁnd out if the agency you are working for has a C&A Handbook.
Agencies that have in the past scored well on their Federal Computer Security
Report Cards probably have one.Agencies that have scored poorly on their
report card may not have one. If a handbook exists, you must follow all the
guidelines written in it when preparing your Certiﬁcation Package—even if
they are poor guidelines. If the evaluation team does its job properly, they will
be evaluating the Certiﬁcation Package for how well it follows the agency
C&A Handbook and requirements.
If a handbook exists, and you think parts of it are so wrong that you
shouldn’t follow it, you need to take this up with the ISSO and package eval-
uation team before making any decisions. When you are preparing a
Certiﬁcation Package is not necessarily the best time to try to get the agency
to change their regulations and policies. If you think that some parts of it are
incorrect, before you go ahead and decide to go your own way and create a
more “correct” Certiﬁcation Package, bring the issues to the attention of the
ISSO and offer justiﬁcation as to why you would like to proceed differently.
Some agencies will fail your Certiﬁcation Package if you don’t follow their
handbook—even if the handbook is wrong.
All agencies are supposed to have a handbook and templates to standardize
the C&A process. However, some agencies are less prepared than others, and if
you embark on a C&A project, and ﬁnd out that no handbook or templates
exist, you’ll have to do without.You can still put together a solid Certiﬁcation
Package without a handbook or templates, and if you do a good job, perhaps
you will be enlisted as a future contributor to develop the much needed
www.syngress.com
60
Chapter 5 • Developing a Certiﬁcation Package

handbook and templates. If a C&A handbook is not present, then see if the
parent agency has one. For example a bureau or agency department may not
have their own handbook, but the parent agency might. If no C&A handbook
at all exists, ﬁgure out which methodology your agency should be using
(NIST, DITSCAP, NIACAP, DCID 6/3) and look to that for guidance.
Analyze Your Research
Once you have received the various documents from the information system
developers and administrators, you’ll need to analyze these documents to see
if they include the kind of information that you’ll need to include in the
Certiﬁcation Package. It is likely that much of the information you need for
the Certiﬁcation Package will not be included in the various documents you
receive. If the information system(s) that are up for C&A have been previ-
ously accredited, then a prior Certiﬁcation Package should exist.You should
make it a point to review the prior Certiﬁcation Package, and use any infor-
mation from it that is still relevant. If anything appears incorrect in the prior
Certiﬁcation Package, you should correct it, even if it was not cited for deﬁ-
ciencies in the prior Accreditation.
Put together a list of questions regarding the kinds of things you still need
to ﬁnd out from the information system developers and administrators, and
schedule meetings with the folks that you think can best answer your ques-
tions. Keep meeting with the team and contacting them on the phone and by
e-mail until all your questions are answered. It often takes several rounds of
inquiries before you receive all the appropriate information.
Preparing the Documents
Although there are likely no regulations that require you to put together the
Certiﬁcation Package documents in any particular order, I happen to think
that the order in which you put the documents together is important. For
example, if you put together the Hardware and Software Inventory up front, it
will help you in writing the descriptive text about the accreditation bound-
aries that are required in the System Security Plan. In the subsequent chapters
of this book, I present the various Certiﬁcation Package documents in the
order that I have found works well for cohesiveness in understanding the
www.syngress.com
Developing a Certiﬁcation Package • Chapter 5
61

information system. In some cases, it may make sense for you to change the
order of these documents when putting together your Certiﬁcation Package.
The main point to take away is that if a document contains information that
is dependent on a prior document, develop the prior document ﬁrst. It will
be hard to know how to rate the outage impact of the assets listed in the
Business Impact Assessment if you don’t yet know what the assets are—if the
Hardware and Software Inventory has not yet been completed.
It’s Okay to Be Redundant
Many of the documents in the Certiﬁcation Package include information that
is redundant from one document to the next.The reason for this is because
each document needs to be able to stand on its own. Some of the informa-
tion that you ﬁnd for some of the earlier documents can and should be used
in subsequent documents.You want to give the impression that all the docu-
ments are consistent with each other and support each other.Though in
many forms of writing being redundant is not desirable, in crafting
Certiﬁcation Packages, it is necessary. One of the things that the evaluators
look for are inconsistencies between the various Certiﬁcation Package docu-
ments.Any inconsistencies usually raise a ﬂag and call for closer inspection.
Different Agencies Have Different Requirements
Not all agencies require the exact same documents for C&A. FISMA allows
for ﬂexibility, and one agency may require certain documents that other agen-
cies don’t require.Though it could be argued that this is inequitable, FISMA
was designed to allow each agency to determine its own needs within the
boundaries of the stipulation.The Certiﬁcation Package documents that I will
be discussing in this book are among the most frequently required C&A doc-
uments. However, there may be others that some agencies require that are not
discussed in this book. If your agency requires documents not discussed in this
book that are part of the stated C&A program, that doesn’t mean that your
agency is administering their C&A program the wrong way. However, to be
sure, agencies should be able to justify to the agency Inspector Generals, and
to the GAO, which documents they require and why.
www.syngress.com
62
Chapter 5 • Developing a Certiﬁcation Package

Including Multiple 
Applications and Systems in One Package
You can include multiple applications and information systems in one
Certification Package.To be sure, it makes no sense at all to create a
Certification Package for each and every system that exists at your agency.
You should define the accreditation boundaries of your C&A package as
broadly as you possibly can. Determining the accreditation boundaries is
sometimes the trickiest part of putting together a Certification Package.You
need to understand where the accreditation starts and stops. In general, you
should pick a boundary determination that is large and logical. For example,
if you are accrediting general support systems, you may want to define your
boundary by network domains. If you are accrediting major applications,
you will need to include all the pieces of the infrastructure that the applica-
tion touches.
Usually application infrastructure is managed by a different organization
than the underlying general support systems. Operating systems and network
typically have different information system owners than the applications.
C&A is about holding information system owners accountable, and therefore,
the boundaries need to lie within the jurisdiction over which the information
system owner has control. If you are certifying an application that is
depending on general support systems that the application gets installed on
top of, then this should be clearly stated in the Certiﬁcation Package.An
underlying general support system usually has a different Certiﬁcation
Package than the applications that are installed on top of it. When your
Certiﬁcation Package and the security of your systems is in part dependent
on other systems, that needs to be speciﬁcally stated.You can reference other
Certiﬁcation Packages and other systems that are not within your accredita-
tion boundaries in your documentation. It would be perfectly plausible to
insert a statement such as:
The major applications described in this Certiﬁcation Package
are dependent on the underlying general support systems
that have been previously accredited at Level 4.
www.syngress.com
Developing a Certiﬁcation Package • Chapter 5
63

You should list the formal Certiﬁcation Package name of any other pack-
ages that you reference. If you don’t know the package name, try to ﬁnd it
out. It’s even better to obtain a copy of it if you can. In some cases, it may be
against the security policies of the agency to share such information between
one information owner to another. However at the very least, an outside
information owner should be able to share with you the ofﬁcial document
name and publication date of the related Certiﬁcation Package.
Verify Your Information
Once you have completed a document, before submitting it to the ISSO, send
it out ﬁrst to the information system developers and administrators that are
most familiar with the information systems you are seeking to Accredit.Ask
them to review it and inform you of any factual errors. Network diagrams
should also be reviewed for accuracy. If something doesn’t make sense, it’s
probably either not well-documented or plain wrong. Certiﬁcation and
Accreditation is a time of ensuring that everything is accurate.
In reviewing design documents that you receive, do not just assume that
information contained in them is how the application or information systems
were actually developed. Designs go awry and management changes their
minds about requirements halfway into a project. Just because an information
system was supposed to turn out one way, doesn’t mean it didn’t turn out a
different way.You need to take everything you read with a grain of salt, and
ask questions about things that don’t make sense.
Retain Your Ethics
In most agencies, all the information system owner wants the Certiﬁcation
review team to do is to get the information systems certiﬁed.They don’t nec-
essarily want to know how you will go about doing this as long as you get it
done. Even though you should do everything possible to make that happen,
by all means do not compromise your ethics.
www.syngress.com
64
Chapter 5 • Developing a Certiﬁcation Package

C&A Best Practices…
Hold Fast to Your Ethics
Never compromise your ethics. Under no circumstances should you invent
security controls that do not exist, or document that risks have been mit-
igated if they haven’t. If the information owner or ISSO pressures you to
document items that are obviously not true, you should refrain from
doing so and report the problem to your management. If in the course of
preparing the Certiﬁcation documents you ﬁnd that certain security con-
trols that should have been implemented were not, report that to the
ISSO and recommend that they get implemented as soon as possible. As
long as they are implemented before the Certiﬁcation Package is sub-
mitted, your documentation will not be incorrect. If you feel that there is
absolutely no way the information systems will obtain a positive
Accreditation, discuss this with the ISSO. It is not your job as a
Certiﬁcation document preparer to resolve security problems that should
have been put in place previously. The information system owner and
ISSO are likely both aware that security controls are mandated by law, and
need to be in place. If they are responsible individuals with ethics of their
own, they will not expect you to resolve agency security problems that
you have no control over. 
Most agency information systems can likely obtain a Level 1 Accreditation
with a properly documented Certiﬁcation Package. (I’ll discuss the certiﬁca-
tion levels in detail in the next chapter.) However, if security controls on
information systems appear to be so poorly implemented as to not even war-
rant a Level 1 Accreditation you should meet with the information system
owner and the ISSO and advise them of this. Be sure to include justiﬁcation
as to what you feel is so terribly wrong. If a Level 1 cannot be justiﬁably
obtained, there are really two choices:
■
Stop the C&A process and put in place the necessary security 
controls
■
Continue with the C&A process, documenting the accurate existing
security information, and hope the evaluator will grant the business
owner an Interim Authority to Operate.
www.syngress.com
Developing a Certiﬁcation Package • Chapter 5
65

An Interim Authority to Operate (IATO) is basically like a consolation
Accreditation, and in most cases IATOs expire after six months.An IATO
means that you have convinced the evaluators that the information owner is
at least putting forth a good effort in trying to implement proper security
controls.And for that reason, the Certifying Agent gives you six months to
come into compliance.An IATO usually will include a list of security con-
trols that will need to be in place when the IATO expires.At that time, if the
requirements of the IATO have been met, the system usually will receive an
Authority to Operation (ATO), but if not, the systems can be shut down.
Without an Accreditation in hand, the GAO or the agency OIG can come in
and shut your systems down. However, although the GAO or OIG could
require the systems to be shut down, for practical purposes, in real life this
rarely happens. Certainly an IATO is better than no accreditation at all.
Summary
Developing a Certiﬁcation Package is a big endeavor. One of the biggest
problems that I have noticed is that often business owners and ISSOs do not
start the C&A process soon enough and do not allocate enough resources to
get the job done.The ﬁrst C&A package you develop for your information
system will be the most challenging.After that, unless a signiﬁcant architec-
tural or conﬁguration change occurs, continuous monitoring and updating of
the package are easy enough and should not require as many resources the
second or third time around.

All Certiﬁcation Packages are required to include a software and hardware
inventory of the applications and systems that are being accredited.You’ll also
need this hardware and software inventory when you develop your Business
Impact Assessment. Hardware and software should be thought of as assets.All
key assets that make up the information system should be reported.
Determining the 
Accreditation Boundaries
One of the biggest problems in putting together a hardware and software
inventory is ﬁguring out which systems and applications belong in the inven-
tory, and are within the boundaries of the information system you are certi-
fying. It is possible that the organization that developed the information
system you are accrediting never formally acknowledged or described the
boundaries. However, you can still come up with clear boundaries based on
certain guidelines.As a general rule, the hardware and software assets of the
information system that you plan on accrediting should:
■
Have the same general security requirements
■
Be managed by the same information system owner
■
Have a consistent organizational function or mission
■
Have consistent operational characteristics (geographical locations,
network zones, security zones, ﬁrewall policies, etc.)
You will also need to list all the components of major assets on which the
information system is dependent. Remember, the term information system is
a general term for the item that you are describing in the Certiﬁcation
Package—it could be a group of general support systems or an enterprise
application. If the information system is an enterprise application, you will
still need to list the hardware platform and operating system of the general
support system on which the application resides, even if the general support
system itself is not part of the Certiﬁcation Package. For an enterprise appli-
cation, the application cannot run without the hardware platform and oper-

ating system, which is why they must be listed in the asset inventory. If you
are certifying a general support system or systems, you do not need to list the
applications that reside on these systems unless they are part of the
Certiﬁcation Package. Most of the time, general support systems are certiﬁed
and accredited separately from applications.
The following types of information should be collected about the 
hardware:
■
Manufacturer (Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, etc.)
■
Model
■
Serial Number
■
Geographical location including address, building number, room
number
■
Associated signiﬁcation storage devices
■
Associated IP address(s) and hostname
■
External storage devices
Most C&A programs do not require you to list the amount of RAM and
disk space so it is safe to leave that information out, unless the Handbook
speciﬁcally requires you to list such things.There are likely various physical
systems that safeguard the information system (e.g., halon ﬁre suppressant sys-
tems and temperature alarm systems), but you do not need to list these items
in the asset inventory.
The following types of information should be collected about the 
software:
■
Operating system name and version
■
Patch level and version
■
Application name and version
■
Database names and version
■
Middleware
■
Backup software and version
■
Software license keys

If backups are performed by a third-party provider either within the
agency or by an external private company, it is not necessary to list the name
of the backup application software. However, if the information system has
backups built into it that are performed under the same management organi-
zation of the information system being certiﬁed and accredited, then the
backup software should be listed.
Collecting the Inventory Information
There is no requirement for how you collect the inventory information. If
your information system consists of a large enterprise application, it sure
makes things easier if the inventory information is collected through an auto-
mated process such as some asset inventory tool. However, even if the agency
or bureau you are working with has access to an automated asset inventory,
the information contained in the inventory still will not necessarily tell you
which of the assets are part of the information system(s) you are trying to
certify and accredit.
Usually there is no fast and easy way to collect asset inventory informa-
tion.You will have to have discussions with the in-house subject matter
experts, developers, and management team to come to an understanding of
which components should be included. It is more than likely that much of
the collection will have to be done manually by asking various people to look
up IP addresses, ﬁnd out the patch levels, ﬁnd out the version number, look
on the back of systems to ﬁnd the serial numbers, and so on.You may need to
ask support staff who are in entirely different departments, organizational
groups, or locations to help you obtain this information. Don’t expect that
they will know anything about your C&A project.You will have to explain to
them why you are collecting the information. Due to security concerns, sup-
port staff likely will require various types of authorization before they can
give you the information you are looking for. Be prepared for a lot of red
tape and responses such as “I can’t give this information to you.You will have
to have your ISSO request it and then the request will have to be approved
by my supervisor.” Due to the long chain of authorizations that may be
required to assist you, collecting the asset inventory information usually takes
longer than you would expect.

Structure of Inventory Information
I strongly recommend that you document the hardware and software inven-
tory into a well-organized table or spreadsheet.You can use this same tabular
format later to put together your Business Impact Assessment. (I’ll be discussing
the Business Impact Assessment in Chapter 15.) The function of the asset
should be listed somewhere in the asset inventory table.Aside from listing the
information in a table, you will want to put a short description of the infor-
mation system at the beginning of the asset inventory document.The infor-
mation system description should be consistent with the description that will
be used later in the System Security Plan.The hardware and software inventory
should be a separate document that includes the following elements:
■
Cover page with data classiﬁcation, warnings, date of publication 
and version
■
Table of Contents
■
Record of Changes
■
An overview section that describes the purpose of the document
■
A brief description of the information system
■
A brief description of the agency C&A program requirements for
assets
■
Names of related documents
■
Asset inventory tables
Table 6.1 shows a sample asset inventory table. Large distributed applica-
tions may have a lengthy asset inventory table.Also, if you are including an
entire network domain of general support systems in one C&A package, that
may also require a lengthy asset inventory table.

Delivery of Inventory Document
If your inventory document contains IP addresses, you will want to be sure
not to e-mail it to anyone over the Internet. If you are an outside consultant
and are working from your company ofﬁce, you may have to go on-site to
deliver the inventory document or else e-mail it through secure channels such
as a VPN or using ﬁle encryption.Alternatively it is usually considered
acceptable to deliver documents by CD and courier. However, in case there
are any security policies associated with the ﬁle delivery, you should consult
that C&A Handbook of the agency you are working for.

Summary
Collecting hardware and software inventory information is the ﬁrst big step in
developing a C&A package.This inventory will deﬁne the accreditation
boundary as well as the scope (and cost) of your project, so it is important to
develop a complete and accurate inventory.To develop the inventory, you will
need to work with many of the people in charge of day-to-day operations of
an organization’s information systems.These people are not always focused on
information security issues, and they are usually overworked as it is. So you
need to keep in mind that you should make collecting inventory information
as simple and efﬁcient as possible for them and that you need to develop and
maintain a positive relationship with them. Without their timely and accurate
assistance, your C&A work can suffer the negative impacts of delays and 
inaccuracy.

Introduction
All Certiﬁcation Packages get certiﬁed and accredited at Level 1, 2, 3, or 4.
The C&A review team, information system owner, and ISSO determine the
C&A level and justify this level in a document known as the C&A Level of
Recommendation. Unless the agency has decided to use some other method-
ology for determining the level of recommendation, the best guidance that
exists for determining the level of accreditation is a document known as FIPS
199 (see Appendix C) written by the National Institute of Standards.
Although I don’t plan on trying to recreate FIPS 199, I want to help you
understand how to use it.
What Are the C&A Levels?
There are four different levels for which information systems can be certiﬁed
and accredited.The four levels are known simply as Level 1, Level 2, Level 3,
or Level 4.The information system owner is supposed to decide at what level
to certify the information system, and then obtain buy-in on that level from
the authorizing ofﬁcial.The ISSO and C&A prearation team should assist the
information system owner in determining the proper level at which to certify
and accredit the information system.
Level 1 is for information systems that are not sensitive, and have few
security requirements. Level 2 is for information systems that are somewhat
sensitive, and have some Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability requirements.
Level 3 is for systems with sensitive information that have signiﬁcant
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability requirements. Level 4 is for
extremely sensitive information systems that have the highest requirements for
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Most information systems will fall
into the category of Level 2 or 3. Deciding at which level to certify and
accredit your information systems—2 or 3—can be somewhat thought-
provoking.
Level 1
A Level 1 C&A requires a minimal security review.A Level 1 Certiﬁcation
Package requires only a Security Plan, an Asset Inventory, and a completed
www.syngress.com
76
Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

Security Self-Assessment.Additionaly, security policies must be clearly
deﬁned.A sample self-assessment can be found in Appendix D. Some agencies
may have different requirements for a Level 1 and you should of course
always follow the existing agency guidelines.
Information systems that typically may require a Level 1 C&A are 
systems that:
■
Publish general public information
■
Deliver courseware and training programs
■
Publish information on product information
■
Publish information on workplace policies
■
Publish forms, maps, or charts that are nonsensitive
Level 2
A Level 2 C&A requires a basic review and analysis of the security of the
information system.A Level 2 C&A requires everything included in a Level 1,
plus a full set of C&A documents, and a Security Test & Evaluation (ST&E),
(but not test results). Security policies must be clearly deﬁned and imple-
mented. If an agency requires something different than what I recommend
here, you should defer to the agency recommendations.
Information systems that typically may require a Level 2 C&A are infor-
mation systems that:
■
Are used for contracts, proposals, and legal proceedings
■
Are used for Capital budget applications
■
Serve ofﬁce applications
■
Operate beneﬁts management applications
■
Manage supply chain management transactions
Level 3
A Level 3 C&A requires a detailed review and analysis of the security of the
information system.A Level 3 C&A requires everything that is required in a
www.syngress.com
Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
77

Level 1 and 2 C&A, plus a network vulnerability scan, as well as tests that
show that have been correctly implemented security policies. Some agencies
may have different requirements for a Level 3 and you should always use the
agency guidelines and follow the recommendations in their handbook.
Information systems that typically may require a Level 3 C&A are infor-
mation systems that:
■
Monitor information or physical security
■
Manage operations of ﬁnancial transactions
■
Operate payroll management applications
■
Transmit intelligence information
■
Communicate information about dangerous substances
Level 4
A Level 4 C&A requires an extensive review and analysis of the security of
the information system.All items required for Levels 1, 2, and 3 are required
for a Level 4, plus a penetration test, and conﬁrmation that all security tests
were passed. Some agencies may have different requirements for a Level 4 and
just as with a Level 1, 2, or 3, you should always defer to the agency guidance.
Information systems that typically may require a Level 4 C&A are infor-
mation systems that:
■
Operate and monitor nuclear power plants
■
Make decisions on where to drop a bomb
■
Monitor a patient during surgery
■
Operate and monitor a large dam
■
Manage and operate mass transportation facilities
■
Monitor water quality and safety of public drinking water
■
Manage top secret Department of Defense projects
■
Prevent terrorist attacks
■
Perform large monetary transactions

Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

Importance of 
Determining the C&A Level
Determining the level of the Certiﬁcation Package up front is one of the
most often-overlooked parts of C&A.There are numerous organizations that
don’t perform this step until the entire Certiﬁcation Package has been devel-
oped, which is the absolute wrong way to go about this. One of the reasons
for determining the level up front is because the level determines what types
of information need to be included in the Certiﬁcation Package.The
Certiﬁcation Package is evidence that security risks have been understood
and mitigated properly.The higher level of Certiﬁcation that one seeks, the
more evidence is required. For example, network vulnerability scanning is
required for Level 3 Certiﬁcation, but not for Level 2. If you are seeking
Level 3 Certiﬁcation, you need to complete a network vulnerability scan and
address the resulting risks identiﬁed and include this information as part of
the Certiﬁcation Package.
Don’t Make This Mistake
The biggest mistake you can make in categorizing the Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, and Availability of your data is to over-classify it.Agencies do this all
the time, thinking that by over-classifying the data, the information system
owners are protecting themselves. Classifying data one way or another does
not increase the security of it. It is the controls that you apply to the data that
increase its security and preserve Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
Most information system owners and systems administrators seem to think
that their data’s importance is greater than the importance it actually holds in
real life. Upon ﬁrst consideration, most people will assume that their data is
mission critical. It seems that if information system owners claim that their
data is mission critical, they feel that they are covering themselves in the event
that something goes awry—they told everyone it was mission critical so if an
incident occurs it is not their fault. However, overstatement of data classiﬁca-
tion could actually lead to unforeseen investigations, and disciplinary action
for the information system owner, if a security incident really does occur. For
example, if data should be protected at the highest Conﬁdentiality, Integrity,
www.syngress.com
Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
79

and Availability levels, then that means that the most stringent security con-
trols should be applied to it. If a security incident occurs for data that was
characterized by the highest Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability ratings,
and it is discovered that the security controls that were put in place were
minimal, there could be egregious consequences in an investigation or audit.
Auditors may wonder why more stringent security controls were not applied,
or they may wonder why the data was characterized to be of such high
importance if that is not the case after all.
Furthermore, C&A is an expensive process and the expense goes up as the
C&A level goes up. If you do not need to C&A your information system at
Level 3, then don’t. Obtaining a Level 3 C&A will cost more, and take longer,
than a Level 2 C&A. It will also be harder to obtain.You want your C&A
level to be just right—not too high and not too low—which is why you
need to understand how to ﬁgure out what level to select.The information
owner selects the level, and then gets approval on the recommended level
from the authorizing ofﬁcial.The auditors will evaluate your package at what-
ever level you submit it for.They do not tell you what level to select.
However, if you select the wrong level, and your documentation is not consis-
tent with the level selected, they may have questions you’ll have to answer,
which could hold up your Accreditation.
Under-classifying data should also be avoided. Data that is not used to
make critical decisions, and would have little impact if it were unavailable for
a period of time, should not require expensive and elaborate security systems.
C&A auditors typically are not concerned with OMB-300 budget audits;
however in the last year or so, many of GAO’s OMB-300 budget auditors
have started asking to see C&A documentation in order to understand if large
expenditures of monies on elaborate security implementations were indeed
necessary. (OMB-300 audits are audits performed to verify if government
funds were spent appropriately.)
Inconsistencies in your data classiﬁcation and your security controls raise
the brows of auditors. For example, an auditor may wonder, if your data has
such low requirements for Conﬁdentiality and Availability, why have you
implemented such grandiose encryption and PKI requirements? Or if your
data has such high requirements for Availability, why haven’t you implemented
highly available, fault-tolerant RAID systems? If your data has low
Conﬁdentiality,Availability, and Integrity requirements, why did you perform
www.syngress.com
80
Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

an exhaustive and expensive network vulnerability scan and penetration test?
You need to be able to justify everything to an auditor and the best way to
do that is to make sure that your decisions and statements are consistent with
your processes.
Criteria to Use 
for Determining the Levels
In order to determine the level at which your information should be certiﬁed
and accredited, there are seven criteria you should take into consideration:
■
Conﬁdentiality
■
Integrity
■
Availability
■
Interconnection State
■
Processing State
■
Complexity State
■
Mission Criticality
I am going to show you how to assign risk and impact levels to these
characteristics in order to determine what level at which to C&A your infor-
mation system. Some C&A programs may opt to use more than seven criteria
and may vary their risk ratings, however all C&A level determinations should
take a similar approach.
Conﬁdentiality, 
Integrity, and Availability
Preserving the Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability of your information
systems is one of the key objectives of FISMA. FIPS 199 helps you under-
stand how to categorize the Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability of your
information systems so you can take that information and determine a C&A
level.Another document that can help you understand how to properly cate-
gorize Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability is Special Publication 800-60
www.syngress.com
Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
81

(SP 800-60),V2.0,Volumes 1 and 2: Guide for Mapping Types of Information
Systems to Security Categories, June 2004, by NIST, available at
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-60/SP800-60V1-ﬁnal.pdf.
SP 800-60 describes many different information types and presents rec-
ommendations (Low, Moderate, High) for each of their Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, and Availability sensitivities.The different information types listed
are spread over 15 Operational Areas and include both Services Delivery
Support Information and Government Resource Management Information. If
you are unsure of how to categorize Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability
for the different information types, I encourage you to review this well-
thought-out guide.
Conﬁdentiality
According to FIPS 199, Conﬁdentiality is a legal term deﬁned as:
…preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure,
including means for protecting personal privacy and propri-
etary information…
Legal terms aside, Conﬁdentiality means that people who are not sup-
posed to see sensitive data don’t end up seeing it. Conﬁdentiality can be
breached in numerous ways, including shoulder surﬁng, capturing network
packets with a protocol analyzer (sometimes referred to as “snifﬁng”), cap-
turing keystrokes with a keystroke logger, social engineering, or dumpster
diving. Conﬁdentiality can also be breached completely accidentally, for
example, if systems administrators accidentally conﬁgure an application such
that people who are not supposed to see the data have login access to it.
Conﬁdentiality typically is preserved through use of the following 
techniques:
■
Encryption
■
Roles-based access control (RBAC)
■
Rules-based access controls
■
Classifying data appropriately
■
Proper conﬁguration management

Training end-users and systems administrators
Determining the Conﬁdentiality Level
In determining the proper level at which to certify and accredit your infor-
mation system, you need to determine what impact a breach of
Conﬁdentiality of the data would have on your organization. If the impact of
disclosure would be of little consequence, the rating of Low should be
selected. If the impact of disclosure to the wrong individuals would be disas-
trous, the rating of High should be selected. If the impact of adverse disclo-
sure would be somewhere between Low and High, the rating of Moderate
should be selected.
For example, data that is to be made publicly available on the Web would
have a Low Conﬁdentiality rating. Data that should be viewed by only a very
small group of people, where disclosure to the unauthorized viewers would
have critical consequences, would require a High degree of Conﬁdentiality.
Data that should be viewed by an intermediate amount of users, that would
have a moderate adverse effect if it were disclosed to the wrong individuals,
would have a Moderate Conﬁdentiality rating.
When considering impact of disclosure, it helps if the data within your orga-
nization has a classiﬁcation scheme. If it does, you can create numerical weights
based on the data classiﬁcation scheme that are somewhat more speciﬁc than the
assignments of High, Medium, or Low.Table 7.1 offers a recommended
approach to assigning Conﬁdentiality levels according to data classiﬁcation.

Integrity
Like Conﬁdentiality, Integrity is also a legal term deﬁned by FIPS 199 and
reads as follows:
…means guarding against improper information modiﬁcation
or destruction, and includes ensuring information nonrepudi-
ation and authenticity…
Preserving the Integrity of the data ensures that the information is reliable
and has not been altered either by unauthorized users, or processes gone awry.
After all, if data is not accurate, it is of little use and in fact can be detrimental
if it is being used to make decisions where lives are at stake.Attackers may
attempt to purposely alter data, but systems administration errors and sloppy
programming can also create data that contains the wrong information. If
input variables in programs are not checked for memory bounds, buffer over-
ﬂows can occur, which have the potential to alter good data.
Integrity often is preserved through the same techniques you use to pre-
serve Conﬁdentiality. However, additional techniques that help ensure that
Integrity of data is left in tact are:
■
Perimeter network protection mechanisms
■
Host-based intrusion prevention systems
■
Network-based intrusion detection systems
■
Protection against viruses and other malware
■
Physical security of the information systems
■
Adherence to secure coding principles
■
Backups and off-site storage
■
Contingency management planning
Determining the Integrity Level
Similar to determining the Conﬁdentiality level, when you determine the
Integrity level, you need to determine what impact a loss of data Integrity
would have on your organization. If the impact of unauthorizzed data modiﬁ-
www.syngress.com
84
Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

cation would be of little consequence, select the Low rating. If the impact of
unauthorized data modiﬁcation would be disastrous, select the High rating. If
the impact of adverse and unauthorized data modiﬁcation would be some-
where between Low and High, you should select Moderate.
Remember, loss of Integrity means that the data has been modiﬁed
through unauthorized channels, either on purpose or by accident. If it is a
company calendaring application that has its Integrity breached, this will not
have anywhere near the same consequences as if it were a patient’s medical
record in a Veteran’s Hospital.A breach of Integrity on a patient’s medical
record could have life or death consequences and a serious adverse affect.
Integrity levels should be assigned based on a scale that is indicative of risk
to Integrity loss.Table 7.2 offers a recommended approach to assigning
Integrity levels according to risk associated with data Integrity compromises.

Availability
FIPS 199 stipulates the legal deﬁnition of Availability to be:
…means ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of
information.
Not all data have the same requirements for Availability. Data that has an
impact on human lives needs to have its Availability ensured at higher levels
than data that is intended for trivial purposes (e.g., the cafeteria lunch menu).
Data that has high Availability requirements needs more elaborate safeguards
and controls to ensure that Availability is not compromised. Data that has low
Availability requirements may need no safeguards or controls.

Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
85

Determining the Availability Level
In determining Availability, you need to understand how urgent it is (or not),
that the data exists in its everyday state. What would happen if the data were
to become unavailable for a period of time? Would the unavailability of the
data prevent critical decisions to be made? Would human lives become at
stake? Would anyone even notice or care? Some C&A experts claim that risks
to Availability should be concerned only with security, and not performance.
However, security vulnerabilities often are exploited through attacks on per-
formance, and therefore, I believe that taking performance into consideration
is important. If a denial of service attack prevents data from becoming avail-
able due to degradation in system performance, it would be prudent to con-
sider the performance impact caused by the attack on security.Table 7.3 offers
an approach to assigning a numerical weight to the impact of a loss on
Availability.

How to Categorize Multiple Data Sets
If you are planning to certify and accredit multiple applications together, or
applications for multiple lines of business or multiple operational areas, you
will need to do some additional work to ﬁgure out your Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, and Availability scores. However, it is much more efﬁcient to C&A
multiple applications together, and multiple lines of business together, than to
develop two entirely separate C&A packages.
First you ﬁgure out the Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability qualita-
tive ratings individually for each application, line of business, or operational
area. Once you have done that, you put the ﬁnal scores for each of the indi-
vidual areas into a summary table.The different individual areas may have dif-
www.syngress.com
86
Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

ferent scores for Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability. However, your
C&A package needs to be geared toward one level.To obtain the ﬁnal
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability rating, you will want to select the
highest rating in all categories and use that one. For example, if you have
three lines of business, and they have Conﬁdentiality ratings of High,
Moderate, and Low, you will select High for your ﬁnal Conﬁdentiality rating.
Table 7.4 shows a sample table of multiple Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability data sets.

Figuring out Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability using the approach
I have just described is the ideal way to ﬁgure Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability scores if you have different departments that share the same server.
You certainly will not want to put together three different Certiﬁcation
Packages for the same server. Due to the large amount of time and resources
it takes to put together a Certiﬁcation Package, you want to cover as many
information technology assets in one package as you can.
Impact Levels and System Criticality
FIPS 199 summarizes the characterization of Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability according to adverse impact in the event of a security incident.
Low, Moderate, or High impacts are described by FIPS 199 as indicated in
Table 7.5.The levels of impact described in Table 7.5 are consistent with the
www.syngress.com
Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
87

data classiﬁcation levels for Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability that we
have already discussed.
Table 7.5 Summary of FIPS 199 Levels of Impact
Level of Impact Description from FIPS 199
Low
The potential impact is low if the loss of Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, or Availability could be expected to have a limited
adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational
assets, or individuals.
Moderate
The potential impact is moderate if the loss of
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability could be expected to
have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations,
organizational assets, or individuals.
High
The potential impact is high if the loss of Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, or Availability could be expected to have a severe
or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations,
organizational assets, or individuals.
What is important in following these guidelines is being able to justify the
rationale behind selecting the category of Low, Moderate, or High for your
information system. Questions that you will want to ask the in-house subject
matter experts to help you determine the Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability impact levels are:
■
Do these information systems perform operations that put human
lives at stake?
■
Is the data read-only data?
■
Does the data constitute executable programs?
■
Who are the stakeholders of the data?
■
If the data disappeared completely and forever what would be the
impact?
■
If the data disappeared for one hour what would be the impact?
■
If the data disappeared for one day what would be the impact?
■
Does the information system connect to any other systems or 
networks?

Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

The ﬁnal Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability rating that you calcu-
late to summarize all the systems in your C&A package is called the Security
Proﬁle (see Table 7.6).

System Attribute Characteristics
Aside from Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability, there are four other
system attributes that should be taken into consideration to determine your
C&A level.Those four attributes are known as the Interconnection State, the
Processing State, the Complexity State, and Mission Criticality. By assigning
numerical risk levels to these attributes and tallying up the totals, you can
reﬁne your security characteristics and justify your C&A level.
Interconnection State (Interfacing Mode)
The interconnection state often is referred to as the interfacing mode in agency
documents, and refers to the connections the information system has to other
networks, devices, databases, and systems. I prefer the terminology “intercon-
nection state” because it is more descriptive and less cryptic than interfacing
mode. Many security experts do not know what interfacing mode means without
doing further research. If you see interfacing mode in C&A publications put out
by federal agencies, what the terminology refers to is the state of the inter-
connections of the different network components, and you should think of
this as the same thing as the interconnection state.
To understand what the interconnection state is, let’s take into considera-
tion a security incident. If a security incident occurred, would the incident be
contained within the single information system or would it perpetrate out to
other systems? In understanding the interconnection state, you need to deter-
mine if risks can be contained.To determine if the risks can be contained,
www.syngress.com
Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
89

you need to know if the interconnection of network devices are nonexistent,
passive, or active.A nonexistent interconnection state would indicate no phys-
ical or logical connections.A passive interconnection state would indicate log-
ical or physical connections that are tightly controlled. For example, a system
may be set up to receive only certain types of data on certain ports.An active
interconnection state would indicate a direct, and relatively open, interaction
with other systems, data structures, and networks.
Clearly there is more risk associated with an active interconnection state,
less risk with a passive interconnection state, and no risk with a nonexistent
interconnection state.Although some C&A programs may assign other
numerical weights to these interconnection states, I recommend that the
weights that appear in Table 7.7 be used.

Access State (Processing Mode)
The access state of your information system refers to the complexity by
which data is accessed, transmitted, and stored.The access state often is
referred to as the processing mode in agency C&A documents. However, I
believe that processing mode is misleading because what we are really trying to
determine is the level of user access.To understand the access state, take into
consideration the level of approvals necessary to access the data. How many
technical security controls and conﬁguration parameters are implemented and
manipulated in order to grant access? You need to determine the number of
different levels of user privileges and the complexity of conﬁguring and
implementing those access states.Table 7.8 offers guidelines for assigning
weights to the access state.

Accountability State (Attribution Mode)
Accountability state refers to how accountable you need your information
system to be.This information state often is referred to in agency C&A docu-
ments as the attribution mode. However, the terminology attribution mode is
again cryptic—no one knows what it means and it’s time to replace it with
more descriptive terminology.The terminology “accountability state” is less
confusing.To understand accountability state, you need to take into considera-
tion the complexity of accountability required to identify, validate, audit, and
monitor system entities and conﬁgurations. Does the system undergoing C&A
require simple or complex audit mechanisms? Are intrusion detection or
intrusion prevention systems required? Do security events need to be corre-
lated with a security information management (SIM) console? How many
places should data be stored in? How many monitoring systems do you need?
Do you need monitoring systems in multiple geographic locations? To deter-
mine the complexity state, it is worth considering who the stakeholders are
for the data. Is it the president of the United States? Or are the stakeholders
data entry clerks? Find out who the data stakeholders are and what they are
using the data for.You may need to interview the stakeholders, the devel-
opers, and the information system owner in order to ﬁnd out what they are
using the data for.
To determine the complexity of the accountability required by the infor-
mation system, I have set up a scale, depicted in Table 7.9. Make a qualitative
decision based on information that you obtain from the stakeholders, the
information system owner, and the developers.

Mission Criticality
One way of gauging the importance of an information system is to understand
how critical that particular information system is to your business. How reliant is
your business on the information system that is up for C&A? There are four cat-
egories of reliance that you should try to align your information system with:
■
No reliance
■
Cursory reliance
■
Partial reliance
■
Complete reliance
The information system owner should have a good idea of the mission
criticality of the information system that is up for C&A. I caution against
interviewing the end users of the information system on mission criticality
because they often give exaggerated viewpoints on mission criticality.You
should verify the information system owner’s viewpoint with the in-house
developers and subject matter experts.Table 7.10 offers recommendations on
how to weight mission criticality.

Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

Determining Level of Certiﬁcation
The way to determine the C&A level is to assign scores to the seven informa-
tion system attributes that you have taken into consideration and then add
them up. Based on the weights in the preceding sections, the scale that I rec-
ommend for determining your C&A Level is:
■
Level 1: < 16
■
Level 2: 12–32
■
Level 3: 24–44
■
Level 4: 38–50

is Level 2.
Note that there is a discretionary area where the weighting overlaps.The
discretionary overlap has been set up by design in case there are unusual cir-
cumstances where you may need to make a professional judgment call. If the
total weighting falls into a discretionary area, you really have a choice of
which level to select. Whichever level you select, if the weighting falls into a
discretionary area, you should also include a justiﬁcation and description of
why you selected the higher or lower of the two levels.
Template for Levels of Determination
I have developed a structure and framework that you can use as a template for
authoring a C&A Levels of Determination document.You may need to modify
certain sections of this to meet the unique requirements of your agency or
organization.

Introduction
Federal and <Agency Name> policies require two separate but parallel
and interrelated security determinations for every <Agency Name> informa-
tion system.An information system shall be construed as either a general sup-
port system, or an application.
Federal policy mandates that every federal information system be assigned
a “Security Proﬁle,” which assesses three aspects of its operations:
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Each of these three aspects is to be
categorized as being of Low, Moderate, or High sensitivity.The documents
that provide guidance for this categorization are the following.
■
The Federal Information Processing Publications Standard (FIPS)
199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems, December 2003, mandates the determination of
the Security Proﬁle for each Federal IS.

Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

Rationale for the 
Security Level Recommendation
FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems, December 2003, requires that a new federal information
system be categorized in three aspects of its operations: Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, and Availability. Each aspect is to be categorized as having Low,
Moderate, or High sensitivity.These three determinations are referred to col-
lectively as the information system’s Security Proﬁle.
NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information Systems to Security
Categories,Volumes I and II, assists in the application of FIPS 199 by providing
guidance based on the degree of impact that would result from the loss or
misuse of an information system or its data.
<Name of organization authoring this document> conducted interviews
with <information system name> representatives <names of subject matter
experts> in <date range>.These interviews established that, of the
<number> Information Types that were identiﬁed, only <number> are appli-
cable to <name of information system>: <names of Information Types>.

Process and Rationale 
for the C&A Level Recommendation
The <Agency Name> Certiﬁcation and Accreditation Program Handbook, <publica-
tion date> pages <numbers> presents the process for determining the C&A
Level for <Agency Name> information systems.This process involves
assessing the information system in seven distinct characteristics. Each charac-
teristic is assessed at one of a speciﬁed set of possible weights; the C&A Level
is then determined by the total of the accumulated weights.Table 7.14 sum-
marizes this process, indicating the seven information system characteristics,
the set of possible weights for each, and the weights recommended by <name
of organization authoring this document>.

information system>.As a rationale for these recommendations, each of the
seven characteristics is considered individually.
■
Interconnection State. <name of information system> <intercon-
nects, doesn’t interconnect> closely with other information systems.
Thus, the <nonexistent, passive, or active> weight is appropriate.
■
Access State. <name of information system> users will be
restricted to processing only <data processing restrictions>.They will
be further restricted in their operations by <roles, policies, rules>
assigned to them by <administrative group>.There <is a, is no>
requirement for mandatory access controls or data labeling, so the

the <All Users, Few Users, Need to Know Only, Select Users> Access State
weight is appropriate.

Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

■
Accountability State. <name of information system> <requires,
doesn’t require> detailed recording of certain types of processing.
<Most, Some, Few> of these needs are satisﬁed by <process name>
mechanisms that are already an inherent feature of the <name of
information system>. Speciﬁc security auditing is needed for cap-
turing <event type, e.g., authentication, monitoring> security-rele-
vant events such as <example>.Thus the <None, Rudimentary,
Comprehensive, Sophisticated> weight is appropriate.
■
Mission Criticality. In interviews conducted by <name of organi-
zation authoring this document>, <names of subject matter experts>
stated that the <name of information system> <is, is not> ofﬁcially
deemed as either essential or critical to the missions of <information
system owner department name>. Since the <name of information
system> <is, is not> essential to the mission of <information system
owner department name> the <None, Cursory, Partial, Complete>
weight is appropriate.
■
Availability. The <user group> are required to exchange informa-
tion with the <user group> in a <timely, periodic, infrequent>
manner and the <name of information system> is an integral part of
the reporting cycle. <Information system owner department name>
and the <user group> have agreed, however, that it is sufﬁcient to
keep these systems available on a <high priority, best effort, infre-
quent> basis, and provide backups for certain critical elements and
sites such as <name of critical elements> and <name of critical
sites>.The <When Time Permits, Soon,ASAP, Permanent> weight is
therefore appropriate for characterizing Availability.
■
Integrity. The data contained in the <name of information system>
is supplied by <source of data> and is monitored <constantly, peri-
odically, never> by both <responsible party> in the normal course of
their missions. Furthermore, the <name of information system> data
is routinely subject to <detailed and extensive, comprehensive and
periodic, cursory and infrequent> auditing to detect accidental or
malicious manipulation.The Integrity characteristic can thus be
assessed as <Not Applicable,Approximate, Exact>.
www.syngress.com
Determining the Certiﬁcation Level • Chapter 7
101

■
Conﬁdentiality. <name of information system> data <is, is not>
classiﬁed and is, in essence, <publicly, not publicly> available.
Therefore, the weight of <Unclassiﬁed, Sensitive But Unclassiﬁed,
Conﬁdential, Secret,Top Secret, Compartmented / Special Access> is 
appropriate.
Using this process and recommended weights, the <information system>
has a total accumulated weight of <number> points.This places it into Level
<number>.
Based on these assessments, <name of organization authoring this docu-
ment> recommends that the <name of information system> be Certiﬁed and
Accredited at Level <number>. <If you decide to assign a level that is discre-
tionary, e.g., Level 30, put the justiﬁcation for your decision here.>
The Explanatory Memo
Once a C&A Level of Determination Recommendation has been developed, the
information owner needs to submit a memo to the authorizing ofﬁcial that
summarizes and supports the C&A Level of Determination Recommendation.The
ISSO should review the memo before the information system owner signs it
and submits it.The authoring ofﬁcial is supposed to acknowledge the letter
with a signature and then return it to the information system owner. If the
authorizing ofﬁcial will not accept the recommended C&A level, then the
Levels of Determination will need to be revised until it has been found to be
acceptable.The authorizing ofﬁcial should respond back to the information
system owner during the initial phase of the C&A project so that the folks
preparing the Certiﬁcation Package will know at which level the package
should be prepared.Although the memo does not have to be in any particular
format, I have provided a template to help you understand what to include.

Chapter 7 • Determining the Certiﬁcation Level

Summary
Determining the certiﬁcation level for the system for which you are devel-
oping a C&A package can be the step that is most often performed incor-
rectly. System owners frequently feel that if they simply overclassify the
sensitivity of the system that they are responsible for, thereby holding it to
more stringent standards of security, they will ensure that it is secured prop-
erly. However, implementing unnecessary security controls and performing a
Level 3 C&A on a system that only needs a Level 2 C&A waste time and
money.This does not make good business sense.
Therefore, it is your job to make sure you fully understand the certiﬁca-
tion levels and the requirements for each.You must also have a good under-
standing of the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability security objectives; be
able to evaluate the sensitivity of each with regards to a particular system; and
to elicit accurate and thorough information from the system owner on which
this evaluation will be based.
Once you gather the information and make the determination about the
certiﬁcation level to be used, you must codify this in a formal document that
will be included in the ﬁnal C&A package.An example of the explanatory
memo has been provided, but you should see if a template is already in use at
your agency. Use this to get ﬁnal signed approval of the certiﬁcation level you
calculated for the information system. Once you have this in writing from the
information owner, you have a clear picture of the level of effort required

Introduction
Most agencies require a security self-assessment only in the off years when
C&A packages are not required for submission. Performing a security self-
assessment is a process by which an agency or organization determines the
current security posture of their information systems and infrastructure.A
self-assessment helps give you a level of assurance as to how well the manage-
ment, operational, and technical security controls are working. One of the
best guides in how to perform a security self-assessment is Special Publication
800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems,
November 2001, by the National Institute of Standards.
A security self-assessment is a survey-based audit that is essentially a long
list of questions.The survey should be designed to be consistent with the
requirements set forth in the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual
(FISCAM), January 1999. GAO auditors and agency inspector generals use
FISCAM when reviewing the agency security program including the C&A
program. FISCAM is available on the GOA Web site at the following URL:
www.gao.gov/special.pubs/ai12.19.6.pdf.
FISCAM includes a signiﬁcant amount of information on how to audit
ﬁnancial systems.Though following FISCAM guidelines for ﬁnancial systems is
certainly meritorious, for C&A we are more concerned with information tech-
nology than with ﬁnancial statements. However, as far as audits go, many of the
same principles used for ﬁnancial audits apply also to information technology
audits and in that regard, the FISCAM guidance is certainly applicable.
Special Publication 800-26 is a 95-page document, and FISCAM is a 298-
page document. I mention the length of pages to give you an idea of how
much there is to actually know about self-assessments. I don’t plan on trying
to recreate either of these well-written documents here. My objective is to
give you a condensed version that offers practical applicability.

A self-assessment is a high-level, 30,000 foot-up type of security audit.The
survey should be designed to cover a broad range of requirements that are
related to the management, technical, and operational controls of the infor-

mation system. It’s often the case that a particular survey question could fall
into more than one of these three categories. Don’t spend a long time delib-
erating which category each question should go in. Pick whatever category
seems appropriate for the particular information systems that are up for C&A
and simply put the survey question there. It’s more important simply to ask
the right questions and discover the honest answers, than to ﬁgure out which
category of the survey the question should go in.
Designing the Survey
Before you start to design a self-assessment survey, check to see if your agency
has a self-assessment template that already exists that they would like you to
use. Since you’re probably under a deadline, don’t recreate a brand-new self-
assessment survey if a pretty good one already exists at your agency.Also, it
may be against the agency security policies to use a survey that is different
than the one they provide. If your agency does not have a self-assessment
survey template, you will need to develop one before you can answer the
questions. Special Publication 800-26 contains a fairly comprehensive sample
survey and it’s a great starting point for developing one for your Certiﬁcation
Package.You’ll likely want to modify the survey you ﬁnd in Special
Publication 800-26 to make it more apropos to the objectives of your agency
and information system.
Special Publication 800-26 recommends that your survey be designed for
ﬁve levels of compliance. However, since almost every C&A program includes
four levels of compliance, from a practical standpoint, it makes more sense to
build four levels of compliance into your survey.The recommendation for ﬁve
levels of compliance originated from a document published on November 28,
2000 known as the Federal Information Technology Security Assessment Framework
(FITSAF).1 Since most C&A programs have only four levels of compliance, it
is possible that if the FITSAF had been published after FISMA was passed, it
may have included only four levels of compliance.
Levels of Compliance
To keep things simple, I suggest referring to the levels of compliance on your
survey simply as L1, L2, L3, and L4.These levels of compliance should be
www.syngress.com
Performing and Preparing the Self-Assessment • Chapter 8
109

consistent with the C&A levels that I previously described in Chapter 6. We
refer to each question of the survey simply as a control.The compliance levels
are simply boxes to check off next to the survey question, and should be
interpreted as follows:
■
L1 indicates the security control is written into policy
■
L2 indicates that the security control is implemented
■
L3 indicates that the security control is tested
■
L4 indicates that the security control has passed all tests and is tightly
integrated
Each compliance level includes the requirements from the prior level. It
makes it very easy to understand at which C&A level your information sys-
tems are able to be certiﬁed if you design your self-assessment this way. Keep
in mind that even if your information systems can be certiﬁed and accredited
at a higher level, and each control item complies up to L4, that doesn’t mean
that you should certify and accredit your information systems at the highest
level.As already discussed, you should never certify and accredit your infor-
mation system at a level higher than what is necessary.Table 8.1 illustrates a
commonly used format for self-assessment survey questions.

performed on a regular basis?
A checkmark in the L1 box indicates that there is a security policy that
requires the control to exist, and a checkmark in the L2 box indicates that the
control has been implemented.A checkmark in the L3 box indicates that tests
have been performed on the implementation, and a checkmark in the L4 box
indicates that all tests have been passed and that the control is tightly inte-
grated into the information system.You’re probably wondering what is meant
by “tightly integrated.”Tight integration is a somewhat nebulous term, and to
be sure, although NIST and many security experts use this terminology com-
monly, there is no one agreed upon deﬁnition for what it means. My recom-
www.syngress.com
110
Chapter 8 • Performing and Preparing the Self-Assessment

mendation is that tight integration is something that you can justify through
evidence and demonstration in one of the following ways:
■
Automated technical features
■
A strict change control process
■
A robust conﬁguration management process
■
An online workﬂow process that includes levels of approvals and
sign-offs
For example, if a network vulnerability assessment is performed automati-
cally on a regular basis, according to a published schedule, it may qualify as
“implemented” in compliance with L2 requirements. If all vulnerabilities are
mitigated each time an automated network vulnerability assessment occurs,
you could then claim that risk assessments are performed on a regular basis up
to compliance level L4. If a network vulnerability assessment is performed
now and then, but not on any regular schedule, and known vulnerabilities are
recorded but not immediately mitigated, you could claim that risk assessments
are in compliance with level L3. If network vulnerability assessments are
required to be completed, and one is scheduled to occur but hasn’t occurred
yet, then you could claim that the information system was in compliance up
to level L2. If there was simply a policy that existed for network vulnerability
assessments to be completed, whether any vulnerability assessments were actu-
ally completed or not, you could justiﬁably claim your information system is
in compliance with level L1.
Management Controls
The survey questions should be designed to discover the truths about the
management controls and should be focused on the following key areas:
■
Risk mitigation
■
Reporting and review by management
■
System lifecycle requirements
■
Security planning
www.syngress.com
Performing and Preparing the Self-Assessment • Chapter 8
111

■
Security oversight
■
Documentation for managers
You want the survey questions to uncover how well the management
team complies with agency security policies, and how well they manage and
oversee the operational and technical controls. Management is about bud-
geting, tracking, reporting, communications, accountability, and analysis.
Questions surrounding security management controls should be designed
with these elements in mind.
Operational Controls
Operational controls focus on processes and procedures that are implemented
by people.The survey questions surrounding the operational controls should
be geared toward ﬁnding out if the processes and procedures designed to con-
trol security work as planned.The discoveries made from responses to opera-
tional survey questions should be concerned with how well the people who
administer the systems carry out their daily duties. Survey questions related to
operational security controls should be focused on the following key areas:
■
Personnel security
■
Physical and environmental operations and safeguards
■
Administration and implementation
■
Preventative maintenance
■
Contingency and disaster recovery planning
■
Training and security awareness
■
Incident response procedures
■
Preservation of data integrity (antivirus, intrusion detection, etc.)
■
Network and system security operations
■
Documentation for operational staff
An important part of surveying operational controls is to ﬁnd out if there
is a clear separation of duties between the different administrative roles. In
general, duties should be separated so that access to operations is available
www.syngress.com
112
Chapter 8 • Performing and Preparing the Self-Assessment

according to the principle of least privilege—users should be given no more
privileges than absolutely necessary to do their jobs.
Preservation of data integrity and confidentiality issues should be inves-
tigated by questions regarding operational controls.As one example, data
integrity questions should be designed to find out how antivirus programs
are managed.An example of confidentiality questions would include those
questions designed to find out about background checking processes for key
personnel.
Technical Controls
Technical controls refer to the security safeguards that are built into the infor-
mation systems. Survey questions should be designed to ﬁnd out the status of
the built-in technical controls.The type of information that you are trying to
uncover is to ﬁnd out if technical controls exist, and if they do, whether they
are effective.
The key areas that technical controls focus on are:
■
Authentication and identity veriﬁcation
■
Logical access controls
■
Secure conﬁgurations
■
Interconnectivity security
■
Audit mechanisms
If a Security Self-Assessment has been designed to ﬁt all the information sys-
tems in a particular agency, it will likely be the case that some of the ques-
tions designed for technical control assurances will not be applicable. Not all
information systems will require the same types of technical controls.
Correlation with Security Policies and Laws
When putting together the self-assessment, it can be helpful to have agency
security policies and federal guidance that require the controls, to be listed
with the question.An example of this is shown in Table 8.2. Controls that are
required by FISCAM and OMB Circulars will be items that GAO inspectors
will look for during an audit. Controls that are required by the agency are of
interest to the agency OIG auditors. Guidance from NIST is also worth citing
www.syngress.com
Performing and Preparing the Self-Assessment • Chapter 8
113

for reference purposes. OMB Circular A-130 often is used as guide for devel-
oping the self-assessment questions.
Answering the Questions
Once a survey is developed, it needs to be completed.You will need to inter-
view the developers, subject matter experts, and management team in order to
ﬁnd out the answers to the questions. Interviews can be performed either in
person or electronically.There are many nice survey tools that can be imple-
mented that are designed to collect this information through a Web portal. It’s
often the case that some of the survey respondents may be in disparate geo-
graphic locations. By setting up the survey through a Web portal, you can
simply send out an e-mail asking the required participants to login and
answer the questions. Many of the online survey tools offer roll-up scores and
advanced graphs that allow you to see which control areas require more
attention.As organizations reﬁne their self-assessment methodology, imple-
menting the survey via an online portal is really the way to go.

mation designed for agency or organizational self-improvement. Respondents
to the questions should not be made to feel guilty if a particular area is not in
compliance.You want the respondents to give honest answers. It is very
important that respondents understand up front that no negative repercussions
will occur as a result of their answers. If honest answers are not provided on
the self-assessment, it becomes useless.
In May of 2000, the Department of Energy released a report2 regarding
various security incidents that had occurred at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. It was discovered that respondents to security self-assessments
answered survey questions purposefully incorrectly because they felt pressured
to give the “right” answer as opposed to the truthful answer.As a result, var-
ious security vulnerabilities were never discovered, and so nothing was ever
done to mitigate them. Since the security vulnerabilities were never miti-
gated, security incidents occurred that exploited the vulnerabilities. Not only
is it unethical to intimidate self-assessment respondents into answering the
questions untruthfully, it defeats the purpose of the exercise.
Similar to what happened at Los Alamos, in September of 2003, a report3
put out by the Ofﬁce of Inspector General at the Environmental Protection
Agency found that 36 percent of the responses to security self-assessments
contained inaccurate information. Submission of inaccurate security self-
assessments is a known problem.The intent of a self-assessment is for the
ISSO and information system owner to use the self-assessment surveys inter-
nally, though auditors may try to ﬁnd out if the information contained in
them is accurate.As more attention is being cast on inaccurate security self-
assessments, scrupulous auditors will be spending more time trying to verify
the accuracy of the information contained in them.Truthfulness conveys trust,
and if auditors discover that security self-assessments are not accurate, they
may scrutinize other parts of the Certiﬁcation Package more so than they
would otherwise.
TIP
Encourage self-assessment respondents to answer questions truthfully.

Performing and Preparing the Self-Assessment • Chapter 8

Evaluators may ask questions to try to ascertain if the ISSO and informa-
tion system owner actually use their own self-assessments to take corrective
actions. Presumably, if an information system owner ﬁnds out from the self-
assessment process that the vulnerabilities discovered do not warrant pursuing
C&A, an ethically upstanding information system owner would put the C&A
process on hold until proper mitigation of vulnerabilities occurs. Keep in
mind that information system owners do not need to wait until a C&A dead-
line is looming to conduct a security self-assessment. It is probably best to get
started on your self-assessment long before the three-year C&A deadline is
looming overhead.
Questions for Self-Assessment Survey
The list of questions in Tables 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 can be used to develop a
Security Self-Assessment.The questions are based on the recommendations set
forth in Special Publication 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information
Technology Systems,August 2001, by the National Institute of Standards.
However, additional questions and categories have been added to increase the
breadth of coverage. Some of the original rhetoric from NIST 800-26 has
been simpliﬁed and modiﬁed in order to provide clarity. For example, I have
changed NIST’s reference of “Personnel Security” to “User Trust” since
securing the personnel was never the intention. Some of the questions may
be found in categories different than the original NIST recommendations.
Federal laws and regulations, and NIST guidance are cited along with the rel-
evant questions in Tables 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5. If a particular question is not appli-
cable to your information system you can indicate that by inserting N.A. into
any of the right-hand columns.
Management security controls refer to security controls that are required
and reviewed through organizational accountability processes.

Summary
Although a formal C&A package attempts to assess and document the secu-
rity of an information system at a ﬁne level of detail and using rigorous veri-
ﬁcation and validation, a self-assessment is a less rigorous tool used to assess
the security of the information in the years between formal certiﬁcation and
accreditations. Instead of bringing in outside agents to assess the security of a
system, the self-assessment relies on people within the agency to perform the
assessment. Self-assessments should be questionnaires that cover a range of
technical, management, and operational controls that should be in place for
information systems, so although the assessment questions do not need to
replicate every control you would cover in a formal C&A, there should be
some overlap.This way, you end up with a C&A package that reﬂects an out-
side auditor’s assessment of the security for a system and a “gut check” per-
formed by agency personnel. Comparisons between the two evaluations can
then be drawn.

Introduction
All Certiﬁcation Packages that are Level 2 and above require a Security
Awareness and Training Plan.The Security Awareness and Training Plan has to
include accurate information about training that has taken place in the past,
and any training that will take place in the future. Probably one of the most
oft-overlooked pieces of a security program, security awareness and training is
paramount to improving your agency’s security posture.A Security Awareness
and Training Plan is simply a documented description of the security awareness
and training program.
In October 2003, the National Institute of Standards published1 recom-
mendations for security awareness and training programs.The document,
informally known as NIST Special Publication 800-50, describes four critical
elements that all security awareness and training programs should include:
1. Design and planning of the awareness and training program 
2. Development of the awareness and training materials 
3. Implementation of the awareness and training program 
4. Measuring the effectiveness of your program and updating it 
Purpose of Security 
Awareness and Training
Many end-users simply don’t understand how rampant security threats are.A
security awareness and training program forces end-users to become aware of
these threats. By participating in security awareness and training, end-users
come to realize that your agency cares about security.
Security awareness and training are two different things. Security aware-
ness refers to the marketing and promotion of security inside your agency.
Security awareness programs put in place signs, booklets, posters, and elec-
tronic reminders.Awareness programs serve as constant reminders that your
agency or organization takes information security seriously and are motiva-
tional in nature.

Chapter 9 • Addressing Security Awareness and Training Requirements

Security training refers to actual security coursework.The course can take
place in a classroom or via an online training program. Most users enjoy
having the opportunity to learn new things. By assisting users in increasing
their actual knowledge of security they will naturally use this knowledge to
help protect the enterprise infrastructure.Your best security stewards are really
your employees.Your employees use and administer the systems that need to
be secured.They understand how the systems are used, how they operate, and
know them more intimately than anyone else. Even though you can hire
expensive outside consultants to come in and secure your network, your
employees have invested more time in your organization, and will likely care
more about doing the right thing. By training your own employees, you
empower them to assist you in security certiﬁcation and accreditation.
Since there are practical limitations to the amount of employee time you
can take up, your information security and training program needs to be
keenly focused.The focus of your security awareness and training program
should be to protect the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of your
organization’s information.
Security Training
Security training should be mandatory for all end-users including contractors.
A written record of all training classes, and the users that participated in them,
should be documented and archived. By making security training mandatory,
end-users get the message that your agency is serious about security. If you
advise your end-users of your expectations in regards to security, you can
much more easily hold them accountable.
In implementing a training program, you need to take into consideration
your employee’s roles and responsibilities.There should be an overall basic
training course that all employees participate in, and you will want to give
advanced security training course to the personnel that have actual security
responsibilities.The following types of individuals should participate in at least
one or more advanced security training courses per year:
■
Information System Security Ofﬁcers
■
Network engineers
www.syngress.com
Addressing Security Awareness and Training Requirements • Chapter 9
141

■
Security engineers
■
System administrators
■
Chief Security Ofﬁcers
■
Mission assurance staff
To ﬁnd out how well the training programs are, it is a good idea to pre-
sent the employees with a quiz at the beginning and end of each course. If
the class is a good one, at the end of each course their score on the quiz
should be much higher than it was before they took the course.You should
also ask the employees to ﬁll out an evaluation of the course after it is over.
You’ll want to try to ﬁnd out how appropriate your employees felt the
training material was and if they thought the instructor understood the mate-
rial and was able to present it in a manner that was understandable.
Security Awareness
Reminders work and that’s what security awareness is about. However, secu-
rity awareness requires some management. For the system that is undergoing
C&A, the ISSO needs to ensure that awareness materials are made available.
The awareness material may be e-mail reminders, pamphlets, or even
tchotchkes. Security awareness materials should be attention getting.They need
to be prominently displayed in highly trafﬁcked areas. People notice awareness
materials more easily if they are colorful and pleasing to look at. If an auditor
walked through the user community ofﬁces, security awareness materials
should be in plain sight.
The Awareness and Training Message
Since information security is a very broad topic, you will clearly not be able
to train your employees in all aspects of it. Except for your information secu-
rity engineers and staff, most of your end users have much work to do that is
likely unrelated to security.Therefore, you need to selectively pick and choose
the security topics you want your users to learn about.You will want to hone
in on security topics that will have the greatest impact on improving the
security posture of your infrastructure. Make your employees aware of the
greatest threats, and how to most easily mitigate them.

Chapter 9 • Addressing Security Awareness and Training Requirements

Items that I recommend that you include in your security awareness and
training program are the following:
■
Ensure that your users have read and understood the ten most impor-
tant security policies.
■
Explain the dangers of social engineering and instruct your users
how you would like them to handle suspicious phone calls.
■
Advise your users to update their anti-virus software on daily basis.
Users should also be educated about the dangers of opening 
attachments.
■
Describe to your users what constitutes a safe password. Some users
may not realize how easy it is to launch dictionary attacks. Remind
users that good passwords include mixed-case characters and numbers.
■
Advise your users how they should report suspicious activity
including viruses, denial of service attacks, and possible break-ins.
■
Expectations for laptop security should be discussed. Should users
lock them in their desks if they leave their laptops in the ofﬁce
overnight? Are there any security requirements for laptops when
taken on business travel?
■
Expectations for handhelds should also be speciﬁed.Are users allowed
to connect them to the corporate network? What type of handheld is
allowed?
■
Personal ﬁrewall requirements should be discussed.Are they required
or optional? Which ones are supported and who do users call for
assistance with them?
■
The expectations for security patch installation on laptops and
desktop systems needs to be stated. Do users have to install and patch
their own systems? Where should they obtain the patches? Is the
patching process automated?
■
Explain any requirements for encryption.Are certain ﬁles supposed
to be stored only in an encrypted state? Does your agency allow the
use of algorithms that have not undergone FIPS 140-22 validation
testing?
www.syngress.com
Addressing Security Awareness and Training Requirements • Chapter 9
143

■
Personal use of laptops and desktops should be stated.Are employees
allowed to send personal e-mails from agency accounts?
Chances are your agency has unique security requirements for users. New
employees are joining the agency every day.Time goes by and people forget
what they learned last year.You need to enlist your users in training on a reg-
ular schedule.
Online Training Makes It Easy
With widespread use of intranets, most agencies will ﬁnd it easy to distribute
a basic security training course electronically.A good online training course
will quiz the user at the end of the course, and offer the user feedback on
missed questions. Some agencies require users to retake the course if they do
not achieve a certain threshold of correct answers.You’ll want an online
course to track the users who have logged on and completed it. Users should
be given a deadline to complete the course by a certain date, or have their
access removed.
Document Your Plan
Your Security Awareness and Training Plan is simply a document that describes
how security awareness and training works for the information system that is
undergoing C&A.Your plan might simply be a write-up that references a
broader agencywide plan. Or it may include reference to the agencywide plan
as well as a detailed description of speciﬁc security training requirements for a
unique application.
The fact that you are already doing excellent security awareness and
training is not enough.As far as C&A is concerned, if it is not documented, it
doesn’t exist.You need to indicate who is responsible for updating the plan,
and who is responsible for implementing security awareness and training ini-
tiatives. For example, who makes the security awareness posters? Is it done in-
house, or does your agency use an outside graphic design company? Who
puts up the posters? Who teaches the courses, and where are they held? If it
sounds simple, that’s because it is.

rity program, and a Security Awareness and Training Plan is required for Level 2
or higher C&A packages. In essence the training and awareness program
serves to facilitate and improve the C&A process and the overall security pos-
ture of the organization by disseminating important security information to
the units that support the organization’s day-to-day operations. Security
training needs to be targeted at the variety of audiences within that overall
group (such as developers, ISSOs, and the network operations support group),
and feedback from the individuals undergoing training helps to reﬁne and
improve the overall program.The methods by which the awareness and
training program will be executed need to be documented in the security
awareness and training plan.

Introduction
End-User Rules of Behavior are policies that your users agree to abide by before
they are allowed access to whatever it is that you are certifying and accred-
iting.Your End-User Rules of Behavior, and your plans for implementing them,
have to be clearly articulated in the Certiﬁcation Package.Although a Level 1
Certiﬁcation Package usually doesn’t require an ofﬁcial End-User Rules of
Behavior, it is still a good idea to put one into place if you have systems that
are processing sensitive information.
The End-User Rules of Behavior are the rules that end-users have to agree
to before they are allowed access to the information system. Clearly, end users
need to know what these rules of the road are before they can agree to them.
The agreement should be veriﬁed before giving the user access.All end users
of the information system being certiﬁed, including contractors, should agree
to the rules.
End users may already have access to the agency network, or have other
logins to other applications.Therefore, the rules of behavior should be unique
and speciﬁc to the information system that is being certiﬁed and accredited.
Just because an end user has agreed to the rules for other applications doesn’t
mean they have agreed to the rules for the application that is up for
Accreditation.
Implementing Rules of Behavior
The rules of behavior can be implemented either on a paper form or online.
In some cases where you are giving a user access to a general support system,
and they do not yet have an account at all, a paper form may be the only pos-
sibility. If a user already is set up on the enterprise network, and has a private
key from an internal Certiﬁcate Authority, you can have the user sign rules
for access to a new application with their private key.There are administrative
advantages to having users sign the rules online. By signing the rules online,
administrators can more easily track who has signed them. If paper forms are
used, they should be collected and archived in a central and secure place with
limited access.The ISSO for the information system that the rules apply to is

150
Chapter 10 • Addressing End-User Rules of Behavior

responsible for either keeping the rules secure, or designating an appropriate
staff person to store and secure them.
What Rules to Include
Each information system will require a unique set of rules, and rules that
apply to one system may not apply to another. Database systems may require
different rules than, say, an application for handhelds. Systems that process
ﬁnancial transactions may require an entirely different set of rules. Rules for a
desktop system and the enterprise network may be vastly different than, say,
rules for an Employee Resource Processing (ERP) system.
Although some rules are redundant because they simply agree to abide by
speciﬁc citations of the agency security policy, it is worth listing them to
emphasize their importance and to create an accountability log in the form of
a user signature.To help you understand the types of rules that should be
listed, some sample rules are listed in Tables 10.1 through 10.4.
Rules for Applications, Servers, and Databases
Different applications may require different rules.The rules in Table 10.1 can
be adapted to most applications, servers, and databases. Some rules from Tables
10.2 through 10.4 may also be apropos for applications, servers, and databases.
Table 10.1 Rules of Behavior for Applications

Consequences of Noncompliance
Somewhere in the rules of behavior, consequences for noncompliance should
be described. Possible consequences might be:
■
Disciplinary action (unspeciﬁed)
■
Mandatory security awareness training
■
A supervisory warning
■
Revocation of a security clearance
■
Termination
The noncompliance consequences should be well thought out. For
example, it may not be in the best interest of the agency to terminate key
personnel for leaving a paper document overnight on a printer. Each case of
noncompliance should be evaluated individually to determine the magnitude
of the risk to the agency.
Rules of Behavior Checklist
To ensure that your rules of behavior is deemed acceptable by auditors, use
the following checklist to ensure that you have not forgotten anything:
■
Have all users of the information system undergoing Certiﬁcation
signed a statement agreeing that they have read and understand the
rules of behavior?
www.syngress.com
Addressing End-User Rules of Behavior • Chapter 10
155

■
Are the consequences of noncompliance stated in the rules of
behavior?
■
Are signed rules of behavior archived?
■
Does the ISSO know where to ﬁnd the archived Rules of Behavior?
■
Are paper-based rules of behavior protected from ﬁre and ﬂood
threats?
■
Are the rules of behavior published in a place where they can be
reviewed by the end users after they have been previously agreed to? 
■
Are noncompliance breaches of rules of behavior treated as a security
incident?
■
If private keys are used for signing an online rules form, are the pri-
vate keys properly protected?
■
Are end users required to report if their private keys are lost or
stolen?
■
Have privileged users been identiﬁed?
Summary
End-User Rules of Behavior are important to any organization because they for-
mally sets the standards by which users are expected to conduct themselves.
These rules of behavior also set forth the consequences of noncompliance.
Without a document outlining rules of behavior, users cannot be held
accountable for their actions, making it impossible to expect that they are
employing basic principles of security while using the organization’s informa-
tion resources. End users need to be informed of the rules of behavior, and
they need to understand that by using the information system, they are
agreeing to abide by them.

Introduction
Although an Incident Response Plan is required only for certiﬁcations Level 2
and up, all IT organizations that take security seriously should have an
Incident Response Plan whether their systems are undergoing C&A or not.
When it comes to C&A, the goal of the Incident Response Plan is to describe
the incident response process by which the information system undergoing
C&A is required to abide.
Due to its unscheduled nature and its potential for damage, a security
incident can predispose an otherwise competent staff into immediate anxiety
and frustration.A well thought out Incident Response Plan helps retain order
and efﬁcient organizational processes during a stressful situation. Every
Incident Response Plan should contain certain key instructional elements and
the C&A audit team may fail your Incident Response Plan if any of these
elements are missing.Though your plan can include more information than
the required key elements, be sure at the very minimum to include a section
on each of the following:
■
Purpose and applicability
■
Policies and guidelines
■
Reporting framework
■
Roles and responsibilities
■
Deﬁnitions
■
Incident handling
■
Incident types
■
Incident reporting form
If time permits, you may also want to include information on how to
detect incidents and how to proceed with forensic investigations.
Purpose and Applicability
Even though it may seem obvious that your document should include a stated
purpose, it is important not to forget this section. If you don’t say what infor-
www.syngress.com
158
Chapter 11 • Addressing Incident Response

mation system(s) the Incident Response Plan is for, the C&A auditors could
come to the conclusion that an Incident Response Plan for the system that is
up for C&A does not exist.The name of the Incident Response Plan should
be consistent with the name of all the other document plans in your
Certiﬁcation Package, and it is a good idea to state the information system in
the document title. For example, if you are certifying and accrediting an
information system known as System ABC, make sure your Incident
Response Plan is titled Incident Response Plan for System ABC.
Policies and Guidelines
In the policies and guidelines section, you will want to cite the agency secu-
rity policies, standards, and guidelines that the incident response team follows
and adheres to.You should list the formal policy document names in their
entirety and where these documents can be found (e.g., the Web URL on the
agency intranet). Do not confuse policies with incident handling procedures.
The policies describe what the rules are, and the incident handling procedures
describe how to follow those rules. If your agency has an Incident Response
Manual or handbook, you will want to list this document as reference material
in this section.
You should also include any of the following federal mandates that you
follow:
■
The Ofﬁce of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, speci-
ﬁes that federal agencies will “Ensure there is a capability to provide
help to users when a security incident occurs in the system and to
share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats.”
■
Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP): Presidential Decision
Directive 63 (PDD-63) directs that each department and agency shall
develop plans for protecting its own critical infrastructure.
Accordingly, the <Agency Name> has created the <Agency Name>
CSIRC to provide a 24 X 7 single point of contact (POC) for com-
puter security incidents detected within the <Agency Name>.
www.syngress.com
Addressing Incident Response • Chapter 11
159

■
The <Agency Name> Security Manual <ofﬁcial document name>
directs the <Agency Name> and the <Agency Name> Inspector
General to establish a capability that will “serve as the ﬁrst tier of
incident response and the investigative and reporting body…” for the
<Agency Name>.
■
The CSIRC is sponsored by the <Agency Name> Deputy
Commissioner for Modernization and Chief Information Ofﬁcer and
is designed to be proactive in preventing, detecting, and responding
to computer security incidents targeting <Agency Name>’s enter-
prise Information Technology (IT) assets.
Reporting Framework
Your incident response reporting framework establishes who should be con-
tacted and the order in which escalation occurs. Depending on the agency
requirements, it may be necessary to establish timeframes for escalation. If
your agency does not require speciﬁc incident escalation timeframes, you can
still establish these thresholds in your Incident Response Plan if your informa-
tion system owner and ISSO require it.Timeframes for escalation often are
based on the severity of the incident and the extensiveness of the damage—
the more systems that are impacted, the more resources you will need to
resolve the incident.
Most federal agencies have a Computer Security Incident Response
Center (CSIRC).The agency CSIRC provides centralized incident response
services and coordinates incident response activities agencywide. In devel-
oping an Incident Response Plan for C&A, you’ll need to make sure that the
Incident Response Plan is consistent with the processes already established by
the CSIRC.The Incident Response Plan developed for the C&A package
does not replace the process already established by the CSIRC—it augments
it and embellishes it with the particulars relevant to the information system
undergoing C&A. Essentially, the Incident Response Plan for the C&A
package should be an extension of the agencywide incident response plan.
Agency CSIRCs are required to report signiﬁcant security incidents to
the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT).
www.syngress.com
160
Chapter 11 • Addressing Incident Response

However, before that occurs, the incident should be reported up through the
bureau, and agency CSIRC, as depicted in Figure 11.1.
Figure 11.1 C&A Incident Response Plan as an Extension of Agency CSIRC
It’s important to describe an escalation process in your Incident Response
Plan that uses your described response framework.An incident could occur at
night when some of the staff is unavailable, and sometimes people do not
respond to e-mail or cell phones.The person who detects the incident needs
to know who to report it to and how long to wait to escalate it if there is no
response. Even with a quick response, security policies may require your inci-
dent response team to escalate high impact incidents up through the escala-
tion framework according to particular time frames. If escalation time frames
are required by your security policy and C&A Handbook, be sure to include
them.

Roles and Responsibilities
In the roles and responsibilities section of the Incident Response Plan, you’ll
want to state speciﬁcally what the expected responsibilities are for the dif-
ferent levels of the response framework.You should include as an appendix to
your Incident Response Plan, a contact list that includes every person, and
each organization, that has documented responsibilities in the plan.
Agency CSIRC
Each agency CSIRC will have unique responsibilities.You should list high-
level bullets of the expected responsibilities of your agency CSIRC in your
C&A Incident Response Plan.Typical CSIRC responsibilities are as follows:
■
Develop and maintain the agency computer security incident
response capability policy and procedures
■
Maintain an incident response capability to ensure timely reporting
of security incidents
■
Provide implementation guidance for processes and procedures
■
Establish procedures to ensure timely reporting of security incidents
■
Report signiﬁcant computer security incidents to US-CERT as soon
as possible but no more than one hour after detection with a follow-
up report every four hours thereafter until the incident is resolved
■
Report minor incidents in a monthly incident report to agency CIO
■
Report all planned penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
to the CIO
■
Write lessons learned and follow-up reports on agency computer
security incidents
■
Implement tools and processes supporting the agency computer secu-
rity incident response capability and procedures to collect and safe-
guard evidence for use in legal or administrative functions

162
Chapter 11 • Addressing Incident Response

■
Distribute advisories and vulnerability bulletins received from the
CSIRC to appropriate agency CSIRC personnel and designated
points of contact (POC) at their respective sites
Information System Owner and ISSO
Typical responsibilities of the information system owner usually are managed
by the ISSO. While processing a security incident, the ISSO should keep the
information system owner apprised of the status incident.The C&A Incident
Response Plan should list the names of the information system owner, and
the ISSO on the contact page.Typical responsibilities of the information
system owner include the following:
■
Assign a computer security incident response team (CSIRT) that
interacts with the CSIRC to resolve security incidents
■
Ensure that the CSIRT has implemented procedures to reduce the
risk of, and minimize the damage of, a computer security incident
■
Ensure that the CSIRT operations comply with:
■
Agency Computer Security Incident Response policies
■
Agency Security Awareness Training
■
Agency security auditing and record retention procedures
■
Agency IT standards
■

■
Assign a CSIRT point of contact that acts as a central coordination
point for the agency CSIRC
Incident Response Manager
The computer security incident point of contact (POC) for the information
system under C&A often is known as the Incident Response Manager.The
ISSO may designate someone as the Incident Response Manager; however,
the ISSO may also choose to act as the Incident Response Manager.The
Incident Response Manager should coordinate notiﬁcation and escalation and
ensure that the incident response team is properly assembled.The Incident
Response Manager typically holds responsibilities such as:
■
Evaluate known threats and vulnerabilities to ascertain if additional
safeguards are needed and brief the ISSO as appropriate
■
Develop procedures to receive information on security incidents and
common vulnerabilities from the agency CSIRC
■
Determine the incident priority level of the security incident for the
information system under C&A and its computing environment
■
Determine incident impact to the information system under C&A 
■
Perform appropriate and immediate investigation of every security
incident, whether the event was detected by the system or reported
by a user
■
Establish and implement tools and processes supporting the computer
security incident response capability’s procedures to ensure timely
reporting of security incidents
■

■
Forward reports and documents pertaining to computer security inci-
dents such as incident summary, lessons learned, and follow-up
reports, to the CSIRT upon the receipt of the information
■
Appoint a backup POC to take their own place in the event of
absence
■
Notify the CSIRT and ISSO when the Incident Response Plan
changes.
Deﬁnitions
Your Incident Response Plan should include a section on deﬁnitions, and in
it you should deﬁne any signiﬁcant terms used in the plan. Some deﬁnitions
that you’ll want to include are incident, threat, exposure, vulnerability, event,
and incident severities.
Incident
If your agency has its own unique deﬁnition of a security incident, you
should use it. Other deﬁnitions I have seen used in reputable Incident
Response Plans are as follows:
■
Deﬁnition 1 A security incident is a violation of a security policy
for a system, network, telecommunications system, or facility.
■
Deﬁnition 2 A security incident is any real or suspected adverse
event in relation to the security of computers or computer networks
■
Deﬁnition 3 A security incident is any compromised or suspected
compromised system; any type of attack or pre-attack reconnaissance
levied on or from a computer resource; or misuse of IT resources
(such as chain letters, unauthorized access, virus hoaxes, etc.), or any
other anomalous activities detected.
www.syngress.com
Addressing Incident Response • Chapter 11
165

The National Institute of Standards and Technology makes a distinction
between computer security events and computer security incidents. NIST
deﬁnes a security event as follows:
A violation or imminent threat of violation of computer secu-
rity policies, acceptable use policies, or standard computer
security practices.1
If your agency has a C&A Handbook, there should be a section in it on
incident response.You should refer to that section when documenting your
deﬁnitions and follow the recommended guidance from the handbook.
Impact, Notiﬁcation, and Escalation
Although all security incidents should be taken seriously, they may not all
have the same severity.Your Incident Response Plan should deﬁne how inci-
dent severities will be determined and what this means in terms of incident
handling. Some of the things that you will want to take into consideration
when recommending severity levels are the following items:
■
Number of sites or networks affected
■
Importance of systems affected
■
Number of agency systems affected by this incident
■
Number of other agency systems vulnerable to the same exploit
■
Consistency with the latest vulnerability scan of the target system
■
Known countermeasures and existence of tested vendor patches/
hot-ﬁxes
■
Entry point of the incident (e.g., network, telephone line, router,
application)
■
Potential damage resulting from the incident
■
Estimated time to close out the incident
■
Resources required to handle the incident
■
Business impact of system(s) involved

Chapter 11 • Addressing Incident Response

■
Exposure to agency data
■
Potential of incident to spread to multiple sites/systems
NIST has deﬁned severity categories and escalation thresholds in the pub-
lication, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, NIST Special Publication
800-61, January 2004. Many agencies may elect to use the NIST guidelines
verbatim from pp. 3–15 of this document. I have taken the NIST guidelines
and made a few modiﬁcations as depicted in Table 11.1.The timeframes listed
in Table 11.1 should be interpreted as the maximum amount of time allowed
to pass before action is taken.
The severity of a computer security incident can be designated as High,
Medium, or Low, according to the type of system compromised, and the
extent of the network penetration. In general, unauthorized access to security
systems such as ﬁrewalls is more critical than unauthorized access to user
workstations.Therefore, unauthorized access to ﬁrewalls may be considered
High priority and unauthorized access to a user workstation may be consid-
ered Low priority. However, if the unauthorized access to user workstations is
networkwide, and in multiple geographic locations, this type of compromise
in fact might be considered High priority.The combination of the type of
system compromised, and the extent of the compromise, is vast. Due to all the
possible combinations of compromise, it is difﬁcult to describe the severity of
impact for every situation. Deciding on the severity of impact is a qualitative
decision and a judgment call at best. In general, if the impact to the business
mission is low, the severity of the impact is low. Similarly, if the impact to the
business mission is high, the severity of the impact is high.
Providing guidelines for escalation and response speeds up the decision-
making process when administrators are challenged with an anxiety-pro-
voking security crisis. In conjunction with the time frames, your plan
should also establish what sort of action should be taken as far as notifica-
tion to a higher authority goes. When do the information system owner,
data owners, and CIO get notified? Are they notified at the same time as
the agency CSIRC? If your agency security policies do not offer guidelines
on reporting, the information system ISSO will need to make the appro-
priate recommendations.

You need to be clear as to who is part of the CSIRT.The CSIRT should
be described in your plan with key personnel identiﬁed. Security incidents are
never convenient and some members of the incident response team might not
be immediately available.Your Incident Response Plan should include detailed
contact lists that include home phone numbers, cell phone numbers, pagers,
and e-mail addresses for everyone that is part of the CSIRT.

Incident Handling
Incident handling refers to the operational procedures used to actually manip-
ulate the incident and purge it from your systems. If your agency already has
detailed instructions for incident handling, it is acceptable simply to republish
those instructions in this section. If you republish agencywide incident han-
www.syngress.com
168
Chapter 11 • Addressing Incident Response

dling instructions, be sure to state what publication or document these
instructions come from, and that your incident response team is required to
follow these instructions. If agencywide incident handling instructions do not
exist, you will need to develop some for your plan.
Something that is very important to keep in mind while processing a
security incident is that once a system has been compromised, you cannot
trust any of the information on it.A compromised system has lost its integrity.
Systems that have been compromised will ultimately have to be rebuilt.
Detecting an Incident
Your agency may require that you include some information on how to
detect a security incident. Suggestions on what to put in this section of your
document are listed as follows.
Suspicious accounts and logins are often characterized by:
■
Single or multiple unsuccessful login attempts
■
Unexplained or suspicious entries in system log ﬁles
■
Questionable user permissions on accounts 
■
Multiple successful login attempts in a short amount of time, on mul-
tiple systems
Suspicious activities related to data and ﬁles often are characterized by:
■
Unexplained modiﬁcation or deletion of data
■
Unauthorized creation of new user accounts
■
User accounts with unauthorized increased privilege
■
Accounts without passwords
■
Activities that breach existing security policies
■
Unexplained discovery of new ﬁles or unfamiliar ﬁlenames
■
Recurring viruses
■
Modiﬁcation of ﬁle lengths and/or dates without permission
■
Unauthorized or unexplained attempts to write to system ﬁles

Containment and Eradication
Upon discovery of a security incident, it is very important to prevent it from
spreading to other systems and networks.You should always try to contain an
incident before you try to eradicate it. Somewhere in your Incident Response
Plan you should state that you have a containment strategy, and describe what
it is based on.
Each type of security incident may require a completely different contain-
ment strategy. Various measures that can be used to contain security incidents
and eradicate the intruder include:
■
Blocking all incoming network trafﬁc on border routers
■
Blocking networks and incoming trafﬁc on ﬁrewalls
■
Blocking particular services (e.g., ftp, telnet) and ports on ﬁrewalls
■
Disconnecting infected systems from the network
■
Shutting down the infected system
■
Locking compromised accounts
■
Changing passwords on compromised systems
■
Isolating speciﬁc network segments
Before you attempt to remove and overwrite ﬁles associated with an inci-
dent, decisions need to be made on whether the evidence should be saved for
forensic investigation.The incident response team should report the facts to
the agency legal department and take into consideration their advisement.
Usually, it is not worth the time and expense it takes to ﬁnd out who the
perpetrator is. However, before conceding that the intruder will not be
caught, the question should at least be asked if evidence preservation is
required.
During the containment and eradication process, the CSIRT will need to
make various decisions on how to proceed.You may want to stipulate in your
Incident Response Plan that the CSIRT will make the following determina-
tions while processing the incident:
www.syngress.com
Addressing Incident Response • Chapter 11
171

■
Determine which systems, applications, and networks have been
affected
■
Determine whether to inform users that a security incident has
occurred
■
Determine to what extent the affected systems should remain 
operational
■
Determine the scope, impact, and damage to the compromised 
systems
■
Determine if the prescribed course of action will destroy the 
evidence
■
Determine if other ISSOs should be informed of the incident
Recovery and Closure
As mentioned earlier, all compromised systems need to be rebuilt. Whether
they will be rebuilt on the originally compromised system, or built on a new
system is one of the decisions that will need to be made. Before rebuilding
the system, if the decision has been made not to proceed with a forensic
investigation, a regular backup should be performed.The operating system
should be reinstalled, hardened, and have relevant patches installed prior to
installing any applications.
When an incident is closed, both the CSIRT and CSIRC should be in
agreement that the incident has been completely resolved and the affected
systems have been recovered and restored.The Security Incident Reporting
Form should be updated to indicate the incident has been closed.
After an incident has been closed, the CSIRT should have a meeting to
discuss lessons learned. It is always worthwhile to document the lessons
learned.The types of questions to be answered and documented in the lessons
learned meeting include:
■
Exactly what happened, and at what times? 
■
How well did the CSIRT perform in dealing with the incident? 
■
Was the CSIRC responsive to the CSIRT’s needs?
www.syngress.com
172
Chapter 11 • Addressing Incident Response

■
Were the documented procedures followed? Were they adequate? 
■
What information was needed sooner? 
■
Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the
recovery? 
■
What would the CSIRT do differently the next time a similar inci-
dent occurs? 
■
What is the monetary estimate for the amount of damage the inci-
dent cost?
■
How many hours did it take to resolve the incident?
■
What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future?
■
What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and
mitigate future incidents? 
Documenting lessons learned can help improve the ability to more efﬁ-
ciently handle security incidents in the future. It may also provide justiﬁcation
for the information system owner’s security budget to procure new assets like
intrusion detection systems and security incident management consoles.
Forensic Investigations
Not all security incidents will require forensic investigations. In the event that
a forensic investigation is required, it will expedite the process if the course of
action is planned out up front. Forensic investigations require that the evi-
dence be preserved in its original state.Any modiﬁcations made to the system
containing the evidence could be construed as tainting of the evidence.
The way to preserve the evidence is to perform a bitstream backup.A bit-
stream backup is a special kind of backup that replicates the evidence exactly
without making any changes to the original data. When preserving evidence,
it is important not to change the timestamps of the data that indicate the
access times.You don’t want to change the read access of the data because it
might have been the intruder who last read the data and created the last read
access timestamp.You also want to preserve the ﬁle slack, which is the data
stored in swap ﬁles or memory buffers.Therefore, if a forensic investigation is
to take place, you need speciﬁc policies and procedures. If a forensic investiga-
www.syngress.com
Addressing Incident Response • Chapter 11
173

tion should occur, you may want to stipulate that the CSIRT follows these
policies:
■
Only tools that create evidence grade backups (bitstream backups)
can be used to access the compromised system
■
Forensic investigations must be done by staff who have prior experi-
ence or training in this competency
■
A chain of custody documenting who has access to the evidence
must be established
■
The obtained evidence must be submitted to the agency legal team
along with a report of evidence ﬁndings
■
Send evidence preservation request letters to ISSOs in charge of sys-
tems that are connected to the information system being investigated
■
Follow all U.S. Department of Justice search and seizure guidelines
When performing forensic analysis, you’ll need to use fresh software tools
that are not currently installed on the tools where the incident has occurred.
Any forensic tools on the breached system could have been replaced with
Trojan programs; therefore you can’t trust their integrity.A good example is
to take into consideration the output of the ps program that you run on a
UNIX system to view the process table.The ps program displays a list of the
UNIX daemons currently running on the system. However, certain Trojan
programs have been designed to display everything except the hacker back-
door daemons. Since you also need to preserve the evidence and integrity of
the breached system, it is best that the fresh software you use to provide
forensic analysis is installed on an entirely different system or drive such as a
portable ﬂash disk.Though operating systems contain some built-in programs
that are useful for collecting evidence, there are also powerful commercial off-
the-shelf tools designed just for this purpose.
Some of the commercial off-the-shelf tools have advanced features for
preserving evidence that are above and beyond the capabilities of most
operating systems.Tools that are currently being used by various federal
agencies and law enforcement include products made by some of the 
following vendors:

■
Guidance Software (www.guidancesoftware.com)
■
New Technologies, Inc. (www.forensics-intl.com)
■

Some of the things that you’ll want to look for and retain for evidence
and analysis are:
■
Suspicious IP addresses and their geographic locations
■
Open ports that should not be open
■
Open ﬁles that should not be open
■
File slack, RAM slack, and drive slack
■
Timestamps and dates
■
Services running that should not be running
■
Unauthorized port listeners
■
World-writeable ﬁles with new timestamps
■

There are some UNIX-based forensics tools available for free on the
Internet that are very good at collecting and analyzing forensic evidence.
Popular UNIX tools for security forensics include:
■
awk Good to use for formatting log ﬁles to look for trends.
■
egrep and grep Good to use in conjunction with awk to perform
searches in log ﬁles to look for trends.
■
ﬁnd Finds and identiﬁes ﬁles and directories that have changed since

Incident Types
If security incidents are thoughtfully categorized, it can speed up the ability to
respond to incidents by establishing a uniform understanding among the inci-
dent response team. It is certainly possible for a security incident to consist of
multiple types of violations. If a security incident consists of multiple viola-
tions, all violation types should be noted on the incident reporting form.
Your agency CSIRC may already have the different types of security inci-
dents categorized with identiﬁcation numbers. If incident categories do not
exist, or are not acceptable to the information owner or the ISSO, the C&A
preparation team may need to develop its own categories.Table 11.2 lists a
sampling of security incidents.This table is by no means exhaustive, however,
it is comprehensive and most security incidents will ﬁt in one of these cate-
gories. Before developing your own categories of security incidents for your
Incident Response Plan, you should inquire with the evaluation team if this is
acceptable or if you are required to use the CSIRC deﬁnitions. It is reason-
able and acceptable to ask questions of the evaluation team along the way
when you require clariﬁcation. If you want your package to be accredited,

you’re usually better off following the direction of the evaluation team even if
you don’t completely agree with it.

Security Incident Reporting Form
Every incident response program should have an Incident Reporting Form to
standardize and track the collection of security incident information.The
Incident Reporting Form that applies to the information system undergoing
C&A should be included at the end of your Incident Response Plan.The
information contained on the Incident Reporting Form should be consistent
with the information described in the Incident Response Plan. For example,
if you include a section on the form that calls for a severity classiﬁcation, be
sure that severities are deﬁned in the Incident Response Plan.A sample
Incident Reporting Form is shown in Figure 11.2.

Summary
An Incident Response Plan formally documents the agency’s strategy for
responding to security breaches. By its very nature, a security incident is a
time of crisis to some degree, and during this time, more so than any other
time, you need to ensure that decisions being made are levelheaded and based
on sound judgments.The best way to do this is to deﬁne clear procedures and
protocols for responding to the crisis before the crisis ever hits and then to
train employees about these procedures and protocols.This is why the
Incident Response Plan is such a vital document.
The Incident Response Plan should cover all foreseeable security events,
and it should lay out the rules and triggers by which agency personnel are to
take action in response to the event.Although it may be impossible to predict
when and where a denial-of-service attack will strike, it is somewhat easier to
determine what the appropriate response should be. If this response is docu-
mented and agency employees are trained on the response, then cooler heads
will prevail when and if the possibility of the attack ever becomes a reality.

Introduction
A Security Test & Evaluation, known among security experts as an ST&E, is a
document that demonstrates that an agency has performed due diligence in
testing security requirements and evaluating the outcome of the tests.The
ST&E is a C&A document that tends to give agencies a lot of trouble. It’s not
clear to many agencies what tests they should be doing, who should be doing
them, and what the analysis of the tests should consist of.The ST&E is sup-
posed to convince the C&A package evaluators that the agency understands
the security requirements, enough so, that they can create tests to ensure that
the security controls uphold the requirements.
It is the responsibility of the information system owner to ensure that the
testing actually takes place. However, the information system owner may
choose to designate this responsibility to the ISSO.The federal guidance on
what to include in your ST&E is somewhat vague, and though this leaves lots
of room for ﬂexibility, it leaves many information system owners, C&A
package preparers, and C&A package evaluators wondering what a good
ST&E should include.
Types of Security Tests
Keep in mind that you are trying to certify and accredit an information tech-
nology implementation, not a product.That being said, any implementation
likely uses many products. Figuring out where to draw the line in the sand on
where a product ends and where an implementation begins is half the battle.
If you are using commercial off-the-shelf products, presumably due diligence
was already done in selecting that product.You are not trying to justify the
actual purchase of the product.You are trying to justify that the product was
correctly installed and conﬁgured.
Refreshing your memory from Chapter 2, C&A is based on certifying
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).Therefore, your tests should
be designed to determine if Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability are pre-
served by the security controls that are in place. Within each CIA category,
some of the tests will pertain to management controls, some of the tests will
pertain to technical controls, and some will pertain to operational controls.

Chapter 12 • Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E)

Conﬁdentiality Tests
Conﬁdentiality tests determine if unauthorized disclosure is possible. When
you perform conﬁdentiality tests, you are trying to determine if data is dis-
closed to people that it is not intended for.You are also trying to determine
that data is readable and executable by the people it is intended for.
Before you can set up tests to ensure conﬁdentiality, you have to under-
stand a bit about conﬁdentiality risks and vulnerabilities. Data traveling in
plaintext over communications lines is vulnerable to snifﬁng. Weak passwords
can be compromised using password crackers. Conﬁdentiality tests look to
ensure that authentication and encryption mechanisms work according to the
security requirements. It’s also important to ensure that the authentication and
encryption mechanisms have not just been implemented, but that they have
safeguards built around them to protect them from being sabotaged.
If you have reason to believe “shoulder surﬁng” is a risk, then a security
policy should be written that requires all users to be partitioned from other
users. If you have reason to believe social engineering (tricking a user into
revealing information to unauthorized individuals) is a risk, you should be
sure to address that in your Security Awareness & Training Plan. If you believe
that cryptographic algorithms may not have been implemented correctly, you
should use only products that have passed FIPS 140-2 testing performed using
the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).1
If password ﬁles exist, you may want to perform a test to ensure that the
passwords are properly encrypted and the encrypted passwords are not easily
discovered using a dictionary password cracker.You’ll also want to ensure that
the permissions on the password ﬁles are set correctly and are not writeable
to the world.
If you are using biometric devices, you will want to be sure to test the
False Acceptance Rates (FAR), the False Reject Rates (FRR), and the Cross-
over Error Rates (CER).A biometric device is more accurate and reliable as
the CER goes down and you will want to establish acceptable thresholds in
your test plan. Other metrics to take into consideration for biometrics include
the Failure to Enroll (FTE) rate and the Failure to Acquire (FTA) rate. FTE
denotes the amount of people who are not able to use the system due to
www.syngress.com
Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E) • Chapter 12
189

some sort of incompatibility and FTA denotes the number of users who are
not able to render an acceptable enrollment image to use the device.
ST&E Best Practices…
Securing Biometric Devices
The following list explains the various rates that should be tested when-
ever you use biometric devices.
■FAR = the percent of unauthorized users incorrectly matched
to a valid user’s biometric
■FRR = the percent of incorrectly rejected valid users
■CER = the error rate at which FAR equals FRR
■FTA = the failure to acquire rate
■FTE = the failure to enroll rate
If VPNs are a part of the infrastructure that you are certifying, you’ll need
to devise some tests to ensure that the VPN has been properly conﬁgured and
cannot be penetrated by unauthorized users.You’ll also need to clearly
describe whether the VPNs being tested are secure remote access VPNs (used
by remote users) or end-to-end VPNs that encrypt all trafﬁc that goes
between designated sites. VPNs can be conﬁgured to pass packets in tunnel
mode, transport mode, or both. Which modes does your security policy require?
You’ll need to ensure that VPNs are conﬁgured in accordance with your
security policy.
Conﬁdentiality problems that you’ll want to check for include:
■
Passwords that do not comply with the security policy
■
Authentication systems that are not properly conﬁgured
■
Use of algorithms that do not comply with the security policy
www.syngress.com
190
Chapter 12 • Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E)

■
Secure implementations of encryption products (VPNs, PKI, etc.)
■
Implementations that do not produce logging capabilities
To help you understand how to test for conﬁdentiality, construct questions
regarding conﬁdentiality security controls. For example:
1. What security controls ensure that passwords comply with the secu-
rity policy?
2. What security controls ensure that authentication systems are prop-
erly conﬁgured?
3. What security controls ensure that algorithms comply with the secu-
rity policy?
4. What security controls check for proper conﬁguration of encryption
products?
5. What security controls ensure that authentication and encryption 
systems produce log ﬁles that comply with the security policy?
By answering these questions, you can put together a list of security 
controls that address conﬁdentiality mechanisms.Your conﬁdentiality security
controls can be managerial, operational, or technical in nature. Once you have
developed your list of security controls, you can devise tests for them.
Integrity Tests
Integrity tests answer the question,“Is the data adequately protected to pre-
vent unauthorized modiﬁcation?”A goal of any information technology
implementation is to preserve the integrity of the data.You need good data
and you need to determine if it is possible for someone to inadvertently, or
purposefully, generate bad data. For example, buffer overﬂow attacks are
designed to breach the integrity of the system.Testing the integrity of the
implementation allows you to determine if secure coding principles were
adhered to and if all the right patches are in place.
Coding gaffes that you’ll want to check for are:
■
Buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities
■
Extraneous lines of code
www.syngress.com
Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E) • Chapter 12
191

■
Race conditions
■
Temporary ﬁles writeable by the world
■
Hard-coded passwords
To clarify how you would test for each of these ﬁve coding gaffes, con-
struct a question related to security controls that checks and prevents the
listed vulnerability. For example:
1. What security controls protect against buffer overﬂow attacks?
2. What security controls protect against extraneous lines of code?
3. What security controls protect against race conditions?
4. What security controls protect against temporary ﬁles writeable by
the world?
5. What security controls protect against hard-coded passwords?
From your list of questions, you should be able to put together a list of
security controls that address each question.Your security controls can be
managerial, operational, or technical in nature. Once you have developed your
list of security controls, you can devise tests for them.
Availability Tests
Availability tests ensure that availability is preserved.The tests should verify
that availability exists as required by the initial design requirements. On a
high-level, the kinds of tests that apply to availability are:
■
Testing of the conﬁguration management system 
■
Testing of the Contingency Plan
■
Testing of backups
■
Testing of fault-tolerant disk arrays (striping, mirroring, and
duplexing)
■
Testing of load-balancers
■
Testing of high-availability mission critical systems (e.g., ﬁrewalls,
DNS servers)
www.syngress.com
192
Chapter 12 • Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E)

Similar to how you test for integrity tests, you should be able to construct
a question related to security controls that checks for and prevents vulnerabil-
ities related to availability. For example:
1. What security controls protect the conﬁguration management
system?
2. What security controls protect the Contingency Plan?
3. What security controls protect the backups?
4. What security controls protect high-availability and mission critical
systems?
5. What security controls protect fault-tolerance?
6. What security controls protect load-balancers?
Again, from your list of questions, you should be able to put together a list
of security controls that address each type of availability concern.Your secu-
rity controls can be managerial, operational, or technical in nature. Once you
have developed your list of security controls, you can devise tests for them.
Types of Security Controls
NIST provides an excellent listing of various security controls in Special
Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
Information Systems (SP 800-53) available at the following URL: http://
csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53/SP800-53.pdf.
If you need ideas for security controls that you may want to test, a long
list of different security controls begins on p. 40 of this SP 800-53.The secu-
rity controls you choose to test should also be consistent with the security
controls that you include in your Self-Assessment (discussed in Chapter 8).
Management Controls
The testing of management controls looks at whether or not the current
information technology environment of the information system being certi-
ﬁed holds management accountable and has built-in escalation thresholds.
Planning controls ensure that the management team has ascertained the risks
involved and have either accepted them, or mitigated them before authorizing
www.syngress.com
Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E) • Chapter 12
193

operation. For example, ensuring that systems get properly certiﬁed and
accredited every three years is a management control.
A test that checks to see if a risk is mitigated through existence of a
written security policy in place is a management test.Typically the manage-
ment team is responsible for ensuring that appropriate security policies exist.
Operational Controls
Operational tests are those that test if the actual operations of the system
undergoing C&A works as expected—according to the intended design. For
example, when you press a Submit button to submit a form, is the form actu-
ally submitted as planned? If you a schedule a ﬁle to be sent to another com-
puter at 2 A.M., does the ﬁle get sent on schedule? Operational tests answer
the question,“Does it work as intended according to the design require-
ments?” For example, ensuring that the backups work as documented is an
operational control.
Technical Controls
Conﬁguration tests determine if the conﬁguration of all the components of
the installation are correctly conﬁgured. If the products you have imple-
mented are not conﬁgured correctly you could be setting yourself up for
incredible security risks. For example, ensuring that ﬁrewalls and intrusion
detection systems monitor and log all signiﬁcant security events is a technical
control.
Testing Methodology and Tools
Your tests can be manual or automated, or a combination of both, as long as
they get the job done. Either way, you’ll still have to document how the tests
were conducted. If you use a software test management package, you should
describe it, and how it works, in the ST&E.An example of testing procedures
and results are listed in Table 12.1.You’ll want to be sure to include the date
and version number for every test you perform. For each test performed,
you’ll need to describe the expected results and the actual results. If the actual
results do not match the expected results, the test has failed.
www.syngress.com
194
Chapter 12 • Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E)

There are different testing tools you may want to employ depending on
what you’re going to test. Since every implementation is different, not every
type of test may apply to all situations.You need to describe what was tested,
and how—and how you came to the conclusion that the test passed or failed.
If you use tools to perform your tests, you’ll want to document your tests in a
similar fashion to how you document manual tests.

Algorithm Testing
The biggest problem with encryption algorithms is that about 25 percent of
the time encryption algorithms are not implemented correctly in security
products.As a result of this problem, there are now laws and standards that
specify how encryption algorithms need to be implemented.
If an information system implementation includes encryption products, it
is a federal law that the encryption products be FIPS 140-22 compliant (unless
they have been approved and validated for classiﬁed use). Originally passed as
FIPS 140-1 in 1995, FIPS 140-2 is a Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) that was instituted as a result of the Information Technology Reform
Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106) and the Computer Security Act of 1987
(Public Law 100-235). FIPS 140-2 was published in May of 2001 and now
supersedes FIPS 140-1. Encryption products are not supposed to be procured
and implemented unless they have been ofﬁcially certiﬁed and validated
through the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).
Through the CMVP program, Cryptographic Module Testing (CMT) labs
use a tool called the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) that
can only be obtained from NIST and is used exclusively for testing encryp-
tion products. CAVS generates correct algorithm vectors that CMT labs use
to ensure that encryption algorithms are correctly implemented. If an encryp-
tion product has compliant algorithms, the CMT validates the ﬁndings and
submits the results to the CMVP program for accreditation.
Since all encryption products are supposed to be FIPS 140-2 compliant
before they ever get implemented, a test to check for that is simply to ensure
that each and every encryption product in the implementation under C&A
has a valid FIPS 140-2 certiﬁcate. FIPS 140-2 certiﬁcates are considered
public information and you can see all of them for every product ever vali-
dated under this program at http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/.
The only way to get around not using FIPS 140-2 products is for the
head of the agency, or a senior agency designated ofﬁcially, to apply for a
waiver.There are only two reasons considered acceptable for applying for a
waiver:
1. Compliance with FIPS 140-2 adversely affects the business mission
www.syngress.com
Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E) • Chapter 12
197

2. Compliance with FIPS 140-2 will create a major adverse ﬁnancial
impact
To apply for a waiver, a letter justifying the request for waiver should be
sent to:
FIPS Waiver Decision
Information Technology Lab
100 Bureau Drive, Stop 8900
Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8900
Because FIPS 140-2 exists, there should never be any need to test if cryp-
tographic algorithms were implemented correctly in a product. Products that
are not FIPS 140-2 compliant should never be implemented on the systems
that are being certiﬁed.Therefore, as far as algorithm testing goes, you have
two options: ﬁnd out if there is a FIPS 140-2 certiﬁcate for any encryption
products used and if there is, document that in the ST&E. If you ﬁnd encryp-
tion products without a FIPS 140-2 certiﬁcate, check to see if a waiver is on
ﬁle.A waiver should have been applied for before the product was actually
procured. However, if a waiver is not on ﬁle, the ISSO should advise the CIO
to apply for a waiver expeditiously.
Keep in mind that FIPS 140-2 only requires that algorithms be correctly
implemented in the product. It will not tell you if the encryption product
has been correctly installed and correctly configured within the agency
infrastructure.
Code and Memory Analyzers
If your information system undergoing C&A uses code that is custom written
and is not associated with any commercial off-the-shelf product, it is a good
idea to scan your source code for coding gaffes and vulnerabilities. Code and
memory analyzers can help you uncover source code vulnerabilities and
memory leaks.The following code and memory analyzers have helped shore
up many applications:

■

Some code analyzers are geared just for Web applications and specialize in
checking for Java and ActiveX problems, SQL injection vulnerabilities, CGI
problems, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Products that check for Web
application problems include:
■
Jtest by Parasoft (www.parasoft.com)

Shadow Web Analyzer by Safety-Lab (www.safety-lab.com)
■
WebKing by Parasoft (www.parasoft.com)
■
Nikto by Cirt.net (www.cirt.net/code/nikto.shtml)
Many network scanners also scan for Web site vulnerabilities as well as
network and operating system vulnerabilities.
Network and Application Scanners
Once conﬁgured and set up, network scanners run automated scans of your
systems and networks looking for well-known security vulnerabilities.
Nonintrusive network scanners do not try to exploit the vulnerabilities they
ﬁnd. Intrusive network scanners ﬁnd vulnerabilities and then try to exploit
them, and therefore are a bit more risky to use since they could potentially
cause damage to your systems. Most scanners can be conﬁgured to scan an IP
address, a range of IP addresses, a domain, or a Web site. High-end scanners
have the ability to generate a network map.
Some scanners specialize in scanning applications where instead of looking
for operating system vulnerabilities, their goal is to uncover vulnerabilities in
Web sites, cgi scripts, databases, and database applications.

After scanning systems or networks, penetration testing is the process
whereby one tries to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities. When performing
penetration testing, a security engineer may use additional tools to try to pen-
etrate the application, network, or system.
Before performing scanning or penetration testing, it is very important to
obtain permission in writing from the agency, bureau, or department that
owns the systems being scanned.An agreement should be established on
speciﬁcally what will be scanned, and when the scanning will occur. Whether
the person performing the scanning or penetration test is an agency employee
or a consultant, it is important to obtain a signature on the agreement to pro-
tect yourself from liabilities so that you are not accused of being an unautho-
rized intruder or a malicious insider.
Port Scanners
Port scanners simply scan for open ports.The reason to use a port scanner is
to ﬁnd out if the open ports comply with your security requirements and
your security policy. It is a security risk to have more ports open than neces-
sary. Often hackers scan for open ports to see which open ports they may
want to exploit. Once a hacker ﬁnds an open port, they often use particular
hacker programs that are uniquely coded to exploit a particular port. When
doing a port scan, you’ll want to scan both the TCP and UDP ports. Many
network scanners also scan for open ports.

By a long shot, the most popular port scanner is an open source tool
called nmap. However there are some commercial port scanners available as
well. Various port scanners that you may ﬁnd useful include:

Port Listeners
Probably the most popular port listener available is netcat, and since it is
open source, it is free to use.You can obtain netcat from the PacketStorm
Web site, http://packetstorm.linuxsecurity.com/.
A good test of your ﬁrewall is to run netcat on one of your mission crit-
ical servers that is protected by the ﬁrewall. Have netcat listen on a port that is
supposedly being blocked by the ﬁrewall and see if an attacking machine can
connect to this port—if it can, the ﬁrewall is being circumvented.You can
also use netcat to see if the port banner can be grabbed for the purpose of
ﬁnding out the version number of the operating system that is running.
Websnarf is a port listener written in perl that is made just for Web sites.
You can use this tool to ﬁnd out local and remote IP addresses that are trying
to connect through port 80. If your ﬁrewall is blocking port 80, then no one
should ever be able to connect through port 80. If websnarf logs any connec-
tions to port 80, then someone is getting around the ﬁrewall.You can obtain
websnarf from the following URL: www.unixwiz.net/tools/websnarf-1.04.
Modem Scanners 
Modem scanners often are referred to as “war dialing” tools.The purpose of
modem scanners is to ﬁnd out if there are any modems (or FAX machines)
that are connected to systems in violation of your security policy.The fol-

Wireless Network Scanner
Wireless network scanners are sometimes referred to as “war-driving” tools or
wireless protocol analyzers.These tools are good for detecting open wireless
networks in your facility. If you have a policy that prohibits wireless networks,
you may want to walk around the facility with a wireless network scanner to
see if you detect any unauthorized Wi-Fi networks. Popular wireless network

Wireless Key Recovery
Wireless key recovery tools are basically wireless key crackers.Although they
can be used to recover lost keys, they are more often used to ﬁnd out if the
wireless keys that are being used are easy to crack. Wireless networks often are
secured by the Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which isn’t that secure;
however, it’s certainly better than no security at all. Using these popular open
source tools, you can ﬁnd out how easy your wireless network’s WEP keys
and keystreams are to crack:

Password Auditing Tools
Password auditing tools, sometimes referred to as password crackers, can be used
to help you ﬁnd out if your users are complying with the password security
policy.You can run the password ﬁle through leading password crackers to
ﬁnd out if users are choosing easy-to-guess passwords that use words that are
commonly found in dictionaries. Password auditing tools that can help you
determine weak passwords include:

Test Management Packages
Test management software organizes your testing initiatives.These types of
software packages are not required for C&A, but you may ﬁnd that they help
you more easily manage your testing program.Test management packages
help you create a controlled test environment, automate tests, and create test
script scenarios. Popular test management packages include:
■
SilkCentral Test Manager by Seque (www.seque.com)
■
WinRunner by Mercury (www.mercury.com)
■
QMTest by CodeSourcery (www.codesourcery.com)
■

Test management packages are especially useful for tracking lifecycle
changes in an application or implementation that stands to be around for a
long time to and will evolve over the years.

Chapter 12 • Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E)

Who Should Perform the Tests?
The security tests can be done in-house or using outside consultants.There
are no OIG or GAO requirements on who performs the tests. In the security
world, separation of duties is always important, and to that end, the ST&E
will certainly appear to be more ingenuous if the analysis of the tests is
written by someone other than the people who perform the tests.To show
the C&A evaluators that a clear separation of duties has occurred, you should
be sure to indicate who performed the tests, and who wrote the analysis—
documenting the professional credentials for the individuals involved.
Documenting the Tests
The tests must be fully described in the ST&E and the following items
should be included and described:
■
Test objectives
■
Test methodology
■
Test environment (version number, physical location, hardware plat-
form)
■
Test procedures including test execution instructions
■
Expected results
■
Actual results
■
Pass / Fail criteria
It helps if the tests are numbered so that they can easily be referred to in
the test analysis section of the ST&E.
Analyzing the Tests and Their Results
Although the tests themselves should be considered factual information, the
analysis is a subjective and detached expert opinion on the validity, integrity,
and plausibility of the tests. Whether the tests are performed in-house or by
outside consultants, the folks who write the analysis should be different than
those who conduct the tests.
www.syngress.com
Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E) • Chapter 12
205

The analysis should include an expert opinion on whether the objectives
of the tests adequately tested the security controls.A checklist, and relevant
questions that folks who analyze the tests will want to discuss in their analysis,
follows:
■
Do expected results of tests appear to be accurate?
■
Do actual results of tests appear to be accurate?
■
Have members of the test team been described?
■
Has a test failure been indicated if expected results do not match actual
results?

Chapter 12 • Performing the Security Tests and Evaluation (ST&E)

Summary
During this chapter we discussed a lot of different tools, techniques, and areas
of coverage with regards to security testing and evaluation. Don’t get bogged
down trying to ﬁgure out how a port listener differs from a port scanner.
There are three important high-level concerns when conducting ST&E: the
three security objectives, types of controls, and types of testing.Your ST&E
methodology should provide broad coverage in all of these areas.
When considering the triad of security objectives—Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, and Availability—you need to include tests that assess the security of
the system in terms of each of these objectives.These objectives are achieved
by implementing technical, operational, and management controls, and your
ST&E needs to be sure to test all three types of controls.Technical controls
can be tested using technical tools. However, operational and management
controls are often policies and procedures that do not lend themselves well to
technical tests. Therefore, your ST&E methodology must employ interviews
of personnel and examination of documents in some cases. So be sure that
your ST&E covers the Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability objectives;
that it tests technical, operational, and management controls; and that it uses
technical, interview, and examine test procedures. It your ST&E covers all
these areas, you will have a robust, effective ST&E component to your C&A.

Introduction
A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is the process that one goes through to
determine if personally identiﬁable private information is being appropriately
safeguarded.Aside from ﬁnancial losses and losses to life, there are also privacy
considerations for information technology systems. Some federal agencies
have databases with highly sensitive information such as medical records, tax
records, and information about private citizens.The Privacy Act of 1974
requires each federal agency to establish:
…appropriate administrative, technical and physical safe-
guards to insure the security and conﬁdentiality of records
and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to
their security or integrity which could result in substantial
harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness to any
individual on whom information is maintained.1
Agencies need to establish rules of conduct for systems developers as well
as penalties for noncompliance. Privacy Impact Assessments of public Web
sites and sensitive systems need to be conducted to ascertain if individuals’
social security numbers, gender, race, date of birth, and ﬁnancial status are
subject to exposure.The point of a Privacy Impact Assessment is to determine
if systems, Web sites, and applications comply with all federal laws, regulations,
and security policies.Threats to privacy and mitigating factors should also be
noted in a PIA.The assets that store the data subject to privacy policy provi-
sions and laws should be determined and understood.
Privacy Laws, Regulations, and Rights
On May 22, 2006, after it was thought that private information of 26 million
U.S. Veterans was stolen on a USB ﬂash drive, Clay Johnson III, the Acting
Director of the OMB, issued an important memorandum on privacy to heads
of departments and agencies.The memo can be viewed at
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2006/m-06-15.pdf.
The memorandum reminds heads of departments and agencies about their
responsibilities to safeguard private information.The OMB has published
other memorandums on privacy management as well.

OMB Memoranda
Various memoranda have been published by the Whitehouse Ofﬁce of
Budget and Management (OMB) and contain a wealth of information on
privacy concerns and what to include in a Privacy Impact Assessment.You’ll
ﬁnd the following ﬁve OMB Memoranda very helpful:
■
OMB Memorandum 01-05, Guidance on Inter-Agency Sharing of Personal
Data–Protecting Personal Privacy (December 20, 2000) provides a set of
privacy principles in conducting interagency data sharing.2
■
OMB Memorandum 00-13, Privacy Policies and Data Collection on
Federal Web Sites (June 22, 2000) requires that agencies comply with
the Web site privacy policies that they post following the guidance of
OMB Memorandum 99-18 and speciﬁcally prohibits the use of per-
sistent “cookies” on Federal Web sites.3
■
OMB Memorandum 99-05, Instructions on complying with President’s
Memorandum of May 14, 1998 ‘Privacy and Personal Information in
Federal Records’, includes what actions agencies must take for compli-
ance and requirements for agencies to track disclosure of private
information.4
■
OMB Memorandum 99-18, Privacy Policies on Federal Web Sites (June 2,
1999) provides guidance and model language for Federal Web site
privacy policies.5
■
OMB Memorandum 03-22, Guidance for Implementing the Privacy
Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, includes when to conduct
a PIA, what elements to include in one, and deﬁnitions, and PIA
reporting requirements.6
Laws and Regulations
Aside from the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, other
laws bestow the necessity of privacy rights management as well.These laws
include:

With so many laws and regulations governing privacy, and because privacy
information disclosures by public and private entities are making headlines,
noncompliance is clearly a liability to any agency, company, or nonproﬁt orga-
nization.
PIA Answers Questions
A Privacy Impact Assessment usually is designed in a survey format. It is
acceptable to ask different people in the organization to answer the different
questions. It is also acceptable to hold one person accountable for answering,
or ﬁnding out the answers to, all of the questions.You should work with the
ISSO to discuss the best approach.The best approach is the one that will help
you obtain accurate answers in an acceptable amount of time. It is acceptable
to conduct in-person interviews or use an e-mail or online survey.At the
very minimum, a Privacy Impact Assessment should answer the following top
ten questions:
1. What information is collected?
2. How is the information collected?
3. Why is the information collected?
4. What is the intended use of the information?
5. Who will have access to the information?
www.syngress.com
214
Chapter 13 • Conducting a Privacy Impact Assessment

6. With whom will the information be shared?
7. What safeguards are used to protect the information?
8. For how long will the data be retained/stored?
9. How will the data be decommissioned and disposed of?
10. Have Rules of Behavior for administrators of the data been estab-
lished?
If the answers to these questions result in new questions, the new ques-
tions should be asked. For example if it is discovered that the data will be
retained for 50 years, you’ll want to ask why. Use your common sense and
good judgment in developing the questions and evaluating their answers. If
the answers you receive don’t sound reasonable, then they probably won’t
pass muster with the C&A package evaluators either. It’s possible you may
need to go ask a different person the same question. What you are looking
for are facts. If you come up short no matter who you ask, don’t be afraid
to simply put down “unknown” for your answer.You definitely don’t want
to invent answers simply because the ones you were given sound question-
able.After all, one of the reasons you’re completing a PIA is to find out if
private data is being appropriately protected so that mitigating actions can
be enlisted if necessary.
It helps in obtaining accurate answers from the respondents if you do not
convey a confrontational manner.You may need to explain to them the value
of the PIA and how their responses will help agency ofﬁcials put together a
Privacy “To Do” list. Expound the virtues and responsibilities of being data
stewards of conﬁdential information. It helps put respondents at ease if they
feel their time spent answering the PIA questions will serve to beneﬁt people
just like themselves—you may want to convey that to them in a conversation,
or through e-mail.
Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII)
In considering what information is collected, of utmost importance should be
what’s known as Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII). PII includes infor-
mation that is associated with the identity of a person.A Privacy Impact
www.syngress.com
Conducting a Privacy Impact Assessment • Chapter 13
215

Assessment should determine if PII is collected and should list all types of PII
that are collected. Some types of PII that may be in use at your agency are:
■
Name
■
Home Addresses
■
E-mail Addresses
■
Social Security Numbers
■
Telephone Numbers
■
Addresses
■
Passport Numbers
■
Bank Account Information
■
Driver’s License Numbers
■
State Identiﬁcation Numbers
■
Account Numbers
■
Biometric Fingerprints
■
DNA
■
Photographs
Since PII includes data that is attributable to a person’s identity, the data
would not exist if that person did not exist. Essentially, an individual owns the
attributes of the PII.Therefore, it’s necessary that all PII applications include a
process for individuals to correct inaccurate PII whether the inaccuracy was
created by unauthorized access, an administrative error, or a change in cir-
cumstances.
You should be able to map the PII to speciﬁc applications.An example of
how to do this is illustrated in Table 13.1.

Persistent Tracking Technologies
Since persistent tracking technologies are often the biggest violators of pri-
vacy, they deserve special mention. Persistent tracking technologies record and
maintain information about Web site visitors after the user leaves the Web
site.The most commonly used tracking technologies are persistent cookies
and Web beacons. Cookies maintain information about Web site visitors after
they have left the site. Web beacons are typically a one-by-one graphic pixel
placed in e-mails or Web sites that send visitor information to another desti-
nation—perhaps a server, a database, or even directly to a person in the form
of an e-mail.A Web beacon can be completely invisible since the pixel can be
“clear,” matching the background color of the Web site. If any persistent
tracking technologies are used, a good PIA will fully describe the usage and
ascertain if it is in compliance with the agency privacy policy.

Determine Privacy 
Threats and Safeguards
A section of your PIA should include information on privacy threats, safe-
guards, and assets that store private information.This information can be

Decommissioning of PII
With the advancements in technology occurring at such a rapid rate, it is
understandable that databases get merged, systems get upgraded, old systems
get decommissioned, and disks with conﬁdential PII on them are turned off
never to be used again—in theory. However, in reality, old systems sometimes
end up in inadvertent places.To prevent the disclosure of conﬁdential and
private information, PII should be properly decommissioned according to the
agency security policy. Depending on how sensitive the data is, old disks that
contain PII may require bit wiping, a degausser, or destruction by a disk
crusher that drills through the spindles.
A draft document on media sanitation known as Special Publication 800-
88, Guidelines for Media Sanitation, was published by NIST on February 3,
2006.You may ﬁnd the NIST guide to be a useful resource for understanding
if the appropriate measures are being undertaken when a system reaches the
end of its System Development Life Cycle (SDLC); however, keep in mind
that this document is still in draft form, and is therefore not yet considered
ofﬁcial guidance. Nonetheless, you can access Special Publication 800-88 at

System of Record Notice (SORN)
A System of Record Notice (SORN) is a public notice that states what
groups of records are under an agency’s control. Whereas a PIA includes only
information technology records, a SORN includes both paper and electronic
records.To clarify further, a SORN is not a PIA and a SORN is not required
by FISMA.The Privacy Act of 1974 established the requirement of a SORN,
though that was before so much information was stored in computers. Some
agencies require that a SORN be included in the PIA, though this really goes
above and beyond FISMA and the E-Government Act of 2002.
Unless your agency speciﬁcally states that a SORN needs to be included
in your PIA, it’s not necessary to include one. However, just because your PIA
and C&A package may not require a SORN, that doesn’t mean your agency
is exempt from posting them. It’s altogether possible that a SORN and a
Privacy Policy may include duplicate information.
SORNs are published in the Federal Register and PIAs are not.The
Federal Register is part of the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA).You can view the Federal Register online at www.gpoaccess.gov/
fr/index.html.
Posting the Privacy Policy
All public Web sites that collect information on citizens, veterans, staff, and
military personnel require privacy policies.Additionally, any transaction-based
system that performs ﬁnancial transactions requires privacy policies.The pri-
vacy policy should list laws and regulations that it claims to comply with.
Once a Privacy Policy has been established, it should be posted for end-users
and administrators to see. For Web sites, it should be posted right on the front
page. For systems and applications that require logins, the Privacy Policy
should be posted in the banner before a user logs in.

Summary
In this day and age, preserving privacy is a fundamental requirement for
maintaining the positive reputation of an organization.There is a balance that
we try to strike between sharing information for communal use and pre-
serving information that is so personal and descriptive of an individual, that
the data owner is really the individual. Unfortunately, preserving privacy often
languishes on the bottom of the C&A and information security to-do list.As
soon as your own private information is disclosed against your wishes, privacy
becomes far more important. However, as data stewards of other people’s pri-
vate information, we are ethically obligated to act responsibly to preserve that
information.

Introduction
A Business Risk Assessment reviews the risks to the agency mission and deter-
mines if they are acceptable or not. If the risks are not acceptable, a determi-
nation of how to mitigate them should be described. Business risks are
examined at a high level and are not concerned with the particularities of
information technology.The reason that business risks are important is to give
some perspective on why the information technology infrastructure exists in
the ﬁrst place.
First, it’s worth noting that not all agencies require a Business Risk
Assessment for their C&A packages. Before you begin trying to ﬁgure out
how to develop one, make sure a Business Risk Assessment is required. Some
agencies may require only a System Risk Assessment that focuses on the tech-
nology of the systems and applications rather than the mission. However, to
be sure, the Business Risk Assessment is related to the System Risk Assessment.
If you develop the Business Risk Assessment correctly, the System Risk
Assessment will look like an extension of it and you will be able to see the
relationship between the two. Likewise, you will also see consistencies
between the Business Impact Assessment and the Business Risk Assessment.
Discussion of the Business Impact Assessment occurs in Chapter 15, and dis-
cussion of the System Risk Assessment occurs in Chapter 16.These three
related documents are presented in this order purposefully since a Business
Impact Assessment and a System Risk Assessment are extensions of a Business Risk
Assessment as depicted in Figure 14.1.

It will be easiest for you to write the subsequent document if you write
them in the recommended order:
1. Business Risk Assessment
2. Business Impact Assessment
3. System Risk Assessment
Before you can determine the risks to your agency’s mission, you need to
ﬁrst understand what the mission is.The process of determining the risks to
the mission is in part designed to force you to understand the mission.Your
agency, and its different bureaus and divisions, probably has multiple missions.
You need to be able to state what the primary mission functions are before
you can determine the business risks—the risks to the mission.
Determine the Mission
Business risks affect the ability to get a job or a task done.All agencies will
have different mission risks depending on the mission. Chances are your
agency or bureau has multiple missions. For any particular C&A project, you
should be concerned only with the missions that correlate to the particular
C&A package that you are putting together. Some examples of business mis-
sions are:
■
Analyze and record the annual budgetary appropriation from
Congress
■
Provide retirement beneﬁts to war veterans
■
Prepare the nation for natural disasters
■
Process enrollment information for Medicare recipients
■
Enable law enforcement ofﬁcials to access information on terrorists
■
Provide online access of navigational charts to mariners
■
Process patent applications
■
Monitor budgetary requirements for an Air Force base Child

Noticing the business mission takes the information technology out of the
equation so you can remember why the information technology infrastruc-
ture exists to begin with. Understanding the business mission is a process of
taking a momentary step backward to look at the bigger picture. In some
regards, conducting a Business Risk Assessment is a way of looking at the crit-
ical business functions from a legacy point of view and seeing things the way
business processes were accomplished on paper, years ago, before computers
came into existence. Sometimes we get so entrenched in the granularity of
the information systems that we fail to see how all the computer infrastruc-
ture came to be in the ﬁrst place.You need to know what the essential func-
tions are of the agency’s business in order to determine what the risks are to
the functions, the likelihood that the risks may occur, and their potential
impact.
Questions that may help determine your agency’s mission are:
■
What is the largest percentage of the agency’s annual budget dedi-
cated to?
■
Does your agency produce tangible assets? What are they?
■
Are large ﬁnancial transactions conducted by your agency?
■
Is there a large central communications command center in your
agency? 
■
Is your agency responsible for the health and safety of people? 
■
What do other agencies depend on your agency for?
■
What vital records are being created?

■
What are the key projects that are underway in the agency?
■
Why was your agency originally established by the government in
the ﬁrst place? 
Create a Mission Map
Once you have determined the primary mission or tasks related to the mis-
sion, set up a mission map that shows the relationships between agency func-
tions and the role that systems and networks play in carrying out the mission.
This is one of the best ways to ﬁgure out the relationship between the agency
mission and the IT infrastructure.An example of a mission map is depicted in
Figure 14.2.As you can see from this illustration, both the forecasting and
budget process, and the time and attendance process, are dependent only on
one geographic location, and one network.The user enrollment process is
dependent on two networks and two geographic locations.Therefore, deter-
mining the risks associated with the user enrollment process is bound to be
more complex.As far as natural hazards go, the user enrollment process has to
worry about both hurricanes in Houston, and heavy snow in New York.The
forecasting and budgetary process has fewer natural disasters to take into con-
sideration because Washington, D.C., has milder weather than either Houston
or New York.

With dependencies on two networks, you’ll have to look at the risks for
both. One risk that could be cited might even be that the user enrollment
process is dependent on two networks. If the Houston facility gets ﬂooded by
a hurricane and loses power, then the user enrollment process will stop
working—even if the New York site remains operational. Clearly, one way to
mitigate this risk would be to migrate the functionality of the user enrollment
process entirely to the New York site. However, that may not be possible for
all kinds of different reasons. Instead, it may be easier to build a failover
system in Washington, D.C., that automatically picks up the user enrollment
functionality provided by Houston if there is an outage in Houston. When
developing a Business Risk Assessment, you have to take into consideration var-
ious different scenarios that could affect the business process.There are, of
course, other risks aside from natural disasters. In taking into consideration the
different scenarios, you need to construct risk statements.
Construct Risk Statements
Risk statements are assertions that connect a possible circumstance to a fore-
casted impact.A common format for a risk statement is:
If <this threat circumstance occurs>, then <this will be the impact>.
Once risk statements have been developed, the impact can be forecasted
and the potential likelihood of the threat can be determined. Risk statements
state the presumed threat, and the impact in the form of damage that could
occur.The potential impact can then be factored with the probability of its
occurrence to ﬁnd out just how great the risk exposure is in actuality. Some
threats will create a more severe impact to the business process than others.
When you are creating risk statements for business risks, knowing the
technical details of the IT infrastructure is not really necessary. Save that for
the System Risk Assessment. It shouldn’t matter whether the ﬁrewall is a Cisco
ﬁrewall or a Juniper ﬁrewall. It also shouldn’t matter if the database is an
Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server database. Likewise, whether the operating
system is Sun Solaris or Microsoft Windows doesn’t matter. Business Risk
Assessments look at things from a high level. In the Business Risk Assessment
you want to focus on business processes necessary to the organization to be
able to carry out its mission(s) and the impact that the loss or degradation of
www.syngress.com

Chapter 14 • Performing the Business Risk Assessment

one of those business processes would have.The low-level, more technical and
granular risks to the information systems that support those business processes
will be evaluated in the System Risk Assessment, discussed in Chapter 16.
Examples of risk statements for a Business Risk Assessment are:
■
If the Houston facility gets ﬂooded, then it won’t be possible to
enroll new users. (This is an availability threat.)
■
If the Houston facility gets ﬂooded, then it won’t be possible to pro-
cess time and attendance for any employees. (This is an availability
threat.)
■
If an unauthorized user gains access to the Washington, D.C., network,
then the integrity and conﬁdentiality of the annual budget could be
compromised. (This is an integrity and conﬁdentiality threat.)
■
If an employee accidentally misspells a user’s name, then the mis-
spelling could be propagated to two different locations. (This is an
integrity threat and most likely a relatively minor one.)
■
If a disgruntled systems administrator purposefully and maliciously
creates a backdoor account into the user enrollment system, it could
be propagated to two different locations. (This is an integrity, conﬁ-
dentiality, and availability threat.)
■
If a terrorist destroys the New York facility, then it won’t be possible
to enroll new users into the special program. (This is an availability
threat.)
■
If an intruder breaks into the budgeting system and changes some of
the numbers in an Excel spreadsheet used for forecasting, too much,
or too little money may be allocated to certain programs. (This is an
integrity threat.)
■
If a system administrator erroneously conﬁgures a ﬁrewall rule for the
Houston ﬁrewall, then access to both user enrollment, and time and
attendance, might be blocked. (This is an availability threat.)
■
If a virus proliferates throughout the Houston network, both the user
enrollment system and the time and attendance system could be
damaged. (This is an integrity threat, and possibly an availability
threat as well.)
www.syngress.com
Performing the Business Risk Assessment • Chapter 14
231

■
If an intruder breaks into the user enrollment system they could steal
a database of private user information. (This is a conﬁdentiality
threat.)
■
If security patches are never applied to the time and attendance sys-
tems, then intruders may gain access to the attendance systems and
damage them. (This is an integrity threat, and possibly an availability
threat as well.)
Once we know what the threats are, if we have a sensitivity model to
measure their likelihood and impact, we can determine the risk exposure.
Describe the Sensitivity Model
According to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, risk
is the “possibility of suffering harm or loss; danger.”1 Risk analysis can be
performed in a variety of different ways. One of the goals of a C&A program
is to have some consistency from one C&A package to another.Therefore, it’s
important to pick a risk analysis methodology, describe it, and use it as
described for each C&A package you develop.
A sensitivity model takes into consideration the impact of a threat, and the
likelihood of its occurrence, so that you can rank the risks according to their
sensitivity for the purpose of prioritizing them. In any given organization
there is a limited amount of time and resources. If you were able to deter-
mine all of the risks to your organization, would you have enough time and
resources to address each and every one? Probably not.Therefore, a goal is to
describe the most obvious and likely risks and then further predict the proba-
bility of their occurrence.The objective is to think of what situational hazards
and threats are most likely to occur, determine the risk exposure, and then
either mitigate, transfer, or accept each risk based on priority.
Your sensitivity model should consist of a process for determining the risk
exposure. (We already categorized the levels of Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability of the data in Chapter 6 so we are not going to repeat that here.)
In business risk assessment, risk exposure is a value that is calculated to deter-
mine the degree of risk that the mission is exposed to.The purpose of deter-
mining the risk exposure is so you can understand which business processes
www.syngress.com
232
Chapter 14 • Performing the Business Risk Assessment

and missions require additional safeguards.You’ll want to mitigate the most
severe risks to business missions ﬁrst.
It’s possible to use simple equations to determine risk exposure.You don’t
have to be a math genius to do this.The equations we use will multiply the
likelihood of a threat by the potential impact to the organization. However,
before you can set up these equations, you need to create an impact scale and
a likelihood scale so you know what to multiply.
Impact Scale
In qualitative risk analysis, the impact of a threat to the mission is measured in
relative terms.The values that are used to measure the impact are perceived
values, and are not actual values. Since a threat actually has not occurred yet,
it is not possible to use actual values. If your C&A Handbook already has threat
impact values deﬁned, you should use those values (unless you think they are
signiﬁcantly ﬂawed).Table 14.1 shows an example of an impact measurement
scale with ﬁve measurements.This same scale could be set up to have more,
or fewer, levels of impact to ﬁt the unique requirements of your agency or
department.

terms.Table 14.2 lists probability levels based on likelihood of occurrence.

Calculating Risk Exposure
In qualitative risk analysis, risk exposure is determined by multiplying the prob-
ability of mission loss (the likelihood it will occur) by the potential severity of
the impact to the agency due to that loss. If we represent probability with P, and
impact severity with S, our risk exposure equation looks like this:
P x S = Risk Exposure (RE)
www.syngress.com
234
Chapter 14 • Performing the Business Risk Assessment

We can also write the expression a different way to more clearly indicate
we are talking about the probability of loss (L) multiplied by the severity of
the loss (L):
P (L) x S (L) = R (E)
P (L) represents the likelihood. S (L) represents the impact.The probability
that loss will occur is another way of referring to the likelihood.The severity
of the loss is another way of referring to the impact.Therefore:
Likelihood x Impact = Risk Exposure
Now for a particular threat, we take the impact values from Table 14.1 and
multiply them by the probability of loss values from Table 14.2.All the pos-
sible outcomes of multiplying the likelihood by the impact are listed in 
Table 14.3.
Lead the Team to Obtain the Metrics
For the purpose of C&A, when putting together your risk exposure metrics,
it is important to interview the support, development, and management staff
to obtain their input. It is not possible to determine the impact and likelihood
of a threat to a business process in a vacuum.You need to sit down with the
folks that run the business. I recommend holding a business risk assessment
meeting and getting everyone together in a room. While it may seem unim-
portant to list risks that are so obviously low likelihood or low impact, the
reason for doing so is so that you can record all the issues that are raised by
the staff. It is important to record the issues raised by all the participants.
Remember, C&A is a format for holding people accountable. When you
develop the business risk assessment, it’s not your job to determine the likeli-
hood and impact on your own.You should take on the role of a facilitator of
the process and should use the values for impact and likelihood that the team
gives you in order to determine the risk exposure.
Analyze the Risks
Once you have determined the risk exposure, it is time to analyze the risks to
prepare for making an informed decision.There are multiple reasons for ana-
lyzing risks. When a threat is exploited, otherwise competent staff are often

left ﬂustered not knowing what to do ﬁrst.Analyzing risk is about antici-
pating the incident in order to prevent it, and also to prepare for how to
respond in the event it does occur. Determining business risk exposure helps
you understand what risks to address ﬁrst.
Even in the absence of malicious attackers, disgruntled users, and adminis-
trative errors, power outages still occur and natural disasters wreak havoc.
Understanding risks, and applying safeguards to mitigate those risks not only
prevent loss to the mission, but also helps maintain the ﬂow of order by poten-
tially reducing the amount of circumstances that may create disorder.You ana-
lyze risks so you can prioritize them for the purpose of managing them. Once
the risk exposure is determined and ranked from high to low, the ﬁndings
should be presented to the business owner.The business owner and ISSO
should engage in discussions with the business risk assessment team that origi-
nally assisted you in putting together the list of risks, their impact, and likeli-
hood.Analyzing the risks means discussing the possible outcomes before
making a decision on what action to take.Table 14.3 lists risk exposure metrics.

Make an Informed Decision
Once risks have been identiﬁed and analyzed, a decision can be made on
what action to take.Your choices are to accept the risk, transfer the risk, or
mitigate the risk.You should be able to justify your reason for whatever deci-
sion you make.
Accept the Risk
If the risk exposure is extremely low, and the cost to remove such a small risk
is extremely high, the best solution may be to accept the risk. Keep in mind
that for the purposes of C&A, it is up to the business owner to accept the
risk.The business owner usually will accept the risk or not based on the rec-
www.syngress.com
Performing the Business Risk Assessment • Chapter 14
237

ommendation from the ISSO and the staff that prepares the Business Risk
Assessment.The business owner usually always wants a recommendation on
whether to accept the risk or not so be prepared to make one.
Transfer the Risk
When you transfer the risk, you make another entity responsible for it. When
you buy insurance, you are transferring the risk to a third party who has
agreed to assume the risk for an agreed upon cost. In a federal agency, in
many situations it may not be possible to buy insurance to transfer risks.
However, there are other ways to transfer risk. It’s possible that you may not
have the appropriate personnel to support a business function.A business
owner could possibly negotiate with another department to take on the
responsibility of supporting the business function.
If you know something is at risk, and you know another department
could manage the risk better, you might be able to transfer the risk to the
other department. For example, if one of the risks to your business process
is that you don’t have a UNIX Systems Administrator to manage a business
process that runs on a UNIX system, you may decide to transfer the man-
agement of the business process to the department that provides UNIX sys-
tems administration.The business owner will be looking for
recommendations on transferring risks.A business owner is not preserving
any sort of managerial territory or integrity by insisting on retaining a sub-
stantial risk that they know they cannot mitigate.A smart business owner
will want to get rid of all substantial risks.A risk to a business process puts
the business owner’s career at risk. Imagine the outcome if an expensive
security incident occurs and in the process of resolving the incident it
becomes known that the business owner knew all along that a substantial
risk was present, and yet did nothing about it.
Mitigate the Risk 
To mitigate the risk means to either remove it completely, or reduce it to an
acceptable level. If the risk exposure is very high, you’ll want to consider mit-
igating the risk.You can mitigate risks by putting safeguards in place, or
reconﬁguring existing safeguards.You can also remove the factors that con-
www.syngress.com
238
Chapter 14 • Performing the Business Risk Assessment

tribute to the risk (e.g., move the business to a location that is not prone to
hurricanes), or remove some of the dependencies of the business process.
Typically the more dependencies that a business process has, the more risks
there are. When a business process is dependent on multiple systems, multiple
software packages, and multiple locations, there most certainly will be mul-
tiple risks.
TIP
Remember the following risk monikers:
L = Likelihood
I = Impact
RE = Risk Exposure
Probability of loss = P (L) = Likelihood
Severity of loss = S (L) = impact
Multiple physical locations can go either way when it comes to risk.Two
locations mean that there are two facilities to protect, which doubles the nec-
essary safeguards. However, if the reason you have two facilities is so that one
can serve as a backup site in the event of a natural disaster, you may not be
mitigating risks by consolidating to one location. Every situation is unique
and you should keep in mind that each business unit may have risks that are
incomparable to another agency, bureau, or line of business.
For the purpose of tracking and managing your decision, you can summa-
rize you risk statements and risk exposure metrics in a table.Table 14.5 shows
a sample risk summary table.

Chapter 14 • Performing the Business Risk Assessment

Summary
Before you take the time to implement security controls, it’s important to
ﬁnd out where your risk exposure lies.A Business Risk Assessment examines
risk from a high-level global view. By determining business risk ﬁrst, you will
be better able to determine system risk. During the business risk analysis pro-
cess you will come to understand your organization’s business mission, and see
how those functions are related to your information technology infrastruc-
ture.After determining your business risk exposure, once you come to under-
stand which functions are prone to the greatest risk, you can more accurately
focus your system risk assessment on the most highly exposed functional
areas.You may not have the time and resources to perform a penetration test
on all of your systems; however, you may have time to perform one on your
most highly exposed functional areas.
Performing a business risk assessment helps you to understand that busi-
ness that you are supporting. Sometimes IT professionals lose sight of the
forest and see only the trees. By understanding the business mission, and its
vulnerability exposures, you can more easily justify your decisions. For
example, an auditor may ask you why you decided to scan only one network
domain for vulnerabilities, and not a different one. Or perhaps you scanned all
your networks with one scanning tool, and then you scanned a particular
high risk network segment with two other scanning tools.An auditor may ask
why you scanned only the ﬁrst network with one scanner, and the other net-
work with three different scanners.Auditors are looking for you to justify
your reasons for your decisions.A Business Risk Assessment serves to help
justify your decisions, and make appropriate choices on security controls.

Introduction
A Business Impact Assessment (BIA) articulates the component restoration pri-
orities that an interruption in service may have on an information system,
application, or network. If you have a group of systems that include Web
servers, directory servers, application servers, ﬁle servers, ﬁrewalls, DNS
servers, and authentication servers, and your facility suffered an unprecedented
disaster, which one would you try to restore ﬁrst? Do you know? 
An interruption in service could be as minor as a power outage, or as
catastrophic as a bomb. In either case, at that time you, the system, and net-
work support group will have enough anxiety without having to think about
which system to restore ﬁrst.A BIA is all about removing some of that anx-
iety, so that systems administration staff can just go down a list of relative pri-
orities and get to work without having to spend time ﬁguring out which
systems should be restored ﬁrst. By planning for a recovery before you need
to orchestrate one, you can more efﬁciently manage your recovery effort.
Planning for a recovery up front also more effectively provides assurances for
the continuity of your agency’s mission.
In a C&A package, most of the time the evaluation team expects to see
the BIA as one of the appendices of the Contingency Plan. When I write a
Contingency Plan, I often like to have the BIA in front of me as a snapshot of
what’s important, and therefore I ﬁnd that it works best to write the BIA
before writing the Contingency Plan. Similarly, when I write the BIA, I ﬁnd
that the Business Risk Assessment helps me establish the priorities that I need
to document in the BIA.Therefore, you may want to have your Business Risk
Assessment handy when you work on your BIA.
Document Recovery Times
In Chapter 6 I discussed how to put together a Hardware and Software
Inventory.You should have the systems you want to recover already identiﬁed
by way of that inventory. Now you need to ﬁgure out how long it will take
to rebuild each of those systems. In your BIA you should document estimated
recovery times.The estimated recovery time should be made by trained sup-
port staff that typically administer the systems and build them on a routine
basis.

Chapter 15 • Preparing the Business Impact Assessment

You are not trying to ﬁgure out what the management team wants the
recovery times to be, you are trying to ﬁgure out what the recovery times
actually are. If an IT manager wants a server to be recovered within two
hours, but a systems administrator tells you that under the best possible condi-
tions it takes four hours to build the server, it makes little sense to document
the recovery time as two hours. Go talk to the systems administrators, the
application administrators, the database administrators, and the backup support
staff to ﬁnd out the recovery times.
The reason that recovery times are important to know is because in the
event of a disaster, management may need to make decisions based on
recovery times. For example, it may be necessary to hire additional temporary
staff to help with the recovery, and stafﬁng decisions may need to be made
based on recovery time information. If it takes too long to recover a particular
server—so long that it impacts the business mission—management may make
the decision that an already built standby system be available at all times at an
alternate facility.
Establish Relative Recovery Priorities
In thinking about establishing recovery priorities, you need to take two things
into consideration—the importance of the system to the mission and the
dependencies of each system. If a particular application server is the most
important system to the agency mission, but it won’t work without a DNS
server and router, in the event of a disaster it does little good to rebuild the
application server and get it up and running before the DNS server is opera-
tional. Of course it is altogether possible that both systems could be built in
parallel. However, one of the reasons for establishing recovery priorities is that
there may not be enough staff available to build everything in parallel.
Each of the systems named in the Hardware and Software Inventory
should have a relative restoration priority of High, Moderate, or Low assigned
to it.The priorities should take into consideration the risk exposure metrics
you calculated in the Business Risk Assessment, as well as the dependencies
the hardware and software has on other assets listed in the inventory. Keep in
mind that your systems may have dependencies on systems that are not
named in the C&A package you are working on. Don’t include those systems
www.syngress.com
Preparing the Business Impact Assessment • Chapter 15
245

in the BIA.The systems that you include in the BIA are the same ones you
listed in the Hardware and Software Inventory.
If there are systems or applications that your systems are dependent on,
but are not part of your C&A package (e.g., are not listed in the Hardware and
Software Inventory), simply document a statement that describes that.You can
refer to that section of the BIA in a variety of ways such as:
■
External dependencies
■
Dependencies on general support systems
■
Dependencies on network segment 45
■
Dependencies on other agencies
■
Dependencies on the Information Systems department assets
■
Outside dependencies
Your relative recovery priorities can be deﬁned simply as:
■
High: Recover these systems and applications ﬁrst
■
Moderate: Recover these systems and applications second
■
Low: Recover these systems and applications last
Every line item in your Hardware and Software Inventory should have a rela-
tive recovery priority associated with it.
Telecommunications
In the event of a disaster, in most cases the very ﬁrst item that you’ll want to
have restored is the telecommunications system. However, if the telecomm
system is not part of the C&A package that you are developing, you won’t
need to include it.Telephones are necessary to reestablish services provided by
vendors, contactors, other agencies, and employees.Today, many employees
have cell phones, smart phones, or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), which
all can serve as backup phones in the event that the telecomm switch goes
down. Keep in mind, though, that if you don’t have someone’s cell phone
number on hand, you won’t be able to call them.Additionally, in some facili-
www.syngress.com
246
Chapter 15 • Preparing the Business Impact Assessment

ties cell phones don’t function well due to interference from the building and
lack of signal.
Infrastructure Systems
After telephone services are restored, usually the most important pieces of the
IT operations are the infrastructure systems, since all other systems usually
depend on these systems for connectivity purposes. Infrastructure systems
consist of:
■
DNS servers
■
Routers, switches, hubs
■
Firewalls
■
Gateways
■
Connectivity provided by managed service providers (Internet con-
nectivity)
■
Domain Controllers
■
Directory Servers (LDAP*,Active Directory, NIS+, etc.)
*LDAP stands for Lightweight directory Access Protocol, an IETF standard.
It may not be necessary to include information about the infrastructure
servers in your C&A package because these systems might have a different
Business Owner that includes them in an altogether different C&A package. If
infrastructure systems were not listed in the Hardware and Software Inventory, you
won’t need to include recovery priorities for them in your BIA.
Secondary Systems
Secondary systems include any of the types of systems that would not be able
to function properly without the infrastructure systems.A secondary system
cannot function on its own. It needs the infrastructure systems for routing and
connectivity purposes. Examples of possible secondary systems that may exist
on your network are:
■
Messaging servers
■
Web servers
www.syngress.com

■
Database servers
■
File and print servers
■
Application servers
■
Mainframes
Deﬁne Escalation Thresholds
Escalation thresholds are predecided-upon timeframes for notifying the right
people about an outage.You can set up your escalation thresholds to whatever
you want them to be, taking into consideration the importance that the sys-
tems have to the business mission. Deﬁne your escalation thresholds by
unique and pertinent names.You’ll also want to decide who to notify when
the deﬁned escalation timeframe is reached. For example:
■
Prior to Level 1: Monitor the situation, take no action
■
Level 1: Notify users and stakeholders
■
Level 2: Notify developers, management, and CSIRC
■
Level 3: Notify a higher authority (FEDCIRC, FBI, FEMA, local
police)
Each level of escalation should have an associated timeframe. Some orga-
nizations will want to use more granular timeframes than others. If your
agency has predeﬁned escalation timeframes that have been standardized
across the agency, use those. If no escalation timeframes have been previously
deﬁned in an agency C&A handbook, by policy, or by management, simply
use what makes sense given the mission at hand. Possible escalation time-
frames you may want to consider are:
■
15 minutes
■
1 hour
■
2 hours
■
4 hours
■
8 hours

Undecided
Generally speaking, the systems and applications that need to be installed
ﬁrst should have the shortest escalation thresholds. It is altogether possible that
two different systems, both assigned a Level 1 priority, may have different
escalation thresholds depending on their usage, mission, and the number of
other systems that are dependent on it. If many systems are dependent on a
key server, you’ll want to decrease the time of the escalation threshold (on the
key server) and increase the priority.An example of escalation thresholds and
priority levels are shown in Table 15.1.

Record License Keys
Almost all software products require licenses. Software license are typically
long strings of numbers mixed with letters—something like:
LTP24-W9SJT-A4BMQ-CAWZ5-71XV3
Without a license key, it’s likely and possible that the software won’t run.
Although backup media should have all your systems’ and applications’ license
keys stored safely, there is no substitute for having a list of all the license keys
www.syngress.com
Preparing the Business Impact Assessment • Chapter 15
249

documented together in one easy-to-ﬁnd location.As systems are restored,
there are numerous reasons why it may be quicker to copy a license key off of
document than to ﬁnd it on backup media. Since the BIA is a document that
you would ostensibly use during a recovery endeavor, it makes sense to record
the license keys in the BIA.
If you think it is a nuisance to track down all these license keys and record
them, you’re right, it is. Just think of how much of an anxiety-provoking-nui-
sance it would be in the face of a disaster.That’s why you want to ﬁnd out
this information up front. Chances are you’ll have to resort to simply talking
to folks and asking around to get the right people to give you the license
keys. Some may even question your motives about asking for the keys. Simply
explain why you’re asking for the keys, and what you plan on doing with
them.You’ll want to obtain license keys primarily for operating systems,
databases, and applications.Any of the following types of IT support staff may
be good sources of license keys:
■
Systems administrators
■
Database administrators
■
Network administrators
■
Application support staff
■
The Helpdesk
You’ll want to call or e-mail them and ask them to look on the back of
CD cases to look up these keys. If support personnel e-mail you the keys, be
sure to advise them not to e-mail them out unprotected over the Internet. If
you are working from a remote location, and there is no Virtual Private
Network (VPN) between your system and the person sending you the keys, it
is better to obtain the keys over the phone, by FAX, or by having them
encrypt the keys using a ﬁle encryption program.
BIA Organization
In your BIA, it makes it very easy for the evaluators if you put all the infor-
mation you’ve accumulated on priorities, escalation time frames, and such in a
summary table.
www.syngress.com
250
Chapter 15 • Preparing the Business Impact Assessment

It is okay to submit the BIA as two documents—the Excel summary table
and a separate document that provides explanatory text. In the primary BIA
document that contains the explanatory text, be sure to indicate that a sum-
mary table exists as a separate ﬁle. If you don’t like the idea of submitting two
ﬁles, you can embed a table into the primary BIA document.
Aside from what I have already discussed in this chapter, other items that
you’ll want to include on your BIA summary table (or spreadsheet) are:
■
Server Role (Directory server, Web server, authentication server, ﬁle
server, etc.)
■
Hostname (the name known by the network and the DNS server)
■
Manufacturer (e.g., HP, Sun, Dell, etc.)
■
Model number (the number you would need to order a new 
replacement)
■
Location (e.g., building, room, street address, data center)
■
Description (e.g., Solaris 8 database server, Windows Domain
Controller)
■
Asset tracking number (often this is on a sticker with a bar code 
on it)
■
Primary point of contact (e.g., the sysadmin who keeps it running
and builds it)
■
Secondary point of contact (e.g., who you call when the primary is
out sick)
■
Contact phone numbers and e-mail address for points of contact

Summary
A BIA helps you prepare for a unscheduled outage. It should be submitted as
an appendix to your Contingency Plan; however, I have found it works out
best to write the BIA before you write your Contingency Plan. If done prop-
erly, your BIA is almost like an abbreviated Contingency Plan—a cheat sheet
if you will. If you take the time to ﬁgure out the escalation thresholds,
recovery times, and priorities in the BIA, you can more easily document the
contingency operations process in the Contingency Plan.
Aside from recovery timeframes and priorities, your BIA contains a record
of essential information that you will need during recovery operations. Points
of contact, license keys, make and model numbers of equipment, and so on is
information that is critical to recovering your systems in a timely fashion
should the need arise.

Introduction
The Contingency Plan is one of the most important documents in the C&A
package.You may need to use it someday. IT systems and networks are vul-
nerable to disruptions due to a variety of reasons—power outages, natural
disasters, and terrorist attacks to name a few.The nature of unprecedented
disruptions can create confusion, and often predisposes an otherwise compe-
tent IT staff toward less efficient practices. Confusion and inefficiency create
risk. Contingency planning and testing enable you to eliminate some of that
risk.
You’ll never be able to plan for all the contingencies that may come your
way.That being said, you still need to plan for some of them. How many? A
Contingency Plan (sometimes referred to as an IT Contingency Plan) should be
described in general terms in order to cover as many adverse situations as
necessary. Some of the objectives of your Contingency Plan should be to:
■
Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an
established plan
■
Provide a road map of actions for continuing operations
■
Reduce the complexity of the recovery effort
■
Minimize loss of, and damage to, assets
■
Identify resources to be used in the recovery operations
■
Facilitate the coordination of recovery tasks
■
Establish management succession and escalation procedures
■
Minimize the duration of the disruption
■
Assign responsibilities to designated personnel
■
Provide guidance in recovering operations
■
Identify an alternate site

Chapter 16 • Developing the Contingency Plan

List Assumptions
When it comes to planning for contingencies, there are various assumptions
you’ll need to make based on your information system and application
requirements.You can’t plan for every possible scenario, but you can plan for
some things. Listing assumptions explains to the reader that you intend to
count on certain things being a particular way if the Contingency Plan is to
work as documented—it deﬁnes a starting point.Assumptions are circum-
stances that exist whether the Contingency Plan gets activated or not. Examples
of assumptions are:
■
Key staff have been correctly identiﬁed and are appropriately trained.
■
The Kansas City data center will be available as an alternate recovery
site.
■
The off-site storage site where backup media is stored will be opera-
tional.
■
Current backups of the systems are intact and available at the off-site
storage location.
Concept of Operations
The concept of operations section of your Contingency Plan, sometimes
referred to as the CONOPS (or ConOps), should describe in dialogue how
the information systems and major applications that make up your C&A
package work and interoperate.Three key subsections of your CONOPS are
the System Description, Network Diagrams and Maps, and Data Sources and
Destinations.
System Description
Include a description of the information systems and major applications to
which the Contingency Plan applies.Your description should be consistent with
the system description that you document in your Systems Security Plan (dis-
cussed in Chapter 19). If there are three major applications, include a sum-
mary of each of them. If there are two network domains, describe their
architecture and connectivity requirements.
www.syngress.com
Developing the Contingency Plan • Chapter 16
255

Network Diagrams and Maps
Network diagrams and maps are extremely helpful in understanding how a
failover scenario is supposed to work, and how the network components
should connect to each other. Every Contingency Plan should have at the very
least one high-level network architecture map that shows each system listed in
the Hardware and Software Inventory.Aside from what’s listed in your Hardware
and Software Inventory, you’ll also want to include on your diagram some of
the key infrastructure devices such as routers, ﬁrewalls, domain controllers, and
directory servers.
You should also include logical diagrams of how major applications, Web
sites, and databases interact with each other. Such diagrams are often very
useful in plotting the data source and destinations.
Data Sources and Destinations
Data that is stored on information systems have sources and destinations.The
sources are the inputs. It is where the data comes from originally. It might
come from a user typing it in from their desktop, or it might come from
another system through a secure ﬁle transfer process or a VPN. Similarly, the
data has a destination.The destination is its ﬁnal resting place—where it’s
stored.
In taking into consideration contingency planning, you need to know the
source and destination for your data. In the event of a disaster, you are going
to want to be able to continue to obtain data from your sources. If you can’t
connect to your sources, your system is not entirely operational. It’s altogether
possible that your source and destination system is the same system. Users
might input data right into the database over the Web, and the stakeholders
might view it from that same database over the Web. However, the systems in
your C&A package might have different sources and destinations.
You need to understand how the data gets from the source to the destina-
tion. Is a secure ﬁle transfer tool used? Do users input the data from their
desktops over the Web? Are ﬁles distributed from a central distribution server?
The technology pipe that is used for getting the data from the source to the
destination—the data conduit—should also be documented. In order to
restore your infrastructure in the event of an outage, you’ll need all this infor-

mation.You can document the sources and destination of your data in a table
similar to the one depicted in Table 16.1.

Roles and Responsibilities
The Contingency Plan should establish roles and responsibilities designed to
recover operations. Depending on the outage or disaster that has occurred, the
recovery operations ostensibly could be at the original facility, or at an alter-
nate facility. Because there are so many different recovery scenarios, you’ll
want to have the roles and responsibilities deﬁned in general terms so that
they can be applied to as many different types of situations as possible.
Depending on the size of your organization or department, some of your
staff may provide support for more than one role.Typically, the roles of the
recovery team are additional roles to a staff member’s regular and ordinary
duties. For example, the ISSO may act as the Contingency Planning
Coordinator and an IT manager may act as the Information Systems
Operations Coordinator. It is also conceivable that two people could act as a
team in assuming the responsibilities of a particular role. For example, the
Damage Assessment Coordinator has such an extensive list of duties that it
might make sense to assign two people to this role.The names of the partic-

ular staff who will be assuming each role should be documented.An example
of how to document these roles is depicted in Table 16.2.

In some cases, an organization may have a separate team whose soul
responsibility is to return the primary site back to operational status.This
team usually is referred to as the Reconstitution Team. While operations is
on-going at the alternate site, the Reconstitution Team works at the primary
site cleaning up, repairing equipment, and preparing everything to return to
normal operations so that a clean cut-over back to the original site can be
made.
Levels of Disruption
Disruptions to systems, networks, and major applications occur in varying
degrees of magnitude. In order to clearly communicate the magnitude of a
disruption, it helps to have disruption levels deﬁned up front. By deﬁning dis-
ruption levels up front, it makes it much easier for the Damage Assessment
Coordinator to assess and communicate the type of disruption so that the
recovery team can get prepared.The following levels of disruption serve as
examples for your Contingency Plan:
■
A Limited Disruption consists of a temporary disruption not associated
with damage or loss of assets (e.g., disruption due to a power failure).
■
A Serious Disruption consists of reparable damage to equipment or a
facility that can be resolved by replacing equipment or software (e.g.,
a blown circuit board).
■
A Major Disruption consists of irreparable damage to a facility, or loss
of key personnel, data, or software (e.g., destruction of a computer
room by water or ﬁre).
www.syngress.com
262
Chapter 16 • Developing the Contingency Plan

■
A Catastrophic Disruption consists of irreparable damage to equip-
ment or a facility, or loss of a facility, its assets, or operations staff
(e.g., disruption due to a tornado or a bomb)
You may decide to deﬁne the levels of disruption using different names.
For example, a Level 1 disruption may be used in lieu of Limited Disruption
and a Level 2 disruption may be used in lieu of a Serious Disruption.
Procedures
Your Contingency Plan should contain detailed guidance and procedures for
key restoration and recovery operations. Imagine that a prolonged outage or a
disaster has occurred.You have the backup media in your hand. Now what
should you do with it? With the backup media in hand, you need to be able
to recreate the entire business. Good procedures include low-level ﬁle execu-
tion instructions such as what command line interface (CLI) commands to
run and what graphical user interface (GUI) parameters to click on.The var-
ious types of procedures you should include are described in the following
sections.
Backup and Restoration Procedures
Backup and restoration procedures for restoring systems and major applica-
tions from backup media needs to be thoroughly documented.The proce-
dures should include the name of the off-site storage facility, its address, phone
number, and which employees are authorized to obtain backup media from it.
You’ll want to describe the backup and restoration architecture so that the
reader can understand the backup and recovery process enough to completely
recreate it from your description.The restoration procedures should indicate if
any particular software recovery programs (and their version number and
patch level) are used to recover ﬁles.Are backups done locally on servers or is
the data backed up over the network? Are ﬁles restored over the network or is
ﬁle restoration done locally? If backups are done over the network, what
system is the backup server? Are backup agents deployed on the systems that
are being backed up? All these questions should be answered.
You’ll also need to document the backup rotation schedule. What ﬁle sys-
tems are backed up on what night of the week or day of the month? How
www.syngress.com
Developing the Contingency Plan • Chapter 16
263

often are full backups performed and how often are incremental backups per-
formed? Include the backup schedule in a table.
When ﬁles need to be recovered, what are the commands that are used to
recover these ﬁles? In restoring data, it should be very clear precisely which
commands are to restore one ﬁle, a directory of ﬁles, or an entire ﬁle system.
Should the administrator performing the restore launch a GUI? What should
they click on? It helps to provide screenshots. If the restoration is done using
a command line interface, what are the commands that need to be typed? 
Procedures to Access Off-Site Storage
It’s most often the case that not just anyone can walk into the off-site storage
facility and obtain a copy of the backup media.Typically, the people who are
allowed to access the backup media are authorized in advance.The people
who are authorized to obtain the backup media may need facility access cards
and a PIN to get into the off-site storage facility.
The names of the people who are authorized to obtain backup media
should be documented. It’s also a good idea to document their supervisors’
names in case any one of them are out on vacation, out sick, or have perished
in the disaster.At least two people should have access to the off-site storage
facility and their full contact information needs to be documented.
Operating System Recovery Procedures
Procedures for recovering operating systems should be documented.You’ll
want to indicate whether systems are restored from an image ﬁle, or whether
they should be rebuilt from scratch. If multiple operating systems are used
(e.g., Windows and UNIX), you’ll need multiple procedures. If operating
system procedures are already documented in another document, it is sufﬁ-
cient to simply name the document and attach it as an Appendix. When
naming the document, you need to provide its ofﬁcial name with version and
data.An example of an ofﬁcial document name would be:
Solaris 8.0 Installation and Conﬁguration Guide, Version 2.0,
April 7, 2006
One of the things you’ll want to be sure to document is what size the ﬁle
systems should be.At the time you are trying to recover systems in a hurry is

Chapter 16 • Developing the Contingency Plan

not the time to have to ﬁgure all this out.You may even want to include a
screenshot of the disk partition table.
If a separate document exists on how to harden and lockdown the oper-
ating system, that document name should be recorded as well. It is not sufﬁ-
cient to simply say,“Lock down the operating system to secure it.”All the
operating system hardening procedures need to be documented. If there is a
section in the installation and conﬁguration guide on hardening and securing
the operating system, that is acceptable.
You will need to be sure to include information on auditing records.
Where is auditing information kept? Name the auditing ﬁles and directories
including the full and absolute pathnames.
Application Recovery Procedures
Application recovery procedures should include anything that is required to
restore the major applications once operating systems have been recovered.
This section should include information about what services are supposed to
be running, and how to restore the databases. Database conﬁguration parame-
ters should be listed. Do databases need to be synchronized with other
databases? If all this information already exists in another document, it is
acceptable to simply name that document using its ofﬁcial and formal name
and then attach it as an appendix.
If this information does not already exist, you will need to take the time
to gather it all, and document it.You’ll want to talk to the support staff, devel-
opers, and database administrators.
Connectivity Recovery Procedures
You need to document what sort of connectivity requirements are necessary
to reconnect your systems at an alternate site in the event that moving to an
alternate site becomes necessary. Do your systems and major applications
require any sort of throughput? Are VPNs required? Are dedicated telephone
lines to managed service providers required? Are T-1 lines required? Who are
the current service providers? If systems are simply plugged into an Ethernet
port and obtain their IP addresses from DHCP, that should be documented as
well. If there are requirements to connect your network to any other net-
works, this should be indicated.
www.syngress.com
Developing the Contingency Plan • Chapter 16
265

Part of the connectivity recovery procedures should include documenting
the particulars of important infrastructure ﬁles such as DNS zone maps, mes-
saging server conﬁguration ﬁles, routing tables, and ﬁrewall rule-sets.
Document what ports should be open and closed on the ﬁrewalls. If routers
are included in your Hardware and Software Inventory, then you should either
document the router ACLs, or be able to point to some other document that
stipulates what these ACLs are.
Key Recovery Procedures
A list of what encryption keys will need to be recovered should be docu-
mented. For example, your systems and major applications may use encryp-
tion keys for any of the following reasons:
■
Hash functions in authentication mechanisms
■
Digital signatures
■
File encryption applications
■
Disk encryption applications
■
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) applications
■
Encryption keys for VPNs
■
Wireless encryption keys
You should say what keys are needed and what they are used for.You
should also document where the keys are kept and who has access to them. If
the keys are on the backup tapes, you can simply say that. However, some-
times keys are stored by the systems administrators on separate media. Keys
may even be kept on pieces of paper locked in a safe.
If your infrastructure doesn’t use encryption keys for any reason, simply
say so. It’s better to include a section on key recovery, and then in the section,
say “not applicable,” than to leave the section out completely.
Power Recovery Procedures
In the event of an electrical failure, it is possible to run your infrastructure on
an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for a short length of time. If your cur-
rent operation is reliant on a UPS for any length of time, this should be
www.syngress.com
266
Chapter 16 • Developing the Contingency Plan

described.The type of UPS (make and model number) should described, and
how long your systems can expect to continue to run off of UPS power
should also be noted.
Do you know the power requirements for your systems? What are the
amps and voltage requirements? In order to provide for protection with a
UPS, you need to understand the associated amps and voltage requirements.
Your Contingency Plan should also make note of when the last time the UPS
was tested—provide the date.
Alternatively, if your systems are reliant on a generator, or if a generator
can be brought on site from an outside provider, this should also be docu-
mented. For example, should you require the use of a generator, who would
you call? How long can your systems run on generator power? What sort of
generator will be used? 
Recovering and Assisting Personnel
Don’t forget about the people.Although most of this book describes how to
plan for information technology scenarios, it goes without saying that people
are more important than computers.You should include a section on recov-
ering and assisting personnel.This section should include information on how
to contact local ﬁre, ambulance, and paramedic services. If a particular staff
member is certiﬁed in CPR or ﬁrst aid, this should be noted as well.
Notiﬁcation and Activation
It’s important to deﬁne under what conditions the Contingency Plan will be
activated and how the recovery team and general support staff will be noti-
ﬁed. For example, it might be the case that the Contingency Plan should be
activated only for either a Major or Catastrophic Disruption. Or there could
be a speciﬁc time frame associated with the activation criteria. For example, it
could be that the Contingency Plan is activated if major applications are
unavailable for more than 48 hours. Whatever the criteria is for activating the
Contingency Plan, it should be spelled out and agreed upon ahead of time.The
business owner, in discussions with support staff and the ISSO, should make a
decision ahead of time under what conditions the Contingency Plan should be
activated. Examples of activation criteria are:
www.syngress.com
Developing the Contingency Plan • Chapter 16
267

■
The plan is activated if high priority systems (from BIA) are not
recovered within three hours.
■
The plan is activated if water starts to come through the ceiling.
■
The plan is activated at the CIO’s request.
■
The plan is activated if the military installation comes under hostile
attack.
■
The plan is activated if all the high priority systems fail at the same
time.
■
The plan is activated if the building is bombed.
■
The plan is activated if cyber attacks result in complete corruption of
data.
■
The plan is activated if a denial of service attack continues for more
than seven days.
■
The plan is activated if snow threatens to cause the roof to cave in.
■
The plan is activated if all climate control systems fail for more than
48 hours.
■
The plan is activated if health records cannot be accessed for more
than three days.
■
The plan is activated if a Category 4 or 5 hurricane is scheduled to
hit the location within the next 48 hours.Upon determination that
the plan will be activated, your document should specify how support
staff and the recovery team will be notiﬁed. Will people be called on
cell phones? Will e-mail be sent to BlackBerry devices? If e-mail,
landline telephone, and cell phones are all considered acceptable
methods of contacting staff, the section on notiﬁcation and activation
should speciﬁcally say this. In some environments, where classiﬁed
information is at stake, the method of notiﬁcation can be more
important.

268
Chapter 16 • Developing the Contingency Plan

Line of Succession
A management line of succession should be stipulated in the event that key
personnel are lost in a disaster or cannot be located. Some of these people
might very well have roles on the recovery team. For example a line of suc-
cession might look like the one shown in Figure 16.1.
Figure 16.1 A Management Line of Succession
The line of succession should include names and a primary and alternate
phone number for each person listed.
Service Level Agreements
Are there service level agreements (or memorandums of understanding) that
pertain to the information systems and applications in your C&A package? If
there are, you should include such agreements as an appendix to your
Contingency Plan. If your department or agency uses a managed service
provider, in lieu of a service level agreement there may be contracts.Any
agreements or contracts that stipulate what type of service you should expect
for another organization, department, or company should be attached as an
appendix.
www.syngress.com
Developing the Contingency Plan • Chapter 16
269

Contact Lists
One of the most important pieces of your Contingency Plan is the contact list.
You’ll want include a staff contact list, and contact lists for the vendors that
make the equipment and software listed in your Business Impact Assessment and
Hardware and Software Inventory. If your infrastructure spans two geographic
locations, you’ll want to include phone numbers for the staff in both loca-
tions. Many federal agencies employ contractors that are essential to their
operations. Some of contractors have been on site for years and are more
familiar with the infrastructure than some of the government employees. Be
sure to include contact information for essential contractors in your contact
lists.
Once your Contingency Plan is written, the contact list will probably be
the section you will need to update most often. Staff come and go, and even
for the staff that remains the same, phone numbers change more often than
you’d think. Contacts listed on a Contingency Plan should be updated at least
once every six months. When you are about to submit a new C&A package,
be sure that all the contact lists are up-to-date.
Testing the Contingency Plan
Last but not least, the Contingency Plan should be tested at least once a year,
and the testing date needs to be recorded in the Contingency Plan. Contingency
Plan testing is not that high on the popularity list of C&A activities—there-
fore it is often overlooked. However, it’s almost a given that if your
Contingency Plan is not tested, you will be cited for it by the auditors.
Some organizations perform live failover tests where they cut over their
entire infrastructure to a warm stand-by site, and other organizations simply
do a table-top scenario where a ﬁctional disaster is described and response
activities are played out.You simply need to be able to justify why your
Contingency Plan was tested in a particular fashion.
The higher the level you certify your systems at, the more involved your
Contingency Plan testing should be. For example, if in determining the
Certiﬁcation Level you decided that you were going to certify and accredit
your information systems at a Level 4, auditors will expect to see detailed
www.syngress.com
270
Chapter 16 • Developing the Contingency Plan

information on how you tested the failover of your systems to a live stand-by
site. If you don’t believe such involved Contingency Plan testing is necessary,
and you elected to certify and accredit your systems at a Level 4, you may
want to revisit your reasons for selecting your certiﬁcation level. With a high
C&A level such as a 3 or 4, auditors certainly scrutinize the Contingency Plan
in much more depth.
Auditors look for consistency across documents.A Level 4 C&A will
require highly available and redundant systems, a hot-standby site, and far
more detailed recovery procedures. It’s not reasonable to state that the risk to
your systems is so high that a Level 4 C&A is required, and then not perform
detailed contingency preparations. Similarly, it makes little sense to C&A your
systems at a Level 1 and then state that highly available RAID systems and
hot standbys are required for all the systems listed on your inventory.
Appendices
A Contingency Plan is known for its numerous appendices.The Business
Impact Assessment should always be an appendix of the Contingency Plan.
Other items to include as appendices are:
■
An occupant evacuation plan
■
Standard operating procedures
■
Contact lists
■
Service level agreements or contracts

Introduction
The System Risk Assessment focuses on risks to systems, applications, and facili-
ties.The same risk exposure principles that you learned in Chapter 14 apply
also to systems, networks, and applications. In Chapter 14, I mentioned that a
System Risk Assessment can be thought of as an extension of the Business Risk
Assessment. However, instead of thinking about the business mission, in a
System Risk Assessment you take into consideration the systems and applica-
tions that churn the gears that drive the business.
When performing a System Risk Assessment, consider both technical and
natural threats to applications, systems, or networks.Technical threats are for
the most part invoked by people who act as a threat agent—sometimes inten-
tionally, and sometimes unintentionally. (One could argue that some com-
puter programs act as threat agents; however, for understanding C&A, it’s not
really necessary to debate that here.) Since natural disasters are always unin-
tentional, we think about them in a different light. We don’t have to take into
consideration that a hurricane, ﬂood, or tornado can be intentionally created.
Though natural disasters are not technical, they do pose risks to your systems.
Your System Risk Assessment can be based on either qualitative or quantita-
tive methods, or some of both. Later in this chapter I’ll be explaining the dif-
ferences between the two risk assessment methodologies. Whatever
methodology you use in your System Risk Assessment, you are going to need
to explain your methodology so that the evaluation team will understand how
you obtained your results and your recommendations.
Risk Assessment Creates Focus
When you performed your ST&E, you performed tests on your security con-
trols.You likely found various vulnerabilities as an outcome to the different
tests you performed.The focus on the ST&E is on how to perform tests and
document the results.You’ll notice that the checklist items at the end of
Chapter 12 are mostly a check on the concept,“Were the tests good ones and
did you document the testing process and relevant information correctly?”
The System Risk Assessment creates focus for understanding the effect that
the vulnerabilities discovered from the results of your ST&E will have on
www.syngress.com
276
Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment

your information systems and major applications. Go back and look at the
results of your tests. What do you think the vulnerabilities are? Vulnerabilities
work in concert with threats to create risk.You are going to use your ﬁndings
from the ST&E process to help put together a list of vulnerabilities.An illus-
tration of the System Risk Assessment process is depicted in Figure 17.1.
During the development of the System Risk Assessment, you will:
■Consider results from your ST&E
■Determine your system and application vulnerabilities
■Level your vulnerabilities reported from scanners taking into consider-
ation the importance of the system to the business mission
■Determine the likelihood that the vulnerabilities will be exploited
■Describe your risk assessment methodology
■Determine your risk exposure
■Present your risks in an easy to understand table
■Make decisions on what to do about the risks

Determine Vulnerabilities
Determining vulnerabilities to your information systems is key to keeping
them secure.There are different levels of granularity you should apply in
looking for vulnerabilities.The higher your C&A level, the deeper and more
involved your process should be for determining vulnerabilities. Review the
section called “What are the C&A Levels?” in Chapter 7. Scanning for vul-
nerabilities was recommended for a Level 3 and 4 C&A.Additionally, a pene-
tration test was recommended for C&A Level 4. If you feel that an auditor
may question your decision that your systems warrant a Level 2 C&A (instead
of a Level 3) you can potentially head-off any concerns with auditors by
including the results from a vulnerability assessment even if your agency
doesn’t normally require a vulnerability assessment for a Level 2 C&A.
The tools today that scan for system, network, and application vulnerabili-
ties are very advanced.These tools are indispensable for security risk assess-
ments. Most of the leading vulnerability assessment scanners have teams of
security engineers that are populating the scanner engine on a daily basis with
new signatures, similar to the way anti-virus engines can be loaded with new
anti-virus signatures daily. We talked about those scanners in Chapter 12, and
you may have used some of them when performing your ST&E.
Most vulnerability scanning tools use qualitative rankings and automati-
cally classify risks as high, medium, or low. Figure 17.2 shows an example of
how the popular scanner QualysGuard depicts vulnerabilities.
Figure 17.2 Screenshot from the QualysGuard Security Scanner
278
Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment
www.syngress.com

You should, however, use the stated vulnerability ranking (high, medium,
or low) taken directly from a vulnerability scanning report with caution.You
will want to take into consideration something that does not show up in an
automated vulnerability scanning report; that is, the importance of the system
to the overall business mission.Therefore, in automated scanning tools, vul-
nerability rankings may show up that are inappropriate rankings for your
C&A purposes. For example, if a scanner ranks a vulnerability as high, but it
has been found on a system that has a relatively low importance to the busi-
ness mission, there may be little justiﬁcation to rank the vulnerability as ‘high’
in your System Risk Assessment. Figure 17.3 shows a vulnerability found on a
Microsoft SQL Server with a criticality rating as 4 out of 5, according to the
scanner.
Figure 17.3 Vulnerability Ranking from a Leading Scanner
A criticality rating of 4 out of 5 sounds fairly signiﬁcant. However, if this
database has been purged of all data and is about to be decommissioned, and
was used only to store the online cafeteria menu, then it probably isn’t as signif-
icant of a vulnerability as it appears to be.Therefore, once you have a vulnera-
bility assessment report in hand that came from an automated scanner, you
should go through it and review each reported vulnerability, and then make a
decision on the ranking of the vulnerability that should actually be applied
based on the importance of the system.The more important the system is to
the agency, the greater the severity of the loss. I refer to the process of reevalu-
ating and reclassifying vulnerabilities found by automated scanners as “leveling
the vulnerabilities.”You may decide that many of the vulnerabilities in fact
should retain the same risk classiﬁcation reported by your scanner, and that
others merit lowering or increasing their rank. Create a summary list of all the
vulnerabilities from network and system scanning, and your ST&E process, level
the vulnerabilities, and then create a ﬁnal vulnerability list. Use the ﬁnal “lev-
eled” value when you determine your risk exposure.

Threats
A threat is something that subjects an organization to risk by acting upon a
weakness (or a vulnerability) to create risk. It’s important to understand fun-
damental concepts on threats because when you present the risks, you will use
this understanding to justify and make recommendations on whether or not
you think risks should be mitigated, accepted, or transferred.
Threats can lead to security incidents. Refer to Table 11.2 to review some
of the more common types of security incidents. In some cases, a threat might
also be deﬁned as a security incident. For example, a denial of service attack
might be thought of as both a threat and a security incident. Don’t spin your
wheels trying to ﬁgure out if something is a threat, or an incident. Check to
see if your agency may have speciﬁc guidelines on threats that they’d like you
to follow.
For C&A purposes, the threats to take into consideration are:
■
Threats initiated by people
■
Threats initiated by computers (or other network devices)
■
Threats from natural disasters
Threats Initiated by People
It is easy to understand how a hackers or cyber criminals can intentionally
threaten your systems. However, threats can be caused by unintentional
human errors as well.An untrained ﬁrewall engineer could pose a threat to
your systems and networks by accidentally conﬁguring a ﬁrewall rule to open
a port instead of closing it.The number of ways that your own staff can unin-
tentionally create threats to your systems is inﬁnite, which is one of the rea-
sons that such a large number of checks, balances, and accountability features
are built into systems (e.g., separate accounts, logging capabilities, separation of
roles and responsibilities).
Threats Initiated by Computers or Devices
Sometimes, devices themselves can create threats and even security incidents.
Years ago I worked at a networking company where there were various
www.syngress.com
280
Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment

models of Hewlett Packard printers that on various occasions sprayed the net-
works with enough broadcast packets to create a denial-of-service attack to
the other systems on the network. We thought someone was attacking the
network until we put a network analyzer on some of the network segments
and traced the broadcast storm back to printers that had buggy software in
them.
Threats from Natural Disasters
Many IT professionals, in the past, have not given enough credence to the
possibility of natural disasters. However, recent natural disasters such as
Hurricane Katrina, which took place in the New Orleans area in August
2005, have raised the awareness of natural disasters.Threats from natural disas-
ters include, but are not limited to:
■
Floods and heavy rains
■
Earthquakes
■
Fire
■
Hurricanes and wind
■
Snow and ice
■
Lightning
■
Tornadoe
■
Volcanoes
■
Tsunamis, typhoons, and tidal waves
When you take natural disasters into consideration, you can use the same
principles that you use when you consider threats to systems and applications.
You need to know how likely it is that a natural disaster will occur, and esti-
mate the impact that it will have on your operations.You can use the fol-
lowing URLs to do more research on natural disasters, their anticipated
impact, and the likelihood that they will occur in a given area:

Qualitative Risk Assessment
When you use relative concepts to determine risk exposure, you are using
qualitative risk analysis. Relative classiﬁcation systems compare one compo-
nent to another, allowing you to rank a classiﬁcation as high, medium, or low.
It’s useful to rank risk exposures caused by vulnerabilities so you can more
easily make decisions on what to do about them.
You can use the same qualitative risk exposure matrix listed in Table 14.4.
A more simpliﬁed version of that table is shown in Table 17.1. Once you have
established what the vulnerabilities are, you need to determine their likeli-
hood of being exploited, and the severity of the loss.You determine the risk
exposure by multiplying the severity of the loss by the likelihood.As a
reminder:
Risk Exposure = Likelihood x Impact
R ( E ) = P ( L ) x S ( L )
P ( L ) = Probability of loss (likelihood)
S (L) = Severity of loss (impact)

Quantitative Risk Assessment
Quantitative risk assessment associates loss with a ﬁnancial value.The goal of
understanding ﬁnancial loss is to give you more information in making deci-
sions about the procurement and implementation of safeguards. Quantitative
risk assessment is essential if you want to perform cost beneﬁt analysis to
ﬁgure out if implementing a particular safeguard is ﬁnancially worth the cost.
If the anticipated annual loss is less than the annualized cost of the safeguard,
then it is usually not worth it to implement the safeguard.
I will use a natural disaster example to show you how to ﬁgure out ﬁnan-
cial loss based on quantitative risk assessment methods. If you look at Figure
17.4, you will see that in Florida alone there are different probabilities
throughout the state for hurricanes with wind speeds greater than 100 knots.
To calculate the risk of a hurricane occurring in Miami, Florida, you need to
understand the likelihood of one occurring each year. If a hurricane occurs
once every 20 years (1 out of 20), then it has a 5 percent chance of occurring
yearly since 1/20 = .05, which equals 5 percent.

Performing a System Risk Assessment • Chapter 17
283

Figure 17.4 Probabilities of Hurricanes in Florida Localities
Source: U.S. Geological Survey
The frequency of Florida hurricanes with wind speeds greater than or
equal to 100 knots is mapped in terms of the probability of occurrence
during a 20-year exposure window.These probabilistic estimates, based on
1006 years of observations, illustrate that hurricanes with 100 knot winds
occur more frequently in southern Florida, and gradually decrease in fre-
quency towards northern Florida.1
The threat frequency (or likelihood) for natural disasters can be calculated
by using an Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).An ARO is a constant
number that tells you how often a threat might occur each year.AROs can be
broken down into subvalues known as Standard Annual Frequency Estimates
(SAFE) and Local Annual Frequency Estimates (LAFE).The SAFE value is
the number of times a speciﬁc threat is expected to occur annually in a large
geographic region such as North America.The LAFE value is the number of
times a speciﬁc threat can be expected to occur annually in a smaller, local
geographic region such as Miami, Florida. For the purpose of C&A, it is more
appropriate to use LAFE values. (If we were going to C&A all the systems in
www.syngress.com
284
Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment

North America in one C&A package, we might use SAFE values for that.
Such a C&A package of course would be a Sisyphean exercise.) 
ARO values (SAFE and LAFE) typically are represented as rational num-
bers, or as a decimal value as shown in Table 17.2. (A rational number is a
number that can be expressed equivalently as a fraction.)

The reduction in value of an information system from one threat (or inci-
dent) is referred to as a Single Loss Expectancy (SLE). If one of the systems in
your hardware and software inventory is valued at $100,000, and a hurricane
destroys 90 percent of it, the value of the system has been reduced by
$90,000, which is the SLE.
SLE = Original Total Cost – Remaining Value
SLE $90,000 = $100,000 – $10,000
It is possible that instead of a hurricane, a hacker might destroy 90% of the
system and the same SLE formula would apply. Once you know the SLE, you
can determine an Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE).ALE is a risk exposure stan-
dard that is computed by multiplying the probability of a loss from a threat
(or incident) by the reduction in value of the information system..

Performing a System Risk Assessment • Chapter 17

NOTE
ALE is a metric that was developed by the National Bureau of Standards
in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the National Bureau of Standards became
part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
ALE values are useful to perform cost beneﬁt analysis so you can ﬁgure
out if spending money on a particular safeguard is worth it or not.ALE values
can be determined for any type of threat whether it is a threat launched by a
cyber criminal, or a natural disaster.To determine the ALE for this same
$100,000 system, use the formula:
ALE = LAFE x SLE
R (E) = P (L) x S (L)
The LAFE value is the probability of potential loss, or P (L).The SLE, or
the loss from a one-time occurrence of the incident, is the severity of the loss,
S (L).
If the system is located in Miami, Florida and hurricanes have a 5%
chance of occurring yearly:
ALE = .05 x $90,000 = $4,500
Every year, the one information system located in Miami, Florida is being
exposed to an annual loss expectancy of $4,500 from hurricanes alone. If
there are 1000 systems at this facility in Miami, all with the same ALE, that
would come to a whopping cumulative ALE of $4,500,000. Even if moving
the facility to a different location costs $1,000,000, in this case it would be
worth it since the safeguard (e.g., the move) would be far less expensive than
the Annual Loss Expectancy.
An additional resource that explains quantitative risk assessment is an
article titled “Security Scanning is not Risk Analysis” in the Intranet Journal
(www.intranetjournal.com/articles/200207/se_07_14_02a.html).

Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment

Qualitative versus 
Quantitative Risk Assessment
When you use ALE values to determine cost beneﬁt analysis, you are per-
forming quantitative risk analysis. When you use high, moderate, and low
rankings that are relative to each other, you are performing qualitative risk
analysis. Whether the threat is a hurricane or a hacker, you can use either
method to determine risk exposure.There are advantages and disadvantages to
both methods of determining risk.
Whether you use qualitative or quantitative methods to determine your
risk exposure, you should state in your System Risk Assessment which method-
ology you are using and why.Your reasons for selecting one methodology
over the other might be straightforward and simple. Perhaps you decided to
use qualitative risk assessment because that’s what your agency requires.To use
quantitative risk assessment effectively, you need to know the current dollar
value of an asset. If your agency does not track that kind of information,
quantitative risk assessment presents many challenges. If you are able to use
quantitative risk assessment, it is an indispensable tool for determining
whether an expensive safeguard is worth purchasing or not.
Qualitative risk assessment has the following attributes:
■
A faster process
■
Emphasizes descriptions
■
Findings are simple and expressed in relative terms
■
Values are perceived values, not actual values
■
Requires less training
Quantitative risk assessment has the following attributes:
■
Very time intensive
■
Yields results that are ﬁnancial in nature
■
Used for cost beneﬁt analysis
■
Good for justifying the procurement of safeguards
■
Requires tracking the ﬁnancial value of assets
www.syngress.com
Performing a System Risk Assessment • Chapter 17
287

Today, most C&A packages use qualitative risk assessment methods simply
because it’s usually faster to perform than quantitative methods. However, as
C&A programs evolve over time, it is likely that quantitative methods will gain
more traction.The more expensive the safeguards are that your agency is taking
into consideration, the more valuable quantitative risk assessment can be.
Present the Risks
In order to make decisions on risks, you need to present the risks in an easy
to follow table. For a qualitative risk assessment, create columns for the fol-
lowing ﬁelds:
■
ID number
■
Vulnerability name
■
Description
■
Likelihood
■
Impact
■
Risk Exposure
■
Recommendation
Some risk assessments also include columns for security control identiﬁers,
policy and oversight citations, threat descriptions, CVE numbers (see
http://cve.mitre.org), and other related information. Find out if your agency
already has a template that they’d like you to use for your risk table. For a
quantitative risk assessment, you should also create a column for ALE.Table
17.3 shows an example of an easy-to-follow format to present your risks.

Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment

Make Decisions
Once you have gathered the pertinent facts about the risk exposure to your
systems, you are armed with all the right information to formulate decisions.
One of the objectives of the decisions that you make will be to balance the
impact of threats with safeguards. Safeguards mitigate risk; however, there is a
cost involved in applying safeguards.The cost of safeguards should not only
include the up-front cost of procuring the safeguard, but also the yearly main-
tenance costs of implementing it. For example, a set of ﬁrewalls may cost
$30,000 to purchase and install, but it also requires the hiring of a full time
ﬁrewall administrator. Be sure to consider these hourly costs in labor rates as
well as in the cost of a product.
Mitigating risks means reducing them to acceptable levels, which of
course is different than mitigating risks at all costs. Most information tech-
nology risks can be reduced. Sometimes a high risk item can be reduced by
simply checking a box in a GUI to enable a particular security feature. Other
times, reducing a risk can be complex, very involved, and very expensive.
Since there is usually a price to pay for mitigating risks, the price is some-
thing that perceptive IT managers will want to take into consideration.
Sometimes that price might be only an hour of a systems administrator’s time.
Other times it could be hundreds of hours of many systems administrators’
time, or it may mean purchasing an enterprise product that costs several mil-
lion dollars. When it comes to reducing risks, one of the ﬁrst questions your
business owner and ISSO should be asking is,“What will it cost?”
Consistent with the options in Chapter 14, your options are either to
accept the risk, transfer the risk, or mitigate the risk. Generally speaking, high
risk items that don’t cost much should always be mitigated. Moderate risk
items that don’t cost much should also be mitigated. Low risk items may not
be worth reducing at all, particularly if it costs a lot to do so.
Checklist
Upon completion of the System Risk Assessment, use the following checklist to
make sure you haven’t forgotten anything:
■
Have you explained your risk assessment methodology?
www.syngress.com
Performing a System Risk Assessment • Chapter 17
291

■
Did you integrate ﬁndings from your ST&E into your System Risk
Assessment?
■
Did you take into consideration natural disasters?
■
Are the risks presented in an easy-to-follow table?
■
Did you make recommendations on what to do about the risks?
■
Did you provide an explanation to justify each recommendation?

Chapter 17 • Performing a System Risk Assessment

Summary
The fundamental concepts for your System Risk Assessment should be similar
to the concepts you used to develop your Business Risk Assessment. However,
the vulnerabilities that you discuss will likely be more technical and more
speciﬁc. Include enough information about the vulnerability so that the eval-
uation team can understand what the weakness is. Make a recommendation
on whether to mitigate the risk, accept the risk, or transfer the risk and justify
your recommendation. If you don’t list any vulnerabilities and claim your sys-
tems, major applications, and networks don’t have any, the evaluation team
will likely come to the conclusion that you don’t know what you’re doing.
You can always ﬁnd some vulnerabilities. Listing vulnerabilities and making
intelligent decisions about them shows more savvy than claiming that there
are none. Don’t forget to take into consideration natural disasters—particu-
larly if your agency has ofﬁces and systems in areas that have a history of
weather-related disasters.

Introduction
A Conﬁguration Management Plan shows evidence that software changes,
including code, operating systems settings, and application conﬁgurations, are
known and tracked.The settings and conﬁgurations that are known and
tracked should include the technical security controls.The Conﬁguration
Management Plan is a living document and should be updated through the life
cycle of the systems that it references.
Some agencies may have one global Conﬁguration Management Plan for the
entire agency, and other agencies may develop Conﬁguration Management Plans
at the bureau or project level. If your organization actively contributes to an
agencywide Conﬁguration Management Plan by sending in regular updates, you
can likely use that Conﬁguration Management Plan for your C&A package.
Before starting to write a Conﬁguration Management Plan, ﬁnd out if your
group or department already participates in updating an existing one. If one
does exist, you can use it for your C&A package as long as assets from your
hardware and software inventory of your C&A package are named and
tracked in that plan. If you are unsure if an existing Conﬁguration Management
Plan will be acceptable, schedule a meeting with the evaluation team and pre-
sent them with your questions.They should be able to give you guidance
before you start working on your Conﬁguration Management Plan as to what
they consider to be acceptable or not.
Establish Deﬁnitions
To ensure that the conﬁguration management terminology that you use in
your Conﬁguration Management Plan will have consistent deﬁnitions to those
used by the evaluation team, establish your deﬁnitions up front and list them
near the beginning of your document.Table 18.1 includes some commonly
used conﬁguration management terms. It’s possible that these terms may be
deﬁned slightly differently by different agencies. What’s important is that these
terms mean the same thing to you as they do to the evaluation team. If your
agency already has conﬁguration management terms deﬁned through policies,
use them and republish them in your Conﬁguration Management Plan.

Describe Assets Controlled by the Plan
One of the ﬁrst things you’ll want to include in your Conﬁguration
Management Plan is a description of the hardware and software assets that the
Conﬁguration Management Plan pertains to.You can obtain this information
www.syngress.com
Developing a Conﬁguration Management Plan • Chapter 18
297

quickly from your Hardware and Software Inventory.You should also include a
brief system description about the system or major application that the
Conﬁguration Management Plan is associated with. Using the same system
description that you included in your Hardware and Software Inventory is per-
fectly acceptable.The Conﬁguration Management Plan should be able to stand
alone as its own document, which is why it is necessary to include this back-
ground information, even though it is somewhat redundant when considering
the C&A package as a whole.Always remember that most of the documents
that you work on are not only parts of the C&A package you are developing,
but are working documents that the team managing the system uses on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis as well.
Describe the 
Conﬁguration Management System
Most agencies, bureaus, or their departments have a conﬁguration manage-
ment system.The conﬁguration management system is the storage and
retrieval mechanism for baseline conﬁgurations, documents, products, and
code. Some conﬁguration management systems might be simple databases,
and others might be products designed speciﬁcally for conﬁguration manage-
ment tasks. Whatever system your agency uses, describe it, make note of who
uses the system, and note who has access to it. If a particular product or open
source tool is used to perform conﬁguration management, you will want to
note the product and vendor name or the open source download location. Be
sure to include the version numbers of software that’s installed on the conﬁg-
uration management system.
Additionally, you should describe the security controls that protect the
configuration management system. Include discussion about the authentica-
tion mechanism, access to the system, perimeter protection (firewalls and
routers), and host- or network-based intrusion detection systems that are
used.
Finally, you should be sure to include information about how the conﬁg-
uration management system is backed up. Who is responsible for the backups?
What programs are used to perform the backups? Where is backup media
stored and who has access to it?

Chapter 18 • Developing a Conﬁguration Management Plan

Deﬁne Roles and Responsibilities
One of the ﬁrst items you’ll need to discuss is to identify the folks who are
actually performing conﬁguration management. Describe their roles and
responsibilities and list their names and contact information.Typical conﬁgu-
ration management responsibilities are listed in Table 18.2. If you have a small
agency, it is possible that some of these roles are consolidated into one role.
Additionally, it is possible that the names of the roles found in Table 18.2
could vary from agency to agency.

Establish Baselines
Discuss your conﬁguration management process for establishing baselines.A
baseline identiﬁes and deﬁnes all the conﬁguration items that make up a
system at a particular moment in time. Baselining is a formal process, which
occurs infrequently.The conﬁguration management system should always have
the current updated baseline available for review.There are three types of
baselines:
■
Functional Baseline
■
Software Baseline
■
Product Baseline
www.syngress.com
Developing a Conﬁguration Management Plan • Chapter 18
301

A Functional Baseline contains all agreed-upon documentation for an
information system or major application. Each document should be assigned a
document ID number and include a publication date and the author name(s).
A Software Baseline contains all of a system’s software.A Software Baseline
includes the source code for each software conﬁguration item and a software
baseline document that provides a listing of the software and any other perti-
nent information such as developer, version, or software libraries.A Software
Baseline locks in a version, build number, or release number at a particular
moment in time.
A Product Baseline is the combination of the Functional Baseline and the
Software Baseline.A product is not a product without documentation that
explains how it works.A product could be an application that has been devel-
oped in-hour or a commercial off-the-shelf application. Whether the product
has been developed in house or not, it should include installation and conﬁg-
uration information pertinent to the actual implementation. For a product
developed in-house, the conﬁguration management system should include the
design and requirements documents. It’s not necessary to include design
requirements for commercial off-the-shelf products since companies will
likely not give that out.
If any license keys are used in the baselines, you will want to state how
license keys are archived and preserved.You should also include the agency
security policies against using unlicensed software. What method is used to
ensure that software license keys are not installed on systems that have not
paid for the keys?
CM Analysts and Coordinators should establish new baselines at the end
of the design and build phases in the system development life cycle and again
at the end of the test phase.All baselines should be entered into the conﬁgu-
ration management system. New baselines should be continuously sent to the
Director of Conﬁguration Management, or the designated individual that
updates the conﬁguration management system.
Change Control Process
The Conﬁguration Management Plan should clearly describe the conﬁguration
management process.You’ll need to explain how conﬁguration changes are
www.syngress.com
302
Chapter 18 • Developing a Conﬁguration Management Plan

requested, approved, disapproved, and implemented. Sometimes inserting a
ﬂow chart of the conﬁguration management process is the best way to show
how it works. Figure 18.1 depicts an example of a change control process
ﬂowchart.
Change Request Procedures
Discuss the change request procedures in the Conﬁguration Management Plan.
Change requests typically go through the following phases:
■
Initiation
■
Review and analysis
■
Approval or disapproval
■
Notiﬁcation that change will or will not occur (including the date
for change)
■
Implementation of change
■
Closure of the change request
Change requests usually are initiated by ﬁlling out either a paper form, a
web form, or sending in an e-mail request.You’ll want to describe what the
procedure is in your agency for initiating a change request. If there are partic-
ular timeframes that the initiator can anticipate as the change request passes
through steps 1 through 6, you should indicate those time frames in the
Conﬁguration Management Plan.
Emergency Change Request Procedures
Your agency should have an expedited change request process for emergency
change requests.You’ll want to ﬁnd out what that process is and devote a
small section to it in your Conﬁguration Management Plan.There are often valid
reasons for emergency change requests such as new code to ﬁx a bug that is
hampering operations, or installing a patch to mitigate a security vulnerability.

Change Request Parameters
Each change request should have certain parameters that are required when
submitting an initial change request.An example of a Change Control Request
Form that includes typical change request parameters is found in Figure 18.1.
Figure 18.2 provides a ﬂowchart depicting the Change Control process.
Conﬁguration Control Board
The Conﬁguration Control Board (CCB) is the forum where change requests
should be discussed.An agency may have multiple CCBs, each acting on
behalf of its own business unit. In your Conﬁguration Management Plan, you
should identify the key information about the CCB that is relevant to the
hardware and software assets for your particular C&A package as well as gen-
eral information about how the CCB operates. Questions that you should
answer in your discussion about the CCB are:
■
When do CCB meetings take place?
■
Who runs the CCB meetings?
■
Who are the members of the CCB?
■
Are there CCB members from the C&A package’s business owner’s
department?
■
Is information about the CCB posted on an internal Web site that
you can point to?
■
Does the CCB generate a monthly report?
■
Where can monthly CCB reports be found?
■
Is there a group e-mail address for the CCB members?
■
Is there an e-mail address for submitting change requests to the
CCB?
■
Is there a Web form for submitting change requests to the CCB?

Conﬁguration Management Director uses any sort of checklist to collate ﬁnd-

often the audit interviews take place.
Conﬁguration and 
Change Management Tools
There are numerous tools made to assist with conﬁguration management
duties and track version changes to code and documents. Some of these tools
are licensable products and others are well-respected open source tools. Some
products that are marketed as Business Continuity Tools offer useful conﬁgu-

Summary
A Conﬁguration Management Plan demonstrates that your organization under-
stands how to handle change, and can track all changes to your system
including the settings for security controls.An effective Conﬁguration
Management Plan provides audit trails and traceability as to why change has
occurred.The baselines stored in the conﬁguration management system
enable your organization to understand what the given conﬁguration of your
systems and major applications are at any given point in time.Tracking con-
ﬁguration changes and requests enables support staff to better troubleshoot
security incidents since they will have a known good conﬁguration for refer-
ence if the integrity of the current conﬁguration ever comes into question.

Introduction
The System Security Plan is probably the most important document you will
prepare for your C&A Package. If the evaluation team is pressed for time
(which sometimes happens) and elects to scrutinize only one document in
your entire C&A package, skimming through the others, it is likely that that
the one document they will sift through with a ﬁne-toothed comb will be
the System Security Plan. Some federal agencies use a System Security
Authorization Agreement (SSAA) in lieu of a System Security Plan.The SSAA
historically has been used by agencies that make use of the DITSCAP C&A
methodology.
The System Security Plan sums up the security requirements, architecture,
and control mechanisms in one document. In the System Security Plan, you
should also list pointers to the related C&A documents that are part of the
same C&A package in your System Security Plan. For example, you can say,
“Contingency Planning is described in the <System Name> Contingency Plan,
Revision 3,April 7, 2006.”Though you don’t want to rewrite the other C&A
documents in the System Security Plan, you will want to restate certain pieces
of key information contained in other documents. For example, it is worth
restating the C&A Level at which the C&A package is going to be sub-
mitted—the level that you calculated using the methodology described in
Chapter 6.
Laws, Regulations, and Policies
Near the beginning of your System Security Plan, you should include a list of
all laws, regulations, and policies with which systems that are undergoing
C&A are expected to comply.Your agency probably has hundreds of security
policies.You don’t need to republish all of them. Simply state the formal
policy document name and the location where this document can be found;
for example, <Agency>, Security Policies, Revision 4, October 27, 2006.The only
reason to list policies singularly is if they are not contained in the overriding
agency security policy document.
Likely your agency is responsible for compliance with many laws and reg-
ulations other than FISMA. List them all alphabetically. Here is an example of
www.syngress.com
312
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

a list of laws, regulations, and policies similar to what you may want to
include in your System Security Plan.
An Example of Laws, Regulations, and Security Policy Descriptions
The systems described in this System Security Plan are subject to the laws, reg-
ulations, and policies set forth by the federal government as follows:
■
Computer Security Act of 1987
■
Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001
■
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002
■
Government Management Reform Act (GMRA) of 1994
■
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-7)
■
Information Technology Management Reform Act (Clinger-Cohen
Act)
■
OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information
Resources
Additionally, the systems described in this System Security Plan are subject
to the following agency security policies:
■
PIV Security Policy 1000.67, June 14, 2006
■
Security Enrollment Account Policy, 1000.94, September 04, 2006
■
<Agency Name>, Security Policies, Revision 4, October 27, 2006
The System Description
The system description section of the System Security Plan should describe, in
prose, all the components of the information systems or major application as
deﬁned by the accreditation boundary as discussed in Chapter 7. For the pur-
pose of the system description, the “system” refers to everything included in
the C&A package—the whole ball of wax. Depending on how you deﬁne
your information system, it could consist of anything from one computer to a
large infrastructure of multiple computers and applications. Each C&A
package is owned by the business owner (see Chapter 3).Therefore, if major
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
313

applications and general support systems have different business owners, this
means that there should be different C&A packages. If the general support
systems have the same business owner as the major applications, you can, in
fact, include all these items together in one C&A package.
A business owner can choose to include as many, or as few, major applica-
tions or general support systems into a C&A package as desired. Sometimes
deciding where to draw the line in the sand on what to include and not
include in your system description takes some thought and various decisions
will need to be made. Many of these decisions were likely made when you
put together the Hardware and Software Inventory. However, since you have not
yet submitted your C&A package for review, you do have the liberty to go
back and revise your Hardware and Software Inventory by taking systems out and
adding new ones, if while writing your system description you notice that
adjustments should be made. Keep in mind that if you add new systems,
applications, or network devices, it could affect the C&A level that you origi-
nally calculated if for example you add a system that is high sensitivity to a
level one or two C&A package. If you ﬁnd that you need to add a new
device or system while writing your System Security Plan, you will need to
make sure that the addition is reﬂected in all your C&A documents. If the
system or device was never tested, you will need to test it and include those
results in your ST&E.
In your description, you should be sure to differentiate between general
support systems and major applications. General support systems are those sys-
tems that provide the underlying infrastructure support for major applications,
including ﬁle and print services.
Major applications usually get installed on top of operating systems and
provide clearly deﬁned functions. For example, some applications have server
components and agent components that run on different systems.According
to NIST Special Publication 800-18, Revision 1, February 2006:
Major applications are systems that perform clearly deﬁned
functions for which there are readily identiﬁable security con-
siderations and needs (e.g., an electronic funds transfer
system).

Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

System Boundaries
In deﬁning your system boundaries, you need to ﬁgure out where your
system begins and ends.You have some ﬂexibility in doing this, but it should
all be based on logic. For example, possible system boundaries could be
deﬁned by such things as:
■
Windows domains
■
Solaris NIS+ objects
■
LDAP directories
■
UNIX netgroups
■
The DMZ
■
Firewalls 
■
Routers and switches
■
VPNs
■
VLANs
■
Network segments
■
Major applications
■
Business mission
■
Business ownership and management
This list should not be considered exhaustive by any means.There may
very well be other devices, whether logical or physical, that can be appropri-
ately described as system boundaries.
When describing system boundaries, keep in mind that your description
should be inclusive of, and should discuss the systems you described in your
Hardware and Software Inventory (see Chapter 6). Systems delineated by your
boundary deﬁnition should be owned by the business owner that owns your
C&A project.You want to be careful not to take perceived ownership of
another business owner’s systems by going into lengthy detail about systems
not included in your inventory in your system description. However, it is
okay to refer to systems owned by other business owners for the purpose of
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
315

describing your own systems. For example, you could say,“The major applica-
tions reside on network segment 21, which is bounded by Cisco ﬁrewall #2
and Check Point ﬁrewall #6. Both ﬁrewalls are owned by the Information
Systems group and are reviewed in a separate C&A package.”
It can be helpful to describe your boundaries in terms of network zones.
Network zones are segments of network infrastructure that are separated by
ﬁrewalls. Different network zones often have different security levels associ-
ated with them. However, sometimes different network zones are separate
from each other simply to separate the administration of duties between two
different business units or administrative groups. Since you should include a
network topology map of the assets included in your C&A package, it is
useful to describe the network zones and to label these zones on your net-
work topology map.A simple, yet effective way of describing network zones is
found in Table 19.1.
Table 19.1 A Sample Description of Network Zones
Zone Number
Zone Name
Description
0
Public Zone
Open to the public. Subject to privacy 
regulations. 
1
Internal Zone
Not open to the public. Protected internal
network. 
2
High Security 
Extra secure internal network (e.g., 
Zone
classiﬁed network).
3
Unattached 
Not connected to other zones (e.g., 
Zone
a test network). 
System Mission
You will also want to describe the general mission of the systems in your
system description.You should have a good idea of the mission at hand from
having worked previously on your Business Risk Assessment. Since the evalua-
tion team will be looking for consistency across your documents, using some
of the same mission terminology that you used in your Business Risk
Assessment is a good idea.
www.syngress.com
316
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

You’ll want to state whether the items undergoing C&A are general sup-
port systems, major applications, or both.A general support system typically
consists of parts of the network infrastructure used to support general opera-
tions of your business.According to NIST Special Publication 800-18, Guide for
Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems:
A general support system is interconnected information
resources under the same direct management control which
shares common functionality. A general support system nor-
mally includes hardware, software, information, data, appli-
cations, communications, facilities, and people and provides
support for a variety of users and/or applications.
For a general support system, the mission could be to provide a platform
for major applications. It also could be simply to provide a communications
network for e-mail, ﬁle sharing, development, and collaboration.There may
be multiple missions and if there are, you should describe all of them. In fact,
most general support systems likely have multiple functions.
Major applications are most often software applications that reside on top
of operating systems of general support systems. However, it is altogether pos-
sible that a major application could also consist of hardware devices. Unlike
general support systems, major applications usually have one primary purpose.
For example, a smart card system usually has both software and hardware
devices.The hardware devices for a smart card system could include card
readers, card issuing systems, and the cards themselves.According to NIST
Special Publication 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information
Technology Systems:
A major application might comprise many individual pro-
grams and hardware, software, and telecommunications
components. These components can be a single software
application or a combination of hardware/software focused
on supporting a speciﬁc mission-related function. A major
application may also consist of multiple individual applica-
tions if all are related to a single mission function (e.g., pay-
roll or personnel).

Data Flows
You are going to want to describe how the data ﬂows from one place to
another in your system descriptions. If ﬁles are transferred either manually or
automatically by a scheduler, you’ll want to list the ﬁle names and state the
times and under what conditions they are transferred. In Table 16.1, data
sources and destinations were listed.You are going to want to describe those
data sources and destinations more fully as part of the system description. In
each of the examples (each row) listed in Table 16.1, you should describe in
prose how the data gets from its source to its destination.You may want to
indicate a legend on your network topology map with numbers or letters so
that you can more easily describe the data ﬂows.An example of data ﬂow
prose used in conjunction with the ﬁctitious network segment shown in
Figure 19.1 is the following:
System administrators in Dallas use an automated cron job to
distribute patches from the Dallas datacenter to the Boston
datacenter via a Cisco VPN every Friday between 5 and 6pm
CST so that the Boston facility can receive a copy of tested
patches from the Patch Master system in Dallas.

Security Requirements and Controls

the security requirements.The requirements describe the need, and the con-

trols satisfy that need.As you recall from Chapters 8 and 12, for the purposes
of C&A, there are three types of security controls: management controls,
operational controls, and technical controls.The purpose of these controls is
to meet the security requirements by preserving the Conﬁdentiality, Integrity,
and Availability of the systems and applications.
In describing the security controls, you’ll want to differentiate between
security controls currently in place, and those controls that are planned for
future implementation. In C&A, you get credit for planning. If you don’t have
particular controls in place yet, but they will be implemented in two months,
you should document that in your System Security Plan. Keep in mind though
that if the System Security Plan says that controls have been planned, your busi-
ness owner and ISSO will be on the hook for actually implementing the con-
trols.Auditors at some point in the future may verify that the “planned
controls” have been put into place.Therefore, if controls have not been
planned, don’t say that they have been.
NOTE
The National Institute of Standards and Technology has done a lot of
research on, and has published much information on security controls in
NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems, February, 2005, found at
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53/SP800-53.pdf.
In March 2006, the National Institute of Standards and Technology pub-
lished a document titled FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements
for Federal Information and Information Systems (FIPS PUB 200). NIST Special
Publications are generally thought of as guidance, but the Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) series of publications are considered mandatory.
The FIPS standards, however, point you to the Special Publications, and sec-
tion 8 of FIPS PUB 200 says:
Federal agencies must meet the minimum security require-
ments as deﬁned herein through the use of the security con-
trols in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-53,
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
319

Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
Systems, as amended.
Therefore, you are on the hook to use the recommended security controls
in Special Publication 800-53 as they apply to your information systems. FIPS
PUB 200 can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/
ﬁps/ﬁps200/FIPS-200-ﬁnal-march.pdf#search=%22FIPS%20200%22.
It is certainly possible that not all the guidance in Special Publication 800-
53 will apply to the systems and applications listed in your Hardware and
Software Inventory. Certainly you have ﬂexibility. In fact, FIPS PUB 200 fur-
ther states:
Organizations must meet the minimum security requirements
in this standard by selecting the appropriate security controls
and assurance requirements as described in NIST Special
Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems.
To understand what security controls are appropriate, you need to under-
stand your security design requirements, which should be based on your
agency requirements.Your agency security requirements should be docu-
mented in a manual of IT Baseline Security Requirements—often referred to
in federal agencies as the BLSRs.Though I certainly can’t verify that all agen-
cies have BLSRs, there is a strong chance that yours does.The security
requirements for the design of the items undergoing C&A should be based
on a subset of these overriding BLSRs. It is altogether possible that the evalu-
ation team may ask to see a copy of the security requirements for the systems
undergoing C&A.You should be able to refer to a formal and separate docu-
ment containing these requirements in the System Security Plan. For example,
you could say:
This System Security Plan describes the security controls
established to comply with the security requirements set
forth in Federal Information System (FIS) Security
Requirements, Revision 2.0, June 10, 2006.
It certainly will not hurt your C&A package to attach the security
requirements as an appendix to the System Security Plan.
www.syngress.com
320
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

It is altogether possible that for some legacy systems, the original security
requirements cannot be located.Although that certainly is not an optimal sit-
uation, for the purpose of C&A, you may have to temporarily put the cart
before the horse and document ex post facto what you believe were the
intended security requirements. Documenting security requirements can be
very time consuming; be sure to schedule plenty of time to create ex post facto
security requirements. If you are trying to develop a System Security Plan at
the same time, you may need to enlist another resource to help you out.
Examples of security requirements are found in Tables 19.2, 19.3, and 19.4.
For every security requirement, you should be able to map a security con-
trol to it that satisﬁes that requirement.The test results that you documented
in your ST&E (see Chapter 12) should have tested the controls to see if they
met the requirements. In theory, by the time you are writing the System
Security Plan, your requirements, controls, and the implementation of the con-
trols should already be in place such that your System Security Plan becomes
merely an exercise in documentation. However, when doing C&A, it’s alto-
gether possible that the order of events has not been as efﬁcient as you may
have hoped. Don’t despair—since you have not yet submitted your C&A
package, you can go back and make modiﬁcations to your ST&E while you
are developing your System Security Plan.You may also need to add in a
requirement, and have the ISSO expeditiously implement another control,
while the System Security Plan is still being developed. Use the Self-Assessment
questions from Chapter 8 to help you better understand what security con-
trols to document in the System Security Plan.

Your System Security Plan should describe the security controls in prose.
Providing a list of bulleted control names is not good enough. Use words and
explain how the controls work in simple and easy-to-understand English.At
the minimum, you should include discussion of the security controls
described in the following sections (which are the same security controls dis-
cussed earlier in Chapter 8).
www.syngress.com
324
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

Management Controls
Management security controls help ensure that management requirements are
adhered to. By clearly describing the management controls, you should be
able to convince the evaluation team that the business owner’s management
team understands their responsibilities, are following through with these
responsibilities, and are being held accountable for them.
Risk Mitigation
In the section on management controls, you should include a summary of
how your agency or department mitigates risk. Risks are mitigated by
reducing them to a level that is acceptable to the business owner. Clearly,
before they can be mitigated, they need to be identiﬁed. In the section on
risk mitigation, you should, in summary fashion, brieﬂy describe your overall
risk mitigation strategy.You may want to include diagrams or ﬂowcharts that
help visualize the strategic relationships of your risk mitigation processes.An
example is shown in Figure 19.2.
Figure 19.2 Risk Mitigation Strategy

You will learn more about the Security Assessment Report in Chapter 21.
The Security Assessment Report is put together by the evaluation team (after
reviewing the entire C&A package) and it includes a summary of all the vul-
nerabilities.You’ll want to point out that any vulnerabilities identiﬁed in the
Security Assessment Report are mitigated by either reducing them, accepting
them, or transferring them. While the System Security Plan is in development,
the Security Assessment Report does not yet exist. However, by stating the busi-
ness owner’s intentions on how risks noted in the Security Assessment Report
will be handled in the future, it assures the evaluation team that you agree up
front that any reported risks will be appropriately mitigated.You need to con-
vince the evaluation team that all risks are, and will be, appropriately miti-
gated. Explaining that your risk mitigation strategy includes reducing risks
found in their ﬁnal Security Assessment Report makes the evaluators feel as
though you are on-board with their counsel.
Additional items that you ought to mention in this section (even if you
have already mentioned these items in other C&A documents) include sum-
mary discussions about the following:
■
How often you perform network- and host-based vulnerability 
scanning
■
The fact that your C&A Level is determined by a FIPS-199-based
process
■
The fact that you recognize that OMB A-130 requires risk assess-
ments every three years
■
Threat sources are taken into consideration when assessing risk

Reporting and Review by Management
There are multiple stipulations in FISMA that call for reporting and review
by management. For example, in FISMA §3543(a)(5), it says:
The Director shall oversee agency information security policies
and practices, including—reviewing at least annually, and
www.syngress.com
326
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

approving or disapproving, agency information security pro-
grams required under section 3544(b)….
Additionally, in FISMA §3544 (c), it says:
Each agency shall - (1) report annually to the Director, the
Committee on Government Reform and Science of the House
of Representatives, the Committees on Government Affairs
and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate,
the appropriate authorization and appropriations committees
of Congress, and the Comptroller General on the adequacy of
information security policies, procedures, and practices, and
compliance with the requirements of this subchapter….; (2)
address the adequacy and effectiveness of information secu-
rity policies, procedures, and practices in plans and reports…
This simply means that there are requirements to review your own secu-
rity controls and reports, to create new reports on your ﬁndings, and to
submit them to various congressional committees.
In discussing how you report and review security controls, you should
summarize the process that the business owner’s management team uses to
review security controls.The business owner’s management team needs to
show evidence that they have reviewed security controls.The C&A process
itself is one way that the management team typically reviews security controls
since the business owner, and typically their associated managers, are required
to review and sign the C&A documents that pertain to their role and respon-
sibility.Therefore, in the System Security Plan, although this may seem circum-
locutory, you are allowed to state that your C&A process fulﬁlls the reporting
and review requirements.
In the reporting and review section, provide a summary list of all the doc-
uments in the C&A package that you are working on, and also include the
reaccreditation date for the package. If there are other documents that are not
included in the C&A package that have been reviewed by the business
owner’s management team or ISSO and are related to security compliance,
you should list those documents as well, including information on who
reviewed them and when. Generally speaking, in most cases you won’t want
to list documents that are more than three years old. Other than the C&A
package itself, auxiliary documents can include initial design documents,
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
327

architecture documents, security standards, security policies, checklists, or even
descriptive e-mail messages.
System Life-Cycle Requirements
Your discussion of system life-cycle requirements ﬁrst and foremost should
acknowledge that your agency has system life-cycle requirements.The life-
cycle methodology for the systems undergoing C&A should include discus-
sions about how the systems undergoing C&A evolved. Before these systems
were put into production, there must have been requirements, planning, pro-
curements, and a need for them.As depicted in Figure 19.3, system life-cycle
requirements generally include the following phases:
■
Requirements identiﬁcation and analysis
■
Planning and procurement
■
Development and testing
■
Implementation
■
Operations, production, and on-going maintenance
■
Terminal and disposal
Figure 19.3 System Life-cycle Process
www.syngress.com
328
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

It’s possible that your agency has life-cycle requirements and processes
documented in a System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) manual or handbook.
If that is the case, you can obtain much information on what to include in
the lifecycle requirements section from the handbook. If you are unable to
ﬁnd any evidence that an SDLC methodology exists, or that life-cycle
requirements were ever taken into consideration, you’ll need to create these
requirements ex post facto. Creating requirements ex post facto is never ideal, but
it does show that going forward your business owner acknowledges the
importance of such phases. In some cases, it may be that life-cycle require-
ments were followed, but never documented. In the eyes of the C&A evalua-
tion team, if something is not documented, it doesn’t exist. It is possible that
your agency’s SDLC methodology includes four or ﬁve phases, instead of six.
It may also include seven phases. Don’t get hung up on the number of phases
since some agencies may combine a couple of phases. Use the life-cycle sup-
port questions from Chapter 8 to help you make sure you have covered all
the bases.
Security Planning
Security planning includes controls planned for future implementation, as well
as resources planned for future use. Resources include personnel, contractors,
equipment, software, and budgetary allocations. If you have security controls
that are in the planning process, but will not be implemented until some
point in the future, you should describe those controls in the section on secu-
rity planning. If you plan on hiring a security administrator or a security
engineer, and have allocated budgetary funds for the next ﬁscal year to do
that, indicate this intent. If you plan on implementing new intrusion detec-
tion systems, antivirus software, single sign-on systems, or anything that will
remediate existing vulnerabilities, be sure to mention this. Security planning
refers to security initiatives that will improve the security posture of your
organization at some point in the future. In C&A, you get credit for planning.
Documentation for Managers
To provide adequate guidance on security controls, management needs to
understand the controls, and therefore needs documentation to read and
review. Name the security documents that management reviews, comments
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
329

on, and approves of.You need to list formal document names that include the
revision number and the publication date.The documents described in this
section should include any C&A documents, as well as any other documents
related to security (e.g., security conﬁguration guides and security architec-
ture documents). Describe the review and approval cycle indicating the names
of the staff that signed off on the various documents.You can summarize this
information in tabular form as shown in Table 19.5.

Operational Controls
Operational security controls help ensure that operational requirements are
adhered to.
Personnel Security
Information about personnel security should include information about back-
ground investigation. Most U.S. federal agencies require background investiga-
tions. Provide as much information as you can about the background
investigation and screening process. It is very possible that your agency has a
security screening branch that carries out all background investigations.The
security screening branch may not make all of its processes and procedures
available to everyone in the agency. If that is the case, simply state the name of
the department that carries out the background investigations.Also describe
how the background investigation department can be contacted and where
they are located. If there are policies that require background investigations, it
is worth noting these policies.
Additionally, the section on personnel security should include information
on how both staff and contractors are kept safe. For example, if evacuation
www.syngress.com
330
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

routes are posted in hallways, or if there are formal Emergency Response
Procedures, be sure to note that in the section on personnel security. In some
agencies, staff (including contractors) are offered disaster preparedness training
and are given disaster preparation kits that include items like ﬂares, whistles,
and food rations. Whatever measures your agency takes to ensure that their
staff is safe and secure are worth stating in this section.
Physical and Environmental Controls and Safeguards
Physical and environmental safeguards protect the facilities that host infor-
mation systems. Provide descriptions that support the fact that the systems
listed in the Hardware and Software Inventory are hosted in an environment
that is conducive to continuous operations. In the section on physical and
environmental operations and safeguards, describe the facilities and their
warning systems.
Physical and environmental safeguards include such things as facilities
access, emergency power, emergency lighting, ﬁre suppression systems, ﬁre
alarms, circuit breakers, plumbing, surveillance cameras, and temperature and
humidity controls.The System Security Plan should speciﬁcally describe
whether uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or generators are used, and
what make and model each are. Describe the type of ﬁre suppression system
including any preventative maintenance required to test it on an annual basis.
Describe emergency lighting systems and where emergency lights are located.
Include information about how often emergency lights are tested.
Describe the use and positioning of any surveillance cameras. For
example, specify if surveillance cameras are mounted at building entrances,
server rooms, or hallways.Additionally, the type of surveillance cameras should
be speciﬁed as well as whether or not active monitoring is performed using
the cameras, or whether they are passive cameras that simply record events
that are then stored.
Information should be given about electrical circuits, voltage require-
ments, circuit breakers, and wiring closets. If this information is documented
in a separate facilities manual, and you list the formal name of that manual,
the evaluation team will likely accept this information in lieu of reprinting it
all separately in your System Security Plan.
It is necessary to describe any physical access systems to buildings and data
centers. Note the location and operation of card readers. Describe the card
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
331

readers’ make and model numbers.Additionally, you need to describe in gen-
eral terms how the card readers work. For example, do they use magnetic
stripes or RFID chips? Do they require personal identity numbers (PINs)?
Describe the use of smart cards and badging systems. If smart cards are used,
discuss a little bit about the type of cards used and the application system used
to program them.The process of how an individual obtains an identiﬁcation
badge requires description. Provide an explanation of whether Personal
Identity Veriﬁcation (PIV) credentials or  PINs are used. Describe the visitor
registration process. For example, it should be noted who signs visitors in and
if visitors require escorts while in the building.
Administration and Implementation
Administration and implementation refers to the installation, conﬁguration,
and administration of your systems and applications. Create a discussion about
the systems and database administrations that perform the installations and
conﬁgurations. Who are these folks? What is the experience level of the sys-
tems and database administrators? Do they have any technical certiﬁcations
that may help a C&A package auditor have faith in their abilities? The systems
and database administrators may be part of an organization that is separate
from the organization of the business owner. Describe any pertinent facts
about the administration organization and management team.An example of
a discussion that describes the capabilities of the administration and imple-
mentation team follows:
The enterprise resource planning systems are administered by
the Information Services (IS) department, which is managed
by Barbara Davidson. IS provides administrative operations
and support for over 500 systems. The systems listed in the
Hardware and Software Inventory, Version 2.0, February 24,
2006 are administered by Rafael Sanchez, Tajuan McDufﬁe,
Bruce Higgs, and Kiri Porter. 
Mr. Sanchez has been administering Solaris systems for six
years and is a Sun Certiﬁed Systems Administrator. Ms.
McDufﬁe has administered Microsoft Windows systems for
ﬁve years, and recently obtained a Microsoft Certiﬁed
Systems Engineer (MCSE) certiﬁcation for Windows Server
www.syngress.com
332
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

2003. Mr. Higgs has been administering Oracle databases for
two years, and before that, administered Microsoft SQL
databases for ﬁve years. Ms. Porter specializes in Web site
administration. She is knowledgeable about IBM Websphere
and has written half a dozen articles on the how to secure
Web-based applications. The IS administrators currently docu-
ment their installation, conﬁguration, and operations process,
and these documents are available for review. All the admin-
istrators carry cell phones, and if they are not reachable, the
call will automatically be transferred to the Network
Operations Center (NOC), which is staffed 24/7, 365 days a
year. 
The objective of this particular section is to convince the evaluation team
that the staff that administers the systems and applications on a day-to-day
basis is competent and capable.
Preventative Maintenance
Preventative maintenance refers to the maintenance required to keep equip-
ment and hardware running. Maintenance activities include performing diag-
nostics on circuit boards, changing boards, performing diagnostics on
memory, and BIOS and any other parts of the hardware. It’s possible that cer-
tain computers at times may need a new power supply or a new fan. Who are
the folks who would make this determination and perform the installation?
Preventative maintenance may be done by your agency’s in-house staff, or it
might be contracted out to a third-party organization. Whatever the case may
be, document who performs preventative maintenance and whether it is per-
formed on any sort of regular schedule. If an outside third-party performs
these tasks, you’ll need to include the name and contact information of the
person or department responsible for managing the third-party.
A thoughtful argument can be made that preventative maintenance also
includes the detection of software problems. However, I prefer to see informa-
tion about the detection of software problems in the technical controls sec-
tion that discusses preservation of data integrity. System diagnostics related to
ﬁle system errors and ﬁle systems ﬁlling up belong in the preventative main-
tenance section. Some systems run scheduled diagnostics on a regular
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
333

schedule to check the size of the ﬁle systems to ensure that they do not ﬁll
up. If the systems in your C&A package run any regularly scheduled diagnos-
tics on the ﬁle systems, or are regularly defragmented, be sure to indicate this.
Contingency and Disaster Recovery Planning
The Contingency Plan was discussed in Chapter 16. It is not necessary to
recreate all that information in the System Security Plan. However, the System
Security Plan should include a brief summary indicating that the Contingency
Plan exists, providing the formal name of the Contingency Plan document and
its publication date. If there are any other documents that are related to con-
tingency planning that you would like the evaluation team to take into con-
sideration, be sure to name those documents in this section. For example, if
your C&A package describes a major application that resides on top of gen-
eral support systems, it is likely that there is a separate contingency plan for
the general support systems and such a contingency plan would be worth
mentioning.
In addition to noting the existence of the plan and where to ﬁnd it, the
System Security Plan should indicate vital information on the organizational
requirements surrounding the maintenance and support of the plan.The SSP
should indicate who is responsible for maintaining the plan, the frequency
with which it must be reviewed and updated, whether key personnel with
duties in implementing the plan are trained on the plan, and what type of
Contingency Plan testing is conducted.
Training and Security Awareness
We already discussed the Security Awareness and Training Plan in Chapter 9.
However, in the System Security Plan you should state that a Security
Awareness and Training Plan exists, and provide the formal document name.A
Security Awareness and Training Plan is considered a type of operational secu-
rity control, which is why you should make reference to it in the System
Security Plan.
Additionally, the SSP should indicate key information on the organiza-
tional requirements regarding the implementation of security training, such as
the levels of training employees must go through, what training records are
www.syngress.com
334
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

kept, how often employees must participate in the training, and who is
responsible for overseeing the program.
Incident Response Procedures
Your Incident Response Plan should serve as an in-depth description of your
incident response process. Don’t recreate that plan in the System Security Plan.
However, you should provide a brief summary of the Incident Response Plan
and be sure to indicate that a detailed Incident Response Plan is available, stating
the formal document name, date, and version number.The Incident Response
Plan is a type of operational control, which is why you need to mention it in
the System Security Plan.
In addition to noting the existence of the plan and where to ﬁnd it, the
SSP should indicate who is responsible for maintaining the plan, the fre-
quency with which it must be reviewed and updated, whether key personnel
with duties in implementing the plan are trained on the plan, and what type
of incident response testing has been conducted.
Preservation of Data Integrity
You need to present information that serves as evidence that data integrity is
preserved. Data integrity refers to the fact that the data is pure, and represents
what it is supposed to represent—it hasn’t been tainted or changed either by
error or intentional malicious activity. Discuss anti-virus software, host-based
intrusion detection systems, security behavioral analysis products, ﬁle encryp-
tion, and patch management. Be sure to also discuss any customized scripts
used to preserve ﬁle integrity. For example, if the information system uses
scripts that check for data integrity breaches using MD5 hash functions, be
sure to describe what is checked and how often. In talking about the imple-
mentation of security products that ensure data integrity, such as anti-virus
products, your discussion should answer the following questions:
■
What is the product name and version number? Who performed the
installation?
■
Is there a third party (vendor or reseller) that provides ongoing
product support?
■
On what systems is the product implemented?
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
335

■
Does it include both server and client software?
■
Under what conditions do the clients interact with the server?
■
Does it use agents? Where are the agents deployed?
■
Is there a management console?
■
Are ﬁles or databases encrypted? 
■
For anything that is encrypted, have you named the encryption tool
and key sizes?
■
Does it rely on signatures that require updating? How often is it
updated?
■
How are updates installed (e.g., downloaded, distributed, etc.)?
■
Does it require conﬁguration rules? If so, what are the rules?
Network and System Security Operations
The termetwork and system security operations refers to the security of the
network and its associated devices and monitoring systems. Unless your
agency is extremely small, it likely has a network operations center (NOC).
Describe how your systems and network devices provide monitoring infor-
mation back to the operations center.Are agents installed on host systems to
monitor them? How would the NOC know if a mission critical system went
down? It’s possible that your agency may use any one of many different appli-
cations and tools to monitor their systems, in which case you will want to
describe what application is used for monitoring, and how it works. For
example, if used within your agency, you will want to describe the general
implementation of the following network monitoring applications:
■
HP Openview
■
BMC PATROL Dashboard
■
IBM Micromuse
■
CA eHealth LiveHealth
■
NETSCOUT nGenius Analytics
■
CiscoWorks Hosting Solution Software
www.syngress.com
336
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

If your department is dependent on a separate network operations group
that manages the networks on which your information systems reside, you
will need to communicate with them to ﬁnd out which tools they use to
monitor your systems and applications.You’ll want to ask them speciﬁc ques-
tions that will lead to information that you can include in your System
Security Plan. It is sometimes hard to draw the line of how much you should
document and how detailed you should get.You may not have time to
include every last detail. However, try to include enough information so that
it will be clear to the evaluation team that the business owner is well aware of
who they would need to go to in order to obtain all the rest of the nitty-
gritty details. For example, you could include a statement on your network
monitoring system such as the following statement that includes basic infor-
mation, with a pointer on where more details can be found:
The department of memorial ﬂags has two networks that are
monitored by the Network Management Group (NMG). NMG
monitors both networks using IBM’s Micromuse. The conﬁgu-
ration and operations of NMG’s Micromuse system is detailed
in the Network Management Group’s Network Operations
Guide, V 3.1, February 24, 2006. This guide is maintained
and updated by the Director of Information Technology,
Daniel Puckett, whose contact information is listed in the
phonebook on the agency intranet. 
State your ﬁrewall rule-set conﬁguration strategy. For example, a common
strategy is to deny all protocols and ports unless they are explicitly allowed. If
approvals are required to allow an additional service, state what the approval
process is. It’s possible that the approval process may be as simple as “All
approvals go through the agency Change Control Board, which is described
in Change Control Policies,Version 4.2,August 29, 2005.” If your department or
agency is small, and you don’t have a Change Control Board, you should state
what individuals approve of the changes and include their names and qualiﬁ-
cations (e.g., lead ﬁrewall engineer). Describe the workﬂow process from the
initial request, through the ﬁnal approval and actual change. It’s often helpful
to include a ﬂow chart with the description of the workﬂow process.
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
337

Technical Controls
Technical security controls ensure that technical requirements are met. It is
often the case that the evaluation team scrutinizes the technical controls more
rigorously than the management or operational controls—something you’ll
want to keep in mind when describing these controls.
Authentication and Identity Veriﬁcation
Identiﬁcation and authorization (I&A) controls enable your information
system and applications to prompt users for logon information and verify that
they are who they say they are.
Discuss the user enrollment and registration procedure.An example of a
user enrollment and registration process is illustrated in Figure 19.4.Your dis-
cussion should provide answers to the following questions:
■
How are systems administrators informed that a new user should be
added?
■
Before an account is established, is there either a paper form that a
supervisor ﬁlls out with a signature or some sort of online registra-
tion system that requires a supervisor’s approval? 
■
Is the enrollment process manual, automated, or semi-automated?
■
Are background investigations performed before user accounts are
established? 
■
Who decides what role and user group the user should be a part of? 
You also need to describe how the identiﬁcation and authorization system
works. Most authentication mechanisms are based on either something the
user knows, something the user has, or a physical trait of the user. Examples of
these three methods and their inherent risks and problems are listed in Table
19.6. Describe what is done to accommodate the potential risks or problems
that may occur during usage.

339

these capabilities. Similarly, if biometrics mechanisms or smart cards are used,
you’ll want to describe how the technical delivery of the authentication pro-
cess works. For any authentication products or mechanisms that your infor-
mation system uses, be sure to include information on the following:
■
Product name, version number, patch level
■
Vendor name and vendor contact information
■
Whether there is an existing support contract through a vendor or
reseller
■
Strength of any encryption keys used
■
Name of encryption algorithms used
■
Information on digital certiﬁcates used for authentication
■
Logical data ﬂow of the authentication process
■
Information on how authentication credentials are stored and pro-
tected
■
Single sign-on capabilities
■
Session time-out rules after periods of inactivity
■
Strength and complexity of password rules
■
Password aging requirements
■
Account lockout thresholds (how many attempts allowed)
■

of staff
■
Procedures for handling forgotten passwords
■
Usage of LDAP and Directory Services

Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

Logical Access Controls
Logical access controls are the features of your system that enable authorized
personnel access to resources.To many folks, distinguishing between logical
access control and I&A is confusing. Logical access controls are those controls
that either prevent or allow access to resources once a user’s identity already
has been established. Once a user is logged in, they should have access only to
those resources required to perform their duties. Different user groups usually
have access to different resources, which ensures a separation of duties.
Describe how the separation of duties occurs.A good portion of this discus-
sion should be about account management. User accounts are usually part of
a role-based group. Describe the names of each role and what resources each
role has access to.The resources that you will want to take into consideration
include systems, directories, network shares, and ﬁles.You can summarize this
information in a table similar to Table 19.7.
Table 19.7 Role-Based Group Accounts Mapped to Resources

Discussion of anonymous and guest accounts, whether they are allowed or
not, should be described. Group accounts, whether they are allowed or not,
should be described. System accounts—accounts set up for the purpose of
accommodating system processes and programs—may or may not be allowed.
If system accounts are allowed, you’ll need to give justiﬁcation as to why they
are allowed, and what processes and programs use these accounts.
Secure Conﬁgurations
Secure conﬁgurations refers to how well information systems, their applica-
tions, and databases are hardened and locked down. Section 3544(b)(2)(D)iii
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
341

of FISMA stipulates that agencies must ensure compliance with minimally
acceptable system conﬁguration requirements, as determined by the agency.
Right out of the box, most operating systems are not as secure as they
could be.Administrators typically need to turn off unneeded services and
modify conﬁguration ﬁles to tighten up the security on servers.To satisfy the
FISMA requirement on secure conﬁgurations, you’ll need to describe how
systems are locked down. Most of the systems in place at federal agencies are
based either on UNIX or a Microsoft operating system. For UNIX systems,
you should discuss key conﬁguration ﬁles that affect access, or launch critical
scripts. Examples of the sort of UNIX ﬁles that you should discuss include:
/etc/hosts.equiv
/etc/hosts.all
/.rhosts
/.netrc
/etc/services
/etc/ftpusers
/etc/syslog.conf
/etc/cron.d/cron.allow
/etc/cron.d/cron.deny
/etc/default/login
/etc/system
/etc/sulog
/etc/issue
/var/adm/loginlog
/etc/default/login
/etc/dfs/dfstab
/etc/dt/conﬁg/Xaccess
/etc/default/inetinit

Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

/usr/local/etc/
/dev/ip
If you use chmod or chown commands to change ﬁle or ownership per-
missions to tighten security, list the names of the ﬁles that are modiﬁed and
indicate their permissions.A good resource for understanding how to lock-
down a Sun Solaris UNIX system is the Guide to the Secure Conﬁguration of
Solaris 9, published by the National Security Agency, July 16, 2004.You can
ﬁnd that guide at http://www.nsa.gov/snac/os/sunsol_9/I331-007R-2204.pdf.
On Microsoft Windows’ operating systems, if you use security templates
(.inf ﬁles), describe the security settings that the templates use, and if you have
time, include screenshots. It’s always nice to throw in a few screenshots of
your security settings to show evidence that your conﬁguration is set up the
way you claim it to be.An example of a screenshot for a password-aging
policy setting is depicted in Figure 19.5.
Figure 19.5 Screenshot That Depicts Password-Aging Setting
If you have existing documents that describe how operating systems are
locked down, instead of reprinting everything that is listed in that guide in
your System Security Plan, it should be sufﬁcient simply to list the formal
names of these secure conﬁguration guides (e.g., Windows Server 2003 Security
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
343

Conﬁguration and Lockdown Guide,Version 2.7, October 27, 2006 or Solaris 10
Security Hardening Procedures,Version 7.1, November 11, 2005). It is possible
that auditors from the evaluation team may ask to see any secure conﬁgura-
tion guides that you list, so don’t list any documents that you feel would be
inappropriate to show an auditor.
If no security conﬁguration guides exist that document your operating
system security settings, and you have nothing to refer the evaluation team to
along those lines, you are going to have more work to do.You’ll have to doc-
ument those settings in your System Security Plan.
Some useful articles on various aspects of Windows security that may help
with you document Windows operating system security settings include:

Interconnectivity Security
Interconnectivity security refers to the measures taken to secure the connec-
tion of one system to another, and can be achieved through a variety of
mechanisms including VPNs, ﬁrewalls, proxy servers, gateways, routers, and
secure ﬁle transfer mechanisms. In discussing interconnectivity between sys-
tems, talk about how boundary protections work. Discuss how domains and
networks are separated from each other and include diagrams about the trust
relationships between them.
If end-to-end link encryption is used, describe how it works. Most VPNs
use certiﬁcates. Note the key length and the servers that the certiﬁcates are
installed on. Describe where the VPNs are IPSec VPNs or SSL VPNs. If you
are using an IPSec VPN, is it operating in transport mode or tunnel mode?

Audit Mechanisms
It’s important to have a section of your System Security Plan dedicated to
auditing. When you describe audit mechanisms, you essentially want to
describe how security events are recognized, recorded, stored, and analyzed.
Therefore, you should describe what is being audited, where the audit ﬁles
reside, how the audit ﬁles are being protected, and how often the audit ﬁles
are reviewed. When reviewing audit log ﬁles, systems administrators look for
suspicious events that indicate a security violation has occurred, or may occur
in the future. Indicate what types of circumstances or events the systems
administrators (or security engineers) look for to determine potential security
violations.To obtain this information, you will likely have to talk directly to
the systems administrators (or security engineers or network engineers).
Additionally, you should describe how audit log ﬁles are viewed. For
example, are audit ﬁles viewed from a central Security Information
Management (SIM) system or a central log server? Or do systems administra-
tors need to log on to individual remote servers to manually read through
individual system syslog ﬁles? You cannot go too far in depth in documenting
audit mechanisms.This is one area that the C&A evaluation team will likely
not gloss over. Examples of the types of ﬁles, events, and processes that you
will want to be sure to discuss include:
■
Files that store failed logon attempts of all users
■
Logon records of root, admin, and powerful users
■
How users are traced to actions
■
Startup and shutdown of the actual audit system process (e.g., sys-
logd)
■
Absolute pathnames of log ﬁles (e.g., /var/log/secure.log)
■
Names of servers that collect log ﬁles
■
How long log ﬁles are stored
■
The names and roles of the staff that read the log ﬁles
■
Password auditing tools that scan for weak passwords
■
Review of ﬁrewall rules for unauthorized modiﬁcation
www.syngress.com

Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

■
How modiﬁcation of sensitive or critical ﬁles is detected
■
How audit ﬁles are protected
■
How denied connections are logged
■
Timestamp reliability and how it is ensured
■
Who has access to log ﬁles
You should include information on system auditing, network auditing, and
ﬁrewall auditing.To investigate system auditing, ﬁnd out if your agency is
using host-based intrusion detection systems. Find out what events are audited
for the various operating systems that are used. Microsoft operating systems
are audited differently than UNIX operating systems. Windows 2000 Server
and Windows Server 2003 both have conﬁguration settings for Audit Policy. If
your information system uses either of these operating systems, describe what
the audit settings are in your section on audit. Information on how to con-
ﬁgure audit settings for Windows 2000 Servers can be found in the article
titled “It’s Easy to Secure Windows 2000 Servers, Part 2”
(www.intranetjournal.com/articles/200503/ij_03_16_05a.html). Information
on auditing Windows Server 2003 can be found at Microsoft’s TechNet site
(http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/6847e72b-9c47-
42ab-b3e3-691addac9f331033.mspx?mfr=true).
How a UNIX system performs auditing depends on what version of
UNIX you are using. Each type of UNIX (e.g., Solaris, Linux, OpenBSD,
AIX) has audit mechanisms that are somewhat unique.
Since ﬁrewalls provide perimeter protection designed to keep unautho-
rized users out of the production systems that host your C&A infrastructure,
ﬁrewall auditing deserves special mention. State how your ﬁrewall logs are
protected from unauthorized modiﬁcation. Who logged into the ﬁrewall last
and did they log in from the console or from a remote system? Some ﬁrewalls
can be administered only from the console and have remote login capabilities
disabled. It is worth mentioning if the ﬁrewalls are audited directly from the
console, or if administrators log into them remotely over the network. It’s also
possible that ﬁrewall logs are reviewed from a central management console.
Whatever way your agency uses to review the ﬁrewall logs, you should
describe it.
www.syngress.com
Preparing the System Security Plan • Chapter 19
347

Additionally, document the review schedule of the ﬁrewall log ﬁles. If ﬁre-
wall logs are reviewed only on an as-needed, ad hoc basis, say that.Talk to the
security engineers that review the ﬁrewall log ﬁles and ﬁnd out what it is that
they currently look for when they review these logs. Describe how suspect
activity is discovered. Do the administrators have a list of suspect events that
they look for or do they just scan through the log ﬁles and hope that they
will notice the right thing? For example, there are certain suspect events that
security administrators sometimes look for such as those listed in Table 19.8.
Table 19.8 Suspicious Events That Are Worth Auditing
Suspicious Event ID
Description
SE 1
Packets that have a source address internal to your
network that originate from outside your network.
SE 2
Suspicious outbound connections, e.g., outbound
connections that come from a public server on your
DMZ.
SE 3
Repeated unsuccessful attempts to connect to a mis-
sion critical server or application.
SE 4
Repeated probes to ports that are well-known hacker
ports.1
SE 5
Similar source ports used to connect to different
sockets. An example of this sort of activity is shown
here with three connections (now closed):
TCP 128.88.41.2:1025  140.216.41.2:80

TCP 128.88.41.2:1188  140.216.41.2:80
CLOSE_WAIT
(A socket is an IP address plus a port, e.g.,
206.208.163.15:80.)
SE 6
Invalid IP addresses that are not in the range of
acceptable octets, for example: 295.128.16.0.
SE 7

348
Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

If your agency uses a Security Enterprise Management system (SEM),
sometimes referred to as a Security Information Management (SIM) or
Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) system, to look for aberrant network
behavior, give an overview of how the system works and what events are
conﬁgured to issue alarms or alerts. For example, if any of the following com-
mercial products (or products similar to these) are used to generate alerts or
alarms, their usage should be discussed:
■
ArcSight ESM
■
eTrust Security Information Management
■
CiscoWorks
■
EventGnosis ORION Event Correlation Platform
■
Intellitactics Security Manager
■
Log Logic LX/ST Appliance
■
netForensics nFX OSP
■
NetIG Security Manager
■
OpenService Security Log Manager
■
SenSage Enterprise Security Analytics
■
TriGeo Security Information Management
■
Q1Labs QRadar
If log ﬁles are reviewed only on an ad hoc, as-needed basis and on no par-
ticular schedule, you should truthfully document that. Don’t describe an elab-
orate and diligent audit review process if one does not exist for the sake of
trying to obtain a positive accreditation on your C&A package. If it is discov-
ered at some later date that you documented review procedures that don’t
really exist, you could be accused of purposefully misleading auditors.
ISSO Appointment Letter
The System Security Plan needs to contain a copy of the signed ISSO (or
ISSM) appointment letter.The ISSO appointment letter veriﬁes to the audi-
tors who the person is that is accountable for security of the information sys-

tems described in the C&A package and therefore, the ISSO should be
named in the appointment letter.The auditors want to be able to hold
someone responsible for the information contained in the C&A package and
they want to be sure they hold the right person responsible. Since the ISSO
letter is usually a signed document, in most cases you will need to include a
scanned copy so you can show the signature page. Figure 19.6 shows an
example of an ISSO appointment letter.

Chapter 19 • Preparing the System Security Plan

Summary
The System Security Plan is one of the most important documents in your
C&A package. In the System Security Plan, you need to discuss and describe all
the security controls that safeguard your information system. Management
security controls stipulate the rules of the road, provide guidance to staff, and
are designed to hold people (including the management team) accountable.
Operational security controls stipulate what people should do on a day-to-day
basis to keep the information system secure.Technical security controls
include descriptions of security mechanisms that are implemented, conﬁg-
ured, and installed.
In some cases, there may be overlap or dependent relationships between
operational and technical security control. For example, it may make sense to
discuss certain aspects of ﬁrewalls in both the section on operational and the
one on technical controls. In the section on operational controls, you may
want to talk about how ﬁrewalls are administered. In the technical section,
you’ll want to talk about how ﬁrewalls are conﬁgured. It likely won’t be disas-
trous if the evaluation team ﬁnds that you have discussed some operational
controls in the section on technical controls. It’s possible they may ask you to
move some of the information from one section to another, but the impor-
tant thing is that the information is documented somewhere and is informa-
tive.

Introduction
Ostensibly, like most published works, you could detail a Certiﬁcation
Package to no end and continue adding more details until the additional
details detract from the focus. Part of understanding the package preparation
process is knowing when to draw the line in the sand and proclaim that the
package is ﬁnished. Once you have put together your ﬁrst C&A package, you
will soon come to the realization that you could have gone on forever docu-
menting picayune details to no end. In most cases, how far you should go will
be determined by a date on the calendar. C&A on all federal information sys-
tems has to be done every three years. If the last C&A on a set of systems
resulted in a formal accreditation on April 24, 2004, then the next C&A for
that group of systems must be completed by April 24, 2007—that means that
an Accreditation letter granting Authority to Operate must be in hand by
April 24, 2007 whether you started the project three months earlier or six
months earlier.
Structure of Documents
In all the documents that are prepared for the C&A package, I have thus far
described the different sections that you should be sure to include. In addition
to what I have already suggested you include, each of your documents should
have the following sections:
■
Introduction
■
Purpose
■
Scope and Applicability
■
References, Requirements, and Authorities
■
Record of Changes
Each document in the C&A package should include a Record of Changes
near the beginning of the document.The Record of Changes is a history of
changes made to the document and should include information about pages
that have been updated, change dates, who made the change, and a brief sum-
mary of the changes.A sample Record of Changes is shown in Table 20.1.

Who Puts the Package Together?
The C&A package usually is submitted in both hard-copy and soft-copy
forms.Always insert the hard copy into a binder of some sort—three-ring
binders do nicely but be sure to use one that is wide enough to accommo-
date a large amount of paper.A CD with soft copies of the documents should
be inserted into a pocket inside the binder.
Usually a draft package is put together for review before a ﬁnal package is
put together. In some agencies, the document preparation team puts the draft
package together and in other agencies, the evaluation team puts the package
together after the documents have been submitted to them.The evaluation
team makes the decision on who puts the package together. If the evaluation
team wants the preparation team to package up the documents, then the
preparation team should do so.As far as putting the package together goes,
the preparation team should always defer to the evaluation team’s guidance. If
you’re not sure who should put the package together, ask the evaluation team.
Markings and Format
A typical data classiﬁcation warning that would be suitable for the cover page
may read as follows:
The <Agency Name> Privileged Information contained
herein is the sole, proprietary, and exclusive property of
www.syngress.com
Submitting the C&A Package • Chapter 20
357

<Agency Name> and may only be used by individuals with a
need to know. All information contained herein is privileged
whether such information is in written, graphic, electronic, or
physical form. Those granted limited use to the information
must hold these materials and information in strict conﬁ-
dence. Access to and use of this information by any other
entity or individual is strictly prohibited.
The data classiﬁcation should be marked on every page. For example, if all
the data is considered Privileged Information, every single page of the
Certiﬁcation Package should have Privileged Information marked on it
either at the header or footer.
Signature Pages
Each C&A document inside the C&A package has to be signed by the
ISSO, the business owner, and members of the business owner’s manage-
ment team and project leaders.Your agency may require signatures from
specific individuals for the different C&A documents. If you’re not sure, ask
someone on the evaluation team if there are particular signature require-
ments. If there are not predefined signature requirements, usually the ISSO
and business owner decide who should review and sign the C&A docu-
ments before they are submitted.
Some agencies don’t require signatures on the individual C&A documents
though it is certainly more difﬁcult to hold anyone accountable for the con-
tents of the document, and the information security of the systems, without
signatures.Agencies that don’t require signatures should move toward
requiring them in the future.
It’s sometimes the case that in large agencies, obtaining signatures can be
very time consuming because the documents have to be routed manually
from person to person. Once documents have been signed, you need to scan
in the signature pages to obtain an image ﬁle to include on the C&A package
CD.Agencies can expedite the signing process by using SMART documents
and digital signatures. SMART documents are based on Extensible Markup
Language (XML) and can be integrated with digital signature technologies to
use tamper-evident signatures that offer nonrepudiation and veriﬁcation of
www.syngress.com
358
Chapter 20 • Submitting the C&A Package

document integrity.Additionally, using XML offers the ability to generate
new and updated C&A documents much more expeditiously.
Digital signature technologies and electronic signing pads exist that make
signing a Microsoft Word or .pdf ﬁle as easy as signing with a pen. Using dig-
ital signature products, it is easy to route the document in need of signature
from one signatory to another. Signing documents electronically also gener-
ates a time-stamped history of the review and approval process.Although
most agencies are not using digital signature technologies today, XML digital
signatures are the wave of the future and will greatly expedite the sign-off
process of C&A documents.
The following vendors offer easy-to-use digital signature solutions:
■
Arx (www.arx.com/)
■
CIC (www.cic.com)
■
DocuSign (www.docusign.com)
■
Topaz Systems Inc. (www.topazsystems.com)
Any digital signature solution you put into place for C&A document
signing should be thoroughly tested to make sure that signatures are
encrypted using FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms.
A Word about 
“Not Applicable” Information
When you don’t include a particular section in a C&A document or package,
even if it is “not applicable,” the auditors may come to the conclusion that
you forgot it. Including a section and then proclaiming it not applicable
shows that you haven’t forgotten to include a particular topic.Any item in a
document that is not applicable to your information system or major applica-
tion undergoing C&A should be marked as such. Not forgetting to mark par-
ticular sections as not applicable will stave off a lot of questions from the
C&A evaluation team.
www.syngress.com
Submitting the C&A Package • Chapter 20
359

Submission and Revision
Submit the C&A package according to guidance from the evaluation team.
They may want you to e-mail them documents, or upload them into an
online library or database. Or it’s possible they simply want only the hardcopy
in a binder and a CD. Establish a dialogue with the evaluation team so that
you can accommodate their preference for package submission. One thing
you’ll need to ﬁnd out is how much time the evaluation team requires to
review the documents. Be sure to submit them early enough so that you can
have an accreditation letter in hand by your required deadline.
Even on a stable group of systems that have had few changes, each time
you submit a new C&A package you are opening up yourself to new audit
ﬁndings.The evaluation team could be an entirely new team that is more
stringent on package evaluations than the former team. New requirements
may have been put into place by your agency since the last time these general
support systems were reviewed. Not all package evaluators do things the same
way, and auditors really have the upper hand in whether to be extremely
picky or more ﬂexible in interpreting requirements.
Defending the Certiﬁcation Package
Upon submitting the C&A package, the evaluation team will start reviewing
it.The process for evaluating the C&A package is discussed in Chapter 21.
Most likely the evaluation team will have questions about various items.They
may e-mail questions to the ISSO, or ask the preparation team and ISSO to
participate in meetings for the purpose of getting questions answered.
The team that prepares the C&A package should prepare themselves to
defend the package. During the evaluation process, the evaluators will have
checklists that they ﬁll out while questions are being answered. It’s possible
that the evaluation team could be in a hurry, and due to this, they may not
even read all sections of all documents in your C&A package that you dili-
gently took the time to write.They’ll likely ask you questions about items
that are clearly answered in your C&A documents.They may even mark
down on their checklists certain items as “failures” simply because they did
not spend enough time to look for the information in the C&A documents.
www.syngress.com
360
Chapter 20 • Submitting the C&A Package

If you believe certain items marked as “failures” should not be marked as
such, and that the information pertaining to that item is included in the C&A
documents, advise the evaluation team what section of what document to
look in, and explain to them why you feel the “failure” should be changed to
a “pass.”
Unquestionably, every item that the evaluation team marks as a failure
should be adequately researched by the preparation team.The evaluation team
can make mistakes.The evaluation team should give you adequate time to
research and comment on their ﬁndings. If your package has some failures, that
doesn’t mean it won’t receive a recommendation for accreditation. It is nearly
impossible to receive a 100% perfect score on your entire package. If the failure
citations given to the package are reasonable, you won’t win any points with
the evaluators by arguing about these citations. It’s very important to address
any failure citations professionally and politely. Failure citations are not neces-
sarily a reﬂection on the folks who put the C&A package together.The prepa-
ration team should be documenting the security that already exists.You cannot
invent good security controls that don’t exist through creative writing.
If the evaluation team does not request to schedule time with the prepara-
tion team and ISSO to review the C&A package, it is worth taking the initia-
tive to suggest a get-together to discuss any issues that may arise.The
evaluation team should always make time to discuss any issues that they have
with the documents. It’s not really acceptable for the evaluation team to mark
down items as “failures” and not give the ISSO and document preparation
team a chance to comment on the issue at hand. Some agencies refer to the
discussion between the document preparers and the document evaluators as
Comment Resolution sessions.
If the C&A team that prepares the Certiﬁcation Package does their work
diligently and in good faith, it will be second nature to defend any questions
posed by the auditors.True leaders are not afraid of the inspection process
that a Certiﬁcation Package goes through. Don’t hedge the truth and answer
all questions honestly. If you don’t know the answer to a question, simply
acknowledge that and advise the evaluators that you will be happy to get back
to them.

Summary
Once you have submitted the C&A package, you have achieved a major mile-
stone.The package itself is an incredibly valuable suite of documents. Without
it, the risks to the systems, networks, and applications would be unknown.
The security controls may not be known either.The C&A package is indica-
tive of a security baseline that is far more substantial than one that a simple
network scan report can give you.There is so much more to evaluating secu-
rity than performing a network scan or penetration test.

Introduction
Once a ﬁnal C&A package has been submitted, the evaluation team begins
the review process.The person or team of people who evaluate the C&A
package should not be the same person or group of people who prepared it.
Something that the OIG and GAO will be looking for are instances of the
fox guarding the hen house.There needs to be a separation of duties between
the folks who prepare the C&A documents and the folks who evaluate them.
The Security Assessment Report
The Security Assessment Report (SAR) is a document that is put together by the
evaluation team after they have gone through the C&A package with a ﬁne-
toothed comb.The Security Assessment Report should indicate what audit
checks were performed, what passed and what failed, and what the ﬁnal sum-
mary list of vulnerabilities are that the evaluation team found.
The vulnerabilities cited in the SAR may or may not match the vulnera-
bilities that the C&A preparation team included in the Business Risk
Assessment or the System Risk Assessment. It’s possible that the evaluation team
may not agree with the vulnerabilities presented to them by the C&A
package documents. Or they may agree with the vulnerabilities, but decide to
change the risk exposure rating.They may also add on altogether new vulner-
abilities based on their ﬁndings after performing their compliance audit.
Aside from vulnerabilities, the SAR should include a list of recommended
corrective actions. Each vulnerability cited should have recommended correc-
tive action, but there can also be any other type of recommended corrective
actions described. NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security
Certiﬁcation and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, has further informa-
tion about the Security Assessment Report and can be found at
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37/SP800-37-ﬁnal.pdf.
Checklists for Compliance
Almost all evaluators of C&A documents have compliance checklists that
they use. If you’re evaluating a C&A package for the first time, you’ll want
to either develop your own checklists, or find out if your agency has some
www.syngress.com
366
Chapter 21 • Evaluating the Certiﬁcation Package for Accreditation

that have already been developed. Like the documents in the C&A package,
the compliance checklists usually evolve over time, and it is certainly
acceptable to update them and refine them as your C&A evaluation team
gains more experience.
The compliance checklists should include checks for management con-
trols, operational controls, and technical controls. Each control should have a
policy number, security standard, FISMA section citation, or some other guid-
ance that can be referred to as the source of the requirement. Examples of
compliance checklists are found in Tables 21.1, 21.2, and 21.3. Note that the
examples are not exhaustive, and there may be more compliance checks that
are not included in these checklists that your agency will want to take into
consideration.The reference to “system” in the compliance checklist refers to
all of the systems together that are listed in your C&A package. So if your
Hardware and Software Inventory consists of multiple servers and systems, a
check for compliance means all of them together—the whole ball of wax. It
should never be the case that a compliance check is done on each individual
asset listed in the Hardware and Software Inventory.
It is possible that some of the compliance checks will not apply to certain
systems and major applications, and those checks should be marked NA (not
applicable) when evaluating a package for compliance. For example, if a
system does not use encryption keys, there is no need to check to see if
encryption keys are FIPS 140-2 compliant.
Some evaluation teams use Yes/No on their compliance checklists and
others use Pass/Fail.A Yes is equivalent to a Pass, and using either termi-
nology is considered acceptable.Additionally, some evaluators may elect to
include an intermediary rating of Marginal where some aspects of the
expected outcome on the compliance check were attained with a small
amount of deficiencies noted.
Have the C&A package next to you when ﬁlling out the compliance
checklists. Be sure to take the time to look through all the information when
marking a Pass or Fail. If you have the soft copies of the documents, you can
use the search tool to make sure you have found everything related to each
audit check. For any audit check that is questionable—you can’t decide
whether to give it a Pass or Fail—indicate this in some way and meet with
the ISSO and the preparation team to obtain clariﬁcation. It is okay to ask for
www.syngress.com
Evaluating the Certiﬁcation Package for Accreditation • Chapter 21

more information and more documentation that the preparation team may
not have included. However, any ancillary documentation given to you by the
preparation team should be documentation that already exists. If you need to
speak with systems administrators, database administrators, or security engi-
neers to obtain a better understanding of anything, it is certainly acceptable to
ask the ISSO to set up such a meeting.

Recommendation to Accredit or Not
After the evaluation and review of the C&A package documents have been
ﬁnalized, the evaluation team makes a recommendation on whether the infor-
mation system or major application described in the C&A package should be
accredited or not.The recommendation usually is made to the certifying
agent, since the evaluation team usually represents the certifying agent. In
most cases, the certifying agent accepts the recommendation of the evaluation
team. If the certifying agent ever decides not to accept the recommendation,
it means that much faith has been lost in the evaluation team and it might be
time for the evaluation team to look for a new job.
The certifying agent may be responsible for the evaluation of the many
C&A packages, and therefore, it is often the case that he or she will not have
time to read through all of these packages. It is possible, though, that the cer-
tifying agent may skim through them and review certain selections of each
package. In support of the recommendation made by the evaluation team, the
certifying agent will then write an ofﬁcial letter to the authorizing ofﬁcial
www.syngress.com
404
Chapter 21 • Evaluating the Certiﬁcation Package for Accreditation

recommending that the information system or major application described in
the C&A package be accredited.A sample recommendation for accreditation
letter is illustrated in Figure 21.1.
Accreditation and Authority to Operate
After receiving a copy of the recommendation on whether a C&A package
should be accredited or not, the authorizing ofﬁcial writes a letter, known as
an Authority to Operate (ATO), to the business owner and ISSO that autho-
rizes the operations of the systems.The ATO is usually not longer than two
pages, and will likely mention that there is an expectation that any POA&M
items will be adequately reconciled.A sample accreditation letter is illustrated
in Figure 21.2.
Interim Authority to Operate
If the C&A package does not pass muster with the evaluation team, but it
appears that it is on the right track and has the potential to remediate missing
information within a short time period, the business owner may be awarded
an Interim Authority to Operate (IATO).All IATOs are awarded with an
expiration date assigned to it; most expire after six months.The criteria used
for being awarded an IATO vary from agency to agency.Although an IATO
is certainly not as desirable as an ATO, it does mean you can continue oper-
ating your systems up until the expiration date.

Evaluations by an OIG
Each agency has an OIG, whose role is to ensure that the agency is com-
plying with all laws. Most agencies usually receive little notice that the OIG is
going to be paying a visit.The objective of the OIG is to assess the informa-
tion security program for compliance with FISMA, and generate a report that
documents the results of that evaluation. In accordance with the principles of
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended by Public Law
104-231), OIG reports are available to the general public.
OIG teams from different agencies will not necessarily assess the informa-
tion security program in the same way.The reports generated by different
OIG teams will not necessarily have the same format and include all the same
information.An example of an OIG reports are found at the following
URLs:
EPA OIG Report
www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2003/epaoigFISMA20031022.pdf
GSA OIG Report
http://oig.gsa.gov/A050174.pdf
Health and Human Services OIG Report
http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/cms/180502600.pdf
The inspectors could ask to see just about any type of document related
to the information security program.They may ask for a C&A Handbook, and
they may ask to see 10 randomly selected C&A packages. It’s almost impos-
sible to prepare for what they may ask for.The best thing to do is to accom-
modate them as best as possible and give them everything that they ask to see.
They will likely not ask to logon to systems.
One of the best things your agency can do to prepare for a visit from the
OIG is to read the OIG report for your agency that was issued the previous
year. Look through to see what it is that they asked to review, and what their
recommendations were for your agency.They will likely want to know if any
action was taken on their prior recommendations.

Evaluations by the GAO
Evaluations and assessments are made by the GAO to verify if the OIG is
reporting information correctly. Similar to OIG evaluations, the GAO inspec-
tors could ask to see just about any type of document related to the informa-
tion security program.Aside from evaluating each agency’s C&A program, the
GAO will be collecting information to assemble for an annual report to
Congress.The 2005 GAO report can be found at
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05552.pdf.
All GAO inspectors are different, and they may ask for different items to
review. Some GAO inspectors are contractors and come from companies that
are well versed in computer security. I have seen GAO inspectors ask for
items as speciﬁc as those listed in Table 21.4.The GAO inspectors may record
the date they ask for speciﬁc items and the date the items are received. It is
best to give them what they want as quickly as possible.

that GAO inspectors will be arriving so that the ISSOs can make themselves
available to answer any questions.

Use the following checklist to make sure evaluations are done carefully:
■
Has an audit checklist been developed for management controls?
■
Has an audit checklist been developed for operational controls?
■
Has an audit checklist been developed for technical controls?
■
Do the audit checks adequately check for compliance with conﬁden-
tiality, integrity, and availability security policies?
■
Does the Security Assessment Report include a ﬁnal list of vulnerabili-
ties and corrective action?

Summary
Evaluating a C&A package is a big undertaking. Many evaluation teams don’t
leave enough time for reading through the information-rich C&A documents
that were so thoughtfully prepared.The evaluation team should treat the
preparation team and ISSO with professionalism and respect and avoid having
the evaluation process degenerate into a squabbling affair.The evaluation
team, through its recommendations, has an opportunity to make a difference
by pointing out vulnerabilities that may have been missed by the preparation
team and ISSO.Though most C&A packages don’t usually obtain a perfect
score on all audit checks, that doesn’t mean that the package and systems are
not worthy of accreditation. Recommendations on whether to accredit a
group of systems (or not) should be made very thoughtfully, with justiﬁca-
tions behind every recommendation.

Introduction
Understanding how to resolve the reported vulnerabilities is the ﬁnal step in
the C&A process.
POA&Ms
Whether you receive full Accreditation and an Authority to Operate (ATO),
or an Interim Authority to Operate (IATO), you will be required to correct
weaknesses related to your security controls. If you were awarded an IATO,
there will likely be far more weaknesses that you’ll need to correct than if
you were awarded an ATO.The weaknesses need to be identiﬁed and
described in a document known as the Plan of Action & Milestones
(POA&M).The POA&M represents the ISSO’s to-do list and typically needs
to be approved by the evaluation team that evaluated the C&A package
before they send in the recommendation for accreditation.
The objective of the POA&M is to have all the vulnerabilities and below-
standard security controls identiﬁed and listed in one consolidated document.
The POA&M is the ﬁnal output of the certiﬁcation and accreditation process
and is where OIG and GAO are going to look to determine what your plans
are to reduce the risks to your systems going forward.
Development and Approval
Typically the POA&M is created by the ISSO. However, the ISSO may dele-
gate this task to a staff member or contractor.There should be a separation of
duties between whoever develops the POA&M and the folks who will be
required to implement the corrective action requirements. Once your
POA&M is complete, it needs to be approved.The ISSO should submit the
POA&M to the evaluation team that made the recommendation for accredi-
tation who will review it, and then send it to the authorizing ofﬁcial.
Sometimes some of the mitigation activities will be nothing more than
updating software or installing the latest patches at little to no cost to the
organization. Other mitigation activities could cost thousands of dollars and
need upper level management approval for the funds.You should make sure
that the authorizing ofﬁcial has seen and approved the POA&M—that way,
www.syngress.com
412
Chapter 22 • Addressing C&A Findings

when you request the money to complete the tasks there should be no prob-
lems getting the funding.
POA&M Elements
A POA&M is typically put together in tabular format and includes informa-
tion about the cited weakness or vulnerability, milestones, and cost.You
should make sure the following information is included in each POA&M:
■
ID No. A unique number used by the organization to track mitiga-
tion activities.
■
Weakness  Include a description of the weakness identiﬁed by the
annual program review, OIG, or GAO audit.
■
Severity  High, Moderate, or Low.
■
POC  Include contact information for the ofﬁce and/or organiza-
tion that the agency will hold responsible for resolving the weakness.
■
Resources Required  List the estimated funding and resources
required to resolve the weakness. Include the anticipated source of
funding (e.g., within the department or as a part of a cross-cutting
security infrastructure program). Include whether a reallocation of
base resources or a request for new funding is anticipated.This
column should also identify other nonfunding obstacles and chal-
lenges to resolving the weakness (e.g., lack of personnel or expertise,
development of new system to replace insecure legacy system, etc.).
To determine resource costs for employees, use the latest agency
average salary and beneﬁt hourly rate, then multiply the rate by the
number of hours. Remember, this is just an estimate.
■
Projected Completion Date  Identify the date for resolving the
weakness.Typically the projected completion date cannot be
changed. If a weakness is resolved before or after the projected com-
pletion date, you should show the actual completion date in the
status column.
■
Milestones with Completion Dates  Identify speciﬁc require-
ments to correct the weakness and include completion dates.
www.syngress.com
Addressing C&A Findings • Chapter 22
413

■
Identiﬁed in C&A evaluation or other review?  State how the
weakness was identiﬁed (e.g., Security Assessment Report, OIG
audit, GAO audit, etc.). If the weakness that is identiﬁed is reportable
to the OIG, include the speciﬁc language and/or law from the perti-
nent audit report.
■
Status?Ongoing or Completed  Completed should be used only
when a weakness has been fully resolved and the corrective action
has been validated. For canceled milestones, update the Status column
to say Completed with the date, and give a brief explanation in the
Comments column.
■
Comments Include a Comments column to record additional
status.

A Word to the Wise
Now the C&A Package is complete. It has been delivered and approved by
the evaluation team and you have an Authority to Operate in hand. Good job
to everybody involved! It was a long hard road, and the job is done . . . or is
it? Unfortunately it’s often the case that once the C&A package has been
completed, the organization sticks the POA&M on a shelf and forgets about
the C&A process.The next year when the evaluation team comes around to
obtain updates for FISMA reporting, it can create a big worriment to ﬁnd out
the status of the mitigation activities. In some cases, the mitigation activities
may have never even been started and there may be no way to complete
them before the end of the reporting period. Such scenarios defeat the pur-
pose of the entire C&A process.
The point of C&A is to assess and document the security of your systems,
identify vulnerabilities in your systems, and mitigate those vulnerabilities to
improve the security posture. Don’t waste all the hard work and effort that
you and your colleagues put into the C&A process by not tracking and fol-
lowing up on the mitigation activities. If you track, follow up on, and validate
that the mitigation activities are being completed, the next year, reporting will
be an easy task.You’ll know the status of the activities, your systems will be
more secure, and your work will have made a difference.
Checklist
Use the following checklist to make sure you don’t forget anything when
developing your POA&M:
■
Are all system weaknesses identiﬁed and listed?
■
Does each system weakness have at least one corresponding mile-
stone?
■
Does the mitigation strategy information include a scheduled com-
pletion date?
■
Does each milestone have a projected completion date?
■
Does the mitigation strategy information include a Point of Contact?
www.syngress.com
416
Chapter 22 • Addressing C&A Findings

■
Are changes to milestones identiﬁed and listed?
■
Does the weakness identiﬁed include a source (e.g., package 
evaluation)?
■
Is the status of the identiﬁed weakness indicated?
■
Does the mitigation strategy information include the required ﬁnan-
cial resources? 
Summary
The ﬁndings that result from the evaluation of the C&A package should be
turned into action items. ISSOs use a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)
document to summarize and track the action items. In subsequent audits, the
evaluation team, OIG, and GAO may investigate to ﬁnd out if corrective
actions were applied to all security weaknesses.Addressing the ﬁndings that
result from the C&A process is key to getting the value out of all the time
and resources that were put into the security certiﬁcation and accreditation
process. Following through on POA&M action items is imperative to
improving the secure posture of your systems.

Improving Your
Federal Computer
Security Report
Card Scores

only in constant improvement and constant
change.”

Introduction
Each year, every agency has the opportunity to improve its annual Federal
Computer Security Report Card.Aside from being audited by their own
OIG and then by the GAO, agencies are required to self-report FISMA and
privacy information annually.The White House Ofﬁce of Management and
Budget gives speciﬁc instructions on how to prepare and submit your
agency’s FISMA information.An overview for agencies to use on how to self-
report their FISMA information is listed in memorandum M-05-15 available
at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-15.html.
Detailed self-reporting instructions are available at www.whitehouse.gov/
omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-15_att.pdf.
The Excel template into which you enter your FISMA information is
available at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/ﬁsma/FY05_
FISMA_reporting_template_CIO.xls.
Agency Inspector Generals are required to ﬁle their own report on their
agency based on the subset of systems and documents that they review when
they come on site for audits.
Elements of the Report Card
Each agency receives a roll-up score based on the consummate score from the
agency’s bureaus and their respective departments. Every year the report card
grade changes. If your agency scored well last year, that doesn’t necessarily
mean they will score well in subsequent years. Each year, the self-reporting
templates that contain the roll-up scores all change somewhat. Last year, the
self-reporting template put emphasis in the following areas:
■
Number of systems certiﬁed and accredited (including contractor sys-
tems)
■
Conﬁguration management
■
Security policies and procedures
■
Security training and awareness
■
Number of security incidents reported

■
Incident detection capabilities
■
Implementation of security controls
Although the emphasis may change from year to year, it is unlikely that it
will change in its entirety.Therefore, it behooves all agencies to review the
emphasis from the prior year.
Actions for Improvement
To improve your report card, it will take a team effort that needs to be driven
from the top down.Your CIO, SAISO, and all authorizing ofﬁcials will need
to do some homework before developing an action plan for improvement.
First, you’ll need to read the annual OMB report to Congress and make note
of any negative citations about your agency.You’ll need to read the OIG
report developed by your own inspectors and make note of the deﬁciencies
that your inspectors found in your agency.Additionally, you’ll need to read
the information security report about your agency published by GAO.Your
agency CIO (with the assistance of the SAISO) should look for trends in
these reports and make a comprehensive list of your agency’s deﬁciencies.
Finally, you’ll need to do some research on any security incidents that may
have occurred, particularly security incidents that received public media
scrutiny. In doing background research on your deﬁciencies, look for trends
cited in the different reports.
Once a list of the agency’s deﬁciencies have been put together, the CIO
should create an internal Corrective Action Plan for improving FISMA
Scores, and make it a point to disseminate the plan to all ISSOs and other
information security staff. CIOs and SAISOs should advise their agency or
bureau to put more focus in the deﬁcient areas.The CIOs and SAISOs
should ask the assistance of the C&A evaluation teams to work through the
Corrective Action Plan for improving FISMA Scores with the ISSOs.The
evaluation team should put more emphasis on deﬁcient areas for all C&A
packages that they evaluate. C&A package evaluation teams can help ISSOs
achieve a higher level of compliance by informing them up front where they
should focus their efforts. CIOs should require that the evaluation team check

Improving Your Federal Computer Security Report Card • Chapter 23
421

in with ISSOs on a regular basis to make sure that they have the latest tem-
plates, information security policies, and C&A requirements.
A CIO cannot improve the agency’s scores alone. It takes a team. It is
imperative that the CIO communicate the desire and expectation for
improvement throughout all the information security avenues of the agency.
Agency CIOs need to hold bureau CIOs accountable, who in turn need to
hold business owners and ISSOs accountable.
Streamlining the C&A process by using online signatures and XML-based
SMART documents that interact directly with databases and monitoring sys-
tems will ultimately speed up C&A activities. Creating an in-house C&A
portal can also improve communications and provide valuable resources for
helping your agency understand C&A requirements.
Trends
Recent trends have shown that the following areas often are consistently
neglected:
■
Contingency Plans are not tested
■
Mitigation activities listed in POA&Ms are left undone
■
Not all systems are certiﬁed and accredited
■
Contractor systems connected to agency networks are not certiﬁed
and accredited

Chapter 23 • Improving Your Federal Computer Security Report Card

Summary
It is possible to improve your annual Federal Computer Security Report
Card, but it requires systematic diligence driven from the top down. In sum-
mary, paying attention to the following areas should help all agencies make
improvements:
■
Do research on OMB, OIG, and GAO reports to ﬁnd your agency’s
deﬁciencies
■
Summarize the deﬁciencies and create a FISMA Corrective Action
Plan
■
Distribute the FISMA Corrective Action Plan to staff
■
Communicate the desire and expectation of improvement
■
Allocate a bigger security budget to security areas that receive the
lowest scores
■
If need be, hire contractors to help out the in-house staff
■
Reﬁne your C&A Handbook and update your templates regularly
■
Have the evaluation team check in with ISSOs on a regular basis
■
Require signatures on all C&A documents so that staff can be held
accountable
■
Ensure that all production systems and applications are certiﬁed and
accredited 
■
Streamline the C&A process and automate reporting activities as
much as possible

Security of Federal Automated Information Resources
A. Requirements.
1. Purpose 
This Appendix establishes a minimum set of controls to be included in Federal auto-
mated information security programs; assigns Federal agency responsibilities for the
security of automated information; and links agency automated information security
programs and agency management control systems established in accordance with OMB
Circular No.A-123.The Appendix revises procedures formerly contained in Appendix
III to OMB Circular No.A-130 (50 FR 52730; December 24, 1985), and incorporates
requirements of the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) and responsibilities
assigned in applicable national security directives.
2. Deﬁnitions 
The term:
a.
“adequate security” means security commensurate with the risk and magnitude
of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modiﬁca-
tion of information.This includes assuring that systems and applications used by the
agency operate effectively and provide appropriate Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability, through the use of cost-effective management, personnel, operational,
and technical controls.
b.
“application” means the use of information resources (information and infor-
mation technology) to satisfy a speciﬁc set of user requirements.
c.
“general support system” or “system” means an interconnected set of informa-
tion resources under the same direct management control which shares common
functionality.A system normally includes hardware, software, information, data,
applications, communications, and people.A system can be, for example, a local area
network (LAN) including smart terminals that supports a branch ofﬁce, an agency-
wide backbone, a communications network, a departmental data processing center
including its operating system and utilities, a tactical radio network, or a shared
information processing service organization (IPSO).
d.
“major application” means an application that requires special attention to
security due to the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse,
or unauthorized access to or modiﬁcation of the information in the application.
Note:All Federal applications require some level of protection. Certain applications,
because of the information in them, however, require special management oversight
and should be treated as major.Adequate security for other applications should be
provided by security of the systems in which they operate.
3.Automated Information Security Programs.Agencies shall implement and maintain a
program to assure that adequate security is provided for all agency information col-
lected, processed, transmitted, stored, or disseminated in general support systems and

major applications.
Each agency’s program shall implement policies, standards and procedures which are
consistent with government-wide policies, standards, and procedures issued by the Ofﬁce
of Management and Budget, the Department of Commerce, the General Services
Administration and the Ofﬁce of Personnel Management (OPM). Different or more
stringent requirements for securing national security information should be incorpo-
rated into agency programs as required by appropriate national security directives.At a
minimum, agency programs shall include the following controls in their general support
systems and major applications:
a.
Controls for general support systems.
1) Assign Responsibility for Security.Assign responsibility for security in each
system to an individual knowledgeable in the information technology used in
the system and in providing security for such technology.
2) System Security Plan. Plan for adequate security of each general support
system as part of the organization’s information resources management (IRM)
planning process.The security plan shall be consistent with guidance issued by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Independent advice
and comment on the security plan shall be solicited prior to the plan’s imple-
mentation.A summary of the security plans shall be incorporated into the
strategic IRM plan required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
Chapter 35) and Section 8(b) of this circular. Security plans shall include:
a) Rules of the System. Establish a set of rules of behavior concerning
use of, security in, and the acceptable level of risk for, the system.The
rules shall be based on the needs of the various users of the system.
The security required by the rules shall be only as stringent as neces-
sary to provide adequate security for information in the system. Such
rules shall clearly delineate responsibilities and expected behavior of all
individuals with access to the system.They shall also include appro-
priate limits on interconnections to other systems and shall deﬁne ser-
vice provision and restoration priorities. Finally, they shall be clear
about the consequences of behavior not consistent with the rules.
b) Training. Ensure that all individuals are appropriately trained in how
to fulﬁll their security responsibilities before allowing them access to
the system. Such training shall assure that employees are versed in the
rules of the system, be consistent with guidance issued by NIST and
OPM, and apprise them about available assistance and technical secu-
rity products and techniques. Behavior consistent with the rules of the
system and periodic refresher training shall be required for continued
access to the system.
c) Personnel Controls. Screen individuals who are authorized to
bypass signiﬁcant technical and operational security controls of the
www.syngress.com
OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III • Appendix B
455

system commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm they
could cause. Such screening shall occur prior to an individual being
authorized to bypass controls and periodically thereafter.
d) Incident Response Capability. Ensure that there is a capability to
provide help to users when a security incident occurs in the system
and to share information concerning common vulnerabilities and
threats.This capability shall share information with other organiza-
tions, consistent with NIST coordination, and should assist the agency
in pursuing appropriate legal action, consistent with Department of
Justice guidance.
e) Continuity of Support. Establish and periodically test the capability
to continue providing service within a system based upon the needs
and priorities of the participants of the system.
f) Technical Security. Ensure that cost-effective security products and
techniques are appropriately used within the system.
g) System Interconnection. Obtain written management authoriza-
tion, based upon the acceptance of risk to the system, prior to con-
necting with other systems. Where connection is authorized, controls
shall be established which are consistent with the rules of the system
and in accordance with guidance from NIST.
3) Review of Security Controls. Review the security controls in each system
when signiﬁcant modiﬁcations are made to the system, but at least every three
years.The scope and frequency of the review should be commensurate with
the acceptable level of risk for the system. Depending on the potential risk and
magnitude of harm that could occur, consider identifying a deﬁciency pursuant
to OMB Circular No.A-123,“Management Accountability and Control” and
the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), if there is no assign-
ment of security responsibility, no security plan, or no authorization to process
for a system.
4) Authorize Processing. Ensure that a management ofﬁcial authorizes in
writing the use of each general support system based on implementation of its
security plan before beginning or signiﬁcantly changing processing in the
system. Use of the system shall be re-authorized at least every three years.
b.
Controls for Major Applications.
1) Assign Responsibility for Security.Assign responsibility for security of each
major application to a management ofﬁcial knowledgeable in the nature of the
information and process supported by the application and in the management,
personnel, operational, and technical controls used to protect it.This ofﬁcial
www.syngress.com
456
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

shall assure that effective security products and techniques are appropriately
used in the application and shall be contacted when a security incident occurs
concerning the application.
2) Application Security Plan. Plan for the adequate security of each major
application, taking into account the security of all systems in which the appli-
cation will operate.The plan shall be consistent with guidance issued by NIST.
Advice and comment on the plan shall be solicited from the ofﬁcial responsible
for security in the primary system in which the application will operate prior
to the plan’s implementation.A summary of the security plans shall be incorpo-
rated into the strategic IRM plan required by the Paperwork Reduction Act.
Application security plans shall include:
a) Application Rules. Establish a set of rules concerning use of and
behavior within the application.The rules shall be as stringent as nec-
essary to provide adequate security for the application and the infor-
mation in it. Such rules shall clearly delineate responsibilities and
expected behavior of all individuals with access to the application. In
addition, the rules shall be clear about the consequences of behavior
not consistent with the rules.
b) Specialized Training. Before allowing individuals access to the appli-
cation, ensure that all individuals receive specialized training focused
on their responsibilities and the application rules.This may be in addi-
tion to the training required for access to a system. Such training may
vary from a notiﬁcation at the time of access (e.g., for members of the
public using an information retrieval application) to formal training
(e.g., for an employee that works with a high-risk application).
c) Personnel Security. Incorporate controls such as separation of
duties, least privilege and individual accountability into the application
and application rules as appropriate. In cases where such controls
cannot adequately protect the application or information in it, screen
individuals commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm
they could cause. Such screening shall be done prior to the individ-
uals’ being authorized to access the application and periodically there-
after.
d) Contingency Planning. Establish and periodically test the capability
to perform the agency function supported by the application in the
event of failure of its automated support.
e) Technical Controls. Ensure that appropriate security controls are
speciﬁed, designed into, tested, and accepted in the application in
accordance with appropriate guidance issued by NIST.
f) Information Sharing. Ensure that information shared from the
www.syngress.com
OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III • Appendix B
457

application is protected appropriately, comparable to the protection
provided when information is within the application.
g) Public Access Controls. Where an agency’s application promotes or
permits public access, additional security controls shall be added to
protect the Integrity of the application and the conﬁdence the public
has in the application. Such controls shall include segregating informa-
tion made directly accessible to the public from ofﬁcial agency
records.
3) Review of Application Controls. Perform an independent review or audit of
the security controls in each application at least every three years. Consider
identifying a deﬁciency pursuant to OMB Circular No.A-123,“Management
Accountability and Control” and the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act
if there is no assignment of responsibility for security, no security plan, or no
authorization to process for the application.
4) Authorize Processing. Ensure that a management ofﬁcial authorizes in
writing use of the application by conﬁrming that its security plan as imple-
mented adequately secures the application. Results of the most recent review
or audit of controls shall be a factor in management authorizations.The appli-
cation must be authorized prior to operating and re-authorized at least every
three years thereafter. Management authorization implies accepting the risk of
each system used by the application.
4.Assignment of Responsibilities 
a.
Department of Commerce.The Secretary of Commerce shall:

the agency head to be material when weighed against other agency deﬁciencies, it
shall be included in the annual FMFIA report. Less signiﬁcant deﬁciencies shall be
reported and progress on corrective actions tracked at the appropriate agency level.
c.
Summaries of Security Plans.Agencies shall include a summary of their system
security plans and major application plans in the strategic plan required by the
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3506).
B. Descriptive Information.
The following descriptive language is explanatory. It is included to assist in under-
standing the requirements of the Appendix.
The Appendix re-orients the Federal computer security program to better respond to a
rapidly changing technological environment. It establishes government-wide responsibil-
ities for Federal computer security and requires Federal agencies to adopt a minimum
set of management controls.These management controls are directed at individual infor-
mation technology users in order to reﬂect the distributed nature of today’s technology.
For security to be most effective, the controls must be part of day-to-day operations.
This is best accomplished by planning for security not as a separate activity, but as an
integral part of overall planning.
“Adequate security” is deﬁned as “security commensurate with the risk and magnitude
of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modiﬁcation of
information.”This deﬁnition explicitly emphasizes the risk-based policy for cost-effec-
tive security established by the Computer Security Act.
The Appendix no longer requires the preparation of formal risk analyses. In the past,
substantial resources have been expended doing complex analyses of speciﬁc risks to sys-
tems, with limited tangible beneﬁt in terms of improved security for the systems. Rather
than continue to try to precisely measure risk, security efforts are better served by gen-
erally assessing risks and taking actions to manage them. While formal risk analyses need
not be performed, the need to determine adequate security will require that a risk-based
approach be used.This risk assessment approach should include a consideration of the
major factors in risk management: the value of the system or application, threats, vulner-
abilities, and the effectiveness of current or proposed safeguards.Additional guidance on
effective risk assessment is available in “An Introduction to Computer Security:The
NIST Handbook” (March 16, 1995).
Discussion of the Appendix’s Major Provisions.The following discussion is provided to
aid reviewers in understanding the changes in emphasis in the Appendix.
www.syngress.com
460
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

Automated Information Security Programs.Agencies are required to establish controls to
assure adequate security for all information processed, transmitted, or stored in Federal
automated information systems.This Appendix emphasizes management controls
affecting individual users of information technology.Technical and operational controls
support management controls.To be effective, all must interrelate. For example, authenti-
cation of individual users is an important management control, for which password pro-
tection is a technical control. However, password protection will only be effective if both
a strong technology is employed, and it is managed to assure that it is used correctly.
Four controls are set forth: assigning responsibility for security, security planning, peri-
odic review of security controls, and management authorization.The Appendix requires
that these management controls be applied in two areas of management responsibility:
one for general support systems and one for major applications.
The terms “general support system” and “major application” were used in OMB
Bulletins Nos. 88-16 and 90-08.A general support system is “an interconnected set of
information resources under the same direct management control which shares common
functionality.” Such a system can be, for example, a local area network (LAN) including
smart terminals that supports a branch ofﬁce, an agency-wide backbone, a communica-
tions network, a departmental data processing enter including its operating system and
utilities, a tactical radio network, or a shared information processing service organization.
Normally, the purpose of a general support system is to provide processing or communi-
cations support.
A major application is a use of information and information technology to satisfy a spe-
ciﬁc set of user requirements that requires special management attention to security due
to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse or unauthorized access
to or modiﬁcation of the information in the application.All applications require some
level of security, and adequate security for most of them should be provided by security
of the general support systems in which they operate. However, certain applications,
because of the nature of the information in them, require special management oversight
and should be treated as major.Agencies are expected to exercise management judge-
ment in determining which of their applications are major.
The focus of OMB Bulletins Nos. 88-16 and 90-08 was on identifying and securing
both general support systems and applications which contained sensitive information.
The Appendix requires the establishment of security controls in all general support sys-
tems, under the presumption that all contain some sensitive information, and focuses
extra security controls on a limited number of particularly high-risk or major applica-
tions.
a.
General Support Systems.The following controls are required in all general
support systems:
1) Assign Responsibility for Security. For each system, an individual should be a
focal point for assuring there is adequate security within the system, including
ways to prevent, detect, and recover from security problems.That responsibility
www.syngress.com
OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III • Appendix B
461

should be assigned in writing to an individual trained in the technology used
in the system and in providing security for such technology, including the
management of security controls such as user identiﬁcation and authentication.
2) Security Plan.The Computer Security Act requires that security plans be
developed for all Federal computer systems that contain sensitive information.
Given the expansion of distributed processing since passage of the Act, the pre-
sumption in the Appendix is that all general support systems contain some sen-
sitive information which requires protection to assure its Integrity,Availability,
or Conﬁdentiality, and therefore all systems require security plans.
Previous guidance on security planning was contained in OMB Bulletin No. 90-08.This
Appendix supersedes OMB Bulletin 90-08 and expands the coverage of security plans
from Bulletin 90-08 to include rules of individual behavior as well as technical security.
Consistent with OMB Bulletin 90-08, the Appendix directs NIST to update and expand
security planning guidance and issue it as a Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS). In the interim, agencies should continue to use the Appendix of OMB Bulletin
No. 90-08 as guidance for the technical portion of their security plans.
The Appendix continues the requirement that independent advice and comment on the
security plan for each system be sought.The intent of this requirement is to improve the
plans, foster communication between managers of different systems, and promote the
sharing of security expertise.
This Appendix also continues the requirement from the Computer Security Act that
summaries of security plans be included in agency strategic information resources man-
agement plans. OMB will provide additional guidance about the contents of those
strategic plans, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
The following speciﬁc security controls should be included in the security plan for a
general support system:
a)
Rules.An important new requirement for security plans is the establishment of
a set of rules of behavior for individual users of each general support system.These
rules should clearly delineate responsibilities of and expectations for all individuals
with access to the system.They should be consistent with system-speciﬁc policy as
described in “An Introduction to Computer Security:The NIST Handbook”
(March 16, 1995). In addition, they should state the consequences of non-compli-
ance.The rules should be in writing and will form the basis for security awareness
and training.
The development of rules for a system must take into consideration the needs of all par-
ties who use the system. Rules should be as stringent as necessary to provide adequate
security.Therefore, the acceptable level of risk for the system must be established and
should form the basis for determining the rules.
Rules should cover such matters as work at home, dial-in access, connection to the
Internet, use of copyrighted works, unofﬁcial use of government equipment, the assign-

462
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

ment and limitation of system privileges, and individual accountability. Often rules
should reﬂect technical security controls in the system. For example, rules regarding
password use should be consistent with technical password features in the system. Rules
may be enforced through administrative sanctions speciﬁcally related to the system (e.g.
loss of system privileges) or through more general sanctions as are imposed for violating
other rules of conduct. In addition, the rules should speciﬁcally address restoration of
service as a concern of all users of the system.
b) Training.The Computer Security Act requires Federal agencies to provide for the
mandatory periodic training in computer security awareness and accepted computer
security practice of all employees who are involved with the management, use or opera-
tion of a Federal computer system within or under the supervision of the Federal
agency.This includes contractors as well as employees of the agency.Access provided to
members of the public should be constrained by controls in the applications through
which access is allowed, and training should be within the context of those controls.The
Appendix enforces such mandatory training by requiring its completion prior to
granting access to the system. Each new user of a general support system in some sense
introduces a risk to all other users.Therefore, each user should be versed in acceptable
behavior — the rules of the system — before being allowed to use the system.Training
should also inform the individual how to get help in the event of difﬁculty with using
or security of the system.
Training should be tailored to what a user needs to know to use the system securely,
given the nature of that use.Training may be presented in stages, for example as more
access is granted. In some cases, the training should be in the form of classroom instruc-
tion. In other cases, interactive computer sessions or well-written and understandable
brochures may be sufﬁcient, depending on the risk and magnitude of harm.
Over time, attention to security tends to dissipate. In addition, changes to a system may
necessitate a change in the rules or user procedures.Therefore, individuals should peri-
odically have refresher training to assure that they continue to understand and abide by
the applicable rules.
To assist agencies, the Appendix requires NIST, with assistance from the Ofﬁce of
Personnel Management (OPM), to update its existing guidance. It also proposes that
OPM assure that its rules for computer security training for Federal civilian employees
are effective.
c) Personnel Controls. It has long been recognized that the greatest harm has come from
authorized individuals engaged in improper activities, whether intentional or accidental.
In every general support system, a number of technical, operational, and management
controls are used to prevent and detect harm. Such controls include individual account-
ability,“least privilege,” and separation of duties.
Individual accountability consists of holding someone responsible for his or her actions.
In a general support system, accountability is normally accomplished by identifying and
authenticating users of the system and subsequently tracing actions on the system to the
user who initiated them.This may be done, for example, by looking for patterns of
www.syngress.com
OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III • Appendix B
463

behavior by users.
Least privilege is the practice of restricting a user’s access (to data ﬁles, to processing
capability, or to peripherals) or type of access (read, write, execute, delete) to the min-
imum necessary to perform his or her job.
Separation of duties is the practice of dividing the steps in a critical function among dif-
ferent individuals. For example, one system programmer can create a critical piece of
operating system code, while another authorizes its implementation. Such a control
keeps a single individual from subverting a critical process.
Nevertheless, in some instances, individuals may be given the ability to bypass some sig-
niﬁcant technical and operational controls in order to perform system administration
and maintenance functions (e.g., LAN administrators or systems programmers).
Screening such individuals in positions of trust will supplement technical, operational,
and management controls, particularly where the risk and magnitude of harm is high.
d) Incident Response Capability. Security incidents, whether caused by viruses, hackers,
or software bugs, are becoming more common. When faced with a security incident, an
agency should be able to respond in a manner that both protects its own information
and helps to protect the information of others who might be affected by the incident.
To address this concern, agencies should establish formal incident response mechanisms.
Awareness and training for individuals with access to the system should include how to
use the system’s incident response capability.
To be fully effective, incident handling must also include sharing information con-
cerning common vulnerabilities and threats with those in other systems and other agen-
cies.The Appendix directs agencies to effectuate such sharing, and tasks NIST to
coordinate those agency activities government-wide.
The Appendix also directs the Department of Justice to provide appropriate guidance on
pursuing legal remedies in the case of serious incidents.
e) Continuity of Support. Inevitably, there will be service interruptions.Agency plans
should assure that there is an ability to recover and provide service sufﬁcient to meet the
minimal needs of users of the system. Manual procedures are generally NOT a viable
back-up option. When automated support is not available, many functions of the organi-
zation will effectively cease.Therefore, it is important to take cost-effective steps to
manage any disruption of service.
Decisions on the level of service needed at any particular time and on priorities in ser-
vice restoration should be made in consultation with the users of the system and incor-
porated in the system rules. Experience has shown that recovery plans that are
periodically tested are substantially more viable than those that are not. Moreover,
untested plans may actually create a false sense of security.
f) Technical Security.Agencies should assure that each system appropriately uses effective
security products and techniques, consistent with standards and guidance from NIST.
Often such techniques will correspond with system rules of behavior, such as in the
proper use of password protection.
The Appendix directs NIST to continue to issue computer security guidance to assist
www.syngress.com
464
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

agencies in planning for and using technical security products and techniques. Until
such guidance is issued, however, the planning guidance included in OMB Bulletin 90-
08 can assist in determining techniques for effective security in a system and in
addressing technical controls in the security plan.
g) System Interconnection. In order for a community to effectively manage risk, it must
control access to and from other systems.The degree of such control should be estab-
lished in the rules of the system and all participants should be made aware of any limita-
tions on outside access.Technical controls to accomplish this should be put in place in
accordance with guidance issued by NIST.
There are varying degrees of how connected a system is. For example, some systems will
choose to isolate themselves, others will restrict access such as allowing only e-mail con-
nections or remote access only with sophisticated authentication, and others will be fully
open.The management decision to interconnect should be based on the Availability and
use of technical and non-technical safeguards and consistent with the acceptable level of
risk deﬁned in the system rules.
3) Review of Security Controls.The security of a system will degrade over time, as the tech-
nology evolves and as people and procedures change. Reviews should assure that management,
operational, personnel, and technical controls are functioning effectively. Security controls may be
reviewed by an independent audit or a self review.The type and rigor of review or audit should
be commensurate with the acceptable level of risk that is established in the rules for the system
and the likelihood of learning useful information to improve security.Technical tools such as
virus scanners, vulnerability assessment products (which look for known security problems, con-
ﬁguration errors, and the installation of the latest patches), and penetration testing can assist in the
on-going review of different facets of systems. However, these tools are no substitute for a formal
management review at least every three years. Indeed, for some high-risk systems with rapidly
changing technology, three years will be too long.
Depending upon the risk and magnitude of harm that could result, weaknesses identi-
ﬁed during the review of security controls should be reported as deﬁciencies in accor-
dance with OMB Circular No.A-123,“Management Accountability and Control” and
the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act. In particular, if a basic management con-
trol such as assignment of responsibility, a workable security plan, or management autho-
rization are missing, then consideration should be given to identifying a deﬁciency.
4) Authorize Processing.The authorization of a system to process information, granted
by a management ofﬁcial, provides an important quality control (some agencies refer to
this authorization as accreditation). By authorizing processing in a system, a manager
accepts the risk associated with it.Authorization is not a decision that should be made
by the security staff.
Both the security ofﬁcial and the authorizing management ofﬁcial have security respon-
sibilities. In general, the security ofﬁcial is closer to the day-to-day operation of the
system and will direct or perform security tasks.The authorizing ofﬁcial will normally
have general responsibility for the organization supported by the system.
Management authorization should be based on an assessment of management, opera-
tional, and technical controls. Since the security plan establishes the security controls, it
www.syngress.com
OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III • Appendix B
465

should form the basis for the authorization, supplemented by more speciﬁc studies as
needed. In addition, the periodic review of controls should also contribute to future
authorizations. Some agencies perform “certiﬁcation reviews” of their systems periodi-
cally.These formal technical evaluations lead to a management accreditation, or “autho-
rization to process.” Such certiﬁcations (such as those using the methodology in FIPS
Pub 102 “Guideline for Computer Security Certiﬁcation and Accreditation”) can pro-
vide useful information to assist management in authorizing a system, particularly when
combined with a review of the broad behavioral controls envisioned in the security plan
required by the Appendix.
Re-authorization should occur prior to a signiﬁcant change in processing, but at least
every three years. It should be done more often where there is a high risk and potential
magnitude of harm.
b.
Controls in Major Applications. Certain applications require special manage-
ment attention due to the risk and magnitude of harm that could occur. For such
applications, the controls of the support system(s) in which they operate are likely
to be insufﬁcient.Therefore, additional controls speciﬁc to the application are
required. Since the function of applications is the direct manipulation and use of
information, controls for securing applications should emphasize protection of
information and the way it is manipulated.
1) Assign Responsibility for Security. By deﬁnition, major applications are high risk and require
special management attention. Major applications usually support a single agency function and
often are supported by more than one general support system. It is important, therefore, that an
individual be assigned responsibility in writing to assure that the particular application has ade-
quate security.To be effective, this individual should be knowledgeable in the information and
process supported by the application and in the management, personnel, operational, and tech-
nical controls used to protect the application.
2) Application Security Plans. Security for each major application should be addressed by a secu-
rity plan speciﬁc to the application.The plan should include controls speciﬁc to protecting infor-
mation and should be developed from the application manager’s perspective.To assist in assuring
its viability, the plan should be provided to the manager of the primary support system which the
application uses for advice and comment.This recognizes the critical dependence of the security
of major applications on the underlying support systems they use. Summaries of application secu-
rity plans should be included in strategic information resource management plans in accordance
with this Circular.
a) Application Rules. Rules of behavior should be established which delineate the
responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the application.
The rules should state the consequences of inconsistent behavior. Often the rules will be
associated with technical controls implemented in the application. Such rules should
include, for example, limitations on changing data, searching databases, or divulging
information.
b) Specialized Training.Training is required for all individuals given access to the appli-
cation, including members of the public. It should vary depending on the type of access
www.syngress.com
466
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

allowed and the risk that access represents to the security of the application and infor-
mation in it.This training will be in addition to that required for access to a support
system.
c) Personnel Security. For most major applications, management controls such as indi-
vidual accountability requirements, separation of duties enforced by access controls, or
limitations on the processing privileges of individuals, are generally more cost-effective
personnel security controls than background screening. Such controls should be imple-
mented as both technical controls and as application rules. For example, technical con-
trols to ensure individual accountability, such as looking for patterns of user behavior, are
most effective if users are aware that there is such a technical control. If adequate audit
or access controls (through both technical and non-technical methods) cannot be estab-
lished, then it may be cost-effective to screen personnel, commensurate with the risk
and magnitude of harm they could cause.The change in emphasis on screening in the
Appendix should not affect background screening deemed necessary because of other
duties that an individual may perform.
d) Contingency Planning. Normally the Federal mission supported by a major applica-
tion is critically dependent on the application. Manual processing is generally NOT a
viable back-up option. Managers should plan for how they will perform their mission
and/or recover from the loss of existing application support, whether the loss is due to
the inability of the application to function or a general support system failure.
Experience has demonstrated that testing a contingency plan signiﬁcantly improves its
viability. Indeed, untested plans or plans not tested for a long period of time may create
a false sense of ability to recover in a timely manner.
e) Technical Controls.Technical security controls, for example tests to ﬁlter invalid
entries, should be built into each application. Often these controls will correspond with
the rules of behavior for the application. Under the previous Appendix, application secu-
rity was focused on the process by which sensitive, custom applications were developed.
While that process is not addressed in detail in this Appendix, it remains an effective
method for assuring that security controls are built into applications.Additionally, the
technical security controls deﬁned in OMB Bulletin No. 90-08 will continue, until that
guidance is replaced by NIST’s security planning guidance.
f) Information Sharing.Assure that information which is shared with Federal organiza-
tions, State and local governments, and the private sector is appropriately protected
comparable to the protection provided when the information is within the application.
Controls on the information may stay the same or vary when the information is shared
with another entity. For example, the primary user of the information may require a
high level of Availability while the secondary user does not, and can therefore relax
some of the controls designed to maintain the Availability of the information.At the
same time, however, the information shared may require a level of Conﬁdentiality that
should be extended to the secondary user.This normally requires notiﬁcation and agree-
ment to protect the information prior to its being shared.

g) Public Access Controls. Permitting public access to a Federal application is an impor-
tant method of improving information exchange with the public.At the same time, it
introduces risks to the Federal application.To mitigate these risks, additional controls
should be in place as appropriate.These controls are in addition to controls such as “ﬁre-
walls” that are put in place for security of the general support system.
In general, it is more difﬁcult to apply conventional controls to public access systems,
because many of the users of the system may not be subject to individual accountability
policies. In addition, public access systems may be a target for mischief because of their
higher visibility and published access methods.
Ofﬁcial records need to be protected against loss or alteration. Ofﬁcial records in elec-
tronic form are particularly susceptible since they can be relatively easy to change or
destroy.Therefore, ofﬁcial records should be segregated from information made directly
accessible to the public.There are different ways to segregate records. Some agencies and
organizations are creating dedicated information dissemination systems (such as bulletin
boards or World Wide Web servers) to support this function.These systems can be on
the outside of secure gateways which protect internal agency records from outside
access.
In order to secure applications that allow direct public access, conventional techniques
such as least privilege (limiting the processing capability as well as access to data) and
Integrity assurances (such as checking for viruses, clearly labeling the age of data, or
periodically spot checking data) should also be used.Additional guidance on securing
public access systems is available from NIST Computer Systems Laboratory Bulletin
“Security Issues in Public Access Systems” (May, 1993).
3) Review of Application Controls.At least every three years, an independent review or
audit of the security controls for each major application should be performed. Because
of the higher risk involved in major applications, the review or audit should be indepen-
dent of the manager responsible for the application. Such reviews should verify that
responsibility for the security of the application has been assigned, that a viable security
plan for the application is in place, and that a manager has authorized the processing of
the application.A deﬁciency in any of these controls should be considered a deﬁciency
pursuant to the Federal Manager’s Financial Integrity Act and OMB Circular No.A-
123,“Management Accountability and Control.”
The review envisioned here is different from the system test and certiﬁcation process
required in the current Appendix.That process, however, remains useful for assuring that
technical security features are built into custom-developed software applications. While
the controls in that process are not speciﬁcally called for in this Appendix, they remain
in Bulletin No. 90-08, and are recommended in appropriate circumstances as technical
controls.
4) Authorize Processing.A major application should be authorized by the management
ofﬁcial responsible for the function supported by the application at least every three
years, but more often where the risk and magnitude of harm is high.The intent of this
requirement is to assure that the senior ofﬁcial whose mission will be adversely affected
www.syngress.com
468
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

by security weaknesses in the application periodically assesses and accepts the risk of
operating the application.The authorization should be based on the application security
plan and any review(s) performed on the application. It should also take into account
the risks from the general support systems used by the application.
4.Assignment of Responsibilities.The Appendix assigns government-wide responsibilities to
agencies that are consistent with their missions and the Computer Security Act.
a.
Department of Commerce.The Department of Commerce, through NIST, is assigned
the following responsibilities consistent with the Computer Security Act.
1) Develop and issue security standards and guidance.
2) Review and update, with assistance from OPM, the guidelines for security training
issued in 1988 pursuant to the Computer Security Act to assure they are effective.
3) Replace and update the technical planning guidance in the appendix to OMB
Bulletin 90-08 This should include guidance on effective risk-based security absent a
formal risk analysis.
4) Provide agencies with guidance and assistance concerning effective controls for sys-
tems when interconnecting with other systems, including the Internet. Such guidance
on, for example, so-called “ﬁrewalls” is becoming widely available and is critical to agen-
cies as they consider how to interconnect their communications capabilities.
5) Coordinate agency incident response activities. Coordination of agency incident
response activities should address both threats and vulnerabilities as well as improve the
ability of the Federal government for rapid and effective cooperation in response to
serious security breaches.
6) Assess security vulnerabilities in new information technologies and apprise Federal
agencies of such vulnerabilities.The intent of this new requirement is to help agencies
understand the security implications of technology before they purchase and ﬁeld it. In
the past, there have been too many instances where agencies have acquired and imple-
mented technology, then found out about vulnerabilities in the technology and had to
retroﬁt security measures.This activity is intended to help avoid such difﬁculties in the
future.
b.
Department of Defense.The Department, through the National Security Agency, should
provide technical advice and assistance to NIST, including work products such as technical
security guidelines, which NIST can draw upon for developing standards and guidelines for
protecting sensitive information in Federal computers.
Also, the Department, through the National Security Agency, should assist NIST in eval-
uating vulnerabilities in emerging technologies. Such vulnerabilities may present a risk
to national security information as well as to unclassiﬁed information.
www.syngress.com
OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III • Appendix B
469

c.
Department of Justice.The Department of Justice should provide appropriate guidance
to Federal agencies on legal remedies available to them when serious security incidents
occur. Such guidance should include ways to report incidents and cooperate with law
enforcement.
In addition, the Department should pursue appropriate legal actions on behalf of the
Federal government when serious security incidents occur.
d.
General Services Administration.The General Services Administration should provide
agencies guidance for addressing security considerations when acquiring information tech-
nology products or services.This continues the current requirement.
In addition, where cost-effective to do so, GSA should establish government-wide con-
tract vehicles for agencies to use to acquire certain security services. Such vehicles
already exist for providing system back-up support and conducting security analyses.
GSA should also provide appropriate security services to assist Federal agencies to the
extent that provision of such services is cost-effective.This includes providing, in con-
junction with the Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce, appro-
priate services which support Federal use of the National Information Infrastructure
(e.g., use of digital signature technology).
e.
Ofﬁce of Personnel Management. In accordance with the Computer Security Act, OPM
should review its regulations concerning computer security training and assure that they are
effective.
In addition, OPM should assist the Department of Commerce in the review and update
of its computer security awareness and training guidelines. OPM worked closely with
NIST in developing the current guidelines and should work with NIST in revising
those guidelines.
f.
Security Policy Board.The Security Policy Board is assigned responsibility for national
security policy coordination in accordance with the appropriate Presidential directive.This
includes policy for the security of information technology used to process classiﬁed informa-
tion.
Circular A-130 and this Appendix do not apply to information technology that supports
certain critical national security missions, as deﬁned in 44 U.S.C. 3502(9) and 10 U.S.C.
2315. Policy and procedural requirements for the security of national security systems
(telecommunications and information systems that contain classiﬁed information or that
support those critical national security missions (44 U.S.C. 3502(9) and 10 U.S.C. 2315))
is assigned to the Department of Defense pursuant to Presidential directive.The Circular
clariﬁes that information classiﬁed for national security purposes should also be handled
in accordance with appropriate national security directives. Where classiﬁed information
is required to be protected by more stringent security requirements, those requirements
should be followed rather than the requirements of this Appendix.
5. Reports.The Appendix requires agencies to provide two reports to OMB:
The ﬁrst is a requirement that agencies report security deﬁciencies and material weak-
nesses within their FMFIA reporting mechanisms as deﬁned by OMB Circular No.A-
www.syngress.com
470
Appendix B • OMB Circular A-130: Appendix III

123,“Management Accountability and Control,” and take corrective actions in accor-
dance with that directive.
The second, deﬁned by the Computer Security Act, requires that a summary of agency
security plans be included in the information resources management plan required by
the Paperwork Reduction Act.

1 PURPOSE
The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347), passed by the one hundred and seventh
Congress and signed into law by the President in December 2002, recognized the importance of
information security to the economic and national security interests of the United States.Title III
of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002
(FISMA), tasked NIST with responsibilities for standards and guidelines, including the develop-
ment of:
Standards to be used by all federal agencies to categorize all information and information systems
collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives of providing
appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in
each category; and 
Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and technical con-
trols), for information and information systems in each such category.
FIPS Publication 199 addresses the ﬁrst task cited—to develop standards for categorizing infor-
mation and information systems. Security categorization standards for information and informa-
tion systems provide a common framework and understanding for expressing security that, for the
federal government, promotes: (i) effective management and oversight of information security
programs, including the coordination of information security efforts throughout the civilian,
national security, emergency preparedness, homeland security, and law enforcement communities;
and (ii) consistent reporting to the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress on
the adequacy and effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices.
Subsequent NIST standards and guidelines will address the second and third tasks cited.
2 APPLICABILITY
These standards shall apply to: (i) all information within the federal government other than that
information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958, as amended by
Executive Order 13292, or any predecessor order, or by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classi-
ﬁed status; and (ii) all federal information systems other than those information systems designated
as national security systems as deﬁned in 44 United States Code Section 3542(b)(2). Agency ofﬁ-
cials shall use the security categorizations described in FIPS Publication 199 whenever there is a
federal requirement to provide such a categorization of information or information systems.
Additional security designators may be developed and used at agency discretion. State, local, and
tribal governments as well as private sector organizations comprising the critical infrastructure of
the United States may consider the use of these standards as appropriate.These standards are effec-
tive upon approval by the Secretary of Commerce.

3 CATEGORIZATION OF INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
This publication establishes security categories for both information1 and information systems.The
security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur
which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accom-
plish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulﬁll its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day
functions, and protect individuals. Security categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnera-
bility and threat information in assessing the risk to an organization.
1 Information is categorized according to its information type.An information type is a speciﬁc cat-
egory of information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, ﬁnancial, investigative, contractor sensitive,
security management) deﬁned by an organization or, in some instances, by a speciﬁc law, Executive
Order, directive, policy, or regulation.
Security Objectives
The FISMA deﬁnes three security objectives for information and information systems:
CONFIDENTIALITY
“Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for pro-
tecting personal privacy and proprietary information…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542] A loss of
Conﬁdentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.
INTEGRITY
“Guarding against improper information modiﬁcation or destruction, and includes ensuring infor-
mation non-repudiation and authenticity…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542] A loss of Integrity is the unau-
thorized modiﬁcation or destruction of information.
AVAILABILITY
“Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information…” [44 U.S.C., SEC. 3542] A loss of
Availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system.
Potential Impact on Organizations and Individuals 
FIPS Publication 199 deﬁnes three levels of potential impact on organizations or individuals should
there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability).The applica-
tion of these deﬁnitions must take place within the context of each organization and the overall
national interest.
www.syngress.com
FIPS 199 • Appendix C
477

The potential impact is LOW if—
– The loss of Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability could be expected to have a limited adverse
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.2
AMPLIFICATION: A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, or Availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and dura-
tion that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the func-
tions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor
ﬁnancial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.
The potential impact is MODERATE if— 
– The loss of Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability could be expected to have a serious adverse
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
AMPLIFICATION: A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, or Availability might: (i) cause a signiﬁcant degradation in mission capability to an extent
and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of
the functions is signiﬁcantly reduced; (ii) result in signiﬁcant damage to organizational assets; (iii)
result in signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss; or (iv) result in signiﬁcant harm to individuals that does not
involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.
2 Adverse effects on individuals may include, but are not limited to, loss of the privacy to which individuals are
entitled under law.
The potential impact is HIGH if— 
– The loss of Conﬁdentiality,Integrity,or Availability could be expected to have a severe or catas-
trophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
AMPLIFICATION: A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, or Availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission
capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its
primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major ﬁnancial
loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life
threatening injuries.
Security Categorization Applied to Information Types 
The security category of an information type can be associated with both user information and
system information3 and can be applicable to information in either electronic or non-electronic
form. It can also be used as input in considering the appropriate security category of an informa-
www.syngress.com
478
Appendix C • FIPS 199

tion system (see description of security categories for information systems below). Establishing an
appropriate security category of an information type essentially requires determining the potential
impact for each security objective associated with the particular information type.
The generalized format for expressing the security category, SC, of an information type is:
SC information type = {(Conﬁdentiality, impact), (Integrity, impact), (Availability, impact)},
where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, or NOT APPLICABLE.4
EXAMPLE 1:An organization managing public information on its web server determines that there is
no potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality (i.e., Conﬁdentiality requirements are not appli-
cable), a moderate potential impact from a loss of Integrity, and a moderate potential impact from
a loss of Availability.The resulting security category, SC, of this information type is expressed as:
SC public information = {(Conﬁdentiality, NA), (Integrity, MODERATE), (Availability, MODERATE)}.
EXAMPLE 2: A law enforcement organization managing extremely sensitive investigative information
determines that the potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality is high, the potential impact
from a loss of Integrity is moderate, and the potential impact from a loss of Availability is moderate.
The resulting security category, SC, of this information type is expressed as:
SC investigative information = {(Conﬁdentiality, HIGH), (Integrity, MODERATE), (Availability, MOD-
ERATE)}.
EXAMPLE 3:A ﬁnancial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy-related
information) determines that the potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality is low, the poten-
tial impact from a loss of Integrity is low, and the potential impact from a loss of Availability is low.
The resulting security category, SC, of this information type is expressed as:
SC administrative information = {(Conﬁdentiality, LOW), (Integrity, LOW), (Availability, LOW)}.
3 System information (e.g., network routing tables, password ﬁles, and cryptographic key management infor-
mation) must be protected at a level commensurate with the most critical or sensitive user information being
processed, stored, or transmitted by the information system to ensure Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
4 The potential impact value of not applicable only applies to the security objective of Conﬁdentiality.
Security Categorization Applied to Information Systems
Determining the security category of an information system requires slightly more analysis and
must consider the security categories of all information types resident on the information system.
For an information system, the potential impact values assigned to the respective security objectives
(Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, Availability) shall be the highest values (i.e., high water mark) from
www.syngress.com
FIPS 199 • Appendix C
479
479
Appendix C • FIPS 199

among those security categories that have been determined for each type of information resident
on the information system.5
The generalized format for expressing the security category, SC, of an information system is:
SC information system = {(Conﬁdentiality, impact), (Integrity, impact), (Availability, impact)},
where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH.
Note that the value of not applicable cannot be assigned to any security objective in the context of
establishing a security category for an information system.This is in recognition that there is a low
minimum potential impact (i.e., low water mark) on the loss of Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and
Availability for an information system due to the fundamental requirement to protect the system-
level processing functions and information critical to the operation of the information system.
EXAMPLE 4: An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting organization con-
tains both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine administrative informa-
tion. The management within the contracting organization determines that: (i) for the sensitive
contract information, the potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality is moderate, the potential
impact from a loss of Integrity is moderate, and the potential impact from a loss of Availability is
low; and (ii) for the routine administrative information (non-privacy-related information), the
potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality is low, the potential impact from a loss of Integrity
is low, and the potential impact from a loss of Availability is low.The resulting security categories,
SC, of these information types are expressed as:
SC contract information = {(Conﬁdentiality, MODERATE), (Integrity, MODERATE), (Availability, LOW)},
and 
SC administrative information = {(Conﬁdentiality, LOW), (Integrity, LOW), (Availability, LOW)}.
The resulting security category of the information system is expressed as:
SC acquisition system = {(Conﬁdentiality, MODERATE), (Integrity, MODERATE), (Availability, LOW)},
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective
from the information types resident on the acquisition system.
5 It is recognized that information systems are composed of both programs and information. Programs in exe-
cution within an information system (i.e., system processes) facilitate the processing, storage, and transmission
of information and are necessary for the organization to conduct its essential mission-related functions and
operations.These system processing functions also require protection and could be subject to security catego-
rization as well. However, in the interest of simpliﬁcation, it is assumed that the security categorization of all
information types associated with the information system provide an appropriate worst case potential impact for
the overall information system—thereby obviating the need to consider the system processes in the security

categorization of the information system.
EXAMPLE 5: A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system
controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military installation.The SCADA system
contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information.The management at the
power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired by the SCADA system, there is
no potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality, a high potential impact from a loss of Integrity,
and a high potential impact from a loss of Availability; and (ii) for the administrative information
being processed by the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality, a low
potential impact from a loss of Integrity, and a low potential impact from a loss of Availability.The
resulting security categories, SC, of these information types are expressed as:
SC sensor data = {(Conﬁdentiality, NA), (Integrity, HIGH), (Availability, HIGH)},
and 
SC administrative information = {(Conﬁdentiality, LOW), (Integrity, LOW), (Availability, LOW)}.
The resulting security category of the information system is initially expressed as:
SC SCADA system = {(Conﬁdentiality, LOW), (Integrity, HIGH), (Availability, HIGH)},
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective
from the information types resident on the SCADA system.The management at the power plant
chooses to increase the potential impact from a loss of Conﬁdentiality from low to moderate
reﬂecting a more realistic view of the potential impact on the information system should there be
a security breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of system-level information or processing
functions.The ﬁnal security category of the information system is expressed as:
SC SCADA system = {(Conﬁdentiality, MODERATE), (Integrity, HIGH), (Availability, HIGH)}.
Table 1 summarizes the potential impact deﬁnitions for each security objective—Conﬁdentiality,
Integrity, and Availability.
