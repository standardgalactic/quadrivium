Introduction
As photographers, we’re all interested in the same
thing, how to take and make better pictures. Pressing
the shutter release is just the start, though, and these
days what happens after the ‘decisive moment’ very
often has just as much impact on the making of great
photos.
If you’re reading this, you may already be using Corel
PaintShop Pro X6 or one of the earlier versions of the
application. And you’ve probably discovered that,
while
it
makes
some
things
very
simple
and
straightforward, there are depths to it that you’ve yet
to explore and understand. I’ve written PaintShop Pro
X6 for Photographers to help you do just that, develop
a comprehensive knowledge of PaintShop Pro X6
and build the skills you’ll need to use its tools more
effectively to produce great looking photos.
PaintShop Pro’s great strength is that it’s really easy
to use for most everyday editing jobs, but it also
provides
some
very
powerful
and
sophisticated
features that you can use, not just to rescue your
mistakes, but to transform good images into great
ones. In PaintShop Pro X6 for Photographers, I’ve
taken a similar approach, starting off with the simple
stuff and graduating to more advanced topics only
once you’ve got the skills and experience to tackle
them with confidence.
The book begins with an overview of PaintShop Pro
X6 and introduces the three workspaces – Manage,
Adjust, and Edit – that you’ll use to organize and work
on your photos, along with the most important tools
24

and features that you’ll be using. Managing a growing
library of many thousands of photos can be a
daunting task and so I’ve given over a whole chapter
to it. If you’ve got a sprawling collection of photos
spread over hard disks, DVDs and memory sticks
head straight to Chapter 2, The Manage Workspace,
where you’ll find out how to manage, tag and easily
find any of your photos from among many thousands.
Subsequent chapters cover everything you’re likely to
need or want to know about using PaintShop Pro X6
including improving your photos with basic editing
techniques. Chapter 4, subtitled Beyond the Basics,
takes your editing and image manipulation skills to the
next level. The following chapters cover, among other
things, working with selections and text, combining
images with layers and how to use masks, special
effects
and
advanced
editing
techniques,
and
Printing. Finally I show you how to use PaintShop Pro
X6’s sharing features to upload photos to Flickr,
Facebook and Google+ as well as the best way to
prepare images for upload to your own websites.
Each chapter concludes with step-by-step projects
where you can learn not just by reading about, but by
actually completing real-life photo editing projects.
You can download the images used in the projects
from
gopaintshoppro.co.uk, before moving on to use the
techniques demonstrated on your own work. The
step-by-step projects, like much of the material in the
rest of the book, is applicable to earlier versions of
PaintShop Pro, so if you’re still using PaintShop Pro
X1 to X5, there’s plenty you’ll find useful (but you
really should upgrade to X6!)

Chapter 1
The Basics
Introducing Corel PaintShop Pro X6
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• This chapter explains what PaintShop Pro X6 can
do and how it works. If you’re new to the program
I’d strongly recommend you start at the beginning
and read this chapter right through, it’ll put you in
a much better position when it comes to some of
the basic photo editing in Chapter 2. In fact, for
beginners,
taking
things
in
a
linear
fashion
chapter by chapter is the best way to use the
book as the simple stuff is dealt with early on and
it gets gradually more advanced as you go.
• Unlike the other chapters, there isn’t a lot of
hands-on stuff here, it’s mostly an explanation of
how PaintShop Pro X6 works. All the same, I’d
recommend you prop the book open in front of
you while you’re at your computer so you can
28

play with the menus, tools and features while
you’re reading about them.
• First off, the chapter covers PaintShop Pro X6’s
basic tools including the Learning Center which is
by far the best place to start if you’re new to the
application. If you’re in a big hurry to get started
on your own stuff, by the time you reach page 6
you’ll know enough to download your photos from
your camera and carry out basic guided tasks
using the Learning Center.
• Next, I provide an overview of PaintShop Pro’s
three workspaces – Manage, Adjust and Edit.
• The Manage workspace is where you organize
your photos into collections, assign star ratings,
caption them and add keyword tags. There are
lots of other things you can do in the Manage
workspace, I’ll describe them in a little more detail
later in this chapter and Chapter 2 is devoted
entirely to organizing your Photos using the
Manage workspace.
• The Adjust workspace is where you go to make
quick, everyday edits like rotating and cropping
photos. It also has some clever one-step filters
designed to improve image quality and other
easy-to-use tools for making tonal adjustments. I
look at the Adjustment workspace in more detail
in Chapter 3 – Improving your Photos: Basic
editing.
• Finally, the Edit workspace is for full-on image
editing; the only limits to which are your skill and
imagination. The Edit workspace offers a huge
array of tools that provide massive scope for
control over image adjustment and editing. I’ll
29

look at some of them later in this chapter and
from Chapter 4 onwards; most of what we’ll be
doing involves working in the Edit workspace.
• Following on are brief descriptions of some of
PaintShop Pro X6’s editing tools, then I take a
look at the features in this latest version. In
addition to the brand new stuff, I also take a look
at
features
that
were
introduced
in
earlier
versions.
• The four step-by-step projects – Exploring the
Learning
Center,
Straightening
an
image,
Perspective correction and Cropping pictures can
each be completed in just a few minutes with little
or no previous knowledge of the program – are a
nice easy start!
Installation: 32 or 64 bit?
Before we get onto working with PaintShop Pro X6, if
you’ve yet to install the program there are one or two
things that you should be aware of. One of the
biggest features of this new version of PaintShop Pro
is 64-bit compatibility. The 64-bit version of PaintShop
Pro X6 is the fastest yet and, on the right hardware,
runs much more quickly than earlier 32-bit versions.
You’ll
notice
the
speed
increase
mostly
when
performing processor-intensive tasks like applying
transformations and filters to images, or cataloguing
batches of photos, but it also makes a difference for
everyday operations like cropping, retouching and
making tone and color adjustments.
To run the 64-bit version of PaintShop Pro X6 you’ll
need to be running a 64-bit version of Windows on
your PC. If you’re not sure if your version of Windows
30

is 32- or 64-bit you can easily find out by clicking the
Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System
and Maintenance and then clicking System. This will
display a panel which tells you the system type i.e.
32- or 64-bit.
If you’re not running a 64-bit version of Windows don’t
worry, you can still install and use PaintShop Pro X6.
The installer gives you the option of installing the
either 32- or 64-bit versions of the program, or both.
Why would you want to install both 32- and 64-bit
versions? Well, the 64-bit version of PaintShop Pro
X6
is
compatible
with
many
64-bit
Photoshop
plug-ins, see the section on using plug-ins in Chapter
8 for more details. The problem is, it can’t run older
32-bit plug-ins, so if you have a favorite plug-in that
you’ve used with an earlier version of PaintShop Pro,
you’ll need to run the 32-bit version of PaintShop Pro
X6 to use it. If you choose to install both 32- and
64-bit versions of PaintShop Pro X6, each is installed
as a separate application with its own shortcut on the
Windows desktop.
Introduction: Basic Tools and Functions
Over the next few pages, I’ll explain the various
features of the PaintShop Pro X6 workspace and how
to use them to carry out basic photo editing tasks. I’d
recommend you read through the following section
while in front of your PC, so that you can try things out
and familiarize yourself with the basics of uploading,
organizing and editing your photos.
31

Fig 1.1 PaintShop Pro X6’s interface with three
workspaces – Manage, Adjust and Edit. This is the
Manage
workspace
in
Thumbnail
mode,
the
thumbnails shown are of photos in a folder called
Maurellas which is in the My Pictures folder and is
highlighted in the Navigation palette on the left. On
the right information about the currently selected
thumbnail is displayed.
Fig 1.2
32

This is the Adjust workspace which is used to make
quick adjustments using Smart Photo Fix (shown in
the Adjust palette on the left and other quick fix tools).
Notice the Organizer palette containing thumbnails is
now displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Fig 1.3 The Edit workspace, shown here, provides
more
advanced
tools
for
photo
editing
and
composition. These include layers, selections and
masks and an extensive range of retouching tools.
The Learning Center, shown on the right, can help
you find your way around and walk you through
editing tasks.
The Manage Workspace
More likely than not, you already have some photos
stored on your hard disk and you’ll want to open these
in PaintShop Pro X6. There are a number of ways you
can do this, but try to get into the habit of using the
Manage workspace from the start. Figure 1.1 shows
what the Manage workspace looks like, if yours
33

doesn’t look like this you need to click the Manage tab
in the middle of the top edge of the screen.
Chapter 2 explains in more detail how the Manage
workspace works, for now it will help you to know that
it makes finding and opening photos much easier
than selecting File > Open, though you’re welcome to
do it that way if you prefer.
The Manage workspace has four elements, the
Navigation palette on the left which shows files and
folders on your hard drive, a large thumbnail area in
the middle of the screen, called the Organizer palette,
which shows thumbnails of all the photos in the
currently selected folder in the Navigation palette, and
a preview of the selected thumbnail in the bottom left
corner. Finally, the Info palette on the right displays
metadata
for
the
selected
image
including
the
exposure details, time and date and IPTC metadata
such as captions, keyword tags and ratings.
Fig 1.4 This is what the Manage workspace looks
like in Preview mode, the Organizer palette moves to
34

the bottom of the screen to be replaced by a big
preview. This is useful if you want a good look at your
photos, but for organizing them thumbnail mode
(shown in Figure 2.1) is best.
There are a few important things about the way the
Manage workspace functions that you might find
helpful to know at this stage. The first is that there are
three viewing modes: the one we’ve been looking at is
called Thumbnail mode, and the others are called
Preview mode and Map Mode. To change between
them click one of the three mode buttons at the top
right of the Manage workspace. When you enter
Preview mode the preview image in the bottom left
expands to fill the
area in the center of the screen replacing the
thumbnail view and the Organizer palette is displayed
as a strip at the bottom of the screen.
Map mode displays the location of all the photos in
the currently selected folder on a Map of the World
and is great for viewing the location of photos you’ve
shot while travelling. In order for Map mode to work,
though, your photos will need to have the location
information present in their metadata. Some cameras
have a built in GPS that does this automatically;
others allow you to tag your photos with location data
using the GPS in your smartphone. If you have
neither a GPS-equipped camera nor one that can
connect with your smartphone via Wi-Fi you can use
the Map view to manually add location information to
your photos.
The
Navigation
palette
has
two
tabs
labelled
Collections and Computer. The Computer tab shows
35

the files and folders on your hard drive. This is quite
useful to begin with as you can locate a folder of
images anywhere on your PC, but there’s a lot of
clutter – folders that have nothing to do with your
photos – getting in the way. Click the Collections tab
at the top of the Navigation palette and you’ll see a
list that includes your Pictures folder, some Smart
Collections, which are collections of photos selected
using saved search criteria, and the option to display
thumbnails based on their star rating. The Collections
tab provides a far more useful way to organize and
find your photos because you can decide exactly what
appears on it and which images are displayed in the
Organizer
palette.
More
about
that
in
the
next
chapter.
36

Fig 1.5 The Navigation palette tabs. The Computer
tab (left) displays the files and folders on your PC,
useful for finding photos if you know where you put
them, but there’s a lot of clutter. The Collections tab
(right) shows only those folders you choose.
For now, let’s take a quick look at some of the
functions of the Navigator palette and how you can
use it to browse for photos on your PC. Start by
clicking the Computer tab at the top of the Navigator
palette, then click the triangle icon next to the hard
drive on which Windows is installed, it’s probably
37

called Local Disk (C:). Click the triangle next to the
Users folder, followed by the + sign next to your
username (in my case, ken). You should now be able
to see the My Pictures folder. Mine has sub-folders in
it so I need to select one of these to display the
thumbnails of the photos it contains in the Organizer
palette. When I do that the first image is automatically
selected and its information is displayed in the Info
palette on the right below the preview.
Now click the Collections tab, click the triangle next to
Folders and you’ll see your My Pictures folder right
there.
It’s
automatically
added
to
the
Folders
collection and it’s much easier to get to without all that
other stuff in the way. You can easily add other
folders by clicking Browse more folders at the top of
the folders list.
Notice there are five tabs on the Info palette labelled
General, EXIF, IPTC, People and Places. The first of
these tells you the file name, the date the photo was
taken, the rating, which you can change by clicking on
the stars, what keyword tags have been applied and,
if you scroll down, the caption and some other
information. EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File
format
and
it
contains
non-editable
information
recorded by the camera at the time of exposure. Click
the EXIF tab and you’ll see the exposure details, date
and time, camera make and model, resolution and a
lot of other stuff. EXIF information can include all
kinds of things down to the kind of metering mode you
used, whether the flash was fired and the focal length
of the lens.
38

IPTC
stands
for
International
Press
Telecommunications
Council
(these
acronyms,
usually named from the organizations and committees
that define these standards, aren’t particularly useful
to know, but there you are) and is a standard for
adding metadata to digital photos after they’ve been
taken. IPTC metadata can include things like your
name
and
address,
a
copyright
statement
and
caption. The distinction between EXIF and IPTC
metadata is that the former is recorded by the camera
at the time of exposure and is usually non-editable
and the latter is subsequently added by people and
can be edited. The Info palette and the information it
displays are described in more detail in Chapter 2.
The People tab displays the name tags you’ve added
to
photos
of
people
you
know.
You
can
use
PaintShop
Pro’s
face
recognition
feature
to
automatically find and identify people or you can tag
images manually. I’ll explain more about people
tagging in Chapter 2. Finally, the Places tab shows
the location of images that contain geopositional
metadata. It’s essentially a mini version of the Map
View and I’ll explain more about using geopositional
data in your photos in Chapter 2.
39

Fig 1.6 The General tab of the Info palette tells you
the file name, date taken, rating, tags and caption as
well
as
file
size
and
pixel
dimensions.
More
information is available on the EXIF and IPTC tabs.
The Organizer palette can be displayed in all three
workspaces which makes it easy to select any photo
from the currently selected folder or from a tray to
adjust or edit. The Navigator palette only appears in
the Manage workspace. To display it in the Adjust and
Edit workspaces click the Show/Hide Navigation
button on the Organizer palette. If you select an
image
in
the
Organizer
palette
in
the
Manage
workspace, when you switch to the Adjust or Edit
workspaces that image is open and ready to work on.
Alternatively you can right-click the thumbnail and
select Adjust Photo or Edit Photo from the menu.
The Adjust Workspace
40

The Adjust workspace was introduced in PaintShop
Pro X4. If you’re working with PaintShop Photo Pro
X3 or Paintshop Pro Photo X2 you’ll have something
called Express Lab which is similar, though less well
integrated. As I’ve said, the Adjust workspace is
where you carry out routine adjustments like cropping
and straightening, correcting color and exposure
problems, fixing red-eye caused by on-camera flash
and touching up spots and blemishes. I’m going to go
into more detail here than I did for the Manage
workspace because if you only read this chapter and
the next you’ll be well equipped to carry out the most
important tasks – organizing and basic photo editing.
The Adjust workspace is shown in Figure 1.2. As you
can see, it’s divided into four areas; there’s the
Organizer
palette,
familiar
from
the
Manage
workspace, at the bottom of the screen, the Adjust
palette on the left, a large preview area occupying
most of the screen on the top right and the Instant
Effects palette on the right.
Most of what goes on in the Adjust workspace
happens, appropriately enough, in the Adjust palette,
but before we look in detail at that I’ll explain what
some of the other controls are for. Above the Preview
area there’s a toolbar with a row of buttons top left
and top right. The buttons on the left are for saving
your work, sharing it, rotating photos left and right,
deleting and undo and redo. On the right are view
buttons for zooming to 100% view, fit in window, a
Pan tool for grabbing the image and moving it around
in the preview window when you’re zoomed in and, on
the extreme right, a zoom slider with + and –
magnifiers. Incidentally, if you get to the Adjust
41

workspace and find the image you want to adjust is
located in a different folder you can display the
Navigation
palette
by
clicking
the
Show/Hide
Navigation button on the top left corner of the
Organizer palette.
Fig 1.7 The Adjust workspace toolbar buttons are
divided into two groups. On the left – save, save as,
share, rotate left, rotate right, delete, undo and redo.
On the right – zoom to 100%, fit image to window,
pan tool and zoom tool.
At the top of the Adjust palette there’s a histogram
display. I look at histograms and how to interpret and
work with them in Chapter 3. Below the histogram the
(EXIF) exposure information is displayed and below
that is
a toolbar containing four tools – Crop, Straighten,
Red-eye, Makeover and a Clone brush. If you want to
know how to use some of these tools take a look at
the step-by-step projects at the end of this chapter.
42

Fig 1.8 The Adjust palette toolbar (l-r) Crop tool,
Straighten tool, Red-eye tool, Makeover tool and
Clone Brush.
Below the Adjust palette toolbar is the Smart Photo
Fix panel. Unless you’ve clicked on one of the tools
above the Smart Photo Fix panel (in which case just
click the Smart Photo Fix header to expand the panel)
the
control
sliders
will
be
displayed.
You
can
experiment with these to try and improve image
quality but it’s called ‘Smart’ photo fix for a reason;
click the ‘Suggest Settings’ button and it will do the
hard work for you, analyzing the image and deciding
what settings to apply to get the best results.
Below the Smart Photo Fix panel you’ll find a range of
other tools designed to produce improvements to your
photos
quickly
and
easily.
These
include
Color
Balance, Fill Light/Clarity, High Pass Sharpen and
Digital Noise removal. These are ‘simplified’ versions
of tools which are available in the Edit workspace and
described
briefly
later
in
this
chapter
and
demonstrated throughout the book. They’re included
in the Adjust workspace so that you can quickly
access and apply them without having to think too
much about the process. The point of the Adjust
workspace is to provide a place where you can scan
through all of your images from an event and apply
adjustments to those that need it.
43

Fig 1.9 The Smart Photo Fix panel has sliders for
Brightness, Shadows, Highlights and Saturation, but a
click on the Suggest settings button is often all that’s
required.
Of course, no matter how quick and simple the
adjustment you make, if you have to apply them
individually to hundreds of photos, its going to add up.
Thankfully PaintShop Pro X6 allows you to ‘capture’
the changes you make to a photo in the Adjust or Edit
workspaces and apply them to others.
The Edit Workspace
The Edit workspace is where you go for serious photo
editing work. The Adjust workspace is fine for quick
44

edits, the Edit workspace has the tools you’ll need to
carry
out
more
substantial
work.
In
the
Edit
workspace you can create
layers, superimposing photos on top of each other
and you can add masks to layers that work like
stencils, hiding some areas of the layers below and
revealing others. Sophisticated selection tools allow
you restrict edits and adjustments to parts of an
image and these selections can form the basis for
masks, which do the same thing only more flexibly.
As well as a wide range of editing tools, the Edit
workspace has a raft of special effects filters as well
as controls for adjusting tone, color and just about
every other factor that affects how a digital photo
appears. Using these tools you can fix exposure
problems, remove color casts, change the color of
individual objects in photos, sharpen or blur them,
remove scratches and digital noise, remove people,
cats, lamp posts or anything else, make old photos
look like new and new ones look old, produce one
good photo from several not so good ones and a lot
more besides.
Figure 1.3 shows the Edit workspace. The main
components of this workspace are the Menu bar and
Standard toolbar at the top of the screen, below that
the Tool Options palette, then the image window and
at the bottom of the screen the by now familiar
Organizer palette. The Tools toolbar is the long
narrow strip on the left which contain all of the Edit
workspace tools. When you hover over a tool its
name is displayed in a tool tip and its function is
explained in the status bar at the very bottom of the
45

screen. Finally on the right of the screen is the
Learning Center palette.
The Learning Center
The Learning Center appears on the right of the
screen in the Edit workspace and shows you how to
get things done. If you can’t see the Learning Center
select View > Palettes > Learning Center, or press the
F10 key on your keyboard.
For simple tasks, like rotating photos, the Learning
Center just does it for you. For more complex tasks
involving several steps, the Learning Center walks
you through, step-by-step, selecting the tools for the
job at the appropriate moment.
Because the Learning Center selects the tools for you
and tells you how to use them, after a while, you’ll find
you no longer need it for common tasks like cropping,
straightening and rotating photos – when you know
how, it’s quicker and easier to do it yourself. When the
time comes you can close the Learning Center palette
(press F10 again) to make more room for your photos
and other palettes.
The Learning Center works like a website. The home
page contains seven topics – Get Photos, Adjust,
Retouch and Restore, Collage, Text and Graphics,
Effects and Print and Share. You can return to this
page at any time by clicking the Home button at the
top of the palette.
46

Fig 1.10
The Learning Center home.
47

Fig 1.11 The Effects tab.
Each topic has a number of projects, click Effects and
you’ll find eight projects that demonstrate, among
other things how to use the Time Machine to create
vintage-style photos, converting photos to black and
white and distorting photos. Click either the Home or
Back buttons at the top of the palette to return to the
home page. I’m not going to go through each of the
projects in the Learning Center because they don’t
need any explanation. Why not try them out for
yourself.
The Menu Bar
48

PaintShop Pro X6’s menu system gives you access to
most of the program’s tools, commands and features.
There are other ways to access them, but the Menu
bar lays them all out for you in a logical organized
fashion. If you’re not sure where something is, a quick
skim through the menus will usually reveal it. For
example, if you want to apply a special effects filter
there’s a good chance you’ll find what you’re looking
for somewhere in the Effects menu. Anything to do
with making tonal and color adjustments is on the
Adjust menu and stuff to do with displaying tool bars,
palettes, grids, guides and organizing the workspace
is on the View menu (except workspace presets
which, for some reason, are on the File menu).
Some menu items are nested in sub-menus. When I
refer to these in the book, they are denoted using the
> character. For example, the Levels command on
the Brightness and Contrast sub-menu of the Adjust
menu is shown as Adjust > Brightness and Contrast >
Levels.
Another useful piece of information you’ll find on
menus is keyboard shortcuts. You’ll probably be
familiar with Ctrl-c and Ctrl-v to copy and paste, after
a while it will become second nature to you to press
Shift-H to adjust Hue/Saturation/Lightness rather than
selecting
Adjust
>
Hue
and
Saturation
>
Hue/
Saturation/Lightness.
49

Fig 1.12 The menu bar with Adjust and Brightness
and Contrast sub-menus selected.
Toolbars
Now that you know how to use the Organizer to find
and open photos into PaintShop Pro X6 and you can
carry out simple guided projects using the Learning
Center, it’s time to take a look at some of the other
parts of the PaintShop Pro X6 Edit workspace.
The narrow strip of buttons running down the left side
of the screen is the Tools toolbar. If you need to
select part of a photo, crop it, straighten it, retouch it,
add text or fix problems like red eye, this is where
you’ll find the tools for the job.
PaintShop Pro X6 displays tool tips when you hover
with your mouse pointer over each of the tools and
this is a good way to familiarize yourself with each
tool’s function. As well as the tool tips, the Status bar
at the very bottom of the screen provides some
guidance on how to use each tool.
There are several other toolbars, some of them, like
the
Standard
toolbar,
are
visible
in
the
default
50

workspace
and
some
need
to
be
activated
by
selecting them from the Toolbars sub-menu of the
View menu.
The different toolbars group together similar tools and
functions which you’re likely to need for a specific
photo editing task or which it seems logical to keep in
the same place. On the Standard toolbar at the top of
the screen you’ll find tools for creating, opening and
saving
photos,
scanning
and
printing,
resizing,
rotating and displaying photo information.
Other toolbars include the Effects, Photo, Script and
Web toolbars. Some of these you’ll use rarely, or
possibly not at all, which is one of the reasons they’re
tucked away, so as not to clutter up the workspace.
I’ve already mentioned that you can toggle the
toolbars on and off by selecting them from the View >
Toolbars menu, (you can also hide toolbars and
palettes by clicking their close box) and you can float
or dock any of the toolbars by dragging the title bar.
To dock a toolbar, drag it to one of the top, bottom or
side edges of the main picture window where it will
snap into place. To float a toolbar, drop it anywhere
away from one of the docking edges.
51

Fig 1.13 The Tools toolbar sits on the left of the main
picture window. Hover over the tools to display a
52

tooltip naming the tool and a brief explanation of its
function in the Status bar at the bottom of the screen.
From the top: Pan + Zoom tool, Pick + Move,
Selection + Freehand Selection + Magic Wand,
Dropper, Crop, Straighten + Perspective Correction,
Red-Eye
+Makeover,
Clone
Brush
+
Scratch
Remover + Object Remover, Paint Brush + Airbrush,
Lighten/Darken + Dodge + Burn + Smudge + Push +
Soften + Sharpen + Emboss + Saturation Up/Down +
Hue Up/Down + Change to target + Color Replacer,
Eraser + Background Eraser, Flood Fill + Color
Changer, Picture Tube, Text tool, Preset Shape tool +
Rectangle + Ellipse + Symmetric Shape, Pen tool,
Warp Brush + Mesh Warp, Oil Brush + Chalk + Pastel
+ Crayon + Colored Pencil + Marker + Palette Knife +
Smear + Art Eraser.
Fig 1.14 To activate toolbars select them from the
View>Toolbars menu. The Standard Toolbar appears
in the default workspace and contains among other
things filing commands, rotate buttons, undo and redo
commands, zoom buttons and the palettes menu.
Have
a
play
around
with
showing,
hiding
and
re-arranging
the
PaintShop
Pro
X6
workspace
elements. Before you do though, first select File >
Workspace > Save and save your existing setup as
‘default_workspace’
or
something
similar.
When
you’ve everything setup the way you want, save this
53

new arrangement as ‘favorite_workspace’. Now, to
return the workspace to either of these arrangements
you just need to select Workspace > load and choose
the one you want.
Tip
To
reset
Preferences,
including
the
default
workspace layouts, hold down the shift key when
you launch PaintShop Pro Photo X4.
Photo Toolbar
If you deal with scanned or digital photos, this is the
toolbar to get friendly with. The Backlighting and Fill
Flash tools help to correct exposure problems caused
by problematic lighting conditions, and the Chromatic
Aberration and Digital Camera Noise Removal filters
help reduce colored fringing and noise problems that
can occur in digital photos. You can add tools for
common photo enhance operations like Levels, for
example, by right-clicking any of the toolbar buttons
and selecting Customize from the contextual menu.
Effects Toolbar
If you have had no experience using PaintShop Photo
Pro but are curious how its effects might look when
applied to a picture, click the first button on the Effects
toolbar – the Browse Presets button. This loads and
displays the Effects Browser, displaying all of the
available adjustment and effect filter presets. Click on
a folder to see the entire contents, all of the artistic
effects for example, or choose an individual preset
from within one of the folders. Double-click the effect
you like the look of in the Browser, and PaintShop
54

Photo Pro transfers it to the photo in the work area. In
this way you can preview the filter effect and save
time by only trying effects that you like the look of.
What else is there on the Effects toolbar? Buttonize,
Drop Shadow, Inner Bevel, Gaussian Blur, Hot Wax,
Brush Strokes, Colored Foil, Emboss, Fur, Lights,
Polished Stone, Sunburst and Topography. All are
preset filter effects that can be applied to a selection,
or globally, depending on application. All can be
customized through the displayed options window.
Customized filter sets can also be saved in the same
way as customized tools.
Script Toolbar
While strictly not a tool as such, scripting offers
incredible power to anyone with a bit more than the
most basic of photo-editing requirements. What’s
scripting all about? As the name might suggest, a
script is a file of instructions that produce a series of
actions or effects – much in the same way that a
play’s script, when followed by a group of actors,
produces actions that result in a play.
PaintShop
Pro
ships
with
a
wide
range
of
pre-recorded scripts but the fun really begins when
you start to record your own. The Script toolbar is set
up just like a video recorder. Press ‘Record’; perform
the actions you want on the selected picture (i.e.
rotate + change contrast + save). It’s that easy. Once
saved, the script can be run on other pictures in the
work area. It’s a great way to automate jobs that
require repetitive actions applied to multiple pictures
(e.g., in website design).
55

Web Toolbar
Put together specifically for web designers, this small
toolbar contains an ‘Image Slicer’ tool, an ‘Image
Mapper’
tool,
‘JPEG’,
‘GIF’
and
‘PNG’
image
optimizers plus a ‘Web Browser Preview’ feature,
‘Seamless Tiling’ and a ‘Buttonize’ feature – most of
the tools, in fact, needed to prepare images for your
own website.
Tool Options and other Palettes
A tool wouldn’t be very useful if it did only one thing,
and PaintShop Pro X6’s tools are nothing if not
versatile. The Tool Options palette is what gives tools
their versatility, allowing you to change settings that
modify the selected tool’s behavior.
Tip
For lacklustre digital photos, start with the One Step
Photo Fix. This versatile command applies six
different processes to the image: Automatic Color
Balance, Automatic Contrast Enhancement, Clarify,
Automatic
Saturation
Enhancement,
Edge
Preserving Smooth and Sharpen.
Fig 1.15 Tool options for the Paint Brush.
56

The Tool Options palette automatically displays the
available settings for the selected tool. So, when you
select the Paint Brush Tool, the Tool Options palette
displays
size,
shape,
density
opacity
and
other
options. Switch to the Selection tool and the Tool
Options
palette
displays
selection
type,
mode,
feathered edge and other selection options.
Try selecting a few different tools and looking at what
aspects of their behavior can be modified using the
Tool Options palette. Don’t worry if it’s not clear at this
stage what they do or how they work. As you
progress through the book, you’ll discover how to use
them in practice. Right now it’s enough to know that,
along with the Tools toolbar, the Tool Options palette
is one of PaintShop Pro X6’s most useful assets.
We’ve already talked about two other palettes – the
Learning Center and Organizer. PaintShop Pro X6’s
other
palettes
include
the
Layers,
Materials,
Histogram and History palettes. The Materials palette
is used to select colors, gradients and patterns for all
of the painting a drawing tools.
57

Fig
1.16 The
Materials
palette
(1)
is
used
for
selecting
foreground
and
background
colors,
gradients and patterns for all the painting and drawing
tools. The Material Properties dialog (2) (click the
foreground or background swatch) is used to fine-tune
color selection, create gradients and choose pattern
and texture swatches (3).
Other Features
The final part of this first chapter is a brief introduction
to some of the other useful tools and features that
PaintShop Pro X6 has to offer. Some of these
features, for example Skin smoothing and One Step
Purple Fringe Fix, are mentioned here because,
although they can be very useful, there isn’t space to
include a more detailed explanation of how they work
or examples of them in use. Others, like HDR,
Camera RAW Lab, Instant Effects and the Smart
Carver, you’ll be finding out more about in the
upcoming chapters and projects.
58

Smart Selection Brush
The Smart selection brush is new to PaintShop Pro
X6 and provides a very quick and simple way to make
accurate selections of elements that previously would
have been a challenge even for experienced photo
editors. It’s a brush tool, so you just paint over the
area you want to select and the Smart selection brush
does the rest, automatically detecting edges and
snapping your
selection to them. You can find out more about the
Smart selection brush and how to use it in Chapter 5.
Auto Selection Tool
Like the Smart selection brush the Auto selection tool
is a new introduction to PaintShop Pro X6 that
simplifies the job of making complex selections.
Imagine a rectangular selection tool that shrinks to fit
elements within its boundary – draw a box around
something, a dog, a tree, a cloud, whatever – and the
Auto selection tool automatically works out where it
begins and ends and draws a tight-fitting selection
boundary around it. Simple.
Instant Effects Palette
The
Instant
effects
palette
was
introduced
in
PaintShop Pro X5; it shows all of PaintShop Pro’s
effects filters organized by category and allows you to
browse and apply them more easily than using the
Effects
browser.
The
Instant
effects
palette
is
displayed by default in the Adjust workspace, but you
can use it in either of the other workspaces, just
select View > Palettes > Instant Effects or press
59

Shift-F2. Double-click a thumbnail to apply it to the
current image.
Retro Lab
The Retro Lab is designed to produce a variety of
effects ranging from a Lomo style toy camera effect to
vintage film stock, but it’s actually quite versatile and
you can use it to create a wide variety of grungy
effects which, as with most other PaintShop Pro
effects, you can then save as a preset. It has several
presets of its own, but there’s a lot more to be gained
if you experiment with the numerous controls it
provides.
Find People
If you never take photos of people you know, this one
won’t be of any interest. But if like most of us you’ve
got lots of photos of friends and family, Find people
will be enormously useful. It allows you to attach
name tags to photos of people you know, either
manually or by using PaintShop Pro’s face recognition
software.
Once
they’re
tagged
it’s
easy
to
find
pictures of people. You’ll find more on how to do that
in Chapter 2.
Photo Mapping
I introduced Photo mapping a little earlier in this
chapter and I’ll explain how it works in more detail in
the step-by-step project at the end of chapter 2. Like
Find people, it relies on metadata in your photos – in
this case geoposition co-ordinates identifying the
geographic location where the picture was taken. This
can be added automatically in a GPS-equipped
camera, or you can do it manually later. Using the
60

data in the images PaintShop Pro can show you the
location of your photos on a map.
Share My Trip
Share my trip allows you to include up to 200 photos
in a map-based interactive slideshow that you can
post to your blog or to Dropbox.
HDR
HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. The dynamic
range in a photo is the range of tones that are
represented,
from
pure
white
to
solid
black.
PaintShop Pro X6’s HDR tools combine several
bracketed exposures to better represent the wide
tonal range in some subjects and avoid blown-out
highlights and filled-in shadows. Earlier versions of
PaintShop Pro had HDR Photo Merge, but PaintShop
Pro X6 improves the merge algorithm and introduces
a new batch merge feature.
Photo Blend
Photo Blend lets you combine two or more photos of
the same scene so that you can swap or remove
unwanted details. This is perfect for group shots
where, for example, one person has their eyes
closed. You can combine the best bits from several
photos to make one really good one.
Selective Focus
Selective Focus simulates the shallow depth of field
that’s typical of a specialist tilt-shift lens and often
makes real-life subjects look like miniaturized models.
It’s an effect that has become very popular – if you
61

haven’t seen it before (where have you been?) got to
flickr.com and search tilt-shift.
Fig 1.17 PaintShop Pro X6’s selective focus feature
simulates the shallow depth of field produced by
specialist tilt-shift lenses.
Fill Light/Clarity
Fill light/Clarity is a new adjustment that comes in two
parts. Fill light works a bit like the existing Fill Flash,
which
is
more
effective
at
brightening
shadows
without affecting other areas. According to Corel
Clarity ‘enhances subtle yet important details’, the
overall effect is to make lifeless detail ‘pop’.
62

Fig 1.18 The Fill light/Clarity filter in action – before
(left) and after (right).
Social Media Integration
You can share your photos on Flickr, Facebook and
Google+ directly from PaintShop Pro X6. In Chapter
10, I explain how it works as well as looking at other
ways of using photos on the Web.
Camera RAW Lab
Camera RAW Lab is PaintShop Pro X6’s module for
processing camera RAW files. It’s recently been
enhanced with an improved histogram and new
highlight recovery options.
Quick Review
63

Quick review isn’t new, but it’s been recently updated
and
is
now
much
more
useful
than
its
slideshow-based
predecessor.
It’s
an
Organizer
feature that displays a full-screen preview of the
Organizer palette. Quick Review can be
used to scan through a folder of images, delete the
ones you don’t want and rate and rotate the rest. It’s
full-screen, so you get a good look at the images and
you can use the keyboard to navigate. To launch it
double-click any thumbnail in the Manage workspace.
Fig 1.19 The Quick Review space is great for quickly
rating your photos.
Multi-photo Editing
PaintShop Pro provides an easy way to apply all of
the edits you make to a photo to other photos in the
Organizer. This is an extremely useful thing to be able
to do and has the potential to drastically reduce the
64

amount of time you spend for editing. Let’s say you’ve
downloaded a card full of images from your camera
and
want
to
prepare
them
for
a
slideshow
presentation. You select the first image, open it in the
Adjust workspace, apply the Smart Photo Fix, adjust
the color using Color Balance, then sharpen it before
saving the image.
These are general edits that you’d like to apply to
every image, so back in the Organizer you select the
image and click the Capture Editing button on the
toolbar. Now you just need to select the photos you
want to apply the same editing process to and click
the Apply Editing button and you’re done. There are
other ways to apply a sequence of editing steps to
multiple photos, but none are as quick and easy as
this.
Smart Carver
The Smart Carver is like an intelligent crop tool. It
changes the dimensions of a photo without distorting
the content by removing parts of the image that have
little structural detail. You can also use the Smart
Carver to target specific
parts of the image that you want to remove. Used in
this way, it’s great for removing unwanted and
distracting bits of photos like lamp posts, cars, trees
or even people.
Object Extractor
The Object extractor makes it easy to isolate and
cutout part of an image from its background. While
the conventional selection tools require some skill and
patience to get a good result, using the Object
65

extractor is a much simpler process. You just paint an
outline around the thing you want to extract, fill the
area inside then click process to preview the result.
You can then refine the result using Edit Mask.
Vibrancy
To adjust the saturation of colors in a photo you can
use
the
Hue/Saturation/Lightness
controls.
The
problem with increasing saturation, though, is that
some
colors
can
become
over-saturated
and
unnatural-looking.
Vibrancy
is
a
more
subtle
saturation controller – it increases saturation, but
rather than a blanket increase only those colors that
lack saturation are boosted. This makes it ideal for
giving a boost to skin tones in portraits and in other
images which have a mix of strongly saturated and
more muted hues.
Raw Format Support
PaintShop Pro X6 can open and edit images shot in
your camera’s – proprietary camera RAW format. For
advanced photographers, there are many advantages
to doing this not the least of which is the potential to
produce better quality images than if you shoot using
the jpg file format to capture images. The Organizer
can display thumbnails for RAW images and when
you open them they are initially processed using
Camera Raw Lab. PaintShop Pro X6 extends the
range of camera RAW formats supported; you can
find a list of supported camera RAW formats on the
Corel website at www.corel.com. You can find out
more about processing RAW files in Chapter 2 and in
the Step-by-step project at the end of Chapter 3.
66

Auto-Preserve Originals
It’s always a good idea to back up your photos onto a
CD or DVD so that, should the worst happen, you’ve
always got the originals somewhere safe. Likewise,
before you begin work on a photo in PaintShop Pro
X6 it’s always a good idea to leave the original
untouched and work on a copy. One way of doing this
is to select ‘Save As’ from the File menu and save the
photo with a different name and/or in a different
location (I sometimes create a folder inside the folder
containing the downloaded photos and call it ‘edited’).
PaintShop Pro X6’s Auto-Preserve Originals feature
takes care of this for you by saving the original in a
sub-folder of the current folder. You can
either use this in addition to the backup steps I’ve
already suggested or instead of using ‘Save As’ to
create a copy. Auto-Preserve Originals is on by
default, to turn it off select File > Preferences >
General Program Preferences, select Auto-Preserve
from the list on the left then uncheck the box and click
OK.
Layer Styles
Layer Styles are live editable effects that can be
applied to raster and vector layers. There are six
Layer
styles
–
Reflection,
Outer
Glow,
Bevel,
Emboss, Inner Glow and Drop Shadow. To apply
Layer styles, double-click a layer in the Layers palette
and select the Layer styles tab in the Layer Properties
dialog box. Most of the Layer styles have basic
controls – to adjust the size, position and opacity of a
drop shadow, for example. You can edit Layer styles
at any time by reopening the Layer Properties Dialog
67

box and adjusting the settings. And when you edit a
layer which has a Layer style applied, the style
automatically updates.
Fig 1.20 PaintShop Pro X6 Layer Styles include
Reflection, Outer Glow, Bevel, Emboss, Inner Glow
and Drop Shadow.
Visible Watermarks
Watermarking your images is one way of preventing
copyright
theft.
PaintShop
Pro
X6’s
visible
watermarks make it easy for you to add a logo, or
other text or graphic to your photos. You’ll find a
step-by-step project that shows you how to add a
visible watermark and copyright message to your
photos at the end of Chapter 10.

The Color Changer tool lets you change pixel colors
at
a
stroke
and
provides
sophisticated,
but
easy-to-use, selection methods so that only those
pixels you want to recolor are affected. You can use
the Color Changer tool to change the color of clothing,
paintwork or pretty much anything at a stroke. There’s
a step-by-step project using the Color Changer tool at
the end of Chapter 8.
Skin Smoothing
Removing wrinkles and blemishes is one of the most
difficult
retouching
tasks;
even
professional
retouchers find it a challenge. PaintShop Photo Pro’s
Skin Smoothing feature makes it easy to remove
wrinkles and skin blemishes, taking years off your
portrait subjects.
Riff File Format Support
You can save PaintShop Photo Pro files in the Riff file
format used by Corel Painter and Corel Painter
Essentials. These programs provide natural media
painting effects and tools, which can be used to
simulate traditional media.
Time Machine
Some photo applications have an ‘antique’ effect;
PaintShop’s Time Machine filter goes much further,
providing a range of effects that simulate historical
photographic processes such as the Daguerreotype
and Platinotype.
Film and Filters
Film and Filters does two things. First it allows you to
simulate the particular look of some color film stock.
69

In the days of film, photographers would choose a
particular
emulsion
for
the
look.
Portrait
photographers would choose a film for the way it
rendered skin tones; for landscapes an emulsion that
rendered rich earth tones and natural looking blue
skies would be appropriate. Film and Filters has
seven film looks to choose from including Muted
Reds, Vibrant foliage and Glamour. Additionally you
can apply creative filters from a range of six including
Night Effect, Warming, Orange, Champagne and
Sunset. You can also create your own custom filters.

Time Machine applies ageing effects to photos based
on historical photographic processes – this one
simulates
the
Daguerreotype;
also
available,
in
chronological
order,
are
Albumen,
Cyanotype,
Platinum,
Autochrome,
Box
camera
and
Cross
process – a more recent photo lab technique.
Depth of Field
Creating artificial depth offield effects to simulate
using a wide apertureand throwing the background
out of focus isn’t difficult, but it takes time and a little
skill. Corel PaintShop Pro’s Depth of Field effect
makes it a lot simpler.
Makeover Tools
The Blemish Fixer, Toothbrush and Suntan Brush can
give your portraits an instant lift with very little effort.
The Blemish Fixer can also be used for where a more
subtle effect than the Clone Brush is needed.
Red-Eye Tool
A much more straightforward tool than PaintShop
Pro’s earlier red-eye removal tool; just set the tool
size and click on the eyes.
71

Fig 1.22
The Depth of Field effect simulates narrow depth of
field achieved in camera by shooting with a wide open
lens aperture.
Object Remover
Like the Clone Brush, but easier to use, the Object
Remover seamlessly replaces unwanted detail in a
photo, such as a lamp post, tree or other distracting
background detail, with another part of the image.
One Step Purple Fringe Fix
72

A common problem with digital cameras, purple
fringing is caused by lens aberrations. Purple fringing
usually
shows
up
as
a
purple
fringe
around
high-contrast edges like tree branches against a
bright sky. The One Step Purple Fringe Fix does
exactly what it says.
High-Pass Sharpen
High-pass sharpening is a professional sharpening
technique
that
has
some
advantages
over
conventional unsharp masking, mainly it’s less likely
to exaggerate noise and produce haloing.
Color Balance
If you don’t know your additive from your subtractive
primaries, then PaintShop Pro’s new Color Balance
tool is the one for you. It automatically adjusts the
white balance to remove color casts, then all you
need to decide is whether you want to warm the
colors up, or cool them down. There’s also an
advanced mode.
Black and White and Infra-Red Conversion Filters
These effects allow you to easily convert your images
to black and white and to simulate shooting with
infra-red and black and white film with colored filters
for enhanced tonal reproduction.
One Step Noise Removal
PaintShop
Pro’s
Digital
Noise
Removal
provides
powerful tools for cleaning up noisy images providing
you have the time and know-how to use it effectively.
For everyone else, there’s One Step Noise Removal.
73

Color Management
PaintShop Pro’s color management engine lets you
work with embedded image color profiles to improve
screen-to-print color matching.
IPTC Metadata Support
Most metadata that’s saved with images when you
shoot them – the camera model and exposure
settings, for example – isn’t editable. But IPTC fields
are designed to allow you to record information about
the photographer, the location of the scene and
searchable keywords. You can add and edit IPTC
metadata in PaintShop Pro.
File Open Pre-Processing
This feature allows you to run a script on files as they
are
opened.
It’s
a
time-saver
if
you
want
to
automatically apply the same process to all images
you open, such as the One Step Photo Fix. Or you
might use it to automatically downsample 16-bit
images to 8-bit, or anything else you have, or can
write a script for.
74

Step-by-Step Projects
Exploring the Learning Center
Whether you’re new to PaintShop Pro, or an old hand,
it’s worth taking a little time to explore the Learning
Center and see what it has to offer. As well as taking
you step-by-step through basic editing techniques,
like
cropping
and
rotating
images,
the
Learning
Center can help you with more ambitious projects like
producing a photomontage and advanced editing
techniques like digital camera noise removal.
75

STEP 1 First make sure you’re in the Edit workspace
and if not click its tab. If the Learning Center isn’t on
the home page, click the Home button. Topics are
divided into eight categories: Get Photos, Quick
Adjustments,
Retouch
and
Restore,
Layers
and
Selections, Text and Graphics, Effects, Advanced
Adjustments and Print and Share. Click on any of
these to view the list of available projects. You can
get back to the home page either by clicking the
Home button, or the Back button at the top of the
Learning Center palette, just like in a web browser.
76

STEP 2 Click the second option on the Learning
Centre Home page, Quick Adjustments, and on the
next page click the last option on the list – Resize.
The resize dialog box is automatically opened for you
and the Learning Center explains what the various
fields are for and how to use them. We don’t want to
resize this image just now so click the close box to get
of the Resize dialog and click the Home button at the
top of the Learning Center palette.
77

STEP 3 Now select retouch and restore from the
Learning Center Home page and choose Clone brush
from the Retouch and Restore menu. This time the
Learning Center selects the Clone brush from the
Tools toolbar and tells you what do with it. The
Learning Center provides step-by-step instructions for
a wide variety of tasks and selects the tools you need
or opens the appropriate dialogs to help get you
going. In the next two Step-by-step projects we’ll look
at how to straighten a photo and how to correct
perspective with the help of the Learning Center.
Straightening an Image
78

STEP 1 It’s often not until you get to look at your
photos on screen that you realize the horizon isn’t
level. Deliberate tilting of the camera to create a
dynamic angle is one thing; a horizon that runs
downhill, whether due to a tilted camera or skewed
scanning, is generally to be avoided and can easily
be fixed. Use the Organizer to open the offending
image and click the Adjust button on the home page
of the Learning Center.
79

STEP 2 Select Straighten from the Adjust page in the
Learning Center. The Straighten tool is automatically
selected for you (it’s the sixth tool from the top of the
Tools toolbar) and a line appears in the center of your
image.
80

STEP 3 The panel in the Learning Center tells you
exactly what you need to do to straighten the image.
Move the endpoints of the line until it lines up with a
horizontal or vertical line in the image – in this case
the horizon.
STEP 4 Then click the Apply button, or double-click
the photo to apply the straightening. Bear in mind that
when you straighten a photo like this the edges are
cropped and the more straightening is required the
more of the edges you’ll lose.
Perspective Correction
STEP 1 As well as straightforward editing tasks like
opening
and
straightening
images,
the
Learning
Center can help you with more advanced techniques.
81

The Perspective Correction tool can be used to
straighten ‘converging verticals’ – the tendency for tall
buildings to appear to be falling backwards when you
tilt the camera upwards. Start by opening the problem
photo and selecting the Adjust button on the Learning
Center home page.
STEP 2 Click the Advanced Adjustments page on the
Learning
Center
home
page,
followed
by
the
Perspective
Correction
button.
The
Perspective
82

Correction tool is selected and a rectangular box
appears in the center of the image window.
STEP 3 Follow the instructions in the Learning Center
to align the box with the edges of the building. If the
building shape is irregular and you find alignment
difficult, enter a number of around four to eight in the
Grid Lines box in the Tool Options palette. This
applies a grid to the perspective rectangle, making it
easier to align it with what should be vertical features
on the building.
83

STEP
4
Click
the
Apply
button
to
correct
the
perspective distortion. If you check the Crop Image
box the edges of the photo will be cropped to remove
the white space that appear; as a result.
84

Cropping Pictures
85

After a while you’ll find you can do without the
Learning Center for simple and even more advanced
editing
tasks.
Most
pictures
need
cropping
for
aesthetic reasons and there are very few pictures that
can’t be improved by removing some of the detail
around the outside to focus attention on the central
subject. You might also want to crop a picture to
change its proportions for printing, for example, so
that it will fit a 4 × 6 inch or 5 × 7 inch frame, or a
space on a web page.
Tip
Select the Crop tool, click the Presents button on
the Options palette and select one of the preset crop
sizes from the pull-down menu. You can save your
own crop settings to this list, enabling you to quickly
apply custom crop settings
to any number of
images.
STEP 1 Open a picture and choose the Crop tool
from the Tools toolbar. Adjust the crop area size or
position. The image area outside the crop rectangle is
shaded.
86

STEP 2 Click inside the crop area and drag to
reposition it. You can constrain the crop area to its
existing proportions by holding down the Shift key. If
you’re cropping for a standard sized photo frame
choose a preset from the floating toolbar.
87

STEP 3 When you’re satisfied with the area you’ve
chosen double-click in the crop area, or click the
Apply button (the green check mark) on the Tool
Options palette to crop the image. The inside section
of the marquee remains while the image contents
outside the crop are; are discarded. If it is not right,
choose ‘Edit > Undo’ or Ctrl+Z.
88

If you know the dimensions that the picture is to be
cropped to, click the ‘Specify Print Size’ checkbox and
enter the dimensions in the Width/Height and Units
fields provided. The crop area automatically appears
in the correct proportions for the desired crop. If you
have many photos to be cropped for, say, a web
gallery, this is a very productive tool. Click-drag any of
the corner ‘handles’ or edges to expand or contract
the crop dimensions while maintaining proportions.
You can also snap the Crop tool to a previously made
selection in the image, its layer opaqueness or a
layer’s merged opaqueness. Once the cropped image
is saved, the discarded area cannot be recovered. As
a general rule you should click File > Save As to save
a copy and make sure you have the originals safely
backed up!

Chapter 2
The Manage Workspace
Organizing Your Photos
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• This
chapter
explains
what
the
Manage
workspace is and how you can use it to organize
and manage your photos. As well as the image
itself, a photo file contains text metadata, some
metadata are recorded by the camera; other
details can be added in Corel PaintShop Pro X6.
• In this chapter, I’ll show you how to use the
existing metadata in your photos and how to add
captions, ratings, and keyword tags. You’ll learn
how to search for images using this information
and how to turn searches into Smart Collections.
The Manage workspace can be used to organize
and edit Camera RAW files, and I’ll show you how
that’s done. Next I’ll show you how you can use
recently introduced features in PaintShop Pro to
91

search for people you know in your photo library
and to organize photos according to their location
and
display
them
on
a
map.
Finally,
the
step-by-step projects demonstrate how to caption,
rate and tag photos, using the Organizer to apply
a series of image edits to multiple photos, how to
display photos on a map and finally creating a
Share My Trip project.
Fig 2.1
The
default
view
of
the
Manage
workspace
is
Thumbnail mode, which arranges the Navigation
palette, Info palette and Preview palette around a
central thumbnail area.
PaintShop Pro X6’s Manage workspace is where you
keep track of all your photos, organize them into
collections, rate them and apply caption, keyword and
other metadata. You can open images from the
Manage
workspace
into
the
Adjust
or
Edit
workspaces and you can view and prepare Camera
Raw images.
92

When you first open the Manage workspace what you
see will most likely look like Figure 2.1. In Thumbnail
mode the Manage Workspace is arranged over four
areas; the Organizer palette in the middle is flanked
on the left by the Navigation palette and, below it, the
Preview palette. On the right you’ll find the Info palette
arranged in five tabs for General information, EXIF
data, IPTC data, People and Places.
Below the Organizer, at the bottom of the screen, the
Organizer toolbar has controls for, among other
things, grouping similar thumbnails, sharing photos,
sorting thumbnails, rotating them, changing their size
and printing a contact sheet. If you’ve upgraded from
PaintShop Photo Pro X3 and are looking for the
Search field, it’s moved from the Organizer palette to
the top of the Navigation palette. Its function is the
same, though, you can use it to search image
metadata, for example, to locate an image from its
caption or keyword tags.
To get a better look at an individual image switch to
Preview mode by clicking the Preview icon, the
middle one in the row of buttons on the top right
corner of the Organizer palette. Do that, and the
Preview window is resized to fill the main area in the
middle of the screen with the Organizer palette
appearing as a strip along the bottom.
93

Fig 2.2
Use Preview mode to get a better view of individual
photos.
The Manage workspace is customizable and you can
change the layout to better suit the way you like to
work. It’s currently in Preview mode, which is good if
you want to get a look at each of your photos; for
more of an overview switch back to Thumbnail mode
by clicking the Thumbnail mode button at the top right
next to the Preview mode button. You can switch
back to Preview mode at any time by pressing the
Preview mode button.
You can further customize the workspace in both
Preview and Thumbnail view by changing the size of
the panels and windows by dragging the boundaries
between them. Hover over the line dividing two panels
until the cursor changes to a double-bar with a
double-headed arrow and drag to expand one panel
and contract the other.
94

Fig 2.3 The Computer tab on the Navigation palette
shows the contents of the hard drives and folders on
your PC. It shows you everything, and if you’re used
to navigating folders in windows you’ll quickly find
what you’re looking for, but all that other stuff mostly
just gets in the way.
The Navigation Palette
Take a closer look at the Navigation palette and you’ll
see that it has two tabs. Collections – the Collections
tab – shows the structure of folders on your computer,
but this isn’t always the best, or easiest way to
organize your photos. The Collections tab allows you
to arrange your images in a way that isn’t tied to the
95

way you keep them on your hard drive – it’s not
bound by the folder and filename conventions used
by windows.
Using the Computer Tab
If it isn’t already selected, click the Computer tab at
the top of the Navigation palette to display a Windows
Explorer-style list of all of the disk drives and
folders on your PC. Click the triangle symbol next to a
drive or folder to expand the list and reveal its
contents. The thumbnail panel remains empty until
you click on a folder that contains images or video.
You
can
organize
your
images
using
only
the
Computer tab of the Navigation palette, locating
folders of pictures on your computer and carrying out
all of the Manage functions, such as captioning and
rating, described later, but then you’d be missing out
one of the Manage workspace’s best features. The
problem with the Computer tab is that it shows you all
of the disks and folders on your PC, whether they
contain photos or not. Most people keep all of their
photos in one place and all that other stuff– folders
containing
applications,
text
documents,
spreadsheets, stuff downloaded from websites, your
personal finances – all just gets in the way. The
Collections tab lets you concentrate only on the
folders containing your photos and videos.
The other really useful thing the Collections tab can
do is group together photos on the basis of their
content, rather than where they happen to be on your
hard drive.
96

Fig 2.4 The Collections tab provides a much less
cluttered way to view and organize your photos
because it shows only those folders you choose, in
other words only those containing photos and video.
Using the Collections Tab
Click the Collections tab at the top of the Navigation
palette and you’ll see a list that contains several
items, each of which can be expanded by clicking the
triangle to the left of it. For now, click the triangle icon
to expand the folders list. What you see here will
97

depend to an extent on your version of Windows.
Windows 7 users will see four folders My Pictures, My
Videos, Public Pictures and Public Videos.
There’s one other item in the list which looks like a
folder, but isn’t. Click the Browse More folders button
and a dialog box opens which you can use to search
for folders on your hard disk and add them to the
Folders
list.
If
you
select
a
folder
containing
sub-folders, all the sub-folders are added too. So, if
you keep all of your photos in a folder on your hard
drive called ‘Pictures’ which contains sub-folders like
‘Summer holiday 2013’ and ‘Joe and Anna’s wedding’
just select the Pictures folder and everything else will
be added automatically neatly arranged in sub-folders
just like on your hard drive.
I’ll come back to the Collections tab of the Navigation
palette after we’ve taken a look at some other aspects
of the Manage workspace including how to add
captions,
keywords
and
other
metadata
to
your
photos.
98

Fig 2.5 The Info palette panel is on the right of the
Organizer in the Manage workspace.
Using the Info Palette
The Info palette displays metadata – information
about your photos – which you can edit and add to.
Adding
metadata
like
caption
information
and
keywords tells you and others more about your
images than the picture data alone can and it also
helps when it comes to finding particular photos,
computers being much more adept at recognizing
words than pictures.
As we saw in the last chapter, the Info Palette has five
tabs – General, EXIF, IPTC, People and Places. First,
let’s take a look at what you can do on the General
tab.
Tip
99

The best way to apply ratings is to use Quick
Review. Double-click the first thumbnail in a tray to
launch Quick Review, click to set rating, click the
next button and continue. You can speed the
process even more using keyboard shortcuts –
Press Ctrl plus the number of stars you want to
assign.
Adding a Rating
Near the top of the Info palette, below the file name
and date, you’ll see a Rating section with five stars. If
you haven’t rated any of your images the stars will
appear greyed. Hover over them with your mouse and
they turn gold, click on one of the stars to apply that
rating to the selected image. That’s all there is to it. If
you change your mind, just click on the same star to
remove the rating or one of the others to change it.
As you’ll discover in the section about searching and
Smart Collections, rating your images is one of the
best ways to sort them, allowing you to quickly locate
your best shots. It’s quick and easy to do and the
rewards are more than worth the effort.
Adding Keyword Tags
Underneath the Ratings section is the Tags section
which is where you assign keywords to your images.
To add a new tag to an image, type the tag in the top
field, then click the Add Tag button to the right and it
will appear in the tag list below. To add further tags
just keep typing them in and adding them to the list.
100

Fig 2.6 To add a tag to a photo, select the thumbnail,
type the keyword into the tag field then press return or
click the add tag button to the right.
101

Fig 2.7 Every image tag is added to the Tag list in
the Collections tab of the Navigation palette. Click the
triangle icon next to Tags to expand it and see them
all.
102

Is there an easier way to add keywords than typing
them individually for each and every image? Yes
there is. Each time you add a keyword to a photo it is
added to the tag list in the Collections tab of the
Navigation
palette.
Once
you’ve
added
a
few
keywords, click the triangle next to tags in the
Collections tab of the Navigation palette to expand
the keyword list – you’ll see all of the keywords you
just added in addition to every keyword tag you’ve
ever previously added to a photo.
To add these tags to other images first select the
images in the Thumbnail panel then drag and drop
them onto the keyword you want to apply.
The way to get all your keywording done quickly,
without it turning into a tedious chore, is to start with
the most generic keywords and work down to more
specific ones. For example, let’s say you’ve spent a
day at the beach with your family. You’ll want to add
the tag ‘beach’, to most, if not all of those shots, so
select the first thumbnail, then press Control-A to
select them all and drag them onto the word beach in
the tags list.
A lot of your photos are of the sandcastle competition
so Control-click to select those thumbnails and drag
them
onto
the
Sandcastle
tag,
then
onto
the
competition tag. Remember, to get these words into
the Tag list you’ll first need to apply them to a single
image by adding them in the Tags section of the
General Info panel.
Keep on going in this fashion, selecting and tagging
batches of images with common keywords – family
members and so on. Eventually, you’ll be dealing with
103

small groups and single images which you can
keyword tag from the Info palette.
Once all your photos are tagged, finding photos that
contain a particular tag is easy, just select the tag
from the list in the Navigation palette and all of the
photos tagged with that word are displayed in the
Thumbnails panel.
Adding a Caption
Like keyword tagging, captions can be applied to
batches of photos. Shift or Control-click to select the
photos you want to caption, then type the text into the
Caption field in the General Info panel. If you can’t be
bothered to individually caption your images, give
them all a more general caption – ‘Beach trip,
Cornwall, UK, August 2013’ for example. You can
always go back and edit them later if you have time.
The EXIF Tab
The Info palette’s EXIF tab is divided into two
sections. The top section displays the file properties
and below it is the camera data recorded at the time
the shot was taken. There’s quite a lot of information
on this tab and if you’re in Preview mode you won’t be
able to see all of it because the Organize palette
extends across the width of the screen. You could
close the Organizer palette by clicking its close button
(or pressing Shift F9), but there’s a better way to
manage your screen space.
104

Fig 2.8 The EXIF section of the Info palette is divided
into two sub-sections: File properties and Camera
data. The EXIF section shown here displays camera
105

make
and
model,
exposure
details
and
other
metadata recorded by the camera at exposure time.
If you’re not already in Preview mode, then click the
preview button at the top right of the screen. Now go
to the title bar of the Organizer palette on the left and
click the pushpin just below the close icon. When you
do this the Organizer palette will disappear, but only
temporarily. Look closely and you’ll see the Organizer
palette title tab is still there and, if you roll over it, it
will reappear. You can auto-hide or ‘rollup’ other
palettes in the same way by either clicking the
pushpin icon (click it again to turn off the feature) or
clicking the button below the pushpin and selecting
Auto Hide from the palette menu.
Now you have a better view of the Info palette, but
you’ll probably still need to scroll to see all of the
camera data.
EXIF data can tell you a lot of things including the
date and time the image was taken, the camera
model, exposure settings, the lens focal length, the
exposure mode and whether a flash was used.
Generally, EXIF data isn’t editable – there’s no reason
you’d want to change it.
IPTC
Unlike EXIF, the IPTC section of the advanced Info
panel contains information that is added after the
event by the photographer or others. IPTC stands for
International
Press
Telecommunications
Council,
which is the body that defined
106

the standard. The IPTC standard for this kind of
information was developed so that newspaper picture
desks, stock photo libraries and other organizations
dealing with lots of photos from lots of different
sources would find it easier to manage them. But that
doesn’t mean IPTC data isn’t useful to everyone else.
If you’ve added captions to your photos you’ll notice
that they appear in the Description IPTC field, where
you can edit them. Your changes will be updated in
the Caption field of the General Info panel – it’s the
same information, it just appears in two different
places with a different label.
Other IPTC fields that are useful include Author and
Credit, which you can use to state your ownership as
the photographer and to add a copyright notice –
useful if you apply to competitions or send your
images for potential use in publications.
Earlier we looked at how to add folders of photos to
the Collections tab of the Navigation palette. Then we
saw how you can add keywords and other metadata
to the existing metadata recorded by your camera and
stored with each individual image file. Now we’ll see
how all this organization pays off by making it easy to
quickly locate your photos and organize them into
meaningful collections.
107

Fig 2.9 Use the IPTC sub-section of Advanced info to
add and edit caption (description), title and author
credits.
Searching and Smart Collections
108

Click the triangle icon next to the Smart Collections
item
at
the
top
of
the
Collections
tab
on
the
Navigation palette to reveal the list of existing Smart
Collections. Click the Smart Selection called ‘Last 12
Months’ and provided you’ve catalogued a folder of
recent images (see Using the Collections Tab section
earlier), the Thumbnails panel will display all of the
shots taken during the last 12 months.
Using Search and Advanced Searching
We’ll come back to Smart collections in a minute.
There’s another way to search for photos using the
metadata they contain. As I mentioned earlier in this
chapter the Navigation palette has a Quick search
field. Type anything in here and the Organizer will
show you thumbnails of all the images that contain
what you type in any of the metadata fields or the
filenames of your images. Before using search, select
All Photos from the Collections tab to search all of
your catalogued images. Alternatively you can search
within a folder – either in the Collections tab or in the
Computer tab.
109

Fig 2.10 Smart collections are saved searches. The
Organizer has a few preset ones including ‘last 12
months’ which displays all the photos you’ve taken in,
that’s right, the last year.
For more advanced search options, select ‘Add Smart
Collection’ – the first item under Smart Collections on
the Collections tab – to open the Smart collection
dialog. Use the left pull-down menu to select the
search criteria; you can search by image name,
caption, date, size, file type, keyword tag, edited date
or rating. The next pull-down menu
defines how the search engine matches the search
term. Normally you’ll set this to ‘contains’ but ‘starts
with’ and ‘ends with’ can be useful, or you might want
to search for images that don’t contain a particular
search term. Next, type your search term into the field
on the right.
110

Fig 2.11 Using the Smart Collection dialog you can
search for images that match all or any of multiple
search criteria.
If you want to search for more than one term, click the
plus icon to add another line. For example, you might
want to search for images that contain the keyword
‘beach’, that were taken after 1 January 2013. In this
case the first line of your advanced search would read
‘Tag contains beach’ and the second line would read
‘Image date is after 01/01/2013’.
There’s one final thing you need to consider before
applying the search criteria. The pull-down menu at
the top of the Smart Collection dialog has two
settings. The default position is ‘Find photos that
match All of the following rules’. This means that if
you select multiple criteria, like our beach example,
only photos that comply with all of them will be
displayed, i.e. they must contain the tag ‘beach’ and
be taken after 01.01.13. Changing this to ‘Find photos
that match Any of the following rules’ means that only
one of your criteria need be matched for images to be
displayed. With ‘Any’ selected, all photos tagged with
the keyword beach will be displayed, regardless of
when they were taken. Likewise, all photos taken after
111

01.01.13 will be displayed, even if they aren’t tagged
with the beach keyword.
Fig 2.12 Searching multiple criteria using find any
results in a wider range of images that match any of
the search criteria.
Saving Searches as Smart Collections
When you’ve entered your search criteria and rules
click the preview button to see all of the images that
match. Click the Save button and enter a name to
save your advanced search to the Smart Collections
list in the Collections tab of the Navigation palette.
Now you can access the same search simply by
clicking its name in the Smart Collections list. You can
also duplicate and edit existing Smart Collections.
Earlier
versions
of
PaintShop
pro
came
with
a
ready-made Smart Collection called ‘highest rated’
which displayed all images with a five-star rating. For
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
Corel
have
dropped it from PaintShop Pro X6, but it’s easy
enough to do yourself (maybe that’s the reason).
First, click Add Smart Collection then choose Ratings
from the left pull-down menu in the Smart Collection
112

dialog. Leave the middle menu set to ‘is’ and click the
fifth star to set the rating to 5. Click the save button
and call the Smart Collection ‘Highest Rated’ or ‘5
Star photos’ and click save. That’s it!
I find these ratings-based Smart Collections really
useful. Here’s how to make another one, using a
duplicated of the 5-star Smart Collection, that shows
all your 3-star and higher rated shots.
First right-click the ‘Highest Rated’ (or whatever you
decided to call it) Smart Collection in the Collections
tab, select Duplicate from the contextual menu and
enter ‘3 star and up’ in the Save as a Smart Collection
dialog. Click OK to add the new Smart Collection to
the list.
Fig
2.13 You
can
duplicate
and
edit
Smart
Collections to create new ones. In this case the
Highest Rated Smart collection has been edited to
produce a more useful ‘Rated 3 stars and above’ one.
Now right-click your new ‘Rated 3 star and above’
Smart Collection and select Edit from the contextual
menu. The Smart Collection dialog shows ‘Rating is 5
stars’ – the setup for the Highest Rated Smart
Collection which we duplicated. Change it to Rating is
greater than 3 stars and click the save button – you’ll
113

be prompted with another dialog containing the name
of the Smart Collection, as you’ve already renamed it
just click save. Now when you select the Rated 3 star
and above Smart Selection you’ll see all images that
have a 3 star or higher rating.
Smart Selections are live – whenever you catalogue
new
folders
of
images
by
adding
them
to
the
Collections
tab
your
Smart
Collections
will
automatically update to include them. So from now on
any new images that you assign a 3 star or higher
rating to will appear when you choose the Rated 3
star and above Smart Selection.
Searching for People
If you’re looking for people in your photos PaintShop
Pro has some specialist tools for the job that can help
you organize and find people photos more easily.
Essentially, tagging photos with the names of people
is the same as tagging an image with any other word,
except that PaintShop Pro can recognize faces so,
once you’ve introduced it to everyone you know, it
can automatically tag people and add them to a
collection.
114

Fig 2.14 To start searching for people in a folder of
photos, navigate to it then choose Scan current folder
from the Find People button on the Organizer toolbar.
To run face recognition first switch to the Manage
workspace and select a folder of images, then click
the Find people button on the Organizer toolbar; it’s
the one that looks like a silhouette of a head. From
the pop-up menu choose Scan current folder. If you
like you can run Face recognition on a selection of
pictures or on sub-folders within a parent folder, but
beware of selecting more than, say, a few hundred
photos at a time as the face recognition algorithm can
take a while.
Once Find people has done its stuff the Organizer will
display thumbnails of all the faces PaintShop Pro has
recognized in the images in your selected folder. Of
course it doesn’t know who they are yet, but it has
cleverly
115

organized them into ones that it thinks look the same.
(Actually, it’s not as clever as all that and you’ll
probably find that it’s identified numerous things,
clocks, parking meters, flowers, you name it, that
aren’t faces at all.) It’s easy to get rid of these, along
with any photos that are of faces, but not the same
one as the others in the group. When all you’re left
with is photos of a single individual type their name in
the space above where it says ‘Type a name for this
group’.
Fig 2.15 Find People scans all the images in a folder
and groups faces it thinks are all the same person. It’s
done pretty well with me, but you occasionally find a
mix of people and sometimes even objects grouped
together. It’s fairly easy to put right though.
Tip
116

To increase the accuracy of face recognition, find
ten clear photos (head and shoulders portraits work
best) of anyone you regularly take photos of and run
face recognition on those, before letting it loose on
other photos in your library.
Repeat the process, deleting unwanted images and
naming each group until they’re all done. If there are
too many to do in one go don’t worry. Take a look at
the Collections tab in the Navigation palette and you’ll
notice that a new entry has been added under the
people heading for each of the people you identified.
There’s also an Unnamed group which is the one
you’ve been working on in the Organizer palette. If
you’ve had enough of identifying people for now just
scroll back up to the top of the Navigation palette and
select your original folder, you can come back to the
Unnamed
collection
anytime
and
carry
on
with
identifying groups of faces.
But let’s stick with it for now. It may be that a group
contains a bunch of faces that all belong to the same
person but there’s one that doesn’t fit, it could be a
relative or someone else, but it doesn’t belong. You
click the close button on the top right of the thumbnail
to delete it from the group, but what if it’s someone
you want to identify? With any luck that person will
appear in another group of their own but, even if they
don’t, you can still identify them. Once you’ve closed
the thumbnail, click the Ignored button (with the trash
can icon) at the top right of the Organizer palette.
117

Fig 2.16 Right-click on any thumbnail in one of the
people groups to move it to another one or ignore it.
The window that pops up contains all the faces that
you’ve yet to identify. To identify one of them select it,
then click the New Person button at the bottom of the
window (even if it isn’t a new person, but one you’ve
identified before). In the pop-up window you can enter
a name for the new person, or if it’s someone you’ve
previously identified just select them from the list. If
you’ve done this before and have a long list of
existing people, just type the first few letters of their
name and PaintShop Pro will filter the list, showing
only those that match what you’ve typed. Click OK to
return to the Ignored window where you can identify
other people or delete the clocks and parking meters.
118

Fig 2.17 The people you’ve identified appear in the
Collections tab of the Navigation palette, click on their
name to display all photos they appear in.
To review all of the photos of a particular person,
select the collection labelled with their name in the
Navigation palette. If you subsequently discover a
picture of someone who shouldn’t be there, it’s easy
to delete or move photos between people collections.
Just right-click the thumbnail and select one of the
‘Move Person’ options from the contextual menu.
Working with Places
As I briefly mentioned in Chapter 1, PaintShop Pro X6
has a range of tools for adding location data to your
photos and using it to display them on a map. This
geopositional data can also be used to search for
photos, for example, to find all the pictures you took
on your Italian holiday, or all the photos you’ve taken
of the Tower of London.
The easiest way to work with location data is if your
camera has a built-in GPS receiver, it automatically
119

adds it to your photos. That way, when you bring
them into PaintShop pro the data is already there for
the program to work with. These days, more and
more cameras coming onto the market are GPS
equipped. Many recent models also have built-in
Wi-Fi, so that even if they don’t have GPS you can
use a smartphone app to keep track of your position
(using your phone’s GPS) and add the data to your
photos at the push of a button. So if you’re planning
on upgrading your camera look out for one that has
built-in GPS and/or Wi-Fi.
Even if your images lack positional co-ordinates you
can add them pretty easily in PaintShop Pro. And
once they’re added you can display the location of
your photos on a Google map, to easily find all the
photos you’ve taken in a particular spot, and to create
a map-based interactive slideshow of your photos.
See the Step-by-Step project at the end of this
chapter for practical help with how to do that.
Working with Camera Raw Images
PaintShop Pro X6 supports Camera Raw Image file
formats for a wide range of camera manufacturers
and models. As new models are released Corel
Updates the application to provide support for them,
so even if your camera is a recent model, the chances
are
it
will
be
supported.
To
check,
go
to
corel.force.com and select your version of PaintShop
Pro using the pull-down menus. Then type RAW into
the
search
box
and
choose
‘Supported
RAW
Formatted Cameras In PaintShop Pro X6’ from the
results or choose the appropriate result if you’re using
an earlier version of the program.
120

What are Camera RAW files and why should you use
them? Camera RAW is a proprietary format that’s
available on most DSLRs, mirrorless compact system
cameras and some advanced compacts. If you’re not
using RAW, your camera processes the information
collected by the sensor and saves it as an RGB
image file with JPEG compression (see Chapter 10 –
Working with the Web – for more detail about how
JPEG compression works). As well as compressing
the file, in the process of converting the RAW file to a
JPEG a lot of the original image data is discarded. By
shooting and recording the RAW data, then doing the
conversion yourself in PaintShop Pro X6, you can
make your own decisions about how best to perform
the conversion and get a better quality image than if
you’d left it to your camera.
One
of
the
main
advantages
of
shooting
and
processing RAW files is that you can import them into
PaintShop Pro X6 for editing as 16-bit RGB files –
retaining all of the bit data for each pixel that the
camera was capable of recording. When you shoot
JPEG
images
the
files
are
automatically
down
sampled to 8 bits per pixel, giving you much less
scope when it comes to making tonal and color
corrections and other edits.
The downside to this is that, with more bits per pixel
and no JPEG compression applied, RAW files are
much larger than JPEGs and eat up your memory
card and hard disk space more quickly. With the
falling cost of storage, this isn’t the big issue it used to
be though. And, when you’ve finished editing, you can
always down sample files to 8 bits per pixel (select
Image>Decrease Color Depth>RGB – 8 bits/channel),
121

just remember to keep a backup of your original RAW
files.
Fig 2.18 Select RAW thumbnails in the Organizer
and hit the Edit tab (or right-click and select Edit
photo) to open them into Camera RAW Lab. Several
files can be opened into the lab for editing at the
same time.
The Organizer displays thumbnails for supported
RAW files. Camera RAW files are Processed by
PaintShop Pro X6 in the Camera RAW Lab, to open a
file into the RAW lab, select it and click the Edit tab.
To process more than one image at a time, shift- or
control-click to select several thumbnails, right-click
and select Edit photo from the contextual menu.
122

The Camera RAW Lab window displays a preview
image at the top, to get a better look maximize the
window. It’s important to understand that what you’re
looking at is an RGB interpretation of the RAW data.
By adjusting the controls in Camera RAW Lab you
can interpret the data differently to produce different
results, finally outputting an RGB file for editing in the
Full Editor or saving the settings to a ‘sidecar’ file
that’s associated with the original RAW file.
Two things about this approach are radically different
to the way you might be used to working with image
files. First, you can’t make changes to and save RAW
files, because RAW files are in effect locked. Because
the data in a RAW file isn’t in RGB format, it can’t be
edited in the conventional way. Instead, any changes
you apply in the Camera RAW Lab are saved in the
database and applied when you next open the RAW
file in the Camera RAW Lab.
The
second
thing
is
that
these
changes
in
interpretation aren’t destructive in the same way that
editing an RGB file can be. You’re not manipulating
pixels, but re-interpreting the information in the RAW
file to produce a different outcome. When you’re
happy with that interpretation you can output the file
in RGB format for further editing in PaintShop Pro X6
or simply export it in any RGB format such as TIFF,
JPEG or PSPIMAGE.
So let’s take a look at the controls in the Camera
RAW Lab. Below the histogram on the right you’ll find
four panels with controls for adjusting tonality and
saturation, white balance, highlight recovery and
noise reduction.
123

The brightness slider is used to rescue under- or
over-exposed photos. It should be obvious from the
preview if your photo is under- or over-exposed but
the histogram can help you make a diagnosis as well
as tell you how much correction is needed. Drag the
brightness slider to the right to fix under-exposed
shots and to the left to correct over-exposure.
Remember what I said earlier about Camera RAW
Lab interpreting the data in you RAW files and how
that’s
not
the
same
thing
as
applying
similar
adjustments in the Edit workspace? Not only will
these changes in Camera RAW Lab produce better
results, you have a lot more scope for correction. The
brightness slider extends to plus or minus 3, which
means you can effectively correct up to three stops of
under- or over-exposure – more than you could hope
to achieve working on an 8-bit JPEG file in the Edit
workspace.
The saturation slider works in much the same way as
for RGB files; it’s good for making small changes to
saturation, but you don’t want to go too far with it. The
shadow slider can be used to add contrast to slightly
over-exposed or flat shots that are lacking solid
blacks.
Next are the white balance controls. Ordinarily white
balance is applied in the camera – all you need to do
is set the white balance to automatic or one of the
available presets. But, as we’ve seen, none of this
in-camera processing occurs when you shoot RAW
and the white balance can be applied later. This is
hugely advantageous as it allows you to easily
remove color casts caused by incorrect setting of the
124

white balance or the camera’s auto white balance
getting it wrong – it happens.
There are three white balance controls. A drop-down
menu provides presets, one of which is the camera’s
‘As
shot’
white
balance
setting.
Others
include
common lighting setups like Daylight, Tungsten, flash
and fluorescent lighting. More control is provided via
two sliders below. The main one sets the color
temperature – you can enter it numerically in the
adjoining field. Dragging it to the left, or entering a
lower value makes the image cooler or more blue; in
the opposite direction the image becomes warmer or
more yellow.
If you know anything about color temperature this
may seem a little counter intuitive. On the Kelvin scale
used to represent color temperature the higher the
color temperature the bluer the light, so how come
setting a higher color temperature makes the image
warmer? The answer is that the setting represents the
color temperature of the prevailing lighting conditions
when the photo was taken. By dragging the slider to a
higher color temperature you’re telling Camera RAW
Lab the light used to create the image was cooler
(more blue) than the currently specified setting, and
therefore the result is a warmer (more yellow) image.
125

Fig 2.19 These two images show the same RAW file
saved to RGB using different White balance settings
in Camera RAW Lab. The one on top was saved with
the ‘as shot’ white balance of 7770, the one below
with the white balance adjusted to 12,500.
The tint slider below the temperature sliders is used to
eliminate green/magenta casts. Drag it to the right to
add green (remove magenta) and to the left to add
magenta (remove green).
The
next
panel
down
provides
noise
reduction
controls. This has been simplified from the two slider
setup in PaintShop Photo Pro X3. Now there’s just
one slider labelled threshold which goes from 0 to
100. The higher the setting the more noise filtering is
applied, but beware. Beyond a certain point you’ll
start to lose fine detail in your image. Used sensibly
though, these controls in the Camera RAW Lab,
however, can give you a head start removing some of
the digital noise from high ISO shots.
126

When you’re happy with your adjustments you can
either click apply to save them to the database (they’ll
be there the next time you open the RAW file in
Camera RAW Lab) or click Edit to open the image as
an RGB file in the Edit workspace.
127

Step-by-Step Projects
Managing Metadata
Captioning, Rating and Tagging Photos
Whenever you download a card of photos to your PC,
it’s always a good idea to rate them and add keyword
tags and a caption. Don’t put this off! If you do, you’ll
probably never get around to it and you’ll be missing
out on one of PaintShop Pro X6’s most useful
features. Tagging and captioning your photos will
make them much easier to find in future.
STEP
1
If
you’re
not
already
in
the
Manage
workspace click the Manage tab at the top of the
screen and use the Navigation palette to locate the
folder containing your photos. If you’re in Preview
mode click the Thumbnail mode button at the top
right. Double-click the first thumbnail to enter Quick
Review mode.>
128

STEP 2 This is the Quick Review workspace, if you
can’t see the tool panel at the bottom move your
mouse around and it will appear (it disappears after a
few seconds of activity to give you a clear view of the
photo). Apply a star rating to the photo by clicking one
of the star buttons in the center of the tool panel, then
advance to the next photo either by clicking the next
button under the star rating or by pressing the right
arrow on your keyboard. I find it easiest to have one
hand on the keyboard navigating back and forth
through the photos and the other on the mouse (or
trackpad) to apply ratings.
129

STEP 3 Keep on going until you’ve rated every single
photo. Use the rotate buttons on the left to rotate
photos and delete them. There are buttons on the
right to zoom in to 100% view and back out to fit in
window, but if you want a closer look, for example to
check the focus, just click once to zoom in. While
130

zoomed in you can move around by clicking and
dragging, then zoom out again with a single click.
STEP 4 Every time you hit the delete button a
warning appears asking you if you really want to
delete
the photo,
which can get a bit tedious,
particularly if you want to delete a lot of shots. In
PaintShop Pro X6 you can turn it off (which makes
deleting photos a lot easier, but clearly carries its own
dangers. Once you’ve done this you don’t get any
second chance, though you can fish accidentally
deleted
images
out
of
the
Recycle
bin
in
an
emergency) simply by checking the box labelled ‘don’t
show this message again’. In older versions of the
program there’s no checkbox, but you can still get rid
of
the
warning.
From
the
file
menu
select
Preferences>General
Program
Preferences
and
select Warnings from the list on the left. Now uncheck
the box that says WARNING – Confirm before
deleting a file.
131

STEP 5 When you’ve rated the last image hit escape
or click the close icon top right to exit Quick Review.
Now it’s time to caption every shot. You could go
through captioning every shot individually, but that
would take time and, in any case, many of your shots
will probably share the same caption, or at least part
of it. This folder of photos was mostly shot in and
around the village of Maurellas Las Illas in southern
France, so that’s what we’ll add as a caption. Back in
the Manage workspace click on any thumbnail then
press Ctrl-A to select all. In the Caption field of the
General tab on the Info palette, type your caption, in
this case ‘Maurellas las Illas, France.’ and hit return. It
132

may take a short while to caption an entire folder of
photos.
STEP 6 Some of these shots were taken in the
nearby town of Ceret, so I’m going to recaption them.
Click the first thumbnail and Ctrl-click subsequent
ones to add them to the selection. Then simply
overwrite the caption field with the new caption, in this
case ‘Ceret, France.’. Likewise make group selections
of other images you want to recaption. It’s often a
case of just adding to the caption to make it more
specific, e.g. ‘Shop, Maurellas las Illas, France.’ or
‘Street market, Ceret, France.’. Eventually, you’ll get
to amending captions for individual images – ‘Harry
buying
sunflowers
in
the
street
market,
Ceret,
133

France.’. Even if you don’t have patience for these
individual captions, you’ll have no problem locating
the photos (or all your photos of street markets, or
Harry) by typing the relevant search term into the
search field at the top of the Navigation palette.
STEP 7 The final step in the process is to add some
tags to your folder of images. As with captioning there
are some tags that you’ll want to add to lots
of photos. There are two ways you can do this. The
first is by multiple selecting thumbnails, as we did for
the captioning, and typing the keyword into the tags
field in the General tab of the Info palette (above the
caption field). Here, I’ve selected three thumbnails
and added the word ‘candles’. Click the plus sign (or
press Enter) at the right of the tag field to add the tag,
then enter any other tags you want and add them in
the same way. Here I’ve added Church, Abbey,
interior and Low-light.
134

STEP 8 I’ve got several other photos of churches I
took on this trip, some in the same location, but they
don’t have candles and they’re not all low-light interior
shots. I could just select these and add the Church or
Abbey keyword in the same way, but there’s an easier
way that ensures I use the exact same keyword as
before
and
don’t
mis-type
it
or
change
the
capitalization. Click the triangle button next to Tags in
the Navigation palette to expand the list of tags. Here
you’ll see all the keywords you’ve ever added to
photos including the ones we added in the previous
step. To add the Church keyword to several new
thumbnails Ctrl-click to select them then drag them
onto the Church keyword in the Tag list in the
Navigation palette.
135

STEP 9 Continue to add keyword tags to images as
described in the previous two steps. If you want to
see all the shots tagged with a particular keyword just
select it from the Tag list. And to check for any photos
that haven’t been tagged click No tags at the top of
the Tag list. With your images rated captioned and
keyword tagged you now have several ways in which
you can organize, select and search for them.
Using the Organizer to Apply a Series of Image Edits
to Multiple Photos
One of PaintShop Photo Pro’s really useful features is
the ability to capture a whole editing session from one
image and apply it to many others. This feature is
particularly
useful
for
applying
images
edits
to
Camera RAW edits, but can be applied to any image
that you’ve already edited in PaintShop Pro.
136

When dealing with RGB files, you can only capture
and apply an edit list from photos that have been
edited during your current session (the changes don’t
need to have been saved though). PaintShop Pro X6
keeps lists of all the edits you make to images (it uses
these list for the undo command), but once you exit
the program, the lists are deleted.
If you recall, when you make changes to a camera
RAW file they’re not saved to the RAW file itself, but
as a list of edits in the database. This means that
those lists are always available to PaintShop Pro (it
applies them each time you open the program and
view thumbnails for RAW files in the Organizer) and
that means the current session limitation doesn’t
apply to RAW files; you can capture the settings you
applied to them in Camera RAW Lab at any time and
apply them to as many other RAW files as you like.
STEP 1 Select a RAW thumbnail in the organizer in
the Manage workspace that you’ve previously edited
in Camera RAW Lab and click the Capture Editing
button on the Organizer toolbar.
137

STEP
2
Now
select
all
the
other
RAW
image
thumbnails that you want to apply the same settings
to and click the Apply editing button. If you have
selected more than a handful of images, it may take a
short while for them all to be processed. You’ll be
warned that this can’t be undone, and for RGB files
this is the case, so make sure you have backups! For
RAW files though, all you’re doing is changing the
Settings that determine how the RAW data in the
original file is interpreted. And you could always open
up one of the changed files, reset everything back the
way it was, then capture that file’s editing and
re-apply it to the others to get back to where you
started.
138

STEP 3 That’s it! It really is that simple. I probably
don’t need to reiterate that all you’ve done is changed
the Raw settings that are applied when you create an
RGB file. To do that you’ll need to right-click and
select Convert RAW from the menu.
139

Displaying Photos on a Map
PaintShop Pro X6 has several features that make use
of location data in photos. It can show you all the
photos that were taken in a particular spot and can
display a map showing the precise location of all the
shots you took on your travels.
140

To make use of these features your photos must
obviously be tagged with location data – the latitude
and longitude positional co-ordinates that indicate the
spot where they were taken. If you’re lucky enough to
have a camera with a built-in GPS or one that can link
to your smartphone and get the GPS data from it,
then there’s nothing else you need to do. That
information will be imported along with the other EXIF
data in your images.
But even if you don’t have a GPS-equipped camera
you can still use PaintShop Pro’s Places and Map
features,
you
just
need
to
add
the
information
manually. That’s easier than it sounds and this
step-by-step project explains exactly how to do it.
STEP
1
Select
thumbnail
view
in
the
Manage
workspace and navigate to the folder containing your
images in the Navigation palette. Click an image
thumbnail to select it and shift- or Ctrl-click to select
any others that were taken in the same place. The
information you’re going to add will pinpoint their
141

precise location, you can edit it later but you’ll find it
easier if you select a batch of images that were all
taken within, say, a few hundred yards of each other.
If all the photos were taken in the same place you
don’t need to select any, the location data will be
applied to all of them. When you’re ready, click the
Map mode button at the top of the Organizer palette.
STEP 2 In the Search box at the top right of the Map
window, type the name of the location where your
photos were taken. Try and be as precise as possible,
the search drop-down menu will list locations that
match what you have typed it, when the correct match
appears select it. The map zooms in to your selected
location and a dialog box appears asking you to
confirm that you want to add the selected photos,
click OK. If you’ve selected more than a handful of
images it may take a little while for the data to be
written.
142

STEP 3 A marker for each of your selected images is
now added to the map (each thumbnail also gets a
marker badge to show it has been geotagged). At the
moment, you can only see one map marker, because
they’re all on top of each other. Click on one image in
the Organizer palette to select it then drag the marker
to position it more precisely. In my example, here, all
of
these
shots
were
taken
in
Djemaa
El
Fna,
Marrakech, Morocco, but I spent a couple of hours
wandering around taking photos in different places.
When you reposition a marker, click OK in the dialog
box to confirm you want to move it.
143

STEP 4 If you can’t pinpoint the location of a photo
from the map, click the Satellite view button at the top
right, you may be able to get a better idea from the
satellite image. PaintShop Pro uses Google maps, so
in areas that support it you can use Streetview to
accurately locate the exact spot you took a photo
from. Streetview isn’t available in Marrakesh, but I
managed to find the spot on a remote rural street in
Southern France where I took this shot of a notice
fixed to a tree by identifying the blue garage door in
the background.
144

STEP 5 When you’ve tagged all of your photos, select
the original folder in the Navigation palette, then
select all (Ctrl-A) and you’ll see a marker for each
photo on the map. Click the marker and the Organizer
palette displays thumbnails of the photos that were
taken there. The Places section in the Navigation
palette also provides a hierarchical list of the photo
locations. By selecting these I can quickly display
photos for any of the places I visited in Marrakesh or
all of Marrakesh or all of Morocco.
145

STEP 6 Return to thumbnail view and select one of
the places you’ve recently tagged – I’ve chosen
Marrakesh. All of my Marrakesh images are displayed
automatically sorted by place (you can change the
sort order from the sort by pop-up menu on the
Organizer toolbar). You can still see the map and the
positional info for any image in this view by selecting
the Places tab on the Info palette.
Creating a Share My Trip Project
With all of the photos from a trip tagged with
positional data, you can create a web slideshow that
displays them superimposed on a map. If you have a
Dropbox and Facebook account PaintShop Pro will
upload the slideshow files to your Dropbox folder and
post a link to them on Facebook.
146

STEP 1 Start by selecting a folder of geotagged
images in the Manage workspace – here I’ve used the
Marrakesh images I geotagged in the previous project
– and selecting all. Then click the Share My Trip
button on the Organizer toolbar. If you haven’t used
Share My Trip before, a Getting started window will
give you some details about how it works, when
you’ve read it click the close button.
147

STEP 2 Type a title for your trip in the title field of the
Share My Trip window. The project will be saved to
your
Documents
folder
unless
you
choose
somewhere else by clicking the folder icon next to the
Save in field at the bottom of the window. Next press
Ctrl-A to select all of the thumbnails and click the Next
button.
148

STEP 3 Depending on how many photos are in your
trip, it will take a little while for PaintShop Pro to
create the map. When it’s done you can choose to
have PaintShop Pro upload the HTML slideshow files
to your public Dropbox folder and post a link to it on
Facebook. Unless you do this the only place the
slideshow will be viewable is from your computer.
Check the box labelled ‘Yes, upload my photo map to
a public Dropbox folder’ and a browser window will
open for you to login and authorize access to your
Dropbox account for PaintShop Pro.
149

STEP 4 Now check the box to share the link on
Facebook. Once again a browser window will open so
that you can login and authorize access to your
account. Once you’ve done that use the arrow keys to
choose a thumbnail for the slideshow and click the
next button.
150

STEP 5 PaintShop Pro will now create the project
files and start uploading them to your Dropbox folder.
Depending on how many photos there are and the
speed of your Internet connection, this may take a
little while. When it’s finished you’ll be asked to log
back into Facebook and you can then add a message
to your post and choose privacy settings. Once that’s
done, the finish dialog box gives you the option to
delete the local files and open a browser window to
view your Facebook post.
151

STEP 6 That’s it, you’re done, following the link from
your
Facebook
post
will
take
you
to
the
Web
slideshow hosted from a public Dropbox folder. You
don’t have to go via Facebook, just copy the url from
the browser address bar then you can e-mail it to
friends. Click on a map pin to display the photo taken
at that location, scroll through using the navigation
buttons and select a thumbnail from the film strip at
the bottom.

Chapter 3
Improving Your Photos
Basic Editing
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• This chapter explains how to use PaintShop Pro
X6’s tools to improve digital photos that suffer
from common problems like incorrect exposure,
or are simply a bit dull and lifeless and need
polishing up. PaintShop Pro X6 has a selection of
tools like Smart Photo Fix and Color Balance
which do most of the work for you and make it
easy to get good results with very little effort.
You’d have read in Chapter 1 that there are two
workspaces designed for this kind of work. We’ll
begin by looking at practical things you can do to
improve your photos using the Adjust workspace
before moving on to explain in detail what kind of
tools are available in the Edit workspace and how
to make the best use of them. Later in the chapter
154

we’ll look at some of the more advanced tools for
enhancing
image
quality
like
Hue/Saturation/
Lightness, Levels, Histogram Adjustment, the
Unsharp Mask filter and High Pass Sharpen filter.
• There are so many tools in PaintShop Pro X6 that
it’s sometimes difficult to know where to start, but
if you work through this chapter, you’ll discover
one of its biggest strengths; you can start with the
simple tools like Smart
Photo Fix and, if you can’t get good results, move
on to the more advanced tools that target specific
exposure and color problems.
• It’s not all about fixing pictures. Tools like Hue/
Saturation/Lightness, Curves and the Hue Map
can be used creatively to replace colors and this
chapter also shows you how to do this.
• Sharpening digital photos is something that can
hugely improve picture quality, but there’s more to
it than simply whacking on the Unsharp Mask
filter. Toward the end of the chapter, I’ll show you
how to do it properly and, for those who want to
squeeze every last drop of sharpness out of their
photos without introducing other problems like
noise and haloing, there’s a step-by-step project
that covers advanced sharpening using the High
Pass Sharpen filter.
• Another step-by-step project goes into detail on
how to use Smart Photo Fix. Although this is
covered comprehensively in the chapter, it’s such
a
useful
tool
that
I
thought
a
hands-on
walk-through would be a big help if you haven’t
used this tool before.
155

Adjust or Edit?
PaintShop Pro X6 has a bewilderingly large array of
tools for fixing up photos, so many in fact, that it can
be a problem knowing where to start. If that’s the
case, then the short answer is probably the Adjust
workspace, it contains all the tools you need to sort
out most of the common problems that affect digital
photos from bad exposure to red-eye removal.
Using the Adjust Workspace
To get started, if you’re not already in the Adjust
workspace, enter it by selecting the Adjust tab at the
top of the screen and select an image to adjust from
the Organizer palette. The Smart Photo Fix panel
appears in the Adjust palette on the left with four
sliders to control Brightness, Shadows, Highlights and
Saturation.
Smart Photo Fix
The first thing to do is ignore the sliders and click the
Suggest settings button at the top of the Smart Photo
Fix
panel.
This
almost
always
results
in
an
improvement to the image, but there may be more
that you can do. You’ll notice that the sliders have
moved
with
the
suggested
settings,
now’s
your
chance to tweak them to see if you can improve on
the suggested settings.
With all these adjustments you need to be careful not
to overdo it, particularly when you’re altering the tonal
qualities of an image as we are here. The brightness
slider, for example, can be used to compensate for a
small degree of over- or under-exposure, but nothing
156

like the degree to which you can adjust Camera RAW
files as discussed in Chapter 2. Keep an eye on the
histogram
when
you’re
making
these
changes.
Generally you’re looking for a graph that just extends
to both ends of the x-axis. For more help on
understanding the histogram and using it to guide
your adjustments, see page 72 later in the chapter.
Fig 3.1 With Smart Photo Fix, start by clicking the
Suggest settings button, more often than not it will
result in a marked improvement and at the very least
it will provide you with a result you can improve on
using the sliders.
When you use the brightness slider you affect the
value of every pixel in the image – from the darkest
shadows to the brightest highlights. The Shadows and
Highlights sliders only affect pixels in their respective
tonal ranges. These sliders can be used to make
further changes to an incorrectly exposed photo or to
add contrast to a flat one. Dragging either slider left
darkens pixels and right lightens them. So to make
157

the shadows a bit deeper you’d drag the shadows
slider to the left, and you’d do the same thing with the
highlights slider to recover blown highlights.
Tip
At any stage in the process you can use the Undo
and Redo buttons on the Adjust toolbar to get a
before and after view of the last change you made.
The saturation slider controls the vibrancy of the
colors. If the color is looking a bit dull and washed out
you can give it a boost by dragging the slider to the
right and vice versa if the colors look over-saturated
and unnatural. If the color saturation looks fine, but
the colors themselves don’t look quite right, maybe
the entire image has a predominant color cast, or a
sunlit evening doesn’t look quite as warm and inviting
as you remember it, position the cursor over the
image and it will change to an eyedropper. Now find
an area of the image that is, or should be neutral in
color, black and whites are usually the better option,
but greys work just as well. Click on that part of the
image to add a color sampler and you should see an
immediate change in the overall color of the image. If
you’ve
selected
well,
the
change
will
be
an
improvement,
if it isn’t, don’t worry, just click again on another
neutral area to add another sampler.
158

Fig
3.2 Adjust
white
balance
and
remove
predominant color casts by placing samplers in the
image using the eyedropper. You shouldn’t need
more than one or two sampling points.
You can add as many sampling points as you want,
but two or three should be plenty. To delete a
sampling point, just click in it with the eyedropper. As
you hover over the image you’ll see a color swatch
with a numerical readout that tells you the before and
after RGB (red, green and blue) values of the pixel
beneath the eyedropper. The closer together these
numbers are, the nearer to neutral the pixel already is
(e.g.
0,0,0
is
black,
255,255,255
is
white
and
128,128,128 is grey) and the less of a change you’ll
see if you add a color sampler. Clicking on a
non-neutral pixel shifts the color of that pixel toward
159

neutral and makes a similar adjustment to all other
colors in the image. So if you click on a bluish pixel, it
will become greyer and all of the colors in the photo
will become less blue and more yellow (the opposite
or ‘complementary’ color to blue). If you click on a
yellow pixel the reverse will happen.
Now
let’s
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
other
adjustments in the Adjust palette.
White Balance
White Balance provides a different way of doing what
I’ve just been talking about – making a global
adjustment to all the colors in a photo to remove a
predominant cast. Instead of Smart Photo Fix’s color
samplers, there are two sliders, one labeled Cooler/
Warmer and the other Purple/Green. If it makes it any
easier you can think of the Cooler/Warmer slider as a
Blue/Yellow slider. With these two sliders, you can
add or remove pretty much any color cast from the
image. More often than not, the Cooler/Warmer slider
is the only one you’ll need. You’ll notice there’s a
numerical readout opposite both sliders. The Green/
Purple one goes from −100 to 100 and the Cooler/
Warmer slider goes from 9500 at the Cooler end to
2000
at
the
Warmer
end.
This
is
the
color
temperature – a numerical measure of the color of the
light.
Brightness/Contrast
Brightness/Contrast is something that, at first sight,
looks like a useful enough tool, but I’d recommend
you treat it with caution. To see why, drag the
Brightness
slider
to
the
right
and
watch
what
160

happens. Everything in the image gets brighter which
is perhaps what you’d expect, but keep dragging and
eventually everything turns pure white. Now you might
think that as long as you keep the adjustments to a
minimum, Brightness is OK, but the problem is it
brightens all the pixels in a photo by the same amount
when ordinarily you only want to brighten the darker
ones. The result is that all the lighter pixels – the
highlights in your photo – get blown out to pure white,
and the detail is lost forever.
The same thing happens for contrast, only doubly so
– you lose detail in the shadows and the highlights at
the same time. Contrast can make for quite a
dramatic effect, but if you’re attempting to improve the
tonal quality of your photos you’re much better of
sticking to the slider in Smart Photo Fix or venturing
into the Edit workspace and using some of the tools
described later in this chapter.
Fill Light/Clarity
Fill Light/Clarity was introduced in PaintShop Pro X4,
and like all of these Adjust palette tools is also
available in the Edit workspace. Fill light is specifically
for adding light into the shadow regions of photos and
is
particularly
useful
for
shots
that
are
slightly
under-exposed or where you should’ve used a fill
flash, but didn’t.
The Clarity half of this tool is more generally useful
and in fact I’m not at all sure why Corel has lumped it
in with Fill Light but there you are. What it does is
difficult to explain, but easy to see so have a go with
the slider and see what you think. Clarity increases
local contrast; in other words, it takes a clump of
161

pixels and lightens the bright ones and darkens the
dark ones. It works in the same way as some
sharpening filters only on larger groups of pixels and
the
effect, rather than to sharpen the image, is to make it
‘pop’. Well, I did say it was difficult to explain, but it’s
something that will make the majority of your photos
look better. It depends on the individual shot and it’s
down to your own personal judgment, but I’d say
anywhere between 20 and 50 will give good results
most of the time.
Fig 3.3 Treat Brightness/Contrast with caution, better
still avoid it altogether, as it won’t help improve the
quality
of
your
photos,
no,
not
even
the
under-exposed ones.
Local Tone Mapping
162

Even the Corel help file isn’t of much help in
describing
what
this
does.
Tone
mapping
is
a
technique
used
in
HDR
(High
Dynamic
Range)
imaging that enables the huge tonal range of an HDR
photo to be represented in an 8- or 16-bit RGB file.
Local Tone Mapping as applied in the Adjust palette
seems to make little positive difference to image
quality, but it can be used as a special effect. If your
camera has an effects mode, for example, Art filters
on
Olympus
compact
and
system
cameras
or
Creative Effects on Canon compacts, the Dramatic
tone filters produce a similar result to what you’ll get
with Local Tone Mapping.
You can find a tutorial showing how to recreate the
Dramatic filter effect on gopaintshoppro.co.uk.
High Pass Sharpen
High
Pass
Sharpen
is
a
specialist
sharpening
technique that excels at sharpening image detail
without exaggerating noise. There’s a step-by-step
project at the end of this chapter that demonstrates
how to use it in the Edit workspace. If you just want to
try it out here, first make sure to click the 1:1 button
on the Adjust toolbar so you can see the results
properly.
Digital Noise Removal
There’s a full description of how to use the Digital
Noise Removal filter in the Edit workspace in chapter
4 on page 113. Briefly, this filter reduces the impact of
digital noise – the graininess inherent in digital photos
taken with the camera set on high ISO sensitivities for
low light conditions. The detail slider applies the noise
163

reduction, so the further to the right you slide, the
more noise filtration will be applied. The problem is
that beyond a certain point, this will start to soften real
image detail, so when this happens, you need to back
off a little. You can restore detail back into the image
by using the Correction Blend slider to blend the
noise-filtered version with the original and finally apply
some sharpening.
Using the Edit Workspace
The Edit workspace is the heart of PaintShop Pro X6.
In
earlier
versions
of
the
application,
the
Edit
workspace was all you got, the Manage and Adjust
workspaces have evolved over time to address the
need
for
managing
and
applying
straightforward
adjustments to photos. So Edit is where you come to
make more involved adjustments and to work on
bigger projects.
The Edit workspace can look a little intimidating if
you’re new to it, but the Organizer palette running
across the bottom of the screen should be familiar
and the Learning Center, which I introduced in
Chapter 1, is on the right. In Chapter 1, I also walked
through what’s on the various menus, the toolbars,
the palettes and some of the more advanced editing
tools.
What we’re going to do next is take a more in-depth
look at the tools available in the Edit workspace and
how you can use them. Mostly, these tools are for the
kinds of adjustments we’ve already looked at in the
Adjust workspace, but they’re more powerful and
more versatile and therefore provide more scope both
for improving photos and for creating something
164

entirely new. But before we do that I first want to
introduce the histogram. If it isn’t already on the
screen, you can display the histogram by pressing F7,
or
if
you
want
to
go
the
long
way
round,
View>Palettes>Histogram.
Using the Histogram
The histogram is a graph of the values of all the pixels
in the image. Dark pixels have low values and light
pixels have high values. Black is 0, white is 255 and
mid-grey
is
128.
So
the
histogram
shows
the
distribution of pixels in the image from black to white
with darker pixels on the left and light ones on the
right.
When
making
tonal
adjustment
(in
other
words
adjustments that only affect the brightness range of
an image and not its color), it’s useful to display just
the greyscale histogram, you can do this using the
histogram in the Edit workspace, just uncheck the
boxes for the other channels. Unfortunately, the
histogram in the Adjust workspace, which sits at the
top of the Adjust palette, isn’t so accommodating and
shows separate charts for the RGB channels in the
image. Even so, you can get a good idea of the tonal
distribution by viewing the RGB charts as one.
The shape of the histogram depends on the nature of
the subject, but generally speaking, it should show a
reasonably even distribution from black to white.
Typical problems like under- and over-exposure have
very characteristic histograms. In an under-exposed
image, there’s a predominance of dark pixels and few,
if any, white ones, so the histogram tends to be
bunched down at the left-hand end. In over-exposed
165

photos the histogram is bunched at the right-hand
end, with no black or very dark pixels.
Another problem that is easily confirmed by a quick
look at the histogram is lack of contrast. Images that
lack contrast look flat and dull. They lack punch due
to the absence of pure black and pure white pixels.
The tonal range starts at light grey and ends at dark
grey, and the histogram this time is all in the middle of
the range with no pixels at either end.
In the Smart Photo Fix dialog box when you make an
adjustment with the Brightness sliders, the histogram
displays a pink overlay which shows you how the
tonal
distribution
of
pixels
changes;
the
original
histogram appears in grey. If you drag any of the
sliders toward the right (brighter) direction, you’ll see
the histogram move the same way. Dragging the
Shadows and Highlights sliders moves the histogram
at the ends, whereas the Overall slider moves the
whole thing, but the middle more than the edges.
The
important
thing
to
remember
when
making
adjustments with the brightness sliders is not to let the
histogram slip off either end of the chart – it should
taper off just before reaching the end. If you allow
pixels to drop off the end of the histogram, you are
losing image detail – in the case of highlights
remapping light grey pixels to pure white and, in the
shadows,
turning
darker
detail
pure
black.
This
applies
to
all
dark
and
light
colors
which
are
represented by grey pixels in the RGB channels.
166

Fig 3.4
Understanding histograms will help you make the
right
decisions
about
tonal
adjustments.
(1)
In
under-exposed photos the graph is bunched down the
left-hand side. (2) The histogram for over-exposed
photos is squeezed up on the right-hand side. (3) The
correct exposure shows most detail in the central area
of the histogram, but the image lacks contrast. (4)
Smart Photo Fix improves things by ‘stretching’ the
histogram to produce true blacks and whites, but be
167

careful: using these settings will lose some highlight
detail in the lighthouse building – note the clipped
bunch of pixels on the far right of the histogram.
Tools for Correcting Color Problems
For most situations Smart Photo Fix provides all the
tools you’ll need to sort out exposure problems and
remove unwanted color casts from your photos. But
it’s not the best way to deal with every problem, and
it’s always good to have alternatives. The following
tools not only provide an alternative route to sorting
out problem photos but also can be used creatively to
introduce new color and tonal effects. Chapter 4
shows you how to introduce color into black and white
images using some of these tools.
White Balance
To use PaintShop Pro X6’s White Balance tool select
Adjust>White Balance. You can check the ‘Preview
on Image’ box to preview the results on the main
image, but if you click the Preview triangle on the left
you can see before and after previews which can be
much more useful, particularly if you maximize the
panel.
White Balance has a Basic and Advanced mode. In
Basic mode it couldn’t be simpler to use – you just
drag the slider to the right to make photos warmer
and to the left to make them cooler. If you simply want
to neutralize a color cast, check the Smart White
Balance box and set the slider in the center.
168

For more control over white balance, check the
Advanced Options box. This divides the dialog box
into two panels.
For PaintShop Pro X6 users, this just provides an
additional set of sliders (the ones on top) which you
can use to make further adjustments to the white
balance. If you’re using PaintShop Pro X4 or an
earlier version, these sliders work a little differently
(it’s also called Color Balance, not White Balance in
X4 and earlier versions). The tools in the Color
Balance
panel
are
used
to
identify
the
original
conditions under which the photo was taken; you then
use the sliders in the Enhance Color Balance panel to
make further minor adjustments. This can be a little
counter-intuitive if you’re not used to it, because
dragging the Temperature slider in the Color Balance
panel toward warm actually makes the image cooler
or more blue. This is because you’re telling the
program that the original lighting conditions were
warmer than those depicted in the unadjusted image.
Tip
In the White Balance dialog box, clicking either side
of the slider makes a fixed increment adjustment.
The Color Temperature sliders increase or decrease
by 100 and the Tint sliders go up or down by 10.
Alternatively, you can enter a figure in the number
field or use the toggle buttons to increase or
decrease the amount by one.
For example, if you set your camera’s white balance
for indoor use, and then go and take photos outdoors
without resetting it, all of your pictures will have a blue
169

cast. This is because daylight is much cooler (or more
blue) than the artificial indoor light that you’ve set the
camera up for.
In the Color Balance dialog, by dragging the White
Balance
Temperature
slider
toward
cool,
you’re
saying that the actual color temperature of the light
this picture was taken in was much cooler than what
the camera was set up for and recorded – and the
blue cast is eliminated.
170

Fig 3.5
Nearly all digital cameras have an automatic white
balance feature which in most circumstances works
well to assess the prevailing lighting conditions. It’s
not foolproof however and in this instance has
resulted in a blue/green cast. (1) When you select
Adjust>White Balance, the image is automatically
assessed and the preview thumbnail on the right
shows you what the corrected image will look like.
These
settings
are
based
on
an
automatically
selected neutral area indicated by the cross-hair
target. (2) To select a different neutral area click
anywhere in the left thumbnail; keep trying different
locations to see if you can improve the result. (3) You
can nearly always improve things by making your own
adjustments using the sliders – in this case to
produce a more neutral, slightly warm result. (4) The
Color Balance dialog is one of the few to offer a useful
set of ready-made presets – just pick the one that
most closely resembles the lighting conditions under
which the photo was taken. Here, the Daylight
(5200K) preset produces near perfect results.
171

Fig 3.6
You can use Fade Correction on pictures that have
faded through age, like this color slide, or those that
just suffer from poor contrast.
There’s another way to get rid of unwanted color
casts in the White Balance dialog box and that’s to
use the Smart Select button. This works in a very
similar fashion to the White Balance option in the
Smart Photo Fix dialog box (don’t confuse it with
Smart Photo Fix in the Adjust workspace, this one’s in
the Edit workspace and you get to it by Adjust>Smart
Photo Fix), except that you only get to place one
target on a black, white or neutral grey area. This isn’t
as much of a limitation as it might seem as one
sample is all you really need. If it doesn’t produce the
desired results, just click somewhere else in the
image and carry on sampling until you hit somewhere
that does. When you’re happy that the color cast has
172

been neutralized, you can use the sliders in the
Enhance Color Balance panel to fine-tune the result.
Channel Mixer
Although it appears under the Adjust>Color menu, the
Channel mixer isn’t the best tool with which to make
color changes to photos. The most practical use for
the Channel mixer is to produce black and white
images – this is covered in Chapter 4.
Fade Correction
The Fade Correction tool is intended for use on, you
guessed it, faded photos. The inks and dyes used in
photographic printing processes aren’t permanent
and, as anyone with prints more than a few years old
will know, they tend to fade with age. Exposure to the
air and light accelerates this process but,
even if you keep your photos in a sealed box, after a
few years, they won’t look as good as the day they
were printed.
The Fade Correction tool is a one-step solution to this
problem. There’s only one setting – use the Amount
slider to vary how much correction is applied. Fade
Correction boosts the saturation and makes a levels
adjustment, so if you’re confident about making those
changes individually, you’ll have more control using
Smart Photo Fix, or Hue/Saturation/Lightness and any
of the tonal adjustment tools. It’ll take a little longer,
but you’ll have more control and obtain better results.
Red/Green/Blue
Red/Green/Blue allows you to add or subtract color
from the individual RGB channels in the image. It
173

works a little like the Channel mixer, only slightly more
intuitively. The trick with Red/Green/Blue is to make
sure all your adjustments add up to zero; otherwise
you’ll affect the brightness of the image. For example,
if you add 20 to the red channel, you should subtract
10 from both the Blue and Green channels (or two
other amounts that add up to 20).
Red/Green/Blue has a few useful presets, like ‘Sun
exposure’, which produces a color cast simulating the
warm tones of late afternoon sun. And you can of
course create and save your own presets.
Fig 3.7 Red/Green/Blue can be tricky to use for color
correcting, but it’s good for effects like this ‘Sun
exposure’ preset.
174

Fig 3.8
By matching a subject color with one of those
displayed under the ‘Master’ drop-down menu and
then shifting the Hue values you can radically change
the color in one part of the picture while not affecting
anything in the rest of the picture.
Hue/Saturation/Lightness
While it’s simple enough to change contrast and color
in a photo using the Histogram and Color Balance
tools, not all picture-makers take the time to adjust the
color hue and its intensity or ‘saturation’.
PaintShop Photo Pro’s Hue/Saturation/Lightness or
‘HSL’
tool
(‘Adjust>Hue
and
Saturation>Hue/
Saturation/Lightness’) is a feature that allows you to
change specific color values within a picture. What
this means, in English, is that you can choose the
yellow values and shift them to blue. When this is
done, all other colors shift the same amount. So reds
shift to green, blues to yellow, and so on. The outer
color circle in this dialog box represents the original
175

color while the smaller inner color circle represents
where that original color has been shifted to.
This tool can be used to remove slight color casts in a
picture or to add specific color effects that you might
not be able to achieve using one of the Color Balance
tools. For my money, the real power in this feature is
its ability to shift color values in individual color
channels. On some pictures this works as if you have
custom-made selections built into the picture.
For example, if it’s a snap of a green-colored car,
you’ll be able to select ‘Green’ from the ‘Master’
drop-down menu and change the Hue values so that
only the car color changes. How neat is that? If there
are other green objects in the frame, these will also
change
color
proportionally;
while
the
selection
concept
works,
it’s
important
to
note
that
it’s
color-specific,
not
pixel-specific.
Options
include
‘Reds’,
‘Greens’,
‘Blues’,
‘Cyans’,
‘Magentas’and
‘Yellows’.
What else can be done using this tool? While hue is
an
expression
of
color
values
within
a
picture,
saturation refers to the intensity of those colors. If you
worked through the Smart Photo Fix section a few
pages
back,
you’ll
have
already
discovered
saturation, so I’ll just reiterate my earlier advice about
overdoing it. Over-saturated colors not only look
unnatural, but can cause problems when printing.
You can also use this dialog to change the lightness
of the image – although there are plenty of other tools
better suited for making tonal adjustments. Another
neat effect is to colorize the picture by clicking the
Colorize checkbox and increasing the Saturation
176

slider. Colorize essentially applies an old-fashioned
tinting effect to the picture; the higher the saturation,
the stronger the tint. Click the ‘Colorize’ checkbox and
move the Hue slider, noting how the color in the tint
changes. Move the Saturation slider to increase or
reduce the intensity.
If colorizing as a special effect is all you are after use
the
Colorize
dialog
(‘Adjust>Hue
and
Saturation>Colorize’).
This
is
faster
and
less
complicated than the full-on HSL tool, plus it has the
additional
benefit
of
having
varicolored
‘amount’
sliders that display the part of the spectrum that the
sample is taken from. This is a nice touch.
Hue Map
The Hue Map is another slightly off-center tool used
to change specific colors within a picture. This is
similar to applying a color change using the HSL tool
on a specific channel, as just described. You can
select a particular color,
move the appropriate slider to choose another hue for
that color only and check the results live.
177

Fig 3.9 In the Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog, check
the Colorize box and watch as PaintShop Photo Pro
tints the entire image. Use the Saturation slider to
temper the effect.
Fig 3.10 The Hue Map works like a graphic equalizer
for colors. Use the sliders to change only colors in a
specific band of the hue spectrum, here the blue
hangers have been changed to red. Fine-tune the
effect using the two fields at the base of the dialog for
Saturation.
Tools for Correcting Exposure Problems
On the Brightness and Contrast submenu of the
Adjust menu, you’ll find no fewer than ten tools for
adjusting the tonal values in your pictures. Why so
many? Well, many of these tools do the same thing in
a slightly different fashion. As you become more
experienced, you’ll no doubt find your own personal
favorite. For some people, Levels is the only way to
make tonal adjustments to an image, others swear by
Histogram Adjustment. There is at least one tonal
178

adjustment tool that’s probably best avoided, so we’ll
deal with that first.
Brightness/Contrast
This is the first option on the Adjust>Brightness and
Contrast menu – give it a rearward glance every time
you flash past it on your way to more useful tools. As
we saw earlier, the problem with Brightness/Contrast
is that it applies a blanket adjustment across the tonal
range – there’s little that’s sophisticated or subtle
about it.
When you drag the Brightness slider to the right, each
and every pixel value is increased by the same
amount and the result is that the highlights in your
image quickly disappear. The same happens to the
shadows when you go in the opposite direction. Let’s
waste no more time on it.
179

Fig 3.11
OK, this is the last word on Brightness/Contrast. A
quick glance at the histogram reveals the damage –
no more highlights and shadows turned to mush. You
have been warned!
180

Fig 3.12 Use Curves for ultimate control over specific
parts of the tonal range, or special effects. Create a
solarization effect using an S-shaped curve or reverse
the slope for a negative.
Fill Light/Clarity
Fill light/Clarity can be used to give a boost to slightly
dull looking photos. Fill light boosts detail in the
shadows
if
dragged
to
the
right
and
darkens
highlights if dragged to the left. Clarity applies a local
contrast boost to photos which makes them ‘pop’. The
filter is a sort of hybrid that combines contrast
adjustment and sharpening. If you’re interested in the
technical wherewithal, and this is guesswork on my
part, Clarity applies the Unsharp mask filter with a
high radius setting and a low amount.
Curves
181

In some ways, Curves is the most versatile of the
tonal adjustment tools because it allows you to
experiment with altering pixel values in any one part
of the range without affecting the rest. The curve is
also a simple concept to grasp. Input values are
displayed on the horizontal axis and output values on
the vertical axis, so initially the curve is in fact a
straight diagonal line running upward from left to right
at 45 degrees.
Dragging the top end of the line horizontally to the left
has the same effect as dragging the Highlight Input
slider in the Histogram Adjustment or Levels tool to
the left. If you click in the center of the line, a control
point is added and dragging this is akin to moving the
Gamma slider in Histogram Adjustment or Levels.
But neither of those tools can match Curves when it
comes to tweaking a narrow range of tones. By
adding additional points to the curve and adjusting
them, you can tweak the shadows while leaving the
highlights untouched. You can also use Curves for
extreme tonal effects. You can create a solarization
effect (traditionally achieved in the darkroom by
momentarily switching the lights on halfway through
processing) by making the curve S-shaped.
Highlight/Midtone/Shadow
This could be quite a useful tool as it provides
individual control over the highlights, midtones and
shadows in your photos. However, it is complicated
by the fact that, instead of pixel values, it uses
percentages.
It
also
has
two
different
ways
of
applying the figures – an absolute and relative
method, which makes it even more difficult to work
182

out what’s going on. There are other tools, namely
Histogram Adjustment and Levels, that are more
versatile, provide better feedback and are easier to
use.
Tip
You
can
apply
any
of
these
adjustments
to
selections. Make the selection first, save it, and then
run the tone adjustment, as described.
Histogram Adjustment
The Histogram Adjustment dialog box can be a little
intimidating at first glance, but if you’ve read the
earlier section on using the histogram, you’ll already
be well on your way to getting the most from this
versatile tool.
As we discovered earlier, the histogram is a graphical
representation of the tonal values of all of the pixels in
an image. Black pixels appear on the far left, getting
lighter as you move toward the right on the horizontal
axis. The more pixels there are of a particular value,
the higher the line appears at that point.
The three most useful controls in this dialog box are
the triangles that appear beneath the histogram,
which allow you to remap the black point, white point
and gamma. To produce an image with good tonal
distribution
and
contrast,
you
should
drag
the
Highlight Input slider (the white triangle) to the right
edge of the histogram and the black triangle to the left
edge. Use the central Gamma slider to make overall
adjustments to the brightness.
183

There are other controls, like the slider on the right
that allows you to expand or compress the midtones
for solarization-style effects, but Curves is better
suited to making these kinds of adjustments.
Histogram Equalize and Histogram Stretch
These two are essentially one-step applications of
specific histogram (or levels, or curves, depending on
how you want to look at it) adjustments. Equalize is
the least useful of the two as it averages out all the
pixel values across the histogram (try pressing F7 to
display
the
Histogram
palette,
then
applying
Histogram equalize and you’ll see).
Histogram stretch automatically sets the black and
white points to the values of the darkest and lightest
pixels in the image. It’s exactly the same as selecting
Histogram
Adjustment
and
dragging
the
triangle
controls explained in the previous section to the ends
of the histogram. As such, it’s an excellent one-step
contrast fix.
Tip
Though not all the tonal adjustment tools have their
own histogram display (Levels being the prime
example), the live Histogram palette can be used
instead. Prior to selecting Levels (or Curves, or
Highlights/Midtones/Shadows) press F7 to display
the Histogram palette. Now, when you click the
Proof or Auto Proof button the Live Histogram
palette will automatically update.
Levels
184

The controls in the Levels dialog box work in a similar
way to those of the Histogram Adjustment tool. You
can use the Output Levels controls to reduce contrast
in the shadows and highlights. This is the best way to
produce a ‘knocked back’ image tint for a panel on a
website or printed publication that has text running
over the top. By dragging the black Output Levels
slider to the right, you can lighten the dark pixels in
the image and still retain detail in the midtones and
highlights.
Threshold
Threshold converts an image to pure black and white
– what used to be called ‘lineart’ Enter the value that
determines whether pixels are converted to black or
white in the Threshold dialog box. The default is 128 –
any pixels darker than a midtone grey are turned
black and any lighter are turned white. As with
desaturation, threshold removes the color, but doesn’t
change the image mode, making it possible to add
color back in and produce interesting graphic effects.

Using Fill Flash and Backlighting
While
the
Histogram
Adjustment
tool
provides
ultimate control of image tonal values throughout the
entire range, sometimes that can be its biggest
drawback. Often you’ll want to change tonal values in
one part of the range – the shadows or the highlights.
The difficulty with using the Histogram Adjustment
tool in such circumstances is that, more often than
not, while you can make considerable improvements
in one part of the image it’s at the cost of lost image
detail elsewhere in the tonal range.
For example, in trying to get back shadow detail in
under-exposed areas, you’ll often find that you lose
detail in the highlights. Likewise, attempting to restore
detail in over-exposed areas, the sky for example,
you’ll find that shadow detail disappears into the
darkness.
You can get around this problem by making careful
feathered selections, but PaintShop Pro has two
filters aimed at precisely this problem: the Fill Flash
filter and the Backlighting filter.
The Fill Flash Filter
As its name suggests, the Fill Flash filter provides the
digital equivalent of fill-in flash – a photographic
technique that uses flash in daylight conditions to
provide fill-in lighting for shadow detail.
187

Fig 3.14 Use the Fill Flash filter to restore detail in
shadow areas of strongly backlit subjects.
The kind of situation where you might use fill-in flash
is where the subject is strongly backlit, for example in
front of a window or on a beach. Typically, camera
automatic
metering
systems
select
an
average
exposure setting for such situations, resulting in very
dark shadows. The Fill Flash filter allows you to
lighten the tones in the shadows while leaving the
midtones and highlights unaffected.
To use Fill Flash click the Fill Flash button on the
Photo toolbar or select Fill Flash from the Adjust
menu. Maximize the Fill Flash dialog box, so you can
see a generously sized before and after preview and
use the Zoom tools so that most of the photo is in
view. You can adjust the amount of fill flash applied
by entering a value in the Strength field, or by using
the slider just below it. The default setting of 40 works
188

well with all but very under-exposed images. If you
need to apply more than 60 keep an eye out for noise
– a speckled grainy appearance in areas of flat color
or tone. The Fill Flash filter also includes a Saturation
slider which can be used to add or remove color.
Fig 3.15 Use the Backlighting filter to restore burnt
out highlights.
The Backlighting Filter
The Backlighting filter solves the opposite problem to
Fill Flash. Where the camera has made a suitable
exposure to capture good shadow detail in an image
with a wide tonal range, the highlight detail will be
over-exposed. This often happens to the sky detail on
189

photos taken in the shade on bright sunny days. The
Backlighting filter can help restore highlight detail
without
affecting
shadow
areas.
Select
the
Backlighting filter by clicking its button on the Photo
toolbar
or
from
the
Adjust
menu
(Adjust>Backlighting).
Making Photos (Appear) Sharper
Sounds too good to be true? While it’s acceptable to
change color, contrast or saturation in a digital file,
changing the sharpness is a little trickier.
PaintShop Pro has several tools designed to make
pictures
appear
sharper
than
when
they
were
scanned or shot using a digital camera. For some this
might seem a godsend, but it’s important to note that
you can never really change an out-of-focus picture to
one that looks pin-sharp. Even well-focused digital
shots can look a little soft, however, and that’s
something that can be fixed.
How does this magic work? Most sharpness tools act
on picture contrast. You might have noticed this using
the Histogram tools. A general contrast boost usually
makes a picture appear sharper.
Unsharp Mask
PaintShop Pro has several sharpness filters. Clarify is
a one-button filter used to add a quick bump in
contrast and image sharpness. Most times this works
well; however, for total control you have to use the
perversely named Unsharp Mask filter. What this
does is apply a selected contrast boost, at pixel level,
to parts of the picture with varying lightness levels.
190

The reason that this is the best picture-sharpening
tool is that it has three adjustable controls written into
the equation: Radius, Strength and Clipping. Radius
selects the number of pixels around the point of
contrast difference. Strength controls the amount of
contrast added to those pixels while Clipping affects
the lightness of the chosen pixels.
One
of
the
disadvantages
in
sharpening
digital
pictures is that the filter is non-discretionary; it has a
habit of sharpening the bits you don’t want to sharpen
as well as the bits you do. This might include a
model’s skin as well as any digital noise, film grain or
other electronic imperfections that have been added
to the file along the way. So, the more it’s sharpened,
the more noticeable the imperfections (the digital
noise) become. Help is at hand though, because the
main reason for the dialog controls is to help in
minimizing this inevitable noise increase.
• Too much Radius creates a nasty-looking whitish
halo throughout the high-contrast sections of the
picture.
• Too much Strength adds an equally fiendish
grittiness that looks particularly bad once in print.
• Too much Clipping makes the picture appear soft,
destroying the sharpness effect entirely.
Like all sophisticated photo-editing tools, unsharp
masking requires practice to get right. There’s no
‘perfect’ setting because some pictures need more
sharpening than others.
The picture’s end use also has a bearing on how you
sharpen its pixels; inkjet prints and images destined
191

for
the
web
need
less
sharpening
than
those
designed for commercial printing.
As a general rule start with:
• A Radius of one or two pixels.
• A Strength between 100 and 200.
• A Clipping value of ‘zero’.
If nothing seems to improve in the picture with these
settings,
increase
the
Strength
value.
Then
try
increasing the Radius value (a bit at a time). If the
Unsharp Mask effect is applied to a high-contrast
picture, you’ll need to dial-in a small Clipping value to
soften its impact. The beauty of this is that you see
what you are getting instantly and can make changes
live before applying them to the full resolution version.
PaintShop Pro comes with two other no-brainer
sharpen tools: the Sharpen and the Sharpen More
filters. The Sharpen filter is a good place to start; it
applies a preset contrast boost to a selected range of
pixels. This might be enough to give most digital
snaps a nice sharpen. For a stronger filter effect, try
the Sharpen More filter. This is slightly more radical,
though still by no means as radical as the Unsharp
Mask filter can be. The good thing about these effects
is that they are repeatable. If the effect isn’t strong
enough, repeat it using the keyboard shortcut ‘Ctrl+Y’
till it is.
High Pass Sharpening
As we’ve already mentioned, one of the problems with
unsharp masking is that it can sharpen parts of the
image you just don’t want to sharpen. PaintShop Pro
X6 includes a method of sharpening that doesn’t
192

suffer from these drawbacks because it confines
sharpening only to edge detail and other high-contrast
areas within an image.
High pass sharpening isn’t new, but previously it was
a
complicated
business
that
involved
duplicating
layers, applying a High Pass filter, or creating an edge
mask and using Layer Blend modes. While all this
was great fun, the new High Pass Sharpen filter
makes things much easier. See the step-by-step
work-through at the end of the chapter to find out how
to get the best from High Pass Sharpen.
193

Fig 3.16
Different
images
require
different
Unsharp
Mask
settings, so a trial and revise approach is required.
The trick is to increase overall sharpness without
introducing sharpening ‘artifacts’. Reducing the radius
from its default setting of 2 and increasing the
strength to 300 introduces unwanted white specks.
194

You could eliminate these using the Clipping slider,
but it’s better just to reduce the Strength until they
disappear. A final setting of Radius 1.20, Strength
150 and Clipping 5 results in a sharper image with
minimal sharpening artifacts.
Fig 3.17
Use PaintShop Photo Pro’s High Pass Sharpen filter
to sharpen edge detail without exaggerating noise
and other unwanted detail.
Tips for making digital files appear sharper:
• If using a digital camera, make sure that the
picture is exposed correctly and that the focus is
correct for the subject. It’s possible to enlarge the
image on the camera LCD screen to check this
195

focus closely. If you think that there’s a problem,
reshoot.
• In Shutter (S) or Manual (M) shoot modes, pick a
faster shutter speed (a higher number) to ‘freeze’
action, essential if the subject is fast-moving.
• Learn to use the AF lock in the camera. This
works by half-depressing the shutter button that
activates the AF system. Once the in-camera
audio ‘beep’ confirmation sounds, you can then
either press the shutter fully or reframe to position
a subject off-center and then take the picture. The
most obvious cause of out-of-focus snaps is from
the subject not being in the camera’s AF focusing
area when the shutter button is pressed.
• Scans
normally
require
unsharp
masking
to
compensate for the scan process, which can
make things appear slightly unsharp.
• Most
scanner
software
comes
with
inbuilt
Unsharp Mask filters to compensate for quality
loss. Most will not be as good as PaintShop Pro’s
Sharpen tools. You might want to leave that
feature switched ‘Off’ and sharpen the files using
PSP later. It’s always preferable to have an
untouched ‘Master’ file on your hard drive. Once
an effect like unsharp masking has been added to
a file, it’s impossible to remove.
• Use PaintShop Pro’s Overview palette to move
the view around the preview picture. Sharpening
never has the same effect across all sections of a
picture, so it pays to check the important bits up
close.
• If you just don’t have a clue where to start, try the
Randomize tab. It’s a good starting place and one
196

that’s likely to come up with an answer in a matter
of a few clicks.
Adding Soft Focus Effects
In a digital file, regular blur filters never produce as
nice a result as you’d get using film and real glass soft
focus filter screwed to the front of a lens.
Fig 3.18 The Soft Focus filter has a range of
possibilities.
The
default
values
may
give
an
over-the-top
result,
particularly
on
low
resolution
images. The presets provide good results, though,
and you can experiment with the sliders to get the
197

exact effect you’re after. Nathan Blaney, iStockphoto
1790776.
PaintShop Photo Pro addresses this problem with a
Soft Focus filter. The difference between this and the
straight ‘blur everything’ filter set (Average, Blur, Blur
More, Gaussian Blur, Motion Blur, Radial Blur) is that
the former applies more blur to the highlights than to
the other tones. This produces an effect similar to the
effect
that
you’d
get
using
a
regular
glass
photographic filter – only PaintShop Photo Pro offers
a wealth of controls over how you can influence the
way that the blur looks.
You can vary the overall softness of the filter, as well
as the edge importance (edge sharpness), plus there
are three controls for adjusting the blur halo (Amount,
Size and Visibility).
Much time has been put into creating this filter and it
works extremely well, emulating the precise look of a
glass filter costing more than PaintShop Photo Pro
itself. As with most filters, it’s possible to try a
combination of effects using the Randomize tab. You
can also save a particular combination for use any
other time via the Preset tab.

Step-by-Step Projects
Improving Your Photos Using Smart Photo Fix
Often, you can make big improvements to photos that
lack contrast, look a bit washed out, are a little on the
dark side or slightly sub-standard in some other way
using One Step Photo Fix.
Sometimes, though, One Step Photo Fix doesn’t
result in a big improvement and you need to take
matters into your own hands. If you don’t feel
confident
about
dealing
directly
with
tools
like
Histogram Adjustment and Color Balance then Smart
Photo Fix is the tool for you. We’ve looked in detail at
using Smart Photo Fix in the Adjust workspace in
Chapter 1, but you can also use it in the Edit
workspace where it provides a little more control over
some of the adjustments.
199

STEP 1 Open the photo you want to fix in the Edit
workspace and select Smart Photo Fix from the
Adjust menu.
STEP 2 If it isn’t already showing, click the Preview
triangle to display the before and after views and
maximize the Smart Photo Fix dialog box to fill the
screen, you can also uncheck Preview on image.
Then check the Advanced Options box to display the
histogram, black and white point sliders and the Color
Balance checkbox.
200

STEP 3 Select default from the preset menu to return
all the settings to zero. The first job is to set the black
and white point sliders, so that the darkest and
lightest pixels in the photo reach either end of the
histogram. Drag the Black slider to the right and
watch the black triangle under the histogram – it too
moves to the right as you drag the slider. Stop
dragging when you reach the first peak or bump in the
histogram – in this case there’s a small group of
pixels at around the 10 mark.
STEP 4 Now drag the White slider until the white
triangle reaches the first bump or peak on the right
side of the histogram – in this case there’s a shallow
plateau that starts at 34 – before the big peak nearer
the middle. What you’ve just done is remap the
darkest and lightest pixels in the photo to pure black
and white. The new histogram is overlayed in red on
the old grey one. You can see the improvement in the
after preview, but if you’re still not quite sure how
201

you’ve managed this, take another look at ‘Using the
histogram’ on page 72.
STEP 5 Often, adjusting the black and white sliders
will be all that’s needed, but the brightness controls
can be used to add detail to the shadows and
highlights and to brighten or darken the image overall.
Click the ‘Zoom image to 100%’ button under the
thumbnails and use the pan tool to center the
kitesurfer. Drag the shadow slider to 20 to bring out
the detail in his face and wetsuit.
202

STEP 6 The next problem is the white balance. This
photo looks much bluer than the actual conditions in
which it was shot. Click the ‘Fit image to window’
button and correct the blue cast by checking the
White Balance box and clicking with the eyedropper
to place a color sampler on any part of the photo that
should be neutral, i.e. Black, white or grey. Here, I’ve
placed markers on the kitesurfer’s black wetsuit and a
cloud. If positioning a marker produces unexpected or
undesirable results, click on the marker again to
remove it.
203

STEP 7 Before sharpening the photo, click the ‘Zoom
image to 100%’ button under the thumbnails. Drag the
Focus slider to the right to sharpen the image, but
don’t go too far or you’ll exaggerate noise and make
the photo look grainy. Finally, drag the saturation
slider to the right, again, be careful not to over-do it, to
give the color a bit of a boost and click OK to apply
the changes.
204

STEP 8 It doesn’t end with Smart Photo Fix, there are
lots of other simple things you can do to improve
photos and give them more impact. Here I’ve used
the crop tool to remove some of the background,
change the aspect ratio and straighten the horizon.
205

Sharpening Photos Using the High Pass Sharpen
Filter
The High Pass Sharpen filter is a real lifesaver with
certain kinds of images. While Unsharp Mask does a
fantastic job 90% of the time, as we’ve seen, it’s
indiscriminate and can create problems, or at least
make existing ones more obvious.
The kinds of photos you should avoid unsharp
masking include:
• Those taken on a high ISO setting (400 and
above) which will, depending on how good your
camera is, display at least some visible noise.
• Photos that were badly exposed and have had a
large tonal correction applied using Smart Photo
Fix, Histogram Adjustment or one of the other
tonal adjustment tools.
• Photos with high JPEG compression applied,
either
because
they
were
taken
using
a
low-quality camera setting or have subsequently
been recompressed using a low-quality JPEG
setting.
• Photos that are well exposed, of a high quality
and fine in every other respect, but have large
areas of flat color, such as an expanse of clear
blue sky.
For all of these images and anything else that fails to
come up shining using the Unsharp Mask filter, follow
these steps.
STEP 1 Open the image to be sharpened in the Edit
workspace. If you plan on using ‘Preview on Image’ to
preview the effect then first make sure to zoom in to
206

100% view (keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+N). Always
view sharpening adjustments at 100% magnification
as it’s the only way you can really see what’s
happening to the individual pixels in the image.
STEP
2
Select
Adjust>Sharpness>High
Pass
Sharpen to open the High Pass Sharpen dialog box
and use the Pan button to select a representative part
of the image. To preview the sharpening in the image
window, check the ‘Preview on Image’ box, having
first zoomed to 100% view as described in step 1.
STEP 3 The High Pass Sharpen dialog box has three
settings – Radius, Strength and Blend Mode. The
default values for these are 10, 70 and Hard Light,
respectively.
The
Radius
setting
determines
the
207

distance within which the filter looks for dissimilar
pixels to sharpen. A larger Radius value will result in
more of the image being sharpened, a smaller one
will sharpen less. With zero Radius none of the image
is sharpened. Use the Pan button to find part of the
image
you
don’t
want
sharpened
(the
sky,
or
out-of-focus background) and adjust the Radius to a
value just below that at which you can see a change.
STEP 4 Now use the Pan button to center a part of
the image that’s representative of what you want to
sharpen. If necessary adjust the Amount slider to
increase or decrease the amount of sharpening
applied.
208

STEP 5 The Hard Light blend mode produces the
most dramatic sharpening. To reduce the effect
change the blend mode to Overlay and for even
gentler sharpening use the Soft Light blend mode.
209

210

PaintShop Pro X6’s High Pass Sharpen filter makes a
fantastic job of sharpening edge detail in images like
this,
without
affecting
out
of
focus
areas
or
compounding common digital image problems like
noise.
Tip
Remember that sharpen filters work by increasing
image contrast and when you increase contrast you
may inadvertently lose highlight and shadow detail
from your photos. When using sharpening filters
always keep one eye on the Histogram palette
(keyboard shortcut F7) to make sure you are not
‘clipping’ the ends of the tonal range.

Using
Camera
RAW
Lab
to
Restore
Detail
in
Over-Exposed Photos
This shot of a horse’s head is over-exposed by
around a stop. If you’d shot this as a jpeg, you might
be able to recover the lost highlight detail in the front
of the horse’s head and the sky in the background,
but
with
only
eight
bits
per
channel
of
pixel
information, the chances are the image would begin
to look harsh and contrasty before you recovered as
much detail as you’d like.
Making the exposure corrections in Camera Raw Lab
gives you much more scope – you can recover more
detail without causing the kind of image degradation
that editing pixels inevitably results in. Remember,
what we’re doing here is simply interpreting the raw
data to give us a more acceptable starting point. Once
the corrections have been made, you can output the
image as a 16-bit RGB file. Then, there’s nothing to
stop you making further improvements in the Editor
workspace. With a rock-solid 16-bit RGB file, you’ll
still
be
in
a
better
position
to
make
further
improvements than you would have been with a 8-bit
jpeg from the camera.
212

STEP 1 Select the Raw file thumbnail in the Manage
workspace, then select the Edit workspace tab to
open the file in Camera RAW Lab and click the
maximize button at the top right to fill the screen. This
is your first chance to get a look at the image as
interpreted using Camera RAW Lab’s default settings.
As well as suffering from over-exposure the white
balance is on the cool side, both problems easily dealt
with in Camera RAW Lab.
213

STEP 2 First deal with the exposure by dragging the
Brightness slider to the left. In this case we’ve
dragged it to −1.0 – effectively reducing the exposure
by one stop. It doesn’t matter if you can’t drag the
slider to precisely 1.0, but if you do want more precise
control use the nudge buttons on the exposure
numeric field next to the slider.
214

STEP 3 The exposure is looking a little better, but the
highlights are still blown out. PaintShop Pro X6’s
Camera Raw Lab has a Highlight recovery tool to deal
with this and it’s extremely effective. Select Normal
from
the
Highlight
Recovery
pull-down
menu
to
restore the highlight detail.
215

STEP 4 The exposure is looking better, but now the
shot looks dull and murky. To increase contrast in the
shadows, drag the Shadow slider to the right. As you
drag, the preview will update and you need to make a
visual assessment of how much Shadow to apply.
You want to increase contrast in the shadows without
losing any detail. Here we’re aiming to make the
horse’s bridle black without losing detail in the neck
and eye.
STEP 5 Increasing the contrast in the shadows has
improved things, but the shot still looks a bit flat. Drag
the Saturation slider to the right to increase the
saturation a little. Don’t overdo it, small movements of
the Saturation slider have quite a large effect. Use the
nudge buttons for precise control. Around 15 on the
Saturation is enough to give the color a bit of a boost.
216

STEP 6 Now we can address the color cast. The ‘As
Shot’ white balance is 5000, but produces too cool a
result – notice the blue highlight running down the
horse’s neck at the back. Selecting one of the presets
– for example Daylight or Cloudy – won’t help as
these are both lower and will result in more blue (see
the section on white balance earlier in this chapter for
a description of how this works). The simplest way to
deal with most color casts is simply to drag the
Temperature slider while assessing the result in the
preview window. Because this shot was taken quite
late in the evening, the light was getting very blue and
the color temperature setting required to eliminate the
cast and produce a more natural looking result is
around 7500.
217

STEP 7 Notice how changing the white balance has
increased the saturation of the yellows and browns?
Our earlier saturation adjustment is now looking a bit
over the top. Use the nudge buttons to knock the
saturation back a little – to around 6 should do it.
218

STEP 8 If you don’t want to edit the image in
PaintShop Photo Pro, clicking the Apply button will
close Camera RAW Lab. If you take a look at the
thumbnail in the Organizer, you’ll see that it has been
updated to reflect the changes you just made and has
a small RAW badge to indicate it has been edited.
These changes are stored in the PaintShop Pro X6
database.
219

STEP 9 To export the RAW image to an RGB file
without opening it again in Camera RAW Lab, select it
in the Organizer and click the Convert RAW button on
the Organizer toolbar. Select an image type and
choose a location on your hard drive where you want
the image saved. The modify button allows you to add
text or sequence numbers to the file name for batch
conversion.

Chapter 4
Image Manipulation
Beyond the Basics
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• So far we’ve looked at what PaintShop Pro X6
has to offer in terms of features and tools for
organizing and editing your photos and covered
some of the basics of image editing. We’ve also
looked at how to fix photos that have a problem
with brightness or color.
• This chapter is subtitled ‘Beyond the Basics’
because we’re going to look at some more
complex features than the ‘one-step’ fixes and
tonal and color adjustment tools covered in the
previous chapters.
• The chapter begins by looking at some of the
methods for removing scratches and blemishes
from your photos. This is a particular problem with
scans of prints, slides and negatives and also
222

when using digital SLRs which can get dust on
the sensor leading to blotchy photos.
• The same techniques can be usefully applied to
removing other things that you don’t want in your
photos such as lamp posts, trees and people
you’re no longer on speaking terms with. You’ll
learn how to become an expert retoucher with the
Clone tool and about some other tools for fixing
damaged photos.
• As in the last chapter, it’s not all about fixing
things. Later on in the chapter you’ll discover how
to produce black and white photos from color
originals using Black and White Film photo effects
and how to produce tints and color overlay effects
to add extra depth and tone to black and white
photos.
• Digital noise can be a real problem when shooting
in low light conditions using a high ISO setting on
your camera. PaintShop Pro X6 has one of the
best tools around for dealing with this problem
and I’ll go into detail on how to get the most from
it. Paradoxically, I’ll also show you how to add
noise to your photos to create atmospheric grain
effects.
• Finally, there’s a brief introduction to PaintShop
Pro’s
Scripting
features.
Scripts
are
one
of
PaintShop Pro’s most powerful features, allowing
you to automatically record and apply a sequence
of editing steps to any number of photos.
• The step-by-step projects at the end of the
chapter
guide
you
through
the
process
of
restoring badly damaged photos and applying a
hand-colored effect to black and white pictures.
223

• No
matter
how
careful
you
might
be
when
scanning film or prints, dirt always gets in the way
and inevitably ends up on the scan. PaintShop
Pro
has
a
good
range
of
filter-based
tools
designed for cleaning up or removing these
problem areas, however bad they might appear.
Dirt isn’t only a problem with scanned photos. If
you use an older digital SLR (many recent models
vibrate the sensor to remove dust) you may have
noticed slight dark blotches on your photos.
These are caused by small particles of dust which
find their way into the camera body and settle on
the sensor. Eventually, you will need to clean the
sensor, or have it done for you, but in the
meantime you can use the techniques described
below to fix the problem.
Removing Scratches and Blemishes from Scans
You might never realize quite how dirty scans can be
unless they are magnified to a size that reveals the
mess. If you only enlarge your snaps to about 6
inches × 4 inches, the worst dust blemishes may
never become apparent. If you print to 20 inches × 16
inches, however, you might get a shock when you see
the dirt and surface scratch marks picked up by the
scanner!
Tip
Don’t use filters to remove large blemishes; they
aren’t that effective and will degrade the overall
picture quality. Use the Clone or Scratch Remover
tool instead.
224

The first thing to do is rescan the print or negative.
Clean the flatbed scanner’s glass platen, the place
where the print is positioned. Use a mild window
cleaner and a soft, lint-free cloth (i.e. linen). Finger
grease, however minimal, is a great dust attractant so
don’t forget to gently wipe the surface of the print as
well. If scanning film, use an appropriate film-cleaning
solution and soft cloth.
Once the scan is made, open the file in PaintShop
Pro and enlarge the file to between 200% and 400%.
Do you see dust specks that weren’t there in the
original? They probably were there, but were just too
small to be noticed. If you
are planning to enlarge and print to A3, or bigger, you
might need to run one, or more, of PaintShop Pro’s
clean-up filters over the file to improve the quality.
Here’s how: open the picture and crop to suit. Many
scanners are more than generous with their flatbed
scan areas, adding extra ‘real estate’ to the edges of
the print or transparency. Select the Crop tool from
the Tools toolbar, and when the Crop Box appears,
drag it to the required dimensions and click the Apply
button. (To maintain the aspect ratio use the ‘Maintain
aspect ratio’ checkbox in the tool’s Options palette.)
Assess the damage. Enlarge the file to 400% or 500%
by
clicking
on
the
picture
with
the
Zoom
tool
(keyboard shortcut ‘Z’; left-click or push your mouse
wheel forward with your index finger to zoom in on the
affected area) and, using the Pan tool (keyboard
shortcut ‘A’ – it sits over the Zoom tool), move the
picture around the screen for a closer inspection.
Increase or decrease the magnification according to
225

the amount of detail you might want to retouch. If it’s a
high resolution scan (i.e. scanned for A2 output),
you’ll have to zoom in on the image further, say up to
400%, to see the same (scratch) detail as if it were
scanned to A4 and magnified only to 200%.
A quick way to remove dust spots blanket fashion is
to run a filter over the entire picture. Zoom to 100%
view and select the Automatic Small Scratch Removal
filter from the Adjust > Add/Remove Noise menu
(‘Adjust > Add/Remove Noise > Automatic Small
Scratch Removal’). To preview the effect check the
‘Preview on Image’ checkbox in the filter dialog box.
Most filters and effects have this option and, though it
takes a while longer to display, you get a much
clearer picture of the result than with the dialog box
thumbnail previews.
Try the default settings first. The reason there are
many
variants
is
to
cover
the
multiple
quality
situations scanning introduces. Note that there are
checkboxes for ‘light’ and ‘dark’ scratches, a contrast
inhibitor (move the sliders to the center to limit the
contrast
range),
as
well
as
three
filter
strength
settings. It’s important to remember that, with this,
and most of PaintShop Pro’s other filter-based tools,
the dialog window offers multiple options so that you
can customize all actions to suit whatever image you
have open. If the filter effect doesn’t work fully first
time, try another combination.
Scratch Removal filters apply their effects globally.
For difficult or large blemishes, use a scratch removal
tool locally first. This is a more effective technique
because you can limit the filter’s softening action to a
226

small area of the scan only. There is no point in
softening the entire picture to remove one or two
scratches.
Click the small triangle next to the Clone Brush and
choose the Scratch Remover tool from the fly-out.
Drag the cursor over the blemish to remove or soften
it. PaintShop Pro clones/blurs out the damaged
pixels. This is quite a fast tool to use and, like most of
the tools in PaintShop Pro, it has a preset save
function allowing you to create your own custom
scratch remove brushes.
Fig 4.1
Color negatives and transparencies are among the
worst
culprits
for
attracting
dirt
and
scratches.
Although they may look OK to the naked eye, the high
degree
of
scanning
enlargement
necessary
to
produce a decent-sized digital image also enlarges
the dirt. A global filter won’t do the job – you will need
to individually retouch these marks out with the
Scratch Remover and Clone tools. The same applies
for blotches caused by dust on the sensor of a digital
SLR.
227

Fig 4.2 The Salt and Pepper (top), Median (middle)
and the Edge Preserving Smooth (bottom) filters can
be used for removing dust or subtly softening skin
blemishes, but the filter strength required to remove
larger spots and scratches results in unacceptable
loss of overall image quality. The best result (right) is
achieved by repeated application of the Scratch
Removal and Clone tools.
Once satisfied that PaintShop Pro has removed/
diffused enough of the small scratches to make the
scan appear credible, save the file under another
name before continuing with further editing (always
keep the original file untouched, where possible).
Other smoothing filters to try:
228

Salt and Pepper filter.
Despeckle filter.
Median filter.
Edge Preserving Smooth filter.
(All of which are found on the ‘Adjust > Add/Remove
Noise’ menu.)
Controlling Digital Noise
Photos taken with a digital camera all suffer, to a
greater or lesser extent, from a phenomenon called
‘digital noise’, which gives digital photos a speckled,
grainy appearance. Noise is generated by a camera’s
electronic circuitry, mostly when the electrical current
generated by the image sensor is amplified before
being digitally sampled.
If you’ve owned a film camera, you’ll be familiar with
film grain – clumps of silver in a photographic
emulsion that become visible when enlarged – and
you’ll also be aware that fast films – those with higher
sensitivity to light – exhibit more grain than slow ones.
With digital cameras it’s the same story; if you set
your camera to a higher ISO rating, to capture images
in low light conditions, the digital noise becomes
worse. Depending on your camera, you may not
notice noise on images taken at an ISO setting of 200
or lower, but at settings above 400 ISO, particularly at
larger image sizes, noise can become very intrusive.
229

Fig 4.3 The Digital Noise Removal filter allows you to
remove noise from some areas of the image while
protecting others.
Fig 4.4
230

Noise-wise, this is about as bad as it gets. The
original image (left) was shot with the camera set to
1600 ISO. The center section shows the results of the
DNR filter on the default settings, and on the right, the
same settings with 70% sharpen.
Digital noise can also occur as a result of long
exposures – shots taken at night are often prone to
noise
because
of
the
high
ISO
setting
used,
combined with long exposures.
In some circumstances you can live with noise. Like
film grain it can provide a gritty atmospheric realism.
Mostly though, it’s something you’d rather do without.
You can’t get rid of noise entirely, but you can reduce
it. Before version 9, PaintShop Pro users had to rely
on techniques using the Salt and Pepper, Median,
Texture Preserving Smooth and other filters on the
Adjust > Add/Remove Noise menu. Now we have the
Digital Noise Removal filter, which, for the sake of
brevity, I’ll call the DNR filter.
Select Adjust > Digital Noise Removal, or click the
DNR button on the Photo toolbar. The DNR filter
provides a quite sophisticated dialog box with the
usual before and after preview windows and two
tabbed panels labeled Remove Noise and Protect
Image. Maximize the dialog box to get the biggest
preview possible so that you can see the noise and
what the filter is doing
to the image detail. Use the Pan tool (it appears
automatically in most of the filter dialog boxes when
you mouse over the right-hand [after] preview) to
select a representative area of the image.
231

Tip
You can save DCNR filter settings as a preset and
easily reapply them to other images taken on the
same camera with the same ISO settings.
In the Noise Correction pane, the three input boxes
and sliders control the degree of noise removal for
small, medium and large noise artifacts. Clicking the
Link Detail Sizes box locks these three together,
maintaining the relationship between them – so if you
increase one of them by, say 5, they all increase by 5.
In practice, you’ll get better results by using a higher
value in the small field than in the other two, but much
depends on the image and you’ll need to experiment.
When you apply the DNR filter it combines the
corrected image with the original one and the value in
the Correction Blend field determines the proportions
of the two. 100 is all corrected image and no original.
By lowering this value you lessen the degree to which
the correction is effective, but also minimize overall
loss of image detail. Finally, you can sharpen, which
will help restore detail softened by the noise reduction
process.
On the right of the Remove Noise tab there’s a
thumbnail preview with, initially, two cross-hair targets
on it. These are the sampling regions; they appear in
the before preview window as rectangular marquees
with resize handles. You can move and resize the
existing sampling regions (by clicking and dragging
them) and create new ones (by clicking and dragging
anywhere in the left preview window). Try to sample
image areas where noise is particularly bad, or that
232

are representative of noise in large areas of the
picture. Careful sampling will help the DNR filter to
distinguish noise from genuine image detail.
Another way to protect parts of the image from the
unwanted attention of the DNR filter is to use the
Protect Image tab, where you can select a range of
colors from within the image that you don’t want
processed by the filter.
Fig 4.5 (Left) Adding noise can transform a photo
into something quite special. Here I have drawn an
elliptical selection. (Right) The next stage is to apply a
feather to this selection to soften the edges (in this
example, by 143 pixels).
The simplest way to use this feature is to Ctrl-drag the
area you want to protect in the left preview window.
PaintShop Pro also has a filter that is ideally suited for
adding noise (Add Noise). Why add noise to a digital
photo? For several reasons.
All retouching, whether you are using a filter effect or
a specific retouching tool (like the Clone or Scratch
Remover tools), smooths out textures. This is an
233

excellent result for portraits, glamour, fashion and any
other applications where flattery pays.
But if one area of the picture has had too much
retouching, it will look smoother than the rest of the
image. Add noise to the retouched section to make it
appear more like the rest of the photo rather than
attempt to smooth
out the entire picture. You can also add noise to
increase the grittiness and overall impact in a picture
(see Fig 4.6). There are several ways to do this:
• Add noise to the retouched section using one of
the textures from the Materials palette.
• Copy the background layer, make sure that the
new layer is selected and use PaintShop Pro’s
Add Noise filter to add a suitable quantity of noise
to match the rest of the image. Then, using the
Eraser tool, rub out the bits of the top layer that
have had no retouching done to them.
• Apply noise using a selection.
234

Fig 4.6 Use Levels to brighten the center of the
picture (i.e. the bit that’s selected), then press Ctrl+D
to select none and add the grain effect to the entire
image using the Add Noise. The final stage involves
adding a blur effect using the Radial Blur filter in
Zoom mode. You can restrict the effect to the outside
of the image – keeping the center sharp either using
the filter’s Protect center controls, or by making a
selection.
235

Retouching Using the Clone Brush
The Clone Brush is possibly the most useful of all
PaintShop Pro’s retouching tools because it can be
used
for
repairing
damaged
pictures
and
for
improving photos with distracting background, or
other unwanted detail. Learn how to use this tool with
skill and it’ll open up potential you never thought
possible with your current photo-retouching skills.
There’s no big mystery to the Clone Brush. What it
does is simply to copy one part of a picture into the
clipboard or temporary memory (this is called the
‘Source’) and paste it over another part of the picture
(called the ‘Target’). You can feather the edge of the
clone brush and adjust its opacity to make your
changes blend in.
236

Fig 4.7 The Clone tool can do a lot more than
remove a few spots and scratches from old photos.
Use
it
to
remove
distracting
background
detail,
unwanted
objects
and
even
people
from
your
pictures.
Cloning in Practice
Choose the Clone Brush from the Tools toolbar
(keyboard shortcut ‘C’). This is shared with the
Scratch Remover and Object Remover tools so you
might have to click the latter’s icon and reselect
‘Clone’ from the fly-out menu. Make sure that the Tool
Options palette is also open by right-clicking on the
Menu bar and choosing ‘Tool Options’ from the
palette’s sub-menu. Pressing F4 toggles the Tool
Options palette on and off.
To make the Clone Brush work properly you must
select a Source area. First off, find a spot in the
picture that is tonally close to the tone in the section
to be replaced. There’s no point in trying to copy a
dark patch over a light patch. The light patch goes
dark with the copied pixels and ends up looking
unconvincing.
Move the brush over this area and right-click once
with the mouse. This sets the Source point and copies
the pixels that are under the brush. Move the brush to
the target section of the picture, left-click and drag to
paint. This pastes or ‘clones’ the copied pixels over
the damaged pixels. You should see the target
section disappear or, at least, reduce in intensity.
237

The Clone Brush has several options designed to
fine-tune the brush performance. These include Size,
Step,
Density,
Thickness,
Rotation,
Opacity
and
Blend mode. The most important controls to try first
are the brush Size, Hardness, its Opacity and, finally,
the Blend mode.
Tip
To
replace
larger
sections
of
an
image
with
background detail try making a feathered-edged
selection and copying and pasting it.
Setting brush size is important. If there are huge
scratches, large fade spots or ripped sections in the
picture, choose a brush size that’s smaller than the
damaged areas. Do this because building up the
repair gently is preferable to trying to do it with a
single brush stroke, and besides, there might not be
enough of the Source area to copy from. Several
smaller brush strokes always produce a smoother
finish and inevitably a more convincing result.
Change
the
brush
size
during
the
retouching
operation as well as the Source area. Many novices
copy-and-paste with such enthusiasm that they don’t
notice the tell-tale step-and-repeat tracks left across
the print surface because they have not reselected
the Source area. This is something to be avoided.
Moving the Clone Source point often is the best way
of
avoiding
these
tell-tale
marks
and
(usually)
produces a more convincing retouched result.
The Options palette also offers an Opacity setting.
This affects the brightness of the pixels copied from
238

the Source area. Effectively, this slows the retouching
process noticeably as you end up by trying to cover
damaged areas with less dense pixels (reduced
opacity). Several mouse-clicks might have to be made
to achieve the same as one set at 100% opacity.
However, it’s nearly always better to reduce the
opacity to get a smoother tonal result.
Another control to experiment with is the Blend mode.
Blend modes, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 5,
influence
the
way
copied
pixels
react
with
the
underlying, original, pixels. For example, click the
default ‘Normal’ drop-down
menu in the Options palette and try cloning using
Burn (darken), Dodge (lighten) or the Color Blend
mode.
239

Fig 4.8 The Clone tool Options palette provides a
wealth of brush presets and other settings so that you
can adapt the tool to the job in hand. Before you do
anything, create a new Raster layer to clone into,
keeping all your changes in one place and keeping
the original unmarked. Make sure to check the ‘Use
240

All Layers’ box on the Options palette so that you can
clone from one layer to another. Start with a small
brush and use lots of small strokes so that if you
make a mistake you can easily undo. Change brush
size frequently to match the area being cloned and
experiment with brush Hardness, Opacity and Blend
mode to get the best result. Here, the background
layer opacity has been reduced so you can more
clearly see the cloning on top. If you’re not happy with
your first effort, just erase the cloned sections from
the ‘cloned bits’ layer and start again.
Other tools for fixing up damaged pictures:
Scratch Remover tool (to remove blemishes locally).
Small
Scratch
Remover
tool
(to
remove
small
blemishes only).
Clarify filter (to make a picture sharper and clearer).
Fade Correction (to rejuvenate contrast and color).
Histogram Adjustment tool (to increase the contrast).
Makeover tool.
Other Tools to Try
Like many of PaintShop Pro’s tools, the Dodge and
Burn Brushes perform the digital equivalent of a
conventional
darkroom
technique.
During
print-making, areas of the paper exposed under the
enlarger are held back, or given additional exposure
using masking tools. In this way it’s possible to bring
out detail in parts of the print that would otherwise be
over- or under-exposed.
241

Fig 4.9 The Dodge and Burn tools provide, in the
form of a brush, the power to add (or subtract)
exposure to a photo. Before using any retouching
tool,
duplicate
the
background
layer
and
call
it
‘retouching’ and make all your changes to this new
layer. That way you can compare before and after
versions by toggling the layer visibility; you can also
go back to the original should things go badly wrong.
The secret to successful burning (and dodging) lies in
the Tool Options palette. Too much burning produces
these tell-tale dark smudges. Use a large, soft-edged
brush and reduce the opacity so that each brush
stroke makes only a small difference. Then gradually
build up the effect using multiple strokes. Just press
Ctrl+Z to undo if something doesn’t look right.
The Dodge and Burn Brushes do exactly the same
thing. Dodge lightens the pixels to which it’s applied
and the Burn Brush darkens them – the equivalent of
242

giving more exposure under the enlarger. You need
to be careful not to overdo it with these tools, or your
intervention will become obvious.
Fig 4.10
This is what the Burn tool can do for a photo –
completely transform an image that would have
otherwise perhaps found its way to the trash bin, but
is now something worth showing to others.
With each application of the tool the effect becomes
more obvious. It’s a good idea to duplicate the
background layer before using the Dodge and Burn
Brushes and apply the changes to the copy. Use
large,
soft-edged
brushes
and
reduced
opacity
settings to avoid burning hard-edged holes. You can
use the left and right buttons to switch between
243

Dodge and Burn, but I wouldn’t recommend this; if
you’ve over-burned an area, undo, or use the History
palette to get back the detail.
Creating Black and White Pictures
Despite the fact that digital photography makes it no
more difficult or expensive to shoot in color than black
and
white,
monochrome
images
are
proving
as
popular as ever. For some subjects removing the
color altogether produces an aesthetically desirable
result and digital image processing makes it easier
than ever to produce toning effects like sepia, split
toning and cross-processing that, in the days of
chemical processing, were messy, time-consuming
and often produced hit and miss results.
Tip
The Channel mixer produces the same effect as
yellow, red, or other colored filters on the camera
with black and white film; use it to create dramatic
skies and other effects.
One of the simplest ways to produce black and white
photos is to set your camera to Black and White mode
but, other than in exceptional circumstances, I’d
advise against this. Shooting color in the camera and
converting the images to black and white, as we shall
see, gives you a much greater degree of control over
the
process
and
provides
many
more
creative
opportunities. It also gives you the option of keeping
the color photo as well.
244

Fig 4.11
Converting a photo to greyscale using Image >
Greyscale removes the color data which results in a
smaller
file
size,
but
is
irreversible.
Use
Hue/
Saturation/Lightness to convert to black and white,
but
retain
the
color
data
should
you
want
to
reintroduce color to the image later.
PaintShop
Pro
X6
provides
several
methods
of
converting color images to black and white ones.
These are:
Image > Greyscale. This converts the image to an
8-bit single-channel greyscale image and discards the
color information. Once the image is saved in this
mode there’s no getting the color data back, so if you
want to keep the color image, make sure to keep a
back-up copy and choose File > Save As so you do
not overwrite your original.
Adjust
>
Hue
and
Saturation
>
Hue/Saturation/
Lightness. By dragging the Saturation slider all the
way to zero in the Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog
245

box, you can completely desaturate the image. The
difference between doing this and converting to
greyscale is that, although you can no longer see it,
the color information is still there. You can go back to
Hue/Saturation/Lightness at any time and put the
color back by dragging the slider in the opposite
direction. You can also introduce new color in ways
we’ll look at shortly.
Effects > Photo Effect > Black and White Film. This
filter can convert your photos to black and white and
at the same time simulate colored filters placed over
the lens to help differentiate color with similar grey
tonal values. For example, when shooting black and
white landscapes a yellow filter is commonly used to
darken blue skies and help pick out cloud detail. Like
Hue/Saturation/Lightness, using the Black and White
Film effect retains the color channels in the file so you
can
add
new
color
effects,
but
the
effect
isn’t
reversible – you can’t get the original colors back
once the file is saved.
Adjust > Color > Channel mixer. The Channel mixer
works in a similar way to the Black and White Film
effect, only it provides a lot more control. Whereas the
Black and White Film effects are confined to a limited
number of filters – Red, Green, Yellow, Orange and
Blue – using the Channel mixer
to combine the data from the red, green and blue
channels you can produce a widely variable range of
tonal effects.
246

Fig 4.12 You can simulate the action of colored filters
on black and white film using Black and White Film
photo effects. Colored filters used in this way lighten
the tone of same-colored objects and darken those
with
complementary
colors.
On
this
image,
red
247

lightens
the
red
discs
and
darkens
the
blue
background. Because of its proximity to yellow and
orange, red also lightens the yellow and orange discs
to a degree, but yellow and orange have a greater
effect on their respective colors in the image. Blue
has the reverse effect, lightening the blue background
and darkening the discs. You can save commonly
used filters like yellow, orange and red as presets.
Bottom: You can also use the Photo Effects Sepia
filter to apply a quick sepia tone to an image, but the
Colorize
option
on
the
Hue/Saturation/Lightness
dialog box provides more scope for color tinting of
black and white photos.
Tinting Black and White Photos
In the last section I described ways to use PaintShop
Pro to convert a color picture to black and white. Now
we’ll take a look at how to color-tint a black and white
photo. Why color-tint? Most black and white pictures
reproduce only a limited tonal range: 256 tones to be
exact. The addition of color, albeit in subtle amounts,
produces a print apparently much richer in tonal
scale.
This process is sometimes called a ‘duotone’. Adding
two colors to a black and white photo in the same
fashion is called a ‘tritone’ and adding a third color
makes this a ‘quadtone’.
How It’s Done
Aside from using Effects > Photo Effects > Sepia
Toning which, as we’ve seen, limits you to fairly crude
applications of a single color, the simplest way to tone
248

a black and white photo is using White Balance.
Remember, you can only produce color effects like
this (or in fact carry out any color editing, such as
adding colored text) on an image that, though it may
appear black and white, is an RGB color file. So, if
you’re starting with a full color image, desaturate it, as
explained on the previous page. If it’s a greyscale
image convert it to an RGB one by selecting Image >
Increase Color Depth > RGB – 8 bits/channel. Now
open the White Balance dialog box by selecting
Adjust > White Balance and uncheck the Advanced
Options box to turn off the advanced controls if they
are displayed. Now all you have to do is drag the
slider to the right or left to make the image warmer or
cooler. Warmer adds red and yellow to the image and
Cooler adds blue. The further you drag the slider the
more color is added. To add other colors to the
image, check the Advanced Options box and use the
More Purple/More Green slider.
Tip
Color Balance and Hue/Saturation/Lightness are
best applied as Adjustment layers, so that changes
remain
editable
and
can
be
removed
later
if
required. (See Chapter 5.)
You can add a wider range of tints to a photo using
Adjust > Hue and Saturation > Colorize. This is
actually pretty simple to use. First select a color using
the Hue box on the left – the colors won’t mean much
to you so click the down arrow to display a color
picker. Next, adjust the strength of the tint using the
Saturation slider.
249

Tip
For an interesting effect use a Hue/Saturation/
Lightness Adjustment layer in Colorize mode to
apply a tint, then reduce the layer opacity to blend it
with the original color.
Again, if you click the down arrow you can work with a
visual tint gradient rather than a number.
You can also use the Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog
box
with
the
Colorize
box
checked
to
tint
a
monochrome photo. This works in pretty much the
same way as the colorize method, using the Hue and
Saturation sliders to set the tint color and strength.
The Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog box (as its name
implies) also provides a Lightness slider.
Fig 4.13
Use the White Balance dialog box to add a tint to
previously desaturated images.
250

Fig 4.14 For the ultimate in tinting control the Hue/
Saturation/Lightness dialog box is hard to beat.
Control the tint color with the Hue slider and strength
using the Saturation slider. You can also adjust image
brightness
using
the
Lightness
slider,
though
adjustments of this kind are usually best left to Levels.
251

Fig 4.15
The Colorize command provides the best balance
between control and ease of use. Just select your tint
color using the Hue color picker, then adjust the
strength using the Saturation slider.
Whenever you’re tinting images in this way it’s a good
idea to use an Adjustment layer, rather than applying
color
changes
directly
to
the
image.
Using
an
Adjustment
layer
will
allow
you
to
easily
make
changes to the tint at a later stage in the editing
process – for example, if you add some text and
decide that a different colored tint would work better.
You can even remove the tint altogether if you decide
against it.
Adjustment layers also provide additional control over
the effect. You can reduce the strength of the effect
and blend it with the original using layer opacity and
Blend modes. See Chapter 5 for more about how you
can
use
Adjustment
layers
to
edit
images
non-destructively.
Creating Color Overlay Effects
In the earlier editions of this book I devoted these
pages to a technique that involved using the Color
Balance tool to apply a multi-tone effect, using
different colors for the image shadows, highlights and
midtones. While PaintShop Pro’s White Balance tool
is now easier to use, it no longer lets you apply color
changes individually to the highlight, midtone and
shadow regions of a photo. But we’re not going to let
that get in the way of a good technique! Here’s how to
achieve the same effect using a layer property called
252

Blend Range, which masks parts of a layer that fall
within a tonal range that you specify.
Tip
Like Adjustment layers, the changes you make
using Blend Ranges aren’t permanent and you can
go back and edit them at any stage. Try combining
Blend
Ranges
with
Blend
modes
to
produce
interesting graphic effects.
Open the image you want to tint and duplicate the
background layer twice by selecting it in the Layers
palette, right-clicking it and selecting Duplicate from
the context menu. Rename the new layers after the
color you intend to use for the tints; here I’ve called
them red and blue. Tint the layers using the colorize
technique described on page 124.
Double-click the top ‘blue’ layer in the Layers palette
to open the Layer Properties dialog box and click the
Blend Ranges tab. If it isn’t already selected, choose
Grey Channel from the Blend Channel pull-down
menu and take a look at the two graduated bars
underneath it. You can use these bars to control how
pixels in the two layers are displayed. The top bar,
labeled ‘This layer’ can be used to hide pixels on the
upper (blue) layer using the four triangle-shaped
buttons. Drag the buttons on the left to hide pixels in
the shadows and those on the right to hide highlight
pixels. By dragging the top and bottom triangles to
different positions you can create a smooth transition
between the layers, rather than have the color change
abruptly.
253

The bottom slider essentially does the same thing in a
different way. Think of it as forcing pixels on the layer
below (in this case the blue layer) to show through the
top (red) one. I find it keeps things simpler to ignore
the Underlying Layer controls and just use the
controls for the upper layer to choose which parts of
the tonal range I want to appear in that color.
Using the Warp Tools
PaintShop Pro has several powerful brush tools that
can be used to radically bend and distort the pixels in
a photo. These are the Warp Brushes.
Why use a Warp Brush?
• To create zany, surreal pictorial effects.
• To increase eye size in a portrait (i.e. to enlarge a
model’s pupils for that wide-eyed look; it can also
be used for reducing the size of other unsightly
body parts like noses, if it’s important).
• Straighten facial detail (i.e. a broken nose).
• To entertain your kids.
The Warp Brush works just like any other brush in
PaintShop Pro in so far that you can run it over the
picture and it applies a direct change. In this situation
you have massive influence over how the pixels bend
and warp under the brush. Some computing power is
needed to make this work swiftly.
There are eight warp modes which can be combined
or
used
individually.
Brush
effects
are
‘Push’,
‘Expand’, ‘Contract’, ‘Right Twirl’, ‘Left Twirl’, ‘Noise’,
‘Iron Out’ and Unwarp.
254

If you don’t like what this brush does, click the
‘Cancel’ tab. Other options include ‘Brush Size’,
‘Hardness’, ‘Strength’, ‘Step’ and ‘Noise’. When you
have finished the warping process, click the OK check
mark to render the warping action. Warping can place
heavy demands on your CPU, so if
You are working on a older PC, set Coarse Draft
quality in the Tool Options palette. This doesn’t affect
the final result, so for best quality results, you should
check the Best quality box, regardless of the Draft
quality setting.
255

Fig 4.16 Use Blend Ranges to confine color tints to
parts of the image like the highlights or shadows. (1)
Confining the top blue layer to the highlights creates a
hard-edged transition between red sea/land and blue
sky. (2) Soften the transition by creating a ‘ramp’
allowing the red to bleed into the sky and vice versa.
(3) You can use this technique on high-contrast
images to produce two-color posterization effects.
256

Fig 4.17 The Warp brush is perfect for making
domestic pets look absurdly funny.
Scripting
Scripting
is
a
powerful
PaintShop
Pro
feature
introduced
back
in
version
8.
It
allows
you
to
automatically combine several editing steps and apply
them to another image. Say, for example, you have a
whole folder of images and you want to do the same
thing to each of them – open them, resize them,
257

unsharp mask them, add a frame and save them.
That’s the kind of repetitive work that scripting was
designed for. (PaintShop Pro’s One Step Photo Fix is
a script.)
Scripts are easy to create. The Scripting toolbar
works a little like a VCR, with a record button that
when pressed keeps track of everything you do and
produces a script so that the same process can be
applied with a single click to any other image. There’s
also a selection of pre-supplied scripts, including
‘Border with drop shadow’, ‘Black and white sketch’,
‘EXIF
captioning’,
‘Photo
edges’,
‘Sepia
frame’,
‘Simple caption’, ‘Vignette’ and ‘Watercolor’.
You can add scripts as buttons to toolbars, which
makes them even easier to apply. Right-click on the
toolbar and select Customize from the contextual
menu, click the Scripts tab in the Customize dialog
box and select the script you want to add from the
pull-down menu. Choose an icon, click the Bind
button and the Script button will appear in the Bound
Scripts pane. Next, drag this icon from the Bound
Scripts pane onto the Scripts toolbar. Now all you
have to do to apply the script to any image is click the
button.
Pre-written scripts are all very well, but what if you
want a script to handle a repetitive task that doesn’t
appear on the Scripts toolbar drop-down list? Well,
you can record your own, but you can also edit the
existing scripts. PaintShop Pro’s scripts are written in
a scripting language called ‘Python’. You don’t need
any
special
scripting
knowledge
to
edit
existing
scripts, but if you’re interested in finding out more
258

about Python take a look at http://wiki.python.org/
moin/BeginnersGuide.
Fig 4.18 At a basic level, scripting allows users to run
a pre-recorded action over an image (or images) in
order to produce a quick – and predictable – result Or
you can record your own script and save it for use
another time.
To edit a script click the Edit Script button on the
Script toolbar. Some of the PaintShop Pro scripts
provide editing tips. For example, the Thumbnail 150
script begins:
# if you want thumbnails generated at a different size
just change this to the desired value.
MaxThumbnailSize = 150
The # symbol at the beginning of the first line denotes
a comment – what follows is ignored by the script
interpreter – but its meaning is clear enough to
anyone else.
PaintShop Pro X6 has an even easier way of creating
scripts – called ‘Quickscripts’ – using the History
palette. The History palette automatically records
259

everything you do in PaintShop Pro. You can use the
History
palette
as
a
super-undo
feature.
While
selecting Undo from the Edit menu (or pressing
Ctrl+Z) will take you back through recent editing in
linear steps,
the History palette can be used to selectively undo.
You can, for example, undo the Lens Distortion filter
effect you applied 10 minutes ago, but keep the
cropping, Red-eye Removal and Automatic Color
Balance subsequently applied.
To create a Quickscript select the steps you want to
use
by
Shift-clicking
(Ctrl-click
to
select
non-contiguous steps) them in the History palette and
click the Save Quickscript button. To apply the
Quickscript
to
the
current
image
click
the
Run
Quickscript button. What could be simpler?
Fig 4.19 Use the Script toolbar (left) to select and
apply scripts to the current image. You can create
Quickscripts
from
the
History
palette
(center).
Combining scripts with Batch Processing (right) is the
route to major effort-saving automation.
260

Clearly, scripts can save you a lot of legwork if you
need to apply the same editing sequence to a large
number of images. But you still have to open the
image and click the button. It may not sound like hard
work, but if you have to do it 300 times, or every time
you download a batch of pictures from your digital
camera, you’d be forgiven for considering it quite a
chore. This is where Batch Processing comes in.
Batch Processing can automatically apply editing
commands to an entire folder of images. Combine
Batch Processing with Scripting and you have some
real image-editing power at your fingertips.
PaintShop Pro’s Batch Processing feature grew out of
a Batch Convert feature designed to allow you to
convert a bunch of files from one format to another. It
was extended to allow you to apply scripts and there’s
also a useful Batch Rename feature which you can
use to change the anonymous file names of digital
camera images to something more meaningful.
To open the Batch Process dialog box select File >
Batch Process. Click the Browse button, navigate to
the folder of images you want to process and click the
Select All button. Before you do this make sure to
back up the originals somewhere safe and work on a
copy of the images so that, if something unexpected
happens, you still have the originals to fall back on.
Check the Use Script box, select a script from the
pull-down menu and check the Copy Radio button.
This will save a copy of the processed image into the
folder you specify in the Save Options pane. Click the
Browse
button
and
create
a
new
folder
called
something like ‘processed files’ on your hard disk.
261

The Save Mode pane provides other saving options. If
you have included a Save As command in your script,
check the Obey Script Radio button to use this rather
than the Batch Process save instructions. If you check
the Silent Mode box, Batch Process will run the
selected script and apply the settings you used when
you recorded it. If you leave the Silent Mode box
unchecked, a dialog box will open at relevant points in
the script for each processed image, requiring you to
enter values.
When you’re sure everything is correctly set, click the
Start button, sit back and watch while PaintShop Pro
does the hard work for you.
262

Step-by-Step Projects
Restoring Damaged Photos
Once you’ve mastered the retouching techniques
demonstrated in this chapter and elsewhere in the
book you’ll be able to make improvements to digital
photos that aren’t quite ‘right’ as well as scanned
pictures in need of restoration. With skilled use of the
Clone Brush in combination with the other retouching
tools there’s little you won’t be able to fix. This
step-by-step project shows how to restore an old
photo that’s suffered quite bad damage, in this case
more due to lack of care than the ageing process.
Don’t be put off attempting to restore old photos
because they look past saving. Even very severe
damage, such as tears, staining, fading and folds, can
be reduced or eliminated altogether with the repeated
application of the simple techniques shown here. And
if your first efforts don’t meet with much success,
keep trying; retouching is one of those things that
improves with practice.
Tip
A
pressure-sensitive
stylus
and
tablet
makes
retouching much easier. Use the Brush Variance
palette to determine how the brush responds to
stylus pressure. When you press harder, the brush
can get bigger, or change opacity or thickness.
263

STEP 1 This photo is about 40 years old. It hasn’t
aged too badly, but it has a couple of serious fold
marks, one running upwards from the dog’s ear and
another running vertically through the middle, as well
as a nasty stain from a coffee cup. Overall the picture
has accumulated some dirt and grubbiness, most
noticeably in the white border area.
STEP 2 Even if the original is black and white, scan it
as an RGB color image. The additional channels in an
RGB image can bring out (or cover up) detail which
will help in the retouching process. Scan at a high
resolution so you can zoom in and work on small
details; you can always downsample the photo later
for printing or web use.
264

Step 3 Crop the picture to get rid of that grubby
border. Depending on the shot, you can save yourself
a great deal of work by cropping close and removing
a lot of material that you might otherwise have to
retouch, but here we want to keep everything other
than the border.
265

STEP 4 From the Image menu select Split Channel >
Split to RGB to separate the photo into its constituent
red, green and blue channels. Select Tile Horizontally
from the Window menu to compare the channels.
Notice how the coffee stain isn’t nearly so obvious on
the red channel. This is the one we’ll use for our
retouching. Close the original scan and the green and
blue channels and resave the red channel.
266

STEP 5 Click the New Raster layer button at the top
of the Layers palette to create a new layer; call it
‘retouching’. First we’ll deal with the coffee stain.
Sometimes it’s easier to deal with big problems like
this using copy and paste rather than the Clone
Brush. Use the rectangular marquee with a feather
setting of one and select an area just above the stain.
It’s a lucky coincidence that this selection is exactly
the same, bar the stain, as the area below it, but
you’d be surprised how often this happens.
267

STEP 6 Select Copy Merged from the Edit > Copy
Special menu followed by Paste As New Selection
and position the pasted selection over the coffee
stain, taking care to match the horizontal line of the
wood cladding. Press Ctrl+Shift+F to defloat the
selection. Repeat the process with different selections
to cover as much of the stain as possible. Press
Ctrl-D or choose Select None from the Selections
menu.
268

STEP 7 Select the Clone Brush and set the size big
enough to cover the width of the fold in one hit. Set
the hardness to around 50 and make sure that
Aligned mode and ‘Use all layers’ are both checked.
Right-click with the brush just to one side of the fold to
set the sampling point, then move onto the fold and
left-click to clone. If your cloning isn’t seamless try
again from a slightly different start point. You’ll need
to experiment with the brush size, opacity and blend
mode; you’ll get better results using many short
strokes, rather than one long one, and you’ll also
need to frequently reset the source point.
269

STEP 8 Continue with the Clone Brush down the
length of the fold. Usually best results are achieved by
270

sampling close to the area to be cloned as you will get
a better match. Sometimes this will be to the left of
the
damaged
area,
sometimes
to
the
right.
Occasionally
you
may
find
there
is
no
suitable
material close by and you’ll need to sample from a
more remote location with similar detail. After cloning
out the two fold lines I’ve gone back and removed the
traces of the coffee stain from the area below the
fence using the Clone tool. Picking the green channel,
where the mark was least visible, meant that very little
work was needed to remove the remaining traces.
Finally I’ve added a nice clean white border.
Hand-Coloring Black and White Photos
In the days before color photography, a commonly
used technique was to add color to black and white
prints using inks and a small retouching brush. The
aim of this process wasn’t to create an exact facsimile
of a scene in full color, but rather to add a little color
detail to heighten the realism and add a little life to
what otherwise may have appeared a little drab and
austere.
If you’ve ever seen a hand-colored black and white
print you’ll know just how charming they can be.
Using PaintShop Pro you can recreate this effect
either to add a new dimension to archive family
photos, or to produce an interesting new take on more
recent digital images.
271

STEP 1 If you’re starting off with a scanned black and
white photo in greyscale mode you’ll need to convert
it to RGB by selecting Image > increase color depth >
RGB – 8 bits/channel. If it’s a color image, desaturate
it using Hue/Saturation/Lightness as described earlier
in the chapter.
272

STEP 2 You’ll get a more realistic result using a
limited color palette. Using the Materials palette in
Swatch mode, create up to six colors. Depending on
the image you might, for example, choose a skin
color, red to add color to lips and cheeks, one or two
colors for items of clothing and another one or two
swatches for other detail such as sky, a car or, as in
this case, a pedalo. You might also find it helpful to
name the swatches appropriately, for example, ‘skin
tones’.
Tip
You’ll find it much easier to hand-color and carry out
other retouching tasks using a pressure-sensitive
tablet and stylus. It’s much more natural to paint
with a stylus than with a mouse, and PaintShop
Pro’s Brush tools respond to pressure – the harder
you press, the more paint is deposited. Some styli
even have an eraser on the end, so you can flip
them over and rub out!
STEP 3 Select the Paint Brush and choose one of
your color swatches. Use the Tool Options palette to
set
the
brush
size,
shape,
hardness
and
other
parameters. To a degree these will depend on the
detail you are coloring, but generally, you’ll find that
soft-edged brushes with reduced opacity give good
results. You might also try the Airbrush.
273

STEP 4 Create a new raster layer on which to add the
color. There are two reasons for this. First, it’s always
a good idea to keep any retouching on a separate
layer as it leaves the original untouched on the
background layer and if things go drastically wrong
you can always delete the retouching layer and start
again. Second, it gives you a lot more control over
your editing. You can change the opacity to fade the
retouching
and
make
it
less
obvious
and
use
PaintShop Pro’s Blend modes to produce a more
natural look.
274

STEP 5 Making sure the new layer is selected, start
to paint over the background image. At this stage the
paint will go on thickly and may even completely
obliterate the detail below, producing a crude and
ugly result. Don’t worry! Once you’ve applied a few
strokes to a small area of the picture, stop painting.
Tip
When you change the Layer Blend mode to Color
(Legacy), the paint that you’ve applied with the
Brush tool adopts the tonal characteristics of the
underlying (grey) pixels. Dark pixels pick up darker
color and vice versa. It pays to be realistic in your
choice of colors. If your subject is wearing a dark
shirt, you won’t be able to paint it light blue. If colors
don’t come out as expected, try using the Hue/
Saturation/Lightness controls to change the color of
275

the paint layer – another good reason for keeping
each color tint on a separate layer.
STEP 6 In the Layers palette change the Blend mode
from Normal to Color (Legacy). Now, your brush
strokes apply color to the image, but maintain the
original tone, producing a more natural effect. As well
as retaining the underlying detail, you’ll notice that the
color varies from your original swatch, depending on
how light or dark the underlying pixels are.
276

STEP 7 When you’ve finished painting all of the
image detail in one of your palette colors, for example
all the skin tones, create another new layer and
continue painting in the next color. You could put all
your colors onto one layer, but using a different layer
for each color gives you more control over the
finished result. Suppose, when you are nearing
completion, everything looks OK, but the skin tones
look a bit over the top, like everyone’s had a bit too
much sun. By reducing the opacity of the skin tones
layer you can correct this problem without affecting
the other colors.
277

STEP 8 The great thing about hand-coloring is you
don’t have to be a great artist or even incredibly
278

accurate, as this screen of all the paint layers at 100%
opacity in Normal mode shows!
The final result.
Creating a Dramatic Tone Effect
If you’ve bought a new camera recently it more than
likely has a shooting mode that applies effects filters.
These have become increasingly popular and these
days you find them not just on point-and-shoot
compacts, but on more advanced cameras as well.
When I first tried an Olympus PEN Micro four thirds
compact system camera, I was really impressed with
its Art filter effects and in particular with the Dramatic
tone effect which made otherwise quite banal and
forgettable shots look, well, a lot more dramatic!
279

Here’s an example showing the effect alongside the
‘straight’ shot without the effect applied.
Dramatic
tone
was
clearly
popular
with
other
photographers, as it, or something like it, soon started
to appear on models from other manufacturers. Here
it turns a fairly ordinary shot of a moped into
something much more graphic. If you don’t have a
camera with effects filters, you can’t take advantage
of the Dramatic Tone filter, or can you? How hard can
this effect be to create in PaintShop Pro I thought.
The answer? Pretty easy as it happens. The Dramatic
Tone art filter looks like it applies a local contrast
enhancement in combination with some kind of faux
HDR effect. It turns out you can get a remarkably
similar effect to the Olympus one using a Local Tone
Mapping adjustment in PaintShop Pro X6.
STEP 1 To apply the Local Tone mapping adjustment
as an adjustment layer open your image and, with the
280

background layer selected, click the New Adjustment
Layer button on the Layers palette and select Local
Tone Mapping.
STEP 2 Maximize the dialog box, uncheck Preview on
image, click the Fit to window button to get decent
sized before and after thumbnails and select the
Adjustment tab. You really have to ladle it on with this
adjustment to get close to the Dramatic Tone look of
the Olympus filter. The strength needs to be around
50–60, but keep the block size small, here I’ve used
281

the minimum setting of 8. When you’re done, click the
OK button.
282

STEP 3 We’re almost there, it’s that simple, but
there’s a couple of things still to do to get this result
even closer to the genuine Olympus one. I want to
exaggerate the contrast a little more. Do this using a
Curves adjustment layer. Here, I’ve made the curve
S-shaped to increase the contrast without losing too
much detail in the shadows or highlights.
283

STEP 4 The curves adjustment has resulted in some
heavily saturated colors which are at odds with the
slightly desaturated look of the Olympus Dramatic
tone filter, so the final adjustment, once again applied
as an adjustment layer, is a Hue/Saturation/Lightness
adjustment. I’ve reduced the saturation to around −50
to match the look of the Olympus filter.
284

So here’s the comparison. On the left, the original
Dramatic Tone art filter applied in-camera on the
Olympus E-P3 and on the right my attempt to create
the same effect on the ‘straight’ version in PaintShop
Pro X6. It’s pretty close, but although I was trying to
replicate an existing effect, there’s nothing to stop you
experimenting. If you like this effect, but you don’t
own an Olympus it’s a good alternative and it doesn’t
take a lot of work to produce.
285

Chapter 5
Using Selections
Controlling Change
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• This is a short chapter, but it covers crucial
techniques that will take your photo editing skills
way beyond what we’ve covered up to now. This
chapter is all about selections and how to make
them. Selections and their close relatives mask
layers and alpha channels, allow you to confine
changes to a part of the image – a bit like using a
stencil.
• PaintShop Pro X6 has more than 20 selection
tools, ranging from easy to use tools that do
nearly all of the work for you to more hands-on
tools that require a little more skill and input, but
are useful for difficult subjects. PaintShop Pro X6
introduces two new selection tools that make
grabbing parts of an image easier than ever. The
287

new Smart Selection Brush allows you to paint
the element you want to select and has an
uncanny knack for knowing where the edges are.
Likewise, the Auto Selection tool starts with a
rectangular
selection
but
shrink
wraps
the
selection marquee to precisely fit the edges of the
object you want.
• Beyond that are the Geometric selection tools,
the Freehand Selection tool and the Magic Wand
as well as specialist tools like the Object Extractor
and
Background
Eraser.
The
keys
to
successful
selection are knowing which tool to use for
particular selection tasks, how to set the tool
options so that you get exactly what you want –
nothing more and nothing less – and, if you don’t
get quite what you want, how to add to and
subtract from existing selections.
• The selection tools can take you only so far. For
one thing, they’re not permanent so if you want to
close your photo and come back to work on it
later, you’ll need to save your selection, this is
where alpha channels and mask layers come in.
As
well
allowing
you
to
make
selections
permanent, alpha channels and mask layers can
be worked on with PaintShop Pro’s brush tools.
Masks produced in this way can show or hide
anything
in
your
photos,
even
things
with
indistinct edges, like fur, hair, clouds and water.
Once the mask is made you can use it as the
basis for selectively applying filters, making tonal
and color changes or anything else. This chapter
introduces alpha channels and mask layers, in
288

Chapter 6; you’ll learn some more advanced
masking techniques using layers.
• The step-by-step project at the end of the chapter
shows you how to use some of the techniques
you’ll learn here to replace a dull sky with
something more dramatic.
Understanding Selections: Adding Creative Power
PaintShop Pro has several tools that allow the
isolation of specific areas within the picture based on
certain
selection
criteria
such
as
color,
tonality,
contrast or simply by drawing around it. You have to
distinguish the best selection tool, or tools, to use for
the picture in question. For example, sometimes it’s
possible with one mouse-click to get a good, clean
selection around an object. Sometimes it is not so
easy because the photo might be multi-colored or
irregular in tone. In this case you’d use a combination
of selection tools to successfully ‘grab’ the object
cleanly. PaintShop Pro also has a number of tools
that you can use to clean up these selections once
started. These are called Selection Modification tools.
Tip
As with many other aspects of photo editing, making
selections, particularly with the Freehand Selection
tool is much easier with a graphics tablet and stylus
than with a mouse.
There’s no point in making a job more difficult than it
needs to be, so the approach with selections is to try
the quickest and simplest tools first, if they don’t get
the results you need you can move on and try
289

something different. After a while you’ll develop a
knack for knowing what’s straightforward and what
isn’t from a selection standpoint. Likewise, in this
chapter we’ll first look at the quick and easy selection
tools and graduate on to the more complex ones.
PaintShop
Pro’s
Selection
tools
can
be
broadly
categorized as follows:
• The easiest to use tools are the new Smart
Selection Brush and Auto Selection tools.
• Next up is the Magic Wand tool. This finds pixels
either of a similar contrast, color, brightness or
opacity within the picture.
• The Freehand Selection tool has edge-seeking
(‘magnetic’),
point-to-point
(polygonal
line),
smart-edge (linear ‘magnetic’) or just freehand
characteristics.
• The
Geometric
Marquee
selection
comes
in
rectangular, square, circular, star, triangular and
ten other preset shapes.
• Finally, the Object Extractor, Background Eraser
and Smart Carver are specialist tools for cutting
out and removing elements form an image.
Bear in mind that the ToolOptions palette has more
refining controls for some of the tools mentioned.
Controls include a Tolerance level, Blend mode,
Anti-aliasing,
Smoothing,
Feathering
and
Match
mode.
The Smart Selection Brush and Auto Selection Tool
Faced with the task of making a selection, the first
tool you should reach for is PaintShop Pro X6’s new
Smart Selection Brush. It makes little difference if
290

you’re an old hand or a newbie, the Smart Selection
Brush really is aptly named and can save you a lot of
painstaking manual work. In fact it’s so smart and at
the same time so easy to use, it requires very little
explanation.
The Smart Selection Brush (Fig 5.1) is on the
selection tool fly-out of the Tools toolbar; to select it
click the triangle next to the current selection tool and
choose it from the fly-out – it’s the fourth one down
and its icon is a wand with a green star at the tip.
Take a look at the Tool options palette to get an idea
of how you can modify the brush, there are options for
size and feather and a mode pull-down. The default
mode is Add which means that each time you use the
brush it adds to an existing selection to make it
bigger.
291

Fig 5.1 The Smart Selection Brush is on the selection
tools fly-out of the Tools toolbar
On the right of the Tool options palette you’ll see a
checkbox labelled Smart Edge, (Fig 5.2) make sure
it’s checked then click and drag with the brush on a
part of your image that you want to select. Notice how
the selection isn’t confined to where you paint, but
292

extends right up to edges of the thing you’re trying to
select?
That’s
the
Smart
bit,
PaintShop
Pro
automatically detects the edge of the element your
painting and fits the selection to it. If you haven’t got
the whole thing with your first brush stroke just
continue painting, with each brush stroke the Smart
Edge continues to do its work, adding to the selection
on the basis of the area you paint. Eventually you
should be able to get the entire element selected in
this way.
Fig 5.2 Make sure that Smart Edge is checked in the
tool options palette (and Use all layers if you’re
working on a multi-layered image and what you want
to select spans more than one layer).
Fig 5.3
293

You should be able to get a fairly close fit first time.
Use two modifier keys (Ctrl and Shift) to remove and
add to the selection as needed and don’t forget to
zoom in and alter the brush size for more control.
Depending on the boundary between the element you
want
to
select
and
the
background,
the
Smart
Selection Brush may have more or less success in
making an accurate selection. If it’s picked up bits of
the background in addition to what you wanted, just
change the mode from Add to Remove in the Tool
options palette and paint out the unwanted bits. As
before, as long as you have Smart Edge checked, the
bits you paint out of the selection automatically
expand up to the boundary between the element and
the background. For smaller detail you’ll find it helps
to reduce the size of the brush and zoom in. You can
also switch from add to remove by holding down the
Ctrl key.
The Auto Selection tool is even simpler to use than
the Smart Selection Brush. Its the last tool on the
selection tool fly-out, below the Smart Selection
Brush. Once selected, drag a rectangle around the
element you want to select and the Auto Selection
tool works the same trick as the Smart Selection
Brush, locating the edges within the rectangle and
creating a selection around them.
One of the nice things about the Auto Selection tool is
there’s very little for you to do other than draw a box
around the thing you want to select. That’s it. Of
course if it doesn’t yield the desired results there’s not
much you can do other than try something else. But
don’t be tempted to rely on just one
294

tool to get the job done. If the Auto Selection tool
picks up too much, or not enough of what you were
trying to select, switch to the Smart Selection Brush
and finish the job by adding to, or removing from the
original selection. If that still doesn’t work it’s time for
the next tool in PaintShop Pro’s selection armory, the
Magic Wand tool.
Fig 5.4 To use the Auto Selection tool just select it
and drag a rectangle around the thing you want.
That’s all there is to it.
295

The Magic Wand Tool
The Smart Selection and Auto Selection tools are
quick and easy, but they don’t work for every subject.
In this case, the Magic Wand tool may be what you
need.
This
is
the
most
versatile
selection
tool
available to you and can capture just about any
selection you ask of it. The key to success with the
Magic Wand tool lies in correctly setting the options
and this often involves some trial and error. With a
little experience, however, it will become second
nature to you and take very little time. Certainly a lot
less time than having to make the same selection
manually.
Select the Magic Wand tool from the selection tool
fly-out on the toolbar (it’s above the Smart Selection
Brush and is also a wand, this time with a yellow
spark at its tip) and click inside an image on an area
of fairly similar color and tone. The resulting selection
marquee may cover a little of the image or a lot of it,
and it may be one big selection or there could be
smaller islands of selected image dotted about – it all
depends on the image.
Tip
Feathering is measured in pixels. If you feather a
selection by 10 pixels on a low-resolution image, it
will
have
a
much
bigger
effect
than
on
a
high-resolution one.
What the Magic Wand does is select pixels of similar
values, within a range that you specify, throughout the
image. As a starting point the Magic Wand tool uses
296

the pixel that you click on. It then selects all the pixels
with an RGB value within the range specified by the
value in the Tolerance field of the Tool Options
palette; the larger the tolerance, the more pixels will
be selected. If what you’re trying to select is a very
specific color, a red door for example, you can use a
low tolerance setting to select all of it. If it contains a
wider range of colors, like a sky or the leaves on a
tree, you might need to increase the tolerance to
capture all of the hues.
Fig 5.5 Successful use of the Magic Wand tool
depends on making good tool options choices and
adopting appropriate techniques. In this case it’s
easier
to
select
the
background
and
invert
the
selection
to
capture
the
subject.
Rather
than
increasing
the
tolerance
in
an
attempt
to
get
everything in one bite, which will most likely just
297

capture unwanted areas of the image, use a smaller
tolerance setting and Shift-click to add to the original
selection.
Sometimes,
increasing
the
tolerance
means
you
capture pixels you don’t want, which happen to have
similar values to those you do. If this happens you
need to try a different tack. One method is to
Shift-click to add to the existing selection. If you get
an unsatisfactory result press Ctrl+Z, rather than
trying to subtract from the selection by Ctrl-clicking
with the Magic Wand
tool.
Alternatively,
it’s
often
easier
to
select
a
background with the Magic Wand tool then invert the
selection (Selections>Invert or press Ctrl+Shift+I) to
capture the subject.
Tip
The results of a Magic Wand tool selection depend
on the precise pixel you click on. Even in what looks
like an area of flat color pixel values vary, so if your
first attempt isn’t successful, press Ctrl+Z to undo
and click again on a neighboring pixel.
There are other options that can help you fine-tune a
Magic Wand selection. Match modes enable you to
make
a
selection
on
the
basis
of
color,
hue,
brightness and opacity as well as RGB values. Using
the Brightness Match mode is one way to select
shadow or highlight detail if you want to make
selective tonal adjustment to an image.
Click the Use all layers checkbox if you want the
Magic Wand tool to base its selection on all pixels in
298

the image, rather than just those in the active layer (if
you get very unexpected results with the Magic Wand
tool, e.g. everything selected wherever you click, it’s
probably because you’re clicking in an empty layer
with Use all layers unchecked). ‘Contiguous’ selects
only pixels that are next to each other, so you get one
selection marquee. Turn off Contiguous and the
Magic Wand tool can jump over non-selected pixels to
select in-range pixels anywhere within the image. In
non-Contiguous
mode
you’ll
get
little
pools
of
selection all over the image.
Finally, you can elect to anti-alias a Magic Wand
selection’s edge pixels. Use the pull-down menu to
determine
whether
pixels
outside
or
inside
the
selection border will be anti-aliased.
The Tool Options palette isn’t the last word on
modifying
Magic
Wand
selections.
On
the
Selections>Modify
menu
you’ll
find
a
host
of
additional fine-tuning adjustments that will allow you
to, among other things, expand, contract, select
similar, feather, smooth and remove specks and holes
from your selections. These can, of course, be used
with any selections, not just those created with the
Magic Wand tool.
What else can you do with selections?
• All selections can be saved and stored for later
use in an alpha channel or to a designated area
on your hard drive like any other file.
• Selections can be used like a stencil – to inhibit
brush actions along straight.
• All selection tools have an ‘Add To’ and a
‘Subtract From’ function. Hold the Shift key when
299

making a second selection and it’s added to the
first. Keep holding the Shift key to add further
selections. In this way you can build, or reduce,
extremely accurate selections.
• To further refine the process, selection tools are
interchangeable. Make an initial selection using
the Magic Wand tool, for example, and add to that
using
a
Marquee
tool.
Finish
off
using
the
Freehand
Selection
tool.
Use
the
Shift
and
Control keys to apply additions and subtractions
or set the same parameters in the Tool Options
palette.
• Use
the
Options
palette
to
make
custom
selections using numerical values in the fields
provided (‘Customize Selection’ in the Options
palette).
• PaintShop Pro also has an Edit Selection mode
(‘Selections>Edit Selection’). In this mode, all the
raster
painting/drawing
tools
and
many
filter
effects can be used to modify the selection
marquee. In this mode the selection is rendered
in a red opaque color so it’s easy to see. This is a
powerful
and
fast
way
to
make
an
average-looking selection into something that has
professional accuracy.
• Perfect the selection using the Selection Modify
tools. These will allow you to produce surprising
accuracy
from
even
the
roughest
of
initial
selections.
300

Fig 5.5A To select these objects using the Magic
Wand tool I first duplicated the background layer and
used a Layers adjustment to make the background as
white as possible.
301

Fig 5.5B Refine the selection using the Magic Wand
tool in Add mode (or hold down Shift). You should be
able to select all of the background using this method.
Fig 5.5C Invert the selection (press Ctrl+Shift+I) and
choose Edit Selection from the Selections menu to
alter the selection using the brush tools.
302

Fig 5.5D Using the brush tools with Edit Selection
enables you to make a very accurate, soft-edged
selection which won’t ‘show the join’ when you paste.
Using the Geometric Selection Tools
In some ways, PaintShop Pro’s Geometric selection
tools are the easiest to use because they are ‘preset’.
They don’t rely entirely on the accuracy of the mouse
action.
Open a picture and duplicate the Background layer
(‘Layers>Duplicate’) so that you can practice on a
copy of the original rather than the original itself.
Make sure that the top layer is active (click it in the
Layers palette).
Choose the Rectangular Marquee selection tool from
the Tools toolbar, left-click and drag the cursor across
the picture about 20% from the edge of the image.
The moving line that appears where the selection was
drawn is called the ‘selection marquee’. Any further
editing on the picture applies to the area inside this
selection only. Because we want to add an effect to
the area outside this selection it must be reversed or
‘inverted’.
Choose
‘Selections>Invert’
from
the
Selections
drop-down menu and note how it selects the entire
image up to the borders of the original area selected.
Use the keyboard shortcut ‘Ctrl+Shift+M’ to hide the
marquee to make it easier to see any tone changes
you make. Note that, though it is hidden, the selection
is still active.
303

Open the Levels dialog window (‘Adjust>Brightness
and Contrast>Levels’) and drag the grey diamond
slider (the middle one) to the right. This darkens the
selected area. Push the slider far enough to make the
edges
significantly
darker,
but
still
keep
them
semi-transparent.
You can refine all selections using the Feather
adjustment. This blurs the selection line across an
adjustable pixel width so that you can soften those
typical scalpel-sharp selection cut-lines.
Adding to the Selection
To add to a selection, hold the Shift key down and
make several more geometric selections, adding one
on top of the other to build up a complex irregular but
still geometric selection with each new mouse drag.
Change the shape of the selection (circular, square,
octagonal, etc.) using the Options palette. Remember
at all times to update the save to preserve the
selection
information
in
an
alpha
channel
(‘Selections>Save to Alpha Channel’).
The Object Extractor and Background Eraser
In addition to the selection tools PaintShop Pro X6
has a couple of ways to cut out and remove objects
from photos. These aren’t strictly speaking selection
tools, they go beyond mere selection and actually
remove parts of the image for you in one single
operation.
The Object Extractor does exactly what it says, it cuts
out part of an image – say a person, car flower or
whatever your subject happens to be – removing the
304

background. To use the Object Extractor Select
Object Extractor from the image menu. The Object
Extractor opens in its own window which displays a
large image preview below which are some tools and
settings. To use it you select the brush tool, set an
appropriate brush size and paint an outline around
the edge of the object you want to cut out. If you
make a mistake you can erase with the eraser. When
the outline is complete, click inside it with the fill tool
to fill the selected area with a red mask, then click the
Process button.
PaintShop Pro X6 now makes a first attempt at
extracting the object from the background. If it doesn’t
get it right the first time, try experimenting with the
accuracy slider – each time you move it the image is
reprocessed and you’ll have to wait a few seconds.
Subjects with more detailed edges will require a
higher accuracy setting (and better skills with the
brush)
but
as
long
as
the
subject
that
you’re
attempting to extract is reasonably well isolated from
the background you should be able to get a good
result. To get a better look check the Hide Mask
checkbox and if you want to go back and edit the
outline in an attempt to improve the result click the
Edit mask button. When you’re happy that you’ve got
the best possible result click the OK button to extract
the object. What happens now is that the background
is deleted leaving your object cut out on its layer.
The Object Extractor like the Background Eraser,
which works in a similar fashion, works best on
objects that are well isolated from their backgrounds,
e.g. those shot against a plain background – like the
sky in our example. To cut out objects with more
305

complex backgrounds you’ll get a better result using
the selection tools already discussed and, even
better, masking, which is explained toward the end of
this chapter. You could also take a look at the
step-by-step project at the end of this chapter that
shows exactly how to deal with objects that have
fussy edge detail.
Fig 5.6
The Object Extractor makes light work of removing a
subject from its background. It works best on subjects
like this, which are clearly defined against a plain
background like the sky. It’s very simple to use, you
just paint an outline around the subject, fill it, then
click the process button. PaintShop Pro X6 then
deletes the background detail.
The Smart Carver
One other feature of PaintShop Pro X6 that I want to
mention here is the Smart Carver which combines
306

retouching and cropping in one operation, allowing
you to resize an image while preserving some details
and removing others. Again, though it’s not strictly
speaking a selection tool, it uses simple selections as
a basis for automating what would otherwise be a
complex retouching task.
Tip
Instead of trying to select an object, it’s often easier
to select the background, then invert the selection
(press Ctrl+Shift+I). You can also try using a Levels
adjustment to make a light background completely
white and much easier to ‘grab’ using the Magic
Wand tool.
The Smart Carver is on the Image menu just above
the Object Extractor and opens in its own window. It
has two brushes, one for preserving detail and the
other for removing it. You simply paint over what’s
important with the green brush and daub what you
want to lose with the red brush. I use the word daub
advisedly. The great thing about the Smart Carver is
that you don’t need to be too careful about going over
the edges. As long as what you want to keep or loose
is covered in paint it works just fine.
Having done your painting there are buttons for
resizing the image both vertically and horizontally.
The most useful of these are the Auto-contract
buttons on the right which resize the image sufficiently
to remove all unwanted detail.
307

Fig 5.7
Smart Carver resizes photos removing unwanted
detail in the process. Unlike cropping, the bits you
want to get rid of don’t have to be near the edges.
You can seamlessly remove detail from anywhere in
the frame.
308

Fig 5.8 PaintShop Pro has a wide range of special
selection tools but for cutting irregular objects out
from a background the best options are the Smart
Selection
Brush,
Auto
Selection
tool,
Freehand
Selection tool or the Magic Wand tool. Few objects
are perfect geometric shapes and the geometric
selection tools are really intended for producing
graphics by making a selection and filling it. If you are
taking a photo of objects you intend to cut out, shoot
them on a white or plain colored background to make
the task of selecting them easier.
Alpha Channels
When you make a selection, PaintShop Pro stores it
in an alpha channel. Channels are a bit like layers; an
RGB image is composed of three channels, one each
for the red, green and blue image data. Alpha
channels are greyscale – pixels in them are either
black, white or one of 254 shades of grey. In an alpha
channel, pixels within a selected area are white,
unselected pixels are black and grey pixels are
partially selected.
Tip
Using the Brush tools to paint directly onto a mask
layer is often a much easier way to obtain a
selection than using any of the selection tools.
How can you have a partially selected pixel? Well,
pixels in a feathered selection are partially selected. If
you looked at the alpha channel for a circular
feathered selection, there would be a white hole in the
middle with a soft edge gradually fading to black. Any
309

editing applied to image pixels selected using an
alpha channel with grey pixels will have a partial
effect, which is extremely useful for subtle image
editing without ‘hard’ edges. It means you can apply
filters and other effects with a gradually tapering
effect.
At their simplest, alpha channels are simply useful
methods for permanently storing selections. To do
this all you have to do is click Selections > Load/
Save Selection/Save Selection to Alpha Channel.
Usually, you’ll want to save a selection to the image
you created it from, but you can also save and load
selections into other documents.
Fig 5.9 This selection was made using the elliptical
selection
tool
feathered
by
200
pixels.
The
corresponding alpha channel shows the selected area
310

in the center, gradually fading to black, and the
bottom right image shows the actual selected pixels.
Fig 5.10 A Mask layer hides parts of underlying
layers without actually deleting pixels.
Masks
Masks are a little like alpha channels in that they use
a greyscale image to determine what happens to
corresponding image pixels. Masks are in fact a
special
kind
of
layer.
Greyscale
mask
pixels
determine the opacity of image pixels in underlying
layers. Masks provide a useful means of hiding image
pixels without actually deleting them. By directly
editing masks (and, for that matter, alpha channels)
you
can
perform
sophisticated
image-editing
311

techniques in a non-destructive way, without altering
the pixel values in the affected layer.
To create a mask, first make a selection, then choose
Layers>New Mask Layer>Show Selection to show the
selected parts of an image layer and hide the rest. To
mask (hide) the contents of the selection and show
the
unselected
bits
choose
Layers>New
Mask
Layer>Hide Selection.
Selections,
alpha
channels
and
masks
are
interchangeable. You can turn a selection into an
alpha channel or a mask, create an alpha channel
from a mask, load a mask from an alpha channel and,
of course, load selections from masks and alpha
channels. You can discover more about masks in the
following chapter.
312

Step-by-Step Projects
Replacing a Lackluster Sky
How often have you taken a shot that you really love,
but the weather was a bit dull and the sky just looks
grey and boring? Well thanks to PaintShop Pro’s
great range of selection tools that’s a problem you no
longer have to live with. The new Smart Selection
Brush in PaintShop Pro X6 makes short work of once
difficult selections so you can quickly isolate your
subject, mask it and drop a new, brighter, more
interesting sky into the frame in just a few minutes.
STEP 1 I was quite pleased with this silhouette shot
of a couple of lads fishing at one of the local beaches.
I deliberately under-exposed the shot so the figures
and the rocks would appear black against the evening
313

sky. The trouble is the sky itself, which is a flat, drab
grey/blue expanse. I reckon a more interesting sky
with a little bit of color could improve the shot hugely.
The first step is to get a good accurate selection of
the boys and the rocks they’re fishing from, plus the
cliff behind them and the sea. Everything but the sky
in other words. The Smart Selection Brush should
make light work of this, Select it from the Selection
tools fly-out on the Tools toolbar, it’s the fourth one
down and looks like a wand with a green star on the
tip.
STEP 2 Change the size of the brush in the tool
options palette by dragging the size slider to make the
brush big enough to paint large sections of the rocks.
Then do just that, position the brush over the rocks
and click and drag to paint with short strokes. The
default mode for the Smart Selection Brush is Add, so
each new stroke you paint adds to the selection. In
314

actual fact, just a couple of dabs with the brush have
selected most of what I wanted.
STEP 3 If you zoom in close you’ll see that the Smart
Selection Brush hasn’t picked up the narrow section
of the boys’ fishing rods. You could try reducing the
size of the brush to just a few pixels, but the truth is
none of PaintShop Pro’s selection tools is great at
dealing with very small selections of just a few pixels.
Don’t worry about it for now, we’ll deal with it a little
later.
315

STEP 4 Now we’ve got the subject selected (or most
of it, at any rate) we’ll apply a mask layer to it that will
hide the parts of the layer that aren’t selected. Click
the New mask layer button at the bottom of the
Layers palette and select Show selection from the
pop-up
menu.
Immediately
you’ll
see
the
sky
disappear and be replaced by a chequer board
pattern. That’s PaintShop Pro’s baseboard, and you
can see it through the masked transparent hole we
just made in the background layer. Notice also that in
the Layers palette the Background layer has been
renamed Raster 1 and has been added to a new
group called Group – Raster 1 along with its mask
layer which is called Mask – Raster 1. Now that the
mask is created you can deselect all by pressing
Ctrl-d.
316

STEP 5 The next step is to paste in the new sky.
Open the photo you want to use (it’s a good idea to
take photos of dramatic skies whenever you see them
for just such an occasion as this) press Ctrl-A to
select all and copy it. Then go back to your original
photo and paste it as a new layer (Edit>Paste as new
layer or Ctrl-V). When you paste the sky layer it will
appear above the mask layer in the layers palette.
Drag it to the bottom of the layers palette so it
appears underneath everything else.
317

STEP 6 As you can see, my sky photo is smaller than
the original so it’ll have to be enlarged to fit. Select the
pick tool and drag a corner handle to resize the layer,
holding down the shift key to maintain the proportions.
You can move the sky layer around within the ‘hole’
created in the upper layer by the mask to position it
just where you want it. We’re almost there now,
except for the truncated fishing rods.
318

STEP 7 Select the Mask – rasterl layer in the Layers
palette and then click the visibility icon (the eye) to
turn the mask off. Then click the Highlight mask area
button at the top of the layer mask. This displays the
mask area as a red overlay so you can see exactly
319

what’s masked and what isn’t. In the Materials palette
click the Set to black and white button (it looks like a
square with black and white triangles, hover over it to
get a tool tip) then click the swap material button
(double headed arrow) and start painting the fishing
rod. What you’re doing is painting in white on the
mask layer, revealing what’s on the image beneath
(i.e. the fishing rod). Don’t worry if doesn’t make much
sense to you right now, as long as you get the
expected result. You’ll find out a lot more about
masks, how they’re related to selections and how to
use them in the next chapter.

Chapter 6
Combining Images
Layers and Masks
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• This chapter is all about layers. We’ve already
come across layers in earlier chapters and in
some of the step-by-step projects and we’ve seen
how you can use adjustment layers to make
editable changes to image tones and color.
• Layers are extremely useful as they allow you to
combine different elements – photos, text and
graphics – all in the same document. Layers are a
little like sheets of tracing paper in a pad – you
can see through the topmost layers to those
below. PaintShop Pro X6’s Layers palette allows

• As well as learning how to use the Layers palette,
this chapter shows you how to combine several
photos into one image using layers, how to use
PaintShop Pro X6’s rulers, grids and guides to
position and align layers, what you can do with
adjustment layers and how to combine layers.
• We’ll also take a detailed look at Mask layers,
briefly introduced in the last chapter. In the
Step-by-Step Projects section at the end of the
chapter,
I’ll show you how to use layer deformations to
create
realistic
shadows,
how
to
mask
an
Adjustment layer to produce a graduated color
effect and then finally how to use PaintShop Pro’s
HDR Exposure Merge feature to create stunning
HDR images.
• Layers allow you to combine several images –
each stacked one above the other – in a single
document. The biggest advantage of layers is that
they allow you to put elements on top of one
another without destroying what’s underneath.
But, as we shall see, the advantages of using
layers go far beyond that.
Understanding Layers
What is a layer? A layer is simply one picture sitting
directly on top of another. Layers can contain whole
photos, text, vector drawings, scanned art or anything
else that can be digitized. You can add as many
layers as you want in one document, depending on
your requirements. The reason for building up these
323

layers is to maintain the pictures’ editability. While a
picture retains its layers, it can always be edited.
Flatten those layers, so that it can be e-mailed, for
example, and you lose the power to edit it.
PaintShop
Pro
has
quite
sophisticated
layering
capabilities. Not only does it allow you to create
montages from multi-layered documents, but also it
has a range of features like Adjustment layers that
open up further editing possibilities. So much so that
every stage in the image-building process can be
deconstructed,
changed,
altered,
improved
and
returned to its place, over and over again, with
incredible accuracy and remarkable ease.
Fig 6.1 The illustration here shows how a layered
image works. Viewed from above (i.e. in the work
area) the picture looks perfectly normal, but exploring
the Layer palette shows that it is in fact composed of
three separate layers – all of which can be moved or
can have their contents edited independently. Layers
files must be saved as either ‘.pspimage’ files or, for
324

cross-computer compatibility, in the ‘.psd’ (Adobe
Photoshop) file format. Using either of these file
formats preserves the layer integrity.
Who Uses Layers?
Layers are used by anyone who adds text to a
document, whether a single character or a page of
copy for a brochure. Layers are used to make
multi-image montages where several pictures blend
seamlessly into one. Layers are used extensively by
designers, illustrators, web designers and anyone, in
fact, who uses images that have more than one
picture element in them.
What Can You Do with Layers?
A layer is like a clear sheet of acetate. Layers can be
opaque or transparent, and they can contain pixels
(bitmap) or vector data (text and shapes).
You
can cut,
copy and paste
layers from
one
document to another. Layers can be flipped, rotated,
resized, distorted, rearranged or grouped in any
number of combinations. You can apply color and
tonal adjustments to single layers – and you can add
a full range of filter effects, as if one layer were a
single picture. Only while the layered document
retains its original layers does it remain editable. For
seasoned image-makers, this layer editability remains
a powerful attraction. How many times have you
finished working only to spot something you missed
but now can’t change? If you use layers and have
saved the layered version of the image (as mentioned
previously), you can make that change!
325

Before
you
get
too
excited,
layers
have
some
disadvantages. Multiple layers create a spaghetti-like
complexity that can be hard to keep track of. And the
more layers you add to a document, the larger the file
becomes, occupying more space on your hard disk
and taking longer to process every time you make a
change in PaintShop Pro. If the number of layers in
your document starts to get unweildy, you can merge
selected layers into each other. You’d do this to
layers, or groups of layers, that are similar or are
finished with (i.e. you are sure that they’ll never need
changing).
Layers offer tremendous potential for the creative
image-maker. Simply adjusting the opacity of an
individual layer allows you to see everything on the
layer beneath. Each layer also has a range of Blend
modes. These can be adjusted to radically change the
way the pixels in the layer react with the pixels in the
layer directly below.
We already know that PaintShop Pro has an almost
limitless Undo feature (‘Ctrl+Z’). This means that you
can reverse the picture-building process by up to
1000 steps; however, in accepting an Undo command
and then saving, those steps are lost forever. If you
are working with layers, you can apply major editing
stages to different layers and retain everything in the
one document, regardless of whether you are using it
or not. Each layer has a small eye icon called the
‘Visibility toggle’. Click the Visibility toggle to switch
the layer ‘off’, click again to switch it back ‘on’.
326

Fig 6.2
The Layers palette is the control center for layers and
the things on them. It helps you organize and keep
track of all the layers within an image. There are five
layer types – Raster, Vector, Art Media, Adjustment
and Mask layers. Layers are arranged in order in the
Layers palette. The topmost layer in the image
appears at the top of the palette; you can rearrange
the layers by dragging and dropping. The Layers
palette
here
shows
the
individual
layers
and
thumbnail images of the content on each. There are
several layers, some of which are organized into
groups (you can expand and collapse groups by
clicking the little triangle button alongside). (a) Edit
Selection, (b) Show/hide layer effects, (c) Link/unlink,
(d) Lock/unlock, (e) Layer styles, (f) layer opacity, (g)
327

Layer blend mode, (h) layer type, (i) Visibility toggle,
(j) New layer, (k) New Adjustment layer, (l) New Mask
layer, (m) New layer group, (n) Delete layer, (o)
General preferences.
You might also do this to layers that, once merged,
can
be
separated
again
if
necessary
using
a
selection. Though merging or flattening layers frees
valuable computer resources, I’d suggest keeping the
layers for editing because you never know.
What features can be found in layers?
• Move the picture elements on layers in any
direction.
• Change the tone, color, contrast and alignment of
any layer.
• Mix Vector and Bitmap layers in one document.
• Create new, blank Vector and Bitmap layers at
the press of a button.
• Collect selected layers into Layer Groups.
• Copy single layers, or groups of layers, into the
same or a new document.
• Convert selections into layers.
• Paste
layers
and
selections
from
other
documents into a new document.
• Layers can be reordered by dragging them up or
down in the Layers palette.
• Layers can be switched ‘on’ and ‘off’ by clicking
the Visibility toggle (the eye icon) in the Layers
palette.
• You can paste the contents of the clipboard into a
new layer.
328

• Duplicate a layer using the Duplicate command
(Layers > Duplicate) or by pressing the duplicate
tab in the palette.
• Use the ‘Edit Selection’ button in the Layers
palette to edit a selection (Selection Edit mode).
Combining Pictures
PaintShop Pro allows you to create and save every
stage of the image-building process as a separate
layer. These layers can be switched on or off
according to their application. You can also store
masks and selections as separate channels in layered
documents. These too can be switched on and off. In
PaintShop Pro, any document that has layers, masks
or selections has to be saved in the native PaintShop
Pro file format with a ‘.pspimage’ file ending.
While .pspimage retains layers, this file format is for
use
only
in
PaintShop
Pro,
you
cannot
use
‘.pspimage’ files on the web or in a word document for
example. The file has to be converted first or copied
to a more suitable file type, such as JPEG or TIFF.
First you must flatten the file
(‘Layers > Merge > Merge All (Flatten)’). Doing this
turns it into a single-layered document. This loses
most of its editability, which is why you should only do
this to a copy of the original .pspimage file. Save your
layered documents as master files and then make
copies from that master for use in other, non-layered
file applications.
329

Fig 6.3 A layered (.pspimage) document is more
editable than any other format. Because of this it’s
also
too
large
for
many
applications,
such
as
e-mailing or storage on a limited size disk. For this
reason it is important to make a copy and to Flatten or
Merge
those
layers
so
that
the
resulting
single-layered document can be resaved in a smaller
file format, like JPEG or TIFF
The simplest way to combine two pictures into one
document is to copy one and paste it as a new layer
into the other. These layers are totally separate and
can be edited at any time as if they were two totally
different picture elements. However, because they are
in the same document, you also have to contend with
their relationship. While copying and pasting one
picture into another is by far the easiest way to add
another picture to a document, there are a few points
to consider first.
Tip
330

The base layer is called the ‘Background’ and is, in
fact, not a layer at all. However, it can be ‘promoted’
(converted) into a layer if needed (right-click on the
Background layer in the Layer palette and choose
‘Promote Background Layer’ from the contextual
menu). If you don’t want to promote the background,
you can simply duplicate it.
The resolution of the pasted image, measured in pixel
dimensions or dots per inch, is relevant (see Chapter
9 if you want to know more about resolution). For
example, if this is larger than the receiving image it
will overspill (bleed off the edges) once pasted.
However, even though it looks as if the edges of the
pasted image have disappeared, the program does
not discard them; they are still there but only become
visible if dragged into view using the Move tool (‘MO.
Another factor to watch out for when combining
pictures is their respective color spaces. Providing
that the color space of the master document is either
24-bit or greyscale, it will prevail over what is being
pasted into it. So, if you copy an 8-bit picture into a
24-bit color picture, the color space of the pasted
picture will be increased to match that of the host
document. On the other scale, if you try to paste a
color picture into a black and white image, it will be
converted into the mono color space.
Tip
To maintain the aspect ratio of a layer while resizing
it (in other words, to avoid stretching or squeezing
331

it), use the right mouse button to drag a corner
handle.
PaintShop Pro offers a number of ways to paste
copied images into another document via the Edit
menu, by right-clicking in the new document, or using
keyboard shortcuts. These are
• Paste as New Image. This creates a new picture
on its own background.
• Paste as New Layer. This adds the contents of
the
clipboard
to
the
selected
document
background. PaintShop Pro automatically creates
a new layer for the pasted image. If the pasted
image matches the physical dimensions of the
target image, it will obscure the lower layer or
background picture.
• Paste as New Selection. This pastes the newly
selected picture into the target document, but it
remains attached to the cursor, so that it can be
positioned somewhere other than directly on top
of the background. Left-click to offload the layer
and view the selection marquee. The pasted layer
then becomes a floating selection until it is
deselected. You can save this selection as an
alpha
channel
(in
case
it
is
needed
again:
‘Selections > Save To Alpha Channel’). If you
already
have
a
floating
selection,
it
will
be
defloated and deselected before another picture
can be pasted into the document (i.e. you can’t
have two floating selections in one document).
• Paste as Transparent Selection. This command
does the same as the Paste as New Selection
332

command,
but
enables
you
to
import
transparency from another image. Because of this
transparency, the pasted layer is attached to the
Move tool for easy repositioning. Click in the
image to free it once it is in the right position.
What can you do with layers?
• Change the individual tonal appearance of each
layer.
• Make and edit selections on individual layers.
• Add Blend modes to individual layers for special
effects.
• Save layer selection and mask information to an
alpha channel and to disk.
• Add Adjustment layers.
• Apply any of PaintShop Pro’s filter effects to a
layer.
• Bend and transform the shape of any object on a
layer.
• Convert Vector layers to Bitmap layers.
Advanced Layout Tools
As we have seen, there are many ways to use
PaintShop Pro for combining multiple layers into a
single document. In the following section we’ll take a
look at some of the features designed to make laying
out and arranging multiple picture documents easier.
You’ll find these tools useful for positioning and
aligning
multiple
photos
as
well
as
for
adding
annotation labels.
Tip
333

To remove all of the guides on a photo select
Change Grid, Guide and Snap Properties from the
view menu (or double-click one of the Rulers) click
the Guides tab if it isn’t already displayed and check
the Delete guides box. You can delete guides from
the current image or from all open images.
Fig 6.4 PaintShop Pro’s rulers, guides and grid
enable you to accurately position and align elements.
Snap to Grid and Snap to Guides make the grid and
guides behave as though magnetized – they attract
and
hold
dragged
objects
which
are
in
close
proximity. Double-click the rulers or select View >
Change Grid, Guide & Snap Properties to change grid
spacing and other grid and guide properties.
Under PaintShop Pro’s View menu, there are a
number
of
highly
useful
productivity-enhancing
334

features designed to make aligning and arranging
multi-layer images faster and easier. These are:
• Rulers. Keyboard shortcut ‘Ctrl+Alt+R’ adds rulers
along the X- and Y-axes of the picture window.
You
can
change
the
units
of
measurement
(pixels/inches/centimeters) through the program’s
General
Preferences
(File
>
Preferences
>
General Program Preferences, then click on Units
in the Preference Column on the left). Place the
cursor anywhere in the image and you can read
out
the
exact
location
in
the
corresponding
margin. It’s a handy tool, especially if you are
working with extremely small picture elements on
multiple layers.
• View
Grid.
If
you
find
the
grid
too
heavy,
double-click on the rulers in the margin and you’ll
see the Grid, Guide & Snap Properties dialog.
Change the units used and the color to make it
appear
friendlier.
You’ll
need
to
make
adjustments
every
now
and
then
for
different-sized pictures. This is a useful feature for
precise layer or picture element alignment.
• View Guides. This is one of the neatest design
assistants in PaintShop Pro. It works only if
‘Rulers’ are switched ‘on’. Guides are colored
lines that can be pulled out of the margins (using
the
cursor
regardless
of
the
tool
currently
selected) and dragged over the picture to form
well-design or layout guides. There are no limits
to the number of guides that can be used in one
document.
Guides
can
be
repositioned
by
grabbing the guide handle (that’s the thicker bit of
guideline that appears inside the ruler margin as
335

you move the cursor over it). If you want to
change the guide properties, double-click the
ruler to open its window or just click the guide
handle in the margin to open the Grid, Guide &
Snap
Properties
dialog.
This
allows
you
to
change its color, position or existence!
• Snap to Guides. This function adds tremendous
power to the task of aligning multiple layers along
a common axis – by selecting this option and
making sure that, in the Grid, Guide & Snap
Properties dialog, the Snap Influence setting is
set to more than one. What this does is if you
grab an image layer using the Move tool and drag
it toward the guide it appears to be magnetically
attracted to the line. In fact, it ‘snaps’ to the line.
Increase this value to increase the magnetic
power.
You can change any of these settings for the opened
document only, or for the default settings. This feature
is a real production enhancer. Under the Layers
palette:
• Layer Opacity. All layers have an opacity scale
controlled from the Layers palette. Default setting
is 100%. Reducing this allows you to see through
the layer to whatever lies beneath. Do this to help
align specific pictures or graphic elements with
stuff that lies beneath.
Under the Layer menu:
• Arrange. This feature allows you to swap the
layer order, although you can also do this by
using the cursor to grab a layer in the palette and
dragging it to another position in the stack.
336

• View. Controls which layers are visible and which
are not. You may also switch a layer on and off by
clicking on the eye icon in the palette itself.
• Merge. Merge allows you to do just that: merge or
blend selected layers. Merge Visible flattens only
the layers with the eye icon switched ‘on’ (i.e.
those that are visible on the desktop).
Tip
To change the ruler units choose File > Preferences
> General Program Preferences and Select Units
from the list in the Preferences dialog box. You can
choose among Pixels, Inches and Centimeters.
Using Adjustment Layers
Making tonal adjustments to a digital photo, for
example, brightening the midtones and shadows with
a Levels adjustment, changing the color balance, or
using the Fill Flash filter, changes the value of pixels
within the image. Other than by pressing Ctrl+Z to
undo, these changes are irreversible. Opening, say,
the Levels dialog box and making an adjustment in
the opposite direction will not get you back to where
you started.
But what if you could apply such changes and, if you
later changed your mind, remove them, as if they’d
never been applied in the first place? Adjustment
layers allow you to do exactly that. Adjustment layers
are a safer, more versatile way of applying image
adjustments because, as well as turning them on and
off just like other layers, you can apply Adjustment
layers to one or several layers within the image.
337

You can also go back to Adjustment layers and edit
the
settings
at
any
time
without
causing
any
degradation in image quality. With Adjustment layers,
doing the opposite to a previous adjustment does get
you back exactly where you started.
Earlier we spoke of layers as being like acetate
sheets stacked on top of the background image.
Think of Adjustment layers in the same way – as a
clear sheet to which you can apply adjustments and
through
which
you
view
layers
below.
The
appearance of the pixels in the underlying layers is
affected by the Adjustment layer, but the pixels
themselves are not altered.
Whereas an adjustment affects only the active layer,
an Adjustment layer acts on all the layers beneath it,
or all the layers within a Layer Group. By careful
positioning of Adjustment layers, you can change only
one
part
of
an
image.
Adjustment
layers
are
frequently used when combining images to make the
new image elements match in terms of color and
lighting.
338

Fig 6.5
(1) Here, I’ve made a rectangular selection on the
right of the image and added a Hue/Saturation/
Lightness adjustment layer. The new Layers palette
displays a thumbnail of the mask. (2) Filling an
339

Adjustment layer with a linear gradient applies more
correction at the top, gradually reducing toward the
bottom. (3) An Adjustment layer is infinitely editable
with no loss of image quality, to alter the color just
double-click
the
adjustment
layer
in
the
Layers
palette.
Another way of limiting Adjustment layers is by editing
them
in
the
same
way
as
Mask
layers.
You’ll
remember from the previous chapter that Mask layers
are greyscale and pixel values in the Mask layer
affect
the
opacity
of
corresponding
pixels
in
underlying
layers.
Adjustment
layers
are
also
greyscale and their effect on underlying layers is
likewise dependent on the pixels within the mask.
Black pixels apply no correction, white pixels apply
the full amount of correction and grey pixels apply
varying amounts of correction in between.
You can vary the overall effect of an Adjustment layer
using
its
Opacity
slider
in
the
layers
palette.
Alternatively, you can apply the Adjustment layer to a
selection, or paint directly onto it to isolate the parts of
the layer you want the adjustment to affect.
Adjustment Layer Types
You can add the following types of Adjustment layer:
• Brightness/Contrast
• Channel mixer
• White Balance
• Curves
• Fill Light/Clarity
• Hue/Saturation/Lightness
• Histogram
340

• Invert
• Levels
• Local Tone Mapping
• Posterize
• Threshold
• Vibrancy
Advantages of Adjustment Layers
• Add a range of tone and effects changes to a
layer or layers without actually changing the
original layer.
• Useful for applying overall color or tone changes
to multiple layers at a time.
• Can be removed by deleting the Adjustment layer
or switching it off.
• Ideal for working with panoramas.
Creating Layer Blend Mode Effects
Blend modes determine how pixels in a layer interact
with corresponding pixels in underlying layers. The
default Blend mode is ‘Normal’ – the pixel in the top
layer is superimposed on (and therefore hides) the
pixel in the underlying layers (subject to transparency
settings).
There are 20 other Blend modes in addition to
‘Normal’ and each provides a slightly different result.
‘Darken’, for example, displays only pixels in the
selected layer that are darker than corresponding
pixels
in
underlying
layers;
lighter
pixels
in
the
selected layer disappear. The Lighten Blend mode
does
the
opposite.
‘Color’
applies
the
hue
and
saturation of pixels in the selected layer to underlying
layers without affecting lightness and ‘Difference’
341

subtracts the selected layer’s color from the color of
underlying layers.
Some
Blend
modes
have
practical
applications.
‘Darken’ and ‘Lighten’ are useful for retouching and
cloning. You can also use ‘Darken’ to get rid of a
white
background
on
a
logo
or
other
artwork.
‘Multiply’, which combines the colors in the selected
layer with underlying layers to produce a darker color,
is useful for producing realistic drop shadows.
Because the outcome depends on initial pixel values
in the selected and underlying layers, the results of
some Blend modes can be hard to predict. If you are
working with two layers, simply swapping the layer
order can produce very different results. This makes
Blend modes an excellent tool for creating special
effects with multiple images and works especially well
with text, but a certain amount of experimentation is
often required to get a good result.
Blend modes can be selected for most of PaintShop
Pro’s Brush tools as well as layers – the Blend mode
pull-down menu in the Tool Options palette provides
exactly the same options as are available in the
Layers palette.
Using Mask Layers
A Mask layer works a bit like a stencil – holding back
some parts of the image and revealing others. We
briefly looked at Mask layers in the previous chapter
on using selections. Mask layers, alpha channels and
selections are a bit difficult to pin down in terms of
definitions because they all do pretty much the same
thing – control which parts of the image are displayed
342

or affected by an adjustment – in slightly different
ways.
Earlier, we saw how Adjustment layers could be used
as Mask layers to confine their corrections to one part
of the image, but a Mask layer is more often used to
hide parts of the image without actually deleting it.
The advantage of this should be fairly obvious; you
can subsequently edit the mask to reveal hidden parts
of the underlying layers or, conversely, to hide more.
343

Fig 6.6
PaintShop Pro’s 21 Blend modes as applied to the
two images ‘Top’ and ‘Bottom’. Results depend on
layer
content
and
order.
Layer
modes
can
be
particularly effective when used with text layers.
Legacy modes maintain compatibility with earlier
344

versions, so if you want to replicate an effect you
created in an earlier version of the application you
shouldn’t have any difficulty. Generally though, the
newer versions produce better results.
Often, the best starting point for creating a mask is a
selection.
Make
a
selection
using
one
or
a
combination of the selection tools and modifiers and
from the Layers menu choose New Mask Layer >
Show Selection to create a mask that shows the
selected parts of the layer and hides everything else.
To create a mask that hides the selected area choose
Layers > New Mask Layer > Hide Selection.
PaintShop Pro automatically creates a new Layer
Group containing the selected layer and the new
mask. This is so that the mask doesn’t affect other
layers in your image. If you want the mask to apply to
all the layers beneath it, drag it in the Layers palette
from the Layer Group to the top of the layer stack.
With the mask in place, you can press Ctrl+D or
Selections > Select None. If you need it, you can
recover the selection at any time with Ctrl+Shift+S or
Selections > From Mask.
345

Fig 6.7 A selection is often the best starting point for
a mask. The existence of two options – Show
Selection and Hide Selection – negates the need to
invert the selection if you want to hide the selected
area, as here.
346

Fig 6.8
Painting on a Mask layer provides a simple, yet
effective, method of cleaning up selections. Click the
Highlight mask area button to display the mask as a
red tint on the underlying layer; turning the Mask layer
off allows you to view both masked and unmasked
detail.
Modifying Masks
One of the best things about masks is that you can
use
PaintShop
Pro’s
Brush
tools
to
edit
them.
Painting masks is often an easier and more accurate
way to clean up selections than using the selection
modifiers. You can, for example, use a soft-edged
brush to clean up the edge-detail of difficult subjects
347

like fur, hair or indeed anything that doesn’t have a
clearly defined edge.
To use the Brush tools to directly edit a Mask layer,
select the Mask layer in the Layers palette and
choose the Paint Brush tool. You may have noticed
that the foreground and background swatches in the
Materials palette change to greyscale when a Mask
layer
is
selected;
remember,
Mask
layers
are
greyscale, so you can only paint on them using black,
white or one of 254 levels of grey. Painting on the
mask with black will add to the mask and remove
detail from the underlying layer. Painting with white
will remove the mask and reveal detail on the
underlying layer. If you paint with grey, you’ll make
parts of the underlying layer semi-transparent. It’s
usually easiest to use just black and white and
change the brush settings in the Tool Options palette
to achieve the required effect. As I’ve said before, this
kind of editing is made much easier using a tablet and
stylus.
Adding to the mask – painting out detail on the
underlying layer – is quite straightforward because
you can see what you are doing. Painting detail back
in by removing black areas from the mask is trickier
because you can see neither the mask nor the detail.
To display the mask click the Mask Overlay button on
the Layers palette. This overlays the Mask layer with
black areas displayed as a 50% red tint over the
target layer(s).
Combining Layers
Some digital image-makers work with multiple images
and image masks. In this situation it is vital to
348

remember exactly what you are doing and what the
final planned result should look like. To this end, try to
label all the layers, Layer Groups and masks. Doing
this (by double-clicking each layer and entering the
details in the dialog) will make the masking and
blending process somewhat clearer, especially when
there are 20 or more layers to contend with.
As we’ve seen, images with lots of layers create large
file sizes and it’s often difficult to discover which bits
of the image are on what layer. You can simplify
PaintShop Pro images and drastically reduce the file
size by flattening them or merging layers together.
There are four merge options on the Layers > Merge
menu – Merge Down, Merge All (Flatten), Merge
Visible and Merge Group. Masks that are associated
with underlying layers as part of a Layer Group can
easily be merged using Layers > Merge > Merge
Group.
When you do this, the mask is applied to the image
and masked areas are deleted. Simply deleting the
mask has the same effect.
Merging layers means you no longer have the editing
flexibility that they provided, so if you’re likely to want
to carry out further changes later make a back-up
copy with all the layers intact using File > Save Copy
As before you start merging.
Tip
Displaying the Mask Overlay, but turning off the
Mask layer itself, shows the mask on top of the
unmasked layer below, making it much easier to see
what you’re doing when painting onto the mask.
349

Saving Masks
To save an image with masks use the .pspimage
format. You can save a Mask layer to its own file on
disk – choose Layers > Load/Save Mask > Save
Mask To Disk. The default location for saved masks
varies depending on your version, for PaintShop Pro
X6 it is in My Documents/Corel PaintShop Pro/16.0/
Masks.
If
you’re
running
an
earlier
version
of
PaintShop Pro try My Documents/My PSP files. This
folder is where all your custom content (Tubes,
Masks, Selections, etc.) is saved. You will also find a
selection of ready-made masks in the Masks folder in
the PaintShop Pro program folder. These can be used
for framing and other effects.
Only two formats support images with masks and
other types of layer: they are the .pspimage and .psd
(Photoshop) formats. If you want to save your image
with all layers intact use one of these two file formats.
If you attempt to save your image in a file format that
doesn’t support layers, PaintShop Pro warns you
before flattening the image and saving it.

As well as saving your own masks to disk, PaintShop
Pro provides a selection of existing masks that you
can use to frame layers and create special effects.

Step-by-Step Projects
Creating the Perfect Shadow
PaintShop Pro’s Drop Shadow Layer Style and filter
are great for adding drop shadows to two-dimensional
objects like photos and text, but if you want to add a
realistic drop shadow to a 3D object you need to
create additional layers and use the deformation tools
to produce a realistic shadow shape. It’s not a difficult
technique, and once you’ve mastered it you’ll be able
to add realistic shadows to all manner of things from
signposts, cars and coffee cups to people, even
painters and decorators.
STEP 1 Right-click the background layer in the layers
palette and select Promote Background Layer. Unless
352

you’re lucky, the object you want to create a shadow
for won’t be on a transparent background, so you’ll
have to cut it out. This one has a white background
which the Background Eraser makes light work of.
While you’re using the Background Eraser, hold down
the space bar to temporarily access the Pan tool and
move around the image.
STEP 2 When all of the background is removed,
duplicate the layer by right-clicking it and selecting
‘Duplicate’ from the context menu. Rename the
duplicated layer by clicking its name in the Layers
palette (or by right-clicking the layer and selecting
‘Rename’) and overwriting it. Call it ‘shadow’. The
Layers palette should now look like this.
353

STEP 3 Open the Brightness and Contrast dialog box
(Adjust > Brightness and Contrast > Brightness/
Contrast) and drag the Brightness slider all the way to
the left until the Brightness field reads −255. You’ll
see the preview thumbnail turn black and the image
window will mirror this change if you check the
Preview on Image checkbox. Click OK to apply the
adjustment.
354

STEP 4 You may need to add more canvas to fit the
shadow in. Select Image > Canvas Size and increase
the width and height as necessary. To add canvas on
the right click the top left placement button, select
Centimeters from the pull-down menu and add around
4 cm to the existing width value, e.g. if the original
width is 16.5 cm make it 20.5 cm. If you add too much
canvas either press Ctrl-Z to undo and try again or
remove it using the Crop tool.
355

STEP 5 Select the Pick tool and click on the shadow
object. Hold down the Shift key and drag the middle
handle on the top edge sideways to the right to skew
it. Let go, then drag the handle (this time without
holding down Shift) downward to shorten it. Make
further skew and shortening adjustments until the
shadow shape fits with the kind of lighting setup you
are trying to create. The higher the light the shorter
the shadow will be and the further to the right the
more skew you will need.
356

STEP 6 It’s beginning to look more like a shadow, but
we’re not there yet. Select Adjust > Blur > Gaussian
Blur and enter a value in the Radius field of around 8,
just enough to soften the edges. Click the Preview on
image button to preview the effect in the image
window.
Pixel
value
settings
like
Radius
are
dependent on the size of the image, so if you’re
working on a smaller photo for the web a lower
Radius value of 2 or 3 would be enough.
357

STEP 7 The problem with adding computer-generated
effects to photos is that they lack texture, and
everything in a photo, even shadows, has texture.
Use the Add Noise filter (Adjust > Add/Remove Noise
> Add Noise) to put some texture into the shadow.
Check the Gaussian button and Monochrome box and
use a noise setting of around 15%. Click OK to apply
the noise.
358

STEP 8 Shadows generally appear behind rather
than in front of objects, so drag the shadow layer to
the bottom in the Layers palette. You could also
rename the other layer ‘painter’ or something else
appropriate to your subject. Naming of layers like this
can help you keep track of things. It’s not so important
when there are only one or two layers, but in more
complex images with multiple layers and Mask layers,
it helps to keep things organized.
359

STEP 9 Shadows are rarely solid black. Reduce the
shadow layer opacity by dragging the Opacity slider in
the Layers palette to around 50%.
360

STEP 10 Add a background layer. Select Layer >
New Raster Layer and click OK to accept the default
settings. Drag the layer to the bottom of the Layers
palette, then use the Materials palette to select and
apply a solid color, gradient or pattern to the new
layer.
361

You can, of course, place your transparent object and
shadow on any background including other pictures.
Here, the painter has been superimposed on the rock
image
from
Chapter
8.
His
shadow
has
been
deformed, like the type, to follow the contours of the
rock face using the displacement map technique
described on page 247. The paint on the brush and in
the tin has been changed from blue to red using the
Hue Map.
Creating Graduated Filter Effects with Masks
As we’ve seen in this chapter you can use masks to
selectively apply adjustments, effects filters and other
changes that are usually global to specific parts of the
image. We’ve seen how you can make a selection,
save it as a mask and then paint on the mask to
restrict the scope of adjustments and effects.
362

Making selections, creating masks and editing them
by painting on them takes time and not a little skill, but
by using graduated fills on an Adjustment layer mask
you can restrict an adjustment to part of a photo and
have it gradually and smoothly taper off.
This technique is perfect for simulating graduated
filters used on the lens. One of the most commonly
used
graduated
filters
in
photography
is
the
graduated neutral density (ND) filter which landscape
photographers use to maintain detail in skies. When
exposing for the land in landscape shots bright skies
are typically over-exposed. A graduated ND filter is
grey at the top, gradually tapering off to clear glass,
so restricts the amount of light in the sky portion of the
scene
that
reaches
the
camera
sensor.
In
this
step-by-step project, I’ll show you how to digitally
simulate a graduated ND filter using a masked
Adjustment layer.
Before we get started, you’re probably wondering why
we don’t just use PaintShop Pro’s Graduated Filter
effect (Effects > Photo Effects > Graduated Filter)
which was surely designed for this exact purpose?
The answer is that this is quite a crude tool that
applies a graduated color fill to your image. It’s OK for
a quick and dirty effect, but it’s limited in scope and
can’t be adjusted or removed later. The technique I’ll
show you here is a lot more versatile, can be used
with any adjustment or effect and is fully editable.
STEP 1 Open the photo you want to work on in the
Edit workspace. Click the New Adjustment layer
button on the Layers palette and select Levels from
the
Adjustment
layer
menu.
The
new
Levels
363

Adjustment layer appears in the Layers palette and
the Levels dialog box opens ready for you to make
your adjustment.
STEP 2 Drag the middle diamond under the levels
histogram to the three-quarter tone point on the right
to darken the lighter parts of the image. There’s now a
lot more detail in the sky than previously, but the rest
of the image has gone very dark too. Don’t worry
about that for now, just click OK in the Levels dialog
box to apply the adjustment and close it. Now take a
look at the Layers palette and you’ll see the new
Levels Adjustment layer sitting above the Background
layer containing your photo. The white thumbnail is
the
layer
mask;
it’s
white
because
the
Levels
adjustment is currently applied to the entire image.
364

STEP 3 Now to choose a gradient which we’ll apply to
mask
the
Levels
Adjustment
layer.
Click
the
Foreground and stroke properties swatch in the
Materials palette and select the Gradient tab in the
Material properties dialog box. If it isn’t already
selected, click the gradient swatch and choose the
Black-white gradient preset, then click OK to select
the gradient and close the dialog box.
365

STEP 4 Select the Flood fill tool from the Tools
toolbar, make sure the Levels Adjustment layer is
selected in the Layers palette and click anywhere in
the image to apply the gradient fill to the mask. You’ll
notice two changes; the Adjustment layer thumbnail
now shows the white to black gradient you just
applied, it’s white at the top and changes gradually to
black at the bottom. More importantly, the Layers
adjustment is gradually restricted. The white areas of
the mask display it at 100% and the solid black
completely masks it, with the grey parts of the mask
showing it to varying degrees. Click the Adjustment
layer visibility icon (the eye) in the Layers palette to
toggle the effect on and off.
366

STEP 5 There’s one small problem with our mask. It
gradually tapers the Levels adjustment, which is
great, but the gradient is linear, it changes from solid
white at the top to solid black at the bottom gradually
throughout the frame. Ideally, we want the adjustment
applied full on to all of the sky area, then quickly (but
still gradually) tapering to white around the horizon
line. We can do that by editing the gradient and
re-applying it. Click the foreground color swatch then
click the edit button underneath the gradient swatch in
the Material properties dialog box. The position sliders
under the gradient ramp control the color at that point.
There’s a grey one about three quarters of the way
along, remove it by dragging it of the ramp and
dropping it, then drag the white point from the far right
end of the ramp until the location field reads around
80% and drag the black point to around 65%. Click
the close button, then click yes to save the changes,
followed by OK in the Material properties dialog box.
367

STEP 6 Select Edit > clear to remove the existing
gradient fill from the Adjustment layer mask and click
the image with the Flood fill tool to apply the new
gradient. Now the Adjustment is applied fully to the
whole
area
of
the
sky
and
tapers
quickly,
but
smoothly and invisibly at the horizon. Of course, not
all horizons are as straight as this one, but the great
thing about a mask is that you can paint out any
buildings or other obstructions.
368

HDR Exposure Merge
In this step by step tutorial, I’ll show you how to
achieve a natural looking result using PaintShop Pro
X6’s HDR Exposure Merge feature. Whatever you
think of HDR, it looks like it’s here to stay. A lot of
people are put off by the aggressive tone mapping
that’s used in many HDR images, rendering the scene
more like a painting or illustration than a conventional
photo. That’s given HDR a bit of a bad name and led
a lot of people to assume that it’s
good for nothing. Not so! HDR, or High Dynamic
Range, images are a really useful way to capture the
full range of tones in a scene, particularly when that
range is beyond what the camera sensor is capable of
recording in a single exposure.
369

STEP 1 The basis of HDR is that you combine
several shots taken at different exposure settings, so
first a word about that. You’ll need to shoot at least
two bracketed exposures a stop apart; I’d recommend
you shoot at least three and, if you have the patience,
five won’t do any harm. Some cameras have an auto
bracketing mode that will do this for you. If not,
choose aperture priority exposure mode and manually
bracket with one correctly exposed frame and four at
+1, +2, −1 and −2 EV. For example, if the correct
exposure is 1/500th at f5.6 shoot four additional
frames also at f5.6 but with shutter speeds of 1/250th,
1/125th, 1/1000th and 1/2000th. The reason you
change the shutter speed and not the aperture is to
maintain the same depth of field in each frame.
Finally, it helps a great deal if you put the camera on
a tripod, or rest it somewhere steady, and HDR works
best with fairly static subjects.
Here’s what your five bracketed shots should look
like.
370

STEP 2 Select your five bracketed frames in the
Manage workspace (make a new tray for them if it
helps) and choose File > HDR > Exposure merge.
The merge window has a number of options, the first
of which is the Camera Response Curve Profile. I’m a
little skeptical of this as it lists manufacturers, rather
than individual models and seems to make little
difference to the end result, but you’re welcome to
give it a try if your camera manufacturer is listed,
otherwise just leave it on the default Auto Select.
371

STEP 3 The next section on the Merge Settings
window is for alignment; if you shot using a tripod you
won’t need this, but for hand-held shots you can
experiment
with
edge-based
or
feature-based
alignment to see which produces the best results.
Ignore the Custom editing tools for now; I’ll come
back to those a little later. Just head straight to the
bottom and click the Process button.
You’ll now see the HDR composited image previewed
in the Adjustments window. This is the result using
the default settings, you can choose from one of six
presets to apply a range of adjustments to alter the
white balance, saturation and Tone mapping. It’s the
last of these that determines how the tones in the
original frames are combined and how the vast range
of tones in a 32-bit floating point HDR image are
mapped to more limited tonal range in a 16-bit per
channel integer file.
372

Check out some of these presets. I actually think the
default (no preset) result provides a good balance in
terms of tonal reproduction, white balance and color
saturation. But if you prefer a slightly more stylized
look the Default 1 preset is where it’s at. If default 1 is
a little too much for you, the Default 2 preset is less
full-on. Default 3 is like Default 1, but with darker
midtones and shadows and less vibrant colors. The
remaining presets provide variations with, among
other things, varying saturation or vibrancy.
373

STEP 4 The other thing that differs between the
presets and that’s worth experimenting with is the last
pull-down menu which provides two options, Natural
detail with three sliders for adjusting local tone
mapping in the shadows, midtones and highlights and
Creative details with sliders for strength and block
size.
You
can
reset
things
back
to
the
initial
processed settings by clicking the reset button at the
bottom of the adjustments pane. And, once you’ve
found a combination of settings that works for you,
you can save it as a preset of your own by clicking the
disk icon at the top of the panel.
Once you’ve got the HDR image looking the way you
want it you can click the ‘Create HDR file’ button. This
doesn’t create an image file but saves the HDR
settings so that you can reopen and continue editing
374

later. Unless you want to do that, click the Process
button to apply your settings.
STEP 5 The Fine tune window allows you to do just
that, make minor changes to tone and color as well as
remove noise from the image and apply sharpening.
When you’re happy with how everything looks click
the save and close button and choose the .pspimage
format to save the file as a 16-bit per channel RGB
image.
It’s looking good, but we’re not quite done yet. You
don’t have to look too hard at the screen grab on the
next page to see that there’s a problem with this HDR
composite image. The boats on the left and right of
the frame have moved between exposures and
caused ‘ghosting’ in the final composited result. This
is one of the big problems that you’ll frequently
encounter when shooting HDR, you can avoid camera
movement by using a tripod, but people, water,
vehicles, and even trees have a habit of moving
375

around and there’s not much you can do about it. Or
is there?
STEP 6 Let’s go back to the Merge screen in HDR
Exposure Merge (click the Back button twice). Under
custom editing, you’ll see a selection of tools for
holding back and forcing parts of the image in each
exposure. The Auto brush tool is worth a try, though
I’ve had limited success with it. It analyses each
frame to determine what parts of the subject have
moved between exposures then brushes them out.
Give it a try and see how it works for you. If nothing
else it can guide you to where the problems might be.
Click the Auto brush button and after a few seconds,
you’ll see the problem areas painted in red on each
frame. Now click the process button to create the
HDR Exposure Merge using those settings.
376

STEP 7 If you don’t like what you see click the Back
button and this time use the Brush out brush to
manually paint out the problem areas. You’ll have to
decide how many of the frames you need to apply the
brush out to, but it’s probably best to assume your
subject has moved and is in a different place on every
one of them, so you’ll need to brush out the offending
detail on all but the middle exposure. A far quicker
and easier way to do this is to use the Brush in tool
and paint the same areas on the exposure that you
want to use. Here (above), I’ve brushed in the two
boats on the center (correct) exposure and this
automatically brushes out those same areas on all the
other frames.
The disadvantage is that you won’t get any HDR
goodness in the brushed in/out areas because only
pixel data from a single exposure is used. You can
use the Eraser to remove any accidentally applied
brush in/out paint.
377

STEP 8 Here’s the final result with both of the boats
brushed in on the center (correctly exposed) frame.
378

Chapter 7
Text and Shapes
Understanding Vector Graphics
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• It may seem over the top to devote an entire
chapter to text in a book about photography, after
all PaintShop Pro X6 isn’t a word processor. But
the fact is that there are all sorts of occasions
when you need to add words to your pictures.
Whether
it’s
producing
family
calendars
and
Christmas Cards, event posters, advertising or
just having a laugh with some speech balloons,
PaintShop Pro’s text tools will help you get the job
done.
• Text works in a fundamentally different way from
photos
–
the
shapes
are
described
by
mathematical formulae, rather than being just a
bunch of pixels. Objects, including text, that are
produced like this are called vector graphics, and
380

this chapter starts out with an explanation of the
difference between pixel-based things like photos
(sometimes called bitmap or raster images) and
vectors.
• As well as the Text tool, PaintShop Pro has a
range of tools for creating geometric and irregular
shapes. You’ll learn how to use all of these
including the all-powerful Pen tool which can be
used to draw any shape that you can imagine.
• As well as creating text, this chapter shows you
how you can manipulate it. You can apply any of
the filter effects to text providing you first convert
it to a raster layer. PaintShop Pro X6’s Layer
Effects have no such limitations and you’ll find out
how to use these to good effect to produce
striking and impactful typography. You’ll also
discover how to make text follow any path –
around a circle, or along a wavy line, for example,
and how to distort letter shapes to create your
own type forms.
• At
the
end
of
the
chapter,
you’ll
find
a
step-by-step project that shows how to create a
text effect using text as a selection.
How Text and Vectors Work
Up to now, nearly everything we’ve done in PaintShop
Pro has involved manipulating pixels. Text and vector
objects work in a different way to pixel-based images,
and
this
provides
them
with
some
advantages.
Whereas a pixel-based bitmap is composed of many
individual dots, each described in terms of its red,
green and blue component values, vector objects and
text are mathematically defined shapes. The object’s
381

properties are defined, and from these, the computer
constructs them. A circle, for example, might be
described in terms of its radius, stroke weight and
color, and fill. The user isn’t necessarily aware of this
and just uses the available Shape tools and the
Materials palette to draw the required shape or the
Text tool to enter type.
Vectors have two distinct advantages over bitmaps.
Because they need minimal data to describe them,
they take up very little memory and disk space. And
because they are generated by the computer, they
are resolution independent, which is another way of
saying you can make them as big as you like with no
loss in quality.
Vectors also have their limitations. They’re a good
way of producing regular shapes like letterforms,
geometric shapes and even irregular curvy shapes,
but
they’re
not
great
at
representing
real-world
textured, detailed scenes, which is why we need the
pixels for photographic images. For this reason,
vectors tend to be confined to type and 2D illustration
with
flat
color
or
mathematically
predictable
gradations.
Adding Basic Text
PaintShop Pro’s Text tool is used to add text to any
type of document, whether photo, vector illustration or
scan. Choose the Text tool from the Tools toolbar and
double-click anywhere in the document. If you’re
using an earlier version of PaintShop Pro, this will
open the Text Entry dialog box. Type what you want
in this box, click OK and watch as the text appears
somewhere in the document canvas.
382

When you click on an image with the text tool and
begin to type in PaintShop Pro X6, text is added
directly in the image workspace (in versions prior to
X3, a text box appears and you type text into it, it’s
then added in its own layer when you click OK).
The program automatically places the text data onto a
vector layer in the Layers palette. It remains in a
vector format until you need to apply special effects to
it. If this is the case, PaintShop Pro asks you to
convert the layer from vector to raster (more on this in
the next section).
Fig 7.1 To create text select the text tool, click
anywhere in the image window and start typing. Set
the type size in either points or pixels and apply other
text
attributes
including
alignment,
direction,
antialiasing, stroke width, then click the apply button
on the Tool Options palette. Characters within a text
block can be individually styled.
383

You can format text using the tool options palette to
select the font, size, style, alignment and other
attributes. The text fill and stroke color are determined
by
the
Foreground
and
stroke
properties
and
Background
and
fill
properties
swatches
in
the
Materials palette. To apply the formatting, click the
apply changes button (the green tick) on the left of the
tool options palette or click the cancel button next to it
to exit from text editing mode without saving your text.
You won’t be able to switch tools, make any menu
selections or make any other editing changes until
you either apply or cancel your text edits.
Once you click the apply button, the text is added on
its own vector layer, but you can click on it with the
text tool and change the formatting at any time. And
by selecting just a part of the text with the cursor, you
can apply individual formatting to sections of the text.
There are a couple of other formatting controls on the
tool options palette that are worth a closer look. The
Anti-alias menu has three settings – Off, Sharp and
Smooth – that determine the amount of smoothing
applied to the edges of characters. When set to Off,
type is not anti-aliased and you can see the stepped
edges that result from the attempt at producing
curved edges with square pixels (although text is
defined by vectors, it is displayed on screen and when
you print using pixels). A smoother look is achieved
using semi-transparent pixels to fill some of the gaps.
As a general rule anti-aliased text looks much better
so, other than for very small type, you’ll usually want
to set this to either sharp or smooth.
384

The next control along determines the stroke width of
your text and can be used to produce a stoked outline
effect if you set different foreground and background
colors. For small text, it’s best to set the stroke width
to zero, though you can use a narrow stroke of the
same color as the fill to embolden text slightly. The
stroke extends in both directions – inward and
outward, so you need to take care not to overdo it and
distort
the
shape
of
the
type
characters.
Used
moderately, however, applying a stroke to text is a
great way to quickly produce a very classy-looking
text effect.
There’s one last thing on the Tool options palette I
want to look at before moving on to type effects. The
‘Create As’ dropdown menu on the Tool options
palette is set by default to Vector. This means that
when you click the apply button, the text is added as a
new vector layer in the layers palette. There are two
other options that you might also want to consider
using in some circumstances.
Selection creates a marquee selection from your text
which you can then use to create text filled with
images,
text
cut-outs
and
other
effect.
Floating
creates the text as a floating selection – it looks the
same as your vector text but is added to the image as
a
floating
selection
which
you
can
move
and
transform.
When
you
defloat
raster
text
(Selections>Defloat or Ctrl-Shift-F), it’s merged with
the underlying raster layer unless you promote it to a
layer with Selections>Promote Selection to Layer or
Ctrl-Shift-P.
Tip
385

Use the Presets button on the Tool options palette
to save frequently used text font, size alignment and
other
attributes.
You
can
then
apply
all
the
necessary text styling with a single click.
Creating text as selections is fine for a quick and easy
route to text effects, but it’s usually better to create
the text as a vector layer then make a selection from
it. That way you can easily edit the text and reselect
without having to start again from scratch. I’ll show
you the best way to do this a little later in this chapter.
Assuming you’ve created text as a vector layer, once
you click the apply button, the text appears with
corner and edge handles and can be moved and
transformed in the usual way, by dragging the corner
handles to resize rotate
and skew. Transformed text remains editable at all
times – just select the text tool and click within the
type area.
386

Fig 7.2 Having created the text as a vector layer, it
can be transformed – here sheared and rotated, the
text remains editable throughout.
Fig 7.3 Anti-aliasing is the process of introducing
semi-transparent pixels at the edges of an object, or
text
character
to
smooth
out
jagged
edges,
or
stepping, caused by square pixels. This is more
noticeable at low resolutions, where fewer pixels are
used to make up the characters. PaintShop Pro has
three anti-aliasing options: off (left), sharp (middle)
and smooth (right).
Now that you have had practice adding text to a
picture, you’ll want to try adding special effects to jazz
up the results. In this section, we run through some
techniques for making your text look simply stunning.
Layer Styles
Layer styles make it much easier to create, edit and
apply certain special effects. You can apply Layer
styles to both raster and vector layers and they work
387

particularly well with type. When you apply a filter
effect such as the drop shadow from the Effects>3D
effects menu, the effect is added as pixels to the layer
which makes it difficult to edit. If you decide your drop
shadow is too dark or not in the right place, you have
to undo it and start over. And if you want to apply
effects filters to text you must first rasterize the layer,
that is, convert it from a vector to a bitmap or raster
layer. This makes it un-editable so, if you later
discover a spelling mistake, you’re in big trouble.
The great thing about layer styles is that they are ‘live’
editable effects. If, at any stage in the editing process
you decide you want to change the size, opacity,
position or color of your drop shadow or any other
layer style you can. What’s more you don’t have to
convert type layers to raster layers to apply layer
styles to them so you can also edit the text with the
Text tool and the layer style will automatically update.
To apply a layer style to some text, double-click the
vector layer in the Layers palette to open the Layer
Properties dialog box and click the Layer Styles tab,
click the Fit Image to Window button if you can’t see
the text in the preview. To apply a Layer Style and
access its controls click the checkbox next to it in the
list. The layer itself is also included in the layer styles
list, so you apply a layer style but make the layer itself
invisible.
388

Fig 7.4 To access Layer Styles, double-click the
layer thumbnail in the Layers palette, and select the
Layer Styles tab in the Layer Properties dialog box.
You can apply any combination of the six styles
available.
There are six Layer Styles to choose from
• Reflection
• Outer Glow
389

• Bevel
• Emboss
• Inner Glow
• Drop Shadow
Tip
Preview on image can slow things down to a crawl
with Layer Styles. Use the before and after previews
to get the job done more quickly.
You can apply more than one Layer Style at once –
for example, you might want to Emboss your text and
add a drop shadow, but be careful not to go
overboard. Once you’ve selected a Layer Style, use
the controls to change its size, opacity, position color
and any other available attributes. As with most of
PaintShop
Pro
X6’s
effects,
once
you’ve
found
settings that work well you can save them as presets
so you don’t have to rediscover them every time you
want to apply them in similar situations.

Fig 7.5 Layer styles work well with text layers. Here
I’ve combined the Emboss and Drop Shadow styles to
make the type stand out from the pig’s, er, rear end.
Special Effects Filters
With PaintShop Pro you can add a wide range of
effects to your text layers. For most actions, with the
notable exception of Layer Styles, the Vector Text
layer must first be converted to a Raster layer – a
warning dialog appears and PaintShop Pro asks you
if this is OK (if you don’t want to be asked every time,
click the ‘Don’t remind me’ checkbox from the dialog
that pops up on screen).
Select Chisel from the ‘Effects>3D Effects’ menu. The
opening dialog offers a range of control options. The
chisel effect extrudes the text shape outward. Use the
size slider to determine the extent of the extruded
effect and select one of the radio buttons to choose
391

either a solid or transparent color fill. To select a color
for the effect you can click the color swatch and use
the Color Properties dialog box. Better still, move the
cursor over the photo, and it will change to an eye
dropper tool which you can use to sample a color
from the photo itself.
Other 3D Effects for adding impact to text include:
Drop Shadow, Cut-out and Inner Bevel. Most of the
3D Effects are available as Layer Styles and, as a
general rule, where you have the option it’s better to
use a Layer Style than a filter effect. If you need to
add something slightly more esoteric, then try some of
the filters from the ‘Artistic’, ‘Art Media’, ‘Distortion’ or
‘Texture’ filter drop-downs. Any of these filters will
work on the Text layer as long as it has been
converted into a Bitmap (Raster) layer first.
Fig 7.6 Over and above regular text effects, added
via
the
Materials
palette,
it’s
possible
to
add
tremendous three-dimensional power using any of
PaintShop Pro’s filter effects. To do this, you might
have to convert the layer from vector to bitmap but
392

still, the resulting effects, as seen here, are very
impressive.
Using Filter Effects: A Warning
Though almost all the filters under the Effects menu
will have an effect on Raster Text layers, not all work
well and some may not appear to do anything at all.
The reason for this is that the filter action works
across the entire frame and not just on the text on its
own. If the filter has a global effect, then it is more
than likely to be seen on the text layer, but if it is of a
more random nature, it might or it might not. To make
it work correctly, you must first select the text and
then apply the filter action. Do this by choosing
‘Selections>From Vector Object’ or use the keyboard
shortcut ‘Ctrl+Shift+B’ and then apply the filter.
Adding Text to a Path
Adding text to a path can make for a dynamic and
interesting design and is especially useful for creating
company logos, web buttons, badges, CD and DVD
labels and the like. You can add type to shapes
created with any of PaintShop Pro’s shape tools (see
‘Vectors: Learning the Basics on p. 212), but it works
best on gently sloping curves. Anything with sharp
angles and lots of turns is unlikely to look good or
even readable.
393

Fig 7.7 To align text to a path, position the Text tool
over the object’s edge – click to enter the text when
the tool changes (1).To move the text above or below
the line enter an offset in the Text Tool Options
palette (2). You can run text along any vector path (3),
but
avoid
sharp
curves
and
sudden
direction
changes, which will render it unreadable (4).
To add text to a shape, all you need to do is first draw
the shape, then select the Text tool and position the
cursor on the edge of the shape. You’ll see the cursor
change from the normal cross-hairs with a capital A in
the bottom right quadrant to cross-hairs with an A at
45 degrees and a curved line below it. When this
happens, click on the shape and any text you type will
follow the outline of the shape.
• To move the text along the path, choose the Pick
tool and click-drag the text. The small circle icon
indicates the new start position of the text.
•
394

To raise or lower the text on the path, enter a
value in the Offset field of the Text Tool’s Options
palette. A positive value raises the text above the
path, a negative value lowers it.
• If you don’t want the path to show, either select a
transparent stroke and fill or click the Layer
Visibility icon in the Layers palette to turn it off.
• To detach text from the path, select either the text
or its path using the Pick tool and choose Detach
Object from Path from the Objects menu.
• To attach existing text to an object, select the text
with the Pick tool, Shift-select the object and
choose Fit Text to Path from the Objects menu.
Editing Text Shapes
By converting text to a vector object you can use
PaintShop Pro’s Vector Editing tools to alter the
shape of individual characters by adjusting individual
nodes. To convert text to a vector object, select it with
the Pick tool and choose Objects>Convert Text to
Curves. There are two options – you can convert the
entire text block into one vector object by choosing
Objects>Convert Text to Curves>As Single Shape.
Alternatively, Objects>Convert Text to Curves>As
Character Shapes converts each letter of the text into
a separate vector object. Once the text is converted,
select the Pen tool and click the Edit mode button in
the Tool Options palette to edit the character shapes.
395

Fig 7.8 Once text is converted to paths, you can edit
individual character shapes using the Pen tool.
Bear in mind that once the text has been converted to
curves, it can no longer be edited in the usual way, so
now is not the time to discover you’ve
made a spelling error! You can cover yourself by
duplicating the layer before converting it (make the
original text layer invisible by clicking the visibility
toggle in the layers palette), so you have the original
text to go back to if necessary. Once the text is
converted to curves, especially as individual character
shapes, you will need to pay special attention to how
the individual elements stack up in the Layers palette.
Making Selections from Text
Text selections form the basis for all kinds of effects
using photos. You can paste photos inside a text
selection, a particularly effective technique when
combined with layers. Typically, an image layer is
copied, pasted inside a selection and overlaid on top
396

of the original with the opacity reduced, the color
desaturated, or some other effect applied.
You can make a text selection directly by selecting
the Text tool and choosing Selection from the Create
As pull-down menu in the Tool Options palette. This is
useful for a quick text selection, but once the selection
is made, it can’t easily be edited. A better method is to
create the text as a vector, then choose
Selections>From Vector Object. That way, if you
decide to edit the text, even if it’s only to open up the
tracking a little, or reduce the leading, you can easily
make a new selection.
Fig 7.9 To create this text, I made a selection from it
using Selections>From vector object, then turned the
text layer’s visibility off. I pasted the background
image into the selection (Edit>Paste Into Selection),
then promoted the selection to a layer and applied the
Emboss Layer Style. Finally, I made the Background
397

layer black and white using the Black and White Film
Effects.
Vectors: Learning the Basics
Vector images are different to bitmap (raster) images.
Whereas a bitmap image is made entirely of pixels, a
vector image is made from a set of mathematical
instructions or coordinates. Advantages of vectors are
• Vectors are quick to work with.
• Vector file sizes can be small and still display a
large dimension.
• Vector
graphics
are
highly
editable
with
absolutely no loss of quality.
• They create perfectly clean, anti-aliased lines and
curves.
398

Fig 7.10 (1) Use the Symmetric Shape tool to create
highly editable polygons and stars. (2) Edit the line
style using the Tool Options palette and choose
Stroke and Fill colors from the Materials palette (3).
You can edit all of the nodes on a symmetric shape at
once (4), so it’s easy to quickly create variations on a
basic shape theme.
Fig 7.11
The Preset Shape tool is a powerful and quick way to
make
almost
any
size
or
shape
of
object
for
illustration.
399

Fig 7.12 Take this one step further, adding drop
shadows, bevels and a range of other specialist (filter)
effects
to
make
those
flat,
unexciting
shapes
something special.
Vectors, therefore, are ideal for illustrations where
scalable drawing, text and shapes are required.
PaintShop Pro’s Preset Vector Shape tool has a
myriad range of fully editable subjects in its library. If,
for example, you like the shape in one of the presets,
but not the color or edge detail, you can edit it using
its Edit palette. If you need to create your own vector
illustrations from the ground up, use the Pen tool.
400

Fig 7.13
Adding a vector shape and text to a photo. (1) Open
the photo. (2) Choose a preset shape from the
drop-down Preset Shape Tool menu. (3) Use the
handles
to
reposition
and
rescale
the
shape
if
necessary. (4) Reposition, rotate or flip the vector
shape using the Pick tool, then choose the Text tool
and enter appropriate text in the Text box (do not click
directly on the shape with the Text tool, or the text will
follow the path as illustrated on page 209) and press
‘Apply’. Once happy with the size and positioning of
the new text, use PaintShop Pro’s Drop Shadow filter
to add an effect to the speech bubble and save as a
‘.pspimage’ file.
Working with the Pen Tool
401

The Pen tool is the ultimate vector shape creation
tool. With it, illustrators and graphic designers can
create any type of shape, line or layer object they’d
care to imagine. The Pen tool gives you scope to
design
any
shape
you
can
imagine;
however,
because the shapes it creates are formed using
vectors, whatever is created remains editable at all
times.
Drawing
tools
rely
on
manual
actions
for
their
accuracy and we all know how tricky it is to try and
draw with a mouse. It’s like sketching with a house
brick, only less accurate. The Pen tool allows you to
ignore many of the physical limitations of the mouse
and to apply smooth linear accuracy to the most
delicate of shapes.
The driving force behind this is the ability to draw
using Bezier curves. These are infinitely editable lines
that can be used to describe mathematically perfect
shapes such as curves and circles. This might not be
a tool that you are likely to need but, for anything
graphic design based, like producing posters or cards,
it can be extremely useful. Check out the stack of
controls provided in the Options palette and you’ll get
an idea of how powerful this tool is. Here are some of
its most important features:
• Draw lines and shapes of any size freehand.
• Draw
a
myriad
range
of
shapes
using
point-to-point techniques.
• Fill objects with color, texture and transparency
using the Materials palette.
The Pen tool works by dropping editable nodes into
the picture, whether blank canvas or existing picture.
402

Each
mouse-click
adds
another
node
that’s
automatically joined to the previous one with a
straight or curved line, depending on the type of
drawing implement chosen. Clicking a node back onto
the original start point completes the shape. You can
add as many, or as few, nodes as needed, though the
fewer nodes you use, the smoother your shapes will
look.
The Pen tool can be used to create new vector
shapes and edit existing pictures in a wide range of
styles. You can change any aspect of the Pen tool at
any time – for example, thickness of line, color fill,
texture,
linear
aspect,
curve
aspect
and
more.
Right-clicking displays its principal attributes, which
include: Edit, Node Type and Transform Selected
Nodes. Using these allows you to perform more than
30 different edit functions.
Uses for the Pen tool:
• Creating accurate masks.
• Creating complex vector shapes and illustrative
elements using rectilinear or Bezier-controlled
lines.
• Creating perfectly curved lines around irregular
objects.
Here’s how to make a vector illustration:
Step
1.
Create
a
new
document
with
a
white
background
and
a
resolution
of
your
choice
(‘File>New’).
Step 2. Click the Pen tool icon on the Tools toolbar
and select a line style and width from the Tool
Options palette.
403

Step
3.
Select
a
line
application
–
Lines
and
Polylines, Point to Point (Bezier Curves) or Freehand,
from the Mode section of the Tool Options. You’ll
need to experiment to discover which suits the task in
hand;
see
the
notes
below
for
the
differences
between these methods.
Step 4. When you’ve drawn your path, select it with
the Pick tool to display its bounding box. The handles
on the box allow you to rotate, stretch and deform the
vector shape without losing detail. To change the
appearance
of the line, open the Layers palette, select the vector
layer and click the ‘+’ tab. This opens the Vector layer
to display the individual elements. Double-click an
element to open the Vector Properties box.
404

Fig 7.14 (1) Creating geometric shapes with the Pen
tool is easy – but you can use the Symmetric Shape
tool
for
that.
(2)
Change
node
properties
by
right-clicking or (3) create curves of any shape by
405

click-dragging. (4) Use the Pen tool to trace shapes
from photo layers.
Note the following:
• ‘Draw Lines and Polylines’ draws straight lines
between two points.
• ‘Draw Point to Point – Bezier Curve’ is an
infinitely
editable
freeform
line
controlled
by
Bezier technology – grab a controlling handle to
bend the line any which way. Bezier curves are
ideal for creating seamless freehand shapes.
• ‘Draw Freehand’ is the same as drawing on a
piece of paper.
406

Step-by-Step Projects
Creating a Type Special Effect with Text Selections
As we saw earlier in this chapter, Effects filters don’t
work
with
Vector
layers,
which
must
first
be
rasterized. The same thing goes for text, which by
default is rendered as a Vector layer. One of the
easiest ways to create stunning type effects, however,
is to make a selection from your type and then apply
the effect to an image using that selection. Here we’re
going to produce a beveled glass type effect in four
steps.
The success of type effects like this depends very
much on choosing the right typeface. The Inner Bevel
filter works well on big bold type. So avoid script fonts
or anything with fine detail and keep the word count to
a minimum – make a bold one-word statement.
407

STEP 1 Open your image and create a copy of the
background layer by right-clicking it in the Layers
palette and selecting Duplicate.
STEP 2 Select the Text tool, click on the image and
enter the type. For maximum effect, keep it short –
one or two words at most – and use a bold typeface;
use capital letters for improved readability and make
the type as large as you can. Click the Apply button in
the Tool options palette when you are happy with how
it looks, then position the type where you want it on
the background with the Move tool.
408

STEP
3
Choose
Selections>From
Vector
Object
(keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B), then turn off the
Type layer by clicking its Layer visibility toggle (the
eye)
in
the
Layers
palette.
Click
the
Copy
of
Background layer in the Layers palette to make it
active.
409

STEP 4 Choose Effects>3D Effects>Inner Bevel and
apply the filter using the default settings. Click the
Preview icon to see the result in the main image
window. You can experiment with angle, smoothness,
depth and other settings, or try one of the available
presets, but the default setting gives a pretty good
result. Click OK to apply the bevel, then press Ctrl-D
to deselect all.

Chapter 8
Special Effects
Advanced Editing Techniques
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• In this chapter, you’ll learn how to add special
effects to your digital photos. Applying a special
effects filter may be all that’s needed to turn a
so-so image into something special. But with a
little more effort, you can create jaw-dropping
effects that defy reality – or what passes for
reality in a photo.
• This chapter really covers two things; the first half
is all about PaintShop Pro X6’s painting and
drawing tools, and the remainder explains how to
create special effects.
• If you want to create illustrations from scratch,
you’ll
need
to
familiarize
yourself
with
the
workings of the Materials palette and PaintShop
Pro’s Brush tools. All of this is explained in detail
412

in the next few pages. Creating illustration from a
blank canvas can be a demanding task, even if
you’re a competent illustrator, but by using a
photo as a source image and painting over it
using layers you can achieve professional looking
results. PaintShop Pro’s Art Media tools mimic
real-world materials like oils and pastels, and
you’ll learn how to use these to turn photos into
paintings.
• Later in the chapter, you’ll find a comprehensive
run-down ofPaintShop Pro’s filter effects, where
to find them and how to use them. You’ll discover
how to use the Deformation tools to distort photos
as well as how to correct distortion caused by
ultra-wide
angle
lenses
using
the
distortion
correction filters.
• Special effect filters and distortion tools are often
knocked for not being very ‘useful’. That’s not a
criticism you could apply to PaintShop Pro X6’s
lighting effects which allow you to add lighting to a
photo after you’ve taken it. Lighting effects are
great for adding spotlights or colored lighting to a
scene, or simply to shine some illumination and
add depth to a picture that suffers from flat
featureless light. Turn to page 244 to find out
how.
• There are lots of step-by-step projects at the end
of this chapter. We kick off with a look at how to
make type follow the contours of a surface as if
it’s been painted on. Following this advanced
project.
• We’ll tackle something a bit simpler – having a bit
of fun with PaintShop Pro’s Picture Tube and
413

adding edges and frames to your photos. The
final step-by-step project in this chapter shows
you how to respray your car using the Color
Changer tool.
Using the Materials Palette
One of the most used palettes in PaintShop Pro is the
Materials palette. This is where you change the colors
used in any of the program’s paint or drawing tools. In
this section, we look at how the Materials palette can
be used in the creation of special effects and how it’s
used for mixing colors.
Choose
the
Materials
palette
from
the
‘View
>
Palettes’ menu (keyboard shortcut F6). There are
three modes in which to work with this tool: Frame,
Rainbow and Swatch modes.
The Frame mode provides a quick and fairly intuitive
method of picking colors. First left-click to select a
foreground
hue
from
the
outer
hue
rectangle
(right-click to select a background color), then click in
the inner saturation rectangle to alter the saturation
and brightness for the selected hue. If you hold down
the mouse button and drag within the Saturation
rectangle, the value updates and a tool tip window
tells you the RGB values at the cursor position.
Alternatively, you can fine-tune the saturation and
brightness by adjusting the triangular sliders at the
bottom and side of the Saturation rectangle.
On the Rainbow tab, position the cursor over the
central colors panel; it changes to an eyedropper and
a tool tip window displays the RGB values of the color
beneath. Left-click to select the foreground color and
414

right-click
to
select
the
background
color.
The
Rainbow tab only needs one click to select a color,
but provides less accuracy than the Frame tab.
If you’re working with a limited palette, you may find
Swatch mode simpler to use because you can make
your own swatches. In many ways, it’s faster and
more accurate to work with.

three modes can be added texture or transparency
using the appropriate buttons. Two smaller colored
boxes

• If you are happy with a particular combination in
the palette, click the ‘All tools’ checkbox to lock it
and to apply the settings to all the tools.

parameters (for example, the start and end colors of a
gradient), you can choose and apply a texture.

422

Fig 8.8 And with patterns too.
Working with Brush Tools
PaintShop Pro comes with a staggering array of
brushes and brush tips, enabling the user to create a
range of simple, or incredibly sophisticated, painting
tasks. Brush tools introduce the photographer to the
concept of original creativity – you can literally make
something from nothing using one of PaintShop Pro’s
brushes (in the same way that you might with a
crayon and a blank sheet of paper).
423

Fig 8.9 PaintShop Pro’s Paint Brush can produce a
staggering array of effects, textures and ‘looks’ simply
by changing its tool set in the Options and Materials
palettes. There are over 20 preset stock tips that vary
greatly in each brush.
424

Fig 8.10
This is a very ordinary snap of a very pretty rose.
There are a number of preset filter effects that I could
apply to the entire photo or even to a selection.
However, it is also possible to make quite radical
changes merely by using a brush on the canvas. (1)
Open the photo and enlarge the canvas to add a
white border all round the edges. (2) Duplicate the
layer. (3) Desaturate the color. Reduce it almost to
black and white.
Use the Tool Options palette to change the physical
nature of all brushes. Use the Materials palette to
choose different brush colors as well as textures and
gradients in the brush action. Simply paint over the
image to add texture and additional color.
One
way
to
use
this
process
is
to
add
a
non-photographic influence to a picture in order to
create the illusion that it’s something other than a
plain
old
photo.
The
most
important
thing
to
remember when you’re doing this kind of work is to
select a blend mode from the Brush Tool options
palette that doesn’t completely obscure the underlying
425

detail, but allows it to show through your brush
strokes.
Brush tools are variable in terms of size, density,
opacity and hardness. It’s much easier to get good
results using a graphics tablet rather than a mouse. A
graphics tablet allows you to draw, select, erase and
paint with the accuracy and delicacy of a real
paintbrush,
pencil
or
crayon.
Using
the
Brush
Variance
palette
(F11),
you
can
assign
brush
properties like size, opacity and thickness to vary
according to how much pressure you apply, or, if your
stylus supports it, the degree of tilt or rotation. The
bottom line is it’s much more natural working with a
stylus and you have a lot more control than with a
mouse.
Besides
the
Paint
Brush
and
Airbrush
tools,
PaintShop Pro has a number of other brush-based
tools
designed
specifically
for
working
on
a
photographic
image
for
the
purposes
of
adding
impact. These are:
• Dodge tool. Lightens pixels under the brush –
good for extracting detail in dark areas.
• Burn tool. Darkens the pixels under the brush.
Ideal
for
increasing
density
in
overexposed
pictures.
• Smudge brush. Blurs and smudges the pixels
under the brush action.
• Push. Makes all the pixels behave just like wet oil
paint so that they can literally be pushed about
the frame
• Soften. Applies a localized soft focus effect.
426

• Sharpen. Increases the contrast, and therefore
the apparent sharpness in the pixels.
Fig 8.11 The textured effect can also be applied to
the edges. Work at a lowered opacity to produce a
seamless effect. Too fast and the brush marks
become heavy and tell-tale, which is not usually
desirable.

427

Fig 8.12 Use the Brush Options palette to change the
properties of the brush tip. When over painting
choose a blend mode like Overlay, or soft light that
will interact with the detail on the image below, rather
than
completely
obscuring
it.
Use
the
Materials
palette to choose different brush colors as well as
textures and gradients in the brush action. Simply
paint over the image to add texture and additional
color.
Like the Paint Brush, PaintShop Pro’s Airbrush also
has potential for terrific creativity. Once you hit on one
combination, record it as a preset for use on other
images.
Using the Art Media Brushes
PaintShop Pro X6 has a range of Brush tools called
the Art Media tools. These tools are a radical
departure from the usual kind of digital brush tool in
that they mimic the behavior of real-world materials
like oil paint and pastels.
428

Altogether there are nine Art Media tools: Oil, Chalk,
Pastel, Crayon, Colored Pencil, Marker, Palette Knife,
Smear and Art Eraser. These tools can only be used
on special Art Media layers; a new Art Media layer is
automatically created for you when you start to paint
with one of the Art Media tools.
Two of the Art Media brushes – Oil and Marker – are
‘wet’; they simulate the wetness of their real-world
counterparts. With a ‘normal’ PaintShop Pro brush, if
you paint by holding down the mouse button, or
maintain pressure on the
stylus tip, the paint just keeps on coming, but with a
wet Art Media brush it runs out, just like the real thing.
You have to finish the stroke and start a new one with
a reloaded brush. Oil and Marker strokes stay wet, so
if you paint over them with a new color the paint
smears on the canvas.
429

Fig 8.13 PaintShop Pro’s Mixer palette works like the
real thing, allowing you to partially mix colors and
apply a smeared combination with the Oil Brush or
Marker tool. (a) Mixer Tube. (b) Mixer Knife. (c) Mixer

fly-out (1) and use the Tool Options palette (2) to set
brush parameters. Head loading determines how
much paint is on the brush and how quickly it will run
out. Click the Trace checkbox to automatically sample
the color from underlying layers. Add color to the
Mixer palette (3) using the Mixer Tube and mix the
hues together with the Mixer Knife. Sampling an area
of the Mixer palette with the Mixer Dropper adds the
mix to the Foreground/Stroke swatch in the Materials
palette (4) – now you’re ready to paint.
Another aspect of real media that these wet brushes
emulate is the ability to paint with multiple colors. A
real brush might have mostly blue paint on it with a
little bit of yellow, producing a smeared blue/green
color, and you can simulate this effect with the Oil
Brush and Marker tool. There’s also a Mixer palette
on which you can smear colors around and produce a
messy mix of several colors to load onto your brush.
431

When using the Oil brush or the Palette Knife, the
size of the area sampled from the Mixer palette is
determined by the brush size setting in the Tool
Options palette, so the bigger your brush, the more
paint variation you can have. For other Art Media
tools, set the sample size using the Mixer palette’s
Size slider, up and down arrows, or enter in a value
with your keyboard.
When using the wet painting tools, painting over
existing strokes causes them to smear. You can ‘dry’
an Art Media layer, or make it wet again at any time
by choosing Layers > Dry Art Media Layer or Layers >
Wet Art Media Layer.
You can save and load Mixer palette pages and
switch between them by choosing Save Page and
Load Page from the Mixer Palette menu.
Deformation Tools
Altering the shape or alignment of a layer is easy
using PaintShop Pro’s Deformation tools. Why use
the Deformation tools?
• To change the alignment of a layer.
• To modify the size of the layer.
• To modify the perspective and skew of a layer.
• To
significantly
change
the
appearance
ofa
picture.
There are four to choose from:
• Pick
tool
–
used
for
relatively
simple
layer
changes.
• Straighten
tool
–
especially
handy
for
straightening horizons.
432

• Perspective
Correction
tool
–
for
adding
exaggerated
(or
corrective)
perspective
to
objects.
• Mesh Warp – Mesh Warp gives you the freedom
to bend, distort, warp and buckle up to 31
sections within a layer.
Transforming layers with the Pick tool is simple
enough: open the document and select the layer that
needs transforming. Choose the Pick tool from the
Tools toolbar. Note the bounding box and ‘handles’
that appear at the corners of the layer. If you hold the
cursor
over
any
of
these
handles,
the
normal
four-pointed
arrow
Move
symbol
changes
to
a
rectangle, indicating that you can scale the layer while
maintaining its original proportions. If you don’t want
to maintain the original proportions, in other words to
stretch or squeeze the layer, drag one of the handles
located on an edge midway between the corners.
433

Fig 8.15
Hold down the Ctrl key and drag a corner handle to
apply a perspective distortion using the Pick tool.
You can further change the type of the deforming
action by holding down the Shift key for a shear action
or by holding the Control key to change it to
Perspective Deform. The handle in the center which
resembles a stroked circle moves all the contents in
the bounding box. The Rotation Handle to the right of
this (pre-rotation) rotates the layer. Use similar mouse
actions
to
directly
change
the
perspective
(Perspective Correction tool) and to align the horizon
(Straighten
tool).
Advanced
users
can
use
the
Deformation tools to manipulate selected layers to
create super-real perspective effects or to add extra
realism such as shadows to product photos.
Lens Correction Filters
434

PaintShop Pro also has a range of filter effects
specifically designed for correcting lens distortion
found in less expensive and extreme wide angle
lenses. They can be used to straighten out the
curvature at the edges of the frame that you get with
extreme wide angle lenses. You’ll find them at the
bottom
of
the
Adjust
menu.
Like
all
the
other
PaintShop Pro X6 filters, the lens distortion dialog box
provides the option of previewing the result on the
image, or displaying before and after thumbnail
previews.
The easiest way to find out if your lens suffers from
this kind of distortion is to take a photo of something
that has a grid pattern – like a brick wall for example.
In fact, if you’re going to correct for barrel or pin
cushion distortion this kind of image will help you
judge exactly how much correction to apply using the
strength slider. Once you’ve done that you can save
the settings as a preset, so that it can easily be
applied in future.
Believe it or not, there’s also a filter for introducing
these kinds of distortions (it works in pretty much the
same way as the corrections) which you’ll find on
Effects > Distortion Effects > Lens Distortions. Use
the settings pull-down menu to select the type of lens
distortion
you
want
to
produce.
There
are
four
options: Barrel, Fisheye, Fisheye (spherical) and
Pincushion.
Tip
Many
criteria
come
into
play
to
influence
the
success or failure of a filter effect. Factors include
435

the quality, focus, color and contrast in the original
snap. Don’t use a filter to mask the fact that a snap
is no good – because the filter effect will invariably
be no good either!
Less expensive lenses often suffer from slight barrel
or pincushion distortion but, unless straight lines are
important to you, it can usually be ignored. Barrel
distortion bows straight lines outward toward the edge
of the frame, pincushion is the opposite – the lines
bow inwards toward the center.
436

Fig 8.16 PaintShop Pro X6 has three distortion
correction filters – Barrel, Cushion and Fisheye –
designed
to
correct
for
lens
distortions.
These
distortions are often found in less expensive lenses,
but they are usually quite minor and difficult to spot.
Very wide angle lenses though, and in particular,
‘fisheye’ lenses with a 180-degree field of view, suffer
from severe barrel distortion. The original (top left)
was shot with an ultra-wide angle lens – notice how
the straight lines, e.g. the lighting rail and skirting
board, curve toward the edges of the image. The
437

Fisheye Distortion Correction filter does an excellent
job of straightening everything out.
Applying Filter Effects
PaintShop Pro has many filters, designed not only to
improve the quality of your work but also to radically
change the nature of the picture. For example, you
can
increase
or
decrease
color,
contrast,
hue,
sharpness and tones in a photo at the press of a
button. These filters are regarded as ‘standard issue’
for most photo-editing products. PaintShop Pro also
has a range of creative filter effects that can the
nature of a photo from a straight photographic record
into something different, like a drawing, painting or
even a sketch. In fact, with a bit of patience, you can
create almost any type of special effect you care to
think of, such is the power of the software filter set.
Tip
Effects filters usually work best when applied to one
part of an image, e.g. to text, or a specific area. You
can use the selection tools and masks to achieve
this and there’s a step-by-step project that shows
how
to
apply
filter
effects
using
masks
at
www.gopaintshoppro.co.uk
PaintShop Pro has dozens of filters. The program is
also compliant with range of plug-in type filters. These
are manufactured by third parties, like Flaming Pear
and Auto F/X. These are loaded into the Effects menu
just as if they were original integral products.
438

Fig 8.17 This is what the Filter Effect Browser looks
like. You can make it display a thumbnail of every
filter in PaintShop Pro, or you can be a bit more
specific by choosing filters from individual subsets.
Double-click the window that you like the look of to
apply that filter to an image.
Most of PaintShop Pro’s filters are subdivided into
types under the Effects menu. These include:
• 3D Effects
• Art Media Effects
• Artistic Effects
• Distortion Effects
• Edge Effects
• Geometric Effects
• Illumination Effects
• Image Effects
• Photo Effects
• Reflection Effects
439

• Texture Effects
• User Defined.
The User Defined Filter opens a dialog box where you
can enter parameters to define your own filter. It’s not
very easy to work out though and I’m not going to say
any more about it here, but feel free to experiment.
You’ll also find more filters under the Adjust menu.
These include:
• Add/Remove Noise
• Blur
• Sharpness
• Softness
• Red-eye Removal
There’s also a filter Effects Browser which previews
all the filter effects as thumbnails so that if you’ve no
idea what to use, you can make an educated,
illustrated guess.
Tip
If you hit on a filter effect that works really well, save
it as a preset that you can later apply to other
images with a single click. Click the Save Preset
button (the disk icon) at the top of the Filter dialog
box.
Each filter sub-folder contains effects that can be
applied to any picture globally, to a layer in that
document or to a specific selection. For example, Art
Media filter effects include: ‘Black Pencil’, ‘Brush
Strokes’, ‘Charcoal’, ‘Colored Chalk’, ‘Colored Pencil’
and ‘Pencil’. Select any of these and the dialog that
440

appears offers further refinements to the filter action.
Some are quite basic while others have a range of
controls.
The Effects browser is the best way to check out all of
the available filters. But PaintShop Pro X5 introduced
another feature called the Instant Effects palette, if
you’re working with PaintShop Pro X5 or X6 you can
find out more about the Instant Effects palette below.
The Instant Effects Palette
The
Instant
Effects
palette
contains
thumbnails
showing preset effects available in PaintShop Pro X5
and X6 organized into categories. It appears by
default in the Adjust workspace, if you want to display
it in either of the other workspaces just select View >
Palettes > Instant Effects or press Shift F2.
You won’t find the effects shown in the Instant Effects
palette in the Effects Browser or the Effects menu.
That’s because they are presets, applications of those
filters using specific settings that have been saved.
These effects would ordinarily take you a while to
create, experimenting with the settings in the various
individual effects until you find something that works.
Here, the hard work has been done for you and you
can apply the effects ‘instantly’ with no messing
around. To apply one of the effects from the Instant
Effects palette, just double-click its thumbnail.
441

Fig 8.18 The Instant Effects palette.
When you create and save your own presets they are
added to the Instant Effects palette in the User
Defined category. I’ll explain how that works shortly,
for now to apply an effect just double-click it. If you
don’t like the result, just press Ctrl-z to undo it and try
another. As I’ve said, instant effects are arranged in
categories, there are Artistic effects, ones for black
and white conversions, film styles, those designed for
landscapes and portraiture, and so on. If you don’t
want to scroll through them all you can display a
442

single category by selecting it from the pull-down
menu at the top of the palette.
As you make use of the Instant Effects palette, you’ll
notice that your most recently used instant effects are
added to their own category called, strangely enough,
‘Recently used’, at the top of the palette. There’s
another group right at the bottom of the Instant Effects
palette that’s influenced by the filters you use called
‘User Defined’. Scroll down to the bottom of the
palette, or select it from the Instant Effects palette
category pull-down menu and you’ll see that, unless
you’ve previously created your own filter presets, it’s
currently empty.
With a photo open in the Edit workspace, choose one
of the filters from the Effects menu, for the example in
Fig 8.19 I’ve used the Halftone effect (Effects >
Artistic Effects > Halftone) and altered the settings to
produce the effect I’m looking for. Next click the disk
icon on the effect preview window to save the effect
you’ve just created as a preset and click OK to save
it. Now that this effect is saved as a preset you can
apply it at any time just by selecting it from the preset
pull-down menu in the dialog box for the Halftone
effect. But there’s an even easier way.
443

Fig
8.19 Any
filters
you
save
as
presets
are
automatically added to the User Defined section at
the bottom of the Instant Effects palette. Remember
though, you have to exit and restart PaintShop Pro X6
before they appear.
Now that the effect is saved, hit the cancel button to
exit the effect dialog box without applying it to the
image. If you take a look in the User Defined section
of the Instant Effects palette (press shift-F2 to display
the Instant Effects palette in the Edit workspace) you’ll
see it’s still empty, or at least it doesn’t contain your
new preset. To get it to appear you’ll first have to shut
down PaintShop Pro and restart it. Not an ideal state
of affairs, but the Instant Effects palette is populated
from the scripts that produce the effects when you
start the program, so there’s currently no way around
it. With the program restarted, you’ll see you’re new
444

preset thumbnail in the User Defined section of the
Instant effects palette. Now all you have to do to apply
your new effect preset to any currently open photo is
double-click it.
Using Plug-ins
The last item on the Effects menu is Plug-ins and this
lists any third-party plug-ins you may have installed.
Plug-ins are a great way to add to PaintShop Pro’s
features and there’s a wide range available including
lots of special effects. If you register your copy of
PaintShop Pro with Corel, you can get a Free copy of
the KPT Collection of filter effects. And if you bought
PaintShop Pro X6 Ultimate, that includes two plug-in
filters, Perfectly Clear by Athentech Imaging and
Reallusion FaceFilter 3.
To install any of these plug-ins, you simply run the
installer which places the files needed for the plug-in
in the appropriate folder. To find out where that is
select File > Preferences > File Locations and select
Plug-ins from the list on the left. Note that plug-ins
and their location are specific to the 32- and 64-bit
versions
of
PaintShop
Pro.
Some
plug-ins
are
designed to work with the newer 64-bit version of the
program, others will only work with the 32-bit version
of PaintShop Pro. So it’s important to install the right
version. Some vendors, Like Athentech, mentioned
above provide plug-ins for both versions of PaintShop
Pro which are automatically installed. So if you’ve
bought PaintShop Pro Ultimate and installed Perfectly
Clear, it’ll appear in both the 32- and 64-bit versions
of PaintShop Pro X6. The KPT collection on the other
hand is 32-bit only.
445

Why is it worth knowing where your plug-ins are
located? Because not all of them have installers, but
instead are supplied as .8bf files which you need to
drop straight into your plug-ins folder (the right
plug-ins folder, remember, there are different ones for
32- and 64-bit plug-ins). Once any plug-in is installed,
whatever the method, it’ll appear at the bottom of the
Effects menu.

Adding Lighting Effects
PaintShop Pro has a very powerful feature that allows
you to add real studio lighting-type effects after the
shot has been taken. It’s a pretty cool filter-type effect
that, when used with care, can add depth to an
otherwise flat or lackluster picture. You’ll find it on the
Effects menu – Effects > Illumination Effects > Lights.
450

Fig 8.24 Lighting effects allow the image-maker to
add lighting effect to the shot after it has been
captured. This is done via a clever combination of
directional contrast and brightness enhancements,
simulating the effect of a floodlight or a spotlight.
Though you should never use this as a substitute for
shooting a frame properly, the addition of a lighting
effect like the ones seen here can make or break a
picture that is not as strong as it possibly could be.
The first step is to use the Histogram Adjustment
dialog to improve the tones and contrast in the photo.
451

Fig 8.25
The Lights dialog box displays a before and after
preview. Drag the lights in the ‘before’ thumbnail to
position them and alter their ‘cone size’ – narrower
angles produce a spotlight effect, broader angles a
more diffuse style of light. There are five lights in all,
but two, or at most three, will be adequate; uncheck
the ‘on’ box to turn unwanted lights off. Here, I’ve
used a spotlight (cone size 11) to illuminate the
keyboard from a low angle and a more diffuse light
above for the sheet music. You need to be careful not
to overdo the intensity and create ‘blown’ highlights
with no detail. Often, the best way to avoid this and
produce creative lighting setups is to position the
lights outside the image shining onto it.
PaintShop Pro offers several light sources, exactly as
you’d have in a real photo studio. Click on one and
you’ll be able to edit its behavior – widening or
narrowing the spread of light has the effect of
increasing or spreading the flood of light onto the
452

picture. A narrow beam intensifies the concentration
of added light, so take care not to ‘overdo’ this;
otherwise, you’ll end up adding overblown highlights
that take away from the subject matter. A little, in this
case, will always produce a better result. The great
thing about this tool is that its five light sources are
infinitely adjustable. If you only need one or two lights,
switch the others off by lowering their intensities to a
zero value. Take care though, because you might end
up spending a lot of time moving the ‘lights’ around
the studio floor (i.e. the canvas). Keeping it simple will
produce realistic and genuine improvements to any
picture.

Step-by-Step Projects
Creating Realistic Depth Effects Using Displacement
Maps
The displacement map effect was introduced in
PaintShop Pro 9. Displacement maps have been a
feature
of
that
other
professional
image-editing
application (OK, Photoshop!) for some time, but even
professionals are often at a loss to know what to do
with this effect. This is a shame, because you can use
displacement maps to create amazingly realistic 3D
overlay effects.
Let’s say, for example, you want to overlay some type
on a heavily textured background – a brick wall, or a
rocky cliff face – but you want it to look like it’s been
painted on, following the contours of the surface
below, rather than floating on top the way a normal
text layer would. Displacement maps allow you to do
just that.
454

STEP 1 Open the base image (the rock face, or your
own textured backdrop) in PaintShop Pro and resave
it as a copy (File > Save Copy As) into the folder
containing PaintShop Pro’s displacement maps. To
find out the location of the displacement maps folder
choose File > Preferences > File Locations.
STEP 2 Add the type, the bigger and bolder the
better. Here, I’ve added two layers, so that the
number
‘X’
can
be
sized
and
positioned
independently. Right-click the Type layers in the
Layers
palette
and
select
Duplicate
from
the
contextual menu.
STEP 3 Select the duplicated Type layer in the Layer
palette and choose Convert to Raster Layer from the
Layers menu. If you used more than one Type layer,
turn all the other layers off by clicking their Layer
Visibility button (eye icon) in the Layers palette and
455

choose Layers > Merge > Merge Visible to combine
them. Double-click the merged layer and rename it
‘Type’ in the Layer Properties dialog box.
STEP 4 Turn the background layer back on, make
sure the Type layer is selected and choose Effects >
Distortion Effects > Displacement map. Click the
Displacement Map button underneath the ‘before’
thumbnail,
make
sure
All
is
selected
from
the
category pull-down menu and locate the copy image
you saved in Step 1.
456

STEP 5 You should now see the type deform in the
preview window. The displacement map moves pixels
in the target image depending on the value of
corresponding pixels in the map. There are two
buttons in the Displacement Map pane that allow you
to stretch or tile the map, but our map is the same
image, and therefore, the same size as the target, so
we don’t need to bother with these.
Tip
You can use the background from the current image
as a displacement map if you turn off visibility for all
the other layers. But make sure you have the
(invisible) Type layer selected before you apply the
displacement effect.
457

Tip
Sometimes you can get a more realistic overlay
effect by switching the layers around and placing the
Background layer on top of the Type layer and
choosing an appropriate Blend mode. You’ll need to
promote the background layer to a full layer to do
this.
STEP 6 In all likelihood, the default settings won’t
produce a satisfactory distortion; there will either be
458

too little or too much. There are two ways to control
this. First, click the 3D Surface radio button in the
Displacement
Properties
pane
and
change
the
intensity. The Displacement Map dialog box only
shows the Type layer. If you want to see the effect
overlaid on your background image click the Proof
button (the eye icon). Clicking the Auto Proof button
will update the proof each time you make a change,
but this can be quite time-consuming, especially with
larger images.
STEP 7 Generally, it’s sufficient for the type to deform
along
the
larger
cracks
and
fissures
in
our
background image, but ordinarily every little detail
would produce unwanted distortions. The effect of the
459

finer detail can be reduced by blurring the image.
Drag the Blur slider until only the edges of the type
are deformed and appear to be following the contours
of the background image. Using trial-and-error, find
the best combination of Blur and Intensity and, when
you’re happy with the result, click OK.
STEP 8 The type is now following the contours of the
rock, but it doesn’t look painted on and has an
unnaturally flat look. Real paint would show through
some of the rock texture and detail. You can create
this effect using a Layer Blend mode; here I’ve set the
Blend mode for the Type layer to Burn. Hard Light,
Color and Multiply are also worth trying – different
images
require
different
approaches.
Sometimes,
reducing the layer opacity helps heighten the realism
of the effect.
460

STEP 9 PaintShop Pro X6 has an assortment of
ready-made displacement maps, including geometric
patterns and texture photos which you can use to
distort images. You can also make your own – save
them in the Displacement Map folder or use the File
Locations button on the Displacement Map dialog box
to add a folder of displacement maps. Greyscale
images work best. Mid-grey pixels produce least
distortion; black and white pixels distort pixels in the
target image the most.
461

STEP 10 This technique can be used to apply all
kinds of images to all kinds of surfaces. You can use
it for lighting effects – to make a laser beam deform
as it passes over objects; to produce realistic shadow
effects; and to superimpose designs onto all kinds of
backgrounds from crumpled material to water.
How to Create a Picture Tube File
PaintShop Pro’s Picture Tube tool is one of the
weirdest around. What does it do? The Picture Tube
literally ‘pours’ pictures out of a tube onto the canvas.
Using graphics and photos as ‘liquid paint’ rather than
flat color is an interesting concept, but it’s one of
462

those esoteric type tools that’s almost impossible to
find a proper use for. Unless, of course, you create
your own specific Picture Tube files.
Use the Picture Tube to have fun, create borders and
even to decorate artwork destined for the inkjet
printer.
PictureTube applications:
• Creating fun effects.
• Cool edges and borders for pictures.
• Making unusual picture frame effects.
• Entertaining your kids (and yourself).
• Creating textured backgrounds.
• Adding specific, custom views to a picture (such
as image grain, noise and even textures).
STEP 1 Open the pictures chosen to be in the set,
ensuring that they are dust-free and clear from JPEG
artifacts (use PaintShop Pro’s JPEG Artifact Removal
filter to do this). Ensure that all pictures are a similar
resolution and physical dimension.
STEP 2 Create a new document (‘File > New’) with a
transparent background to accommodate the picture
463

elements.
For
example,
if
you
are
making
a
four-image Picture Tube, set the fields to 800 pixels
wide and 200 high. Choose ‘Transparent’ as the
background color and then click ‘OK’.
STEP 3 Open PaintShop Pro’s Rulers palette (‘View >
Rulers’) and drag the guideline to the 200 pixel mark.
Drag another to the 400 pixel mark and a third to the
600 pixel mark.
The Picture Tube icons can be of different sizes and
randomness. Shift-clicking creates a point-to-point
straight line.
STEP 4 You should now have a document with a
transparent background (a checkbox pattern indicates
transparency) with colored grid lines dividing a long,
wide frame into four sections. Copy and paste (Edit >
Paste as New Layer) the four pictures into this
document. At this stage, it’s a good idea to save a
copy of the file in case the resulting tube is no good.
Give it a unique name and save it as a ‘.pspimage’
(layered) file for later use.
464

STEP 5 Merge all the layers (‘Layers > Merge
Visible’) that PaintShop Pro has created (don’t flatten
this as it will produce a default background color
which is not required at this stage). Once merged, the
four pictures should be sitting on a single layer that
has a transparent background.
Tip
In the Picture Tube Tool Options palette, you can
control the scale of the Picture Tube elements, the
frequency of their placement and selection modes
(how they are placed from the file).
STEP 6 Select ‘File > Export > Picture Tube’ and
another dialog opens. Enter the amount of cells that
you have made for the tube (in this case, four). Make
a unique name for the tube and click ‘OK’. To test the
tube, create a new document with a white background
(any size and resolution will suffice) and select the
Picture Tube tool. Open its Options palette and, after
pressing the Image Selection tab, scroll through the
preset tube files to find your alphabetically placed file.
Select this and paint away to test the tube.
465

By setting the randomness to a high value and
reducing the frequency, you can use the tube to paint
individual objects one at a time over the canvas.
You can use the tube to create cartoon-like effects.
Download
new
tubes
from
the
Corel
website’s
community page.
466

Another use for the tube is to create backgrounds If
necessary, lower the opacity on the layer, so that text
can be read more clearly over the top.
You’ll soon discover whether the selections you
made, the scale of the images and their colors are
attractive or not. If you are not happy with the result
it’s simple enough to open the ‘.pspimage’ version
again, make changes, save it over the previous tube
file and try again.
While a few photo-purists might swear at the Picture
Tube, there are still a heap of devotees that swear by
it. So many that there are entire websites dedicated to
its use, offering loads of free tubes. Start by visiting
Corel’s site for further resources and downloads at
www.corel.com.
Tip
If you don’t want the frame to cover part of your
picture, select ‘Frame outside of the image’ in the
Picture
Frame
dialog
box.
PaintShop
Pro
will
467

automatically increase the canvas to make space for
the frame. This option is particularly useful with the
larger frames.
Adding Edge and Framing Effects
PaintShop Pro gives you the power to not only add
frames to any picture you import into the program, but
also to add a great range of frame edges using the
Picture Frame tool.
PaintShop Pro’s Picture Frame tool is fantastic,
providing a great range of paint style edges (among
others) that normally would take hours to create. Why
use edges? Photographers live in a rectangular world,
so it is great that we can now change that to recreate
the look of a painted or sketched edge, film, crayon,
and heaps more edges. If you habitually work with the
program’s
specialist
filter
effects,
you’ll
find
this
extremely useful.
STEP 1 Open the picture in the Edit workspace,
choose ‘Image > Picture Frame’, and choose a frame
or a picture edge from the dialog’s many options.
468

STEP 2 Once the frame dialog is open, choose a
frame or edge that you like the look of and click OK to
add it to the full-resolution picture. If you don’t want
the frame to obscure detail at the edges of your
photo, check the ‘Frame outside of the image’ radio
button.
Just
some
of
the
frame
styles
available
with
PaintShop Pro’s Picture Frame feature.
469

STEP 3 PaintShop Pro puts the frame on its own
layer, so you can apply adjustments to the frame,
leaving the photo untouched. Here, I’ve used the Hue/
Saturation/Lightness tool to change the frame color.
You could just as easily change the Layer Blend
mode, transparency or apply any of the Effects filters.
Using the Color Changer Tool
Changing colors in a photo is something you’ll find
yourself wanting to do all the time. Whether it’s
someone’s shirt, a front door, or a car, PaintShop Pro
has the tools you need to make a neat job of it. In a
previous edition of this book, I showed how you can
use the Color Replacer tool to change a front door
from red to green. The Color Replacer tool remains a
good
choice
for
some
color-change
jobs,
but
PaintShop Pro X6 has a tool which is much easier to
use called the Color Changer tool.
One of the advantages of the Color Changer tool is
that it works on the entire image. The Color Replacer
tool is a brush tool – you paint over the parts of the
image you want to recolor and, depending on the
color of the original pixels and the tolerance setting,
470

the pixels the brush touches are changed to the new
color. The Color Replacer tool remains the best option
for fiddly detail, but to change large areas of similar
color in a photo the Color Changer tool is the way to
go. Here’s how to use it to respray your car or change
the color of any other large object.
STEP 1 Right-click the Background layer in the
Layers palette and select Duplicate from the context
menu. You can make your changes to the duplicate
layer and still have the original to fall back on if
anything goes wrong. Select the color you want to
change to on the Foreground color swatch in the
Materials palette.
STEP 2 Select the Color Changer tool from the Flood
Fill fly-out on the toolbar. There are only two settings
on the Tool Options bar for the Color Changer tool –
Tolerance and Edge Softness – and you’ll need to
experiment with both to get the results you want.
471

STEP 3 The Tolerance setting determines the extent
of the color change. If you set a low value only pixels
which closely match the color of the pixel you click on
will be changed. Here I’ve set a Tolerance of 10 and,
although there’s a lot of red, only the red pixels that
are very close in terms of color to the red pixel I
clicked on have been changed. One great feature of
the Color Changer tool is that you can adjust the
tolerance after you’ve clicked to change pixels and
the preview updates to color new pixels using the new
Tolerance settings.
472

STEP 4 Rather than trying to get all of the red
paintwork in one hit you can use the Color Changer
repeatedly, clicking on different parts of the car to add
to the original selection. Continue clicking with the
Color Changer tool until most of the paintwork is the
new color.
473

STEP 5 Incrementally increase the Tolerance setting
until all of the red goes green. Incrementally increase
the Edge Softness setting to produce a soft, more
natural-looking edge to areas of changed color. When
you’re happy with the new paint job, press the Apply
button to apply the color change.

Chapter 9
Printing
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• This chapter is short, but it contains a lot of things
worth knowing if you ever want to turn your
photos into real physical things that you can hold
in your hand and put on your wall, rather than
something you only ever see on a screen. What
with web photo sharing sites, e-mail and Wi-Fi
enabled electronic photo frames, most of your
photos may never find their way onto paper.
Believe it or not though, not everyone owns a PC
and, even among those who do, there are people
who
will
always
prefer
a
physical
printed
photograph over an electronic one. Some photo
competitions still insist on you sending hard copy
prints and if you want to exhibit your photos or
just hang them on the wall you’ll need to know
how to print them.
476

• This chapter kicks off with a discussion about
resolution and how it affects print quality and if
you read nothing else you should at least try and
get your head around this concept as it’s one of
the most important factors affecting print quality.
• If you’re having problems getting what comes out
of your printer to match what you see on the
screen you’re not alone, it’s one of the most
common problems digital photographers face.
Read the section on monitor calibration and color
management to find out how to overcome the
problem and stop wasting precious ink and paper.
• Another way to save on expensive consumables
is to print several photos on one sheet of paper.
PaintShop
Pro’s
Print
Layout
application
is
designed
to
help
you
do
just
that.
The
step-by-step project at the end of this chapter
shows you how.
• Printing can be a frustrating business because
there are many factors which affect final print
quality – the quality and resolution of the digital
image, the type of printer, the inks and paper
used, color management and printer settings. By
following the advice provided here you’ll be able
to consistently produce the best results possible
from your printer.
Image Resolution
In
order
to
get
good
results
when
printing
it’s
important
to
understand
a
little
about
image
resolution. If you’ve bought an inkjet printer recently,
one of the things that may have influenced your
decision is the printer resolution. Your inkjet printer
477

may boast a resolution of 1440 dpi or even more.
Similarly if you’ve recently bought a digital camera,
somewhere on the box, it will say 12 or 16 or maybe
even 32 megapixels.
Like printer and digital camera manufacturers, makers
of flatbed scanners use resolution as a selling feature
– the higher the better. But what do all these numbers
mean and how are they related? Perhaps more
importantly, how does the number of pixels produced
by a camera’s sensor affect how your photos will look
when they are printed?
When it comes to digital images, cameras, scanners,
printers and PaintShop Pro, all deal in the same
currency – pixels. The starting point with any digital
image, therefore, is its size in pixels. The image in Fig
9.1 has a size of 3888 × 2592 pixels, giving a total
pixel count of 10,077,696. If you view this image in
PaintShop Pro at 100% magnification you would only
be able to see a small part of it. As well as the
number of pixels in an image, we also need to take
account of the resolution, measured in pixels per inch
(ppi). The resolution of most screens in use today is
around 100 ppi. If you divide the pixel dimensions by
the resolution, you get the physical size of the image.
3888/100=38.8
and
2592/100=25.9,
so
a
ten
megapixel photo would measure approximately 39 ×
26 inches on screen at 100% magnification.
478

Fig 9.1 At 100% magnification, only a small part of
this 2592 × 3888 pixel image is visible on screen; to
see the whole thing it’s necessary to reduce the
magnification using Window > Fit to Window.
Shuffling Pixels
Open an image in PaintShop Photo Pro and select
Image > Resize. The Pixel Dimensions pane in the
Resize dialog box tells you the pixel dimensions of the
photo, in this case 3888 × 2592 pixels. The Print Size
pane shows the physical dimensions of the image at
the
specified
resolution;
at
72
ppi,
this
image
measures 54 × 36 inches.
Click the Advanced Settings box and make sure the
‘Resample using’ box is unchecked and enter 144 in
the resolution field; notice how the width and
479

height print dimensions half when you double the
resolution. If you enter 288 in the resolution field, the
print size decreases again by a factor of 2. All you are
doing here is rearranging the same information – the
10,077,696
image
pixels
–
into
a
progressively
smaller space.
Fig 9.2 There’s an inverse relationship between
resolution
and
print
output
size
–
doubling
the
resolution halves the output size.
There’s an inverse relationship between resolution
and print output size – doubling the resolution halves
the output size.
On the screen at 72 ppi, the pixels are packed so
closely together that you can’t see them individually.
But inkjet printing technology requires images of
higher resolution to produce good quality results.
Generally, your photos should have a minimum
resolution of 200 ppi to print well.
480

Fig 9.3
The same image shown at different resolutions.
Although the commercial printing process used for
this book is technologically dissimilar to inkjet printing,
these images nonetheless provide a good example of
what you could expect to see if you output images at
these
resolutions
to
a
desktop
inkjet.
At
low
resolutions, pixelation is clearly visible. A good quality
image
is
produced
at
200
ppi,
but
at
higher
resolutions, no improvement in picture quality is
discernible. The minimum recommended resolution
for the offset litho process used to print this book is
481

300 ppi, so you may see some improvement from the
200 ppi to the 300 ppi image above (look at the detail
in the clock face), but this is unlikely to be the case
with an inkjet printer. Try carrying out your own
resolution tests to determine the point at which
increasing
the
resolution
produces
no
apparent
quality improvement on your printer.
Resampling
Go back to the Resize dialog box and enter a value of
200 in the Resolution field. This gives a print size of
roughly 10 × 15 inches. What if you don’t want to
make a print almost A3 in size? That’s easy, just enter
the size you want in the Width or Height box –
changing one automatically changes the other to
maintain the aspect ratio. Say you want to fit the
photo on a 6 × 4 inch piece of photo paper, enter 4 in
the Width field (for a portrait-shaped photo), and the
Height field automatically changes to 6. Wait a
minute, though, now our image resolution is 648 ppi,
far higher than the 200 ppi required for inkjet printing.
This doesn’t really matter too much, and it certainly
won’t affect the print quality, which will be no better
and no worse than at 200 ppi. It will take longer,
though, for your computer to send all that data to the
printer and for the printer to process it. You can speed
things up by downsampling the image – removing the
extra pixels that aren’t required for printing at this
size.
Downsampling
Check the ‘Resample using’ box and select either
Smart Size or Bicubic from the interpolation pull-down
menu. Now enter a value of 200 in the Resolution
482

field. This time, rather than changing the physical
dimensions to accommodate all the image pixels at
the new resolution, PaintShop Photo Pro has done
something different. It has removed pixels to produce
the requested resolution at the existing size (it hasn’t
done it yet, but it will when you press OK). Take a
look at the Pixel Dimensions pane and you’ll see the
new pixel dimensions are 800 × 1200. If you do the
maths yourself you’ll discover that this does indeed
produce a 6 × 4 inch image at 200 ppi.
Fig
9.4a–c
The
photo
on
the
left
has
been
downsampled from an original 2560 × 1920 image to
6× 4.5 at a resolution of 300 ppi – suitable for printing.
Its pixel dimensions are now 717 × 538. The smaller
middle photo was downsampled to 2 × 1.5 at 300 ppi,
giving new pixel dimensions of 237 × 178. The middle
photo was then upsampled to the original 6 × 4.5 size
at 300 ppi. You can clearly see the loss of detail and
sharpness
caused
by
the
interpolation,
hardly
surprising as only one-third of the pixels in this image
are original. You can improve things marginally by
unsharp masking, but there’s no substitute for the
original pixel data, so always make sure you keep
originals backed up before resizing!
483

Removing pixels in this fashion will not affect the
picture
quality.
This
4
×
6
inch
print
will
be
indistinguishable from one printed at 512 ppi, but
you’ll have it in your hand much sooner. But what if
you change your mind and decide that an A3-sized
print would look pretty cool after all (assuming you’re
lucky enough to own an A3 color inkjet printer)?
Upsampling
Open the Resize dialog box once more. (In PaintShop
Pro Photo XI and earlier, when you open the Resize
dialog, it applies the last-used settings to the current
image. To get back to the current image size, select
‘Percent’ in the Pixel Dimensions units pull-down
menu and enter 100 in the Width field.) Make sure the
‘Resample using’ box is still checked and enter the
original pixel width of 2592 in the Width field (the
Height box will automatically increase to 3888). Click
OK and PaintShop Pro will upsample the image,
taking us back where we started, right? Wrong!
Take a look at the new image and you’ll notice it’s not
quite as sharp as it was to begin with. PaintShop Pro
has added new pixels in between the existing ones to
bring the image up to size. The values of these new
pixels are based on those of neighboring ones using
a process called ‘interpolation’. Interpolated pixels are
OK if you’re in a fix, like you need to make a large
print from a small digital file, but they are no substitute
for the real thing.
So, you can take pixels out of a digital photo with no
loss of quality, and this can help speed up printing,
but you can’t put them back without things starting to
look mushy. What are the implications of this for
484

storing and printing your digital pictures? If you follow
one simple rule, you won’t go wrong. Always keep a
full-sized original copy of your digital photos backed
up on removable media (i.e. CD or DVD). Then you
can downsample your images for printing, e-mailing,
uploading to the web or whatever, but if you need to
make a full-sized print that requires the maximum
image resolution you’ll always have the original to fall
back on.
Printing with Corel Paintshop Pro
Having opened the picture, make sure that the quality
is the best possible and choose Print Layout from the
File menu. The Print Layout dialog shows the files
selected for printing in the left margin. Click ‘Open
Template’ to view your options. The default template
group is Avery. This group has over 50 templates
which cover most everyday options, but you can also
make your own and save them in the template library
(‘File > Save Template’).
485

Fig 9.5
Clockwise from top left: (1) Print Layout providesan
easy way to print multiple copies of the same photo,
or a selection of photos on a single sheet of paper,
saving you time and money. (2) A range of templates
is available, including Avery standard sizes so you
can, for example, produce one large print for your
album, or framing, and several smaller versions to
send to friends. (3) You can print multiple photos by
selecting thumbnails in the Manage workspace and
choosing File > Print Layout. The selected images
appear in a strip on the left and are dropped in
position on the template layout. (4) Click the Print
Setup button to change the paper orientation and add
captions (though this is better done in the Print Layout
486

dialog
box).
Most
of
the
settings
here
are
for
producing film separations for commercial printing.
Fig 9.6 Don’t forget to select the appropriate inkjet
paper type. If you don’t, the color may not come out
as you’d hoped.
487

Fig 9.7
Select Print Contact Sheet from the More options
menu in the Manage workspace (1) to quickly print a
sheet of thumbnails for the current folder. This opens
the Print Contact Sheet dialog box (2), where you can
use the default template or choose another. Click the
Modify Contact Sheet button to open the Custom
Contact Sheet dialog box (3) and produce your own
layout. Doing this with a folder containing a large
number of images may take a while.
What can you use templates for?
• Creating unique contact sheets.
• Customizing for specific jobs such as cards,
receipts, invitations, business cards, etc.
• For making mini-stickers.
488

• For creating your own business and address
labels.
Color Management
If you’ve ever asked the question, ‘why don’t my prints
match what I see on the computer display?’, then you
need to know about color management. A color
management system (CMS) ensures that individual
devices
–
digital
cameras,
scanners,
computer
monitors and printers – treat color in the same way,
so that you get consistent color from one to the other.
Fig 9.8 A color management system can help you
avoid problems like unexpected variations in color
from monitor to printer by ensuring consistent color
from your digital camera to your monitor and finally to
printed output.
489

To return to the original question, it is in fact
impossible for your printer to reproduce exactly what’s
on your monitor as the two devices use different
physical systems to produce color. The monitor
transmits light using red, green and blue phosphor
dots (or, in the case of an LCD panel, a fluorescent
backlight passing through a colored filter) and a color
print uses pigment or dye-based inks to reflect light.
Color printers can use up to seven inks; even so, it is
not possible for them to reproduce all the colors on
your computer display. In color reproduction terms,
the two devices are said to have different gamuts.
It’s not just different kinds of devices that vary in the
way they handle color. As anyone who has visited the
TV department of a high street electrical store can
verify, no two TVs look the same. A picture viewed on
your PC at home will quite probably look different on
your work PC, and if you e-mail it to your friends,
each one of them is likely to see a slightly different
version, due to the individual color characteristics of
their display.
Color Profiles
To try and sort out this mess, an organization called
the ‘International Color Consortium’ (ICC), which has
as its members companies like Adobe, Apple, Agfa
and Kodak, developed a system of profiling for color
imaging devices. Each device has a profile which
describes its color characteristics and which can be
read and understood by imaging software. Windows
has
built-in
support
for
ICC-compliant
color
management.
490

Using ICC profiles, a color management system can
accurately convert color information from one device
to another. In short, this means more accurate color
from your camera to your monitor and finally out to
your printer. It also means that, providing they use a
CMS, what everyone else sees on their monitor is the
same as what you see.
Calibration
In order for color management to work successfully,
it’s important that your monitor is correctly calibrated.
To do this, select File > Color Management > Monitor
Calibration and complete the Monitor Calibration
wizard. Once your monitor is calibrated, the next step
is to ensure you have profiles installed for all of your
devices or at least for your monitor and printer. These
should have been installed automatically when you
installed the devices but it doesn’t hurt to check. To
find out what profile your monitor is using in Windows
XP, right-click on the desktop and select Properties
from the contextual menu. Click the Advanced button
on the Settings tab and then the Color Management
tab. In Windows Vista right-click on the desktop,
select Personalize and select Display Settings. Click
the
Advanced
Settings
button,
select
the
Color
Management Tab, then click the Color Management
button. For Windows 7, right-click on the desktop,
select Screen resolution, click Advanced settings,
select the Color Management tab, then click the Color
Management button.
If your monitor profile isn’t listed, click the Add button
and try to find it. All Windows color profiles are stored
in
the
folder
491

C:\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color. If you can’t
find it here, check any disks that were supplied with
the monitor, or the manufacturer’s website.
Fig 9.9
A color management system can help you avoid
problems like unexpected variations in color from
monitor to printer by ensuring consistent color from
your digital camera to your monitor and finally to
printed output. Monitor calibration is important for
accurate color management. Let your monitor warm
up for half an hour before running the wizard.
For your printer, select Printers and Faxes from the
Start
menu,
right-click
the
printer
icon,
select
Properties from the contextual menu and click the
Color Management tab. It’s not always easy to identify
the correct color profile from its name. Windows
should automatically assign the right profile, if it’s
available,
though
you
can
add
it
manually
if
necessary. As with monitor profiles, if one wasn’t
492

supplied with your printer, the best option is the
manufacturer’s website.
Fig 9.10 You can check the currently installed default
profiles for your monitor and printer by opening the
Display and Printer Properties dialog boxes.
Fig 9.11 In Basic mode (left), the printer driver for the
Epson Stylus Photo R800 helpfully indicates ink
quantities remaining. Advanced mode (right) provides
a range of color controls, but these should be
avoided, if you are using color management.
493

Printer profiles are less straightforward than monitor
profiles because they are designed to work with a
specific combination of inks and paper. A profile
generated for photo-quality glossy paper is unlikely to
produce
satisfactory
results
with
matt
paper.
Furthermore, there is a wide variation in different
manufacturers’ paper characteristics, so a profile
designed, for example, for Epson Premium Glossy
Photo Paper will not provide good results with another
manufacturer’s glossy photo paper.
Color Management in Corel Paintshop Pro X6
PaintShop Pro X introduced support for ICC color
profiles which makes getting consistent color from
your monitor to your printer that much easier. To turn
on
color
management,
select
File
>
Color
Management > Color Management and check ‘Enable
Color Management’ in the Color Management dialog
box.
494

Fig 9.12 Use the Color Management dialog box to
turn on color management and configure your display
and printer profiles.
Select your monitor and printer profiles from the
pull-down menus – unless you have several profiles
installed there will be only one, the default profile for
the device that you installed previously. That’s nearly
all you need to do.
If you have an image open, the color profile, if it has
one, will be displayed at the top, after the message
‘Image, graphic, or text generated by:’. Not all images
are tagged with a profile, but if it’s a photo from a
digital camera, it will most likely have an embedded
sRGB profile.
Don’t worry if the image has no embedded profile, you
will still be able to see how it is going to look when
printed. All of the elements for a color-managed
workflow are in place, and the color management
system can correctly interpret the numbers in the
profiled image and translate them for display on your
monitor or printer using the profiles for those devices.
Fig 9.13
495

To produce a ‘soft proof’– an on-screen view that
accurately simulates output from your printer – check
the Proofing radio button and select your printer
profile from the ‘Emulated device profile’ pull-down
menu.
Despite all of this, for the reasons explained earlier,
it’s still not possible for the image displayed on your
monitor to match your printer. But, PaintShop Photo
Pro can show you on screen what an image will look
like when printed on your desktop color inkjet, or any
other printer for which you have a profile. This is
called ‘soft proofing’ as opposed to ‘hard proofing’
which involves making a hard copy print.
496

Fig 9.14 Click the ICM checkbox to enable color
management using the currently installed default
printer profile.
To display a soft proof on your monitor, open the
Color Management dialog box and check the radio
button labeled ‘Proofing’. To see colors on your
monitor and/or printer as they would appear on
another device, select your printer in the ‘Emulated
device profile’ pull-down menu and click OK to view
the proof.
Printing Using Color Management
How your Print dialog box looks will depend on the
printer you are using and the driver software. The
examples shown here use the Epson Stylus Photo
R800 printer, but other printer drivers will provide
similar options. First, make sure your image is the
correct size and resolution for printing on your chosen
paper as described earlier in this chapter. Select File
> Print and click the Properties button on the Print
dialog box.
The Stylus Photo R800 driver provides Basic and
Advanced options. It also provides an extremely
useful graphical representation of the ink levels. Click
the Advanced button and select the paper type, size,
orientation and other print options.
On the right-hand side of the dialog box, you’ll find the
Color Management settings. In Color Controls mode,
you can alter the brightness, contrast, saturation and
color balance of the print output using the slider
controls. Only use these controls if you don’t want to
497

use color management. PhotoEnhance mode allows
you to apply a number of effects to the printed output,
including monochrome and sepia toning and soft
focus, canvas and parchment texture effects.
The button we are interested in is the one marked
‘ICM’. Click this and the driver will use the color
management system to correctly interpret and print
the colors in the image. Once you click the ICM button
in the Epson R800 printer driver dialog box, the other
color controls disappear as you won’t be needing
them. Don’t check the No Color Adjustment box, as
this is intended for use where the conversion to the
printer color space has already been made in the
image-editing software. There’s a save button that
lets you save this configuration. I’d recommend you
use it as it’s easy to miss just one thing if you have to
do all this manually each time you print.
No Profile?
If you can’t get a color profile for your printer and ink/
paper combination, there are three options available
to you. You can pay a company to produce a profile
for your individual setup. The way this works is that
the company supplies you with a set of images
composed of color swatches which you print out and
return to them. They then analyze these using
sophisticated
spectrophotometry
equipment
and
produce a profile based on the results. This kind of
profiling is very accurate, because it is tailor-made for
your specific printer, paper and inks, as opposed to a
generic profile. One company that produces printer
profiles
is
Chromix
(www.chromix.com).
These
services
aren’t
cheap,
but
if
accurate
color
is
498

important to you, and certainly if you are producing
images for commercial use, they are well worth the
cost.
The second option is to produce your own color
profiles using a device such as the Datacolor Spyder
4
or
the
X-rite
ColorMunki
Smile.
These
are
spectrophotometer devices that you connect to the
front of your monitor, so that they can take readings
and compile a profile. These monitor profiling devices
used
to
be
the
expensive
preserve
of
imaging
professionals but are now very affordable.
If you are making prints for personal use and can’t
justify the cost of a profiling service or dedicated
hardware,
you
can
make
your
own
printer
adjustments. As I said at the beginning of this
chapter, you will never get your printer to emulate
exactly
what
you
see
on
your
monitor
(even
professional setups
have to content themselves with soft-proofing –
getting the monitor to show what the print will look
like), but you should be able to improve an existing
unsatisfactory setup.
499

Fig 9.15 Use a target such as this one to compare
printed output with what’s on your screen.
You can do this in one of two ways. Either use the
printer driver’s color adjustment controls to alter the
color
balance
or
use
PaintShop
Photo
Pro’s
Adjustment layers to make temporary adjustments
prior to printing. In either case, you will need to
compare printed output to what is on your screen and
for this you should use a test calibration image that
displays a wide range of colors, including naturally
occurring hues like sky, foliage and skin tones.
Professionals use specially designed color targets for
this, but you can easily create your own, like the one
pictured here. If you haven’t got time to make your
own, you can download this target image from
www.gopaintshoppro.co.uk/test-target.html

Step-by-Step Projects
Printing Multiple Photos with Print Layout
Print Layout is a straightforward layout application
that you can use to make multiple prints on an inkjet
printer, saving time and money. Using Print Layout,
you can print several copies of one photo on a single
A4 sheet of paper, cut them up and send them to
friends and family. You can print out multiple photos
for passport or driving license applications, or you can
use Print Layout to arrange different images on the
same page for quick and convenient printing. There is
a range of templates which you can adapt to fit your
own needs and save for future use.
STEP 1 We’re going to use Print Layout to print a
selection of photos onto template pages. Select the
501

images you want to print in the Manage workspace
and select File > Print Layout. The photos you
selected appear in the Images window on the left. The
default Template is 21.59 × 27.94 cm. Drag the
images to the layout window and size and position
them.
STEP 2 If the images exceed the size of the template,
you will get an alert box telling you they won’t fit and
asking if you want to resize them. This can happen if
you have not resized your image. Click OK and they
will be scaled to fit the width of the default template.
Drag a corner handle to make them smaller – the
proportions are automatically retained so you don’t
need to worry about stretching or squeezing them.
STEP 3 Don’t worry too much about neatly laying
everything out at this stage, just get the pictures in the
layout window at roughly the size you want them. If
you want to get four pictures on a template, make
502

them slightly smaller than a quarter of the page size
to allow a border around them.
STEP 4 You can position the images manually, but
Print Layout has a few auto positioning features to
help out. The four buttons in the center of the toolbar
will position an image in any of the four corners of the
page or dead center. To the left of these, you’ll find
the Auto Positioning button. Roughly arrange your
images on the page, click the Auto Arrange button
and they will be automatically sized and positioned for
the best fit.
Tip
If you’re printing multiple images on a page for
cutting out, it helps to minimize wastage if you sort
your photos into landscape and portrait format and
print only one kind at a time. Don’t mix landscape
and portrait format photos on the same layout.
503

STEP 5 Manually arranging images like this is the
best way to create poster layouts. Use the Text tool to
add a headline at the top of the page and to put a
caption under each image.
504

STEP 6 To choose a template layout, click the Open
Template button on the toolbar or select File > Open
Template. Select a category, click on one of the
template thumbnails and click OK. This will replace
your previous layout so, if you want to keep it, save it
first using File > Save Template.
STEP 7 To add photos to the template, just drag and
drop them from the Images window onto the ‘cells’ in
the template. If the image isn’t an exact fit, you can
drag a corner handle to resize it and drag it around
within the rectangle to change the crop, or click the
Fill Cell with Image button; there are buttons to help
with this on the right of the toolbar.
STEP 8 If you are making a page that contains only
one image, click the Fill Template with Image button
to copy the image to every cell on the template.
Otherwise, drag the remaining images into position
and resize them. Right-click on any of the images and
505

select ‘Apply placement to all cells’ to have the
positional
changes
you
make
to
one
image
automatically applied to all of the others.
STEP 9 Add captions using the Text tool and click the
Print button on the toolbar, or select File > Print to
print the page.

Chapter 10
The Web
Sharing Images
What’s Covered in this Chapter
• In this chapter, you’ll discover how to produce
pictures for the web. Whether you want to share
images on social networking sites like Facebook
and Flickr, to produce a decent photo of your old
camera to put on eBay, to e-mail a few snaps to
friends, or if you have something more ambitious
in mind like an entire website, the following pages
will tell you everything you need to know.
• If you’re not sure of the difference between GIFs
and JPEGs and PNGs and when and how to
make use of the different web image file formats
then read through the opening pages. Experiment
with Paint Shop Pro’s GIF and JPEG Optimizers,
try to reproduce some of the examples shown
508

here
and
you’ll
soon
understand
what
optimization is all about.
• In these days of fast broadband connections, it’s
tempting to think that file size doesn’t matter, but
even a broadband link can sometimes slow to a
crawl. If your site downloads in a flash, regardless
of connection speeds, you’ll get and keep your
visitors’ interest.
• In the step-by-step projects at the end of this
chapter
you’ll
learn
how
to
add
a
visible
watermark
to
your
photos
and
how
to
use
PaintShop Pro’s enhanced sharing features to
upload photos to Facebook, Flickr, and Google
Plus.
Sharing Photos on the Web
PaintShop Pro X6 allows you to upload and share
your photos on Facebook, Flickr and Google Plus.
Obviously, you’ll need an account on those networks,
but if you’re part of the dwindling minority yet to have
discovered social networking, here’s the opportunity
you’ve been waiting for.
These new upload features are pretty basic – they’ll
allow you to upload a bunch of photos, but that’s
about it, and they have some shortcomings which I’ll
discuss as well as looking at ways to overcome them.
Uploading Photos to Flickr
If you want to upload your photos directly to Flickr,
you first need to authorize PaintShop Pro X6 for
access
to
your
Flickr
account.
This
happens
automatically the first time you attempt an upload.
First though, you’ll need to select the photos you want
509

to upload and the easiest way to do this is in
Thumbnail mode in the Manage workspace. One way
to do it is to organize all the photos you want to
upload into a tray. Click the New tray + button at the
top of the Organizer (if it isn’t visible, click the down
chevron on the right end of the Organizer toolbar and
check Tray) and give the tray a name. Select the
folder containing the images you want to upload in the
Navigation palette (ctrl-click to add to your selections),
then drag them to the tab of your new tray and drop
them in.
Fig 10.1 Organize all the photos you want to upload
into a tray, Click on one thumbnail then press Ctrl-A to
select all. Create a new tray and drag the images to
its tab.
With the contents of the New tray visible in the
Organizer, press Ctrl-A to select all, then click the
Share button on the Organizer toolbar and choose
Flickr from the menu. A window like the one in figure
10.2 will appear, enter your Yahoo login details and
click the Sign In button. Next, you’ll be asked by Flickr
to authorize PaintShop Pro to access your Flickr
account and upload, edit and delete photos, click OK
510

to agree to this and the Social Sharing window,
shown in figure 10.3, will appear with your selected
photos ready to upload. In future, you’ll come straight
to this without having to go through the login and
authorization screens.
Fig 10.2 The first time you upload photos to Flickr,
you’ll be asked to authorize PaintShop Pro to access
your Flickr account. You can later withdraw the
authorization if you decide you no longer want to use
PaintShop Pro to upload photos to Flickr.
511

Fig 10.3 The Social Sharing dialog with photos ready
to upload.
The save to Album pull-down should list all of your
Flickr sets (for some reason Corel likes to call Flickr
sets albums, instead of giving them their proper
name) but only your public sets are shown here. If
you have sets containing photos that are private
(viewable only by yourself, friends and family), they
won’t appear in this list.
That leads us to a more serious privacy issue with the
PaintShop Pro X6 Flickr uploader – you can’t set
privacy preferences. Any and all photos you upload to
Flickr from PaintShop Pro X6 will, at least initially, be
public. Once your photos are uploaded, you can visit
your photostream in your web browser and edit the
privacy settings (fortunately Flickr makes this easy
512

and I’ll show you how to do it in a moment). This
applies to Facebook and Google plus as well.
In the meantime, the best you can do is upload your
photos, then immediately change the permissions on
the Flickr website using your browser. Your photos
will only be publicly visibly for the time it takes
between uploading and changing the permissions, but
if absolute privacy is important to you, I’d recommend
you use the Flickr uploader.
Even though you can’t see sets with private photos,
you can create a new set by clicking the New Album
button. The only thing that remains to be done is to
select the maximum size of your uploaded photos
from the Quality (why not size?) menu at the bottom
of the share photos window. If you leave this on the
default ‘Original Pixels’ then the largest size will be
the same as the original. If you’d rather restrict your
Flickr
uploads
to
smaller
images
choose
Recommended
–
resolution
optimized
for
faster
upload. In Paintshop Pro X6, this reduces your
images to a maximum size of 1600 × 1200 pixels
before uploading them, which is probably plenty big
enough
and
will
reduce
the
upload
time
–
considerably if you’re uploading a big batch of photos.
But if you want to keep your originals on Flickr at their
original size as backups, stick with the ‘Original
Pixels’ option. Older versions of PaintShop Pro offer
several different sizes for reduced resolution uploads
on this menu. Now all you have to do is press the
upload button and wait for the process to complete.
When the upload is finished, an alert box will appear
to tell you so.
513

If you do decide to upload your photos to Flickr from
PaintShop
Pro
X6,
here’s
how
to
change
the
permissions for the whole batch. Launch your browser
and sign in to your Flickr account. Select Organize
from the You menu then, from the pop-up menu at the
bottom of the content area, select the date on which
you uploaded the photos, select them and drag them
to the content area. Select ‘Who can see, comment,
tag?’ from the Permissions menu and make the
appropriate selection from the popup box, e.g. check
the Only You(private) radio button plus the ‘Your
friends’ and ‘Your Family’ checkboxes, then click the
Change Permissions button.
Fig 10.4
Though you can’t assign privacy settings to your
pictures when uploading from PaintShop Pro to Flickr,
you can easily do so subsequently using Flickr’s
batch organize feature.
If at some point, you no longer want to use PaintShop
Pro X6 to upload photos to Flickr, you should
514

de-authorize the permission you granted for the
application to access your Flickr account. To do this,
you need to access your Yahoo account information
page. To find out how to do that, click the Need help?
Start here! Link at the bottom of your profile page.
Uploading Photos to Facebook
Paintshop Pro X6 also provides a convenient way to
upload photos to Facebook. As with Flickr, the best
way to organize this is to create a new tray containing
all the photos you want to upload (see above). Then,
click one of the thumbnails, press Ctrl-A to select all
and choose Facebook from the Share button on the
Organizer toolbar.
Now you’ll need to sign in to your Facebook account.
Enter your details and click the Login button, then
click the Allow button to let PaintShop Pro access
your Facebook account. Once you’ve done this, you’ll
be presented with the Facebook upload screen. You
only need to do the authorization stuff once then you’ll
come
directly
to
this
window
when
you
select
Facebook from the Share menu.
All the pictures you selected are shown in this
window, you can add more by clicking the Add file
button, but then you need to locate the image files on
your hard drive which isn’t very clever. If you don’t
have all the photos you want, the easiest way to get
them is to hit the cancel button and redo your
selection in the Manage workspace.
515

Fig 10.5
The first time you upload photos to Facebook, you’ll
be asked to authorize PaintShop Pro to access your
Facebook
account.
You
can
later
withdraw
the
authorization if you decide you no longer want to use
PaintShop Pro to upload photos to Facebook.
You can select an existing Facebook album to upload
your images to or create a new one, and, as with the
Flickr
uploader.
Click
the
Photo
tab
to
add
a
description to each picture by selecting it and filling in
the description field. You’ll only have to do this, if you
haven’t already captioned your photos. In the Photo
tab, you’ll also notice there’s a people field. This
shows the name of anyone you’ve tagged in the
selected image (using the People feature) who you’ve
linked with your Facebook friends and saves you
having to tag the images all over again once you’ve
uploaded them.
516

For this work, you’ve got to first link your PaintShop
Pro people tags with the corresponding Facebook
friends. To do that (you’ll need to click the cancel
button in the Share photos dialog box for now and
come back to it later) select anyone listed in the
People category of the Tags section of the Collections
tab in the Navigation palette. Next, look in the
Organizer palette toolbar at the top of the Organizer
and on the left you’ll see link tags for Facebook and
Flickr. Click the Facebook icon and Paintshop Pro will
connect to your Facebook account and download
your Friend list. Now you just click the Friend that
corresponds with the selected person and the two are
linked.
If you now return to your upload, you’ll notice that the
people field in the photo tab contains the Facebook
names of anyone you’ve linked in this way. When the
photos are uploaded they’ll be automatically tagged
and your friends will be notified. It works in the same
way for Flickr contacts.
When all is ready, click the upload button. The photos
will be uploaded to the album you selected or created,
and an alert box appears to tell you when
the upload is complete, if you’re uploading a lot of
photos or have a slow connection this could take
several minutes.
517

Fig
10.6 Uploading
to
Facebook.
You
can
add
photos to existing albums, create new ones and add a
description for each photo.
Once your photos are uploaded to Facebook, you’ll
need to login to your Facebook account using your
browser if you want to view them, change the privacy
settings, edit, or delete them.
Tip
Though in some circumstances, i.e. uploading to an
existing
Facebook
album,
PaintShop
Pro
will
respect
your
existing
privacy
settings,
always
assume that photos uploaded using the Share
photos feature will be published publicly on social
network and photo sharing sites. Once the upload
has completed, log in using a web browser to check
and change privacy settings if necessary.
518

Uploading Photos to Google Plus
If you have a Google Plus account, you can upload
photos in pretty much exactly the same way as for
Facebook and Flickr. As with Facebook and Flickr,
PaintShop Pro will ask you to sign in to your G+
account and provide authorization to manage your
photos and videos as well as your contacts. Once
you’ve done that, the upload process is very similar,
choose the album you want to upload to or create a
new
one,
decide
whether
you
want
to
upload
full-sized images or smaller ones and click the upload
button. As with Flickr, you’ll need to make any
adjustments to privacy settings on Google Plus.
One final thing that’s worth pointing out, as it’s easily
overlooked, is that you can upload the same batch of
images to all three sites at the same time. So long as
the icon at the top of the Share photos window is
highlighted, your photos will be uploaded there. So it’s
possible to simultaneously upload an album of photos
to Facebook, Flickr and Google Plus simultaneously.
A real time saver.
519

Fig 10.7
To upload to Facebook, Flickr and Google plus
simultaneously, just click all three buttons at the top of
the Share photos window. Remember to Assign an
‘album’ for each site and to add a description and tags
where appropriate.
Creating Your Own Images for the Web
Social networking sites have made it easy to upload
and share photos, but PaintShop Pro X6 has a range
of tools which you can use to prepare photos for your
own websites. If you have your own business website,
or a blog, or you want to upload photos to an online
forum, auction site or enter them for a competition,
you’ll want to produce the best possibly quality image
without creating an enormous file. The rest of this
chapter is devoted to the tools PaintShop Pro X6
provides to help you do just that. Even if you’re
520

content to use the Share button to upload and e-mail
photos, you might find the explanation of web files
formats and image compression useful.
How the Web Displays Images
You’re probably aware that web pages are written in
HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language, and that your
web browser interprets that code to display formatted
text and pictures on your screen. To see what HTML
looks like, in Internet Explorer select View Source
from the Page menu. You don’t need to be able to
write or even understand HTML in order to produce
web pages as there are plenty of applications that will
help you do this while keeping the code at arm’s
length.
Picture files are loaded into a browser page by HTML
code which looks something like this:
<img
src=“images/pelican_02.GIF”
width=234
height=53>
521

Fig 10.8
You can display the HTML code for the currently
displayed browser page by selecting View Source
from the Page menu in Internet Explorer. The source
code is opened as a text file in Notepad, where you
can edit and save it.
The HTML code tells the browser what the image is
called, where to find it on the server and what size it
is. Once the browser interprets this line of code, it will
download the image and display it.
If it’s a large image, or if the PC on which the browser
is
running
accesses
the
Internet
via
a
slow
connection, it could take a while for the image to
download and display, and trying to keep this delay
as short as possible while maintaining good image
quality is the main aim of web image-editing.
The first, and most often overlooked, method of
reducing image file size is to reduce the size of the
522

image itself. The resolution of most display monitors
is around 100ppi, so the first thing to do is open the
Image, Resize dialog and change the resolution to
100ppi. If you work at a higher resolution than this,
your images will simply appear bigger on the web
page. Because of this, most web designers prefer to
work in pixels rather than other units, and if you are
doing a lot of web work, you should try to get into this
habit. If you make an image 100 × 100 pixels, it will
be roughly an inch square on screen.
If you want to include big images, link them to a
smaller thumbnail and give your viewers the option to
sit through a lengthy download if they wish. Another
effective but little-used file-shrinking strategy is to
aggressively crop images. Get rid of extraneous
background detail and crop right in on the subject.
523

Fig 10.9
The Resize dialog box provides lots of options and it’s
important to pick the right ones. First, check the
‘Advanced settings’ box, uncheck the ‘Resample
using’ box and enter 100 pixels per inch in the
Resolution field. This 5 megapixel image would be
approximately 20 × 25 inches on a web page if we
didn’t downsample it. Check the ‘Resample using’
‘Lock aspect ratio’ and ‘Resize all layers’ boxes and
enter the 100ppi size in the width box of the Print Size
pane. Click OK and view at 100% to see how it will
look on the web.
524

Fig 10.10 If you want to upload larger images, link
them to a page of thumbnails, so visitors can pick
which ones to view and not be overwhelmed with
lengthy downloads.
Web File Formats
Nearly all images on the web are saved in one of two
file formats – JPEG and GIF. If you own a digital
camera, you’ll know about JPEG even if you don’t
know much about the Web. GIF has been around
even longer than JPEG and is used pretty much
exclusively for web graphics. There’s a rule of thumb
that says you should use JPEG for photographic
images and GIF for graphics with flat color, and like
most rules of thumb, it’s a good one 99% of the time,
but there are situations when it’s best ignored. As
always with web images, the objective is to produce
the smallest possible file size, while maintaining the
best possible image quality. By experimenting with
both JPEG and GIF compressions, you’ll soon learn
what works best for particular images.
525

If you look hard enough, you’ll find some web images
that are saved in the PNG format. This relative
newcomer was introduced in an effort to combine the
strengths of JPEG and GIF and eliminate some of
their shortcomings. Despite some advanced features,
like drop shadows and support for layers, PNG has
never really taken off, though you can easily create
PNG files using the PNG Optimizer from Paint Shop
Photo Pro’s Web toolbar.
JPEG in Depth
JPEG is actually a compression algorithm, a process
which reduces the size of digital picture files, but it’s
come to be used to describe the file format which
uses it. JPEG is a lossy compression method, which
in plain English means that when you use it some loss
in quality occurs and the compressed file won’t look
the same or as good as the original. Compression
algorithms that maintain the exact same data and
image quality are called ‘lossless’. Although JPEG
doesn’t
offer
lossless
compression,
at
low
compression settings it comes pretty close. A newer
version of JPEG, called JPEG 2000, provides a
lossless option as well as other advantages, but, like
png, hasn’t gained widespread support.
JPEG is pretty good at removing quite of lot of picture
detail, and thereby considerably reducing file size
without anyone noticing, because the algorithm is
designed to remove the kind of color information that
the human eye doesn’t perceive that well. You can
compress image files by a factor of about three and
you would have to look very hard to spot any
degradation in image quality.
526

Tip
The most effective way to reduce the size of images
is to crop them. A good quality, closely cropped
photo is always better than a highly compressed
one with lots of extraneous detail, so get into the
habit of making the Crop tool your first step in web
image preparation.
Using the JPEG Optimizer
Most image editors, and Paint Shop Pro is no
exception, leave it to you to make the decision about
how much compression to use. It’s up to you to
decide just how much image quality you are prepared
to sacrifice in return for smaller file sizes.
To make this decision you need to know two things.
What will the image look like if you compress it using
a given JPEG setting? And how long will it take to
download? The answers can be found in Paint Shop
Photo Pro’s JPEG Optimizer, which you launch by
clicking the JPEG Optimizer button on the web toolbar
or selecting File > Export > JPEG Optimizer.
527

Fig 10.11 The more JPEG compression you apply to
an image the smaller it gets, and the worse it looks. At
a
setting
of
1,
the
compressed
image
(top)
is
indistinguishable from the original, but the file size is
nearly halved. At a setting of 20, (2nd from top), you
528

can begin to see JPEG artifacts creeping in – look
closely at the lettering on the hut.
Increase the compression setting to 40 (3rd from top)
and the file size drops to a mere 25 Kb – down from
an original 784 Kb. On a cable or DSL Internet
connection this would take a fraction of a second to
download, but the image quality has suffered badly,
with JPEG blocking visible just about everywhere you
look.
If 40 is a step too far, 80 (bottom) is just ridiculous. It’s
interesting to note that, beyond a certain point, not
only does the image quality suffer horrendously, but
file size savings get correspondingly smaller. A setting
of 20 slices 670 Kb from this file; increasing it to 80
gains you only another 53 Kb.
The JPEG optimizer has three tabs – Quality, Format
and Download Times – and Before and After preview
windows. Make sure the preview is set to 100% view,
so you can see the image exactly as it will appear on
the web page; enlarge or maximize the dialog if
necessary. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the
‘Set compression value to’ box or use the slider. The
higher the value entered here, the more compression
is applied, resulting in a smaller, lower-quality image.
1 is virtually no compression; you’ll start to see the
preview deteriorate at around the 20 mark, and
beyond 60 things will start to look very bad indeed.
Bear in mind that these figures are not percentages,
and if you enter the same values in a different Web
Optimizer, you’re unlikely to get similar results. These
529

values
just
represent
Paint
Shop
Photo
Pro’s
maximum and minimum JPEG compression settings.
Judging Picture Quality
Just below the Before and After preview windows,
you’ll see two figures. The left-hand one under the
Before window says ‘Uncompressed’ followed by the
file size in bytes and, on the right, the compressed
size is given, again in bytes. Notice that even at the
lowest compression setting of 1, the size of the
compressed file is only about a half to one-third that
of
the
uncompressed
one.
If
you
want
the
approximate file size in kilobytes, just divide by a
thousand. Generally speaking, compression settings
in the range of 10 to 30 will give acceptable quality
images with high compression ratios, but let your
eyes be your guide and as soon as the image
becomes unacceptably grubby, drag the slider back
toward the low side.
Tip
You can increase the JPEG compressibility of
images by blurring them slightly before compressing
them. A small degree of blur softens the contrast in
edge detail, which is where JPEG artifacts are most
noticeable. Use the Gaussian Blur filter with a radius
of between 0.5 and 1 before JPEG optimizing.
Feel free to experiment with the various Chroma
subsampling presets on the pull-down menu, though
it’s
unlikely
you’ll
achieve
any
improvement
by
changing this. Even the Paint Shop Photo Pro Help
file recommends leaving it on the default setting.
530

Use the Format tab to select either Standard or
Progressive format, the latter preloads a low quality
preview into the browser, so that the viewer has
something to look at while waiting for the real thing.
With standard format, nothing is displayed until the
entire image is downloaded.
Estimating Download Time
The Download Times tab provides the answer to our
second question. In actual fact, it provides several
answers, any one of which might be true, depending
on the kind of link visitors to your website are using to
access
the
Internet.
Four
download
times
are
displayed. These provide a guide to the time, it will
take to download the optimized file on links operating
at 56, 128, 380 and 720 Kbps (kilobits per second).
531

Fig 10.12
Compressing the original (top left) with a compression
value of 20 produces a 135 Kb JPEG. By first
applying the Gaussian Blur filter with a radius of 0.5,
compressing with the same settings produces a file
20 Kb smaller. The resulting image is slightly softer,
but perfectly acceptable.
It’s a little disappointing that Corel has passed up the
opportunity to update the jpeg optimizer for several
years now, with the result that the download speeds
in the jpeg optimizer are looking pretty archaic. 56
Kbps is the speed at which someone using a modem
connects to the Internet. 720k would be the speed of
a very slow broadband connection. These days, most
web connections are broadband ones operating at
speeds measured in Megabits per second (Mbps)
rather than Kilobits and, depending where in the world
you live average broadband speeds are in the 5–80
Mbps range and getting faster all the time.
Of course, a 10 Mbps line doesn’t guarantee 10 Mbps
transfer rates. Speeds could be affected if the line is
shared via a network router, or if there’s Internet
congestion, or if the server can’t cope with the level of
traffic so, regardless of the increase in the speed of
Internet connections, it still makes sense to optimize
your images.
It’s good practice to ensure that most people can
access your site without having to wait all night for the
images to download, so if the JPEG Optimizer is
telling you that just one of the many images that may
end up on your home
532

page will take several seconds to download on a 720
Kbps link, you need to think about how you are going
to speed things up. As a general rule, you can use the
720 Kbps readout to provide an estimate of the worst
performance someone on a broadband connection is
likely to experience.
Once you’re happy with the quality and size of the
Optimized file, press the OK button to save the file.
GIF in Depth
Whereas JPEG images are full color 24-bit files, GIFs
make use of an indexed color palette to help keep file
size down. Each pixel in a JPEG file needs 24 bits (or
3 bytes) of data to describe it. But the same pixel in a
GIF needs only 8 bits and in some circumstances
even fewer. GIF does this by referencing each pixel to
a color lookup table or palette. The palette has 256
colors. The first color is numbered 0, the next 1 and
so on, all the way up to 255; to describe the color of a
pixel all you need is its number, and as there are only
256 possibilities, 1 byte is sufficient to describe them
all.
Tip
Avoid using drop shadows on images that you
intend to convert to GIF. It’s impossible to render
subtle gradations of tint with a limited color palette.
One shortcoming of this approach is that, compared
with the 16 million or so colors that a 24-bit format like
JPEG can display, 256 seems a bit meager. This is
one of the reasons GIF is recommended for graphics
images that often contain very few colors. Indeed,
533

some graphics contain far fewer than 256 colors, and
in such cases, it’s possible to make further file size
economies by reducing the color palette to as few as
four, or even two, colors. A four-color palette can be
defined with 2 bits. That’s 2 bits for every pixel in the
image compared with 24 for JPEG – a massive
saving.
Although 256 colors may not sound like a lot, it’s
surprising how little image quality suffers when you
convert even complex photos containing lots of colors
into GIF format. GIF can also expand the palette of
perceived colors using a process called ‘dithering’ in
which colors are combined to produce intermediate
hues.
Once the palette has been defined, GIF further
reduces the file by applying a lossless compression
algorithm called ‘LZW’. So GIF has two methods of
reducing image file size: color palette reduction and
LZW
compression.
Typically,
LZW
compression
reduces the file size by a factor of two, in other words
halves it, so most of the work involved in reducing GIF
size involves making careful choices about how the
color palette is created, so you can represent all the
colors in your image with the smallest possible
palette.
Using the GIF Optimizer
To open the GIF Optimizer, click the GIF Optimizer
button on the Web toolbar or select File > Export >
GIF Optimizer. Expand the window, so you can see
the previews at 100% and click the Colors tab. The
first input field, ‘How many colors do you want?’, lets
534

you
specify,
well,
just
that.
The
maximum
and
minimum values
depend on the method of color selection and there
are four choices here, Existing Palette, Standard/
Web-safe, Optimized Median Cut and Optimized
Octree.
535

Fig 10.13 The top row shows what happens when
you progressively reduce the GIF color palette from
256 to two colors. The second row shows the same
process with 100% dither selected. GIF is best suited
to graphic images like the bottom one. Reducing the
palette to four colors produces little noticeable quality
loss because there were few colors to begin with. The
GIF Optimizer doesn’t always select the best color
palette (4a). In this case, choose Image > Decrease
Color Depth > X Colors, then optimize using the
existing palette (4b).
The Existing Palette option will be greyed out unless
the image was an 8-bit indexed image to begin with,
or you converted it prior to opening the GIF Optimizer.
The Standard/Web-safe option uses a palette of
standard colors devised to provide the best viewing
experience for those using Internet Explorer on an
8-bit display, but now that 24-bit color displays are
commonplace;
this
isn’t
such
an
important
consideration and you can safely ignore this setting,
unless of course it provides better results than the
others.
Optimized Median Cut and Optimized Octree are two
different algorithms designed to derive the most
representative palette of 256 colors from all of those
in the unoptimized 24-bit image. If your existing image
contains only a few colors use Optimized Octree and
if you want to reduce the image to fewer than 16
colors use Optimized Median Cut.
For now, select Optimized Median Cut and drag the
slider under the ‘How many colors do you want?’ box
as far as it will go to the left until the box contains the
536

value 2. This is what your image will look like if it’s
displayed with 1 bit per pixel, allowing two colors.
Unless there were only two colors to begin with, the
odds are it will look terrible. Highlight the ‘How many
colors do you want?’ box with the mouse and enter
the value 4. Things will look a little better, but not
much. Double the number of colors to 8, then 16, 32,
64,
128
and
finally
256,
taking
a
look
at
the
compressed preview each time.
Dare to Dither
Assuming your original image was a color photo, it
probably will have begun to look something like
normal when you got to 16 or 32 colors. Even so,
some of the colors may not look right and you may
get ‘banding’ – discrete bands of color where the
original showed subtle gradations – in skies, for
example. What’s happening is that the original colors
in the image are being mapped to the closest one
available in the palette and it’s one of the reasons GIF
is a poor choice if your original contains lots of colors
(but a good one if it only contains a few).
There is something you can do about banding. Enter
100 in the box marked ‘How much dithering do you
want?’ This will considerably reduce and perhaps
even eliminate the banding and posterization, but it
also introduces a speckly graininess into the image
which you may find no more acceptable than the
banding. Another drawback is that dithered files are
slightly larger than undithered ones. By dragging the
dithering slider, you should be able to reduce the
graininess
to
an
acceptable
degree
without
reintroducing the banding.
537

Try Transparency
One very useful feature of the GIF format is that it
supports transparency. You can tell the Optimizer to
use the existing image or layer transparency or define
a color from within the image as transparent. The
advantage of including transparent areas in the GIF is
that you can place irregular graphics – logos or text,
for example – over different backgrounds on your web
page and the background will show through. The
Partial
Transparency
tab
of
the
GIF
Optimizer
provides
sophisticated
controls
to
deal
with
semi-transparent pixels (for example, those around
the edges of anti-aliased text), which can cause
problems.
Whatever file format you choose, Optimization is a
trial and error process. Every image is different, and
while you can Batch Process similar images using the
same settings, if you want to get the best possible
quality at the smallest file size you will need to give
each one individual attention, selecting the settings,
you think will provide the right balance between
quality and download times, and then fine-tuning
depending on what you can see in the Optimizer
preview window.
538

Fig 10.14 The Transparency tab of the GIF Optimizer
allows you to use existing layer transparency, or
specify
a
color
from
the
image
(usually
the
background). Use the Partial Transparency tab to
specify a blend color for the edge pixels which is
similar to the background on your web page.
Step-by-Step Projects
Protecting Your Photos
Adding a Copyright Message and Watermark
If you’re going to put your photos on the Web, you
need to be prepared for the risk that they may be
used without your permission. Horror stories abound
of how people’s snaps have ended up on advertising
hoardings on worse and though you can’t entirely
avoid it (apart from not uploading your photos), there
are some steps you can take to make it less likely. In
this step-by-step project, you’ll learn how to add a
copyright message to your photo file metadata which
tells people they can’t use it without your permission.
539

We’ll also look at how to add a discrete, but visible
watermark.
STEP 1 First, add a copyright statement to your
image metadata, you should add this to all your
photos as a matter of course. Select the IPTC tab in
the Info palette and scroll down to the copyright pane.
In
the
Copyright
notice
field
type
©2012
Ken
McMahon
(substituting
your
own
name
and
the
correct year). To add the © copyright symbol, hold
down the ALT key and type 0169. Select Copyright
from the Copyright status pull-down menu and type
All rights reserved in the Rights usage terms field.
540

STEP 2 Now we’re going to create a semi-transparent
watermark which will appear across the bottom (or
wherever you want) of your photos using the same
type effect described in Chapter 7. This time though,
we’re going to save the process as a script, so you
can add it to other images. First you need to display
the Scripts toolbar, from the View menu Select
Toolbars > Script. Then click the red record button on
the Script toolbar to begin recording. From here on in
everything, you do is recorded, so don’t mess up! If
you
do,
you’ll
have
to
press
the
cancel
script
recording button (the X button two to the right of the
record button) and start again. If you’re not sure about
a step, you can click the pause script recording
button, try it out, then undo back to where you were
before unpausing and continuing.
541

STEP 3 Duplicate the background layer, this is just a
precautionary step in case anything goes awry.
Eventually
you’ll
Save
as
to
create
a
new
watermarked file. Right-click the background layer in
the Layers palette and select Duplicate.
542

STEP 4 Now click the set default colors button in the
materials palette. It’s important not to skip this step
even if the colors are already set to the black and
white defaults as this may not be the case, when you
run the script in future. As we’ll be making a selection
from the text, the color doesn’t actually matter, but it
doesn’t hurt to get into the habit of being thorough
when recording scripts.
543

STEP 5 Select the text tool and type your watermark
message, for mine I’ve used the copyright statement
©2012 Ken McMahon. Choose a bold typeface and
make the type big enough to be clearly visible but not
so large as to overwhelm the image. Click the apply
button on the Tool Option palette to OK the text, then
select the pick tool and position it.
544

STEP 6 Go to the Selections menu and choose ‘From
Vector Object’ to turn the text into a selection (or
press Ctrl-Shift-B). You should now see the selection
marquee surrounding the text. Select the Copy of
Background layer in the Layers palette, and turn off
the text layer by clicking its visibility (eye) icon.
STEP 7 Select Effects > 3D Effects > Inner Bevel to
apply a bevel effect to the Copy of Background layer
using the text selection. The default bevel is a bit
clunky, so I’ve reduced the width to 2. Click OK to
apply the bevel, then press Ctrl-D to deselect all and
get a proper look at your handiwork. For the sake of
tidiness, you can now delete the ‘Vector 1’ type layer.
545

STEP 8 Press the Save script button at the end of the
Script toolbar and when prompted for a name call it
‘Add Watermark’. Now you can add the watermark to
any image with a single click by selecting it from the
pull-down menu in the Scripts toolbar and clicking the
Run Selected Script (play) button.
Sharing to Facebook, Flickr and Google Plus
PaintShop Pro X6 provides a range of really useful
features to help you get your photos uploaded to
social networking and photo sharing sites with the
minimum of effort. Whether you just want to post a
couple of quick snaps or get the results of several
weeks worth of shooting online, the share button is
the first step. In this step-by-step project, I’ll show you
how to upload a folder of photos simultaneously to
Facebook, Flickr and Google Plus. If you don’t have
an account with all three of those platforms don’t
worry, it’s easy to share with just one, two or all three,
pretty much by just pressing a button, or three.
546

STEP 1 The first thing to do is decide on what photos
you want to upload. Though you might want to upload
an entire folder, it’s more likely that you’ll choose a
selection of photos for sharing and the easiest way to
do that is to create a new tray and add the photos to
it. In the Manage workspace, click the downward
pointing chevron on the right of the Organizer toolbar
and check the Tray box to display tray tabs at the top
of the Organizer. Click the + sign to add a new tab
and
call
it
‘For
sharing’.
Select
and
drag
the
thumbnails of the photos you want to share to the new
tab.
547

STEP 2 Press Ctrl-A to select all of the thumbnails
and then click the Sharing button on the Organizer
toolbar, it looks like three nodes or dots connected
with two lines. Click the Photo tab and check the
description. This is taken from the IPTC caption field,
so if you’ve captioned all your photos (see page 40 or
the step-by-step project on page 51), it’ll be fine, but if
you haven’t, it will either be blank or say something
like ‘Olympus camera. As this is what will appear
beside your photo when it’s uploaded you’ll want to
make sure it says something relevant and informative.
548

STEP 3 Now click the Facebook button at the top of
the Share photos window. A browser window will
open and you’ll need to login to your Facebook
account. If you haven’t done so before you’ll also
need to provide authorization for PaintShop Pro to
access your Facebook account. This is also the case
for Flickr and Google Plus. Once that’s done, you’ll
see a new field appear below the Description labeled
People. If you’ve tagged your photos with people and
linked your People tags with your Facebook friends
list, then they’ll appear here. That way, you don’t have
to retag them once they’re uploaded. If you’re not
sure how to do that take a look at page 286.
549

STEP 4 Now click the Facebook button again to turn it
off, then click the Flickr button. Once again there’s the
People field and, as for Facebook this contains any
Flickr contacts tagged in your photos provided you’ve
linked them. There’s some more information in this
panel
including
the
geopositional
data
(see
the
step-by-step project on p. 58 for details of how to add
that), and tags. If you haven’t added tags to your
photos, you can do it now, but it’s best to do it
beforehand (see p. 39 or the step-by-step project on
page 51) as tags added here will be appended to your
uploaded images, but not in PaintShop Pro.
550

STEP 5 Now uncheck the Flickr button and click the
Google+
button.
This
displays
the
fields
for
information that’s automatically sent to Google plus
along with your photos. Unlike Facebook and Flickr,
there are no people tags but, like Flickr, G+ tags your
photos with geopositional data. Both Flickr and G+
use the filename as the image tile.
551

STEP 6 Now click the Album tab and this time check
all three buttons – Facebook, Flickr and Google+ at
the top. This tab allow you to select a Facebook or G+
album, or Flickr set to add your photos to. Only
publicly visible albums are displayed here, so if the
visibility of an album or set is restricted you won’t see
it in the list. Either select a public album or set to add
your photos to or create a new one. It’s important to
be aware that when you upload photos, they’re visible
to the public. That means you’ll have to log in using
your Web browser and amend the privacy settings
after you’ve uploaded your photos, but they’ll be
publicly visible in the meantime.
552

STEP 7 Now you just need to decide whether you
want to upload your photos at the full resolution or
have PaintShop Pro resize them. There are two
options on the Quality pull-down menu – ‘Original –
original
resolution,
slower
upload’
and
‘Recommended
–
resolution
optimized
for
faster
upload’ (older versions of PaintShop Pro offer specific
size options). Select the first option if you want to
upload originals, for example if you’re uploading
photos to Flickr as backups, or if you want others to
be able to download the full sized photos for printing.
The ‘Recommended’ option resizes photos to a
maximum 1600 × 1200 pixels size, which is big
enough for displaying full size on all but the largest
screens. The length of time the upload takes will
depend on the number of photos and the speed of
your Internet connection, but regardless of that, the
Recommended reduced resolution upload will be a lot
quicker.
553

STEP 8 Make one final check to ensure all your
photos are captioned and you have selected or
created albums for the networks you’re uploading to.
Check that you’ve selected the right buttons at the
top, selected networks have a white border, plus you’ll
see them listed in the Album tab. In the screen grab
here, I’m uploading 12 photos to a Flickr set called
Morocco at reduced resolution. If you have Facebook,
Flickr and G+ accounts, it’s possible to upload to all
three simply by checking all three buttons. When
you’re ready, click the upload button.
554

STEP 9 An upload status window appears in which
you can monitor the progress of your upload. When
it’s complete, the window will close. Log in to (in this
case) Flickr, to check the photos are there and to
make any changes to tags, descriptions, privacy
settings and so on.
